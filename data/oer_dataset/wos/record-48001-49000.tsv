Here, we demonstrate that these processes are recorded in the clumped-and single-isotope (delta C-13 and delta O-15) compositions of marbles, which can be used to constrain retrograde metamorphic histories.We collected 27 calcite and dolomite marbles along a transect from the rim to the center of the metamorphic core-complex of Naxos (Greece), and analyzed their carbonate single-and clumped-isotope compositions. The majority of Delta(47) values of whole-rock samples are consistent with exhumation controlled cooling of the metamorphic complex. However, the data also reveal that water-rock interaction, deformation driven recrystallization and thermal shock associated with hydrothermal alteration may considerably impact the overall distribution of Delta(47) values.We analyzed specific carbonate fabrics influenced by deformation and fluid-rock reaction to study how these processes register in the carbonate clumped-isotope system. Delta(47) values of domains drilled from a calcite marble show a bimodal distribution. Low Delta(47) values correspond to an apparent temperature of 260 degrees C and are common in static fabrics; high Delta(47) values correspond to an apparent temperature of 200 degrees C and are common in dynamically recrystallized fabrics. We suggest that the low Delta(47) values reflect diffusion-controlled isotopic reordering during cooling, whereas high Delta(47) values reflect isotopic reordering driven by dynamic recrystallization. We further studied the mechanism by which dynamic recrystallization may alter Delta(47) values by controlled heating experiments. Results show no significant difference between laboratory reactions rates in the static and dynamic fabrics, consistent with a mineral-extrinsic mechanism, in which slip along crystal planes was associated with atomic-scale isotopic reordering in the calcite lattice. An intrinsic mechanism (enhanced isotopic reordering rate in deformed minerals) is contraindicated by these experiments. We suggest that Delta(47) values of dynamically recrystallized fabrics that form below the diffusion-controlled blocking-temperature for calcite constrain the temperature of deformation.We find that 0.47-based temperatures of static fabrics from Naxos marbles are similar to 60-80 degrees C higher than commonly observed in slowly cooled metamorphic rocks, and would suggest cooling rates of similar to 10(5) CMyr(-1). A similar thermal history is inferred for dolomite marbles from the core vicinity, which preserve apparent temperatures up to 200 degrees C higher than a typical blocking temperature (similar to 300 degrees C). This finding could be explained by a hydrothermal event driving a brief thermal pulse and locally resetting Delta(47) values. Rapid cooling of the core-complex region is consistent with a compilation of published cooling ages and a new apatite U-Th/He age, associating the thermal event with the emplacement of a granodiorite pluton at similar to 12 Ma.

J	Wang, Hui; Ki, Jang-Seu					Wang, Hui/0000-0002-4121-1838			Molecular identification, differential expression and protective roles of iron/manganese superoxide dismutases in the green algae Closterium ehrenbergii against metal stress								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PROTISTOLOGY				74						125689	10.1016/j.ejop.2020.125689				JUN 2020	2020	The green microalgae Closterium ehrenbergii is an ideal organism for ecotoxicology assessments; however, its toxicogenomics has been insufficiently examined. Here, we identified three iron/manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD) genes (designated as CeFeSOD1, CeFeSOD2, and CeMnSOD) from C. ehrenbergii and examined their expressional patterns for four metals (iron, manganese, copper, and nickel). These genes encoded 362, 224, and 245 amino acids, respectively; signal-peptide analysis showed that they were differentially located in chloroplasts, cytosol, or mitochondria. Real-time PCRs revealed differential expression patterns according to metal and doses. Interestingly, CeSODs displayed no noticeable changes to treatment with their corresponding cofactor metals, iron or manganese, even at high doses, However, they were obviously up-regulated under toxic :metal (copper and nickel) exposure, exhibiting approximately 10.8- and 4.4-fold increases, respectively, Copper (0.2 mg/L) dramatically stimulated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, increased SOD activity, and reduced photosynthetic efficiency in C. ehrenbergii. These results suggest that CeFeSODs and CeMnSOD might be involved in protecting cells against damage and oxidative stress caused by non-cofactor metals, such as copper and nickel. These genes were sensitively responsive at levels well below the EC50, showing that they can be used as molecular biomarkers to assess the toxicity of specific metal contaminants.

A two-laser method is employed, in which the pulsed output of the first laser at 285 nm photolyzes ozone to produce oxygen atoms and O-2(a(1) Delta(g), nu = 1), and the output of the second laser detects O-2(a(1) Delta g, nu = 1) via resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization. The kinetics of O-2(X-3 Sigma(-)(g), nu = 1) + O(P-3) relaxation is inferred from the temporal evolution of O-2(a(1) Delta(g), nu = 1), an approach enabled by the rapid collision-induced equilibration of the O-2(X-3 Sigma(-)(g) nu = 1) and O-2(a(1) Delta(g), nu = 1) populations in the system. The measured O-2(X-3 Sigma(-)(g), nu = 1) + O(P-3) rate coefficient is (2.9 +/- 0.6) x 10(-12) cm(3) s(-1) at 295 K and (3.4 +/- 0.6) x 10(-12) cm(3) s(-1) at 240 K. These values are consistent with the previously reported result of (3.2 +/- 1.0) x 10(-12) cm(3) s(-1), which was obtained at 315 K using a different experimental approach [K. S. Kalogerakis, R. A. Copeland, and T. G. Slanger, J. Chem. Phys. 123, 194303 (2005)]. For removal of O-2(a(1) Delta g(,) nu = 1) by O(P-3), the upper limits for the rate coefficient are 4 x 10(-13) cm(3) s(-1) at 295 K and 6 x 10(-13) cm(3) s(-1) at 240 K. The rate coefficient for removal of O-2(a(1) Delta(g), nu = 1) by O-2 is (5.6 +/- 0.6) x 10(-11) cm(3) s(-1) at 295 K and (5.9 +/- 0.5) x 10(-11) cm(3) s(-1) at 240 K. The O-2(a(1) Delta(g), nu = 1) + CO2 rate coefficient is (1.5 +/- 0.2) x 10(-14) cm(3) s(-1) at 295 K and (1.2 +/- 0.1) x 10(-14) cm(3) s(-1) at 240 K. The implications of the measured rate coefficients for modeling of atmospheric emissions are discussed. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

J	Cheng, Xueying; Guan, Renquan; Chen, Yunning; Sun, Yingnan; Shang, Qingkun								The unique TiO2(B)/BiOCl0.7I0.3-P Z-scheme heterojunction effectively degrades and mineralizes the herbicide fomesafen								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				431						134021	10.1016/j.cej.2021.134021				MAR 1 2022	2022	A Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst (TiO2(B)/BiOCl0.7I0.3-P) was constructed (B: bronze phase; BiOCl0.7I0.3: a solid solution of BiOCl and BiOI in a molar ratio of 7:3; P: polyvinylpyrrolidone). The open channels parallel to the b-axis between the axial oxygen atoms in the bronze TiO2, the unique layered structure of BiOCl and the excellent light absorption characteristics of BiOI create excellent conditions for the absorption and utilization of light, the separation and transmission of photo-generated carriers in the photocatalytic process. TiO2(B)/BiOCl0.7I0.3-P can almost completely degrade and mineralize fomesafen within 20 min, and the environmental toxicity of the degradation products is significantly reduced. Combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry, the degradation pathway of fomesafen was proposed. In addition, TiO2(B)/BiOCl0.7I0.3-P can also quickly and effectively degrade phenol and acetaminophen, indicating that it has good universality. To eliminate the harm caused by various herbicides to the ecological environment, photocatalytic technology will play an increasingly important role.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000798669300003

Structural characterization by means of X-ray diffraction, small angle X-ray scattering and also confocal Raman spectroscopy revealed the formation of the polyester with embedded titania nanoparticles in agreement with our Raman spectra simulation by means of DFT methodologies. Our theoretical modeling of the polyester also envisaged the interaction of lithium-ion via a tridentate coordination with oxygen atoms of carboxylate (-COO-) and ester (-COO-) groups. There is a slight increase in the degree of polymerization and thermal stability for our lithium-ion polyester with increasing titania nanoparticles concentration. In consequence, a two-order magnitude increase in the ionic conductivity was observed, yielding 1.74x 10(-4) S cm(-1) for a 20% weight fraction of titania nanoparticles. Thus, involving a novel approach based in the synergistic in situ preparation of lithium-ion poly (ethylene citrate) with titania nanoparticles, this procedure contributes to solve the many safety and environmental issues of the constitutive materials of lithium-ion solid polymer electrolytes.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000488419800015

Characterization of the composites and GO (both as received and after removal from the composites) was carried out using atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and tensile testing. Reduction in the GO during polymerization was observed. So too was functionalization of the GO flakes with PA6 chains. FTIR demonstrates the retention of some carbonyl oxygen functionalities after polymerization. AFM imaging indicated the presence of single layer GO and the sheet height increased to similar to 4 nm for graphene sheets after polymerization. This suggests the graphene acts as a base for polymer chain formation, leading to good interfacial interaction between the filler and matrix. Raman data show no evidence of the restoration of sp2 hybrid as a result of polymerization. The nanocomposites are thermally stable while molecular weight and crystallinity have both been affected by GO inclusion. A percentage linear increase in Young's modulus was observed as colloidally dispersed GO content increased.

Analyses of the Ga3d core level spectra acquired from films grown for progressively longer times and comparisons of these data with both thermodynamic models of growth processes and associated atomic force micrographs revealed that the ZnO nucleated and grew via the Stranski-Krastanov mode. Considerations of (1) differences in surface energetics of the polar (0001) surfaces of ZnO and GaN and that of the Ga-based oxide as well as (2) the relatively low stress generated by the moderate lattice mismatches in the a-axis lattice parameters of these compounds supported the observed growth mode. The shifts in the position of the Ga3d core level with increasing deposition time and decreasing peak intensity were caused by surface charging and increasing sampling volumes of the Ga-based oxide as well as the growing ZnO layer. The island/ocean morphology of the Ga-based oxide controlled the morphology of the initial ZnO layer, which, in turn controlled the locations and the morphologies of the subsequently nucleated ZnO islands. Scanning electron microscopy of thicker ZnO films revealed a highly textured microstructure. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

A nitrate-reducing, [Fe(II)EDTA](2-) oxidizing strain was isolated and named strain BDN-1. The G + C content of strain BDN-1 was 67%, and the organism was closely affiliated to Paracoccus denitrificans, P. pantotrophus and P. versutus by 16S rRNA sequence comparison. Results from DNA-DNA hybridization, rep-PCR., and whole cell protein analysis gave congruent results confirming the genotypic and phenotypic differences between strain BDN-1 and the other species of Paracoccus. From these results, we considered strain BDN-1 as a novel species for which we propose the name Paracoccus ferrooxidans. Apart from [Fe(II)EDTA]2-, BDN-1 could also use thiosulfate and thiocyanate as inorganic electron donors. Nitrate, nitrite, N2O, [Fe(II)EDTA(.)NO](2-) and oxygen could be used by strain BDN-1 as electron acceptors. Repeated transfer on a culture medium with bicarbonate as the sole carbon source confirmed that strain BDN-1 was a facultative autotroph. [Fe(II)EDTA]2- oxidation dependent, denitrification was also performed by other Paracoccus species, that were closely affiliated to P. ferrooxidans. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

After a first flash, the product of the reaction of DPC with the first Photosystem II charge separation was unstable (half-decay around 1 s at pH 6.5) until converted into a stable one by a second flash. The formation of the unstable intermediate was rather favored at alkaline pH. Its concentration increased progressively with pH to reach a maximum at pH 7.2-7.4, Nevertheless, consumption of this intermediate required a proton binding, since its regeneration after the second flash needed a latency dark time inversely proportional to proton concentration. (2) Each step of the process was accompanied by proton exchange with the medium. At acidic pH, the odd flashes in a series induced acidification, whereas on even flashes occurred alkalinization. The pattern of proton release/uptake varied extremely as a function of pH, between 4 H+ and -2 H+/e(-), with opposite changes at acidic and basic pH. At neutral pH, 1 H+/e(-) was assumed to be released at each step. On the basis of these results and data already in the literature, the molecular details of the pH-dependent part of the deprotonation are discussed in terms of electrostatic interactions between the polarized catalytic center and bound H+ and OH- ions. The described two-photostep process is proposed to reflect the two-electron water oxidation to an hydrogen peroxide intermediate.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0005-2728			WOS:A1995RP84300006

By exchanging PSII samples with buffered O-18 water, we found that a positive band at 606 cm(-1) in the S-2/S-1 spectrum in O-16 water is clearly downshifted to 596 cm(-1) in O-18 water. By taking double-difference (S-2/S-1 and O-16 minus O-18) spectra, we assign the 606 cm(-1) mode to an St mode and also identify a corresponding S-1 mode at about 625 cm(-1). In addition, by Sr and Ca-44 substitution experiments, we found that the 606 cm(-1) mode is upshifted to about 618 cm(-1) by Sr2+ substitution but that this mode is not affected by substitution with the Ca-44 isotope. On the basis of these results and also on the basis of studies of Mn model compounds, we assign the 625 cm(-1) mode in the S-1 state and the 606 cm(-1) mode in the S-2 State to a Mn-O-Mn cluster vibration of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in PSII. This structure may include additional bridge(s), which could be another ore, carboxylato(s), or atoms derived from an amino acid side chain. Our results indicate that the bridged oxygen atom shown in this Mn-O-Mn cluster is exchangeable and accessible by water. The downshift in the Mn-O-Mn cluster vibration as manganese is oxidized during the S-1 --> S-2 transition is counterintuitive; we discuss possible origins of this behavior. Our results also indicate that Sr2+ substitution in PSII causes a small structural perturbation that affects the bond strength of the Mn-O-Mn cluster in the PSII OEC. This suggests that Sr2+ and by inference, Ca2+, communicates with, but is not integral to, the manganese core.									76	1	0	0	45	0	76			0006-2960			WOS:000165602400002	11087389

However, the application of DMFCs is presently challenged because of the limited activity and durability of cathode catalysts as well as the poisoning issues caused by methanol permeation to the cathode during operation. Herein, we report a new class of Rh-doped PdCu nanoparticles (NPs) with ordered intermetallic structure for enhancing the activity and durability of the cathode for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and achieving superior methanol tolerance. The disordered Rh-doped PdCu NPs can be prepared via a simple wet-chemical method, followed by annealing to convert it to ordered phases. The results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), power X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) successfully demonstrate the formation of near-spherical NPs with an average size of 6.5 +/- 0.5 nm and the conversion of the phase structure. The complete phase transition temperatures of Rh-doped PdCu NPs and PdCu are 500 and 400 degrees C, respectively. The molar ratio of Rh/Pd/Cu in the as-synthesized Rh-doped PdCu NPs is 5/48/47. Benefitting from Rh doping and the presence of the ordered intermetallic structure, the Rh-doped PdCu intermetallic electrocatalyst achieves the maximum ORR mass activity of 0.96 A.mg(-1) at 0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under alkaline conditions-a 7.4-fold enhancement compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. For different electrocatalysts, the ORR activities follow the sequence, ordered Rh-doped PdCu intermetallics > ordered PdCu intermetallics > disordered Rh-doped PdCu NPs > disordered PdCu NPs > commercial Pt/C catalyst. In addition, the distinct structure endows the Rh-doped PdCu intermetallics with highly stable ORR durability with unaltered half-wave potential (E-1/2) and mass activity after continuous 20000 cycles, which are higher than those of other electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the E-1/2 of the Rh-doped PdCu intermetallics decreases by only 5 mV after adding 0.5 mol.L-1 methanol to the electrolyte, while the commercial Pt/C catalyst negatively shifts by 235 mV and a distinct oxidation peak can be observed. The results indicate that the ORR activity of the Rh-doped PdCu intermetallic electrocatalyst can be well maintained even in the presence of poisoning environment. Our results have demonstrated that Rh-doped PdCu NPs with ordered intermetallic structures is a potential electrocatalyst toward the next-generation high-performance DMFCs.									27	5	0	0	0	0	27			1000-6818			WOS:000572421800017

GO films with different layers were fabricated on fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) conductive glass using the anodic electrophoretic deposition process. The degree of oxidation was regulated by cathodic electrochemical reduction. The as-prepared GO films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet-visible absorption (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis. The number of GO layers was varied between 77 and 570 by controlling the electrophoretic deposition time (from 20 to 350 s). Changing the degree of oxidation caused the optical gap of GO to vary between 1.0 and 2.7 eV, and also impacted the edge of the conduction band and the Fermi energy for the sample. As a p-type semiconductor, a p-n junction can be formed between reduced GO and FTO.

PESTICIDE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY				160				79	86		10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.07.004				OCT 2019	2019	Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are important recognition receptors which play a critical role in signal identification and transmission in Toll or immune deficiency (IMD) pathways, particularly when pathogens evade and circumvent reactive oxygen species. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) synthesis can be activated by these signals to further eliminate pathogens. In this study, we cloned and characterized three different PGRP genes in Plutella xylostella strains, DBM1Ac-S, DBM1Ac-R and a field strain (DBM-F). The results showed that PGRP1 belongs to the PGRP-SA family, PGRP2 to PGRP-LB, and PGRP3 to PGRP-LF. Moreover, PGRP1 expressed the highest transcript level, followed by PGRP3 and PGRP2, in two tissues including the gut and the larval carcass tissues of the DBM1Ac-S strain. Furthermore, altered expression levels of PGRP1-3 genes were detected in both gut and carcass tissues. Moreover, the DBM1Ac-R strain had the highest phenol oxidase (PO) activity among these three strains. The characterization of PGRP gene expression and PO activity in DBM1Ac-S, DBM1Ac-R and DBM-F provides insights into their important physiological roles in the immune system of P. xylostella exposed to Bt CrylAc toxin.									7	1	0	0	7	0	8			0048-3575	1095-9939		WOS:000487571100009	31519260

In the present we investigated effects of nano-anatase TiO2 on the spectral responses and photochemical activities of D1/D2/Cyt b559 complex of spinach. Several effects of nano-anatase TiO2 were observed: (I) UV-vis spectrum was blue shifted in both Soret and Q bands, and the absorption intensity Was obviously increased: (2) resonance Raman spectrum showed four main peaks. which are ascribed to carotene, and the Raman peak intensity was as 6.98 times as that of the control: (3) the fluorescence emission peak Was blue shifted and the intensity was decreased by 23.59%; (4) the DCPIP photoreduction activity showed 129.24% enhancement: (5) the oxygen-evolving rate of PSII was elevated by 51.89%.

This engineering may take place within the patient's body or tissue can be regenerated in a bioreactor for later implantation into the patient. Regeneration of soft tissue is one of the most demanding applications of tissue engineering. Producing proper nutrient supply, uniform cell distribution and high cell density are the important challenges. Many experimental models exist for tissue growth in a bioreactor. It is important to put experiments into a theoretical framework. Mathematical modelling in terms of physical and biochemical mechanisms is the best tool to understand experimental results.In this work a mathematical model of convective and diffusive transport of nutrients and cell evolution in a perfusion bioreactor is developed. A cell-seeded porous scaffold is placed in a perfusion bioreactor and fluid delivers the nutrients to the cells for their growth. The model describes the key features of the tissue engineering processes which includes the interaction between the cell growth, variation of material permeability due to cell proliferation, flow of fluid through the material and delivery of nutrients to the cells. The fluid flow through the porous scaffold is modelled by Darcy's law, and the delivery of nutrients to the cells is modelled by the advection-diffusion equation. A non-linear reaction diffusion system is used to model the cell growth. The growth of cells is modelled by logistic growth. COMSOL (a commercial finite element solver) is used to numerically solve the model. The results show that the distribution of cells and total cell number in the scaffold does not depend on the initial cell density but depend on the material permeability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

J	Zhao, QH								Late Cainozoic Ostracod faunas and paleoenvironmental changes at ODP Site 1148 South China Sea								MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY				54	1-2			27	47		10.1016/j.marmicro.2004.09.002				JAN 2005	2005	Ostracod faunas from ODP Site 1148 in the South China Sea have been analyzed quantitatively in order to understand palcoenvironmental changes in the late Cainozoic deep water. More than 2000 core samples were taken from the Oligocene to Quaternary section, of which 725 contained ostracods and yielded at least 100 species. Krithe dominates the faunas throughout the Oligocene-Quaternary sequences, indicating that deep-sea conditions had existed since the earliest Oligocene (ca. 34.5 Ma). This suggests that the spreading of the South China Sea Basin predates the Oligocene. Three distinct ostracod assemblages have been recognized and their respective faunal turnover reflects a change in paleodepth from the upper bathyal (<1500 m) in the early Oligocene (ca. 34.5-27 Ma) and lower bathyal (1500-2500 m) in the late Oligocene to early middle Miocene (26-14 Ma) to a depth similar to the present (>2500 m) since the late middle Miocene (14 Ma to the present). Intervals when ostracods become very rare are at 28.5-27, 20-18.2 and 13-2.8 Ma. The earliest of these intervals was probably related to the high surface productivity and the depletion of oxygen content in bottom water. while intervals were the product of enhanced carbonate dissolution.Measures of evolutionary activity (origination, extinction and diversity) have been applied to detecting the environmental change and their relationship to global events. Five peaks of evolutionary activity occurred in the Oligocene (P18, P21a and P22) and in the earlier mid-Miocene N8 and late Pliocene-Quaternary N21-N22. respectively. The peaks in P18 and P21a are the possible response respectively to the global cooling events Oi-1 and Oi-2, which occurred in the early Oligocene. The marked increase in extinction. origination and diversity was synchronous with the major enrichment in benthic delta(18)O in the late Pliocene N21, suggesting a reaction of the ostracod faunas to the rapid cooling of the bottom water and the initiation of the North Hemispheric Glaciation during the period of 3-2.5 Ma.

Strain PCC 6803								MBIO				11	4					e00882-20	10.1128/mBio.00882-20				JUL-AUG 2020	2020	Methylglyoxal (MG) is a detrimental metabolic by-product that threatens most organisms (in humans MG causes diabetes). MG is predominantly detoxified by the glyoxalase pathway. This process begins with the conjugation of MG with glutathione (GSH), yielding a hemithioacetal product that is subsequently transformed by the glyoxalase enzymes into D-lactate and GSH. MG has been overlooked in photosynthetic organisms, although they inevitably produce it not only by the catabolism of sugars, lipids, and amino acids, as do heterotrophic organisms, but also by their active photoautotrophic metabolism. This is especially true for cyanobacteria that are regarded as having developed photosynthesis and GSH-dependent enzymes to detoxify the reactive oxygen species produced by their photosynthesis (CO2 assimilation) and respiration (glucose catabolism), which they perform in the same cell compartment. In this study, we used a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches to characterize a logical, but as yet never described, link between MG detoxification and a (prokaryotic) representative of the evolutionarily conserved glutathione transferase (GST) detoxification enzymes. We show that the SII0067 GST of the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 plays a prominent role in MG tolerance and detoxification, unlike the other five GSTs of this organism. SII0067 catalyzes the conjugation of MG with GSH to initiate its elimination driven by glyoxalases. These results are novel because the conjugation of MG with GSH is always described as nonenzymatic. They will certainly stimulate the analysis of SII0067 orthologs from other organisms with possible impacts on human health (development of biomarkers or drugs) and/or agriculture.IMPORTANCE In most organisms, methylglyoxal (MG), a toxic metabolite by-product that causes diabetes in humans, is predominantly detoxified by the glyoxalase enzymes. This process begins with the so-called "spontaneous" conjugation of MG with the cytoprotectant metabolite glutathione (GSH). In this study, we unravel a logical, but as yet unsuspected, link between MG detoxification and a (prokaryotic) representative of the ubiquitous glutathione transferase (GST) enzymes. We show that a GST of a model cyanobacterium plays a prominent role in the detoxification of MG in catalyzing its conjugation with GSH. This finding is important because this reaction, always regarded as nonenzymatic, could exist in plants and/or human and thus have an impact on agriculture and/or human health.									10	0	0	0	8	0	10			2150-7511			WOS:000572063700005	32753490

Origin of major dissolved ions in groundwater within the Lower Pra Basin using groundwater geochemistry, source-rock deduction and stable isotopes of H-2 and O-18								ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES				71	12			5079	5097		10.1007/s12665-013-2912-z				JUN 2014	2014	Hydrochemical and stable isotopes (O-18 and H-2) analyses of groundwater samples were employed to establish the origin of major dissolved ions in groundwater within the Lower Pra Basin. Results showed that, the major processes responsible for chemical evolution of groundwater include: silicate (SiO4)(4-) dissolutions, ion exchange reactions, sea aerosol spray and pyrite (FeS2) and arsenopyrite (FeAsS) oxidations. The groundwater is strongly acidic to neutral, with pH generally range from 3.5 to 7.0 pH units and mean 5.9 (+/- 0.5). Approximately 89 % of boreholes had pH values outside the World Heath Organization (WHO, Guidelines for drinking water quality, 2004) guideline value for drinking water due principally to natural biogeochemical processes and therefore, not suitable for potable purposes. Electrical conductivity (EC) range from 57.6 to 1,201 mu S/cm with mean 279.3 (+/- 198.8) mu S/cm. Total dissolved solids (TDS) range from 32 to 661 mg/L with mean 151.7 (+/- 106.8) mg/L, with 98.6 % of groundwater as fresh (TDS < 500 mg/L). The chemical constituents generally have low concentrations and are within the WHO (Guidelines for drinking water quality, 2004) guideline value for drinking water. The relative abundance of cations and anions is in the order: Na+ > Ca2+> Mg2+ > K+ and HCO3 (-) > Cl- > SO4 (2-), respectively. A plot of a,O-18 aEuro degrees against H-2 aEuro degrees showed that, ground and surface waters clustered on or closely along the Global Meteoric Water Line, suggesting that, the waters emanated principally from meteoric source with evaporation playing an insignificant role on the infiltrating water.									14	0	0	0	5	0	14			1866-6280	1866-6299		WOS:000336397100012

In some parts of the aquifer, salinity exceeds 13 g L-1, which poses serious problems to the safe use of the groundwater in irrigation and drinking purposes.The present work aims to delineate the saline water plumes and to understand their salinization processes. A field survey including surface water and groundwater sampling was conducted. The taken samples were analyzed for major chemical elements (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Cl-, SO42- and NO3-) and stables isotopes composition (O-18 and H-2). The geochemical data were used to characterize and classify the water samples. Stable isotopes are useful tools to understand recharge processes and to differentiate between salinity origins. Indeed, the saline groundwater zones are concentrated in the center, the north-west (Aziz mountain) and south-west parts of the plain (City Al Fahs). The evolution of the groundwater salinization according to the main flow direction is principally caused by rock-water interaction which is mainly represented by the dissolution/precipitation of minerals dispersed in the saline reservoir formation and ion exchange reaction. Stable isotopes signature indicates that some water samples are originated from the infiltration of modern precipitation. Non evaporated water is rapidly infiltrated to the saturated zone with relatively lower contents of delta O-18 and delta H-2. Thus, most of the samples are presenting enrichment in heavy isotopes which highlight the occurrence of evaporation process of meteoric water prior to groundwater recharge. Furthermore, anthropogenic phenomenon represented by the return-flow of irrigation water and the use of nitrogen fertilizers were identified as non negligible contamination sources in the northeastern part of the aquifer near the irrigated perimeters. These wide variations in water salinity indicate variability in geochemical process controlling aquifer water mineralization in Sminja plain.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			1464-343X	1879-1956		WOS:000447096300039

Induction of the chlorophyll fluorescence on the first flash, reflecting electron transport from Y-Z to P680(+), exhibited a strong pH dependence with a pK of 7.6 in the dark-grown wild type which lacks the Mn cluster. The chlorophyll fluorescence decay, measured in the presence of DCMU, which reflects recombination between Q(A)(-) and Y-Z(ox), was also pH-dependent with a similar pK of 7.5. These results indicate participation by the same base, which is suggested to be D1-H190, in oxidation and reduction of Y-Z in forward electron transfer and recombination pathways, respectively. This hypothesis was tested in the D1-H190 mutants. Induction of chlorophyll fluorescence in these H190 mutants has been observed to be inefficient due to slow electron transfer from Y-Z to P680(+) [Roffey, R. A., et al. (1994) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1185, 257-270]. We show that this reaction is pH-dependent, with a pK of 8.1, and at pH greater than or equal to 9, the fluorescence induction is efficient in the H190 mutants, suggesting direct titration of Y-Z. The efficient oxidation of Y-Z (approximate to 70% at pH 9.0) at high pH was confirmed by kinetic EPR measurements. In contrast to the wild type, the H190 mutants show little or no observable fluorescence decay. Our data suggest that H190 is an essential component in the electron transfer reactions in photosystem II and acts as a proton acceptor upon Y-Z oxidation. In the H190 mutants, this reaction is inefficient and Y-Z oxidation only occurs at elevated pHs when Y-Z itself probably is deprotonated. We also propose that H190 is able to return a proton to Y-Z(ox) during electron recombination from Q(A)(-) in a reaction which does not take place in the D1-H190 mutants.									119	0	1	0	77	0	120			0006-2960			WOS:000076383900039	9760263

Adsorption energies of atomic oxygen on doped rutiles M-D-(MO2)-O-H, where transition metal MD is doped into (MO2)-O-H, were expressed in terms of a contribution from adsorption on the pure oxide of the dopant M-D and perturbations to this adsorption energy caused by changing its neighboring metal cations and lattice parameters to that of the host oxide (MO2)-O-H, which we call the ligand and strain effects, respectively. Our analysis of atom projected density of states revealed that the t(2g)-band center had the strongest correlation with adsorption energies. We show that charge transfer mediated shifts to the t(2g)-band center describe the ligand effect, and the radii of the atomic orbitals of metal cations can predict the magnitude and direction of this charge transfer. Strain produces systematic shifts to all features of the atom projected density of states, but correlations between the strain effect and the electronic structure were dependent on the chemical identity of the metal cation. The slope of these correlations can be related to the idealized d-band filling. This work elucidates the underlying physics describing adsorption on doped late transition metal oxides and establishes a foundation for models that use known chemical properties for the prediction of reactivity.

It consists of three parts: a model of the bulk electrolyte, the diffusion layer, and the electrode surface. Data from the literature was used to validate both the bulk portion of the model, as well as the overall model. Results from the literature were further explored and explained by reference to the model and faradaic efficiency is predicted very well (R-Square of 0.99 for the fitted data, and 0.98 for the non-fitted data). The primary effect of increasing the pressure on a CO2 electrolyzer is seen to be increasing the maximum attainable partial current density, while the faradaic efficiency and specific energy of formation plateau at pressures above 10-20 bar, at 95% and of 3.7 kWh/kg, respectively. Unlike the efficiencies, the profitability of running a reactor increases with pressure, following a similar trend as partial current density, showing the importance of this quantity as a performance metric of a CO2 electrolyzer. In general this work shows the utility of a model of this sort in the design, evaluation and operation of CO2 electrolyzers. (C) The Author(s) 2019.

Saturation magnetization values observed for zinc oxide (average size, 9 +/- 1.2 nm) and titanium dioxide (average size, 4.4 +/- 0.3 nm) NPs are 62.37 and 42.17 memu/g, respectively, which are several orders of magnitude larger than those of previous reports. In contrast to the previous works, no postprocessing treatments or surface modification is required to induce ferromagnetism in the case of present communication. The most important result, related to the field of intrinsic ferromagnetism in nonmagnetic materials, is the observation of size dependent ferromagnetism. Degree of ferromagnetism in titanium dioxide increases with the increase in particle size, while it is reverse for zinc oxide. Surface and volume defects play significant roles for the origin of RTF in zinc oxide and titanium dioxide NPs, respectively. Single ionized oxygen and neutral zinc vacancies in zinc oxide and oxygen and neutral/ionized titanium vacancies in titanium dioxide are considered as predominant defect centres responsible for observed ferromagnetism. It is expected that origin of ferromagnetism is a consequence of exchange interactions between localized electron spin moments resulting from point defects.

Spinach chloroplasts, thylakoids and Photosystem II proteins were employed as biotools in combination with colorimetric assays based on dichlorophenol indophenole (DCIP) photoreduction and on fluorescence emission techniques. It was found that copper and mercury demonstrated a strong and rapid photosynthetic activity inhibition, that varied from proteins to membranes, while other metals like nickel, cobalt and manganese produced only slight inhibition effects on all tested photosynthetic materials. By emission measurements, only copper was found to rapidly influence the photosynthetic material signals. These findings give interesting information about the rapid effects of heavy metals on isolated photosynthetic samples, and are in addition to the literature data concerning the effects of growth in heavy metal enriched media.

Herein, by means of systematic density functional theory (DFT) computations, we demonstrated that the two-dimensional (2D) PdSeO3 monolayer is a promising candidate. The mechanical exfoliation of PdSeO3 monolayer from its bulk phase is experimentally feasible due to the rather small cleavage energy of similar to 0.42 J/m(2). Remarkably, PdSeO3 monolayer is semiconducting with a moderate indirect band gap of 2.84 eV, and its valence and conduction bands perfectly engulf the redox potentials of water. In particular, water oxidation and hydrogen reduction half reactions can both occur readily on the different active sites of PdSeO3 monolayer under the potentials solely provided by photogenerated electrons and holes. As PdSeO3 monolayer also has rather pronounced optical absorption in the visible and ultraviolet regions of the solar spectrum, it could be utilized as a highly efficient photocatalyst for splitting pure water into H-2 and O-2 in a stoichiometric amount of 2:1 without using sacrificial reagents or cocatalysts.									143	12	0	0	10	0	144			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000446142500046	30169028

Strategies must be adopted to suppress the diffusion of polysulfides into the electrolyte in Li-S battery. In this work, for the first time, we adopt hydrophilic carbon paper anchored by hierarchically porous cobalt disulfides as the interlayer for capturing polysulfides through physical absorption and chemical bonding. Hierarchical pores can physically adsorb polysulfides, and moreover cobalt disulfide can trap the polysulfides by forming strong chemical interaction. The sulfur-graphene composite with a sulfur content of 70.5% delivers a high initial capacity of 1239.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and retains a reversible capacity of 818 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles. In spite of a little capacity contribution by the insertion of lithium ions into cobalt disulfide for the initial cycles, it disappears in the subsequent cycling. Therefore, the as-developed porous transition metal disulfides on carbon paper as the interlayer could significantly enhance the cycling performance of Li-S batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The flow curves observed are typical of the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) and have exhibited single or multiple peak in the flow stress before reaching steady state, depending on the temperature and strain rate. Three different windows of temperature and strain rate have been identified in which the kinetic rate equation is obeyed by the temperature and strain rate dependence of flow stress. Both the power-law and hyperbolic sine relation yielded similar results. In the strain rate range 0.001-1.0 s(-1) and temperature range 400-600degreesC, the stress exponent is 7.8 and the apparent activation energy is 159 kJ/mole, and these indicate that dislocation core diffusion is the rate controlling mechanism. In the strain rate range 0.001-1.0 s(-1) and temperature range 700-950degreesC, the stress exponent is 7.1 and the apparent activation energy is 198 kJ/mole which matches well with that for lattice self diffusion in copper. The switching of the rate controlling mechanisms at temperatures higher than 700degreesC has been attributed to the "clogging" of the dislocation pipes due to the rapid increase in the solid solubility of oxygen at higher temperatures. In the high strain rate range 30-100 s(-1) and temperature range 700-950degreesC, the stress exponent is 3.5 and the apparent activation energy is 91 kJ/mole which matches with that for grain boundary diffusion in copper. The apparent activation energy in electrolytic copper in all the above temperature and strain rate windows increases with increasing oxygen content and this is attributed to the increase in the back stress due to the presence of copper oxide particles in the matrix.

These CEs were used in place of the routinely used expensive platinum CEs for the catalytic reduction of a triiodide electrolyte. The structure and morphology of the MoS2 was analyzed by using Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurements and the DSSC characteristics were investigated. An unbroken film of MoS2 was identified on the FTO crystallites from field-emission scanning electron microscopy. Cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and Tafel curve measurements reveal the promise of MoS2 as a CE with a low charge-transfer resistance, high electrocatalytic activity, and fast reaction kinetics for the reduction of triiodide to iodide. Finally, an optimized transparent MoS2 CE, obtained after 5min synthesis time, showed a high power-conversion efficiency of 6.0%, which comparable to the performance obtained with a Pt CE (6.6%) when used in TiO2-based DSCCs, thus signifying the importance of sputtering time on DSSC performance.									24	0	0	0	1	0	24			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000367325400026	26472540

The Pt films grown by multiple Pb UPD-SLRR cycles (1-10) exhibit comparable roughness as determined by integration of the H UPD charge. In contrast to that, due to the 2:1 stoichiometry of the replacement between Cu UPD layer and PtCl42+ ions, the Pt films grown by Cu UPD-SLRR show a steady increase of the roughness with the number of deposition cycles (1-10). The differences in the structure of the films have been used as a platform to study the stripping of pre-adsorbed CO and the formic acid oxidation (FAO) reaction as a function of their thickness. On Pt films of comparable roughness grown by SLRR of Pb UPD, the CO stripping peak shows no significant changes in the onset potential and a small peak maximum shift of similar to 7 mV between the film of lowest (1 ML) and all higher thicknesses (2-10 ML). However, Pt films grown by SLRR of Cu UPD show a larger potential window of differences of similar to 26 mV over which the peak maximum potentials shift more negative with the number of deposition cycles. The most positive CO stripping potential obtained for a sub-ML Pt (similar to 0.56 ML) grown by a single SLRR cycle suggests CO is more strongly bonded than on films grown by multiple replacements that completely cover the Au substrate. The measured activity toward FAO is in agreement with the CO electro-oxidation results. No significant differences in the activity for FAO have been observed on Pt films of comparable roughness grown by SLRR of Pb UPD which show activity close to that of pure Pt. However, a more significant change of FAO reactivity has been measured for Pt films grown via SLRR of Cu UPD with the highest activity measured for a sub-ML Pt deposit. Following subsequent replacements, the FAO activity tends towards that of pure Pt. The observed differences in the catalytic behaviour of Pt films grown by SLRR are the result of the differences in their morphology and the nanocluster structure of the films. On sub-monolayer Pt films, the behaviour is dominated by nanocluster size and coverage of the deposit. For a completely covered surface of Au, the effect of roughness of Pt films and nanocluster nature of the deposit has a dominant role in the behaviour and activity. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Cobalt oxide has multiple redox states for generating redox reactions for charge storage, while N-doped graphite can provide high electrical conductivity for charge transfer. In this study, it is the first time to synthesize binder-free electrodes composed of cobalt oxide and N-doped graphite derived from ZIF67 on carbon cloth (CC) for supercapacitor (SC). Successive oxidation and carbonization along with additional coverage of ZIF67 derivatives are applied to synthesize ZIF67 derivatives composed of cobalt oxide, N-doped graphite and cobalt oxide/N-doped graphite composites with different layer compositions. The highest specific capacitance (C-F) of 90.0F/g at 20 mV/s is obtained for the oxidized ZIF67/carbonized ZIF67/carbon cloth (O67/C67/CC) electrode, due to the large surface area and high electrical conductivity benefitted from preferable morphology and growing sequence of Co3O4 and N-doped graphite. The symmetric SC composed of O67/C67/CC electrodes shows the maximum energy density of 2.53 Wh/kg at the power density of 50 W/kg. Cycling stability with C-F retention of 70% and Coulombic efficiency of 65% after 6000 times repeatedly charge/discharge process is also obtained for this symmetric SC. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Among several supported transition metals, Ag/MgO showed the best performance in degradation of azo dyes and the structure and micro morphology of selected Ag/MgO catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). The results show that Ag was evenly dispersed on the surface of MgO in the form of nano clusters, and the formation of bimetallic sites between Ag and Mg and the high electron density of Ag in the catalysts give it high catalytic activity. In formaldehyde solution, azo dye AR1 could be efficiently degraded at room temperature without illuminating or heating treatment. Temperature and formaldehyde concentration are the main factors affecting the degradation efficiency. The degradation efficiency increased with temperature and the optimal formaldehyde concentration was 1 mol.L-1. Two kinds of free radicals were detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) trapping experiment to play significant roles in azo dyes degradation process. The reductive hydrogen radical and oxidizing superoxide radical synergistic effect could easily break the chromogenic group (-N=N-) in dye molecules. This "reduction-oxidation" synergistic mechanism improves the reaction efficiency. Moreover, as one of the common pollutants, using aldehyde promoter achieves the "dual treatment of pollutants".									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-4861			WOS:000627578500012

Owing to their structural diversity, functional adjustability, and high surface area, different types of MOF-based single metal sites are well exploited, including coordinately unsaturated metal sites from metal nodes and metallolinkers, as well as active metal species immobilized to MOFs. Furthermore, controllable thermal transformation of MOFs can upgrade them to nanomaterials functionalized with active single-atom catalysts (SACs). These unique features of MOFs and their derivatives enable them to serve as a highly versatile platform for catalysis, which has actually been becoming a rapidly developing interdisciplinary research area. In this review, we overview the recent developments of catalysis at single metal sites in MOF-based materials with emphasis on their structures and applications for thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis. We also compare the results and summarize the major insights gained from the works in this review, providing the challenges and prospects in this emerging field.									357	16	0	0	38	0	357			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000588271100008	32356657

As the MnO2 nanoflower working as precursor was partially reduced, Mn3O4 nanoparticles were in situ grown from the MnO2 nanosheet. The composite microspheres were characterized in detail by employing scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), vibration sample magnetometer (VSM) and UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-vis). Under visible light conditions, the test for degrading rhodamine B (RhB) was used to verify the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst. The results showed that the efficiency of the Fe3O4/MnO2/Mn3O4 photocatalyst in visible light for 130 min is 94.5%. The catalytic activity of photocatalyst far exceeded that of the Fe3O4/MnO2 component, and after four cycles, the catalytic performance of the catalyst remained at 78.4%. The superior properties of the photocatalyst came from improved surface area, enhanced light absorption, and efficient charge separation of the MnO2/Mn3O4 heterostructure. This study constructed a green and efficient valence heterostructure composite that created a promising photocatalyst for degrading organic contaminants in aqueous environments.									15	0	0	0	3	0	15				2073-4344		WOS:000478652600014

Here the vertical NiFc-MOF NAs constructed from agaric-like nanosheets were fabricated by introducing a ligand containing an exotic Fe atom to coordinate with Ni ion using Ni(OH)(2) NAs as a self-sacrificing template. The NiFc-MOF NAs exhibited superior water oxidation performance with a very low overpotential of 161 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm (-2). Chronoamperometry was tested at an overpotential of 250 mV, which delivered an initial industrial-grade current density of 702 mA cm(-2) and still remained at 694 mA cm(-2) after 24 h. Furthermore, it possessed fast reaction kinetics with a small Tafel slope of 29.5 mV dec(-1). The superior electrocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the structural advantage of vertically grown agaric-like NAs and the synergistic electron coupling between Ni and Fe atoms, namely, electron transfer from Ni to Fe atoms in NiFc-MOF NAs. The exposed density and valence state of active Ni sites were synchronously increased. Furthermore, the energy barrier for the adsorption/desorption of oxygenated intermediates was ultimately optimized for water oxidation. This work provides a novelty orientation to accelerate electrocatalytic performance of MOF NAs by introducing self-sacrificing templates containing one metal and synergistic ligand containing dissimilar metal.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000829847100001	35834636

For this study, a dozen manganese oxides (MnOx) with various solid-state structures were synthesised and carefully characterised by various physical and chemical methods. WOC by the different MnOx was then investigated with Ce4+ as chemical oxidant. Oxides with layered structures (birnessites) and those containing large tunnels (todorokites) clearly gave the best results with reaction rates exceeding 1250 mmol(O2) mol(Mn)(-1)h(-1) or about 50 mu mol(O2)m(-2)h(-1). In comparison, catalytic rates per mole of Mn of oxides characterised by well-defined 3D networks were rather low (e.g., ca. 90 mmol(O2) mol(Mn)(-1) h(-1) for bixbyite, Mn2O3), but impressive if normalised per unit surface area (> 100 mu mol(O2) m(-2)h(-1) for marokite, CaMn2O4). Thus, two groups of MnOx emerge from this screening as hot candidates for manganese-based WOC materials: 1) amorphous oxides with tunnelled structures and the well-established layered oxides; 2) crystalline Mn-III oxides. However, synthetic methods to increase surface areas must be developed for the latter to obtain good catalysis rates per mole of Mn or per unit catalyst mass.									37	1	0	0	1	0	37			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000363331900040	26332508

These components were small volume laboratory experiments, intermediate-and large-volume field experiments, and assessment of the operational-scale waste-rock stockpiles, which facilitated characterization of waste-rock weathering at different scales. The heavily instrumented large-scale field experiments (test piles) were constructed to replicate, as closely as practicable, the temperature, water flow, and gas transport regimes of a waste-rock pile that is exposed to annual freezing and thawing cycles and to facilitate characterization of the long-term weathering of a low-sulfide waste rock. An integrated conceptual model of sulfide-bearing waste-rock weathering, developed at the small scale, was applied to assess the capacity of the conceptual model to capture the geochemical evolution of the waste rock at the large field-scale test-pile experiment. The integrated conceptual model was implemented using reactive transport code MIN3P, taking into account scale-dependent mechanisms. The test-pile mineralogy was similar to the small-scale laboratory experiments and included low-sulfide waste rock with an S content of 0.053 wt% (primarily pyrrhotite). The flow regime of the test pile was simulated using parameters measured as part of other DWRP investigations, including temporally variable infiltration estimates that represented the measured precipitation events at the site. The temporally and spatially variable temperature of the test pile was interpolated from values measured using instrumentation installed at the beginning of the experiment and was included in the simulation to refine the temperature dependence of the geochemical reactions. To allow continuous, multiyear simulation, freezing was also simulated to represent the conditions experienced at the test-pile experiment. Normalized root mean square error analysis of the large-scale field experiment simulation results indicated most parameters compare well to measured daily mass flux (i.e., the fraction of the range of annual values encompassed in the residual was less than 0.5 for SO4, Fe, Ni, Si, Ca, K, Mg, Na, and pH and 1.0 or less for all parameters except Cu). The method of using an integrated conceptual model developed from the results of humidity cell experiments to implement a mechanistic approach for assessing the primary geochemical processes of waste-rock weathering on a large scale was shown to provide reasonable results; however, the results are specific to the study site and the approach requires application to various sites under different geological and climatological conditions to facilitate further refinement.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-7722	1873-6009		WOS:000813472800003	35640422

In this study, genes for FAB2, FAD2-2, FAD6 and SLD1, were cloned from peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.). The ORFs of the four genes were 1,221, 1,152, 1,329 and 1,347 bp in length, encoding 406, 383, 442 and 448 amino acids, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequences of AhFAB2, AhFAD2-2, AhFAD6, AhSLD1 shared high sequence identity of 79, 76.2, 73.4 and 61% to the corresponding ones in Arabidopsis, respectively. Heterologous expression in yeast was used to confirm the regioselectivity and the function of AhFAD2-2 and AhFAD6. Linoleic acid (18:2), normally not present in wild-type yeast cells, was detected in transformants of these two genes. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that the transcript abundances of AhFAB2 and AhFAD2-1 were higher in seed than that in other tissues examined. On the other hand, transcript of AhFAD2-2, AhFAD6 and AhSLD1 showed higher abundances in leaves. In addition, these five genes showed different expression patterns during seed development. These results indicated that the five genes may have different biochemical functions during vegetative growth and seed development.									55	13	1	0	47	0	70			0721-7714	1432-203X		WOS:000293795100003	21409552

They are members of a large multigenic family. Probably due to this high number of isoforms, and to a very heterogeneous regulation of their expression, plant peroxidases are involved in a broad range of physiological processes all along the plant life cycle. Due to two possible catalytic cycles, peroxidative and hydroxylic, peroxidases can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) ((OH)-O-center dot, HOO center dot), polymerise cell wall compounds, and regulate H2O2 levels. By modulating their activity and expression following internal and external stimuli, peroxidases are prevalent at every stage of plant growth, including the demands that the plant meets in stressful conditions. These multifunctional enzymes can build a rigid wall or produce ROS to make it more flexible; they can prevent biological and chemical attacks by raising physical barriers or by counterattacking with a large production of ROS; they can be involved in a more peaceful symbiosis. They are finally present from the first hours of a plant's life until its last moments. Although some functions look paradoxical, the whole process is probably regulated by a fine-tuning that has yet to be elucidated. This review will discuss the factors that can influence this delicate balance.									684	48	2	0	597	22	746			0721-7714	1432-203X		WOS:000230562000001	15856234

We begin this review by presenting the history of light emission studies, from the ancient times. Light emission from plants is of several kinds: prompt fluorescence (PF), delayed fluorescence (DF), thermoluminescence, and phosphorescence. In this article, we focus on PF and DF. Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements have been used for more than 80 years to study photosynthesis, particularly photosystem II (PSII) since 1961. This technique has become a regular trusted probe in agricultural and biological research. Many measured and calculated parameters are good biomarkers or indicators of plant tolerance to different abiotic and biotic stressors. This would never have been possible without the rapid development of new fluorometers. To date, most of these instruments are based mainly on two different operational principles for measuring variable chlorophyll a fluorescence: (1) a PF signal produced following a pulse-amplitude-modulated excitation and (2) a PF signal emitted during a strong continuous actinic excitation. In addition to fluorometers, other instruments have been developed to measure additional signals, such as DF, originating from PSII, and light-induced absorbance changes due to the photooxidation of P700, from PSI, measured as the absorption decrease (photobleaching) at about 705 nm, or increase at 820 nm. In this review, the technical and theoretical basis of newly developed instruments, allowing for simultaneous measurement of the PF and the DF as well as other parameters is discussed. Special emphasis has been given to a description of comparative measurements on PF and DF. However, DF has been discussed in greater details, since it is much less used and less known than PF, but has a great potential to provide useful qualitative new information on the back reactions of PSII electron transfer. A review concerning the history of fluorometers is also presented.									108	3	6	0	93	0	118			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000312132100001	23065335

However, the limited conversion efficiencies, operation lifetimes and CO2 utilization efficiencies of PEC devices currently prohibit their application beyond the laboratory scale. Here, a wireless device converting CO2 and water into carbon monoxide and hydrogen at a peak solar conversion efficiency exceeding 16% under an illumination intensity of 5 suns is demonstrated. A CO/H-2 product ratio between 10-20 is measured during a 17 h stability test. Fluctuations in device performance are rigorously analyzed via deconvolution of electrochemical and photoabsorber contributions. It is demonstrated that beneficial heat dissipation is enabled by wireless integration of the photoabsorber and electrocatalyst components, accounting for roughly 10% of the achieved conversion efficiency, an achievement unattainable with physically separated photoabsorber and electrolyzer components.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000779387800001

Herein, we tackle this bottleneck by fabricating a {110}/{001} facet junction to effectively facilitate the separation of charge carriers. In this study, two different BiOCl nanoplates (BiOCl-H1 and BiOCl-H2) with coexposed {110} and {001} facets were synthesized under different pH conditions. The ratio of these facets could be adjusted by the pH value of the precursor. It was discovered that the photocatalytic performance of the obtained sample for pollutant removal is dependent on the facet ratio of these facets. Theoretical calculation results show the difference in the electronic structure and staggered alignment of these facets, thus endowing BiOCl with the possibility to fabricate a facet junction. Based on our logical analyses, the Z-scheme charge-transfer mechanism was accordingly put forward. Our work opens a new avenue for the construction of a Z-scheme facet heterojunction to enhance charge separation.									39	2	0	0	7	0	40			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000551488400046	32551475	
J	Mourton, H; Gaignard, S; Saindrenan, G; Le Gall, R								Gas pore formation in tungsten arc weld in Cu-Ni 90-10 alloy								REVUE DE METALLURGIE-CAHIERS D INFORMATIONS TECHNIQUES				95	5			631	639		10.1051/metal/199895050631				MAY 1998	1998	Copper and nickel are soluble in each other in all proportions to give a range of cupro-nickels which are ductile and can be hot and cold worked. Copper base alloys are frequently used for heat exchanger plants and especially for seawater piping systems. F.c.c. alloys are easily used and all classical processes can be employed to weld these alloys if the residual elements content is low enough to avoid hot cracking. Control of metallurgical elaboration and development of suitable filler metal prevent from hot cracking in sensible alloys like Cu-Ni. Although, porosities are frequently found in these alloys. Origins of these defects are usually assigned to the dissolved gases in the melted metal during the welding. Yet, no direct experimental evidence has been shown.In this present work, the mechanisms of porosity formation in weld metal are reported. The welding process is the orbital tungsten inert gas (T.I.G.) on a cupro-nickel 90-10 pipe (external diameter = 14 mm, infernal diameter = I I mm). The alloy used in this study has a nominal composition of Cu 90 wt %, Ni 10 wt %, the main other element are Fe (1.6 wt %) and Mn (0.6 wt %). The iron addition increases corrosion resistance and the manganese addition traps free sulfur to form MnS precipitates. The filler wire is cupro-nickel 90-10 alloys (0.8 mm in diameter) enriched with titanium (0.39 wt %).This filler metal reduces the formation of porosity and possibility of oxygen embrittlement in either the melted metal or the heat affected zone (HAZ). No preheating, post heating or thermal treatment are needed. The shielding gase is mixed argon-helium (Inarc 6).Transversal sections of the welds were thoroughly cleaned, mechanically polished with abrasive paper from grade 400 to 4000 and finished with diamond paste 3 mu m, cleaned with acetone in an ultrasonic bath and then etched with ammonium persulfate at la % volume. Cross-section were examined with a standard optical microscope to localize porosity. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer is used to reveal the solidification substructures, to examine the surface morphology and for semi-quantitative microanalysis. Size and shape of each pore were analysed using a semi-quantitative image analysis system attached to the SEM.The research of gazeous emission during the metal melting was studied by coupled differential scanning calorimetry thermogravimetric analysis and mass spectrometry All these experiments were carried out under an argon controlled atmosphere.Metallographic observations exhibit three types of porosity. They can be classified then according to their size, localization in the bead, chemical composition around porosity and reactivity with chemical agents.First type of porosity has the biggest size. They are more than 50 mu m. They are neither especially spherical nor deep (< 25 pm) and have a rough cast intern surface. The composition of porosity surface is the same than the base material: copper, nickel and some iron and manganese. The porosities are found on the top of the melted metal and it seems that they evolve with time. These bubbles are formed by gas entrapment during solidification. Some emerging bubbles can be found. The bigger size can be explain by effect of hydrostatic pressure when bubble come to the surface.Second type has an intermediate size, Porosity diameters included between 2 and 50 mu m. The surface composition around these porosities is : copper and nickel, titanium, magnesium, aluminum and silicium which are associated with oxygene. These porosities are located along the weld metal. There is no natural evolution for these porosities. The zone around some porosities may present a sensitivity with the reagent used for the chemical attack. Actually we cannot explain the formation mecanism of these bubbles. However as pores are coated with elements which have a high affinity with oxygen, we think that the formation of pore may result of oxidizing reactions in the melting bath.Third type is the smaller. Their size is less than 2 mu m in diameter. These porosities are randomly distributed in the weld metal. A chemical analysis of their surfaces shows the presence of sulfur, titanium and magnesium in addition to copper and nickel. They do not seem to evolve with time. These pores are formed by a reaction beetween manganese sulfur (MnS) precipitates contained in base metal and magnesium and titanium of the filler metal in the melting bath. It's well known that TiS and MgS precipitates are more stable than MnS precipitate. So it is the sulfur vaporisation which result of the heat reaction which form porosities.									0	0	1	0	0	0	1			0035-1563			WOS:000075382200007

This paper combines theoretical and experimental methods to reveal mechanistic insights into the reactivity of the highly active molecular manganese vanadium oxide WOC [Mn4V4O17(OAc)(3)](3-) in aqueous acetonitrile solutions. Using density functional theory together with electrochemistry and IR-spectroscopy, we propose a sequential three-step activation mechanism including a one-electron oxidation of the catalyst from [Mn23+Mn24+] to [Mn3+Mn34+], acetate-to-water ligand exchange, and a second one-electron oxidation from [Mn3+Mn34+] to [Mn-4(4+)]. Analysis of several plausible ligand exchange pathways shows that nucleophilic attack of water molecules along the Jahn-Teller axis of the Mn3+ centers leads to significantly lower activation barriers compared with attack at Mn4+ centers. Deprotonation of one water ligand by the leaving acetate group leads to the formation of the activated species [Mn4V4O17(OAc)(2)(H2O)(OH)](-) featuring one H2O and one OH ligand. Redox potentials based on the computed intermediates are in excellent agreement with electrochemical measurements at various solvent compositions. This intricate interplay between redox chemistry and ligand exchange controls the formation of the catalytically active species. These results provide key reactivity information essential to further study bio-inspired molecular WOCs and solid-state manganese oxide catalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000693381800001	34745522

Increased computing power has radically transformed the way we make nowadays research. Today, it is possible to perform complex computational experiments with high quality and accuracy for model systems that are similar to those studied experimentally. This starts to be reality both considering sizes and timescales, and in many cases this is strictly true at the nanoscale. The global trend shows a significant increase in the interrelationship between groups of theoretical and experimental research. Addressing the problem from a combined perspective (theory, simulations, and experiments) is becoming a rule in high impact publications and although a lot is still to be done, this synergy shows huge advantages. This is so because this new perspective allows greater deepening in the understanding of the basic aspects of the systems at the atomic or molecular level.A comprehensive review on computer simulations applied to underpotential deposition (UPD) at the nanoscale, of interest for materials scientists, has been presented very recently [1(..)].Here, we discuss some challenging theoretical and computational achievements in systems of electrochemical interest at the nanoscale, providing a close correlation with experiments.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2451-9103			WOS:000424673700004

Spore inoculation experiments shown pathogenicity varies among different strains and mutants, however, the molecular mechanism of pathogenicity is unclear. We sequenced, assembled and annotated the transcriptomes of wild type (SPE1) and three mutants (SPE2, SPE3 and SPE4) with reduced pathogenicity that were constructed in our previous study. Illumina sequencing generated a total of 394,910,604 clean reads and de novo Trinity-based assembled into 12,989 unigenes, among these, 9,598 genes were successfully annotated to known proteins in UniProt database. A total of 172, 3,996, and 650 genes were up-regulated and 4,403, 2,845, and 3,016 genes were down-regulated between SPE2-SPE1, SPE3-SPE1, and SPE4-SPE1, respectively. Overall, several genes with a potential role in fungal pathogenicity were detected down-regulated in mutants including 100 hydrolytic enzymes, 117 transcriptional factors, and 47 cell wall related genes. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis reveals 216 genes involved in nine pathways were down-regulated in mutants compared to wild type. The down-regulation of more pathways involved in pathogenicity in SPE2 and SPE4 than SPE3 supports their lower pathogenicity during in-vitro bioassay experiment. Expression of 12 down-regulated genes in mutants was validated by quantitative real time PCR. This study provides valuable information on transcriptome variation caused by mutation for further functional validation of candidate pathogenicity genes in A. apis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000532437000034	32372055	
J	Li, Juan; Lou, Zaizhu; Li, Baojun								Nanostructured materials with localized surface plasmon resonance for photocatalysis								CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS				33	3			1154	1168		10.1016/j.cclet.2021.07.059				MAR 2022	2022	Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) enhanced photocatalysis has fascinated much interest and considerable efforts have been devoted toward the development of plasmonic photocatalysts. In the past decades, noble metal nanoparticles (Au and Ag) with LSPR feature have found wide applications in solar energy conversion. Numerous metal-based photocatalysts have been proposed including metal/semiconductor heterostructures and plasmonic bimetallic or multimetallic nanostructures. However, high cost and scarce reserve of noble metals largely limit their further practical use, which drives the focus gradually shift to low-cost and abundant nonmetallic nanostructures. Recently, various heavily doped semiconductors (such as WO3-x, MoO3-x, Cu2-xS, TiN) have emerged as potential alternatives to costly noble metals for efficient photocatalysis due to their strong LSPR property in visible-near infrared region. This review starts with a brief introduction to LSPR property and LSPR-enhanced photocatalysis, the following highlights recent advances of plasmonic photocatalysts from noble metal to semiconductor-based plasmonic nanostructures. Their synthesis methods and promising applicability in plasmon-driven photocatalytic reactions such as water splitting, CO2 reduction and pollution decomposition are also summarized in details. This review is expected to give guidelines for exploring more efficient plasmonic systems and provide a perspective on development of plasmonic photocatalysis.

The advantages and disadvantages of the three measuring techniques are demonstrated with specific examples.While STM measurements are ambiguous due to the changing conductance of the sample during the redox process, AFM measurements on soft films such as anodic iridium oxide (AIROF) may result in surface modifications. Intermittent contact AFM (ICAFM) appears to be best suited for most samples.Shrinking of up to 40% could be observed on nickel oxide films during oxidation, which depended upon the location on the sample investigated and on the measuring technique employed. For a polyaniline film with a reversible charge capacity of 4.3 mC/cm(2) corresponding to 75 +/- 7 nm film thickness, a thickness increase of 10 +/- 3 nm was observed during oxidation.					9th International Conference on Scanning Tunneling Microscopy/Spectroscopy and Related Techniques9th International Conference on Scanning Tunneling Microscopy/Spectroscopy and Related Techniques	JUL 20-25, 1997JUL 20-25, 1997	Free & Hanseat City Hamburg; German Min Educ Sci Res & Technol; German Sci Fdn; Commiss European Communities; Oxford Instruments GmbH; Omicron Vakuumphys GmbH; Topometrix GmbH; Digital InstrumentsFree & Hanseat City Hamburg; German Min Educ Sci Res & Technol; German Sci Fdn; Commiss European Communities; Oxford Instruments GmbH; Omicron Vakuumphys GmbH; Topometrix GmbH; Digital Instruments	HAMBURG, GERMANYHAMBURG, GERMANY	14	0	0	0	1	0	14			0947-8396			WOS:000076887000100

The distribution, species, and number of phases generated in the proximity of the V2O5/CaO interface were characterized by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) that was capable of selecting the scanning location. The results show that CaV(2)O(6)was quickly generated to become the matrix all over the V-rich layer at a relatively low temperature (1073 K to 1223 K); Ca(2)V(2)O(7)was then formed in the vicinity of the CaV2O6/CaO interface. The presence of Ca(2)V(2)O(7)near the CaV2O6/air interface was unexpected and indicated that the diffusion of oxygen from the air into the V-rich layer had promoted its formation. Upon increasing the annealing temperature, CaV(2)O(6)disappeared gradually at 1223 K, Ca(2)V(2)O(7)became the matrix at 1223 K, and Ca-3(VO4)(2)appeared near the Ca2V2O7/CaO interface at 1173 K. Average interdiffusion coefficients in Ca-3(VO4)(2)at 1173 K, 1223 K, and 1273 K were 1.66 x 10(-10), 3.45 x 10(-10), and 17.5 x 10(-10)cm(2) s(-1), respectively. The diffusion activation energy calculated using the Arrhenius equation was 290.15 +/- 32.29 kJ/mol. With increasing annealing time, the amount of the phases (Ca(2)V(2)O(7)at 1073 K to 1123 K and Ca-3(VO4)(2)at 1173 K to 1273 K) in the vicinity of the V-rich layer/CaO interface increased. At 1173 K, the diffusion thickness of Ca-3(VO4)(2)increased with increasing annealing time with a square root of time dependency, which suggested that the formation of Ca-3(VO4)(2)in the Ca(2)V(2)O(7)mixture was governed by the solid-solid diffusion process.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000560895000001

Herein, we developed a facile approach for the preparation of a porous cobalt oxide-carbon hybrid, which was prepared by carbonizing in an inert atmosphere and subsequently air-calcining nanocrystals of zeolite imidazole framework-67 (ZIF-67), and utilized as an efficient WOC. Using Ru(bpy)(3)(PF6)(3) as an oxidant, we got a record catalytic turnover number (TON) and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 910 + 21 and 14.6 + 0.4 s(-1) per cobalt atom, respectively. In addition, the synthesized catalyst can also act as an efficient electrochemical WOC, with a low OER overpotential of 0.36 V at 10.0 mA cm(-2) in a pH 13 medium. The superior catalyst performance can be attributed to the homogeneous dispersion of CoOx and in situ formed porous carbon, and the presence of nitrogen in the catalyst may also be attributed to its high catalytic activity.									47	3	0	0	3	0	47			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000368839200033

Sooting limit maps were determined in the fuel (X-F) and oxygen (X-O) mole fraction plane, separating sooting and non-sooting regions. The results showed that when DME is mixed to ethylene, the sooting region was appreciably shrank, especially in the cases of soot formation/oxidation (SFO) flames as compared with the cases of soot formation (SF) flames. This indicated an inhibiting role of DME on sooting. An interesting observation was that the critical X-O required for sooting initially decreased and then increased with the DME mixing ratio to ethylene beta for the cases of SF flames, exhibiting a non-monotonic behavior. This implied a promoting role of DME on sooting when small amount of DME is mixed to ethylene. As the pressure increased, the sooting region generally expanded. Specifically, the range of beta in promoting soot formation extended with pressure. This implies that a strategy in reducing soot by adding DME to ethylene at high pressures required a large amount of DME addition. To interpret the observed phenomena, kinetic simulations including reaction pathway and sensitivity analyses were conducted with the opposed-flow flames model using the KAUST-Aramco PAH Mech. The results showed that the thermal effect of DME addition on sooting tendency monotonically decreases with beta. The chemical effect was found to be the main contributor to the DME addition effect on sooting tendency, resulting in the non-monotonic sooting limt behavior.

This is the first example of a Ni and Mo2C nanocomposite derived from a bimetallic MOF that demonstrates excellent electrocatalytic activity and remarkable durability as long as 10 h under acidic and basic conditions. The overpotentials are 169 mV and 181 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The favorable performance can be ascribed to the synergistic effect between Mo2C and Ni as well as the homogeneous distribution, graphene coating and mesoporous structure which is in favor of the charge transfer in the HER. This work may provide some guidelines for fabricating nanostructured hybrids composed of versatile transition metal carbides and graphene with high performance and stability in different media based on designed MOFs.									66	1	0	0	2	0	66			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000396146900029

A two electrode system composed of two similarly prepared lead electrodes was employed. A constant current was applied between two electrodes for a short time, followed by I relaxation period. A dark oxidation film of Suitable stability and homogeneity was formed oil the anode electrode. Different parameters including Pulse height, pulse time (t(on)) and relaxation time (t(off)) were optimized. A change in morphology of lead dioxide from globular to nanofibriliar wits observed when the Pulse time and relaxation tinic varied from 0.01 to 10 and 0.1 to 5s, respectively, at a pulse height of 25 mA cm(-2). A variation in pulse height, Caused a variation in diameter and length of nanofibers formed at a pulsed time of 0.1 s and relaxation time of 5 s. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that lead dioxide particles obtained under these conditions have nanofibriliar morphology with an average diameter in the range between 20 and 50 nm and length of 500-1000 nm.

The ordered arrangement of respective cations of Sn and (0.94Ta + 0.06Sn) in the precursor Sn-1.64(IV)(Ta1.88Sn0.12IV)O-6.58 was left in the phases.

O-2 concentrations have likely fluctuated (between 10(-3) and 1.5 times the present atmospheric level) since the GOE similar to 2.4 Gyr ago, resulting in a time-varying ozone (O-3) layer. Using a three-dimensional chemistry-climate model, we simulate changes in O-3 in Earth's atmosphere since the GOE and consider the implications for surface habitability, and glaciation during the Mesoproterozoic. We find lower O-3 columns (reduced by up to 4.68 times for a given O-2 level) compared to previous work; hence, higher fluxes of biologically harmful UV radiation would have reached the surface. Reduced O-3 leads to enhanced tropospheric production of the hydroxyl radical (OH) which then substantially reduces the lifetime of methane (CH4). We show that a CH4 supported greenhouse effect during the Mesoproterozoic is highly unlikely. The reduced O-3 columns we simulate have important implications for astrobiological and terrestrial habitability, demonstrating the relevance of three-dimensional chemistry-climate simulations when assessing paleoclimates and the habitability of faraway worlds.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2054-5703			WOS:000738566000008	35070343

The surface 2,2 '-bipyridine groups can function as chelating ligands for the formation of metal complexes, thus generating molecularly-defined catalytic sites that are exposed on the surface of the material. We here report the construction of a heterogeneous water oxidation photocatalyst by immobilizing several types of tris(2,2 '-bipyridine)ruthenium complexes on BPy-PMO where they function as photosensitizers in conjunction with iridium oxide as a catalyst. The Ru complexes produced on BPy-PMO in this work were composed of three bipyridine ligands, including the BPy in the PMO framework and two X(2)bpy, denoted herein as Ru(X)-BPy-PMO where X is H (2,2 '-bipyridine), Me (4,4 '-dimethyl-2,2 '-bipyridine), t-Bu(4,4 '-di-tert-butyl-2,2 '-bipyridine) or CO2Me (4,4 '-dimethoxycarbonyl-2,2 '-bipyridine). Efficient photocatalytic water oxidation was achieved by tuning the photochemical properties of the Ru complexes on the BPy-PMO through the incorporation of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing functionalities. The reaction turnover number based on the amount of the Ru complex was improved to 20, which is higher than values previously obtained from PMO systems acting as water oxidation photocatalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2046-2069		WOS:000528043700005	35498487

ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PHYSIKALISCHE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY & CHEMICAL PHYSICS				234	6	SI		1133	1153		10.1515/zpch-2019-1432				2020	2020	We present an alternative synthesis strategy for developing nanocrystalline (Ga1-xZnx)(N1-xOx) semiconductors known to be very efficient photoabsorbers. In a first step we produce mixtures of highly crystalline beta-Ga2O3 and wurtzite-type ZnO nanoparticles by chemical vapor synthesis. (Ga1-xZnx)(N1-xOx) nanoparticles of wurtzite structure are then formed by reaction of these precursor materials with ammonia. Microstructure as well as composition (zinc loss) changes with nitridation time: band gap energy, crystallite size and crystallinity increase, while defect density decreases with increasing nitridation time. Crystallite growth results in a corresponding decrease in specific surface area. In the UV regime photocatalytic activity for overall water splitting can be monitored for samples both before and after nitridation. We find a significantly lower photocatalytic activity in the nitrided samples, even though the crystallinity is significantly higher and the defect density is significantly lower after nitridation. Both properties should have led to a lower probability for charge carrier recombination, and, consequently, to a higher photocatalytic activity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0942-9352			WOS:000542554000005

In this article, magnetic core shells were fabricated with Co nanoparticles (NPs) as cores and g-C3N4 as shells. In the fabrication process, the Co@g-C3N4 core shells were anchored onto the rGO nanosheets to form a Co@g-C3N4-rGO composite (CNG-I). For hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of NaBH4 or NH3BH3, the Co NP cores act as catalytic active sites. The g-C3N4 shells protect Co NPs cores from aggregating or growing. The connection between Co NPs and rGO was strengthened by the g-C3N4 shells to prevent them from leaching or flowing away. The g-C3N4 shells also work as a cocatalyst for hydrogen generation. The magnetism of Co NPs and the shape of rGO nanosheets achieve effective momentum transfer in the external magnetic field. In the batch reactor, a higher catalytic activity was obtained for CNG-I in self-stirring mode than in magneton stirring mode. In the continuous-flow process, stable hydrogen generation was carried out with CNG-I being fixed and propelled by the external magnetic field. The separation film is unnecessary because of magnetic momentum transfer. This idea of the composite design and magnetic momentum transfer will be useful for the development of both hydrogen generation and multifunctional composite materials.									56	5	0	0	7	0	59			0743-7463			WOS:000378973300007	27276187

The studied catalysts consist of maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and manganese ferrite (MnFe2O4) nanoparticles as cores coated in situ with birnessite-type manganese oxide shells and were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermal, chemical, and surface analyses, and magnetic measurements. The particles were found to be of nearly spherical core-shell architectures with average diameter of 150 nm. Water oxidation catalysis was examined using Ce4+ as the sacrificial oxidant. All core-shell particles were found to be active water oxidation catalysts. However, the activity was found to depend on a variety of factors like the type of iron oxide core, the structure and composition of the shell, the coating characteristics, and the surface properties. Catalysts containing magnetite and manganese ferrite as core materials displayed higher catalytic activities per manganese ion (2650 or 3150 mmolO(2) mol(Mn)(-1) h(-1)) or per mass than nanoiron oxides (no activity) or birnessite alone (1850 mmolO(2) mol(Mn)(-1) h(-1)). This indicates synergistic effects between the MnOx shell and the FeOx core of the composites and proves the potential of the presented core-shell approach for further catalyst optimization. Additionally, the FeOx cores of the particles allow magnetic recovery of the catalyst and might also be beneficial for applications in water-oxidizing anodes because the incorporation of iron might enhance the overall conductivity of the material.									42	1	0	0	4	0	44			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000351325200027	25710557	
J	Terwilliger, NB; Ryan, MC								Functional and phylogenetic analyses of phenoloxidases from brachyuran (Cancer magister) and branchiopod (Artemia franciscana, Triops longicaudatus) crustaceans								BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN				210	1			38	50		10.2307/4134535				FEB 2006	2006	Arthropod phenoloxidases catalyze the melanization and sclerotization of the new postmolt exoskeleton, and they function in the immune response. Hemocyanin, phylogenetically related to phenoloxidase, can function as a phenoloxidase under certain conditions. We investigated the relative contributions of hemocyte phenoloxidase and hemocyanin in the brachyuran crab Cancer magister, using the physiological ratio at which they occur in the hemolymph, and found that hemocyte phenoloxidase has higher activity. They both convert diphenols to o-quinones, but only the hemocyte phenoloxidase is able to catalyze the conversion of monophenols to diphenols. The quaternary structure of hemocyanin affects its reactivity as phenoloxidase. We suggest that prophenoloxidase is released from hemocytes and moves across epidermis into new exoskeleton during premolt and is activated in early postmolt. In addition to functional studies, we have determined the complete cDNA sequence of C. magister hemocyte prophenoloxidase and partial sequences from the branchiopods Artemia franciscana and Triops longicaudatus. We also sequenced C. magister cryptocyanin 2 and a hemocyanin from the amphipod Cyamus scammoni and used these and other members of the arthropod hemocyanin superfamily for phylogenetic analyses. The phylogenies presented here are consistent with the possibility that a common ancestral molecule had both phenoloxidase and reversible oxygen-binding capabilities.									67	1	1	0	67	0	72			0006-3185	1939-8697		WOS:000235919000005	16501063

The physiological roles of most hemoglobins remain elusive. Here, we show that a 2-on-2 ("truncated") hemoglobin, termed THB8, is required for hypoxic growth and the expression of anaerobic genes in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. THB8 is 1 of 12 2-on-2 hemoglobins in this species. It belongs to a subclass within the 2-on-2 hemoglobin class I family whose members feature a remarkable variety of domain arrangements and lengths. Posttranscriptional silencing of the THB8 gene results in the mis-regulation of several genes and a growth defect under hypoxic conditions. The latter is intensified in the presence of an NO scavenger, which also impairs growth of wild-type cells. As recombinant THB8 furthermore reacts with NO, the results of this study indicate that THB8 is part of an NO-dependent signaling pathway.									47	0	0	0	47	0	50			0027-8424			WOS:000321503700085	23754374

The platinum based electrocatalyst are the state of art material for hydrogen generation but their scarcity limit their wide implementation. Therefore, non-noble electrocatalyst gains immerse attention to meet the demand of H-2 generation.

Cobalt oxalate precursor has been synthesized via micellar route at room temperature. The as-prepared Co2P4O12 has been deposited on graphite sheet and used as a working electrode for HER. In comparison with Pt/C (eta(20) = 54 mV), nanosheets of Co2P4O12 requires 118 mV overpotential to achieve 20 mA/cm(2) current density in 0.5 M H2SO4 and almost same current was retained even at 24 h stability study at -0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0921-5107	1873-4944		WOS:000615944400006

Electrodeposition parameters including current and total number of cycles were investigated to achieve the IrO2 inverse-opal electrode. The inverse-opal MEA with ultra-low loading exhibited outstanding performance that exceeded or was comparable to that obtained in other PEMWE studies. Additionally, it exhibited higher performance and lower ohmic and charge-transfer resistance when compared with that of commercial IrO2. Furthermore, the performance corresponded to the highest mass activity reported to date since the loading in the inverse-opal MEA was ultra-low. This was because the inverse-opal structure improved electron transfer owing to the interconnected pores and increased the surface area due to high porosity, thereby leading to the enhanced utilization of the catalyst.									42	1	0	0	0	0	42			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000461433600020

Unfortunately,conventional water treatment can no longer achieve satisfactory performance. The emerging technology of electro- catalytic oxidation mainly utilize hydroxyl radicals to degrade pollutant,showing the advantages of strong oxidation ability,no need to add chemical agents,no secondary pollution,simple operation of electro-catalytic oxidation process,and mild treatment condition,which exhibits great potential in treatment of refractory wastewater. Anode plays a dominant role in electro-catalytic oxidation technology,accordingly,anode materials have become the focus of research in this area. Generally,anode materials are required to have high oxygen evolution potential,high electro- catalytic activity,corrosion resistance,favorable stability and low price. Currently,the commonly used anode materials are Ti-based mental oxide anode and boron doped diamond. Whereas,these materials suffer from short service life and high production cost. Fortunately,the above problems can be avoided by preparing composite metal oxide anode through modification. Common modification methods include doping mental ion,introducing interlayer,doping nanoparticle,controlling the micromorphology of electrode materials. The modification contributes to improving the electro-catalytic activity,conductivity,stability of anode materials,increasing the reaction area of the electrode and prolong the electrode life. As a result,the preparation of composite metal oxide anode has been pay more attention in anode materials research. A three-dimensional electrode system can be constructed by introducing a particle electrode on the basis of two-dimensional electrode system. Because particle electrode is polarized in electric field to form a micro-electrolytic cell,thus increase the effective reaction area,the three-dimensional electrode system presents larger surface ratio,higher electro-catalytic efficiency and lower energy consumption compared two-dimensional electrode system. Therefore,the development of high catalytic activity and high stability particle electrode has become a new research direction in the field of electro-catalytic oxidation. At present,The widely used particle electrodes include carbon materials (activated carbon,carbon aerogels, etc.),metal oxides (Al_2O_3,Fe_3O_4,etc.),ceramics and minerals. Based on the mechanism of electro-catalytic oxidation and the working principle of three dimensional electrodes,the electrode materials widely applied in electro-catalytic oxidation treatment of wastewater,including titanium based metal oxide anodes,and thin layer boron doped diamond electrodes are reviewed in this paper. The particle electrode used in the three-dimensional electrode system is emphatically introduced. Finally,the challenges and possible improvement of electrode material for their future application are proposed. It is worth mentioning that improving efficiency of electro-catalytic oxidation technology requires not only the improvement of electrode materials but also the optimization of reactor configuration, coupling with other technologies,thereby achieving extensive application of electro-catalytic oxidation technology.			随着石油化工、医药等工业的迅速发展,工业废水中难降解物质与日俱增,采用传统的水处理方法已难以达到环保要求。电催化氧化技术主要利用电极表面产生的活性物质羟基自由基进行氧化降解,具有氧化能力强、无需添加化学药剂、无二次污染的优势,而且电催化氧化工艺操作简单、处理条件温和,在处理难降解废水方面具有诸多优势。电催化氧化技术的核心部件是阳极,因此阳极材料的开发一直是研究人员关注的重点。一般要求阳极材料具有析氧电位高、电催化活性高、耐腐蚀、稳定性好、价格低廉等特点。目前常用的阳极材料有钛基金属氧化物阳极(SnO_2电极和PbO_2电极)和合成掺硼金刚石薄层电极,但是这些材料存在使用寿命短、制作成本高等问题。通过改性制备复合金属氧化物阳极可以改善上述问题,常用的改性方法包括掺杂离子、引入中间层、掺杂纳米颗粒、调控电极材料的微观形貌等。改性可以提高电极电催化性能、导电性及稳定性,增大电极的反应面积,延长电极寿命。因此复合金属氧化物阳极的制备是阳极材料研究的重点。在二维电极的基础上引入粒子电极可以构成三维电极系统。在三维电极系统中,粒子电极在电场作用下,会极化形成一个个微型电解槽,极大地增加了反应面积。因而三维电极相比于二维电极具有面体比大、电催化效率更高、能耗更低的优势,因此高催化活性、高稳定性的粒子电极的研制成为了电催化氧化技术领域新的研究方向。目前,常用的粒子电极材料主要有碳材料(活性炭、炭气凝胶等)、金属氧化物(Al_2O_3、Fe_3O_4等)、陶瓷和矿物类等。本文从电催化氧化的机理以及三维电极的工作原理出发,综述了在电催化氧化处理废水中广泛应用的电极材料,包括钛基金属氧化物阳极、合成掺硼金刚石薄层电极,重点介绍了在三维电极系统中使用的粒子电极。并对今后废水处理中电催化氧化电极材料的研究趋势进行了展望,指出提高电催化氧化效率不仅需改进电极材料,还需改善反应器构型及与其他工艺的耦合等,以实现电催化氧化技术的推广应用。						1	9	0	0	0	0	9			1005-023X			CSCD:6494072

Hot-wire CVD polysilicon films for thin film devices								Amorphous and Microcrystalline Silicon Technology - 1998. Symposium								879	90						1999	1999	A solar cell using profiled poly-Si:H by HWCVD as the i-layer in the configuration SS/n-muc-Si:H(PECVD)/i-poly-Si:H(HWCVD)/p-muc-Si:H(PECVD)/ITO showed 3.7% efficiency. A current of 23.6 mA/cm2 was generated in only 1.5 mum thick poly-Si:H i-layer grown at ~5 Aring/s. TFTs made with the poly-Si:H films (grown at ges9 Aring/s) exhibited remarkable stability to long duration of 23 hours of gate bias stress of ~1 MV/cm. A saturation mobility of 1.5 cm2/Vs for the TFT has been achieved. Films made at low hydrogen dilution (Poly2) showed device quality (purely intrinsic nature, ambipolar diffusion length of 568 nm, only (220) oriented growth and low ESR defect density of <1017/cm3 with complete absence of signal due to conduction electrons) but with an incubation phase of amorphous initial growth, when the films made at high hydrogen dilution (Poly1) had a polycrystalline initial growth, though with higher defect density, incorporated oxygen and randomly oriented grains. Poly2 films are compact and hydrogen bonding is at compact Si-H sites manifested as 2000 cm-1 IR vibration and high temperature hydrogen evolution peak. Exchange interaction of spins and spin pairing are observed while increasing defects in such a compact structure. A new approach has been used to integrate these two regimes of growth to make profiled poly-Si:H layers. The new layers show good electronic properties as well as complete elimination of the incubation phase.					Amorphous and Microcrystalline Silicon Technology - 1998.

(Y-Z(.)) in Tris-treated Photosystem II particles were measured by time-resolved EPR at different pH values (pH 5.5 to 7.5) between 230 and 297 K. Y-Z(.) induced by laser flashes decayed in a biphasic way; t(1/2) values were about 100 ms in the fast phase and about 1 s in the slow one, respectively, at room temperature. The fast phase was attributed to a recombination of charges on Y-Z(.) and Q(A)(-). The activation energies for the reaction of Y-Z(.) with Q(A)(-) between 245 and 297 K have been estimated to be more than 38 kJ mol(-1) at pH (>6.5) and less than 32 kJ mol(-1) at pH (<6.0), respectively. The activation energy gap between high pH (>6.5) and low pH (<6.0) ranges was found to be Delta E = 4.4 kJ mol(-1). Judging from the fact that pH 6.2 appears to be the border between the high and low pH regions, we suggest that the kinetics of Y-Z(.) is strongly influenced by the dissociation of the nearby histidine residue.									17	0	0	0	14	0	17			0032-0781			WOS:A1997XW98200003

Hitherto, screening bifunction catalysts relies on experimental trials of high-performance cells and theoretical calculations of free-energy changes in the HER/OER intermediate steps, with high costs and constraints. Herein, we derive from the inevitable electrode-surface oxidation in water electrolysis and the semiconductor physics of such an oxidized electrode surface a band-diagram perspective: the oxidized electrode surface governing the catalytic activities in a bifunctional water-electrolysis cell should be a semiconductor with an effective bandgap not much larger than the HER-OER electrochemical potential gap of 1.23 eV. This perspective and its applications are elaborated with a set of experimental and DFT-computational results with FeP as a nominal bifunctional catalyst on nickel electrodes for the construction of a high-performance cell exhibiting 10 mA cm(-2)at 1.40 V. The proposed "bandgap screening" is easy, low-cost, and applicable for expediting the development of new bifunctional catalysts.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000575366700026

Evidence is increasingly showing that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) can partly protect cells from A beta-mediated neurotoxicity by inhibiting A beta aggregation. In order to better understand the process of A beta aggregation and amyloid fibril disaggregation and reduce the cytotoxicity of EGCG at high doses, we attached EGCG onto the surface of selenium nanoparticles (EGCG@Se). Given the low delivery efficiency of EGCG@Se to the targeted cells and the involvement of selenoprotein in antioxidation and neuroprotection, which are the key factors for preventing the onset and progression of AD, we synthesized EGCG-stabilized selenium nanoparticles coated with Tet-1 peptide (Tet-1-EGCG@Se, a synthetic selenoprotein analogue), considering the affinity of Tet-1 peptide to neurons. We revealed that Tet-1-EGCG@Se can effectively inhibit A beta fibrillation and disaggregate preformed A beta fibrils into nontoxic aggregates. In addition, we found that both EGCG@Se and Tet-1-EGCG@Se can label A beta fibrils with a high affinity, and Tet-1 peptides can significantly enhance the cellular uptake of Tet-1-EGCG@Se in PC12 cells rather than in NIH/3T3 cells.									151	4	0	0	68	0	155			1944-8244			WOS:000337336900063	24758520

TL measurements were taken from wild-type and chlorina f2 barley leaves which had been dark-adapted or exposed to 20 min illumination of varying irradiance or given varying periods of recovery following strong irradiance. We have found strong evidence that there is a sustained trans-thylakoid Delta pH in leaves following illumination, and that this Delta pH gives rise to quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence which has previously been identified as a slowly-relaxing component of antenna-related protective energy dissipation; we have identified a state of the PS II reaction centre resulting from high light treatments which is apparently able to perform normal charge separation and electron transport but which is 'non-photochemically' quenched, in that the application of a light pulse of high irradiance cannot cause the formation of a high fluorescent state; and we have provided evidence that a transient state of the PS II reaction centre is formed during recovery from such high light treatments, in which electron transport from Q(A) to Q(B) is apparently impaired.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0166-8595			WOS:000071786300002

However, typical doping methods such as magnetic agitation and mechanical stirring may lead to a bad dispersion and thus poor reproducibility for electrocatalysis. Here, we proposed a strategy guided by the Murray's law to obtain hierarchically porous and highly graphitic carbons by cultivating rose flower in Ni(NO3)(2) solution and pyrolyzing Ni-doped rose petals. The efficient Murray's network in the rose petals promotes uniform and sufficient transfer and absorption of Ni2+ ions, which later serve as catalyst sites for highly graphitic carbons at high temperature. Because of the enhanced crystallinity of carbon that promotes the smooth transfer of electrons and the uniformly embedded Ni nanoparticles in the carbon matrix that serve as electrocatalytic active sites, the as-obtained carbons show superior performance as a bi-functional electrocatalyst for efficient overall water splitting.

The unique properties of RuO2 such as high transparency, high conductance, high catalytic activity, and high work function make this material an excellent candidate for a Schottky contact of MIS photoanodes for water splitting. In contrast to the Ni-based MIS structure, no Fermi level pinning was observed when RuO2 was used. This allowed achieving a high measured photovoltage of 0.46 V compared to 0.3 V for a Ni based structure. The ability to achieve the high photovoltage by utilization of RuO2 catalyst is an important achievement for fabrication of high performing MIS structures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To reveal the fundamental properties of this interface, we have studied co-adsorption of possible species at the HCIO4/Pt(111) interface using density functional theory (DFT). Our calculations demonstrate that HClO4* is most likely to dissociate into CIO4* on Pt(111) surface, leading to an adlayer of ClO4* co-adsorbed with H3O* and H2O* molecules. Interestingly, these co-adsorbed H3O* molecules exhibit the nature of hydronium ions with highly localized positive charge states. On the other hand, the stability of this ClO4* co-adsorbed adlayer is almost equal to that of a H2O* + H3O* bilayer. This competition would prohibit the formation of periodic CIO4* + H2O* + H3O* adlayer on Pt(111), yielding a weak adsorption of CIO4* in electrochemical condition as the experiments found. In addition, the electrostatic potential along the direction that is perpendicular to the substrate exhibits clearly distinguishable peaks for the different interfacial structures. These results provide deep insights into this fundamental electrochemical interface and offer promising clues for future experimental studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Filtration efficiency (FE) and pressure drop (PD), as a function of loading time, were studied on a DPF for a range of biodiesel fuels with varying fuel molecular oxygen content from 0% (diesel) to 14%. The change in the oxygen content of the fuel resulted in diesel particle matter (DPM) with significantly different physical properties. FE and PD were investigated during the deep bed filtration stage, chosen because it presents the start of the loading process, which is a crucial step for high performance filtration. Firstly, we investigated the influence of the size distribution of various particles on the deep bed filtration, wherein size distributions of PM were measured before and after the DPF. The results show that for all fuels the FE is higher for smaller particles, as diffusion is the dominant process governing the filtration in tested conditions. Further we found that FE for biodiesel particles were up to 10% lower than for diesel particles at the beginning of the loading process, but with that difference diminishing as the filter fully loads. This result is attributed to the increase in the particulate fractal dimension with a higher biodiesel fraction resulting in more compact particles with lower diffusion coefficients. In addition, the study also demonstrated that the change of FE during the loading process is dependent on the physical properties of DPM. DPF performs differently for biodiesel soot as compared to diesel soot, with biodiesel soot causing higher PD for the same mass of the soot loaded on the DPF. This effect was attributed to the smaller primary particulate size of the biodiesel particles. The results presented in this study will further facilitate understanding of the filtration processes of particulate matter and validate detailed filtration models for the prediction of the filtration efficiency (FE) and pressure drop (PD) depending on the particle morphological properties.									26	3	0	0	4	0	27			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000463823800008

The main function of this enzyme is to dismutase the toxic superoxide anion (O-2(-)) into less toxic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and oxygen (02). Structural analysis of mullet MnSOD (MuMnSOD) was performed using different bioinformatics tools. Pairwise alignment revealed that the protein sequence matched to that derived from Larimichthys crocea with a 95.2% sequence identity. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the MuMnSOD was included in the category of teleosts. Multiple sequence alignment showed that a SOD Fe-N domain, SOD Fe-C domain, and Mn/Fe SOD signature were highly conserved among the other examined MnSOD orthologs. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that the highest MuMnSOD mRNA expression level was in blood cells. The highest expression level of MuMnSOD was observed in response to treatment with both Lactococcus garvieae and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 6 h post treatment in the head kidney and blood. Potential ROS-scavenging ability of the purified recombinant protein (rMuMnSOD) was examined by the xanthine oxidase assay (XOD assay). The optimum temperature and pH for XOD activity were found to be 25 degrees C and pH 7, respectively. Relative XOD activity was significantly increased with the dose of rMuMnSOD, revealing its dose dependency. Activity of rMuMnSOD was inhibited by potassium cyanide (KCN) and N-N'-diethyl-dithiocarbamate (DDC). Moreover, expression of MuMnSOD resulted in considerable growth retardation of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Results of the current study suggest that MuMnSOD acts as an antioxidant enzyme and participates in the immune response in mullet.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000457666800009	30266606

Given temperature constraints of mineral formation, we calculate delta D values of mineralizing fluids as similar to-63 to 96 parts per thousand, which fall within the range of delta D values of Cretaceous-Paleogene surface waters in the region. The potential infiltration and presence of surface fluids at depths of several kilometers during deformation implies that pore spaces and fractures acted as conduits for surface water. Uplift of thrust sheets generated topography that favored meteoric recharge and flow of fluids into margins of the foreland basin, which were subsequently incorporated into the propagating thrust wedge. This is in contrast to the hypothesis that the release of overpressured metamorphic fluids dominates during fold-thrust belt evolution. As a result of shortening and tectonic uplift, fluid flows through basin sediments toward the foreland basin as meteoric waters recharge sediments at the basin margins. This study shows that stable isotopic compositions of shallow, deformation-related clay minerals are robust and may be used alongside other surface fluid proxies to probe the origin and composition of ancient fluids in orogenic systems.

In this study, novel CoxMo1-xS was effectively deposited on the surface of Zn0.5Cd0.5S semiconductors as an efficient promotor using in-situ hydrothermal process. The as-prepared CoxMo1-xS-Zn0.5Cd0.5S composites are examined by the following techniques: XRD, TEM, DRS, XPS, PL and TRPL. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance under visible illumination over Zn0.5Cd0.5S is remarkably increased by adding cheap CoxMo1-xS as promotor. The CoxMo1-xS-Zn0.5Cd0.5S hybrid specimen with 10% molar amount illustrates the best catalytic performance with a homologous hydrogen generation rate of 188.65 mu mol h(-1), which is estimated to be 14.5 folds than that of unmodified Zn0.5Cd0.5S specimen in the presence of visible light. The apparent quantum yield of Co0.3Mo0.7-Zn0.5Cd0.5S sample is determined to be 16.72% at monochromatic light of 420 nm. The experimental outcomes indicate that the synergistic action between CoxMo1-xS and Zn0.5Cd0.5S obviously promotes transfer of photo-induced charge carriers in the hybrid sample. A reasonable catalytic mechanism for the increased photocatalytic performance of CoxMo1-xS promotor was presented and authenticated by TRPL measure, which would present a new notion for the design of ideal semiconductors with plummy photocatalytic capability.

In this work, we proposed a template reactive strategy toward the synthesis of band-gap tunable 2D (GaN)(1-x)(ZnO)(x) nanosheets as thin as 14 nm to reduce the carrier transportation path and thus efficiently decrease the recombination of electrons and holes. It is demonstrated that the template strategy enables an ideal morphology and structure transformation from hexagonal 2D ZnGa2O4 nanosheets to 2D (GaN)(1-x)(ZnO)(x) nanosheets in the nitridation process. After the modification of 1 wt % of Rh cocatalyst, the flowerlike (GaN)(0.89)(ZnO)(0.11) nanosheets show an enhanced hydrogen evolution in pure water (pH 4.5).									27	4	0	0	0	0	27			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000515214300079	31945289

In addition to standard secondary production of BeB, it is necessary to introduce a production mechanism which is independent of the interstellar metallicity (primary). and in which freshly synthesized C, O and He are accelerated by supernova shock waves. Primary mechanisms are expected to he dominant at low metallicity. At metallicities higher than [O/H] greater than or similar to -1.75, some existing data indicate that secondary production is dominant. In this paper, we focus on the secondary process, related to the standard Galactic cosmic rays, and we examine the cosmic ray energy requirements for both present and past epochs. We find the power input to maintain the present-day Galactic cosmic ray flux is about 1.5 10(41) erg/s = 5 10(50) erg/century; this estimate includes energy losses from both the escape of high-energy particle and ionization losses from low-energy particles. This implies that, if supernovae are the sites of cosmic ray acceleration, the fraction of explosion energy going to accelerated particles is about similar to 30%. a value which we obtain consistently both from considering the present cosmic ray flux and confinement and from the present Be-9 and Li-6 abundances. Using the abundances of Be-9 (and Li-6) in metal-poor halo stars, we extend the analysis to show the effect of the interstellar gas mass on the standard Galactic cosmic ray energetic constraints on models of Li: Be, and B evolution. The efficiency of the beryllium production per erg may he enhanced in the past by a factor of about 10; thus the energetic requirement by itself cannot be used to rule out a secondary origin of light elements. Only a clear and indisputable observational determination of the O-Fe relation in the halo will discriminate between the two processes.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000168611400034		
J	Katoh, H; Ikeuchi, M								Targeted disruption of psbX and biochemical characterization of photosystem II complex in the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus								PLANT AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY				42	2			179	188		10.1093/pcp/pce024				FEB 2001	2001	PSII-X is a small hydrophobic protein, which is universally present in photosystem II (PSII) core complex among cyanobacteria and plants. The role of PSII-X was studied by directed mutagenesis and biochemical analysis in the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, The psbX-disrupted mutant could grow photoautotrophically indicative of non-essential function, while it showed growth defect under low CO2 conditions. An active O-2- evolving PSII complex was successfully isolated from the mutant and wild type, Protein composition of the isolated PSII complex was the same as wild type except for the absence of PSII-X, O-2 evolution supported by artificial quinones was affected in the psbX-disrupted mutant. At high concentration of 2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone or 2,6-dimethylbenzoquinone, the mutant showed much lower activity than wild type, while not much difference was found at low concentration. These results imply that binding or turnover of quinones at the Q(B) site depends, at least in part, on PSII-X protein in the PSII complex. Gel filtration chromatography of the PSII complex revealed that the dimeric structure of the complex was not greatly affected in the psbX-disrupted mutant.									25	0	0	0	22	0	26			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000167227000010	11230572

Herein, the identification of intrinsic electronic sensitivity for direct propene epoxidation was first achieved over highly stable Au/wormhole-like TS-1 catalyst. Results show that the electron transfer of Au species can be regulated by manipulating the dynamic evolutions and contents of Au valence states, thus resulting in different catalytic performance in 100 h time-on-stream. By DFT calculations, kinetic analysis and multicharacterizations, it is found that the Au-0 species with higher electronic population can easily transfer more electrons to activate surface O-2 compared with Au1+ and Au3+ species. Moreover, there is a positive correlation between Au-0 content and activity. Based on this correlation, a facile strategy is further proposed to boost Au-0 percentage, resulting in the reported highest PO formation rate without adding promoters. This work harbors tremendous guiding significance to the design of highly efficient Au/Ti-containing catalyst for propene epoxidation with H-2 and O-2.

Essential to the development of such models is the ability to describe the growth and metabolism of small numbers of individual microorganisms. In this context, the key objective of the research described in this article was to further develop an individual-based soil organic matter (SOM) model, INDISIM-SOM, first proposed a few years ago, and to assess its performance with a broader data set than previously considered. The INDISIM-SOM models the dynamics and evolution of C and N associated with organic matter in soils. The model involves a number of state variables and parameters related to SOM and microbial activity, including growth and decay of microbial biomass, temporal evolution of mineralized intermediate C and N, mineral N in ammonium and nitrate, carbon dioxide, and O-2. Simulation results demonstrate good fit of the model to experimental data from laboratory incubation experiments performed on three different types of Mediterranean soils. A second objective was to determine the sensitivity of the model toward its various parameters. Sensitivity was small for several of the parameters, suggesting possible simplifications of the model for specific uses, but was significant particularly for the parameter associated with the fraction of the soil C present in the biomass. These results suggest that research should be focused on improving the measurement of this latter parameter.									17	0	0	0	16	0	17			0038-075X	1538-9243		WOS:000280676100001

The pathogenesis of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) is not completely understood yet, partially because disease evolution depends on complex host-parasite interactions. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine that promotes numerous pathophysiological processes. In the current study, we investigated the link between MIF and CCC progression. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated MIF overexpression in the hearts from chronically T. cruzi-infected mice, particularly those showing intense inflammatory infiltration. We also found that MIF exogenously added to parasite-infected murine macrophage cultures is capable of enhancing the production of TNF-alpha and reactive oxygen species, both with pathogenic roles in CCC. Thus, the integrated action of MIF and other cytokines and chemokines may account for leukocyte influx to the infected myocardium, accompanied by enhanced local production of multiple inflammatory mediators. We further examined by ELISA the level of MIF in the sera from chronic indeterminate and cardiomyopathic chagasic patients, and healthy subjects. CCC patients displayed significantly higher MIF concentrations than those recorded in asymptomatic T. cruzi-infected and uninfected individuals. Interestingly, increased MIF levels were associated with severe progressive Chagas heart disease, in correlation with elevated serum concentration of high sensitivity C-reactive protein and also with several echocardiographic indicators of left ventricular dysfunction, one of the hallmarks of CCC. Our present findings represent the first evidence that enhanced MIF production is associated with progressive cardiac impairment in chronic human infection with T. cruzi, strengthening the relationship between inflammatory response and parasite-driven pathology. These observations contribute to unravel the elements involved in the pathogenesis of CCC and may also be helpful for the design of novel therapies aimed to control long-term morbidity in chagasic patients.									9	0	0	0	8	1	10			1932-6203			WOS:000316658800088	23451183

We measured time-resolved electron density by a microwave interferometer for initial electron densities in the range (2-3) x 10(12) cm(-3). Discharge uniformity was investigated by optical methods. The balance equations for charged particles and electron temperature were numerically solved to describe the temporal evolution of the densities of electrons and ions in the discharge afterglow. It was shown that the loss of electrons is governed by dissociative and three-body electron recombination with O-2(+) ions under the conditions considered. Good agreement between the calculated and measured electron density histories could be obtained only when the rate of three-body recombination was increased by an order of magnitude and when the dependence of the recombination rate on electron temperature was changed. This could testify that the well-understood mechanism of three-body electron recombination with atomic ions could be noticeably modified in the case of molecular ions.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0022-3727			WOS:000305417000007		
J	Gao, Xiaoyong; Li, Binqi; Liu, Shuaiyang								Room temperature deposited silver oxide films by dc magnetron sputtering with high sputtering power: effect of deposition time on microstructure, electrical and optical properties								PHYSICA SCRIPTA				97	2					025808	10.1088/1402-4896/ac4cff				FEB 1 2022	2022	A series of non-stoichiometric p-type silver oxide (AgxO) films are room temperature deposited on glass substrates at different deposition time (t(d)) by dc magnetron sputtering with high sputtering power. The evolution in component and the change in electrical and optical properties of the films with t(d) are studied by XRD, SEM, EDS, visible-infrared spectroscopy and Hall data. The p-type conduction of cubic AgO and Ag2O phases is also proposed in mechanism. The evolution in component from AgO to almost Ag2O and the change in microstructure with t(d) are caused by the thermal decomposition of AgO phase induced by high sputtering power. The film's absorption edge firstly redshifts from 2.8 to 2.3 eV with increase of t(d) from 2 min to 15 min, and then is suddenly reduced to 1.25 eV of cubic phase Ag2O at 20 min t(d). The phases AgO and Ag2O both have p-type conduction characteristics, mainly due to the Ag vacancies and O vacancies, respectively. The free carrier concentration and the resistivity of the films are both increased and reduced with increase of t(d). The AgxO film with 15 min t(d) is the highest in p-type conduction ability due to the highest free carrier concentration and mobility, and thus is capable of being the candidate of hole-transporting layer materials of perovskite solar cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0031-8949	1402-4896		WOS:000749503800001

Herein, we provide an effective strategy by simultaneously introducing P doping and Se vacancies to enhance the intrinsic activities in NiSe2 nanosheet arrays (A-NiSe2 vertical bar P) through Ar plasma treatment. Owing to the increased active sites and enhanced electrical conductivity, the resulted A-NiSe2 vertical bar P shows the enhanced hydrogen evolution performances. Theoretical calculations reveal that introduction of Se vacancies plays a significant role in lowering the adsorption free energy of H* in Ni, Se and P sites, leading to promoted intrinsic activities in A-NiSe2 vertical bar P. Further, A-NiSe2 vertical bar P as bifunctional electrocatalysts only needs 1.62 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting. Our study and understanding of A-NiSe2 vertical bar P may highlight the importance of element doping and vacancies in enhancing the catalytic activities in overall water splitting.

The nonstirred flow-through experiments were performed at pH 3, 25 degreesC, and oxygen-saturated atmosphere using both raw galena and a pyritic sludge from the Aznalcollar mine tailing (SW Spain) with 0.8 wt.% of galena. Based on the Pb release, the steady-state dissolution rate of galena, normalized to the initial specific surface area, is 1.2+/-0.18 x 10(-10) mol m(-2) s(-1). The in situ AFM experiments were carried out at the pH range from 1 to 3 at 20+/-3 degreesC in a saturated O-2 atmosphere using galena fragments of known dimensions. Also based on Pb release, the galena dissolution rates were estimated by normalizing to the geometric area. A derived empirical rate law describing the dissolution rate-pH dependency at 1<pH<3 can be expressed asR-Pb = 10(-5.16) a(H+)(0.41)where R-Pb is the galena dissolution rate in mol m(-2) s(-1). Moreover, using the AFM images, galena dissolution rates Were estimated by carrying out a systematic section analysis of the surface microtopography variation as dissolution of the {100} cleavage surface occurred. The AFM-estimated galena dissolution rates were slower than the dissolution rates based on the Pb release probably because of lower reactivity of the area scanned by the AFM probe compared with the entire surface reactivity.The dissolution of galena appeared to be noncongruent as aqueous sulphur depletion was observed, resulting in a Pb/S ratio higher than one. We suggest that through the overall dissolution reaction, a fraction of H2S(aq) is converted into H2S(g) as S is detached from the PbS surface, causing the aqueous S deficit. The overall dissolution mechanism observed on the {100} galena surface is similar to the one reported by De Giudici and Zuddas (De Giudici, G., Zuddas, P., 2001. In situ investigation of galena dissolution in oxygen saturated solution: Evolution of surface features and kinetic rate. Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 65, 9, 1381-1389) in which surface protrusions form over the PbS surface and dissolve continuously. Furthermore, the ex situ Tapping mode images show the growth of larger protrusions on galena substrate at acidic pH. A potential oxidative effect of the reacting solution on the galena dissolution mechanism at acidic pH was also studied: (1) As the HNO3 solution is more oxidative than HCl solution, the protrusions formed faster over the PbS surface; (2) since the Fe(III) in solution reduces to Fe(II) to oxidize sulphur to sulphate, PbSO4 and S precipitate on the PbS surface.The XPS surface analysis and the XRD pattern of the reacted {100} PbS surfaces yield further insight into the existence of lead-sulphur phases such as anglesite (PbSO4) and elemental sulphur on the PbS surface.

Our analyses confirm and expand on earlier reports of atypical alpha- and neutron-capture abundances in BD + 80degrees 245, G4- 36, and CS 22966-043. We also find that the latter two stars exhibit unusual relative abundance enhancements within the iron peak (Cr, Mn, Ni, Zn), along with what may be large abundances of Ga, an element not previously reported as being observed in any metal-poor star. These results provide further evidence that chemical enrichment and star formation histories varied from region to region within the Milky Way halo. Comparing the chemical abundances of the newly identified stellar population to supernova model yields, we derive supernova ratios of Type Ia versus Type II events in the range of 0.6 less than or similar to (N-Ia/N-II)(New Pop) less than or similar to 1.3. For the Sun, we derive 0.18 +/- 0.01 < (N-Ia/N-II)(.) < 0.25 +/- 0.06, supernova ratios in good agreement with values found in the literature. Given the relatively low metallicity and relatively high (N-Ia/N-II) ratios of the low-alpha stars studied here, these objects may have been born from material produced in the yields of the earliest Type Ia supernova events. We also report the results of a preliminary attempt to employ the observed chemical abundances of low-metallicity stars in the identification, and possible cosmic evolution, of Type Ia supernova progenitors, and we discuss the limitations of current model yields.									119	1	1	0	1	0	119			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000184408100019

One practical approach to solve the problem of low solar-to-hydrogen efficiency is nanostructuring the morphology of g-C3N4 to enhance its light-harvesting property and boost the rate of charge-carrier transportation. Here, we present a strategy to optimize the textural properties and catalytic performance of g-C3N4 via using oxamide (OA) as a chemical modifier in the precursor solution, which significantly make the light absorption edge shift from 440 to 650 nm. Moreover, the nanostructure of the resultant g-C3N4 can be easily tuned with increasing the amount of oxamide. The morphological features of g-C3N4 materials change from sheet-like structure to tubular structure, porous nanotube and eventually interconnected porous sheet. More interestingly, the unique g-C3N4 nanostructure offers advantages of a broader solar absorption spectrum and accelerates charge carrier dynamics that are favorable for advancing photocatalytic performance. The findings provide insightful information that can be used to understand the structure-property relationship in g-C3N4 nanostructures for improved solar-to-fuel conversion.									180	11	0	0	22	0	183			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000477652900098

The encapsulated iron residues can be used to in situ dope the TiO2 nanotubes without phase separation. The anatase and rutile nanotubes were further impregnated with platinum crystals with a uniform dispersion and an average size of similar to 2 nm. The materials showed dramatically improved activities for the photo-catalytic splitting of water compared to commercial TiO2 with similar surface area (up to two orders of magnitudes), due to their higher illumination area, extended absorption range and reduced electron-hole recombination rate. The homogeneous dispersion of platinum nanoparticles further increased the hydrogen evolution rate for anatase nanotubes by a factor of seven in comparison to that for the pristine material, thus proving the great potential for commercial applications.									45	1	0	0	3	0	45			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000262375700018	19417349

Herein, we constructed a composite material with carbon dots (CDs) anchored on the surface of octahedral CoO as a highly efficient and long-term stable photocatalyst for overall water splitting under visible light irradiation (lambda > 400 nm). The structure and morphology of the CDs/CoO composite were investigated by a series of characterization methods. The obtained CDs/CoO composites exhibit more-efficient visible light absorption than pure CoO, leading to higher photocatalytic activity for overall water splitting. The optimized photocatalytic H-2 and O-2 production was achieved for the CDs/CoO composite with a content of 5 wt% CDs (5% CDs/CoO), showing a H-2 (O-2) evolution rate of 1.67 mmol h(-1) (0.91 mmol h(-1)) with an expected 2 : 1 stoichiometry, which is up to 6 times as high as that of pristine CoO. Additionally, the 5% CDs/CoO composite also shows outstanding photocatalytic stability for over 15 cycling experiments. This enhanced photocatalytic activity and outstanding stability in CDs/CoO composites could be ascribed to several merits of CDs that not only improved charge separation efficiency and visible-light absorption but also effectively conducted heat generated by the photo-thermal effect of CoO.									79	4	0	0	12	0	80			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000411739700029		
J	Wang, Juan; Wang, Guohong; Wang, Xiao; Wu, Yao; Su, Yaorong; Tang, Hua				Su, Yaorong/AAL-9505-2020				3D/2D direct Z-scheme heterojunctions of hierarchical TiO2 microflowers/g-C3N4 nanosheets with enhanced charge carrier separation for photocatalytic H-2 evolution								CARBON				149				618	626		10.1016/j.carbon.2019.04.088				AUG 2019	2019	Constructing a 3D/2D direct Z-scheme heterojunction is a practical way to promote charge separation for attaining efficient solar hydrogen production. In the present work, hybrid 3D TiO2 microflowers/2D g-C3N4 nanosheets with a direct Z-scheme heterostructure is designed and fabricated through a hydrothermal and calcination process. The photocatalytic properties of the hybrid photocatalysts are evaluated by water splitting under solar light irradiation. The optimal ratio of g-C3N4 in the hybrid is found to be 50% (wt), and the resulting TiO2/g-C3N4 composite shows the highest photocatalytic activity among the experimental samples, which is 7.7 and 1.9 times higher than that of bare g-C3N4 and TiO2, respectively. The outstanding H-2 production activity benefits from the synergistic effects of highly dispersed 3D TiO2 microflowers, extended photo-response to visible light through coordinating with 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets and the strong coupling effect resulting from an efficient direct Z-scheme structure. Photoluminescence and photocurrent response results reveal that the photoinduced e(-)-h(+) pairs in this 3D/2D direct Z-scheme heterojunction can be separated efficiently, which also accounts for the obtained outstanding performance. Our results suggest that constructing a 3D/2D Z-scheme heterojunction in photocatalysts could be an efficient way to realize high speed solar H-2 production. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Scientists are struggling to enhance the efficiencies of these systems by maximizing their light absorption, engineering more stable redox couples, and discovering new O-2 and H-2 evolutions co-catalysts. In this work, Au decorated WO3/g-C3N4 Z-scheme nanocomposites are fabricated via wet-chemical and photo-deposition methods. The nanocomposites are utilized in photocatalysis for H-2 production and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) degradation. It is investigated that the optimized 4Au/6% WO3/CN nanocomposite is highly efficient for production of 69.9 and 307.3 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) H-2 gas, respectively, under visible-light (lambda > 420 nm) and UV-visible illumination. Further, the fabricated 4Au/6% WO3/CN nanocomposite is significant (i.e., 100% degradation in 2 h) for 2,4-DCP degradation under visible light and highly stable in photocatalysis. A significant 4.17% quantum efficiency is recorded for H-2 production at wavelength 420 nm. This enhanced performance is attributed to the improved charge separation and the surface plasmon resonance effect of Au nanoparticles. Solid-state density functional theory simulations are performed to countercheck and validate our experimental data. Positive surface formation energy, high charge transfer, and strong non-bonding interaction via electrostatic forces confirm the stability of 4Au/6% WO3/CN interface.									42	1	0	0	9	0	42			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000510847500007	34138054

For both positive and negative polarities, the propagation of the first ionization front is shown to correspond to a peak of the absolute value of the axial electric field inside the tube, but also outside the tube. After the impact on the metallic target, a rebound front is shown to propagate from the target to the point electrode. This rebound front is 2-3 times faster than the first ionization front. Close to the high voltage point, this rebound front corresponds to a second peak of the absolute value of the axial electric field. Close to the target, as the first ionization and rebound fronts are close in time, only one peak is observed. The dynamics of the absolute value of the radial component of electric field outside the tube is shown to present an increase during the first ionization front propagation and a fast decrease corresponding to the propagation of the rebound front. These time evolutions of the electric field components are in agreement with experiments. Finally, we have shown that the density of metastable He* in 99% He-1% N-2 and 99% He-1% O-2 atmospheric pressure discharges are very close. Close to the grounded target, the peak density of reactive species is significantly increased due to the synergy between the first ionization and rebound fronts, as observed in experiments. Similar results are obtained for both voltage polarities, but the peak density of metastable He* close to the target is shown to be two times less in negative polarity than in positive polarity.									25	1	0	0	2	0	26			0963-0252	1361-6595		WOS:000424469000003

Herein, a model CdS/g-C3N4 photocatalyst with a type II heterojunction is first demonstrated via a facile coupling of g-C3N4 nanosheets and CdS nanorods. After being combined with in situ photodeposited 3 wt % Pt and 4 wt % MnOX dual cocatalysts simultaneously, the optimal visible-light-driven (lambda > 400 nm) composite photocatalyst of Pt-CdS/g-C3N4-MnOx gives a H-2 generation rate of 9.244 mu mol h(-1) (924.4 mu mol g(-1)) and a O-2 evolution rate of 4.6 mu mol h(-1) (460 mu mol g(-1)) in pure water, which is over 420 times higher than that of pure CdS nanorods loaded with 0.5 wt % Pt. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) reaches about 3.389% (at 400 nm) and 1.745% (at 420 nm), respectively. The combination of a type II heterojunction and simultaneous in situ photodeposition of the dual cocatalysts results in a dramatically improved PC efficiency and a long-term stability of the CdS/g-C3N4 visible-light-driven photocatalyst for OWS.									63	6	0	0	3	0	63			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000535170300046	32272011

The organism is unique in possessing two de novo fatty acid synthases, a true multienzyme complex of great size in the cytosol and a plastid-localized type II fatty acid synthase composed of discrete enzymes and acyl carrier protein (ACP). The enzymology of the early steps of fatty acid biosynthesis differed in the Euglena type 11 fatty acid synthase compared to those of Escherichia coli and plants. The enzymes of Euglena participating in both priming and elongation reactions to form a new carbon-carbon bond were acetyl-CoA-ACP transacylase, malonyl-CoA-ACP transacylase, and beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I. The effects of inhibitors on the three different enzymes were noted. All carbon-carbon bond formation was inhibited by cerulenin. Although neither fatty acid biosynthesis nor any of the isolated enzymes were sensitive to diisopropylphosphofluoridate, the three Euglena enzymes studied were sensitive to different sulfhydryl-alkylating agents. Acetyl-ACP supported fatty acid biosynthesis as effectively as did comparable amounts of ACPSH and acetyl-CoA. There was no evidence for a beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III for priming such as has been reported in type II fatty acid synthase of higher plants and bacteria. The roles of the acetyl-CoA-ACP transacylase and beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I appear to be unique in the type II fatty acid synthase of Euglena. Acetyl-CoA-ACP transacylase, malonyl-CoA-ACP transacylase, and beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I were separated from one another and shown to have different molecular weights.									12	0	0	0	11	0	13			0006-3002			WOS:A1993MB64900009	8399328

Changes in photosynthetic and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and in populations of functional photosystem II (PSII) centers were independently measured. Xanthophyll pigments, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU)-binding sites, the amounts of D1 protein, and the rates of D1 protein synthesis were determined. These comprehensive studies revealed that under growth or light-saturating conditions, photosynthetic parameters remained largely unaltered. Photoprotection occurred at light saturation indicated by a dark-reversible increase in nonphotochemical quenching accompanied by a 5-fold increase in antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin. No consistent change in the concentrations of functional PSII centers, DCMU-binding sites, or D1 protein pool size occurred. D1 protein synthesis was rapid. In excess irradiance, quantum yield of O-2 evolution and the efficiency of PSII were reduced, associated with a 15- to 20-fold increase in antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin and a sustained increase in nonphotochemical quenching. A decrease in functional PSII center concentration occurred, followed by a decline in the concentration of D1 protein; the latter, however, was not matched by a decrease in DCMU-binding sites. In the most extreme treatments, DCMU-binding site concentration remained 2 times greater than the concentration of D1 protein recognized by antibodies. D1 protein synthesis rates remained unaltered at excess irradiances.									111	9	0	0	105	1	120			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:A1995QM68800031	12228414

The Mn starting materials, pH of the reaction solution, and calcination temperatures significantly affect the crystal structure, surface area, porous structure, and morphology of the manganese oxides formed. The pH conditions during the precipitation of Mn4+ precursors are important for controlling the morphology and porous structure of beta-MnO2. Nonrigid aggregates of platelike particles with slitlike pores (beta-MnO2-1 and -2) were obtained from the combinations of NaMnO4/MnSO(4 )and NaMnO4/Mn(NO3)(2), respectively. On the other hand, spherelike particles with ink-bottle shaped pores (beta-MnO2-3) were formed in NaMnO4/Mn(OAc)(2) with pH adjustment (pH 0.8). The specific surface areas for beta-MnO2-1, -2, and -3 were much higher than those for nonporous beta-MnO2 nanorods synthesized using a typical hydrothermal method (beta-MnO2-HT). On the other hand, c-distorted H+-birnessite precursors with a high interlayer metal cation (Na+ and K+) content led to the formation of alpha-MnO2 with a 2 x 2 tunnel structure. These mesoporous beta-MnO2 materials acted as effective heterogeneous catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) as a bioplastic monomer and for the transformation of aromatic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes, where the catalytic activities of beta-MnO2-1, -2, and -3 were approximately 1 order of magnitude higher than that of beta-MnO2-HT. beta-MnO2-3 exhibited higher catalytic activity (especially for larger molecules) than the other beta-MnO2 materials, and this is likely attributed to the nanometer-sized spaces.									28	1	0	0	1	0	29			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000562182900022	32805787

The aim was to assess the origin and evolution of palaeo-waters in the carbonates. The original water was contemporary seawater, from which marine cements precipitated with slightly high Sr contents (mean 1911 ppm), Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios from 0.7067 to 0.7082 and nonluminescent CL. The palaeo-seawater was diluted by meteoric water, as indicated by bright cathodoluminescence (CL) and Sr-depletion (0-516 ppm) in low-temperature calcite. When buried to temperatures of about 60-90 degrees C during Middle to Late Triassic, the palaeo-water was enriched in Sr released from the transformation of precursor aragonite and calcite to dolomite, resulting in precipitation of substantial pre-bitumen Sr-rich minerals (SrSO4 and SrCO3). For un-dolomitized limestone sections, aragonite neomorphism may have contributed Sr to the precipitation of small amounts of Sr-bearing minerals and calcite crystals with elevated homogenization temperatures (HTs, mainly from 90 to 130 degrees C) and wide Sr contents (from 34 to 3825 ppm), as recorded in stage III calcite. Since the Middle Jurassic, almost all of the early stage celestite and significant amounts of solid CaSO4 have been consumed by reactions with hydrocarbons (i.e., TSR), resulting in water enriched in isotopically light CO2 and HCO3-; Sr2+; Ba2+ and Eu2+, as recorded in calcite with low delta C-13 values (down to -18.9 parts per thousand), Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios from 0.7072 to 0.7076, high HTs (mainly 110-198 degrees C), positive Eu anomalies and high Sr and Ba contents. Subsequently, the water was uplifted and cooled down to about 115 degrees C, celestite and strontianite were precipitated with the occurrence of natural elemental S immiscible inclusions. TSR may have produced significant amounts of freshwater, which brought down Sr concentrations and salinities of the palaeo-waters to not more than about 6.0 wt.% NaCl equivalent.

J	Mittenhuber, G								Phylogenetic analyses and comparative genomics of vitamin B-6 (pyridoxine) and pyridoxal phosphate biosynthesis pathways								JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY				3	1			1	20						JAN 2001	2001	Vitamin Bg in its active form pyridoxal phosphate is an essential coenzyme of many diverse enzymes. Biochemistry, enzymology and genetics of de novo vitamin Bg biosynthesis have been primarily investigated in Escherichia coli. Database searches revealed that the key enzymes involved in ring closure of the aromatic pyridoxin ring (PdxA; PdxJ) are present mainly in genomes of bacteria constituting the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria, The distribution of DXS, a transketolase-like enzyme involved in vitamin B-6 biosynthesis as well as in thiamine and isoprenoid biosynthesis and the distribution of vitamin B-6 modifying enzymes (PdxH: oxidase; PdxK: kinase) was also analyzed. These enzymes are also present in the genomes of animals. Two recent papers (Ehrenshaft et al., 1999, Proc. Natl, Acad, Sci, USA, 96 : 9374-9378; Osmani et al,, 1999, J, Biol, Chem, 274 : 23565 23569) show the involvement of an extremely conserved protein (a member of the UPF0019 or SNZ family) found in all three domains of life (bacteria, archaea, eukarya) in an alternative vitamin Bg biosynthesis pathway. Members of this family were previously identified as a stationary phase inducible protein in yeast, as an ethylene responsible protein in plants and in a marine sponge, as a singlet oxygen resistance protein in Cercospora nicotianae and as a cumene hydroperoxide and H2O2 inducible protein in Bacillus subtilis. In yeast, the SNZ protein interacts with another protein called SNO which also represents a member of a highly conserved protein family (called UPF0030 or SNO family). Phylogenetic trees for the DXS, PdxA, PdxJ, PdxH, PdxK, SNZ and SNO protein families are presented and possible implications of the two different vitamin Bg biosynthesis pathways in cellular metabolism are discussed. A radically different view of bacterial evolution (Gupta, 2000, Grit. Rev. Microbiol, 26: 111-131) which proposes a linear rather than a treelike evolutionary relationship between procaryotic species indicates that the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria represents the most recently evolved bacterial lineage. This proposal might help to explain why the PdxAIPdxJ pathway is largely restricted to this subdivision.									137	4	0	0	123	1	143			1464-1801	1660-2412		WOS:000167317200001	11200221

Examples include formate dehydrogenases, nitrogenases, CO dehydrogenase, and hydrogenases. Many of these reactions are also of interest to humans as potential energy storage or utilization reactions for photoelectrochemical, electrolytic, and fuel cell applications. These metalloenzymes consist of redox active metal centers where substrates are activated and undergo transformation to products accompanied by electron and proton transfer to or from the substrate. These active sites are typically buried deep within a protein matrix of the enzyme with channels for proton transport, electron transport, and substrate/product transport between the active site and the surface of the protein. In addition, there are amino acid residues that lie in close proximity to the active site that are thought to play important roles in regulating and enhancing enzyme activity. Directly studying the outer coordination sphere of enzymes can be challenging due to their complexity, and the use of modified molecular catalysts may allow us to provide some insight. There are two fundamentally different approaches to understand these important interactions. The "bottom-up" approach involves building an amino acid or peptide containing outer coordination sphere around a functional molecular catalyst, and the "top-down" approach involves attaching molecular catalyst to a structured protein. Both of these approaches have been undertaken for hydrogenase mimics and are the emphasis of this Account.Our focus has been to utilize amino acid or peptide based scaffolds on an active functional enzyme mimic for H-2 oxidation and production, [Ni((P2N2R')-N-R)(2)](2+). This "bottom-up" approach has allowed us to evaluate individual functional group and structural contributions to electrocatalysts for H-2 oxidation and production. For instance, using amine, ether, and carboxylic acid functionalities in the outer coordination sphere enhances proton movement and results in lower catalytic overpotentials for H-2 oxidation, while achieving water solubility in some cases. Amino acids with acidic and basic side chains concentrate substrate around catalysts for H-2 production, resulting in up to 5-fold enhancements in rate. The addition of a structured peptide in an H-2 production catalyst limited the structural freedom of the amino acids nearest the active site, while enhancing the overall rate. Enhanced stability to oxygen or extreme conditions such as strongly acidic or basic conditions has also resulted from an amino acid based outer coordination sphere.From the "top-down" approach, others have achieved water solubility and photocatalytic activity by associating this core complex with photosystem-I. Collectively, by use of this well understood core, the role of individual and combined features of the outer coordination sphere are starting to be understood at a mechanistic level. Common mechanisms have yet to be defined to predictably control these processes, but our growing knowledge in this area is essential for the eventual mimicry of enzymes by efficient molecular catalysts for practical use.									116	1	0	0	25	0	116			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000340702000038	24945095

Recently, perovskites are most demanding semiconductor photocatalysts belonging to very important family of materials and exhibit exceptional visible light response towards photocatalytic application. This review highlights recent developments in perovskite materials and their modification approaches for improved photocatalytic H-2 production. Primarily, the classification of perovskites based on structural developments; in particular, thermodynamics engineering to minimize energy barriers are discussed. Different approaches for fabrication of perovskite materials by metal and non-metal doping, while focusing on mechanism of Schottky barrier and Surface Plasmon phenomenon to improve photocatalytic efficiency are explored. This review also presents band engineering approaches in perovskites such as site substitution, solid-solution formation and nitrification of perovskites to maximize H-2 evolution. Elaboration of layered perovskite and improvement in their efficiency by various fabrication techniques including Z-scheme formation and composite of perovskite with TiO2 and carbon-based composites including g-C3N4 and rGO in terms of multi-component heterojunction based on transfer of electron-hole pairs are critically deliberated. Finally, future perspectives of perovskite materials and their efficiency enhancement approaches for sustainable solar to hydrogen production has been suggested.									30	0	0	0	2	0	30			1364-0321	1879-0690		WOS:000565631100003		
J	Andre, Marcel J.								Modelling O-18(2) and O-16(2) unidirectional fluxes in plants. III: Fitting of experimental data by a simple model								BIOSYSTEMS				113	2			104	114		10.1016/j.biosystems.2012.10.004				AUG 2013	2013	Photosynthetic assimilation of CO2 in plants results in the balance between the photochemical energy developed by light in chloroplasts, and the consumption of that energy by the oxygenation processes, mainly the photorespiration in C-3 plants. The analysis of classical biological models shows the difficulties to bring to fore the oxygenation rate due to the photorespiration pathway. As for other parameters, the most important key point is the estimation of the electron transport rate (ETR or J), i.e. the flux of biochemical energy, which is shared between the reductive and oxidative cycles of carbon. The only reliable method to quantify the linear electron flux responsible for the production of reductive energy is to directly measure the O-2 evolution by O-18(2) labelling and mass spectrometry. The hypothesis that the respective rates of reductive and oxidative cycles of carbon are only determined by the kinetic parameters of Rubisco, the respective concentrations of CO2 and O-2 at the Rubisco site and the available electron transport rate, ultimately leads to propose new expressions of biochemical model equations. The modelling of O-18(2) and O-16(2) unidirectional fluxes in plants shows that a simple model can fit the photosynthetic and photorespiration exchanges for a wide range of environmental conditions. Its originality is to express the carboxylation and the oxygenation as a function of external gas concentrations, by the definition of a plant specificity factor Sp that mimics the internal reactions of Rubisco in plants. The difference between the specificity factors of plant (Sp) and of Rubisco (Sr) is directly related to the conductance values to CO2 transfer between the atmosphere and the Rubisco site. This clearly illustrates that the values and the variation of conductance are much more important, in higher C-3 plants, than the small variations of the Rubisco specificity factor. The simple model systematically expresses the reciprocal variations of carboxylation and oxygenation exchanges illustrated by a "mirror effect". It explains the protective sink effect of photorespiration, e.g. during water stress. The importance of the CO2 compensation point, in classical models, is reduced at the benefit of the crossing points Cx and Ox, concentration values where carboxylation and oxygenation are equal or where the gross O-2 uptake is half of the gross O-2 evolution. This concept is useful to illustrate the feedback effects of photorespiration in the atmosphere regulation. The constancy of Sp and of Cx for a great variation of P under several irradiance levels shows that the regulation of the conductance maintains constant the internal CO2 and the ratio of photorespiration to photosynthesis (PR/P). The maintenance of the ratio PR/P, in conditions of which PR could be reduced and the carboxylation increased, reinforces the hypothesis of a positive role of photorespiration and its involvement in the plant-atmosphere co-evolution.

Superoxide dismutases (SODs) constitute key components of antioxidant defense systems, removing excess superoxide anions by converting them into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. The main goal of the present study was to investigate the genes coding for iron superoxide dismutase (FeSOD) in T. cruzi strains from an evolutionary perspective.Methods: In this study, molecular biology methods and phylogenetic studies were combined with drug assays. The FeSOD-A and FeSOD-B genes of 35 T. cruzi strains, belonging to six discrete typing units (Tcl-TcVI), from different hosts and geographical regions were amplified by PCR and sequenced using the Sanger method. Evolutionary trees were reconstructed based on Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods. Drugs that potentially interacted with T. cruzi FeSODs were identified and tested against the parasites.Results: Our results suggest that T. cruzi FeSOD types are members of distinct families. Gene copies of FeSOD-A (n = 2), FeSOD-B (n = 4) and FeSOD-C (n = 4) were identified in the genome of the T. cruzi reference clone CL Brener. Phylogenetic inference supported the presence of two functional variants of each FeSOD type across the T. cruzi strains. Phylogenetic trees revealed a monophyletic group of FeSOD genes of T. cruzi TclV strains in both distinct genes. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis that gene duplication followed by divergence shaped the evolution of T. cruzi FeSODs. Two drugs, mangafodipir and polaprezinc, that potentially interact with T. cruzi FeSODs were identified and tested in vitro against amastigotes and trypomastigotes: mangafodipir had a low trypanocidal effect and polaprezinc was inactive.Conclusions: Our study contributes to a better understanding of the molecular biodiversity of T. cruzi FeSODs. Herein we provide a successful approach to the study of gene/protein families as potential drug targets.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1756-3305			WOS:000806793500007	35668508

Various physicochemical and electrochemical techniques were employed to investigate the physical and optical properties of the samples, while their photocatalytic performance was studied based on the water splitting. Based on the observations, Cu(OH)(2) was nominated as an stable and highly efficient nonprecious cocatalyst for photocatalytic H-2 generation. 4Cu(OH)(2)/C3N4(U) sample demonstrated the highest performance (187 mu mol/h/g) among the other samples with various loading of Cu(OH)(2) which is 31 times higher than pure C3N4. This enhancement was because of the important role of Cu(OH)(2) as electron traps and active sites. Additionally, the photoactivity of the sono-synthesized photocatalyst was significantly higher than the one synthesized by precipitation method by 67%. The findings confirmed the promoting influence of ultrasound irradiation on providing well intimate cocatalyst-semiconductor interfacial contact, higher surface area and better dispersion of cocatalysts. This could facilitate the efficient transfer of electrons to cocatalyst and decrease charge carriers recombination where supported by PL, EIS and transient photocurrent results. This study addresses the sonochemical method as a promised rout for fabrication of a closely contact interface which is a key parameter to achieve more efficient noble metal free cocatalysts.

In this study, Co-Co3O4@carbon composites were synthesized via pyrolysis of a Co-MOFs@glucose polymer (Co-MOFs@GP) followed by partial oxidation of Co nanoparticles (NPs). The pyrolysis of Co-MOFs@GP generated a core-shell structure composed of carbon shells and Co NPs. The controlled partial oxidation of Co NPs formed Co-Co3O4 heterojunctions confined in carbon shells. Compared with Co-MOFs@GP and Co@carbon-n (Co@C-n), Co-Co3O4@carbon-n (Co-Co3O4@C-n) exhibited higher catalytic activity during NaBH4 hydrolysis. Co-Co3O4@C-II provided a maximum specific H-2 generation rate of 5,360 mL.min(-1).g(Co)(-1) at room temperature due to synergistic interactions between Co and Co3O4 NPs. The Co NPs also endowed Co-Co3O4@C-n with the ferromagnetism needed to complete the magnetic momentum transfer process. This assembly-pyrolysis-oxidation strategy may be an efficient method of preparing novel nanocomposites.									79	7	0	0	2	0	79			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000407860600012

The titanian andradite is up to 2.5 cm in size, mainly subhedral and displays a large concentric, oscillatory intergrowth with layers consisting of plagioclase and alkali feldspar. Detailed field work and petrography showed that there is a gradual change in paragenesis from the cumulitic clinopyroxenite with interstitial plagioclase to an apatite- and scapolite-bearing plagioclase-titanian andradite-pyroxene rock, which hosts the titanian andradite veins. Clinopyroxene composition changes from a magmatic Ti-bearing subsilicic ferrian aluminian diopside to a metamorphic Ti-free, Al-poor diopside. Plagioclase changes composition from oligoclase (Ab(81)An(14)Or(5)) in the pyroxenite to bytownite (Ab(14)An(86)) in the garnet-pyroxene rock and to oligoclase (Ab(76)An(21)Or(3)) in the vein. Orthoclase occurs exclusively in the vein and contains 12% albite component. The titanian andradite-bearing veins and the change in paragenesis, bulk rock and mineral composition provide evidence for the reaction of a late magmatic, oxidizing hydrothermal fluid with the magmatic pyroxenite. The temperature of alteration is constrained by the composition of the coexisting plagioclase and alkali feldspar in titanian andradites to similar to420 degreesC. Crystallization of the titanian andradite indicates that Ti was transported on a metre scale from the magmatic clinopyroxene to the vein by a fluid. Ti solubility may have been enhanced by ligands such as F-, Cl-, PO43-, SO42- and CO32-, which are all present in the fluid as documented by their incorporation in metamorphic apatite, scapolite, and carbonate coexisting with titanian andradite. KCl and NaCl salt inclusions in feldspar within the titanian andradite were found with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and indicate that the fluid was partly supersaturated in these components. The alternating intergrowth of titanian andradite and feldspars mirrors an oscillating evolution of the fluid. TEM images of the garnet-feldspar interface suggest that garnet has been partly dissolved prior to or during feldspar precipitation, supporting the hypothesis of significantly changing fluid composition during vein formation. The concentric intergrowth is interpreted as the result of both the changing chemistry of the fluid and the different growth behaviour of garnet and feldspar.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0935-1221			WOS:000174929500014		
J	Fryer, CL; Woosley, SE; Heger, A					Heger, Alexander/0000-0002-3684-1325			Pair-instability supernovae, gravity waves, and gamma-ray transients								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				550	1			372	382		10.1086/319719				MAR 20 2001	2001	Growing evidence suggests that the first generation of stars may have been quite massive (similar to 100-300 M-.). If they retain their high mass until death, such stars will, after about 3 Myr, make pair-instability supernovae. Models for these explosions have been discussed in the literature for four decades, but very few included the effects of rotation and none employed a realistic model for neutrino trapping and transport. Both turn out to be very important, especially for those stars whose cores collapse into black holes (helium cores above about 133 M-.). We consider the complete evolution of two zero-metallicity stars of 250 and 300 M-.. Despite their large masses, we argue that the low metallicities of these stars imply negligible mass loss. Evolving the stars with no mass loss, but including angular momentum transport and rotationally induced mixing, the two stars produce helium cores of 130 and 180 M-.. Products of central helium burning (e.g., primary nitrogen) are mixed into the hydrogen envelope with dramatic effects on the radius, especially in the case of the 300 M-. model. Explosive oxygen and silicon burning cause the 130 helium core (250 M-. star) to explode, but explosive burning is unable to drive an explosion in the 180 M-. helium core, and it collapses to a black hole. For this star, the calculated angular momentum in the presupernova model is sufficient to delay black hole formation, and the star initially forms an similar to 50 M-. 1000 km core within which neutrinos are trapped. The calculated growth time for secular rotational instabilities in this core is shorter than the black hole formation time, and they may develop. If so, the estimated gravitational wave energy and wave amplitude are E-GW approximate to 10(-3) M-. c(2) and h(+) approximate to 10(-21)/d(Gpc), but these estimates are very rough and depend sensitively on the nonlinear nature of the instabilities. After the black hole forms, accretion continues through a disk. The mass of the disk depends on the adopted viscosity but may be quite large, up to 30 M-. when the black hole mass is 140 M-.. The accretion rate through the disk can be as large as 1-10 M-. s(-1). Although the disk is far too large and cool to transport energy efficiently to the rotational axis by neutrino annihilation, it has ample potential energy to produce a 10(54) erg jet driven by magnetic fields. The interaction of this jet with surrounding circumstellar gas may produce an energetic gamma-ray transient, but given the probable redshift and the consequent timescale and spectrum, this model may have difficulty explaining typical gamma-ray bursts.									350	5	1	0	0	1	354			0004-637X			WOS:000167863200034		
J	Shukshina, Anna K.; Terentyev, Vasily V.				Terentyev, Vasily/F-2506-2017	Terentyev, Vasily/0000-0002-9758-0923			Involvement of Carbonic Anhydrase CAH3 in the Structural and Functional Stabilization of the Water-Oxidizing Complex of Photosystem II from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii								BIOCHEMISTRY-MOSCOW				86	7			867	877		10.1134/S0006297921070075				JUL 2021	2021	The involvement of carbonic anhydrases (CA) and CA activity in the functioning of photosystem II (PSII) has been studied for a long time and has been shown in many works. However, so far only for CAH3 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii there is evidence for its association with the donor side of PSII, where the CA activity of CAH3 can influence the functioning of the water-oxidizing complex (WOC). Our results suggest that CAH3 is also involved in the organization of the native structure of WOC independently of its CA activity. It was shown that in PSII preparations from wild type (WT) the high O-2-evolving activity of WOC was observed up to 100 mM NaCl in the medium and practically did not decrease with increasing incubation time with NaCl. At the same time, the WOC function in PSII preparations from CAH3-deficient mutant cia3 is significantly inhibited already at NaCl concentrations above 35 mM, reaching 50% at 100 mM NaCl and increased incubation time. It is suggested that the absence of CAH3 in PSII from cia3 causes disruption of the native structure of WOC, allowing more pronounced conformational changes of its proteins and, consequently, suppression of the WOC active center function, when the ionic strength of the medium is increased. The results of Western blot analysis indicate a more difficult removal of PsbP protein from PSII of cia3 at higher NaCl concentrations, apparently due to the changes in the intermolecular interactions between proteins of WOC in the absence of CAH3. At the same time, the values of the maximum quantum yield of PSII did not practically differ between preparations from WT and cia3, indicating no effect of CAH3 on the photoinduced electron transfer in the reaction center of PSII. The obtained results indicate the involvement of the CAH3 protein in the native organization of the WOC and, as a consequence, in the stabilization of its functional state in PSII from C. reinhardtii.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0006-2979	1608-3040		WOS:000671357600007	34284710

H2O2 as a new type of clean fuel for fuel cell has received widespread attention. In this paper, a novel graphite modified paper based cobalt cobalt oxalate-nickel (FG@Co-CoC2O4-Ni) electrode is fabricated by the simple "pencil depicting-electrodeposition-oxalic acid etching-electrodeposition " process for the electrooxidation of H2O2 in alkaline environment. The as-prepared FG@Co-CoC2O4-Ni electrode owns a novel and special three-dimensional (3D) porous structure, which can greatly increase the diffusion of reactants (NaOH and H2O2) during the electrochemical reaction process and lead a high catalytic activity for the electrooxidation of H2O2. More importantly, three main nanomaterial (Co, CoC2O4 and Ni) and some new generated substances during the CV test in NaOH solution (e.g. Ni(OH)(2), NiOOH, Co(OH)(2), CoOOH, Co(3)O(4 )and Co2O3 etc.) are on the surface of paper, which will enhance the electrocatalytic activity of the FG@Co-CoC2O4-Ni electrode to a great extent due to their synergistic effect. When the reaction solution contains 1.0 mol dm(-3) NaOH and 0.2 mol dm(-3) H2O2, the FG@Co-CoC2O4-Ni electrode exhibits a much higher oxidation current density (270.6 mA cm(-2)) than the FG, FG@Co, FG@Ni, FG@Co-Ni and FG@Co-CoC2O4 electrodes. Besides, the whole preparation process for the FG@Co-CoC2O4-Ni electrode doesn't use any organic binder, ensuring the electrode owns good conductivity and stability for the electrochemical reaction. At last, the electrocatalytic mechanism for the electrooxidation of H2O2 is discussed. The Ni compounds and Co compounds are believed as the main catalytic substances, and the metallic Co core provides a fast route for the transfer of electrons. The super catalytic activity makes the prepared electrode in this study to be a promising material for the electrooxidation of H2O2 and the novel design idea gives some guidance for the fabrication of electrode materials in the field of fuel cell.

Ni-based catalysts and its compounds have been seldom reported as catalysts for the sulfate radical activation from persulfates (PDS) due to its inappropriate redox potential windows. A secondary battery inspired NiO nanosheets with rich Ni(III) defects were developed for Fenton-like catalysis via the charge/discharge process of NiOx/NiOx(OH)(y) redox cycle. The redox potential of Ni(II)/Ni(III) in NiOx/Ni-x(OH)(y) cycle is high enough to activate S2O82- for the generation of center dot SO4-. The Fenton-like performance of the defect-rich NiO nanosheets is most robust among the well-known sulfate radical activation catalysts of Co3O4, alpha-Fe2O3 , MnOOH, and CuO. The enhancement effect of NiO was attributed to the formed Ni (III) defects, which could facilitate the discharge process of Ni(III) to Ni(II) and then enhance the Ni(III)/Ni(II) cycle during the Fenton-like process. The stability and recovery of defect-rich NiO nanosheets was also studied. Its high stability in chemical structure contributed to the low Ni leaching during the reaction process in basic or neutral condition. The recovery of defect-rich NiO nanosheets could be easily realized via the annealing treatment. In all, the secondary battery inspired defect-rich NiO nanosheets with outstanding sulfate radical activation would be a promising Fenton-like catalyst for environmental remediation.									26	3	0	0	10	0	28			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000460964000012

In our previous work on rice seed germination, we identified a B12D-like protein encoded by LOC_Os7g41350 (named OsB12D1). OsB12D1 pertains to an ancient protein family with an amino acid sequence highly conserved from moss to angiosperms. Among the six OsB12Ds, OsB12D1 is one of the major transcripts and is primarily expressed in germinating seed and root. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that OsB12D1 is an anoxic or submergence resistance-related gene. RT-PCR results showed OsB12D1 is induced remarkably in the coleoptiles or roots by flooding during seed germination and early seedling growth. The OsB12D1-overexpressed rice seeds could protrude radicles in 8 cm deep water, further exhibiting significant flooding tolerance compared to the wild type. Moreover, this tolerance was not affected by the gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol. OsB12D1 was identified in the mitochondrion by subcellular localization analysis and possibly enhances electron transport through mediating Fe and oxygen availability under flooded conditions. This work indicated that OsB12D1 is a promising gene that can help to enhance rice seedling establishment in farming practices, especially for direct seeding.									10	3	0	0	7	0	12				1422-0067		WOS:000341519600022	25089878

Solar energy transforms photons into electricity via the photovoltaic effect, generating about 20 GW of energy in the USA in 2020, sufficient to power about 17 million households. However, sunlight is erratic, and technologies to store electric energy storage are unwieldy and relatively expensive. A better solution to store energy and to deliver this energy on demand is storage in chemical bonds: synthesizing fuels such as H-2, methane, ethanol, and other chemical species. In this review paper we focus on titania (TiO2) nanotubes grown through electrochemical anodization and various modifications made to them to enhance conversion efficiency; these semiconductors will be used to implement the synthesis of H-2 through water splitting. This document reviews selected research efforts on TiO2 that are ongoing in our group in the context of the current efforts worldwide. In addition, this manuscript is enriched by discussing the latest novelties in this field.									1	0	1	0	0	0	1				2079-6412		WOS:000688868800001

Because of this shift, Ishimaru & Arimoto conclude that greater than or similar to 50 per cent of the ICM iron must have originated from within Type Ia SNe progenitors. A point not appreciated in their study, nor in most previous analyses, is the crucial dependence of such a conclusion upon the adopted massive star physics. Employing several alternative Type II SN yield compilations, we demonstrate how uncertainties in the treatment of convection and mass-loss can radically alter our perception of the relative importance of Type Ia and II SNe as ICM polluters. If mass-loss of the form favoured by Maeder or convection of the form favoured by Arnett is assumed, the effect upon the oxygen yields would lead us to conclude that Type Ia SNe play no part in polluting the ICM, in contradiction with Ishimaru & Arimoto. Apparent dichotomies still exist (e.g., the mean ICM neon-to-iron ratio implies a similar to 100 per cent Type II Fe origin, while the mean sulphur ratio indicates a similar to 100 per cent Type Ia origin) that cannot be reconciled with the currently available yield tables.									129	0	0	0	0	0	129			0035-8711			WOS:A1997YA28600009

Although great progress has been made, vertical integration of the layered materials formed by 2D semiconductor nanosheets and 2D plasmatic metal nanosheets remains a huge challenge. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a solution-phase growth of vertical plasmatic metal-semiconductor heterostructures in which aligned NiCo2O4 nanosheet arrays vertically grow on a single Au nanosheet, forming vertically aligned NiCo2O4-Au-NiCo2O4 sandwich-type heterojunctions with hierarchical open channels. Such vertical NiCo2O4-Au-NiCo2O4 heterojunctions can effectively promote the separation and transfer of a photoinduced charge. Density functional theory (DFT) studies and time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy show that electrons transfer from NiCo2O4 to Au, and the formation of the heterojunction weakens the H-O bond of H2O. Due to the unique structure and superiority of the component, the vertical NiCo2O4-Au-NiCo2O4 heterojunctions exhibit significant activity with an O-2 production rate of up to 33 mu mol h(-1) and long-term stability for photocatalytic water oxidation. We calculated the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) to be 21.9% for NiCo2O4-Au-NiCo2O4 heterojunctions at the wavelength lambda = 450 +/- 10 nm, which is higher than that of NiCo2O4 nanosheets (10.9%), Au nanosheets (0.96%) and other photocatalysts. The present study paves the way for the controlled synthesis of novel vertical heterojunctions based on 2D semiconductor nanosheets and 2D metal nanosheets for efficient photocatalysis.									11	0	0	0	3	0	11			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000520487300045	32133481

Codoping is energetically favorable compared with the corresponding monodoping, due to strong Coulombic interactions between the dopants and other atoms, and the effective band gap and stability for codoped systems increase with decreasing dopant concentration and the distance between dopants. The molybdenum, chromium, and nitrogen monodoped systems, as well as chromium-nitrogen codoped systems, are unsuitable for the photocatalytic decomposition of water by using visible light, because defects introduced by monodoping or the presence of unoccupied states above the Fermi level, which promotes electron-hole recombination processes, suppress their photocatalytic performance. The Mo-N codoped NaNbO3 sample is a promising photocatalyst for the decomposition of water by using visible light because Mo-N codoping can reduce the band gap to a suitable value with respect to the water redox level without introducing unoccupied states.									33	0	0	0	0	0	33			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000371145100008	26748542

Modification of photoanode surfaces with the electrocatalyst Co-Ac has yielded a similar to 450 mV cathodic shift in the onset potential and more than threefold higher photocurrent density at 1.23 V than that of pristine BiVO4. Structural and mechanistic studies indicate that Co-Ac effectively acts as a true catalyst on BiVO4 in that Co-Ac can boost the photoelectrochemical properties of the BiVO4 underlayer by mediating hole extraction across the photoexcited semiconductor-electrolyte interface. With Co-Ac as the catalyst, water oxidation becomes much more facile by overcoming the unproductive surface electron-hole recombination. This work considers the potential application of this simple surface modification approach for other candidate photoanodes.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000483698400009

The unique dual Z-scheme tandem heterojunction core-shell structure favors the transfer and spatial separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs greatly, in which WO3-x serves as a bridge to connect two semiconductors and extends the photoresponse to visible light and NIR regions. The obtained core-shell structure tandem heterojunction exhibits excellent photothermal and photocatalytic performance, which is much better than that of any pristine ones. The excellent activity can be ascribed to the dual Z-scheme tandem heterojunction favoring transfer and spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers, surface defect engineering (oxygen doping) extending photoresponse to long wavelength region and prolonging the lifetime of carriers, and the hierarchical structure offering massive surface active sites. In addition, the photothermal effect for the tandem heterojunction promotes the photocatalytic performance obviously.									74	0	0	0	12	0	74			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000480669500025

Here, we present a multi-proxy study of Mo, U and Fe isotopes together with Fe speciation of black shales and siltstones from the upper Zaonega Formation of the Onega Basin in Karelia. We attempt to better understand oceanic redox conditions during the 2.05 Ga Shunga Event as the next step following the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) and the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion Event.A cautious examination of the Fe speciation data shows that the studied section was deposited under dominantly euxinic conditions (anoxic and sulfidic) and that the lower part of the section experienced metamorphism through which pyrite was altered to pyrrhotite. During this episode, the system was closed with respect to Fe but not sulfur. The Mo and U isotopic compositions (corrected for detrital input) were not affected by the metamorphism and loss of S and are fairly uniform throughout the entire section. The Fe isotope compositions are exceptionally heavy in the lower part of the section (up to delta Fe-56(IRMM-14) = 0.83 parts per thousand) and become lighter towards the upper intervals, which also show significant [Mo] and [U] enrichments. We suggest that this pattern reflects changes in the position of the deposition site relative to the redox structure of the water column. The upper part was deposited within a locally euxinic portion of the basin where H2S availability was highest, removal of Mo and U was more efficient and precipitated pyrite captured relatively non-fractionated dissolved Fe. In other words, quantitative uptake of Fe was favored. In contrast, the lower interval was deposited on the lower margin of a euxinic wedge where H2S availability was lower, and removal of Mo and U was less efficient. Pyrite precipitation in this part of the water column reflected a more fractionated dissolved Fe reservoir due to more protracted, non-quantitative Fe uptake because of less efficient pyrite formation under lower sulfide conditions and greater access to the large oceanic pool of Fe. The U isotopic signal was corrected for detrital contribution giving compositions similar to the riverine input and suggesting that co-precipitation into carbonates was the main process of U removal at this time.We estimate the Mo isotope composition of the contemporaneous ocean to be delta Mo-98(SW) = 0.85 +/- 0.21%. This is the lowest value yet reported for the Proterozoic ocean, suggesting that the oceanic Mo cycle was dominated by euxinic and anoxic sinks with negligible Mo removal into oxic environments. Recent studies have proposed a sharp increase in ocean-atmosphere oxygen levels during the Lomagundi Event followed by a dramatic crash. Our results from black shales of the 2.05 Ga Shunga Event are consistent with a post-Lomagundi decrease in biospheric oxygen levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

In contrast to surface waters, shallow groundwaters, sedimentary basin brines and metamorphic fluids, the delta O-18 and delta H-2 values for these Ca-Na-Cl fluids typically plot to the left/above of the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL). To date, most interpretive frameworks for these fracture fluids have focused on their production via water-rock alteration reactions that affect both delta O-18 and delta H-2 values, resulting in covariation of water isotope values above the GMWL. Such alteration processes include silicate hydration coupled with formation of secondary minerals, radiolytic H-2 formation, isotopic exchange with a H-2-rich gas, or isotope exchange with O and/or H-bearing minerals. This study presents the first compiled global isotopic dataset for these types of fluids, integrating a large amount of unpublished data with the previously published literature in order to investigate these fracture fluid systems on a global scale. Importantly this global perspective allows differentiation between fluids impacted by late-stage mixing with meteoric waters, from fluids that reflect the most saline end-members stored in the host rocks in hydrogeologic isolation from the surface hydrologic cycle. The most saline fluids are shown to occupy a more restricted range of delta O-18-delta H-2 space than previously recognised, with end-member fluids from all of the Precambrian rock settings investigated occupying a range of delta H-2 delta O-18 isotope space within which there is no co-variation in these values. These findings suggest a set of common processes may define the isotopic signatures of these most saline end-member fluids in Precambrian settings around the world - creating common signatures identifiable in these fluids, despite differences in geologic setting. This study identifies the important role of oxygen isotopic exchange between primary fluids (associated with hydrothermal/metamorphic activity) and the host rocks, taking place under low temperature, low-volume, water-rock ratios over long (Ma) geologic timescales. This process results in progressive O-18 depletion in the fluids over time, while delta H-2 values remain less affected. For each site the specific isotopic signature of the fracture fluid end-member depends on initial hydrothermal/metamorphic fluid composition, rates of isotopic exchange, water-to-rock ratios, and in-situ residence times. We suggest the often-observed co-variation in both delta O-18-delta H-2 above the GMWL primarily results from late stage mixing of the fracture fluid end-members with (paleo)meteoric water, resulting in isotopic regression back towards the GMWL, with end-points defined by the local meteoric-climatic conditions for each site.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			0009-2541	1872-6836		WOS:000608063900003

Herein, we demonstrated a simple surface fluorination process for drastically promoting the PEC water oxidation activity of BiVO4 photoanodes, achieving a remarkable photocurrent density of 3.2 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5 G illumination, one of the highest values of BiVO4 electrodes without cocatalysts. After in-situ formation of CoF2 cocatalysts, the photocurrent density could be further increased up to 5.1 mA cm(-2) (1.23 V-RHE), accompanying by a remarkably negative shift of onset-potential (270 mV). Systematic studies clearly reveal that tuning surface electronegativity of BiVO4 photoanodes could drastically promote the charge separation efficiencies of both surface and bulk up to nearly 100%. This work may provide a facile but effective approach for constructing the highly efficient BiVO4 photoanodes for solar water splitting.									46	3	0	0	4	1	47			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000501613700009

However, it is a major challenge to explore industrially feasible electrodes for this type of linear batteries. Herein, for the first time, we have demonstrated an effective strategy to fabricate a feasible electrode on a large scale by dyeing industrially weavable and highly conductive metal/cotton yarns with the active material ink, RuO2-coated nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (CNT). The obtained wire-shaped Li-O-2 battery exhibits a high discharge capacity of 1981 mA h g(carbon)(-1) at a current density of 320 mA g(carbon)(-1) and could stably work beyond 100 cycles (more than 600 hours) without obvious degradation, even under bending conditions. The new freestanding type electrode will represent a critical step towards the production and practical application of flexible Li-O-2 batteries.									23	2	0	0	0	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395077600062

The effect of two deposition parameters (the substrate temperature and the deposition rate) on the film morphology, the film crystallinity, and the density of nuclei growing on a (0001) sapphire substrate are investigated. It is shown that the crystalline structure and roughness of a film are determined, for the most part, in the initial growth stage and therefore depend directly on both parameters. At the optimum temperatures and growth rates for obtaining good characteristics of (0006) texture, crystallinity, and surface roughness of the films, the film nuclei on the substrate have a high density and good epitaxial orientation to it. If the growth conditions are not optimum, the islands are either amorphous or have a low density on the substrate surface. The nucleation activation energy is observed to decrease as the deposition rate increases, which supports the assumption that the species that are active in film deposition are "hot" clusters forming in an oxygen-argon plasma in the immediate vicinity of the substrate.									2	0	0	0	0	0	3			1063-7834			WOS:000237563200015

This ferrotitanate derives from a solid-solution with InFeO3:In2Ti2O7 = 2:3. Phase formation and crystal structure of the sample were confirmed via XRD Rietveld refinement. Structural analyses indicated that there were two dimensional layers in the structure. The mutual repulsion in the layers induces great displacements of oxygen ions. The optical properties of In4FeTi3O13.5 nanoparticles were investigated. The direct allowed band gap (2.56 eV) shows a characteristic charge-transfer (CT) transitions of (O2p + Fe3d) -> (Ti/Fe)3d in visible-light region. The band structure and energy positions were discussed. In4FeTi3O13.5 nanoparticles are demonstrated to be efficient for the photodegradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm). The photocatalytic activities were attributed to the special layer structure and the catalytic mediators of multivalent Ti4+/3+ and Fe3+/2+ confirmed by XPS measurements. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These quartzites were deposited on a stable craton at ca. 1750 Ma, following exhumation and uplift of Penokean crust and major orogenic activity related to the amalgamation of Archean microcontinents at ca. 2.0-1.8 Ga to form Laurentia. Ar-40/Ar-39 ages of 1615-1543 Ma from diagenetic muscovite in the Sioux Basin provide the first geochronological evidence for Mazatzal-related deformation and low-grade metamorphism of the quartzites during subsequent convergence on the southern margin of Laurentia. One muscovite sample from the Sioux Basin has a Ar-40/Ar-39 age of 1465 Ma that likely corresponds with fluid and thermal resetting due to felsic magmatism in the region and is similar to 40Ar/39Ar ages for muscovite from the Baraboo and Waterloo quartzites. Thus, the Sioux Basin and other quartzites in the region have experienced a similar tectonic and fluid history.The Sioux Basin has similar sedimentologic characteristics as other Paleoproterozoic basins in North America, including the uranium-rich Athabasca Basin, Canada, that is host to some of the world's largest and highest-grade unconformity-type uranium deposits. We compared key characteristics, such as the stratigraphy, character of diagenetic fluids, paleoaquifer characteristics, and composition of leachable Pb in the sandstones from the Sioux Basin with the Athabasca Basin in order to evaluate the fluid history of the basin and the potential of the Sioux Basin to host unconformity-type uranium mineralization. Based on the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of muscovite (MI) that formed during diagenesis at 150-200 degrees C, the pore fluids that were present during peak diagenesis in the Sioux Basin had delta O-18 and delta D values of -0.5 to +5.2 parts per thousand and -32 to -46 parts per thousand, respectively, similar to those of the fluids associated with uranium mineralization and alteration in the Athabasca Basin. However, fluid flow in the Sioux Basin was likely restricted to relatively thin and discontinous proximal fluvial facies that could have been diagenetic paleoaquifers, in contrast to the extensive paleoaquifers in the Athabasca Basin that promoted large-scale diagenetic reactions and alteration that led to the formation of unconformity-type uranium mineralization. In addition, the non-radiogenic isotopic composition of leachable Pb in the Sioux Basin sandstones indicates that the majority of the Pb is from a normal crustal source, inconsistent with mobilization of radiogenic Pb from a uranium-rich source, such as a uranium deposit. Although the Sioux Basin shares similar general characteristics to the Athabasca Basin, the results of this study suggest that it has a lower potential than the Athabasca Basin to host significant high-grade unconformity-type deposits.

The high heating temperature minimized the adsorption of liquid ethanol by the Nafion membrane and also resulted in the firm adhesion of the membrane to the pyrex glass, both processes suppressed the dimensional change of the membrane during the fabrication. The as-fabricated CCMs were analyzed by I-V polarization, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A comparative study was also made with the conventional hot-pressed membrane-electrode assembly with identical Pt catalyst loading of 0.4 mg cm(-2). Higher catalyst utilization and better cell performance were observed for the cell based on the CCM configuration. A peak power density of similar to 715 mW cm(-2) was achieved when oxygen was the cathode atmosphere and hydrogen was the fuel at ambient pressure. (C) 2009 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.

Suitable catalysts reduce overpotentials during the charge and discharge process, and therefore improve the round-trip efficiency of the battery. In this case, the electrodes will be used as optimized cathodes for a future lithium-air battery with an aqueous alkaline electrolyte. Oxide catalysts were synthesized via atmospheric plasma spraying. The screening showed that IrO2, RuO2, La0.6Ca0.4Co3, Mn3O4, and Co3O4 are promising bi-functional catalysts. Considering the high price for the noble metal catalysts further investigations of the oxide catalysts were carried out to analyze their electrochemical behavior at varied temperatures, molarities, and in case of La1-x Ca (x) CoO3 a varying calcium content. Additionally all catalysts were tested in a longterm test to proof cyclability at varied molarities. Further investigations showed that Co3O4 seems to be the most promising bi-functional catalyst of the tested oxide catalysts. Furthermore, it was shown that a calcium content of x = 0.4 in LCCO has the best performance.									16	2	0	0	0	0	19			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000329325100007

Despite significant efforts to date, the productivities of stable semiconductor materials in contact with the electrolyte are limited, pushing a growing scientific community towards more complex photoelectrode structures. During the last decade, several groups have focused on the strategy of incorporating state of the art photovoltaic absorber materials (such as silicon, III-V compounds and chalcogenide-based thin films). The stability of these devices in harsh acidic or alkaline electrolytes has become a key issue, pushing transparent, conductive and protective layer research. The present review offers a detailed analysis of PEC devices from metal oxide electrodes forming a semiconductor-liquid junction to protected and catalyst-decorated third generation solar cells adapted into photoelectrodes. It consists of a complete overview of PEC systems, from nanoscale design to full device scheme, with a special focus on disruptive advances enhancing efficiency and stability. Fundamental concepts, fabrication techniques and cell schemes are also discussed, and perspectives and challenges for future research are pointed out.									88	0	1	0	3	0	88			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000538143000006

A typical ferrite-based perovskite oxide material La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) is used and regulated by selective acid etching. The optimal parameters for the surface treatment are identified. An efficient bifunctional perovskite oxide, denoted LSCF-30, is prepared by selectively corroding the A-site Sr element in the surface region, which is found to not only increase the exposure and decrease the coordination of B-site metals but also effectively modulate the electronic structure of these metals. The crystal lattice of the perovskite bulk is kept constant during surface engineering, which ensures the structural stability of the perovskite catalyst. The findings demonstrate an effective strategy of surface defect engineering in enhancing the performance of perovskite oxide electrocatalysts for water splitting.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000697282300048	34469101

We report here a hybrid bifunctional electrocatalyst, composed of amorphous NiFe LDH nanosheets and metallic Ni3N microsheet arrays grown on Ni foam for water splitting in alkaline electrolyte. This electrocatalyst possesses a typical 3D hierarchical heterostructure architecture and affords abundant exposed active sites. The strong coupling and synergistic effects between the NiFe LDH nanosheets and the Ni3N microsheet arrays provide a robust integrated structure and fast electron transfer. The superhydrophilic/superaerophobic properties of the electrocatalyst promote the mass transfer particularly at a large current density. By employing the NiFe LDH@Ni3N/NF as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, an alkaline aqueous electrolyzer exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.80 V at a current density of 500 mA cm(-2)with a remarkable durability of 100 h. The bifunctional NiFe LDH@Ni3N/NF electrocatalyst is a very promising candidate for scale-up industrial implementation of hydrogen production due to its excellent catalysis activity and high stability.									43	0	0	0	0	0	43			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000562931300039

Transcriptional regulation of rboh genes has been shown during plant response to stress or phytohormone treatment. In vitro conditions often induce plant stress that leads to slow plant growth, early senescence, or even recalcitrance to in vitro growth. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important manifestation of plant environmental stress. Expression of rboh orthologs in plant tissues grown under in vitro conditions and their role in response to abiotic stress is not fully understood. Therefore the aim of this study was to identify rboh homologues in apple (Mdrboh) and to characterize their expression during the senescence of apple shoot culture in vitro. Similarity searches using Arabidopsis Rboh (AtRboh) protein sequences revealed nine homologous rboh genes in the apple genome. Phylogenetic analysis using conservative N-terminal half region sequences of the apple, Arabidopsis, pear, peach and wild strawberry Rboh proteins revealed four groups of related sequences that were linked to AtRboh D, E, F and H. A homologue with unique sequence was annotated as Rboh K in plants of the Rosaceae family. Expression of MdrbohD1-3 and F was detected in apple leaves, in vitro cultures of shoots and cell suspension, and MdrbohE2 and H1-2 varied among the tissues. The MdrbohD1-2 and F genes were differentially expressed during transfer, growth and senescence stages of apple in vitro shoot culture having varying levels of oxidative stress damage, suggesting transcriptional regulation of the Mdrboh genes in the apple shoot culture, and a potential for distinctive functions of the three Rboh D orthologs.									14	1	0	0	11	0	14			0167-6857	1573-5044		WOS:000369946900014

Reactive-transport modeling used to simulate weathering of clay formations has indicated that reactive gases (CO2 and O-2) are major parameters in controlling weathering processes.The Lower Cretaceous Tegulines marine-clay formation outcropping in the area of Brienne-le-Chateau (northeastern France) has been investigated in the context of a sub-surface waste repository. We developed gas monitoring (CO2, O-2, N-2, alkanes) of core samples from two boreholes that entirely crosscut the Tegulines Clay formation, to define the consequences of weathering and oxidation processes on gases dissolved in pore waters. We discuss amounts of gas and the carbon isotopic composition of CO2 in terms of pore water chemistry including dissolved-inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity, mineral reactivity, organic-matter degradation and oxygen diffusion. Degassing of samples conditioned under He atmosphere provided evidence of very high CO2 production in the soil (0-30 cm), and high CO2 degassing associated with a high oxygen level in the first 2-10 m of the clay. The CO2 degassing increase observed in weathered clay relative to preserved clay resulted from calcite dissolution due to pyrite oxidation and organic matter degradation. The delta C-13 of CO2 indicates that organic matter degradation was a major source of CO2 at shallow depths and down to 10-12 m, which is the maximum depth at which we observed fossil roots. Then the CO2 degassing decreased down to a constant value in preserved clay, where the carbonate system and the mineral assemblage control dissolved carbonates in pore waters. The profile of the delta C-13(CO2) also provides evidence of progressive CO2 diffusion of organic origin from the underlying Greensands aquifer in the lower part of Tegulines Clay up to similar to 40 m in the AUB230 borehole.As a first step toward understanding interactions between Tegulines Clay and near surface waters or water at the Greensands interface, we developed a reactive-transport model to simulate in one dimension weathering processes under ambient temperature, constrained by geochemical reactions in soil (organic matter degradation) and in the clay (pyrite oxidation and calcite dissolution), exchange, DIC and pore water chemistry. The simulation was carried out for 10 kyrs, assuming that weathering and soil formation began after the last glacial maximum. The DIC profile cannot be simulated without considering evaporation processes in agreement with the isotopic data. This type of approach combining a complete field dataset (reactive-gas concentrations, delta C-13 of CO2, major-ion concentrations, delta O-13 and SD of pore waters) and reactive-transport modeling is necessary for better understanding of chemical weathering processes in the critical zone.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0883-2927	1872-9134		WOS:000536438300017

Under these conditions, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a common phenomenon taking place mainly in chloroplasts, peroxisomes, mitochondria and apoplasts, especially when associated with high light stress. ROS are harmful because of their high reactivity to cell components, thereby leading to cytotoxicity and cell death. During the Ordovician and early Devonian period, photosynthetic organisms colonized terrestrial habitats, and the acquisition of desiccation tolerance has been a major component of their evolution. We have studied the capacity for acclimation to drought and salt stress of the moss Physcomitrella patens, a representative of the early land colonization stage. Exposure to high concentrations of NaCl and sorbitol strongly affects chloroplast development, the Chl content and the thylakoid protein composition in this moss. Under sublethal conditions (0.2 M NaCl and 0.4 M sorbitol), the photosynthetic apparatus of P. patens responds to oxidative stress by increasing non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Surprisingly, the accumulation of PSBS and LHCSR, the two polypeptides essential for NPQ in P. patens, was not up-regulated in these conditions. Rather, an increased NPQ amplitude correlated with the overaccumulation of zeaxanthin and the presence of the enzyme violaxanthin de-epoxidase. These results suggest that the regulation of excess energy dissipation through control of PSBS and LHCSR is mainly driven by light conditions, while osmotic and salt stress act through acclimative regulation of the xanthophyll cycle. We conclude that regulation of the xanthophyll cycle is an important anticipatory strategy against photoinhibition by high light.									69	2	0	0	63	1	73			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000309926100013	22952250

However, this process is significantly limited by the poor stability and the short life of PSII. Here, a new prototype of a semiartificial system is reported by anchoring PSII on polyethylenimine-coated macroporous carbon electrode with a high load. Good electronic communication is established at the biointerface of this PSII electrode, enabling excellent photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation and lasting electricity generation. The maximum turnover number of 10 200 +/- 1380 mol O-2 per mol PSII dimer is obtained in this system at around 10 h before complete deactivation, reaching high current-to-O-2 conversion efficiencies. The functions of PSII to release O-2 both in light and dark conditions as well as for H2O2 formation are revealed. Under periodic irradiation (AM 1.5G 1 sun), this PSII electrode allows for stable mediated photocurrent output of approximate to 4.31 mu A cm(-2) after five days, which represents the most stable photoelectric performance achieved so far for PSII-related electrodes.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000663227200001

It has been found that the dissociative O-2 prefers to adsorb on the reconstructed Cu2O(111) surface at low coverages (1/4 to 1 monolayer), while totally dissociative and mixed molecular and dissociative O-2 prefers to adsorb on the reconstructed Cu2O(111) surface thermodynamically at higher coverages (5/4 to 7/4 monolayers). More interesting is that the CuO film can be automatically formed on the Cu2O(111) surface that was induced by the surface reconstruction of the Cu2O(111) surface and adsorption of four dissociative O-2 molecules (1 monolayer), which agrees well with the recent experimental results. Along higher coverages of O-2 adsorption (5/4 to 7/4 monolayers), much stronger surface reconstruction and relaxation was found. The probability distribution of different single-O-2 adsorbed states on the Cu2O(111) surface as a function of temperature was analyzed using a Boltzmann model. The adsorption mechanism of O-2 on the Cu2O(111) surface was analyzed using the phase diagram and compared with other metal oxides.									19	3	0	0	1	0	19			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000442270800046	29882940

Metamorphic grade throughout the area is in the upper amphibolite to lower granulite facies (5-6 kbar at 730-750 degrees C). Field evidence, petrographic observations, chemical data and mass balance calculations suggest that intrusion of granitic magmas and concomitant partial melting of metasedimentary units were the main processes for the generation of the migmatites. The intruding melts were significantly modified by magma mixing with in situ partial melts, accumulation of mainly feldspar and contamination with garnet from the wall rocks. However, it is suggested that these melts originally represented disequilibrium melts from a metasedimentary protolith. The occurrence of LILE-, HFSE- and LREE-enriched and -depleted residues within the leucosomes implies that both quartzo-feldspathic and pelitic rocks were subjected to partial melting. Isotope ratios of the leucosomes are rather constant ((143)Nd/(144)Nd (500 Ma): 0.511718-0.511754, epsilon Nd (500 Ma): -3.54 to -5.11) and Sr ((87)Sr/(86)Sr (500 Ma): 0.714119-0.714686), the metasedimentary units have rather constant Nd isotope ratios ((143)Nd/(144)Nd (500 Ma): 0.511622-0.511789, epsilon Nd (500 Ma). -3.70 to -6.93) but variable Sr isotope ratios Sr ((87)Sr/(86)Sr (500 Ma): 0.713527-0.722268). The most restitic melanosome MEL 4 has a Sr isotopic composition of (87)Sr/(86)Sr (500 Ma): 0.729380. Oxygen isotopes do not mirror the proposed contamination process, due to the equally high delta(18)O contents of metasediments and crustal melts. However, the most LILE-depleted residue MEL 4 shows the lowest delta(18)O value (<10 parts per thousand). Mass balance calculations suggest high degrees of partial melting (30-40%). It is concluded that partial melting was promoted by heat transfer and release of a fluid phase from the intruding granites. High degrees of partial melting can be reached as long as the available H(2)O, derived from the crystallization of the intruding granites, is efficiently recycled within the rock volume. Due to the limited amounts of in situ melting, it seems likely that such regional migmatite terranes are not the sources for large intrusive granite bodies. The high geothermal gradient inferred from the metamorphic conditions was probably caused by exhumation of deep crustal rocks and contemporaneous intrusion of huge masses of granitoid magmas. The Davetsaub area represents an example of migmatites formed at moderate pressures and high temperatures, and illustrates some of the reactions that may modify leucosome compositions. The area provides constraints on melting processes operating in high-grade metasedimentary rocks.									58	7	0	0	1	0	61			0263-4929			WOS:000073388200008

Two of these states were identified by redox titration with Os(bpy)(3)(2+) as one-electron ([3,4]) and four-electron oxidized species ([5,5]); spectroscopic analysis of reaction products formed upon mixing the [3,3] and [5,5] ions indicated that the third oxidation state is a two-electron oxidized species ([4,4]). The [5,5] ion underwent first-order decay to the [4,4] ion with a rate constant, k similar or equal to 9.5 x 10(-3) s(-1), that was nearly identical with the catalytic turnover rate for O-2 evolution, k(cat) similar or equal to 1.3 x 10(-2) s(-1) measured under comparable conditions. The [4,4] ion underwent degradation more slowly to the [3,4] ion, which was stable on these time sc ales. An analogue bearing 4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine ligands exhibited very similar behavior, except that the oxidation steps were shifted by similar to 50 mV to lower potentials. O-18 isotope labeling experiments on the underivatized complex established that there was no oxygen exchange at the bridging mu-oxo position during catalytic turnover. Frozen solutions of the [5,5] ion displayed unusual low-temperature spectroscopic features, including the following: (i) a narrow g = 2.02 axial EPR signal exhibiting an apparent six-line hyperfine interaction from a minor component; (ii) a concentration-dependent broad rhombic EPR signal in mixtures also containing the [4,4] ion; and (iii) a concentration-dependent replacement of its characteristic ruthenyl Ru=O stretching mode at 818 cm(-1) in the RR spectrum when chemically oxidized with Ce4+ by an O-18 isotope sensitive set of three bands in the 650 cm(-1) region. The RR spectrum of this new species is consistent with further coordination of the terminal oxo ligands by Ce3+ to form additional ligand bridges.									76	1	0	0	11	0	76			0002-7863			WOS:000087540500009

To overcome this challenge, most approaches have focused on improving the stability of Si by coating dense and thin protective layers using high vacuum-based techniques such as atomic layer deposition. However, these procedures are costly, making scalability for practical applications difficult. Herein, we report a modified electroless deposition (ELD) method to uniformly deposit protective and catalytic Ni films on Si wafers, resulting in efficient and stable Si photoanodes for solar water oxidation. The optimized Ni/n-Si photoanode achieves an onset potential of similar to 1.09 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode and a saturation current density of similar to 27.5 mA/cm(2) under AM 1.5 G illumination at pH 14. The ELD method is additionally capable of Ni deposition on a 4-inch n-Si wafer, demonstrating the first 4-inch Si photoanode. The solar water oxidation of the ELD-Ni/n-Si photoanode can be further improved by surface texturing, built-in n-p junctions, or coupling with more efficient catalysts.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000433048600050

CVD TiN films have been deposited in a commercial reactor via the thermal decomposition of tetrakis-dimethyl-amino-titanium (TDMAT) precursor in an Nz ambient. The deposition can be characterized by a simple Arrhenius rate expression with a half-order dependence on TDMAT concentration and an activation energy of 0.53 eV. Designed experiments show that the deposition transitions from being kinetically limited at high TDMAT flow rates and low temperatures to transport limited at the other extreme. In the kinetically limited regime; the deposition rate increases with increasing TDMAT mole fraction and increasing temperature. Step coverage simulations have been performed by coupling SPEEDIE (a profile evolution program) with the Arrhenius rate expression. Experimental and simulated step coverages show good agreement over a wide range of process conditions. Step coverage improves with increasing deposition rate and decreasing temperature. Adequate deposition rates (>400 Angstrom/min) with good deposition uniformity and high step coverage (50%-85%) can be achieved. Film stress and roughness are mostly invariant with process conditions. These films are close to stoichiometric (i.e., 1:1 Ti:N ratio), but contain up to 30% carbon. Exposure of these films to air causes rapid oxidation with a steady state concentration of 15%-20% oxygen after 24 h of air exposure. The high carbon concentration results in high film resistivity (5000 mu Omega cm), which doubles after 24 h of air exposure due to oxidation of the film. Film resistivity decreases and him stability improves with increasing N-2 how rate. Electrical characterization of two process variants have been performed. The first provides a film with 85% step coverage with a resistivity of 5600 mu Omega cm, while the second process achieves a lower resistivity of 3700 mu Omega cm and a lower step coverage of 50%. Electrical performance of both films is similar. Contact induced diode leakage is lower for CVD TiN compared to PVD TiN. Contact resistance for 100-200 Angstrom CVD TiN is comparable or lower than 500 Angstrom PVD TiN. A 100 Angstrom CVD TiN barrier is adequate; 300 Angstrom CVD TiN is too thick because of high film resistivity. An Al-Cu/100-300 Angstrom CVD TiN/Si stack shows lower resistance increase after 450-500 degrees C; 30 min N-2 anneal compared to a Al-Cu/200 Angstrom PVD TiN/Si stack indicating that CVD TiN is a superior barrier and is more inert than PVD TiN.

However, oxidative stress can be inhibited by enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense mechanisms. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are well-known scavengers of superoxide radicals, and they protect cells by detoxifying hazardous reactive oxygen species. Here, we have identified and characterized two different SODs, CuZnSOD and MnSOD, from black rockfish (RfCuZnSOD and RfMnSOD, respectively). In silica analysis revealed the well conserved molecular structures comprising all essential properties of CuZnSOD and MnSOD. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that both RfCuZnSOD and RfMnSOD cladded with their fish counterparts. The recombinant RfSOD proteins demonstrated their potential superoxide scavenging abilities through a xanthine oxidase assay. The optimum temperature and pH conditions for both rRfSODs were 25 degrees C and pH 8, respectively. Moreover, the potential peroxidation function of rRfCuZnSOD was observed in the presence of HCO3-. The highest peroxidation activity was observed at 100 mu g/mL of rRfCuZnSOD using the MTT cell viability assay and flow cytometry. The analogous tissue-specific expression profile indicated ubiquitous expression of both RfCuZnSOD and RfMnSOD in selected tissues of healthy juvenile rockfish. An immune challenge experiment illustrated the altered expression profiles of both RfCuZnSOD and RfMnSOD against lipopolysaccharide, Streptococcus iniae, and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). Collectively, these results strengthen the general understanding of the structural and functional characteristics of SODs within the host defense system.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000440958100005	29859306

In order to understand the molecular pathways involved in the regulation of hepcidin expression in teleost fish, we have isolated for European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) several coding sequences of known molecules involved on these pathways in mammals, namely jak3, stat3, tmprss6, bmp6, bmpr2, hjv, smad4, smad5, tfr1 and tfr2. The transcription levels of the isolated genes were evaluated by real-time PCR on fish subjected to experimental iron modulation (overload/deficiency) or infection with Photobacterium damsela. Results show that genes associated with the major pathway of the inflammatory response (IL6/JAK/STAT pathway) in mammals are also modulated in sea bass, being up-regulated during infection. Similarly, genes of the pathways classically associated with the response to variations in iron status (the HJV/BMP/SMAD and HFE/TfR pathways) are also modulated, mostly through down-regulation in iron deficiency and up-regulation during iron overload. Interestingly, many of these genes are also found to be up-regulated during infection, which may indicate a crosstalk between the known pathways of hepcidin regulation. These observations suggest the evolutionary conservation of the mechanisms of hepcidin regulation in teleost fish. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Dzik, Jolanta M.								Metabolic evolutionary roots of the macrophage immune response in amoeba-bacteria interactions: The conserved role of hypoxia-induced Factor and AMP kinase								ACTA BIOCHIMICA POLONICA				68	3			457	476		10.18388/abp.2020_5683				2021	2021	The bacteria Legionella, being able to infect both macrophages and protozoans, reduce oxidative phosphorylation and induce glycolysis, which allows pathogens to grow and replicate in these cells. In amoeba-like inflammatory macrophages (M1), the phagocytizing cells of the primary immune defense, an increase in the rate of glycolysis is followed by a decrease of oxidative phosphorylation. The opposite takes place in anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2). They change from glycolysis to oxidative metabolism when AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) is activated by a high ratio of AMP/ATP. Stimulation of macrophages with anti-inflammatory cytokines causes activation of AMPK. Infection of macrophages with the parasitic flagellate Leishmania infantum induces a switch from an initial glycolytic phase to oxidative phase with the essential role of AMPK in this change. Activated AMPK induces catabolic pathways effectively producing ATP as well as processes requiring the energy supply. AMPK regulates the migration of cells and enhances the phagocytic activity of macrophages. In macrophages, bacterial products activate TLRs and NF-kappa B signaling, causing an increase of transcription of hypoxia-induced factor HIF-1 alpha (a subunit of HIF-1). This brings about induction of the enzyme and transporter expression essential for glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway to proceed and makes biosynthetic processes and ROS production in macrophages possible. Hypoxia augments macrophage phagocytosis in a HIF-1 alpha-dependent manner. Multicellular parasites experience changes in the availability of oxygen in their life cycle. In the nematode Ascaris suum, HIF participates in the pre-adaptation to hypoxic conditions after infection of their hosts. Also, the freshwater and marine invertebrates meet changes of oxygen concentrations. In the anaerobic branch of the respiratory chain of these invertebrates, fumarate serves as the terminal electron acceptor that is reduced to succinate in complex II of the ETC. In mammalian cells, accumulation of succinate under hypoxic conditions suggests that the mammalian complex II may reduce fumarate to succinate, too. The data reviewed here show that the ability to shift the cell metabolism towards glycolysis observed in activated macrophages can be traced back in evolution to metabolic changes characterizing protozoans infected with bacteria. Anabolic needs of multiplying bacteria direct host metabolism to glycolysis that produces, aside from ATP, precursors of the amino acids used by the pathogen for its protein synthesis. M1 activated mammalian macrophages behave in the same way. Regulation of metabolism in M1 and M2 macrophages is further enhanced by HIF-1 and AMPK, respectively. These archaic functions of AMPK and HIF, important also to control phagocytosis and cell migration were extended to embryonic development in multicellular organisms.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0001-527X	1734-154X		WOS:000692590100014	34374500	
J	KIM, DS; WATANABE, Y								INHIBITION OF GROWTH AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS OF FRESH-WATER PHYTOPLANKTON BY ULTRAVIOLET-A (UVA) RADIATION AND SUBSEQUENT RECOVERY FROM STRESS								JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH				16	12			1645	1654		10.1093/plankt/16.12.1645				DEC 1994	1994	The effect of ultraviolet A (UVA) on growth and photosynthetic rate was studied in diatoms (Melosira spp.) of the phytoplankton of a eutrophic lake and a cultured green alga Chlorella ellipsoidea. The cells were incubated under photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (-UVA) or PAR + UVA conditions (+UVA). Growth of C.ellipsoidea was retarded under +UVA, as shown by an increase in the lag period, but the rate of exponential growth was almost the same in + and -UVA conditions. The photosynthetic rate was depressed markedly by UVA in Chlorella cells grown under -UVA. In contrast, cells grown in +UVA showed only slight inhibition by UVA and after exposure to UVA for 6 days there was no inhibition. During the growth experiment, the cellular chlorophyll a content was higher in +UVA than -UVA grown cells. A similar effect was observed in diatoms from the eutrophic Lake Suwa. In vivo fluorescence with (F-a) and without 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea (DCMU) (F-b) and the photosynthetic rate were measured for C.ellipsoidea and the diatoms for 5 h under + and -UVA conditions. Soon after C.ellipsoidea had been subjected to +UVA, F-b and F-a - F-b decreased quickly and reached minima after 40 min and 1 h, respectively. The suppressed in vivo fluorescence resumed and full recovery was achieved after 4 h. This suggests that reactivation of the photosystem is acquired under prolonged exposure to UVA. A similar shift of F-a - F-b, but no change in F-b, was found in diatoms by exposure to UVA. Changes in photosynthetic oxygen evolution by C.ellipsoidea under +UVA were similar to changes in F-a - F-b. Degradation of chlorophyll a extracted in methanol was enhanced by UVA. The rate of degradation by UVA was independent of temperature from 15 to 34 degrees C, suggesting a photochemical reaction. The results indicate that C.ellipsoidea and Melosira spp. acclimatize to prolonged UVA exposure by reactivation of the photosystem and enhanced cellular chlorophyll a synthesis. The ecological importance of these results to phytoplankton productivity in natural aquatic environments is discussed.									35	0	0	0	30	0	36			0142-7873			WOS:A1994QE95100004

Initial oxygenation of substrate fatty acids is mainly catalyzed by lipoxygenases (LOXs) and alpha-dioxygenases but can also take place non-enzymatically by autoxidation or singlet oxygen-dependent reactions. The resulting hydroperoxides are further metabolized by secondary enzymes to produce a large variety of compounds, including the hormone jasmonic acid (JA) and shortchain green leaf volatiles. In flowering plants, which lack arachidonic acid, oxylipins are produced mainly from oxidation of polyunsaturated C18 fatty acids, notably linolenic and linoleic acids. Algae and mosses in addition possess polyunsaturated C20 fatty acids including arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids, which can also be oxidized by LOXs and transformed into bioactive compounds. Mosses are phylogenetically placed between unicellular green algae and flowering plants, allowing evolutionary studies of the different oxylipin pathways. During the last years the moss Physcomitrella patens has become an attractive model plant for understanding oxylipin biosynthesis and diversity. In addition to the advantageous evolutionary position, functional studies of the different oxylipin-forming enzymes can be performed in this moss by targeted gene disruption or single point mutations by means of homologous recombination. Biochemical characterization of several oxylipin-producing enzymes and oxylipin profiling in P patens reveal the presence of a wider range of oxylipins compared to flowering plants, including C18 as well as C20-derived oxylipins. Surprisingly, one of the most active oxylipins in plants, JA, is not synthesized in this moss. In this review, we present an overview of oxylipins produced in mosses and discuss the current knowledge related to the involvement of oxylipin-producing enzymes and their products in moss development and defense.									38	0	1	0	31	0	40			1664-462X			WOS:000358424200001	26191067

Laser-flash excitation of PSII in the S-2 or S-3 state induces processes with time constants around 350 ns, which have been assigned previously to energetic relaxation of the oxidized tyrosine (Y-Z(OX)). Herein we report monitoring of these processes in the time domain of hundreds of nanoseconds by photoacoustic (or 'optoacoustic') experiments involving pressure-wave detection after excitation of PSII membrane particles by ns-laser flashes. We find that specifically for excitation of PSII in the S-2 state, nuclear rearrangements are induced which amount to a contraction of PSII by at least 30 angstrom(3) (time constant of 350 ns at 25 degrees C; activation energy of 285 +/- 50 meV). In the S-3 state, the 350-ns-contraction is about 5 times smaller whereas in S-0 and S-1, no volume changes are detectable in this time domain. It is proposed that the classical S-2 => S-3 transition of the Mn complex is a multi-step process. The first step after Y-Z(OX) formation involves a fast nuclear rearrangement of the Mn complex and its protein-water environment (similar to 350 ns), which may serve a dual role: (1) The Mn- complex entity is prepared for the subsequent proton removal and electron transfer by formation of an intermediate state of specific (but still unknown) atomic structure. (2) Formation of the structural intermediate is associated (necessarily) with energetic relaxation and thus stabilization of Y-Z(OX) so that energy losses by charge recombination with the Q(A)(-) anion radical are minimized. The intermediate formed within about 350 ns after Y-Z(OX) formation in the S-2-state is discussed in the context of two recent models of the S-2 => S-3 transition of the water oxidation cycle.

The n-i-p a-Si layer, which had more accurately a structure of n-type microcrystalline (mu c) 3C-SiC:H (25 mn)/i-type a-Si:H (400 mn)/p-type a-SiCx:H (25 mn), was prepared on a TiO2-covered F-doped SnO2 (FTO)/glass plate by a Hot-Wire CVD method. The ITO layer (100 mn thick) was deposited on the p-type a-Si by the DC magnetron sputtering method, and the WO3 particulate layer was formed by a doctor-blade method, using a colloidal solution of commercial WO3 powder of 10-30 mn in diameter. The composite electrode thus prepared was finally heat-treated at 300 degrees C for 1 h. The anodic (water oxidation) photocurrent for the composite electrode in 0.1 M Na2SO4 yielded an IPCE (incident photon to current efficiency) of about 6 % at 400 nm and was stable for more than 24 h. Besides, the onset potential lay a little (by about 0.05 V) more negative than the equilibrium hydrogen evolution potential, indicating a possibility of solar water splitting with no external bias. A preliminary result for the water photooxidation with an "n-GaP/p-Si/Pt dot" electrode is also reported briefly.

An initial boundary approach was designed in which picoliter droplets (radii similar to 15-50 mu m) of the tripodal compound were deposited on an SLG electrode, yielding microspots in which a monolayer of the tripodal molecules is initially confined. The time evolution of the electrochemical activity of these spots was detected at the aqueous phosphate buffer/SLG interface by SECM, in both generation/collection (G/C) and feedback modes. The tripodal compound microspots exhibit differential reactivity with respect to the underlying graphene substrate in two different electrochemical processes. For example, during the oxygen reduction reaction, adsorbed 1.2PF(6) tripodal molecules generate more H2O2 than the bare graphene surface. This product was detected with spatial and temporal resolution using the SECM tip. The tripodal compound also mediates the oxidation of a Fe(II) species, generated at the SECM tip, under conditions in which SLG shows slow interfacial charge transfer. In each case, SECM images, obtained at increasing times, show a gradual decrease in the electrochemical response due to radial diffusion of the adsorbed molecules outward from the microspots onto the unfunctionalized areas of the SLG surface. This response was fit to a simple surface diffusion model, which yielded excellent agreement between the two experiments for the effective diffusion coefficients: D-eff = 1.6 (+/- 0.9) x 10(-9) cm(2)/s and D-eff = 1.5 (+/- 0.6) x 10(-9) cm(2)/s for G/C and feedback modes, respectively. Control experiments ruled out alternative explanations for the observed behavior, such as deactivation of the Co(II/III) species or of the SLG, and verified that the molecules do not diffuse when confined to obstructed areas. The noncovalent nature of the surface functionalization, together with the surface reactivity and mobility of these molecules, provides a means to couple the superior electronic properties of graphene to compounds with enhanced electrochernical performance, a key step toward developing dynamic electrode surfaces for sensing, electrocatalysis, and electronic applications.									51	1	0	0	6	0	51			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000302524800032	22409580

Transmission electron microscopy revealed spherical particles (50 nm) and the corresponding electron diffraction showed a delta-Al2O3 phase. Structural morphology by X-ray diffraction (XRD) evidenced the phase changes. These measurements confirmed the existence of the nanophase structure. X-ray photoelectron spectrsocopy (XPS) of the core levels of as-deposited, and calcined powders were carried out for comparative study. Zeta potential as determined from electrophoretic mobility measurements, at a pH value of 4, indicated a high value (+ 42.7 mV) for the nanophase alumina as compared to that for the commercial alumina (- 14.1 mV). This is a measure of the state of agglomeration, which is higher for the nanophase alumina. Fourier transform infrared spectra of the alumina powder revealed a broad band from 500 to 1000 cm(-1), indicative of the complex Al-O vibration due to interactions of the octahedral and tetrahedral coordination groups. The FTIR spectra also revealed the intermediate route leading to alumina formation, as seen from the presence of gas-phase type sub-oxide bands, In addition the presence of a strained surface vibrational mode retaining itself even after complete transformation to alpha-Al2O3 is confirmed. Optical absorption spectroscopy was studied yielding a band gap for the nanophase alumina of > 5 eV. The Infrared and the absorption spectrum is characteristic of a gas-phase type of reaction. Thus a dimensional evolution starting from a gas-phase precursor, which is molecular in nature, leads to a collisionally quenched structure resulting in very fine particulates condensing from the plasma.

To attain remarkable photoconversion efficiency, it is highly required to develop efficient photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting. For this, ternary metal chalcogenide ZnInxSy (x = 1.6, 2, 2.2, and 3) is synthesized as an efficient photoanode for PEC water splitting. Tuning of morphology helps to improve the PEC performance through enhanced light absorption and charge transportation. Similarly, elemental doping is a very fruitful strategy to modulate the band structure. Here, a facile hydrothermal approach is developed to synthesize thin sheets of ZnInxSy (x = 1.6, 2, 2.2, and 3) followed by calcination. Through controlling the calcination time and the indium content, the band structure and morphology of ZnInxSy are modulated. The observed results indicate that ZnIn2.2Sy has the optimum and appropriate amount of indium content and oxygen doping. ZnIn2.2Sy can generate a maximum photocurrent density of 4.83 mA cm(-2) at '0.7767' vs. RHE. Furthermore, with the help of Mott-Schottky analysis the carrier density is calculated. The calculated carrier density of ZnIn2.2Sy is 7.886 x 10(21) cm(-3), which is 2.37, 1.77, and 3.69-fold higher compared to ZnInxSy (x = 1.6, 2, and 3). Photoconversion efficiency (eta) is direct evidence to legitimize the superiority of ZnIn2.2Sy; it shows a maximum efficiency of 2.744% at potential 0.507 V vs. RHE. ZnIn2.2Sy shows high stability, i.e., it can generate nearly unaltered photocurrent density for 1000 seconds. The determined band alignment of ZnIn2.2Sy indicates the more negative shift of valence band energy compared to others, which promotes easy oxidation of H2O to O-2.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000500028900022

Little is known about the source of acetyl-CoA in the chloroplasts of photosynthetic microalgae, which are capable of producing high amounts of the storage lipid triacylglycerol (TAG) under conditions of nutrient stresses. We generated Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CC-1618 mutants with decreased expression of the PDC2_E1 alpha gene, encoding the putative chloroplast pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit E1 alpha, using artificial microRNA. A comparative study on the effects of PDC2_E1 alpha silencing on FAs and TAG production in C. reinhardtii, grown photoautotrophically and mixotrophically, with and without a nitrogen source in the nutrient medium, was carried out. Reduced expression of PDC2_E1 alpha led to a severely hampered photoautotrophic growth phenotype with drastic impairment in TAG accumulation under nitrogen deprivation. In the presence of acetate, downregulation of PDC2_E1 alpha exerted little to no effect on TAG production and photosynthetic activity. In contrast, under photoautotrophic conditions, especially in the absence of a nitrogen source, a dramatic decline in photosynthetic oxygen evolution and photosystem II quantum yield against a background of the apparent over-reduction of the photosynthetic electron chain was recorded. Our results suggest an essential role of cpPDC in the supply of carbon precursors for de novo FA synthesis in microalgae under conditions of photoautotrophy. A shortage of this supply is detrimental to the nitrogen-starvation-induced synthesis of storage TAG, an important carbon and energy sink in stressed Chlamydomonas cells, thereby impairing the acclimation ability of the microalga.									37	0	0	0	29	0	37			0022-0957	1460-2431		WOS:000348154300019	25210079

Here, we report the structural evolution and its relation to the macroscopic magnetization of a series of samples of Aurivillius (Bi4.3Gd0.7)(Fe1-xCox)(1+y)Ti3-2yNbyO15(x= 0, 0.3, 0.5 andy= 0, 0.3) compounds prepared by a solid state reaction, aiming at shedding light on the Co substitution-induced ferromagnetism at room temperature and above. The Co-free composition showed a single-phase four-layered Aurivillius structure (space groupA2(1)am), while the Co substitution was found to give rise to a mixed-layer structure composed of four- and three-layered phases. Rietveld analysis of the synchrotron X-ray diffraction data showed that the reduction in the number of layers across the Aurivillius morphotropic transition boundary is accompanied by a structural phase transformation fromA2(1)amtoB2cb. The disordered intergrowth of these phases was evidenced by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and found to originate from a nanoscale structural modulation occurring at the interface between the two phases. A sextet suggesting long-range magnetic ordering in the doped samples was deduced from Mossbauer spectra. Magnetic-property measurements, indeed, confirmed a ferromagnetic state of these samples at elevated temperatures. The highest values of the remanent and saturation magnetization at room temperature were obtained for the compositions withx= 0.3, in which the occurrence and enhancement of the magnetization can be attributed to the ferromagnetic clustering of the FeO(6)and CoO(6)octahedra and, partly, also to spin canting effects and/or a double-exchange magnetic interaction between the mixed valence cobalt through oxygen. The cooperative freezing of randomly distributed Fe-O-Co clusters is suggested to be responsible for the spin glass-like behaviour observed at low temperatures. The occurrence and enhancement of the magnetization in the ferroelectric Co-doped Aurivillius ceramics are attributed, respectively, to the structural modulation and the population of the ferromagnetic clusters near the interface of the four- and three-layered phases.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000545331300010

M.; Takeda, Makio				Suzuki, Takeshi/F-7548-2012	Suzuki, Takeshi/0000-0002-7930-1425			Structures and functions of insect arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (iaaNAT); a key enzyme for physiological and behavioral switch in arthropods								FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY				6						113	10.3389/fphys.2015.00113				APR 13 2015	2015	The evolution of N-acetyltransfeases (NATs) seems complex. Vertebrate arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (aaNAT) has been extensively studied since it leads to the synthesis of melatonin, a multifunctional neurohormone prevalent in photoreceptor cells, and is known as a chemical token of the night. Melatonin also serves as a scavenger for reactive oxygen species. This is also true with invertebrates. NAT therefore has distinct functional implications in circadian function, as timezymes (aaNAT), and also xenobiotic reactions (arylamine NAT or simply NAT). NATs belong to a broader enzyme group, the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase superfamily. Due to low sequence homology and a seemingly fast rate of structural differentiation, the nomenclature for NATs can be confusing. The advent of bioinformatics, however, has helped to classify this group of enzymes; vertebrates have two distinct subgroups, the timezyme type and the xenobiotic type, which has a wider substrate range including imidazolamine, pharmacological drugs, environmental toxicants and even histone. Insect aaNAT (iaaNAT) form their own clade in the phylogeny, distinct from vertebrate aaNATs. Arthropods are unique, since the phylum has exoskeleton in which quinones derived from N-acetylated monoamines function in coupling chitin and arthropodins. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity is limited in insects, but NAT-mediated degradation prevails. However, unexpectedly iaaNAT occurs not only among arthropods but also among basal deuterostomia, and is therefore more apomorphic. Our analyses illustrate that iaaNATs has unique physiological roles but at the same time it plays a role in a timezyme function, at least in photoperiodism. Photoperiodism has been considered as a function of circadian system but the detailed molecular mechanism is not well understood. We propose a molecular hypothesis for photoperiodism in Antheraea pemyi based on the transcription regulation of NAT interlocked by the circadian system. Therefore, the enzyme plays both unique and universal roles in insects. The unique role of iaaNATs in physiological regulation urges the targeting of this system for integrated pest management (IPM). We indeed showed a successful example of chemical compound screening with reconstituted enzyme and further attempts seem promising.									28	2	0	0	26	0	28				1664-042X		WOS:000352989100001	25918505

The 64 CC chemokines in channel catfish and their involvement in disease and hypoxia responses								DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY				73				97	108		10.1016/j.dci.2017.03.012				AUG 2017	2017	Chemokines are a superfamily of structurally related chemotactic cytokines exerting significant roles in regulating cell migration and activation. Based on the arrangement of the first four cysteine residues, they are classified into CC, CXC, C and CX3C subfamilies. In this study, a complete set of 64 CC chemokine ligand (CCL) genes was systematically identified, annotated, and characterized from the channel catfish genome. Extensive phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses supported their annotations, allowing establishment of their orthologies, revealing fish-specific CC chemokines and the expansion of CC chemokines in the teleost genomes through lineage-specific tandem duplications. With 64 genes, the channel catfish genome harbors the largest numbers of CC chemokines among all the genomes characterized to date, however, they fall into 11 distinct CC chemokine groups. Analysis of gene expression after bacterial infections indicated that the CC chemokines were regulated in a gene-specific and time dependent manner. While only one member of CCL19 (CCL19a.1) was significantly up-regulated after Edwardsiella ictaluri infection, all CCL19 members (CCL19a.1, CCL19a.2 and CCL19b) were significantly induced after Flavobacterium columnare infection. In addition, CCL19a.1, CCL19a.2 and CCL19b were also drastically up-regulated in ESC-susceptible fish, but not in resistant fish, suggesting potential significant roles of CCL19 in catfish immune responses. High expression levels of certain CC appeared to be correlated with susceptibility to diseases and intolerance to hypoxia. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study aimed to investigate the inherent physiological plasticity of early diverging, extant species following acclimation to an atmosphere similar to that across the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction interval (TJB, approx. 200 Mya), a time of major ecological change.Methods Mature plants from two angiosperm (Drimys winteri and Chloranthus oldhamii), two monilophyte (Osmunda claytoniana and Cyathea australis) and one gymnosperm (Ginkgo biloba) species were grown for 2 months in replicated walk-in Conviron BDW40 chambers running at TJB treatment conditions of 16 % [O-2]1900 ppm [CO2] and ambient conditions of 21 % [O-2]-400 ppm [CO2], and their physiological plasticity was assessed using gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence methods.Key Results TJB acclimation caused significant reductions in the maximum rate of carboxylation (V-Cmax) and the maximum electron flow supporting ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate regeneration (J(max)) in all species, yet this downregulation had little effect on their light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(sat)). Ginkgo was found to photorespire heavily under ambient conditions, while growth in low [O-2]:[CO2] resulted in increased heat dissipation per reaction centre (DIo/RC), severe photodamage, as revealed by the species' decreased maximum efficiency of primary photochemistry (F-v/F-m) and decreased in situ photosynthetic electron flow (J(situ)).Conclusions It is argued that the observed photodamage reflects the inability of Ginkgo to divert excess photosynthetic electron flow to sinks other than the downregulated C-3 and the diminished C-2 cycles under low [O-2]:[CO2]. This finding, coupled with the remarkable physiological plasticity of the ferns, provides insights into the underlying mechanism of Ginkgoales' near extinction and ferns' proliferation as atmospheric [CO2] increased to maximum levels across the TJB.									10	0	0	0	7	0	10			0305-7364	1095-8290		WOS:000404030500015	28334286

In this work, we focus on experiments involving implantation of 30 key He-3 ions at room temperature (RT) in sintered beta-SiC. Helium is produced in large quantities in fission and fusion reactors, and its accumulation in materials can lead to the formation of bubbles. The irradiation induces structural modifications within the material that can be coupled with changes in composition, especially at high fluence. Three ion fluencies are used here: 5 x 10(15), 1 x 10(17) and 1 x 10(18) at. cm(-2). Structural damages are studied by electron microscopy and helium profiles are measured by nuclear reaction analysis (NRA). At 1 x 10(18) at. cm(-2), helium bubbles are formed in the implanted zone, which also undergoes strong oxidation. Surface blisters are also observed and helium concentration threshold for bubble formation is estimated to about 4 at. % by correlating the MET observations with the results obtained by ion beam analysis. For the highest fluence, a residual concentration of 3.6 x 10(17) at. cm(-2) was measured just after implantation (instead of 1 x 10(18) at. cm(-2)), which indicates a significant release of helium by the material during the process. The link between the microstructural evolution of the material, its progressive oxidation under beam and the release of helium is discussed. The very likely role played by the porosity on the oxidation of the material under irradiation at RT is underlined. Finally, the results obtained here on silicon carbide are compared with those obtained on another ceramic (TiC) which does not amorphize in similar conditions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0955-2219	1873-619X		WOS:000494891400001

Here, we analyze the effects of a cytokinin (i.e., kinetin, KN) on the growth, photosynthesis (rate of O-2 evolution), PS II photochemistry and AsA-GSH cycle in Trigonella seedlings grown under cadmium (Cd) stress. Trigonella seeds were sown in soil amended with 0, 3 and 9 mg Cd kg(-1) soil, and after 15 days resultant seedlings were sprayed with three doses of KN, i.e.,10 mu M (low, KNL), 50 mu M (medium, KNM) and 100 mu M (high, KNH); subsequent experiments were performed after 15 days of KN application, i.e., 30 days after sowing. Cadmium toxicity induced oxidative damage as shown by decreased seedling growth and photosynthetic pigment production (Chl a, Chl b and Car), rates of O(2-)evolution, and photochemistry of PS II of Trigonella seedlings, all accompanied by an increase in H2O2 accumulation. Supplementation with doses of KN at KNL and KNM significantly improved the growth and photosynthetic activity by reducing H2O2 accumulation through the up-regulation AsA-GSH cycle. Notably, KNL and KNM doses stimulated the rate of enzyme activities of APX, GR and DHAR, involved in the AsA-GSH cycle thereby efficiently regulates the level of AsA and GSH in Trigonella grown under Cd stress. The study concludes that KN can mitigate the damaging effects of Cd stress on plant growth by maintaining the redox status (>ratios: AsA/DHA and GSH/GSSG) of cells through the regulation of AsA-GSH cycle at 10 and 50 mu M KN under Cd stress conditions. At 100 mu M KN, the down-regulation of AsA-GSH cycle did not support the growth and PS II activity of the test seedlings.									11	0	0	0	7	0	11			1932-6203			WOS:000671691200029	34157031	
J	Khazanchi, Rushap; Reddy, Divakar; Bhatia, Divesh								Kinetic model for the reversible deactivation of a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst during NO oxidation								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				314				139	151		10.1016/j.cej.2016.12.042				APR 15 2017	2017	Microkinetic approach is used to develop a kinetic model for the reversible deactivation of a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst during NO oxidation. The model predicts the dependence of temperature on the transient evolution of NO conversion. Consistent with literature, it is shown that for low and high temperatures, it takes a few minutes to achieve steady state, whereas for intermediate temperatures (>130 degrees C and <250 degrees C), the time taken is of the order of a few hours. The model explains the inverse hysteresis phenomenon reported in the literature. In contrast to other works, the effect of NO2 as well as O-2 on the catalyst deactivation is considered. The restoration of catalyst activity is explained by the reduction of Pt oxides by NO at low temperatures and the thermal decomposition of Pt oxides at high temperatures. The effect of inlet NO concentration, gas hourly space velocity, and temperature ramp rates on the light-off behavior is captured accurately by the model. The effect of gas compositioh during cooling, maximum temperature during heating, minimum temperature during cooling, and catalyst exposure to various gases at a fixed temperature on the NO oxidation activity in the subsequent runs is predicted. Consistent with the literature, the model predicts that cooling in the presence of N-2 only can result in a significant restoration of the catalyst activity, provided that the catalyst has been exposed to high temperatures (>300 degrees C) before the start of cooling. This has been attributed to the enhanced decomposition of Pt oxides at high temperatures. It is also shown that exposing the catalyst to NO at low temperatures for long time periods can result in a regain of the catalyst activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, molecular hydrogen is proposed as one of the competitive candidates among the wide spectrum of different energy sources due to the high gravimetric energy density, cleanliness and renewability. However, the batch production of H-2 via electrolytic route requires the cost-effective and high-performance electrocatalysts to minimize the energy loss during conversion. Tungsten disulfides (2H-WS2) is an earth-abundant HER electrocatalyst which possesses high intrinsic catalytic activity and chemical stability. Nonetheless, the HER performance of WS2 is limited by the sparse catalytic edge sites and the unsatisfactory on-plane electrical conductivity. On the other hand, the self-standing nickel phosphide (Ni5P4-Ni2P) grown directly on the Ni foam is a compelling structure for water splitting due to its macroporosity and the metallic nature of 3D networks. Here, we report the hybridization of WS2 and the 3D porous metallic Ni5P4-Ni2P foam induced through a thermal process in a CVD furnace. The resultant hybridized WS2/Ni5P4-Ni2P electrode demonstrated intriguing synergistic effects that improve the overall electrode performances considerably. Experimentally, it was found that the surface of WS2/Ni5P4-Ni2P electrode contains a ternary WS2 P-(1-x)(2x) constituent, bringing the advent of desired electronic perturbations. Notably, the 3D porous metallic WS2/Ni5P4Ni2P electrode only requires 94 mV (vs. RHE) to drive a geometric current density of -10 mA cm(-2) with a relatively small Tafel slope of 74 mV dec(-1). Such enhancements are correlated to the rational designs of WS2/Ni5P4-Ni2P electrode which (i) optimize the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy; (ii) increase of the number of active sites of overall electrode; (iii) facilitate the electron transport from higher Fermi-level Ni5P4-Ni2P foam to the lower Fermi-level WS2; (iV) promote the access of electrolyte and the escape of hydrogen molecules. Additionally, such catalytic performances of the WS2/Ni5P4-Ni2P electrode can last for 22 h without significant degradations, clearly demonstrating the superior long-term operation stability in the acid environment (0.5M H2SO4). This work provides a versatile platform for fabricating the 3D porous hybridized electrocatalysts for modulating the intrinsic catalytic activity of various transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) on nickel phosphide.									46	2	0	0	1	0	46			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000454636200019

A dynamic model of leaf photosynthesis that includes each discrete process from light capture to carbohydrate synthesis, e-photosynthesis, is described. It was developed by linking and extending our previous models of photosystem II (PSII) energy transfer and photosynthetic C-3 carbon metabolism to include electron transfer processes around photosystem I (PSI), ion transfer between the lumen and stroma, ATP synthesis and NADP reduction to provide a complete representation. Different regulatory processes linking the light and dark reactions are also included: Rubisco activation via Rubisco activase, pH and xanthophyll cycle-dependent non-photochemical quenching mechanisms, as well as the regulation of enzyme activities via the ferredoxin-theoredoxin system. Although many further feedback and feedforward controls undoubtedly exist, it is shown that e-photosynthesis effectively mimics the typical kinetics of leaf CO2 uptake, O-2 evolution, chlorophyll fluorescence emission, lumen and stromal pH, and membrane potential following perturbations in light, [CO2] and [O-2] observed in intact C-3 leaves. The model provides a framework for guiding engineering of improved photosynthetic efficiency, for evaluating multiple non-invasive measures used in emerging phenomics facilities, and for quantitative assessment of strengths and weaknesses within the understanding of photosynthesis as an integrated process.									88	5	1	0	78	0	92			0140-7791	1365-3040		WOS:000322709300013	23072293

At present, high-energy X-rays and theoretical investigation are always required to determine the chemical state changes in the nanoclusters and the oxide supports, as well as the underlying transfer charge between them. This work presents the idea of using chrono-conductometric measurements to determine the chemical states of the Ru nanoclusters on CuO supports. Both icosahedral and single-crystal hexagonal close-packed Ru nanoclusters were deposited through gas-phase synthesis. To study the charge transfer phenomenon at the interface, a bias was applied to cupric oxide nanowires with metallic nanocluster decoration. In situ conductometric measurements were performed to observe the evolution of Ru into RuCox under heating conditions. Structural elucidation techniques such as transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Kelvin probe force microscopy were employed to study the corresponding progression of structure, chemical ordering, and surface potential, respectively, as Ru(0) was oxidized to RuOx on the supporting oxide surface. Experimental and theoretical investigation of charge transfer between the nanocluster and oxide support highlighted the importance of metallic character and structure of the nanoclusters on the interfacial charge transfer, thus allowing the investigation of surface charge behavior on oxide-supported catalysts, in situ, during catalytic operation via conductometric measurements.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000500650000019	31577415

These commonly cause browning reactions following tissue damage, and may be important in plant defense. Some PPOs function as hydroxylases or in cross-linking reactions, but in most plants their physiological roles are not known. To better understand the importance of PPOs in the plant kingdom, we surveyed PPO gene families in 25 sequenced genomes from chlorophytes, bryophytes, lycophytes, and flowering plants. The PPO genes were then analyzed in silico for gene structure, phylogenetic relationships, and targeting signals.Results: Many previously uncharacterized PPO genes were uncovered. The moss, Physcomitrella patens, contained 13 PPO genes and Selaginella moellendorffii (spike moss) and Glycine max (soybean) each had 11 genes. Populus trichocarpa (poplar) contained a highly diversified gene family with 11 PPO genes, but several flowering plants had only a single PPO gene. By contrast, no PPO-like sequences were identified in several chlorophyte (green algae) genomes or Arabidopsis (A. lyrata and A. thaliana). We found that many PPOs contained one or two introns often near the 3 ' terminus. Furthermore, N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis using ChloroP and TargetP 1.1 predicted that several putative PPOs are synthesized via the secretory pathway, a unique finding as most PPOs are predicted to be chloroplast proteins. Phylogenetic reconstruction of these sequences revealed that large PPO gene repertoires in some species are mostly a consequence of independent bursts of gene duplication, while the lineage leading to Arabidopsis must have lost all PPO genes.Conclusion: Our survey identified PPOs in gene families of varying sizes in all land plants except in the genus Arabidopsis. While we found variation in intron numbers and positions, overall PPO gene structure is congruent with the phylogenetic relationships based on primary sequence data.

As research methods, methods of atomic force microscopy, energy-dispersive analysis, X-ray diffraction and UV-Vis spectroscopy were applied. According to the obtained data on changes in surface morphology as a result of irradiation, the main changes are associated with the formation of chillocks on the surface at doses of 10(14)-10(15)ion/cm(2), followed by an increase in the size and density of chillocks, and for samples irradiated with a dose of 5 x 10(15)ions/cm(2), the emergence of wavy formations on the surface associated with reorientation of grains and structural disordering is observed. As shown by the results of X-ray data, the main structural changes in the irradiated films are associated with partial fragmentation of grains and their subsequent reorientation at high radiation doses. In the case of irradiated samples, a decrease in the band gap is observed, which is caused by a change in the electron density as a result of irradiation. The results of the photochemical decomposition of water and the production of hydrogen showed that the use of modified thin films led to an increase in the rate of hydrogen production by 5.4-8 times, depending on the irradiation dose of the samples.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000578369800006

More importantly, the 3D flower-like BWFO-10 superstructures was successfully synthesized at pH 10, which overcame the challenge of developing methods to synthesize Bi2WO6 superstructures under strong alkaline condition. Compared with pure BiFeWOx (62%), FWO (47%) and BWO (51%), the as-synthesized BWFO-10 composites exhibited a superior photocatalytic oxidation NO (similar to 400 ppm) activity (91%) under visible light (lambda > 400 nm) irradiation, which was ascribed to the effective separation of the photoinduced charge carriers, evinced by transient photocurrent and EIS measurements. The radical trapping experiment revealed that the h(+) and center dot OH were the important active species. And the test of stability revealed that the BWFO-10 composite could act as a desired photocatalyst for the oxidation of NO generated from fossil fuel combustion. A possible mechanism of the PCO of NO over BWFO-10 composites and the different evolution of crystal structures, growth and phase-change process had been concisely discussed. The study filled the gap of the currently reported synthesis method that 3D flower-like Bi2WO6 superstructure is not synthesized in alkaline conditions.									14	0	0	0	3	0	14			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000444000000031

We report a bioinformatic analysis of the two TS-like genes, the recombinant expression of one murine TS homolog (mTSH2) and its initial biochemical characterization. Recombinant mTSH2 contained bound pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), but did not synthesize L-Thr. The enzyme did, however, bind O-phospho-homoserine (PHS; the actual TS substrate) and degraded it to alpha-ketobutyrate, phosphate, and ammonia-a known side reaction of microbial TSs. mTSH2 also degraded O-phospho-threonine (PThr) to alpha-ketobutyrate, showing that it can act as a catabolic phospho-lyase on both gamma- and P-phosphorylated substrates. These findings suggest an unusual evolutionary origin for mTSH2, whereby an original TS enzyme became 'recycled' into a phospho-lyase upon dismissal, in metazoa, of the L-Thr biosynthetic pathway.

Herein, we employed a one-pot synthetic strategy to chemically immobilize Cu(II) tetra(4-carboxylphenyl)porphyrin (CuTCPP) into UiO-66 MOF structure through coordination mode. Meanwhile, in-situ growth of TiO2 nanoparticles onto the MOF is actualized with the generation of CuTCPP subset of UiO-66/TiO2 (CTU/TiO2) composites. Under Xe lamp irradiation (lambda > 300 nm), the catalytic result presents that an optimal value of 31.32 mu mol g (1) h (1) CO evolution amount, about 7 times higher than that of pure TiO2 was obtained through the photocatalysis. It is supposed owning to a consistent augment of light absorption derived from chemically implanted porphyrin derivative, which is simultaneously functioning with an efficacious separation of photo-induced carries given by the newly engendered composites between MOF and TiO2, an effective catalytic activity and approving recyclability of CTU/TiO2 can be achieved in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO.

The complex consists of the CP47 and CP43 chlorophyll binding proteins, the RC D1/D2 pair, the cytochrome b(559) subunits, and the Mn-stabilizing psbO (33 kDa) protein, all present in the same stoichiometric amounts found in the parent PSII membranes. Several small subunits are also present. The cyt b(559) content is 1.0 per RC in core complexes and PSII membranes. The total chlorophyll content is 32 chl a and <1 chl b per RC, the lowest yet reported for any active PSII preparation. The core complex exhibits the characteristic EPR signals seen in the S-2 state of higher plant PSII. A procedure for preparing low-temperature samples of very high optical quality is developed, allowing detailed optical studies in the S-1 and S-2 states of the system to be made. Optical absorption, CD, and MCD spectra reveal unprecedented detail, including a prominent, well-resolved feature at 683.5 nm (14 630 cm(-1)) with a weaker partner at 187 cm(-1) to higher energy. On the basis of band intensity, CD, and MCD arguments, these features are identified as the exciton split components of P680 in an intact, active reaction center special pair. Comparisons are made with solubilized D1/D2/cyt b(559) material and cyanobacterial PSII.									58	0	2	0	35	0	60			0006-2960			WOS:000173787400033	11827545

Because of these reactions, the polyphenolic content of brandies and their content of organic acids increase with the ageing. These reactions are slow, and the ageing of high-quality brandies takes several years. In this paper, the development of a system that uses the circulation of the wine distillate through encapsulated American oak chips and the application of ultrasound energy with the aim of producing aged wine spirits has been carried out, and the influences of the operation variables over the characteristics of the produced drink have been measured. With that proposal, the influence of different powers of ultrasound, and also the influence of the movement of the liquor through oak chips, was determined first. This way, the results show that higher powers of ultrasound, of nearly 40 W/L, in addition with the movement of the spirit, improve the extraction of phenolic compounds in a 33.94%, after seven days of ageing. Then, applying Youden and Steiner's experimental design, eight experiments of ageing were performed, and the samples obtained by this new method were analysed to obtain information related to their physicochemical and oenological characterisation in order to determine the experimental conditions that produce the best ageing results. This way, the best spirit produced by this new method of ageing is obtained with a high alcoholic strength of the distilled wine and a high quantity of oak chips, and with room temperature and high flow rate. In addition, the presence of oxygen in the sample and the absence of light increase the quality of the produced spirit. Finally, the application of ultrasound energy in large pulses is related with the improvement of two important ageing markers: the intensity of the colour and the TPI. As a last experiment, we applied this ageing method to five varietal spirits. The sensorial analysis of aged samples showed the aged spirits had better ratings than the initial distilled wine.

Despite the overall redox-neutral reaction, catalysis has an absolute requirement for reduced flavin, In the fungus Neurospora crassa, a flavin reductase (FR) activity able to generate reduced flavin mononucleotide in the presence of NADPH is an intrinsic feature of a bifunctional CS, In all bacterial and plant species investigated to date, purified CSs lack an FR activity and are correspondingly 8-10 kDa smaller than the N. crassa CS (on the basis of SDS-PAGE), The cloning of N. crassa CS and subsequent characterization of the purified heterologously expressed enzyme indicates that, surprisingly, the FR probably resides within a region conserved amongst both mono- and bifunctional CSs and is not related to non-homologous sequences which contribute to the larger molecular mass of the N. crassa CS, This information directed this work towards the smaller Saccharomyces cerevisiae CS, the sequence of which was known, although the protein has not been extensively characterized biochemically, Here the characterization of the S. cerevisiae CS is reported in more detail and it is shown that the protein is also bifunctional. With this knowledge, S. cerevisiae could be used as a genetic system for studying the physiological consequences of bifunctionality. The phylogenetic relationship amongst known CSs is discussed.									11	0	0	0	12	0	12			0950-382X			WOS:A1996VY73000008	8971708

A typical compatible virus host interaction was monitored during 40 post-inoculation days (dpi). An initial PEMV-induced decrease in photosynthetic CO2 assimilation was detected at 15 dpi, when the virus appeared in the measured leaves. This decrease was not induced by stomata closure and corresponded with a decrease in the efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry (Phi(PSII)). Despite of a slight impairment of oxygen evolution at this stage, PSII function was not primarily responsible for the decrease in Phi(PSII). Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging revealed that Phi(PSII) started to decrease from the leaf tip to the base. More pronounced symptoms of PEMV disease appeared at later stages, when a typical mosaic and enations appeared in the infected leaves and oxidative damage of cell membranes was detected. From 30 dpi, a degradation of photosynthetic pigments accelerated, stomata were closing and corresponding pronounced decline in CO2 assimilation was observed. A concomitant photoprotective responses, i.e. an increase in non-photochemical quenching and accumulation of de-epoxidized xanthophylls, were also detected. Interestingly, alternative electron sinks in chloroplasts were not stimulated by PEMV infection, which is in contradiction to earlier reports dealing with virus-induced plant stresses. The presented results show that the PEMV-induced alterations in mature pea leaves accelerated leaf senescence during which a decrease in Phi(PSII) took place in coordinated manner with an inhibition of CO2 assimilation.

J	Chen, Lei; Yan, Zhen; Wang, Zongqi; Guo, Xianqing; Fu, Changlei; Zeng, Zhijie								Contributions of juvenile lower crust and mantle components to porphyry Cu deposits in an intracontinental setting: evidence from late Mesozoic porphyry Cu deposits in the South Qinling Orogenic Belt, Central China								MINERALIUM DEPOSITA											10.1007/s00126-022-01138-8		SEP 2022			2022	Most porphyry Cu deposits are formed in magmatic arc settings, but some occur in non-arc environments, such as intracontinental settings. The petrogenesis of fertile magmas for porphyry Cu deposits formed in intracontinental settings is still ambiguous. To address this issue, we performed an integrated study of the late Mesozoic porphyry Cu deposits in the South Qinling Orogenic Belt. Zircon U-Pb ages indicate that these late Mesozoic porphyry Cu deposits were formed at 149-142 Ma, in a postcollisional intracontinental setting. epsilon Nd(t) (- 4.5 to - 2.7), initial Sr-87/Sr-86 (0.7046 to 0.7084), and zircon epsilon Hf(t) values (- 3.8 to + 2.2) of the late Mesozoic ore-forming and barren rocks suggest that both originate from Meso-Neoproterozoic juvenile lower crust. Whole-rock geochemical and isotopic characteristics indicate that the ore-forming rocks could be formed by the delamination of thickened juvenile lower crust or by the reaction of mantle with normal juvenile lower crust. The barren rocks could be formed by the partial melting of thickened or normal juvenile lower crust. Whole-rock petrochemistry and reversed anorthite contents and Sr isotope data of zoned plagioclase crystals indicate that the mafic magma was recharged into the ore-forming magma chamber. Due to the injection of mafic magma, the ore-forming rocks obtained higher oxygen fugacity, volatiles, water, sulfur, and Cu contents than the barren rocks. According to the regional tectonic evolution, the late Mesozoic porphyry Cu deposits in the South Qinling Orogenic Belt were formed in an extensional environment due to transformation of the tectonic regime. Large-scale lithospheric extension caused asthenospheric mantle upwelling and crust-mantle interaction, providing the crucial metallogenic conditions. Moreover, the injection of mantle-derived mafic magma into the normal magma is a key factor in the formation of the late Mesozoic porphyry Cu deposits in the SQB and similar porphyry systems in an intracontinental setting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0026-4598	1432-1866		WOS:000854733200001

This fossil-free diesel product is produced completely from renewable raw materials with exceptional quality. These efficient HDO catalysts present electronic properties similar to noble metals, are cost-efficient, and are more stable and resistant to the presence of water than other classical catalytic formulations used for hydrotreatment reactions based on transition metal sulfides, but they do not require the continuous supply of a sulfide source. TMPs develop a bifunctional character (metallic and acidic) and present tunable catalytic properties related to the metal type, phosphorous-metal ratio, support nature, texture properties, and so on. Here, the recent progress in TMP-based catalysts for HDO of waste oils is reviewed. First, the use of TMPs in catalysis is addressed; then, the general aspects of green diesel (from bio-oils or from waste vegetable oils and fats) production by HDO of nonedible oil compounds are presented; and, finally, we attempt to describe the main advances in the development of catalysts based on TMPs for HDO, with an emphasis on the influence of the nature of active phases and effects of phosphorous, promoters, and preparation methods on reactivity.									45	2	0	0	2	0	46			2073-4344			WOS:000464333900001		
J	Wallmann, K								The geological water cycle and the evolution of marine delta O-18 values								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				65	15			2469	2485		10.1016/S0016-7037(01)00603-2				AUG 2001	2001	The turnover of water and O-18 in the outer terrestrial sphere is investigated considering mantle degassing, subduction zone processes, hydrothermal circulation at spreading centers, seafloor alteration, and continental weathering processes. Mass balances indicate that the ocean currently loses water to the mantle because the water emission by mantle degassing proceeds at a significantly slower rate than the subduction of water structurally bound in the down-going slab. The current input of O-18 into the ocean through hydrothermal circulation and water emissions at arc volcanoes surpasses the fixation of O-18 via low-temperature water/rock interactions at the seafloor and on continents, inducing an increase in marine delta O-18 values. Results of a box model simulating the Phanerozoic water and O-18 cycles suggest that the mass of seawater decreased significantly causing a continuous drop in global sea-level by several hundred meters over the Phanerozoic. Model results and mass balances also allow for an enhanced estimate of current water fluxes in subduction zones consistent with the secular changes in sea-level and marine delta O-18 observed in the geological record. Moreover, the model generates a secular trend for seawater delta O-18-produced by the surplus of O-18 inputs and through internal feed-backs associated with isotopic exchange reactions at the seafloor-comparable to that observed in Phanerozoic carbonates. This coincidence suggests that the marine carbonates record a continuous change in isotopic composition of seawater with superimposed temperature-related fluctuations. A continuous record of near-surface temperatures was calculated using the model curve for seawater delta O-18 and the corresponding carbonate data. This new climate record indicates three icehouse-greenhouse cycles with a duration of 127 My between the Cambrian and the Triassic followed by an additional cycle with extended periodicity spanning the Jurassic to Cenozoic. Simulations of the Precambrian water and O-18 cycles imply that the strong O-18 depletion in seawater during the early Cambrian (delta O-18 around -8 parts per thousand) was caused by enhanced weathering, diminished hydrothermal activity and extreme glaciations during the preceding late Neo-proterozoic.

J	Nugent, JHA; Turconi, S; Evans, MCW								EPR investigation of water oxidizing photosystem II: Detection of new EPR signals at cryogenic temperatures								BIOCHEMISTRY				36	23			7086	7096		10.1021/bi962179p				JUN 10 1997	1997	Experiments are described which allow the detection and characterization of new EPR signals in photosystem II (PSII). PSII has been extensively studied with the water oxidising complex (WOC) poised in the SI and St states. Other stages in the cycle of water oxidation lack characteristic EPR signals for use as probes. In this study, experiments use multiple turnovers of PSII from an initial S-1 state to allow new states of PSII to be studied. The first EPR signal detected, centered at g = 4.85 and termed the g = 5 signal, is suggested to be a new form of S-2 probably formed by decay of S-3 at cryogenic temperatures, but a novel form of oxidized non-heme iron cannot be fully excluded at present. The second signal is split around g = 2 and shows characteristics of signals formed by spin-spin interaction between two paramagnetic species. The split g = 2 signal is reversibly formed by illumination at <30 K of a sample containing the g = 5 signal. The g = 2 signal may be a form of the ''S3'' EPR signal previously only found in a variety of PSII preparations where oxygen evolution has been inhibited. Those ''S3'' signals are thought to arise from the interaction of an oxidized amino acid radical and the S-2 state, i.e., S2X+. Illumination at higher temperatures or illumination at <30 K, followed by dark-adaptation at 77 K, removes the g = 5 signal and prevents subsequent detection of the g = 2 signal on illumination at <30 K. The most likely explanation of our data is that illumination at <30 K of centers containing the g = 5 species allows accumulation of an oxidized intermediate and that at higher temperatures electron transfer proceeds to re-form an EPR-silent S state equivalent to that initially trapped during sample preparation. Study of these signals should provide an important new insight into the WOC and PSII.									33	0	0	0	25	0	33			0006-2960			WOS:A1997XD80500029	9188708

To date, basic aspects of this adaptation remain unknown, mainly due to the scarcity of experimental studies. In laboratory experiments, we determined time necessary for the complete formation and reversion of these structures in Piaractus mesopotamicus, and studied comparatively behavioral, morphological, and respiratory responses along gradients of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. Morphological changes during hypoxia consisted in dermal protuberances of lower lip, anterior border of maxillary and distal border of opercular valve, increasing the known number of structures modified. These structures developed completely in less than 6 hours and reversed in less than 3 hours. Most of observed traits showed a logistic response curve with threshold DO values between 0.90 and 2.70 mgL". Respiratory frequency and opercular valve development showed similar threshold values above the level of tolerance of DO, whereas ASR and dermal protuberances of the jaws showed threshold values below this level. This observation supports the functional link between these groups of behavioral and morphological traits. This study demonstrates that this species is able to modify reversibly portions of the respiratory system to optimize responses to hypoxia.									2	0	0	0	2	1	2			1679-6225			WOS:000380831900020

Alkaline electrolysis cells (AEC) are receiving more attention since they can economically produce hydrogen at a large scale without the need for expensive catalysts. Developing advanced integrated electrodes from earth-abundant materials is crucial for driving this technique, however they suffer from poor catalytic activity and durability under industrial current densities. This review herein focuses on the rational design of integrated electrodes to advance alkaline electrocatalytic hydrogen production (AEHP). The representative strategies are first introduced, including modulating the electronic structure and harnessing the synergy from multi-components for improving activity as well as constructing the tri-phase interfaces with appropriate surface hydrophilic/aerophobic properties. For cost-competitive hydrogen production, the cost-effective scalable production of such integrated electrodes is discussed, which should be simultaneously considered when improving the electrode performance. Moreover, such integrated electrodes could be applied to the emerging water electrolysis systems such as anode-replacing hydrogen production and decoupled AEC for boosting AEHP. Finally, the review provides an outlook of the remaining challenges and emerging research topics in the future, including the standard evaluation of catalytic performance, precise identification of genuine catalytic sites at working conditions, accurate theoretical modeling and AI-assisted catalyst screening, and external-fields coupled AEC, etc. The new insights and knowledge provided regarding these aspects will help fill the existing gaps between scientific communities and industries and open up opportunities for bringing this promising technology into reality.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000809044900001

Tetraethyl tin was used as tin source and dry air both as fluidization gas and oxidant reagent. The SnO2 films were grown in a FBCVD reactor under reduced pressure (13.3 kPa) in the temperature range of 633-663 K. A series of specific experiments was carried out to optimize the design of the reactor and to determine the range of experimental parameters (flow rate, pressure, temperature) leading to good fluidization of the large hollow Ni particles used as base material. The SnO2 films deposited on particles exhibited a dense nodular surface morphology similar to that previously observed on flat substrates. The relative thickness of the films was determined by EDS analyses and the real values were measured by SEM on cross-sections of particles. The SnO2 films exhibit satisfactory thickness uniformity from one particle to another in the same batch and from run to run. XRD studies revealed that the films exhibited good crystallinity with the cassiterite structure. Traces of NiO were found at the SnO2/Ni interface. Finally, the SnO2 CVD coated-Ni particles were used as anodes in an electrochemical cell. The potential limit of oxygen evolution measured was that of the SnO2 layer despite the initial porosity of the hollow Ni particles inherent to their preparation. This work is the first step towards the preparation of high specific surface area electrodes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									13	1	0	0	1	0	14			0257-8972			WOS:000238816100013

This swifter pace of discovery requires faster research and development cycles enabled by better integration between hypothesis generation, design, experimentation, and data analysis. Typical research cycles take months to years. However, data-driven automated laboratories, or self-driving laboratories, can significantly accelerate molecular and materials discovery. Recently, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of machine learning and optimization algorithms that have allowed researchers to extract valuable knowledge from multidimensional data sets. Machine learning models can be trained on large data sets from the literature or databases, but their performance can often be hampered by a lack of negative results or metadata. In contrast, data generated by self-driving laboratories can be information-rich, containing precise details of the experimental conditions and metadata. Consequently, much larger amounts of high-quality data are gathered in self-driving laboratories. When placed in open repositories, this data can be used by the research community to reproduce experiments, for more in-depth analysis, or as the basis for further investigation. Accordingly, high-quality open data sets will increase the accessibility and reproducibility of science, which is sorely needed. In this Account, we describe our efforts to build a self-driving lab for the development of a new class of materials: organic semiconductor lasers (OSLs). Since they have only recently been demonstrated, little is known about the molecular and material design rules for thin-film, electrically-pumped OSL devices as compared to other technologies such as organic light-emitting diodes or organic photovoltaics. To realize high-performing OSL materials, we are developing a flexible system for automated synthesis via iterative Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. This automated synthesis platform is directly coupled to the analysis and purification capabilities. Subsequently, the molecules of interest can be transferred to an optical characterization setup. We are currently limited to optical measurements of the OSL molecules in solution. However, material properties are ultimately most important in the solid state (e.g., as a thin-film device). To that end and for a different scientific goal, we are developing a self-driving lab for inorganic thin-film materials focused on the oxygen evolution reaction. While the future of self-driving laboratories is very promising, numerous challenges still need to be overcome. These challenges can be split into cognition and motor function. Generally, the cognitive challenges are related to optimization with constraints or unexpected outcomes for which general algorithmic solutions have yet to be developed. A more practical challenge that could be resolved in the near future is that of software control and integration because few instrument manufacturers design their products with self-driving laboratories in mind. Challenges in motor function are largely related to handling heterogeneous systems, such as dispensing solids or performing extractions.As a result, it is critical to understand that adapting experimental procedures that were designed for human experimenters is not as simple as transferring those same actions to an automated system, and there may be more efficient ways to achieve the same goal in an automated fashion. Accordingly, for self-driving laboratories, we need to carefully rethink the translation of manual experimental protocols.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000844647700001	35948428

Reveals High Evolutionary Conservation and Diverse Responses to Abiotic Stresses								FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE				7						1099	10.3389/fpls.2016.01099				JUL 26 2016	2016	The 14-3-3 gene family identified in all eukaryotic organisms is involved in a wide range of biological processes, particularly in resistance to various abiotic stresses. Here, we performed the first comprehensive study on the molecular characterization, phylogenetics, and responses to various abiotic stresses of the 14-3-3 gene family in Brachypodium distachyon L. A total of seven 14-3-3 genes from B. distachyon and 120 from five main lineages among 12 species were identified, which were divided into five well-conserved subfamilies. The molecular structure analysis showed that the plant 14-3-3 gene family is highly evolutionarily conserved, although certain divergence had occurred in different subfamilies. The duplication event investigation revealed that segmental duplication seemed to be the predominant form by which the 14-3-3 gene family had expanded. Moreover, seven critical amino acids were detected, which may contribute to functional divergence. Expression profiling analysis showed that BdGF14 genes were abundantly expressed in the roots, but showed low expression in the meristems. All seven BdGF14 genes showed significant expression changes under various abiotic stresses, including heavy metal, phytohormone, osmotic, and temperature stresses, which might play important roles in responses to multiple abiotic stresses mainly through participating in ABA-dependent signaling and reactive oxygen species mediated MAPK cascade signaling pathways. In particular, BdGF14 genes generally showed upregulated expression in response to multiple stresses of high temperature, heavy metal, abscisic acid (ABA), and salicylic acid (SA), but downregulated expression under H2O2, NaCl, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) stresses. Meanwhile, dynamic transcriptional expression analysis of BdGF14 genes under longer treatments with heavy metals (Cd2+, Cr3+, Cu2+, and Zn2+) and phytohormone (ABA) and recovery revealed two main expression trends in both roots and leaves: up-down and up-down-up expression from stress treatments to recovery. This study provides new insights into the structures and functions of plant 14-3-3 genes.									22	2	0	0	20	0	24			1664-462X			WOS:000380221800001	27507982

Controlled experiments show that the Cu-2(OH)(3)NO3 is developed from nanoparticles, ultrathin nanoplates to multilayered nanoplates with shape tips. Interestingly, the as-obtained Cu-2(OH)(3)NO3 with well-defined nanoplate structure exhibits outstanding catalytic degradation capability towards methyl orange (MO) in the dark at room temperature. Impressively, the Cu-2(OH)(3)NO3/ZnO composites display approximately 97% of MO decolorization within 20 min. Moreover, the Cu-2(OH)(3)NO3/ZnO composites also show excellent stability.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0009-2614	1873-4448		WOS:000507233300019

A direct molecular dynamics approach was found to create a network with too many like-atom bonds so that an indirect method via an h-BN random network is used. The resulting network possesses the local units of melems found in the crystalline g-C3N4 lattice. The networks have the electron affinity and ionization potential values compatible with photocatalytic water splitting. They are found to possess too many defects so that the band gap is smaller than found experimentally.

The effects of current density on the chemical composition, electrocatalytic activity, and stability of the composite anode material were investigated by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), anode polarization curves, quasi-stationary polarization (Tafel) curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Results reveal that the composite electrode obtained at 1 A/dm2 possesses the lowest overpotential (0.610 V at 500 A/m2) for oxygen evolution, the best electrocatalytic activity, the longest service life (360 h at 40 degC in 150 g/L H2SO4 solution under 2 A/cm2), and the lowest cell voltage (2.75 V at 500 A/m2). Furthermore, with increasing current density, the coating exhibits grain growth and the decrease of content of MnO2. Only a slight effect on crystalline structure is observed.

We present a detailed study on bipolar interfaces between anion exchange ionomer (AEI) based anode catalyst layers in direct contact with a PEM aiming to unravel influences of local pH, the water splitting bipolar interface and catalyst layer structure. It is conventionally accepted that AEIs used in anion exchange- and bipolar membrane water electrolysis conduct hydroxide anions and ensure a high pH environment in the catalyst layer. We have investigated the effect of different ionomers on the local pH at a metal surface and found a strong correlation with the pH of the surrounding solution rather than the ionomer type. Thus, solely the use of an AEI cannot maintain high pH. A study on BPEMWEs revealed strong indications for the co-existence of a water dissociating bipolar interface, and an acidic oxygen evolution mechanism. The superior performance compared to a PTE-based PEM water electrolyzer seems to stem from reduced contact resistances due to adhesive effects between the oppositely charged polymers. Our study shows that the bipolar approach can be utilized to make PTE-based electrolyzers competitive to commonly employed catalyst coated membranes.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000653212400001

A crucial step to define the fate of the plant facing an invading pathogen is the activation of a compatible Resistance (R) gene, the focus of the present review. Different aspects regarding R-genes and their products are discussed, including pathogen recognition mechanisms, signaling and effects on induced and constitutive defense processes, splicing and post transcriptional mechanisms involved. There are still countless challenges to the complete understanding of the mechanisms involving R-genes in plants, in particular those related to the interactions with other genes of the pathogen and of the host itself, their regulation, acting mechanisms at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, as well as the influence of other types of stress over their regulation. A magnification of knowledge is expected when considering the novel information from the omics and systems biology.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			1389-2037	1875-5550		WOS:000394385100002	27455974

The photocurrent of the electrodes prepared from laser-ablated particulates was increased compared to that from nonablated particulates. It was suggested that the increase of the photocurrents for the laser-ablated photocatalytic thin electrode should be attributed to the increase in the surface defect sites on the photocatalytic surface rather than the reduction of the particle size.

Pulverized PS was steadily injected into an externally-heated drop-tube laboratory furnace and burned therein in fuel-rich conditions, corresponding to a bulk equivalence ratio of approximately 2.5. Iso-kinetic and iso-axial sampling with a probe was performed at five different heights along the centerline of the furnace. The goal has been to investigate the evolution of fixed product gases, unburned light volatile organic compounds (VOC) and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC), with emphasis to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), along the reaction zone of the furnace. The magnitude of species therein and their respective trends were assessed. The centerline gas temperature was measured by suction thermometry. Moreover, the flow field and gas temperature distribution in the furnace were computed with a 3-dimensional model using the CFD code Fluent . Results showed that of the measured light VOC, acetylene exhibited the highest yields in the combustion effluent, followed by methane, ethylene and benzene. These yields were comparable to those of the most prevalent PAH species. PAH profiles varied somewhat in the sampling zone, with yields spanning the range between 13.8 mg (naphthalene) and 0.058 mg (perylene) per each gram of polystyrene burned. The results for fixed exhaust gases showed an increase in CO values with distance traveled, from 85 to 175 mg whereas CO 2 stayed close to 1000 mg, per gram of PS burned. Oxygen remained somewhat steady near 85 mg/g PS burned. Copious amounts of soot were generated and collected through the probe, 0.25-0.42 g for each gram of PS burned. Computations were conducted using a detailed chemical kinetic model, allowing for the prediction of formation and depletion of major PAH and soot particles of different sizes. In this computation styrene was input as the fuel. In comparing experimental hydrocarbon species concentrations to theoretical predictions, a large number of species were found to be within a factor of 7 or less.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000237425300006

The generally close similarity of ages and similar isotope geochemical characteristics of megacrysts and matrix minerals in the host kimberlites support a cognate origin. However, alteration rims commonly develop on zircon and ilmenite megacrysts, providing evidence for a lack of chemical equilibrium between the megacrysts and kimberlitic melts. Here, we report results of a detailed geochronological and geochemical study of zircon megacrysts found in the Middle Devonian Novolaspa kimberlite pipe and dyke located in the Azov Domain of the Ukrainian Shield. The concordia age of zircons is 397.0 +/- 2.0 Ma, and it is 14 m.y. older than the age of kimberlite emplacement as defined by a Rb-Sr isochron on phlogopite. The average epsilon Hf-(397) value for unaltered zircon megacrysts is 6.8 +/- 0.14, with the alteration rims having similar Hf isotope systematics. These hafnium isotope data indicate a moderately depleted mantle source for zircon. Unaltered megacrystic zircons have low abundances of trace elements and fractionated REE, with pronounced positive Ce/Ce* anomalies and almost no Eu/Eu* anomalies. In contrast, alteration rims have very high and variable concentrations of trace elements, indicating a reaction between zircon and kimberlite melt. The melt or fluid responsible for zircon and ilmenite megacryst formation, in contrast to kimberlitic melt, was poor in incompatible trace elements, except for the HFSE (Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, and Ti). The oxygen fugacity during crystallization of the megacryst suite was close to the FMQ buffer.Azov zircon megacrysts do not demonstrate close geochronological and isotope-geochemical similarities with their host kimberlites. They are cognate in the broad sense of being related to the same plume event, but their direct affinity is not clearly defined. The megacryst suite may have crystallized from the earliest melts/fluids that separated from the ascending mantle plume, whereas kimberlite magmas were emplaced 14 m.y. after this event.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0024-4937	1872-6143		WOS:000718124900001		
J	Westin, Gunnar; Pohl, Annika; Ottosson, Mikael; Lashgari, Koroush; Jansson, Kjell								All alkoxide route to manganate and coboltate perovskite films and powders: effects of processing parameters								JOURNAL OF SOL-GEL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				48	1-2			194	202		10.1007/s10971-008-1805-1				NOV 2008	2008	Manganate and cobaltate perovskites having the general formula ABO(3) have many technologically important applications. Here we present all alkoxide based routes to manganate and coboltate perovskite films and nano-phase powders of the compositions; LCMO (La0.67Ca0.33MnO3), LSMO (La0.75Sr0.25MnO3), LNCMO (La0.33Nd0.33Ca0.33MnO3), LBSMO (La0.75Ba0.125Sr0.125MnO3) and LSCO (La0.50Sr0.50CoO3). The Mn and Co (oxo) methoxy-ethoxide precursors were prepared by reaction of MnCl2 or CoCl2 with 2 Kmoe in methoxy-ethanol-toluene. After hydrolysis of the alkoxide solutions by atmospheric air all systems produced X-ray and electron diffraction amorphous gels of high elemental homogeneity, and the IR spectra showed that they consisted of hydrated oxo-carbonates. Heating in air resulted in similar weight-loss curves for all studied gels passing; loss of H2O in the range 20-300 degrees C, decomposition of carbonate groups into oxide and CO2 in the temperature range 300-700 degrees C, and in some cases loss of a small amount of oxygen in the temperature range 700-1,000 degrees C. The pure perovskites were obtained at 690-770 degrees C with heat rates of typically 5-20 degrees C min(-1) without annealing. Perovskites could also be obtained at 550 degrees C by annealing, but these perovskites are prone to be A-site ion inhomogeneous according to the TEM EDS studies, which was not the case for the perovskites heat-treated to at least the carbonate decomposition temperature. This A-site inhomogeneity is ascribed to sequential decomposition of carbonates due to their different thermal stabilities, which is probably a general feature also with other sol-gel precursors and low temperature annealing. High quality polycrystalline films were prepared on Si/SiO2/TiO2/Pt substrates with all compositions and high quality epitaxial films were prepared of LCMO (on 100 LaAlO3) and LSCO (on 100 SrTiO3). The colossal magneto resistance (CMR) of the epitaxial LCMO films of 32% (246 K) is in parity with PLD derived films. The conductivities of the epitaxial and polycrystalline LSCO films were 1.9 m Omega cm (on STO) and 1.7 m Omega cm (on alpha-Al2O3, respectively).					14th International Sol-Gel Conference14th International Sol-Gel Conference	SEP 02-07, 2007SEP 02-07, 2007	Int Sol Gel SocInt Sol Gel Soc	Montpellier, FRANCEMontpellier, FRANCE	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0928-0707	1573-4846		WOS:000259273400028		
J	Li, Yanxin; Tang, Shimiao; Sheng, Hongbin; Li, Can; Li, Haiyan; Dong, Bohua; Cao, Lixin								Multiple roles for LaFeO3 in enhancing the Photoelectrochemical performance of WO3								JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				629				598	609		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.09.090				JAN 2023	2023	For photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, constructing heterojunctions and loading co-catalysts are effective means to realizing sufficient light absorption, effective photogenerated carrier separation and fast charge transport. However, during implementation, the PEC performance of the catalyst is affected by both parasitic light absorption and reflection and the change in energy band structure due to the creation of new interfaces. Herein, in order to minimize the effect of recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs on the catalyst PEC performance due to the nascent interface arising from the cocatalyst compounding, WO3 and Ni/Co co-doped LaFeO3 (LFO) are constructed as heterojunctions, in which NiCo-LFO acts both as a part of the heterojunction to enhance photogenerated carrier separation and a co-catalyst to enhance the conductivity and modulate the surface state density at the catalystelectrolyte interface. The current density of NiCo-LFO/WO3 reaches 3.92 mA cm-2, which is more than 7 times that of LFO/WO3. This work provides a reference for the efficient water splitting of B-site doped, especially the co-doped perovskite oxide as multifunctional roles integrated with conventional photoelectrodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-9797	1095-7103		WOS:000870339300005	36179579

As the growing needs of the industrial applications in electrocatalyst, the increased occupational exposure and environmental releasing of NMs would be unavoidable. While, much efforts have been made to evaluate the ecological safety of such engineered NMs at unrealistically high concentrations, failed to provide the comprehensively guideline for exposure thresholds. To supplement the current knowledge gap, we testified the cytotoxicity of NiSe2/rGO nanocomposites with different surface defects under more realistic exposure mode. Compared with the short-term exposure and repetitive exposure, rat lung macrophages exhibited the augmented oxidative stress, dysfunction of mitochondria, damage of DNA and disorder of calcium homeostasis under the long-term NiSe2/rGO exposure. Noteworthily, no significant differences could be found between the NiSe2/rGO with different surface defects, indicated that the defect type of NMs were not the accurate predictor for real risk assessment. Collectively, the study provided the real potential toxic effects and exposure thresholds of NMs that might be highly possible industrial produced, and appealed the new insight for risk assessments of engineered NMs under the long-term exposure, which exhibited difference from the traditional evaluation of short-term and repetitive exposure.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000659037100005	33735765

Herein, we focus on the design of a cost-effective porous OER catalyst for efficient water to fuel conversion. A simple metal-ion-exchange protocol is adapted to implant electroactive metal centers in the mesoporous architecture of Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (ZSM-5). OER-active Ni is incorporated as catalytic sites in the mesoporous ZSM-5. Further, simultaneous incorporation of both Ni2+ and Cu2+ into the mesoporous ZSM-5 (Meso-Z) matrix significantly boost the OER catalytic activity. The optimization of Ni and Cu contents (1.04 wt % Ni and 0.44 wt % Cu) in the catalyst is found to be essential to achieve high catalytic activity. The Cu content influences the onset potential, and the Ni content determines the catalytic current during OER. Among developed catalysts, Ni2Cu1-Meso-Z offers the best performance even better than the state-of-art OER catalyst IrO2. Ni2Cu1-Meso-Z delivers a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 407 mV and exhibits a low Tafel slope of 55 mV/dec, a high electrochemical active surface area of 6.26, and a roughness factor of 89.42. Moreover, Ni2Cu1-Meso-Z retains 92% of its initial current density after 1000 potential cycles of a test run. The best performing Ni2Cu1- Meso-Z offers a faradic efficiency of 92%, whereas the state-of-the-art IrO2 efficiency was decreased by 22% under the similar experimental condition. Further, Ni2Cu1-Meso-Z-modffied anode exhibits better performance in its single cell than IrO2, in which Pt is used as cathode. The excellent OER catalytic activity of double-metal-ion-exchanged Meso-Z is attributed to the large surface area of mesoporous ZSM-5, hydrophilicity, fast diffusion of water molecules through the favorable interaction with Si- OH groups, and optimum binding and dissociation of different oxygeneous OER intermediates on the catalyst surface. Excellent current density and sustainable performance suggest that the double-metal-ion-exchanged mesoporous zeolite can serve as a potential candidate to improve the overall water splitting in the electrolyzer.									15	1	0	0	1	0	15			1932-7447			WOS:000433403400008

Photogenerated electron-hole pairs are effectively separated due to the increase of the thickness of the space charge layer after La-doping. The stable photocatalytic activity of the ZnO: GaN solid solution photocatalysts for overall water-splitting was remarkably enhanced by about 3.4 times when the La-doping concentration was 3% in atom ratio. The maximum apparent quantum efficiency of the La-doped (3% in atom percentage) ZnO: GaN solid solution photocatalyst for photocatalytic water oxidation was up to 14.5% at 350 nm without loading of any co-catalyst.									11	2	0	0	1	0	12			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000371177100011

Competitive Inhibitions of the Chlorophyll Synthase of Synechocystis sp Strain PCC 6803 by Bacteriochlorophyllide a and the Bacteriochlorophyll Synthase of Rhodobacter sphaeroides by Chlorophyllide a								JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY				192	1			198	207		10.1128/JB.01271-09				JAN 2010	2010	The photosynthetic growth of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 is hampered by exogenously added bacteriochlorophyllide a (Bchlide a) in a dose-dependent manner. The growth inhibition caused by Bchlide a, however, is relieved by an increased level of exogenously added chlorophyllide a (Chlide a). The results are explained by the competitive inhibition of chlorophyll synthase by Bchlide a, with inhibition constants (K(I)s) of 0.3 mM and 1.14 mM in the presence of sufficient geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) and phytyl pyrophosphate (PPP), respectively. Surprisingly, the bacteriochlorophyll synthase of Rhodobacter sphaeroides is inhibited competitively by Chlide a, with K(I)s of 0.54 mM and 0.77 mM in the presence of sufficient GGPP and PPP, respectively. Consistently, exogenously added Chlide a inhibits the metabolic conversion of exogenously added Bchlide a to bacteriochlorophyll a by an R. sphaeroides bchFNB-bchZ mutant that neither synthesizes nor metabolizes Chlide a. The metabolic inhibition by Chlide a, however, is relieved by the elevated level of Bchlide a. Thus, the chlorophyll synthase of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and the bacteriochlorophyll synthase of R. sphaeroides, both of which perform ping-pong-type reactions, are inhibited by Bchlide a and Chlide a, respectively. Although neither inhibitor is catalyzed by the target enzyme, inhibitions in the competitive mode suggest a structural similarity between their active sites.									12	0	0	0	10	0	12			0021-9193	1098-5530		WOS:000272636600022	19880605

Significantly larger grana membranes were produced with an increased synthesis of the entire photosystem II complex. These red-light-adapted membranes also contained two-dimensional crystals with a high frequency. Three different crystal forms of photosystem II were observed, providing the following data which further our understanding of the architecture of the native complex. (a) The oligomeric form of photosystem II in the membrane was monomeric in all crystal forms, but with a clear non-crystallographic pseudo-twofold symmetry. This was more apparent on the lumenal face of the complex. (b) The variability of unit cell contacts in different crystal forms implied that the peripheral light-harvesting antenna complex and the core of the complex were loosely connected. These peripheral subunits were predicted to rearrange so that they can either encircle the core complex or associate in parallel channels separated by lines of core complexes. (c) Grana membranes were found to retain a double-layered inside-out character, with a stromal face-to-stromal face packing. However, the presence of a crystal in one membrane did not necessarily impose crystallinity on its pair.									13	1	0	0	8	0	13			0014-2956			WOS:000084617300026	10601868

Although the ultrapotassic rocks display a range of K2O contents (0.9-8.4 wt %) that may partly reflect alteration processes, they display subduction-related trace element signatures characterized by significant enrichment of large ion lithophile elements and light rare earth elements relative to high field strength elements and heavy rare earth elements and depletion of Nb and Ta. However, their initial Nd-Sr isotope compositions plot within the mantle array. The nature of the mantle source of their parental magmas is inferred to be highly complex, involving contributions from several different components based on contrasting geochemical and isotopic features: (1) a depleted mantle source, which is indicated by unradiogenic Sr-87/(86)Sri (0.70449-0.70609) and radiogenic Nd-143/Nd-144(i) (0.51252-0.51269); (2) an obvious requirement of mantle phlogopite to explain the high potassium contents; (3) slab-derived fluids, which are indicated by ultra-low delta O-18(cpx) ratios regardless of the ultrapotassic rock type (2.4-5 parts per thousand), with high Ba/La and Nb/Ta, low Th/La and the most radiogenic Nd-143/Nd-144(i); (4) a contribution from subducted sediments giving rise to low Ce/Pb ratios and high Th contents; (5) the introduction of convective mantle into the source region with an asthenospheric Pb isotope signature. Whereas the differentiation of silica-undersaturated leucititic and lamprophyric magmas was driven by heteromorphic reactions, owing to the absence of major and trace element variations between the resultant rock types, the formation of silica-saturated trachytic rocks was the result of assimilation-fractional crystallization processes. We propose that a complex sequence of subduction events, starting from at least the Middle Triassic, caused metasomatism of the depleted mantle source and the generation of the Late Cretaceous ultrapotassic parental magmas, facilitated by slab roll-back followed by slab tearing.									32	0	0	0	1	0	32			0022-3530	1460-2415		WOS:000378042500005

Although much is known about the principal growth mechanisms of monometallic shaped nanocrystals, the anisotropic growth of shaped alloy nanocrystals is still poorly understood. Using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, we reveal an element-specific anisotropic growth mechanism of platinum (Pt) bimetallic nano-octahedra where compositional anisotropy couples to geometric anisotropy. A Pt-rich phase evolves into precursor nanohexapods, followed by a slower step-induced deposition of an M-rich (M = Ni, Co, etc.) phase at the concave hexapod surface forming the octahedral facets. Our finding explains earlier reports on unusual compositional segregations and chemical degradation pathways of bimetallic polyhedral catalysts and may aid rational synthesis of shaped alloy catalysts with desired compositional patterns and properties.									249	26	0	0	19	0	256			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000346536500061	25525243

The results thus obtained are compared with those for a pure Mg/Al layered double hydroxide. The spectra for the Pd-containing LDHs (particularly the strength of the bands) were found to depend on the particular palladium form present. As a rule, the mid-infrared spectra contained a strong, broad band at 3800-2500 cm(-1) due to stretching vibrations of the different types of hydroxyl groups present in the solids and another signal at ca. 1370 cm(-1) due to the presence of carbonate ions in the interlayer region. These signals were the strongest in the near-infrared spectra, which were also quite similar, roughly, for all solids. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, the polyaniline is coated on the outer surface of N-doped graphene hollow spheres (NGHS), which can further form the N-doped carbide (CNx) through the high temperature calcination process. The prepared CNx decorated N-doped graphene hollow spheres (CNx-NGHS) could enhance the conductivity of substrate material caused by the doping of N atoms, and the stretchy 3D hollow structure can prevent the deformation and collapse of fabricated electrode catalyst during the charge/ discharge processes. Furthermore, the doped N atoms, acting as active sites, could facilitate the nucleation and growth of the core/shell metals/oxides nanoparticles on the surface of the CNx-NGHS, and at the same time enhance the interaction between metals/oxides nanoparticles and CNx-NGHS, both of which are helpful for promoting the electrocatalytic activity. Based on the investigation results, it can be concluded that CNx-NGHS loaded Co/CoO core/shell nanoparticles (Co/CoO/CNx-NGHS) show obvious better bifunctional electrocatalytic performance than that of CNx-NGHS supported Ni/NiO core/shell nanoparticles (Ni/NiO/CNx-NGHS). The synthesized Co/CoO/CNx-NGHS presents the lowest Delta E (similar to 0.728) (Delta E= E-j10-E-1/2), which indicates the better bifunctional electrocatalytic activity. The ZAB equipped with the Co/CoO/CNx NGHS catalyst can deliver a maximum power density of 117 mW cm(-2), which is larger than that of commercial 10% Pt/C (95 mW cm(-2)). The specific capacity of the Co/CoO/CNx-NGHS at both 100 and 200 mA cm(-2) can reach similar to 99% of the theoretical capacity (824 mAh g(-1)). Moreover, a minimum visible voltage loss can be seen for the synthesized Co/CoO/CNx-NGHS after cycled for 100 h, indicating the good durability and stability. All investigated results demonstrated that the outperformance of the fabricated Co/ CoO/CNx-NGHS catalyst makes it a potential choice to replace the noble metal/carbon-based materials.

It is commonly known that electrocatalytic performance can be enhanced by controlling composition, size, and surface morphology. In addition, precisely controlling the atomic arrangement inside NCs can improve performance, with their electronic structures being optimized via interfacial coupling. In this review, we summarize recent advances in atomic arrangement engineering approaches of metallic NCs. First, we introduce thermodynamic and kinetic principles to provide a basic understanding on atomic structure-property correlations. Then, several representative cases of atomic ordering and planar stacking engineering are highlighted for different electrocatalytic processes. Finally, perspectives on the roles of calculations, characterization, and practical applications are outlined.									104	8	0	0	4	0	105			2542-4351			WOS:000465149000012

The alteration zone associated with the deposit is atypical, as it consists predominantly of muscovite rather than the chlorite and muscovite commonly found in the other basement-hosted deposits of the Athabasca basin.The preore stage consists of early minor clinochlore alteration at temperatures of about 275 degrees C, interpreted to result from retrograde metamorphism of the basement rocks prior to the deposition of the Athabasca basin. This clinochlore event is followed by all extensive 1Mc muscovite alteration of the basement rocks by Na-K-Fe-rich basinal brines at temperatures of about 250 degrees C, creating tip to 25 percent void space in the basement rocks. Subsequently, a weak chamoisite alteration resulted from Fe-Mg-Ca-rich fluids with temperatures of about 300 degrees C that evolved from reactions between the basinal brines and the basement rocks. Ore stage uraninite has an extrapolated chemical age of 1590 Ma and is contemporaneous with synore 1Mc muscovite and it-oil oxide deposited at temperatures near 250 degrees C from fluids with similar delta O-18 but lower delta D values to preore basinal fluids. The low delta D values indicate postdepositional exchange of H isotopes with Cenozoic fluids. Postore alteration consists of dravite and sudoite precipitated from Mg-Ca rich fluids, from the same evolved basinal brines that precipitated preore chamoisite, at temperatures of about 185 degrees C, filling voids created during the preore stage. Our results indicate that the pre- and synore minerals were formed dominantly by basinal fluids, with no contribution from basement fluids, which differ from some, other basement-host deposits in the Athabasca basin where basement-derived fluid influx was more significant.Several U-Pb and Ar-Ar resetting events recorded oil preore muscovite and on uraninite are coincident with fluid flow induced by distal orogenies, remobilizing radiogenic Pb from the deposit. The radiogenic Pb remobilization events were not widespread as the presence of radiogenic Pb is restricted to basement rocks proximal to the deposit and along the unconformity.									57	1	0	0	0	0	58			0361-0128	1554-0774		WOS:000272008900004

The first electron density map of the Mn cluster derived from X-ray diffraction measurements of single crystals of photosystem II at 3.8-4.2 Angstrom resolution has also appeared this year. This wealth of new information has provided significant insight into the structure or the inorganic core (Mn4OxCa1Cl1-2), the Mn oxidation states. and the location and function of the essential Ca2+ cofactor within the water-oxidizing complex (WOC). We summarize these advances and provide a unified interpretation of debated structural proposals and Mn oxidation states, based on an integrated analysis of the published data, particularly from Mn X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and EPR/ENDOR data. Only three magnetic spin-exchange models for the inter-manganese interactions are possible from consideration of the EPR data for the S-0, S-1, S-2 and S-N (NO-reduced) states. These models fall into one of three types denoted butterfly, funnel, or tetrahedron. A revised set of eight allowed chemical structures for the Mn4Ox core can be deduced that are shown to be consistent with both EPR and XAS. The popular "dimer-of-dimers" structural model is not compatible with the possible structural candidates. EPR data have identified two inter-manganese couplings that are sensitive to the S-state. suggesting two possible bridging sites for substrate water molecules. Spin densities derived from Mn-55 hyperfine data together with Mn K-edge energies from Ca-depleted samples provide an internally consistent assignment for the Mn oxidation states of Mn-4(3III,IV) for the S-2 state. EPR and XAS data also provide a consistent picture, locating Ca2+ as an integral part of the inorganic core. probably via shared bridging ligands with Mn (aqua/hydroxo/carboxylato/chloro). XAS data reveal that the Ca2+ Cofactor increases the Mn(1s --> 4p) transition energy by 0.6-1 eV with minimal structural perturbation versus the Ca-depleted WOC. Thus, calcium binding appears to increase the Mn-ligand covalency by increasing electron transfer from shared ligands to Mn. suggesting a direct role for Ca2+ in substrate water oxidation. Consideration of both the XAS and the EPR data, together with reactivity studies on two model complexes that evolve O-2, suggest two favored structure types as feasible models for the reactive S-4 state that is precursor to the O-2 evolution step. These are a calcium-capped "cuboidal" core and a calcium-capped "funnel" core.									196	3	0	0	71	0	196			0949-8257	1432-1327		WOS:000173024100002	11862536

Field investigations, zircon geochronology, mineral and whole-rock elemental and isotopic compositions constrain the nature of the parental magma as well as the physical conditions of emplacement, age of crystallization and tectonic setting of formation of the TUMC. The Complex consist of wehrlite and olivine-hornblende clinopyroxenite crosscut by hornblende gabbros and minor dikes/veins of diorite and granite. Hornblendites formed mainly at the contact between the olivine-hornblende clinopyroxenite and the intrusive hornblende gabbros by reaction-replacement processes. Geochemical data for both the wehrlites and pyroxenites define a trend with dominantly olivine and clinopyroxene accumulation, whereas a second trend is formed by hornblende gabbros that differentiated to leucocratic rocks, with amphibole as the dominant fractionating mafic phase. The trace elements show enrichment in large-ion lithophile elements, depletion in high field strength elements (Nb, Zr, Ti) and P, and enrichment in Pb, Sr and Ba relative to primitive mantle, indicating subduction-related parental liquids. The Nd and Sr isotopic composition suggests a uniform mantle source metasomatized by subducted crustal components. Thermobarometric estimations constrain emplacement and crystallization at intermediate to shallow continental crust levels (~& nbsp;12.5 km depth) of hydrated basaltic melt under oxygen fugacity conditions above the nickel-nickel oxide buffer (delta NNO = 0 to 2). Zircon SHRIMP U-Th-Pb age data constrain crystallization at 75.1-76.0 Ma, with scarce inherited zircons that record limited recycling of the Cordillera Real basement. These results confirm magmatic arc activity at the continental margin of South America during the late Cretaceous as a result of an E-dipping subduction zone prior to the accretion of the Ecuadorian-Colombian-Caribbean oceanic plateau, and support simultaneous double subduction at the northwest margin of South America during the Cretaceous.

Bovine serum albumin (BSA) served as the exfoliant to rapidly produce high concentrations of the hybrid by simply stirring on a desk top stirrer without any specialized equipment. The reactor is amenable for continuous flow, allowing for scale-up to produce large quantities, 24/7, with minimal human intervention. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicated the coexistence of both MoS2 and graphene nanosheets in a majority of flakes. The Raman spectra indicated low defect, 3-4 layer graphene sheets with very low oxidation levels, as well as 4-8 layer MoS2 flakes. The exfoliation mechanism was studied as a function of the concentrations of bulk MoS2, graphite, protein, as well as the stirring speed, pH, and temperature. The reaction orders with respect to these parameters were determined. Temperature dependence data indicated a thermal energy barrier of 19.1 kJ/mol, but the rpm dependence gave an extremely low shear energy barrier of 22.2 nJ/mol. One unique insight gained here is that the lateral destacking of the platelets via translational excitation induced by stirring populates higher translational states in the direction along the solvent flow. Thus, stirring is very efficient in destacking the platelets at a low energy cost, a mechanism for efficient exfoliation of two-dimensional materials. The cyclic voltammograms of the MoS2/Gr hybrid with a 1:13 mole ratio showed enhanced oxygen reduction activities, nearly double that of Gr nanosheets or similar to 25-fold that of MoS2 nanosheets, and vastly higher than those of both the bulk phases. The hybrid with a 1:13 mole ratio was used to fabricate flexible, functional, and bioabsorbable/biodegradable Zn-air batteries with high open circuit voltages (1.4 V) and high specific energy of up to 130 W h kg(-1), establishing practical applications of the hybrids over the individual nanosheets.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2574-0970		WOS:000711030600041

These properties enable g-CN working as a sensing signal transducer with multiple output modes. In this review, state-of-the-art sensing applications of tailored g-CN nanostructures in the recent years are presented. Initially, g-CN nanoarchitectures featuring large surface areas, abundance of active sites, and high dispersity in water are presented along with their preparation methods. Then, sensing applications of these g-CN nanoarchitectures are described in sequence of the immobilization of recognition elements; semiconductor and electron donating properties derive signaling transduction modes, and efficient approaches for improving sensing performances.

Super P carbon cathodes (on stainless steel current collectors) were subjected to single discharges at various applied currents (50 mu A, 100 mu A, 250 mu A) using either a sulfolane/LiTFSI or TEGDME/LITFSI electrolyte. The morphologies of the discharge product were noted to be different for each electrolyte while there was also a clear variation with respect to applied current. Finally, the impact of adding 25% (by weight) Pd nanoparticle catalysts to the cathodes was investigated. The results obtained show clearly that the nature of discharge products for Li-O-2 battery cathodes are strongly dependent on applied current, electrolyte choice and the addition of a catalyst material.

Upon transformation and segregation at low light intensity (5 mu E m(-2) sec(-1)), a PSI deletion strain was obtained that is light tolerant and grows reasonably well under photoheterotrophic conditions at 5 mu E m(-2) sec(-1) (doubling time similar to 28 hr). Subsequent inactivation of apcE by an erythromycin resistance marker led to reduction of the phycobilin-to-chlorophyll ratio and to a further decrease in light sensitivity. The resulting PSI-less/apcE(-) strain grew photoheterotrophically at normal light intensity (50 mu E m(-2) sec(-1)) with a doubling time of 18 hr. Deletion of apcE in the wild type resulted in slow photoautotrophic growth. The remaining phycobilins in apcE(-) strains were inactive in transferring light energy to PSII. Cells of both the PSI-less and PSI-less/apcE(-) strains had an approximately sixfold enrichment of PSII an a chlorophyll basis and were as active in oxygen evolution (on a per PSII basis) as the wild type at saturating light intensity. Both PSI-less strains described here are highly appropriate both for detailed PSII studies and as background strains to analyze site- and region-directed PSII mutants in vivo.									189	6	2	0	173	0	200			1040-4651	1532-298X		WOS:A1993MQ48600015	8305875

This study uses the state-of-the-art carbon-rich atmosphere models and improved atomic and molecular line lists in the 2.3 mu m region. Significantly lower F abundances are obtained in comparison to previous studies in the literature. This difference is mainly due to molecular blends. In the case of carbon stars of SC-type, differences in the model atmospheres are also relevant. The new F enhancements are now in agreement with the most recent theoretical nucleosynthesis models in low-mass AGB stars, solving the long-standing problem of F in Galactic AGB stars. Nevertheless, some SC-type carbon stars still show larger F abundances than predicted by stellar models. The possibility that these stars are of larger mass is briefly discussed.									59	0	0	0	0	0	59			2041-8205			WOS:000278591800007

The introduction of high-entropy alloys with entropy-stabilization features has shown high potential for various functional applications in recent years. By considering these two types of materials, we developed a high-entropy oxynitride for photocatalytic water splitting. The material, with a general composition of TiZrHfNbTaO6N3 and a d(0) electronic configuration, showed a narrow bandgap of 1.6 eV, which is much lower than the bandgaps of relevant binary and high-entropy oxides. The material exhibited photocurrent generation and photocatalytic hydrogen production with high chemical stability, suggesting the high potential of high-entropy oxynitrides as advanced low-bandgap and stable photocatalysts.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000667703900001

The phase composition and microstructure evolution were studied through examining the surficial and cross-sectional oxide layer by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The oxidized surfaces were covered by scattered TiO2 particles, a continuous B2O3 layer, a B2O3-Al2O3 layer or a mullite layer depending on the oxidation temperature. The thickness of the oxide layer increased from 10 to 30 mum as the oxidation temperature increased from 900 to 1300 degC. The analysis of the weight gain data revealed that the parabolic rate constant of melt-infiltrated SiC-TiB2 ceramic composites generally increased from 4.05 times 10-3 to 3.16 times 10-1 mg2/cm4/s, accompanied with a changed oxidation nature from parabolic to cubic, as oxidation temperature increased from 500 to 1300 degC. Formation of continuous B2O3 or Al2O3-based (Al2O3-B2O3 or Al2O3-SiO2) layer were identified on the surface of SiC-TiB2 ceramic composites after being oxidized at 700-1300 degC, which was responsible for the excellent oxidation resistance of such composites. The oxidation rate of the melt-infiltrated SiC-TiB2 ceramic composites was controlled by reaction rate of the composites at 500 degC and diffusion rate of oxygen through continuous B2O3 or Al2O3-based layer to the unaffected composites at 700-1300 degC.

Here, multivoids-assembled hierarchically meso-macroporous nanospheres based on VPO4 encapsulated in porous carbon (MVHP-VPO4@C NSs) were designed and fabricated. This unique structure can evidently decrease the excessive interior space in hollow spheres or multishelled hollow spheres to gain high volumetric energy density and at the same time can alleviate the large mechanical strain during the cycling process. As expected; MVHP-VPO4@C NSs show good lithium storage behavior with gravimetric discharge capacity of 628 mAh g(-1) after 1.00 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). Furthermore, the full cell (LiFePO4 cathode//MVHP-VPO4@C NSs anode) also exhibits outstanding lithium storage performance. The insight obtained from this structure may provide guidance for the design of other electrode materials experiencing large volume variation during the lithiation-delithiation process.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000392458300029	27996243

Qi, H; Zhao, B		Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis of the structural characteristics of Fluidized Bed Gasification Fly Ash								CLEANER COMBUSTION AND SUSTAINABLE WORLD								447	452						2012	2012	Previous experiments using thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) concluded a high carbon fly ash obtained from a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) gasifier by firing an anthracite coal to be less reactive compared to other high ash content chars that were prepared under laboratory conditions in a drop tube furnace (DTF) from a parent bituminous coal. This fly ash had internal surface (BET) area and pore volume of an order of magnitude larger than the laboratory prepared chars and so a further investigation was carried out by determining the influence of the fly ash residence time (10-20s) in the CFB on its structural ordering.The structural analysis was carried out by using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Raman spectroscopy with a 457.9nm laser, was used to compare the structural ordering of the fly ash carbon with those of its parent (anthracite) coal; a char prepared from the same parent coal at the same heat treatment temperature as the fly ash but under laboratory conditions; and the other chars prepared from a bituminous parent coal (under laboratory conditions) whose reactivities were found to be higher than the fly ash. It was concluded that the long residence times enhanced the decomposition of the anthracite coal, consumption of the amorphous carbon and the ordering of aromatic units and the crystalline structure as gasification progressed.The structural behavior of fly ash was also investigated after different conversions in DTF through reactions with oxygen at 5% and 20% concentration at a temperature of 1300 degrees C. At low residence times, the fly ash became less ordered due to further decomposition and release of loose organic matrix and after longer residence time the fly ash then became more ordered due to aromatic ring growth.XRD experiments were used to validate the structural analysis result from Raman spectroscopy. The results concluded fly ash and a laboratory char prepared at high temperature to be the most ordered. There was also the linear relationship between the volatile content of the chars including the fly ash when compared with their structural parameters.					7th International Symposium on Coal Combustion (ISCC)7th International Symposium on Coal Combustion (ISCC)	JUL 17-20, 2011JUL 17-20, 2011	Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; China Int Culture Exchange Ctr; Tsinghua Univ; Harbin Inst Technol; Tsinghua Univ, Inst Thermal EngnNatl Nat Sci Fdn China; China Int Culture Exchange Ctr; Tsinghua Univ; Harbin Inst Technol; Tsinghua Univ, Inst Thermal Engn	Harbin Inst Technol, Combust Engn Res Inst, Harbin, PEOPLES R CHINAHarbin Inst Technol, Combust Engn Res Inst, Harbin, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-3-642-30444-6	WOS:000398884500094

High nitrate concentration in the water systems negatively impact human health and the environment. Excessive nitrate content in the aquatic environment led to a decrease in water quality, which can be evaluated from changes in color, odor, increased turbidity, and reduced levels of dissolved oxygen. Denitrification as a biological method of tackling nitrate pollution has been studied since three decades ago in various systems, including recent investigations into bioelectrochemical systems. Bioelectrochemical cells are driven by microorganisms in carrying out oxidation/reduction reactions such as denitrification. However, the popularity of BES is still low. This study aim to optimize the source of carbon as substrate in culture media for the system and compare the efficiency of nitrate elimination and denitrification rate among isolates and culture conditions. Axenic cultures of Pseudomonas entomophila and Acinetobacter oleivorans were done in 20 mL single-chambered Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MECs) equipped with graphite as anode and stainless steel mesh as cathode. Sodium acetate and sodium bicarbonate was used as carbon sources in the formulation of heterotrophic and mixotrophic media. Denitrification performance in bioelectrochemical cells was evaluated from the evolution of nitrate concentration in the medium and the growth of target microorganisms. Environmental isolates presented similar behavior on the medium supplemented with bicarbonate by reaching 68-69% maximum nitrate removal efficiency across all experiments, suggesting inability to carry out autotrophic denitrification. On the other hand, Pseudomonas aeruginosa reached 78% efficiency on acetate-only medium, suggesting a preference towards acetate as carbon source over bicarbonate. Environmental isolates presented an interesting potential of tolerating the potential inhibitory effects of sodium bicarbonate in the medium compared to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which demonstrated inhibitory effects in this medium.					4th International Tropical Renewable Energy Conference (i-TREC) - Sustainable Energy and Environment for Tropical Climate4th International Tropical Renewable Energy Conference (i-TREC) - Sustainable Energy and Environment for Tropical Climate	AUG 14-16, 2019AUG 14-16, 2019	Univ Indonesia, Fac Engn, Tropical Renewable Energy CtrUniv Indonesia, Fac Engn, Tropical Renewable Energy Ctr	Bali, INDONESIABali, INDONESIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0094-243X		978-0-7354-2014-4	WOS:000651588100037

However, their current exploration remains empirical to a large extent. Elucidating the correlations between electronic properties and catalytic activity is crucial for deriving general and straightforward catalyst design principles. Herein, strongly correlated electronic systems with abundant and easily tunable electronic properties, namely La1-xSrxBO3 perovskites and La2-xSrxBO4 layered perovskites (B = Fe, Co, Ni, or Mn), were employed as model systems to identify favorable electronic structures for water oxidation. We established a direct correlation between the enhancement of catalytic activity and the insulator to metal transition through tuning the electronic properties of the target perovskite families via the La3+/Sr2+ ratio. Their improved photochemical water oxidation performance was clearly linked to the increasingly metallic character. These electronic structure-activity relations provide a promising guideline for constructing efficient water oxidation catalysts.									24	1	0	0	3	0	24			0002-7863			WOS:000370215400013	26771537

The mineralization is of the Bolivian polymetallic vein (BPV) type, with a significant amount of the gold reserves contained in the oxide cap.Field and microscopic studies, K-Ar dating, delta(34)S values of pyrite, alunite and jarosite, and delta(18)O values of alunite and jarosite demonstrate that some of this gold is supergene. Two types of supergene gold are present: minute gold grains, 1 to 10 microns across, of high fineness and associated with jarosite and iron oxy-hydroxides; and 'invisible' gold, which is probably sorbed onto minerals such as jarosite and iron oxy-hydroxides.Pyrite delta(34)S values fall in the limited range -3.5 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand, consistent with a magmatic origin. Sulfate delta(34)S values are homogeneous and overlap closely with those of pyrite (-1.2 +/- 2.l parts per thousand), which supports petrographic evidence that sulfates replaced pyrite. By contrast, sulfate delta(18)O values are inhomogeneous with a large range (alunite +2 to 26 parts per thousand, jarosite -5 to +18 parts per thousand). These data are interpreted as reflecting kinetically controlled reactions involving various proportions of atmospheric oxygen and local meteoric water. This is typical of supergene alteration and is due to the seasonally dry climate of the Altiplano.The oxide-zone mineralogy is dominated by sulfates and iron oxy-hydroxide minerals with some phosphates and halides, which indicates that the groundwaters were acidic, oxidizing and relatively saline. Under these conditions the most likely complexes responsible for gold mobilization are halides.Geological data and K-Ar ages indicate that oxidation of the BPV deposits began at least around 11 Ma and possibly up to 15 Ma ago, and that supergene alteration lasted until around 4 Ma. During this period, erosion was minimal. Although supergene processes have been active on the Bolivian Altiplano since the Middle Miocene, in contrast to Northern Chile, enrichment of gold has not occurred.

J	Rummel, Felix; O'Malley, Patrick J.					O'Malley, Patrick/0000-0002-1933-3740			How Nature Makes O2: an Electronic Level Mechanism for Water Oxidation in Photosynthesis								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B											10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c06374		OCT 2022			2022	In this paper, we combine broken symmetry density functional calculations and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis to obtain the electronic structure of the penultimate S3 state of nature's water-oxidizing complex and determine the electronic pathway of O-O bond formation. Analysis of the electronic structure changes along the reaction path shows that two spin crossovers, facilitated by the geometry and magnetism of the water-oxidizing complex, are used to provide a unique low-energy pathway. The pathway is facilitated via the formation and stabilization of the [O2]3- ion. This ion is formed between ligated deprotonated substrate waters, O5 and O6, and is stabilized by antiferromagnetic interaction with the Mn ions of the complex. Combining the computational, crystallographic, and spectroscopic data, we show that an equilibrium exists between the O5 oxo and O6 hydroxo forms with an S = 3 spin state and a deprotonated O6 form containing a two-center one-electron bond in [O5O6]3- which we identify as the form detected using crystallography. This form corresponds to an S = 6 spin state which we demonstrate gives rise to a low-intensity EPR spectrum compared with the accompanying S = 3 state, making its detection via EPR difficult and overshadowed by the S = 3 form. Simulations using 70% of the S = 6 component give rise to a superior fit to the experimental W-band EPR spectral envelope compared with an S = 3 only form. Analyses of the most recent X-ray emission spectroscopy first moment changes for solution and time-resolved crystal data are also shown to support the model. The computational, crystallographic, and spectroscopic data are shown to coalesce to the same picture of a predominant S = 6 species containing the first one-electron oxidation product of two water molecules, that is, [O5O6]3-. Progression of this form to the two-electron-oxidized peroxo and three-electron-oxidized superoxo forms, leading eventually to the evolution of triplet O2, is proposed to be the pathway nature adopts to oxidize water. The study reveals the key electronic, magnetic, and structural design features of nature's catalyst which facilitates water oxidation to O2 under ambient conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000874484400001	36206029

Herein, phosphorylated polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) photoanodes were developed and showed enhanced photocurrent densities for solar water splitting. A photocatalytic efficiency of 120 mu A cm(-2) was achieved in the basic solution (1.0 m NaOH) without sacrificial agents. In this system, phosphates were ionically anchored on the surface of PCN, and the modified films showed significantly increased density of valence electrons, and thus promoting photocatalytic efficiency.									34	3	0	0	2	0	34			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000478761200015	30773848

Progesterone increases photochemical efficiency of photosystem II in wheat under heat stress by facilitating D1 protein phosphorylation								PHOTOSYNTHETICA				55	4			664	670		10.1007/s11099-016-0681-0				DEC 2017	2017	Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of exogenous progesterone on photochemical efficiency of PSII and turnover of D1 protein under heat stress during the grain-filling stage. Heat stress resulted in increases of hydrogen peroxide production, malondialdehyde content, and relative electrolytic leakage in wheat leaves, but these responses were alleviated by foliar application of progesterone. Meanwhile, activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase were significantly improved in progesterone-pretreated leaves. Along with the alleviation of oxidative stress, higher abundances of STN8 and phosphorylated D1 protein and lower total D1 protein content in the PSII reactive center were observed in progesterone-pretreated leaves relative to controls. Consequently, progesterone raised the potential photochemical efficiency, actual photochemical efficiency, and electron transfer rate. These results indicate that foliar application of progesterone can effectively alleviate heat-induced PSII damage by enhancing antioxidant capability and regulating phosphorylation of D1 protein in wheat leaves.									9	1	0	0	4	1	9			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000406019100012

Characteristics of the organic structure in bitumen deduced from the pyrolytic products and given by H-1/C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry were compared as well. The oil sand sample was pyrolyzed at temperatures from 300 to 650 degrees C in intervals of 50 degrees C in an inert atmosphere (helium gas), and more than 200 types of compounds were detected, including carbon dioxide, aliphatics (alkanes, cycloalkanes, olefins, dialkenes, cycloolefins), aromatics (alkyl benzenes, alkyl naphthalenes, alkyl indenes), oxygen-containing compounds, and sulfur containing compounds. From the evolution of the product yields, it was clearly observed that temperature affected both the primary and secondary reactions during fast pyrolysis. Major thermal cracking took place until about 400 degrees C, as evidenced by a dramatic increase in product species and yields. However, temperatures higher than 600 degrees C were beneficial for generating smaller molecules as products. Among the pyrolytic products, alkanes and olefins were predominant and were mainly derived from the thermal cracking of abundant polymethylene substituents linking to the aromatic cores. It was found that the yields of alkanes and olefins decreased with increasing carbon number, and more olefins were generated at higher temperatures. Monoaromatics with more alkyl or alkenyl multisubstituent groups appeared above 400 degrees C, but the substituent groups were no longer than isopropyl. In the range of 300-650 degrees C, few polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were observed. Higher temperatures also obviously enriched the species of naphthalene, indene, and compounds with heteroatoms. In addition, the raw aliphatic sulfur in the sample tended to be converted into sulfur-containing heterocycles during fast pyrolysis in an inert atmosphere. The results of this study show that both the NMR and Py-GC/MS methods can provide information on the organic structures in oil sand. However, NMR spectrometry is able to present an overview of the structure of hydrocarbons, whereas Py-GC/MS can help to deduce some characteristics of the macromolecules in oil sand organics.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000394560900027

After heat treatment, the plated alloys act as effective electrocatalytic materials by lowering the hydrogen overpotential sufficiently. The improved electrocatalytic activity is due to an increase in effective surface area, a change in surface features upon heat treatment, and the presence of traces of platinum. Electrodes of the plated alloys are stable even in a highly corrosive electrolytic medium (6 M KOH). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The BC-TiO2NTA was characterized using SEM, TEM, BET, mercury intrusion porosimetry, XPS, XRD, CV, and LSV. The BC-TiO2NTA had reserved pore structure, formed mesopores, specific and electroactive surface areas of 2.01 m2 g-1 and 9.32 cm2 cm-2, respectively. The oxygen evolution potential was 2.61 V vs. SCE. CBZ could be degraded by %OH, SO4%- and O2%- on BC-TiO2NTA in accordance to pseudo-first-order kinetic, which was greatly enhanced in flow-through mode. The optimal kinetic rate constant of CBZ degradation of 0.403 min-1 was achieved at 3 mA cm-2, while energy consumption per order was 0.086 kW h m-3. The mineralization efficiency and mineralization current efficiency were 50.8 % and 9.5 % at 180 min, respectively. The presence of Cl- (0.3-3 mM) accelerated electrochemical degradation of CBZ, while NO3- (0.1-2 mM) inhibited the reaction. Based on density functional theory calculation and UPLC-Orbitrap-MS/MS measurement, we found that electrochemical degradation of CBZ was initialized by cleavage of -CONH2 group and attack of %OH on the olefinic double bond of the central heterocyclic ring.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000593834900004

Electroactivity of the alloys toward HER increased with the increasing content of Fe up to about 90 wt.%, however also increased tendency to pitting corrosion during cathodic polarization. After anodic polarization or corrosion at OCP, cathodic curves of high-Fe materials exhibited a peak which was followed by significant current rise. The peak was ascribed to the reduction of oxide products to metals. It was suggested that the current rise was associated with the formation of active intermediates of freshly-electrodeposited metal-adsorbed hydroxides. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein we have fabricated (NiFe)S-2 pyrite mesocrystals in the form of nearly-single crystalline porous cubes, and studied their self-optimization to realize efficient activity toward water oxidation under electrochemical conditions. The growth mechanism of the mesocrystals was a non-classical mechanism, which was initiated by the formation of a large quantity of small nickel sulfide clusters, followed by the aggregation and transformation of these small clusters in an oriented manner. When these mesocrystals were tested for water oxidation under electrocatalytic conditions, the materials served as pre-catalysts and immediately self-optimized to form amorphous S-doped metal (oxy) hydroxides, which are the real catalytically active materials. As a result, the observed overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) on glassy carbon electrodes was less than 260 mV. The growth mechanism studied here may provide opportunities for constructing intricate sulfide structures, and the self-optimization process during water oxidation can inspire new thoughts on electrocatalysis.									46	4	0	0	2	0	46			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000431100300014	29732061

The electrocleaning caused a morphological change: the fine polyps on the electrode surface disappeared due to the place-exchange process and the Pt hydrous oxide was converted to Pt metal. Eventually, after a sufficient electrocleaning process, the surface roughness of the platinized-Ti electrode was greatly reduced and its surface crystallinity was enhanced.

SEM images and XRD results indicated that Ce-PbO2/ZrO2 composite electrodes have compact structure and fine grain size. Ce-PbO2/ZrO2 composite electrode has higher oxygen evolution overpotential and stability than Ce-PbO2 electrode. The service life of Ce-PbO2/ZrO2 composite electrode reaches 318 h, which is 4.2 times as that of Ce-PbO2 electrodes (74 h). The novel Ce-PbO2/ZrO2 composite electrode was employed as anode to decontaminate acridine orange (AO) by electrochemical oxidization methods. The effect of initial concentration of AO, current density, and initial pH values on the removal ratio of AO were analyzed. The results showed that AO could be completely removed after 90 min electrolysis under the optimal condition: initial AO concentration was 30 mg L-1, current density was 50 mA cm(-2), and the initial pH value was 5.0. Moreover, the possible degradation pathway of AO was elucidated based on the identification of stable byproducts generated during the electrochemical degradation process by HPLC-MS, which revealed that AO and its byproducts could be effectively eliminated and mineralized into CO2, H2O, ammonium and nitrate ions.									56	8	0	0	17	0	63			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000449125800016	30179785

F doping into NNO crystals yields little band gap reduction of the system. Although N doping can significantly reduce band gap and enhance the visible light response of the system, presence of the localized unoccupied states above Fermi level in forbidden zone may promote the electron-hole recombination and possibly result in a poor photoconversion efficiency. A favorable improvement is achieved with N and F codoping, which yields not only an uncontaminated forbidden band but also the significantly narrowed band gap suitable for visible light absorption. Moreover, the band edge positions of various codoped systems are also suitable for the overall water splitting. The calculated formation energy indicates that N doping becomes more feasible in the presence of F due to charge balance. So, the (N, F) pairs codoping can be justified for improving the visible light driven photoactivity of NNO. The effects of concentration and separation of dopants on the photocatalytic performances are also investigated.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1434-6028	1434-6036		WOS:000462945100001

The lavas and pumices studied are hornblende-plagioclase andesites with average Pre-eruptive temperatures of similar to 840 degrees C and fO(2) of 1.5-2.1 log units above nickel-nickel oxide (NNO). Plogioclase zoning includes oscillatory and patchy zonation and sieve textures. Hornblendes are commonly unzoned, but some show simple, multiple or patchy zoning. Apatite microphenocrysts display normal and reverse zoning of sulphur. The textural similarity of patchy hornblende and plagioclase, together With Ba-Sr systematics in patchy plagioclase, indicate that the cores of these crystals were derived from cumulate material. Plagioclase-liquid equilibria suggest that the patchy texture develops by resorption during H2O-undersaturated decompression. When H2O-saturated crystallization recommences at lower pressure, reduced pH(2)O results in lower X-An in plagioclase, causing more Al-rich hornblende to crystallize. Plogioclase cores with diffuse oscillatory zoning, and unzoned hornblende crystals, probably represent a population of crystals resident in the magma chamber for long periods of time. In contrast, oscillatory Zoning in the rims of plagioclase phenocrysts may reflect eruption dynamics during decompression crystallization. Increasing Fe/Al in oscillatory zoned rims suggests oxidation as a result of degassing of H2O during decompression. A general lack of textural overlap between phenocryst types suggests that different phenocryst populations were spatially or temporally isolated during crystallization. We present evidence that the host andesite has mixed with both more felsic and more mafic magmas. Olivine and orthopyroxene xenocrysts with reaction or overgrowth rims and strong normal zoning indicate mixing with basalt. Sieve-textured plagioclase resulted from mixing of a more felsic magma with the host andesite. The mineralogy and mineral compositions of a mafic andesite enclave are identical to those of the host magma, which implies efficient thermal quenching, and thus small volumes of intruding magma. Mixing of this magma with the host andesite results in phenocryst zoning because of differences in dissolved volatile contents. We suggest that small magma pulses differentiated at depth and ascended intermittently into the growing magma chamber, producing incremental variations in whole-rock compositions.									198	17	0	0	4	0	211			0022-3530	1460-2415		WOS:000242771300002

In this work, Co4S3 /Co9S8 nanosheets, with an ultrathin layer structure, were successfully synthesized via an efficient solvothermal process combined with ultrasonic exfoliation. Different metal ions (M = Fe3+, Cr3+, Mn2+ and Ni2+) were then doped by a simple cation exchange method and the effects of different dopants on the OER activities of Co4S3 /Co9S8NS were further investigated in alkaline media. The corresponding results implied that M-doped Co4S3 /Co9S8NS (M = Fe3+, Cr3+, Mn2+ and Ni2+) exhibited different electrocatalytic properties. Evidenced by XPS spectra, the different OER activities were mainly aroused by the redistribution of charge at the interface due to an electronic interaction between the doped metal ions and Co4S3 /Co9S8 NS.

The structures and properties of the supporters and catalysts were characterized and analyzed by BET, XPS, XRD, and TEM. Then, Sb and Co doped SnO_2 carriers were used to synthesize the catalyst to explore its influence on the structure and performance of the supporters and catalysts. The results show that when the hydrothermal reaction time is 24 h, the obtained carrier is most beneficial to the catalyst and obtain the optimal performance. Simultaneously, Sb and Co doped SnO_2 supporters are used to synthesize the catalyst, and the effects of ion valence state and ion size on the structure and properties of the supporters and catalysts are investigated. Doping with Sb and Co can effectively improve the proton transfer of SnO_2 . When Sb is doped with SnO_2 , the electrochemical cycle performance of the catalysts continues to increase. When the doping amount is 20%(mole fraction, the same below), the catalyst obtains the best electrochemical performance; and with the increases of Co doping, the electrochemical cycle performance of the catalysts is reduced. When the doping amount is 5%, the electrochemical active area is the largest, the voltammetric charge Q is equal to 1 478 mC·(cm~2·mg)~(-1) . Finally, by testing the performance of single cell with different doping elements to research: Co doped SnO_2 has the greatest improvement on the performance of IrO_2 single cell. The anodic overpotential for oxygen evolution was 1.884 V under the test conditions of 1.0 A / cm~2 . The performances of the doped catalyst are directly related to the valence state and ion size of the doped ion. The larger the valence difference between ions, the higher the catalytic performance of the catalysts. The ionic sizes of Sb are larger than that of Sn4+ , and the performance improves with the increase of doping amount; and the average ionic size of CO is smaller than that of Sn4+ , and the performance decreases with the increase of doping amount.			以十六烷基三甲基溴化铵( CTAB)为模板剂,水热法制备介孔SnO_2载体,以Adams法制备40%IrO_2(质量分数)负载型催化剂,采用BET、 XPS、XRD、TEM等手段对载体及催化剂结构与性能进行表征与分析;然后用Sb、Co掺杂SnO_2载体并合成催化剂,探究其对载体及催化剂结构与性能的影响。结果表明:当水热反应时间为24 h时,获得的载体最有利于催化剂负载,并获得最优性能。掺杂有效改善了SnO_2质子传递,当Sb掺杂SnO_2时,其催化剂电化学循环性能不断增高,Sb掺杂量为20%(摩尔分数,下同)时,催化剂获得最好电化学性能;而当Co掺杂SnO_2时,其催化剂电化学循环性能降低,Co掺杂量为5%时,催化剂获得最好性能,其电化学活性面积最大时,伏安电荷量Q为1 478 mC·( cm~2 ·mg)~(-1) 。最后对不同掺杂元素单电池进行测试,Co掺杂的SnO_2对IrO_2单电池性能提升最大,在1.0 A / cm~2测试条件下析氧过电位为1.884 V。研究发现掺杂后催化剂性能与掺杂离子的价态及尺寸有直接关系,离子价态差越大,催化性能越高。Sb离子尺寸高于Sn4+ ,性能随掺杂量增大而提高; Co离子尺寸低于Sn4+ ,性能随掺杂量增大而降低。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1005-023X			CSCD:7162904

This study aims to electrochemically treat OMW in an Al electrode reactor, to oxidize the organic matter, discolor the margins and neutralize the pH, thus reducing the pollutants. Various low cost adsorbents have been studied for the treatment of different types of effluents. In this study, the potential of activated carbon (C) derived from olive stones (OS) was studied for OMW removal. H3PO4 (phosphoric acid) treated OS (AOS), as a low-cost, natural and eco-friendly biosorbent, was investigated for OMW removal from aqueous solutions. This work found that the increase in electrolysis time and current intensity significantly improved the treatment, while energy consumption and electrodes were observed. The results showed thirty-fold diluted margins for effluents with an acid pH of 5.02 and a conductivity of 14.89. The physicochemical parameters evolution during the electrocoagulation (EC) treatment showed that, under the conditions of an electrolysis time of 3 h and a current intensity of 3 A (= 416 A/m(-2)), the margins discoloration diluted ten times (91%), the mass loss of the electrodes was 0.55 kg.m(-3) and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction was 50%. These optimal operational levels allowed a good degradation of the margins. Biosorption kinetic data were properly fitted with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The experimental isotherm data were analyzed using Langmuir's and Freundlich's isotherms equations. The best fit was obtained by the Langmuir' s model, with maximum OWM monolayer biosorption capacity of 189.83 mg/g. The biosorption was exothermic in nature (entalphy change: Delta H degrees = -13.11 kJ/mol). The reaction was accompanied by a decrease in entropy (Delta S degrees = -72.91 kJ/mol). The Gibbs energy (Delta G degrees) was higher when the temperature was increased from 303 to 318 K, indicating a decrease in the biosorption feasibility at higher temperatures. The results have established good potentiality for EC and ALS to be used for OMW removal.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0872-1904			WOS:000823872700001

Magnesium alloys are commonly used in Mg /C seawater dissolved oxygen batteries and Mg /AgCl,Mg /PbCl or Mg /CuCl seawater activated batteries. The current common magnesium alloy seawater battery anode material systems are Mg-Al-Zn,Mg-Hg-Ga and Mg-Al-Pb series,such materials can meet the power requirements of most subsea working equipment,especially low-power electrical equipment. However,magnesium alloy seawater batteries cannot meet the power needs of some high-power electrical equipment under the sea (such as torpedoes) because of the disadvantages of low battery anode utilization and discharge activity caused by passivation of the product film,voltage lag,and particle desorption. What's more,alloying,modifying processing technology and microstructure characteristic are mainly strategies to improving the discharge performance of magnesium alloy anode materials. The alloying elements such as Al,Zn,Hg,Ga,Pb,In,Sn,etc. for common magnesium alloy seawater batteries have achieved remarkable achievements in adjusting the electrochemical properties by modifying the microstructure of the alloy. Processing technologies such as homogenization treatment,extrusion and rolling followed by annealing treatment reduce the side reactions of hydrogen evolution and improve anode utilization by homogenizing microstructure,refining grain size,breaking coarse second phase particles,and reducing the intracrystalline defects caused by plastic deformation. The influence of microstructure such as impurities and composition homogenization,second phase particles,grain size, texture and discharge production film on the discharge performance of magnesium alloy anode depends on their characteristics. This article summarizes the research progress of the improvement of electrochemical performance when magnesium and magnesium alloys are used as anode materials for seawater batteries. The influencing factors and mechanism of the electrochemical performance of magnesium alloys are summarized from alloying,processing technology and microstructure characteristics. The existing problems and application prospects of the electrochemical performance of magnesium alloy seawater battery anode materials are analyzed. It aims to provide a reference for improving the discharge performance of magnesium alloy anode materials and developing magnesium alloy seawater batteries.			镁及镁合金以其低密度、高电化学活性、高比容量等优点成为优异的海水电池阳极材料,自20世纪40年代以来备受关注。镁合金作海水电池阳极材料常用于Mg /C海水溶解氧电池及Mg /AgCl、Mg /PbCl或Mg /CuCl海水激活电池。目前常见的镁合金海水电池阳极材料体系为Mg-Al-Zn、Mg-Hg-Ga及Mg-Al-Pb系,此类材料能够满足大部分海下工作设备尤其是小功率用电设备的用电需求。然而,对海下大功率用电设备(如鱼雷等)而言,镁海水电池仍存在一些亟待解决的问题,如由于负差数效应、放电产物膜钝化、电压滞后及粒子脱附等问题导致电池阳极利用率低、放电活性下降。目前提高镁合金阳极材料放电性能的思路主要为合金化、改变加工工艺及微观组织特征三个方面。常见海水电池用镁合金阳极材料合金化元素Al、Zn、Hg、Ga、Pb、In、Sn等通过改变合金微观组织特征调控合金的电化学性能,取得了显著的成果;加工工艺(如均匀化热处理、挤压、轧制后退火等)通过均匀合金微观组织、细化晶粒尺寸、破碎粗大第二相粒子、减少塑性变形导致的晶内缺陷以减少析氢副反应、提高阳极利用率;微观组织如杂质及成分均匀性、第二相粒子、晶粒尺寸、织构及放电产物膜等对镁合金阳极放电性能的影响视其特征而定。本文归纳了近年来镁及镁合金作海水电池阳极材料时电化学性能提升方面的研究进展,分别从合金化、加工工艺及微观组织特征三个方面综述了镁合金电化学性能的影响因素及其作用机理,分析了镁合金海水电池阳极材料电化学性能存在的问题及其应用前景,以期为提高镁合金阳极材料放电性能及发展镁合金海水电池提供参考。						1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1005-023X			CSCD:7060454

The kinetic measurements more clearly showed the correlation between the reactivity of Au-n(-) with O-2 and their electronic properties: the sizes with a closed electron shell are always inert, and the sizes with an unpaired electron can chemically adsorb one O-2 molecule if their adiabatic detachment energies (ADEs) are lower than a threshold around 3.5 eV. This ADE threshold dividing the active and inert Au-n(-) is independent of the clusters' sizes, global geometries, and local adsorption sites. According to the widely accepted electron transfer mechanism, this threshold could stand for the case in which the total energy of the Au-n(-) and an O-2 roughly equals that of the spin crossover point of the potential surfaces of Au-n-O-2(-) and Au-n(-)center dot center dot center dot O-2.									12	2	0	0	0	0	12			1089-5639			WOS:000429625900002	29542922

Specifically, we examine here the solid state changes that occur in a millimetre-sized Ni/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst body in both 2D and 3D during calcination and CO methanation for the first time. The combination provides a unique insight into the spatial phase distribution of these materials and how these evolve via a series of solid state transformation processes. For example, initially, two Ni-ethylenediamine (en) complexes were observed on the impregnated and dried body; a hydrated and non-hydrated form, which 2D scans reveal possess an egg-shell and egg-yolk distribution, respectively. Furthermore, the mu-XRD data were of sufficient quality so as to be able to reveal that the particles within the 'egg-shell' were larger (similar to 35 nm) than those of the 'egg-yolk' (similar to 19 nm) and that there were more of them. On calcination, both precursors collapsed, yielding metallic fcc Ni particles with a surprisingly uniform average size distribution over the catalyst (similar to 4 nm). However, a comparison of the scattering at different stages of the experiment suggested that the crystalline structure of some of the Ni remained diffraction 'silent'. Calcination in oxygen lead to both Ni oxidation and particle sintering, mainly at the exterior, which on pre-reaction reduction (in H-2) yielded again fcc Ni particles (similar to 4 nm interior, similar to 6 nm exterior) with a significant reduction in the amorphous Ni component. The catalyst proved active for CO methanation and, during 2 h time on-stream, no change in the structure composition or shape was observed, leading us to conclude that nano-sized fcc Ni particles on gamma-Al2O3 are the active component in CO methanation. This work therefore demonstrates both the power of spatially resolved mu-XRD-CT/mu-absorption-CT measurement of catalytic systems and its advantage over more 'traditional' single point studies on small sieve fractions.									62	3	0	0	9	0	63			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000298963300031

A relative stability in acid electrolytes was found. The novel anode was employed for the anodic oxidation of p-methoxytoluene (PMT) to p-methoxybenzaldehyde (PMB), which is of industrial interest, Batch type electrolyses with 30% theoretical conversion (4 F mol(-1)) were used for a parametric screening. The solvent/electrolyte-system was 1 M H2SO4/5 M H2O in methanol. Optimum results (60% selectivity, 50-60% current efficiency) were obtained at low concentrations of the educt (0.2 M), A part of the current is consumed for the formation of the benzylmethylether, which can be further oxidized to PMB, It was proved that the novel anode operates according to the mechanism of heterogeneous redox catalysis with ter- and heptavalent manganese as the redox species. A turnover factor of > 2000 is unusual for a spinel in acid solution.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0021-891X			WOS:000077493800001

In the last three decades, a series of earth-abundant transition metal-based electrocatalysts have been explored for electrochemical water oxidation. In this regard, metal-organic framework (MOF) derived catalysts (metal oxides, phosphides, chalcogenides, etc.) with various compositions, desired morphologies, high porosity, large electrochemical surface areas, and tunable properties have been explored for electrochemical water oxidation. MOF-derived catalysts produce excellent electrochemical water oxidation activity in alkaline medium. However, the direct utilization of MOFs for anodic water oxidation has been overlooked for a long time due to their poor stability under electrochemical conditions. Recently, the instability of MOFs has been successfully utilized to produce ultrathin metal hydroxide-(oxy)hydroxide [M(OH)(2)-M(O)(x)(OH)(y)] nanosheets by electrochemical transformation. The MOF plays the role of a precatalyst and undergoes a series of structural reconstructions like hydrolysis, metal ion leaching, oxidation of the metal ions during alkaline anodic water oxidation and forms the active catalyst M(OH)(2)-M(O)(x)(OH)(y). The electrochemically synthesized ultrathin nanosheets demonstrate excellent water oxidation activity and stability because of their atomic-level thickness, large electrochemical surface area, optimum inter-layer distance, and tuned electronic structure. Recently, this strategy has been explored to attain high-quality ultrathin M(OH)(2)-M(O)(x)(OH)(y) nanosheets for water oxidation. Although tremendous progress has been made in using MOFs as a precatalyst for electrochemical water oxidation, no dedicated review is available in this field. Looking at this point, this review describes a strategy of designing ultrathin M(OH)(2)-M(O)(x)(OH)(y) nanosheets by the electrochemical transformation of MOFs, the structural and electronic structure modulation of the ultrathin M(OH)(2)-M(O)(x)(OH)(y) nanosheets, morphological development and their application for electrochemical water oxidation. Moreover, the structure-activity-stability relationship has been established with suitable examples and the recent progress and challenges have also been addressed focusing on the future perspective in this field.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000752535000001

The reefs comprise a strata-bound occurrence of Au + PGE estimated at 91 million tons of rock with 1.8 ppm Au and similar amounts of Pd. The precious metals occur in two major zones, a lower major Pd reef which is concordant with the modal layering and followed by at least ten minor Pd reefs (also concordant), and an Au concentration which fringes the Pd reefs outward and upward through the Triple Group units. The major Pd concentration and the Au concentration are separated in a systematic way across the intrusion. Near the center of the intrusion, the Au concentration occurs some 60 m higher in the stratigraphy than the main Pd reef, but the separation decreases gradually outward, being only a few meters near the margins.The dominant precious metal minerals are small grains of (Cu,Fe)(Au,Pd,Pt) alloys which typically are included in interstitial sulfides (bornite, digenite, and smaller amounts of chalcopyrite). The textural relations suggest a close genetic association between the sulfides and Au + PGE minerals, an association which is confirmed by whole-rock compositional data.Our observations demonstrate that the Platinova reefs formed after significant concentration of the Au + PGE and S in the residual magma during fractional crystallization, before it became saturated with respect to a sulfide (Fe-Cu-S-O) liquid. This sulfide liquid acted as a collector of Au + PGE and settled into the Layered series cumulates. We propose that the structure of the deposit evolved through fractional crystallization of the Au + PGE-bearing sulfide liquid as it was filter-pressed along with the interstitial silicate melt upward into the overlying unconsolidated cumulates. The fractional crystallization resulted in an evolution of the Au + PGE-bearing phases with progressive fractionation from Pd-rich alloys at the base of the deposit to Au-rich alloys at the top.We argue that the sulfides evolved to their present extreme Cu-rich, Fe-poor composition during oxidation-desulfurization reactions in the same event which oxidized the iron-titanium oxides of the intrusion. This oxidation-desulfurization probably had no overall effect on the distribution of Au and PGE.									112	3	3	0	0	0	116			0361-0128			WOS:000074297900005

The deposit is hosted by upper greenschist-lower amphibolite facies (550-650 degrees C) rocks of the Langshan Group. Most orebodies are hosted in a shear zone that developed in parallel with the sedimentary bedding of the Langshan Group. Fe was precipitated coeval with the deposition of the host rocks (i.e., a syngenetic origin), whereas Cu, Pb and Zn were precipitated in hydrothermal systems postdating formation of the host rocks (i.e., an epigenetic origin). The hydrothermal mineralization process can be subdivided into two stages: 1, a main stage with predominant Cu-Pb-Zn mineralization stage where ore-forming structures are characterized by brittle-ductile and brittle-shear deformation. The main stage sulfide veins cut the mylonite fabrics of the host rocks. Mineral paragenesis and compositions indicate that main-stage Cu mineralization took place at 330-440 degrees C and 3.4-3.9 kbar. This pressure-temperature (P-T) condition is consistent with that of the brittle-ductile transition zone but lower than that of the peak metamorphism of the host rocks. Compared with Cu mineralization, the main stage Pb-Zn mineralization took place at relatively lower temperature and pressure. The syngenetically formed Fe orebodies and iron formations in the Huogeqi deposit were favorable sites for epigenetic Cu precipitation. The H2S-rich Cu fluids would have reacted with Fe in the host rocks when flowing through Fe orebodies and iron-formations. Such a reaction would have led to a reduction in H2S of the ore-forming fluids and consequently Cu precipitation; 2, the late stage Cu-mineralization is of less economic importance, characterized by open-space filling textures and a low-temperature mineral assemblage that constrains the ore-forming temperature as lower than 330 degrees C. This late stage mineralization took place in an epithermal-like hydrothermal system at a shallower crustal depth. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The films are smooth with no detectable cracks or pores, as observed by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Microstructural studies by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy show that the GaN films have a hexagonal structure with an epitaxial relationship between the film and the substrate of (0001)(GaN)parallel to(0001)(Al2O3), and [11 (2) over bar0](GaN)parallel to[10 (1) over bar0](Al2O3).

Such nanocages substantially outperform all the water oxidation electrocatalysts reported in literature, with an overpotential of only 226mV for reaching 10mAcm(geo)(-2) at a loading of Ir as low as 12.5 mu g(Ir)cm(-2) on the electrode in acidic media. When benchmarked against a commercial Ir/C electrocatalyst at 250mV of overpotential, such a nanocage-based catalyst not only shows enhancements (18.1- and 26.2-fold, respectively) in terms of mass (1.99Amg(Ir)(-1)) and specific (3.93mAcm(Ir)(-2)) activities, but also greatly enhanced durability. The enhancements can be attributed to a combination of multiple merits, including a high utilization efficiency of Ir atoms and an open structure beneficial to the electrochemical oxidation of Ir to the active form of IrOx.									62	2	0	0	3	0	62			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000474803100007	30848853

Herein, we report a new templated growth approach for the scalable synthesis of amorphous GCTs, which had uniform wall thickness and were ultra-long in length, with the length determined by the template dimension and being demonstrated all the way up to 1 m. The GCTs significantly outperformed other carbon-based sorbents in terms of their oil sorption capacities, oilwater separation capabilities and recyclability properties, and had excellent water oxidation electrocatalysis activity. These interesting properties of the prepared GCTs were discussed to determine the underlying mechanisms and were correlated to their unique structural parameters.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000426704100021		
J	Jenkyns, Hugh C.					Jenkyns, Hugh/0000-0002-2728-0984			Geochemistry of oceanic anoxic events								GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS				11						Q03004	10.1029/2009GC002788				MAR 9 2010	2010	Oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) record profound changes in the climatic and paleoceanographic state of the planet and represent major disturbances in the global carbon cycle. OAEs that manifestly caused major chemical change in the Mesozoic Ocean include those of the early Toarcian (Posidonienschiefer event, T-OAE, similar to 183 Ma), early Aptian (Selli event, OAE 1a, similar to 120 Ma), early Albian (Paquier event, OAE 1b, similar to 111 Ma), and Cenomanian-Turonian (Bonarelli event, C/T OAE, OAE 2, similar to 93 Ma). Currently available data suggest that the major forcing function behind OAEs was an abrupt rise in temperature, induced by rapid influx of CO2 into the atmosphere from volcanogenic and/or methanogenic sources. Global warming was accompanied by an accelerated hydrological cycle, increased continental weathering, enhanced nutrient discharge to oceans and lakes, intensified upwelling, and an increase in organic productivity. An increase in continental weathering is typically recorded by transient increases in the seawater values of Sr-87/Sr-86 and Os-187/Os-188 ratios acting against, in the case of the Cenomanian-Turonian and early Aptian OAEs, a longer-term trend to less radiogenic values. This latter trend indicates that hydrothermally and volcanically sourced nutrients may also have stimulated local increases in organic productivity. Increased flux of organic matter favored intense oxygen demand in the water column, as well as increased rates of marine and lacustrine carbon burial. Particularly in those restricted oceans and seaways where density stratification was favored by paleogeography and significant fluvial input, conditions could readily evolve from poorly oxygenated to anoxic and ultimately euxinic (i.e., sulfidic), this latter state being geochemically the most significant. The progressive evolution in redox conditions through phases of denitrification/anammox, through to sulfate reduction accompanied by water column precipitation of pyrite framboids, resulted in fractionation of many isotope systems (e.g., N, S, Fe, Mo, and U) and mobilization and incorporation of certain trace elements into carbonates (Mn), sulfides, and organic matter. Sequestration of CO2 in organic-rich black shales and by reaction with silicate rocks exposed on continents would ultimately restore climatic equilibrium but at the expense of massive chemical change in the oceans and over time scales of tens to hundreds of thousands of years.									946	43	1	0	336	3	975				1525-2027		WOS:000275493800002

Rotating disc and rotating ring-disc electrodes were used to determine the effect of bicarbonate concentration, solution pH, nature and concentration of the halide ions, convection and potential sweep rate on the corrosion processes. These parameters were found to play a key role on the localized attack induced by halide ions by influencing the production of a Co(HCO3)(2) precipitate on the pit surface.

X-ray analysis data and SEM micrographs showed the amorphous nature of the thick hydrous nickel hydroxide films produced by the above mentioned procedure.

Herein, we report a W-doping-induced phase transition strategy to synthesize W-Ni3S2/Ni7S6 heterojunctions. The W doping not only regulates the morphology of as-prepared catalysts to construct uniform nanorod arrays but also can induce the appearance of the Ni7S6 crystal phase to form W-Ni3S2/Ni7S6 heterojunctions which can enhance the intrinsic activity of the electrocatalyst. Consequently, W-Ni3S2/Ni7S6 shows a low overpotential (eta 1 = 202 mV and eta 2 = 285 mV in 1.0 M KOH for reaching a current density of 100 and 200 mA cm(-2), respectively), and good stability, and is a promising noble-metal-free OER catalyst.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000751909600001

The ultra-fast one-step electrodeposition of CoFe2O4 over conducting substrates provides an economic pathway to high-performance energy devices. Electrodeposited CoFe2O4 on Ni-foam showed a low overpotential of 270 mV and a Tafel slope of 31 mV/dec. The results indicated a higher conductivity for electrodeposited compared with dip-coated CoFe2O4 with enhanced device performance. Moreover, bending and chronoamperometry studies suggest excellent durability of the catalytic electrode for long-term use. The energy storage behavior of CoFe2O4 showed high specific capacitance of 768 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g and maintained about 80% retention after 10,000 cycles. These results demonstrate the competitiveness and multifunctional applicability of the CoFe2O4 spinel to be used for energy generation and storage devices.									43	1	0	0	0	0	43			2073-4344			WOS:000460702200070

The core-shell structures were obtained by the formation of cores from metal ions and carbon shells from carbonization of ligands. Controllable oxidation of Co cores to CoOx shells generated multilayer core-shell structures anchored onto the surface of rGO sheets. The N-doped composites were obtained by adding poly vinylpyrrolidone. The multilayer core-shells composites exhibited superior catalytic activity toward hydrogen generation compared to their single layer counterparts. By using the N-doped multilayer composites, high hydrogen generation specific rate of 5560 mL min(-1) g(Co)(-1) was achieved at room temperature. The rGO sheets in composites improved their structure stability. These catalysts exhibited high stability after used five cycling. This synergistic strategy proposes simple, efficient, and versatile blue-prints for the fabrication of rGO composites from MOFs-based precursors.									38	3	0	0	1	0	38			1944-8244			WOS:000378584800060	27243608

The known morphologies, which evolve on dealloying of nanoparticles, include core shell, hollow core-shell, and porous nanoparticles. Here we present results examining the fixed voltage dealloying of AgAu alloy particles in the size range of 2-6 and 20-55 nm. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microcopy, energy dispersive, and electron energy loss spectroscopy are used to characterize the size, morphology, and composition of the dealloyed nanoparticles. Our results demonstrate that above the potential corresponding to Ag+/Ag equilibrium only core-shell structures evolve in the 2-6 nm diameter particles. Dealloying of the 20-55 nm particles results and in the formation of porous structures analogous to the behavior observed for the corresponding bulk alloy. A statistical analysis that includes the composition and particle size distributions characterizing the larger particles demonstrates that the formation of porous nanoparticles occurs at a well-defined thermodynamic critical potential.									131	2	0	0	3	0	131			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000336074800052	24689459

As one of the extremely promising alternatives toward metal in boosting their catalytic performance, nonmetallic atoms-doped metal nanocrystals have recently received extensive attention because of their high efficiency, chemical and structural durability, abundant reserve, and low cost. In this review, we highlight the most recent progress in this field and provide insights into their catalytic applications. The metal nonmetal nanocrystals prepared by doping metal nanocrystals with nonmetallic atoms are introduced and classified based on the types of nonmetallic atoms, including metal hydrides, borides, carbides, nitrides, oxides, phosphides, and chalcogenides. Besides, their applications in catalysis, especially in electrocatalysis and organic catalysis, have been summarized and discussed. Finally, the conclusions and perspectives are given for the catalysis-driven rational design of metal-nonmetal nanocrystals in this minireview.

To have successful water splitting in a sustained manner, it is necessary to develop efficient and robust catalysts that can perform water oxidation, the bottleneck process of water splitting either electrochemically or photochemically. Here, we have presented a brief descriptive analysis of different aspects of designing such catalysts in connection with our recent works on the same field. The focus of the article is to discuss contemporary works in the field of designing cobalt-based heterogeneous water oxidation electrocatalysts. To the best of our knowledge, although cobalt is the most extensively studied 1st row transition metal for water oxidation catalysis reaction, no such report has been found where the simplest cobalt complex, [, has been employed as a water oxidation catalyst. Not only that, reports of cobalt-based simple and small molecular catalysts are also not very frequent. With the help of our recent works, we have tried to detail here a wide aspect of the study on cobalt-based simple and small molecular catalysts, starting from the reasons behind the scarcity of such water oxidation catalysts, to development of new ideas addressing the challenges in utilization of such small cobalt complexes for water oxidation catalyst. Here, we have addressed the scope of encapsulation chemistry in designing robust and efficient heterogeneous water oxidation catalysts using cobalt-based small molecular guest species. With the help of structural insight, gained from the recent results, we published in the field of water oxidation catalysis; here, we try to formulate a general approach that can help to prepare water oxidation catalyst based on host-guest chemistry. The article critically evaluates our recent results in connection with the approach of addressing the problem.SYNOPSIS An efficient electrocatalytic water oxidation can be achieved by cobalt(II)-based functional materials that comprise of a mononuclear Co(II)-aqua coordination complex [, included in the confined space of a metal organic framework (MOF) material, zeolite-Y-supported - nano-film and ZIF-8 MOF-encapsulated cobalt(II)-centred Keggin-type polyoxometalate. The relevant kinetic analyses have been discussed in details.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0974-3626	0973-7103		WOS:000438718200001		
J	He, Lingyun; Zhou, Wu; Cai, Dongping; Mao, Samuel S.; Sun, Ke; Shen, Shaohua					Mao, Samuel/0000-0003-3287-8304			Pulsed laser-deposited n-Si/NiOx photoanodes for stable and efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting								CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				7	12			2632	2638		10.1039/c7cy00114b				JUN 21 2017	2017	An electrocatalytic and stable nickel oxide (NiOx) thin layer was successfully deposited on an n-Si (100) substrate by pulsed laser deposition (PLD), acting as a photoanode for efficient photo-oxidation of water under solar illumination. It was revealed that the formed n-Si/NiOx heterojunction with good Schottky contact could improve photogenerated charge separation, and thus n-Si photoanodes deposited with a 105 nm-thick NiOx electrocatalytic layer exhibited a photovoltage of similar to 350 mV, leading to greatly improved photoelectrochemical performances for water oxidation. The stability of the photoanode was significantly enhanced with the increasing thickness of NiOx protective layers. This study demonstrates a simple and effective method to enable the use of planar n-Si (100) substrates as efficient and durable photoanodes for practical solar water oxidation.									15	2	0	0	0	0	15			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000403966900025

An overview on established and novel approaches is given. A recent viable solution is provided by electroplating of nanoscale catalytic metals on passivated semiconductor surfaces, thereby forming reactive centers and avoiding contact between the semiconductor surface and the electrolyte. At these nano-dimensioned Schottky-type junctions, light-induced excess minority carriers are scavenged and transferred to the electrolyte. Various possible device configurations are outlined and envisaged systems for hydrogen or oxygen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction are presented. The role of ultrathin passivating films is emphasized and methods to fabricate open as well as compact conformal films are described.									18	0	0	0	3	0	19			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000279079600001	20198676

The Macedonian mouse (Mus macedonicus), a small (15 g) mesic rodent distributed in the Mediterranean ecosystem, is a species which invades post fire habitats in the first stages of habitat recovery. 2. In order to assess the seasonal acclimatization of thermoregulatory and metabolic mechanisms, the response of several physiological variables to photoperiod manipulations under a constant T-a were studied. 3. Our results show that mice acclimated to a short photoperiod increased their resistance to cold, while acclimation to a long photoperiod increased their resistance to high T(a)s and the effectiveness of their thermoregulatory mechanisms. Body mass increased in mice acclimated to a short photoperiod. We conclude that photoperiod is an important environmental cue for seasonal acclimatization of thermoregulatory and metabolic mechanisms in this species. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Different from the bulk magnet, the systematic engineering on MNSs has brought a great breakthrough in some emerging fields such as the construction of MNSs, the magnetism exploration of multidimensional MNSs, and their potential translational applications. In this review, we give a detailed description of the synthetic strategies of MNSs based on the fundamental features and application potential of MNSs and discuss the recent progress of MNSs in the fields of nanomedicines, advanced nanobiotechnology, catalysis, and electromagnetic wave adsorption (EMWA), aiming to provide guidance for fabrication strategies of MNSs toward diverse applications.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000743244900001	35014799

In particular, such an effect has been more important in the atomic catalysts. In this review, we have summarized the synergistic effect of N, X co-doping graphdiyne[X=B, S, F or transition metal(TM)] electrocatalysts and graphdiyne-based dual-atom catalyst(GDY-DAC). In general, the synergistic cooperation between two different dopants in co-doped GDY and adjacent active sites in GDY-DAC not only promotes their catalytic activity but also greatly enhances the thermodynamic stability of the catalysts. For the N, X co-doping GDY electrocatalysts, doping the heteroatoms like boron, sulphur, phosphorus, and fluorine with nitrogen can further tune the charge density distribution and electronic structure. Meanwhile, the electron exchange between two doping atoms and GDY substrate has been discussed, where the TM-based GDY-DAC is a very promising catalyst for electrocatalysis. More importantly, electronic interactions between different elements on GDY have been carefully discussed. In the end, we have also supplied perspectives to the future developments of the GDY-based electrocatalysts.									3	1	0	0	1	0	3			1005-9040	2210-3171		WOS:000712350200001

As anode five titanium expanded meshes coated with IrO2-SnO2 doped with Sb2O5 and five stainless steel expanded meshes as cathode were used. The reactor operated as a batch recirculation system under galvanostatic conditions, the electrolyses were carried out at two current densities, 132 and 200 A m(-2), with 1.0 mM of indigo carmine dye and 0.05 M of NaCl; four liquid flow rates: 0.9, 1.8, 2.7, and 3.6 L min(-1) were used. The transient mathematical model for FM01-LC reactor takes into account the liquid flow pattern through axial dispersion coefficient (Dax), the electro-oxidation (pseudo first order kinetic) of chloride ions in the anode side (C-Cl(-)), the electrochemical reduction of chlorine oxidizing species (Cox) under mass transport control (mass transfer coefficient) in cathode side; while in the CST the chemical oxidation reactions between active chlorine species and organic matter through homogeneous second order kinetics were considered, which were evaluated through consumption of the chemical oxygen demand (C-COD) and the color decay (C-col). It was observed that the proposed mathematical model describe adequately the experimental evolution of different chemical species (C-Cl(-), CCOD, and Ccol). Also the constant values determined under conditions here worked: k(Cl) = (3.2.10(3) to 4.9.10(3))s(-1); k(ox) = 3.5.10(5) to 4.6.10(5))s(-1); k(COD) = (1.16.10(5) to 4.7.10(5))m(3)mol(-1)s(-1); k(col) = (1.2.10(3) to 9.98.10(3))m(3)mol(-1)s(-1); are in good agreement with the values reported in other previous works.

XRD, XPS, TEM, UV-DRS techniques were applied to study physicochemical properties of perovskites. In addition, Incident Photon-to-Current Efficiency (IPCE) measurements, Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) and impedance spectroscopy were used to characterize electrochemical properties of the materials. The band gap energy increases in the following way: BF-MW (2.05 eV), LF-MW (2.18 eV), BF-SG (2.26 eV) and LF-SG (2.54 eV), demonstrating a remarkable influence of the synthesis method on the optical and electronic properties of the materials. Furthermore, XRD showed a significant impact of the synthesis methods on the crystal structure. Perovskites synthesized under MW irradiation showed a pure crystal structure compared to the perovskites prepared by SG method, which contained some admixtures. IPCE shows that LF-MW has a better charge separation ability compared to BF-MW. However, BF-SG showed the highest activity. Temperature programmed reduction tests (TPR) revealed a better ability of BF-MW to adsorb/desorb oxygen, compared to LF-MW. XPS measurements pointed at the presence of Fe4+. Finally, the photocatalytic activity of the perovskites was tested in solar water-splitting as a function of the synthesis method and presence of Bi and La in "A" sites of the ABO(3) perovskites. We postulate, that the Jahn-Teller distortion effect in LF-MW increases its catalytic activity by decreasing the binding energy compared to BF-MW.									18	2	0	0	1	0	18			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000455471100116		
J	RASHID, A; POPOVIC, R								ELECTRON DONATION TO PHOTOSYSTEM-II BY DIPHENYLCARBAZIDE IS INHIBITED BOTH BY THE ENDOGENOUS MANGANESE COMPLEX AND BY EXOGENOUS MANGANESE IONS								BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY-BIOCHIMIE ET BIOLOGIE CELLULAIRE				73	5-6			241	245		10.1139/o95-029				MAY-JUN 1995	1995	Diphenylcarbazide (DPC) is an efficient electron donor to the inactive oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II (PSII). We investigated the role of manganese on the rate of electron donation from DPC to PSII in both Mn-depleted (Tris washed) and Mn-retaining (NaCl washed) PSII preparations. The rate of electron donation from DPC to PSII was significantly higher in Mn-depleted than in Mn-retaining preparations, indicating a negative role of native Mn complex on DPC electron donation. The apparent K-m values for DPC were found to be 0.11 and 0.17 mM for Mn-depleted and Mn-retaining PSII preparations, respectively. This difference in the K-m values also indicates an antagonistic effect of endogenous Mn cluster on electron donation from DPC, which was markedly inhibited by exogenous Mn2+. However, the magnitude of inhibition was greater in Mn-depleted than in Mn-retaining PSII preparations. This indicates a higher accessibility of DPC to PSII in the absence of native Mn complex. Our results suggest (i) that Mn, either endogenous or added, acts as an accessibility barrier for DPC to donate electrons to PSII and (ii) that the native Mn complex not only functions as an accumulator of oxidizing equivalents but may also protect PSII from exogenous reductants.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			0829-8211			WOS:A1995RZ40700005	8829369

Herein, unique ZnCo2O4-CoOOH heterostructured ultrathin nanosheets on Ni foam are reported that combines a two-step hydrothermal method. This catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performances to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with an ultralow overpotential of 115 mV for HER, attaining an overpotential of 238 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) for OER. Remarkably, ZnCo2O4-CoOOH/Ni shows a voltage of 1.494 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Such performances are due to the inter-penetrative pores present in the ultrathin nanosheets that provide large surface areas and expose massive active sites to enhance activities. In addition, the unique nanosheet structure and the 3D Ni foam substrate possess large specific surface areas, which can facilitate mass diffusion. This excellent performance is ascribed to the ZnCo2O4-CoOOH heterostructure that manipulates strong synergy to improve the electrochemical activity. This study offers new insight on an innovative approach for the exploitation of effective bifunctional electrocatalysts with a heterostructure.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000813541700001	35726895

In this study, the molecular cloning and characterization of a Prx2 homologue (CiPrx2) were described from grass carp (Ctenoplicuyngodon idella). The full-length cDNA of CiPrx2 was 1163 by containing 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of 52 bp, a 3'-UTR of 517 by with the putative polyadenylation consensus signal (AATAAA), an open reading frame (ORF) of 594 by encoding polypeptides of 197 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 21.84 kDa and theoretical isoelectric point of 5.93. The analysis results of multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree confirmed that CiPrx2 belong to the typical 2-Cys Prx subfamily. The CiPrx2 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in all tested tissues. The temporal expression of CiPrx2 were differentially induced infected with grass carp reovirus (GCRV), polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in liver and spleen. Subcellular localization of CiPrx2-GFP fusion proteins were only distributed in the cytoplasm. The purified recombinant CiPrx2 possessed an apparent antioxidant activity and could protect DNA against oxidative damage. Finally, CiPrx2 proteins could obviously inhibit H2O2 and heavy metal toxicity. However, further researches are needed to better understand the regulation of CiPrx2 under oxidative stresses.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000483634300062	31202963

Highly robust anatase TiO2 thin films were prepared in situ on fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (F : SnO2 or FTO) by spin coating and thermal annealing. The as-prepared films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and UV-vis spectroscopy. Under simulated solar irradiation, a maximum photocurrent of 0.20 mA cm(-2) was obtained from FTO/TiO2 photoanodes in the presence of 20 mM Ni-5-POM-0.050 M pH 9.0 borate buffer electrolyte at 0.70 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3.0 M KCl), which was a 2.3 times increase in photocurrent as compared to that without using the Ni-5-POM catalyst. The use of the catalyst also significantly shifted the onset potential of water oxidation to a much negative potential value with respect to -0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. As verified by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the above results could be attributed to the effect of the catalyst on decreasing electron-hole recombination and facilitating the hole utilization rate on the semiconductor TiO2-electrolyte interface upon light illumination. Dissolved oxygen produced from the FTO/TiO2-Ni-5-POM system was detected with an oxygen sensor. This is the first report on the use of the homogeneous water oxidation catalyst Ni-5-POM as a functional co-catalyst for photoelectrochemical water oxidation with semiconductor photoanodes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2398-4902			WOS:000428778800012

However, the low kinetic of water splitting is still the key for limiting the PEC performance of BiVO4. Herein, a W-doped BiVO4(W-BVO) photoanode has been controllably prepared by a fast flame method within 40 seconds. The preparation condition including calcination time and quantity of W precursor has been systemically investigated, in order to optimize the PEC performance of W-BVO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates that the introduction of W did not obviously cause the formation of oxygen vacancies, revealing that W has been doped into the crystal structure of BiVO(4)by flame method. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further confirmed that the W-BVO possesses a lower charge transfer resistance with fast transfer ability of carriers. Based on the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, the acceptable solar to electron conversion efficiency of 5.79% (340 nm, 1.23 V vs RHE) has been achieved in the W-BVO system. A PEC mechanism has been proposed to demonstrate the promotion of kinetic for PEC water splitting. This work offers a promising alternative route for the design and fabrication of efficient photoanodes in other PEC systems.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000555906100001

In addition to PsbP, the thylakoid lumen contains two PsbP-like proteins (PPLs) and six PsbP-domain proteins (PPDs). While the functions of the PsbP-like proteins PPL1 and PPL2 are currently under investigation, the function of the PsbP-domain proteins still remains completely unknown. PPD6 is unique among the PsbP family of proteins in that it contains a conserved disulfide bond which can be reduced in vitro by thioredoxin. The crystal structure determination of the PPD6 protein has been initiated in order to elucidate its function and to gain deeper insights into redox-regulation pathways in the thylakoid lumen. PPD6 has been expressed, purified and crystallized and preliminary X-ray diffraction data have been collected. The crystals belonged to space group P21, with unit-cell parameters a = 47.0, b = 64.3, c = 62.0 angstrom, beta = 94.2 degrees, and diffracted to a maximum d-spacing of 2.1 angstrom.									8	1	0	0	7	0	10				2053-230X		WOS:000301921300007	22442221

Electrochemical destruction of RB5 on Ti/PtOx-RuO2-SnO2-Sb2O5 electrodes: a comparison of two methods for electrode preparation								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				17	2			903	916		10.1007/s13762-019-02393-5				FEB 2020	2020	The studies were performed with 100 mg/L of Reactive Black 5 dye (RB5) in batch reactors on Ti/PtOx-RuO2-SnO2-Sb2O5 electrodes prepared indigenously. The electrodes were fabricated using titanium substrate (plate) and coated with mixed metals of a fixed composition by standard thermal decomposition (STD) and polymeric precursor thermal decomposition (PPTD) methods. The electrolysis up to 1 h was accomplished at a constant current density of 50 mA/cm(2). For the process, an initial pH of 2 was maintained with the dosage of 4 g/L NaCl as supporting electrolyte. The effects of electrodes on colour, chemical oxygen demand, and total organic carbon removal were investigated for destruction of RB5. In this comparative study, while complete decolourizations of water containing RB5 were achieved on the electrodes prepared by STD and PPTD methods, but COD and TOC removal was found to be different for different electrodes at operating conditions. The 87% COD and 83% TOC removals were achieved on Ti/PtOx-RuO2-SnO2-Sb2O5 electrode prepared by PPTD method, in comparison to 83% COD and 80% TOC removals on the electrode prepared by STD method. The two types of electrodes were compared based on removal rate constant, mass transfer coefficient, instantaneous current efficiency, energy consumption, and accelerated life test. The energy demand for RB5 removal in this study was less than 250 kWh/kg COD, which is much lower than the reported values in similar studies. Further, the performance of electrodes was compared employing scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis for coating deposited on Ti substrate, and also by cyclic voltammetry.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1735-1472	1735-2630		WOS:000511706600027		
J	FARINEAU, J								COMPARED THERMOLUMINESCENCE CHARACTERISTICS OF PEA THYLAKOIDS STUDIED INVITRO AND INSITU (IN LEAVES) - THE EFFECT OF PHOTOINHIBITORY TREATMENTS								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				36	1			25	34		10.1007/BF00018072				APR 1993	1993	Characteristics of thermoluminescence (TL) glow curves were studied in thylakoids (isolated from pea leaves) or in intact pea leaves after an exposure to very high light for 2 min in the TL device. The inhibition of photosynthesis was detected as decreases of oxygen evolution rates and/or of variable fluorescence.In thylakoids exposed to high light, then dark adapted for 5 min, a flash regime induced TL glow curves which can be interpreted as corresponding to special B bands since: 1) they can be fitted by a single B band (leaving a residual band at -5-degrees-C) with a lower activation energy and a shift of the peak maximum by -5 to -6-degrees-C and, 2) the pattern of oscillation of their amplitudes was normal with a period of 4 and maxima on flashes 2 and 6. During a 1 h dark adaptation, no recovery of PS II activity occurred but the shift of the peak maximum was decreased to -1 to -2-degrees-C, while the activation energy of B bands increased. It is supposed that centers which remained active after the photoinhibitory treatment were subjected to reversible and probably conformational changes.Conversely, in intact leaves exposed to high light and kept only some minutes in the dark, TL bands induced by a flash regime were composite and could be deconvoluted into a special B band peaking near 30-degrees-C and a complex band with maximum at 2-5-degrees-C. In the case of charging bands by one flash, this low temperature band was largely decreased in size after a 10 min dark adaptation period; parallely, an increase of the B band type component appeared. Whatever was the flash number, bands at 2-5-degrees-C were suppressed by a short far red illumination given during the dark adaptation period and only remained a main band at 20-degrees-C; therefore, the origin of the low temperature band was tentatively ascribed to recombinations in centers blocked in state S2Q(A)-Q(B)2-. In vivo, the recovery of a moderately reduced state in the PQ pool, after an illumination, would be slow and under the dependence of a poising mechanism, probably involving an electron transfer between cytosol and chloroplasts or the so-called 'chlororespiration' process.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			0166-8595			WOS:A1993LD64100004	24318795

Raman spectroscopy and XPS of decomposed samples and also by additional examination for the effects of impurities (MnO2, Al2O3 and Si) on the decomposition of electrolyte. The valence of manganese at the decomposed parts in the fuel side was found to become higher after the long term operation. This leads to the driving force for the decomposition of 10Sc1CeSZ into two phases by the large oxygen potential gradient developed on the surface in the fuel side. The kinetic factors for formation of new phases are considered to be as follows; the Si component in the fuel can be a trigger to form MnSiO3 which worked at the nucleation points, and the valence changes of manganese in the electrolyte proceed the decomposition cycles consisting of two phase separation in the zirconia, pulverization of manganese-rich phase and detachment of zirconia-based oxides.

Initially, ZnO nanorods have been prepared at 95 degrees C, followed by hybridization (coating) of PANI onto the ZnO via in situ polymerization of aniline monomer, forming ZnO-PANI nanohybrid (ZP). The structural properties of ZP have been analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) studies. The presence of surface defects especially the oxygen vacancies in ZnO has been characterized by photoluminescence emission, high resolution TEM, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and micro-Raman spectral measurements. The chemical interaction of PANI with ZnO has been examined by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and XPS analyses. A significant enhancement in visible absorption of ZP sample is found as evidenced from UV-vis diffused reflectance spectral study. BET nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm shows an improved textural property (pore size, pore volume) of ZP. Moreover, a long-term stable photoelectro-chemical activity (PEC) of ZP is found compare to pristine ZnO. The synergic effect of PANI hybridization and the presence of surface defects in ZnO NRs can enhance the PEC by prolonging the recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers. The effect can also provide large number of active sites to make electrolyte diffusion and mass transportation easier in the nanohybrid. This simple synthesis strategy can be adopted for PANI hybridization with different metal oxide semiconductors towards enhancing PEC activity of the hybrid materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Likewise, electrochemical energy storage systems particularly supercapacitors are of importance for future sustainability. Therefore, finding an efficient high-performance electrode material with both electrocatalytic activity and electrochemical energy storage capacity remains an emerging task for sustainability. In view of this challenge, we have derived a composite of partially graphitized carbon with Co2P2O7 (GC-CPP), a non-noble metal, low-cost electroactive material from open-framework cobalt phosphite. The crystal structure, surface morphology and elemental composition of the sample have been analyzed using PXRD, Raman, FESEM, HRTEM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. More importantly, the electrochemical performances have been assessed using cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic methods. In alkaline electrolyte, GC-CPP catalyzes the OER requiring only 165 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density with lower Tafel slope (41 mV dec(-1)). When used as an anode for a supercapacitor, GC-CPP shows higher specific capacitance (900 F g(-1)) compared to the pyrophosphates studied to date. Further, the high values of energy (31.25 W h kg(-1)) and power densities (21 kW kg(-1)) and cyclic durability prove the suitability for practical application. This strategy of deriving highly active electrode material from open frameworks provides an opportunity to design efficient and cost-effective electrode material for renewable energy technologies.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2398-4902			WOS:000667709900001

Mulberry (Morus alba L.) is a desirable tree spePhysocarpus amurensis Maxim andcies with high ecological and economic benefits. To reveal the response and adaptive mechanisms of the photosynthetic functions of mulberry leaves to flooding stress, chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthetic electron transfer and the Calvin cycle were investigated by physiological studies combined with an analysis of the transcriptome. Flooding stress inhibited the synthesis of chlorophyll (Chl) and decreased its content in mulberry leaves. The sensitivity of Chl a to flooding stress was higher than that of Chl b owing to the changes of CHLG (LOC21385082) and CAO (LOC21408165) that encode genes during chlorophyll synthesis. The levels of expression of Chl b reductase NYC (LOC112094996) and NYC (LOC21385774), which are involved in Chl b degradation, were upregulated on the fifteenth day of flooding, which accelerated the transformation of Chl b to Chl a, and upregulated the expression of PPH (LOC21385040) and PAO (LOC21395013). This accelerated the degradation of chlorophyll. Flooding stress significantly inhibited the photosynthetic function of mulberry leaves. A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes under different days of flooding stress indicated significant enrichment in Photosynthesis-antenna proteins (map00196), Photosynthesis (map00195) and Carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms (map00710). On the fifth day of flooding, 7 and 5 genes that encode antenna proteins were identified on LHCII and LHCI, respectively. They were significantly downregulated, and the degree of downregulation increased as the trees were flooded longer. Therefore, the power of the leaves to capture solar energy and transfer this energy to the reaction center was reduced. The chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and related changes in the expression of genes in the transcriptome indicated that the PSII and PSI of mulberry leaves were damaged, and their activities decreased under flooding stress. On the fifth day of flooding, electron transfer on the PSII acceptor side of mulberry leaves was blocked, and the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) on the donor side was damaged. On the tenth day of flooding, the thylakoid membranes of mulberry leaves were damaged. Five of the six coding genes that mapped to the OEC were significantly downregulated. Simultaneously, other coding genes located at the PSII reaction center and those located at the PSI reaction center, including Cytb6/f, PC, Fd, FNR and ATP, were also significantly downregulated. In addition, the gas exchange parameters (P-n, G(s), T-r, and C-i) of the leaves decreased after 10 days of flooding stress primarily owing to the stomatal factor. However, on the fifteenth day of flooding, the value for the intracellular concentration of CO2 was significantly higher than that on the tenth day of flooding.In addition, the differentially expressed genes identified in the Calvin cycle were significantly downregulated, suggesting that in addition to stomatal factors, non-stomatal factors were also important factors that mediated the decrease in the photosynthetic capacity of mulberry leaves. In conclusion, the inhibition of growth of mulberry plants caused by flooding stress was primarily related to the inhibition of chlorophyll synthesis, antenna proteins, photosynthetic electron transfer and the Calvin cycle. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for the response and mechanism of adaptation of the photosynthetic function of mulberry to flooding stress.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1559-2316	1559-2324		WOS:000821327400001	35786355

BVO often exhibits poor PEC performance without modifications such as doping, co-catalyst deposition, and heterojunction formation. Herein, we report an alternative method to deposit a phase-pure BVO film using the electron-beam evaporation (EB) method. Specifically, electron-beam irradiation on the BVO source generates BVO precursor vapors, depositing an amorphous BVO film. The substrate temperature and emission current (of the electron-beam) were varied to control the phase-purity and grain size of the BVO film. The surface chemical state, optical, and electrochemical properties of the BVO films were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, respectively. Interestingly, we found that BVO prepared under optimal condition has large grains (similar to 400 nm in lateral size) and oxygen vacancies, thus exhibiting enhanced PEC performance. The photocurrent density of similar to 1.0 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode was obtained, which is 50% higher than the sol-gel derived BVO. The photocurrent density increased further to 2.4 mA/cm(2) via CoOx co-catalyst deposition. More importantly, the photocurrent stability of EB-BVO was much higher than the sol-gel BVO.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000576739900008

As a key member of anti-oxidative enzyme family, catalase plays a crucial role in scavenging the high level of reactive oxygen species to protect organisms against various oxidative stresses. In this study, a catalase homologue was identified from Mytilus coruscus (named McCAT, 10(957929). The open reading frame of McCAT was 1844 bp with a 5' untranslated region of 341 bp and a 3' untranslated region of 927 bp. The deduced amino acid sequence was 512 residues in length with theoretical pI/MW 8.02/57.91 kDa. BLASTn and phylogenetic analyses strongly suggested that it was a member of catalase, also known as CAT family for its conserved catalytic site motif and proximal heme-ligand signature motif. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR showed that constitutive expression of McCAT was occurred, with increasing order in mantle, adductor, gill, hemocyte, gonad and hepatopancreas. It was observed that bacterial infection and heavy metals stimulation up-regulated McCAT mRNA expression in hepatopancreas with time-dependent manners. The maximum expression appeared at 8 h after pathogenic bacteria injecting, with 15-fold in Vibrio parahemolyticus and 60-fold in Aeromonas hydrophila than that of 0 h. The highest point of McCAT mRNA appeared at different times for exposure to heavy metals with copper at day 5 (0.1 mg/L 30-fold, 0.5 mg/L 15-fold, 1.5 mg/L 6-fold) and plumbum at day 3 (3.0 mg/L 20-fold). The enzymatic activity analysis found that McCAT activity in the gill of M. coruscus was affected by heavy metals concentration. The results suggested that McCAT plays a significant role in antioxidation and the expression of McCAT can be used as a biomarker for detection of marine environmental pollution.									13	0	0	0	11	0	13			0025-326X	1879-3363		WOS:000427332900079	29475715

Photoelectrochemical studies showed that photocurrents of TiO2 nanorod anodes could be remarkably improved through loading with CoO x nanosensitizers, benefiting from the broadened light-responsive range and alleviated charge carrier recombination. For the first time, Forster-resonance energy transfer (FRET) assisted nanosensitizer reexcitation effect was observed. Beneficially, the lost energy through radiative-emission from TiO2 could be efficiently reutilized by adjacent CoOx, generating extra charge carriers on nanosensitizers for further improvement of photoelectrocatalytic performance. Importantly, we directly observed the strong clusterization tendency of CoOx and morphology evolution from sub-3 nm nanodots to clusters larger than 20 nm when their loading amount is slightly increased. Furthermore, photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of photoanodes based on TiO2@CoOx hybrid structures underwent significant enhancement initially and sharp decline eventually. We reason it that the formation of large sensitizer clusters would severely block the charge carrier transfer from nanosensitizers to TiO2 nanorods and lead to exacerbated charge carrier recombination and photoelectrocatalytic performance.

With a minimum halo mass of 10(7)-10(8) M-circle dot and a moderate outflow efficiency, we reproduce both the current baryon fraction and the early chemical enrichment of the IGM. The intensity of the formation rate of "normal'' stars is also well constrained by the observations: it has to be dominated by star formation in elliptical galaxies, except perhaps at very low redshift. The fraction of baryons in stars is predicted as are also the Type Ia and II supernova event rates. Comparison with SN observations in the redshift range z = 0-2 allows us to set strong constraints on the time delay of Type Ia supernovae (a delay of similar to 3 Gyr is required to fit the data), the lower end of the mass range of the progenitors (2-8 M-circle dot), and the fraction of white dwarfs that reproduce the Type Ia supernova ( about 1%). The intensity of zero metallicity star formation below 270 M-circle dot must be limited in order to avoid premature overenrichment of the IGM. About 50% of the metals present in the IGM at z 0 have been produced by Population III stars at very high z. The remaining 50% are ejected later by galaxies forming normal stars. We conclude that about 10(-3) of the mass in baryons must lie in the first massive stars in order to produce enough ionizing photons to allow early reionization of the IGM by z(-15).									46	1	0	0	0	0	47			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000239830000005

Multi-scale chemo-mechanical evolution during crystallization of mixed conducting SrTi0.65Fe0.35O3-delta films and correlation to electrical conductivity								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				10	5			2421	2433		10.1039/d1ta06455j		OCT 2021		FEB 1 2022	2022	Recent work has demonstrated a low-temperature route to fabricating mixed ionic/electronic conducting (MIEC) thin films with enhanced oxygen exchange kinetics by crystallizing amorphous-grown thin films under mild temperatures, eluding conditions for deleterious A-site cation surface segregation. Yet, the complex, multiscale chemical and structural changes during MIEC crystallization and their implications for the electrical properties remain relatively unexplored. In this work, micro-structural and atomic-scale structural and chemical changes in crystallizing SrTi0.65Fe0.35O3-delta thin films on insulating (0001)-oriented Al2O3 substrates are observed and correlated to changes in the in-plane electrical conductivity, measured in situ by ac impedance spectroscopy. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Fe and Ti K-edges gives direct evidence of oxidation occurring with the onset of crystallization and insight into the atomic-scale structural changes driven by the chemical changes. The observed oxidation, increase in B-site polyhedra symmetry, and alignment of neighboring B-site cation coordination units demonstrate increases in both hole concentration and mobility, thus underpinning the measured increase of in-plane conductivity by over two orders of magnitude during crystallization. High resolution transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy of films at various degrees of crystallinity reveal compositional uniformity with extensive nano-porosity in the crystallized films, consistent with solid phase contraction expected from both oxidation and crystallization. We suggest that this chemo-mechanically driven dynamic nano-structuring is an additional contributor to the observed electrical behavior. By the point that the films become similar to 60% crystalline (according to X-ray diffraction), the conductivity reaches the value of dense, fully crystalline films. Given the resulting high electronic conductivity, this low-temperature processing route leading to semi-crystalline hierarchical films exhibits promise for developing high performance MIECs for low-to-intermediate temperature applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000713290100001

On the basis of phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence, strain HNR was related to Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (98.9% identity). Nitrogen balance during heterotrophic growth with 120 mg/l of NH4+-N showed that 40.2% of NH4+-N was in the form of N-2 and 52.1% was found in biomass. Only a trace production was either nitrite or nitrate. Further tests demonstrated that nitrite and nitrate were not reduced by strain HNR under aerobic conditions. Neither nitrate reductase (NR) nor nitrite reductase (NiR) activity was detectable in the aerobic reaction mixtures. However, a 0.051 U activity of hydroxylamine oxidase (HAO) was observed. The nitrogen removal was speculated to be via a hydroxylamine intermediate instead of nitrite, which was different from the conventional nitrogen removal pathway. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The quantitative results clearly reveal that the initially absorbed water molecules on TiO2 surface promote the electron transfer between Ti and O atoms. However, when water molecule was dissociated into OH and H groups on Ti and O sites, respectively, the electron excitation and transfer ability have been gradually decreased and finally terminated, probably due to the reverse electron-attraction of OH group on Ti atoms. Amazingly, when Pt co-catalyst was deposited on TiO2, the electron excitation between Ti and O atoms have been significantly enhanced and no evident decrease has been observed during the entire water splitting process. In addition, the changes of Pt-O and Ti-O chemical bonds at the photocatalytic interfaces have been also detected. Furthermore, based on the above mechanism studies, the photocatalytic hydrogen production system for Pt/ R-TiO2 (001) in KOH solution containing CH3OH was proposed, which exhibits a significant enhancement of hydrogen evolution rate (20.78 mu mol h(-1)), which is nearly 2.5 times higher than that of traditional Pt/R-TiO2 (001) in CH3OH system (8.35 mu mol h(-1)). The finding in this work may pave the way for developing other high-efficiency photocatalytic hydrogen production system over TiO2-based photocatalysts.									30	4	0	0	4	0	30			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000440682100055

A major challenge, however, lie in the low open circuit voltages that are typically obtained in SnS-based devices. Herein, a low-cost solution-phase deposition technique is used to prepare SnS thin films and investigate different junction materials (Ga2O3 and In2S3) to improve the photovoltage in SnS-based water splitting photocathodes. Molecular inks are prepared by dissolving SnS powder in solvent mixtures of ethylenediamine and 1,2-ethanedithiol. SnS thin films are then successfully deposited by spin coating the inks onto substrates, followed by a heat treatment at 350 degrees C in an inert atmosphere. With a photoelectrode based on a SnS/Ga2O3 heterojunction, an onset potential of -0.25 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) is achieved for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution in pH 7 phosphate buffer, which is until now the earliest onset potential (highest photovoltage) among nontoxic replacements to CdS junctions in SnS-based water splitting systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000688195400001		
J	Favet, Thomas; Cottineau, Thomas; Keller, Valerie; El Khakani, My Ali					KELLER, Valerie/0000-0002-3381-1446			Comparative study of the photocatalytic effects of pulsed laser deposited CoO and NiO nanoparticles onto TiO2 nanotubes for the photoelectrochemical water splitting								SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS				217						110703	10.1016/j.solmat.2020.110703				NOV 2020	2020	Hybrid structures combining a photo-active material and non noble metal oxide co-catalyst nanoparticles are of strong interest to produce efficient photoelectmdes for hydrogen production while limiting the cost due to noble metals (Pt, Ru ...). In order to get some insight on the mechanism change induced by such co-catalyst nanoparticles (NPs), we conducted a comparative study between cobalt and nickel oxide nanoparticles deposited onto TiO2 nano-tubes (NTs) prepared through anodization. The TiO2-NTs were decorated with CoO and NiO nanoparticles using the reactive pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. The oxygen atmosphere used during the PLD process, ensures the in-situ oxidation of the metal nanoparticles into CoO and NiO. The surface loadings of CoO or NiO NPs were controlled by the number of laser ablation pulses (N-LP). The efficiency of CoO and NiO NPs as cocatalysts for photo-electrochemical water splitting was studied by cyclic voltammetry, as a function of NLP, under both simulated sunlight and visible light illuminations and by external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. We determined an optimal catalyst loading at N-LP = 2000, allowing to almost triple the photoconversion efficiency (PCE) for both TiO2-NTs/CoO-NPs and TiO2-NTs/NiO-NPs nanohybrid photoanodes, in comparison with bare TiO2-NTs. Moreover, CoO-NPs were found to be the best co-catalyst under visible light illumination, with a PCE almost 10 times higher than for TiO2. This significant enhancement of the visible light activity is ascribed to the narrower band gap of CoO and to the formation of a heterojunction with TiO2 that is more favorable for charge transfer than in the case of NiO co-catalyst.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0927-0248	1879-3398		WOS:000574947600003

Herein, size- and composition-tunable alloyed Cd1-xZnxSe NCs were successfully prepared via a one-step hot injection method for photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. By prolonging the reaction time, CdSe NCs with the varied particle sizes were firstly fabricated. It is found that the driving force derived from the difference between conduction band position of CdSe NCs and water reduction potential played a key role in determining the photocatalytic performance. The larger driving force from smaller particle size would give rise to a faster electron transfer and better photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, a series of alloyed Cd1-xZnxSe NCs with different compositions were prepared. With the increased zinc amount, the photocatalytic activity of Cd1-xZnxSe NCs was initially increased and then decreased. Cd1-xZnxSe with the moderate Zn content exhibited the best photocatalytic hydrogen production. It is inferred that the photocatalytic performance of Cd1-xZnxSe NCs has a close relationship with the driving force and crystal structure. The present study can provide a guidance to develop efficient nanocrystal photocatalysts by simply controlling the particle size and composition. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and polarization curve have been utilized to investigate the electrochemical behavior and electrocatalytic activity of Ti/IrO2(x) + MnO2(1-x) anodes in 0.5 M NaCl solution (pH = 2). Ti/IrO2+MnO2 anode with 70 mol% IrO2 content has the maximum value of q*, indicating that Ti/IrO2(0.7) + MnO2(0.3) anode has the most excellent electrocatalytic activity for the synchronal evolution of Cl-2 and O-2 in dilute NaCl solution. Tafel lines displayed two distinct linear regions with one of the slope close to 62 mV dec(-1) in the low potential region and the other close to 295 mV dec(-1) in the high potential region. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic is employed to investigate the impedance behavior of Ti/IrO2(x) + MnO2(1-x) anodes in 0.5 M NaCl solution. It is observed that as the R (ct), R (s) and R (f) values for Ti/IrO2(0.7) + MnO2(0.3) anode become smaller, electrocatalytic activity of Ti/IrO2(0.7) + MnO2(0.3) anode becomes better than that of other Ti/IrO2 + MnO2 anodes with different compositions. Ti/IrO2(0.7) + MnO2(0.3) anode fabricated at 400 A degrees C has been observed to possess the highest service life of 225 h, whereas the accelerated life test is carried out under the anodic current of 2 A cm(-2) at the temperature of 50 A degrees C in 0.5 M NaCl solution (pH = 2).									19	3	0	0	1	0	22			1432-8488			WOS:000276722800010		
J	He, YY; Klisch, M; Hader, DP								Adaptation of cyanobacteria to UV-B stress correlated with oxidative stress and oxidative damage								PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY				76	2			188	196		10.1562/0031-8655(2002)076<0188:AOCTUB>2.0.CO;2				AUG 2002	2002	Cyanobacteria must cope with the negative effects of ultraviolet B (280-315 nm) (UV-B) stress caused by their obligatory light requirement for photosynthesis. The adaptation of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. to moderate UV-B radiation has been observed after 2 weeks of irradiation, as indicated by decreased oxidative stress, decreased damage, recovered photosynthetic efficiency and increased survival. Oxidative stress in the form of UV-B-induced production of reactive oxygen species was measured in vivo with the oxidative stress-sensitive probe 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Photooxidative damage by UV-B radiation, including lipid peroxidation and DNA strand breakage, was determined by a modified method using thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and fluorometric analysis of DNA unwinding. Photosynthetic quantum yield was determined by pulse amplitude-modulated fluorometry. The results suggest that moderate UV-B radiation results in an evident oxidative stress, enhanced lipid peroxidation, increased DNA strand breaks, elevated chlorophyll bleaching as well as decreased photosynthetic efficiency and survival during the initial exposure. However, DNA strand breaks, photosynthetic parameters and chlorophyll bleaching returned to their unirradiated levels after 4-7 days of irradiation. Oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation appeared to respond later because decreases were observed after 7 days of radiation. The survival curve against irradiation time exhibited a close relationship with the changes in photosynthetic quantum yield and DNA damage, with little mortality after 4 days. Growth inhibition by UV-B radiation was observed during the first 7 days of radiation, whereas normal growth resumed even under UV-B stress thereafter. An efficient defense system was assumed to come into play to repair photosynthetic and DNA damage and induce the de novo synthesis of UV-sensitive proteins and lipids, allowing the organisms to adapt to UV-B stress successfully and survive as well as grow. No induction of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAA) was observed during the adaptation of Anabaena sp. to UV-B stress in our work. The adaptation of the cyanobacterium correlated with and could be caused by the oxidative stress and oxidative damage.									84	3	0	0	80	0	92			0031-8655	1751-1097		WOS:000177443900011	12194216

In this context, vertically grown thin sheets of ZnO is developed, which can function as an efficient photoanode in PEC water splitting reaction. Further, the PEC activity of ZnO is enriched by decorating a newly developed co-catalyst, which is amorphous MoSx through efficient charge transportation. MoSx nanostructure is decorated on the surface of ZnO nanosheet via electrodeposition technique. MoSx adorned ZnO shows enhanced activity towards photoanodic PEC water splitting compared to bare ZnO. ZnO@MoSx can generate photocurrent density nearly three times higher compared to bare ZnO at an applied potential of '0.5998' V vs. RHE. Sensitization of MoSx on ZnO surface results in an enhancement in carrier density; ZnO@MoSx shows nearly 7.4-times higher carrier density compared to bare ZnO. Maximum photoconversion efficiency, 0.934% is achieved in the case of ZnO@MoSx. The determined band alignment of ZnO and MoSx indicate the formation of type-II heterostructure which allow facile charge carrier separation. Efficient charge separation is also confirmed with the help of PL spectroscopy. It further restricts the electron-hole recombination in ZnO, leading to enhanced PEC activity. ZnO@MoSx thin sheets are very stable even up to 1000 s under chopped illumination condition. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a series of Ni(OH)(2) decorated Ni/C catalysts (Ni(OH)(2)-Ni/C) were prepared by a three-step electrochemical treatment of Ni/C. The existence of Ni(OH)(2) was demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the surface molar ratio of Ni(OH)(2)/Ni of the samples was estimated via an electrochemical method. The HOR catalytic activity of the catalysts was evaluated by a rotation disk electrode (RDE) method, and a "volcano plot" was established between the HOR exchange current (j(0)) and the surface molar ratio of Ni(OH)(2)/Ni. On top of the "volcano", the surface molar ratio of Ni(OH)(2)/Ni is 1.1:1, the j(0) of which was 6.8 times of that of Ni/C. The stability of the samples toward HOR was evaluated to be good. Our study added a systematic experimental evidence to the HOR research, showing that the HOR catalytic activity of Ni can be deliberately controlled via decoration of Ni(OH)(2), which may help understanding the HOR mechanism on Ni.

The synthesized samples were characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy(EDS), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier Transmission Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Photoluminescence (PL) Spectroscopy and Electron spin resonance (ESR). Diffraction peaks related to both SnS2 and CdO was observed in the XRD pattern of the composite. Photocatalytic studies established that the composite exhibit a photodegradation efficiency of nearly equal to 86.11% against rhodamine B and 92.86% against congo red dyes. Also, the SnS2-CdO nanocomposite exhibited enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity, from visible light water splitting.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0921-5107	1873-4944		WOS:000527372100008		
J	WOOLF, VM; TOMKIN, J; LAMBERT, DL								THE R-PROCESS ELEMENT EUROPIUM IN GALACTIC DISK F-DWARF-STARS AND G-DWARF-STARS								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				453	2			660	672		10.1086/176428				NOV 10 1995	1995	Abundances of the r-process element Eu have been derived for 81 nearby field F and G disk dwarfs. Galactic orbital properties and abundances of 15 other elements have previously been derived for these stars by Edvardsson et al. The average logarithmic abundance ratio [Eu/Fe] increases from -0.1 to 0.4 with decreasing Fe abundance over the range -0.9 less than or equal to [Fe/H] less than or equal to +0.3. Scatter in [Eu/Fe] at a given [Fe/H] is consistent with observational and analysis uncertainties in [Eu/Fe].The Eu abundances from this study and the published Ba abundances show [Eu/Ba] to increase with stellar age. This is interpreted as indicating a change in the relative number of r-process and s-process sites over the history of the Galaxy or a change in the efficiency of the sites. Thus we cannot assume that the ratio of r-process to s-process contributions to heavy element abundances has remained constant, even recently. The Th/Nd stellar chronometer depends on this ratio being constant; thus, the variation in [Eu/Ba] reported here may indicate that the Th/Nd chronometer needs revision.The variation of [Eu/Fe] with [Fe/H] is found to most closely resemble the variations of oxygen and the a elements which are thought to be produced primarily in Type II supernovae. When compared to theoretical models for Galactic r-process nucleosynthesis, the abundance trend found for the stars we have studied corresponds most closely to models in which the r-process site is Type II supernovae. Although this correspondence has previously been reported, in the metallicity range observed in this study the Eu abundances reported here correlate more closely to the predictions based on Type II supernovae models than previous data have.									88	3	0	0	0	0	88			0004-637X			WOS:A1995TC99200014

The Verwey transition is suppressed by chemical doping effects giving rise to well-documented first and second-order regimes, but the origin of the order change is unclear. Here, we show that slow oxidation of monodisperse Fe3O4 nanoparticles leads to an intriguing variation of the Verwey transition: an initial drop of T-V to a minimum at 70 K after 75 days and a followed recovery to 95 K after 160 days. A physical model based on both doping and doping-gradient effects accounts quantitatively for this evolution between inhomogeneous to homogeneous doping regimes. This work demonstrates that slow oxidation of nanoparticles can give exquisite control and separation of homogeneous and inhomogeneous doping effects on the Verwey transition and offers opportunities for similar insights into complex electronic and magnetic phase transitions in other materials.The Verwey transition in magnetite has been studied for nearly eight decades since its discovery in the 1940s. Here, Kim et al. elucidate the influence of chemical doping by extremely slow oxidization process with magnetite nanoparticles, revealing why first- and second-order regimes of the Verwey transition are observed.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2041-1723		WOS:000714754400053	34737260

In this study, three isoreticular porous 1D rod-based Ti-MOFs ZSTU-1, ZSTU-2 and ZSTU-3 are successfully constructed from infinite [Ti-6((3)-O)(6)((2)-OH)(6)](n) secondary building units (SBUs) and tritopic carboxylate linkers 4,4,4-nitrilotribenzoic acid (H(3)TCA), 1,3,5-tris(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene (H3BTB) and tris(4-carboxybiphenyl)amine (H(3)BTCA), respectively. Their porosities systematically increase with the larger and longer organic linkers. The two MOFs ZSTU-1 and ZSTU-3 built from the triphenylamino-based ligands can absorb visible light, exhibiting much better photocatalytic performance than ZSTU-2 as shown by the H-2 production rate of ZSTU-1 and ZSTU-3 being 3-4 times higher than that of ZSTU-2. The photocatalytic H-2 production rates for ZSTU-1, ZSTU-2, and ZSTU-3 are 1060 mol g(-1) h(-1), 350 mol g(-1) h(-1) and 1350 mol g(-1) h(-1), respectively. The extraordinary photocatalytic activity of ZSTU-3 is attributed to its visible light absorption, large surface area, and favorable charge separation.									159	4	0	0	9	0	162			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472465300029		
J	Engel, Katrin; Asch, Folkard; Becker, Mathias					Asch, Folkard/0000-0001-6589-9916			Classification of rice genotypes based on their mechanisms of adaptation to iron toxicity								JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE				175	6			871	881		10.1002/jpln.201100421				DEC 2012	2012	Iron (Fe) toxicity is a nutritional disorder that affects lowland rice (Oryza sativa L.). The occurrence of excessive amounts of reduced Fe(II) in the soil solution, its uptake by the rice roots, and its transpiration-driven transport result in elevated Fe(II) concentrations in leaf cells that catalyze the formation of reactive oxygen species. The oxidative stress causes rusty brown spots on leaves (bronzing) and the reduction of biomass and yield. While the use of resistant genotypes is the most promising approach to address the problem, the stress appears to differentially affect rice plants as a function of plant age, climatic conditions, stress intensity and duration, and the prevailing adaptation mechanism. We comparatively assessed 21 contrasting 6-week-old rice genotypes regarding their response (symptom score, biomass, Fe concentrations and uptake) to a 6 d iron pulse of 1500 mg L1 Fe(II). Eight selected genotypes were further compared at different stress intensities (0, 500, 1000, and 1500 mg L1 Fe(II)) and at different developmental stages (4-, 6-, and 8-week-old plants). Based on Fe-induced biomass reduction and leaf-bronzing score, the tested spectrum was grouped in resistant and sensitive genotypes. Linking bronzing scores to leaf iron concentrations allowed further differentiation into includer and excluder types. Iron precipitation on roots and organ-specific iron partitioning permitted to classify the adaptation strategies into root exclusion, stem and leaf sheath retention, and leaf blade tissue tolerance. The effectiveness of these strategies differed with stress intensity and developmental stage. The reported findings improve the understanding of Fe-stress response and provide a basis for future genotype selection or breeding for enhancing Fe-toxicity resistance in rice.									35	0	0	0	26	0	35			1436-8730	1522-2624		WOS:000311855400011

Co-Cu oxide catalysts were controllably synthesized by pulsed-spray evaporation chemical vapor deposition. XRD, FTIR, XPS, UV-vis and helium ion microscopy (HIM) were employed to characterize the as-prepared thin films in terms of structure, composition, optical and thermal properties as well as morphology. In situ emission FTIR spectroscopy indicates that Co3O4, CuCo2O4 and CuO are thermally stable at 650, 655 and 450 degrees C, respectively. The catalytic tests with absorption FTIR display that the involvement of Co-Cu oxides can initiate CO and C3H6 oxidation at lower temperatures. The results indicate that in situ emission and absorption FTIR are useful techniques to explore the thermal properties and catalytic performance of functional materials, allowing many potential applications in tailoring their temporally and spatially resolved structure-property relationships.									45	4	0	0	2	0	46			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000353034300016	25619852

By contrast, the evolutionarily related oxalate oxidase (EC 1.2.3.4) converts oxalate and dioxygen to carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. Divergent free radical catalytic mechanisms have been proposed for these enzymes that involve the requirement of an active site proton donor in the decarboxylase but not the oxidase reaction. The oxidase possesses only one domain and manganese binding site per subunit, while the decarboxylase has two domains and two manganese sites per subunit. A structure of the decarboxylase together with a limited mutagenesis study has recently been interpreted as evidence that the C-terminal domain manganese binding site (site 2) is the catalytic site and that Glu-333 is the crucial proton donor (Anand, R., Dorrestein, P. C., Kinsland, C., Begley, T. P., and Ealick, S. E. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 7659-7669). The N-terminal binding site (site 1) of this structure is solvent-exposed (open) and lacks a suitable proton donor for the decarboxylase reaction. We report a new structure of the decarboxylase that shows a loop containing a 310 helix near site 1 in an alternative conformation. This loop adopts a "closed" conformation forming a lid covering the entrance to site 1. This conformational change brings Glu-162 close to the manganese ion, making it a new candidate for the crucial proton donor. Site-directed mutagenesis of equivalent residues in each domain provides evidence that Glu-162 performs this vital role and that the N-terminal domain is either the sole or the dominant catalytically active domain.									73	3	0	0	54	0	77			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000221164500060	14871895

However, the design of catalysts with high selectivity towards high-order solar fuels (such as ethanol and propanol) remains challenging. Herein, catalysts of carbonized Zn/Co Zeolitic Imidazolat Frameworks with various pyrolysis hours (xh-C-Zn/Co ZIFs) were synthesized and accessed for high selective CO2PRR for the first time. XRD and TEM analyses show that the C containing functional groups in pristine Zn/Co ZIF are carbonized and turned into amorphous porous carbon, while many Co and ZnO nanoparticles are formed during the pyrolysis process. Electrochemical characterizations of the catalysts prove that increasing pyrolysis time of Zn/Co ZIF from 1 h to 3 h, resulting in a decreased light current density from 3.3 mA/cm(2) to 2.3 mA/cm(2), which is much higher than that of Zn/Co ZIF (1.9 mA/cm(2)). Meanwhile, increasing pyrolysis time of Zn/Co ZIF from 1 h to 3 h results in decreased BET surface area and CO2 adsorption ability. XPS spectra suggest a decreased content of metal nitrogen bonds in C Zn/Co ZIF, which leads to the formation of coordinatively unsaturated metal-nitrogen sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the coordinatively unsaturated CoN3V sites in C Zn/Co ZIF had the highest catalytic activity towards high-order organics. The total carbon atom conversion rate reaches 5459 nmol/h.cm(2) when 1h-C-Zn/Co ZIF is employed as catalyst in the CO2PRR system and the selectivity towards high-order solar fuel reaches 84%.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using photoelectrodes under neutral electrolyte conditions provides possibly one of the greenest routes to produce hydrogen. Here, we demonstrate that chlorophyll extracts can be used as an efficient exfoliant to exfoliate bulk MoS2 and WS2 to form a thin layer of a MoS2/WS2 heterostructure. Thin films of solution-processed MoS2 and WS2 nanosheets display photocurrent densities of -1 and -5 mA/cm(2), respectively, and hydrogen evolution under simulated solar irradiation. The exfoliated WS2 is significantly more efficient than the exfoliated MoS2; however, the MoS2/WS2 heterostructure results in a 2500% increase in photocurrent densities compared to the individual constituents and over 12 h of PEC durability under a neutral electrolyte. Surprisingly, in real seawater, the MoS2/WS2 heterostructure exhibits stable hydrogen production after solar illumination for 12 h. The synthesis method showed, for the first time, how the MoS2/WS2 heterostructure can be used to produce hydrogen effectively. Our findings highlight the prospects for this heterostructure, which could be coupled with various processes towards improving PEC efficiency and applications.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2079-4991		WOS:000701781100001	34578753

Herein, an effective route of the direct addition of cobalt nitrate into lactic acid (LA) sacrificial agent solution was applied to greatly boost the antiphotocorrosion and H-2 -production activity of the well-known CdS system. It was found that the introduction of cobalt nitrate into the LA solution causes the rapid production of stable [Co(LA)(2)(H2O2)(2)](3+/2+) complex, which cannot be deposited on the CdS surface during H-2-production progress. In this case, the produced [Co(LA)(2)(H2O)(2)](3+/2+) not only exhibits an apparently higher H-2-evolution rate of CdS nanoparticles but also can maintain their excellent photocorrosion resistance, even after the further photodeposition of metallic Au cocatalyst on the CdS surface. Therefore, the hydrogen-production activity of CdS/Au-Co can reach 86.46 mu mol h(-1), which is as high as that of CdS, CdS/Au and CdS-Co by the factor of 10.16, 1.99 and 2.29 times, respectively. An interesting [Co(LA)(2)(H2O2)(2)](3+/2+) - mediated photocatalytic mechanism was proposed to account the simultaneously boosted antiphotocorrosion and H-2-production activity of the CdS photocatalysts. The present facile route about the direct addition of transition-metal ions can be considered as a general strategy for CdS photocatalysts in LA sacrificial agent system.					3rd International Workshop on Graphene and C3N4-Based Photocatalysts (IWGCP)3rd International Workshop on Graphene and C3N4-Based Photocatalysts (IWGCP)	MAR 23-26, 2019MAR 23-26, 2019		Wuhan Univ Technol, Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINAWuhan Univ Technol, Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	14	0	0	0	2	0	14			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000522731700011

In this work, a facile step-wise synthetic strategy was used to synthesize the yolk-shell structured polyhedrons. The intermediate named as ZIF-67@Co-Fe PBA nanocrystal was formed by the reaction between Co2+ released from ZIF-67 polyhedrons and [Fe(CN)(6)](3)-hydrolyzed from K-3 [Fe(CN)(6)]. N-doped carbon/CoSe2@Co-FeSe2(CoSe2-NC@CoFeSe2) and N-doped carbon/CoS2@Co-FeS2(CoS2-NC@Co-FeS2) polyhedrons with yolk-shell structures were prepared by modifying the ZIF-67@ Co-Fe PBA nanocrystals in the annealing process and they have been applied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Noteworthily, CoSe2-NC@Co-FeSe2 and CoS2-NC@Co-FeS2 yolk-shell polyhedrons showed high catalytic activity in accelerating the reduction of triiodide in DSSCs because of the distinctive structural characteristics and favorable chemical compositions. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.61% and 9.18% were obtained by CoSe2-NC@Co-FeSe2 and CoS2-NC@Co-FeS2 based DSSCs, respectively, which were both superior to that of Pt (8.15%). This as-designed approach implies the new perspective to prepare more types of TMCs with yolk-shell structures in multitudinous areas of energy conversion. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Frictional rubbing of the stirring rod onto the bottom of the glass vessel is an important condition, The friction between the stirring rod and the glass surface generates enough electrostatic field to make a field emission of the positive holes from the semiconductor-powder which are fixed at the micro crack spaces on the glass surface. The emitted positive holes react with water molecules to evolve O-2 and protons. which go to the glass surface and combine with the electrons there to evolve H-2. The energy conversion mechanism, the generation of frictional electricity, the effect of water, the carrier tunnelling emission probability, the hopping conduction in semiconductor, the effects of fluid dynamics, etc. are discussed.

The traditional approach for surface attachment to transparent conductive oxides [e.g., fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)] is via synthetic modification of the ligand architecture to incorporate functional groups such as carboxylic acids (-COOH) or phosphonates (-PO3H2) prior to immobilization. However, challenges arising from desorption and the cumbersome derivatizations steps have limited the scope and applications of surface-bound WOCs. Herein, we report the successful immobilization of underivatized Ru(II)-based WOCs (Ru-Cat1 = [Ru(tpy) (bpy) (H2O)](2+) (tpy = 2,2':6'2 ''-terpyridine and bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) and Ru-Cat2 = [Ru(Mebimpy) (bpy) (H2O)](2+) (Mebimpy = 2,6-bis(1-methylbenzimidazol-2-yl) pyridine)) and the Ru(II) polypyridyl chromophore Ru-C3 = [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) onto a FTO plasma-grafted poly(acrylic acid) surface (PAA vertical bar FTO). Various characterization techniques such as attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and cyclic voltammetry measurements provide evidence for the plasma-induced grafted PAA vertical bar FTO film and immobilization. Surface stability and electrocatalytic properties of these new hybrid composite films upon cycling were investigated at different pH values. Immobilized Ru-Cat1 and Ru-Cat2 onto PAA|FTO displayed pH-dependent (Ru-III/Ru-II) couples and onset potentials indicative of PCET (proton-coupled electron transfer) reactions. Based on cyclic voltammetry results and spectroscopic monitoring, the immobilized WOCs Ru-Cat1 and Ru-Cat2 exhibited a higher surface stability in neutral aqueous solutions relative to Ru-C3 upon electrochemical oxidation. We attribute the surface PCET and stability to the presence of a water ligand in the coordination sphere of immobilized Ru-Cat1 and Ru-Cat2 which can H-bond with negatively charged carboxylate groups of the cross-linked PAA brushes. Our findings demonstrate that the plasma-grafted polymeric network onto FTO offers a versatile platform to directly anchor unmodified homogeneous WOCs or chromophores for potential applications in solar-to-fuel energy conversion.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000636686200016	33751889

Recently, MXene as co-catalysts are considered promising green structured materials to replace expensive noble metals to promote both efficiency and photostability. The utilization of titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene as a co-catalyst has shown great promise for assisting solar to hydrogen conversion owing to their structural flexibility, surface morphological, and tailorable termination groups. The surface functional groups, morphological developments and engineering aspects are important factors to optimize Ti3C2Tx as the best co-catalyst in solar energy applications. This review provides recent advances in morphological design of Ti3C2Tx MXene with critical analysis on the role of termination groups for promoting photoactivity and products selectivity. A deep focus is given to the engineering design of Ti3C2Tx MXene with special regard to quantum dots, monolayer, and hierarchical structures. Firstly, the general overview of Ti3C2Tx MXene is introduced with insights into their catalytic properties and formation of surface termination groups to gain profound understanding of their basic catalytic structure. Next, the effects of tailoring the morphology of Ti3C2Tx MXene into 2D accordion-like structure, monolayer, hierarchical, quantum dots, and nanotubes structure to expedite their role to promote solar-based photoactivity are critically discussed. In addition, specific considerations are given on the effects of reaction parameters, challenges, and synthesis strategies for tailoring the morphology of Ti3C2Tx MXene with controlled functional groups. Finally, future perspectives are provided for the potential use of Ti3C2Tx MXene as green materials in reaction engineering and environment applications.									10	0	0	0	3	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000784350200003

In this work, we show that WO3 can be used as a cathodic electrocatalyst in combination with (Ag,Cu) InGaSe2 solar cell modules to produce hydrogen and provide electrochromic functionality to water splitting devices. This electrochromic effect can be used to monitor the charge state or performance of the catalyst for process control or for controlling the temperature and absorbed heat due to tunable optical modulation of the electrocatalyst. WO3 films coated on Ni foam, using a wide range of different sputtering conditions, were investigated as cathodic electrocatalysts for the water splitting reaction. The solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of solar-driven water electrolysis was extracted using (Ag,Cu)InGaSe2 solar cell modules with a cell band gap varied in between 1.15 and 1.25 eV with WO3 on Ni foam-based electrolyzers and yielded up to 13% STH efficiency. Electrochromic properties during water electrolysis were characterized for the WO3 films on transparent substrate (indium tin oxide). Transmittance varied between 10% and 78% and the coloration efficiency at a wavelength of 528 nm and the overpotential of 400 mV was 40 cm(2) C-1. Hydrogen ion consumption in ion intercalation for electrochromic and hydrogen gas production for water electrolysis processes was discussed.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000639191300015

The efficient synthetic protocols on phase structure evolution and dynamic decomposition behavior enable the production of the Fe1-xS/Fe3C-NCNT hybrid with advanced structural and electronic properties, in which the Fe vacancy contained Fe1-xS showed the 3d metallic state electrons and an electroactive Fe in +2/+3 valence, and the electronic structure of the CNT was effectively modulated by the incorporated Fe3C and N, with the work function decreased from 4.85 to 4.63 eV. The meticulous structural, electronic, and compositional control unveils the unusual synergetic catalytic properties for the Fe1-xS/Fe3C-NCNT hybrid when developed as counter electrodes (CEs) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), in which the Fe3C- and N incorporated CNTs with reduced work function and increased charge density provide a highway for electron transport and facilitate the electron migration from Fe3C-NCNTs to ultrahigh active Fe1-xS with the electron-donating effect, and the Fe vacancy-enriched Fe1-xS nanoparticles exhibit ultrahigh I-3(-) adsorption and charge-transfer ability. As a consequence, the DSSC based on the Fe1-xS/Fe3C-NCNT CE delivers a high power conversion efficiency of 8.67% and good long-term stability with a remnant efficiency of 8.00% after 168 h of illumination, superior to those of traditional Pt. Furthermore, the possible catalytic mechanism toward I-3(-) reduction is creatively proposed based on the structure-activity correlation. In this work, the structure engineering, electronic modulation, and composition control opens up new possibilities electrocatalytic nanoarchitecture for highly efficient CEs in DSSCs.									48	0	0	0	2	0	48			1944-8244			WOS:000445439900031	29999302

These stars show a remarkable deficiency in the neutron-capture elements, while the hydrostatic alpha-elements (O, Mg) are strongly enhanced. Our data indicate [Ba/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios of less than or similar to - 2 and similar to + 0.8 dex, respectively, with essentially no detection of other n-capture elements. In contrast to the only other dSph star with similar abundance patterns, Dra 119, which has a very low metallicity at [Fe/H] = -2.95 dex, our objects, at [Fe/H] similar to -2.0 dex, are only moderately metal-poor. The measured ratio of hydrostatic/explosive alpha-elements indicates that high-mass (similar to 35 M-circle dot) Type II supernovae progenitors are the main, if not only, contributors to the enrichment of this galaxy. This suggests that star formation and chemical enrichment in the ultrafaint dSphs proceeds stochastically and inhomogeneously on small scales, or that the IMF was strongly skewed to high-mass stars. The neutron capture deficiencies and the [Co/Fe] and [Cr/Fe] abundance ratios in our stars are similar to those in the extremely low metallicity Galactic halo. This suggests that either our stars are composed mainly of the ejecta from the first, massive, Population III stars ( but at moderately high [Fe/H]), or that SN ejecta in the Hercules galaxy were diluted with similar to 30 times less hydrogen than typical for extreme metal-poor stars.									140	1	0	0	0	0	140			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000262732700004

However, it is not stable due to its serious photocorrosion. Here, we report Cu2O-doped TiO2 nanoparticles with significant catalytic activity and stability. The as-prepared Cu-doped TiO2 will be self-reduced to Cu2O-TiO2 under light conditions. Furthermore, the Cu2O-TiO2 material exhibits extraordinary catalytic activity compared with common Cu-TiO2 materials. It exhibits a H-2 evolution rate (16.25 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) at about 100 times than that of pure TiO2. It can be found that its high catalytic activity depends on the TiO2 nanostructure and the attachment site of Cu atom. TiO2 nanoparticles with good dispersion structure exposed (101) facets and chemically absorb Cu to form an electron transfer channel, so that the reduced Cu2O can be continuously stable under illumination. From the results of density functional theory and experiments, it can be proved that reduced Cu2O narrows the bandgap of TiO2, which extends the optical absorption range of the material to 800 nm. And the effective charge transfer slackens the electron-hole recombination rate with the relevant electron lifetime increasing from 2.72 ns (0%-TiO2) to 7.92 ns (2%-TiO2). Because of its low cost, good stability and high catalytic efficiency, we believe it will bring the possibility of large-scale application.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000528340500113

Gibbs energy minimization of the gaseous C-H-O-Ar chemical system, including large polyaromatic hydrocarbons and the fullerenes C-60 and C-70, helps to determine under which conditions C-60 and C-70 molecules are stable. The influence of the addition of halogen atoms in the gas phase on the improvement of the yield of these two fullerenes in different conditions is investigated by minimizing the Gibbs energy of the gaseous C-H-F-O-Ar chemical system. The evolution of the yields of the two fullerenes, and of the C-70(C-70 + C-60) ratio as a function of temperature, pressure, and C/H ratio in the reactants is illustrated and compared with corresponding experimental information from a literature review.

However, how light is transferred and distributed inside the biofilm has not been clearly defined yet.Results: In this research, the growth, photosynthetic oxygen evolution, and specific growth rate for microalgal cells in both open-pond and attached cultivation were studied to determine the effective light penetration at different phases of the cultivation. As a result, the light conditions inside the culture broth as well as the biofilm were revealed for the first time. Results showed that outdoor, in a conventional 20-cm deep open pond, all of the algal cells were fully illuminated in the first 3 days of cultivation. As the biomass concentration increased from day 4 to day 10, the light could only effectively penetrate 45.5% of the open-pond depth, and then effective light penetration gradually decreased to 31.1% at day 31, when the biomass density reached a maximum value of 0.45 g L-1 or 90 g m(-2). In the attached cultivation system, under nitrogen-replete condition, almost 100% of the immobilized algal cells inside the biofilm were effectively illuminated from day 0 through day 10 when the biomass density increased from 8.8 g m(-2) to 107.6 g m(-2).Conclusion: Higher light penetration efficiency might be the reason why, using attached cultivation, observed values for photosynthetic efficiency were higher than those recorded in conventional open-pond suspended cultures.									101	6	0	0	74	0	105			1754-6834			WOS:000352356500001	26379777

Our superwetting electrodes are hereby designed to circumvent these issues through controlling the O-2 bubbles adsorption/evolution behavior at electrode surface while maintaining the outstanding electrocatalysis performance. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time the application of superwetting catalytic electrodes in the tri-electrode rechargeable ZABs. Two different functional electrodes, namely superaerophilic cobalt-incorporated nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes hybrid catalyst and super-aerophobic NiFe-layered double hydroxide arrays, serve as exceptional catalysts for discharging and charging process respectively, thus achieving superior battery performance. The low-cost superwetting cathode pairs even exhibit a much better catalytic activity and durability than the combination of precious Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts. The as-assembled ZABs deliver a greatly improved peak power current of 245 mW cm(-2) at 396 mA cm(-2) over that of the ZABs composed of precious metal electrodes (186 mW cm(-2)), together with small polarization, high reversibility, and stability over long cycles. The design of superwetting electrode marks a general and effective strategy to achieve high-performance rechargeable ZABs.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			2405-8297			WOS:000456689500043

The formation of a tandem heterojunction structure facilitates the migration and spatial separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Plasmon Ag nanoparticles can generate hot electrons to enhance the photothermal performance due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. The unique 3D hierarchical ball-flower-like Bi5O7I nanosheets can provide a number of surface active sites and allow incident light to be reflected multiple times within the Bi5O7I nanosheets, thus improving the light utilization. Under the protection of Bi5O7I nanosheets, CdS quantum dots which are deposited by a hydrothermal strategy can effectively avoid photocorrosion. In addition, the introduction of Ag nanoparticles and CdS quantum dots extends the photoresponse to the near infrared (NIR) region. The photocatalytic degradation rate of Bi5O7I/Ag/CdS composites with a CdS content of 5.76 wt% exhibits the best photocatalytic activity, which is several times higher than that of pristine Bi5O7I. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is about 10 times higher than that over Bi5O7I nanosheets. Moreover, the photothermal efficiency of Bi5O7I/Ag/CdS is also improved obviously. The results of cyclic experiments show that the composite photocatalysts have high stability. The outstanding photocatalytic and photothermal performance is attributed to the formation of tandem heterojunctions favoring the separation of charge carriers, the 3D hierarchical structure of Bi5O7I offering adequate surface active sites, and the SPR effect of Ag promoting the photothermal effect. These novel Bi5O7I/Ag/CdS tandem heterojunctions may provide a new insight into the synthesis of other photocatalysts with synergistic photocatalytic-photothermal effects.									19	2	0	0	3	0	20			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000500028900017

The study of melt inclusions in minerals is one of the most reliable ways of obtaining direct information on the nature of magmatic processes, allows building a model of formation of intrusions and tracing the evolution of physico-chemical conditions of crystallization of magmatic complexes.The main aim of the research is to prove the magmatic origin of rocks of this massif, which makes it possible to consider the distribution of noble metals in melts, based on the available experimental data.Objects: melt inclusions in Cr-spinel from dunites and wehrlites Medek basite-ultrabasite massifs.Methods. The search for melt inclusions was carried out in accessory Cr-spinel sample isolated from dunites and wehrlite, to determine the nature of the high temperature experiments. For this purpose, the samples were taken (about 50-100 grains of Cr-spinel fraction 0,2-0,5 mm) and placed in a graphite microcontainer with internal dimensions in the first millimeters. Micro containers were tightly closed with graphite covers. Thus, the Cr-spinel in these containers were at temperatures above 1000 degrees C under reducing conditions as a result of the reaction of air oxygen with graphite. The experiments were carried out at high temperatures on the basis of existing methods of investigation of melt inclusions. For maximum transformation of the melt in inclusions into homogeneous glass, quenching into water was carried out. The choice of the temperature regime (1280-1300 degrees C) was determined primarily by the fact that the main task of high-temperature experiments was to melt the contents of inclusions and to obtain glass during hardening, which was then analyzed on a microprobe and a scanning microscope.Result. Conducted research of homogenised melt inclusions glass showed that crystallization of Cr-spinel and containing wehrlite of the ultrabasic Medek massif (East Sayan) were involved in low potassium picrobasalt of melts of normal alkalinity, of the most similar petrochemical characteristics to the data on melt inclusions in Cr-spinel from oceanic complexes. The calculations were made for various mineralogical barometers and different models of crystallization on the basis of compositions of glasses of heated melt inclusions in Cr-spinel in the COMAGMAT program, which showed that the pressure in formation of massive rocks was about 4 kbar (2,8-4,7 kbar); the combined use of mineralogical thermometers and calculations on the basis of glass compositions of heated melt inclusions in Cr-spinel according to PETROLOG and COMAGMAT programs allows us to speak about the formation of dunites from picritoids (MgO 17,85 wt. %) of the melt, since the crystallization of olivine at 1380 degrees C, the formation of wehrlite occurred mainly from picrobasalt (MgO 13,36 wt. %) of the melt with the crystallization of olivine starting from 1280-1275 degrees C, but in much smaller quantities than clinopyroxene, the intensive formation of which was at lower temperatures (starting from 1235-1230 degrees C); a comparative analysis of the results of computational modeling of melt and mineral compositions with data on melt inclusions and real olivines and clinopyroxenes indicates their consistency, as evidenced by the fact of the location of melt inclusions along the calculated trends of melt change, that is, experimental data on inclusions on the one hand confirm the reliability of the calculations, and on the other - this ratio shows that the inclusions are not an accident, but record the natural and theoretically justified evolution of the melt.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2500-1019	2413-1830		WOS:000484352600020

To this end, nanosized SrO coupled porous LaFeO3 (PLFO) nanocomposites have been successfully prepared via a one-pot carbon-sphere-hard-template (CSHT) method. Compared with bare PLFO, the as-prepared optimized nanocomposite exhibits high visible-light photoactivities as shown by over 6-fold and 1.8-fold enhancement for CO2 conversion and for 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) degradation, respectively. Based on the surface photovoltage spectra (SPS), fluorescence spectra (FS) related to the produced OH amount, and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and electrochemical reduction curves, it is demonstrated that the exceptional visible-light photoactivities are mainly attributed to the large surface area due to the porous structure, and the introduced nanosized SrO which acts not only as a platform to accept high level energy electrons (HLEEs) to enhance the charge separation but also as an activator to adsorb and catalyze CO2 (O-2) to promote the surface chemical reactions. Additionally, this efficient strategy is versatile for other alkaline earth metal oxides, such as MgO, CaO and BaO. In comparison with the different alkaline earth metal oxide modifications, it is proven that SrO is the best one to couple with PLFO, attributed to it having the most enhanced charge separation and greatest ability to adsorb and catalyze CO2 (O-2). This work concludes that alkaline earth metal oxide modification is feasible for the promotion of the photocatalytic activity for CO2 conversion and organic pollutant degradation.									18	1	0	0	2	0	18			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000471908600011

In this investigation, a novel route to study on synthesis, interaction, kinetics and mechanism of hybrid zinc oxide-graphene oxide (ZnO-GO) nanocomposite using microwave assisted facile hydrothermal method has been reported. The results shows that the ZnO-GO nanocomposite exhibits an enhancement and acts as stable photo-response degradation performance of Brilliant Yellow under the UV light radiation better than pure GO and ZnO nanoparticles. The microwave exposure played a vital role in the synthesis process, it facilitates with well define crystalline structure, porosity and fine morphology of ZnO/GO nanocomposite. Different molar concentrations of ZnO precursors doped to GO sheets were been synthesized, characterized and their photodegradation performances were investigated. The optical studies by UV-vis and Photo Luminescence shows an increase in band gap of nanocomposite, which added an advantage in photodegradation performance. The in situ flower like ZnO nano particles are were densely decorated and anchored on the surfaces of graphene oxide sheets which aids in the enhancement of the surface area, adsorption, mass transfer of dyes and evolution of oxygen species. The nanocomposite having high surface area and micro/mesoporous in nature. This structure and morphology supports significantly in increasing photo catalytic performance legitimate to the efficient photosensitized electron injection and repressed electron recombination due to electron transfer process with GO as electron collector and transporter dependent on the proportion of GO in ZnO/GO composite.

(strain PCC 6803). Y-D is the symmetry-related tyrosine that is homologous to the essential photoactive Tyr161(Y-Z) of the D1 polypeptide of PSII. We compared the flash-induced yield of O-2 in intact, functional PSII centers from both wild-type and mutant PSII core complexes. The yield of O-2 in the intact holo-enzyme was found to be identical in the mutant and wild-type PSII cores using long (saturating) pulses or continuous illumination, but was observed to be appreciably reduced in the mutant using short (nonsaturating) light pulses (<50 ms). We also compared the rates of the first two kinetically resolved steps of photoactivation. Photoactivation is the assembly process for binding of the inorganic cofactors to the apo-water oxidation/PSII complex (apo-WOC-PSII) and their light-induced photooxidation to form the functional Mn4Ca1Clx core required for 02 evolution. We show that the D2-Tyr160Phe mutant cores can assemble a functional WOC from the free inorganic cofactors, but at a much slower rate and with reduced quantum efficiency vs wild-type PSII cores. Both of these observations imply that the presence Of Y-D(.) leads to a more efficient photooxidation of the Mn cluster relative to deactivation (reductive processes). One possible explanation for this behavior is that the phenolic proton on Y-D is retained within the reaction center following Y-D oxidation. The positive charge, likely shared by D2-His189 and other residues, raises the reduction potential of P680(+)/P-680, thereby increasing the driving force for the oxidation of Mn4YZ. There is, therefore, a competitive advantage to organisms that retain the Y-D residue, possibly explaining its retention in all sequences of psbD (encoding the D2 polypeptide) known to date. We also find that the sequence of metal binding steps during assembly of apo-WOC-PSII centers in cyanobacteria cores differs from that in higher plants. This is seen by a reduced calcium affinity at its effector site and reduced competition for binding to the Mn(II) site, resulting in acceleration of the initial lagtime by Ca2+, in contrast to retardation in spinach. Ca2+ binding to its effector site promotes the stability of the photointermediates (IM1 and above) by suppressing unproductive decay.									42	2	0	0	28	0	43			0006-2960			WOS:000173374500032	11790121

We report the facile synthesis of nickel phosphides and rare transition metal-induced phase transformations within this system. Phase selective synthesis of pure Ni2P or Ni5P4 was achieved by decomposition of nickel acetate tetrahydrate Ni(AC)(2)center dot 4H(2)O in optimized mixed solvent systems, i.e., in tri-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO)/tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP) or hexadecylamine (HDA)/TOP, respectively, by hot injection route. The doping of 5% Cu or Mn in either of the nickel phosphide phases yielded a mixture of phases (Ni2P/Ni5P4). However, increasing the Cu or Mn content to 10% resulted in the complete transformation of phase, i.e., from Ni2P to pure Ni5P4 and vice versa. Lattice stress and size of incorporated dopants, as well as the nature of surfactants employed, were discussed as probable causes of these rare phase transformations. Moreover, in order to establish structure-activity relationship, we studied the comparative effect of transition metal dopants in both nickel rich and nickel deficient phases. Therefore, initially formed and transformed phosphides were investigated as electrocatalysts for overall water splitting and supercapacitance. NiP-5 (Ni2P formed on 10% Cu doping of Ni5P4) delivered a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with the lowest overpotential of 146 mV among all samples for HER while NiP-3 (Ni5P4 formed from Ni2P on 10% Cu doping) similarly required the least overpotential of 276 mV for the OER at the same current density. NiP-2 (pristine Ni5P4) had the highest calculated specific capacitance of 1325 F g(-1) at 2 A g(-1). These phase transformations resulted in better catalytic activity and stability as well as reaction kinetics indicating suitability in practical water splitting technologies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000749689700001

The ligand variations allow for the testing of effects of ligand donor ability and steric factors. Copper-dioxygen complex stabilities, preference for formation of 1:1 Cu-O2 and/or 2:1 Cu2-O2 adducts, Cu(n)-O2 (n = 1, 2), spectroscopic properties, and reactivity characteristics have been investigated, The ligands are L = tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TMPA), bis(2-pyridylmethyl)(2-quinolylmethyl)amine(BPQA), bis(2-quinolylmethyl)(2-pyridylmethyl)amine(BQPA), and tris(2-quinolylmethyl)-amine (TMQA). The 2:1 adduct [{(TMPA)CU}2(O2)]2+ (1c), with a trans-(mu-1,2-peroxo)dicopper(II) structure, has previously been shown to form reversibly from the interaction of O2 with the copper(I) complex [(TMPA)-Cu(RCN)]+ (1a) (R = Me, Et) (Tyklar, Z.; et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993,115, 2677). The corresponding Cu(I) complexes [(BPQA)Cu]+ (2a), [(BQPA)Cu]+ (3a), and [(TMQA)Cu]+ (4a) have been synthesized as either PF6- or ClO4- salts. They lack an RCN nitrile ligand as isolated solids, but 2a-4a appear to coordinate nitriles in MeCN or EtCN solutions. The X-ray structure of 4a has been determined (triclinic space group P1BAR, a = 13.130 (2), b = 16.570 (2), c = 12.956 (2) angstrom, alpha = 111.44 (1) beta = 98.49 (1), gamma = 84.46 (1)degrees; V = 2592.1 (6) angstrom3; Z = 2), and it exhibits a pseudotetrahedral coordination to the alkylamine and three quinolyl N-donors. Copper(I) complexes 2a and 3a react with triphenylphosphine to form adducts [LCu(PPh3)]+ (2d, 3d). The X-ray structure of 3d (monoclinic space group C2/c; a = 16.341 (4), b = 19.017 (6), c = 26.860 (7) angstrom; beta = 105.48 (2)degrees, V = 8044 (4) angstrom3; Z = 8) indicates that one of the quinolyl arms of the BQPA ligand is uncoordinated and dangles away from the Cu(I) ion, leaving a distorted tetrahedral coordination, comprising N(pyridyl), N(quinolyl), N(alkylamino), and P copper ligation. Cyclic voltammetric measurements carried out on 1a-4a plus [(TMPA')Cu(CH3CN)]+ (1a'; TMPA' possesses a -C(O)Me ester group attached to the 5-position of one pyridyl ring of TMPA) show that the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox potentials can be greatly influenced by these ligand variations. E1/2 values span a large range, from -0.61 to -0.24 V for 1a-4a, versus Ag/AgNO3 in dimethylformamide; the value for 1a' is -0.56 V. The BPQA complex 2a reacts rapidly with O2 at -80-degrees-C in EtCN solvent to give an intensely purple stable solution adduct [{(BPQA)Cu}2(O2)]2+ (2c), as evidenced by manometric O2-uptake measurements (CU:O2 = 2:1) and the UV-vis spectrum, which closely resembles that of 1c, with lambda(max) = 535 (epsilon = 10 500 M-1 cm-1), ca. 440 (sh, epsilon = 2000 M-1 cm-1), and ca. 600 nm (sh, epsilon = 7600 M-1 cm-1). The chemical reactivity parallels that of lc; reaction with PPh3 gives 2d with evolution of O2, while exposure to H+ produces hydrogen peroxide in 94% yield, as determined by iodometric titration. The BQPA-containing complex 3a reacts to form a dark brown adduct [(BQPA)Cu(O2)]+ (3b), which is stable at -80-degrees-C in EtCN. Manometry (Cu:O2 = 1:1) and the drastically different UV-vis characteristics with lambda(max) = 378 nm (epsilon = 8200 M-1 cm-1) attest to its formulation as a 1:1 adduct, formally a Cu(II)-superoxide species.Reactions of 3b with PPh3 and H+ proceed with formation of products analogous to those found with 2c, and phosphine adduct 3d could be isolated. Reaction of 3b with the TMPA results in a ligand-exchange reaction, with production of peroxo species 1c, as followed by UV-vis spectroscopy at -80-degrees-C. The binding of O2 to 3a to give 1:1 adduct 3b is reversible, as demonstrated by cycling experiments, i.e., the alternate and repetitive removal of O2 from 3b by application of a vacuum, followed by reoxygenation of 3a; this process was monitored spectrophotometrically. Steric factors are seen to be important in this unique stabilization of the Cu-O2 complex 3b. With the even more bulky TMQA ligand complex 4a, no reaction with O2 is observed. Possible structures of the Cu-bound O2 ligand in 1:1 adduct 3b are enumerated. Dioxygen binding characteristics and variations observed for 1a-4a and 1a' are examined in terms of electronic (i.e. redox) characteristics and steric effects and in light of recent complete kinetic-thermodynamic characterization of the O2-binding in 1a-3a (Karlin, K. D.; et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 9506). Steric and not electronic effects appear to predominate in determining the O2-reaction chemistry. The biological relevance of 2:1 and 1:1 Cu:O2 adduct chemistry is also mentioned.									154	1	0	0	14	0	155			0020-1669			WOS:A1994NJ34400036

In the course of the photoinhibitory illumination, F-M, F-V/F-M and the amount of functional PS II declined continuously whereas F-O dropped rapidly to some extent and then slowly increased. If the experiments were done at room temperature, termination of the photoinhibitory illumination resulted in partial relaxation of the F-V/F-M ratio and in an increase in F-O and F-M. The relaxation was completed in 10-15 min after short-term (15 min) photoinhibitory treatment but continued 30-40 min if the exposure to high light was longer than 1 h. No changes in the amount of functional PS II accompanied the relaxation of F-V/F-M in darkness or in low light, in the presence of lincomycin. Transferring the leaves to low temperature (+4 degrees C) after the room-temperature illumination (2 h) completely inhibited the relaxation of F-V/F-M. Low temperature did not suppress the relaxation if the photoinhibitory illumination had also been done at low temperature. The results indicate that illumination of lincomycin-poisoned pumpkin leaves at room temperature does not lead to accumulation of a reversibly photoinactivated intermediate.									17	1	0	0	15	0	18			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1995TQ94500006	24301535

Anode electrocatalysts containing Nickel, Mo compound, and carbon support were synthesized at different weight ratios of Ni and Mo2C (or MoS2) while keeping the carbon support weight constant in each catalyst combination to investigate the best weight ratio among our range. Physical characterizations of the electrocatalysts were investigated by XRD, XPS, SEM-EDS, EDAX, and TEM techniques. Electrochemical performance of the catalysts was studied via cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and chronoamperometry (CA) by using a home-made electrochemical cell test system exhibiting similar alkaline direct ethanol fuel cell (ADEFC) architecture by giving the opportunity of using an anion exchange membrane. All of the Ni-Mo2C/C and Ni-MoS2/C at different weight ratios were shown better performance than pristine Ni and Ni/C. The highest current density was measured with Ni-Mo2C/C-2 (11.4 mA cm(-2)) anode catalyst, which exhibits the highest electrochemical reaction rate. The diffusion coefficient of the catalysts was calculated by using the data from linear LSV. CA experiment results showed that the tolerance for catalytic poisoning and durability of Ni-Mo2C/C-2 was better among all the electrocatalysts.HighlightsLiterature survey showed that Mo2C and MoS2 are promising co-catalysts for EOR. However, there is a lack of study on the use of Mo2C or MoS2 as co-catalyst with a non-noble metal.Molybdenum compound containing transition metal-based anode electro-catalysts were synthesized for EOR in alkaline media.A home-made electrochemical cell is designed to make the system more similar to an ADEFC system.The results of the electrochemical characterizations are showed that the Mo compound addition increased the catalytic activity and stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000627163700001

Although Fe(II)-oxidizing process is mediated by both abiotic and biotic reactions, microorganisms involved in the process have not been well studied in paddy field soil. The present study investigated the community structure of microaerophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) in the family Gallionellaceae in the plow layer of paddy fields located in the central (Anjo) and northeastern (Omagari) Japan since the members in the family are the typical FeOB in circumneutral freshwater environments and possibly have the significant role for Fe(II) oxidation in paddy field soils. A primer set targeting 16S rRNA gene of Gallionella-related FeOB was newly designed for the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses. DGGE analysis showed significant differences in the band patterns between the field sites. Besides, minor differences were observed in the patterns between the soil depths (0-1 cm and below 1 cm) in the Anjo field, while the patterns were relatively stable in the Omagari field during the annual rice cultivation practices. In total 54 bands were sequenced and clustered into 20 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) on the basis of the 97% similarity. Eighteen out of twenty OTUs (50 of 54 bands) were affiliated within the FeOB cluster of Gallionellaceae, some of which were clustered with known microaerophilic FeOB, Ferrigenium kumadai, Ferriphaselus amnicola, 'Sideroxydans lithotrophicus' and 'S. paludicola'. The number of the 16S rRNA gene copies was 10(5)-10(7) and 10(6)-10(8) copies g(-1) dried soil in the two paddy fields and negatively correlated to the contents of acetate-extractable Fe(II) in the soils during the rice cultivation period. These results suggested inhabitance of considerable number of diverse Gallionella-related FeOB and their potential involvement in the Fe(II)-oxidizing process of soil, especially during the rice cultivation period in the paddy field soils.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0038-0768	1747-0765		WOS:000488002300001

The thermal decomposition of the xerogel and the evolution of crystallization behavior of Na-beta"/beta-Al2O3 were studied. The obtained powders have been unambiguously characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The Mg2+ stabilized Na-beta"/beta-Al2O3 crystallized gradually from amorphous phase to metastable intermediate phases and further formed the major phase at 1000 degrees C. The results showed that the large surface area of the amorphous intermediate phase with mesoporous structure followed by the generation of intermediate phases named as m-Al2O3 and MgAl2O4 with spinel structure to a great extent promoted the formation of Na-beta"/beta-Al2O3 phase. The Na-beta"/beta-Al2O3 nano-powders exhibited a plate-like two dimensional structure with clear crystallographic plane for Na+ diffusion. The transformation from m-Al2O3 only required the shift of Na+ from alternate layers of oxygen and the accommodation of every fifth layer since the structure of m-Al2O3 is only slightly different from that of Na-beta"/beta-Al2O3. The relative density of the sintered ceramic was approximately 98.8% and the ionic conductivity can reach 0.24 S cm(-1) at 350 degrees C. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our results show that the most stable adsorption site for single metal atom on anatase TiO2 (101) surface is the bridge site formed by two twofold coordinated oxygen (O-2c) atoms at the step edge. Due to the charge transfer from metal atoms to anatase TiO2 (101) surface, the work function of adsorbed surface is significantly smaller than the clean one, indicating enhanced surface activity. Fukui functions are highly localized around the isolated metal atoms, indicating that single metal atoms on anatase TiO2 (101) surface serve as the active reduction and oxidation sites in the photocatalytic process. Photo-induced electrons in the electronically excited TiO(2 )photocatalyst can be transferred to target species through the deposited single atoms. The band structures of host TiO2 are almost unchanged upon the adsorption, and the metal induced states are located in the band gap of the host. Remarkably, due to the metal atoms adsorption, the upward shift of conduction band edge will improve the reducing capacity of anatase TiO2. Moreover, when single metal atoms are adsorbed, potential energy of topmost surface Ti atoms turns to get close to the vacuum level, which significantly facilitates the electron transfer for hydrogen evolution. Results in this work provide new insights into improving the photocatalytic performance by single metal atoms adsorption.

In this study, we report the definition of miR-210 as a miRNA regulated by hypoxia in lung cancer and melanoma, documenting its involvement in blunting the susceptibility of tumor cells to lysis by antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). miR-210 was induced in hypoxic zones of human tumor tissues. Its attenuation in hypoxic cells significantly restored susceptibility to autologous CTL-mediated lysis, independent of tumor cell recognition and CTL reactivity. A comprehensive approach using transcriptome analysis, argonaute protein immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter assay revealed that the genes PTPN1, HOXA1, and TP53I11 were miR-210 target genes regulated in hypoxic cells. In support of their primary importance in mediating the immunosuppressive effects of miR-210, coordinate silencing of PTPN1, HOXA1, and TP53I11 dramatically decreased tumor cell susceptibility to CTL-mediated lysis. Our findings show how miR-210 induction links hypoxia to immune escape from CTL-mediated lysis, by providing a mechanistic understanding of how this miRNA mediates immunosuppression in oxygen-deprived regions of tumors where cancer stem-like cells and metastatic cellular behaviors are known to evolve.

Oxygen content in water is not only one of the most important restrictive factors but also one of the most important conditions for the growth of fish. The sensitivity to oxygen is determined by the amino acid sequence of the globin gene. So it is important to try to elucidate the globin gene struc-ture . A pair of consensus degenerate primes was designed basing on N-terminal and C-terminal conservative amino acid of (3 chain. Primer A is 5' GT (GTAC)GA(ATGC)TGGAC(ATGC) GA( CT) ( CG) (AC) (ATGC)GA3;; Primer B is 5'TG(AG)TA (CT)T(CG)(CT)CT(ATGC)CA(ATGC)A(AG)(ATGC)GC 3'. Using RT-PCR method, (3 globin cDNA was amplified and cloned from total RNA that was extracted from blood of three fishes that are widely distribution in China ( Cyprinus carpio ; Ctenopharyngodon idellus ; Carassius auratus) . The results of the positive clones show the coding sequence is 441 nucleotides in leagth in C. carpio, C. idellus, C. auratus ( accession number in GeneBank is AF528161, AF528160, AF528159). The A + T residues of fi globin coding sequence of C. idellus , C. carpio , C. auratus is 44.52 % , 44. 29 % , and 45 .45 % re-spectively . In order to characterize the structure of the (3 globin gene at the DNA level, genomic DNA was amplified using specif-ic primers based on cDNA sequence. The result shows that the fragments of Cyprinus carpio ; Ctenopharyngodon idellus ; Caras-sius auratus [3 globin gene from initiation codon to termination codon is 667bp, 629bp, 667bp respectively. The genomic DNA has 3 extrons and 2 introns which insertion positions are the first splitting codon 30 and the second separating codons 105 and 106. Both introns are extremely rich in A + T residues. In C. carpio , C. auratus and C. idellus intron 1 is 112bp, 102bp, 102bp in length and 65.59%, 65.69%, 62.83% A + T respectively, whereas intron 2 is 121bp, 121bp, 73bp long and 61.11% , 11.01% , 63 .89% A + T respectively. The splice junctions of both introns conform to the GT/AG rule, containing GT at their 5' donor junctions and AG at their 3' acceptor sites. Globin is species-specific. Globins from different species will have different amino acid sequence and different affinity for oxygen. The three species in this paper belong to cyprinoid. They are closely related. But they differ in their sensitivity to low oxygen content in water, which is linked to the need for dealing with a changing environment or different habitats. So, to study the relationship among the structure of globin gene, affinity for oxygen and hemoglobin is practical significance to the aquatic products industry.			根据beta珠蛋白的N末端和C末端氨基酸序列的保守性设计20bp长的简并引物,用RT-PCR方法扩增并克隆了鲤、草鱼、鲫的beta珠蛋白基因cDNA.结果显示克隆3种鱼的beta珠蛋白基因cDNA全长为441bp.对它们所编码的氨基酸序列的比较可以看出虽然它们都属于鲤科但氨基酸的组成却有较大的差异.根据所克隆的cDNA分别设计特异引物用PCR方法克隆了3种鱼的基因组DNA全长;从起始密码子到终止密码子的长度分别为鲤667bp、草鱼629bp、鲫667bp.3种鱼中均含有3个外显子和2个内含子且内含子的插入位置相同.内含子的碱基序列差异很大.鲫与鲤内含子1和2的长度完全相同,而与草鱼的内含子长度则相差较大.						0	3	0	0	3	0	3			1000-3207			CSCD:1870640

"Water In Star-forming regions with Herschel" (WISH) is a Herschel key program investigating the water chemistry in young stellar objects (YSOs) during protostellar evolution. Hydroxyl (OH) is one of the reactants in the chemical network most closely linked to the formation and destruction of H2O. High-temperature (T greater than or similar to 250 K) chemistry connects OH and H2O through the OH + H-2 double left right arrow H2O + H reactions. Formation of H2O from OH is efficient in the high-temperature regime found in shocks and the innermost part of protostellar envelopes. Moreover, in the presence of UV photons, OH can be produced from the photo-dissociation of H2O through H2O + gamma(UV) double right arrow OH + H.Methods. High-resolution spectroscopy of the 163.12 mu m triplet of OH towards HH 46 and NGC 1333 IRAS 2A was carried out with the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared (HIFI) on board the Herschel Space Observatory. The low-and intermediate-mass protostars HH 46, TMR 1, IRAS 15398-3359, DK Cha, NGC 7129 FIRS 2, and NGC 1333 IRAS 2A were observed with the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) on Herschel in four transitions of OH and two [OI] lines.Results. The OH transitions at 79, 84, 119, and 163 mu m and [OI] emission at 63 and 145 mu m were detected with PACS towards the class I low-mass YSOs as well as the intermediate-mass and class I Herbig Ae sources. No OH emission was detected from the class 0 YSO NGC 1333 IRAS 2A, though the 119 mu m was detected in absorption. With HIFI, the 163.12 mu m was not detected from HH 46 and only tentatively detected from NGC 1333 IRAS 2A. The combination of the PACS and HIFI results for HH 46 constrains the line width (FWHM greater than or similar to 11 km s(-1)) and indicates that the OH emission likely originates from shocked gas. This scenario is supported by trends of the OH flux increasing with the [OI] flux and the bolometric luminosity, as found in our sample. Similar OH line ratios for most sources suggest that OH has comparable excitation temperatures despite the different physical properties of the sources.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			0004-6361			WOS:000284150900036

When nanoparticles instead of their bulk counterpart are used the synthesis method plays a fundamental role in defining specific structural properties. Between the different gas-phase synthesis techniques, the CO2 laser pyrolysis is a versatile method allowing for the preparation of nanostructures of various chemical compositions. Here we demonstrate that pure and Fe-doped TiO2 nanoparticles with rather low Fe concentration may be prepared by applying the sensitized IR laser pyrolysis to a gas mixtures containing titanium tetrachloride, air and iron pentacarbonyl (vapors). The structures of TiO2-based particles were systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. Depending on the synthesis parameters, the nanoparticle system contains mixtures of anatase and rutile, with a preponderance of the anatase phase. Higher rutile proportion was found in the iron-doped samples. Mean particle diameters of around 14 nm and 12 nm were estimated for undoped and doped anatase titania, respectively. From UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra, higher absorbance and red shifted absorption were evidenced at higher amount of doped iron. Preliminary evaluation tests of the UV photoactivity of samples were performed by using the scanning electrochemical microscopy for determining the evolution of the oxygen consumption in the presence of IV-chlorophenol. They show that the undoped nano titania samples perform better than the reference P25 Degussa sample. A drop of the nano-titania photoactivity as a consequence of Fe doping was observed. Possible reasons of this effect are tentatively discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									16	2	0	0	0	0	18			1350-4495	1879-0275		WOS:000275849800004

Excess power can be converted to H-2 via water electrolysis, but the conversion cost is currently too high. One way to decrease the cost of electrolysis is to increase the maximum productivity of electrolyzers. This study investigates how nano- and microstructured porous electrodes can improve the productivity of H-2 generation in a zero-gap, flow-through alkaline water electrolyzer. Three nickel electrodes-foam, microfiber felt, and nanowire felt-are studied to examine the tradeoff between surface area and pore structure on the performance of alkaline electrolyzers. Although the nanowire felt with the highest surface area initially provides the highest performance, this performance quickly decreases as gas bubbles are trapped within the electrode. The open structure of the foam facilitates bubble removal, but its small surface area limits its maximum performance. The microfiber felt exhibits the best performance because it balances high surface area with the ability to remove bubbles. The microfiber felt maintains a maximum current density of 25 000 mA cm(-2) over 100 h without degradation, which corresponds to a hydrogen production rate 12.5- and 50-times greater than conventional proton-exchange membrane and alkaline electrolyzers, respectively.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000535021100001

The morphologies of g-C3N4 diversify owing to different preparation condition of MA-CA supramolecular, which is far from satisfactory to be explained by the mechanism of self-templating of precursors during calcination. To disclose the hidden rules of shape variety of g-C3N4 derived from MA-CA, we fabricate MA-CA mixture/supramoleculars with ill-defined morphologies using the mechanochemical technique. After polymerization, the obtained g-C3N4 samples are in the shapes of hollow nanorods (HNR), nanotubes (NT), and porous nanosheets (NS) depending on the hydrogen bonding degree between CA and MA in the starting materials. The photocatalytic activity of these g-C3N4 samples in H2 evolution and organic pollutants degradation increases with the rising of surface areas with the exception of g-C3N4 NS. The relatively lower photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 NS than hollow and tubular g-C3N4 samples can be attributed to its more positive CB position and worse photogenerated carrier separation ability. The cavity void of hollow and tubular g-C3N4 samples realizes the enrichment of reactive oxygen species and organic pollutants into a local microenvironment, which provides a driving force to facilitate the oxidation degradation of pollutants.

X-ray diffraction analysis indicates nanocomposites' evolution having the ZnO wurtzite structure with increase in crystallite size and Y2O3 phase segregation, as confirmed by the appearance and gradual growth of the Y2O3 peak. Field emission scanning electron microscopy observations reveal irregular spherical morphology with increased agglomeration due to Y2O3 loading. Diffuse reflectance spectra exhibit bandgap widening and red shift of the absorption edge with the doping process. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis denotes improved porosity as manifested by the surface area, pore diameter, and pore volume increments after yttrium loading. Fortuitously, photocatalysts demonstrate excellent photodegradation rates for CR dye, reaching 93% at a higher rate of 43 x 10(-3) min(-1). The photocomposite 1% Y2O3-ZnO exhibits a threefold enhancement in the visible photocatalytic process in an aqueous solution. The photocatalytic performance is discussed in detail concerning pH and oxygen species, which contribute to the photodegradation of CR dye. The results obtained in this study clearly highlight the superior performance (Y2O3)(n) ZnO as a highly efficient photocatalyst in the degradation of dyes in water.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000604333400041

The FeOOH is prepared on the 3C-SiC photoanode surface by hydrothermal deposition, followed by a photoassisted electrodeposition of NiOOH. It is shown that the Ni:FeOOH layer is composed of the beta-FeOOH nanorods with a conformal coating of the amorphous NiOOH. Under AM1.5G 100 mW cm(-2) illumination, the 3C-SiC/Ni:FeOOH photoanode exhibits a very low onset potential of 0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (V-RHE) and a high photocurrent density of 1.15 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE, distinctly outperforming the 3C-SiC and the 3C-SiC/FeOOH counterparts. Open-circuit potential and impedance spectroscopy results demonstrate that the nanostructured Ni:FeOOH layer on the 3C-SiC surface increases the photovoltage and promotes the charge transfer toward the electrolyte, thus significantly improving the PEC water-splitting performance. These results provide new insights for the development of photoanodes toward efficient solar-fuel generation.									13	2	0	0	1	0	14			2367-198X			WOS:000489145200001

Ground state properties are calculated using the importance-sampled rigid-body diffusion Monte Carlo method, rotational excited state calculations are made with the projection operator imaginary time spectral evolution method, and Bose permutation exchange and associated superfluid properties are calculated with the finite temperature path integral method. For Nless than or equal to5 the helium atoms are seen to form an equatorial ring around the molecular axis, at N=6 helium density starts to occupy the second (local) minimum of the N2O-He interaction at the oxygen side of the molecule, and N=9 is the critical size at which there is onset of helium solvation all along the molecular axis. For Ngreater than or equal to8 six He-4 atoms are distributed in a symmetric, quasirigid ring around N2O. Path integral calculations show essentially complete superfluid response to rotation about the molecular axis for Ngreater than or equal to5, and a rise of the perpendicular superfluid response from zero to appreciable values for Ngreater than or equal to8. Rotational excited states are computed for three values of the total angular momentum, J=1-3, and the energy levels fitted to obtain effective spectroscopic constants that show excellent agreement with the experimentally observed N dependence of the effective rotational constant B-eff. The non-monotonic behavior of the rotational constant is seen to be due to the onset of long He-4 permutation exchanges and associated perpendicular superfluid response of the clusters for Ngreater than or equal to8. We provide a detailed analysis of the role of the helium solvation structure and superfluid properties in determining the effective rotational constants.

J	Stanton, TB; Sellwood, R								Cloning and characteristics of a gene encoding NADH oxidase, a major mechanism for oxygen metabolism by the anaerobic spirocheta, Brachyspira (Serpulina) hyodysenteriae								ANAEROBE				5	5			539	546		10.1006/anae.1999.0196				OCT 1999	1999	Brachyspira (Serpulina) hyodysenteriae cells consume oxygen during growth under a 1%O-2:99%N-2 atmosphere. A major mechanism of O-2 metabolism by this anaerobic spirochete is the enzyme NADH oxidase (EC 1.6.99.3). In these investigations, the NADH oxidase gene (nox) of B, hyodysenteriae strain B204 was cloned,expressed in Escherichia coli, and sequenced. By direct cloning of a Hind III-digested DNA fragment which hybridized with a nor DNA probe and by amplification of B204 DNA through the use of inverse PCR techniques, overlapping portions of the nor gene were identified and sequenced. The nor gene and flanking chromosome regions (1.7 kb total) were then amplified and cloned into plasmid pCRII. Lysates of E. coli cells transformed with this recombinant plasmid expressed NADH oxidase activity (1.1 mu mol NADH oxidized/min/mg protein) and contained a protein reacting with swine antiserum raised against purified B. hyodysenteriae NADH oxidase. The nor ORF (1.3 kb) encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 50 158 kDa. The B, hyodysenteriae NADH oxidase shares significant (46%) amino acid sequence identity and common functional domains with the NADH oxidases of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus mutans, suggesting a common evolutionary origin for these proteins. Cloning of the B. hyodysenteriae nor gene is an important step towards the goal of generating B. hyodysenteriae mutant strains lacking NADH oxidase and for investigating the significance of NADH oxidase in the physiology and pathogenesis of this anaerobic spirochete.(C) 1999 Academic Press.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			1075-9964			WOS:000085624300005

In this study, a novel holistic simulation approach using a low-parameterized model was applied to predict pollutant transport, conversion, and electrical processes of mixed-culture single-chamber MFCs. The proposed whole-cell model couples the combined bioelectrochemical-electrical model with the well-established Activated Sludge Model No.1 (ASM1) and specific equations from ASM2. The cathodic gas-liquid mass transfer of oxygen and free ammonia nitrogen was described in terms of a diffusion film model, while the diminishing diffusivity due to salt deposits was considered via a fouling decline kinetic model. The predictive capacity of the model was validated using experimental data of three continuous-flow single-chamber MFCs operated with municipal wastewater for 150 days. Electrochemical parameters were estimated in real-time by pulse-width modulated connection of the external electrical load resistance. Following a sensitivity analysis, the most relevant model parameters were optimized through the Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain method using the adaptive Metropolis algorithm. All other parameters were adopted from benchmark simulation studies. The simulated relative contributions of aerobic carbon oxidation, denitrification, electrogenesis, and methanogenesis to the total COD removal rate were 21-22%, 44-45%, 21-25%, and 9-14%. Overall, the presented whole-cell model is able to successfully predict the evolution of electricity generation, methane production, and effluent concentrations (soluble COD and total ammonia nitrogen) under different hydraulic conditions and organic loading rates.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000833523700003

Fibers with the diameter ranging from nanometer to micrometer have unique properties, such as large surface area and large pore volume. These properties make 1D photocatalysts effective. This article deals with obtaining composite fibers based on strontium titanate (SrTiO3) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as a precursor by the electrospinning method. For maintaining the alignment and overall orientation of fibers during electrospinning, "H-type" collector made from inexpensive aluminium foil was used. A special shape of collector leads to the change of electric field in the space between the needle and collector, thus allowing obtaining aligned fibers. As a result, aligned composite SrTiO3/PAN fibers with overall orientation were obtained. The diameter of the obtained fibers ranges from 2 to 4 mu m and particles of SrTiO3 are uniformly distributed alongside their structure. The resulting fibers were used as 1D photocatalyst for evolution of hydrogen by splitting the water-methanol mixture.									14	1	0	0	0	0	15			0009-2614	1873-4448		WOS:000500939400008

In this work, we report a facile and broad-spectrum impregnation method to construct two POM@MOF composites, Ni3PW10@NU-1000 and Ni3P2W16@NU-1000, by respectively incorporating a tri-Ni-substituted Keggin-type (K6Na[Ni3(H2O)3PW10O39H2O], denoted as K6Na-Ni3PW10) and a Wells-Dawson-type (Na4Li5[Ni3(OH)3(H2O)3P2W16O59], denoted as Na4Li5-Ni3P2W16) polyoxometalate into a mesoporous Zrbased metal-organic framework (NU-1000). Under minimally optimized conditions, the resulting POM@MOF composites can effectively photocatalyze hydrogen production with superior long-term stability and reusability, achieving a hydrogen evolving rate of 3482 and 13051 mu mol g-1 h-1 for Ni3PW10@NU-1000 and Ni3P2W16@NU-1000, respectively. Various photophysical and spectroscopic analyses elucidated the possible photocatalytic mechanism and the catalytic difference between two POM@MOF composites.									25	1	0	0	1	0	26			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000651114800004

The films were synthesized using pulsed filtered cathodic arc and magnetron sputter deposition, i.e. techniques far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Catalytic particles were formed by thermally cycling thin films of the Pd-Pt-O system. The evolution and phase formation in such films as a function of temperature were discussed in terms of the stability of PdO and PtO(2) in air. The catalytic efficiency was found to be strongly affected by the chemical composition, with oxidized palladium definitely playing a major role in the combustion of methane. Reactive sputter deposition of thin films in the Pd-Zr-Y-O system allowed us forming microstructures ranging from nanocrystalline zirconia to palladium nanoparticles embedded in a (Zr,Y)(4)Pd(2)O matrix. The sequence of phase formation is put in relation to simple thermodynamic considerations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, nanostructured NiFe-layered double hydroxide and Pt nanoparticles are selected as catalysts for the anode and cathode, respectively. The seawater electrolyzer is tested successfully for 100 h at maximum current densities of 200 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V employing surrogate sea water and compared to fresh water feeds. Different membrane studies are carried out to reveal the cause of the current density drop. During long-term dynamic tests, under simulated day-night cycles, an unusual cell power performance recovery effect is uncovered, which is subsequently harnessed in a long-term diurnal day-night cycle test. The natural day-night cycles of the electrolyzer input power can be conceived as a reversible catalyst materials recovery treatment of the device when using photovoltaic electricity sources. To understand the origin of this reversible recovery on a molecular materials level, in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure and X-ray near-edge region spectra are applied.									90	3	0	0	4	0	92			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000440805400006

Posttranslational processing of the pD1 protein is essential to establish water oxidation activity of the PSII complex. We have recently identified a gene, ctpA, a mutation in which resulted in a loss of PSII activity in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. To study the function of the CtpA protein, we inactivated the ctpA gene by inserting a kanamycin-resistance gene into its coding sequence. The resultant mutant strain, T564, had no PSII-mediated water oxidation activity, but it had normal cytochrome b(6)f and photosystem I activities. Measurements of thermoluminescence profiles and rates of reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol indicated that PSII complexes in the mutant cells had functional reaction centers that were unable to accept electrons from water. Immunoblot analysis showed that D1, D2, CP47, CP43, and the alpha subunit of cytochrome b(559), five integral membrane proteins of PSII, were present in T564 cells. Interestingly, the DI protein in the mutant cells was 2 kDa larger than that in wild-type cells, due to the presence of a C-terminal extension. We conclude that the CtpA protein is a processing enzyme that cleaves off the C-terminal extension of the D1 protein. Interestingly, the CtpA protein shows significant sequence similarity to the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding proteins in the bovine, human, and insect eye systems.									132	9	1	0	123	0	144			0027-8424			WOS:A1994PC24200053	8058761

The NO removal rate of the optimal sample Yb-NM-6 was 66.3% (the original NH2-MIL-125(Ti) was only 28.1%), and the hydrogen production was 1883.7993 mu mol g(-1) (the original NH2-MIL-125(Ti) had almost no effect). A series of comparative experiments, in particular cyclic voltammogram tests, showed that the transient Yb-II/III centers were obtained through a non-traditional ligand to linker metal charge transfer (LLMCT) pathway, which was very different from the traditional ligand metal charge transfer (LMCT) pathway, so as to form a novel charge transfer channel to improve photocatalytic performance. This work details a feasible avenue by which to obtain a novel LLMCT pathway through introducing various metal ions anchored on metal-organic frameworks as efficient transient centers to further improve photocatalytic performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000683072000001

After 100 hours of operation at 700 and 800 degrees C, increases in polarization and ohmic resistances are observed. Segregated Sr phase is found inside the LSCF layer after the operation at 800 degrees C. LSCF, GDC, segregated Co phase, segregated Sr phase, GDC interlayer, interdiffusion phase, SZO phase, and YSZ electrolyte are segmented and reconstructed by focused ion beam - scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) to analyze their microstructural characteristics in detail. No significant changes are observed for double phase boundary and triple phase boundary densities. Electrochemical simulations using the three-dimensional structures including all phases are carried out to predict the degradation factor. The increase in polarization resistance is well reproduced by assuming a decrease in the surface exchange rate, On the other hand, the increase in the ohmic resistance is attributed to the constriction of the ionic current in the inter-diffusion layer.

Therefore, HS-AD mathematical simulations need to be approached differently than 'wet' AD simulations. This study aimed to develop a modelling tool based on the anaerobic digestion model 1 (ADM1) capable of simulating the TS and the reactor mass/volume dynamics in HS-AD of OFMSW. Four hypotheses were used, including the effects of apparent concentrations at high TS. The model simulated adequately HS-AD of OFMSW in batch and continuous mode, particularly the evolution of TS, reactor mass, ammonia and volatile fatty acids. By adequately simulating the reactor content mass/volume and the TS, the HS-AD model might bring further insight about potentially inhibitory mechanisms (i.e. NH3 buildup and/or acidification) occurring in HS-AD of OFMSW.

In this study, g-C3N4-IMA-FePcCl16 that was fabricated by axial coordination was applied to activate PMS for carbamazepine (CBZ) degradation. The introduction of imidazole-based ligand (IMA) and iron hexadecachlorophthalocyanine (FePcCl16) facilitates the photogenerated electron-hole pairs separation of g-C3N4 and broadens the visible-light response range. The coordination structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Photocatalytic experiments demonstrated that g-C3N4-IMA-FePcCl16 can highly effective eliminate CBZ with a removal of similar to 95% within 25 min in the presence of PMS. The effects of various experimental parameters on the CBZ degradation were investigated, such as the loading amount of FePcCl16, pH, PMS dosage and anions. It is noteworthy that Cl- has a positive effect on the degradation of CBZ. Another interesting finding is that the degradation of CBZ is attributed to the synergistic effect of multiple active species, which is confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, electron paramagnetic resonance and radical quenching tests. Superoxide radicals (O-2(center dot-)) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) are the dominated active species. This work offers a novel idea for the rational design of high-efficiency photocatalysts for wastewater remediation.									61	6	0	0	28	0	64			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000448181000021

Recently, a novel cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) termed psamFP488 was isolated from the genus Psammocora of reef building corals. Within the cyan color class, psamFP488 is unusual because it exhibits a significantly extended Stokes shift. Here, we applied ultrafast transient absorption and pump-dump-probe spectroscopy to investigate the mechanistic basis of psamFP488 fluorescence, complemented with fluorescence quantum yield and dynamic light scattering measurements. Transient absorption spectroscopy indicated that, upon excitation at 410 nm, the stimulated cyan emission rises in 170 fs. With pump-dump-probe spectroscopy, we observe a very short-lived (110 fa) ground-state intermediate that we assign to the deprotonated, anionic chromophore. In addition, a minor fraction (14%) decays with 3.5 ps to the ground state. Structural analysis of homologous proteins indicates that Glu-167 is likely positioned in sufficiently close vicinity to the chromophore to act as a proton acceptor. Our findings support a model where unusually fast ESPT from the neutral chromophore to Glu-167 with a time constant of 170 fs and resulting emission from the anionic chromophore forms the basis of the large psamFP488 Stokes shift. When dumped to the ground state, the proton on neutral Glu is very rapidly shuttled back to the anionic chromophore in 110 fs. Proton shuttling in excited and ground states is a factor of 20-4000 faster than in GFP, which probably results from a favorable hydrogen-bonding geometry between the chromophore phenolic oxygen and the glutamate acceptor, possibly involving a short hydrogen bond. At any time in the reaction, the proton is localized on either the chromophore or Glu-167, which implies that most likely no low-barrier hydrogen bond exists between these molecular groups. This work supports the notion that proton transfer in biological systems, be it in an electronic excited or ground state, can be an intrinsically fast process that occurs on a 100 fs time scale. PsamFP488 represents an attractive model system that poses an ultrafast proton transfer regime in discrete steps. It constitutes a valuable model system in addition to wild type GFP, where proton transfer is relatively slow, and the S65T/H148D GFP mutant, where the effects of low-barrier hydrogen bonds dominate.									9	2	0	0	5	0	11			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000330161700019	23534404

Photocatalysts in the form of 2D nanosheet possess many inherent advantages over traditional 3D nanopowder photocatalysts, including improved light absorption characteristics, shorter electron and hole migration paths to the photocatalysts' surface (thus minimizing undesirable electron -hole pair recombination), and abundant surface defects which allow band gap modulation and facilitate charge transfer from the semiconductor to adsorbates. When synergistically exploited and optimized, these advantages can impart 2D photocatalysts with remarkable activities relative to their 3D counterparts. Accordingly, a wide range of experimental approaches is now being explored for the synthesis of 2D photocatalysts, with computational methods increasingly being used for identification of promising new 2D photocatalytic materials. Herein, we critically review recent literatures related to 2D photocatalyst development and design. Particular emphasis is placed on 2D photocatalyst synthesis and the importance of computational studies for the fundamental understanding of 2D photocatalyst electronic structure, band gap structure, charge carrier mobility and reaction pathways. We also explore the practical challenges of using 2D photocatalysts, such as their difficulty to synthesize in large quantity and also their characterization. The overarching aim of this review is to provide a snapshot of recent work targeting high-performance 2D photocatalysts for efficient solar energy conversion, thus laying a firm base for future advancements in this rapidly expanding area of photocatalysis research.									138	11	0	0	11	0	137			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000531095800016

(1995) Plant Cell Physiol. 36: 597]. It was found that the BQs accept electrons at two sites (the Q(B) and PQ sites) in the both spinach preparations as in the cyanobacterial preparation. Maximum turnover rates (V-max) and binding affinities (K-m) of the two sites were estimated. Comparison of the values in PSII membrane fragments with those in HTG-PSII showed that removal of the membrane structure or light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein complexes from the PSII core complexes had little effect on the characteristics of the Q(B) site, indicating that the HTG-PSII have the intact Q(B) site and are good materials to study the site. The K-m and V-max values were comparable to those in the cyanobacterial V-max preparation.Low affinity (high K-m values) and high V-max values of methyl-substituted BQs to the Q(B) site and almost the same rate of intrinsic electron flow through the Q(B) site in the both spinach preparations further support the hypothesis that the plastoquinone (PQ) molecule at the Q(B) site is not replaced by another PQ molecule but, after reduction, only its head group goes out of the Q(B) pocket, and comes back after transferring the electrons and protons to a free PQ molecule [Satoh et al.

Compared with TG and derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) curves under N-2 atmosphere, thermal decomposition of MSW components under steam atmosphere was divided into pyrolysis and gasification stages. In the pyrolysis stage, the shapes of TG and DTG curves under steam atmosphere were almost the same with those under N-2 atmosphere. In the gasification stage, the presence of steam led to a greater mass loss because of the steam partial oxidation of char residue. The evolution profiles of H-2, CH4, CO and CO2 were well consistent with DTG curves in terms of appearance of peaks and relevant stages in the whole temperature range, and the steam partial oxidation of char residue promoted the generation of more gas products in high temperature range. The multi-Gaussian distributed activation energy model (DAEM) was proved plausible to describe thermal decomposition behaviours of MSW components under steam atmosphere. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Beyond binary/graphene (GR) systems, there is a rising trend of demand in multicomponent/graphene (MMO/GR) photocatalysts due to the unique opportunities offered by these composites. Towards rational design of MMO/GR-based photocatalysts, the evolution of electronic structure at ZnFe2O4/graphene (ZFO/GR) interface is carefully investigated by first-principles calculations within the framework of the density functional theory (DFT). We reveal that the bloom in photocatalytic activity of ZFO/GR mainly be attributed to the unidirectional flow of photo-excited electrons from ZFO to GR but affected by synergetic effects of surface states of ZFO and high electro-conductibility of GR. The general insights in this work not only clarify the nature of enhanced photocatalytic activity of ZFO/GR photo-catalyst, but also expand and deepen the knowledge of MMO/GR composites, thus are allowed for the future rational design of MMO/GR-based energy conversion materials.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0927-0256	1879-0801		WOS:000450616700009

However, the vast majority of traditional design strategies restrictedly focus on the pristine electrocatalyst structure and ultimate performance results, which may lead to the incorrect or even opposite understanding of catalytic structure-performance correlations. With the burgeoning development of in situ techniques, the dynamic service behaviors of electrocatalysts during water splitting have been growingly investigated from enriched perspectives, only by which can the life-time dynamic structure-performance correlations be established. Herein, to shed new light on the next-stage development of in situ investigations for water splitting electrocatalysts, a series of dynamic service behavior that existed in water splitting process and highlight their key role for understanding the life-time dynamic structure-performance correlations is comprehensively summarized. Besides, a wide variety of in situ techniques are systematically dissected in terms of their functional features, advantages, and limitations. Critical challenges and prospects are also discussed for establishing the life-time dynamic structure-performance correlations of water splitting electrocatalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000747787000001

Developing efficient yet economic electrocatalysts is crucial to decrease the cost of electricity and electrolytic cell. Meanwhile, electrolysis in seawater electrolyte can further reduce feedstock cost. Here, a type of electrocatalyst is synthesized, where trace precious metals are strongly anchored on a corrosion-resistive matrix. As an example, the produced Pt/Ni-Mo electrocatalyst only needs an overpotential of 113 mV to reach an ultrahigh current density of 2000 mA cm(-2) in the saline-alkaline electrolyte, demonstrating the best performance reported thus far. It shows high activity and long durability in various electrolytes and under harsh conditions, including strong alkaline and simulated seawater electrolytes, and under elevated temperatures up to 80 degrees C. This electrocatalyst is produced on a large scale at a low cost and shows good performance in a commercial membrane electrode assembly stack, demonstrating its feasibility for practical water electrolysis.									45	3	0	0	2	0	45			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000627911100001

Electron/proton/ion gradients, particularly in the context of hydrothermal chimney structures, may also be relevant to the origins of life on Earth. Hydrothermal vents are similar in some ways to typical fuel cell devices: redox/pH gradients between seawater and hydrothermal fluid are analogous to the fuel cell oxidant and fuel reservoirs; the porous chimney wall is analogous to a separator or ion-exchange membrane and is also a conductive path for electrons; and the hydrothermal minerals are analogous to electrode catalysts. The modular and scalable characteristics of fuel cell systems make for a convenient planetary geology test bed in which geologically relevant components may be assembled and investigated in a controlled simulation environment. We have performed fuel cell experiments and electrochemical studies to better understand the catalytic potential of seafloor minerals and vent chimneys, using samples from a black smoker vent chimney as an initial demonstration. In a fuel cell with Na+-conducting Nafion((R)) membranes and liquid fuel/oxidant reservoirs (simulating the vent environment), the black smoker mineral catalyst in the membrane electrode assembly was effective in reducing O-2 and oxidizing sulfide. In a H-2/O-2 polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell with H+-conducting Nafion membranes, the black smoker catalyst was effective in reducing O-2 but not in oxidizing H-2. These fuel cell experiments accurately simulated the redox reactions that could occur in a geological setting with this particular catalyst, and also tested whether the minerals are sufficiently active to replace a commercial fuel cell catalyst. Similar experiments with other geocatalysts could be utilized to test which redox reactions could be driven in other hydrothermal systems, including hypothesized vent systems on other worlds.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1531-1074	1557-8070		WOS:000444240800006	30106308

Reduction of oxidized Cyt b559 by plastoquinols proceeds biphasically comprising a fast component with a rate constant higher than (10 s)(-1), named phase I, followed by a slower dark reaction with a rate constant of (2.7 min)(-1) at pH 6.5, termed phase II. The extents of both components of Cyt b559 reduction increased with increasing concentrations of the quinols, with that, maximally a half of oxidized Cyt b559 can be photoreduced or chemically reduced in phase I at pH 6.5. The photosystem II herbicide dinoseb but not 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) competed with the quinol reductant in phase I. The results reveal that the two components of the Cyt b559 redox reaction reflect two redox equilibria attaining in different time domains. One-electron redox equilibrium between oxidized Cyt b559 and the photosystem II-bound plastoquinol is established in phase I of Cyt b559 reduction. Phase II is attributed to equilibration of Cyt b559 redox forms with the quinone pool. The quinone site involved in phase I of Cyt b559 reduction is considered to be the site regulating the redox potential of Cyt b559 which can accommodate quinone, semiquinone and quinol forms. The properties of this site designated here as Q(D) clearly suggest that it is distinct from the site Q(C) found in the photosystem II crystal structure. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

For these patients, symptoms are medically urgent and life-threatening. The sequelae of this viral attack and immune response to it are significant, and often persist for months after discharge from intensive care. To understand the medical and psychological state of these patients, a description is given of the organs affected, the oxygen cycle in the body and the medical care procedures that are used to help patients with dysfunctional respiratory systems. The link between physical and psychological progress is described. Physical weakness results from pulmonary sequelae and deconditioning, and is often experienced by patients as mental fatigue similar to psychological depression. This may draw the patient into a downward spiral, with multiple health aspects deteriorating, independently of the resolution of initial problems. Conversely, a positive physical or psychological evolution may lead to the evolution of the other. Thus, reversing the negative trend for just one system component can delay, completely arrest the spiralling down, or transform it into an upward spiral, improving the patient's condition. In addition, for people undergoing severe COVID-19, the return to normal life could be destabilizing and memories that arise from their crisis state may trigger Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Health and psychosocial professionals hold an important role both in post-hospital care and in secondary prevention, i.e. prevention of relapse and re-hospitalization. Physical rehabilitation work must take these psychological factors into account, in the same way that any psychological follow-up is supposed to consider physiological factors.

Atomic oxygen (AO) in lower earth orbit (LEO) causes severe degradation in Kapton resulting in reduced spacecraft lifetimes. One solution is to coat the polymer surface with SiO2 since this coating is known to impart remarkable oxidation resistance. Imperfections in the SiO2 application process and micrometcoroid / debris impact in orbit damage the SiO2 coating, leading to erosion of Kapton.A self passivating, self healing silica layer protecting underlying Kapton upon exposure to AO may result from the nanodispersion of silicon and oxygen within the polymer matrix. Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) is composed of an inorganic cage structure with a 2:3 Si:O ratio surrounded by tailorable organic groups and is a possible delivery system for nanodispersed silica. A POSS dianiline was copolymerized with pyromellitic: dianhydride and 4,4'-oxydianiline resulting in POSS Kapton Polyimide. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of 5 to 25 weight % POSS Polyimide was determined to be slightly lower, 5 - 10 %, than that of unmodified polyimides (414 degrees C). Furthermore the room temperature modulus of polyimide is unaffected by POSS, and the modulus at temperatures greater than the Tg of the polyimide is doubled by the incorporation of 20 wt % POSS.To simulate LEO conditions, POSS PI films underwent exposure to a hyperthermal O-atom beam. Surface analysis of exposed and unexposed films conducted with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and surface profilometry support the fori-nation of a SiO2 self healing passivation layer upon AO exposure. This is exemplified by erosion rates of 10 and 20 weight % POSS PI samples which were 3.7 and 0.98 percent, respectively, of the erosion rate for Kapton H at a fluence of 8.5 x 10(20) O atoms cm(-2). This data corresponds to an erosion yield for 10 wt % POSS PI of 4.8 % of Kapton H. In a separate exposure, at a fluence of 7.33 X 10(20) O atoms cm(-2), 25 wt % POSS Polyimide showed the erosion yield of about 1.1 % of that of Kapton H. Also, recently at a lower fluence of 2.03 x 1020 atoms cm(-2), in going from 20 to 25 wt % POSS PI the erosion was decreased by a factor of 2 with an erosion yield too minor to be measured for 25 wt % POSS PI.

The major limiting factors affecting the efficiency of solar fuel synthesis include; (i) light absorption, (ii) charge separation and transport and (iii) surface chemical reaction; therefore substantial efforts have been put into solving these problems. In particular, the loading of co-catalysts or secondary semiconductors that can act as either electron or hole acceptors for improved charge separation is a promising strategy, leading to the adaptation of a junction architecture. Research related to semiconductor junction photocatalysts has developed very rapidly and there are a few comprehensive reviews in which the strategy is discussed (A. Kudo and Y. Miseki, Chemical Society Reviews, 2009, 38, 253-278, K. Li, D. Martin, and J. Tang, Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2011, 32, 879-890, R. Marschall, Advanced Functional Materials, 2014, 24, 2421-2440). This critical review seeks to give an overview of the concept of heterojunction construction and more importantly, the current state-of-the art for the efficient, visible-light driven junction water splitting photo(electro) catalysts reported over the past ten years. For water splitting, these include BiVO4, Fe2O3, Cu2O and C3N4, which have attracted increasing attention. Experimental observations of the proposed charge transfer mechanism across the semiconductor/semiconductor/metal junctions and the resultant activity enhancement are discussed. In parallel, recent successes in the theoretical modelling of semiconductor electronic structures at interfaces and how these explain the functionality of the junction structures is highlighted.									1637	80	1	0	103	3	1658			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000352274600003

However, a bare Si photoelectrode is prone to photocorrosion and its photovoltage is affected by surface states on the electrode in PEC measurements. In the present work, a simple and inexpensive method for the construction of a Si/graphene heterojunction is presented. The high barrier at the solid/solid junction results in an open-circuit voltage of 490mV, making it an excellent heterojunction light absorber to generate a substantial photovoltage for PEC water oxidation. A TiO2 thin layer deposited on the Si/graphene structure is effective to protect the heterojunction from the electrolyte while favoring the interfacial charge transport from the buried junction. The introduction of a FeNiCoOx co-catalyst thin film onto the TiO2 protected heterojunction yields a high photocurrent density of approximate to 19 mA cm(-2) at an applied potential of 1.5 V vs. RHE in 1.0 M NaOH solution under one sun simulated solar illumination. In contrast to the unprotected Si/graphene electrode, the activity of the TiO2 protected photoanode is sustained for several hours in an alkaline electrolyte. This work clearly reveals the important role of graphene in the performance improvement of the Si-based photoanodes and sheds light on the introduction of novel materials onto silicon-based electrodes to achieve higher photovoltages for efficient PEC reactions.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			2398-4902			WOS:000426712600017

Indeed, this process can lead to transitory acidic conditions in the medium (i.e., production of sulphuric acid, carbonic acid) which may influence the corrosion kinetics of the carbon steel components of some disposal cells. In order to improve the geochemical modelling of the long-term disposal, the oxidation of pyrite in contact with clays and carbonates at 100 degrees C must be evaluated. In this study, special attention was paid to the pyrite oxidation rate thanks to an original experimental set-up, involving several pyrite/mineral mixtures and a reactor coupled to a micro gas chromatograph (P-O2 and P-CO2 monitoring). Although thermodynamic modelling expects that hematite is the most stable phase in a pure pyrite heated system (low pH), experiments show the formation of native sulfur as an intermediate product of the reaction. In the presence of calcite, the pH is neutralized and drives the lower reactivity of pyrite in the absence of native sulfur. The addition of clay phases or other detrital silicates from the claystone had no impact on pyrite oxidation rate. The discrepancies between experiments and thermodynamic modelling are explained by kinetic effects. Two laws were deduced at 100 degrees C. The first concerns a pure pyrite system, with the following law: rPy= 10-4.8 center dot PO20.5 center dot t-0.5. The second concerns a pyrite/carbonates system: rPy+Ca= 10-5.1 center dot PO20.5 center dot t-0.5 where P-O2 corresponds to the partial pressure of O-2 (in bar) and t is time in seconds. Different mechanisms are proposed to explain the evolution with time of the O-2 consumption during pyrite oxidation: (i) decrease of the specific or reactive surface area after oxidation of fine grains of pyrite, (ii) decrease of O-2 pressure, (iii) growing up of secondary minerals (Fe-oxides or anhydrite in the presence of calcium in the system) on the surface of pyrite limiting the access of O-2 to the fresh surface of pyrite, and (iv) change in the pH of the solution.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7				2075-163X		WOS:000478593300021

abies			欧洲云杉PSⅡ的热稳定性对温度升高的响应				林业科学	Scientia Silvae Sinicae				56	7			22	32	1001-7488(2020)56:7<22:OZYSPD>2.0.TX;2-I					2020	2020	[Objective]In this study,5-year-old European spruce(Picea abies)seedlings were used to evaluate the thermal stability and self-repairing ability of PSⅡ in the future climate warming.[Method] Three clones,10 ramets of each clone,30 ramets in total,were selected and cultured in an artificial climate chamber under normal conditions.Two weeks later,hand-PEA and image-PAM were used to detect the fluorescence parameters and image of leaves as control.After preheating for 5 hours in a low light incubator at 38℃,seedlings were heated for 30 minutes at 40,42,43,44,46,48,50,52,53 and 54℃,respectively.Three clones(one ramet per clone)were treated in each experimental group.Hand-PEA and image-PAM were used to detect the fluorescence parameters of leaves and two critical temperatures of tress were selected.Seedlings treated under two critical temperatures were cultured in an artificial climate chamber for two weeks.Hand-PEA and image-PAM were used to detect the fluorescence parameters and images of leaves,and to study the self-repairing ability of spruce PSⅡ after heat shock.[Result]1)Through the study of Y(Ⅱ),Y(NO)and Y(NPQ)fluorescence images and kinetic curves,it was found that under 44 ℃ heat stress,PSⅡ of P.abies reached the initial stress temperature,and under 52 ℃ heat stress,it reached the maximum stress temperature.Compared with herbs,other woody species and related species,the thermal stability of PSⅡ was at a higher level for P.abies.2)The fluorescence parameters of F_0,F_m,Fv/FM,NPQ,q_L and q_P of PSⅡ and the fluorescence kinetic parameters of NPQ,q_L and q_P were detected by image-PAM at critical temperature:the fluorescence kinetic parameters of F_m and F_v/F_m were weakened,the fluorescence images of q_L and q_P were enhanced,and the fluorescence kinetic parameters of NPQ,q_L and q_P were higher than those of the control at 44 ℃.The fluorescence kinetic curves of F_v/F_m,q_L and q_P were lower than those of the control.3)The hand-PEA was used to further detect the change of fluorescence parameters of PSⅡ.Under 44 ℃ shorttime heat shock,F_v/F_m and OJIP curves did not change significantly,PIABS decreased only to 79.5% of the control group.The ability of chlorophyll(Chl)to absorb and capture light energy,the transmission of electrons,and the activity of center protein in electron transfer chain were not significantly inhibited.The heat chock also promoted the ability of Chl to absorb energy(ABC)photochemical reaction and fluorescence quenching.However,under the short-term heat shock of 52 ℃,the function of PSⅡ was obviously inhibited,and the OJIP curve also showed a large " K" band,F_v/F_m was reduced to 63.2% of the control group.PIABS was only 6.6% of the control group.The absorption and capture of light energy,photochemical reaction,fluorescence quenching and electron transfer ability of chlorophyll(Chl)were severely inhibited at the moment of F_m,and the oxygen evolution complex(OEC)of electron transfer chain was also severely damaged.Therefore,it was predicted that increasing temperature mainly inhibited the activity of reaction center and electron transfer on receptor side of PSⅡ in leaves,changed the energy flow and distribution in PSⅡ reaction center.But it had little effect on the donor side of PSⅡ.4)After two weeks of recovery in normal growth condition,the fluorescence parameters and images of the needles of the seedlings that were previously subjected to heat shock under the two stress temperatures were restored to the level of the control,indicating that P.abies had a strong recovery ability to the short-term stress.[Conclusion]Therefore,we predict that PSⅡ of P.abies has a strong elastic adaptation physiological mechanism to cope with the short-term high temperature in extreme weather at noon under the future climate change,and its temperature range of heat shock stress can be withstood that is 44-52 ℃.			【目的】以欧洲云杉5年生幼苗为对象,研究其PSⅡ热激后自我修复能力,评估它的PSⅡ在未来气候变暖情况下的热稳定性和热损伤的自我修复能力。【方法】选择3个无性系、每个无性系10个分生株,共计30个分生株,放入人工气候室正常条件下培养,2周后应用hand-PEA和image-PAM检测叶片的荧光参数和影像作为对照。放入38℃ 培养箱中在低光的条件下预热5h后,在40、42、43、44、46、48、50、52、53和54℃ 下分别热激30mins,每个处理3个无性系(每个无性系1个分生株),应用hand-PEA和image-PAM检测叶片PSⅡ的荧光参数和影像,筛选2个胁迫临界温度。将热激后选择的2个临界温度处理的幼苗,再次放入人工气候室正常条件下培养2周,用hand-PEA和image-PAM继续检测叶片PSⅡ的荧光参数和影像。【结果】1)通过对参数Y(Ⅱ)、Y(NO)和Y(NPQ)荧光影像和动力学曲线研究发现,欧洲云杉在44℃热激胁迫下,达到初始胁迫温度,52℃热激胁迫下达到最大胁迫温度,与草本、木本以及近缘物种植物相比,欧洲云杉PSⅡ的热稳定性都处于较高水平。2)应用image-PAM检测临界温度下PSⅡ荧光参数F_0、F_m、F_v/F_m、NPQ、q_L和q_P的影像和NPQ、q_L和q_P荧光动力学参数曲线:44℃短时热激下F_m和F_v/F_m影像减弱,q_L和q_P荧光影像增强,NPQ、q_L和q_P荧光动力学参数曲线高于对照;52℃短时热激下F_m和NPQ被增强,F_v/F_m、q_L和q_P影像被减弱,NPQ、q_L和q_P的荧光动力学参数曲线低于对照。3)应用hand-PEA进一步检测PSⅡ荧光参数量值的变化,44℃短时热激下,F_v/F_m、OJIP曲线都没有明显变化,仅PIABS降至对照组的79.5%,叶绿素(Chl)吸收和捕获光能的能力、电子的传递、以及电子传递链中心蛋白的活性都没受到明显的抑制,并促进天线色素(Chl)吸收能量(ABC)的光化学反应的能力和荧光淬灭的能力;而52℃短时热激下,PSⅡ的功能已发生明显的抑制,OJIP曲线也出现大幅度的K带,F_v/F_m降为对照组的63.2%,PIABS仅为对照组的6.6%,F_m时刻叶绿素(Chl)对光能的吸收和捕获、光化学反应、荧光淬灭和电子传递的能力受到了严重的抑制,电子传递链的放氧复合体(OEC)也遭到严重破坏;因此,预测增温主要抑制了叶片PSⅡ反应中心的活性和受体侧电子传递,改变了PSⅡ反应中心能量流动分配,而对欧洲云杉PSⅡ供体侧的影响较小。4)经过2周的恢复后,在2种胁迫温度下幼苗针叶的荧光参数和影像都恢复到对照的水平,说明欧洲云杉对短期的胁迫有较强的恢复能力。【结论】在未来气候变化的情况下,欧洲云杉PSⅡ可能有较强的弹性适应生理机制应对极端天气午间的短期高温,它的热激胁迫可承受的温度范围在44~52℃。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-7488			CSCD:6801006

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of the resulting composite photoanodes were studied for solar-driven water splitting under back side illumination in 0.5 M Na2SO3 electrolyte. Compared with pristine TiO2 and TiO2/ZnSe nanowire arrays, the photoconversion efficiency in TiO2/ZnSe/Co-Pi composite photoanode was increased by 1.5 and 3.8 times at a bias voltage of 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. More attractive, this triple TiO2/ZnSe/Co-Pi photoanodes show significantly improved PEC stability compared with the TiO2/ZnSe electrode, remaining 56% initial photocurrent after 4000 seconds persistent light irradiation. By using the electrochemical measurements, the reason for the improved performance of TiO2/ZnSe/Co-Pi is discussed in detail. It is proposed that the TiO2 provided direct channel for electron transport, ZnSe photosensitizer extended the spectral response to the visible region, and the Co-Pi acts as hole transfer relay to accelerate the surface water oxidation reaction. The strategy for designing photoanode in this work is low-cost but effective, and could be extended to prepare other hybrid photoanode with elaborate textural characteristics.

They were both tested for ammonia adsorption in dynamic conditions, at ambient temperature, and characterized before and after exposure to ammonia by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, potentiometric titration, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and elemental analysis. Analyses of the initial materials showed that besides epoxy, hydroxyl and carboxylic groups, a significant amount of sulfur is incorporated as sulfonic group for GO prepared by the Hummers-Offeman method. The process of ammonia adsorption seems to be strongly related to the type of GO. For GO prepared by the Brodie method, ammonia is mainly retained via intercalation in the interlayer space of GO and by reaction with the carboxylic groups present at the edges of the graphene layers. On the contrary, when GO prepared by the Hummers method is used, the ways of retention are different: not only is the intercalation of ammonia observed but its reaction with the epoxy, carboxylic and sulfonic groups present is also observed. In particular, during the ammonia adsorption process, sulfonic groups are converted to sulfates in the presence of superoxide anions O-2(-*). These sulfates can then react with ammonia to form ammonium sulfates. For both GOs, an incorporation of a significant part of the ammonia adsorbed as amines in their structure is observed as a result of reactive adsorption.									208	2	0	0	27	0	210			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:000272271500011		
J	HARBINSON, J; HEDLEY, CL								CHANGES IN P-700 OXIDATION DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF THE INDUCTION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS								PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				103	2			649	660		10.1104/pp.103.2.649				OCT 1993	1993	Following dark adaptation, the response to irradiance of chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence, the light-induced absorbance change around 820 nm (to measure reaction center Chl of photosystem I [PSI] P-700 oxidation), and CO2 fixation were examined in pea (Pisum sativum L.) leaves under a range of conditions. Initially, P-700 oxidation is restricted by a lack of regeneration of PSI electron acceptors, and the increase of oxidized P-700 (P-700+) that occurs during approximately the first 60 s of irradiation is largely independent of the resistance to electron flow between the two photosystems. Under these conditions, the quantum efficiency for linear electron flow is directly positively related to P-700+ accumulation, which is in contrast to the direct negative correlation that is the most frequently reported relationship between P-700+ accumulation and the quantum efficiency for linear electron flow.									68	1	0	0	67	0	70			0032-0889			WOS:A1993MB64200043	12231970

The effect of both current density amplitude and pulse on/off time on the quality, composition and surface morphology of the galvanic alloys were determined. It was established the coating Co-Mo-Zr enrichment by molybdenum with current density increasing up to 8 A dm(-2) as well as the rising of pulse time and pause duration promotes the content of molybdenum because of subsequent chemical reduction of its intermediate oxides by hydrogen ad-atoms. It was found that the content of the alloying metals in the coating Co-Mo-Zr depends on the current density and on/off times extremely and maximum Mo and Zr content corresponds to the current density interval 4-6 A dm(-2), on-/off-time 2-10 ms. Chemical resistance of binary and ternary coatings based on cobalt is caused by the increased tendency to passivity and high resistance to pitting corrosion in the presence of molybdenum and zirconium, as well as the acid nature of their oxides. Binary coating with molybdenum content not less than 20 at.% and ternary ones with zirconium content in terms of corrosion deep index are in a group "very proof". It was shown that Co-Mo-Zr alloys exhibits the greatest level of catalytic properties as cathode material for hydrogen electrolytic production from acidic media which is not inferior a platinum electrode. The deposits Co-Mo-Zr with zirconium content 2-4 at.% demonstrate high catalytic properties in the carbon(II) oxide conversion. This confirms the efficiency of materials as catalysts for the gaseous wastes purification and gives the reason to recommend them as catalysts for red-ox processes activating by oxygen as well as electrode materials for red-ox batteries.

Absorption/emission characteristics identify band gap narrowing, which facilitates visible light absorption, as a consequence of hybridization of O 2p bands with Cu(3)d bands of the ZnO-CuxO heterostructure system. With use of the specific band energy position of the individual components (i.e., ZnO, Cu2O, and CuO), photogenerated electrons and holes could be made to migrate separately and thereby the carrier recombination could be delayed, making them amply available for photocatalytic reactions. The available electrons plausibly produce superoxide radical anion (O-2(center dot-)), while holes generate hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), which are reactive agents for dye degradation. Furthermore, the formation of a depletion region via Cu-induced charge separation within the ZnO-CuxO heterostructure and thermal-energy-mediated abstraction of the electric field barriers and subsequent migration of the positively charged defects from the subsurface region toward the interface lead to efficient photocatalytic performance.									23	1	0	0	2	0	23			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000534408600006

Here, we report a facile method to fabricate amorphous iron oxide nanosheet arrays on carbon fiber cloth (CFC) as a three-dimensional (3D) self-supported electrode for efficient water oxidation. FeSOy nanosheets with a lateral size of 400 nm and a thickness of 20 nm were first grown on a CFC substrate by a hydrothermal method, and were then converted to FeOx nanosheets without an obvious change in the morphology and size through a rapid and in situ electrochemical oxidation desulfurization process. After the electrochemical activation process, the 3D self-supported electrodes exhibited superior OER activity to previously reported iron oxide films, and were even comparable to some state-of-the-art OER catalysts such as cobalt oxides. Furthermore, the 3D self-supported electrodes showed excellent stability toward the OER process even at a high current density. Surprisingly, the activity of the 3D self-supported electrode was enhanced significantly after the long-term OER process. In addition, the direct growth of the active catalysts on the CFC substrate can avoid the use of other conductive agents and binders, which ensures good electrical connection and improves the electrical conductivity of the electrode. The superior activity and long-term stability as well as the facile fabrication process demonstrated that the 3D self-supported electrode has promising application in large-scale water splitting.									59	3	0	0	4	0	59			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000374790700036

However, there is a lack of cost-effective synthesis approaches to meet the goal of economic mass production of single-atom M-N/C with desirable carbon support architecture for efficient CO2 reduction. Herein, we report facile transformation of commercial carbon nanotube (CNT) into isolated Fe-N-4 sites anchored on carbon nanotube and graphene nanoribbon (GNR) networks (Fe-N/CNT@GNR). The oxidization-induced partial unzipping of CNT results in the generation of GNR nanolayers attached to the remaining fibrous CNT frameworks, which reticulates a hierarchically mesoporous complex and thus enables a high electrochemical active surface area and smooth mass transport. The Fe residues originating from CNT growth seeds serve as Fe sources to form isolated Fe-N-4 moieties located at the CNT and GNR basal plane and edges with high intrinsic capability of activating CO2 and suppressing hydrogen evolution. The Fe-N/CNT@GNR delivers a stable CO Faradaic efficiency of 96% with a partial current density of 22.6 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 650 mV, making it one of the most active M-N/C catalysts reported. This work presents an effective strategy to fabricate advanced atomistic catalysts and highlights the key roles of support architecture in single-atom electrocatalysis.									67	9	0	0	1	0	68			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000537682300036	32330000

Photochemical charge separation is key to the operation of these devices, but details are difficult to observe experimentally because of the number of components and interfaces. Here, we use surface photovoltage spectroscopy to study charge transfer in i-, n-, and p-GaN nanowire arrays on n(+)-Si wafers in the presence and absence of Rh/Cr2O3 co-catalysts. The effect of the space charge layer and sub-bandgap defects on majority and minority carrier transport can be clearly observed, and estimates of the built-in potential of the junctions can be made. Transient illumination of the p-GaN/n(+)-Si junction generates up to -1.4 V surface photovoltage by carrier separation along the GaN nanowire axis. This process is central to the overall water-splitting function of the n(+)-Si/p-GaN/Rh/Cr2O3 nanowire array. These results improve our understanding of photochemical charge transfer and separation in group III-V semiconductor nanostructures for the conversion of solar energy into fuels.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000582113000007	33086834	
J	Chu, Haiyan; Morimoto, Sho; Fujii, Takeshi; Yagi, Kazuyuki; Nishimura, Seiichi								Soil Ammonia-Oxidizing Bacterial Communities in Paddy Rice Fields as Affected by Upland Conversion History								SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL				73	6			2026	2031		10.2136/sssaj2009.0018				NOV-DEC 2009	2009	Rotation of paddy rice and upland crop cultivation is a major type of land use in eastern Asia. Temporary upland conversion of paddy field also occurs frequently in this region. Little is known about the affects of these agricultural practices on soil microbial communities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of former upland conversion (upland rice [Oryza sativa L.] cultivation or soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merill]-wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] cultivation) on sod ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in a paddy rice field. The AOB population size and community structures were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), respectively. Soil AOB communities were more diverse and had larger population size in the plots with upland conversion history than in consecutive paddy rice plots. Former soybean-wheat cultivation had a much larger effect on sod AOB communities than former upland rice cultivation. Phylogenetic analysis showed that DGGE bands derived from former upland conversion belonged to Nitrosospira amoA cluster 1. Nitrosospira amoA Cluster 1 became dominant over Nitrosospira amoA Cluster 3 in the plots wit former soybean-wheat cultivation. Our results demonstrate that upland conversion history exhibit a significant effect on sod AOB communities in paddy rice field, and the effect depends strongly on the type of upland crop.									30	3	0	0	24	0	31			0361-5995	1435-0661		WOS:000271752700033

The X-ray diffraction indicated predominating anatase TiO2 signal on bl-TNT, while substantial lattice distortion was noticed for bk-TNT. Although the X-ray photoelectron spectra indicated negligible Ti3+ on surface of both TNTs, linear sweep (cyclic) voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectrometry confirmed the bk-TNT to show greater double layer capacitance and overall photocurrent, coupled with lower charge transfer resistance. Nevertheless, the PEC disinfection of E. coli was significantly invigorated on bl-TNT, while the bactericidal rates in tap water were comparable or even far greater than those in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solutions, depending on [E. coli](0) (10(5) or 10(7) CFU/mL). Under a presumed diffusion-controlled kinetic regime in this study, observed effects of capacitance and electrolyte could be interpreted in terms of electrostatic interaction between the electrical double layer of photoanodes and charged bio-solids, such as repulsion by co-ions (SO42-) and adsorption/surface blocking. Analogous PEC experiments on model organic compounds degradation (4-chlorophenol and methylene blue) corroborated a long-term stability of the bl-TNT (up to 30 consecutive cycles) and the role of surface hydroxyl radical as the primary oxidant.									26	0	0	0	7	0	26			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000480669500036

This work presents the first determination of enrichment factors of N2O clumped isotopes during bacterial denitrification. Samples of N2O obtained after 1-, 3-, and 7-day incubations of a pure culture of the denitrifier Pseudomonas aureofaciens at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C were analysed by the recently developed quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy (QCLAS) method. Enrichment factors epsilon(p/s) of the cumulative product (p) relative to the substrate (s) were determined using a Rayleigh model for the seven most abundant isotopically substituted molecules (isotopocules) of N2O. Values of the enrichment factors epsilon(p/s) (with uncertainty expressed as expanded standard uncertainty at the 95% confidence interval) at the two incubation temperatures (20 degrees C/30 degrees C) are: (NNO)-N-14-N-15-O-16 (456): epsilon(456 )= (-40.3 +/- 2.6)parts per thousand/(-35.1 +/- 0.7)parts per thousand (NNO)-N-15-N-14-O-16 (546): epsilon(546 )= (-38.1 +/- 3.4)parts per thousand/(-31.2 +/- 0.6)parts per thousand (NNO)-N-14-N-14-O-17 (447): epsilon(447 )= (21.3 +/- 1.2)parts per thousand/(24.5 +/- 0.5)parts per thousand (NNO)-N-14-N-14-O-18 (448): epsilon(448 )= (38.8 +/- 1.5)parts per thousand/(46.4 +/- 1.2)parts per thousand (NNO)-N-14-N-15-O-18 (458): epsilon(458 )= (-8.9 +/- 2.0)parts per thousand/(-11.7 +/- 0.6)parts per thousand (NNO)-N-15-N-14-O-18 (548): epsilon(548 )= (-3.4 +/- 1.1)parts per thousand/(-1.8 +/- 0.5)parts per thousand (NNO)-N-15-N-15-O-16 (556): epsilon(556 )= (-85.9 +/- 1.5)parts per thousand/(-63.9 +/- 1.4)parts per thousand Temporal evolutions of the abundances of singly substituted N2O isotopocules during nitrate reduction agree with previously published experiments: there is normal isotope effect associated with the production of (NNO)-N-14-N-15-O-16 and (NNO)-N-15-N-14-O-16; i.e., intermediates leading to (NNO)-N-14-N-14-O-16 react faster than intermediates leading to (NNO)-N-14-N-15-O-16 and (NNO)-N-15-N-14-O-16. However, the production of (NNO)-N-14-N-14-O-17 and (NNO)-N-14-N-14-O-18 is associated with inverse isotope effect; i.e., intermediates leading to (NNO)-N-14-N-14-O-16 react slower than intermediates leading to (NNO)-N-14-N-14-O-17 and (NNO)-N-14-N-14-O-18 due to preferential cleavage of O-16 during nitrate reduction to N2O. Isotopic fractionation at the incubation temperature of 30 degrees C was significantly lower compared to 20 degrees C. We observed a large kinetic isotope effect of the N-15 site preference (SP) and the N-15-O-18 site preference (SP18) at the onset of the reaction. SP18 was found to be closer to 0 parts per thousand than SP, which is thought to arise from similar rates of breakage of the N-15-O and N-14-O bonds in the reaction intermediates.The N-15-O-18 clumped isotope anomalies in two isotopic isomers (isotopomers) (NNO)-N-14-N-15-O-18 and (NNO)-N-15-N-14-O-18 (delta(458+548)(avg)) follow a temporal trend similar to those of SP and SP18. The N-15-N-15 clumped isotope anomalies in (NNO)-N-15-N-15-O-16 are greater than 0 parts per thousand and show no clear temporal trend or influence of incubation temperature, suggesting no strong combinatorial effects involved during the N-N bond formation. Overall, our data illustrate that clumped N2O isotopes may be used as independent tracers for reaction mechanisms of N2O conversion and may establish themselves as a worthwhile tool to study the biogeochemical cycle of N2O.

In this study, we developed an in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) method, which provided unprecedented information on the oxidation of carbonate solvents via dehydrogenation on LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2 (NMC). While ethylene carbonate (EC) was stable against oxidation on Pt up to 4.8 V-Li, unique evidence for dehydrogenation of EC on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NMC811) at voltages as low as 3.8 V-Li was revealed by in situ FT-IR measurements, which was supported by density functional theory (DFT) results. Unique dehydrogenated species from EC were observed on NMC811 surface, including dehydrogenated EC anchored on oxides, vinylene carbonate (VC) and dehydrogenated oligomers which could diffuse away from the surface. Similar dehydrogenation on NMC811 was noted for EMC-based and LP57 (1 M LiPF6 in 3 : 7 EC/EMC) electrolytes. In contrast, no dehydrogenation was found for NMC111 or surface-modified NMC by coatings such as Al2O3. In addition, while the dehydrogenation of solvents was observed in 1 M electrolytes with different anions, they were not observed on NMC811 in the concentrated electrolyte (EC/EMC with 3.1 M LiPF6), indicating lithium coordination could suppress dehydrogenation. Dehydrogenation of carbonates on NMC811 accompanied with rapid growth of interfacial impedance with increasing voltage revealed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), while the electrode-electrolyte combinations without dehydrogenation did not show significant impedance growth. Therefore, minimizing carbonate dehydrogenation on the NMC surface by tuning electrode reactivity and electrolyte reactivity is critical to develop high-energy Li-ion batteries with long cycle life.									92	5	0	0	4	0	93			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000508857600011

Mossbauer spectroscopy provides definitive evidence that 1 alpha and 1 beta generate oxoiron(IV) species as the resting state. Decomposition paths of the catalysts have been investigated by identifying and quantifying ligand fragments that form upon degradation. This analysis correlates the water oxidation activity of 1 alpha and 1 beta with stability against oxidative damage of the ligand via aliphatic C-H oxidation. The site of degradation and the relative stability against oxidative degradation are shown to be dependent on the topology of the catalyst. Furthermore, the mechanisms of catalyst degradation have been rationalized by computational analyses, which also explain why the topology of the catalyst enforces different oxidation-sensitive sites. This information has served in creating catalysts where sensitive C-H bonds have been replaced by C-D bonds. The deuterated analogues D-4-alpha-[Fe(OTf)O-2(mcp)] (D-4-1 alpha), D-4-beta-[Fe(OTf)(2)(mcp)] (D-4-1 beta), and D-6-beta-[Fe(OTf)(2)(mcp)] (D-6-1 beta) were prepared, and their catalytic activity has been studied. D-4-1 alpha proves to be an extraordinarily active and efficient catalyst (up to 91% of O-2 yield); it exhibits initial reaction rates identical with those of its protio analogue, but it is substantially more robust toward oxidative degradation and yields more than 3400 TON (n(O-2)/n(Fe)). Altogether this evidences that the water oxidation catalytic activity is performed by a well-defined coordination complex and not by iron oxides formed after oxidative degradation of the ligands.									42	0	0	0	3	0	42			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000455561800050	30497265

They find applications in everything from fine chemical manufacturing to greenhouse gas mitigation. They are indispensable for developing a sustainable future. Their development has been continuous, from early trial and error efforts to the first fundamental insights gained through surface science, to modern in-situ characterization and computational predictions. The accumulation of knowledge on the working principles of catalytic surfaces allowed designing and producing better systems with improved performance. Even though tremendous progress has been made thanks to surface science techniques, these studies are usually performed under ultra-high vacuum and are therefore limited in their applicability to more relevant industrial conditions. The control over size, shape and composition in colloidal nanocrystals makes them formidable precursors for model heterogeneous catalysts. These model systems enable linking the insights from surface science studies via in-situ and operando studies to realistic catalytic reaction conditions. In this review, colloidal nanocrystals are presented as powerful building blocks for catalytic materials in the quest for fundamental understanding. A review of the principal methods to produce colloidal nanocrystals with a high level of control is reported, complemented by procedures for how to prepare active catalysts from these particles. Examples and guidelines for the catalytic applications of these materials revolve around the three guiding objectives in catalysis science: activity, selectivity and stability. This work will be limited to examples of this colloidal approach in the areas of thermal, electro- and photocatalysis. The exposed approaches can be used and extended to many other areas of catalysis science, thus providing a new avenue to explore fundamentals and applications of catalytic materials.

Kinetics showed a first-order reaction rate with maximum PXF removal of 94.91% at mildly acidic pH; additionally, the ferromagnetic properties of catalyst allowed recovery and reuse multiple times, reducing costs and time in degradation processes. The degradation products were identified by HPLC-MS and allowed us to propose a thermodynamically feasible mechanism that was validated through DFT calculations. Additionally, toxicity studies have been performed in bacteria and yeast where high loadings of Cs showed to be harmful to Staphylococcus aureus (MIC> 4.0 mg/mL); Salmonella typhi (MIC> 8.0 mg/mL) and Candida albicans (MIC> 10.0 mg/ mL). The presented setup shows effectiveness and robustness in a degradation process using alternative energy sources for the elimination of non-biodegradable pollutants.									16	0	0	0	12	0	16			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000664767600004	33819643

This method is essentially based on electrochemical post-treatment of Pd-based infinite coordination polymer (ICP). The Pd-based ICP is synthesized through the coordination reaction between Zn2+ and metallo-Schiff base (MSB) to form Zn-MSB-Zn (ZMZ) ICP that precipitates from ethyl ether. The as-formed Zn-MSB-Zn ICP is then subjected to an ion-exchange reaction with Pd2+ to obtain the Zn-MSB-Pd (ZMP) ICP. To prepare Pd/SWNT nanocomposite, the ZMP ICP is mixed into the SWNT dispersion in N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to form a homogeneous dispersion that is then drop-coated onto a glassy carbon (GC) electrode. Electrochemical post-treatment of ZMP ICP to form Pd/SWNT nanocomposite is thus performed by polarizing the coated electrode at -0.2 V for 600 s in 0.5 M H2SO4. The results obtained with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveal that the resulting Pd nanoparticles are highly dispersed onto SWNTs and the particles size are small and narrowly distributed (2.12 +/- 0.32 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis shows that, after, the electrochemical post-treatment, no detectable ZMP ICP precursors are left on the surface of SWNTs. The electrocatalytic activity of the as-formed Pd/SWNT nanocomposite toward ethanol oxidation is investigated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The results show that the Pd/SWNT nanocomposite prepared here shows a more negative potential and higher mass catalytic activity, as well as higher stability for the oxidation of ethanol than the commercial Pd/C catalyst. This work demonstrates a novel approach to the formation of ultrasmall and highly dispersed Pd/SWNT nanocomposite with enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward ethanol oxidation.									33	0	0	0	6	0	34			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000327103500140	24159926

We begin with a brief review of the maturation mechanism that leads to green fluorescence in GFPs. The main body of this article is focused on a series of main chain redox and beta-elimination reactions mediated by light and O-2, ultimately yielding a red-emitting chromophore. In all GFP-like proteins, a tyrosine-derived phenolic group constitutes an essential building block of the chromophore's skeleton. Two major classes of red-emitting species have been identified in naturally occurring fluorescent proteins. In the DsRed type, an acylimine moiety is found to be conjugated to the GFP-like chromophore. Recent evidence has suggested that two mechanistic pathways, a green branch and a red branch, diverge from an early cyclic intermediate that bears a standard tyrosine side chain. Therefore, the long-standing notion that all FP colors originate from modifications of the GFP-like chromophore may need to be revised. In the Kaede-type green-to-red photoconvertible class of FPs, a light-mediated main chain elimination reaction partakes in the formation of a three-ring chromophore that involves the incorporation of a histidine residue into the conjugated system. A mechanistic role for photoexcitation of the GFP-like chromophore is undisputed; however, the nature of associated proton transfer steps and the charge state of the critical imidazole group remain controversial. In addition to the two major classes of red fluorescent proteins, we briefly describe yellow fluorescence arising from modifications of DsRed-type intermediates, and the less well understood photoactivated oxidative redding phenomenon.									44	3	0	0	29	0	47			0006-2960			WOS:000281305200003	20666493

The need of green and clean energy is increasing to overcome the growing demand of sustainable energy throughout globe, owing to CO2 emission using fossil fuels. To generate highly efficient and cost-competitive hydrogen, the semiconductor based heterojunction nanomaterials have gained tremendous consideration as a promising way. Currently, the efficiency for hydrogen generation through UV-Vis active photocatalysts is relatively low. The key issues are found to be poor separation of photogenerated electron/hole, less surface area, and low absorption region of electromagnetic spectrum. Such issues arise due to inappropriate band edge potentials and large bandgap of present catalyst. A lot of schemes has been devoted to design and fabricate efficient photocatalysts for improved photo catalytic performance in recent years. However, it seems still a challenge and imperative to greatly comprehend the fundamental aspects, photocatalysis and transfer mechanisms for complete deployment of electron/hole pairs. Further, to produce hydrogen to a larger extent through photocatalytic water splitting, the photocatalyst has been modified through co-catalysts/dopants using numerous techniques including the Z-scheme, hybridization, crystallinity, morphology, tuning of band edge positions, reduction of the band gap, surface structure etc., such that these heterogeneous photocatalysts may have ability to absorb enough light in the UV-VIS-IR region. This type of heterogeneous photocatalysts has the ability to improve the rate of efficiency for hydrogen evolution through absorption of sufficient light of solar spectrum and enhance the separation of charge-carriers by inhibiting recombination of electron/hole pairs. We surmise that taking into account the aforesaid factors should support in scheming an efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen production through water splitting, eventually prompting technological developments in this field.

J	Jiang, Hao; Korpelainen, Helena; Li, Chunyang				Li, Chunyang/D-6254-2013	Korpelainen, Helena/0000-0002-7046-6995			Populus yunnanensis males adopt more efficient protective strategies than females to cope with excess zinc and acid rain								CHEMOSPHERE				91	8			1213	1220		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.01.041				MAY 2013	2013	Dioecious plants show sexually different responses to environmental stresses. However, little is known about the dimorphic morphological and physiological responses to soil pollution. To investigate sex-related adaptive responses of Populus yunnanensis seedlings when exposed to excess zinc (Zn), acid rain (AR) and their combination (Zn+AR), we analyzed growth parameters, Zn accumulation and allocation, photosynthetic capacity and biochemical responses under different treatments. Results revealed that both excess Zn and Zn+AR have a negative effect on plant growth. Males have a greater potential than females to enrich Zn. The photosynthesis limitation could be attributable to a lower stomatal conductance, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency and nitrate reductase activity induced by Zn accumulation. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species was detected, and females showed higher levels of H2O2 and O-2(center dot-) than did males under excess Zn and Zn+AR. In addition, indicators related to plant injury showed expected increases and exhibited sexual differences. Males synthesized more biochemical molecules, such as proline and non-protein thiol, showing a stronger defense capacity in responses to either excess Zn or Zn+AR. Taking into account the Zn accumulation and the resulting injuries in plants, we suggest that excess Zn causes sex-related adaptive responses and males possess a more effective self-protection mechanism, Zn-stressed individuals suffering from AR did not show notable aggravation or alleviation when compared to damages induced by excess Zn alone.

J	GROSS, EL								PLASTOCYANIN - STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				37	2			103	116		10.1007/BF02187469				AUG 1993	1993	The aim of this review is to analyze the current state of knowledge concerning the blue copper protein plastocyanin (PC) focusing on its interactions with its reaction partners cytochrome f and P700. Plastocyanin is a 10 kD blue copper protein which is located in the lumen of the thylakoid where it functions as a mobile electron carrier shuttling electrons from cytochrome f to P700 in Photosystem I. PC is a typical beta-barrel protein containing a single copper center which is ligated to two histidines, a methionine and a cysteine in a distorted tetrahedral geometry. PC has two potential binding sites for reaction partners. Site 1 consists of the H87 ligand to the copper and Site 2 consists of Y83 which is surrounded by two clusters of negative charges which are highly conserved in higher plant PCs.The interaction of PC with cytochrome f has been studied extensively. It is electrostatic in nature with negative charges on PC interacting with positive charges on cytochrome f Evidence from cross-linking, chemical modification, kinetics and site-directed mutagenesis studies implicate Site 2 as the binding site for Cytf The interaction is thought to occur in two stages: an initial diffusional approach guided by electrostatic interactions, followed by more precise docking to form a final electron transfer complex.Due to the multisubunit nature of the Photosystem I complex, the evidence is not as clear for the binding site for P700. However, a small positively-charged subunit (Subunit III) of Photosystem I has been implicated in PC binding. Also, both chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis experiments have suggested that PC interacts with P700 via Site 1.									105	1	0	0	73	0	106			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1993LW10400002	24317707

Glutathione (GSH) is considered to be an important cellular component involved in protecting cells, both as metal chelating agent and oxygen radical scavenger. In this work we used molecular techniques to analyze the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of genes involved in GSH biosynthesis, gamma-glutamyl-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (ci-gclc), gamma-glutamyl-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (ci-gclm) and GSH synthase (ci-gs) in the solitary tunicate Ciona intestinalis. We also studied the transcription of the above genes after in vivo exposure to Cd, Cu and Zn by semiquantitativ RT-PCR to improve our knowledge about the relationship between metal-induced oxidative stress and GSH production and locate mRNA expression by in situ hybridization (ISH). These genes exhibit a good level of sequence conservation with metazoan homologs generally, especially for residues important for the activity of the enzymes. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the three enzymes evolved in different ways. Ci-GCLC and Ci-GS being mostly correlated with invertebrate proteins, Ci-GCLM being as sister group of vertebrate GCLMs. Our in silico analyses of the ci-gs and ci-gclc promoter regions revealed putative consensus sequences similar to mammalian metal-responsive elements (MRE) and antioxidant response elements (ARE), indicating that the transcription of these genes may directly depend on metals and/or reactive oxygen species. Results highlight a statistically significant increase in gene transcription, demonstrating that metal treatments have inducible effects on these genes. They can modulate gene transcription not only through MREs but also through AREs, as a consequence of metal-dependent ROS formation. The ISH location of Ci-GS and Ci-GCLC mRNAs shows that the cells most involved in glutathione biosynthesis are circulating hemocytes. The data presented here emphasize the importance of complex metal regulation of ci-gclc, ci-gclm and ci-gs transcription, which can create an efficient detoxification pathway allowing C. intestinalis to survive in continued elevated presence of metals in the environment.

J	Botton, Mark L.; Tankersley, Richard A.; Loveland, Robert E.								Developmental ecology of the American horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus								CURRENT ZOOLOGY				56	5			550	562		10.1093/czoolo/56.5.550				2010	2010	During spawning events, horseshoe crab eggs are released from the female's oviducts, and fertilized by one or more males. Eggs are shaped by the female into discrete clutches deposited in nests at depths of 10-20 cm on intertidal estuarine beaches. Distinguishing between fresh eggs and the early developmental stages is obfuscated by the large amount of dense, opaque yolk. The first unambiguous confirmation of development is the formation of the rudimentary prosomatic appendages at the "limb bud" stage. Several days thereafter, the outer chorion is shed and the developing embryo expands and undergoes a series of molts within the clear inner egg membrane. The trilobite (first instar) stage thus attained may remain within the beach sediments for several more weeks, until hatching is facilitated by environmental factors such as hydration, agitation, and osmotic shock that accompany the infiltration of seawater into the nests. Trilobites exhibit endogenous circatidal swimming rhythms that are entrained by mechanical agitation, suggesting that peaks in larval swimming are timed to coincide with periods of high water and the inundation of the nests. Larval swimming is limited and does not appear to result in long-distance dispersal. The limited dispersal of the larvae has important implications for the population dynamics of relatively isolated populations. The rate of larval development is highly plastic and is influenced by temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and the presence of pollutants. The broad environmental tolerances of horseshoe crab embryos and larvae are important in understanding their current geographic distribution and their evolutionary persistence [Current Zoology 56 (5): 550-562, 2010].									35	5	1	0	32	0	37			1674-5507			WOS:000283717500006

The spin state of the non-haem Fe2+ was varied using the CN--binding method (Y. Sanakis, V. Petrouleas, B.A. Diner, Biochemistry 33 (1994) 9922-9928) and the redox state of the quinone acceptor (Q(A)) was changed from semi-reduced to fully reduced (F.J.E. van Mieghem, W. Nitschke, P. Mathis, A.W. Rutherford, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 977 (1989) 207-214). It was found that the triplet was not detectable using continuous wave EPR when Q(A)(-) was present irrespective of the spin-state of the Fe2+. It was also found that the triplet state became detectable by EPR when the semiquinone was removed (by reduction to the quinol) and that the triplet observed was not influenced by the spin state of the Fe2+. Since it is known from earlier work that the EPR detection of the triplet reflects a change in the triplet lifetime, it is concluded that the redox state of the quinone determines the triplet lifetime (at least in terms of its detectability by continuous wave EPR) and that the magnetic state of the iron, (through the weakly exchange-coupled Q(A)(-) Fe2+ complex) is not a determining factor. In addition, we looked for polarisation transfer from the radical pair to Q(A)(-) in PSII where the Fe2+ was low spin. Such polarisation is seen in bacterial reaction centres under comparable conditions. In PSII, however, we were unable to find evidence for such polarisation of the semiquinone. It is suggested that both the short triplet lifetime in the presence of Q(A)(-) and the lack of polarised Q(A)(-) might be explained in terms of the electron transfer mechanism for triplet quenching involving the semiquinone which was proposed previously (F.J.E. van Mieghem, K. Brettel, B. Hillmann, A. Kamlowski, A.W. Rutherford, E. Schlodder, Biochemistry 34 (1995) 4798-4813). It is suggested that this mechanism may occur in PSII (but not in purple bacterial reaction centres) due the triplet-bearing chlorophyll being adjacent to the pheophytin at low temperature as suggested from structural studies (F.J.E. van Mieghem, K. Satoh, A.W. Rutherford, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1058 (1992) 379-385). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.									12	0	0	0	10	0	12			0005-2728	0006-3002		WOS:000075082500002	9757079	
J	Hollinderbaumer, R; Ebbert, V; Godde, D								Inhibition of CO2-fixation and its effect on the activity of Photosystem II, on D1-protein synthesis and phosphorylation								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				52	2			105	116		10.1023/A:1005802623823				MAY 1997	1997	To study the effects of limitations in the Calvin-cycle on Photosystem (PS) II function and on its repair by D1-protein turnover, D,L-glycerinaldehyde (DLGA) was applied to 1 h dark-adapted pea leaves via the petiole. The application resulted in a 90% inhibition of photosynthetic oxygen evolution after 90 min illumination at either 120 or 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). In the control leaves an increase of light-dependent oxygen production to 147 and 171% was observed after 90 min illumination. According to chlorophyll fluorescence quenching analysis the inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport by DLGA led to a substantial increase in the reduction state of the primary quinone acceptor of PS II, Q(A), and to a rise in membrane energetisation. However, PS II functionality was hardly affected by DLGA at the low light intensity as indicated by the constant high yield of variable fluorescence, F-v/F-m. Only at 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) a 15% loss of F-v/F-m was observed in the presence of DLGA indicating that inactivated PS II centres had accumulated. The control leaves also showed a slight loss of F-v/F-m which did not affect photosynthetic electron transport due to a faster reoxidation of Q(A). The relative stability of PS II function in the presence of DLGA could not be ascribed to an increased repair by the rapid turnover of the D1-protein. Radioactive pulse-labelling studies with [C-14] leucine in combination with immunological determination of the protein content revealed that both synthesis and degradation of the protein were inhibited in DLGA-treated leaves whereas in the control leaves a stimulation of D1-protein turnover was observed. The changes of D1-protein turnover could be explained by differences in the occupancy state of the Q(B)-binding niche. A relation between the phosphorylation status of the PS II polypeptides and the turnover of the D1-protein could not be established. As shown by radioactive labelling with [P-32](i), addition of DLGA led to an increase in the phosphorylation level of the PS II polypeptides D1 and D2 at the low light intensity when compared to the non-treated control. At the higher light intensity the phosphorylation level of the PS II polypeptides in control and DLGA-treated leaves were identical in spite of the substantial differences in D1-protein turnover.									3	1	0	0	3	0	4			0166-8595			WOS:A1997XV41200004

GST1-1 and GSTM1-1, are genetically deleted (non-functional alleles GSTT1*0 and GsTM1*0) in a high percentage of the human population, with major ethnic differences. The structures of the GSTT and GSTM gene areas explain the underlying genetic processes. GSTT1-1 is highly conserved during evolution and plays a major role in phase-II biotransformation of a number of drugs and industrial chemicals. e.g. cytostatic drugs, hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons. GSTM1-1 is particularly relevant in the deactivation of carcinogenic intermediates of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Several lines of evidence Suggest that hGSTT1-1 and/or hGSTM1-1 play a role in the deactivation of reactive oxygen species that are likely to be involved in cellular processes of inflammation, ageing and degenerative diseases. There is cumulating evidence that combinations of the GSTM1*0 state with other genetic traits affecting the metabolism of carcinogens (CYP1A1, GSTP1) may predispose the aero-digestivc tract and lung, especially in smokers, to a higher risk of cancer. The GSTM1*0 status appears also associated with a modest increase in the risk of bladder cancer, consistent with a GSTM1 interaction with carcinogenic tobacco smoke constituents. Both human GST deletions, although largely counterbalanced by overlapping substrate affinities within the GST superfamily, have consequences when the organism comes into contact with distinct man-made chemicals. This appears relevant in industrial toxicology and in drug metabolism.									217	6	4	0	172	1	234			1389-2002	1875-5453		WOS:000238932000005	16918316	
J	Christen, G; Reifarth, F; Renger, G								On the origin of the '35-mu s kinetics' of P680(+.) reduction in photosystem II with an intact water oxidising complex								FEBS LETTERS				429	1			49	52		10.1016/S0014-5793(98)00552-3				JUN 5 1998	1998	The origin of the '35-mu s kinetics' of P680(+.) reduction in photosystem II (PS II) with an intact mater oxidising complex has been analysed by comparative measurements of laser flash induced changes of the 830-nm absorption and the relative quantum yield of chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence, The latter parameter was monitored at a time resolution of 500 ns by using newly developed home built equipment [Reifarth, F,, Christen, G, and Renger, G, (1997) Photosynth, Res. 51, 231-242]. It was found that: (i) the amplitudes of the unresolved ns-kinetics of both 830-nm absorption changes and the rise of fluorescence yield exhibit virtually the same period four oscillation pattern when dark adapted samples are excited with a train of saturating laser flashes; (ii) the corresponding oscillation patterns of the normalised extent of the 35-mu s kinetics under identical excitation conditions are strikingly different with maxima after the 3rd and 5th flash for the 830-nm absorption changes vs. pronounced maxima after the 4th and 8th flash for the rise of the fluorescence yield, The period four oscillations unambiguously show that the '35-mu s kinetics' of P680(+.) reduction are characteristic for reactions in PS II entities with an intact water oxidising complex. However, the disparity of the oscillation patterns of (ii) indicates that in contrast to the ns components of P680(+.) reduction the 35-mu s kinetics do not reflect exclusively an electron transfer from Y-Z to P680(+.). It is inferred that a more complex reaction takes place which comprises at least two processes: (a) P680(+.) reduction by Y(Z )and (b) coupled and/or competing reaction(s) which give rise to additional changes of the chlorophyll fluorescence yield.

The deposition conditions are discussed in terms of the electrochemical behavior of the electrodeposition precursor (H2PtCl6). We performed cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the electrochemical Pt deposit on HOPG and on Pt substrates to study the relevant phenomena that affect the morphology of Pt deposition. Under conditions where the Pt deposition occurs and H-2 evolution is occurring at the diffusion-limited rate (-0.3 V vs. NHE), Pt forms larger structures on the surface of HOPG, and the electrodeposition of Pt is not limited by diffusion. This indicates the need for large overpotentials to direct the 2D growth of Pt. Investigation of the possible effect of Cl- showed that Cl- deposits on the surface of Pt at low overpotentials, but strips from the surface at potentials more positive than the electrodeposition potential. The CV of Pt on HOPG is a strong function of the nature of the surface. We propose that during immersion of HOPG in the electrodeposition solution (3 mM H2PtCl6, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 2.3) Pt islands are formed spontaneously, and these islands drive the growth of the 2D nanostructures. The reducing agents for the spontaneous deposition of Pt from solution are proposed as step edges that get oxidized in the solution. We discuss the possible oxidation reactions for the edge sites.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2079-4991		WOS:000448659200036	30154313

The protective role of the omega-class glutathione transferase 3 from O. volvulus (OvGST3) against intracellular and environmental reactive oxygen species has been described previously. In the present study, we continue our investigation of the highly stress-responsive OvGST3. Alternative splicing of two exons and one intron retention generates five different transcript isoforms that possess a spliced leader at their 5'-end, indicating that the mechanism of mature mRNA production involves alternative-, cis- and trans-splicing processes. Interestingly, the first two exons of the ovgst3 gene encode a signal peptide before sequence identity to other omega-class glutathione transferases begins. Only the recombinant expression of the isoform that encodes the longest deduced amino acid sequence (OvGST3/5) was successful, with the purified enzyme displaying modest thiol oxidoreductase activity. Significant IgG1 and IgG4 responses against recombinantly expressed OvGST3/5 were detected in sera from patients with the generalized as well as the chronic hyperreactive form of onchocerciasis, indicating exposure of the secreted protein to the human host's immune system and its immunogenicity. Immunohistological localization studies performed at light and electron microscopy levels support the extracellular localization of the protein. Intensive labeling of the OvGST3 was observed in the egg shell at the morula stage of the embryo, indicating extremely defined, stage-specific expression for a short transient period only.									22	1	0	0	19	0	23			1742-464X	1742-4658		WOS:000256614000015	18537826

The prepared photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), BET, transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), photoluminescence (PL) and electrochemical measurements. Appropriate amount of introduced VB12 can improve photocatalytic activities while excess caused inhibition. The sample with the weight ratio of VB12 in precursors at 1% exhibited the optimum photodegradation efficiency for metronidazole (MTZ), about 2 times as higher as the removal rate of pure g-C3N4. Several effects on the photocatalytic activity was also investigated and the results showed that enough dissolved oxygen and presence of Fe3+ was found to promote MTZ photodegradation, while NO3-, Ca2+ and HCO3- would inhibit it. Superoxide radical center dot O-2(-) was identified as the dominate active specie in photodegradation process and possible enhancement mechanism of introduced VB12 for photocatalytic activities was proposed. It was inferred that the synergistic effect of generated Co3O4 quantum dots and P-doped g-C3N4, including increasing the separation efficiency of photo-inducted electrons and holes, inhibiting the recombination process of them and decreasing the band gap energy, could be the reason for the better photocatalytic activity. At last, MTZ degradation pathway in the photosystem was determined.									60	5	0	0	21	0	61			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000460964000149

It has been reported that many bacterial enzymes exhibiting such converging functions act on a wide range of catecholic substrates. The present study reports a new subfamily of extradiol dioxygenases (EXDOs) with broad substrate specificity, the HrbC EXDOs. The new clade belongs to the XII cluster within family 2 of the vicinal oxygen chelate superfamily (EXDO-VC2), which is typically characterized by a preference for bicyclic substrates. Coding hrbC orthologs were isolated by activity-based screening of fosmid metagenomic libraries from large DNA fragments derived from heavily PAH-contaminated soils. They occurred as solitary genes within conserved sequences encoding enzymes for amino acid metabolism and were stably maintained in the chromosomes of the Betaproteobacteria lineages harboring them. Analysis of contaminated aquifers revealed coexpression of hrbC as a polycistronic mRNA component. The predicted open reading frames were verified by cloning and heterologous expression, confirming the expected molecular mass and metacleavage activity of the recombinant enzymes. Evolutionary analysis of the HrbC protein sequences grouped them into a discrete cluster of 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenases represented by a cultured PAH degrader, Rugosibacter aromaticivorans strain Ca6. The ecological importance and relevance of the new EXDO genes were confirmed by PCR-based mapping in different biogeographical localities contaminated with a variety of monoand polycyclic aromatic compounds. The cosmopolitan distribution of hrbC in PAH-contaminated aquifers supports our hypothesis about its auxiliary role in the degradation of toxic catecholic intermediates, contributing to the composite EXDO catabolic capacity of the world's microbiomes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-9351	1096-0953		WOS:000704706200004	34474030

The activation of the xanthophyll cycle (XC) leading to non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (NPQ) is one of the important mechanisms. We used the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana to investigate the factors controlling the kinetics of NPQ and XC. By adding chemicals to cells exposed to excess light, we found that the increase in NPQ during high light (HL) exposure could not be inhibited by NH4Cl and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), while the increase in diatoxanthin (Dt) could be prevented by DCMU and not by NH4Cl, suggesting that the characteristics of NPQ do not solely depend on the presence of the XC. During HL exposure, the up-regulation of the light harvesting complex protein x 6 (Lhcx6) and Lhcx genes suggests that they are involved in photoprotection. The addition of DCMU and NH4Cl significantly elevated the transcript levels of three of the Lhcx genes during HL treatment, especially Lhcx6. The results suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by DCMU and transthylakoid Delta pH changes elicited by NH4Cl may contribute to the development of NPQ during HL exposure by inducing the gene expression of Lhcx instead of controlling the XC.

J	Liu, Haijun; Frankel, Laurie K.; Bricker, Terry M.					Liu, Haijun/0000-0003-0537-0302			Functional complementation of the Arabidopsis thaliana psbo1 mutant phenotype with an N-terminally His(6)-tagged PsbO-1 protein in photosystem II								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOENERGETICS				1787	8			1029	1038		10.1016/j.bbabio.2009.03.006				AUG 2009	2009	The Arabidopsis thaliana mutant psbo1 has recently been described and characterized. Loss of expression of the PsbO-1 protein leads to a variety of functional perturbations including elevated levels of the PsbO-2 protein and defects on both the oxidizing- and reducing-sides of Photosystem II. In this communication, two plant lines were produced using the psbo1 mutant as transgenic host, which contained an N-terminally histidine(6)-tagged PsbO-1 protein. This protein was expressed and correctly targeted into the thylakoid lumen. Immunological analysis indicated that different levels of expression of the modified PsbO-1 protein were obtained in different transgenic plant lines and that the level of expression in each line was stable over several generations. Examination of the Photosystem II closure kinetics demonstrated that the defective double reduction of Q(B) and the delayed exchange of Q(B)H(2) with the plastoquinone pool which were observed during the characterization of the psbo1 mutant were effectively restored to wild-type levels by the His(6)-tagged PsbO-1 protein. Flash fluorescence induction and decay were also examined. Our results indicated that high expression of the modified PsbO-1 was required to increase the ratio of PS II alpha/PS II beta reaction centers to wild-type levels. Fluorescence decay kinetics in the absence of DCMU indicated that the expression of the His(6)-tagged PsbO-1 protein restored efficient electron transfer to Q(B), while in the presence of DCMU, charge recombination between Q(A)- and the S-2 State of the oxygen-evolving complex occurred at near wild-type rates. Our results indicate that high expression of the His(6)-tagged PsbO-1 protein efficiently complements nearly all of the photochemical defects observed in the psbo1 mutant. Additionally, this study establishes a platform on which the in vivo consequences of site-directed mutagenesis of the PsbO-1 protein can be examined. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Two experimental series, one on synthetic basalt+COH and other with a synthetic andesite+OH, were conducted using a double capsule technique to impose a range of f(H2), on the samples. Quenched glasses were analyzed by FTIR and SIMS. Both series follow simple solubility laws in which molecular H-2 concentrations are proportional to f(H2) and with a partial molar volume of molecular H-2 of 11 cm(3)/mole. Solubilities in andesitic melt are systematically greater than in basaltic liquid in a relationship consistent with control by the ionic porosity (IP) of the melts. Extrapolation based on IP allows estimation of the solubility of H-2 in peridotitic melts applicable to magma oceans. The H-2/(H-2+H2O) ratio in silicate melts (where H2O includes molecular H2O and OH-) increases as conditions become more reduced, with increasing pressure, and with increasing total H. Under some conditions prevailing in the early Earth and terrestrial planets as well as in the deep Earth today, H-2 can be a significant fraction of the dissolved H and at high pressure it may exceed "water" (H2O and OH-). Therefore, magmatic H-2 may influence the initial distribution of volatiles and the redox evolution of terrestrial planets, as well as the ongoing formation and fate of hydrous melts in the deep Earth today. Hydrous species in melts in equilibrium with Fe-rich alloy at high pressure, for example during core formation from a magma ocean, could be chiefly H-2, rather than H2O. Hence, delivery of H-2 to the core by removal of Fe hydride need not be coupled to oxidation of the residual mantle. Although lunar basalts are much reduced, the fraction of H dissolved as molecular H-2 is small owing to low total H concentrations. Extrapolation to conditions of potential hydrous partial melting in the deep Earth suggests that the chief magmatic volatile may be H-2 rather than H2O. The very small partial specific density of magmatic H-2 (0.18 g/cm(3) at low pressure) may provide significant positive buoyancy to deep partial melts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bergin, EA; Goldsmith, PF; Snell, RL; Langer, WD				Goldsmith, Paul/H-3159-2016				The chemical composition and evolution of giant molecular cloud cores: A comparison of observation and theory								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				482	1			285	297		10.1086/304108				JUN 10 1997	1997	We present the results of an observational and theoretical study of the chemical composition and evolution of three giant cloud cores in Orion A, M17, and Cepheus A. This study is the culmination of a chemical survey of 32 transitions of 20 different molecules and isotopic variants in these cloud cores. Using these data, combined with observationally derived physical conditions, chemical abundances were calculated for several positions in each cloud. A global analysis of the molecular abundances shows that, although abundance differences exist, the chemical composition of giant cloud cores is remarkably homogeneous. This agreement suggests that the chemical evolution of the individual giant cloud cores is not unique. The molecular abundances of giant cloud cores are also systematically lower than those observed in the more quiescent dark cloud core TMC-1.A one-dimensional chemical model is presented that examines internal chemical structure induced by a radiation field enhanced by a factor of 10(3)-10(5) above the normal interstellar radiation held. This model integrates the abundances of the various species as a function of depth, producing column densities that can be compared with observations. The one-dimensional model is unable to reproduce the abundances of many molecules for any single time. Two assumptions have been investigated to improve the agreement between theory and observations. These are adding clumps and raising the initial C/O ratio. We find that the inclusion of clumps in the chemical model can reproduce the abundance of C and C+. However, because of the greater weight placed on the photon-dominated region within smaller clumps, clumps have a detrimental effect on reproducing the abundances of other species.Models with a range of C/O ratios are also compared with the measured abundances. Good agreement between this model and the observations at two positions with disparate physical properties is found for early times (t similar to 10(5) yr) and for C/O increased to similar to 0.8. We suggest that one possible interpretation of these results is that the cores are dynamically evolving objects. Either giant cloud cores are intrinsically young objects or the dense material is effectively young by virtue of a complex interchange of material between the clumps and the interclump medium. We suggest that the CS/SO ratio can be used to probe the evolutionary state of and the initial C/O ratio in dense molecular clouds.									73	2	0	0	0	0	75			0004-637X			WOS:A1997XD37000027		
J	Odell, JP; Chappell, MA; Dickson, KA								Morphological and enzymatic correlates of aerobic and burst performance in different populations of Trinidadian guppies Poecilia reticulata								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				206	20			3707	3718		10.1242/jeb.00613				OCT 2003	2003	We examined the mechanistic basis for two whole-animal performance traits, aerobic capacity and burst speed, in six laboratory-reared Trinidadian guppy populations from different native drainages with contrasting levels of predation. Using within- and between-population variation, we tested whether variation in organs and organ systems (heart, gill and swimming motor mass) and the activities of several enzymes that support locomotion (citrate synthetase, lactate dehydrogenase and myofibrillar ATPase) are correlated with aerobic performance (maximum rates of oxygen consumption, V(O2)max) or burst performance (maximum swim speed during escape responses). We also tested for associations between physiological traits and habitat type (different drainages and predation levels).Organ size and enzyme activities showed substantial size-independent variation, and both performance measures were strongly correlated to body size. After accounting for size effects, neither burst nor aerobic performance was strongly correlated to any organ size or enzymatic variable, or to each other. Two principal components (PCI, PC2) in both males and females accounted for most of the variance in the organ size and enzymatic variables. In both sexes, heart and gill mass tended to covary and were negatively associated with citrate synthetase and lactate dehydrogenase activity. In males (but not females), variation in aerobic performance was weakly but significantly correlated to variation in PCI, suggesting that heart and gill mass scale positively with V-O2max. Neither of the component variables and no single morphological or enzymatic trait was correlated to burst speed in either sex.Evolutionary changes in important life history traits occur rapidly in guppy populations subjected to different predation intensities (high mortality in downstream sites inhabited by large predatory fish; low mortality in upstream sites lacking large predators). We found significant differences between stream drainages in all morphological variables and most enzymatic variables, but only the mass of the swimming motor and LDH activity were significantly affected by predation regime. Overall, our data show that microevolution has occurred in the physiological foundations of locomotor performance in guppies, but evolutionary changes in physiology do not closely correspond to the predation-induced changes in life history parameters.									38	0	0	0	37	0	38			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000187393500021	12966062

The shale core samples were obtained during exploratory drilling and analysed for the properties like proximate, petrography, Rock-Eval, Total organic content (TOC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The values of vitrinite content and TOC varies from 2.00 to 16.20 (vol%) and 1.88-6.99 wt % with an average value of 10.34 (vol%) and 3.75 (wt. 0 /0) respectively, suggesting fair to excellent source rock potential of shale for gas. Whereas, results of the Rock-Eval pyrolysis indicated fair to very good source rock potential (S1: 0.04-0.22 and S2: 0.57-39.45). The indicator of thermal maturity parameters like T-max (423-470 degrees C) and VRo (0.64-0.96%), counsels moderately matured shales. The plot of hydrogen index (HI) vs oxygen index (OI), T-max vs HI and TOC vs HI illustrated the presence of type II and III kerogen in studied shales. The uniformity in carbon conversion elucidates negligible effects of intrusive and basin tectonics on shale reservoir which is validated from the passive stable tectonic setting of Ib-River Mand-Raigarh basin which favours deposition of organic matter. The high percentage of quartz (26.30-57.60 vol%) signifying the resistive nature of SiO2 towards erosion and weathering. However, the negligible or typical absence of K-feldspar and a large percentage of kaolinite (16.80-53.30 vol%) attributed to the strong weathering process. Consequently, the instantaneous reduction condition supported the preservation and transformation of organic matter.The paper focuses on the significance of various essential parameters like depositional conditions, organic richness, the degree of maturation, clay types and mineral constituents on the gas genesis and storage. The parameters interpreted through facies and evolution history of the basin to evaluate the prospects of shale gas resource development in Ib-River Mand-Raigarh Basin, India.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1875-5100	2212-3865		WOS:000448677300012

The effects of biomass species, torrefaction temperature and holding time on the hygroscopicity of biochars were investigated under constant temperature and humidity. Combined with the results of N2 adsorption/desorption and FTIR of raw biomass and its biochars, the mechanism of torrefaction conditions on the hygroscopicity of biochar was discussed. The obtained results indicated that water absorption process of biochar can be divided into two stages of initial rapid water absorption and the later slow water absorption. The equilibrium moisture content (EMC) decreases, the hygroscopicity reduction extent (HRE) increases gradually, and hydrophobicity of biochar is enhanced with increasing torrefaction temperature. However, too high torrefaction temperatures (T >= 275 degrees C) has little or even adverse effect on the hydrophobicity of biochars. The longer holding time has a certain influence on the hydrophobicity of biochar, but the overall effect is not significant. The hydrophobicity of woody biochars (PWC and CWC) is better than that of straw biochars (WSC and CSC) at the same torrefaction conditions. The severe torrefaction of T >= 275 degrees C and tau >= 40 min are able to improve the hydrophobicity of woody biochars, however it has negative effect on straw biochars. The hydrophobicity of four biochars is ordered as PW > CW > WS approximate to CS at the same torrefaction conditions. The water adsorption mechanism of biochars is influenced by the coupling effects of physical structure evolution, release of hydrophilic oxygencontaining functional groups and pyrolytic tar condensation, and the severer the torrefaction, the more significant the influence is.

To demonstrate the underlying molecular mechanisms of the phase change, we generated 76,012 ESTs from the whole body and dissected organs in the two phases. Comparing 12,161 unigene clusters, we identified 532 genes as phase-related (P < 0.01). Comprehensive assessment of the phase-related expression revealed that, whereas most of the genes in various categories from hind legs and the midgut are down-regulated in the gregarious phase, several gene classes in the head are impressively up-regulated, including those with peptidase, receptor, and oxygen-binding activities and those related to development, cell growth, and responses to external stimuli. Among them, a superfamily of proteins, the JHPH superfamily, which includes juvenile hormone-binding protein, hexamerins, prophenoloxidase, and hemocyanins, were highly expressed in the heads of the gregarious hoppers and hind legs of the solitary hoppers. Quantitative PCR experiments confirmed in part the EST results. These differentially regulated genes have strong functional implications that numerous molecular activities are involved in phase plasticity. This study provides ample molecular markers and genomic information on hemimetabolous insects and insights into the genetic and molecular mechanisms of phase changes in locusts.									150	33	0	0	151	0	177			0027-8424			WOS:000225951500010	15591108	
J	Li, Hui; Liu, Shuangyu; Yuan, Tianci; Wang, Bo; Sheng, Peng; Xu, Li; Zhao, Guangyao; Bai, Huitao; Chen, Xin; Chen, Zhongxue; Cao, Yuliang								Influence of NaOH Concentration on Sodium Storage Performance of Na0.44MnO2								ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA				37	3					1907049	10.3866/PKU.WHXB201907049				MAR 15 2021	2021	Aqueous sodium ion batteries (ASIBs) have attracted considerable attention for large-scale energy storage because of their prominent advantages of low cost, high safety, and environment-friendliness. Among the reported cathode materials for ASIBs, Na0.44MnO2 exhibits outstanding structural and hydrochemical stability, and hence is of much interest to research scholars. However, the reversible capacity of Na0.44MnO2 in most of the reported ASIBs was only 40 mAh.g(-1) due to the restriction of stable working windows, although the in spite of theoretical capacity is121 mAh.g(-1). Recently, we reported a Zn/Na0.44MnO2 dual-ion battery (AZMDIB) based on a Na0.44MnO2 positive electrode, Zn negative electrode, and 6 molL(-1) NaOH electrolyte. The alkaline solution lowered the proton insertion potential and expanded the stable working window of the Na0.44MnO2 electrode, thus enhancing the reversible capacity to 80 mAh.g(-1). Previous studies have demonstrated that the composition, concentration, and pH of the electrolytes have significant effects on the stable electrochemical window, rate performance, cycling performance, and other electrochemical properties of aqueous batteries. In addition, it has been reported that the co-intercalation of hydrogen ions can be inhibited by increasing the pH of the electrolyte in order to improve the cyclic stability of the electrode. Therefore, exploring the effect of electrolyte concentration and pH on the electrochemical performance of Na0.44MnO2 can provide insight into the design and optimization of high-performance Zn/Na0.44MnO2 aqueous batteries. Hence, in this work, rod-like Na0.44MnO2 was synthesized by ball milling and subsequent high-temperature calcination, and the influence of NaOH concentration on the electrochemical performance of the Na0.44MnO2 electrode was investigated by adopting five different concentrated electrolytes, 1, 3, 6, 8, and 10 mol.L-1 NaOH. The results showed that an increase in NaOH concentration is beneficial for preventing the insertion of protons and improving the cycling performance and the rate performance of the electrode; however, it also leads to premature triggering of the oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, the rate performance would decrease at high NaOH concentration. The Na0.44MnO2 electrode showed optimal electrochemical performance in 8 mol.L-1 NaOH. At a current density of 0.5C (1C = 121 mA.g(-1)), a reversible specific capacity of 79.2 mAh.g(-1) was obtained, and a capacity of 35.3 mAh.g(-1) was maintained even at a high current density of 50C. In the potential window of 0.2-1.2 V (vs. NHE), the capacity retention after 500 weeks was 64.3%, which increased to 78.2% when the potential window was reduced to 0.25-1.15 V, because of the fewer side reactions. In addition, Na0.44MnO2 showed an exceptional ability to sustain overcharging up to 30% in a concentrated alkaline electrolyte (based on the reversible capacity of 79.2 mAh.g(-1)), and the discharge capacity within 80 cycles was almost steady. The above mentioned results form the basis for possible technical directions toward the development of low-cost cathode materials to be used in ASIBs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1000-6818			WOS:000639337800006

GOase is copper dependent and uses oxygen to oxidise the C6-primary alcohol of galactose and produces hydrogen peroxide. The enzyme activity can be conveniently assessed by a colorimetric assay.Objectives: The objective of the present study was to develop an assay system, which is independent of the hydrogen peroxide formation to identify possible fluorinated GOase inhibitors. In case that the inhibitor bears a primary or secondary alcohol, it could also be oxidised by the enzyme. In such case, the colorimetric assay is not able to distinguish between substrate and inhibitor, since oxidation of both molecules would result in the formation of hydrogen peroxide.Methods: D-galactose (D-Gal) was immobilised onto a gold surface functionalised by self-assembled monolayers (SAMs,). A GOase solution was then added to the surface in a droplet for a certain period of time and thereafter washed away. The activity of GOase on the immobilised D-Gal can then be quantified by MALDI-ToF MS.Results: For inhibition studies, GOase was incubated together with 62.5 mM of deoxy-fluorinated monosaccharides on the D-Gal displaying platform. Five deoxy-fluorinated D-Gal showed a >50% inhibition of its activity. The array system has been moreover utilised to determine the apparent IC50 value of 3-F-Gal 15 as a proof of principle.Conclusion: The developed array platform allows the fast identification of GOase substrates and inhibitors from a library of deoxy-fluorinated sugars using MALDI-ToF MS as a label-free read-out method. In addition, the enzymatic reaction enables for the in situ activation of sugar-coated surfaces to bioorthogonal aldehydes, which can be utilised for subsequent chemical modifications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0929-8665	1875-5305		WOS:000413686800009	28741462	
J	Adam, Zachary					Adam, Zachary/0000-0002-3141-8480			Actinides and life's origins								ASTROBIOLOGY				7	6			852	872		10.1089/ast.2006.0066				DEC 2007	2007	There are growing indications that life began in a radioactive beach environment. A geologic framework for the origin or support of life in a Hadean heavy mineral placer beach has been developed, based on the unique chemical properties of the lower-electronic actinides, which act as nuclear fissile and fertile fuels, radiolytic energy sources, oligomer catalysts, and coordinating ions (along with mineralogically associated lanthanides) for prototypical prebiotic homonuclear and dinuclear metalloenzymes. A four-factor nuclear reactor model was constructed to estimate how much uranium would have been required to initiate a sustainable fission reaction within a placer beach sand 4.3 billion years ago. It was calculated that about 1-8 weight percent of the sand would have to have been uraninite, depending on the weight percent, uranium enrichment, and quantity of neutron poisons present within the remaining placer minerals.Radiolysis experiments were conducted with various solvents with the use of uranium-and thorium-rich minerals (metatorbernite and monazite, respectively) as proxies for radioactive beach sand in contact with different carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen reactants. Radiation bombardment ranged in duration of exposure from 3 weeks to 6 months. Low levels of acetonitrile (estimated to be on the order of parts per billion in concentration) were conclusively identified in 2 setups and tentatively indicated in a 3(rd) by gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry. These low levels have been interpreted within the context of a Hadean placer beach prebiotic framework to demonstrate the promise of investigating natural nuclear reactors as power production sites that might have assisted the origins of life on young rocky planets with a sufficiently differentiated crust/mantle structure. Future investigations are recommended to better quantify the complex relationships between energy release, radioactive grain size, fissionability, reactant phase, phosphorus release, and possible abiotic production of sugars, amino acids, activated phosphorus, prototypical organometallic enzymes, and oligomer catalysts at a single putative beach site.									35	1	0	0	16	0	35			1531-1074	1557-8070		WOS:000252268300004	18163867

However, the diversity of immobilized molecular catalysts for the reported hybrid photocathodes is very limited to date, and most of the semiconductor/molecular catalyst hybrid photocathodes still suffer from low efficiency and poor stability. This work demonstrates that the efficiency and stability of a silicon-based photocathode for PEC H-2 production were substantially improved by surface modification with N-5-chelated nickel and cobalt catalysts (denoted as M(N-5)(HA), M = Ni, Co) through a hydroxamate anchor (HA). Compared to previously reported molecular catalyst-modified planar p-Si photocathodes, p-Si/TiO2/Ni(N-5)(HA) displayed higher photocurrent density (up to -1.54 mA cm(-2)) and superior stability for PEC H-2 production at 0 V vs. RHE under simulated 1 sun illumination. Furthermore, a noble-metal-free biomimetic Z-scheme PEC cell was assembled by coupling the newly-built p-Si/TiO2/Ni(N-5)(HA) photocathode with a Co4O4 cubane-modified BiVO4 photoanode. This fully molecular PEC cell produced H-2 and O-2 in a molar ratio of 2 : 1 from water under illumination at zero bias voltage, achieving a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 0.04%, which is the highest efficiency reported so far for molecular catalyst-modified water splitting PEC cells. This is the first efficient noble-metal-free PEC cell assembled with two molecular catalyst-modified hybrid photoelectrodes, either with or without dye sensitization, for unbiased overall water splitting under illumination.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000649277700001		
J	KRIEGER, A; WEIS, E								ENERGY-DEPENDENT QUENCHING OF CHLOROPHYLL-A-FLUORESCENCE - THE INVOLVEMENT OF PROTON-CALCIUM EXCHANGE AT PHOTOSYSTEM-2								PHOTOSYNTHETICA				27	1-2			89	98						1992	1992	The pH-dependent quenching of chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence (the high energy quenching) was characterized by stationary Chl-alpha-fluorescence in the thylakoid membranes and photosystem (PS) 2 preparations. The variable part of fluorescence was quenched, when the pH in the thylakoid lumen decreased below 5.5, i. e., at high DELTApH. This quenching was caused by an inhibition of electron donation from the manganese cluster to the reaction centre of PS 2. The pH response of quenching suggested that a 1 H+-transition with an apparent pK of 4.7 was involved. Parallel to quenching at low pH, a Ca2+-release was measured (1 Ca2+ per 200 Chl). When the DELTApH relaxed and the pH on the lumen side increased again, fluorescence recovered provided Ca2+ was present (K(D) = 100 muM). Both the quenching at low pH and the reactivation at pH > 5.5 are light-dependent processes. In the presence of high concentration of external Ca2+, fluorescence recovered even at low pH. Inhibition of the donor-side of PS 2 directly affected the acceptor-side of PS 2, as seen by a shift of the redox potential of Q(A) from -120 mV (pH 7.0) to +40 mV (pH 4.2). We propose that at high DELTApH (1) the water splitting side is inactivated by release of Ca from a high affinity binding site, and (2) Q(A) is converted to a high-potential form. Excitation energy is then dissipated at the PS 2 reaction centres by a recombination reaction between donor and acceptor side. As a result, Q(A) (and the intersystem electron transport chain) remains oxidized, even in the excessive light.

The responsible virus, WSSV, may show severe disease with significant mortality depending on farm management and environmental and seasonal changes. Data on farm management and environmental parameters were collected from the southwest region of Bangladesh in 2018, and WSSV infection was confirmed by the species-specific gene VP28 using conventional PCR, real-time PCR and sequencing. Through bivariate analysis, nine significant risk factors for WSD were identified, viz. farm age, presence of nursery pond, reservoir of PL, weed in farm area, control of weed, stocking density, stocking frequency, ammonia and oxygen concentration. This study detected 46 WSSV-infected shrimp farms by conventional PCR, whereas real-time PCR identified 47 WSSV-positive out of 49 farms. WSSV prevalence was highest in the Khulna region, with 100% positivity in all seasons. WSSV loads ranged from 5.62 x 10(9) to 2.01 x 10(15) copies/g of shrimp tissue. The VP28 gene sequence confirmed that 15 representative samples were 100% identical to the 2018 WSSV strain of India. The relationships among risk factors, prevalence and severity of disease, and origin of WSSV strains could be impactful for WSD management.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			0022-2011	1096-0805		WOS:000620238500003	33516723

A new method for creating nanopores in single-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets (NSs) by the electrospray deposition of silver ions on a water suspension of the former is introduced. Electrospray-deposited silver ions react with the MoS2 NSs at the liquid-air interface, resulting in Ag2S nanoparticles which enter the solution, leaving the NSs with holes of 3-5 nm diameter. Specific reaction with the S of MoS2 NSs leads to Mo-rich edges. Such Mo-rich defects are highly efficient for the generation of active oxygen species such as H2O2 under visible light which causes efficient disinfection of water. 10(5) times higher efficiency in disinfection for the holey MoS2 NSs in comparison to normal MoS2 NSs is shown. Experiments are performed with multiple bacterial strains and a virus strain, demonstrating the utility of the method for practical applications. A conceptual prototype is also presented.									23	2	0	0	3	0	25				2056-6646		WOS:000452043300006	31565316

Cyp147G1 is one of only two of these cyp genes which are closely associated with a complete electron transfer system.Methods: The substrate range of the enzyme was tested in vitro and the activity of CYP147G1 was reconstituted in vivo by co-producing the P450 with the ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase.Results: Substrates of CYP147G1 include fatty acids ranging from octanoic to hexadecanoic acid. CYP147G1 catalysed the selective hydroxylation of linear and co-2 methyl branched fatty acids at the omega-1 position (>= 98%). Oxidation of omega-1 methyl branched fatty acids generated the omega and omega-1 hydroxylation products in almost equal proportions, indicating altered position of hydrogen abstraction.Conclusions: This selectivity of fatty acid hydroxylation inferred that linear species must bind in the active site of the enzyme with the terminal methyl group sequestered so that abstraction at the C-H bonds of the omega-1 position is favoured. With branched substrates, one of the methyl groups must be close to the compound I oxygen atom and enable hydroxylation at the terminal methyl group to compete with the reaction at the omega-1C-H bond. General significance: Hydroxy fatty acids are widely used for industrial, food and medical purposes. CYP147G1 demonstrates high regioselectivity for hydroxylation at a sub-terminal position on a broad range of linear fatty acids, not seen in other CYP enzymes.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0304-4165	1872-8006		WOS:000456352100014	30476524	
J	BOESGAARD, AM; KING, JR								GALACTIC EVOLUTION OF BERYLLIUM								ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL				106	6			2309	2323		10.1086/116803				DEC 1993	1993	The abundance of Be in the lowest-metallicity stars is a probe of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, and its abundance in halo and disk stars is a probe of galactic evolution and stellar structure. We present observations of the Be II resonance lines in 14 halo stars and 27 (mostly old) disk stars with [Fe/H] from - 2.7 to + 0.13. The spectra were obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii 3.6 m telescope and have a measured resolution of 0.13 angstrom and a median signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 50. For 18 of the 41 stars we have also made observations of the O I triplet at the Palomar 5 m telescope, the UH 2.2 m telescope, and the CFH telescope. Stellar parameters of T(eff), log g, and [Fe/H] were carefully determined from several independent estimates. Abundances are determined for log N(Be/H) and [O/H] from measured equivalent widths, model parameters, and Kurucz (1991) model atmospheres with the RAI10 model atmosphere abundance program. The agreement with previously published Be detections is very good (a mean difference of 0.05 dex) for five of six determinations in four halo stars and in four of five disk stars. Our typical internal error from uncertainities in the stellar parameters and the S/N ratio of the observed spectra is 0.10 dex. The agreement with very recently published O abundances is 0.07(5) dex. It is plausible, but far from conclusive, that there is a plateau in the amount of Be present in the lowest metallicity stars: log N(Be/H) approximately - 12.8 for [Fe/H] < - 2.2. As [Fe/H] increases from - 2.2 to - 1.0, log N(Be/H) increases and the slope is 1.2-1.3, indicating a faster increase in Be than in Fe. This is consistent with the production of Be by spallation reactions between cosmic rays and 0 atoms from massive stars and the production of Fe from intermediate mass stars. The Be and Fe data can also be represented by N(Be) proportional to N(Fe)2.0 as [Fe/H] goes from - 3.0 to - 2.0 and N(Be) proportional to N(Fe)1.0 as [Fe/H] goes from - 2.0 to - 1.0. The disk stars ([Fe/H] = - 1.0 to 0.0) show a spread in Be of nearly an order of magnitude; part of this must be real since the typical uncertainity is 0.10 dex. Evidence for stellar processing of Be exists in the disk stars and in at least two of the halo stars. A plot of Be abundance vs 0 abundances shows that Be increases as O1.12, indicating that Be is produced primarily in the vicinity of supernovae envelopes, but a small and interesting fraction is produced in the general interstellar gas in the halo.									85	0	0	0	0	0	85			0004-6256			WOS:A1993MK86200011

Previous studies revealed a single gene from C. trachomatis, the CT610 gene, that rescues Escherichia coli Delta vabA, Delta pabB, and Delta pabC mutants, which are otherwise auxotrophic for pABA. C1610 shares low sequence similarity to nonheme diiron oxygenases, and the previously solved crystal structure revealed a diiron active site. Genetic studies ruled out several potential substrates for CT610-dependent pABA biosynthesis, including chorismate and other shikimate pathway intermediates, leaving the actual precursor(s) unknown. Here, we supplied isotopically labeled potential precursors to E. coli Delta pabA cells expressing CT610 and found that the aromatic portion of tyrosine was highly incorporated into pABA, indicating that tyrosine is a precursor for CT610-dependent pABA biosynthesis. Additionally, in vitro enzymatic experiments revealed that purified CT610 exhibits low pABA synthesis activity under aerobic conditions in the absence of tyrosine or other potential substrates, where only the addition of a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol appears to stimulate pABA production. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that two conserved active site tyrosine residues are essential for the pABA synthesis reaction in vitro. Thus, the current data are most consistent with CT610 being a unique self-sacrificing enzyme that utilizes its own active site tyrosine residue(s) for pABA biosynthesis in a reaction that requires O-2 and a reduced diiron cofactor.IMPORTANCE Chlamydia trachomatis is the most reported sexually transmitted infection in the United States and the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide. Unlike many other intracellular pathogens that have undergone reductive evolution, C. trachomatis is capable of de novo biosynthesis of the essential cofactor tetrahydrofolate using a noncanonical pathway. Here, we identify the biosynthetic precursor to the p-aminobenzoate (pABA) portion of folate in a process that requires the CT610 enzyme from C. trachomatis. We further provide evidence that CT610 is a self-sacrificing or "suicide" enzyme that uses its own amino acid residue(s) as the substrate for pABA synthesis. This work provides the foundation for future investigation of this chlamydial pABA synthase, which could lead to new therapeutic strategies for C. trachomatis infections.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0021-9193	1098-5530		WOS:000579158900007	32967910

The calculations made use of inferred mass cuts between the central neutron star and the ejected envelope by requiring ejected Ni-56 masses in agreement with supernova light curve observations. Specific emphasis is put on the treatment of the innermost layers, which experience complete Si burning with an alpha-rich freezeout and are the source of Ni-56, the Fe group composition in general, and some intermediate-mass alpha elements like Ti. However, the uncertainty of the mass cut and the delay time between core collapse and the explosion via neutrino heating put limits on the possible accuracy. The predictions are compared with abundances from specific supernova observations (e.g., SN 1987A, 1993J) or supernova remnants (e.g., G292.0 + 1.8, N132D). The amount of detected O-16 and C-12 or products from carbon and explosive oxygen burning can constrain our knowledge of the effective C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 rate in He burning. The Ni-57/Ni-56 ratio (observed via gamma-rays from Co-56,Co-57 decay or spectral features changing during the decay) can give constraints on Y-e in the innermost ejected zones. This helps to locate the position of the mass cut and to estimate the necessary delay time between collapse and explosion, in order to permit the required mass accretion Delta M(acc). Provided that the stellar precollapse models are reliable, this allows additional insight into the exact working of the supernova explosion mechanism. While this has been only possible for one supernova until present (SN 1987A, a 20 M(.) star), we can also compare the ejected composition from other progenitor masses to abundances in low-metallicity stars, which reflect the average Type II supernova composition, integrated over an initial mass function of progenitor stars.									652	7	1	0	3	0	656			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:A1996TZ36600034

Films were prepared by neutral beam enhanced chemical vapor deposition on different substrate materials (p-type Si, Cu, Ti, and Pt) below room temperature. When depositing on Si, doping nitrogen into carbon improved the electrochemical properties despite weak adhesion to the substrate. Nitrogen in a-CN:H formed two different bonding configurations:incorporation into aromatic carbon rings and hydrogen nitride by infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Therefore, delocalization of pi bonds by incorporation of nitrogen affected the electrochemical improvement of the a-CN:H electrode. For samples deposited on a different metal substrate, the adhesion to substrate increased as a function of decreasing oxygen concentration on the metal substrate surface; the Pt substrate performed well with no delamination in our evaluation. The electrochemical properties were improved only in the case of deposition on Pt. Moreover, Pt surface modification by hydrogen beam was also effective; consequently, the electrochemical property of the a-CN:H electrode was superior to the graphite electrode with high temperature annealing. The observed increases in IR spectra of aromatic clusters were in line with the electrochemical improvements of a-CN:H. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous works has focused on vein quartz instead of ore-related jasperoid-like quartz grain due to hard separation. Based upon different cathodoluminescence (CL) textural patterns and intensities observed within the quartz, four generations of quartz from this deposit were identified: Quartz I is sedimentary detrital quartz; Quartz II is syn-mineralization jasperoid-like quartz intergrown with and/or containing fine ( < 10 mu m) As-bearing pyrite and arsenopyrite; Quartz III is late-mineralization veinlet quartz with a small of medium-coarse-grained (about 50-100 mu m) As-bearing pyrite; and Quartz IV is the post-mineralization drusy thick-veined quartz. Analyses by sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) and laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) were used to determine O isotope and trace elements compositions of quartz formed in different stages. The trace elemental (e.g., Al, Li, Ge, Ti) variation of quartz from Quartz II to IV reflect the effects of fluid saturation in CO2 as the result of decarbonization reactions, followed by a progressive fall in CO2, whereas the fluid pH and intensity of argillic alteration increase, progressively. The range of delta(18)O(VSMOW )values in Quartz II (12.1-24.8 parts per thousand) is wide but narrows in Quartz III (24.1-27.8 parts per thousand) and IV (24.3-26.9 parts per thousand). The estimated fluid delta O-18 values of early- or main-stage (calculated from Quartz II) is 3.2-15.9 parts per thousand, the late-stage (calculated from Quartz III) is 12.5-16.2 parts per thousand, and the post-stage (calculated from Quartz IV) is 9.0-11.5 parts per thousand. It is suggested that the ore-forming fluids of Lannigou gold deposit reflect a mixed source: a low O isotope end-member that was magmatic- or basement related, whereas the high O isotope end-member may have been fluid interacted with wall-rock, whose influence strengthened during the mineralization episode. The narrow delta O-18(VSMOW ) ranges of Quartz III and IV also suggest that any meteoric water influence on the late hydrothermal system was weak.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			0375-6742	1879-1689		WOS:000569087600012

However, the mechanisms and methods available for selective doping or modification of the basal plane must be improved. Here we investigate the process of O defect formation in epitaxial single-layer MoS2 on Au(1 1 1) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) during oxidation with O-2 and H2O gas from low vacuum to the mbar range. Both oxidants result in exchange of S in the upper part of the basal plane with O, in line with air exposure experiments. Temperature-dependent measurements show that this is an activated process with an experimentally estimated reaction barrier of similar to 0.79 +/- 0.20 eV. We surprisingly find that the morphology of the MoS2 flakes and their edges remain intact in O-2, even for relatively high degrees of basal plane O exchange, in contrast to the oxidation behavior of exfoliated single-layer MoS2. From analysis of atom-resolved STM images of the MoS2 edges, we can attribute this unusual stability to a passivating effect of excess edge sulfur species adsorbed under the sulfiding conditions of the MoS2 synthesis in H2S gas. We thus demonstrate that control over pre-sulfidation of the edges, temperature and pressure during oxidation can be used in a fast process to form strongly O doped single-layer MoS2 with no degradation of the initial shape and edge structure of the epitaxial MoS2 sheet.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			2053-1583			WOS:000475446600002

This cathode exhibits a maximum deep discharge capacity of 14777.5mAhg(-1) with a 98.1% columbic efficiency at 0.1mAcm(-2). The controlled capacity (500mAhg(-1)) test of this cathode delivers a minimum polarization gap of 0.73V at 0.1mAcm(-2) and is sustained for 100cycles with an energy efficiency of approximately 64% (1stcycle) and 52% (100thcycle) at 0.3mAcm(-2), under the potential window of 2.0-4.5V.

However, in the early Earth where biological activity was absent or limited, abiotic N reduction in hydrothermal systems is thought to be a key process to transform atmospheric N-2 and NOx to ammonium, an essential nutrient to support the emergence of life and also an N form that can be incorporated into rocks. Surprisingly, evidence for abiotic N reduction in the rock record has not been clearly identified. In this study, we reported anomalously low N isotope compositions (delta N-15 values as low as -15.8 parts per thousand) of mica samples in ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic rocks from the Donghai area in the Sulu orogenic belt, eastern China. Compared with mica samples with typical crustal delta N-15 values (3-9 parts per thousand) in similar metamorphic rocks from the western Dabie orogen, the N-15-depleted mica samples from the Sulu orogen are characterized by significant N enrichment (10 times higher) and extreme O-18 depletion (delta O-18 values as low as -9 parts per thousand). These features can be best explained by assimilation of N from a source characterized by extremely low delta N-15 values (less than similar to-16 parts per thousand). The extremely low delta N-15 value would be produced by abiotic N reduction during reaction of a meteoric-hydrothermal fluid with crustal rocks before subduction. This observation provides a clue to the occurrence of abiotic N reduction in continental supracrustal rocks and infer that abiotic N reduction process could be a fundamental process driving the geological N cycling in early Earth.

However, the efficacy of thick TBCs has not been adequate. This study presents a highly durable, thick top-coat (TC) of Lanthanum-gadolinium-yttria stabilized zirconia (La-Gd-YSZ) on high-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF)-bond coat (HVOF-BC). Crack propagation was quantitatively assessed using a three-dimensional (3D) measuring laser microscope due to higher reliability in calculating the actual crack length of TBC. The findings revealed the HVOF-BC is highly durable with intact structural composition, while the conventional TBC of atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) bond coat (APS-BC) of the same composition and thickness with identical TC was detached at a crack-susceptible zone. The significant enhancement in HVOF-BC is due to the low mixed-oxides growth rate in thermally grown oxide (TGO) with a uniform and dense protective layer of stable Al2O3 which reduces crack propagation. Meanwhile, the failure in APS-BC can be attributed to the high TGO growth rate and thickness with segmented and unstable Al2O3. Furthermore, detrimental mixed oxides such as spinel Ni(Cr,Al)(2)O-4 and NiO lead to disastrous horizontal and compressive cracks. To that end, we study the effect of TGO growth and crack propagation on HVOF-BC TBCs using APS-BC TBCs as a reference.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2079-6412		WOS:000502298300029

Herein, we fabricated highly ordered and vertically aligned nanotube arrays of TiON-NT-functionalized with iridium nanoparticles denoted as (Ir/TiON-NTs) for solar-driven water splitting. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) and variable-energy positron annihilation spectroscopy (VEPAS) were performed to quantify the vacancy-type defects of Ir/TiON-NTs relative to TiON-NTs and TiO2-NTs. The results display that the Ir/TiON-NTs exhibit abundant defects such as small nitrogen vacancies, larger size vacancy clusters, and small voids. The obtained photocurrent density of the Ir/TiON-NTs (11.3 mA cm(-2)) is about 3.97, 5, and 11.89 times higher than that of Ir/TiO2-NTs, TiON-NTs, and TiO2-NTs, respectively. The Mott-Schottky analysis revealed the highest significant negative shift in the band potential and the lowest donor density of Ir/TiON-NTs compared to its counterparts. This result is attributed to the unique structural and compositional merits of Ir/TiON-NTs despite the abundant defects, which delay the charge recombination and improve the photocatalytic activity. The presented study may open new frontiers on engineering the defects of metal oxynitrides with metal-based catalysts for photocatalytic applications.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000514293400017

The impact of CoO growth on the physical and chemical properties of ZnO nanostructures was investigated. Then, the ZnO/CoO core/shell nanostructures grown under optimized conditions were adopted for the fabrication of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting devices. The catalytic performance of ZnO nanostructures is substantially improved after their encapsulation with CoO layers. In addition, the chemical stability and durability of the structures are significantly enhanced. Under typical measurement conditions, these surface-modified ZnO nanostructures exhibited incident photon to charge carrier conversion efficiency (IPCE) higher than 16%, and a stable photocurrent density of 1.25 mA cm(-2). Further, these ZnO/CoO nanostructured photoanodes showed a high illumination to dark current density ratio, similar to 2910. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

J	Court, Richard W.; Sephton, Mark A.					Sephton, Mark/0000-0002-2190-5402			Insights into the nature of cometary organic matter from terrestrial analogues								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASTROBIOLOGY				11	2			83	92		10.1017/S1473550411000383				APR 2012	2012	The nature of cometary organic matter is of great interest to investigations involving the formation and distribution of organic matter relevant to the origin of life. We have used pyrolysis-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to investigate the chemical effects of the irradiation of naturally occurring bitumens, and to relate their products of pyrolysis to their parent assemblages. The information acquired has then been applied to the complex organic matter present in cometary nuclei and comae. Amalgamating the FTIR data presented here with data from published studies enables the inference of other comprehensive trends within hydrocarbon mixtures as they are progressively irradiated in a cometary environment, namely the polymerization of lower molecular weight compounds; an increased abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structures; enrichment in C-13; reduction in atomic H/C ratio; elevation of atomic O/C ratio and increase in the temperature required for thermal degradation. The dark carbonaceous surface of a cometary nucleus will display extreme levels of these features, relative to the nucleus interior, while material in the coma will reflect the degree of irradiation experienced by its source location in the nucleus. Cometary comae with high methane/water ratios indicate a nucleus enriched in methane, favouring the formation of complex organic matter via radiation-induced polymerization of simple precursors. In contrast, production of complex organic matter is hindered in a nucleus possessing a low methane/water ration, with the complex organic matter that does form possessing more oxygen-containing species, such as alcohol, carbonyl and carboxylic acid functional groups, resulting from reactions with hydroxyl radicals formed by the radiolysis of the more abundant water. These insights into the properties of complex cometary organic matter should be of particular interest to both remote observation and space missions involving in situ analyses and sample return of cometary materials.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1473-5504			WOS:000300947100002

The conserved cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of SD-RLKs make them interesting candidates for sensing reactive oxygen species (ROS), assisting oxidative stress mitigation and associated signaling pathways during abiotic stresses. However, how closely SD-RLKs are interrelated to abiotic stress mitigation and signaling remains unknown in A. thaliana. Results This study was initiated by examining the chromosomal localization, phylogeny, sequence and differential expression analyses of 37 SD-RLK genes using publicly accessible microarray datasets under cold, osmotic stress, genotoxic stress, drought, salt, UV-B, heat and wounding. Out of 37 SD-RLKs, 12 genes displayed differential expression patterns in both the root and the shoot tissues. Promoter structure analysis suggested that these 12 SD-RLK genes harbour several potential cis-regulatory elements (CREs), which are involved in regulating multiple abiotic stress responses. Based on these observations, we investigated the expression patterns of 12 selected SD-RLKs under ozone, wounding, oxidative (methyl viologen), UV-B, cold, and light stress at different time points using semi-qRT-PCR. Of these 12 SD-SRKs, the genes At1g61360, At1g61460, At1g61380, and At4g27300 emerged as potential candidates that maintain their expression in most of the stress treatments till exposure for 12 h. Expression patterns of these four genes were further verified under similar stress treatments using qRT-PCR. The expression analysis indicated that the gene At1g61360, At1g61380, and At1g61460 were mostly up-regulated, whereas the expression of At4g27300 either up- or down-regulated in these conditions. Conclusions To summarize, the computational analysis and differential transcript accumulation of SD-RLKs under various abiotic stresses suggested their association with abiotic stress tolerance and related signaling in A. thaliana. We believe that a further detailed study will decipher the specific role of these representative SD-RLKs in abiotic stress mitigation vis-a-vis signaling pathways in A. thaliana.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1471-2164			WOS:000717983100002	34772363

Recently, genes encoding the photosystem II reaction center (psbA and psbD) were found in cyanophage genomes. This phenomenon suggested that the horizontal transfer of these genes may be involved in increasing phage fitness. To date, a very small percentage of marine bacteria and phages has been cultured. Thus, mapping genomic data extracted directly from the environment to its taxonomic origin is necessary for a better understanding of phage-host relationships and dynamics.Results: To achieve an accurate and rapid taxonomic classification, we employed a computational approach combining a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a codon usage position specific scoring matrix (cuPSSM). Our method has been applied successfully to classify core-photosystem-II gene fragments, including partial sequences coming directly from the ocean, to seven different taxonomic classes. Applying the method on a large set of DNA and RNA psbA clones from the Mediterranean Sea, we studied the distribution of cyanobacterial psbA genes and transcripts in their natural environment. Using our approach, we were able to simultaneously examine taxonomic and ecological distributions in the marine environment.Conclusion: The ability to accurately classify the origin of individual genes and transcripts coming directly from the environment is of great importance in studying marine ecology. The classification method presented in this paper could be applied further to classify other genes amplified from the environment, for which training data is available.									17	0	0	0	16	0	17			1471-2164			WOS:000267735400002	19445709

We recently showed that mycobacterial cultures contained two subpopulations, short-sized cells (SCs; similar to 10%) and normal/long-sized cells (NCs; similar to 90%). The SCs were significantly more antibiotic-susceptible than the NCs. It implied that the SCs might naturally be predisposed to generate significantly higher levels of ROS than the NCs. This in turn could make the SCs more susceptible to antibiotics or generate more resisters as compared to the NCs. Investigation into this possibility showed that the SCs in the actively growing mid-log phase culture naturally generated significantly high levels of superoxide, as compared to the equivalent NCs, due to the naturally high expression of a specific NADH oxidase in the SCs. This caused labile Fe-2(+) leaching from 4Fe-4S proteins and elevated H2O2 formation through superoxide dismutation. Thus, the SCs of both Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis inherently contained significantly higher levels of H2O2 and labile Fe2+ than the NCs. This in turn produced significantly higher levels of hydroxyl radical through Fenton reaction, promoting enhanced antibiotic resister generation from the SCs than from the NCs. The SCs, when mixed back with the NCs, at their natural proportion in the actively growing mid-log phase culture, enhanced antibiotic resister generation from the NCs, to a level equivalent to that from the unfractionated whole culture. The enhanced antibiotic resister generation from the NCs in the reconstituted SCs-NCs natural mixture was found to be due to the high levels of H2O2 secreted by the SCs. Thus, the present work unveils and documents the metabolic designs of two mycobacterial subpopulations where one subpopulation produces high ROS levels, despite higher susceptibility, to generate significantly higher number of antibiotic resisters from itself and to enhance resister generation from its kin subpopulation. These findings show the existence of an inherent natural mechanism in both the non-pathogenic and pathogenic mycobacteria to generate antibiotic resisters. The presence of the SCs and the NCs in the pulmonary tuberculosis patients' sputum, reported by us earlier, alludes to the clinical significance of the study.									12	0	0	0	8	0	12			1664-302X			WOS:000480537000001	31456773

In this study, PEWE component degradation mechanisms are induced by combining catalyst-coated membranes (CCMs) with specific cell materials and operating conditions. The effect of the cell compression on the catalyst layer performance is investigated using cell assemblies with porous transport layers (PTLs) having different material properties. Rigid PTL-surface features result in local variation in anode catalyst layer (CL) porosity, and increased CL proton transport resistance. The creep of the CCM leads to the formation of thin sections and an increase in the content of H-2 in the O-2 product gas, causing in turn higher fluoride release rate from the ionomer/membrane. In addition, PEWE cells are subjected to a start-stop protocol to promote catalyst degradation through the formation of active, but unstable iridium hydroxo species. An increasing trend of catalyst dissolution is observed in the case of CCM samples that were operated at higher potential.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000518874300060

The physicochemical properties and structural formation of cobalt oxide silica nanocomposites were comprehensive characterized. By using ES40, well-controlled, homogeneous nanoparticle dispersion and size of Co3O4 with 5 nm within the silica matrix were achieved leading to fractal-like morphology. The concentration of the Co3O4 nanocatalyst was also significantly enhanced by more than 50 folds. Fenton-like HCO3-/H2O2 catalytic system using acid orange 7 and nanocomposites was examined for organic degradation. 98% AO7 and naphthalene intermediates degradation efficiency was achieved after 20 min with ES40-derived catalyst, which was three to ten folds faster than that of the TEOS-derived catalyst and the commercial Co3O4 catalyst. The combined use of ES40 sol-gel and RTP enabled a simple way to nanomaterial preparation and lowers overall processing time.									7	0	0	0	2	0	6			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000501613700003

The iridium mass ratio of the prepared La-Ir NF was only 38.8% (wt%), and it shows outstanding OER activity with a lower onset potential and Tafel slope, as well as a 12-fold higher mass activity than that of crystalline IrO(2)oxides. Physical and chemical structural characterization experiments reveal that the amorphous La-Ir NF with a shorter atomic distance and the presence of La ions result in a lower symmetry of the IrO(6)octahedron. The flute-like open structure increases the utilization efficiency of Ir atoms and the 5d orbital electron reconfiguration in the distorted IrO(6)coordination is responsible for the excellent OER activity of the La-Ir NF. Our present study suggests that the amorphous open-structure morphology strategy is a promising way to prepare more efficient electrocatalysts, which can probably be applied to other transition metal oxides.									13	1	0	0	1	0	14			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000544719500029

This variation can be interrupted when biogeographic breaks occur across the range of a species, which are known to affect patterns of community structure, abundance and recruitment dynamics. Coastal biogeographic breaks often impose abrupt changes in environmental characteristics driven by oceanographic processes and can affect the physiological responses of populations inhabiting these areas. Here, we examined thermal limits, performances for heart rate and plasticity in metabolic rate of the intertidal shrimp Betaeus emarginatus from seven populations along its latitudinal range (similar to 3000 km). The distribution of this species encompass two breaks along the southeastern Pacific coast of Chile: the northern break is characterized by sharp discontinuities in upwelling regimes, and the southern break constitutes a major discontinuity in water conditions (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and nutrients), coastline topography and divergence of main oceanographic currents. For B. emarginatus, we found higher plasticity in metabolism at the sites sampled at the biogeographic breaks, and at the site subjected to seasonal upwelling. The variation in metabolic rate was not consistent with increasing latitude and it was not affected by breaks. The lower and upper thermal limits were lower in populations around breaks, although the optimum temperature decreased towards higher latitudes. Overall, whereas thermal limits and plasticity of metabolism are related to biogeographic breaks, metabolic rate is not related to increasing latitude or the presence of breaks in the sampled range.									9	0	0	0	9	0	9			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000447340900011	30072385

Higher photocurrents and photovoltages at (100) n-pyrite rotating disc electrodes in comparison with(lll) electrodes fabricated from the same single crystal are obtained. Further, (100) n-pyrite electrode surfaces were treated with pyrazine and 4,4'-bipyridine. A significant decrease of dark current and a shift of the equilibrium potential in 0.5 M FeSO4 is ascribed to chemical complex formation between the electron donating ligands and the Lewis acidic Fe(II) centres of the (100) n-pyrite surface In the case of pyrazine treatment an enhancement of photocurrent and photovoltage could be observed.

Bertrand, Erin/0000-0002-5950-6810			Phytoplankton antioxidant systems and their contributions to cellular elemental stoichiometry								LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS				7	2			96	111		10.1002/lol2.10233		DEC 2021		APR 2022	2022	Oxidative stress plays a role in many aspects of cellular metabolism, and as a result, antioxidants have the potential to impact cellular stoichiometry and biogeochemical cycles. We reviewed how antioxidant systems influence macronutrient and micronutrient stoichiometry in marine phytoplankton and identified that antioxidant systems have important implications for micronutrient stoichiometry. By leveraging diatom proteomic data, we empirically estimated the level of micronutrient quota variation that can be attributed to antioxidant systems. Fe-containing antioxidant expression may contribute to 3.3-10 timol : mol variation in Fe : C, and superoxide dismutases appear to be important contributors to variation in Mn, Ni, Zn, and Cu quotas in phytoplankton. Critical next steps for the study of phytoplankton antioxidant systems are to (1) distinguish between oxidative stress and redox-based gene regulation and (2) determine how antioxidants influence variation or consistency in micronutrient quotas under various environmental conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2378-2242		WOS:000734165300001

It can be divided into selenium-dependent GPx (Se-GPx) and selenium-independent GPx (non-Se-GPx) subfamilies. In this study, the full-length cDNA of a non-Se-GPx was identified from Venerupis philippinarum (denoted as VpGPx) using EST analysis and RACE approaches. The full-length cDNA of VpGPx encoded a polypeptide of 226 amino acids with the predicted molecular mass of 25.41 similar to kDa. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that VpGPx had higher evolutional conservation to invertebrate than vertebrate counterparts and should be a new member of the GPx protein family. Spatial expression analysis found that VpGPx transcript was most abundantly expressed in hepatopancreas, gills and haemocytes, and weakly expressed in the tissues of mantle. After Vibrio anguillarum challenge, the expression of VpGPx transcript in overall haemocyte population was down-regulated in the first 6 similar to h, and increased to the peak at 48 similar to h. As time progressed, the expression level dropped to 0.5-fold of the control level at 96 similar to h. All these results indicated that VpGPx was perhaps involved in the immune response against microbe infection and might be contributed to the clearance of bacterial pathogens.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1355-557X	1365-2109		WOS:000306184700013

Herein, we illustrate the synthesis and photo catalytic performance of a judiciously designed plasmonic Au nanoparticles photodeposited on TiO2-decorated N-doped graphene (ANGT-x) heterostructure catalyst showing remarkably enhanced CO2 reduction activity with high selectivity for methane production. Compared to typical binary Au-TiO2 photocatalyst, the ANGT2 exhibited almost 60 times higher electron consumption rate (R-electron) value similar to 742.39 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) for the reduced products, which, to the best of our knowledge is the highest PCO2R rate ever reported under comparable conditions. The superior performance of ANGT2 catalyst is attributed to the synergistic contributions from improved light absorbance, enhanced CO2 uptake together with improved charge transfer kinetics and efficient suppression of photogenerated (e-h) recombination rate bestowed by seamless interfacial contact between Au NPs and N-graphene-TiO2 components.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000790409300003

Here, a novel Ru-rich Pt-RuO2 heterojunction catalyst was synthesized via a solvothermal process followed by thermal treatment. The Pt-RuO2 catalyst has ultrafine Pt clusters and a heterojunction interface between Pt and RuO2, which facilitates high hydrogen oxidation activity while minimizing adverse adsorption of the phenyl group in the polymer electrolyte. The performance of a membrane electrode assembly employing the Pt-RuO2/C reached a peak power density of 0.77 W cm(-2) with an anode Pt loading of 25 mu g(Pt) cm(-2), achieving a specific power of 31 W mg(Pt)(-1) under H-2/O-2 conditions. The combined analysis of electrode performance and cost indicates that Pt-RuO2/C is one of the most promising catalysts that is approaching the U.S. DOE 2020 performance and cost targets for transportation applications.									26	1	0	0	1	0	24			2055-6756	2055-6764		WOS:000511441800008

AACVD has been already demonstrated to be a useful tool to load different ranges of nanoparticles on top of an already grown layer. This procedure enables growing the gas sensitive nanomaterials directly onto application substrates for the development of chemo-resistive gas sensors. The morphology and composition of the different materials were characterized via different techniques. It was found that iridium oxide loading resulted in remarkable changes in the morphology and defects of tungsten oxide nanowires. The gas sensing properties of such layers were studied towards ethanol or ammonia vapors, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, and nitrogen dioxide. The optimization of the operating temperature and the level of iridium oxide loading results in an improvement in the responsiveness and selectivity towards the species tested. In particular, a dramatically high increase in the response towards nitrogen dioxide is achieved. The mechanisms of gas sensing are discussed in detail. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, sacrificial templates and complicated processes are generally required to generate mesopores. Herein, we discover the bifunctional templating talent of polyoxometalates (POMs) for generating not only mesopores but also reactive surfaces in metal oxides, and a facile, recyclable, and general method is reported. By mechanochemical ion-sharing between metal salts and POMs, metal precursors undergo pyrolysis around large POM clusters, which can incorporate abundant mesopores into metal oxides (e.g., Co3O4, Fe3O4, NiO, La2O3, MnO2, CeO2, ZrO2, and CuO) with ultrahigh specific surface areas (up to 210 m(2) g(-1)) after simply being recycled by water washing. Unexpectedly, the oxidative feature of POMs naturally contributes to the formation of high valence metal cations on the material surface. As an example, the Co3O4 sample with both mesopores and enriched surface Co3+ species was more active than Co3O4 derived from a silica template (T-100 = 200 degrees C) and commercial Co3O4 (T-100 = 250 degrees C), in CO oxidation. The current strategy may provide a promising route for the commercialization of mesoporous metal oxides with preferred surface features.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000502302300008

It was shown that the final products greatly depend on the nature of the precursor. Using tungsten peroxide/2-propanol derived precursor almost pure WC was obtained which was subjected to further electrochemical investigation. It was shown that it is necessary to decorate WC with Pt nanoparticles in order to obtain satisfactory fuel cell performance, but catalytic activity of Pt/WC anode catalyst is not expected to overcome the activity of Pt/C. It is argued that new synthetic routes for the preparation of WC should be directed towards obtaining highly dispersed WC, that is, WC with high external surface area available for Pt deposition, rather than high specific surface area WC with large contribution of micropores having no importance when it comes to the use of WC as a catalyst support. The true benefit of the use of WC as catalyst support is found in increased CO tolerance/CO oxidation activity of WC-supported Pt catalysts. Qualitative mechanistic view on increased CO oxidation activity of Pt/WC is offered. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the full-length cDNAs of three PHD genes were obtained from Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, which is an important freshwater fish and sensitive to low oxygen tension. The amino acid sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis of PHDs were performed among various species. Furthermore, the expression patterns and the transcriptional responses of H. molitrix PHD genes to acute hypoxia, continued hypoxia, and reoxygenation were explored in different tissues. Our study preliminarily explored the physiological regulation functions of PHD genes at the transcriptional level when addressing the hypoxic challenge and provided a foundation for future systematic explorations of the molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia adaptation in silver carp. As an economically and ecologically important freshwater fish, silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) is sensitive to low oxygen tension. Prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins are critical regulators of adaptive responses to hypoxia for their function of regulating the hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha subunit (HIF-1 alpha) stability via hydroxylation reaction. In the present study, three PHD genes were cloned from H. molitrix by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The total length of HmPHD1, HmPHD2, and HmPHD3 were 2981, 1954, and 1847 base pair (bp), and contained 1449, 1080, and 738 bp open reading frames (ORFs) that encoded 482, 359, and 245 amino acids (aa), respectively. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that HmPHD1, HmPHD2, and HmPHD3 had the conserved prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha subunit homolog domains at their C-termini. Meanwhile, the evaluation of phylogeny revealed PHD2 and PHD3 of H. molitrix were more closely related as they belonged to sister clades, whereas the clade of PHD1 was relatively distant from these two. The transcripts of PHD genes are ubiquitously distributed in H. molitrix tissues, with the highest expressional level of HmPHD1 and HmPHD3 in liver, and HmPHD2 in muscle. After acute hypoxic treatment for 0.5 h, PHD genes of H. molitrix were induced mainly in liver and brain, and different from HmPHD1 and HmPHD2, the expression of HmPHD3 showed no overt tissue specificity. Furthermore, under continued hypoxic condition, PHD genes exhibited an obviously rapid but gradually attenuated response from 3 h to 24 h, and upon reoxygenation, the transcriptional expression of PHD genes showed a decreasing trend in most of the tissues. These results indicate that the PHD genes of H. molitrix are involved in the early response to hypoxic stress, and they show tissue-specific transcript expression when performing physiological regulation functions. This study is of great relevance for advancing our understanding of how PHD genes are regulated when addressing the hypoxic challenge and provides a reference for the subsequent research of the molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia adaptation in silver carp.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			2076-2615			WOS:000758659800001	35049755

At the Tuusula waterworks in southern Finland, surface water is artificially recharged into an esker by pond infiltration and an equal amount of groundwater is daily pumped from the aquifer. This groundwater study was conducted to consider the role of redox processes in the decomposition of DOC. The isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic C (delta(13) C-DIC) in the recharged water was used as a tracer for redox reactions. The isotopic composition of 0 and H in water was determined in order to calculate mixing ratios between the local groundwater and the infiltrated surface water. Three distinct processes in the reduction of the DOC content were traced using isotopic methods and concentration analyses of DIC and DOC: (1) the decomposition of DOC, (2) adsorption of DOC on mineral matter, and (3) the dilution of artificially recharged water by mixing with local groundwater. The largest decrease (44%) in the DOC content occurred during the early stage of subsurface flow, within 350 m of the infiltration ponds. The reduction of DOC was accompanied by an equal increase in DIC and a significant drop in delta(13) C-DIC. This change is attributed to the oxidative decomposition of DOC. A further 23% decrease in DOC is attributed to adsorption and a final drop of 14% to dilution with local groundwater. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Pujols-Ayala, I; Barry, BA								Histidine 190-D1 and glutamate 189-D1 provide structural stabilization in photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				41	38			11456	11465		10.1021/bi026172l				SEP 24 2002	2002	In photosynthesis, photosystem II (PSII) conducts the light-driven oxidation of water to oxygen. Tyrosine Z is Tyr 161 of the D1 polypeptide; Z acts as an intermediary electron carrier in water oxidation. In this report, EPR spectroscopy was used to study the effect of His 190 and Glu 189 on Z. yield and reduction kinetics. Neither mutation has a significant impact on the EPR line shape of Z.. At room temperature and pH 7.5, the E189Q-D1 mutation has a single turnover Z. yield that is 84% compared to wild-type. The H190Q-D1 mutation decreases the Z. yield at room temperature by a factor of 2.6 but has a more modest effect (factor of 1.6) at -10 degreesC. The temperature dependence is shown to be primarily reversible. Neither mutation has a dramatic effect on Z. decay kinetics. The Z. minus Z FT-IR spectrum, recorded at pH 7.5 on H190Q, reveals perturbations, including an increased spectral contribution from a PSII chlorophyll. The Z. minus Z FT-IR spectrum, recorded at pH 7.5 on E189Q, shows perturbations, including a decreased contribution from the carboxylate side chain of a glutamate or aspartate. Temperature-dependent changes in H190Q-D1 and E189Q-D1 Z. yield are attributed to a reversible conformational change, which alters the electron-transfer rate from Z to P-680(+). On the basis of these results, we conclude that H190 and E189 play a role in the structural stabilization of PSII. We Postulate that some or all of the phenotypic changes observed in H190Q and E189Q mutants may be caused by structural alterations in PSII.									8	0	0	0	6	0	8			0006-2960			WOS:000178084700017	12234188

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies on compounds 1-3 revealed a monomeric structure with distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry. Owing to the promising thermal properties, metalorganic CVD of CoOx was performed using compound 1 as a representative example. The thin films deposited on Si(100) consisted of the spinelphase Co3O4 evidenced by XRD, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry/nuclear reaction analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Photoelectrochemical water-splitting capabilities of spinel CoOx films grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and TiO2-coated FTO revealed that the films show p-type behavior with conduction band edge being estimated to 0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. With a thin TiO2 underlayer, the CoOx films exhibit photocurrents related to proton reduction under visible light.									12	0	1	0	0	0	13			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000431833500044	29664288

Herein, a triadic photoanode consisting of dual-sized CdTe quantum dots (QDs), Co-based layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets, and BiVO4 particles, that is, QD@LDH@BiVO4, was designed. Two sets of consecutive Type-II band alignments were constructed to improve photogenerated electron hole separation in the triadic structure. The efficient charge separation resulted in a 2-fold enhancement of the photocurrent of the QD@LDH@BiVO4 photoanode. A significantly enhanced oxidation efficiency reaching above 90% in the low bias region (i.e., E < 0.8 V vs RHE) could be critical in determining the overall performance of a complete photoelectrochemical cell. The faradaic efficiency for water oxidation was almost 90%. The conduction band energy of QDs is similar to 1.0 V more negative than that of LDH, favorable for the electron injection to LDH and enabling a more efficient hole separation. The enhanced photon-to-current conversion efficiency and improved water oxidation efficiency of the triadic structure may result from the non-negligible contribution of hot electrons or holes generated in QDs. Such a band-matching and multidimensional triadic architecture could be a promising strategy for achieving high-efficiency photoanodes by sufficiently utilizing and maximizing the functionalities of QDs.									187	11	0	0	13	0	189			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000380968300031	27419597

The CoP nanoparticles not only serve as a cost-effective cocatalyst but also provide abundant surface active sites, which facilitate rapid transfer of photogenerated carriers. The Ti3(+) and oxygen vacancy defects extend photoresponse from UV to visible light region, and enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers efficiently. Because of surface plasma resonance (SPR) of Cu, Cu/TiO2-x/CoP with average particle size of 100-200 nm has significant photothermal effect, in which the temperature of Cu/TiO2-x/CoP is increased by 76 degrees C with irradiation for 30 s, similar to 8 times higher than that of the original TiO2. Cu/TiO2-x/CoP exhibits a high photocatalytic degradation rates for highly toxic 2,4-dichlorophenol (99.2%) and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (98.5%), which higher 7.6 and 8.9 times than the initial TiO2, respectively. Thanks to the particle-level hierarchical heterojunction, the efficient surface engineering and SPR effect favoring the spatial charge separation, Cu/TiO2-x/CoP shows excellent photocatalytic-photothermal Performance.

By controlling Al fraction, electrodes are obtained with varied microstructure. SEM and EDX are implemented to check the micromorphology of electrodes. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are performed to estimate the effect of Al addition on electrode performance. Resultantly, significant improvement of electrode performance is achieved by increasing the fraction of Al from 10 vol% to 20 vol%. The obtained coatings are found with numerous pores owing to the removal of Al during the activation. By applying electrochemical test, the HER of all samples are dominated by Volmer step, and sample N20A is found with the highest active surface area. Thus, sample N20A exhibits the highest electro-catalytic activity to HER of alkaline water electrolysis. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Of these processes, the charge transfer rate at the electrode|electrolyte interface is the slowest and, hence, the rate-limiting step causing charge accumulation. Such an understanding underpins efforts focused on applying highly active electrocatalysts, which may contribute to the overall performance by augmenting surface charge accumulation, prolonging charge lifetime or facilitating charge transfer. How the overall effect depends on these individual possible mechanisms has been difficult to study previously. Aiming at advancing knowledge about this important interface, we applied first-order serial reactions to elucidate the charge excitation, separation and recombination kinetics on the semiconductor|electrocatalyst interfaces in air. The study platform for the present work was prepared using a two-step Mo-doped BiVO4 film modified with an ultrathin Fe-doped NiO nanosheet, which was derived from an Fe-doped -Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet by a convenient precipitation and ion-exchange method. The simulation results of the transient surface photovoltage (TSPV) data showed that the surface charge accumulation was significantly enhanced, even at an extremely low coverage (0.12-120 ppm) using ultra-thin Fe-NiO nanosheets. Interestingly, no improvement in the charge separation rate constants or reduction of recombination rate constants was observed under our experimental conditions. Instead, the ultra-thin Fe-NiO nanosheets served as a charge storage layer to facilitate the catalytic process for enhanced performance.									28	0	0	0	1	0	28			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000452775900011	30627404

The specific surface area of g-C3N4 obtained by heating melamine at 550 degrees C was only 7.7 m(2) g(-1), which was too small for it to be utilized as a catalyst for air purification. By the hydrothermal treatment with NaOH solution at 90-150 degrees C, the surface area was increased up to 65 m(2) g(-1), and the oxidation rate of nitrogen oxide (NO) under visible light (380 < lambda < 480 nm) was increased by 8.6 times. XRD, ESR, elemental analysis and electron microscopy showed that unstable domains of not-well-ordered carbon nitride were removed by hydrolysis to form a mesoporous structure with a higher surface area. Deactivation of g-C3N4 was not observed during the experimental period, although a small part of carbon nitride was decomposed by self-oxidation.									293	21	0	0	33	0	304			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000318565700025

The novel strategy is based on a facile one-pot pyrolysis treatment of cobalt (II) acetylacetonate and nitrogen-rich organic precursors under Ar atmosphere at 800 degrees C, resulting in the formation of Co- and N- co-doped carbon nanotube with earthworm-like morphology. The obtained catalyst was found to have a high density of defect sites, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. Here, cobalt (II) nanoparticles were stabilized on the atomically dispersed cobalt- and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes. The catalyst was confirmed to be effective in the catalytic hydrolysis of ammonia borane, in which the turnover frequency was 5.87 mol H-2.mol(Co)(-1).min(-1) and the specific hydrogen generation rate was determined to be 2447 mL H-2.g(Co)(-1).min(-1). A synergistic function between the Co nanoparticle and the doped carbon nanotubes was proposed for the first time in the catalytic hydrolysis of ammonia borane reaction under a mild condition. The resulting hydrogen production with its high energy density and minimal refueling time could be suitable for future development as energy sources for mobile and stationary applications such as road trucks and forklifts in transport and logistics.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1940-087X			WOS:000802600300023	34927608

An enhanced electrochemical water oxidation performance of the nanoparticles can be achieved by mixing them with other types of highly conductive nano/micro-structured materials. Conductive polymers would be one of the candidates to achieve this goal. Here, we report our recently developed nano-Co3O4 and polypyrrole composites for enhanced electrochemical water oxidation. We chose polypyrrole as a support of nano-Co3O4 to obtain highly active sites of nano-Co3O4 with high conductivity. Morphological and chemical characterization of the prepared materials were performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). After immobilizing them individually on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, their electrocatalytic properties toward water oxidation were investigated. The optimum composite materials showed significantly higher electrocatalytic properties compared to that of pure nano-Co3O4 and polypyrrole. Electrochemical impedance studies indicated that the composite materials possess significantly less electron transfer resistance toward water oxidation reaction compared to that of only polypyrrole or nano-Co3O4, while the higher double-layer capacitance and polarization resistance values obtained from fitting of the impedance data represent the faster electrode kinetics in the composite electrocatalyst. Due to the synergetic effect, the optimum nano-Co3O4 and polypyrrole composites could be represent a novel and promising material for water oxidation.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000591920600001	33191635

We hereby report construction of a Liexcess rock-salt oxide Li1+xNi1/2-3x/2Ru1/2+x/2O2 electrode, with cost effective and eco-friendly 3d transition metal Ni partially substituting precious 4d transition metal Ru. It can be seen that O-2(n-) is formed in pristine Li1.23Ni0.155Ru0.615O2, and stably exists in subsequent cycles, enabling discharge capacities to 295.3 and 198 mAh g(-1) at the 1st/50th cycle, respectively. Combing ex-situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and electrochemical characterization, we demonstrate that the excellent electrochemical performance comes from both percolation network with disordered structure and cation/anion redox couples occurring in charge-discharge process. Li- excess and substitution of common element have been demonstrated to be a breakthrough for designing novel high performance commercial cathodes in rechargeable lithium ion battery field.

It is generally believed that the instabilities and performance losses become exponentially aggravated as the nickel content increases. Disparate from this prevailing belief, it is herein demonstrated that NMC cathodes with higher Ni contents may imply better overall stability than "lower-Ni" cathodes under an identical degree of delithiation (charging) conditions. With two representative cathodes, LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and LiNiO2, a systematic investigation into their stabilities with control of the degree of delithiation is presented. Electrochemical tests indicate that LiNiO2 displays better cyclability than LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 at the same delithiation state. Comprehensive structural and interphase investigations unveil that the inferior cyclability of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 predominantly results from aggravated parasitic reactions, and the interphase stability may be more critical than lattice stability in dictating cyclability. Also, LiNiO2 delivers similar or better thermal behavior than LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2. The findings demonstrate a strong correlation of the stability of NMC cathodes to the degree of delithiation state rather than the Ni content itself, highlighting the importance of reassessing the true implications of Ni content and structural and interphasial tuning on the stabilities of NMC cathodes.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000669421100001	34219283

DMEs can be classified into two main groups: oxidative or conjugative. The NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (P450R)/cytochrome P450 (P450) electron transfer systems are oxidative enzymes that mediate phase I reactions, whereas the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are conjugative enzymes that mediate phase II enzymes. Both enzyme systems are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where a number of drugs are sequentially metabolized. DMEs, including P450s and UGTs, generally have a highly plastic active site that can accommodate a wide variety of substrates. The P450 and UGT genes constitute a supergene family, in which UGT proteins are encoded by distinct genes and a complex gene. Both the P450 and UGT genes have evolved to diversify their functions. This chapter reviews advances in understanding the structure and function of the P450R/P450 and UGT enzyme systems. In particular, the coordinate biotransformation of xenobiotics by phase I and 11 enzymes in the ER membrane is examined.									137	3	0	0	105	0	140			0074-7696		978-0-12-374114-1	WOS:000246617000002	17482904

This review is devoted to the relations between Brucella spp. and professional phagocytes, particularly macrophages and macrophagic cell lines in vitro. Although numerous studies have been reported, the type of ingestion by macrophages, the receptor involved, and the molecular mechanisms, are poorly understood. The ability of most Brucella species to actively inhibit their ingestion by neutrophils or macrophages has been proposed as an explanation for the poor rate of in vitro phagocytosis and in vivo alteration of the phagocytic cells. Oxidative burst plays a significant role in the antibacterial processes of phagocytic cells. The effects of whole or fractioned B. abortus on the ability of neutrophils to induce an oxidative burst in response to stimulation with opsonized zymosan particles were examined. Besides oxygen-based killing, the phagocytic cells have developed other types of defence, including hydrolytic enzymes and reactive halides. Inside the cell, the bacteria encounter new environmental conditions. Their survival is conditioned by an adaptation to this new situation. Pathogens that have acquired the ability to multiply within macrophages should synthesize products specifically interacting with the host cell defence system. Survival of intracellular pathogens is closely linked to the mechanisms of evasion from cellular defences. Brucellae stay in membrane bound vacuoles called phagosomes, but the exact nature and the maturation pathway of this compartment have not yet been understood. Macrophages play a central role in the evolution of brucellosis; this first interaction between the pathogens and the cell will determine the course of the disease. There are natural differences between brucellae species regarding macrophage response to the bacteria.									70	1	2	0	65	0	76			0213-4101			MEDLINE:8767704	8767704

Although high valent key intermediate species arising in catalytic cycles of this family of compounds have remain elusive due to the lack of additional anionic ligands that could potentially stabilize them, mechanistic studies performed on this system proposed a water nucleophilic attack (WNA) mechanism for the O-O bond formation. Employing in situ experimental conditions and complementary spectroscopic techniques allowed to observe intermediates that provide support for a WNA mechanism, including for the first time a Ru(V) oxo intermediate based on the Py(2)Metacn ligand, in agreement with the previously proposed mechanism.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2196-0216			WOS:000734675800001	35874044	
J	Halley, SW; Walshe, JL								A reexamination of the Mount Bischoff cassiterite sulfide skarn, western Tasmania								ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS				90	6			1676	1693		10.2113/gsecongeo.90.6.1676				SEP-OCT 1995	1995	The Mount Bischoff tin deposit occurs in a dolomite unit within structurally complex, late Precambrian reeks which were included by a swarm of narrow, vertical to steeply dipping, quartz-feldspar porphyry dikes of Devonian age.The dikes are distributed in a crudely radial pattern and gravity data indicate that a shallow granite ridge beneath Mount Bischoff is connected to the Meredith Granite. The dike rocks have undergone an early stage of potassic alteration which was overprinted to a variable degree by later greisenization. The alteration shows a zonation along and also across the dikes consistent with suggestions that the dikes were major fluid conduits. Within the dolomite, replacement occurred in two separate and distinct stages. During stage 1, serpentine and chondrodite assemblages formed at 400 degrees to 460 degrees C from hydrothermal fluids with 30 to 36 wt percent NaCl. A zonation from serpentine to chondrodite to magnesite reflects the lowering of the silica activity in the fluid as it reacted with the dolomite. During stage 2, quartz, talc, phlogopite, and carbonate assemblages formed at 320 degrees to 360 degrees C from hydrothermal fluids with about 2 m NaCl, 1.5 m CO2, and 0.3 m CH4. The zonation in these assemblages from quartz to talc to ferroan magnesite also reflects decreasing silica activity in the fluid. The stage 2 assemblages extensively overprinted the earlier formed assemblages. Pyrrhotite is the dominant sulfide and textural studies suggest that it was formed early in stages 1 and 2 and nas overprinted by the later silicates. Cassiterite was precipitated predominantly within the quartz and talc assemblages during stage 2. Fluid inclusions and textures related to the stage 2 mineralization indicate that the fluid was boiling. Loss of H-2 in the vapor, combined with wall-rock reactions, precipitated tin from the fluid.The delta(18)O values of the hydrothermal carbonates (16.4-19.3) indicate that the hydrothermal fluid was isotopically heavy and was probably highly exchanged with an O-18-rich sedimentary reek. Sulfur isotope data show a bimodal distribution with values for stage 1 samples ranging between -1.9 to 0.0 per mil and values for stage 2 between 1.5 to 4.5 per mil. The near-zero values for stage 1 sulfides suggest a primitive magmatic source whereas the heavier values for stage 2 suggest a sedimentary source.To account for both the geologic and the isotopic constraints we propose that the Mount Bischoff deposit formed by a two-step enrichment-mineralization process. The first step involved the enrichment of the apical portions of the Meredith Granite with tin, fluorine, boron, and other incompatibles during late-stage fractionation. The second step involved reduced, nonmagmatic fluids entering the solidified granite, mixing with late magmatic fluids, and reacting with the granite, and-then altering and extracting tin and fluorine from the enriched zones. These fluids, driven by residual heat in the granite and focused by dikes and related faults, rose through these structures eventually encountering, altering, and mineralizing the dolomite by a combination of wall-rock and boiling induced reactions.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0361-0128			WOS:A1995TT49700015

A major focus is to determine the effect of the local boron doping level, within the same orientation grains, on the solvent window response. EBSD is used to select the predominant (110) orientated areas of the surface with different boron-doped facets, thereby eliminating crystallographic effects from the electrochemical response. Voltammetric SECCM is employed, whereby a cyclic voltammogram is recorded at each pixel mapped by the meniscus-contact SECCM cell. The data obtained can be played as an electrochemical movie of potential-resolved current maps of the surface to reveal spatial variations of electroactivity, over a wide potential range, including the solvent (electrolyte) window. Local heterogeneities are observed, indicating that the solvent window is mainly linked to local dopant levels, with lower dopant levels leading to a wider window, that is, slower electrode kinetics for solvent/electrolyte electrolysis. Furthermore, the effects of O- and H-surface termination of the BDD surface are investigated for the same electrode (in the same area). The surface termination is a particularly important factor: the solvent window of an H-terminated surface is wider than for O-termination for similar boron dopant levels. Furthermore, the anodic potential window of the O-terminated surface is greatly diminished due to chloride electro-oxidation. These studies provide new perspectives on the local electrochemical properties of BDD and highlight the importance of probing the electrochemistry of BDD at the level of a single crystalline grain (facet) to unravel the factors that control the solvent (aqueous) window of these complex heterogeneous electrodes.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2196-0216			WOS:000448518500015

One approach involves artificial photosynthesis to drive solar energy for water splitting into hydrogen or to reduce CO2 to reduced carbon fuels. In such reactions, cheap electrons from water oxidation are critical. Herein we aim to design and synthesize an artificial water-oxidizing enzyme with highly active site densities, report on nano-sized Mn-Ca oxide in two engineered polypeptides (Arg-Arg-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Arg-Arg and Tyr-Tyr-Tyr-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-His-Tyr-Tyr-Tyr) as structural models for biological water-oxidizing site in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. The compounds were synthesized by a simple procedure and characterized with multiple methods. Using Nafion, electrochemical studies show the peptide has an important effect on the potential for Mn(III)/Mn(IV) oxidation on Mn-Ca oxide and it is decreased in the presence of the poly peptide. We also found that the peptide has an important role on morphologies of Mn-Ca oxide. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The device is based on an interdigitated back-contact silicon solar cell, in which the p- and n-regions are connected in a combination of series and parallel contacts, in order to triple the photovoltage compared to a single-junction cell. Our best device provides an open-circuit voltage of 1.99 V, larger than the water redox potential of 1.23 V plus overpotentials at the electrodes, as well as a short-circuit current density of 12.6 mA/cm(2). Coupled to a sulphuric acid electrolysis system, with platinum and ruthenium dioxide electrodes, our device shows an STH of 14.5% at 1.63 V.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0927-0248	1879-3398		WOS:000456640000051

The results show that the NiMoO4 modification changes the morphology of NiO, and the hollow internal morphology combined with porous outer shell of NiO@NiMoO4 and NiO@NiMoO4@PPy hybrids shows an increased specific surface area (SSA), and then promotes the transfer of ions and electrons. The shell of NiMoO4 and PPy with high electronic conductivity decreases the charge-transfer reaction resistance of NiO, and then improves the electrochemical kinetics of NiO. At 20 A g(-1), the initial capacitances of NiO, NiMoO4, NiO@NiMoO4 and NiO@NiMoO4@PPy are 456.0, 803.2, 764.4 and 941.6 F g(-1), respectively. After 10,000 cycles, the corresponding capacitances are 346.8, 510.8, 641.2 and 904.8 F g(-1), respectively. Especially, the initial capacitance of NiO@NiMoO4@PPy is 850.2 F g(-1), and remains 655.2 F g(-1) with a high retention of 77.1% at 30 A g(-1) even after 30,000 cycles. The calculation result based on density function theory shows that the much stronger Mo-O bonds are crucial for stabilizing the NiO@NiMoO4 composite, resulting in a good cycling stability of these materials.

However, their synthesis process retains a large amount of Li residue on the surface, which is a main source of gas generation during operation of the battery. In this study, combined with simulation and experiment, we propose the optimal metal phosphate coating materials for removing residual Li from the surface of the Ni-rich layered oxide cathode material LiNi0.91Co0.06Mn0.03O2. First-principles-based screening process for 16 metal phosphates is performed to identify an ideal coating material that is highly reactive to Li2O. By constructing the phase diagram, we obtain the equilibrium phases from the reaction of coating materials and Li2O, based on a database using a DFT hybrid functional. Experimental verification for this approach is accomplished with Mn-3(PO4)(2), Co-3( PO4)(2), Fe-3(PO4)(2), and TiPO4. The Li-removing capabilities of these materials are comparable to the calculated results. In addition, electrochemical performances up to 50 charge/discharge cycles show that Mn-, Co-, Fe-phosphate materials are superior to an uncoated sample in terms of preventing capacity fading behavior, while TiPO4 shows poor initial capacity and rapid reduction of capacity during cycling. Finally, Li-containing equilibrium phases examined from XRD analysis are in agreement with the simulation results.									48	4	0	0	2	0	50			2045-2322			WOS:000406816300024	28769062

We present a study of alkaline (pH 10-12) springs in the Voltri Massif (Italy) that focuses on the sources and cycling of inorganic carbon in the basement rocks, the interacting fluids, and the resulting surface carbonate deposits. Most springs are located in mantle rocks that underwent varying degrees of ocean-floor serpentinization and incorporation of carbon (as carbonate and organic carbon) in the Jurassic, which is preserved during subsequent subduction and uplift onto the continent.The springs are fed by meteoric water that evolves into alkaline, Ca-rich spring waters that have 2-3 times higher Ca concentrations than the adjacent rivers. Our study is consistent with previous reaction path modeling and identifies the formation of clay minerals in serpentinites that have been altered by alkaline fluids. These strongly altered basement rocks contain up to 2 wt.% C in the shallow subsurface, also documented by the presence of late calcite veins. Concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of the alkaline fluids are generally low (<16 mu mol/L) and delta C-13(DIC) is between -24.2% and + 1.37.0. We argue that the concentrations and isotopic composition of the DIC in the alkaline waters provide evidence for 1) the precipitation of calcium carbonate under closed-system conditions with respect to atmospheric CO2 and 2) removal of DIC by microbial activity in the subsurface. Late-stage uptake of atmospheric CO2 in the shallow subsurface or at the exit sites subsequent to water-rock-microbe interactions in the basement result in fluids with lower pH and Ca, and enrichment in DIC and C-13. At the surface, interaction of the high pH, Ca-OH fluids with atmospheric CO2 causes precipitation of carbonates as travertines or crusts on the basement rocks, storing CO2 as calcium carbonate. Carbonate precipitation at the exit sites is strongly dominated by kinetic processes leading to carbon and oxygen isotope compositions as low as 27.2 parts per thousand and 18.7 parts per thousand, respectively. With increasing distance from the springs, the C-13 and 190 content of the carbonate increases and the fluid pH changes towards neutral. Our study shows that surficial carbonate precipitation plays a subordinate role in carbon sequestration, but that the evolution from Mg-HCO3 spring waters to Ca-OH waters removes significant amounts of carbon, presumably in the subsurface. We calculate that the serpentinites have the capacity to sequester up to 0.50 to 2.05 x 10(9) mol carbon per year and conclude that they can take up significantly more CO2 than they currently contain.

Part I: Ore mineral geochemistry and sulfur isotope study								ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS				40	1			65	80		10.1016/j.oregeorev.2011.05.002				SEP 2011	2011	Pb-Zn-Ag vein and listwaenite types of mineralization in Crnac deposit, Western Vardar zone, were deposited within several stages: (i) the pre-ore stage comprises pyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, quartz, kaolinite and is followed by magnetite-pyrite; (ii) the syn-ore stage is composed of galena, sphalerite, tetrahedrite and stefanite; and (iii) the post-ore stage is composed of carbonates, pyrite, arsenopyrite and minor galena. The vein type mineralization is hosted by Jurassic amphibolites and veins terminate within overlying serpentinites. Mineralized listwaenites are developed along the serpentinite-amphibolite interface. The reserves are estimated to 1.7 Mt of ore containing in average 7.6% lead, 2.9% zinc, and 102 g/t silver. Sulfides from the pre- and syn-mineralization assemblage of the vein- and listwaenite-types of mineralization from the Crnac Pb-Zn-Ag deposit have been analyzed using microprobe, crush-leachates and sulfur isotopes.The pre-ore assemblage precipitated under high sulfur fugacities (f(S-2) = 10(-8)-10(-6) bar) from temperatures ranging between 350 degrees C and 380 degrees C. Most likely water-rock reactions, boiling and/or increase of pH caused an increase of delta S-34 of pyrite toward upper levels within the deposit. The decomposition of pre-ore pyrrhotite to a pyrite-magnetite mixture occurred at a fugacity of sulfur from f(S-2) = 8.7 x 10(-10) to 9.6 x 10(-9) bar and fugacity of oxygen from f(O-2) = 2.4 x 10(-30) to 3.1 x 10(-28) bars, indicating a contribution of an oxidizing fluid, i.e. meteoric water during pre-ore stages of hydrothermal activity. The crystallization temperatures obtained by the sphalerite-galena isotope geothermometer range from 230 to 310 degrees C. The delta S-34 values of pre- and syn-ore sulfides (pyrite, galena, sphalerite, delta S-34 = 0.3-5.9 parts per thousand) point to magmatic sulfur. Values of delta S-34 of galena and sphalerite are decreasing upwards due to precipitation of early formed sulfide minerals. Post-ore assemblage precipitated at temperature below 190 degrees C.Based on data presented above, we assume two fluid sources: (i) a magmatic source, supported by sulfur isotopic compositions within pre- and syn-ore minerals and a high mol% of fluorine found within pre- and syn-ore leachates, and (ii) a meteoric source, deduced by coincident pyrite-magnetite intergrowth, sulfur isotopic trends within syn-ore minerals and decrease of crystallization temperatures from the pre-ore stage (380-350 degrees C), towards the syn-ore (310-215 degrees C) and post-ore stages (<190 degrees C). Post-ore fluids are Na-Ca-Mg-K-Li chlorine rich and were modified via water-rock reactions. Simple mineral assemblage and sphalerite composition range from 1.5 to 10.1 mol% of FeS catalog Crnac to a group of intermediate sulfidation epithermal deposit. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we develop a new type of 3D metalvacancy solid-solution NiAlP nanowall array synthesized by a combination of selective alkali-etching and phosphorization strategies as a highly-active and earth-abundant all-pH bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient overall water splitting. These metal-vacancy NiAl d P nanowall arrays as both the anode and cathode are highly efficient in overall-water-splitting catalysis, realizing 10 mA cm(-2) at quite low cell voltages of 1.50-1.70 V for pH 1/4 0-14. In particular, the NiAl d P nanowall arrays could achieve an outstanding overall water splitting activity in acidic electrolyte (pH 1/4 0) with high turnover frequencies of similar to 11 000 H2 per h and similar to 5000 O2 per h at 50 and 300 mV overpotentials for the HER and OER, respectively, far exceeding those of the best noble-metal-free catalysts and the Pt/C-RuO2 combination.									47	3	0	0	1	0	48			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000433427300011

Ustiloxins are the toxic secondary metabolites of fungus generated from rice false smut disease, which are harmful to animal/human reproduction and growth. However, there are rare researches on the control and reduction of ustiloxins through physical, chemical and biological ways. Herein, we demonstrated that photocatalysis of semiconductor nanomaterials could be as a potential way to degrade or mitigate the contamination of ustiloxin A. A kind of wormlike graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was facilely prepared from modified dicyandiamide precursor via pyrolysis method and characterized by X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy etc. It was found that g-C3N4 from modified dicyandiamide precursor showed better activity for ustiloxin A degradation under visible light irradiation than that of pristine g-C3N4. This was ascribed to the lager specific surface area, more uniform microstructure, better photogenerated charges separation and transformation of wormlike g-C3N4 compared with pristine g-C3N4. Most important, the structure of degradation intermediates and the possible pathway were proposed based on the results of high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry after 80 min photoreaction treatment. Our findings may provide a green, efficient way for ustiloxins mitigation and useful information for future study.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000593794500001	33202563

In order to achieve high photocurrents the surface of BiVO4 always has to be modified with water oxidation catalysts, such as cobalt phosphate (CoPi), FeOOH, or NiFeOx. While this has generally been attributed to the poor intrinsic catalytic activity of BiVO4, detailed insight into the fate of the photogenerated charge carriers at the surface is still lacking. We used intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) to investigate the surface carrier dynamics of bare and CoPi-modified spray-deposited BiVO4 films. Using a model developed by Peter et al., it was possible to distinguish the reaction rate constants for surface recombination and charge transfer to the electrolyte. We found that modification with CoPi reduced the surface recombination of BiVO4 with a factor of 10-20, without significantly influencing the charge transfer kinetics. Control experiments with RuOx, one of the best known OER electrocatalysts, did not affect surface recombination and led to an actual decrease of the photocurrent. These results show that the main role of the CoPi is to passivate the surface of BiVO4 and that, contrary to earlier assumptions, the photocurrent of BiVO4 is limited by surface recombination instead of charge transfer. The importance of surface recombination is well recognized for conventional semiconductors in the field of photovoltaics; these findings show that it may also play a crucial role in oxide-based semiconductors for photoelectrochemical energy conversion.									302	7	0	0	16	0	302			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000400553000049	28580106

The question is how to efficiently manipulate these energy levels. Taking the n-Si Schottky photoanode as a prototype, the undesired donor-like interfacial defects and its adverse effects on charge transfer in n-Si/ITO photoanode are well recognized and diminished through the treatment on electronic energy level. The obtained n-Si/TiOx/ITO Schottky junction exhibits a highly efficient charge transport and a barrier height of 0:95 eV, which is close to the theoretical optimum for n-Si/ITO Schottky contact. Then, the holes extraction can be further facilitated through the variation of surface energy level, with the NiOOH coated ITO layer. This is confirmed by a 115% increase in surface photovoltage of the photoanodes. Eventually, an unprecedentedly low onset potential of 0.9 V (vs RHE) is realized for water oxidation among n Si photoanodes. For the water oxidation reaction, the n-Si/TiOx/ITO/NiOOH photoanode presents a charge separation efficiency up to 100% and an injection efficiency greater than 90% at a wide voltage range. This work identifies the important role of interfacial energetics played in photoelectrochemical conversion.									101	7	0	0	4	0	102			0002-7863			WOS:000385992100036	27653158

Pertaining to this new class of materials are the Li/Na iridate phases, which present a rich crystal chemistry. This work reports on a new protonic iridate phase H3+xIrO4 having a layered structure obtained by room temperature acid-leaching of Li3IrO4. This new phase shows reversible charge storage properties of 1.5 e(-) per Ir atom with high rate capabilities in both nonaqueous (vs Li+/Li) and aqueous (vs capacitive carbon) media. It is demonstrated that Li-insertion in carbonate LiPF6-based electrolyte occurs through a classical reduction process (Ir5+ Ir3+), which is accompanied by a well-defined structural transition. In concentrated H2SO4 electrolyte, this work provides evidence that the overall capacity of 1.7 H+ per Ir results from two additive redox processes with the low potential one showing ohmic limitations. Altogether, the room temperature protonation approach, which can be generalized to various Li-rich phases containing either 3d, 4d or 5d metals, offers great opportunities for the judicious design of attractive electrode materials.									22	1	0	0	2	0	23			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000431613800014

In order to test this model, we have observed and measured bubbles occurring during (100) silicon etching in aqueous KOH solutions. We have confirmed the trends for the average bubble departure radius R-d and average dwell time T-d noted by previous authors under different circumstances: T-d invariably decreases for increasing temperature and concentration and Rd decreases with increasing concentration and flow speed. Two distinct kinds of topography result from the hour long etch. A region that was covered by bubbles looks like a superposition of shallow depressions, with lateral radii comparable to the bubble departure radius and roughness qualitatively consistent with a pseudo-masking model. Therefore the roughness is dominated by the effect of bubbles and determined by bubble parameters if when and where those do occur. A different roughening regime, resulting in hillocks, is reached by decreasing T-d and bubble density (for instance by increasing flow speed). Depending on the etching conditions bubbles do not occur over all the surface being etched, or do not occur at all.

Two types of surface states (i.e. the short- and long-lived surface states) were in situ detected at TiO2 surface. It was demonstrated that the density and response potential of these surface states are two essential factors influencing the recombination process and hence determining the overall photoconversion efficiencies for water splitting. With increasing pH, significant decrease in the estimated surface-state densities was observed at pH around 11-12, which was found well inline with the variation with pH both for the measured apparent recombination probabilities and for the maximum photoconversion efficiencies. For effectively inhibiting the occurrence of surface recombination process, and for obtaining maximum photo-conversion efficiencies, the most suitable Schottky barrier heights were revealed to be 0.9 V at pH <11-12 and 0.7 V at pH > 11. Based on the results of this work, some mechanistic aspects for the water photooxidation at TiO2 surface were revealed and discussed. 2014 The Electrochemical Society.

Herein, an effective and low cost strategy for microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition (CVD) equipment with a modified household microwave oven was implemented to handle micro-porous Co3O4 powder and get high O vacancy electrode active materials. The results show that the morphology, crystal structure and elemental composition of the sample are strongly affected by H-2 plasma. The capacity of the etched micro-porous Co3O4 powder is about 128 Fg(-1) after 4000 cycles, which is 3.5 times larger than that of the origin powder. The performance improvement mechanism of the plasma etch was also confirmed. The results show that microwave plasma etching can effectively improve the performance of Co3O4 capacitor materials due to O vacancy increasing and the ratio of Co2+/Co3+ changing, which will benefit other kinds of oxide semiconductor electrode materials.

Signatures of selection, such as specific changes in the frequency of alleles and haplotypes, as well as the reduction or increase in genetic diversity, help to identify changes in the cattle genome in response to natural and artificial selection, as well as loci and genetic variants directly affecting adaptive and economically important traits. Advances in genetics and biotechnology enable a rapid transfer of unique genetic variants that have originated in local cattle breeds in the process of adaptation to local environments into the genomes of cosmopolitan high-performance breeds, in order to preserve their outstanding performance in new environments. It is also possible to use genomic selection approach to increase the frequency of already present adaptive alleles in cosmopolitan breeds. The review examines recent work on the origin and evolution of Turano-Mongolian cattle breeds, adaptation of Turano-Mongolian cattle to extreme environments, and summarizes available information on potential candidate genes for climate adaptation of Turano-Mongolian breeds, including cold resistance genes, immune response genes, and high-altitude adaptation genes. The authors conclude that the current literature data do not provide preference to one of the two possible scenarios of Turano-Mongolian breed origins: as a result of the domestication of a wild aurochs at East Asia or as a result of the migration of taurine proto-population from the Middle East. Turano-Mongolian breeds show a high degree of adaptation to extreme climatic conditions (cold, heat, lack of oxygen in the highlands) and parasites (mosquitoes, ticks, bacterial and viral infections). As a result of high-density genotyping and sequencing of genomes and transcriptomes, prospective candidate genes and genetic variants involved in adaptation to environmental factors have recently been identified.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2500-0462	2500-3259		WOS:000645919300007	34901717

The photocatalysis system adapted to oxidation of small molecular pyridine and thiophene for fuels in the ambient air without adding extra H(2)O(2 )or pure O-2 oxidants. Structural and photoelectric properties of the photocatalysts were characterized and compared. In an optimal composite, g-C3N4 nanosheets were successfully intercalated by Ti3C2 layers to form an interfacial effect and heterojunction. Intercalation effect accelerated the photogenerated electrons transferring from g-C3N4 to Ti3C2 , and inhibited the recombination of electron-hole pairs. Ti3C2/g-C3N4 composite exhibited enhanced photocatalytic performance, high mineralization efficiency, and good recyclability in the removal of pyridine and thiophene. Mechanism and DFT studies proposed that the holes acted as the major active species for the photocatalysis procedures to form the reactant intermediates, while the electrons and O-2 generated superoxide radicals provided a promotion effect on the final conversions.									54	1	0	0	12	0	55			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000532683200068

Unlike yeast or mammalian N-recognin E3 ligases, which each recognize several different classes of Nt residues, in Arabidopsis thaliana, N-recognin functions of different N-degron pathways are carried out independently by PROTEOLYSIS (PRT)1, PRT6, and other unknown proteins. PRT1 recognizes type 2 aromatic Nt-destabilizing residues and PRT6 recognizes type 1 basic residues. These two N-recognin functions diverged as separate proteins early in the evolution of plants, before the conquest of the land. We demonstrate that loss of PRT1 function promotes the plant immune system, as mutant prt1-1 plants showed greater apoplastic resistance than WT to infection by the bacterial hemi-biotroph Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pst) DC3000. Quantitative proteomics revealed increased accumulation of proteins associated with specific components of plant defense in the prt1-1 mutant, concomitant with increased accumulation of salicylic acid. The effects of the prt1 mutation were additional to known effects of prt6 in influencing the immune system, in particular, an observed over-accumulation of pipecolic acid (Pip) in the double-mutant prt1-1 prt6-1. These results demonstrate a potential role for PRT1 in controlling aspects of the plant immune system and suggest that PRT1 limits the onset of the defense response via degradation of substrates with type 2 Nt-destabilizing residues.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8				2475-4455		WOS:000505500100004	31891113

Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)				610				419	34		10.1007/978-1-60327-029-8_25				2010	2010	Oxidative stress is a key factor involved in the development and progression of Alzheimer disease (AD), and it is well documented that free radical oxidative damage, particularly of neuronal lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and sugars, is extensive in brains of AD patients. The complex chemistry of peroxynitrite has been the subject of intense study and is now evident that there are two principal pathways for protein modification: the first one involves homolytic hydroxyl radical-like chemistry that results in protein-based carbonyls and the second involves electrophilic nitration of vulnerable side chains, in particular the electron-rich aromatic rings of Tyr and Trp. In the presence of buffering bicarbonate, peroxynitrite forms a CO(2) adduct, which augments its reactivity. Formation of 3-nitrotyrosine by this route has become the classical protein marker specifically for the presence of peroxynitrite. Protein-based carbonyls can be detected by two methods: (i) derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) and detection of the protein-bound hydrazones using an enzyme-linked anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl antibody and (ii) derivatization with biotin-hydrazide and detection of the protein-bound acyl hydrazone with enzyme-linked avidin or streptavidin. Glycation of proteins by reducing sugars (Maillard reaction) results in a profile of time-dependent adduct evolution rendering susceptibility to oxidative elaboration. In addition, oxidative stress can result in oxidized sugar derivatives which can subsequently modify protein through a process known as glycoxidation. Of more general importance, oxidative stress results in lipid peroxidation and the production of a range of electrophilic and mostly bifunctional aldehydes that modify numerous proteins. The more important protein modifications are referred to as advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and advanced lipoxidation end products (ALEs). Protein modification can result in both non-cross-link and cross-link AGEs and ALEs, the latter arising from the potential bifunctional reactivity, such as that of the lipid-derived modifiers 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Oxidative damage to nucleic acids results in base modification, substitutions, and deletions. Among the most common modifications, 8-hydroxyguanosine (8OHG) is considered a signature of oxidative damage to nucleic acid.Cells are not passive to increased oxygen radical production but rather upregulate protective responses. In neurodegenerative diseases, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction is coincident with the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. This enzyme that converts heme, a prooxidant, to biliverdin/bilirubin (antioxidants) and free iron has been considered an antioxidant enzyme. But seen in the context of arresting apoptosis, HO-1 and tau may play a role in maintaining the neurons free from the apoptotic signal (cytochrome c), since tau has strong iron-binding sites. Given the importance of iron as a catalyst for the generation of reactive oxygen species, changes in proteins associated with iron homeostasis can be used as an index of cellular responses. One such class of proteins is the iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) that respond to cellular iron concentrations by regulating the translation of proteins involved in iron uptake, storage, and utilization. Therefore, IRPs are considered to be the central control components of cellular iron concentration.									48	8	0	0	41	1	55				1940-6029		MEDLINE:20013193	20013193

To obtain an adhesive with high temperature bond strength and low synthesis temperature, polysilazane (PSNB) was modified by PBSZ, PSO, nano-Al2O3 additives. Effect of the SiO2 to B2O3 ratio and curing pressure on microstructure and high temperature bond strength has been investigated. After curing and heat-treating at comparatively lower temperatures, the bond strength of the modified adhesive reached up to 12.08 MPa, at room temperature, and, more significantly, retained the strength of 6.65 MPa at 1000 degrees C. The bond strength of modified adhesive is two-times higher than pure PSNB adhesive at elevated temperature. We demonstrate that optimum level of fluidity and applied pressure should be established in order to attain maximum bond strength. This paper open up avenues for further research in modifying existing adhesives for high temperature applications.									12	6	0	0	0	0	16			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000428974300147

Here, by using density functional theory calculations, the catalytic activity enhancements from B decoration and the oxidation of black and blue phosphorene for N-2 fixation photo-catalysis are predicted. The results show that the computed overpotentials (eta(NRR)) were 0.78 and 0.92 V through the end-on configuration of the B doped black phosphorene (B-BlP) and blue phosphorene (B-BeP), respectively. In addition, owing to the reduction of the band gap, decoration with B can greatly enhance the visible light and infrared light harvesting of BlP and BeP, guaranteeing them as ideal potential materials for the visible light reduction of N-2. The formation energy of B decoration and the ab initio molecular dynamics simulation results indicate that B-BlP and B-BeP are highly stable under ambient conditions (300 K). The oxidation of the BlP and BeP surfaces can also enhance the N-2 reduction reaction (NRR) performances using visible light driving, with the eta(NRR) values being 1.31 and 1.51 V through the end-on and side-on configurations, respectively. In summary, this work offers the opportunity for decorated phosphorene to act as a photo-catalyst for NH3 production.									13	2	0	0	1	0	13			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000498220500017	31681931

A metal-organic cage (MOC) Pd-2(M-4)(4)(BF4)(4), denoted as MOC-Q1, integrating four organic photosensitized ligands M-4 and two Pd2+ catalytic centers is designed for a photochemical molecular device (PMD). MOC-Q1 is successfully immobilized on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) by hydrogen bonds to obtain a robust heterogeneous direct Z-scheme g-C3N4/MOC-Q1 photocatalyst for H-2 generation under visible light. The optimized g-C3N4/MOC-Q1 (2 wt %) system shows high hydrogen evolution activity (4495 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) based on the catalyst mass) and exhibits stable performances for 25 h (a turnover number of 19,268 based on MOC-Q1), significantly outperforming pure MOC-Q1, g-C3N4, and comparsion materials Pd/g-C3N4/M-4, which is the highest one of all reported heterogeneous MOC-based photocatalysts under visible irradiation. This enhancement can be ascribed to the synergistic effects of high-efficient electron transfer, extended visible-light response region, and good protective environment for MOC-Q1 arising from an efficient direct Z-scheme heterostructure of g-C3N4/MOC-Q1. This rationally designed and synthesized MOC/g-C3N4-based heterogeneous PMD is expected to have great potential in photocatalytic water splitting.									15	3	0	0	0	0	15			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000662086600036	34036785

The fine hierarchical butterfly wing structures of BVOB@xC were confirmed by the SEM and TEM observations. The doped carbon in BVOB@xC was formed in situ from the biotemplate during a calcination process and the amount of doping could be controlled from 0.6-2.4 wt% by adjusting the calcination temperature. It was found that the sample calcined at 400 degrees C with a carbon content of 1.5 wt% (BVOB@1.5C) demonstrated the best photocatalytic activity in both photocatalytic degradation and O-2 evolution from water splitting (ca. 800 mu mol L-1). Under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm), the photocatalytic O-2 evolution from BVOB@1.5C (ca. 800 mu mol L-1, after 5 h) is 16 times higher than that of pure BiVO4 powder (BVOP) (ca. 49 mu mol L-1), and the photocatalytic decomposition efficiency of MB for BVOB@1.5C is 6.3 times higher than that of pure BVOP. The improved photocatalytic performance is attributed to the synergetic effect of the unique morphology and composition control. It is believed that the hierarchical butterfly wing structures of BVOB@1.5C contribute significantly to the absorption enhancement under visible light (480 to 700 nm), which was supported by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance measurements. The photocatalytic performance was further enhanced by the C-doping as it improves the efficient separation and transfer of the photogenerated electrons and holes, as evidenced by the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. This strategy provides a simple one-step method to fabricate a high-performance photocatalyst, which enables the simultaneous control of the crystal phase, morphology, and carbon element doping.									131	17	0	0	12	0	142			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000321310200010

MSnO2-H has been fabricated by dropping SnCl4 ethanol solution on hematite nanoflakes homogeneously grown over the conductive FTO glass substrate and annealed at 500 degrees C to synthesize the SnO2 nanoparticles on hematite NFs. The Sn-treated samples were then placed in a furnace again, and the sintering process was conducted at 800 degrees C for 15 min. During this step, structure deformation of hematite occurs normally due to the grain boundary motion and oriented attachment. However, in the case of MSnO2-H, the outer SnO2 nanoparticles efficiently prevented a shape deformation and maintained the nanoflake shape owing to the encapsulation of hematite NFs. Furthermore, the interface of hematite/SnO2 nanoparticles became the spots for a heavy Sn ion doping. We demonstrated the generation of the newly localized states, resulting in an extension of the photoresponse of hematite until 800 nm wavelength light irradiation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SnO2 nanoparticles can effectively act as a passivation layer, which can reduce the onset potential of hematite for water splitting redox reactions. The optimized MSnO2-H nanostructures showed a 2.84 times higher photocurrent density and 300 mV reduced onset potential compared with a pristine hematite nanoflake photoanode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1343			WOS:000861239600001	36211042

Metal nitrides have recently been paid a significant interest as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors (SCs) owing to their high electrical conductivity, excellent redox properties, and outstanding mechanical strength. However, poor electrochemical stability seriously limits the commercialization possibilities. Herein, a novel strategy is presented for the synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene encapsulated with ultrasmall nickel-cobalt nitride (NiCo2N) and nickel-iron nitride (NiFeN) core-shell architectures that are explored as advanced electrodes for flexible solid-state SC. The flexible NiCo2N@NG//NiFeN@NG asymmetric SC delivers an ultrahigh energy density of approximate to 94.93 Wh kg(-1) at 0.79 kW kg(-1), exceptional power density (approximate to 74.67 Wh kg(-1) at 39.53 kW kg(-1)), and ultralong cycle life (approximate to 5.07% drop in initial capacity after 25 000 cycles). These results promote the core-shell hybrids that can be served as advanced supercapacitor materials for flexible energy storage applications.									161	4	0	0	8	0	162			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000450367700002

Results indicated that Al species including monomeric species (Al-a), medium polymer species (Al-b), and colloidal or solid species (Al-c) in polyaluminum chlorides (PACIs) played significant role. At lower doses ranged from 5 to 20 mg/L, floc breakage damaged Al-a-NOM bonds for AlCl3, causing obvious release of DOM and dissolved Al. After re-growth, dissolved Al mainly connected with broken flocs, rather than released DOM. Thus, after re-growth, DOM release was still remarkable, but additional removal of dissolved Al was observed. At higher doses above 20 mg/L, more Al-a transformed to Al-b and Al-c. Due to the enmeshment effect induced by Al-c coagulation, fewer DOM and dissolved Al were released after breakage, and additional removal of DOM and dissolved Al were attained after re-growth. For PACl(Al13) in which mainly contained Al-b, at optimal dose, floc breakage generated the most severe release of DOM and dissolved Al, while the result after re-growth was just reverse. This was ascribed to stronger charge neutralization ability of Al-b. Furthermore, the influence of floc breakage and re-growth on DOM and dissolved Al for PACl(C) was similar to that for AlCl3. The reason was fully analyzed in this research. This study may give further indication regarding reaction mechanisms of floc breakage and re-growth for PACls. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

First published March 16, 2010; doi:10.1152/physiolgenomics.00015.2010.-Vertebrate mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) possesses 10 nuclear-encoded subunits. Six subunits have paralogs in mammals, but the origins and distribution of isoforms among vertebrates have not been analyzed. We used Bayesian phylogenetic analysis to interpret the origins of each subunit, inferring the roles of gene and genome duplications. The paralogous ancestries of five genes were identical throughout the major vertebrate taxa: no paralogs of COX6c and COX7c, two paralogs of COX4 and COX6a, and three paralogs of COX7a. Two genes had an extra copy in teleosts (COX5a, COX5b), and three genes had additional copies in mammals (COX6b, COX7b, COX8). Focusing on early vertebrates, we examined structural divergence and explored transcriptional profiles across zebrafish tissues. Quantitative transcript profiles revealed dramatic differences in transcript abundance for different subunits. COX7b and COX4 transcripts were typically present at very low levels, whereas COX5a and COX8 were in vast excess in all tissues. For genes with paralogs, two general patterns emerged. For COX5a and COX8, there was ubiquitous expression of one paralog, with the other paralog in lower abundance in all tissues. COX4 and COX6a shared a distinct expression pattern, with one paralog dominant in brain and gills and the other in muscles. The isoform profiles in combination with phylogenetic analyses show that vertebrate COX isoform patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that early whole genome duplications in basal vertebrates governed the isoform repertoire in modern fish and tetrapods, though more recent lineage-specific gene/genome duplications also play a role in select subunits.									26	1	0	0	25	0	27			1094-8341	1531-2267		WOS:000278212700007	20233836

An approach for landfills in operation (Southern Italy)								WASTE MANAGEMENT				77				156	165		10.1016/j.wasman.2018.05.014				JUL 2018	2018	Where the unique natural water resource is groundwater, the attention and the susceptibility of local communities and authorities to groundwater quality degradation risks can be so high to determine relevant problems to waste management, especially for landfills in operation or to be realised. A multi methodological approach was suggested with the purpose to clarify the role of landfill leakage on groundwater quality degradation.The selected study area (SSA) hosts some landfills in a narrow portion of a wide and deep coastal karstic aquifer, for these characteristics to be considered a case of high hydrogeological complexity and vulnerability. News concerning nitrate and secondly iron groundwater concentration anomalously high caused concern in the population and strong local opposition to landfills.The multi-methodological approach includes: the hydrogeological site characterization; the chemical study and the multi-isotope characterization of groundwater and leachate; the land use analysis and the estimation of nitrogen contributions deriving from fertilizers; the mineralogical study of groundwater suspended particles to define the role of natural soil substances.The hydrogeological site characterisation highlighted the local peculiarities of the aquifer. The chemical study was used to define geochemical features, groundwater and leachate characteristics and their macroscopic mixing.The environmental isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen were used to investigate the groundwater origin, the most relevant geochemical reactions, the existence of groundwater-leachate mixing, and the sources of anthropogenic NO3-. The land use analysis highlighted quantity and type of used fertilizers permitting to compare these with groundwater in terms of isotopic signature. The mineralogical study demonstrated the role of suspend natural particles due the presence of terre rosse (red or residual soils) in groundwater.The approach confirmed that there are not the groundwater quality degradation effects of landfills, contributing to reassure population and institutions, simplifying the waste management.

Developing a facile and scalable 2D material/hybrid synthesis strategy is still a big challenge. Herein, a top-down corrosion strategy is developed to prepare ultrathin cobalt (oxy)-hydroxide nanosheets decorated with ultrasmall (similar to 1.6 nm) alloy NPs. The formation of ultrathin (oxy)hydroxide nanosheets has a restrain effect to prevent the growth of small NPs into bigger ones. Thanks to the ultrathin 2D nature and strong electronic interaction between Co(OH)(2) and alloy NPs, the Pt-based binary alloy NPs are greatly stabilized by the Co(OH)(2) nanosheets and the hybrids exhibit much enhanced electrocatalytic performance for water splitting. Especially, the mass activities of the PtPd- and PtCu-decorated samples for hydrogen evolution are similar to 8 times that of Pt/C. When used as both cathode and anode electrocatalysts to split water, the hybrid nanosheets outperform the commercial Pt/C-RuO2 combination. At 10 mA cm(-2), the needed potential is only 1.53 V. This work provides us a highly controllable and scalable means to produce clean 2D nanomaterials decorated with a series of alloy NPs such as PtPd, PtCu, AuNi, and so forth.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000466052800025	30932466

It is demonstrated here that the exposure of PSII membranes to heat stress (40 A degrees C) results in HOaEuro cent formation, as monitored by the formation of EMPO-OH adduct EPR signal. The presence of different exogenous halides significantly suppressed the EMPO-OH adduct EPR signal in PSII membranes under heat stress. The addition of exogenous acetate and blocker of chloride channel suppressed the EMPO-OH adduct EPR signal, whereas the blocker of calcium channel did not affect the EMPO-OH adduct EPR signal. Heat-induced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production was studied by amplex red fluorescent assay. The presence of exogenous halides, acetate and chloride blocker showed the suppression of H2O2 production in PSII membranes under heat stress. Based on our results, it is proposed that the formation of HOaEuro cent under heat stress is linked to uncontrolled accessibility of water to the water-splitting manganese complex caused by the release of chloride ion on the electron donor side of PSII. Uncontrolled water accessibility to the water-splitting manganese complex causes the formation of H2O2 due to improper water oxidation, which leads to the formation of HOaEuro cent via the Fenton reaction under heat stress.									13	1	0	0	12	0	14			0145-479X	1573-6881		WOS:000304613700009	22466970

Two different fluorine contents, 3 and 6 wt %, were used for this study and fluorine was added by direct exchange for oxygen (F2O-1). Melting relations in this system differ greatly from those of the F-free system due to the presence of a large liquidus field for fluorphlogopite (Phl), the size of which correlates with the amount of F in the system. The locations of most invariant points are very similar for these different F-contents except for the reaction points Fo + L <----> En + Phl and En + L <----> Qz + Phl. For both F-contents there are two eutectic points: one on the silica-side at a melt composition of Qz(67)Ks(32)Fo(1) coexists with San, Qz and Phl at 850 degrees C, and one on the kalsilite-side of the join San-Fo, where a melt of composition Qz(12)Ks(75)Fo(13) coexists with Ks, Lc and Phl at 1225 degrees C. The composition of the first eutectic point moves towards lower SiO2- contents at increasing pressures (Qz(59)Ks(75)Fo(1) at 18 kbar), whereas the second disappears at 10 kbar for 6 wt % F and 18 kbar for 3 wt % F due to the absence of Lc as a stable liquidus phase at high pressures. We observe a new eutectic point San + Ks + Phl + L (Qz(31)Ks(66)Fo(3) at 10 kbar) for which the location is determined approximately at 18 kbar. The eutectic point San + Qz + Phl + L and the reaction point Qz + Phl <----> En + L (for which equilibrium temperatures lie between 1150 degrees C at atmospheric pressure and 1250 degrees C at 18 kbar) represent model assemblages for melting processes in crustal rocks. The location of the reaction point Qz + Phl <----> En + L varies from Qz(72)Ks(26)F(o2) at 1 bar through Qz(68)Ks(28)Fo(4) at 10kbar to Qz(67)Ks(30)Fo(3) at 18 kbar; with 3 wt % F, and from Qz(76)Ks(20)Fo(4) at 1 bar through Qz(71)Ks(26)Fo(3) at 10kbar to Qz(67)Ks(30)Fo(3) at 18 kbar with 6 wt % F.Liquids which coexist with mafic minerals such as En, Fo and Phi are important for understanding the genesis of potassium rich rocks by partial melting of mantle rocks and their subsequent evolution by fractionation. The peritectic point Fo + En + Phl + L shows large variations in equilibrium liquid composition and temperature for the two different F-contents and pressures (Qz(19)Ks(37)Fo(14) at 1250 degrees C and atmospheric pressure, Qz(18)Ks(46)Fo(26) at 1390 degrees C and 18 kbar for 3 wt % F; Qz(42)Ks(19)Fo(39) al 1295 degrees C and atmospheric pressure, Qz(22)Ks(30)Fo(48) at > 1390 degrees C at 18 kbar for 6 wt % F). Melts produced at this point have lower SiO2-contents and evolve to more SiO2-poor compositions by fractional crystallization than in the H2O-bearing system at comparable pressures. F-Phl varies considerably in chemical composition and the Si-content of Phl correlates positively with the Si-content of the melt.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0077-7757			WOS:A1996VQ98500001

Herein, a novel hierarchical Ni3S2/VS4 nanohorn array grown on nickel foam (NS-horn/NF) is prepared by a self-driven synthesis strategy. We demonstrate that in-situ generation of VS4 in the NS-horn/NF not only triggers the formation of such unique hierarchical architecture, but favors the graft of enriched active bridging S-2(2-) on the strong coupling interface between Ni3S2 and VS4, and thus the enhanced HER kinetics. More importantly, the abundant active nickel oxides for the OER availably form on the interface benefiting from the surface reconstruction of NS-horn/NF due to the partial leaching of vanadium (IV) of VS4, which promotes the adsorption of OH(-)and leads to the fast OER rate-determining step in alkaline media. When employed to assemble an alkaline electrolyzer as both anode and cathode, NS-horn/NF electrode only needs a small voltage of 1.57 V to yield 10 mA cm(-2) and retains this activity for at least 70 h. Our findings put forward fresh insights into the rational design of highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts toward water spitting for next-generation energy conversion and storage devices.									73	5	0	0	4	0	75			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000480669500026

RR, RV, RRPh1, RRPh2 and Ph inhibit ATP synthesis and electron flow from water to MV (basal, phosphorylating and uncoupled) as their concentration increases, thus, they act as a Hill reaction inhibitor. They inhibit uncoupled electron transport through PSII from water to DCPIP and partially from DPC to DCPIP. However, these compounds do not affect uncoupled PSI electron transport from DCPIP to MV. Therefore, the target of interaction is at the level of OEC and the span P-680 to Q(A) for RR, RRPh1 and RRPh2. Chlorophyll a fluorescence studies corroborate the already found interference sites and may affect the disconnection between chlorophyll molecules within the LHCII and/or between antennae and RCs, or decreases the exciton to reach the RC and inhibition of PSII occurs. RRPh2 is six times more active than RR. Finally, Ph inhibits electron flow interacting at the level of Q(B). (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Molecular understanding of these processes needs, however, a model system with preferably low structural and morphological complexity. This goal is partly accomplished here by using single crystalline Ru(0001) as a template on which hydrous RuO2 is electrochemically formed. The hydrous RuO2 layers on Ru(0001) and their temperature induced transformation under ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions are comprehensively characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. The hydrous RuO2 layer grows with an intricate morphology governed by the presence of step bunching regions of the Ru(0001) surface. Upon annealing to 200 degrees C in UHV the hydrous RuO2 layer transforms mostly into flat metallic Ru islands and occasionally into (100) and (111) oriented RuO2 particles aligned along the high symmetry direction of Ru(0001).									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000381815000014	27009374

In this article, the recent progress in the fabrications and applications of sterically continuous porous graphene with designable microstructures, chemistries, and properties for energy storage and conversion are reviewed. Both template-based and template-free methods have been developed to synthesize the 3D continuously porous graphene, which typically has the microstructure reminiscent of pseudo-periodic minimal surfaces. The 3D graphene can well preserve the properties of 2D graphene of being highly conductive, surface abundant, and mechanically robust, together with unique 2D electronic behaviors. Additionally, the bicontinuous porosity and large curvature offer new functionalities, such as rapid mass transport, ample open space, mechanical flexibility, and tunable electric/thermal conductivity. Particularly, the 3D curvature provides a new degree of freedom for tailoring the catalysis and transport properties of graphene. The 3D graphene with those extraordinary properties has shown great promises for a wide range of applications, especially for energy conversion and storage. This article overviews the recent advances made in addressing the challenges of developing 3D continuously porous graphene, the benefits and opportunities of the new materials for energy-related applications, and the remaining challenges that warrant future study.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000760888500001	34870863

These results are correlated with spectroelectrochemical measurements of Co-II oxidation to Co-III in a CoPi/FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide) electrode during dark electrocatalytic water oxidation. Electrocatalytic water oxidation exhibits a non-linear dependence on Co-III density, with a sharp onset at 1 x 10(17) Co-III cm(-2). These results are compared quantitatively with the degree of CoPi oxidation observed under conditions of photoinduced water oxidation on CoPi-BiVO4 photoanodes. For the CoPi-BiVO4 photoanodes studied herein, <= 5% of water oxidation proceeds from CoPi sites, making the BiVO4 surface the predominant water oxidation site. This study highlights two key factors that limit the ability of CoPi to improve the catalytic performance of BiVO4 : 1) the kinetics of hole transfer from the BiVO4 to the CoPi layer are too slow to effectively compete with direct water oxidation from BiVO4; 2) the slow water oxidation kinetics of CoPi result in a large accumulation of Co-III states, causing an increase in recombination. Addressing these factors will be essential for improving the performance of CoPi on photoanodes for solar-driven water oxidation.									134	2	0	0	9	0	136			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000380888600017

We investigate the production and distribution of energetic carbon atoms and the impacts on the total global hot carbon loss from dominant photochemical processes at five different cases: AL (aphelion and low solar activity), EL (equinox and low solar activity), EH (equinox and high solar activity), PL (perihelion and low solar activity), and PH (perihelion and high solar activity). We compare our results with previously published results but only on the limited cases due to the dearth of studies on solar EUV flux and seasonal variabilities. Photodissociation of CO and dissociative recombination of CO+ are generally regarded as the two most important source reactions for the production of hot atomic carbon. Of these two, photodissociation of CO is found to be the dominant source in all cases considered. To describe self-consistently the exosphere and the upper thermosphere, a 3-D kinetic particle simulator, the Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator, and the 3-D Mars Thermosphere General Circulation Model are one-way coupled. The basic description of this hot carbon calculation can be found in the companion paper to this one. The spatial distributions and profiles of density and temperature and atmospheric loss rates are discussed for the cases considered. Finally, our computed global escape rate of hot carbon ranges from 5.28x10(23)s(-1) (AL) to 55.1x10(23)s(-1) (PL).									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2169-9097	2169-9100		WOS:000348453000005

Beyond graphene, the emerging 2D-material-derived electrocatalysts (2D-ECs) have aroused great attention as one of the best candidates for heterogeneous electrocatalysis. The tunable physicochemical compositions and characteristics of 2D-ECs enable rational structural engineering at the molecular/atomic levels to meet the requirements of different catalytic applications. Due to the lack of instructive and comprehensive reviews, here, the most recent advances in the nanostructure and catalytic center design and the corresponding structure-function relationships of emerging 2D-ECs are systematically summarized. First, the synthetic pathways and state-of-the-art strategies in the multifaceted structural engineering and catalytic center design of 2D-ECs to promote their electrocatalytic activities, such as size and thickness, phase and strain engineering, heterojunctions, heteroatom doping, and defect engineering, are emphasized. Then, the representative applications of 2D-ECs in electrocatalytic fields are depicted and summarized in detail. Finally, the current breakthroughs and primary challenges are highlighted and future directions to guide the perspectives for developing 2D-ECs as highly efficient electrocatalytic nanoplatforms are clarified. This review provides a comprehensive understanding to engineer 2D-ECs and may inspire many novel attempts and new catalytic applications across broad fields.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000750395900001	35102688

Volcanism cycles greenhousegasses into the atmosphere. Tectonics creates weatherable topography, and weathering reactions draw greenhousegasses out of the atmosphere. Weathering depends on physical processes governed partly by surface temperature, which allows for the potential that climate-tectonic coupling can buffer the surface conditions of a planet in a manner that allows liquid water to exist over extended timescales (a condition that allows a planet to be habitable by life as we know it). We discuss modeling efforts to explore the level to which climate-tectonic coupling can or cannot regulate the surface temperature of a planet over geologic time. Thematically, we focus on how coupled climate-tectonic systems respond to the following: (1) changes in the mean pace of tectonics and associated variations in mantle melting and volcanism, (2) large-amplitude fluctuations about mean properties such as mantle temperature and surface plate velocities, and (3) changes in tectonic mode. We consider models that map the conditions under which plate tectonics can or cannot provide climate buffering as well as models that explore the potential that alternate tectonic modes can provide a level of climate buffering that allows liquid water to be present at a planet's surface over geological timescales. We also discuss the possibility that changes in the long-term climate state of a planet can feedback into the coupled system and initiate changes in tectonic mode.									25	1	0	0	3	0	25			2169-9097	2169-9100		WOS:000387795800002

Here, an industrial laser system is utilized to prepare electrocatalysts in a continuous fashion using a laser-induced-forward-transfer-assisted nanomaterial preparation (LANP) method without generating liquid wastes. This dry processing method at room temperature and under ambient pressure enables the production of well-dispersed Pt, Ru, and Ni nanoparticles (NPs) supported on a few-layer graphene carbon framework. This versatile LANP procedure allows for the efficient deposition of binder-free Pt, Ru, and Ni NPs onto flexible polyimide films and glass surfaces at a rate of 400 mm/s. The size and quantity of the spherical NPs present on the conductive carbon surface can be tuned by adjusting the LANP parameters such as the laser power, the scribing speed, and the source thickness. Upon increasing the laser power, the size of Pt NPs decreases and the amount of Pt in the laser-derived materials increases. A second laser treatment can further modulate the hydrophilicity and solvent accessibility of graphene-supported Pt NPs. Our results demonstrate that the binder-free Pt, Ru, and Ni NPs supported on a few-layer graphene generated using the LANP strategy can serve as practical, active, and robust electrocatalysts for water-splitting reactions in advanced electrolyzer technology.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000489678800046

The prepared Co-Pi/BFO thin film is composed of irregular rhombohedral BFO nanoparticles which are uniformly covered with a layer of amorphous Co-Pi, and the corresponding PEC performance is remarkably improved with a negatively-shifted onset potential from -0.058 V (BFO) to -0.130 V (Co-Pi/BFO). The photocurrent density of Co-Pi/BFO thin film photoanode measured at 0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) under visible light irradiation is as high as similar to 0.050 mA cm(-2) (nearly 8 times that of the prepared BFO thin film photoanode), which rivals or exceeds those of state-of-the-art BFO-based thin film photoelectrodes. On the basis of PEC measurement results, the enhanced PEC performance of Co-Pi/BFO photoanode can be attributed to the higher carrier concentration, the more efficient separation and transfer process of photogenerated charges and the lower electron/hole recombination probability induced by Co-Pi cocatalyst. In addition, the possible PEC mechanism of the Co-Pi/BFO photoanode is also discussed. The present work validates the feasibility of Co-Pi cocatalysts coupled with other photoanode systems for pursuing highly efficient PEC performances of water oxidation.

The morphologies, crystalline structure, electronic states, optical behaviors, and photoelectrochemical characteristics of the CuWO4 nanomaterial were examined by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and impedance spectroscopy, showing that the formed triclinic CuWO4 nanoparticles had an indirect band gap of 2.2 eV and strong response to visible light. The cobalt phosphate (CoPi) nanoscale thin film, which was used as a co-catalyst, was electrodeposited on the CuWO4 surface. The photocurrent of the cobalt phosphate complex-catalyzed CuWO4 electrodes exhibited an 86% higher photocurrent response than that of the unmodified CuWO4 nanoparticles under the irradiation of one simulated sun (100 mWcm(-2)). The kinetics of this photoelectrochemical water splitting process was further investigated, and it was found that a more negative flat band potential and reduced charge transfer resistance were likely the primary reasons behind the enhancement.									20	1	0	0	3	0	20			2196-0216			WOS:000423803900016		
J	Liu Zhiming; Liu Guoliang; Hong Xinlin								Influence of Surface Defects and Palladium Deposition on the Activity of CdS Nanocrystals for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production								ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA				35	2			215	222		10.3866/PKU.WHXB201803061				2019	2019	The development of the photocatalytic production of hydrogen from water splitting has attracted immense attention in recent years. CdS is a potential photocatalyst with a visible light response, though it still suffers from a limited activity for hydrogen production due to the fast recombination of photo-induced electron/hole pairs and the low reaction rate of hydrogen evolution on the surface. Studies on the effect of CdS surface structure and properties on hydrogen production are still very limited. In this work, we prepared three CdS nanocrystals with different morphologies: long rod, short rod, and triangular plate. The prepared samples were well characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS). From the results of TEM, XRD and XPS, we find that the three CdS nanocrystals with different morphologies were successfully synthesized. From the PL spectra, we conclude that the area of exposed nonpolar surface and degree of surface defects increase with an increase in aspect ratio. We also performed the photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction using the three CdS crystals. Long rod-like CdS (lr-CdS) exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity, with a hydrogen production rate of 482 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1), which is 2.6 times that of short rod-like CdS (sr-CdS) (183 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1)) and 8.8 times that of triangular plate-like CdS (tp-CdS, 55 mu mol h(-1).g(-1)). It is found that lr-CdS shows a higher hydrogen production rate than sr-CdS and tp-CdS. We find that the hydrogen production rate is related to the degree of surface defects. Surface defects can trap the photo-induced electrons/holes, thus decreasing their probability of recombination. In addition, these defects can be used to anchor Pd particles to form a heterojunction structure that facilitates the separation of photo-induced charges. Therefore, we also compared three CdS/Pd nanocrystals synthesized with the three abovementioned morphologies with respect to hydrogen production. With 1% (w, mass fraction) Pd, the hydrogen production rate was greatly enhanced compared to all the CdS catalysts. Compared to the unpromoted CdS, the reaction rate is enhanced 43.1, 10.7 and 6.0 times over those of sr-CdS, lr-CdS and tp-CdS, respectively. Notably, the hydrogen production rate with short rod-like CdS/Pd reaches 7884 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1), which can be favorably compared with the ever-increasing values reported in the literature. Hopefully, this work provides knowledge on the effect of crystal surface structure and properties on photocatalysis.									28	4	0	0	1	0	28			1000-6818			WOS:000443638100014

The morphology and phase composition of NiCo2S4/NF are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As expected, in the following electrocatalytic measurement, the binder-free, self-made NiCo2S4/NF electrode exhibits much higher catalytic activity, lower onset potential, better stability and greater tolerance towards urea electrooxidation compared with the Ni3S2/NF electrode synthesized under the same reaction conditions. The NiCo2S4/NF electrode delivers a current density of 720 mA cm(-2) at 0.18 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a solution containing 5 mol L-1 KOH and 0.33 mol L-1 urea. The impressive electrocatalytic activity of the NiCo2S4/NF catalyst is largely ascribed to its distinctive structure, which exposes more electrochemical active sites at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Besides, the high intrinsic electronic conductivity also largely boosts the charge transfer rates for urea electrooxidation. The results demonstrate that the NiCo2S4/NF electrode showing a beneficial application prospect in the wastewater treatment and direct urea fuel cells.									56	3	0	0	7	0	57			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000454137400159

However, the precise control of the CO : H-2 ratio from 1 : 1 to the stoichiometric ratio of 1 : 3 is a major challenge in the process of photocatalytic CO2 reduction, especially under long-wavelength irradiation (like green light of 550 nm). Herein, under visible light (lambda > 400 nm), a heterostructured layered double hydroxide nanosheets/TiC (denoted as LDH/TiC) photocatalyst was prepared and exhibited tunable syngas synthesis with different CO/H-2 ratios (from 1 : 1-1 : 3). More importantly, such performance can be well controlled even under green light irradiation (550 nm) in conjunction with a Ru-complex photosensitizer and triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial agent. Theory calculations revealed that the excellent performance came from the assembly between LDH and TiC, which could not only improve the charge transfer efficiency but also change the desorption energy of H-2, resulting in the precise tunable ratio of syngas. This work offers an excellent strategy to design photocatalysts for reducing CO2 to syngas for potential applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000703041200001

Herein, 1D/2D cobalt-based nanohybrid (CoNH) electrodes are developed; the structural design consists of Co3O4 electrospun nanoribbons (NRs) deposited onto a carbon fiber paper substrate where Co3O4 nanosheets are subsequently grown via an electrodeposition step and UV/ozone treatment. The content of noncovalently functionalized carbon nanotubes within the Co3O4 NRs is first tuned to enhance their charge transfer properties and mechanical stability. The electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes is further improved by a phosphorus modification of the 1D NRs, resulting in the formation of NaCoPO4. The optimized 1D/2D CoNH electrode, i.e., ED-0.09 wt% fCNTs/P-CoNHs, displays a similar performance to that of platinum in 0.25 m Na2S/0.35 m Na2SO3 (Tafel slope approximate to 102 mV dec(-1) for the former and approximate to 96 mV dec(-1) for the latter) and outstanding stability for up to 48 h. The versatility and high activity of this electrode is also demonstrated according to tests in a conventional water splitting system (cell voltage 1.55V, to produce 10 mA cm(-2)) and a solar-driven electrolyzer (1 m KOH).									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000514391100001

A carbon-supported bimetallic nickel-molybdenum catalyst was synthesized by thermal reduction of transition metal precursors on the surface of a carbon support (KetjenBlack 600J). The mass-weighted activity of 4.5 A g(Me)(-1) determined in a liquid electrolyte 0.1 M NaOH using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique is comparable to the value reported for Pd/C with a comparable particle size under similar conditions. This NiMo/KB catalyst was integrated in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) using an alkaline exchange membrane and ionomer. Single AEMFC tests performed in a H-2/O-2 configuration resulted in a record power density output of 120 mW cm(-2) at 0.5 V, the MEA was found to be durable under the conditions of potential hold of 0.7 V for 115 h. For the first time, operando X-ray computed tomography (CT) experiments were performed demonstrating liquid water formation at the PGM-free anode during cell operation, and in situ ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (APXAS) were used to study the role of molybdenum in hydrogen adsorption.									115	5	0	0	6	0	115			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000416340300047

Herein, CeO2/Ti3C2-MXene hybrids were prepared by the in-situ growth of cube-like CeO2 using ultrathin Ti3C2-MXene nanosheets as a two-dimensional platform via a simple hydrothermal route. Upon exposure to solar light, the CeO2/Ti3C2-MXene hybrid with the optimal ratio of Ti3C2-MXene exhibited enhanced performance in photocatalytic tetracycline degradation and CO2 reduction, with activities 6.3 and 1.5 time greater than those of pristine CeO2, respectively. The improved activity of CeO2/Ti3C2-MXene was attributed to the Schottky junction induced by the built-in electric field between CeO2 and Ti3C2-MXene, which drives that photogenerated electrons from CeO2 to Ti3C2-MXene and expedites the segregation of the electrons and holes. This work may shed light on the careful design of novel Schottky junctions utilizing noble-metal free Ti3C2 MXene as co-catalysts for building efficient photocatalytic systems enacted in pollutant degradation and energy conversion.									84	8	0	0	11	0	85			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000497245400034

It is shown that parageneses (association) of certain substances permitted the modular constructions of the central metabolism of the system C-H-O-P and the formed modules appear in association with each other in certain physicochemical hydrothermal conditions. Malate, oxaloacetate, pyruvate and phosphoenolpyruvate exhibit a turnstile-like mechanism of switching reaction directions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0006-3029			MEDLINE:26394465	26394465

In particular, in a neutral environment electrochemically initiated water splitting suffers from low efficiency due to high overpotentials (eta) caused by the anode. Electro-activation of X20CoCrWMo10-9, a Co-based tool steel resulted in a new composite material (X20CoCrWMo10-9//Co3O4) that catalyzes the anode half-cell reaction of water electrolysis with a so far, unequalled effectiveness. The current density achieved with this new anode in pH 7 corrected 0.1 M phosphate buffer is over a wide range of eta around 10 times higher compared to recently developed, up-to-date electrocatalysts and represents the benchmark performance which advanced catalysts show in regimes that support water splitting significantly better than pH 7 medium. X20CoCrWMo10-9//Co3O4 exhibited electrocatalytic properties not only at pH 7, but also at pH 13, which are much superior to the ones of IrO2-RuO2, single-phase Co3O4- or Fe/Ni-based catalysts. Both XPS and FT-IR experiments unmasked Co3O4 as the dominating compound on the surface of the X20CoCrWMo10-9//Co3O4 composite. By performing a comprehensive dual beam FIB-SEM (focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy) study, we could show that the new composite does not exhibit a classical substrate-layer structure due to the intrinsic formation of the Co-enriched outer zone. This structural particularity is basically responsible for the outstanding electrocatalytic OER performance.									65	0	0	0	1	0	65			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000384921700016

To discover further progress toward the practice use of the powdered catalyst and improve its low-temperature disinfection, a novel suspension decontaminant was prepared successively by suspending Zn-Ge-TiO2 in hydrofluoroether (HFE). By means of a variety of characterization methods such as XRD, BET, BJH, SEM and TEM, the evolution of structure and properties across Zn2+ and Gedoping were systematically studied. Our data show that Zn (5.28 wt%)-Ge (1.48 wt%)-TiO2 exhibited the best photocatalytic performance. Versus undoped TiO2, the sample has unchanged crystal structure (anatase) and decreased average pore diameter (2.86 nm), accompanied with increased specific surface area (424.9 m(2)/g), crystallite size (5.8 nm) and pore volume (0.29 cm(3)/g). Under simulated sunlight irradiation at -30 degrees C, after a reaction time of 120 min, the degradation efficiency of HD, GD and VX on the suspension composed of Zn (5.28 wt%)-Ge (1.48 wt%)-TiO2 and HFE-458 (HCF2CF2CH2OCF2CF2H) were all over 99.95%. This indicated that the suspension will have a promising prospect of application in CWAs decontamination under the sub-zero environment.

The Bacillus subtilis enzyme is composed of two cupin domains, each of which contains Mn(II) coordinated by four conserved residues. We have measured heavy atom isotope effects for a series of Bacillus subtilis OxDC mutants in which Arg-92, Arg270, Glu-162, and Glu-333 are conservatively substituted in an effort to define the functional roles of these residues. This strategy has the advantage that observed isotope effects report directly on OxDC molecules in which the active site manganese center(s) is (are) catalytically active. Our results support the proposal that the N-terminal Mn-binding site can mediate catalysis, and confirm the importance of Arg-92 in catalytic activity. On the other hand, substitution of Arg-270 and Glu-333 affects both Mn(II) incorporation and the ability of Mn to bind to the OxDC mutants, thereby precluding any definitive assessment of whether the metal center in the C-terminal domain can also mediate catalysis. New evidence for the importance of Glu-162 in controlling metal reactivity has been provided by the unexpected observation that the E162Q OxDC mutant exhibits a significantly increased oxalate oxidase and a concomitant reduction in decarboxylase activities relative to wild type OxDC. Hence the reaction specificity of a catalytically active Mn center in OxDC can be perturbed by relatively small changes in local protein environment, in agreement with a proposal based on prior computational studies.

Here, a three-dimensional (3D) porous nanoaerogels composed of Co3O4-CoFe2O4/CNTs (CO-CFO/CNTs) nanoparticles is synthesized via a facile alginate-derived biomass conversion strategy combining two-pot calcination method and serves as an effectively bifunctional electrocatalysts for Li-O-2 batteries. The as-made electrocatalyst possesses a 3D porous structure with large pore volume, which can effectively shorten diffusion lengths, promote the electron transfer and provide numerous active sites. The CO-CFO/CNTs-based Li-O-2 batteries exhibit improved discharge capacity of about 7800.3 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and achieve a favorable cyclability up to 48 cycles with a fixed capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) due to the co-existence of different functional components of Co3O4 and CoFe2O4 and CNTs conductive network. In addition, the discharge product analysis indicates that the Li2O2 is the dominant product and can be completely decomposed, endowing the CO-CFO/CNTs-based Li-O-2 batteries with superior performance.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000448226900172

Atomic layer deposition of photoactive CoO/SrTiO3 and CoO/TiO2 on Si(001) for visible light driven photoelectrochemical water oxidation								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				114	8					084901	10.1063/1.4819106				AUG 28 2013	2013	Cobalt oxide (CoO) films are grown epitaxially on Si(001) by atomic layer deposition (ALD) using a thin (1.6 nm) buffer layer of strontium titanate (STO) grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The ALD growth of CoO films is done at low temperature (170-180 degrees C), using cobalt bis(diisopropylacetamidinate) and water as co-reactants. Reflection high-energy electron diffraction, X-ray diffraction, and cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy are performed to characterize the crystalline structure of the films. The CoO films are found to be crystalline as-deposited even at the low growth temperature with no evidence of Co diffusion into Si. The STO-buffered Si (001) is used as a template for ALD growth of relatively thicker epitaxial STO and TiO2 films. Epitaxial and polycrystalline CoO films are then grown by ALD on the STO and TiO2 layers, respectively, creating thin-film heterostructures for photoelectrochemical testing. Both types of heterostructures, CoO/STO/Si and CoO/TiO2/STO/Si, demonstrate water photooxidation activity under visible light illumination. In-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is used to measure the band alignment of the two heterojunctions, CoO/STO and CoO/TiO2. The experimental band alignment is compared to electronic structure calculations using density functional theory.

Herein, TiO2 nanosheets (NSs) are in situ grown on highly conductive Ti3C2 MXene and then MoS2 rich in molybdenum vacancies are uniformly distributed on TiO2@Ti3C2 composite through a two-step hydrothermal method. Thus, a unique structure of MoxS@TiO2@Ti3C2 composite with molybdenum vacancies and double co-catalysts (Ti3C2 and MoS2) is achieved. The photocatalytic H-2 production rate of MoxS@TiO2@Ti3C2 composite with an optimized hydrothermal treatment temperature (160 degrees C) is nearly 193 and 6 times higher than that of pure TiO2 NSs and MoS2@TiO2@Ti3C2 composites (160 degrees C). A large number of active sites with the enhanced specific activity for H-2 generation are induced by the introduction of molybdenum vacancies to MoS2 in MoxS@TiO2@Ti3C2 composites. The presence of molybdenum vacancies can suppress carrier recombination, which is beneficial to the reaction. Besides, the presences of Ti3C2 MXene and MoS2 are found to as double co-catalysts to enhance the electronic conductivity, resulting in an increase in efficiency for electron transfer.									137	15	0	0	19	0	140			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000504404800135

Direct seawater electrolysis is the most established technology, attaining high current densities in the order of 1-2 A cm(-2). Alternatively, light-driven processes such as photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical seawater splitting are particularly promising as well, as they rely on renewable solar power. Solar-to-Hydrogen efficiencies have increased over the past decade from negligible values to about 2%. Especially the absence of large local pH changes (in the order of several tenths of a pH unit compared to up to 9 pH units for electrolysis) is a strong asset for pure photocatalysis. This may lead to less adverse side-reactions such as Cl-2 and ClO- formation, (acid or base induced) corrosion and scaling. Besides, additional requirements for electrolytic cells, e.g. membranes and electricity input, are not needed in pure photocatalysis systems. In this review, the state-of-the-art technologies in light-driven seawater splitting are compared to electrochemical approaches with a focus on sustainability and stability. Promising advances are identified at the level of the catalyst as well as the process, and insight is provided in solutions crossing different fields.									17	1	0	0	1	0	18			1364-0321	1879-0690		WOS:000632316600003

The reason for this phenomenon was explained by a series of characterization technologies such as SEM, TEM, XRD, UV-Vis, XPS and photoelectrochemical. We demonstrated that the fast e(-) transport channels were provided by the formed hollow structure of C@Ni-D nanorods, the highly exposed active sites on C@Ni-BP nanorods benefiting from the direct in situ growth of BP, the resulted synergetic effects of C@Ni-D-2 nanorods and BP achieved a better performance of photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting. The optimal hydrogen generation of C@Ni-BP-2 nanorods could reach up to 600 mu mol within 180 min and the rate of hydrogen production did not decrease significantly after four repeated reaction cycles. This work may offer new direction in situ growth of novel catalysts for achieving highly efficient hydrogen production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1793-2920	1793-7094		WOS:000586627200003

Molecular Transformations Accompanying the Aging of Laboratory Secondary Organic Aerosol								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				47	5			2230	2237		10.1021/es303891q				MAR 5 2013	2013	The aging of fresh secondary organic aerosol (SOA), formed in a flow tube reactor by a-pinene ozonolysis, was studied by passing the fresh SOA into a second chamber for reaction with high levels of the hydroxyl radical. Two types of experiments were performed: (1) injection of a short plug of fresh SOA into the second chamber, where the particle mass and average O/C mole ratio were measured as a function of time after injection, and (2) injection of a continuous stream of fresh SOA into the second chamber, where particles were collected on a filter over a period of time for off line analysis by high performance mass spectrometry. These setups allowed the chemistry of SOA aging to be elucidated. The particle mass decreased and average O/C ratio increased with increasing aging time. Aged SOA showed an oligomer distribution shifted to lower molecular weight (fragmentation) and molecular formulas with higher O/C and lower H/C ratios (functionalization). Carbon oxidation states of individual molecules were higher for aged SOA, 0 to +2, than fresh SOA, 1 to 0. Tandem mass spectrometry of oligomers from fresh SOA showed small neutral losses associated with less oxidized functional groups such as aldehydes and ketones, while oligomers from aged SOA showed losses associated with more highly oxidized groups such as acids and peroxyacids. Product ion spectra of fresh SOA showed monomer building blocks with formulas corresponding to primary ozonolysis products such as pinic and pinonic acids, whereas aged SOA monomer building blocks corresponded to extremely oxidized products such as dimethyltricarballylic acid.									20	1	0	0	8	0	21			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000315844200013	23390983

Herein, the visible-light-driven BiVO4 photocatalysts were synthesized via a simple hydrothermal treatment reaction. A mathematical representation for optimizing the synthesizing condition of BiVO4, namely pH and the hydrothermal temperature was successfully generated via response surface methodology (RSM). The BiVO4 sample prepared at pH = 1.96 and hydrothermal treatment at 120 degrees C (Run 4) exhibited remarkable photocatalytic hydrogen performance of 9.52 mmol/h within 7 h. In addition, the observed photocurrent density and photoconversion efficiency were 5.66 mA/cm(2) at 0.7 V and 0.056%, respectively. The profound performance observed was attributed to the low photocharge carrier resistance and a more negative flat band potential for PEC water splitting system. This work demonstrates the feasibility of producing hydrogen from abundant natural lake water via BiVO4 photocatalyst.									30	3	0	0	4	0	32			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000502040600046

However, the high cost and instability of noble metal based catalysts are major concern in their sustainable use. Therefore, the electroactive and non-noble metal based nanostructures are promptly occupying the places of noble metal based catalysts (Pt, RuO2, IrO2 etc.), in electrochemical water splitting and metal-air energy systems. In this work, for the first time, we have reported a non-noble metal based bifunctional (OER/HER) marigold like N-rGO-MoS2-Ni(OH)(2) nanocomposite, which has been synthesized by two-step hydrothermal method. This material was found to possess an exciting surface morphological feature with excellent electrocatalytic activity, resulting from the highly exposed surface area, porous structure and synergistic effect of rGO, MoS2 and Ni(OH)(2) with the additional contribution from N-doping in the material. The overpotentials of 0.271 V and -0.223 V @ j10mA/cm2j and considerably lower Tafel slope of 106.5 and 86.0 mV/dec were achieved for OER and HER respectively. High stability of N-rGO-MoS2-Ni(OH)(2) nanocomposite in both HER and OER adds more value to the material as an active catalyst for energy generation by electrochemical water splitting. With these exciting properties N-rGO-MoS2-Ni(OH)(2) paves the way towards designing efficient energy production and storage devices. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, the inclusion-bearing crystals can have a wide range of origins and ages, further complicating the interpretation of magmatic processes. To clarify some of these issues, here we combined olivine diffusion chronometry and melt inclusion data from the 2008 eruption of Llaima volcano (Chile). We found that magma intrusion occurred about 4 years before the eruption at a minimum depth of approximately 8 km. Magma migration and reaction became shallower with time, and about 6 months before the eruption magma reached 3-4 km depth. This can be linked to reported seismicity and ash emissions. Although some ambiguities of interpretation still remain, crystal zoning and melt inclusion studies allow a more complete understanding of magma ascent, degassing, and volcano monitoring data.									41	2	0	0	3	0	42			2041-1723			WOS:000437834400004	29985407

Individuals growing in different habitats exhibit extensive phenotypic variation but little genetic differentiation. Little is known about the molecular basis underlying environment-induced phenotypic changes. Variation in transcript abundance in A. philoxeroides was characterized throughout the time-courses of pond and upland treatments using RNA-Sequencing. Seven thousand eight hundred and five genes demonstrated variable expression in response to different treatments, forming 11 transcriptionally coordinated gene groups. Functional enrichment analysis of plastically expressed genes revealed pathway changes in hormone-mediated signaling, osmotic adjustment, cell wall remodeling, and programmed cell death, providing a mechanistic understanding of the biological processes underlying the phenotypic changes in A. philoxeroides. Both transcriptional modulation of environmentally sensitive loci and environmentally dependent control of regulatory loci influenced the plastic responses to the environment. Phenotypic responses and gene expression patterns to contrasting hydrological conditions were compared between A. philoxeroides and its alien congener Alternanthera pungens. The terricolous A. pun gens displayed limited phenotypic plasticity to different treatments. It was postulated based on gene expression comparison that the interspecific variation in plasticity between A, philoxeroides and A. pungens was not due to environmentally-mediated changes in hormone levels but to variations in the type and relative abundance of different signal transducers and receptors expressed in the target tissue.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			1664-462X			WOS:000366252600001	26617628

To ensure practical applications in a natural environment, Li-S batteries must be capable of performing normally at low temperature. However, the intrinsic characteristics of S, such as large volume variation, low conductivity, and shuttle effect, hinder its low-temperature applications. Moreover, Li+ transport is poor at low temperatures, resulting in fast capacity deterioration, low-capacity output, and large overpotential. In this study, a free-standing host embedded with CoFe bimetallic nanoparticles has been designed. CoFe functions as an efficient catalyst for the polysulfide conversion. The in situ growth of graphite shells around CoFe bimetallic nanoparticles function as a nanoreactor to confine and absorb polysulfides, and the host is an ideal porous conductivity network for rapid ion transportation, preventing the accumulation of Li2S and alleviating the volume changes during the lithiation/delithiation process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations prove that the successive lithiation process from S-8 to Li2S on CoFe is thermodynamically spontaneous, and CoFe has a kinetic catalytic activity for this series of lithiation reactions. Experimentally, rationally designed CoFe@C@CNF cathodes are introduced into Li-S batteries for low-temperature applications. The cathode delivers superior rate capacity (828 mA h g(-1) at 10C) and a low fading rate (0.053% per cycle over 300 cycles). An enhanced capacity (836 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C) and cycling stability (capacity retention rate of 94.5% after 100 cycles) were achieved at -20 degrees C. This study provides a feasible method for developing high-rate and long-life Li-S batteries for low-temperature applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000768952200001

A slight periodic fluctuation of potential change with standard deviation < 0.65 mV in 48 h and < 2.30 mV (0.04 pH) over 139 h were observed. The composition, structure, and sensing mechanism of the pH sensitive substance was examined. The XRD pattern and XPS results suggested the newly produced material Hy-xLix[LiIr2]O-6 was a mixture of H5-xLix[LiIr2]O-6 and H3-xLix[LiIr2]O-6 with a HCrO2 structure. Approximately 95% of Li+ was replaced by H+ after acid treatment. The pH sensing process was found to be an irreversible redox reaction between the tetravalent and trivalent iridium oxides according to the CV and XPS results. The presence of lithium ion in the lattice combined with well-crystallized small crystals corresponded to the fast response during the pH sensing process. The crystal structure may help to protect iridium from the interference of weak oxides, and thus may maintain stability with a relatively acceptable potential drift in the natural redox condition. The large portion of H- existing in the oxide lattice detected by XPS confirmed the well-hydrated structure, which may also help the electrode to maintain high stability.

The effects of the MnO2 content on the properties of the composite anodes were studied and compared with those of the Pb and Pb-Sn-Ca anodes. Galvanostatic experiments (50 mA/cm(2)) were performed in stagnant sulphuric acid solution at 37 degrees C for the durations of 24 and 72 hours. The results indicated that the Pb-MnO2 anodes operated at lower potentials than the Pb-Sn-Ca anode. The electrocatalytic activity of the composite anodes was improved as their MnO2 content increased, however, high MnO2 contents resulted in electrochemically unstable anodes. The composite anodes showed a lower degradation rate and better corrosion resistance compared to the Pb-Sn-Ca anode. Surface morphology and structure of the anodic layer on the anodes were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Barrier properties of the anodic layer on the electrodes were investigated through cyclic voltammetric measurements. Results revealed that formation of the surface anodic layer was enhanced on the Pb-MnO2 anodes. The anodic layers formed on the composite anodes in 72-hour polarization were more compact than that of the Pb-Sn-Ca anode and provided higher levels of protection.

Herein, a silver (Ag) nanoparticle decorated A-site deficient perovskite is prepared using a facile exsolution method and used as a cathode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The Ag nanoparticle modified (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)MnO3-delta composite (e-LSAM) prepared by the exsolution method displays exceptional activity for the electrocatalytic triiodide (I-3(-)) reduction reaction (IRR) in DSSCs, which is much superior to that of the Ag/perovskite hybrids synthesized by physical mixing and impregnation methods due to the strong interfacial interaction and small Ag particle size. DSSC with this newly developed heteroelectrocatalyst shows a high photovoltaic efficiency of 12.4%, surpassing that of the expensive platinum (Pt)-based control cell (9.93%) with an enhancement factor of 25%, which is among the highest performances of Pt-free cathodes reported to date. Moreover, this new composite cathode shows a much superior IRR durability to Pt, indicating its great potential for replacing Pt. This study paves the way for the rational design of active and durable perovskite electrocatalysts for various energy conversion and storage systems.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000476913600030

We review the recent progress on development of IrOx electrocatalyst films for water oxidation based on our latest research works. A controlled fabrication approach of an efficient IrOx electrocatalyst films is introduced by a facile spin coating of a homogenous solution of Ir precursor complexes followed by simple annealing at different temperature. The composition and crystallinity of the IrOx film are tunable by a simple annealing treatment. The electrocatalytic properties of the IrOx film dramatically depended on annealing temperature are characterized to give the noticeably high performance at 300 degrees C annealing. A soft-template assisted technique using different polymer surfactants as structure directing agents (SDAs) is illustrated in the spin-coating procedure to reveal impacts of SDAs on nanostructures and electrocatalytic water oxidation performances of the IrOx films. The characterization of the first accessible channel-like open pore architecture of the ordered 2D-hexagonal mesoporous IrOx film is described by a facile one-pot strategy using Pluronic F127 as SDA.

We identified a pyrrhotite-siderite isograd that marks metamorphic iron-bearing mineral reactions beginning in subgreenschist facies samples. Even in the best-preserved parts of the basin, secondary overprints were common including recrystallization of iron-bearing sulfides, base metal sulfides, and nanophase pyrrhotite. Despite these overprints, a record of redox chemistry was preserved in the early diagenetic framboidal pyrite and detrital iron oxides including trace nanoscale magnetite that remained after sulfidization in anoxic and sulfidic sedimentary pore fluids. Based on these results, we interpret the Belt Basin as having oxic waters, at least in shallow-water environments, with no indication of abundant ferrous iron in the water column; this is consistent with the cooccurrence of early eukaryotic fossils within the same strata.Plain Language Summary Observing iron chemistry and mineralogy in sedimentary rocks is one of the primary methods for understanding ancient redox environments; today, iron is poorly soluble in seawater due its high dioxygen levels, but some iron-based metrics suggest that ocean and lakes were rich in soluble iron for a billion years after the rise in atmospheric oxygen 2.3 Ga. Using a novel approach for evaluating iron environmental processes, we analyzed the iron-bearing minerals within 1.4-Ga rocks and were able to untangle which minerals were primary, containing information about the ancient environment, and which minerals were secondary, telling the story of later alteration through fluids carrying new elements into the rock or higher temperatures/pressures from burying the sediments. Primary detrital iron minerals implied that the Belt Basin waters were oxygenated, at least in shallow-water environments, contrary to prior work but consistent with the rich fossil record of eukaryotes in the same strata.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			0094-8276	1944-8007		WOS:000464650400012

The conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) biomass derivative into 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has been recognized as an economical and green approach to replace the current polyethylene terephthalate based plastic industry. However, this reaction mostly relies on noble-metal-based catalysts for the sluggish aerobic oxidation of alcohol groups. In this work, we report a series of hierarchical Ni-Co-based transition metal oxide catalysts for HMF oxidation by electrocatalysis. Comprehensive material characterization and electrochemical evaluation have been performed. A 90% FDCA yield, nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency, and robust stability were achieved for NiCo2O4 nanowires. As non-precious-metal catalysts, Ni-Co-based transition metal oxides may open up new potential materials for highly efficient electrochemical biomass upgrading.									73	6	0	0	2	0	74			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000441237800010	29885212

The structure, morphology and optical properties of Ni-Fe-O-M (M =P, B or S) were well characterized by XRD, SEM, XPS and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra. The S incorporated NiFe-based nanocubes (Ni-Fe-O-S) are better in degrading MB than other NiFe-based nanocubes. The degradation efficiency of Ni-Fe-O-S was 98.9% within 10 min in the presence of 60 mg/L H2C2O4 and 5mM H2O2 under visible light irradiation. The COD and TOC removal efficiencies were 69.6% and 51.1%, respectively. The degradation rates of 5 cycles in 10 min are 98.9%, 96.2%, 95.8%, 92.3% and 88.3%, respectively. In the MB degradation, hydroxyl radical is proved to be the main active free radical. C8H11N2O3S12-, NO4S-, C6H6O3S, C6H5NO3, C8H12N2, C6H9O2-, C3H6O4, C3H4O4 and C6H11O are detected from the reaction solution by LS-MS and a possible pathway was accordingly proposed to elucidate the mechanism of MB degradation.

Loading cocatalysts is regarded as an effective way to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of CNs. However, commonly used noble metal cocatalysts limit their applications due to their rarity and high cost. Herein, we present the effective synthesis of single-atom copper-modified CN via supramolecular preorganization with subsequent condensation, which provides effective charge transfer pathways by an "infused" delocalized state with variable-valence catalysis at the same time. The C-Cu-N-2 single-atom catalytic site can activate CO2 molecules and reduces the energy barrier toward photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Excellent performance for photocatalytic CO2 reduction was found. This work thereby provides a general protocol of designing a noble-metal-free photocatalyst with infused metal centers toward a wide range of applications.									81	5	0	0	8	0	82			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000557762800079	32603083

In this study, we improved the enantioselectivity of BAE by protein engineering instead of process engineering as used in our previous work. Saturation mutagenesis was carried out on eight positions of BAE based on structure modeling and substrate docking. A double substituted variant V10 (K358D/A396C) showed an excellent enantioselectivity without decreasing the activity. The functions of these two mutations (K358D and A396C) were investigated, revealing a synergic effect on the BAE enantioselectivity. Using the variant V10, enantiopure (R)-1-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl) ethanol could be readily prepared in >97 % ee, affording a high space-time yield (123 g L(-1)day(-1)) and a high ratio of substrate/catalyst (40 g g(-1)) in 1-L reaction.									7	1	0	0	4	0	8			0175-7598	1432-0614		WOS:000350028600014	25104035	
J	Gillis, KA; Coogan, LA; Pedersen, R				Pedersen, Rolf/A-8405-2013				Strontium isotope constraints on fluid flow in the upper oceanic crust at the East Pacific Rise								EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS				232	1-2			83	94		10.1016/j.epsl.2005.01.008				MAR 30 2005	2005	Strontium isotopes are useful tracers of fluid-rock interaction in marine hydrothermal systems and provide a potential way to quantify the amount of seawater that passes through these systems. We have determined the whole-rock Sr-isotopic compositions of a section of upper oceanic crust that formed at the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise, now exposed at Hess Deep. This dataset provides the first detailed comparison for the much-studied Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) drill core from Site 504B. Whole-rock and mineral Sr concentrations indicate that Sr-exchange between hydrothermal fluids and the oceanic crust is complex, being dependent on the mineralogical reactions occurring-, in particular, epidote formation takes up Sr from the fluid increasing the Sr-87/Sr-86 of the bulk-rock. Calculating the fluid-flux required to shift the Sr-isotopic composition of the Hess Deep sheeted-dike complex, using the approach of Bickle and Teagle [1] [M.J. Bickle, DA.H. Teagle, Strontium alteration in the Troodos ophiolite: implications for fluid fluxes and geochemical transport in mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems. Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 113 (1992) 219-237] gives a fluid-flux similar to that determined for CDP Hole 504B. This suggests that the level of isotopic exchange observed in these two regions is probably typical for modem oceanic crust. Unfortunately, uncertainties in the modeling approach do not allow us to determine a fluid-flux that is directly comparable to fluxes calculated by other methods. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Surface (XPS, UV-vis DR analysis), electronic (EIS, EPR) and structural (SEM, TEM, XRD, N-2 physisorption analysis) properties of the composites and BPA degradation performance were analyzed and correlated to the amount of beta-Bi2O3 present in the composites (weight ratio Ti:Bi was varied between 1:0.2 and 1:0.8). The results show that (i) the narrow band gap semiconductor beta-Bi2O3 acts as a visible-light photosensitizer for TiO2, (ii) a heterojunction between TiO2 and beta-Bi2O3 enables the transfer of visible-light generated h(+) from the valence band (VB) of beta-Bi2O3 to the upper lying VB of TiO2, (iii) a p-n junction enables the transfer of visible-light photo-generated e(-) in the conduction band (CB) of beta-Bi2O3 to the CB of TiO2, and (iv) under UV-light illumination both semiconductors act as scavengers for charge carriers generated by the other component. EPR measurements show that the amount of generated charge carriers and reactive oxygen species (ROS) was higher under UV-light illumination; besides, the amount of generated ROS increased with the increasing amount of beta-Bi2O3 phase. On the other hand, BPA degradation runs and EIS measurements revealed that if the weight ratio Ti:Bi is over 1:0.4, the catalytic activity and the amount of generated charge carriers dropped due to excessive formation of a segregated beta-Bi2O3 phase. The discrepancy between EPR measurements and catalytic BPA degradation tests can be contributed to the fact that BPA degradation proceeds either directly with photo-generated charge carriers (oxidizing organic species directly by photo-generated holes), or indirectly with ROS that include also EPR silent species (hydrogen peroxide and singlet oxygen).									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000598230000010		
J	Sun, Lianlian; Zhou, Fangyuan; Shao, Yina; Lv, Zhimeng; Li, Chenghua								The iron-sulfur protein subunit of succinate dehydrogenase is critical in driving mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation in Apostichopus japonicus								FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY				102				350	360		10.1016/j.fsi.2020.04.060				JUL 2020	2020	Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is a mitochondrial enzyme with the unique ability to participate in both the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the electron transport chain to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). The B subunit of SDH is required for succinate oxidation, which is critical for pro-inflammatory response. In this study, we cloned the iron-sulfur protein subunit of SDH from Apostichopus japonicas (denoted as AjSDHB) via RACE technology and explored its role in the immune system as a response to pathogen infection. The full-length cDNA of AjSDHB was 1442 bp with a complete open reading frame of 858 bp encoding 286 amino acids. Simple modular architecture research tool analysis revealed that AjSDHB contained two conserved domains, including a 2Fe-25 iron-sulfur cluster binding domain and a 4Fe-4S dicluster domain, without a signal peptide. Multiple sequence alignment demonstrated that AjSDHB shared a high degree of structural conservation and sequence identities with other counterparts from invertebrates and vertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis supported the finding that AjSDHB is a new member of the SDHB protein subfamily. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that AjSDHB was expressed in all examined tissues and particularly highly expressed in the muscles. AjSDHB transcripts were markedly induced in coelomocytes both by Vibrio splendidus challenge in vivo and lipopolysaccharide exposure in vitro. Function analysis showed that siRNA-mediated AjSDHB knockdown could substantially reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi m) and further decrease mitochondrial ROS production in A. japonicas coelomocytes. By contrast, AjSDHB overexpression considerably increased Allim and mitochondrial ROS production of A. japonicas coelomocytes. These results supported the idea that AjSDHB is involved in the innate immunity of A. japonicas through its participation in mitochondrial ROS generation.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000537822700039	32371258	
J	Mao YaJing; Qin KeZhang; Tang DongMei				Qin, Kezhang/K-4695-2017				Characteristics, genetic mechanism, and exploration perspective of Ni-rich sulfide in magmatic Ni-Cu systems								ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA				34	8			2410	2424						2018	2018	Nickel content in sulfide ( Ni tenor) is an important parameter in magmatic Ni-Cu deposit. It records Ni content in magma, the degrees of magma evolution and sulfide fractionation. Generally, high-Ni tenor sulfides are believed to be associated with komatiitic magma or alteration processes. However, it is shown that some of the high-Ni tenor sulfides could also be generated by basaltic, picritic magmas without secondary alteration process. This study summarized the characteristics and genetic mechanism of the Ni-Cu deposits having high-Ni tenor sulfides, proposed the discernment sign for different mechanisms, discussed its exploration prospect. The high Ni tenor deposits commonly occur in continental rift and orogenic belts and hosted by olivine-rich rocks, forming by less evolved magmas which are relatively enriched in Ni. The primary Ni-bearing mineral is dominantly by pentlandite, but some komatiitic related deposits are dominated by millerite. According to the Ni tenor in sulfide, the komatiitic related sulfides having higher than 16% Ni could be defined as high-Ni tenor, whereas the non-komatiitic related sulfides could be defined as high Ni tenor ( Ni > 10%) , medium Ni tenor (5% similar to 10%) , and low Ni tenor ( Ni < 5% , Cu > Ni) . The primary high Ni sulfide can be formed by segregation from Ni-rich magma, the absorption of Ni from olivine, the sulfide fractional crystallization, and the reaction of sulfide with sulfur-unsaturated magma. For picritic and basaltic magmas ( relatively Ni-rich) , Fe-Ni exchange between sulfide and olivine is an important mechanism. Whether the partial melting of the pyroxene mantle source is a necessary condition for the formation of high-Ni tenor sulfides remains debatable. The high-Ni sulfides formed by different mechanisms have diverse rock-mineral assemblages and geochemical characteristics, i. e. sulfide mineral assemblages, olivine components ( Fo values, Ni contents, correlations between Fo values versus Ni content) , chalcophile element ( copper, platinum group elements) abundance in sulfide. Thus, these features are valid indicators of the different high-Ni sulfide formation mechanisms. In China, the sulfides in the Huangshannan, Poyi, and Xiarihamu deposits are characterized by high-Ni tenor, whereas those in the Kalatongke deposit are featured by low-Ni and high-Cu tenor. Recent research indicates that Ni-rich sulfide hosting deposits in China were formed by relatively Ni-rich parent magma and FeNi exchange between sulfide and olivine, the latter factor results in 3% similar to 5% Ni tenor increase in the sulfide. For exploration in high-Ni sulfide bearing intrusions, industrial Ni grades could be achieved for sparse disseminated ores, whereas very high Ni grade could be achieved for densely disseminated ores. Therefore, these intrusions are capable of exploring high-grade Ni ores. In orogenic belts, magmas with relatively high oxygen fugacity ( up to QFM + 1) and water may provide favorable conditions for the formation of high-Ni sulfides. In such setting, intrusions with olivine high Fo values ( > 87mol% ) may host high Ni sulfides.									2	3	0	0	0	0	5			1000-0569	2095-8927		WOS:000451727800014		
J	Fulgosi, H; Ester, L; Ljubesic, N								Essential role of peptidyl-prolyl isomerase sll0408 in Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 development								PERIODICUM BIOLOGORUM				104	4			413	419						DEC 2002	2002	Background and Purpose: The molecular chaperones, peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIases), catalyse isomerization around peptide bonds which neighbour proline residues. They participate in a wide variety of important cellular processes, although their true physiological functions are still a subject of intense research. We recently identified a unique chloroplast PPIase, TLP40, which is involved in the regulation of oxygenic photosynthesis, Here, we describe the reverse genetic analysis of a cyanobacterial gene which could be the prokaryotic ancestor of TLP40 isomerase.Materials and Methods: The deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame sll0408 was analyzed in detail and compared with related proteins. For the knock-out construct, the nucleotide sequence within the locus sll0408 was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction. The gentamycin-resistance cassette was inserted at a single BamHI site within the reading frame, and the construct was ligated with the pBluescript vector. The resulting pS3G-1 vector was transformed into Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 cells. Segregated resistant colonies were grown autotrophically and their ultrastructure was analyzed using electron microscopy. Photosynthesis in mutant cell lines was measured with a Clark-type electrode.Results: The nucleotide sequence of the locus sll0408 predicted a protein of 402 amino acid residues (calculated Mr 43909). At the C-terminus, sll0408 displayed high sequence similarity with the PPIase, TLP40, of higher-plant chloroplasts, All five fingerprint sequence motifs characteristic for this type of enzymes were conserved between the two proteins. sll0408 most likely belongs to the family of parvulins since it lacked the tryptophan residue responsible for the sensitivity of the isomerase to cyclosporin A. In analogy with TLP40 the N-terminal sequence of sll0408 contained repeated leucines or isoleucines at every seventh position, which is a characteristic of the leucine zipper consensus motif in coiled-coil proteins. The cells lacking functional sll0408 (Deltasll0408 line) had thylakold membranes with irregular and segmented morphology. Electron-dense structures could be seen in the perilasmic space, often associated with the plasma membrane. Deltasll0408 cells were severely impaired in photosynthesis, with rates of oxygen evolution almost equaling respiration. In contrast to wild-type cells of the same age, more than 90% of the Deltasll0408 cells exhibited ultrastructural characteristics of advanced senescence.Conclusion: Locus sll0408 encodes a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase-like protein which shares high sequence similarity with the TLP40 isomerase of higher plant chloroplasts, indicating their functional and evolutional relatedness, sll0408 maybe part of supramolecular chaperone complexes and its function appears to be essential for the maintenance of photosynthetic activity and proper development of Synechocystis cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0031-5362			WOS:000181124300007

However, it is not yet established which proteins specifically are involved in the water-oxidation process. Much evidence supports the concept that the D1/D2 reaction center heterodimer not only plays a central role in the primary photochemistry of Photosystem II, but also is involved in electron donation to P680 and in ligation of the manganese cluster. This evidence includes (a) the primary donor to P680 has been shown to be a redox-active tyrosyl residue (Tyr161) in the D1 protein, and (b) site-directed mutagenesis and computer-assisted modeling of the reaction center heterodimer have suggested several sites with a possible function in manganese ligation. These include Asp170, Gln165 and Gln189 of the D1 protein and Glu69 of the D2 protein as well as the C-terminal portion of the mature D1 protein. Also, hydrophilic loops of the chlorophyll-binding protein CP43 that are exposed at the inner thylakoid surface could be essential for the water-splitting process.In photosynthetic eukaryotes, three lumenal extrinsic proteins, PS II-O (33 kDa), PS II-P (23 kDa) and PS II-Q ( 16 kDa), influence the properties of the manganese cluster without being involved in the actual catalysis of water oxidation. The extrinsic proteins together may have multiple binding sites to the integral portion of PS II, which could be provided by the D1/D2 heterodimer and CP47. A major role for the PS II-O protein is to stabilize the manganese cluster. Most experimental evidence favors a connection of the PS II-P protein with binding of the Cl- and Ca2+ ions required for the water oxidation, while the PS II-Q protein seems to be associated only with the Cl- requirement. The two latter proteins are not present in PS II of prokaryotic organisms, where their functions may be replaced by a 10-12 kDa subunit and a newly discovered low-potential cytochrome c-550.									75	0	1	0	57	0	75			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1993MX41700005	24317979

Ultrathin graphene-like carbon nitride nanosheets have shown promising prospect in photocatalysis, whereas no preparation strategy for adjusting their bandgap in a wide range has ever been reported. Here in, high yield-rate synthesis of ultrathin two-dimensional carbon nitride nanosheets with controllable oxygenous functionalization (the relative mass ratio of oxygen ranges from 0.523% to 19.9%) was firstly achieved by an improved hummer's method combining concentrated sulfuric acid protonation and potassium permanganate assisted exfoliation, and reduction employing hydrazine hydrate. Protonation and intercalation behavior of different acids in the treatment of bulk-g-C3N4 was elaborated at molecule level for the first time. Introduced oxygenous groups are firstly found to have the capability for adjusting the bandgap of graphene-like carbon nitride nanosheets from 2.54 eV to 3.07 eV and significantly increased the lifetime of the photo carriers. Our strategy may open a new vista for design and construction of various carbon nitride nanocomposites and give detailed instructions in bandgap engineering of other two-dimensional functional materials for wider applications.

Here, we fabricated La-doped nano-Pt-based catalytic membrane electrode using ion beam sputtering method. The effect of La on the morphology and electrochemical performance of the catalytic membrane electrode was investigated by scanning electron microscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical measurements. Compared with pure Pt-based sample, the electrochemical activity specific area of the La-doped sample increases by 74.59%, with 63.95% increase in exchange current density. The results also show that La2O3 enhances oxygen enrichment of the membrane electrode and reduces interfacial energy among Pt grains while pinning the grain boundaries. In addition, the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) measurement shows that the Pt loading in the membrane electrodes is below 0.1 mg/cm(2). Thus, enhanced catalytic performance is achieved in catalysts with lower Pt loading.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0142-2421	1096-9918		WOS:000479330700001

Comprehensive characterization was conducted to study not only the chemical states, photo-optical properties, particle sizes, and crystal structures, but also the effect of these changes on the degradation of BPA. Photocatalytic degradation was conducted under near-visible LED as a low energy light source (0.128 W cm(-3)). The CNQD that were prepared at 180 degrees C for 12 h showed the highest degradation rate (3.6 x 10(-2) min(-1)), which was 3.0 times higher than GCN. These improved photocatalytic activities corresponded to increases in the photo-reactive surface via exfoliation of GCN sheets, introduction of heteroatom oxygen onto GCN sheets, the addition of CQDs, and shortened bandgap. These characteristics allow for the effective transfer and separation of electrons. Nonetheless, the structural breakdown of the CNQD was observed when the HT time was longer than 12 h (180 degrees C). The defected sheets showed a detrimental effect towards photocatalytic degradation by trapping electrons, leading to shorter electron life times.									23	0	0	0	5	0	23			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000455471100080

In addition to long-term growth runs (48-72h) short-term experiments were carried out in order to investigate the initial growth stage. SEM, EDX, HR-TEM and HR-XRD studies show different growth modes for C-polar and Si-polar SiC seeds. The main cause is the anisotropic oxidation of SiC by Al2O(g) which is formed during heating up in the AlN source. The type of the growth mode is essential for the defect density in the grown bulk AlN crystal. The growth on C-polar SiC leads to a higher crystal quality of the bulk AlN with up to two orders of magnitude lower etch pit densities and smaller rocking curve widths and hence mosaicity compared to the growth on Si-polar SiC. New initial 3D island growth models for both seed polarities are introduced. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									21	3	0	0	0	0	23			0022-0248	1873-5002		WOS:000302494400004

The powder specimens was enclosed in a capillary and submerged in water, then intermittently heated to 584 K in temperature steps of 5 K, Each temperature was maintained for five minutes, while a full powder histogram suitable for Rietveld refinement was accumulated in a CPS120 position sensitive detector, The structure refinements of the 62 resulting powder datasets allow a complete analysis of the structure response to dehydration, The site occupancies of the water molecules in the zeolitic channels at each temperature are related to the anisotropic framework deformations and the changes in the cell volume, The changes in the coordination of the Ca cation and the variations in cation-framework oxygen bond distances are also interpreted on the basis of the cation-zeolitic water interaction. Major releases of water molecules from the structure are found at 349 K (W1 drops to 10% occupancy), at 370 K (60% of W5 is expelled), and in the temperature range 420-480 K (80% of W2 is gradually lost).					4th European Powder Diffraction Conference (EPDIC IV)4th European Powder Diffraction Conference (EPDIC IV)	JUL, 1995JUL, 1995	Philips Anal X Ray; CLRC Daresbury LabPhilips Anal X Ray; CLRC Daresbury Lab	CHESTER, ENGLANDCHESTER, ENGLAND	10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0255-5476		0-87849-742-0	WOS:A1996BG37Z00062

The wastewater in the ditch contained acetate and propionate as the major carbon nutrients. Thin-section electron microscopy revealed that the microbial mats were dominated by rod-shaped cells containing intracytoplasmic membranes of the lamellar type. Smaller numbers of oval cells with vesicular internal membranes were also found. Spectroscopic analyses of the cell extract from the biomats showed the presence of bacteriochlorophyll a and carotenoids of the spirilloxanthin series. Ubiquinone-10 was detected as the major quinone. A clone library of the photosynthetic gene, pufM, constructed from the bulk DNA of the biomats showed that all of the clones were derived from members of the genera Rhodobacter and Rhodopseudomonas. The dominant phototrophic bacteria from the microbial mats were isolated by cultivation methods and identified as being of the genera Rhodobacter and Rhodopseudomonas by studying 16S rRNA and pufM gene sequence information. Experiments of oxygen uptake with lower fatty acids revealed that the freshly collected microbial mats and the Rhodopseudomonas isolates had a wider spectrum of carbon utilization and a higher affinity for acetate than did the Rhodobacter isolates. These results demonstrate that the microbial mats were dominated by the purple nonsulfur bacteria of the genera Rhodobacter and Rhodopseudomonas, and the bioavailability of lower fatty acids in wastewater is a key factor allowing the formation of visible microbial mats with these phototrophs.									65	3	0	0	53	2	68			0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:000240474000068	16957249

We studied the effect of a variety of cluster sizes, deposited at the same density and with the same energy (1.5 keV per cluster), over the surface of separate BiVO4 photoanodes in a cluster beam source. Using mass-selected clusters of a narrow size distribution, we were able to reveal that the photocurrent is strongly dependent on the cluster size (in the size regime examined), leading to an increase of up to 85% in the photocurrent for Ti-2000 +/- 54 clusters. Remarkably the quantities of metal used to achieve such an enhancement are on the 2.8 x 10(-7) g cm(-2) level, resulting from the optimum density which is approximately 0.4 monolayers. This work highlights the importance of submonolayer surface treatments, using accurate mass-selected nanoclusters, for the modification of semiconductor surfaces in order to improve the interfacial charge transfer properties.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000422771900013

The effects of tungsten doping and hydrogen reducing were investigated. The films were characterized with XRD, Raman spectra, SEM, UV-Vis transmittance spectra. Furthermore, the films were investigated by electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements with regard to splitting water for solar energy conversion. The films possessed a scheelite-monoclinic structure with good absorption to visible light. The optical band gaps were evaluated to be about 2.65 eV. The flat band potentials were estimated to be about -0.61 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution from Mott-Schottky plots. For non-doping samples, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was relative low because of low density and activity of carriers. When treated with hydrogen reducing, the carrier density increased due to more oxygen vacancies, resulting in the increase of IPCE. In addition, substituting 1% vanadium with equal mole tungsten can increase IPCE remarkably, which achieved about 10% at 0.3 V vs. SCE potential under 400-450 nm wavelength photo irradiation.

In this work, amorphous carbon films (a-C), NiCo2O4 (NCO) and NCO/a-C bilayer films as protective layers were prepared on the surface of silicon, respectively. By comparing these protective layers of Si photoanode, we find that the NCO film can effectively protect Si from corrosion. It can not only lower initial potential but also increase photocurrent density. The NCO films were found to have the best catalytic performance. The photocurrent density of the NCO (60 nm)/Si photoanode is 185.6 mA/cm(2) and that of the NCO (60 nm)/a-C (14 nm)/Si photoanode reaches high to 586.4 mA/cm(2) at a voltage of 6 V vs SCE. The carbon interlayer reduces the width of depletion region built with n-Si, which further improves the current density of the NCO/Si photoanode. The photocurrent density of the NCO/a-C/Si photo-anode is more than three times higher than that of the NCO/Si photoanode. The NCO/a-C bilayer film is an ideal protective layer of Si photoanode for photochemical water decomposition.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000564114500004

This is due to the fact that these photocatalytic materials have unique properties that allow for an effective direct energy transfer from light to highly reactive chemical species which are applicable in the remediation of environmental pollutants and photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Heterostructured photocatalysts are a promising type of photocatalyst which can combine the properties of different components to generate a synergic effect, resulting in a high photocatalytic activity. In this work, a heterostructured photocatalyst comprised of few-layered MoS2 nanosheets coated on a TiO2 nanobelts surface was synthesized through a simple hydrothermal treatment. The hybrid heterostructures with enhanced broad spectrum photocatalytic properties can harness UV and visible light energy to decompose organic contaminants in aqueous solutions as well as split water to hydrogen and oxygen. The mechanism of the enhancement is that the MoS2/TiO2 nanobelts heterostructure can enhance the separation of the photo-induced carriers, which results in a higher photocurrent due to the special electronic characteristics of the graphene-like layered MoS2 nanosheets. This methodology is potentially applicable to the synthesis of a range of hybrid nanostructures with promising applications in photocatalysis and other relevant areas.									121	5	0	0	8	0	124			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000372245900038	26932455

Since heat stress causes the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), investigations regarding major enzymatic components of the antioxidative system are of the essence. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) represent the first line of defense against ROS but detailed in silico analysis and characterization of the potato SOD gene family have not been performed thus far. We have analyzed eight functional SOD genes, three StCuZnSODs, one StMnSOD, and four StFeSODs, annotated in the updated version of potato genome (Spud DB DM v6.1). The StSOD genes and their respective proteins were analyzed in silico to determine the exon-intron organization, splice variants, cis-regulatory promoter elements, conserved domains, signals for subcellular targeting, 3D-structures, and phylogenetic relations. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed higher induction of StCuZnSODs (the major potato SODs) and StFeSOD3 in thermotolerant cultivar Desiree than in thermosensitive Agria and Kennebec during long-term exposure to elevated temperature. StMnSOD was constitutively expressed, while expression of StFeSODs was cultivar-dependent. The effects of salicylic acid (10(-5) M) on StSODs expression were minor. Our results provide the basis for further research on StSODs and their regulation in potato, particularly in response to elevated temperatures.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3				2076-3921		WOS:000776992000001	35326138

The heterologous expression in yeast was utilized to verify that the AtPTR3 protein transports di-and tripeptides. The T-DNA insert in the Atptr3-1 mutant in the Arabidopsis ecotype C24 revealed two T-DNA copies, the whole vector sequence, and the gus marker gene inserted in the second intron of the AtPTR3 gene. An almost identical insertion site was found in the Atptr3-2 mutant of the Col-0 ecotype. The AtPTR3 expression was shown to be regulated by several signalling compounds, most clearly by salicylic acid (SA), but also methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and abscisic acid. Real-time PCR experiments suggested that the wound-induction of the AtPTR3 gene was abolished in the SA and JA signalling mutants. The Atptr3 mutant plants had increased susceptibility to virulent pathogenic bacteria Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, and produced more reactive oxygen species when grown on media containing paraquat or rose bengal. Public microarray data suggest that the AtPTR3 expression was induced by Pseudomonas elicitors and by avirulent P. syringae pathovars and type III secretion mutants. This was verified experimentally for the hrpA mutant with real-time PCR. These results suggest that AtPTR3 is one of the defence-related genes whose expression is reduced by virulent bacterium by type III dependent fashion. Our results suggest that AtPTR3 protects the plant against biotic and abiotic stresses.									55	4	0	0	50	0	59			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:000245852700009	17143616

However, the reactive nature of RE elements with oxygen may degrade the mechanical properties even under room-temperature aging. In this article, we report on the microstructure and mechanical properties of as-processed and thermally aged Ce-containing Sn-3.9Ag-0.7Cu solder reflowed on electroless Ni-P and Cu metallizations. The microstructure of both as-reflowed and thermally aged Ce-containing Sn-3.9Ag-0.7Cu solder joints is more refined compared with conventional Sn-3.9Ag-0.7Cu solder joints. The (Cu,Ni)(6)Sn-5 intermetallic layer formed at the Cu/Ce-containing solder interface is thinner than that of Sn-3.9Ag-0.7Cu solder. The monotonic shear behavior of as-reflowed and thermally aged Sn-3.9Ag-0.7Cu-0.5Ce/Cu and electroless Ni-P lap shear joints was studied, and compared with Sn-3.9Ag-0.7Cu. It was found that both as-reflowed and thermally aged Ce-containing Sn-3.9Ag-0.7Cu exhibit higher strain to failure compared with Sn-3.9Ag-0.7Cu solder joints.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000311312600001

The increase of the temperature from 950 to 1500 degrees C promoted the densification and crystallization of SiC and graphite nanodomains in the ceramic bulk with or without Ni, as identified by HRTEM. Moreover, the Ni-containing precursor led to the formation of ultra-long amorphous nanowires on the surface and voids in the ceramic body obtained at 1500 degrees C. These nanowires presented different sizes and morphologies, but similar compositions, basically composed by silicon and oxygen, with the presence of carbon at their external layers. The growth mechanism and the nature of the nanowires are also proposed. The addition of nickel acetate in the polymeric precursor induced the formation of nanowires with different morphologies in the Si-O-C system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Single-phase face-centered cubic (FCC) structure was achieved with x = 0 and 0.3. Dual-phase body-centered cubic (BCC)/B2 + FCC structure was obtained in x = 0.6 and 1. Complete solid solution was achieved with a significantly reduced duration of MA (10 h) followed by a brief SPS leading to crystallite size of < 10 nm for MA powders and < 60 nm post-SPS. Incremental changes in Al content translate into increase of BCC + B2 phase fraction and alter the co-existing FCC phase composition consequently. Ni dominates FCC phase of CoCrFeNi and Al0.3CoCrFeNi, whereas Fe dominates FCC phase of Al0.6CoCrFeNi and AlCoCrFeNi. Carbon and Oxygen addition during milling process resulted in nanoscale dispersion of Cr7C3 carbide and Cr2O3 /Al2O3 post-SPS. The hardness of AlCoCrFeNi (730HV(0.3)) was the highest among all MA-SPS alloys.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000753726700002

One promising direction was the use of photocatalysis for the production of green fuels(H2,CO,and syngas by splitting the abundant H_2O and CO_2 gases) or the production of methanol and liquid hydrocarbons(from the reaction of CO/CO_2 with H2). Oxide photocatalysts had been extensively studied in the field of photocatalysis due to their low price,abundant sources,good stability,and less secondary pollution. However,the catalytic efficiency was unsatisfactory as a result of the low utilization rate of light energy of oxides,poor charge transport capacity,and lack of surface effective catalytic active sites. Modulation of the electronic structure,carrier diffusion and surface adsorption properties of the oxides through defect engineering was an effective strategy to improve their photocatalytic activity. This review summarized the research progress on defect chemistry of oxides for photocatalysis applications. First,defect engineering was introduced in terms of defect definition,classification and building strategies. Crystal defects were places where the perfect periodic arrangement of atoms or molecules in a crystalline material were disrupted or destroyed. According to the dimension,defects could be classified into zero-dimensional point defects,one-dimensional line defects,two-dimensional surface defects and three-dimensional bulk defects, and defects of different dimensions could be further subdivided into more types of defects,such as vacancy-type defects,doping,pits, and grain boundaries,etc. In terms of construction methods,the construction methods of vacancy defects(oxygen vacancies,metal vacancies,vacancy associations)and doping were mainly introduced. Then,the proper characterization techniques for defects were summarized and compared,which mainly included electron microscopy,Raman spectroscopy as well as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy,synchrotron X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy,positron annihilation spectroscopy,electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy,time-resolved spectroscopy based on ultrafast spectroscopy,energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy(EDS),X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS),photoluminescence(PL)spectroscopy,and in situ techniques. In particular,advanced in situ techniques could monitor the dynamic evolution of morphology,morphology,electron transfer behavior and active sites of defective oxides under experimental conditions in real time. The effective characterization of atomic-level defects was a prerequisite for establishing the structure-activity relationship between defect and photocatalytic activity. Furthermore,the important functions of defects in oxide photocatalysts and the relevant applications of defect-based oxide photocatalysts in energy were elucidated in depth. The effects of defects on oxide materials were mainly reflected in:(1)Adjusting the energy band structure of the oxide. One was that the existence of defects will introduce a defect energy level between the valence band and conduction band,which provided an intermediate bridge for the transition of valence band electrons;on the other hand,the existence of defects would change the 2p orbitals of oxygen atoms and the d or p of metal atoms,resulting in a downward shift of the minimum value of the conduction band or an upward shift of the maximum value of the valence band,thereby narrowing the band gap.(2)Affecting the physical properties of oxides such as conductivity and magnetism. For example,defects could cause n-type semiconductors to exhibit p-type conductivity and increase the room temperature ferromagnetism of the semiconductors.			由于能源需求的急剧增加,开发可持续清洁能源是保护环境的必经之路,而高效的光催化剂是实现可持续清洁能源大规模应用的关键之一。氧化物光催化剂以其价格低廉、来源丰富、稳定性好、二次污染少等优点在光催化领域得到了广泛研究,但由于氧化物光能利用率较低,电荷传输能力差,同时表面缺少有效的催化活性位点,导致其催化效率不尽如意。通过缺陷工程对氧化物的电子结构、载流子扩散和表面吸附等特性进行调控,是提高其光催化活性的有效手段。综述了纳米氧化物光催化剂的缺陷调控研究进展,介绍了氧化物中空位型缺陷、掺杂等常见缺陷相应的构筑策略,对缺陷的表征手段进行了归纳总结。此外,概括了缺陷在氧化物光催化反应中的作用,列举了一些缺陷型的氧化物在光催化水分解制氢、还原二氧化碳(CO_2)、固氮等方面的应用。最后,简要分析了当前缺陷工程调控中存在的问题,并对其发展前景进行了展望。						3	2	0	0	0	0	4			0258-7076			CSCD:6995932

Herein, we report the fabrication of electrocatalyst consisted of an electrodeposited NiFeP alloy film which was composite plated with nano-SiO2 on nickel foam. The structure and morphology of the film were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that the surface area of this NiFeP-SiO2 co-deposition alloy film can be significantly increased after electrochemical etching in a KOH solution. The water splitting properties of the alloy film were evaluated using electrochemistry. By using the NiFeP-SiO2/NF(Etched) as a bifunctional electrode, total water splitting has been demonstrated in a two-electrode cell with a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at an applied voltage of 1.57 V, which exhibited enhanced water splitting activity in comparison to the analogue cell using the pristine NiFeP/NF electrode.

However, studies on PTMs such as acetylation of lysine (LysAc) in cyanobacteria are still rare. In this study, a quantitative LysAc approach (acetylome) on the strains of Nostoc f lagelliforme subjected to different dehydration treatments was conducted. We observed that starch contents were significantly accumulated due to dehydration treatments, and we identified 2474 acetylpeptides and 1060 acetylproteins based on acetylome analysis. Furthermore, an integrative analysis was performed on acetylome and nontargeted metabolism, and the results showed that many KEGG terms were overlapped for both omics analyses, including starch and sucrose metabolism, transporter activity, and carbon metabolism. In addition, time series clustering was analyzed, and some proteins related to carbon metabolism and the ROS scavenging system were significantly enriched in the list of differentially abundant acetylproteins (DAAPs). These protein expression levels were further tested by qPCR. A working model was finally proposed to show the biological roles of protein acetylation from carbon metabolism and the ROS scavenging system in response to dehydration in N. f lagelliforme. We highlighted that LysAc was essential for the regulation of key metabolic enzymes in the dehydration stress response.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1535-3893	1535-3907		WOS:000743734400001	35020403

Herein, we develop a theory-infused neural network (TinNet) approach that integrates deep learning algorithms with the well-established d-band theory of chemisorption for reactivity prediction of transition-metal surfaces. With simple adsorbates (e.g., *OH, *O, and *N) at active site ensembles as representative descriptor species, we demonstrate that the TinNet is on par with purely data-driven ML methods in prediction performance while being inherently interpretable. Incorporation of scientific knowledge of physical interactions into learning from data sheds further light on the nature of chemical bonding and opens up new avenues for ML discovery of novel motifs with desired catalytic properties.Machine learning faces challenges in catalyst design due to its black-box nature. Here, the authors develop a theory-infused neural network approach that integrates deep learning algorithms with the well-established d-band theory of chemisorption for reactivity prediction of transition-metal surfaces.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20				2041-1723		WOS:000694666900046	34489441	
J	Sareen, Bhuvnesh; Thapa, Pooja; Joshi, Robin; Bhattacharya, Amita								Proteome Analysis of the Gametophytes of a Western Himalayan Fern Diplazium maximum Reveals Their Adaptive Responses to Changes in Their Micro-Environment								FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE				10						1623	10.3389/fpls.2019.01623				DEC 17 2019	2019	Ferns have survived changing habitats and environmental extremes of different eras, wherein, the exploratory haploid gametophytes are believed to have played a major role. Therefore, the proteome of in vitro grown gametophytes of a temperate Himalayan fern, Diplazium maximum in response to 0 (G0), 1 (G1), and 3% (G3) sucrose was studied. A total of 110 differentially abundant protein spots (DAPs) were obtained. Among these, only 67 could be functionally categorized as unique proteins involved in various metabolic processes. Calcium dependent proteins, receptor like kinases, G proteins, proteins related to hormonal signaling and their interaction with other pathways, and regulatory proteins were recorded indicating the involvement of five different signaling pathways. DAPs involved in the activation of genes and transcription factors of signaling and transduction pathways, transport and ion channels, cell-wall and structural proteins, defense, chaperons, energy metabolism, protein synthesis, modification, and turnover were identified. The gametophytes responded to changes in their micro-environment. There was also significant increase in prothallus biomass and conversion of two-dimensional prothalli into three-dimensional prothallus clumps at 3% sucrose. The three-D clumps had higher photosynthetic surface area and also closer proximity for sexual reproduction and sporophyte formation. Highest accumulation of proline, enhanced scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DAPs of mostly, abiotic stress tolerance, secondary metabolite synthesis, and detoxification at 3% sucrose indicated an adaptive response of gametophytes. Protein Protein Interaction network and Principal Component analyses, and qRT-PCR validation of genes encoding 12 proteins of various metabolic processes indicated differential adjustment of gametophytes to different levels of sucrose in the culture medium. Therefore, a hypothetical mechanism was proposed to show that even slight changes in the micro-environment of D. maximum gametophytes triggered multiple mechanisms of adaptation. Many DAPs identified in the study have potential use in crop improvement and metabolic engineering programs, phytoremediation and environmental protection.									0	0	0	0	1	0	1			1664-462X			WOS:000504994100001	31921265

The history of photocatalysis, its basic principles, and the problems associated with its commercial application will be discussed. These problems can be partially alleviated by using plasmonic metal nanoparticle/semiconductor systems. Then, we will introduce a new intrinsic plasmonic photocatalyst, SrNbO3. Epitaxial films of SrNbO3 are grown as a metallic oxide by means of pulsed laser deposition. This unusual material has a band gap of 4.1 eV with a degenerate conduction band with a charge-carrier density exceeding 10(22) cm(-3). This large charge-carrier density gives rise to a plasmon that in turn causes a strong absorption in the red range of light; this was mistaken earlier by the community to arise from a mid-gap state. When oxygen is introduced into this system, a special planar defect is formed that progressively reduces the percolation of the metallic region. Within the metallic region an unusual coherent plasmonic effect is seen, which arises from strong electronic correlation. Such a strong optical absorption enables the material to generate hydrogen from water under solar irradiation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000424274700007

For the sake of exploring an efficient visible-light-driven photocatalysts, the MoS2@g-C3N4 core-shell nanospheres were successfully fabricated by taking the advantages of the morphology and structure of materials tailoring and semiconductor coupling, via a two-step approach including the hydrothermal method followed by ultrasonic adhering approach. The morphology, crystallinity, composition, and optical property of as-prepared catalysts were well characterized. The core-shell structure was fabricated by using MoS2 as the template and the coating of g-C3N4 improved the separation of photoinduced charges, due to the strong electronic interaction between them. The photocatalytic activity of MoS2@g-C3N4 core-shell nanospheres had been investigated by the degradation of toluene under visible light irradiation using in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The MoS2@g-C3N4 nanospheres displayed enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity, which is about 1.3 and 9.6 times than that of g-C3N4 and MoS2 nanospheres under identical conditions. Electron spin resonance (ESR) examinations confirmed the generation of center dot OH and center dot O-2(-), which were the key reactive oxygen species involved in the photocatalytic process.									15	2	0	0	2	0	15			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000444194700001

These analyses provided important information on the structures and properties of the nanoporous films. The average size of the nanopores generated in each film was 3.07 nm in radius or less, depending on the process conditions. The film electron densities ranged from 414 to 569 nm (-3), the refractive indices ranged from 1.434 to 1.512 at 633 nm wavelength, and the porosities ranged from 16.1 to 38.9%. Collectively, the present findings show that SiOCH thin films of the type reported here are suitable for use as low dielectric constant interdielectric layer materials in the fabrication of advanced integrated circuits.					13th International Conference on Small-Angle Scattering13th International Conference on Small-Angle Scattering	JUL 09-13, 2006JUL 09-13, 2006		Kyoto, JAPANKyoto, JAPAN	12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0021-8898	1600-5767		WOS:000246059800125

As a result, dysfunctional mitochondria suffer from a decline in oxidative phosphorylation and increased release of superoxides and other reactive oxygen species (ROS). Through this mechanism, mitochondria have been implicated in a host of degenerative diseases. Associated with this type of damage, and serving as a marker of total mtDNA mutations and deletions, the accumulation of a specific 4977-bp deletion, known as the common deletion (Delta-mtDNA(4977)), takes place. The Delta-mtDNA(4977) has been reported to increase with age and during the progression of mitochondrial degeneration. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether ionizing radiation induces the formation of the common deletion in a variety of human cell lines and to determine if it is associated with cellular radiosensitivity. Cell lines used included eight normal human skin fibroblast lines, a radiosensitive non-transformed and an SV40 transformed ataxia telangiectasia (AT) homozygous fibroblast line, a Kearns Sayre Syndrome (KSS) line known to contain mitochondrial deletions, and five human tumor lines. The Delta-mtDNA(4977) was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Significant levels of Delta-mtDNA(4977) accumulated 72 h after irradiation doses of 2, 5, 10 or 20 Gy in all of the normal lines with lower response in tumor cell lines, but the absolute amounts of the induced deletion were variable. There was no consistent dose-response relationship. SV40 transformed and non-transformed AT cell lines both showed significant induction of the deletion. However, the five tumor cell lines showed only a modest induction of the deletion, including the one line that was deficient in DNA damage repair. No relationship was found between sensitivity to radiation-induced deletions and sensitivity to cell killing by radiation. (C) 2004 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Recently, some studies are turning to hydrogen production from seawater or wastewater, to save valuable freshwater resources and make waste profitable. Here, we fabricate one-dimensional SnO2@BiVO4 core-shell nanorod arrays decorated with cobalt-phosphate cocatalyst (1D SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi NRAs), which show efficient charge separation and transport properties due to the rational design of conducting core-layer and introduction of the cocatalyst. The as-obtained SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanodes exhibit largely enhanced PEC water oxidation performance: the maximum photocurrent density of 2.63 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE is 6.58 times higher than that of pristine BiVO4 films (similar to 0.40 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, the ternary photoanode exhibits promising PEC performance for urea oxidation, giving rise to a current density of 3.44 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE in a neutral urea electrolyte. This work presents a sunlight-driven, eco-friendly and sustainable method to produce hydrogen and simultaneously treat urea-rich wastewater.									52	4	0	0	2	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463970400043

Conventional BPD rodent models based on mechanical ventilation (MV) present outcome measured at the end of the ventilation period. A reversible intubation and ventilation model in newborn rats recently allowed discovering that different sets of genes modified their expression related to time after MV. In a newborn rat model, the expression profile 48 h after MV was analyzed with gene arrays to detect potentially interesting candidates with an impact on BPD development.METHODS: Rat pups were injected P4-5 with 2 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). One day later, MV with 21 or 60% oxygen was applied during 6h. Animals were sacrified 48h after end of ventilation. Affymetrix gene arrays assessed the total gene expression profile in lung tissue.RESULTS: In fully treated animals (LPS + MV + 60% 02) vs. controls, 271 genes changed expression significantly. All modified genes could be classified in six pathways: tissue remodeling/wound repair, immune system and inflammatory response, hematopoiesis, vasodilatation, and oxidative stress. Major alterations were found in the MMP and complement system.CONCLUSION: MMPs and complement factors play a central role in several of the pathways identified and may represent interesting targets for BPD treatment/prevention.									3	1	0	0	3	0	4			0031-3998	1530-0447		WOS:000367114900007	26353077

As the endogenous messengers of immune system, opioid neuropeptides participate in regulating immune response. In this study, the mechanism that Met-enkephalin (M-ENK) inhibits ROS production through Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was investigated in the ZF4 cells of zebrafish. ZF4 cells were exposed to 0,10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 mu M Met-enkephalin (M-ENK) for 24 h, and the cell viability was detected with 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The cell viability was significantly increased by 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 mu M M-ENK. After ZF4 cells were exposed to 0, 20, 40, and 80 M-ENK for 24 h, the mRNA expression of Wnt10b, beta-catenin, and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha) was significantly increased by 40 and 80 mu M M-ENK. However, the mRNA and protein expression of GSK-3 beta was significantly decreased by 40 and 80 mu M M-ENK. The protein expression of beta-catenin was significantly induced by 40 and 80 mu M M-ENK, while the protein expression of p-beta-catenin was significantly decreased by 20, 40, and 80 mu M M-ENK. In addition, the mRNA expression of CAT, SOD, and GSH-PX was significantly increased by 40 and 80 mu M M-ENK. The levels of H2O2, QH, and O-2 were significantly decreased, but the activity of CAT, SOD, and GSH-PX was significantly increased by 40 and 80 pM M-ENK. The fluorescence intensity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was decreased, and that of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was increased with the increase of M-ENK concentration in ZF4 cells. The results showed that M-ENK could induce Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, which further inhibited ROS production through the induction of C/EBP alpha, MMP, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000465060500051	30862518

Transcriptional activation and expression of antioxidant enzymes are essential for reducing the oxidative stress. In this study, we present the molecular characterization, immune responses and ROS scavenging activity of mitochondrial peroxiredoxin 3 from Oplegnathus fasciatus (RbPrx3). Coding sequence (CDS) of RbPrx3 contains 248 amino acids polypeptide which consists of highly conserved peroxiredoxin super family domain and two cysteine residues. Pairwise sequence comparison revealed that RbPrx3 has the greatest identity (94.8%) to Sparus aurata Prx3. Transcriptional analysis of RbPrx3 indicated the ubiquitously expressed mRNA in wide array of organs showing the highest expression in the liver of rock bream. Upon immune challenge of Edwardsiella tarda, Streptococcus iniae, rock bream iridovirus (RBIV) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), RbPrx3 mRNA level was up-regulated in immunocompetent liver tissues compared to unchallenged fish. Purified recombinant RbPrx3 treated THP-1 cells showed higher survival rate against H2O2 induced oxidative stress and significantly reduced the level of intracellular ROS. Overall results from our study suggest that RbPrx3 may be involved in broader functions such as regulating oxidative stresses by scavenging ROS and activating immune responses in rock bream.

The prepared materials are characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, photoluminescence, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results show that the ternary heterojunctions doped with Ti3+ are formed, meanwhile, Ag nanoparticle and MoS2 nanosheets are anchored on surface of TiO2 nanobelts simultaneously. The photocatalytic degradation ratio of Bisphenol A in low temperature water and hydrogen production rate for Ag/MoS2/TiO2-x are up to 96.7% and similar to 1.98 mmol h(-1) g(-1), respectively, which are several times higher than that of pristine TiO2. Furthermore, the photothermal performance of Ag/MoS2/TiO2-x is also unexpected. The excellent photocatalytic activity and photothermal performance can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the formation of heterojunctions, Ti3+ and surface oxygen vacancies defects and surface plasmon resonance of Ag nanoparticles, which extend the photoresponse to visible-infrared light region and favor the spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers.									64	5	0	0	16	0	65			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000452926500014	30342291	
J	Kercek, A; Hillebrandt, W; Truran, JW								Two-dimensional simulations of the thermonuclear runaway in an accreted atmosphere of a C+O white dwarf								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				337	2			379	392						SEP 10 1998	1998	We present the results of two-dimensional calculations of turbulent nuclear burning of hydrogen-rich material accreted onto a white dwarf of 1.0 M.. The main aim of the present paper is to investigate the question as to whether and how the general properties of the burning are affected by numerical resolution effects. In particular, we want to see whether or not convective overshooting into the surface layers of the C+O white dwarf can lead to self-enrichment of the initially solar composition of the hydrogen-rich envelope with carbon and oxygen from the underlying white dwarf core.Our explicit hydrodynamic code is based on the PPM-method and computes the onset of the thermonuclear runaway on a Cartesian grid. Only part of the white dwarf's surface is covered by the computational grid and curvature effects are ignored. In contrast to previous works we do not observe fast mixing of carbon and oxygen from the white dwarf's surface into the envelope by violent overshooting of large eddies. The main features of the flow fields in our simulations are the appearance of small persistent coherent structures of very high vorticity (and velocity) compared to the background flow. Their typical linear scales are about 10 to 20 grid zones and thus their physical size depends on the numerical resolution, i.e, their size decreases with increasing resolution. For the early phase of the thermonuclear runaway (TNR) they dominate the flow patterns and result in very little overshoot and mixing. Only at late times, after steady slow mixing and with increasing nuclear energy production, do these structures become weak, but show up again once hydrogen has mainly been burnt and the energy generation rate drops.On the other hand, there are no big differences between high and low resolution simulations, as far as the overall properties of the TNR are concerned. The two simulations which are presented here show only moderate differences in spatially integrated quantities such as laterally averaged temperature, energy generation rate, and chemical composition. We have not expanded both simulations equally long, but for the physical time under consideration the major difference seems to be that the highly resolved simulation is a bit less violent. In conclusion, we do find some self-enrichment, but on time-scales much longer than in previous calculations.									63	1	0	0	0	0	63			0004-6361			WOS:000076124000010

Reefs provide essential ecological services, including food, income from tourism, nutrient cycling, waste removal, and the absorption of wave energy to mitigate erosion. Here, we studied the coral thermal stress response using network methods to analyze transcriptomic and polar metabolomic data generated from the Hawaiian rice coral Montipora capitata. Coral nubbins were exposed to ambient or thermal stress conditions over a 5-week period, coinciding with a mass spawning event of this species. The major goal of our study was to expand the inventory of thermal stress-related genes and metabolites present in M. capitata and to study gene-metabolite interactions. These interactions provide the foundation for functional or genetic analysis of key coral genes as well as provide potentially diagnostic markers of pre-bleaching stress. A secondary goal of our study was to analyze the accumulation of sex hormones prior to and during mass spawning to understand how thermal stress may impact reproductive success in M. capitata. Methods: M. capitata was exposed to thermal stress during its spawning cycle over the course of 5 weeks, during which time transcriptomic and polar metabolomic data were collected. We analyzed these data streams individually, and then integrated both data sets using MAGI (Metabolite Annotation and Gene Integration) to investigate molecular transitions and biochemical reactions. Results: Our results reveal the complexity of the thermal stress phenome in M. capitata, which includes many genes involved in redox regulation, biomineralization, and reproduction. The size and number of modules in the gene co-expression networks expanded from the initial stress response to the onset of bleaching. The later stages involved the suppression of metabolite transport by the coral host, including a variety of sodium-coupled transporters and a putative ammonium transporter, possibly as a response to reduction in algal productivity. The gene-metabolite integration data suggest that thermal treatment results in the activation of animal redox stress pathways involved in quenching molecular oxygen to prevent an overabundance of reactive oxygen species. Lastly, evidence that thermal stress affects reproductive activity was provided by the downregulation of CYP-like genes and the irregular production of sex hormones during the mass spawning cycle. Overall, redox regulation and metabolite transport are key components of the coral animal thermal stress phenome. Mass spawning was highly attenuated under thermal stress, suggesting that global climate change may negatively impact reproductive behavior in this species.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			2167-8359			WOS:000719047500002	34824906

Here, we investigated the role of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 (BSK5), a member of the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase subfamily XII, in PRR-initiated immunity. BSK5 localized to the plant cell periphery, interacted in yeast and in planta with multiple receptor-like kinases, including the ELONGATION FACTOR-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) and PEP1 RECEPTOR1 (PEPR1) PRRs, and was phosphorylated in vitro by PEPR1 and EFR in the kinase activation loop. Consistent with a role in PTI, bsk5 mutant plants displayed enhanced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and to the fungus Botrytis cinerea. Furthermore, bsk5 mutant plants were impaired in several immune responses induced by the elf18, pep1, and flg22 PAMP/DAMPs, including resistance to P. syringae and B. cinerea, production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition at the cell wall, and enhanced PATHOGENESIS-RELATED1 gene expression. However, bsk5 plants were not affected in PAMP/DAMP activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and expression of the FLG22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1 or the WRKY domain-containing gene WRKY29. BSK5 variants mutated in the BSK5 myristoylation site, ATP-binding site, and kinase activation loop failed to complement defective PTI phenotypes of bsk5 mutant plants, suggesting that localization to the cell periphery, kinase activity, and phosphorylation by PRRs are critical for the function of BSK5 in PTI. These findings demonstrate that BSK5 plays a role in PTI by interacting with multiple immune receptors.									21	3	0	0	20	0	21			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000470086100046	30940686

Previously, we have communicated a proven Type II staggered vanadium pentoxide (V2O5)/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode that could improve the photocurrent density. This study aimed to examine the effect of introducing an rGO thin film as an efficient electron conductive interlayer in a proven V2O5/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode, and subsequently tuning the rGO film thickness in achieving the optimum PEC performance. The resultant ternary photoanode structure of V2O5/rGO/BiVO4 was characterised by using field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high resolution-transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), UV-vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. Results showed that the interlayer rGO thin film arising from the sequential drop cast and electrochemical reduction of 320 mu L ultrasonicated GO solution resulted in the optimal photocurrent density of 2.1 mA/cm(2) at 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Furthermore, the chemical physics surrounding the photogenerated charge carrier transfer for heterojunction V2O5/BiVO4 was validated for the structure with and without the rGO interlayer. In particular, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to measure multiple resistances at the FTO/semiconductor, semiconductor/semiconductor and semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces. Additionally, the charge transfer (K-r) and recombination (K-r) rate constants for the heterojunction V2O5/BiVO4 with the rGO interlayer were quantified using intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS). Finally, the PEC H-2 evolution rate from the ternary V2O5/rGO/BiVO4 photoanode was measured to be 32.7 mu mol/hr, which was about 3-fold higher than the bare V2O5/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode.

J	Christen, G; Seeliger, A; Renger, G								P680(+center dot) reduction kinetics and redox transition probability of the water oxidizing complex as a function of pH and H D isotope exchange in spinach thylakoids								BIOCHEMISTRY				38	19			6082	6092		10.1021/bi9827520				MAY 11 1999	1999	The rise of fluorescence as an indicator for P680(+.) reduction by Y-Z and the period-four oscillation of oxygen yield induced by a train of saturating flashes were measured in dark-adapted thylakoids as a function of pH in the absence of exogenous electron accepters. The results reveal that: (i) the average amplitude of the nanosecond kinetics and the average of the maximum fluorescence attained at 100 mu s after the flash in the acidic range decrease with decreasing pH; (ii) the oxygen yield exhibits a pronounced period-four oscillation at pH 6.5 and higher damping at both pH 5.0 and pH 8.0; (iii) the probability of misses in the S-i-state transitions of the water oxidizing complex is affected characteristically when exchangeable protons are replaced by deuterons [at pH <6.5, the ratio alpha(D)/alpha(H) is larger than 1 whereas at pH >7.0 values of <1 are observed]. The results are discussed within the framework of a combined mechanism for P680(+.) reduction where the nanosecond kinetics reflect an electron transfer coupled with a "rocket-type" proton shift within a hydrogen bridge from Y-Z to a nearby basic group, X [Eckert, H.-J., and Renger, G. (1988) FEBS Lett. 236, 425-431], and subsequent relaxations within a network of hydrogen bonds. It is concluded that in the acidic region the hydrogen bond between Y-Z and X (most likely His 190 of polypeptide D1) is interrupted either by direct protonation of X or by conformational changes due to acid-induced Ca2+ release. This gives rise to a decreased P680(+.) reduction by nanosecond kinetics and an increase of dissipative P680(+.)Q(A)(-.) recombination at low pH. A different mechanism is responsible for the almost invariant amplitude of nanosecond kinetics and increase of alpha in the alkaline region.									90	0	1	0	71	0	90			0006-2960			WOS:000080500300014	10320334

In the present study, a novel PDCD4 homologue gene (denoted as AjPDCD4) was cloned from the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus using RACE. The full-length AjPDCD4 cDNA comprised a 366 bp 5'-UTR, a 418 bp 3'-UTR, and a 1353 bp open reading frame encoding a 450 amino acid residue protein with two typical MA3 domains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that AjPDCD4 belonged to the invertebrate PDCD4 family. Spatial expression analysis indicated that AjPDCD4 mRNA transcripts are expressed at a high level in the tentacles and at a low level in muscle compared with coelomocytes. Vibrio splendidus challenge and LPS exposure could both significantly down-regulate AjPDCD4 mRNA expression. More importantly, we found that ultraviolet (UV)-induced ROS production and DNA damage were greatly repressed in AjPDCD4-knockdown coelomocytes. Meanwhile, the expression levels of the NF-kappa B homologue, p105, were synchronously up-regulated in the same conditions. All of these results indicated that AjPDCD4 is involved in modulating DNA damage and ROS production in sea cucumber, perhaps by affecting the TLR pathway. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, a highly efficient mode has been used to synthesize Co@CNTs [pyrolysis products of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)]-derived CoS2(CoS)@NC. Benefiting from the special yolk-shell hierarchical porous morphology, the existence of Co-N bonds, and dual-function catalytic activity (ORR/OER) of the open metal sites contributed by MOFs, the CoS2@NC-400/AB electrode illustrated excellent charge-discharge cycling for up to nearly 100 times at a current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2) under a limited capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) (based on the total weight of CoS2@NC and AB) with a high discharge voltage plateau and a low charge cut-off voltage. Meanwhile, the average transferred electron number (n) is around 3.7 per O-2 molecule for CoS2@NC-400, which is the chief approach for a four-electron pathway of the ORR under alkaline media. Therefore, we believe that the novel CoS2@NC-400/AB electrode could serve as an excellent catalyst in the LOBs.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000643578300048	33826308	
J	Wu, Haiguang; Hu, Wenxuan; Tang, Yong; Cao, Jian; Wang, Xiaolin; Wang, Yuce; Kang, Xun				Wu, Haiguang/ABD-5760-2021				The impact of organic fluids on the carbon isotopic compositions of carbonate-rich reservoirs: Case study of the Lucaogou Formation in the J-imusaer Sag, Junggar Basin, NW China								MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY				85				136	150		10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2017.05.003				AUG 2017	2017	The processes involved in the interaction between organic fluids and carbonates, and the resulting effect on reservoir quality during the evolution and maturation of organic matter remain unclear despite the fact that these processes influence the carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of carbonates. Here, we provide new insights into these processes using data obtained from a detailed analysis of a mixed dolomitic clastic and organic-rich sedimentary sequence within the middle Permian Lucaogou Formation in the Junggar Basin of NW China. The techniques used during this study include drillcore observations, thin section petrography, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron probe microanalysis, and carbon and oxygen isotope analyses. Oil grades and total organic carbon (TOC) contents represent the amount of oil charging and the abundance of organic fluids within a reservoir, respectively, and both negatively correlate with the whole-rock delta C-13 and delta O-18 of the carbonates in the study area, indicating that organic fluids have affected the reservoir rocks. Secondary carbonates, including sparry calcite and dolomite overgrowths and cements, are common within the Lucaogou Formation. Well-developed sparry calcite is present within dark mudstone whereas the other two forms of secondary carbonates are present within the dolomite-rich reservoir rocks in this formation. Comparing thin section petrology with delta C-13 compositions suggests that the carbon isotopic composition of matrix carbonates varies little over small distances within a given horizon but varies significantly with stratigraphic height as a result of the development of secondary carbonates. The net change in whole-rock delta C-13 as a result of these secondary carbonates ranges from 1.8%(0) to 4.6%(0), with the secondary carbonates having calculated delta(13)Ccompositions from -18.6%(0) to -8.5%(0) that are indicative of an organic origin. The positive correlation between the concentration of Fe within matrix and secondary carbonates within one of the samples suggests that the diagenetic system within the Lucaogou Formation was relatively closed. The correlation between delta C-13 and delta O-18 in carbonates is commonly thought to be strengthened by the influence of meteoric water as well as organic fluids. However, good initial correlation between delta C-13 and delta O-18 of whole rock carbonates within the Lucaogou Formation (resulted from the evaporitic sedimentary environment) was reduced by organic fluids to some extent. Consequently, the delta C-13-delta O-18 covariations within these sediments are not always reliable indicators of diagenetic alteration by organic fluids or meteoric water. The characteristics and delta C-13 compositions of the sparry calcite within the formation is indicative of a genetic relationship with organic acids as a result of the addition of organic CO2 to the reservoir. Further analysis suggests that both carbonate and feldspar were dissolved by interaction with organic CO2. However, dissolved carbonate reprecipitated as secondary carbonates, meaning that the interaction between organic fluids and dolomites did not directly improve reservoir quality, although this process did enhance the dissolution of feldspar and increase porosity.This indicates that the delta C-13 and delta O-18 of secondary carbonates and their influence on whole-rock carbonate isotopic values can be used to geochemically identify the effect of organic fluids on closed carbonate-rich reservoir systems.

J	Li, Yanan; Zhan, Fanbin; Li, Fenglin; Lu, Zhijie; Shi, Fei; Xu, Zizheng; Yang, Youcheng; Zhao, Lijuan; Qin, Zhendong; Lin, Li								Immune function of cytosolic manganese superoxide dismutase from Macrobrachium rosenbergii in response to bacterial infection								AQUACULTURE				541						736771	10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.736771		APR 2021		AUG 30 2021	2021	An excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) usually disrupts the balance of the antioxidant system and impairs the homeostasis of cells, resulting in serious oxidative damage. Therefore, a better understanding of how the immune system protects itself against such excessive oxidative stress is crucial. SODs play an indispensable role in antioxidant defense and the innate immune system. Among those, MnSOD is one of the most being. Previous studies using crustaceans have focused much on the gene expression changes underlying pathogenic infections, which generally indicate that MnSOD is involved in the antibacterial immune process of crustaceans. Yet the detailed biological properties of MnSOD and mechanism by which it counters pathogen infection in Macrobrachium rosenbergii remain unclear. Here we first cloned the cytosolic MnSOD from M. rosenbergii (MrcMnSOD), and then analyzed its distribution in tissues and expression patterns under bacterial infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The results revealed MrcMnSOD widely distributed in the tested tissues, whose expression level was highest in the hepatopancreas, followed by the stomach and intestine. Infection with S. aureus and V. parahaemolyticus significantly up-regulated both total SOD activity and transcription level of MrcMnSOD. To further investigate the possible mechanism of MrcMnSOD's participation in that antibacterial immune response, an RNA knockdown assay in vivo was performed. After knocking down MrcMnSOD, a higher mortality rate and more residual bacteria in haemocytes were recorded than for control group. Furthermore, an in vitro bacterial agglutination assay of MrcMnSOD demonstrated MrcMnSOD harbors broad bacterial agglutination to both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Overall, our findings strongly suggest that MrcMnSOD is only capable of modulating the host's redox state but also exerting an antibacterial function in M. rosenbergii, thus shedding new light on the immune functioning of MrcMnSOD in crustaceans. Importantly, this work provides a new perspective for disease prevention and control in farmed crustaceans.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0044-8486	1873-5622		WOS:000657606700008		
J	Finley, Jahahreeh								Transposable elements, placental development, and oocyte activation: Cellular stress and AMPK links jumping genes with the creation of human life								MEDICAL HYPOTHESES				118				44	54		10.1016/j.mehy.2018.05.015				SEP 2018	2018	Transposable elements (TEs), also known as "jumping genes", are DNA sequences first described by Nobel laureate Barbara McClintock that comprise nearly half of the human genome and are able to transpose or move from one genomic location to another. As McClintock also noted that a genome "shock" or stress may induce TE activation and transposition, accumulating evidence suggests that cellular stress (e.g. mediated by increases in intracellular reactive oxygen species [ROS] and calcium [Ca2+], etc.) induces TE mobilization in several model organisms and Lls (a member of the retrotransposon class of TEs) are active and capable of retrotransposition in human oocytes, human sperm, and in human neural progenitor cells. Cellular stress also plays a critical role in human placental development, with cytotrophoblast (CTB) differentiation leading to the formation of the syn-cytiotrophoblast (STB), a cellular layer that facilitates nutrient and gas exchange between the mother and the fetus. Syncytin-1, a protein that promotes fusion of CTB cells and is necessary for STB formation, and its receptor is found in human sperm and human oocytes, respectively, and increases in ROS and Ca2+ promote trophoblast differentiation and syncytin-1 expression. Cellular stress is also essential in promoting human oocyte maturation and activation which, similar to TE mobilization, can be induced by compounds that increase intracellular Ca2+ and ROS levels. AMPK is a master metabolic regulator activated by increases in ROS, Ca2+, and/or an AMP (ADP)/ATP ratio increase, etc. as well as compounds that induce Li mobilization in human cells. AMPK knockdown inhibits trophoblast differentiation and AMPK-activating compounds that promote Ll mobility also enhance trophoblast differentiation. Cellular stressors that induce TE mobilization (e.g. heat shock) also promote oocyte maturation in an AMPK-dependent manner and the antibiotic ionomycin activates AMPK, promotes TE activation, and induces human oocyte activation, producing normal, healthy children. Metformin promotes AMPK-dependent telomerase activation (critical for telomere maintenance) and induces activation of the endonuclease RAG1 (promotes DNA cleavage and transposition) via AMPK. Both RAG1 and telomerase are derived from TEs. It is our hypothesis that cellular stress and AMPK links TE activation and transposition with placental development and oocyte activation, facilitating both human genome evolution and the creation of all human life. We also propose the novel observation that various cellular stress-inducing compounds (e.g. metformin, re-sveratrol, etc.) may facilitate beneficial TE activation and transposition and enhance fertilization and embryological development through a common mechanism of AMPK activation.									10	0	0	0	7	0	10			0306-9877	1532-2777		WOS:000442189900011	30037614

Bright ring-like structure emission of the CN molecule has been observed in protoplanetary disks. We investigate whether such structures are due to the morphology of the disk itself or if they are instead an intrinsic feature of CN emission. With the intention of using CN as a diagnostic, we also address to which physical and chemical parameters CN is most sensitive.Methods. A set of disk models were run for different stellar spectra, masses, and physical structures via the 2D thermochemical code DALI. An updated chemical network that accounts for the most relevant CN reactions was adopted.Results. Ring-shaped emission is found to be a common feature of all adopted models; the highest abundance is found in the upper outer regions of the disk, and the column density peaks at 30 100 AU for T Tauri stars with standard accretion rates. Higher mass disks generally show brighter CN. Higher UV fields, such as those appropriate for T Tauri stars with high accretion rates or for Herbig Ae stars or for higher disk flaring, generally result in brighter and larger rings. These trends are due to the main formation paths of CN, which all start with vibrationally excited H*(2) molecules, that are produced through far ultraviolet (FUV) pumping of H-2. The model results compare well with observed disk-integrated CN fluxes and the observed location of the CN ring for the TW Hya disk.Conclusions. CN rings are produced naturally in protoplanetary disks and do not require a specific underlying disk structure such as a dust cavity or gap. The strong link between FUV flux and CN emission can provide critical information regarding the vertical structure of the disk and the distribution of dust grains which affects the UV penetration, and could help to break some degeneracies in the SED fitting. In contrast with C2H or c-C3H2, the CN flux is not very sensitive to carbon and oxygen depletion.									35	0	0	0	0	0	35			1432-0746			WOS:000423435100001

More importantly, in spite of the essentially poor ORR activity of Rh/C, the acquired Rh/C hybrid nanosheets display a comparable ORR activity to the optimal commercial Pt/C catalyst, which may be due to the extra-small size of Rh NPs and the 2D defect-rich amorphous carbon nanosheets that can facilitate the charge transfer and reactive surface exposure. Moreover, Rh/C nanosheets present the optimal current density and best durability with the minimum decline during the entire test, so that similar to 93% activity after 20 000 s is achieved, indicating a good lifetime for ORR. In contrast, commercial Pt/C and commercial Rh/C exhibited worse durability, so that similar to 74% and similar to 85% activities after 20 000 s are maintained. What's more, in the model system of reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), the kinetic constant k for Rh/C nanosheets is 3.1 x 10(-3), which is 4.5 times than that of the commercial Rh/C catalyst, revealing that our Rh/C hybrid nanosheets can be potentially applied in industrial catalytic hydrogenation. This work opens a novel and facile way for the rest of the precious metal NPs to be supported on ultrathin carbon nanosheets for heterogeneous catalysis.									42	0	0	0	2	0	42			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000395594300010	28116372

This catalyst showed a better efficiency compared to catalysts where either MoS2 was incorporated with CdS or MoS2 alone was supported on rGO. All the catalysts were photoactive under negative biasing. A detailed characterization of catalysts was performed using FTIR, XRD, DRS, HRSEM, HRTEM, SAED, XPS, and EIS etc. Higher activity of MoS2-CdS-rGO correlated with the formation of a mixed phase of MoS2, as well as a heterojunction at the interfaces of MoS2-CdS-rGO. Formation of the heterojunction and the presence of mixed phases of MoS2 have resulted into a better charge separation, a higher charge density and low resistance for charge transfer. These factors have attributed a higher efficiency of the catalyst. The probable mechanism of charge transfer is also discussed. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Stamatakis, Kostas/ABA-4342-2020				On the question of the light-harvesting role of beta-carotene in photosystem II and photosystem I core complexes								PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY				81		SI		121	127		10.1016/j.plaphy.2014.01.014				AUG 2014	2014	beta-Carotene is the only carotenoid present in the core complexes of Photosystems I and II. Its proximity to chlorophyll a molecules enables intermolecular electronic interactions, including beta-carotene to chlorophyll a electronic excitation transfers. However, it has been well documented that, compared to chlorophylls and to phycobilins, the light harvesting efficiency of beta-carotenes for photosynthetic O-2 evolution is poor. This is more evident in cyanobacteria than in plants and algae because they lack accessory light harvesting pigments with absorptions that overlap the beta-carotene absorption. In the present work we investigated the light harvesting role of beta-carotenes in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 using selective beta-carotene excitation and selective Photosystem detection of photo-induced electron transport to and from the intersystem plastoquinones (the plastoquinone pool). We report that, although selectively excited beta-carotenes transfer electronic excitation to the chlorophyll a of both photosystems, they enable only the oxidation of the plastoquinone pool by Photosystem I but not its reduction by Photosystem II. This may suggest a light harvesting role for the beta-carotenes of the Photosystem I core complex but not for those of the Photosystem II core complex. According to the present investigation, performed with whole cyanobacterial cells, the lower photosynthesis yields measured with beta-Car-absorbed light can be attributed to the different excitation trapping efficiencies in the reaction centers of PSI and PSII.

J	Song YanRu; Ye Kai; Xu HaiJin								Upward mantle wedge convection recorded by Zhimafang orogenic garnet-lherzolite, Sulu UHP terrane, eastern China.								ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA				25	1			147	158						JAN 2009	2009	Many orogenic garnet peridotite bodies are enclosed in ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) gneisses and/or migmatites in Sulu UHP terrane. On the basis of their field occurrence and bulk rock geochemistry, a group of garnet peridotites have been derived from depleted mantle and were subsequently metasomatized by melts and/or fluids derived from the subducted continental crust. However, their early stage depletion processes are still unclear. New evidence on early stage metamorphism of the garnet lherzolite from Zhimafang, Donghai County, Sulu UHP terrane are reported. Based on detailed analysis of reaction textures and mineral compositions, the Zhimafang garnet lherzolite have experienced at least two stages of metamorphism before they were evolved in high P-T subduction zone metamorphism. The protolith of the Zhimafang garnet lherzolite was a high- pressure and high-temperature fertile garnet lherzolite, which is defined by the high Ca-Cr core of garnet porphyroclast and inclusions of high-Mg clinopyroxene, high-Al-Cr orthopyroxene and high-Mg olivine. The rocks were then transformed to a high-temperature and low-pressure refractory spinel-hurzbergite or spinel-dunite, as indicated by the presence of abundant relict high-Al chromite and high-Mg, low-Ni olivine, as well as high-Mg orthopyroxene included in the low-Cr mantle of the porphyroclastic garnet and core of fine-grained neoblastic garnet, clinopyroxene is absent in this stage. The early stage metamorphic evolutions of the Zhimafang garnet therzolite suggest that it experienced upward mantle wedge convection during the subduction of previous oceanic slab before they were evolved in the high P-T subduction zone metamorphism due to subsequent continental subduction. We propose that the Zhimafang gamat lherzolite were originated from deep, hot and fertile mantle wedge above the, previously subducted oceanic slab, thermal buoyancy in the mantle wedge above the subducted oceanic slab resulted in their convection to shallower back are and sub-are mantle wedge, and decompressional melting transformed the enriched garnet-lherzolite to depleted spinel-hurzbergite or spinel-dunite.									1	2	0	0	0	0	2			1000-0569	2095-8927		WOS:000264381800012

Overexpression of RhNAC31 in Arabidopsis confers salt, cold, and drought tolerance along with enhanced ABA sensitivity.AbstractPlant-specific NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC (NAC) transcription factors serve essential functions in plant development and plant responses to environmental cues. Yet, transcription factors specific to the rose (Rosa hybrida) NAM/CUC3 subfamily are poorly understood. Here, we identify a novel NAM/CUC3-subfamily transcription factor, RhNAC31, that is associated with flower opening and can be induced by increased salt, cold, and dehydration stress treatment. RhNAC31 has a transactivation region in its C-terminal region, and its overexpression is associated with enhanced cold tolerance in Arabidopsis, conferring a higher survival rate and reduced reactive oxygen (H2O2 and O-2(-)) levels. Under salt stress conditions, plants overexpressing RhNAC31 displayed increased germination rates and lower levels of H2O2, malondiadehyde (MDA), peroxidase (POD), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Moreover, RhNAC31 conferred enhanced drought resistance by reducing the rate of water loss through leaves. Further characterization revealed a higher sensitivity of RhNAC31 transgenic plants to abscisic acid (ABA) both during and post-germination, causing lower germination and root inhibition rates under ABA treatment. Quantitative PCR experiments showed that numerous abiotic stress-related genes were activated by RhNAC31 overexpression. Our results highlight RhNAC31 as a positive transcriptional regulator of tolerance to multiple abiotic pressures, and we conclude that RhNAC31 has potential for use in the molecular breeding of stress-tolerant crops.									14	0	0	0	10	0	14			0137-5881	1861-1664		WOS:000465542500004

Firstly, Ni-Fe hydroxides film has been electrodeposited on the surface of NF, leading to a homogeneous doping of NiFe. Then, the anemones-like nanorods with scaly surface have been prepared though a facile hydrothermal sulfuration with co-adding of P123 and MoO42-. SEM and TEM images confirm the NiFeMoS/NF-P has anemones-like nanorods morphology with scale-like surface composed of many nanosheets. With the absence of P123 or MoO42-, scaly surface of NiFeMoS nanorods can't be obtained, implying the role of P123 and MoO(4)(2-)as organic-inorganic hybrids directing reagents. The detailed influence of P123 and MoO42- on NiFeMoS nanostructure and electrocatalytic activity for water splitting has been investigated. NiFeMoS/NF-P as bifunctional electrocatalyst exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance in 1M KOH, producing a current density of 150 mA cm(-2) at a overpotential of 280 mV for OER and a overpotential of 100 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER. Moreover, in the same system for overall water-splitting, NiFeMoS/NF-P present remarkable performance with a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.52 V.									176	5	0	0	7	0	175			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000418533400090

In order to ensure energy utilization in safety, the flame characteristics and explosion pressure in the lean, stoichiometric and rich mixture are investigated systematically by varying hydrogen addition and initial pressure. In the lean and stoichiometric mixture, effects of the diffusional-thermal and hydrodynamic instability on flame destabilization are enhanced with hydrogen addition. As initial pressure increase, the diffusional-thermal instability has a limited effect on flame destabilization while effects of the hydrodynamic instability continue to enhance. In the rich mixture, effects of the diffusional-thermal instability on the flame stabilization and effects of the hydrodynamic instability on the flame destabilization enhance significantly with hydrogen addition. As initial pressure increase, effects of the diffusional-thermal instability on the flame stabilization are very limited and effects of the hydrodynamic instability on the flame destabilization are enhanced. The variation in maximum explosion pressure could be neglected with hydrogen addition due to decreasing heat loss, and maximum pressure rise rate increases with hydrogen addition. Besides, explosion pressure evolution could be evaluated accurately by considering the flame instabilities. And by varying equivalence ratio, hydrogen addition and initial pressure, the most enhancing and inhibiting reactions to laminar flame velocity are H + O-2 = O + OH and H + CH3(+M)=CH4(+M), respectively.									71	2	0	0	3	0	73			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000441893200028

Those pregnancy recognition signals silence expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISG) in uterine luminal (LE) and superficial glandular (sGE) epithelia while inducing expression of genes for transport of nutrients, including glucose and amino acids, into the uterine lumen to support growth and development of the conceptus. In sheep and pigs, glucose not utilized immediately by the conceptus is converted to fructose. Glucose, fructose, serine and glycine in uterine histotroph can contribute to one carbon (1C) metabolism that provides one-carbon groups for the synthesis of purines and thymidylate, as well as S-adenosylmethionine for epigenetic methylation reactions. Serine and glycine are transported into the mitochondria of cells and metabolized to formate that is transported into the cytoplasm for the synthesis of purines, thymidine and Sadenosylmethionine. The unique aspects of one-carbon metabolism are discussed in the context of the hypoxic uterine environment, aerobic glycolysis, and similarities in metabolism between cancer cells and cells of the rapidly developing fetal-placental tissues during pregnancy. Further, the evolution of anatomical and functional aspects of the placentae of sheep and pigs versus primates is discussed in the context of mechanisms to efficiently obtain, store and utilize nutrients required for rapid fetal growth in the last one-half of gestation.									9	1	0	0	5	0	10			0065-2598	2214-8019	978-3-030-54462-1; 978-3-030-54461-4	WOS:000637941100001	33770399

Hydrothermal conglomerated dolomite is hosted only in crystalline dolomite, the transitional zone from the top of the Mid-Cambrian to evaporate at the bottom of the Upper Cambrian to dolomite. Hydrothermal dolomite is characterized by saddle crystal morphology, curved crystal and wavy extinction in thin section under crossed-polarized light. Geochemical analysis shows that hydrothermal dolomite has higher Ca/Mg values and Sr contents, slightly higher Fe, Mn and Ba contents, and more depleted delta18O values(-10.1~-12.2)than those of matrix dolomite(-6.1~-7.8).The delta13C values of hydrothermal dolomite in different locations vary greatly, but are similar to those of related host dolomite. The homogeneous temperatures of primary inclusions in the dolomites range from 90℃ to 120℃.The field geometry, petrography and geochemistry of hydrothermal dolomites indicate that higher temperature at which hydrothermal dolomite deposited resulted from the depth of deep burial and temperature gradient of the earth. The fluids were not magmatic but formation water from the Cambrian dolomite, possibly with involvement of deep circular meteoric water. After long-term fluid-rock reaction, these fluids were armed with the same geochemical features. Driven by faulting, hydrothermal fluids migrate along the interlayers. During this process, anhydrite nodule in the dolomite is dissolved to form voluminous of dissolved porosity. With the temperature and pressure decreasing and a large amount of CO2 released, hydrothermal dolomite starts to precipitate. Study of the forming mechanism of hydrothermal dolomite of this kind has some significance for understanding of evolution of the carbonatic rock reservoir in the Tarim Basin			在塔里木盆地西北缘寒武系中,发育有团块状的热水白云石,其具有明显的层控性:产出在中寒武统顶到上寒武统底的蒸发岩向白云岩过渡段,且仅赋存于粉晶白云岩中.热水白云石具有典型的鞍状白云石特征:弯曲的晶面,波状消光,边缘多发生去白云岩化.地球化学分析显示,其Ca/Mg值稍高于基质白云石, Sr,Fe,Mn和Ba含量也略高于基质白云石.delta18O值(-10.1~-12.2)较基质白云石(-6.1~-7.8)明显偏负.不同层位热水白云石的delta13C值之间存在较大的差异,但与同一层位的热水白云石和寄主岩石的delta13C值非常相近.包裹体均一温度多分布在90~120℃之间.综合分析表明,热水白云石形成时的较高温度主要是由较深的埋藏深度和较高的地温梯度所造成的.形成热水白云石的流体并不是岩浆热液,而主要为寒武系白云岩内地层水,并可能有深循环的大气降水掺入,这些流体经历了长期的水岩反应,具有相应的地球化学特征.在断裂活动等作用的驱使下,热流体层内运移.运移过程中,溶解了岩层中硬石膏结核,形成溶蚀孔隙;而当压力降低,CO2大量析出时,开始沉淀形成热水白云石.分析这类热水白云石的形成机制,对于研究塔里木盆地碳酸盐岩储层发育具有一定启示意义						4	19	0	0	1	0	20			0001-5717			CSCD:4126034

The major mineralization is associated with a high-angle reverse fault (Wattle Gully fault) that has a maximum displacement of 40 m. Over 10(6) metric tons (t) of vein quartz, averaging 10.5 g/t Au, occur within a dilatant jog in this structure. Fold geometry has controlled fault geometry and resulted in the localization of the jog segment where the Wattle Gully fault traverses an east-dipping fold limb to link two more steeply dipping, bedding-parallel fault segments on adjacent west-dipping fold limbs. Cold mineralization is also associated with several minor east-dipping reverse faults and a bedding-parallel fault whose development is related to flexural slip during fold tightening. Mineralization occurs within fault-fill veins and extension veins adjacent to faults. The geometry and internal structures of veins indicate that vein growth has been controlled by repeated fluctuations in fluid pressure and shear stress associated with fault-valve behavior.Vein mineralogy is dominated by quartz, with minor carbonates, chlorite, white mica, albite, and apatite. Arsenopyrite and pyrite are the major sulfide phases, but sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, and pyrrhotite are also present. The highest Au grades tend to be localised in vein systems that are in proximity to carbonaceous slates. Wall-rock alteration is minor and restricted mainly to narrow zones adjacent to major vein systems.Sulfur isotope fractionation between galena and sphalerite indicates mineralization occurred at temperatures around 300 degrees C. The delta(34)S compositions of pyrite and arsenopyrite are nearly uniform throughout the mine (1.5-2.8 parts per thousand) but are generally not in equilibrium with the delta(34)S values of associated base metal sulfides (0.7-5.3 parts per thousand). The delta(18)O values for vein quartz vary between 15.6 and 18.0 per mil and correspond to delta(18)O values around 10 per mil in the hydrothermal fluid responsible for mineralization. Vein carbonates have delta(18)O values that are close to equilibrium with those in quartz. The delta(13)C values in vein carbonates range from -2.8 to -6.8 per mil.Fluid inclusions in vein quartz contain C-O-H fluids of variable compositions, but three main types are recognized. Type I fluid inclusions are two-phase aqueous inclusions with low salinities, low CO2 and CH4 contents, and quite variable CO2/CH4 ratios. Homogenization temperatures between 160 degrees and 240 degrees C are consistent with trapping near 300 degrees C and fluid pressures around 130 MPa. Type II inclusions contain up to 20 mole percent CO2 and have final homogenization temperatures in the range of 280 degrees to 310 degrees C, high but variable CO2/CH4 ratios, and variable CO2 densities. Rare, high-density carbonic inclusions (type III) contain less than 40 mole percent H2O and could have formed by phase separation from type II fluids.The isotopic and hulk chemistry of fluids is consistent with derivation by metamorphic devolatilization or via exchange with metamorphic rocks at mid- to lower crustal levels late during crystal thickening and prior to widespread lower crustal anatexis in the Late Devonian. The timing and structural setting of gold mineralization suggest that the regional-scale architecture of fluid migration has been controlled by the development of a linked system of thrusts that propagated into the Ordovician turbidite sequence late during crustal shortening.The evolution of fluid chemistry in the Wattle Gully fault is interpreted to have been controlled by redox reactions, fluid mixing and phase separation in response to fluid pressure cycling, and fluid-rock interaction during fault-valve behavior. A major influence on gold deposition has been mixing between deeply sourced type II fluids and more reduced CH4-bearing fluids that evolved during fluid reaction with carbonaceous pelites in the alteration envelope. Repeated episodes of mixing of these fluids, especially at the dilatant jog, have been governed by the cyclic changes in hydraulic head associated with fault-valve behavior.									186	12	1	0	0	2	194			0361-0128			WOS:A1995TT49700017

The physicochemical parameters characterizing the mechanical properties of monolayers formed by phospholipid and monogalactoglyceride fractions (model of hydrophobic/hydrophilic membrane) were established. It has been shown that oxidative stress induced by ozone treatment caused an increase in mass of calli (relative to the control), dependent on the presence of tocopherol and gallic acid. Changes of MDA level, of activity of antioxidative enzymes and of composition of membrane lipids demonstrate cell adaptation to stressful conditions. The physicochemical parameters of lipid layers determined from model experiments performed using Langmuir trough technique pointed to the changes in the structure of phospholipids caused by ozone stress and indicated that the presence of tocopherol and gallic acid effectively reversed these changes. Galactose groups in polar part of galactolipids may be a "trap'' for ROS, reducing their access to the interior of the membranes. The wheat callus cells use this mechanism in the process of adaptation, as ozone treatment resulted in the reconstruction of membranes by increasing the share of monogalactolipids. Cooperation between tocopherol and gallic acid in the reactions taking place in the presence of ozone was also discussed.									11	0	0	0	6	0	11			0137-5881	1861-1664		WOS:000372930000004		
J	Sygellou, Labrini; Tzanidis, Iordanis; Tasis, Dimitrios					Sygellou, Labrini/0000-0001-8466-7029			Investigation of electronic properties and chemical interactions of graphene- MoS x composites								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				517						146188	10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.146188				JUL 1 2020	2020	Nanostructured transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDs) materials exhibit promising potential in next-generation optoelectronic devices and catalysts. TMDs possess chemically inert basal planes and catalytically active edge sites, with the relative population of the latter being a decisive factor for tailoring the structural, chemical and electronic properties of such nanostructures. In virtually all applications, TMD-based assemblies must be interfaced with other materials (such as graphitic domains in an electrode). During the in situ growth of MoS2 nanostructures in the presence of oxygen-doped graphitic materials, the formation of amorphous and/or crystalline Mo-based species could influence the chemical environment and electronic properties of the composites. In this study a detailed investigation of both graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with MoSxOy composites were studied for the first time with X-ray and ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS/UPS). The composites were obtained upon gradual heating of GO and rGO with ammonium tetra-thiomolubdate (ATTM) hybrid films in Ultra High Vacuum where Mo6+, Moa+ (5 <= a < 6), MoS2 and sulphur oxides were formed. An accurate assessment of the chemical environment of the component interfaces along with its electronic properties was performed. These findings have implications for electronic transport and the understanding of behavior of such hybrid assemblies in many applications.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000531489100007		
J	Wang, Leijie; Bai, Wangfeng; Zhao, Xinyu; Ding, Yuqin; Wu, Shiting; Zheng, Peng; Li, Peng; Zhai, Jiwei								Influences of rare earth site engineering on piezoelectric and electromechanical response of (Ba0.85Ca0.15) (Zr0.1Ti0.9)O-3 lead-free ceramics								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS				31	9			6560	6573		10.1007/s10854-020-03212-1				MAY 2020	2020	The significant deterioration of temperature and fatigue stability are often observed in (Ba0.85Ca0.15) (Zr0.1Ti0.9)O-3 (BCZT) ceramics, which will cause great resistance in practical applications. We have demonstrated that introducing various rare earth elements (e.g., Dy, Er, Eu, Ho, Pr and Sm) into BCZT ceramics can effectively solve above obstacle. The effects of the doped rare earth element types on the crystal phase, microstructure and resulting properties have been comparatively investigated. The rare earth ions (e.g., Dy, Eu, Ho, Pr and Sm) substituting at the A site are beneficial to acquire the enhanced piezoelectric properties (475-521pC/N) and electromechanical response (505-546 pm/V) for BCZT ceramics, while Er doping generates degraded electrical properties. More importantly, significantly improved temperature stability of piezoelectric properties was achieved in Eu-and Ho-doped BCZT ceramics, featured by less than 8% and 2% variation in the temperature range 20-70 degrees C. Moreover, excellent fatigue endurance and good frequency dependence were also realized in rare earth element-modified BCZT ceramics, which originated from the decreased defect density due to the reduction of oxygen vacancies. This work will provide a promising way to improve the temperature and fatigue stability of BCZT material without affecting the piezoelectric properties through doping various rare earth elements.									7	0	0	0	0	1	7			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000526406800006

In this study, a full-length cDNA (1524 bp) encoding the catalase gene (LmCAT) from Locusta migratoria was cloned (accession number KT716445). The open reading frame of the LmCAT gene encoded 507 amino acids and shared 57.8%-97.8% amino acid identities with other insect CATs. The coding region was interrupted by 9 introns, while its promoter region contained 15 putative binding sites for 5 kinds of transcriptional regulation factors. For the stage-specific expression profile, LmCAT was highly expressed in the fourth-instar nymphs. For the tissue-specific expression profile, the LmCAT transcripts were highest in the fat bodies, and relatively abundant in the gastric caecum, Malpighian tubules, ovary, and integument. Moreover, the result showed that quercetin could significantly induce the expression level of LmCAT. The expression of LmCAT could be silenced by RNAi, but the moralities were not significantly different between control and RNAi groups. Our results would provide valuable information for further study on the ROS regulation mechanism in insect. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we described the isolation and functional characterization of a novel catalase from durum wheat, designed TdCAT1. Molecular Phylogeny analyses showed that wheat TdCAT1 exhibited high amino acids sequence identity to other plant catalases. Sequence homology analysis showed that TdCAT1 protein contained the putative calmodulin binding domain and a putative conserved internal peroxisomal targeting signal PTS1 motif around its C-terminus. Predicted three-dimensional structural model revealed the presence of four putative distinct structural regions which are the N-terminal arm, the beta-barrel, the wrapping and the alpha-helical domains. TdCAT1 protein had the heme pocket that was composed by five essential residues. TdCAT1 gene expression analysis showed that this gene was induced by various abiotic stresses in durum wheat. The expression of TdCAT1 in yeast cells and Arabidopsis plants conferred tolerance to several abiotic stresses. Compared with the non-transformed plants, the transgenic lines maintained their growth and accumulated more proline under stress treatments. Furthermore, the amount of H2O2 was lower in transgenic lines, which was due to the high CAT and POD activities. Taken together, these data provide the evidence for the involvement of durum wheat catalase TdCAT1 in tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses in crop plants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, knowledge of how lowmolecular- weight organic acids (LMWOAs) secreted by plants in agricultural soils mediate the dissolution of HANPs and release of dissolved phosphate is nonexistent. Here, three of the most commonly occurring LMWOAs (acetic, oxalic, and citric acids) were evaluated for their roles in HANPs dissolution in both batch and column systems. Particularly, O-isotopic ratios of dissolved phosphate during HANPs dissolution were measured to disentangle mechanisms controlling isotope fractionation. Our results reveal that in a batch system HANPs dissolution was very fast but the overall dissolution efficiency was low (<= 30%), unlike in a column system where similar to 100% dissolution was achieved. The low dissolution efficiency of HANPs in the batch system was due predominantly to rapid consumption of protons, whereas in the column system the HANPs were progressively dissolved by low pH LMWOAs and reaction products were eluted out. Regardless of LMWOA type and experimental system, the isotopically lighter phosphate ((PO4)-O-16) was preferentially released during the initial phases of dissolution and dissolved phosphate became gradually (PO4)-O-18-enriched with time. This fractionation was less in batch (-0.3% to + 1.1%) than in column (-1.3% to + 1.1%) systems due primarily to lower dissolution efficiency and higher (PO4)-O-16 and (PO4)-O-18 exchange between HANPs and dissolved phosphates. The Rayleigh model well described O-isotopic fractionation of dissolved phosphate under different LMWOAs. Overall, our findings provide important insights into the dissolution kinetics and O-isotopic evolution of phosphate-based NPs that are relevant to plant-soil systems particularly at the rhizosphere.									24	0	0	0	20	0	24			2051-8153	2051-8161		WOS:000381438900010

BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOENERGETICS				1857	7	SI		928	937		10.1016/j.bbabio.2015.12.008				JUL 2016	2016	Respiratory complex I couples NADH:quinone oxidoreduction to ion translocation across the membrane, contributing to the buildup of the transmembrane difference of electrochemical potential. H+ is well recognized to be the coupling ion of this system but some studies suggested that this role could be also performed by Na+ We have previously observed NADH-driven Na+ transport opposite to H+ translocation by menaquinone-reducing complexes I, which indicated a Na+/H+ antiporter activity in these systems. Such activity was also observed for the ubiquinone-reducing mitochondria(complex I in its deactive form. The relation of Na+ with complex I may not be surprising since the enzyme has three subunits structurally homologous to bona fide Na+/H+ antiporters and translocation of H+ and Na+ ions has been described for members of most types of ion pumps and transporters. Moreover, no clearly distinguishable motifs for the binding of H+ or Na+ have been recognized yet. We noticed that in menaquinone-reducing complexes I, less energy is available for ion translocation, compared to ubiquinone-reducing complexes I. Therefore, we hypothesized that menaquinone-reducing complexes I perform Na+/H+ antiporter activity in order to achieve the stoichiometry of 4H(+)/2e(-). In agreement, the organisms that use ubiquinone, a high potential quinone, would have kept such Na+/H+ antiporter activity, only operative under determined conditions. This would imply a physiological role(s) of complex I besides a simple "coupling" of a redox reaction and ion transport, which could account for the sophistication of this enzyme.

In line with the increasing demand in emerging areas such as long-range electric vehicles and smart grids, there is a continuous effort to achieve high energy by maximizing the reversible capacity of electrode materials, particularly cathode materials. However, in recent years, with the continuous enhancement of battery energy density, safety issues have increasingly attracted the attention of researchers, becoming a non-negligible factor in determining whether the electric vehicle industry has a foothold. The key issue in the development of battery systems with high specific energies is the intrinsic instability of the cathode, with the accompanying question of safety. The failure mechanism and stability of high-specific-capacity cathode materials for the next generation of LIBs, including nickel-rich cathodes, high-voltage spinel cathodes, and lithium-rich layered cathodes, have attracted extensive research attention. Systematic studies related to the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of different cathodes are crucial to elucidate the instability mechanisms of positive active materials. Factors that these studies must address include the stability under extended electrochemical cycles with respect to dissolution of metal ions in LiPF6-based electrolytes due to HF corrosion of the electrode; cation mixing due to the similarity in radius between Li+ and Ni2+; oxygen evolution when the cathode is charged to a high voltage; the origin of cracks generated during repeated charge/discharge processes arising from the anisotropy of the cell parameters; and electrolyte decomposition when traces of water are present. Regulating the surface nanostructure and bulk crystal lattice of electrode materials is an effective way to meet the demand for cathode materials with high energy density and outstanding stability. Surface modification treatment of positive active materials can slow side reactions and the loss of active material, thereby extending the life of the cathode material and improving the safety of the battery. This review is targeted at the failure mechanisms related to the electrochemical cycle, and a synthetic strategy to ameliorate the properties of cathode surface locations, with the electrochemical performance optimized by accurate surface control. From the perspective of the main stability and safety issues of high-energy cathode materials during the electrochemical cycle, a detailed discussion is presented on the current understanding of the mechanism of performance failure. It is crucial to seek out favorable strategies in response to the failures. Considering the surface structure of the cathode in relation to the stability issue, a newly developed protocol, known as surface-localized doping, which can exist in different states to modify the surface properties of high-energy cathodes, is discussed as a means of ensuring significantly improved stability and safety. Finally, we envision the future challenges and possible research directions related to the stability control of next-generation high-energy cathode materials.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1000-6818			WOS:000614250500004

For a sustainable future, it is essential to explore clean and renewable alternate energy sources. The green energy consumption model aims towards a future with a competent and sustainable hydrogen economy to fulfill the global energy demands. Water-splitting is a promising method for clean hydrogen production. A highly active noble metal-free catalyst is the main pre-requisite, to make the process energy-efficient and economical. An optimum catalyst lowers the energy required for the disassociation of water by driving down the overpotential of the process. Tungsten-based materials are an considered effective catalyst for water-splitting due to natural availability, environmental friendliness, high photostability, high electron mobility, large hole diffusion length and high catalytic activities. In recent years, a diverse range of tungsten-based materials has been developed as photo/electro catalysts for water-splitting. This review aims to present a comprehensive understanding and timely reference for the progress of tungsten-based catalysts in this field. This study begins with the fundamental principle of water splitting and the properties of tungsten and its hybrids then moves on to different techniques for producing binary/ternary nanocomposites for overall water splitting. A comprehensive overview of the recent developments in tungsten-based photo/electro catalysts for overall water splitting is then presented with the techniques to enhance the catalyst activity, such as morphological control, surface modification, heteroatom doping, and heterojunction construction. Finally, recommendations for the future are proposed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000774534600001

Application of conceptual model in sandy aquifers								GROUND WATER				34	5			853	864		10.1111/j.1745-6584.1996.tb02080.x				SEP-OCT 1996	1996	Aqueous geochemical data from unconfined sand aquifers beneath two operating domestic septic systems are used to illustrate and evaluate a conceptual model of septic-system geochemistry, This model emphasizes the changing redox and alkalinity conditions in the septic system and the subsurface, The septic-tank effluents flow as distinct plumes downward through the unsaturated zones and then primarily laterally in the ground-water zones, The composition of the effluent was measured at several points in each system. At each site, the septic-tank effluent underwent aerobic oxidation in the unsaturated zone, which caused conversion of NH4+ to NO3-, organic C to CO2 and organic S to SO42-. At the first site, calcium carbonate dissolution in the unsaturated zone buffered the acidity released by the redox reactions, In contrast, the second system was poorly buffered and the pH dropped from 6.7 to 4.9 as aerobic oxidation occurred, Below the water table a small amount of aerobic oxidation occurred at each site, Nitrate-N concentrations in the cores of both plumes were above 25 mg/l as the plumes traveled from the septic systems, At the second site, the ground-water plume discharges to a river at the edge of the property, As the effluent flowed through the organic C-rich sediments of the river bed, NO3- disappeared and alkalinity increased, presumably due to denitrification. Differences in sediment composition at the two sites also led to different behaviors of Fe, Al, and possibly PO43-. The conceptual model offers an organized approach to interpreting the major geochemical trends observed in the two systems, which are determined mostly by the well-aerated unsaturated zones below the drain fields and the amount of buffering material present in the sediments.									47	2	0	0	28	2	49			0017-467X	1745-6584		WOS:A1996VF56900015

Selectively improving the content of electrochemically active OFGs through multi-step thermal treatment is a promising strategy to enhance the charge storage capability of graphene-based super-capacitor electrodes. In this work, a two-step thermal treatment method was used to produce reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with selectively increasing the content of electrochemically active quinone-type carbonyl groups ((CO)-O-=). The first step is thermal reduction at 500 degrees C in Ar atmosphere, during which GO is exfoliated into separated sheets with porous structure and larger surface area; the second step is air oxidation at 400 degrees C, which facilitates the selective formation of quinone-type (CO)-O-= groups and enhances the mesoporous fraction. Due to the pseudocapacitive behavior of quinone-type (CO)-O-= groups and low ion diffusion resistance, the electrode prepared by RGO exhibits a high specific capacitance of 303 F g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) with excellent rate capability (202 F g(-1) at 10 A g(-1)) and notable cycling performance (similar to 116% capacitance retention after 1500 cycling at 1 A g(-1)). The present work proposed a facile and environmentally friendly two-step thermal treatment strategy in effectively controlling the surface property and microstructure of graphene materials, which has significant implications for mass producing graphene materials for supercapacitor electrodes.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000647563000002

The results were analyzed by using X-ray diffractometry, thermal analysis, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry. The presence of coreeshell configuration of Cu2O nanoparticles with the thickness of the non-crystalline surface shell of about 1.0 nm associated with partial oxidation of Cu2O was evident. By calcining the precursor in the temperature range of 300-800 degrees C for 4 h under Ar flow, CuO and CuAl2O4 were observed as main phases. At 900 degrees C, CuAlO2 became a main phase. At 1100 degrees C, CuAlO2 delafossite with a small admixture of alpha-Al2O3 was observed. Paramagnetism was observed on our CuAlO2 at room temperature with a weak ferromagnetism. In the 10 min activated mixture, a contamination with Fe was detected. A unique weak ferromagnetic feature of CuAlO2 may be associated with the structural paramagnetic Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions. Antiferromagnetic short-range-order was developed below 60 K. This was ascribed to the mixed state of Cu+ and Cu2+ in the Cu-O sub-lattice with a high amount of oxygen vacancies, similar to the states in the Cu2-xO. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Ho, CW; Horwitz, JL; Wilson, GR								Dynamics of the H+ and O+ polar wind in the transition region as influenced by ionospheric convection and electron heating								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS				102	A1			395	406		10.1029/96JA02986				JAN 1 1997	1997	We have conducted a set of systematic generalized semikinetic simulations to study the polar H+/O+ upflows in the ionosphere and transition region as influenced by varying convection. Effects of both frictional ion heating and centrifugal acceleration are included. We find that in regions where the convection electric field is strong (E(i) greater than or equal to 100 mV/m) the steady state polar wind may be characterized as primarily a centrifugally accelerated O+ outflow together with an ambipolar H+ outflow, as a minor component, up to 4 R(E) geocentric distance. Owing to the increase in the O+ upward flow speed, the increase in the O+ density, and the decrease in the H+ flow speed, H+-O+ collisions are important to extended altitudes during enhanced convection periods. The exobase (defined here as the altitude where the O+ scale height is equal to the mean free path of an H+ ion with a speed three thermal speeds larger than the H+ bulk speed) shifts from 1900 km for E(i) = 0 mV/m to 3000 km for E(i) = 100 mV/m. For the range of convection electric fields considered here (E(i) 0 mV/m to E(i) = 100 mV/m), we identify an upper and a lower transition region which coincide roughly with the region of downward and upward H+ heat flux, respectively. A set of relationships between ion parallel speeds and normalized collisional mean free paths was found which are associated with the maximum upward and downward heat flux, regardless of the value of E(i), for steady state conditions. We find that the heated and centrifugally accelerated O+ ions can obtain upward bulk velocities of 5 km/s above 3 R(E) geocentric distance for E(i) greater than or equal to 80 mV/m. These ions exert a large downward drag on the H+ ions which stretches out the tail on the lower velocity side of the distribution creating large downward heat fluxes. These effects may explain features of the large downward heat fluxes observed in the H+ distributions to large altitude by the retarding ion mass spectrometer (RIMS) instrument on DE 1. We have also considered impulsive events, consisting of pulses of cleft associated enhanced convection and elevated electron temperatures, followed by convection across the polar cap. These result in O+ ions falling back into the ionosphere on the dayside and nightside [e.g., Horwitz and Lockwood, 1985]. Downward speeds of 1-2 km/s are seen up to several thousand kilometers altitude which is consistent with DE 1/RIMS observations as presented by Chandler [1995].									13	1	0	0	0	0	13						WOS:A1997WA69200036

The nitrogenase activity of this strain was detected based on its acetylene-reducing activity under low oxygen concentrations (2-4%). An analysis of the genes responsible for nitrogen fixation in this strain, nifH and nifD, indicated a close relationship to those of Pseudomonas stutzeri A15 (A1501). Sequence similarity searches based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain 6H33b(T) belongs within the genus Pseudomonas sensu stricto; closest similarity was with Pseudomonas indica (97.3%). A comparison of several taxonomic characteristics of 6H33b(T) with those of P. indica and some type strains of the genus Pseudomonas sensu stricto indicated that 6H33b(T) could be distinguished from P. indica based on the presence of nitrogen fixation ability, the absence of nitrate reduction and denitrification abilities and the utilization of some sugars and organic acids. Phylogenetic analyses and the results of DNA-DNA hybridization experiments also indicated that strain 6H33b(T) represents a species distinct from P. indica. From these results, it is proposed that strain 6H33b(T) (=ATCC BAA-1049(T)=JCM 12708(T)) is classified as the type strain of a novel species of the genus Pseudomonas sensu stricto under the name Pseudomonas azotifigens sp. nov.									41	0	0	0	38	5	44			1466-5026	1466-5034		WOS:000230828200022	16014478

We mainly focus on one model, "c3_ 3d_ 256_ 10s", for which the hydrodynamics (Ropke 2005, A&A, 432, 969) and nucleosynthesis (Travaglio et al. 2004, A&A, 425, 1029) was calculated up to the homologous phase of the explosion. Other models with different ignition conditions and different resolution are also briefly discussed. The synthetic spectra are compared to observed late time spectra. We find that while the model spectra after 300 to 500 days show a good agreement with the observed Fe II-III features, they also show too strong O I and C I lines compared to the observed late time spectra. The oxygen and carbon emission originates from the low-velocity unburned material in the central regions of these models. To get agreement between the models and observations we find that only a small mass of unburned material may be left in the center after the explosion. This may be a problem for pure deflagration models, although improved initial conditions, as well as higher resolution decrease the discrepancy. The relative intensity from the different ionization stages of iron is sensitive to the density of the emitting iron-rich material. We find that clumping, with the presence of low density regions, is needed to reproduce the observed iron emission, especially in the range between 4000 and 6000 angstrom. Both temperature and ionization depend sensitively on density, abundances and radioactive content. This work therefore illustrates the importance of including the inhomogeneous nature of realistic three-dimensional explosion models. We briefly discuss the implications of the spectral modeling for the nature of the explosion.									94	2	1	0	0	0	95			1432-0746			WOS:000230210100024

It has been estimated that this THI4 turnover consumes 2% to 12% of the maintenance energy budget and that installing an energy-efficient alternative pathway could substantially increase crop yield potential. Available data point to two natural alternatives to the suicidal THI4 pathway: (i) nonsuicidal prokaryotic THI4s that lack the active-site Cys residue on which suicide activity depends, and (ii) an uncharacterized thiazole synthesis pathway in flowers of the tropical arum lily Caladium bicolor that enables production and emission of large amounts of the cThz-P analog 4-methyl-5-vinylthiazole (MVT). We used functional complementation of an Escherichia coli Delta thiG strain to identify a nonsuicidal bacterial THI4 (from Thermovibrio ammonificans) that can function in conditions like those in plant cells. We explored whether C. bicolor synthesizes MVT de novo via a novel route, via a suicidal or a nonsuicidal THI4, or by catabolizing thiamin. Analysis of developmental changes in MVT emission, extractable MVT, thiamin level, and THI4 expression indicated that C. bicolor flowers make MVT de novo via a massively expressed THI4 and that thiamin is not involved. Functional complementation tests indicated that C. bicolor THI4, which has the active-site Cys needed to operate suicidally, may be capable of suicidal and - in hypoxic conditions - nonsuicidal operation. T. ammonificans and C. bicolor THI4s are thus candidate parts for rational redesign or directed evolution of efficient, nonsuicidal THI4s for use in crop improvement.									13	0	0	0	13	0	13			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000459688800016	30337452

Its strong organic load and its toxicity due to the presence of complex phenolic compounds have dire effects when applied to soil. To overcome this difficulty, the OMW pretreatment was investigated in the present work using the Fenton oxidation reaction with zero-valent iron. Then, this pretreated wastewater was valorized in fertigation practice. The effects of the addition of different concentrations of both treated and raw OMW on soil and cropping system were investigated. The treatment by Fenton oxidation with zero-valent iron could reduce 50 % of COD and decrease 53 % of phenolic compounds. OMW application had a temporary effect on the soil pH and EC. The results showed that the evolution of soil pH and EC was related to the organic matter of the soil which depends on the spread concentrations of raw or treated OMW. After 15-day incubation period, the soil pH and EC tended to stabilize and return to the control level. Moreover, this stabilization is faster in treated OMW than that in raw OMW especially for concentrations as high as 3 and 4 %. Plants cultivated with treated OMW showed an increase in their germination. The results pointed an improvement in the stem length of plants which is almost similar to that of the control for both pea and tomato, especially for high concentrations of 3 and 4 %.

This rational core/shell design method provide a uniform Ni-MOF shell thickness (shell: ~ 10 nm) as well as homogeneous wrapping of pDA templates with quite narrow size distributions. The obtained band properties of bare pDA (E-CB=-0.35 eV and E-VB = 2.95 eV vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) and bare Ni-MOF (E-CB=-0.49 eV and E-VB = 2.85 eV vs NHE) clearly revealed charge separation is occurred on pDA by absorbing light due to pi-pi* transition, and photogenerated electrons on conduction band (CB) of pDA was migrated to CB of Ni-MOF. Specifically, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water performance of pDA@Ni-MOF photo anodes with highest current density is recorded as 8.61 mA/cm(2) at 0.77 V vs. RHE under visible LED irradiation, which is significantly higher than bare pDA (0.008 V vs. RHE) and bare Ni-MOF (0.011 V vs. RHE) at the same conditions. Note that, the higher photon absorption properties of pDA in core together with high interaction valence bond between two semiconductors could generate electron rich state giving rise to faster electron transfer kinetics as next generation of MOF based hybrid materials with regular morphologies.

Bulletin of the World Health Organization				19	4			637	59						1958	1958	The ecology of freshwater snails-in particular those which act as intermediate hosts of bilharziasis-is reviewed in the light of the much more extensive knowledge available on the breeding-places of anopheline mosquitos. Experimental ecological methods are recommended for the field and laboratory investigation of a number of common problems involved in the study of snail habitats and mosquito breeding-places. Among the environmental factors discussed are temperature, oxygen concentration, water movement, pollution and salinity. Sampling methods for estimating populations of both snails and mosquito larvae are also described. An attempt is made to show how malacologists and entomologists alike would benefit from improved facilities for keeping abreast of general developments in the wider field of freshwater ecology.									9	0	0	0	6	0	10			0042-9686			MEDLINE:13596888	13596888

Photocatalytic antibacterial, an effective strategy relying on exogenous excitation, has drawn increasing attention over the past decades, owing to its controllable, safe, and non-invasive characteristics. Many photoresponsive agents have been developed. With exceptional features of abundance, facile synthesis, suitable band structure, high stability, and low toxicity, metal-free polymeric two-dimensional nanomaterial graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is an attractive photosensitizer for antibiotic-free antibacterial application. In this review, the basic structural characteristics and preparation methods of g-C3N4 are summarized. The photocatalytic antibacterial mechanism of g-C3N4 through reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is also discussed. In order to achieve more precise and efficient antibacterial effects, we pay special attention to two aspects: (1) how to increase the utilization of visible light and reduce the recombination of electron-hole pairs, thereby enhancing the production of ROS; and (2) how to obtain effective bacteria-killing activity while maintaining good biocompatibility and environmental friendliness, which determines the practical applications of materials. Several significant modification strategies are thus introduced, including structure design, surface modification, element doping, and construction of g-C3N4-based heterojunctions. Furthermore, various typical examples of combining the photocatalytic antibacterial effect of g-C3N4 with other strategies to exert good synergistic effects are summarized. Lastly, the potential challenges and perspectives are offered. This review is expected to inspire more follow-up work to design high-performance g-C3N4-based materials for photocatalytic antibacterial application.									63	3	0	0	17	0	64			0927-796X	1879-212X		WOS:000669232000001

In this work, a facile and template free reflux method has been used to synthesize ZnO nanostructures for the morphology control of cubes, maize corn seeds, and rods at low temperature. The photocatalytic activity of ZnO with different morphology was evaluated towards degradation of methyl orange under UV light illumination. Among all the morphology controlled ZnO, the maize corn seed shaped ZnO shows the superior photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the influence of Cu contents on the structural, optical, and photocatalytic activity of ZnO maize corn seed was also investigated systematically. The photocatalytic experiment towards the degradation of methyl orange revealed that the 0.5 mol% Cu doped ZnO exhibits 3.5 fold higher photocatalytic activity than pure corn seed shaped ZnO. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity by Cu ions substituting in ZnO lattices is attributed to synergetic effect of Cu and ZnO, increase the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, oxygen vacancy, decrease in crystallite size and the higher surface to volume ratio. Based on scavengers test, it was found that both superoxide and hydroxyl radicals are mainly actives species involved for the degradation of methyl orange. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Ag2O/Si codoped glasses were prepared in a barium-phosphate matrix by a simple melt-quench method in ambient atmosphere. The as-prepared glasses exhibit enhanced UV transparency, whereby the surface plasmon resonance of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) is manifested for the glasses with higher Ag2O contents. P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is consistent with the formation of P-O-Si bonds, thus suggesting their possible role on the improved UV light transmission. Consequently, a model was presented accounting for the influence of silicon on the polymerization of the phosphate network concomitant with the creation of highly reactive oxygen species. Further exploiting the proposed reactive species, a real-time spectroscopic study of the plasmonic response of Ag NPs in Ag/Si codoped glass samples was carried out during an in situ thermal processing. The temperature dependence of the Ag particle precipitation was studied in the 400 degrees C-430 degrees C range, from which an Arrhenius-type plot allowed for estimating the activation energy of the process at 3.42 (+/- 0.38) eV. Ultimately, the vanishing of the luminescence ascribed to Ag+ ions was observed in a heat-treated sample, consistent with the high reactivity acquired by the glass matrix. Silicon thus appears promising for producing UV transparent glasses for high-performance optics and for the reduction of Ag+ ions to produce Ag nanocomposites valuable for photonic (nanoplasmonic) applications.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000393862800015

The as-synthesized photocatalysts were characterized by XRD, BET, FESEM, EDX, FTIR, PL, and UV-vis techniques. Based on the FESEM, EDX and BET techniques, higher dispersion of Ti species and an increased accessibility of the micro-channels could be achieved using modified Clinoptilolite supports due to their better textural properties. The fine dispersion of TiO2 particles reflects higher surface density of active sites and separation efficiency of electron hole pairs, which accounts for their better photocatalytic performance. The characterization results generally indicated the remarkable synergetic effect of alkaline treatment on the surface morphology and TiO2 dispersion, especially when it is coupled with NH4NO3 treatment. The photocatalytic tests illustrated that employing the treated Clinoptilolite supports increases the photocatalytic activity up to 12-57%. It was found that TiO2 supported on the alkaline Clinoptilolite followed by NH4NO3 treatment effectively splitted water to hydrogen by 896.8 mu mol g(TiO2)(-1) h(-1) hydrogen production rate. The results indicate that the ion exchange-alkaline treatment of Clinoptilolite could provide strong basic sites and mesopore structure (average pore diameter of 21.65 nm) with high surface area (73.43 m(2) g(-1)) and well dispersion ability to improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2/Clinoptilolite composite for hydrogen evolution.

The graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) unable to demonstrate significant water splitting activity because it cannot reach the above requirements. In such a way, we adopted the doping concept to enhance the physical, chemical, and water splitting activity of the g-C3N4 nanostructure. Therefore, the controllability of Sr incorporation into g-C3N4 leads to the enhanced water splitting activity, which was attributed to the evolution in the structural, morphological, and optical properties. In addition, the spectroscopy analysis was distinctively used to reveal the incorporation of Sr2+ into the g-C3N4 host lattice. The impedance analysis demonstrated the promising charge carrier kinetics under strategic Sn doping. The gentle doping of Sr (0.4 mol%) into g-C3N4 exhibited considerable improvement in the photocurrent generation, which is similar to 82 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. In a word, the improved photoelectrochemical performance can be ascribed to the synergistic effects of extended light absorption, enhanced charge carrier generation, separation, transportation, and development of additional active sites.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000659174100001

ABUNDANCE PATTERNS BASED ON ECHELLE SPECTRA OF 40 RED GIANTS								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				447	2			680	705		10.1086/175909				JUL 10 1995	1995	Abundances of some 20 elements have been determined for a (biased) sample of 40 red giants having M(v) < -1.5 in the chemically inhomogeneous globular cluster omega Centauri. The results are based on high-resolution, high signal-to-noise echelle spectra and permit one to examine the roles of primordial enrichment and stellar evolutionary mixing effects in the cluster. Our basic conclusions are as follows (1) There is an abundance range -1.8 < [Fe/H] < -0.8, and even more metal rich stars may exist in the cluster. (2) For the alpha (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) and iron peak (Cr, Ni) elements and Sc and V, [metal/Fe] is flat as a function of [Fe/H] and is consistent with primordial enrichment from stars having mass greater than 10 M., as has been found for field halo stars. (3) There is a large scatter in the abundances of C, N, and O. The bulk of the stars have -0.9 < [C/Fe] < -0.3 and [O/Fe] similar to 0.3, as is found at the red giant branch tip in other ''normal'' (showing no spread in [Fe/H]) clusters of similar abundance, while there also exists a group of CN-strong stars having [C/Fe] similar to -0.7 and [O/Fe] similar to -0.5. Nitrogen appears to be enhanced in all of these carbon-depleted stars. These results are most readily explained in terms of evolutionary mixing effects not predicted by standard stellar evolution calculations and are consistent with the earlier suggestions of Cohen & Bell (1986) and Paltoglou & Norris (1989) concerning processing in both the CN and ON cycles in the stars being observed. In contrast, the group of CO-strong stars first identified by Persson et al. (1980) has [C/Fe] similar to 0.0, [O/Fe] - 0.4, and [N/Fe] similar to 0.4 (or 0.9 if the nitrogen scale of Brown and Wallerstein is correct) and is suggestive of primordial enrichment of carbon and/or nitrogen from intermediate- and possibly low-mass stars, tempered by later stellar evolutionary effects. (4) [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe] are anticorrelated with [O/Fe], and there is a positive correlation between [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe], all of which are most readily explained in terms of evolutionary mixing effects as first suggested by Denisenkov and Denisenkova (1990). Such an explanation is supported by the similar ([Na/Fe], [O/Fe]) anticorrelation reported by Kraft et al. (1993) in the ''normal'' globular clusters. (5) For the heavy neutron-addition elements (in particular Y, Ba, La, and Nd) [heavy metal/Fe] rises as [Fe/H] increases, in sharp contrast with what is found in the ''normal'' clusters, while the relative abundances as a function of atomic number are suggestive of s-processing. The increase in [heavy metal/Fe] with [Fe/H] appears independent of the abundance of C, N, O, Na and Al and is most naturally explained as a primordial effect. Guided by the predictions of existing (somewhat uncertain) stellar evolution calculations, we suggest that this results from primordial enrichment from stars having mass as low as 1-3 M.. (6) If the preceding suggestion is correct, chemical enrichment in omega Cen occurred over an extended period, perhaps greater than or equal to 1 Gyr.									298	0	0	0	1	1	298			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:A1995RF78800020

Here, we are the first to demonstrate the in situ hydrothermal growth of NiCo2S4 nanosheets on g-C3N4 surfaces to construct a "sheet-on-sheet" heterostructure. The as-prepared NiCo2S4/CN heterostructured nanohybrid exhibits remarkably enhanced rates of visible-light-driven photocatalytic H-2 evolution without using a noble metal cocatalyst, such as Pt. Notably, the optimum loading of NiCo2S4 nanosheets is 10 wt%, providing the best H-2 performance rate of 293.4 mu molh(-1)g(-1), which is approximately 7 times higher than that of the single-component bulk CN. This result suggested that the improved photocatalytic activity can be primarily ascribed to the efficient interfacial transfer of the photogenerated charge pairs from CN to the NiCo2S4 nanosheets. These nanosheets serve as temporary electron reservoirs, resulting in a reduced charge recombination rate on the CN surfaces and increasing the amount of photogenerated charge pairs in the NiCo2S4 nanosheets. Furthermore, the increased potential of reactive surface sites, together with the extended light absorption range after the introduction of NiCo2S4 nanosheets on the CN substrate, may also play a certain role in improving the photocatalytic performance. This study reveals a promising and efficient route for using CN-based photocatalysts incorporated with a ternary transition metal sulfide cocatalyst, which have been prepared by the nanoarchitecture engineering of noble metal-free heterostructured interfaces for use in renewable energy production.

The evolution of the main physical quantities of a model during a pulse cycle is examined in detail. From selected models in the mass range M-WD = 0.52-0.68 M., we derive the borders in the M-WD-(M) over dot plane of the steady state accretion regime when hydrogen is burned at a constant rate as rapidly as it is accreted. The physical properties during a hydrogen shell flash in white dwarfs accreting hydrogen-rich matter with metallicities Z = 0.001 and Z = 0.0001 are also studied. For a fixed accretion rate, a decrease in the metallicity of the accreted matter leads to an increase in the thickness of the hydrogen-rich layer at outburst and a decrease in the hydrogen-burning shell efficiency. In the M-WD-(M) over dot plane, the borders of the steady state accretion band are critically dependent on the metallicity of the accreted matter: on decreasing the metallicity, the band is shifted to lower accretion rates and its width in (M) over dot is reduced.									31	0	0	0	0	0	31			0004-637X			WOS:000087789500037

Data for the stable S-32 nucleus were also obtained at 53 MeV/A for comparison. A phenomenological analysis was used to deduce the deformation parameters beta (p,p') for the low-lying collective excitations. A microscopic analysis was performed by generating matter and transition densities from self-consistent QRPA calculations. Configuration mixing calculations based on a collective Bohr Hamiltonian were also performed. DWBA and coupled-channel calculations using microscopic optical potentials built from these densities and the JLM interaction are compared to the data. There is no indication for the presence of proton skins in these nuclei. The microscopic calculations are extended to the even-even sulfur and argon isotopes from A = 30 to A = 40, and A = 34 to A = 44, respectively, and compared to available experimental results. On the basis of this analysis predictions are made for the S-42,S-44 and Ar-46 nuclei concerning ground state and transition densities. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here we use new and previously published isotopic data of presolar SiC and Al2O3 grains to constrain the Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) of Si, Ti, and O isotopic ratios. The C-12/C-13 ratios of the SiC grains limit the amount of He-shell material mixed to the surface of the parent AGE stars during third dredge-up to a few percent. Thus, the linear correlations observed between the SiC Si and Ti isotopic ratios probably reflect the average GCE trends of these elements. Moreover, the close proximity of these trends to the solar isotopic composition indicates that the latter cannot be very unusual for these elements. A chi(2) fit to the SiC isotopic data has allowed us to accurately estimate the relative GCE paths for the Si and Ti isotopes. The fit estimates the nucleosynthetic components of the grains' compositions, the metallicities of their parent stars, and the mean GCE paths of the isotopes. For most of the isotopes, our results agree remarkably well with the GCE calculations of Timmes, Woosley, & Weaver and Timmes & Clayton after they are corrected to pass through solar. However, the abundances of both Si-30 and Ti-47 in the fit increase significantly more slowly with metallicity, relative to the other isotopes, than predicted by the corrected GCE model. Conversely, Ti-49 increases more rapidly in the fit than predicted. These discrepancies probably reflect errors in the supernova models used to calculate the GCE paths. Our fit also suggests that the typical ISM at solar metallicity is enriched in Si-29 and Si-30 (by similar to 8% and similar to 5%, respectively) relative to solar. The GCE of the O isotopes cannot yet be so well constrained, but the Al2O3 data are most consistent with a GCE path that passes close to solar rather than one that is O-18 depleted as suggested by measurements of molecular clouds. The inferred depletion of Si-29 and Si-30 in the Sun could be explained by the addition or removal of a small amount of supernova material. However, we can probably rule out a supernova explanation for the apparent enrichment of solar O relative to young stars and the local ISM and O-18 relative to molecular clouds.									68	0	0	0	1	0	68			0004-637X			WOS:000081177600021

The pressure-temperature conditions of boninite origins in the mantle wedge sources. The pressure-temperature conditions of boninite origins in the mantle wedge are important to understanding subduction zone initiation and subsequent evolution. Reaction experiments at 1.5 GPa (1350-1530 degrees C), 2 GPa (1400-1600 degrees C) and 2.5 GPa (1450-1530 degrees C) between a model primary high-Ca boninite magma composition and a refractory harzburgite under anhydrous and H2O-undersaturated conditions (2-3 wt % H2O in the melt) have been completed. The boninite composition was modelled on melt inclusions occurring in the most magnesian olivine phenocrysts in high-Ca boninites from the Northern Tongan forearc and the Upper Pillow Lavas of the Troodos ophiolite. Direct melting experiments on a model refractory lherzolite and a harzburgite composition at 1.5 GPa under anhydrous conditions (1400-1600 degrees C) have also been completed. Experiments establish a P, T 'melting grid' for refractory harzburgite at 1.5, 2 and 2.5 GPa and in the presence of 2-3 wt % H2O. The effect of 2-3 wt % dissolved H2O produces a liquidus depression in primary boninite of similar to 112 +/- 19 degrees C at a given temperature. The H2O-bearing melts, recalculated to 100 wt % anhydrous, are similar to 2-6 wt % higher in MgO, similar to 1-2 wt % higher in SiO2 and similar to 1-1.5 wt % lower in FeO, compared with nominally anhydrous melts at the same P and T. These differences are consistent with a change in the melting reaction, resulting in a higher contribution of orthopyroxene to the melt phase, compared with anhydrous conditions. We conclude that high-Ca boninite petrogenesis requires temperatures as high as similar to 1480 degrees C at depths of similar to 45 km in the mantle wedge; these are constraints for any proposed model of intra-oceanic subduction zones. A comparison of the results from the boninite-harzburgite reaction experiments with the direct melting experiments on refractory lherzolite and harzburgite indicates that the influence of subduction components (included in the composition of the added model boninite) is to cause high-pressure melting cotectics to move towards the olivine apex (i.e. to relatively higher pressures) of the molecular normative projection from diopside onto the base of the 'basalt tetrahedron' [Jd + CaTs + Lc-Qz-Ol] compared with anhydrous melting of normal mantle in the absence of a subduction component. The subduction component involved in high-Ca boninite petrogenesis in addition to H2O has relatively high Al2O2 and Na2O contents. The experimental data from this and other studies empirically quantify the absolute effect of dissolved H2O (0.2-21 wt %) on the liquidus depression of olivine-saturated basaltic melts with similar to <3 wt % total alkalis as follows:olivine liquidus depression (degrees C) = 74.403 x H2O wt %)(0.352).The equation that describes this empirical relationship in non-linear with an error of similar to 9 relative percent.									318	28	6	0	4	1	337			0022-3530			WOS:000084938200004

It is necessary to determine the viral agents and their frequency of presentation to understand their impact on transplantation patients' evolution. Methods: From January 2017 to December 2019. we conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive, and observational study of patients who underwent HSCT with a viral respiratory infection. Viral identification was performed using multiplex polymerase chain reaction for nine respiratory viruses. Descriptive statistics were performed with a report of central tendency measures and percentages. Results: Of the 54 pediatric patients who underwent HSCT, 59.2% presented an airway infection: in turn, at least one viral agent was identified in 59.3% of these patients. The most frequent viral agents were influenza (25.9%), human rhinovirus (18.5%), and respiratory syncytial virus (18.5%). Viral co-infections occurred in 36.8% of the cases. The reported complications were supplemental oxygen requirement (73.6%), support with mechanical ventilation (21%), admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (15.7%), and mortality associated with a viral respiratory infection (10.5%). Conclusions: Viral respiratory infections are frequent in pediatric patients with HSCT influenza A/B virus was the most frequent agent. As morbidity and mortality increase due to these infections in patients with HSCT, strategies are necessary for its prevention and timely treatment after transplantation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0539-6115	1665-1146		WOS:000659983800004	34167143	
J	MARKGRAF, T; OELMULLER, R								EVIDENCE THAT CAROTENOIDS ARE REQUIRED FOR THE ACCUMULATION OF A FUNCTIONAL PHOTOSYSTEM-II, BUT NOT PHOTOSYSTEM-I IN THE COTYLEDONS OF MUSTARD SEEDLINGS								PLANTA				185	1			97	104						1991	1991	If Norflurazon-treated mustard (Sinapis alba L.) seedlings are grown in low-fluence-rate white light, accumulation of carotenoids is completely inhibited, while levels of chlorophyll (Chl) a and b are comparable to those of control seedlings. Measurements of fluorescence yield and oxygen evolution indicate that carotenoid-free, green cotyledons are unable to perform leephotosynthesis in vivo. When thylakoid membranes were prepared and electron transport was measured in vitro, only PSI but not PSII activity was detected. Solubilization of the photosystems from thylakoid membranes and separation by sucrose-gradient centrifugation confirmed that PSII is absent in carotenoid-free seedlings, while PSI is present. Western blot analysis for representative proteins of the four photosynthetic complexes showed that subunits 1 and 2 of PSI, the Rieske-iron sulfur-protein, the alpha-subunit of the CF1 moiety of the ATP-synthase complex, cytochrome b559 and the lumenal 33-kDa protein of the water-splitting apparatus of PSII are present in comparable amounts in Norflurazon-treated and control plants, while the amounts of Chl-binding proteins of PSII (the major light-harvesting Chl-a/b-binding protein of the antenna complex and the 51- and 44-kDa Chl-a-binding proteins) and two components of the PSII reaction center, (the D1 and D2 protein) are substantially reduced. The data indicate that accumulation of PSII polypeptides is either not inhibited or not completely inhibited in carotenoid-free mustard seedlings, but that assembly of a functional PSII complex does not occur. If Norflurazon-treated seedlings are transferred to water, lutein accumulates rapidly and reaches about 80% of the level detectable in control plants, while the level of other carotenoids is still less than 1%. The accumulation kinetics for lutein are similar to the kinetics for the appearance of PSII activity. This indicates that the availability of lutein rather than that of other carotenoids might be rate-limiting for the appearance of PSII activity.									44	1	0	0	40	0	45			0032-0935			WOS:A1991GA88000014	24186285	
J	Ge, Jinyi; Huang, Guangqun; Li, Junbao; Han, Lujia					Ge, Jinyi/0000-0003-2424-8740			Particle-scale visualization of the evolution of methanogens and methanotrophs and its correlation with CH4 emissions during manure aerobic composting								WASTE MANAGEMENT				78				135	143		10.1016/j.wasman.2018.05.045				AUG 2018	2018	Methane (CH4) emissions are a major environmental concern in composting facilities. Therefore, this study initially visualized the dynamic distribution and quantity of methanogens and methanotrophs in composting particles during manure aerobic composting using fluorescence in situ hybridization-confocal laser scanning microscopy (FISH-CLSM) and quantified their correlation with CH4 emissions. The visualization results showed that methanogens existed inside the particles, while methanotrophs clustered in the outer layer; a facultative anaerobic zone existed in between. The quantification results of integral optical density of methanogens and methanotrophs per unit particle area (U-ger, and U-oxi, respectively) indicated that, in the cooling phase, CH4 generation and oxidation could still be high and could strike a balance if the initial organic matter content of composting materials is high, while both could be extremely low if the content is low. A strong linearity between U-gen obtained by FISH-CLSM and methyl-coenzyme M reductase copy number obtained by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis (R-2 = 0.88) was observed, which justified the effectiveness of the FISH-CLSM method and demonstrated that macro-scale CH4 emissions were essentially an accumulation of particle-scale CH4 emissions. CH4 emissions were equal to 3.3297 x 10(7) U-ger, - 3.1814 x 10(6) U-oxi - 3902.9900 (R-2 = 0.98). Overall, the results showed that methanogens exerted more influence on CH4 emissions than methanotrophs. Combining these results with CH4-generation and -oxidation kinetics may help illustrate CH4-emission mechanisms, improve particle-scale CH4-emission models, and thereby provide theoretical guidance for operation optimization and emission reduction in composting processes.

Not surprisingly, many intracellular pathogens have evolved mechanisms to overcome macrophage defenses, using these immune cells as residences and dissemination strategies. With pathogenic infections causing increasing detriments to both aquacultural and wild fish populations, it is imperative to garner greater understanding of fish phagocyte antimicrobial responses and the mechanisms by which aquatic pathogens are able to overcome these teleost macrophage barriers. Insights into the regulation of macrophage immunity of bony fish species will lend to the development of more effective aquacultural prophylaxis as well as broadening our understanding of the evolution of these immune processes. Accordingly, this review focuses on recent advances in the understanding of teleost macrophage antimicrobial responses and the strategies by which intracellular fish pathogens are able to avoid being killed by phagocytes, with a focus on Mycobacterium marinum.

The comparisons between the Franck-Condon factor simulated spectra and the measured photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) of Cui and co-workers help to search for the ground-state structures. The results showed that D-2 molecule tends to be dissociated on aluminum clusters and forms the radial Al-D bond with one aluminum atom. By studying the evolution of the binding energies, second difference energies and HOMO-LUMO gaps as a function of cluster size, we found Al2D2, Al6D2 and Al7D2 clusters have the stronger relative stability and enhanced chemical stability. Also, considering the larger adsorption energies of these three clusters, we surmised that Al-2, Al-6 and Al-7 may be the better candidates for dissociative adsorption of D-2 molecule among the clusters we studied. Furthermore, the natural population analysis (NPA) and difference electron density were performed and discussed to probe into the localization of the charges and reliable charge-transfer information in AlnD2 and AlnD2 clusters.

J	Lukens, WW; Bucher, JJ; Shuh, DK; Edelstein, NM								Evolution of technetium speciation in reducing grout								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				39	20			8064	8070		10.1021/es050155c				OCT 15 2005	2005	Cementitious waste forms (CWFs) are an important component of the strategy to stabilize nuclear waste resulting from plutonium production by the U. S. Department of Energy. Technetium (Tc-99) is an abundant fission product of particular concern in CWFs because of the high solubility and mobility of Tc(VII), pertechnetate (TcO4-), the stable form of technetium in aerobic environments. CWFs can more effectively stabilize 99Tc if they contain additives that chemically reduce mobile TcO4- to immobile Tc(IV) species. The 99Tc leach rate of reducing CWFs that contain Tc(IV) is much lower than that for CWFs that contain TcO4-, Previous X-ray absorption fine structure studies showed that Tc(IV) species were oxidized to TcO4- in reducing grout samples prepared on a laboratory scale. Whether the oxidizer was atmospheric O-2 or NO3- in the waste simulant was not determined. In actual CWFs, rapid oxidation of Tc(IV) by NO3- would be of concern, whereas oxidation by atmospheric O-2 would be of less concern due to the slow diffusion and reaction Of 02 with the reducing CWF. To address this uncertainty, two series of reducing grouts were prepared using TcO4- containing waste simulants with and without NO3-, In the first series of samples, referred to as "permeable samples", the TcO4- was completely reduced using Na2S, and the samples were sealed in cuvettes made of polystyrene, which has a relatively large O-2 diffusion coefficient. In these samples, all of the technetium was initially present as a Tc(IV) sulfide compound, TcSx, which was characterized by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. The EXAFS data is consistent with a structure consisting of triangular clusters of Tc(IV) centers linked together through a combination of disulfide and sulfide bridges as in MoS3. From the EXAFS model, the stoichionnetry of TcSx is Tc3S10, which is presumably the compound generally referred to as "Tc2S7". The TcSx initially present in the permeable samples was steadily oxidized over 4 years. In the second series of samples, called "impermeable samples", the TcO4- was not initially completely reduced, and the grout samples were sealed in cuvettes made of poly(methyl methacrylate), which has a small O-2 diffusion coefficient. In the impermeable samples, the remaining TcO4- continued to be reduced, presumably by blast furnace slag in the grout, as the samples aged. When the impermeable samples were opened and exposed to atmosphere, the lower-valent technetium species were rapidly oxidized to TcO4-.									68	0	0	0	27	0	68			0013-936X			WOS:000232758400047	16295876

Cell growth was continuous and three phases were found regarding accumulation of intermediates: (1) glucose was largely converted to gluconate and 2-ketogluconate, (2) then gluconate was converted to 2-ketogluconate and (3) the latter was consumed after gluconate depletion. Examination of growth kinetics and yields showed that glucose flux was mainly oriented to oxidation reduction in the periplasm and less towards biosynthesis. Values of respiratory quotient and of CO2/biomass and O-2/biomass yields were characteristic of each phase. Main enzymatic activities involved in the use of these substrates were always detected meaning that concomitant assimilation is possible. However the levels of these activities varied during growth. Membrane conversions seem to have a significant energetic contribution explaining the higher specific growth rate obtained in glucose phase compared to gluconate and 2-ketogluconate ones. This is also noticeable through the evolution of the yields Y-O2/X and Y-CO2/X. Although the three convergent pathways are operational and can be genetically controlled, the progression of the culture in successive phases highlights an overall level of regulation in response to the energetic needs.									20	0	0	0	17	0	20			0302-8933	1432-072X		WOS:000257588900004	18493743

In this work, we study thermal oxidation of pristine Ni nanoparticles ranging from 4 to 50 nm in 1 bar 1%O-2/N-2 at 600 degrees C using in situ gas-cell environmental transmission electron microscopy. Real-space in situ oxidation videos revealed an unexpected nanoparticle surface refacetting before oxidation and a strong Ni nanoparticle size dependence, leading to distinct structural development during the oxidation and different final NiO morphology. By quantifying the NiO thickness/volume change in real space, individual nanoparticle-level oxidation kinetics was established and directly correlated with nanoparticle microstructural evolution with specified fast and slow oxidation directions. Thus, for the size-dependent Ni nanoparticle oxidation, we propose a unified oxidation theory with a two-stage oxidation process: stage 1: dominated by the early NiO nucleation (Avrami-Erofeev model) and stage 2: the Wagner diffusion-balanced NiO shell thickening (Wanger model). In particular, to what extent the oxidation would proceed into stage 2 dictates the final NiO morphology, which depends on the Ni starting radius with respect to the critical thickness under given oxidation conditions. The overall oxidation duration is controlled by both the diffusivity of Ni2+ in NiO and the Ni in Ni self-diffusion. We also compare the single-particle kinetic curve with the collective one and discuss the effects of nanoparticle size differences on kinetic model analysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000813163800001	35413193

The disease spectrum of EV-D68 infections in children with underlying medical conditions other than asthma, the role of EV-D68 loads on clinical illness, and the variation of EV-D68 strains within the same institution over time have not been described. We sought to define the association between EV-D68 loads and sequence variation, and the clinical characteristic in hospitalized children at our institution from 2011 to 2014.MethodsMay through November 2014, and August to September 2011 to 2013, a convenience sample of nasopharyngeal specimens from children with rhinovirus (RV)/EV respiratory infections were tested for EV-D68 by RT-PCR. Clinical data were compared between children with RV/EV-non-EV-D68 and EV-D68 infections, and among children with EV-D68 infections categorized as healthy, asthmatics, and chronic medical conditions. EV-D68 loads were analyzed in relation to disease severity parameters and sequence variability characterized over time.ResultsIn 2014, 44% (192/438) of samples tested positive for EV-D68 vs. 10% (13/130) in 2011-13 (p<0.0001). PICU admissions (p<0.0001) and non-invasive ventilation (p<0.0001) were more common in children with EV-D68 vs. RV/EV-non-EV-D68 infections. Asthmatic EVD68+ children, required supplemental oxygen administration (p = 0.03) and PICU admissions (p <0.001) more frequently than healthy children or those with chronic medical conditions; however oxygen duration (p<0.0001), and both PICU and total hospital stay (p<0.01) were greater in children with underlying medical conditions, irrespective of viral burden. By phylogenetic analysis, the 2014 EV-D68 strains clustered into a new sublineage within Glade B.ConclusionsThis is one of the largest pediatric cohorts described from the EV-D68 outbreak. Irrespective of viral loads, EV-D68 was associated with high morbidity in children with asthma and co morbidities. While EV-D68 circulated before 2014, the outbreak isolates clustered differently than those from prior years.									16	0	0	0	11	1	16			1932-6203			WOS:000388886000050	27875593

In this study, TiO2 photocatalytic process under simulated solar irradiation was evaluated in synthetic seawater and compared with deionized water, using sulfamethoxazole (SMX) as model organic compound. For a TiO2 concentration of 100 mg L-1, SMX degradation resulted two times slower in seawater than in deionized water by the determination of their pseudo-first order rate constants of 0.020 min(-1) and 0.041 min(-1), respectively. Selected scavenging experiments revealed no significant contribution of hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) on the degradation process in seawater, while these radicals contributed to circa 60% on the SMX depletion in deionized water. Instead, the involvement of reactive halogen species (RHS) as main contributors for the SMX degradation in seawater could be established. A mechanism for the RHS generation was proposed, whose initiation reactions involve halides with the TiO2 photogenerated holes, yielding chlorine and bromine radicals (Cl center dot and Br center dot) that may later generate other RHS. Production of RHS was further confirmed by the identification of SMX transformation products (TPs) and their evolution over time, carried out by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). SMX transformation was conducted through halogenation, dimerization and oxidation pathways, involving mainly RHS. Most of the detected transformation products accumulated over time (up to 360 min of irradiation). These findings bring concerns about the viability of photocatalytic water treatments using TiO2 NPs in saline waters, as RHS could be yielded resulting in the generation and accumulation of halogenated organic byproducts.

Herein, we report a relatively low-cost NiAg0.4 3D porous nanocluster catalyst whose activity matches with that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C in 1 M KOH solution. The catalyst is designed on the principle of creating an interface between a metal having a positive Gibbs energy of hydrogen adsorption and a metal of negative Gibbs energy based on the volcano plot, to tune the Gibbs energy of hydrogen adsorption near zero for enhanced hydrogen evolution. The synthesized NiAg0.4 3D porous nanoclusters are comprised of nanoparticles of lateral dimension similar to 50 nm forming a 3D porous network with pores of 10 nm-80 nm. A high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image reveals the epitaxial growth of Ag (200) on the Ni (111) plane leading to the creation of abundant interfaces between the Ni and Ag lattices. The catalyst needs a low overpotential of 40 mV@10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 39.1 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibits a high specific activity of 0.1 mA cm((ECSA))(-2) at an overpotential (eta) of 45 mV which matches with the specific activity of Pt/C 20% wt. catalyst (0.1 mA cm(-2)@eta = 26 mV). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Ni-Ag interface furnishes a pathway with a reduced Gibbs energy of adsorption of -0.04 eV, thus promoting enhanced hydrogen evolution. In summary, this study reveals excellent HER activity at the Ni-Ag interface.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000529201500037	32239051

In this paper, reactive force-field molecular dynamics was utilized to investigate the structure, reactivity and interfacial bonding of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H)/GO nanocomposite functionalized by hydroxyl (C-OH), epoxy (C-O-C), carboxyl (COOH) and sulfonic (SO3H) groups with a coverage of 10%. The silicate chains in the hydrophilic C-S-H substrate provided numerous non-bridging oxygen sites and counter ions (Ca ions) with high reactivity, which allowed interlayer water molecules to dissociate into Si-OH and Ca-OH. On the other hand, protons dissociated from the functional groups and transferred to non-bridging sites in C-S-H, producing carbonyl (C?O) and Si-OH. The de-protonation degree of the different groups in the vicinity of the C-S-H surface was in the following order: COOH (SO3H) > C-OH > C-O-C. In the GO-COOH sheet, most COOH groups were de-protonated to COO- groups, which enhanced the polarity and hydrophilicity of the GO sheets and formed stable COOCa bonds with neighboring Ca ions. The de-protonated COO- could also accept H bonds from Si-OH in the C-S-H gel, which further strengthened the interfacial connection. On the contrary, in the GO-Oo sheet, only 8% of the epoxy group was stretched open by the Ca ions and transformed to carbonyl group, showing weak polarity and connection with the C-S-H sheet. Furthermore, uniaxial tensile test on different C-S-H/GO models revealed that C-S-H reinforced with GO-COOH and GO-OH had better interfacial cohesive strength and ductility than that observed under tensile loading. Under the reaction force field, the dissociation of water, the proton exchange between the C-S-H and GO structure, and Oc-Ca-Os bond breakage occurred to resist tensile loading. The weakest mechanical behavior observed in the G/C-S-H, GO-Oo/C-S-H and GO-SO3H/C-S-H composites was attributed to the poor bonding, dissociation of functional groups and instability of atoms in the interface region. Hopefully, the molecular-scale strengthening mechanisms could provide a scientific guide for sustainable design of cement composites.									53	2	0	0	0	0	55			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000428779700040	29542793

In the present study, the intracellular copper zinc SOD from the Asian seabass Laces caltager (Lc-icCuZnSOD) was identified by RNA ligase mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) technique. The full-length cDNA of Lc-icCuZnSOD consisted of 809 nucleotides with an open-reading frame of 465 bp encoding 154 amino acids and N-Glycosylation site (N\/TA) within. The predicted molecular mass of the protein is 15.84 kDa with an estimated pl of 5.52. The deduced amino acid sequence of Lc-icCuZnSOD shared high degree of homology with known CuZnSODs from other species. CuZn binding sites (H47, H49, H64, and H121 for Cu2+ and H72, H81, and ASP84 for Zn2+), two cysteine residues (aa 58 and 147) that form a disulfide bond, and CuZnSOD family signature sequences (GFHVHAFGDNT, aa 45-55 and GNAGGRLACGVI, aa 139-150) were highly conserved among fish species. Temporal and tissue specific expression of Lc-icCuZnSOD was significantly differentially altered in Asian seabass challenged with Vibrio anguillarum indicating possible role in antioxidant activities involved in the innate immune defense mechanisms.

The data indicate that the delta O-18, delta D, delta C-13, and delta S-34 of the water correlate with the mineralization (S) of the basins (as of 2014): for CB, S = 135.6 parts per thousand, delta O-18 = 4.8 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand, delta D = 5 +/- 2 parts per thousand, delta C-13 (dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC) = 3.5 +/- 0.1%, delta S-34 = 14.5 parts per thousand; for LT, S = 83.8 parts per thousand, delta O-18 = 2.0 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand, delta D = -13.5 +/- 1.5 parts per thousand, delta C-13 = 2.0 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand, delta S-34 = 14.2 parts per thousand; and for MS, S = 9.2 parts per thousand, delta O-18 = -2.0 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand, delta D = -29 +/- 1 parts per thousand, delta C-13 = -0.5 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand, delta S-34 = 13.1%. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of the groundwaters are similar to those in MS and principally different from the artesian waters fed by atmospheric precipitation. The mineralization, delta O-13, and delta S-34 of the groundwaters broadly vary, reflecting interaction with the host rocks. The average delta C-13 values of the shell and detrital carbonates sampled at the modern dried off zones of the basins are similar: 0.8 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand for CB, 0.8 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand for LT, and -0.4 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand for MS. The oxygen isotopic composition of the carbonates varies much more broadly, and the average values are as follows: 34.2 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand for CB, 32.0 +/- 2.2% for LT, and 28.2 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand for MS. These values correlate with the delta O-18 of the water of the corresponding basins. The carbonate cement of the Late Eocene sandstone of the Chengan Formation, which makes up the wave-cut terrace at CB, has anomalously low delta C-13 up to -38.5 parts per thousand, suggesting origin near a submarine methane seep. The delta S-34 of the mirabilite and gypsum (11.0 to 16.6 parts per thousand) from the bottom sediments and young dried off zone also decrease from CB to MS in response to increasing content of sulfates brought by the Syr-Darya River (delta S-34 = 9.1 to 9.9 parts per thousand) and weakening sulfate reduction. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio in the water and carbonates of the Aral basins do not differ, within the analytical error, and is 0.70914 +/- 0.00003 on average. This value indicate that the dominant Sr source of the Aral Sea is Mesozoic-Cenozoic carbonate rocks. The Rb-Sr systems of the silicate component of the bottom silt (which is likely dominated by eolian sediments) of MS and LT plot on the T = 160 +/- 5 Ma, I-0 = 0.7091 +/- 0.0001, pseudochron. The Rb-Sr systems of CB are less ordered, and the silt is likely a mixture of eolian and alluvial sediments.									4	1	1	0	0	0	4			0016-7029	1556-1968		WOS:000415766000008

Previous studies have hypothesized that band energy levels of such photocatalysts in water are both flat and symmetrical, and charge separation in such photocatalysts is driven by random charge carrier diffusion. However, it is not well understood how the observed asymmetry of carrier diffusion is achieved during photocatalysis. To fully understand this charge separation process, we used double-side polished, intrinsic silicon as a model light absorber and manipulated the direction of charge-carrier diffusion using combinations of carrier-selective contacts. Degenerately p-type doped and n-type doped silicon, along with the as-grown and annealed TiO2 overlayers grown by atomic layer deposition, was used as carrier selective back and front contacts, respectively. The protective TiO2 layers along with nickel oxide co-catalysts enabled bi-functional, stable silicon photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution and water oxidation in alkaline solution. A device simulation was applied to analyse the experimental results and further gain understanding on the charge separation process in photocatalysts involving semiconductor/liquid junctions. Combined experimental and simulation studies indicated that the contacts established asymmetric band bending inside the intrinsic silicon layer and drove directional charge separation, primarily carrier diffusion. By scaling down the thickness of the silicon layer in the simulation, analogies of charge separation in particulate photocatalysts can be drawn. Based on the findings from intrinsic silicon, we further revealed that photocatalysts generally do require asymmetric band bending to drive diffusional charge separation and that a small band edge offset of 0.45 eV between reductive and oxidative catalytic sites can provide a sufficient, steady-state photovoltage of over 1.23 V for overall water splitting by using a model SrTiO3 absorber. This study provides insightful guidance for designing efficient and stable particulate photocatalysts especially those using Si and III-V semiconductors with protective layers such as TiO2.									17	2	0	0	1	0	17			2398-4902			WOS:000467218700019

Calcifying diploid and noncalcifying haploid cells (Roscoff culture collection strains 1216 and 1217) were acclimated to present-day and elevated CO2 partial pressures (P-CO2; 38.5 vs. 101.3 Pa, i.e., 380 vs. 1000 mu atm) under low and high light (50 vs. 300 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)). Growth rates as well as cellular quotas and production rates of C and N were measured. Sources of inorganic C for biomass buildup were determined using a C-14 disequilibrium assay. Photosynthetic O-2 evolution was measured as a function of dissolved inorganic C and light by means of membrane-inlet mass spectrometry. The diploid stage responded to elevated P-CO2 by shunting resources from the production of particulate inorganic C toward organic C yet keeping the production of total particulate C constant. As the effect of ocean acidification was stronger under low light, the diploid stage might be less affected by increased acidity when energy availability is high. The haploid stage maintained elemental composition and production rates under elevated P-CO2. Although both life-cycle stages involve different ways of dealing with elevated P-CO2, the responses were generally modulated by energy availability, being typically most pronounced under low light. Additionally, P-CO2 responses resembled those induced by high irradiances, indicating that ocean acidification affects the interplay between energy-generating processes (photosynthetic light reactions) and processes competing for energy (biomass buildup and calcification). A conceptual model is put forward explaining why the magnitude of single responses is determined by energy availability.									93	2	1	0	76	0	96			0024-3590	1939-5590		WOS:000302613200018

Because KTF is particularly photolabile (half-life similar to 4 min), knowledge of the fate and ecological risks of KTF photoproducts in the aquatic environment is especially essential. Herein, we systematically investigated the photophysics, photochemistry, and photosensitization of KTF photoproducts in aqueous solution under 365 nm irradiation (UV365). Results show that KTF photolyzed rapidly and formed 3-ethyl-alpha-hydroxylbenzophenone (EtOH-BP), 3-ethyl-alpha-hydroperoxylbenzophenone (EtOOH-BP), 3-acetylbenzophenone (AcBP), and 3-ethylbenzophenone (EtBP), as identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The presence of O-2 significantly affected the evolution of photoproducts during KTF photolysis. The photophysical properties of EtBP and AcBP were characterized by spectroscopic approaches. In particular, transient absorption spectra obtained by nanosecond laser flash photolysis (LFP) indicated that EtBP and AcBP were excited to triplet states with lifetimes of 28 and 2.4 mu s, respectively. EtBP underwent further photodegradation, giving rise to EtOH-BP, EtOOH-BP, and AcBP upon UV365 irradiation. The reaction is proposed to proceed through an excimer precursor ((3)[EtBP...EtBP]*) followed by intramolecular H abstraction. In contrast, AcBP was relatively photostable, particularly under aerated condition. Both EtBP and AcBP have strong photosensitizing activity, as evidenced by the triplet probe 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)benzonitrile (DMABN). ECOSAR program suggested that the photoproducts are more ecotoxic and bioaccumulative than the parent KTF.

Since both TiO2 and polyheptazine are extremely chemically stable, these materials are highly promising candidates for fabrication of photoanodes for water photooxidation. The properties of the hybrids were experimentally determined by a careful analysis of optical absorption spectra, luminescence properties and photoelectrochemical measurements, and corroborated by quantum chemical calculations. We provide for the first time clear experimental evidence for the formation of an interfacial charge-transfer complex between polyheptazine (donor) and TiO2 (acceptor), which is responsible for a significant red shift of absorption and photocurrent response of the hybrid as compared to both of the single components. The direct optical charge transfer from the HOMO of polyheptazine to the conduction band edge of TiO2 gives rise to an absorption band centered at 2.3 eV (540 nm). The estimated potential of photogenerated holes (+1.7 V vs. NHE, pH 7) allows for photooxidation of water (+0.82 V vs. NHE, pH 7) as evidenced by visible light-driven (lambda > 420 nm) evolution of dioxygen on hybrid electrodes modified with IrO2 nanoparticles as a co-catalyst. The quantum-chemical simulations demonstrate that the TiO2-polyheptazine interface is a complex and flexible system energetically favorable for proton-transfer processes required for water oxidation. Apart from water splitting, this type of hybrid materials may also find further applications in a broader research area of solar energy conversion and photo-responsive devices.									117	3	0	0	5	0	117			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000297560200040	22057224

Lung ultrasound is well suited to this interstitial, subpleural involvement, and it is now broadly used in intensive care units (ICUs). The extension and severity of lung infiltrates can be described numerically with a reproducible and validated lung ultrasound score (LUSS). We hypothesized that LUSS might be useful as a tool to non-invasively monitor the evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia at the bedside. LUSS monitoring was rapidly implemented in the management of our COVID-19 patients with RT-PCR-documented COVID-19. The LUSS was evaluated repeatedly at the bedside. We present a graphic description of the course of LUSS during COVID-19 in 10 consecutive patients admitted in our intensive care unit with moderate to severe ARDS between March 15 and 30(th). LUSS appeared to be closely related to the disease progression. In successfully extubated patients, LUSS decreased and was lower than at the time of intubation. LUSS increased inexorably in a patient who died from refractory hypoxemia. LUSS helped with the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), showing an increased score and the presence of new lung consolidations in all 5 patients with VAPs. There was also a good agreement between CT-scans and LUSS as for the presence of lung consolidations. In conclusion, our early experience suggests that LUSS monitoring accurately reflect disease progression and indicates potential usefulness for the management of COVID-19 patients with ARDS. It might help with early VAP diagnosis, mechanical ventilation weaning management, and potentially reduce the need for X-ray and CT exams. LUSS evaluation is easy to use and readily available in ICUs throughout the world, and might be a safe, cheap and simple tool to optimize critically ill COVID-19 patients care during the pandemic.									44	1	0	0	6	0	45			1932-6203			WOS:000554606400010	32692769	
J	FALK, S; SAMUELSSON, G				Samuelsson, Goran/E-1824-2015				RECOVERY OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND PHOTOSYSTEM-II FLUORESCENCE IN CHLAMYDOMONAS-REINHARDTII AFTER EXPOSURE TO 3 LEVELS OF HIGH LIGHT								PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM				85	1			61	68						MAY 1992	1992	Recovery from 60 min of photoinhibitory treatment at photosynthetic photon flux densities of 500, 1400 and 2200-mu-mol m-2 s-1 was followed in cells of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii grown at 125-mu-mol m-2 s-1. These light treatments re resent photoregulation, moderate photoinhibition and strong photoinhibition, respectively. Treatment in photoregulatory light resulted in an increased maximal rate of oxygen evolution (P(max)) and an increased quantum yield (PHI), but a 15% decrease in F(V)/F(M). Treatment at moderately photoinhibitory light resulted in a 30% decrease in F(V)/F(M) and an approximately equal decrease in PHI. Recovery in dim light restored F(V)/F(M) within 15 and 45 min after high light treatment at 500 and 1 400-mu-mol m-2 s-1 respectively. Convexity (THETA), a measure of the extent of co-limitation between PS II turnover and whole-chain electron transport, and PHI approached, but did not reach the control level during recovery after exposure to 1 400-mu-mol m 2 s-1, whereas P(max) increased above the control. Treatment at 2200-mu-mol m-2 s-1 resulted in a strong reduction of the modeled parameters PHI, THETA and P(max). Subsequent recovery was initially rapid but the rate decreased, and a complete recovery was not reached within 120 min. Based on the results, it is hypothesized that exposure to high light results in two phenomena. The first, expressed at all three light intensities, involves redistribution within the different aspects of PS II heterogeneity rather than a photoinhibitory destruction of PS II reaction centers. The second, most strongly expressed at 2200-mu-mol m-2 s-1, is a physical damage to PS II shown as an almost total loss of PS II(alpha) and PS II Q(B)-reducing centers. Thus recovery displayed two phases, the first was rapid and the only visible phase in algae exposed to 500 and 1 400-mu-mol m-2 s-1. The second phase was slow and visible only in the later part of recovery in cells exposed to 2 200-mu-mol m-2 s-1.									21	1	0	0	22	0	22			0031-9317			WOS:A1992HY68100010

Rapid deployment of new energies makes renewable energy driven CO2 electroreduction to chemical feedstocks and carbon-neutral fuels a feasible and cost-effective pathway for achieving net-zero emission. With the urgency of the net-zero goal, we initiated our research on CO2 electrolysis with emphasis on industrial relevance. The CO2 molecules are thermodynamically stable due to high activation energy of the two C= O bonds, and efficient electrocatalysts are required to overcome the sluggish dynamics and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. The CO2 electrocatalysts that we have explored include molecular catalysts and nanostructured catalysts. Molecular catalysts are centered on earth abundant elements such as Fe and Co for catalyzing CO2 reduction, and using Fe catalysts, we proposed an amidation strategy for reduction of CO2 to methanol, bypassing the inactive formate pathway. For nanostructured catalysts, we developed a carbon enrichment strategy using nitrogen-rich nanomaterials for selective CO2 reduction. Direct CO2 electroreduction from the flue gas stream represents the "holy grail" in the field, because typical CO2 concentration in flue gas is only 6-15%, posing a significant challenge for CO2 electrolysis. On the other hand, direct electroreduction of CO2 in the flue gas eliminates the carbon capture process and simplifies the overall carbon capture and utilization (CCU) scheme. However, direct flue gas reduction is frustrated by the reactive oxygen (5-8%), low CO2 concentration (6-15%), and potentially toxic impurities. Surface CO2 enrichment catalysts with high O2 tolerance could be viable for achieving direct CO2 electroreduction for decarbonization of flue gas. In addition to the electrocatalysts, the incorporation of catalysts into the electrolyzer and development of a suitable process was also investigated to meet industrial demands. A membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is a zero-gap configuration with cathode and anode catalysts coated on either side of an ion exchange membrane. We adopted the MEA configuration due to the structural simplicity, low ohmic resistance, and high efficiency. The electrode factors (for example, membrane type, catalyst layer porosity, and MEA fabrication method) and the electrolyzer factors (for example, flow channels, gas diffusion layer) are critical to highly efficient operation. We separately developed an anion-exchange membrane-based system for CO production and cation-exchange membranebased system for formate production. The optimized electrolyzer configuration can generate uniform current and voltage distribution in a large-area electrolyzer and operate using an industrial CO2 stream. The optimized process was developed with the targets of long-term continuous operation and no electrolyte consumption.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000745877400001	35045254	
J	Mitropoulos, DN				Mitropoulos, Dionysios/AAA-9362-2020				Novel insights into the mechanism of action of intravesical immunomodulators								IN VIVO				19	3			611	621						MAY-JUN 2005	2005	To date, the precise mechanism of intravesical immunomodulators remains unknown. In vitro, interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) acts directly on neoplastic cells and inhibits their proliferation while it induces their differentiation. Urothelium and transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) cells express IFN-alpha receptor, the density of which correlates with lesion grade. IFN-a reduces neo-microvascular density in the normal urothelium adjacent to the tumor after transurethial resection (TUR), possibly via inhibition of COX-1. Moreover, IFN-alpha induces the membrane expression of tumor-related antigens and MHC antigens, providing a basis for a cellular immune response. When given intravesically, IFN-alpha may result in local and systemic T cell and NK cell activation. By monitoring nitric oxide (NO) end-products in urine and evaluating inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression immunohistochemically, we were able to show that IFN-a may induce urothelial iNOS expression with subsequent formation of peroxynitrite, which might contribute to the antineoplastic action of IFN-a. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is thought to bind to the bladder wall via interaction between the bacterial antigen 85 complex and fibronectin. Although systemic reactions (evolution of cellular immune response, systemic production of cytokines and oxygen free radicals) have been reported, a likely scenario is that exposure to BCG results in a massive local immune response, characterized by induced expression of cytokines in the urine and in the bladder wall, and by a marked infiltration of the bladder wall by granulocytes and mononuclear cells. BCG-induced changes in tumor cell phenotype render them able to act both as lymphokine-activated killer cell targets and antigen presenting cells. Although BCG may act directly on the proliferation of tumor cells, helper and cytotoxic T cells and, most probably, NK cells are absolutely necessary for any antitumor effects. Tumor cell killing is mediated through FasLigand, perforin and TNFalpha. In a recent study, we found that BCG up-regulated NOS expression in normal human urothelium in vivo, suggesting a role for NO in BCG-mediated antitumor activity.					7th International Congress of Anticancer Research7th International Congress of Anticancer Research	OCT 25-30, 2004OCT 25-30, 2004		Corfu, GREECECorfu, GREECE	32	0	0	0	16	0	32			0258-851X	1791-7549		WOS:000228654800019	15875784

Purification of these particles was achieved by a 22 hours centrifugation over a linear sucrose density gradient at 217.500 X g. The obtained particle fraction exhibited an oxygen evolution activity which corresponded to three times the rate of intact cells and to five times the rate of intact thylakoids. The chlorophyll protein ratio was 1:10 and the ratio manganese/chlorophyll 1:34.SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the photosystem II-fraction is composed of the core peptides D 1 and D 2, the chlorophyll-binding peptides CP 43 and CP 47, the extrinsic 33 kDa peptide (manganese stabilizing peptide, MSP) and phycobiliproteins with molecular masses between 16 to 20 kDa. Cyt b(559) was not detected in our gel electrophoresis assay. Part of the peptides of the 30 kDa-region (D 1, D 2, MSP) occurred as aggregates with a molecular mass of 60 to 66 kDa.The D 1-peptide was isolated from the PS II-preparation by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The intrinisic peptide reacts in the Western blot procedure with the antiserum to phosphatidylglycerol and with the antiserum to beta-carotene. Incubation of the peptide with the antisera to monogalactosyldiglyceride, sulfoquinovosyldiglyceride and zeaxanthine resulted negatively. The binding of phosphatidylglycerol onto the D 1-peptide was confirmed by lipid analysis in HPLC and fatty acid analysis by gas chromatography. Only this Lipid, respectively the typical fatty acid mixture of this lipid was detected. The lipid is characterized by the fact that the hexadecenoic acid does not exhibit trans-configuration, as is true for phosphatidylglycerol of higher plants and algae, but occurs in cis-configuration.With the antibody being directed towards the glycerol-phosphate residue and not towards the fatty acids, it can be concluded from the reaction of the antibodies with the bound lipid that the Lipid is bound to the peptide via the fatty acid. The negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol increases the hydrophobicity of the peptide and leads to a negatively charged surface favouring binding of cations like calcium and magnesium. The fact that incubation of this PS II-fraction with phospholipase inhibits photosynthetic activity by 25% which can be fully restored by addition of phosphatidylglycerol, shows that bound phosphatidylglycerol has a functional role.									24	0	0	0	21	0	24			0939-5075	1865-7125		WOS:A1994MY47800017		
J	Milsch, H.; Seibt, A.; Spangenberg, E.								Long-term Petrophysical Investigations on Geothermal Reservoir Rocks at Simulated In Situ Conditions								TRANSPORT IN POROUS MEDIA				77	1			59	78		10.1007/s11242-008-9261-5				MAR 2009	2009	In the course of stimulation and fluid production, the chemical fluid-rock equilibrium of a geothermal reservoir may become disturbed by either temperature changes and/or an alteration of the fluid chemistry. Consequently, dissolution and precipitation reactions might be induced that result in permeability damage. In connection with the field investigations at a deep geothermal doublet, complementary laboratory-based research is performed to address these effects. The reservoir is located at a depth of 4100 to 4200 m near GroA Schonebeck within the Northeast German Basin, 50 km north of Berlin, Germany. Within the reservoir horizon, an effective pressure of approximately 45 MPa and a temperature of 150A degrees C are encountered. Furthermore, the Lower Permian (Rotliegend) reservoir rock is saturated with a highly saline Ca-Na-Cl type formation fluid (TDS a parts per thousand 255 g/l). Under these conditions we performed two sets of long-term flow-through experiments. The pore fluid used during the first and the second experiment was a 0.1 molar NaCl-solution and a synthetic Ca-Na-Cl type fluid with the specifications as above, respectively. The maximum run duration was 186 days. In detail, we experimentally addressed: (1) the effect of long-term flow on rock permeability in connection with possible changes in fluid chemistry and saturation; (2) the occurrence and consequences of baryte precipitation; and (3) potential precipitations related to oxygen-rich well water invasion during water-frac stimulation. In all substudies petrophysical experiments related to the evolution of rock permeability and electrical conductivity were complemented with microstructural investigations and a chemical fluid analysis. We also report the technical challenges encountered when corrosive fluids are used in long-term in situ petrophysical experiments. After it was assured that experimental artifacts can be excluded, it is demonstrated that the sample permeability remained approximately constant within margins of +/- 50 % for nearly six months. Furthermore, an effect of baryte precipitation on the rock permeability was not observed. Finally, the fluid exchange procedure did not alter the rock transport properties. The results of the chemical fluid analysis are in support of these observations. In both experiments the electrical conductivity of the samples remained unchanged for a given fluid composition and constant p-T conditions. This emphasizes its valuable complementary character in determining changes in rock transport properties during long-term flow-through experiments when the risk of experimental artifacts is high.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0169-3913			WOS:000263182800004

Electrochemical oxidation of chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (F-53B,ClCF2CF2CF2CF2CF2CF2-O-CF2 CF2-SO3K) as PFOS substitute was carried out with the BDD, BDD/SnO2, BDD/PbO2, and BDD/SnO2-F anodes. The effects of F and Sn ratio, current density, initial pH, initial F-53B concentration, the supporting electrolyte, NaCl concentration, and electrode distance on the degradation ratios were investigated. The defluorination and the desulfurization were evaluated by ion chromatography and UV-vis spectra. The intermediate products were analyzed on the liquid chromatography system coupled with a triple-stage quadrupole mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). The experimental results showed that BDD/SnO2-F had the most outstanding electrochemical oxidation performance. After introduction of F into SnO2 crystal, the grain size of SnO2-F was reduced, the oxygen evolution potential was increased by 0.13 V, and the degradation ratio of F-53B was increased by 15.07%. Under the optimum operating parameters, F-53B removal ratio of 95.6% was obtained, and the defluorination ratio reached 61.39% with NaCl supporting electrolyte concentration of 1 mol/L at current density of 30 mA/cm(2) after electrolysis of 30 min. Finally, the electrochemical degradation pathways and the mechanisms of F-53B were proposed based on the intermediate products and the previous literature reported. This study indicates that the electrochemical performance of BDD anode can be much improved by modification with SnO2-F, and BDD/SnO2-F anode is kind of effective anode to decompose refractory compounds.									47	3	0	0	26	0	49			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000494799900043

Recent leaps forward in the development of efficient and durable light absorbers and catalysts for oxygen evolution and the growing attention to catalysts for carbon dioxide activation brings into focus the tasks of hierarchically integrating the components into assemblies for closing of the photosynthetic cycle. A particular challenge is the efficient coupling of the multi-electron processes of CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation. Among the most important requirements for a complete integrated system are catalytic rates that match the solar flux, efficient charge transport between the various components, and scalability of the photosynthetic assembly on the unprecedented scale of terawatts in order to have impact on fuel consumption.To address these challenges, we have developed a heterogeneous inorganic materials approach with molecularly precise control of light absorption and charge transport pathways. Oxo-bridged heterobinuclear units with metal-to-metal charge-transfer transitions absorbing deep in the visible act as single photon, single charge transfer pumps for driving multi-electron catalysts. A photodeposition method has been introduced for the spatially directed assembly of nanoparticle catalysts for selective coupling to the donor or acceptor metal of the light absorber. For CO2 reduction, a Cu oxide cluster is coupled to the Zr center of a ZrOCo light absorber, while coupling of an Ir nanoparticle catalyst for water oxidation to the Co donor affords closing of the photosynthetic cycle of CO2 conversion by H2O to CO and O-2. Optical, vibrational, and X-ray spectroscopy provide detailed structural knowledge of the polynuclear assemblies. Time resolved visible and rapid-scan FT-IR studies reveal charge transfer mechanisms and transient surface intermediates under photocatalytic conditions for guiding performance improvements.Separation of the water oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction half reactions by a membrane is essential for efficient photoreduction of CO2 by H2O to liquid fuel products. A concept of a macroscale artificial photosystem consisting of arrays of Co oxidesilica coreshell nanotubes is introduced in which each tube operates as a complete, independent photosynthetic unit with built-in membrane separation. The ultrathin amorphous silica shell with embedded molecular wires functions as a proton conducting, molecule impermeable membrane. Photoelectrochemical and transient optical measurements confirm tight control of charge transport through the membrane by the orbital energetics of the wire molecules. Hierarchical arrangement of the components is accomplished by a combination of photodeposition, controlled anchoring, and atomic layer deposition methods.									72	6	0	0	7	0	73			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000384038600006	27575376	
J	Li, Dora A.; Walker, Esther; Francki, Michael G.								Identification of a member of the catalase multigene family on wheat chromosome 7A associated with flour b* colour and biological significance of allelic variation								MOLECULAR GENETICS AND GENOMICS				290	6			2313	2324		10.1007/s00438-015-1083-x				DEC 2015	2015	Carotenoids (especially lutein) are known to be the pigment source for flour b* colour in bread wheat. Flour b* colour variation is controlled by a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on wheat chromosome 7AL and one gene from the carotenoid pathway, phytoene synthase, was functionally associated with the QTL on 7AL in some, but not all, wheat genotypes. A SNP marker within a sequence similar to catalase (Cat3-A1snp) derived from full-length (FL) cDNA (AK332460), however, was consistently associated with the QTL on 7AL and implicated in regulating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to control carotenoid accumulation affecting flour b* colour. The number of catalase genes on chromosome 7AL was investigated in this study to identify which gene may be implicated in flour b* variation and two were identified through interrogation of the draft wheat genome survey sequence consisting of five exons and a further two members having eight exons identified through comparative analysis with the single catalase gene on rice chromosome 6, PCR amplification and sequencing. It was evident that the catalase genes on chromosome 7A had duplicated and diverged during evolution relative to its counterpart on rice chromosome 6. The detection of transcripts in seeds, the co-location with Cat3-A1snp marker and maximised alignment of FL-cDNA (AK332460) with cognate genomic sequence indicated that TaCat3-A1 was the member of the catalase gene family associated with flour b* colour variation. Re-sequencing identified three alleles from three wheat varieties, TaCat3-A1a, TaCat3-A1b and TaCat3-A1c, and their predicted protein identified differences in peroxisomal targeting signal tri-peptide domain in the carboxyl terminal end providing new insights into their potential role in regulating cellular H2O2 that contribute to flour b* colour variation.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			1617-4615	1617-4623		WOS:000365425300021	26134858

This technology is more appealing when CO2 is flexibly reduced to chemicals and fuels driven by surplus electricity because it represents a low-cost and controllable approach to maximized electricity utilization and value-added CO2 utilization. Nonaqueous metal-CO2 batteries exhibited high discharge voltage and capacity with carbon and oxalate as reduction products from CO2 electrochemistry that lacks proton. In contrast, aqueous Zn-CO2 batteries implemented flexible CO2 electrochemistry for more value-added products accompanied by energy storage based on a proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism.In this Account, we have exemplified our recent results in the development of CO2 electrochemistry from nonaqueous Li-CO2 batteries to aqueous Zn-CO2 batteries toward practical value-added CO2 conversion. Aimed at the challengingly limited CO2 electrochemistry and high cost of nonaqueous Li-CO2 batteries, we proposed aqueous Zn-CO2 batteries. Our previous works on nonaqueous Li-CO2 batteries, aqueous Zn-air batteries, and aqueous CO2 reduction electrocatalysts further shed light on battery mechanism, device construction, and electrocatalyst design. For example, bipolar membranes maintain the stability of the basic anolyte and neutral catholyte, as well as the kinetics of ion transport at the same time, forming the device base for aqueous Zn-CO2 batteries. Moreover, in terms of the electrocatalyst catalyzing both discharge and charge reactions on the cathode, the design of multifunctional electrocatalysts is of great importance for not only CO2 electrochemistry but also spontaneous discharge and energy efficiency of aqueous Zn-CO2 batteries. We have explored a series of multifunctional electrocatalyst cathodes, including noble metal, transition metal, and metal-free materials, all of which facilitated CO2 electrochemistry in aqueous Zn-CO2 batteries with value-added carbon-based products. Meanwhile, several operating models for practical complicated situations are presented, such as rechargeable, reversible, dual-model, and solid-state batteries. Zn-O-2 batteries with different models require different design mechanisms for electrocatalyst cathodes. Reversible aqueous Zn-O-2 batteries with HCOOH generation were enabled by electrocatalysts capable of catalyzing the interconversion of CO2 and HCOOH at low overpotentials, rechargeable aqueous Zn-CO2 batteries were allowed by electrocatalysts capable of catalyzing efficient CO2 reduction and O-2 evolution, and dual-model aqueous Zn-CO2 batteries were realized by electrocatalysts capable of catalyzing CO2 reduction, water oxidation, and oxygen reduction. Concluding remarks include a summary of recent CO2 electrochemistry in metal CO2 batteries and a brief discussion of future challenges and opportunities for practical aqueous Zn-CO2 batteries, such as highly reduced products and high production rate.									67	6	0	0	2	0	69			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000472683000022	31120728	
J	Kahlenberg, Volker; Prosser, Lukas; Salzmann, Michael F.; Hejny, Clivia					Kahlenberg, Volker/0000-0002-0652-7984			On the incorporation of strontium into the crystal structure of bredigite: structural effects and phase transition								MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY				116	2			151	167		10.1007/s00710-021-00771-x		DEC 2021		APR 2022	2022	Sr-substitution in the crystal structure of bredigite has been studied in detail. Samples of a hypothetical solid-solution series with nominal composition Ca7-xSrxMg[SiO4](4) (x = 0, 2, horizontal ellipsis ,7) have been prepared from sinter reactions in the temperature range between 1275 and 1325 degrees C and characterized using powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Synthesis runs between x = 1 and x = 4 resulted in compounds with increasing Sr contents, for which single-crystal diffraction studies revealed the following Sr/(Sr + Ca) atomic ratios: 0.133,0.268, 0.409 and 0.559. They are isostructural to the pure calcium end-member (x = 0) and adopt the orthorhombic space group Pnnm. Evolution of the unit-cell parameters and cell volumes of the solid-solution series are defined by linear or nearly linear trends when plotted against the Sr/(Sr + Ca) atomic ratio. Replacement of calcium with strontium atoms on the different sites shows clear preferences for specific positions. For the experiment with x = 5, formation of bredigite-related single-crystals with Sr/(Sr + Ca) = 0.675 was observed. These samples, however, exhibited a halved c lattice parameter when compared with the corresponding value in the Pnnm structure, pointing to a compositionally induced phase transition somewhere in region between Sr/(Sr + Ca) = 0.559 and 0.675. The crystal structure of this new phase with composition Ca2.32Sr4.82Mg0.86[SiO4](4) was successfully determined in space group Pbam. Basic crystallographic data are as follows: a = 18.869(2) angstrom, b = 6.9445(8) angstrom, c = 5.5426(6) angstrom, V = 726.28(14) angstrom(3), Z = 2. Structure determination was accomplished using charge flipping. Subsequent least-squares refinements resulted in a residual of R(|F|) = 2.70% for 822 independent reflections and 87 parameters. The Pbam- and the Pnnm-structures are in a group-subgroup relationship and topologically related. Both are based on so-called pinwheel-like MSi6O24 clusters consisting of a central magnesium-dominated [MO6]-octahedron as well as six attached [SiO4]-tetrahedra. The clusters are linked into chain-like elements running along [001]. Linkage between the chains is provided by mixed Sr/Ca positions with 6 to 10 oxygen ligands. Differences between the two phases result from changes in Sr-Ca site occupancies in combination with displacements of the atoms and tilts of the tetrahedra. The distortion pattern has been studied using group-theoretical methods including mode analysis. Notably, for the samples with x = 6 and x = 7-the latter corresponding to the hypothetical pure strontium end-member composition-no bredigite-type phases could be identified, indicating that there is an upper limit for the Sr-uptake.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0930-0708	1438-1168		WOS:000725993800001

Gopalakrishnan; Choi, Jinhee				M.G, Prakash/A-3359-2013				Characterization and expression of superoxide dismutase genes in Chironomus riparius (Diptera, Chironomidae) larvae as a potential biomarker of ecotoxicity								COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY				156	3-4			187	194		10.1016/j.cbpc.2012.06.003				NOV 2012	2012	Superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) is an enzyme involved in the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) into molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. In this study, a copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu-ZnSOD) gene and a manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) gene in aquatic midge, Chironomus riparius (CrSODs) was identified using an Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) database generated by 454 pyrosequencing. A multiple sequence alignment of C. riparius sequences revealed high homology with other insect sequences in terms of the amino acid level. Phylogenetic analysis of the CrSODs revealed that they were grouped with SODs of other organisms, such as Polypedilum vanderplanki, Drosophila melanogaster, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus and Bombyx mori. Expression of the corresponding CrSODs was analyzed during different developmental stages and following exposure to various environmental contaminants with different mode of actions i.e., paraquat, cadmium, benzo[a]pyrene, and chloropyrifos. CrSOD gene expression was significantly up or down regulated in response to exposure to the chemicals tested. The overall results suggested that SOD gene expression provided a platform for the understanding of oxidative stress responses caused by exposure to various environmental contaminants, and the SOD genes could be used as biomarkers for environmental disturbances such as oxidative stress initiated by xenobiotics.

J	FRANCE, LL; GEACINTOV, NE; BRETON, J; VALKUNAS, L								THE DEPENDENCE OF THE DEGREES OF SIGMOIDICITIES OF FLUORESCENCE INDUCTION CURVES IN SPINACH-CHLOROPLASTS ON THE DURATION OF ACTINIC PULSES IN PUMP-PROBE EXPERIMENTS								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA				1101	1			105	119		10.1016/0167-4838(92)90474-R				JUL 6 1992	1992	Utilizing a pump-probe double flash method, the shapes of the fluorescence induction curves in spinach chloroplasts (0-degrees-C), and the induction ratio R = F(M)/F(o) (F(o) and F(M) are the fluorescence yields when all PS II reaction centers are open, and closed, respectively) were studied as a function of: (1) the duration (t1) of the pump flash, (2) the number of pump flashes, (3) absence or presence of DCMU, and (4) the time interval DELTA-t between the pump and the probe flashes. In the pump-probe technique, an actinic pulse (P1) of different fluences closes a fraction q of the PS II reaction centers. After a variable time interval DELTA-t a second, weak pulse (P2), is used to measure the variable fluorescence yield F(v). The shapes of the fluorescence induction curves (F(v) vs. the fluence of the P1 pulse) were analyzed in terms of the standard equation F(v) = (1 - p)q/(1 - pq), where p is a parameter describing the connectivity between different photosynthetic units (Joliot, A. and Joliot, P. (1964) C. R. Acad. Sci. 13, 4622-4625). The shapes of the F(v) curves are found to depend only on the width (t1) of the pump pulses. For t1 less-than-or-equal-to 300 ps, the curves are exponential in shape with p = 0.0 and R < 2.5. However, for pulse durations t1 in the millisecond range, and employing the same probe flash method for measuring the variable fluorescence, the F(v) curves assume the same familiar sigmoidal shapes as in the case of conventional steady-state illumination. With t1 in the microsecond range (t1 almost-equal-to 0.7-2-mu-s), the F(v) curves are more nearly exponential than sigmoidal in shape with p values generally around almost-equal-to 0.3 and R < 3. For t1 greater-than-or-equal-to 50-mu-s, the fluorescence induction curves are sigmoidal in shape and, generally, p values of 0.55-0.60 are observed with R > 3. A sequential hit model (Valkunas, L., Geacintov, N.E., France, L. and Breton, J. (1991) Biophys. J. 59, 397-408), in which the PS II reaction centers evolve through different states characterized by differences in fluorescence yields, a process characterized by a dark-time t1 of almost-equal-to 2-50-mu-s between two successive hits, can account for these results. This model is consistent with the concept of interunit transfer of excitations. However, the shapes of the fluorescence induction curves cannot provide any information on the value of p within the context of this model.									31	0	0	0	24	0	31			0006-3002			WOS:A1992JE42100015

The ammonia-modified forms of these two signals were also examined. The g = 4 signal obtained in oriented PSII membranes treated with NH4Cl at pH 7.5 displays at least 16 partially resolved Mn hyperfine transitions with a regular spacing of 36 G [Kim, D. H., Britt, R. D., Klein, M. P., & Sauer, K. (1990) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 112, 9389-9391]. The observation of this g = 4 "multiline signal" provides strong spectral evidence for a tetranuclear Mn origin for the g = 4 signal and is strongly suggestive of a model in which different spin state configurations of a single exchange-coupled Mn cluster give rise to the g = 4 and g = 2 multiline signals. A simulation shows the observed spectrum to be consistent with an S = 3/2 or S = 5/2 state of a tetranuclear Mn complex. The resolution of hyperfine structure on the NH3-modified g = 4 signal is strongly dependent on sample orientation, with no resolved hyperfine structure when the membrane normal is oriented perpendicular to the applied magnetic field. The dramatic NH3-induced changes in the g = 4 signal resolved in the spectra of oriented samples are suggestive that NH3 binding at the Cl- site of the OEC may represent direct coordination of NH3 to the Mn cluster. Orientation dependence data on the g = 2 multiline signal show that the hyperfine transitions in the wings of the signal are anisotropic. These peaks remain unresolved in the powder spectrum of the g = 2 multiline signal. The g tensor for the g = 2 multiline signal may be more anisotropic than previously thought.									84	0	0	0	37	0	84			0006-2960			WOS:A1992HA99300034	1310041

This work reviews current methods for production of hydrogen and discusses the negative impacts of methods that depend on fossil material to produce hydrogen. The work then reviews the technologies for production of hydrogen using water electrolysis as a clean source of hydrogen production utilising energy from renewables with strong emphasis on the use of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolytic cells. The components of PEM electrolyser cell are analysed and their impact on the cell operations are examined. The work discusses the performance of PEM electrolysers and examines the different challenges that face the development of these cells components and the effect of operational conditions on cell construction materials and their longevity. The work analyse published research that discusses the impact cells material deterioration has on cell performance and deviation from optimum operational conditions. Degradation effects at varying operational conditions are discussed along with some mitigation strategies that can be used to improve cells durability and efficiency. This includes the material composition of components in the electrolyser that contribute significantly to the overall efficiency of the cell.The work concludes by suggesting areas for further research to help improve the competitiveness of PEM cells electrolysers.									44	2	0	0	0	0	45			1364-0321			WOS:000471252700001		
J	Chen, Chih-Yu; Yen, Shao-Hsiung; Chung, Ying-Chien								Combination of photoreactor and packed bed bioreactor for the removal of ethyl violet from wastewater								CHEMOSPHERE				117				494	501		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.08.069				DEC 2014	2014	An efficient treatment system that combines a photoreactor and packed bed bioreactor (PBR) was developed and evaluated for treating ethyl violet (EV)-containing wastewater. Initial experiments demonstrated that the optimal operating parameters for the photoreactor in treating EV-containing wastewater were 2 h reaction time, pH of 7, and 2 min liquid retention time. Under these conditions, the photocatalytic reaction achieved a 61% EV removal efficiency and resulted in a significant BOD/COD increase in the solution. The results displayed by the coupled photobiological system achieved a removal efficiency of 85% and EC50 of the solution increased by 19 times in a semi-continuous mode when the EV concentration was <150 mg L-1. The effect of shock loading on the EV removal was temporary but coexisting substrate (glucose and crystal violet) at specific levels would affect the EV removal efficiency of the PBR Phylogenetic analysis in the PBR indicated that the major bacteria species were Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, Ralstonia pickettii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Comamonas sp. Furthermore, the possible degrading mechanisms of this coupled system were demethylation, deethylation, aromatic ring opening, nitrification, and carbon oxidation. The intermediates were characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. These results indicated that the coupled photobiological system provides an effective method of EV removal.

PHOTOSYNTHETICA				42	1			7	14		10.1023/B:PHOT.0000040563.64215.63				2004	2004	The degree of photoinhibition of sun and shade grown leaves of grapevine was determined by means of the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence (F-v/F-m) and electron transport measurements. The potential efficiency of photosystern 2 (PS2), F-v/F-m, markedly declined under high irradiance (HI) in shade leaves with less than 10 % of F-0 level. In contrast, Fv/Fm ratio declined with about 20 % increase of F-0 level in sun leaves. In isolated thylakoids, the rate of whole chain and PS2 activity in HI shade and sun leaves was decreased by about 60 and 40 %, respectively. A smaller inhibition of photosystern 1 (PS1) activity was also observed in both leaf types. In the subsequent dark incubation, fast recovery was observed in both leaf types that reached maximum PS2 efficiencies similar to non-photoinhibited control leaves. The artificial exogenous electron donors DPC, NH2OH, and Mn2+ failed to restore the HI-induced loss of PS2 activity in sun leaves, while DPC and NH2OH were significantly restored in shade leaves. Hence HI in shade leaves inactivates on the donor side of PS2 whereas it does at the acceptor side in sun leaves, respectively. Quantification of the PS2 reaction centre protein D1 and the 33 kDa protein of water splitting complex following HI-treatment of leaves showed pronounced differences between shade and sun leaves. The marked loss of PS2 activity in HI leaves was due to the marked loss of D1 protein of the PS2 reaction centre protein and the 33 kDa protein of the water splitting complex in sun and shade leaves, respectively.									16	3	0	0	13	4	20			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000222901100002

The structure of glasses with biomedically active molecular compositions, (P2O5)(0.45)(CaO)(x)(Na2O)(0.55-x) (x = 0.30, 0.35 and 0.40), have been generated using first principles molecular dynamics simulations for the full melt-and-quench procedure and the changes in the structural properties as the 3000 K melt is cooled down to room temperature have been compared extensively with those of the final glasses. The melts are characterized by a significant fraction of threefold (P-3c) and fivefold (P-5c) phosphorus atoms, but structural defects rapidly decrease during the cooling phase and for temperatures lower than 1800 K the system is free of under-and over-coordinated species. The analysis of the structures of the glasses at 300 K shows a prevalence of the metaphosphate Q(2) and pyrophosphate Q(1) species, whereas the number of Q(3) units, which constitute the three-dimensional phosphate network, significantly decreases with the increase of calcium content in the glass. The radial and angular distribution functions indicate that higher calcium concentration in the glass leads to an increase of the rigidity of the phosphate tetrahedral network, which has been explained in terms of the calcium's higher field strength compared to that of sodium. The structural characterization of the melts and glasses obtained from first principles simulations was used to assess and validate a recently developed interatomic shell-model force field for phosphate-based materials. For all three compositions, our potential model is in good agreement with the first principles data. In the glass network, the forcefield provides a very good description of the split between the shorter distances of phosphorus to non-bonded oxygen and the longer distances of the phosphorus to bonded oxygen; the phosphorus-phosphorus medium-range distribution; and the coordination environment around the Na and Ca glass modifiers. Moreover, the distribution of the Q(n) species in the melts and glasses is in excellent agreement with the values extracted from the first principles simulations. In contrast, simulations using standard rigid ion potentials do not provide a satisfactory description of the local short-range structure of phosphate-based glasses and are therefore less suitable to model this class of multicomponent amorphous system.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2050-750X	2050-7518		WOS:000324425600019	32261096

Results showed that as the temperature increase, the COD removal exhibited two best performances at 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C, and the maximum NH3-N removal was obtained at 35 degrees C and 40 degrees C The optimum temperature for extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) yield is 45 degrees C and the humic acid was the major contributor. Microbial community was analyzed by the association of DGGE, real-time PCR and high-throughput sequencing technologies. The highest abundance of AOB (characterized by amoA genes) was obtained at 35 degrees C, and it confirmed that the biofilm (attached on fillers) can facilitate the AOB abundance maintaining in the sludge. The "precursor and successor" thermophilic communities were enriched and dominant at different temperature stages, which mainly conclude genera Caldilinea (from 35 degrees C to 45 degrees C) and genera Rubellimicrobium and Pseudoxanthomonas (over 50 degrees C), respectively. It meant the thermophilic community displayed great evolution at the critical temperature "45 degrees C vertical bar 50 degrees C". Additionally, the process of thermotolerant mechanism establishment of the sludge in the MBBRs is proposed and the "two-stage enrichment" of different thermophilic communities was considered as the key procedure.

The methods used included long-PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (L-PCR RFLP) analysis and DNA hybridization. All elements had conserved vanRSHAX genes, but variation occurred upstream of vanR and downstream of vanX. Twenty-one VanA elements had significant alterations upstream of vanR in the transposition genes orf1 and orf2: either parts of these genes were absent or they were disrupted by IS1216V or IS3-like insertion sequences. Among VanA elements with alterations downstream of vanX, seven lacked vanY, one lacked both vanY and vanZ, and ten had copies of insertion sequence IS1216V between vanX and vanY. All VanA elements of group D (from geographically and temporally diverse enterococci) were characterized by the presence of an IS1216V/IS3-like/orf1 complex and a point mutation in vanX, both of which were absent from the other 23 groups of VanA elements. This finding is consistent with the dissemination of a stable resistance element. We conclude that L-PCR RFLP analysis, combined with DNA hybridization, merits further development for studying the evolution and epidemiology of VanA resistance elements in enterococci.									63	0	0	0	49	3	63			0305-7453	1460-2091		WOS:000077186400007	9848444

Electrochemical impedance Spectroscopy and mechanism of discharge of the plate								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				149	5			A654	A661		10.1149/1.1468645				MAY 2002	2002	This paper is the second part of an investigation whose purpose is to establish the mechanism of the processes that proceed during discharge and cycling of the lead dioxide plate of the lead acid battery (LAB). On the basis of this mechanism some electrical parameters that can show the state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) have to be distinguished. In the first part of this study the shape of the charge potential transient was examined. In this part the electrochemical impedance spectra of a model lead dioxide electrode was investigated in charged and discharged states as well as the changes in impedance spectra during cycling of the electrode with high and low charge currents. It was established that during cycling the values of charge-transfer resistance (R-et), ion diffusion resistance (R-diff) in the reaction layer, resistance of the grid/PAM interface (R-i), and ohmic resistance of the electrode (R-Omega) change smoothly at first with cycling and after a critical number of cycles have been reached, they start to increase fast. This shows that the electrode is close to the end of its life. The above parameters can be used for the determination of SOH of the positive LAB plate. The discharge processes take place on active centers (ACs) in positive active material (PAM) and interface. A model of the structure of ACs as well as a scheme of the elementary reactions proceeding at discharge in the ACs is proposed. During cycling when the number of ACs in PAM decreases and this one in the interface increases, the capacity of the electrode decreases. On the basis of the changes in the impedance spectra at discharge and charge the changes in equivalent electrical circuit are discussed.

J	CONWAY, BE								ELECTROCHEMICAL OXIDE FILM FORMATION AT NOBLE-METALS AS A SURFACE-CHEMICAL PROCESS								PROGRESS IN SURFACE SCIENCE				49	4			331	452		10.1016/0079-6816(95)00040-6				AUG 1995	1995	The mechanisms of electrochemical oxide film formation at noble metals are described and exemplified by the cases of Pt and Au, especially in the light of recent experimentation by means of cyclic voltammetry, ellipsometry and vacuum surface-science studies using LEED and AES.Unlike the mechanisms of base-metal oxidation, e.g., in corrosion processes, anodic oxide film formation at noble metals proceeds by surface chemical processes involving, initially, sub-monolayer, through monolayer, formation of 2-dimensional OH/O arrays. During such 2-d processes, place-exchange between electrosorbed OH or 0 species on the surface, and Pt or Au atoms within the surface lattice, takes place leading to a quasi-2-d compact film which then grows ultimately to a multilayer hydrous oxide film, probably by continuing injection of ions of the substrate metal and their migration through the growing film under the influence of the field.The initial, sub-monolayer stage of electrosorption of OH involves competitive chemisorption by anions, e.g. HSO4-, ClO4-, Cl-, which inhibits onset of the first stage of surface oxidation. These processes are demonstrable in experiments on single-crystal surfaces. The combination of such anion effects with place-exchange during the extension of the film, leads to a general mechanism of noble metal oxide film formation.The formation of the oxide films can be examined in detail by recording the distinguishable stages in the film's electrochemical reduction in linear-sweep voltammetry which is sensitive down to OH/O fractional coverages as low as 0.5% acid over time-scales down to 50 mu s in experiments on time-evolution and transformation of the states of the oxide films.By means of LEED, AES and STM or AFM experiments, the reconstructions and perturbations (e.g. generation of stepped terraces) which oxide films cause on single-crystal surfaces can be followed.									498	4	2	0	18	3	501			0079-6816			WOS:A1995TC55700001

Herein, we synthesized ultrathin-layered MoS2 nanoflowers and nanosheets with rich active sites by using a facile hydrothermal technique. The photocatalytic performance of the as-synthesized MoS2 nanoflowers (NF) and nanosheets (NS) were investigated for the photodegradation of MB (methylene blue), MG (malachite Green), and RhB (rhodamine B) dye under visible light irradiations. Ultrathin-layered nanoflowers showed faster degradation (96% in 150 min) in RhB under visible light irradiation, probably due to a large number of active sites and high available surface area. The kinetic study demonstrated that the first-order kinetic model best explained the process of photodegradation. The MoS2 nanoflowers catalysts has similar catalytic performance after four consecutive cyclic performances, demonstrating their good stability. The results showed that the MoS2 nanoflowers have outstanding visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity and could be an effective catalyst for industrial wastewater treatment.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0743-7463			WOS:000763594600028	35072482

However, the bacterium remains poised to resume replicating so that it can transmit itself to a new host. Knowledge of the metabolic adaptations used to facilitate entry into and exit from nonreplicative states remains incomplete. Here, we apply C-13-based metabolomic profiling to characterize the activity of M. tuberculosis tricarboxylic acid cycle during adaptation to and recovery from hypoxia, a physiologically relevant condition associated with nonreplication. We show that, as M. tuberculosis adapts to hypoxia, it slows and remodels its tricarboxylic acid cycle to increase production of succinate, which is used to flexibly sustain membrane potential, ATP synthesis, and anaplerosis, in response to varying degrees of O-2 limitation and the presence or absence of the alternate electron acceptor nitrate. This remodeling is mediated by the bifunctional enzyme isocitrate lyase acting in a noncanonical role distinct from fatty acid catabolism. Isocitrate lyase-dependent production of succinate affords M. tuberculosis with a unique and bioenergetically efficient metabolic means of entry into and exit fromhypoxia-induced quiescence.									188	1	0	0	170	1	189			0027-8424			WOS:000318041500068	23576728	
J	RAO, PV; KRISHNA, CM; ZIGLER, JS								IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ENZYMATIC-ACTIVITY OF ZETA-CRYSTALLIN FROM GUINEA-PIG LENS - A NOVEL NADPH-QUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				267	1			96	102						JAN 5 1992	1992	Zeta-crystallin is a major protein in the lens of certain mammals. In guinea pigs it comprises 10% of the total lens protein, and it has been shown that a mutation in the zeta-crystallin gene is associated with autosomal dominant congenital cataract. As with several other lens crystallins of limited phylogenetic distribution, zeta-crystallin has been characterized as an "enzyme/crystallin" based on its ability to reduce catalytically the electron acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. We report here that certain naturally occurring quinones are good substrates for the enzymatic activity of zeta-crystallin. Among the various quinones tested, the orthoquinones 1,2-naphthoquinone and 9,10-phenanthrenequinone were the best substrates whereas menadione, ubiquinone, 9,10-anthraquinone, vitamins K1 and K2 were inactive as substrates. This quinone reductase activity was NADPH specific and exhibited typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Activity was sensitive to heat and sulfhydryl reagents but was very stable on freezing. Dicumarol (K(i) = 1.3 x 10(-5) M) and nitrofurantoin (K(i) = 1.4 x 10(-5) M) inhibited the activity competitively with respect to the electron acceptor, quinone. NADPH protected the enzyme against inactivation caused by heat, N-ethylmaleimide, or H2O2. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of the reaction products showed formation of a semiquinone radical. The enzyme activity was associated with O2 consumption, generation of O2- and H2O2, and reduction of ferricytochrome c. These properties indicate that the enzyme acts through a one-electron transfer process. The substrate specificity, reaction characteristics, and physicochemical properties of zeta-crystallin demonstrate that it is an active NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase distinct from quinone reductases described previously.									161	3	0	0	141	0	166			0021-9258			WOS:A1992GY43900021	1370456

Herein, CeO2/CdSe-Diethylenetriamine (CeO2/CdSe-DETA) nano composites are synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal method and are applied for photocatalytic H-2 production. By changing the content of CdSe-DETA in the nano composites, the photocatalytic H-2 production activity of the nanocomposites can be changed. The CeO2/CdSe-DETA nanocomposite with a CdSe-DETA content of 27.68% has the best photocatalytic H-2 production activity. Under visible light irradiation, the H-2 evolution rate of this nanocomposite is 3.71 mol g(-1) h(-1), which is 7 times than that of CdSeDETA. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the CeO2/CdSe-DETA nanocomposites can be explained by the following points. First, the CeO2 and CdSe-DETA form a step-scheme heterojunction, which effectively promotes the separation of electron-hole pairs and reduces the resistance of electron migration. Second, the CeO2/CdSe-DETA nanocomposites have good absorption efficiency to visible light. Third, the nanocomposites inherit the large specific surface area of constituent materials. This work provides a feasible approach to obtain highly efficient photocatalysts with step-scheme heterojunction, and may be promising for photocatalytic H-2 production.

The effects of main processing parameters, namely the solution precursor concentration, spraying distance, reactor pressure, and atomization gas flow rate, have been analyzed using D-optimal design of experiments regarding the deposition rate and coating porosity responses. Among these four parameters, the solution precursor concentration had the greatest influent on the coating structure, followed by the spraying distance and reactor pressure, and finally the atomization gas flow rate with a small contribution. It is pointed out that the species that impact on the substrate are agglomerates of nanoparticles. The equivalent thermal conductivity of selected coatings was computed from experimental temperature evolution curves obtained by laser flash thermal diffusivity analysis, using two methods: a multilayer finite-element model with optimization, and a multilayer thermal diffusion model. The results of the two models agree, with coatings exhibiting low thermal conductivity between 0.7 and 1 W/(m K) at 800 A degrees C.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1059-9630	1544-1016		WOS:000385352100004

The blood clam (Tegillarca granosa) is one of the few mollusks that has Hb, although the structure and function of molluskan Hbs remain unclear. We characterized two unique and highly compartmentalized blood clam hemoglobin genes, Tg-HbIIA and Tg-HbIIB, at the molecular level. The full-length cDNA of Tg-HbIIA was 731 bp with a 450-bp open reading frame encoding 150 amino acids; that of Tg-HbIIB was 698 bp, with a 456-bp open reading frame encoding 152 amino acids. Their intronic regions were amplified by PCR. The two genes showed the typical 2 intron/3 exon organization found in T. granosa. The 3-D structures of the three blood clam Tg-Hbs were predicted using the SWISS-MODEL Protein Modeling Server, and a phylogenetic analysis was conducted to investigate its evolution. As quantified by qRT-PCR, the expression levels of Tg-HbIIA and Tg-HbIIB were significantly upregulated upon challenge by Vibrio parahaemolyticus, lipopolysaccharides, and peptidoglycans. Three Hb isoforms, Tg-HbI, Tg-HbIIA, and Tg-HbIIB, were found. Specific structures and evolutionary features were found in these molluskan Hb genes. Challenge experiments indicated that Tg-Hbs are involved in immune defense responses against bacterial infection and bacterial pathogenic factors. As this is the first functional research on Hb genes in the blood clam, our findings provide new insight into the innate immune defense mechanisms of T. granosa.									14	1	0	0	12	0	15			1676-5680			WOS:000331717400099	23479150

The photocatalytic performance for the hydrogen generation rate via water splitting was measured. The results revealed that CoFe2O4 exhibits a sheet-like nanoporous structure and that abundant mesopores are distributed in the nanosheets. NiFe2O4 shows a typical pore-ligament structure. The measurements show that hydrogen generation is exhibited by both oxides because the bandgap of CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 is higher than the water oxidization potential. The hydrogen generation rate is approximately 0.088 mmol h d(-1) g(-1) for CoFe2O4 and 0.026 mmol h d(-1) g(-1) for NiFe2O4 when the TEOA (10 vol%) sacrificial agent is adopted. This performance is significantly higher than that of methanol as the scavenger because TEOA increases the pH value of the solution, changes the negative shift in the conduction band energy level and improves the electron transport efficiency. The higher performance of CoFe2O4 is attributed to its larger specific surface area, ample unimpeded penetration diffusion paths and higher electron transfer rate.

The influences of thermal shock temperatures on the crystal structure, morphology, surface functional groups and surface composition of modified catalysts were investigated by XRD, TEM, Raman and XPS spectra, respectively. Their photocatalytic activity was evaluated via the degradation of methylene blue under both UVA and visible light irradiation. According to the results, by combining the thermal shock method and an agent with low thermal stability such as Cu(NO3)(2), we did not modify the crystal structure, phase composition nor the morphology of ZnO nanoparticles, but successfully modified the surface of ZnO nanoparticles with the migration of zinc ions, leading to the creation of new environments of Zn2+ and O2 - ions as well as the formation of surface zinc vacancies. These evolutions were found to be able to enhance the photocatalytic performance in the UVA light region and also in the visible light region.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2187-0764			WOS:000511777300001

The accuracy of the results has been confirmed through a sum-rule analysis of the free energy with respect to screening potentials at zero separation in one-component plasmas. Phase diagrams for various BIM's appropriate to white-dwarf interiors are constructed, including the effects of compressibility of the relativistically degenerate electrons. Eutectic diagrams, which result in significant chemical separation upon solidification, are predicted for BIM's with R(z) greater than or similar to 1.6. Free energies for dense ternary-ionic mixtures are also derived for both fluid and solid phases through comparison of the corresponding MC internal energies and by a sum-rule analysis using BIM screening potentials at zero separation. We apply the results to the process of solidification of C-12-O-16-Ne22 mixtures in the interiors of white dwarfs. We find that chemical separation does indeed occur at solidification, and we obtain the result that nearly pure Ne cores are formed in such white dwarfs, even though Ne is only a trace element in the mixture.									60	0	0	0	0	0	60			1063-651X			WOS:A1993LV38300087	9960720

Nonetheless, many of these compounds undergo self-oxidation of the non-oxide anions by photogenerated holes. Herein, we present new metal oxychloride intergrowths based on Bi4TaO8Cl-Bi2GdO4Cl as stable visible light photocatalysts. These intergrowths were prepared using a halide flux method, with their crystal structures analyzed by Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction data and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. These analyses support intergrowth formation. The Ta/Gd molar ratio was systematically varied in the intergrowths to rationalize the effect of charge separation and changes in band structure toward photocatalytic water-splitting activity. Furthermore, these intergrowths are capable of sustained overall water splitting in a Z-scheme with Ru/SrTiO3/Rh as a hydrogen evolution catalyst. The high stability of these intergrowth materials is attributed to O 2p orbitals at the valance band edge rather than Cl 3p orbitals, as discerned from electronic structure calculations. These results provide new strategies for designing durable artificial photosynthetic systems by rational modulation of crystal and electronic structure.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000610984700033

The present study provided a strategy to improve efficiency of TiO2-based photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water splitting based on an interesting structure-property relationship. The hydrogen treated Au/TiO2 photocatalysts with three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) structure were successfully synthesized and well characterized through various methods. The 3DOM-structure and Au modification can promote the hydrogenation of TiO2. The light absorption can be improved by slow photon effect of the 3DOM structure. And, in the meanwhile, the hydrogenation as well as Au modification can improve the photogenerated carrier separation. In addition, to understand how hydrogenation and Au modification promote electron migration and decrease carrier recombination, the electric band structure for hydrogen treated Au/3DOM-TiO2 was well studied and we found the local electron field enhancement, surface band bending and the generation of mid-gap state contributed most of enhancement.									28	4	0	0	4	0	28			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000503381200133

Herein, a 3D cross-linked heterostructure ZnO/CdS/BiOI nanorod arrays (NRAs) has been prepared by a simple solvothermal strategy. Under visible light illumination (lambda > 420 nm), the ZnO/CdS/BiOI NRAs photoanode shows an excellent PEC activity and generates a photocurrent density of 9.12 mA cm(-2) at 1.1 V vs. RHE, which is 1.8 times higher than that of the ZnO/CdS NRAs photoanode in the alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, the photoanode achieves a high photo conversion efficiency of 3.49% and a long-time stability over 6000 s. It is proposed that the BiOI nanosheets not only serve as protecting layer to restrain the photocorrosion of CdS, but also facilitate the charge separation in CdS by the virtue of the p-n junction formed between CdS and BiOI.

With the growing capacity of localized renewable energy sources surpassing the gigawatt range, a storage system of equal magnitude is required. PEM electrolysis provides a sustainable solution for the production of hydrogen, and is well suited to couple with energy sources such as wind and solar. However, due to low demand in electrolytic hydrogen in the last century, little research has been done on PEM electrolysis with many challenges still unexplored. The ever increasing desire for green energy has rekindled the interest on PEM electrolysis, thus the compilation and recovery of past research and developments is important and necessary. In this review, PEM water electrolysis is comprehensively highlighted and discussed. The challenges new and old related to electrocatalysts, solid electrolyte, current collectors, separator plates and modeling efforts will also be addressed. The main message is to clearly set the state-of-the-art for the PEM electrolysis technology, be insightful of the research that is already done and the challenges that still exist. This information will provide several future research directions and a road map in order to aid scientists in establishing PEM electrolysis as a commercially viable hydrogen production solution.

Highly ordered TNTs were first prepared by electrochemical anodization of Ti sheets. Ag nanoparticles with a diameter of about 20 nm were then uniformly deposited inside and on the orifice of the TNTs. In2O3 nanoparticles synthesized through a solvent-thermal method were subsequently modified on the Ag-TNTs using an ultrasound-assisted electrophoresis method. In2O3-Ag-TNTs composites exhibited enhanced visible light absorption and photocurrent when compared to binary Ag-TNTs and In2O3-TNTs. As a result, the optimal hydrogen generation rate using the In2O3-Ag-TNTs composite under visible light irradiation was 1.92 mu mol cm(-2) h(-1), 5 times higher than that of the pure TNTs.									2	1	0	0	1	0	3			2196-0216			WOS:000616887800016

Noble metal LSPR materials suffer from high costs and negative impacts to environment, while metal-free materials usually have low efficiencies. In this work, we demonstrate that one-dimensional carbon nanotubes/two-dimensional ultrathin carbon nitride (1D SWCNT/2D C3N4) can serve as non-resonant plasmonic photo catalysts. The catalyst shows a stoichiometric production of H-2 (49.8 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) and O-2 (22.8 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) in overall water splitting, with a prominent H-2 production rate of 1346 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). The significantly enhanced photocatalysis is attributed to the non-resonant plasmonic effect, as confirmed by the increased spectral response within both ultraviolet and visible light regions, and the results of finite element method simulation. Moreover, the contributions from ultrathin morphology, long average carrier lifetime (2.54 ns), and the electronic coupling effect of the nanohybrids collectively intensify the photocatalytic water splitting.									55	5	0	0	2	0	56			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000564575200004

In this study, we found that the removal efficiency of Cr(VI) can be greatly enhanced over a wide pH range (3.00-11.00) by mechanically activated mZVAl (MA-mZVAl), which was prepared from mZVAl by ball milling (BM) in the presence of additive NaCl. Compared with mZVAl, at initial pH 7.00, MA-mZVAl removed Cr(VI) at a roughly 292-fold faster rate. The effects of BM parameters including the amount of additive NaCl, BM speed, BM time, and BM atmosphere on Cr(VI) removal were first evaluated. Then, the Cr(VI) removal mechanism was explored by measuring the concentration of different valent chromium, monitoring the changes of water chemical parameters including DO, pH, ORP, Al ions concentration, and by ascertaining the role of Cl- in solution. Furthermore, the structure evolution of mZVAl after BM and the surface corrosion mechanism of MA-mZVAl during reaction with Cr(VI) were unveiled through the characterization by means of SEM-EDS, BET, XRD, and XPS. Based on above tests, we found that Cr(VI) was reductively removed by MA-mZVAl to form Cr(OH) 3(s) precipitated on the surface of MA-mZVAl. NaCl promoted the reactivity of MA-mZVAl not in corrosion process but in BM process. The dense oxide film was destroyed by BM, and changed into a rough Al-(hydr) oxide film after corrosion. The reusability of MA-mZVAl was hindered by the formation of Al and Cr (hydr) oxide, but can be easily and completely rejuvenated by BM. Overall, BM can not only break through the bottleneck of oxide film but recover the passivated MA-mZVAl. Therefore, MA-mZVAl particles are of considerable potential for pollutants removal.									31	2	0	0	15	0	31			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000441527900075

However, their slow reaction kinetics hinders the improvement in electrochemical performance. Herein, a hybrid structure of P-doped Co3O4 (P-Co3O4) ultrafine nanoparticles in situ encapsulated into P, N co-doped carbon (P, N-C) nanowires by a pyrolysis-oxidation-phosphorization of 1D metal-organic frameworks derived from Co-layered double hydroxide as self-template and reactant is reported. This hybrid structure prevents active material agglomeration and maintains a 1D oriented arrangement, which exhibits a large accessible surface area and hierarchically porous feature, enabling sufficient permeation and transfer of electrolyte ions. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the P dopants in P-Co3O4@P, N-C could reduce the adsorption energy of OH- and regulate the electrical properties. Accordingly, the P-Co3O4@P, N-C delivers a high specific capacity of 669 mC cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2) and an ultralong cycle life with only 4.8% loss over 5000 cycles at 30 mA cm(-2). During the fabrication of P-Co3O4@P, N-C, Co@P, N-C is simultaneously developed, which can be integrated with P-Co3O4@P, N-C for the assembly of asymmetric supercapacitors. These devices achieve a high energy density of 47.6 W h kg(-1) at 750 W kg(-1) and impressive flexibility, exhibiting a great potential in practical applications.									59	5	0	0	2	0	60			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000505039200001	31894633

Here we test whether exposure to a conditioning bout of anoxia early in adulthood induces a hormetic response that confers resistance to oxidative stress and enhances male sexual performance later in life in the Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa. Anoxic conditioning of adults prior to emergence led to an increase in antioxidant capacity driven by mitochondrial superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. When exposed to gamma irradiation, a strong oxidative stressor, males that received anoxic conditioning had lower lipid and protein oxidative damage at sexual maturity. Anoxia conditioning led to greater male sexual competitiveness compared with unconditioned males when both were irradiated, although there was no effect of anoxia conditioning on mating competitiveness in unirradiated males. Anoxia also led to higher adult emergence rates and greater flight ability in irradiation-stressed flies while preserving sterility. Thus, hormetic treatments that increased antioxidant enzyme activity also improved male performance after irradiation, suggesting that antioxidant enzymes play an important role in mediating the relationship between oxidative stress and sexual selection. Furthermore, our work has important applied implications for the sterile insect technique (SIT), an environmentally friendly method of insect pest control where males are sterilized by irradiation and deployed in the field to disrupt pest populations via mating. We suggest that hormetic treatments specifically designed to enhance antioxidant activity may produce more sexually competitive sterile males, thus improving the efficacy and economy of SIT programs.									58	0	0	0	52	1	58			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000304423200022	22623204

The constitution and composition were studied by X-ray diffraction and elastic recoil detection analysis, respectively. Increasing the substrate bias potential from -50 to -100 V caused the amorphous or weakly crystalline films to evolve into stoichiometric, crystalline films with a mixture of the alpha- and gamma-phase above 700 degrees C, and. gamma-phase dominated films at temperatures as low as 200 degrees C. All films had a grain size of < 10 nm. The combined constitution and grain size data is consistent with previous work stating that. - alumina is thermodynamically stable at grain sizes < 12 nm [McHale et al., Science 277, 788 ( 1997)]. In order to correlate phase formation with synthesis conditions, the plasma chemistry and ion energy distributions were measured at synthesis conditions. These results indicate that for a substrate bias potential of - 50V, ion energies in excess of 100 eV are attained, both from a high energy tail and the accelerated ions with charge > 1. These results are of importance for an increased understanding of the evolution of film composition and microstructure, also providing a pathway to. - alumina growth at temperatures as low as 200 degrees C.									49	3	1	0	0	0	52			0272-4324			WOS:000230912400001

Advanced materials for hydrogen-gas generation from water splitting using photonic energy have gained importance in modern science technology owing to the depletion of fossil fuels. In this study, an integrated ternary Na2Ti3O7/V2O5/g-C3N4 composite was prepared, and its performance in both hydrogen production from water splitting and organic-dye degradation was evaluated under visible-light illumination. Furthermore, the electrochemical behavior of Na2Ti3O7/V2O5/g-C3N4 was studied. The structural, morphological, and chemical properties of the prepared ternary composites were thoroughly analyzed through various analytical techniques. The ternary composite of Na2Ti3O7/V2O5/g-C3N4 exhibited admirable photocatalytic kinetics for H-2 production and dye degradation, which was three times greater than that of Na2Ti3O7/V2O5. Moreover, the rate of RhB dye degradation by Na2Ti3O7/V2O5/g-C3N4 was higher than that of the Na2Ti3O7/V2O5 catalyst under identical conditions.									42	0	0	0	4	0	42			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000537570200130

The morphology and structure of the composites were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. The g-C3N4/KNbO(3 )composites exhibited the better photocatalytic performance for water splitting more than 2 and 1.8 times of the pure g-C3N4 and KNbO3. Meanwhile, the Pt nanoparticles as a co-catalyst were deposited on the surface of g-C3N4/KNbO3 as Pt-g-C3N4/KNbO3 composites for water splitting which enhanced photocatalytic properties almost 74 and 14 times than that of Pt-KNbO3 and Pt-g-C3N4. Such a significant improvement of the photocatalytic activity was mainly ascribed to the photoinduced electron-holes in the interface of g-C3N4/KNbO3 composites rapid separation and the co-catalysis effect of Pt nanoparticles.

Herein, water splitting-inactive electrode materials of mesoporous carbon were fabricated through the dehalogenation of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) by sodium ethoxide (EtONa). The as-generated EtOH and NaF were demonstrated to facilitate the formation of hierarchical porous carbon based on the bubble and templating effects. Due to full dehalogenation, the resulting carbon materials acquired high contents of carbon without unfavorable alien dopants. The resulting porous, dehalogenated, carbon materials were applied as electrode materials for an aqueous supercapacitor neutral electrolyte. The significantly suppressed water-splitting activity has been addressed in the electrochemical system. Therefore, the open circuit voltage (OCV) could be safely expanded to 2.0 V. Over 94.0% of the capacitance was also maintained after cycling 5000 times at 5.0 A g(-1). Our strategy that utilizes water-splitting inactive electrode materials to expand the working window of an aqueous supercapacitor may enable the design of materials for aqueous supercapacitors with higher OCVs over 2.0 V.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000398323400044

The Au/TiO2 nanosheets with Au NPs of different sizes ranging from similar to 3 nm to 28 nm were prepared by using hydrothermally obtained TiO2 nanosheets as substrate via urea and light reduction method. During synthesis, the obtained Au NPs through urea reduction treatment in different calcination temperatures possessed smaller size (similar to 3-13 nm) than those of the light reduction method (similar to 28 nm). The introduced Au NPs were tightly loaded on the surface of TiO2 nanosheets through in situ growth reduction process of chloroauric acid. The emergence of smaller Au NPs promoted the photocatalytic performance over Au/TiO2 nanosheets. The as-prepared Au/TiO2 nanosheets with small Au NP sizes of similar to 3-5 nm showed the highest photocatalytic rate of hydrogen production (similar to 230 mu mol.h(-1)) under xenon lamp illumination, exceeding more than twice that of Au/TiO2 nanosheets with loading of larger Au NPs (similar to 28 nm). The favorable constituents and combination of Au/TiO2 nanosheets provided large surface adsorptive sites for reactant adsorption, introduced plasmonic effects and formed Schottky barrier junction via surface plasmon resonance. The Schottky barrier height was lower due to the presence of smaller Au NPs, thereby enhancing the charge separation through the Schottky transfer hub to neighboring TiO2 nanosheets. The synergistic effect between the plasmonic hot carrier-driven Au NPs and TiO2 nanosheets was discussed. The photocatalytic mechanism was also proposed for the fabrication of visible light restricted photocatalysts with smaller Au NPs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Thanks to their photosynthetic apparatus, capable of splitting water into O-2, protons, and electrons, this large and morphologically diverse group of phototrophic prokaryotes transformed Earth's atmosphere to one suitable for aerobic metabolism and complex life. The long debated Endosymbiotic Theory attributes to cyanobacteria also a significant role in the evolution of life, as important players in plastid origin of higher plants and other photosynthetic eukaryotes. Recent molecular surveys are trying to understand how, exactly, cyanobacteria contributed to plant genome evolution. Their ancient origin and their widespread distribution have recently opened the possibility of including fossil cyanobacterial DNA into the palaeo-reconstructions of various environments and in the calibration of historical records. Cyanobacteria occur in almost every habitat on Earth and can be found in environments subject to stressful conditions, such as desert soils, glaciers, and hot springs. They are common also in urban areas, where they are involved in biodeterioration phenomena. Their great adaptability and versatility are due to a characteristic cell structure, with typical inclusions and particular envelopes. They are the most complex prokaryotes, since they are able to form filaments, colonies, and mats, and they exhibit distinctive ways of movements. To live in different environments, facing biotic and abiotic stresses, cyanobacteria produce also a large array of metabolites, which have potential applications in several fields, such as nutrition, medicine, and agriculture. They have also an important ecological role, not only as primary producers, but also because of their coexistence (often, but not exclusively, in the form of symbiosis) with other organisms to which they supply nitrogen. On the other side, cyanobacteria can have also a negative impact both on the environment and society. In particular they can release a range of toxic compounds, cyanotoxins, diverse in structure and in their effects on human and animal health. In spite of their importance, cyanobacterial identification is not always easy and the use of modern methods (e.g., molecular sequencing, cytomorphology, and ecophysiology) has led to the revision of traditional taxa and to the discovery of new ones. Currently, the most accepted method for cyanobacterial classification is a polyphasic approach, also including comparison with reference specimens. Moreover, several authors are making efforts to create a unique nomenclature system for cyanobacteria.									31	3	0	0	24	1	36			0960-3115	1572-9710		WOS:000352720400002

Herein, it is found that the increased crystallinity of cubic RuSe2 nanoparticles anchored over carbon nanotubes (RuSe2/CNTs) could largely increase the hydrogen generation performance both in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The freshly prepared RuSe2/CNTs with low crystallinity had a very low catalytic performance for the HER, while the catalytic ability could be largely boosted by facile thermal annealing at 650 degrees C in an N-2 atmosphere, resulting from the increased crystallinity and electronic effect. The crystal structure enhancement of the RuSe2 nanoparticles was well supported by the X-ray diffraction technique and the lattice fringes in the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images. As a result, the catalyst exhibited largely improved catalytic performance compared to the freshly prepared RuSe2/CNTs; specifically, the overpotentials of 48 and 64 mV were required to drive 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and acidic media when loaded on a glassy carbon electrode, much less than those of 109 and 120 mV for the freshly prepared RuSe2/CNTs; the catalytic performance in the alkaline electrolyte was even close to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Correspondingly, the improved catalytic stability, catalytic kinetics, charge transfer ability and catalytic efficiency of the active sites were also observed. The current work shows an effective approach and important understanding for catalytic performance enhancement via increased crystallinity by facile thermal annealing.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000733912900001	34951430

H2 produced by utilizing the ZnO-ZnS heterostructure still faces serious challenges because of its fast combination of photogenerated carriers and non-negligible photo-corrosion. In this study, we devise an original synthesis strategy for the Rh-ZnO/rGO/ZnS heterostructure via Rh-induced micro-cell growth and the dynamic ion-exchange process. Given the in-situ formation of the interfaces between the heterostructure and Rh atoms, the as-prepared heterostructure based on the solid-state Z scheme demonstrates rapid carrier migration, low overpotential, and reduced photo-excited charge carrier combination due to the synergetic effect, which presents excellent performance in solar-driven H-2 generation. The stable Schottky junctions between Rh and the ZnO-ZnS heterostructure further facilitate the catalytic performance. Therefore, this work provides a promising viewpoint on the Z-scheme heterostructure for photocatalytic water splitting.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, Ti3C2, one of the widely used two-dimensional materials, is used to produce a heterojunction of TiO(2)and Ti(3)C(2)by an in situ growth method and the photogenerated electrons transfer between the two components for photocatalytic water splitting to hydrogen is investigated. Theoretical simulation and experimental tests proclaim that electrons transfer from Ti(3)C(2)to TiO(2)forms an internal electric field, which implies that there exists the driving force of electronic movement from TiO(2)to Ti3C2. In situ irradiation X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows the binding energies of Ti-C (in Ti3C2) and Ti-O (in TiO2) move toward negative and positive positions, respectively, verifying the photogenerated electrons produced from TiO(2)and transferring to Ti(3)C(2)driven by the internal electric field. In addition, the amount of TiO(2)nanoparticles also affects the hydrogen evolution rate. Several parallel experiments are designed to uncover the fact that less or excess amount of TiO(2)nanoparticles leads to a tinier shift of binding energy, which hints the quantity of heterojunction is a considerable factor in photocatalytic performance. This work develops a new method to directly monitor the photoelectron transfer process between heterojuctions.									82	8	0	0	16	0	82			2366-9608			WOS:000540740200001

In particular, Fe MOFs are attracting much more interest among various MOFs materials owing to the abundant resource and low toxicity of iron elements. Herein, we present the up-to-date advances and challenges of Fe-MOFs based materials as electrocatalysts for water splitting. The several key factors about limiting the improvements of Fe-based MOF and Fe-MOFs derivatives for water splitting are discussed in details. Next, on account of intrinsically poor conductivity and stability inheriting from pristine Fe MOFs, some recent modulation strategies towards water splitting have been summarized accordingly to the following three categories: Fe-based MOF, FeMOFs derivatives and their hybrids. The dispersion of active sites, element doping, conductive substrate have usually been adopted. Finally, this review briefly puts forward the current opportunities and challenges of Fe-MOFs based materials, along with several targeted solutions towards highly efficient water splitting. The advances and summary of Fe-MOFs based materials also may provide the guidance and implication for other catalytic process, energy storage and conversion. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The fibre consists of SiC nanocrystals of 2-3 nm, free carbon aggregates of 4-5 distorted aromatic layers and 1-3 nm in length and an amorphous silicon (titanium) oxycarbide phase. Except for evolution of residual hydrogen and a slight densification, the fibre is chemically and structurally stable and retains a high strength up to 1300 degrees C. Beyond 1300 degrees C, superficial degradation resulting from decomposition of the oxycarbide into SiO((g)) and CO((g)) induces a decrease of strength. Compared with bulk polycrystalline SiC, the fibre has a low creep resistance at high temperature, mainly because of the nanometric size of the SiC crystals but also because of the presence at the grain boundary of the oxycarbide phase (viscous and chemically unstable) and of the poorly organized free carbon phase (chemically and structurally unstable).

The questions to be answered are-Why do they form at all? What processes are involved? Why do they so often form as regular spheroids? Why do they sometimes form laterally-extensive bands? What controls whether the mineral composition is calcite, dolomite, rhodochrosite or siderite (or mixtures of them)? The questions are addressed and the answers illustrated by selected examples.Carbonate precipitation is the result of the sedimentary system exploiting the potential energy provided by juxtaposing oxidised detrital input with reducing agents (organic matter). Microbes take advantage of the energy source and are believed to be involved in most of the various processes.Pore waters in steadily-accumulated sediments show a depth-related succession of chemical and carbon stable-isotope compositions. This results from degradation of organic matter proceeding via an orderly succession of processes during burial, each mediated by a specific microbial group. Aerobic oxidation, using dissolved oxygen occurs first, followed by Mn(IV), reduced to Mn(II), as the oxidant. Fe(III) reduction and sulphate reduction are probably more significant. Methanogenesis is the final, deepest microbial process. The common product of all these reactions is CO2 or dissolved HCO3- which can result in carbonate supersaturation. The specific process controls the chemical and isotopic compositions of pore-water and leads to a characteristic mineralogy of any carbonate precipitated. However, the processes may not proceed successively and localised micro-environments occur. Recent work on siderite concretions in very young salt-marsh sediments (Norfolk, U.K.) has shown that microbial populations are not homogeneously distributed and that these localise and control concretionary growth.Concretions in ancient rocks can be described in terms of the same processes observed in modern sediments. Laterally-extensive siderite bands in Bullhouse Quarry (Westphalian, U.K.) resulted from interaction of two sets of complementary processes: shallow manganese and iron reduction coupled with deeper methanogenesis and decarboxylation. The model is supported by a mass and charge balance calculation. Similar, complementary processes formed spheroidal concretions (Gammon Shale, USA) but there is evidence that the outer shell of the concretion formed before the inner core and in the absence of a core the shell was crushed by burial compaction. The spheroidal form resulted from diffusion of reactive components controlled by the relative rates of the contributory processes.Calcite or dolomite analogues of the siderite concretions are formed by similar processes but inhibition of carbonate precipitation makes it impossible to use an equilibrium mass balance model. Kimmeridge Bay (UK) dolomite ledges are marine analogues to the Bullhouse examples. For the pyrite-rimmed calcite Jet Rock concretions (Early Jurassic, Yorkshire, U.K.) the rate of production of sulphide (from sulphate reduction) locally exceeded availability of Fe(II), to precipitate pyrite. Outward diffusion of sulphide produced the characteristic spheroidal shape of the concretion.Because of their developmental pattern bedded concretions are more likely to preserve a sequence of diagenetic cements which record the history of pore-water evolution. However, all represent an expression in ancient rocks of microbiological processes similar to those operating today.					7TH MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION OF GEOSCIENCES : MARINE SEDIMENTS, BURIAL, PORE WATER CHEMISTRY, MICROBIOLOGY AND DIAGNOSIS7TH MEETING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION OF GEOSCIENCES : MARINE SEDIMENTS, BURIAL, PORE WATER CHEMISTRY, MICROBIOLOGY AND DIAGNOSIS	APR 04-08, 1993APR 04-08, 1993	EUROPEAN UNION GEOSCIEUROPEAN UNION GEOSCI	STRASBOURG, FRANCESTRASBOURG, FRANCE	134	0	0	0	41	0	135			0025-3227			WOS:A1993LT70800010

Herein, we developed a multicomponent integration of hierarchical Co9S8-Ni3S2 nanoparticles anchored on CuMn2O4-NiMn2O4 nanosheet arrays (Co-Ni-S NPs/Cu-Ni-Mn-O NSAs) and rhombus-like shaped MnFe2O4-ZnFe2O4 nanocrystals are grown on the graphene-ink nanosheets (Mn-Zn-Fe-O/G-ink), which were effectively applied as a superior binder-free cathode and anode electrodes for ASCs. The hierarchical Co-Ni-S NPs/Cu-Ni-Mn-O NSAs and Mn-Zn-Fe-O/G-ink electrode architectures show large surface area, high conductivity and provide rich active sites for redox reactions. As a result, the electrochemical properties of Co-Ni-S NPs/Cu-Ni-Mn-O NSAs and Mn-Zn-Fe-O/G-ink electrodes deliver that both have excellent specific capacities (263 and 149.44 mA h g(-1) at 2 A g(-1)), superior rate capabilities (86.54% and 92.64% even at 20 A g(-1)) and remarkable cycling stabilities (97.39% and 94.83% over 5000 cycles), respectively. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled using the Co-Ni-S NPs/Cu-Ni-Mn-O NSAs as positive electrode and Mn-Zn-Fe-O/G-ink as negative electrode with an aqueous KOH electrolyte. The energy and power densities of the ASC are calculated based on the weight of the electroactive materials. As a result, the ASC delivers ultrahigh energy and power densities of 75.65 Wh kg(-1) and 6629.53 W kg(-1) as well as achieve exceptional cycling stability of 96.89% retention with 98.26% of columbic efficiency over 5000 cycles. These attractive results of binder-free advanced current collectors with composites of various active materials and favorable architectures paves a path for the engineering of new class collectors for high-performance ASCs.									86	3	0	0	8	0	87			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000499066900111

More interestingly, the redox pair Fe2+/Fe3+ of the gel renders considerable pseudo-capacitance, delivering a high volumetric energy density (4.8 mWh cm(-3), based on the one-piece half-cell) and cycling stability. This simple one-piece approach is convenient and effective-by pairing the mineral gel-based half-cell with another matching electrode, a novel type of charge storage device is formed, with the gel serving as one electroactive material, the electrolyte, and the membrane separator. Furthermore, the mineral hydrogel reported here is of low cytotoxicity, self-bondable and healable, and highly resistant against swelling and disintegrating, with no collapse or volume expansion observed even after being soaked in water for 60 days. To our knowledge, this is the first time that mineral hydrogels have been synthesized from all-inorganic agents in a fully biocompatible setting, which also sheds light on the myth-ridden topic of pre-cell evolution in the prebiotic age.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000727440300001

Cell-free systems can be designed to operate as catalytic platforms with enzymes that offer exceptional selectivity and efficiency, without the need to support ancillary reactions of metabolic pathways operating in intact cells. Such systems are yet to be exploited for applications involving CO2 utilization and subsequent conversion to valuable products, including biofuels. The Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle and the enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/ oxygenase (RubisCO) play a pivotal role in global CO2 fixation.Results: We hereby demonstrate the co-assembly of two RubisCO-associated multienzyme cascades with selfassembled synthetic amphiphilic peptide nanostructures. The immobilized enzyme cascades sequentially convert either ribose-5-phosphate (R-5-P) or glucose, a simpler substrate, to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), the acceptor for incoming CO2 in the carboxylation reaction catalyzed by RubisCO. Protection from proteolytic degradation was observed in nanostructures associated with the small dimeric form of RubisCO and ancillary enzymes. Furthermore, nanostructures associated with a larger variant of RubisCO resulted in a significant enhancement of the enzyme's selectivity towards CO2, without adversely affecting the catalytic activity.Conclusions: The ability to assemble a cascade of enzymes for CO2 capture using self-assembling nanostructure scaffolds with functional enhancements show promise for potentially engineering entire pathways (with RubisCO or other (CO2-fixing enzymes) to redirect carbon from industrial effluents into useful bioproducts.									15	0	0	0	7	0	15			1754-6834			WOS:000404848600001	28694846

Four full-length GPx cDNAs were cloned and characterized by rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR) from the liver of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), an economically important species for Mediterranean aquaculture. Structural and functional annotations were performed for all paralogs, which suggested possible differences in function and subcellular localization. The phylogenetic analysis, based on the amino acid sequences, revealed four groups corresponding to teleostean GPx1a, GPx1b, GPx4a, and GPx4b and three groups for mammalian GPx1, GPx2 and GPx4. The tree topology indicated past duplication events for fish genes, unlike their mammalian homologs. Transcriptional analysis in ten tissues by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) evidenced a tissue-specific pattern for each GPx homolog. Fish experimental groups were exposed to stress factors such as fasting and confinement. Relative expression analysis in fish liver demonstrated that GPx1 genes were not regulated by dietary restriction; GPx4b was differentially expressed opposed to regularly fed fish. On the other hand, both GPx1 and GPx4 genes were up-regulated in fish post exposed to confinement, considered as a response to acute stress. The results underline the role of GPx genes as indicators of stress and welfare status in gilthead sea bream aquaculture. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A mathematic model is set up, based on published data, which is valid at pH values below 9, and in which the nonideality of the solution is taken into account. The crucial parameter is the constant expressing the equilibrium between carbon dioxide and bicarbonate, K1.The reactions were studied in three different aqueous solutions: water, mineral salt medium, and a suspension with nongrowing bacterial cells. For each situation, three methods were compared for the determination of the bicarbonate concentration in the solution: equilibrium state total carbon analysis, dynamic monitoring of the rate of acid or alkali addition, and dynamic measurement of the carbon dioxide gas phase mole fraction.In a batch-stirred tank reactor, the equilibrium constant K1 agreed with the published value, and the three bicarbonate analysis methods give the same results. If the nonideality is not taken into account, the result significantly differed from the published value and is likely to be incorrect.A real alkalophilic process, using Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in a continuous stirred tank reactor at steady state, also gave results that are in accord with the literature. However, the results do not allow validation of the equation expressing the nonideality.The steady state in the batch system and in continuous culture can be well described with the mathematical model. However, in the transient state there are some unexplained differences between simulation and measurement.									14	0	0	0	14	0	14			0006-3592			WOS:A1992HN03300001	18600908	
J	Bai, Xiaoyu; Li, Yi; Xie, Liangbo; Liu, Xiaohui; Zhan, Sihui; Hu, Wenping								A novel Fe-free photo-electro-Fenton-like system for enhanced ciprofloxacin degradation: bifunctional Z-scheme WO3/g-C3N4								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO				6	9			2850	2862		10.1039/c9en00528e				SEP 1 2019	2019	Antibiotics accumulate because of their extensive use and difficult degradation, which can lead to the formation of novel antibiotic resistant genes and bacteria, which can cause damage to human health and the ecological environment. Here, we designed a novel photo-electro-Fenton-like (PEF-like) system with bifunctional Z-scheme WO3/g-C3N4 for accelerated decomposition and enhanced mineralization of stubborn ciprofloxacin (CIP). This PEF-like system, accompanied by visible light activation, with the optimal WO3/g-C3N4 (1 : 6) composite exhibited outstanding removal efficiency of CIP compared with a single photocatalysis system and electro-Fenton-like (EF-like) system, and the elimination rate reached 100% within 2 h under visible light irradiation. The WO3/g-C3N4 (1 : 6) composite displayed the strongest visible light absorption, the weakest recombination of electron-hole pairs, the highest photocurrent response and the lowest electrochemical impedance compared with pristine WO3 and g-C3N4. Significantly, WO3/g-C3N4 (1 : 6) played a dual role in the PEF-like system which could not only produce OH, O-2(-) and h(+) during photocatalysis, but could also generate OH through the reactions of W5+ and photoexcited electrons of g-C3N4 for the decomposition of H2O2. It was worth noting that this bifunctional PEF-like catalyst with photoelectric synergy could replace Fe2+ in a conventional electro-Fenton reaction and the pH range was broadened while still maintaining efficient degradation efficiency in the range of 2-9. The PEF-like system maintained a high elimination rate of CIP after five consecutive runs which revealed that it possessed prominent stability and feasibility.									27	3	0	0	11	0	29			2051-8153	2051-8161		WOS:000486118600011

Metal sulfides are well known photocatalysts in water splitting process, but in absence of sacrificial electron donor they undergo a photocorrosion. In this paper we studied a possible strategy to protect the sulfide photocatalysts and to improve its photostability by a deposition of small amount of ruthenium oxide at surface of sulfides. Nanocrystalline zinc sulfide and copper sulfide were prepared in a hydrothermal way and have been functionalized by RuO2. As prepared photocatalysts showed good activity towards hydrogen formation. Modification of sulfides with ruthenium oxide had a few positive effects: it expanded a light absorption range by photocatalysts, enhanced the photocatalytic activity towards H-2 formation, improved a photostability in comparison with neat ZnS and CuS as well as protected from the electronic and structural changes within semiconductors due to irradiation.

Cobalt metal thin films are prepared through facile physical vapor deposition (PVD) on various nonconductive substrates, including regular and quartz glass, mica sheet, polyimide, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Subsequent surface electrochemical modification by cyclic voltammetry (CV) renders these films active for electrocatalytic water oxidation, reaching a current density of 10mAcm(-2) at a low overpotential of 330mV in 1.0m KOH solution. These electrodes are robust with unchanged activity throughout prolonged chronopotentiometry measurements. This work is thus significant to show that the combination of PVD and CV is very valuable and convenient to fabricate active electrodes on various nonconductive substrates, particularly with flexible polyimide and PET substrates. This efficient, safe and convenient method can potentially be expanded to many other electrochemical applications.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000417561000004	28940995

This method has been exploited to monitor the surface mass changes and hence to draw conclusions in respect of the formation and removal of adsorbed species and oxides as well as changes in the electrochemical double layer also in the case of platinum electrodes. However, the results that had been obtained so far are somewhat contradictory, and consequently diverse interpretations can be found in the literature. Therefore, it is worth to review the knowledge accumulated and to carry out systematic study in this respect. In this work smooth and platinized platinum electrodes in contact with acidic solutions were studied using EQCN technique. The effects of temperature, the nature of cations and anions, pH, concentrations, potential range were investigated on the electrochemical, and the simultaneously detected nanogravimetric responses. It is shown that in the underpotential deposition (upd) of hydrogen the adsorption/desorption of species from the solution phase is governed by the oxidative desorption/reductive adsorption of hydrogen; however, unambiguos conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the actual participation of anions and water molecules in the surface coverage. In the hydrogen evolution region a weak cation adsorption can be assumed and the potential of zero charge can be estimated. Cs+ cations affect the EQCN response in the hydrogen upd region. In some cases, e.g., in the case of upd of zinc the mass change can be explained by an induced anion adsorption. Two types of dissolution processes have been observed. A platinum loss was detected during the reduction of platinum oxide, the extent of which depends on the positive potential limit and the scan rate, and to a lesser extent on the temperature. The platinum dissolution during the electroreduction of oxide is related to the interfacial place exchange of the oxygen and platinum atoms in the oxide region. At elevated temperatures two competitive processes take place at high positive potentials: a dissolution of platinum and platinum oxide formation.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000290040500005

In the last three years, numerous advances were accomplished that improved the preparation of new MAX phases with prearranged double transition metals and, as a result, the production of novel MXenes with a high structural complexity and chemical multiplicity, infrequently observed in other families of two-dimensional samples. In this evaluation, hybrids of MXenes and semiconductors are efficient photocatalysts, because of their specific interface characteristics and Schottky heterojunction is capable of giving accelerated charge separation and a lower Schottky barrier for photocatalytic applications. The latest advances were proved that the MXenes supported semiconductors based photocatalysts can be expected as the most advantaged and encouraged novel photocatalysts in the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical applications. Besides, we have explained significant developments in efficient MXenes supported semiconductors based nanocomposites, including the frequent synthesis strategies and progress mechanisms, in addition to their new applications including, photodegradation of dyes, CO2 conversion, photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting reaction applications. The review was completed with a short presentation of future challenges and prospects in the progress of MXenes supported semiconductors based photocatalysts. It is also believed that this review will encourage further exploration and will inaugurate new promising to increase new MXenes supported semiconductors based photocatalysts with new and inspiring applications.

However, elevated temperature has a detrimental impact on overall plant growth and development. We have examined the physiological response of the dgd1-2 and dgd1-3 Arabidopsis mutants lacking 30-40% of digalactosyl-diacylglycerol (DGDG) exposed to heat constraint. These mutants, which grow similarly to wild type under normal conditions, were previously reported to be defective in basal thermotolerance as measured by cotyledon development. However their functional properties were not described. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements and absorbance changes at 820 nm were used to monitor photosystem II (PSII) and PSI activity, respectively. It was observed that both mutants have similar photosystem activities with some differences. The mutants were less able to use near saturation light energy and elicited higher rates of cyclic PSI electron flow compare to wild type. Arabidopsis leaves exposed to short-term (5 min) mild (40 degrees C) or strong (44 degrees C) heat treatment have shown a decline in the operating effective quantum yield of PSII and in the proportion of active PSI reaction centers. However, cyclic PSI electron flow was enhanced. The establishment of the energy-dependent non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence was accelerated but its decline under illumination was inhibited. Furthermore, heat stress affected the process implicated in the redistribution of light excitation energy between the photosystems known as the light state transitions. All the effects of heat stress mentioned above were more intense in the mutant leaves with dgd1-3 being even more susceptible. The decreased DGDG content of the thylakoid membranes together with other lipid changes are proposed to influence the thermo-sensitivity of the light reactions of photosynthesis towards heat stress.

Cyclic voltammetry performed on this electrode revealed that it presents a high quality (diamond-sp(3)/sp(2)-carbon ratio), high potential for OER and that An can be oxidized directly and/or indirectly by the electrogenerated oxidants, such as hydroxyl radicals, persulfate ions and sulfate radicals.Electrolysis experiments demonstrated that An degradation and mineralization follow a mixed (first and zero) order kinetics depending on the applied current density. At high applied current densities, the amount of center dot OH radicals is very high and the overall reaction is limited by the transport of An (pseudo first-order kinetics) whereas for low applied current densities, the rate of center dot OH radicals generation at the anode is slower than the rate of arrival of ATL molecules (pseudo-zero order kinetics). Estimated values of k(zero) and k(first) based on the assumption of pseudo-zero or pseudo-first order kinetics were carried oud as a function of the supporting electrolyte concentration, indicating that both parameters increased with its concentration due the higher production of sulfate reactive species that play an important role in degradation.Finally, MCE increased with the decrease of current density, due to the lower amount of center dot OH present in solution, since this species could be rapidly wasted in parasitic reactions; and the increase of sulfate concentration due to the more efficient production of persulfate.

A major fraction of nonrefractory submicron aerosol particles consisted of organics (accounting for, on average, 46% of total mass), sulfate (41%), and ammonium (12%). Positive matrix factorization of high-resolution organic aerosol mass spectra identified two oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA) components: a highly oxidized, low-volatility OOA and a less oxidized, semivolatile OOA (SV-OOA), interpreted mainly as aged regional organic aerosol (OA) and as locally formed biogenic secondary OA (BSOA), respectively. The mass concentrations of SV-OOA increased prominently during the daytime, suggesting a strong photochemical production of BSOA on both nonevent and new particle formation event days. Increases of f(44) (fraction of m/z 44 in OA mass spectrum), the fraction of CxOy+ fragment, and the O/C ratio after midday (around 13:00 local time) suggest that OA became increasingly oxygenated, which can be explained by the aging of freshly formed BSOA. Aqueous phase oxidation reactions under conditions of high relative humidity may have played a vital role in the aging of BSOA in this forest atmosphere. A substantial increase of the mass concentration of organics in the small size range (below 300nm in vacuum aerodynamic diameter), without an increase in that of sulfate, suggests that the formation of BSOA made a dominant contribution to the presence of particles of cloud condensation nuclei size around the studied area.									13	0	1	0	3	0	14			2169-897X	2169-8996		WOS:000330930600021		
J	Li, Yunfeng; Zhou, Minghua; Cheng, Bei; Shao, Yan								Recent advances in g-C3N4-based heterojunction photocatalysts								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				56		SI		1	17		10.1016/j.jmst.2020.04.028				NOV 1 2020	2020	Semiconductor heterojunction photocatalysts have received much concern due to their great application prospect in solar energy utilization and conversion. Rational construction of heterostructure with two or more semiconductor materials can integrate the advantages of multi-components to simultaneously improve the photo-induced charges separation, extend visible light absorption range and retain the high redox ability of photocatalysts. Recently, constructing of g-C3N4-based heterostructure has become a hot focus due to the multiple merits of g-C3N4, such as facile synthesis, high stability, unique optical and electronic characteristics. This review tries to give a comprehensive introduction and provide the possible tendency in design and fabrication of g-C3N4-based heterojunction photocatalysts, especially in rational synthesis of type-II heterojunction, direct Z-scheme heterojunction, new type of S-scheme heterojunction, p-n heterojunction and Schottky heterojunction. Furthermore, the special charges transfer mechanisms of g-C3N4-based heterojunctions are discussed and their potential applications in photocatalytic water splitting, photo-degradation of contaminants and photo-reduction of CO2 into fuels are also summarized. Finally, we attempt to propose some crucial issues based on the current research, which should be further investigated and resolved in this interesting research area.

A time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy technique, also referred to as pulsed induced fluorescence (PIF), has been combined with time-resolved microwave hairpin probe measurements of the electron density in a pulsed Cl(2)/H(2)-based discharge for this purpose. The surface loss rate of H, k(w)(H), was measured in H(2) plasma and was found to lie in the 125-500 s(-1) range (gamma(H) surface recombination coefficient of (0.006-0.023), depending on the reactor walls conditioning. The PIF technique was then evaluated for the derivation of k(w)(Cl), and gamma(Cl) in Cl(2)-based plasmas. In contrast to H(2) plasma, significant variations in the electron density may occur over the millisecond time scale corresponding to Cl(2) dissociation at the rising edge of the plasma pulse. By comparing the temporal evolution of the electron density and the Ar-line intensity curves with 10% of Ar added in the discharge, the authors show that a time-resolved actinometry procedure using Ar as an actinometer is valid at low to moderate ICP powers to estimate the Cl loss rate. They measured a Cl loss rate of similar to 125-200 s(-1) (0.03 <= gamma(Cl) <= 0.06) at 150 W ICP power for a reactor state close to etching conditions. The Cl surface loss rate was also estimated for high ICP power (800 W) following the same procedure, giving a value of similar to 130-150 s(-1) (gamma(Cl) similar to 0.04), which is close to that measured at 150 W ICP power.

Hierarchical Zn2In2S5/Ti3C2(O, OH),, hybrids have been rationally constructed using Ti3C2(O, OH) as a two-dimensional platform for in situ growth of flower-like Zn2In2S5 microsphere under anaerobically hydrothermal conditions. Upon exposure to visible light, the Zn2In2S5/Ti3C2(O, OH) hybrids with the Ti3C2(O, OH),, content of 1.5% (by mass) had hydrogen generation yields of 12,983.8 timol g(-1), which was significantly better than that of pure Zn2In2S5. The apparent quantum efficiency reached 8.96% at 420 nm. Furthermore, the photocatalytic tetracycline removal rate was-1.25 times higher than that of pure Zn2In2S5, and can be further improved with the increase of temperature in the range of 35-55 C. Excellent photocatalytic activity originated from the synergistic effects between visible-light-active Zn2In2S5 and conductive Ti3C2(O, OH) for spatial electrical promotion. The photogenerated-electrons transfer efficiency from Zn2In2S5 to Ti3C2(O, OH),, was 33.0%. In accordance with spectroscopic, electrochemical, and density functional theory studies, we proposed that the interfacial-built-in quasi alloying effect between ZIS and Ti3C2(O, OH) culminated in notable charge redistribution, which thereby facilitated the spatial separation and transfer of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. This work revealed the underlying photo-excited charge transfer between metallic compound and semiconductor.									156	7	0	0	30	0	157			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000467661700028

It has been possible to photochemically generate oxygen by using a scheme similar to the Z-scheme, by using suitable catalysts in place of water-oxidation catalyst in the Z-scheme in natural photosynthesis. The best oxidation catalysts are found to be Co and Mn oxides with the e(g)(1) configuration. The more important aspects investigated pertain to the visible-light-induced generation of hydrogen by using semiconductor heterostructures of the type ZnO/Pt/Cd1-xZnxS and dye-sensitized semiconductors. In the case of heterostructures, good yields of H-2 have been obtained. Modifications of the heterostructures, wherein Pt is replaced by NiO, and the oxide is substituted with different anions are discussed. MoS2 and MoSe2 in the 1T form yield high quantities of H-2 when sensitized by Eosin Y. Two-step thermochemical splitting of H2O using metal oxide redox pairs provides a strategy to produce H-2 and CO. Performance of the Ln(0.5)A(0.5)MnO(3) (Ln= rare earth ion, A= Ca, Sr) family of perovskites is found to be promising in this context. The best results to date are found with Y0.5Sr0.5MnO3.									19	0	0	0	1	1	19			1364-503X	1471-2962		WOS:000368067200011	26755752	
J	Lee, CE; Petersen, CH								Genotype-by-environment interaction for salinity tolerance in the freshwater-invading copepod Eurytemora affinis								PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY				75	4			335	344		10.1086/343138				JUL-AUG 2002	2002	This study examined the extent of phenotypic plasticity for salinity tolerance and genetic variation in plasticity in the invasive copepod Eurytemora affinis. Euryemora affinis is a species complex inhabiting brackish to hypersaline environments but has invaded freshwater lakes and reservoirs within the past century. Reaction norm experiments were performed on a relatively euryhaline population collected from a brackish lake with fluctuating salinity. Life history traits ( hatching rate, survival, and development time) were measured for 20 full-sib clutches that were split and reared at four salinities ( fresh, 5, 10, and 27 practical salinity units [PSU]). On average, higher salinities (10 and 27 PSU) were more favorable for larval growth, yielding greater survival and faster development rate. Clutches differed significantly in their response to salinity, with a significant genotype-by-environment interaction for development time. In addition, genetic ( clutch) effects were evident in response to low salinity, given that survival in fresh (lake) water was significantly positively correlated with survival at 5 PSU for individual clutches. Clutches raised in fresh water could not survive beyond metamorphosis, suggesting that acclimation to fresh water could not occur in a single generation. Results suggest the importance of natural selection during freshwater invasion events, given the inability of plasticity to generate a freshwater phenotype, and the presence of genetic variation for plasticity upon which natural selection could act.									57	2	0	0	57	0	61			1522-2152	1537-5293		WOS:000179223000002	12324889	
J	Han, Leiting; Zhang, Wei; Xu, Huacong; Wang, Jiahao; Zhong, Mingqiang; Zhao, Zhengping								Preparation and Catalytic Performance of Ni/NiO@C and SiO2@C Composites as using Bamboo as Carbon Source for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE				16	11					211134	10.20964/2021.11.41				NOV 2021	2021	With the depletion of traditional fossil energy and the deterioration of the earth's ecological environment, the development of clean and renewable new energy is worthy of attention. Compared with traditional fossil energy, hydrogen energy has the advantages of high combustion calorific value, abundant resources, wide sources, green environmental protection, clean and renewable, easy storage and so on. In the field of hydrogen production, electrolysis of water for hydrogen production has the advantages of simple operation equipment and preparation process, relatively high purity and yield of products, and non-toxic by-products. However, the disadvantage is that in the actual electrolysis process, there is a large overpotential on the electrode, which leads to excessive power consumption, high economic cost and seriously hinders its large-scale commercialization. Therefore, the development of cheap, efficient, stable and low overpotential electrocatalyst is of great significance to improve the economic benefits of electrolytic aquaculture. In this project, Ni/NiO@C and SiO2@C composite catalytic materials were synthesized by loading nickel oxide on bamboo carbon materials and silica on bamboo carbon materials as electrodes. The main raw material is bamboo carbon powder, which is expanded by chemical activation method. NiO and SiO2 with the same molar concentration are loaded on the expanded bamboo carbon by hydrothermal method to form Ni/NiO@C and SiO2@C composite catalytic materials. Scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry were used for analysis. The cyclic voltammetry curves show that the Ni/NiO@C and SiO2@C composites have symmetrical redox peaks, good cyclic stability and reversibility, and good electrochemical properties. The overpotential at 1mA was obtained from the linear sweep voltammetry curve. The mass ratio of SiO2 in SiO2@C composite was 5%, 15%, 30% and 50%, which were 0.563V, 0.577V, 0.584V and 0.586V respectively. The molar concentration of SiO2 in 1.5% Ni/NiO@C composite was 0.588V. The cyclic voltammetry curves of Ni/NiO@C and SiO2@C composites with the same molar concentration show that SiO2@C composites have more obvious symmetrical redox peaks. The linear sweep voltammetry analysis shows that the overpotential at 1mA of SiO2@C composites is smaller than that of Ni/NiO@C composites, and the Tafel slope is also smaller than that of Ni/NiO@C composites The reversibility and electrochemical performance of SiO2@C composite are better than that of Ni/NiO@C composite.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1452-3981			WOS:000718325900020

The optimized CoSe2/Co@NCNF-3 exhibited excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance with a Tafel slope of 76 mV/dec for ORR and a potential of 1.64 V vs. RHE at 10 mA/cm(2) for OER. Furthermore, it also showed superior long-term stability and antimethanol ability compared to those of commercial Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts. Application of CoSe2/Co@NCNF-3 in zinc-air battery was assembled with distinguished long-term cycling stability and high maximum power density (79 mW/cm(2)). Density functional theory calculation demonstrated that CoSe2/Co heterostructure boosted intermediate adsorption ability and also improved catalytic capacity for OER. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

As an anode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), it showed a steady reversible capacity of 710 mAh g(-1) at a high current density of 1 A g(-1) after 200 cycles with 80% retention. The remarkable electrochemical storage properties are attributed to the microcubic structure inherited from the precursor and structure stability, which can effectively buffer the volume expansion during the discharge-charge process. Its excellent features, such as low cost, environmentally friendliness, simple preparation and outstanding electrochemical properties, make the obtained FeMnO3 a promising electrode material for electrochemical storage devices.

J	Herzberg, Claude								Petrological Evidence from Komatiites for an Early Earth Carbon and Water Cycle								JOURNAL OF PETROLOGY				57	11-12			2271	2287		10.1093/petrology/egw055				NOV-DEC 2016	2016	Komatiites from Alexo and Pyke Hill in the Archean Abitibi greenstone belt provide petrological evidence for an early Earth carbon and water cycle, ingassing in the cool Hadean and outgassing in the hot Archean. The komatiites have SiO2 contents that are lower than those expected of advanced volatile-free melting of mantle peridotite. The SiO2 misfit cannot be plausibly accounted for by variations in model Bulk-Earth peridotite composition, perovskite fractionation in a magma ocean, addition of chondrites, a source that had recycled crust added to it, or by chemical alteration during serpentinization. One possible resolution to the silica misfit problem is obtained if the komatiites from Alexo and Pyke Hill were partial melts of carbonated peridotite, a conclusion based on reasonable agreement between the major element compositions of komatiites (i.e. SiO2, Al2O3, FeO, MgO, and CaO) and experimental melt compositions of carbonated peridotite. High-degree melts with olivine as the sole residual phase can have low SiO2 contents owing to carbonate addition. Furthermore, a role for significant H2O is indicated from recent olivine-hosted melt inclusion studies. More work is needed to constrain how much CO2 and H2O is required to resolve the SiO2 misfit, and the T-P conditions of melting. Failure to do so imposes significant uncertainty in Archean mantle potential temperature and geodynamic interpretations. These uncertainties notwithstanding, the komatiites appear to be recording important degassing events in the Archean. Depending on the extent of volatile degassing, hydrous and CO2-rich komatiites could have formed either in mantle plumes or in ambient mantle. Ingassing may have occurred in the Hadean when atmospheric CO2 and H2O were sequestered by reaction with impact ejecta, oceanic crust and mantle peridotite to produce carbonates and hydrous minerals. Parts of the Earth may have been sufficiently cool at some point in the Hadean to ingas the deep mantle, consistent with a variety of constraints from zircon and isotopic studies. Hydrous and CO2-rich komatiites formed from 'carbonated wetspots' in mantle plumes or ambient mantle later in the Archean. The drop in komatiite production at the end of the Archean may be a record of significant purging of the mantle in volatiles, affecting biogenic methane production and the evolution of oxygen in the atmosphere.									15	2	1	0	2	0	18			0022-3530	1460-2415		WOS:000396751600009

The photoanodes were fabricated either by a particle transfer method or an electrophoretic deposition method. The effects of the precursors, fabrication method, and CoOx catalyst loading were studied in order to identify the shortcomings of the photoanodes and improve their photoelectrochemical properties for water oxidation. SrNbO2N photoanodes fabricated by particle transfer generated a photocurrent that was one order of magnitude higher than that of photoanodes prepared via electrophoretic deposition. The stoichiometric oxide precursor (Sr2Nb2O7) was found to be preferable to the Sr-rich oxide precursor (Sr5Nb4O15). CoOx increased the photoanodic current on SrNbO2N photoelectrodes. Nevertheless, the incident photon-to-current efficiency was still limited to 10% at most. Potential problems with SrNbO2N photoanodes were discussed.									41	1	0	0	1	0	41			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000350894400014	25406767

A pre-photosynthesized leaf having been transferred into CO2-free air exhibited a typical CO2 PIE following darkening which could last, with a rate substantially higher than that of dark respiration, over a long time period (at least more than 2 h) of continuously alternate irradiation (2 min)-dark (2 min)-light transitions. The rate and the time of PIE maintenance, although unaffected by the exogenous dark respiration inhibitor iodoacetic acid, were stimulated largely by increasing irradiance and O-2 level, and suppressed by DCMU and N-ethyl-maleimide (NEM). They also showed a large photosynthates-loading dependence. In a darkened leaf, the irradiation-induced PIE in the CO2-free air was clearly revealed and it was characterized by an initial net uptake of respiratory CO2. The light-induced PIE was accelerated by increasing irradiance, and delayed by prolonging the period of darkening the leaves. Hence, the origin of carbon needed for a long-term CO2 evolution in the CO2-free air might not only be derived directly from the pool of intermediates in the Calvin cycle, but it might also arise indirectly from a remotely fixed reserve of photosynthates in the leaf via a PCO-mediated, yet to be further clarified, mobilization process. Such mobilization of photosynthates probably exerted an important role in coordination of photochemical reactions and carbon assimilation during photosynthesis in C-3 plants under the photoinhibitory conditions.									2	0	0	0	3	0	3			0300-3604			WOS:000072469200014

However, systematic investigations are required to fulfill this task. In this work, for the first time, a kind of defect with low electron density is quantitatively demonstrated to be correlative with photocatalysis efficiency by using perovskite oxide Na0.5Bi2.5Ta2O9 nanosheets as the model material, in which the defect was systematically introduced and engineered. More importantly, the correlation is found to be not only valid for photocatalysis in Na0.5Bi2.5Ta2O9, but also is pervasive in various materials and different photochemical processes, though it has been overlooked in previous reports. The defect with low electron density acts as the recombination center for photogenerated carriers, therefore it is detrimental to the photo(electro)chemical performance, and the elimination of this kind of defect will be critical for improving photochemical efficiency.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000564451700013

It consists of stromatic migmatites of Paleoproterozoic heritage intensely metamorphosed during the Grenville event (c. 1 Ga; U-Pb and U-Th-Pb ages on zircon and monazite). In the migmatites, aluminous mesosomes (FMAS) and quartzofeldspathic leucosomes (KFMASH), contain various amounts of K-feldspar (Kfs), orthopyroxene (X-Mg Opx = 0.86), plagioclase (Pl), sillimanite (Sil; exceptionally kyanite, Ky) ilmenite (Ilm), magnetite (Mag), quartz (Qtz), and minor amounts of garnet (X-Mg Grt = 0.60), sapphirine (X-Mg Spr = 0.87), cordierite (X-Mg Crd = 0.92) and biotite (X (Mg) Bt = 0.83). The ubiquitous peak mineral assemblage is Opx-Sil-Kfs-Qtz-(+/- Grt) in most of the MCB, which, together with the high Al content of orthopyroxene (10% Al2O3) and the local coexistence of sapphirine-quartz, attest to regional UHT metamorphism (> 900 degreesC) at pressures in excess of 1.0 GPa. Fluid-absent melting of biotite is responsible for the massive production of orthopyroxene that proceeded until exhaustion of biotite (and most of the garnet) in the southern part of the MCB (Mollendo-Cocachacra areas). In this area, a first stage of decompression from 1.1-1.2 to 0.8-0.9 GPa at temperatures in excess of 950 degreesC, is marked by the breakdown of Sil-Opx to Spr-Opx-Crd assemblages according to several bivariant FMAS reactions. High-T decompression is also shown by Mg-rich garnet being replaced by Crd-Spr- and Crd-Opx-bearing symplectites, and reacting with quartz to produce low-Al-Opx-Sil symplectites in quartz-rich migmatites. Neither osumilite nor spinel-quartz assemblages being formed, isobaric cooling at about 0.9 GPa probably followed the initial decompression and proceeded with massive precipitation of melts towards the (Os) invariant point, as demonstrated by Bt-Qtz-(+/- pl) symplectites in quartz-rich migmatites (melt + Opx + Sil = Bt + Grt + Kfs + Qtz). Finally, Opx rims around secondary biotite attest to late fluid-absent melting, compatible with a second stage of decompression below 900 degreesC. The two stages of decompression are interpreted as due to rapid tectonic denudation whereas the regional extent of UHT metamorphism in the area, probably results from large-scale penetration of hot asthenospheric mantle at the base of an over-thickened crust.									51	3	0	0	0	0	52			0263-4929	1525-1314		WOS:000179791300008

Nevertheless, this topic has been tackled so far only by using a very fundamental approach and mostly by trying to improve kinetics and selectivities toward specific products in half-cell configurations and liquid-based electrolytes. The main drawback of this approach is that, due to the low solubility of CO2 in water, the maximum CO2 reduction current which could be drawn falls in the range of 0.01-0.02 A cm(-2). This is at least an order of magnitude lower current density than the requirement to make CO2-electrolysis a technically and economically feasible option for transformation of CO2 into chemical feedstock or fuel thereby closing the CO2 cycle. This work attempts to give a short overview on the status of electrochemical CO2 reduction with respect to challenges at the electrolysis cell as well as at the catalyst level. We will critically discuss possible pathways to increase both operating current density and conversion efficiency in order to close the gap with established energy conversion technologies.									109	1	1	0	3	0	109			0009-4293			WOS:000367281100010	26842328

Previous studies show that the PB-derived nanomaterials can inherit part of their features, exhibiting large surface area, inter-connected pores and hierarchical pore sizes, which may promote charge transfer when utilized in energy storage and conversion system. By tuning synthesis conditions (e.g. temperature and atmosphere), nano-materials with desirable structures and properties can be obtained, leading to various usage areas for energy storage and conversion applications (e.g. batteries, supercapacitors and catalysts). In this work, for the first time, various products obtained under different preparation conditions and their applications are summarized in detail in order to offer guiding significance for synthesizing nanoporous materials with special purposes.

Herein, a novel isotype heterojunction consisted of MCN and UCN, respectively derived from hydrothermally-treated melamine and urea, was synthesized. Owing to the well compatibility and matched band structure, an S-scheme charge transfer mechanism is confirmed for working on MCN/UCN isotype heterojunction, thus endowing strong redox ability, efficient charge carrier separation efficiency and prolonged lifetime. As a result, MCN/UCN exhibits improved photocatalytic water splitting activity under visible light irradiation, which displays approximately 5.5 and 1.8-fold enhancement as compared to the pure MCN and UCN, respectively. The rationally synthesized S-scheme isotype heterojunction will pave the way for developing highly efficient g-C3N4-based photocatalysts.									113	15	0	0	12	0	117			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000486177700109

The effect of the synthetic conditions on compositions, morphologies and electrochemical performances was discussed, and the possible synthetic mechanism was proposed. The obtained K-doped FeOOH/Fe3O4/SS demonstrated a superior specific capacity of 396 mA h g(-1) (0.554 mA h cm(-2)) at 1 A g(-1) in 2 M KOH, which is the largest value reported so far. And it was also much larger than those of K-doped and -undoped FeOOH/SS samples. Furthermore the sample manifested an increasing capacity during the cycling test, which was probably associated with the doping of K+ as well as the coexistence of Fe(ii) and Fe(iii) in the structure. Based on density functional theory (DFT), the effect of the K-doping on the electron conductivity of the sample was theoretically investigated. In addition, a Co-Mo-O/Ni3S2/Ni foam (NF)//K-doped FeOOH/Fe3O4/SS asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated, which can deliver a high energy density of 74.38 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 3.64 W kg(-1).									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000459626400024	30698581	
J	Maina, JN								Some recent advances on the study and understanding of the functional design of the avian lung: morphological and morphometric perspectives								BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS				77	1			97	152		10.1017/S1464793101005838				FEB 2002	2002	The small highly aerobic avian species have morphometrically superior lungs while the large flightless ones have less well-refined lungs. Two parabronchial systems, i.e. the paleopulmo and neopulmo, occur in the lungs of relatively advanced birds. Although their evolution and development are not clear, understanding their presence is physiologically important particularly since the air- and blood flow patterns in them are different. Geometrically, the bulk air flow in the parabronchial lumen, i.e. in the longitudinal direction, and the flow of deoxygenated blood from the periphery, i.e. in a centripetal direction, are perpendicularly arranged to produce a cross-current relationship. Functionally, the blood capillaries in the avian lung constitute a multicapillary serial arterialization system. The amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchanged arises from many modest transactions that occur where air- and blood capillaries interface along the parabronchial lengths, an additive process that greatly enhances the respiratory efficiency. In some species of birds, an epithelial tumescence occurs at the terminal part of the extrapulmonary primary bronchi (EPPB). The swelling narrows the EPPB, conceivably allowing the shunting of inspired air across the openings of the medioventral secondary bronchi, i.e. inspiratory aerodynamic valving. The defence stratagems in the avian lung differ from those of mammals: fewer surface (free) macrophages (SMs) occur, the epithelial cells that line the atria and infundibula are phagocytic, a large population of subepithelial macrophages is present and pulmonary intravascular macrophages exist. This complex defence inventory may explain the paucity of SMs in the avian lung.									54	0	1	0	43	5	56			1464-7931	1469-185X		WOS:000174187600006	11911376	
J	Qiao, Yanyu; Chen, Zhichao; Yu, Zheng; Shuo, Guan; Li, Jiawei; Yuan, Zhenhua; Zeng, Lingyan; Li, Zhengqi				Li, Jiawei/GXM-4151-2022				Study on the Physical, Chemical and Combustion Characteristics of Pyrolysis Semi-coke								COMBUSTION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY											10.1080/00102202.2021.1958323		JUL 2021			2021	Combustion is an effective method for large-scale utilization of pyrolytic semi-coke (SC), a high order carbon-based solid fuel with low volatile content. The combustion characteristics of SC can be deeply understood through the study of physical and chemical properties. Taking SC as the research object and anthracite (YQ) with similar chemical composition as the control, the activation energy (E) of SC and YQ was calculated respectively by using model-free method and model method (16 typical mechanism functions). The pre-exponential factor (A), the change of enthalpy (Delta H), the change of entropy (Delta S), and the change of Gibbs free energy (Delta G) during the reaction were calculated. As a result, the pore inside of the particle is the main part of the pore structure of SC. The total specific surface area, pore-volume, and fractal dimension of SC are all larger than that of YQ. There is a lot of amorphous carbon in both SC and YQ, and the lattice spacing and graphitization degree of SC is smaller than that of YQ, but the average aromatic carbon lateral size and crystallite volume are much larger than that of YQ. The carbon in SC and YQ mainly exists in the form of aromatic carbon and aliphatic carbon, and the relative content of aromatic carbon in SC and YQ is basically the same. For the model method, the E of SC and YQ calculated by the three-dimensional diffusion (Spherical symmetric) mechanism function is the closest to the E obtained by the model-free method. Different from YQ, the main combustion stage of SC is composed of fixed carbon combustion and CaCO3 decomposition, and basically, no NH3 and HCN are generated. The volatile content of SC, the total specific surface area, and the pore volume in the pore are larger than that of YQ, which results in that the ignition temperature of SC is lower than that of YQ. The E and burn-out temperature of SC are higher than that of YQ due to the lower oxygen-containing functional group content, higher aromatic carbon content, fractal dimension and larger crystallite volume. Comprehensive physical, chemical, and combustion characteristics results show that using SC by combustion is more difficult than YQ.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000677918800001

After sintering, the conditioned Ti powder was converted into Ti composites. TiC was derived from the pyrolysis of PCS and forming an in-situ reinforcement. There exists a specific orientation relationship of (111)(TiC )parallel to(10 (1) over bar0)(Ti); and [11 (2) over bar](TiC)parallel to[1 (2) over bar 10](Ti). The average grain size of alpha-Ti decreases significantly from 100.5 mu m in pure Ti to 16.1 mu m in the Ti-3 wt.% PCS composite. When the PCS content is 4 wt%, Ti3Si particles precipitate out, and they are combined with TiC forming an aggregated network architecture. Among these Ti composites, the 3 wt% PCS sample exhibits a high tensile strength of 861 MPa, high yield strength of 754 MPa and reasonably large elongation of 10.8%, respectively.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			0921-5093	1873-4936		WOS:000576173400001

In this Letter, we report that a NiFe-borate layer can be generated on a NiFe-layered double hydroxide nanosheet array hydrothermally grown on carbon cloth via an in situ electrochemical surface derivation process in potassium borate (K-B-i)solution. The resulting 3D NiFe-LDH@NiFe-B-i nanoarray (NiFe-LDH@NiFe-B-i/CC) demonstrates high activity for water oxidation, demanding overpotentials of 444 and 363 mV to achieve 10 niA cm(-2) in 0.1 and 0.5 M K-B-i (pH: 9.2), respectively, rivaling the performances of most reported non-noble-metal catalysts in near-neutral media. Notably, this electrode also shows strong electrochemical durability with a high turnover frequency of 0.54 mol O-2 s(-1) at overpotential of 600 mV. All these features promise its use as an efficient earth-abundant catalyst material for water oxidation under eco-friendly conditions.									43	5	0	0	0	0	44			1944-8244			WOS:000403631300016	28422477

Moreover, hierarchical and porous assembly of dissimilar constituent elements at various length scales and dimensionality is highly appropriate for mass transfer and surface/interfacial-dominated reactions. Here, we demonstrate solution processed 2D-on-2D hierarchical architecture of nanobelt core-nanosheets shell consisting of dissimilar transition metal composite. The defining benefits of such hetero-structured material design are short ion diffusion pathway of a thin 2D nanobelt core that is interfaced to large surface area and porous 2D nanosheets. Accordingly, an integrated energy system that delivers multiple functionalities, i.e. supercapacitive charge storage and electrochromic optical modulation, is investigated due to its attractive complementary energy storage and energy conservation capabilities. Consequently, bifunctional electrochromism-supercapacitive properties are demonstrated where desirable optical transmittance modulation and coloration efficiency properties in parallel with favorable pseudocapacitive storage and specific capacitance properties are simultaneously realized. Such an integrated energy system is anticipated to have a broad range of smart applications in buildings, automobiles and other emerging electronics needs.									83	0	0	0	2	0	83			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000400983400018

The heterojunction photocatalytic material exhibited enhanced photodegradation behavior of methylene blue (MB) and photoelectrochemical water splitting performance under simulated solar light. The degradation rate of MB and photocurrent density of heterojunction is 3.99 and 8.33 times higher than that of pure Ta2O5 NTs respectively. The synergetic effect of the phase heterojunction and highly ordered structure increased the specific surface area and improved the separation and transmission efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activities. Hence, Ta2O5 TNs-TiO2 nanodots heterojunction has promising application in the fields of photodegradation, photoelectrochemical water splitting, solar cells, and other photocatalytic devices.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000600046500001

In this work, based on the screening of materials by density functional theory calculations, the potentials of group IV and group VI isoelectronic co-doped black phosphorenes (BPs) as candidate photocatalysts were comprehensively evaluated. According to the essential criteria of stability, electronic structure features, as well as visible light photocatalytic hydrogen production performance, we identified Si-S, Si-Se, Ge-S and Ge-Se co-doped BPs as promising catalysts. We highlighted that the isoelectronic co-doping process is geometrically and thermodynamically favorable. Interestingly, the isoelectronic co-dopants did not affect the direct and clean band gap nature of pure BP, and they also enhanced the photocatalytic hydrogen production properties, retaining a strong anisotropic feature. We believe that our findings will shed light on the modulation and development of BP based metal-free two-dimensional photocatalysts.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2052-1553			WOS:000491293500016

The experimentally determined pH dependence, together with the EQCM measurements, have confirmed that charging and discharging of SG Ni-Co oxide films is accompanied by the injection/expulsion of mobile ions, suggested to be OH- and Na+. Although an unambiguous identification of the species involved in the mass transport within the oxide films cannot be made by CV and EQCM alone, these studies provide a deeper insight into morphological changes of the SG oxide films which occur with time of cycling in alkaline solutions. A model involving water exchange during the redox process of these films is proposed, with water being expelled during oxidation and injected upon reduction. An increased amount of exchanged water with longer cycling times may indicate the early stages of the degradation of SC-formed 50:50 Ni-Co oxide films. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Herein, we reported a novel Tremella-like Bi2WO6 catalyst which was obtained by facile hydrothermal technique. The formation of Tremella-like Bi2WO6 strongly depended on introduction of Bi2O3. Based on the Kirkendall effect, Bi2O3 induced Bi(NO3)3.5H2O to form biscuit-like Bi6O6(OH)3(NO3)3.3H2O particles which provided templates and reacted simultaneously with WO42- to synthesize Tremella-like Bi2WO6. The Tremellalike Bi2WO6 exhibited remarkable visible-light catalytic performance. The degradation rate of RhB dye reached 100% with 10 min, the reduction rate of CO2 was 5.5 times higher than pure Bi2WO6. Moreover, the Tremellalike Bi2WO6 catalyst displayed excellent stability during the recycle experiments. The high catalytic activity makes single phase Bi2WO6 catalyst great potential in environmental protection field.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000743563300001

In this process, super glue is polymerized in aqueous NaCl solution, followed by carbonization at 1000 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies show that the resultant material consists of micron-sized carbon nanosheets with a wrinkled morphology. HRTEM, X-ray diffraction (XRD), XPS and Raman spectroscopic studies confirm the formation of nanocrystalline and graphitic, nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets. A detailed FTIR analysis of the degradation products of the polymeric precursor (polyethyl cyanoacrylate) at various heat treatment temperatures under an inert atmosphere reveals that the polymer undergoes a cyclization process similar to polyacrylonitrile (PAN) during carbonization to yield the N-CNS. The N-CNS used as an anode for a lithium-ion battery shows stable reversible capacities of 480 mA h g(-1) for 100 cycles, which indicates that N-CNS are promising materials for lithium-ion battery applications. In a broader perspective, a unique chemical transformation of polyethyl cyanoacrylate to graphitic carbon may be useful to design new nanostructured carbons for a plethora of applications.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000444400200022	30019042

Herein, we report a hybrid ZAB with a long lifespan and high working voltage; it uses a neutral anolyte, an acidic catholyte, and a proton-shuttle-shielding dual-hydrophobic membrane to isolate the two electrolytes. The hybrid ZAB operates through the stable electrochemical plating and stripping of zinc (Zn) in a neutral anolyte and a high-voltage O-2 redox reaction in acidic catholyte. The designed proton-shuttle-shielding dual-hydrophobic membrane selectively transports hydrophobic bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide anions (TFSI ) and effectively avoids the crossover of protons. As a result, the hybrid ZAB exhibits a high working voltage (1.50 V) and stable operation (up to 2,000.0 h) in ambient air. This strategy not only overcomes the severe irreversibility of conventional ZABs but also promotes development of electrolyte-decoupled systems.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2542-4351			WOS:000854940700005

A majority of pristine metal oxide nanomaterials have certain shortcomings in catalysis and sensing, such as poor conductivity and wide bandgap. Fortunately, the regulation of the intrinsic physicochemical properties of metal oxide nanomaterials is a very promising approach for improving their catalytic and sensing properties for energy conversion and environmental detection. In this review, we will mainly discuss the regulation of the intrinsic physicochemical properties, namely, shape and size, defects, crystal facets, and ion cycles of metal oxide nanomaterials, with a majority of applications involving photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction, electrocatalytic water splitting, heavy metal ion (HMI) detection, and metal oxide gas sensors. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) spectroscopy analysis have been used to evaluate the effects of regulation of the intrinsic physicochemical properties of metal oxide nanomaterials, as well as to further identify the relationship between the intrinsic physicochemical properties and their enhanced catalytic and sensing properties with regard to energy conversion and environmental detection. Finally, some unresolved problems associated with future perspectives in this field are discussed, inspiring further development of the intrinsic physicochemical properties of metal oxide nanomaterials.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000566092600049

A better understanding of performance and durability of PEMWE is critical for the engineers and researchers to further advance this technology for its market penetration, and for the manufacturers of PEM water electrolyzers to implement quality control procedures for the production line or on-site process monitoring/diagnosis. This paper reviews the published works on performance degradations and mitigation strategies for PEMWE. Sources of degradation for individual components are introduced. With degradation causes discussed and degradation mechanisms examined, the review emphasizes on feasible strategies to mitigate the components degradation. To avoid lengthy real lifetime degradation tests and their high costs, the importance of accelerated stress tests and protocols is highlighted for various components. In the end, R&D directions are proposed to move the PEMWE technology forward to become a key element in future energy scenarios. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Opening 2D materials is an effective way to alter the physical and chemical properties, such as band gap, conductivity, optical property, thermoelectric property, photovoltaic property and superconductivity. A larger interlayer distance means more accessible active sites for catalysis, an ion-accessible surface in the interlayer space, which may greatly enhance the performance of 2D materials for energy conversion and storage. Moreover, opening 2D materials by intercalation can change the band filling state and the Fermi level. This review mainly focuses on the opening of 2D materials and their subsequent applications in energy conversion and storage fields, expecting to promote the development of such a new class of materials, namely expanded 2D materials. The exciting progresses of these expanded materials made in both energy conversion and storage devices including solar cells, thermoelectric devices, electrocatalyst, supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries, is presented and discussed in depth. Furthermore, prospects and further developments in these exciting fields of the expanded 2D materials are also commented.									224	22	0	0	10	0	228			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000414918700002

Despite much research in this field, there are still several fundamental issues about the electrocatalysts that need to be resolved. Two such problems are that the catalyst mass loading on the electrode is subject to large uncertainties and the wetted surface area of the catalyst is often unknown and difficult to determine. To address these topics, a cobalt monolayer was prepared on a gold electrode by underpotential deposition and used to probe its efficiency for the oxidation of water. This electrocatalyst was characterized by atomic force microscopy, grazing-incidence Xray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy at various potentials to determine if changes occur on the surface during catalysis. An enhancement of current was observed upon addition of PO43- ions, suggesting an effect from surface-bound ligands on the efficiency of water oxidation. At 500 mV overpotential, current densities of 0.20, 0.74, and 2.4 mA/cm(2) for gold, cobalt, and cobalt in PO43- were observed. This approach thus provided electrocatalysts whose surface areas and activity can be accurately determined.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0743-7463			WOS:000327360500047	24138003

The PCST was characterized by FT-IR, TGA and NMR (H-1, C-13 and Si-29). The results showed that the PCST could be described as a part dispersion of Ti(OC4H9)(4) groups in the PCS chain matrix. The TiO2/SiO2 composite fibers were manufactured by melt-spinning PCST, maturing and curing the resulting fibers in air, followed by a final pyrolysis at 1200 degrees C in air. Based on the XRD, EPMA, EDS, SEM and HRTEM measurements, the TiO2/SiO2 fibers were made up of anatase-TiO2 nanocrystallites with a mean size of similar to 10 nm and in the amorphous silica phase.									30	1	0	0	1	0	31			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:000268439300022		
J	PRESTON, C; SEIBERT, M					Preston, Christopher/0000-0002-7588-124X			PROTEASE TREATMENTS OF PHOTOSYSTEM-II MEMBRANE-FRAGMENTS REVEAL THAT THERE ARE 4 SEPARATE HIGH-AFFINITY MN-BINDING SITES								BIOCHEMISTRY				30	40			9625	9633		10.1021/bi00104a009				OCT 8 1991	1991	The "high-affinity Mn-binding site" in Mn-depleted photosystem II (PS II) membrane fragments isolated from Scenedesmus obliquus was examined by using the diphenylcarbazide (DPC)/Mn2+ non-competitive inhibition assay [Preston, C., & Seibert, M. (1991) Biochemistry (preceding paper in this issue)]. Different proteases were used to degrade lumenal surface protein segments from these PS II membranes, and a total of four independent high-affinity Mn-binding sites (ligands) were identified. Carboxypeptidase A, subtilisin, and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease each degrade one of two high-affinity Mn-binding sites sensitive to the histidine chemical modifier diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC). However, sequential treatment experiments indicate that subtilisin degrades a DEPC-sensitive Mn-binding site that is different from the one degraded by the other two proteases. Trypsin also was found to degrade one of the DEPC-sensitive Mn-binding sites (that degraded by carboxypeptidase A and V8 protease). In addition, trypsin degrades one of two 1-ethyl-3-[(3-dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide (EDC) sensitive Mn-binding sites, but only in the absence of the 30-kDa extrinsic protein. Thus, the 30-kDa extrinsic protein associated with O2 evolution appears to protect the EDC-sensitive binding site from trypsin degradation. No protease has yet been identified that will degrade the trypsin-insensitive EDC-sensitive Mn-binding site. Under the conditions of the assay (high DPC concentration), more than three Mn per reaction center were found bound to the membrane with a K(M) of about 0.4-mu-M, as determined by direct metal analysis. This is consistent with the idea that each of the four high-affinity sites binds (or provides a ligand for) one of four Mn. These four high-affinity Mn-binding sites may correspond to the four sites formed, albeit sequentially, in the normal photoactivation process. We provide evidence that a histidine residue (His 337) on D1 is a prime candidate for one of the high-affinity Mn-binding sites and suggest that it also provides a nitrogen ligand for binding functional Mn. Finally, an alternative explanation of our data might be that the four high-affinity sites represent four ligands binding a single Mn, and ligands to other membrane bound Mn are not detectable by the DPC/Mn2+ assay.									41	1	0	0	34	0	41			0006-2960			WOS:A1991GJ47300009	1911748

The conversion of CO2 into value-added solar fuels by photocatalysts has been suggested as an intriguing solution to simultaneously mitigate global warming and provide a source of energy in an environmentally friendly manner. There has been considerable effort for nearly four decades investigating the performance of CO2 conversion by photocatalysts, much of which has focused on structure or materials modification. In particular, the application of low-dimensional structures for photocatalysts is a promising pathway. Depending on the materials and fabrication methods, low-dimensional nanomaterials can be formed in zero dimensional structures such as quantum dots, one-dimensional structures such as nanowires, nanotubes, nanobelts, and nanorods, and two-dimensional structures such as nanosheets and thin films. These nanostructures increase the effective surface area and possess unique electrical and optical properties, including the quantum confinement effect in semiconductors or the localized surface plasmon resonance effect in noble metals at the nanoscale. These unique properties can play a vital role in enhancing the performance of photocatalytic CO2 conversion into solar fuels by engineering the nanostructures. In this review, we provide an overview of photocatalytic CO2 conversion and especially focus on nanostructured photocatalysts. The fundamental mechanism of photocatalytic CO2 conversion is discussed and recent progresses of low-dimensional photocatalysts for efficient conversion of CO2 into solar fuels are presented.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2073-4344		WOS:000642880100001

Among the noble-metal clusters examined, Pt clusters showed the highest activity for the formation of methane as well as hydrogen. In order to improve the activity, oxidized clusters and bimetallic clusters were also applied. For example, the CH4 yield in 3-h irradiation increased from 51 x 10(-3) mu mol with unoxidized Pt clusters to 72 x 10(-3) mu mol with partially oxidized ones. In the case of Pt/Ru bimetalic systems, the improvement of the catalytic activity by air treatment was much greater than in case of monometallic clusters.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			0932-0784	1865-7109		WOS:A1995QR89500021

An in-depth understanding of microbial metabolism is of great importance in engineering microbes to further improve their respiration. We employed flux balance analysis and selected Fe(iii) as a substitute for the electrode to simulate current-generating metabolism of Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA with a fixed acetate uptake rate. Simulation results indicated the fluxes of reactions directing acetate towards dissimilation to generate electrons increased under the suboptimal growth condition, resulting in an increase in the respiration rate and a decrease in the growth rate. The results revealed the competitive relationship between oxidative respiration and cell growth during the metabolism of microbe current generation. The results helped us quantitatively understand why microbes growing slowly have the potential to make good use of fuel in MFCs. At the same time, slow growth does not necessarily result in speedy respiration. Alternative respirations may exist under the same growth state due to redundant pathways in the metabolic network. The big difference between the maximum and minimum respiration mainly results from the total formate secretion. With iterative flux variability analysis, a relatively ideal model of variant of G. sulfurreducens PCA was reconstructed by deleting several enzymes in the wild model, which could reach simultaneous suboptimal growth and maximum respiration. Under this ideal condition, flux towards extracellular electron transfer rather than for biosynthesis is beneficial for the conversion of organic matter to electricity without large accumulations of biomass and electricigens may maximize utilization of limited fuel. Our simulations will provide an insight into the enhanced current-generating mechanism and identify theoretical range of respiration rates for guiding strain improvement in MFCs.									11	0	0	0	7	0	11			1932-6203			WOS:000324408400040	24058500

These models describe the decision process as a gradual accumulation of sensory evidence over time. The temporal evolution of economic choices, however, remains largely unexplored. We tested whether sequential sampling models help to understand the formation of value-based decisions in terms of behavior and brain responses. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity while human participants performed a buying task in which they freely decided upon how and when to choose. Behavior was accurately predicted by a time-variant sequential sampling model that uses a decreasing rather than fixed decision threshold to estimate the time point of the decision. Presupplementary motor area, caudate nucleus, and anterior insula activation was associated with the accumulation of evidence over time. Furthermore, at the beginning of the decision process the fMRI signal in these regions accounted for trial-by-trial deviations from behavioral model predictions: relatively high activation preceded relatively early responses. The updating of value information was correlated with signals in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, left and right orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral striatum but also in the primary motor cortex well before the response itself. Our results support a view of value-based decisions as emerging from sequential sampling of evidence and suggest a close link between the accumulation process and activity in the motor system when people are free to respond at any time.									99	1	0	0	67	0	100			0270-6474			WOS:000307125900025	22855817

They represent an important archive into the chemistry of the Precambrian oceans and atmosphere, and the evolution of the marine biosphere. It is believed that BIFs were derived from ferric oxides/hydroxides that were deposited by iron-oxidizing bacteria or by reaction with oxygen released by Cyanobacteria. Hematite is traditionally interpreted to represent the dehydrated product of the ferric oxide/hydroxide precipitate, whereas magnetite is thought to have formed from ferric oxides/hydroxides via bacterial iron reduction and oxidation of microbial biomass. However, studies are equivocal about when and how magnetite formed in BIFs. We present the results of a detailed petrographic study of magnetite in BIFs of the Hamersley Group, Western Australia. We find no evidence that magnetite was precipitated from seawater or was a product of bacterial iron reduction. Instead, most of the magnetite formed by replacement of siderite and other ferrous-rich minerals after burial. Our observations suggest that magnetite growth was linked to the breakdown of siderite during metamorphism. Published experimental data indicate that in the presence of water and under the metamorphic conditions experienced in the southern Pilbara Craton (200-350 degrees C), the thermal decomposition of siderite could account for much of the magnetite in the Hamersley BIFs (3FeCO(3) + H2O -> Fe3O4 + 3CO(2) + H-2).The relationship between magnetite and the primary precipitates, which are preserved as greenalite nano-particles and microgranules in chert bands, suggests that much of the magnetite formed in siderite-rich, iron silicate bands that developed by compaction of non-silicified iron-silicate muds. These bands acted as reactive pathways for fluid flow and the formation of magnetite. If most of the magnetite formed after burial then it is necessary to reassess assumptions about the chemistry of the original precipitates and the role of microbial life in the redox cycling of iron. Our results are consistent with models for the deposition of BIFs that center around a precursor sediment comprising greenalite precipitates and diagenetic siderite that was partially replaced by magnetite and hematite after burial.									26	3	0	0	3	0	28			0301-9268	1872-7433		WOS:000425204600005

This paper researched the pyrolysis and reoxidation characteristics of lignite using thermogravimetric and infrared analysis. The macroscopic mass characteristics and microstructure composition characteristics of coal pyrolysis residues were analyzed. The critical temperature for lignite pyrolysis and pyrolysis residues reburning. The results show that a significant turning point before 450 degrees C such as the variation of pyrolysis residual weight, the variation of constant temperature residual weight, and the pyrolysis residual combustible component weight. The aliphatic hydrocarbons are gradually reduced due to the side chain cracking in the coal, and the aromatic hydrocarbons increase with the degree of aromatization of the coal structure in lignite pyrolysis. The pyrolysis residue at similar to 400 degrees C is the easiest to reburning, and the pyrolysis residue at similar to 450 degrees C had the strongest reburning intensity.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000489332600088

By analogy with natural systems it is clear that scaffolds with multi-scale structural architectures are necessary. In this perspective, recent progress related to the use of hollow micro/nanomaterials as nanoreactors for photocatalysis is discussed. Organised, multi-scale assemblies of photocatalytic units on hollow scaffolds is an emerging area that shows much promise for the synthesis of high performance photocatalysts. Not only do improved transport and diffusion characteristics play an import role, but increased electron/hole separation lifetimes as well as improved light harvesting characteristics by the hollow structures also do so and are touched upon in this short perspective.

Use of sensitive laser diagnostics in conjunction with carefully selected test mixtures enabled the suppression of sensitivity of CO and C2H4 time-histories to secondary reactions, resulting in a significant reduction of uncertainty in the measured rate constants. Additionally, CH3CHO time-histories measured during the pyrolysis of 2% C2H5OH/Argon mixtures were used to determine the rate constant of the most dominant H-abstraction channel, C2H5OH + H = sC(2)H(4)OH + H-2 between 1290 and 1530 K. The low temperature CH3CHO time-histories were also used to infer the rate constant of sC(2)H(4)OH = CH3CHO+H. The measured rate constants were used to generate an updated kinetic model, whose performance was evaluated against the species time-history data reported in recent shock tube pyrolysis studies. The performance of the updated model was also evaluated against ignition delay times (IDTs) of stochiometric C2H5OH/Oxygen/Nitrogen mixtures, measured between 100 0 and 1500 K near 20 atm in this study. The updated kinetic model was found to show excellent agreement with both shock tube pyrolysis and IDT studies. Additionally, the reduction in the uncertainty of the rate constants studied in this work resulted in a significant reduction in the uncertainty of the model predictions. The rate constant expressions listed below were derived from the measurements in this work, and are valid in the temperature range of 1200-1600 K.kC(2)H(5)OH(+Ar) <-> CH3 + CH2OH(+Ar),1 atm = 2.125 x10(13) e(-34070/T) s(-1) ( +/- 21%)kC(2)H(5)OH(+Ar) <-> CH3 + CH2OH(+Ar),10 atm = 3.079 x10(14) T(0.23)e(-38030/T) s(-1) ( +/- 28%)kC(2)H(5)OH(+Ar) <-> C2H4 + H2O(+Ar),10 atm = 6.062 x10(36) T-6.45 e(-42180/T) s(-1) (+/- 31%)ksC(2)H(4)OH <-> CH3CHO + H, 1 atm = 5.817 x10(9) e(-11372/T) s(-1) (+/- 55%)kC(2)H(5)OH + H <-> sC(2)H(4)OH + H-2 = 1.780 x10(7) T-1.94 e(-1835/T) s(-1) (+/- 28%) (C) 2021 The Combustion Institute.

J	Owen, J.; Bustin, R. M.; Bustin, A. M. M.								Insights from mixing calculations and geochemical modeling of Montney Formation post hydraulic fracturing flowback water chemistry								JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING				195						107589	10.1016/j.petrol.2020.107589				DEC 2020	2020	The major ion chemistry of the flowback water from 24 wells completed in the Montney Formation in northeastern British Columbia and northwestern Alberta provides insights into the mixing of formation water and fracturing fluid as well as fluid-fluid and fluid-rock interactions during well completions. We use chloride concentrations and oxygen and hydrogen isotopes as conservative tracers to calculate the proportion of formation water throughout the flowback period. During the flowback period prior to the wells being put on production, between 5% and 33% of the equivalent volume of injected fluid is recovered. Based on conserved element mixing calculations only a fraction of the flowed back volume is the injected completion fluid, the remainder being formation water. The proportion of formation water in the flowback fluid at the commencement of the flowback period for most of the study wells ranges between 10 and 35% and increases to approximately 40-60% at the end of the flowback period. Such results indicate that, although the majority of the fracturing fluid is retained in the reservoir, due to imbibition, at the same time, significant connate formation water is produced from the same reservoir. These results provide unique insights into the complex reservoir dynamics of multistage hydraulically fractured wells.The extent to which simple mixing between connate formation water and fracturing fluid accounts for the concentrations of major ions (Na, Ca, K, Mg, Sr and SO4), in the flowback fluids can be assessed by comparing the ion concentrations to the mixing lines derived from the conservative tracers in each well. In wells where the measured ion concentrations are not in agreement with concentrations predicted from simple mixing calculations, different geochemical processes were sequentially evaluated in an attempt to match and interpret the measured major ion concentrations. Na and K concentrations in the flowback water is primarily due to simply mixing, whereas Ca, Mg, and Sr are impacted by ion exchange in addition to mixing. Calcite dissolution or precipitation has a minor effect on Ca concentrations. Sulfate concentrations are less explicable and are likely related to pyrite oxidation and sulfate reduction due to the introduction of oxygenated fluids during drilling and completion.Overall all mixing of connate formation water and fracturing fluid is the dominant determinant of flowback water chemistry but fluid-fluid and fluid-rock geochemical reactions occurring in the subsurface are also variably important.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			0920-4105	1873-4715		WOS:000586002900047

In this study, the electrocatalytic water oxidation performance of a new cobalt-based catalyst, Co-3(BO3)(2), with a Kotoite-type crystal structure is investigated under neutral conditions. The catalyst is also hybridized with CNTs to enhance its electrocatalytic properties. A remarkable increase in catalytic current along with a significant shift in the onset overpotential is observed in Co-3(BO3)(2)@CNT. Additionally, CNT addition also greatly influences the surface concentration of the catalyst: 12.7 nmolcm(-2) for Co-3(BO3)(2)@CNT compared with 3.9 nmolcm(-2) for Co-3(BO3)(2). Co-3(BO3)(2)@CNT demands overpotentials of 303 and 487 mV to attain current densities of 1 and 10 mAcm(-2), respectively, at pH7. Electrochemical and characterization studies performed over varying pH conditions reveal that the catalyst retains its stability over a pH range of 3-14. Multi-reference quantum chemical calculations are performed to study the nature of the active cobalt sites and the effect of boron atoms on the activity of the cobalt ions.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000439755500017	29775244

However, the poor rechargeability and low efficiency hinder their practical applications. To solve these issues, free-standing carbon films combined with high-activity NiFe2O4 catalysts are prepared by electrospinning method, and directly used as air cathodes for Li-O-2 batteries. The obtained films have 3D networks formed by stacking and interlacing massive nanofibers with uniformly dispersed NiFe2O4 nanoparticles on them. The Li-O-2 batteries with such binder-free air cathodes show low charging overpotential even comparable to precious metal cathodes, and can sustain excellent discharge/charge cyclic stability. The unique structure and binder-free superiority greatly facilitates the Li+ and O-2 diffusion, accelerates the decomposition of Li2O2, and avoid the disturbance of polymer binders.									52	3	0	0	4	0	52			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000424070900018

The strategy is based on noncovalent - interactions between multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and the cationic acetylammonium pyrene moiety (Pyr(+)) covalently attached to a NHC IrCp*Cl-2 catalytically active center (NHC=N-heterocyclic carbene, Cp*=C5Me5). The dispersive properties of the Pyr(+) moiety in compound3 leads to the formation of stable MWCNT dispersions in aqueous solutions. In addition, the MWCNT/3 assembly shows activity in the Ce4+-driven oxidation of H2O. FTO/MWCNT/3 anodes show increased current densities when used as a working electrode for the electrocatalytic oxidation of H2O. At higher anodic polarizations initially high current densities were achieved; however, these currents prove to be non-sustained due to delamination and degradation of the catalytically active surface. The immobilization strategy is limited to applications below 1.4V vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) as oxidation of the pyrene backbone is evident at higher potentials.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2192-6506			WOS:000386078200012	31964082

Water splitting performance of metal and non-metal-doped transition metal oxide electrocatalysts								COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS				474						214864	10.1016/j.ccr.2022.214864				JAN 1 2023	2023	Transition metal oxide electrocatalysts have received significant research interest toward the advance-ment of environmentally acceptable electrochemical applications and systems, which are considered to be promising technologies due to their unique physicochemical properties like low cost, robust dura-bility, structural flexibility, and tunable activity. However, transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts suffer from poor electrocatalytic activity as well as a limited number of active sites, which result in the obstruction of their applications over the world. To overcome these challenges, heteroatom-doping into transition metal oxide electrocatalysts has been a crucial and rapid way to improve the conductivity of the catalytic centers and optimize the adsorption of the reactants and intermediates during the catalytic process, and hence, their electrocatalytic activity, which has become widespread in nanomaterials, is offering the possibility to select the catalytic properties with attractive traits for a specific application to some extent. We have critically and systematically discussed the recent progress on doping strategy involves non-noble metallic elements, such as Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, Ru, Mo, W, Cu, etc., and non-metallic ele-ments, such as S, N, P, B, Se, F, C, etc., in transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts for water splitting performance to gain a better understanding of the relationship between effect of heteroatoms doping engineering techniques and TMOs catalytic properties. Most importantly, doping, elemental incorpora-tion and alloying perform a significant role with heteroatoms for improving the catalytic activity on; modifying the electronic configuration of the catalysts, increasing the number of active sites, enhancing the electrical conductivity, and inducing synergistic effect of the transition metal oxide-based electrocat-alysts during overall water splitting process. We here also have briefly described the techniques used for preparing metal and non-metal-doped transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting process. In nutshell, this review is expected to provide a deeper insight on the effect of the metal and non-metal-doping in transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts for the rational design of high-performance catalysts in the future. We also have provided the current challenges and future perspectives of heteroatom-doped transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts for the development of high-performance water splitting processes.

Nevertheless, few studies have been reported in pecan. In this study, a total of 170 CiAP2/ERF members were identified and divided into 4 main subfamilies, AP2 (16 genes), RAV (6 genes), Soloist (1 gene), as well as ERF (147 genes) families, and ERF subfamily was further classified into group I to VI-L. Gene structures and conserved motifs indicated that individual groups were highly conservative. A large number of cis-elements such as Box 4, ABRE, and MYB were detected in the promoter region of CiAP2/ERF genes. Transcriptional levels in four tissues were analyzed using available transcriptome data. qRT-PCR analysis of the ERF VII group revealed that the subfamily had a positive response to waterlogging stress. The subcellular localization experiments on CiAP2/ERF21, CiAP2/ERF65, and CiAP2/ERF106 manifested that they were localized in nuclear. Additionally, CiAP2/ERF65 and CiAP2/ERF106 had the ability of self-activation in yeast, while the CiAP2/ERF21 gene did not. These results would conduce to understanding the AP2/ERF superfamily and functional roles of CiAP2/ERF TFs under different stresses.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0304-4238	1879-1018		WOS:000814369600002

However, poor crystallinity caused by structural interaction with a substrate negates the potential of ultrathin hematite photoanodes. This study demonstrates that ultrathin Ga2O3 underlayers, which were deposited on conducting substrates prior to hematite layers by atomic layer deposition, served as an isomorphic (corundum-type) structural template for ultrathin hematite and improved the photocurrent onset of PEC water splitting by 0.2 V. The benefit from Ga2O3 underlayers was most pronounced when the thickness of the underlayer was approximately 2 nm. Thinner underlayers did not work effectively as a template presumably because of insufficient crystallinity of the underlayer, while thicker ones diminished the PEC performance of hematite because the underlayer prevented electron injection from hematite to a conductive substrate due to the large conduction band offset. The enhancement of PEC performance by a Ga2O3 underlayer was more significant for thinner hematite layers owing to greater margins for improving the crystallinity of ultrathin hematite. It was confirmed that a Ga2O3 underlayer was applicable to a rough conducting substrate loaded with Sb-doped SnO2 nanoparticles, improving the photocurrent by a factor of 1.4. Accordingly, a Ga2O3 underlayer could push forward the development of host-guest-type nanocomposites consisting of highly-rough substrates and extremely-thin hematite absorbers.									88	5	0	0	2	0	89			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000299793100015	22470976

PLANTA				234	2			305	320		10.1007/s00425-011-1400-5				AUG 2011	2011	One of the most common types of modification of secondary metabolites is the acylation of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing substrates to produce esters and amides, respectively. Among the known acyltransferases, the members of the plant BAHD family are capable of acylating a wide variety of substrates. Two full-length acyltransferase cDNAs (LaAT1 and 2) were isolated from lavender flowers (Lavandula angustifolia L.) by reverse transcriptase-PCR using degenerate primers based on BAHD sequences. Recombinant LaAT1 exhibited a broad substrate tolerance accepting (hydroxy)cinnamoyl-CoAs as acyl donors and not only tyramine, tryptamine, phenylethylamine and anthranilic acid but also shikimic acid and 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid as acceptors. Thus, LaLT1 forms esters and amides like its phylogenetic neighbors. In planta LaAT1 might be involved in the biosynthesis of rosmarinic acid, the ester of caffeic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid, a major constituent of lavender flowers. LaAT2 is one of three members of clade VI with unknown function.									30	2	0	0	28	0	32			0032-0935			WOS:000293188600008	21424826

JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL DES SCIENCES DE LA VIGNE ET DU VIN				41	1			51	61						JAN-MAR 2007	2007	Aims: Microorganisms play an important role in winemaking. Most of their metabolisms are beneficial to the wine quality but several species have spoilage effects. Microbiological knowledge are crucial for improving species and strains identification and avoiding contamination by spoilage agents. Our objective was to follow wine microbial consortia at each stage of the process from grapes to bottles, and also on cellar equipment surface: barrels for the yeast analysis and tanks for the bacteria analysis.Methods and results: For a global microbial monitoring, molecular tools are particularly efficient. We chose the PCR-DGGE for direct analyses without cultivation step. We used the rpoB gene as target for the bacteria, and the 26S rRNA gene for the yeast. Species inventories were made during the whole winemaking process, which had never been done before.Conclusion: From the grape surface to storage in bottles, the microbial diversity decreased. Only the most resistant species were able to survive to the ethanol, SO2, low oxygen and low pH constraints. Among them, Pediococcus parvulus for the bacteria and Brettanomyces briLvellensis for the yeast were the most resistant.Significance and impact of study: The use of a molecular method independent of the culture stage of the microorganisms like the PCRDGGE has allowed to have a more exhaustive vision of the diversity of the bacteria and yeasts species and to follow their evolution during the winemaking and in the cellar environment. These follow-ups could be extended to other estates in order to study the causes and the consequences of certain variations. The detection of these two prejudicial species was an argument for the PCR-DGGE approach in wine microbial studies.									21	0	0	0	20	0	21			1151-0285			WOS:000245384400006

Although the area resistance of the ternary anode materials increased, the Ti content in the ruthenium and iridium based catalysts have led to an energy consumption of 4.5 kWh/Nm(3)(H-2) at 60 degrees C. The Membrane Electrode Assemblies have given information on the strong dependence of the membrane thickness. The crossover of hydrogen through Nafion (R) 117 is two-fold lower than that measured in the presence of Nafion (R) 115. Life testing was attempted with supplying the electrolyzer by solar power source. Importantly, the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) cell has involved a constant cell voltage at 1 A cm(-2) over 800 h durability tests.

J	Bai, GP; Keene, JB								Petrology and diagenesis of Narrabeen group sandstones, Sydney basin, New South Wales								AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES				43	5			525	538		10.1080/08120099608728274				OCT 1996	1996	The petrology of fluvial sandstones from the Narrabeen Group was investigated to document sandstone composition and to assess factors controlling sandstone diagenesis. The sandstones are dominated by detrital quartz and lithic grains. The average composition varies in ascending stratigraphic order from R (rock fragments) > Q (quartz) to Q > R. Major diagenetic events in order of occurrence were: (i) formation of hematite, chlorite and mixed-layer illite/smectite, and first generation of kaolin (I); (ii) precipitation of calcite, siderite and ankerite; (iii) dissolution of labile detrital grains and carbonate cement, and formation of second generation of kaolin (II); (iv) quartz overgrowth and precipitation of illite; and (v) precipitation of calcite and ankerite. These events were controlled both by detrital mineralogy and pore-water chemistry. Kaolin (I) and chlorite are mutually exclusive. At shallow burial depth different pore-water chemistry prevailed in different parts of the basin through meteoric water recharge from the southwest and bacterial activity in mudrocks. In the southwest part of the basin repeated meteoric water recharge and aerobic bacterial activity created oxygenated and mildly acidic pore waters and led to the formation of kaolin (I). Along the present coastal area and in the far northeast part of the basin a lack of meteoric water recharge combined with continued bacterial activity removed all oxygen and raised the pH value, producing anoxic and neutral to mildly alkaline pore waters and led to the formation of chlorite in litharenites with abundant volcanic rock fragments. All authigenic carbonate was formed by direct precipitation from pore water. The carbonate type was determined by relative cation concentration and Eh condition in the pore water. The amount of Ca-bearing carbonate is related to the detrital mineralogy of the sandstone, with high abundance of volcanic rock fragments favouring formation of large amounts of Ca-bearing carbonates. Later dissolution of authigenic carbonate and labile detrital grains was largely caused by the migration of escaping compactional water containing CO2 which was probably sourced from the maturation of organic matter in mudrocks. Kaolin (II) was formed by precipitation from pore waters and replacement of volcanic lithic, feldspar and mica grains as a result of reaction of these grains with migrating pore waters. Authigenic quartz overgrowth developed by overlap and/or emergence of initial micro-quartz crystal outgrowths. Precipitation of illite resulted from the build-up of K+ in the pore waters.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0812-0099			WOS:A1996VQ70800004		
J	Wang Haiyan; Shi Gaoquan								Layered Double Hydroxide/Graphene Composites and Their Applications for Energy Storage and Conversion								ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA				34	1			22	35		10.3866/PKU.WHXB201706302				2018	2018	Functional materials and devices that can efficiently store and convert energies have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. The composites of layered double hydroxide and graphene (LDH/G) are important energy materials. They have excellent physical and chemical properties of both components. Furthermore, their performances in energy-related systems can be improved by increasing the electrical conductivity of LDHs by blending graphene and partly preventing the aggregation of graphene sheets using LDH nanostructures. Therefore, LDH/G composites can be used in various energy applications, particularly for developing high-performance supercapacitors and efficient electrocatalysts for electrochemical splitting of water. In this review, we summarize the recent advances on the synthesis of LDH/chemically modified graphene (CMG, e.g., graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide and their derivatives) composites and their application in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Furthermore, the challenges and future perspectives in this research field are also outlined.									22	12	0	0	1	0	24			1000-6818			WOS:000423691400007

In both surface and subsurface sections, the original sediments were extensively dolomitized and most primary and secondary porosity was filled with anhydrite. These evaporites were emplaced by reflux of evaporitic fluids from shelf settings through solution-enlarged fractures and karstic sink holes into the underlying strata. Outcrop areas today, however, contain no preserved evaporites in reef and fore-reef sections and only partial remnants of evaporites are retained in back-reef settings. In their place, these rocks contain minor silica, very large volumes of coarse sparry calcite and some secondary porosity. The replacement minerals locally form pseudomorphs of their evaporite precursors and, less commonly, contain solid anhydrite inclusions.Some silicification, dissolution of anhydrite and conversion of anhydrite to gypsum have occurred in these strata where they are still buried at depths in excess of 1 km; however, no calcite replacements were noted from any subsurface core samples. Subsurface alteration has also led to the widespread, late-stage development of large- and small-scale dissolution breccias.The restriction of calcite cements to very near-surface sections, petrographic evidence that the calcites post-date hydrocarbon emplacement, and the highly variable but generally 'light' carbon and oxygen isotopic signatures of the spars all indicate that calcite precipitation is a very late diagenetic (telogenetic) phenomenon. Evaporite dissolution and calcitization reactions have only taken place where Permian strata were flushed with meteoric fluids as a consequence of Tertiary uplift, tilting and breaching of regional hydrological seals. A typical sequence of alteration involves initial corrosion of anhydrite, one or more stages of hydration/dehydration during conversion to gypsum, dissolution of gypsum and precipitation of sparry calcite. Such evaporite dissolution and replacement processes are probably continuing today in near-outcrop as well as deeper settings.This study emphasizes the potential importance of telogenetic processes in evaporite diagenesis and in the precipitation of carbonate cements. The extensive mineralogical and petrophysical transformations which these strata have undergone during their uplift indicates that considerable caution must be exercised in using surface exposures to interpret subsurface reservoir parameters in evaporitic carbonate rocks.									38	0	0	0	7	0	38			0037-0746			WOS:A1992HX29300003

The obtained catalysts were subjected to selective catalytic reduction of NO x with NH 3 (NH 3 -SCR) performance evaluation, structural/chemical characterizations such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), N 2 adsorption/desorption, H 2 temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR), NH 3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH 3 -TPD) as well as detailed in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments including CO adsorption, NH 3 adsorption and NO + O 2 in situ reactions. Results show that Cu-USY with proper Cu loading (in this work 5Cu-USY with 5 wt.% Cu) could be promising candidates with highly efficient NH 3 -SCR catalytic performance, relatively low byproduct formation and excellent hydrothermal stability, although its SO 2 poisoning tolerability needs alleviation. Further characterizations reveal that such catalytic advantages can be attributed to both active cu species and surface acid centers evolution modulated by Cu loading. On one hand, Cu species in the super cages of zeolites increases with higher Cu content and being more conducive for NH 3 -SCR reactivity. On the other hand, higher Cu loading leads to depletion of Bronsted acid centers and simultaneous formation of abundant Lewis acid centers, which facilitates NH 4 NO 3 reduction via NH 3 adsorbed on Lewis acid centers, thus improving SCR reactivity. However, Cu over-introduction leads to formation of surface highly dispersed CuO x , causing unfavorable NH 3 oxidation and inferior N 2 selectivity.

AMERICAN MINERALOGIST				107	5			970	984		10.2138/am-2022-7981				MAY 25 2022	2022	Banded iron formations (BIFs) are iron-rich marine chemical sedimentary rocks, and their mineralogy and geochemistry can be used to gain insights into ancient ocean chemistry and biospheric evolution. Magnetite is the major iron-bearing mineral in many BIFs (particularly in the Archean) and is variably interpreted to be of primary, early diagenetic, or metamorphic origin. Different genetic interpretations for magnetite lead to divergent pictures of the Precambrian Earth system and its evolutionary models through time. The Baizhiyan Formation of the Neoarchean Wutai Group (Shanxi, North China) features magnetite-bearing, Algoma-type BIFs deposited ca. 2.52 Ga, in the lead-up to a major period of global iron formation deposition in the Paleoproterozoic. Abundant magnetite crystals found in the silica-rich bands of these BIFs show euhedral, hexagonal morphology. We suggest that this hexagonal magnetite likely represents pseudomorphs after green rust, a mixed-valence iron hydroxy-salt formed in the water column. The rare earth element composition of the BIFs shows negligible to slightly positive Ce anomalies (Ce-SN/Ce-SN* = 1.03 +/- 0.07), which is characteristic of a dominantly anoxic water column. The presence of positive Eu anomalies (Eu-SN/Eu-SN* <3.9) suggests a substantial influence from proximal hydrothermal fluids. The co-occurrence of siderite layers associated with the magnetite-bearing strata may indicate iron cycling associated with ferruginous bottom seawater conditions. Geochemical signatures of the Baizhiyan BIFs are consistent with the interpretation that the magnetite was transformed from metastable green rust. This green rust could have formed via several processes, including the partial oxidation of Fe(II) by molecular oxygen/photoferrotrophs, the reaction of settling ferrihydrite with Fe(II)-rich hydrothermal fluids under anoxic conditions, or local dissimilatory iron reduction. In all cases, the contribution of primary green rust to BIF formation requires iron redox cycling, and similar pseudomorphs in the form of hexagonal magnetite may be more common in the geological record. Our findings support the models in which green rust was an important primary constituent of the Precambrian iron cycle, and the potential interactions of green rust with other elements (e.g., phosphorus) should be taken into consideration when reconstructing Precambrian biogeochemical cycles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-004X	1945-3027		WOS:000790666400018

In 1979, a cored borehole (SE-1) was drilled to 181 m depth and in 2017 three cored boreholes (SE-2a, SE-2b and SE-3) were drilled to successively greater depths. The basaltic deposits host a low-temperature (40-141 degrees C) seawater-dominated geothermal system. Surtsey provides an ideal environment to study water-rock interaction processes in a young seawater geothermal system. Elemental concentrations (SiO2, B, Na, Ca, Mg, F, dissolved inorganic carbon, SO4, Cl) and isotope contents (delta D, delta O-18) in borehole fluids indicate that associated geothermal waters in submarine deposits originated from seawater modified by reactions with the surrounding basalt. These processes produce authigenic minerals in the basaltic lapilli tuff and a corresponding depletion of certain elements in the residual waters. Coupling of measured and modelled concentrations investigates the effect of temperature and associated abundance of authigenic minerals on chemical fluxes from and to the igneous oceanic crust during low-temperature alteration. The annual chemical fluxes calculated at 50-150 degrees C range from - 0.01 to +0.1 x 10(12) mol yr(-1) for SiO2, + 0.2 to + 129 x 10(12) mol yr(-1) for Ca, -129 to -0.8 x 10(12) mol yr(-1) for Mg and - 21 to +0.4 x 10(12) mol yr(-1) for SO4 where negative values indicate chemical fluxes from the ocean into the oceanic crust and positive values indicate fluxes from the oceanic crust to the oceans. These flux calculations reveal that water-rock interaction at varying water-rock ratios and temperatures produces authigenic minerals that serve as important sinks of seawater-derived SiO2, Mg and SO4. In contrast, water-rock interaction accompanied by dissolution of basaltic glass and primary crystal fragments provides a significant source of Ca. Such low-temperature alteration could effectively influence the elemental budget of the oceanic igneous crust and ocean waters. The modeling provides insights into water chemistries and chemical fluxes in low-temperature MOR recharge zones. Surtsey also provides a valuable young analogue for assessing the chemical evolution of fluid discharge over the life cycles of seamounts in ridge flank systems.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			0009-2541	1872-6836		WOS:000562697100003

The mutations induce different herbicide resistances: in M(30), a point mutation at the codon 248, isoleucine to threonine, results in resistance only to metribuzin; in M(35), a single mutation, Ala(251)Val, confers metribuzin, atrazine, and ioxynil resistance. As with other herbicide-resistant mutants, M(30) and M(35) present modifications in the electron transfer between the primary quinone electron acceptor (Q(A)) and Q(B) In addition, they have a modified oscillatory pattern of oxygen emission: after dark adaptation, the maximum oscillation is shifted by one flash. Both mutants have a higher concentration of the redox state in the dark adapted state than the wild type. The mutations render the oxygen evolving system more accessible to cell reductants. The mutation Ala(251)Val also confers to PSII an increased sensitivity to high light. We have already demonstrated that under light stress a double mutant, AzV (Ala(251)Val, Phe(211)Ser), lost the ability to recover the PSII activity sooner than the wild type. Here, we confirm that the modification of the alanine-251 is responsible for this specific sensitivity to high light. We conclude that specific mutations of the Q(B) pocket modify the behavior of the cells under light stress and have an effect on the structure of the D-1 protein in the other side of the membrane.									27	0	0	0	28	0	28			0032-0889			WOS:A1994MR62900027	8115546

The experimental results show that cobalt is successfully doped into the lattice of NiS2. Co-doping causes the hollow sphere sulphides to break down and favors the formation of NixCo1-xS2 nanostructures with high-density active edge sites. The Ni0.75Co0.25S2 sample exhibits a high specific capacitance of 2141.9 F g(-1) at a current density of 2 A g(-1) due to its fluffy characteristics and edge site-enriched nanostructure.

Inferences on the complex formation history of such deposits from ore textures can be ambiguous in the lack of chemical and isotopic evidence as exemplified by the Shuangqishan orogenic gold deposit in Southeast China. We, therefore, conducted LA-ICP-MS spot analysis coupled with LA-MC-ICP-MS sulfur and lead isotope analysis on texturally complex gold-bearing pyrite from the Shuangqishan deposit. Gold distribution in different syn-to late-ore pyrite generations indicate initial evenly deposition of nano-to micro-inclusions of Au-Ag-Pb-Bi tellurides within pyrite grains and subsequent Au remobilization following brittle deformation and fluid-mediated coupled dissolution-reprecipitation (CDR) reactions. Gold dissolved from the pyrite during the reworking event became re-concentrated and re-precipitated as visible gold either as inclusions in pyrite or larger free gold grains within microfractures of pyrite. The distribution of Bi-Te-Pb-Ag assemblage is comparable to that of Au, illustrating that these trace metals became redistributed in a similar fashion. Early, undeformed pyrite has the least radiogenic Pb isotopic compositions. Late, porous and inclusion-rich pyrite, brecciated pyrite, and recrystallized Te-Bi minerals have variable but in general more radiogenic Pb isotope ratios (higher Pb-206/Pb-204 and Pb-207/Pb-204 ratios), which are attributed to modification and precipitation from a more evolved crustal fluid during the re-precipitation of native gold. The Pb isotopic signature of the younger pyrite generations was likely inherited from Pb released during modification of earlier proto-pyrite and a second, crustal lead source that was involved in the hydrothermal system during later remobilization. The delta S-34 values for the early proto-pyrite and the reworked pyrite generations within the individual vein stage are broadly similar. The variations in sulfur isotope compositions reflect the change in physicochemical conditions (temperature and oxygen fugacity) during proto-ore formation. Our study highlights the importance of metal recycling from early proto-auriferous pyrite during later reworking and gold remobilization, which led to visible gold and high-grade ore shoot formation. The extensive variations of trace element concentrations and S-Pb isotope compositions of proto and reworked pyrites record the complicated Au mobilization and deposition processes and help to understand how gold ores evolved.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000766754100001

Inorganic matter (IM), algal and non-photosynthetic detrital (NPD) dry biomasses were estimated for 10 monthly samples, between 2007 and 2008, from eight sites differing in deposit density. Invertebrate abundance, taxon richness and composition were also determined. Relations between these variables were investigated by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), generalized estimating equation models and path analysis. The first CCA axis correlates with deposit density and invertebrate abundance, with lumbriculids and chironomids increasing in abundance with deposit density and all other taxa declining. Community structure changes significantly above a deposit density of approximately 8 mg cm(-2), when algal biomass, invertebrate richness and diversity decline. Invertebrate richness and diversity were determined by direct effects of NPD biomass and indirect effects of IM. Algal biomass only had an effect on invertebrate abundance. Possible pH, oxygen, food and ecotoxicological effects of NPD biomass on the biota are discussed.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000361557700013

The leucine residue L159 was replaced by isoleucine, and the asparagine N230 was replaced by tyrosine (1,1591-N230Y). Phenotypic characterization of the mutant showed some interesting features compared to its wild type, namely: (1) a lower chlorophyll content; (2) a higher photosynthetic capacity and higher relative quantum yield of photosynthesis; (3) a higher respiration rate; (4) a very high conversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin during H(2) production; (5) a prolonged period of H(2) production. In standard conditions, the mutant produced more than 500 ml of H(2), that is, more than one order of magnitude greater than its wild type, and about 5-times greater than the CC124 strain that was used for comparison. The better performance of the mutant was mainly the result of a longer production period. Biogas produced contained up to 99.5% H(2). (c) 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

In order to explore the possible contribution of porous media two phase flow to these losses, we have used neutron-imaging techniques and took a closer look at water and gas distribution profiles at various current densities, ranging from kinetic to mass transport-governed regions at ambient and elevated pressures. Gas volume and velocity have been computed through quantified neutron images and the two-phase flow regime has been identified. Using sub-second imaging, information on dynamics of gas pathway establishment and re-imbibition during startup and shutdown of electrolyzers has been acquired. Using X-ray tomography and simulated mercury intrusion porosimetry coupled with capillary pressure calculations, the hydrophilicity of the internal surfaces of the porous transport layer material has been determined.

Herein, we reported first-principles results to explore the potential of transition metal (Sc- Cu, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Re, Ir and Pt) atoms embedded in monolayer g-C3N4 as efficient single-atom electrocatalysts for NH3 production. We found that embedding single Pt atoms in g-C3N4 enables robust stability and good electrical conductivity and particularly results in excellent activity (with a low limiting potential of -0.24 V) at room temperature. Furthermore, the dominant N-2 adsorption over that of H atoms suggests superior NH3 selectivity. Mechanistic analyses disclosed that single Pt atoms and g-C3N4 work in concert to address the significant deviation from the nitrogen linear scaling relationships, synergistically providing highly active sites for ambient electrochemical NH3 synthesis.									56	5	0	0	2	0	57			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472465300027

Our models include both element segregation and rotation-induced mixing, and we treat simultaneously the transport of matter and angular momentum as described by Zahn (1992) and Maeder (1995).We show that the hot side of the Li dip in the Hyades is well explained within this framework, which was also successfully used to reproduce the C and N anomalies in B type stars (Talon et al. 1997). On the cool side of the dip, another mechanism must participate in the transport of angular momentum; its efficiency is linked to the depth of the surface convection zone. That mechanism should also be responsible for the Sun's flat rotation profile.									85	0	0	0	1	0	85			1432-0746			WOS:000074979200031

Photoreduction gave stable blue colloidal c-TiO2 R NPs with 10-60 electrons per particle. Equilibration of these reduced NPs with soluble redox reagents such as methylviologen (MV2+) provided measurements of the colloid reduction potential as a function of pH. The potentials of c-TiO2 from pH 2-9 varied linearly with pH, with a slope of -60 +/- 5 mV/pH. Estimates of the potential at pH 12 were consistent with extrapolating that line to high pH. The reduction potentials did not correlate with the zeta potentials (C) or the surface charge of the NPs across this pH range. Similar reduction potentials were observed for c- and uc-TiO2 at low pH even though they have quite different potentials. These results show that the common surface-charging explanation of the pH dependence is not tenable in these systems. Oxidation of reduced c-TiO2 R with the electron-transfer oxidant potassium triiodide (KI3) occurred with a significant drop in pH, showing that protons were released when the electrons were removed from the NPs. Smaller pH drops were observed for the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reagents O-2 (air) and 4-MeO-TEMPO (4-methoxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperine-l-oxy radical). The difference in the number of protons released with KI3 vs O-2 and 4-MeO-TEMPO was roughly one proton per electron removed. Thus, the thermodynamically preferred reactivity of these colloidal TiO2 NPs is PCET over the pH 2-13 range studied. The measured redox potentials refer to the chemical process TiO2 + H+ e(-) -> TiO2 center dot e(-),H+; and therefore they do not correspond with an electronic energy such as a conduction band edge or flat band potential. The le(-)/1H(+) stoichiometry means that the TiO2 reduction potentials correspond to a TiO2-H bond dissociation free energy (BDFE), determined to be 49 +/- 2 kcal mol(-1). The PCET description is consistent with the pH dependence of E(TiO2/TiO2 center dot e(-),H+), the release of protons upon oxidation, the lack of correlation with zeta potentials, the similarity of capped and uncapped NPs, and the small change in the potential and BDFE from the first to the last electron/proton pair (H atom) removed. This behavior is suggested to be the norm for redox-active oxide/water interfaces.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000740020600001

The recent emergence of single atomic site catalysts (SASC) demonstrates that we are moving toward this goal. Owing to the maximum efficiency of atom-utilization and unique structures and properties, SASC have attracted extensive research attention and interest. The prerequisite for the scientific research and practical applications of SASC is to fabricate highly reactive and stable metal single atoms on appropriate supports. In this review, various synthetic strategies for the synthesis of SASC are summarized with concrete examples highlighting the key issues of the synthesis methods to stabilize single metal atoms on supports and to suppress their migration and agglomeration. Next, we discuss how synthesis conditions affect the structure and catalytic properties of SASC before ending this review by highlighting the prospects and challenges for the synthesis as well as further scientific researches and practical applications of SASC.									452	26	0	0	27	1	453			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000588271100004	32242408

However, these applications are primarily based on g-CN powders. Applications of g-CN in devices are hindered because of difficulties associated with the synthesis of high-quality g-CN films. This work reviews the latest advances in g-CN films. The deposition methods are summarized and the structural, optical, and electronic properties of g-CN films and their applications in catalysis, solar cells, and light-emitting diodes are outlined. Moreover, the challenges remaining in this field are also discussed.									64	1	0	0	6	0	64			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000386952000001	27624463

On standing in halogenated solvents, complex [2-H2O](BF4)(2) undergoes a slow but complete isomerization to [(PHCy2)(2)Pt(mu-PCy2)(mu-H)Pt{kappa P-P(OH)Cy-2}(H2O)](BF4)(2)(Pt-Pt) ([4-H2O][BF4](2)) having the P(OH)Cy-2 ligand trans to the hydride. The water molecule coordinated to platinum in [2-H2O][BF4](2) is readily replaced by halides, nitriles, and triphenylphosphane, and the acetonitrile complex [2-CH3CN][BF4](2) was characterized by XRD analysis. Solvento sfecies other than aqua complexes, such as [2-acetone-d(6)](2+) or [2-CD2Cl2](2+) were obtained in solution by the reaction of excess etherate HBF4 with 1 in the relevant solvent. The complex [2-H2O](Y)(2) [Y = F(HF)(n)] spontaneously isomerizes into the terminal hydrido complexes [(PHCy2)Pt(mu-PCy2){kappa P-2,O-mu-P(O)Cy-2}Pt(H)(PHCy2)](Y)(Pt-Pt) ([6](Y)). In the presence of HP, complex [6](Y) transforms into the bis-phosphanido-bridged Pt(II) dinuclear complex [(PHCy2)(H)Pt(mu-PCy2)(2)Pt{kappa P-P(OH)Cy-2}](Y)(Pt-Pt) ([7](Y)). When the reaction of 1 with HF was carried out with diluted hydrofluoric acid by allowing the HF to slowly diffuse into the dichloromethane solution, the main product was the linear 60e tetranuclear complex [(PHCy2){kappa P-P(O)Cy-2}Pt-1(mu-PCy2)(mu-H)Pt-2(mu-PCy2)](2)(Pt-1-Pt-2) (8). Insoluble compound 8 is readily protonated by HBF4 in dichloromethane, forming the more soluble species [(PHCy2){kappa P-(OH)Cy-2}Pt-1(mu-PCy2)(mu-H)Pt-2(mu-PCy2)](2)(BF4)(2)(Pt-1-Pt-2) {[9][BF4](2)}. XRD analysis of [9][BF4](2)center dot 2CH(2)Cl(2) shows that [9](2+) is comprised of four coplanar Pt atoms held together by four phosphanido and two hydrido bridges. Both XRD and NMR analyses indicate alternate intermetal distances with peripheral Pt-Pt bonds and a longer central Pt center dot center dot center dot Pt separation. DFT calculations allow tracing of the mechanistic pathways for the protonation of 1 by HBF4 and HF and evaluation of their energetic aspects. Our results indicate that in both cases the protonation occurs through an initial proton transfer from the acid to the phosphinito oxygen, which then shuttles the incoming proton to the Pt-Pt bond.The different evolution of the reaction with HF, leading also to [6](Y) or 8, has been explained in terms of the peculiar behavior of the F(HF)(n)(-) anions and their strong basicity for n = 0 or1.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0020-1669			WOS:000290457700046	21413721

However, it is still challenging to control nanopores density and structural features in a facile route and the preparation of porous alloy nanorods for catalytic appli-cation has not been well explored. In this work, we demonstrate a synthetic strategy to fabricate highly porous Au-Ag alloy nanorods (P-AuAgNRs) by critically dealloying Ag atoms from homogeneous solid Au- Ag alloy nanorods (AuAgNRs). Combining the merits of the tunable plasmonic properties of noble metal nanorods, excellent stabilities of alloys, and superior catalytic activities of porous structures, we use the P-AuAgNRs as a Raman probe for the in situ monitoring of the catalytic oxidation of 3,3',5,5' tetram-ethylbenzidine (TMB) and reduction of 4-nitrothiophenol (4-NTP). We also compare their composition-dependent catalytic activities. The results show that P-AuAgNRs possess superior chemical stability and higher catalytic activity than those of core-shell structures due to synergistic structural and chemical mechanisms. This strategy provides a predictive design approach for the next-generation alloy catalysts with high-performance.

The most important reactive dicarbonyl species, methylglyoxal (MG), formed as by-product during glucose metabolism, is more and more recognized as a trigger for the development and progression of diabetic complications. Although it is clear that MG provokes toxic effects, it is currently not well understood what cellular changes MG induces on a molecular level that may lead to pathophysiological conditions found in long-term diabetic complications. Here we review the current knowledge about the molecular effects that MG can induce in a cell. Within the mammalian system, we will focus mostly on the metabolic effects MG exerts when applied systemically to rodents or when applied in vitro to pancreatic beta-cells and adipocytes. Due to the common limitations associated with complex model organisms, we then summarize how yeast as a very simple model organism can help to gain valuable comprehensive information on general defence pathways cells exert in response to MG stress. Pioneering studies in additional rather simple eukaryotic model organisms suggest that many cellular reactions in response to MG are highly conserved throughout evolution.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0947-7349	1439-3646		WOS:000463341900003	29421830

The introduction of Ru is based on the adsorption of well-defined Ru-3(CO)(12) within the cavity of ZIFs following decomposition at 900 C. Moreover, without breaking the skeleton and porosity of ZIFs, the as-generated Ru species would bond with the Co nodes in situ to form bimetallic Ru-Co clusters if the Co-bearing metal organic frameworks were utilized as the host. Within the confined space of ZIFs, the assembly of Ru and Co could be rationally designed, and their structures could be sophisticatedly controlled at the atomic scale. Among these Ru-based compositions, the Ru Co clusters@N-C exhibited remarkable catalytic activity for the NH3 decomposition to H-2 and NH3 synthesis versus Ru-Co NPs@N-C, Ru clusters@N-C, and Ru NPs@N-C. This study may open up a new routine to synthesize metallic clusters or other subnano structures by the confinement of ZIFs.									35	4	0	0	1	0	35			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000416203800036	29052973

The deposit is hosted by a steeply dipping, S-facing homoclinal volcanic succession (similar to 2729-2726 Ma Waconiclai Formation, Lemoine Member) composed of effusive and intrusive tholeiitic rhyolites and andesites cut by comagmatic diorite and gabbro dikes and overlain by transitional to mildly calc-alkaline basalts, andesites, and rhyolites.Seven predominant synvolcanic alteration assemblages, now intensely deformed and metamorphosed to upper greenschist facies, were defined based on their mineralogy and position relative to ore. Albite-quartz, sericite-carbonate, sericite-chlorite, sericite-chlorite-(Zn), and chlorite-sericite-epidote-carbonate assemblages define semiconcordant zones that are stacked from the paleoseafloor to the deep footwall. In contrast, chlorite and chlorite-sericite-chloritoid assemblages overprint the other alteration zones and form subconcordant to now transposed discordant zones in the deposit footwall. Most alteration assemblages are characterized by relative SiO2, CaO, and Na2O mass losses and relative FeO, MgO, K2O, and CO2 mass gains. Whole-rock oxygen isotopes indicate that the temperatures of alteration ranged from similar to 100 degrees to 150 degrees C (sericite-carbonate assemblage) to >= 350 degrees C (sericite-chlorite, chlorite-sericite-chloritoid, and chlorite assemblages). The chlorite-sericite-chloritoid assemblage, and to some extent the sericite-chlorite assemblage, are associated with strong to near total depletion of light rare earth elements possibly due to reaction with Cl-bearing, mildly acidic fluids at depth in the ore-forming hydrothermal system.The sulfide lens was formed in part on the seafloor and in part by subseafloor replacement. The massive sulfides are particularly rich in Bi, suggesting a possible magmatic input into the Lemoine ore-forming hydrothermal system. High Bi concentrations in the mineralizing system are likely to have enhanced Au precipitation by scavenging the precious metal from the hydrothermal fluids. The Au-rich nature of the Lemoine auriferous volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit can be explained by a combination of very efficient metal transport, highly effective capture of metals at or near the seafloor, and a possible magmatic contribution to the hydrothermal system.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			0361-0128	1554-0774		WOS:000328665000011

This line is presumably less sensitive to temperature, atmospheric structure and departures from LTE than alternative carbon criteria. We find that [C/Fe] decreases slowly with increasing [Fe/H] with an overall slope of -0.17 +/- 0.03. Our results are consistent with carbon enrichment by superwinds of metal-rich massive stars but inconsistent with a main origin of carbon in low-mass stars. This follows in particular from a comparison between the relation of [C/O] with metallicity for the Galactic stars and the corresponding relation observed for dwarf irregular galaxies. The significance of intermediate-mass stars for the production of carbon in the Galaxy is still somewhat unclear.									165	1	0	0	0	0	166			0004-6361			WOS:000078703400014

Herein, we designed nickel foam supported (NiCo2)Se@Ni(OH)(2) (NCS@NH) heterojunction nanosheets by a two-step method. First of all, the NiCo2S4@Ni(OH)(2) (NiCo2S4@NH) nanosheets coated on nickel foam were acquired via a hydrothermal method. In the selenization treatment that followed, NiCo2S4@NH was converted into NCS@NH heterogeneous nanosheets in which the selenide nanoparticles decorated on the surface of the Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets formed heterojunction interfaces, and the heterogeneous structure could accelerate electron transfer, thus improving the catalytic activity. The Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets can adequately contact the electrolyte and promote the decomposition of water. Meanwhile, the thickness of the Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets gradually decreases with the increase of Co doping (1.5-2.5 mmol), consequently affecting the HER properties. Notably, when the amount of Co salt added is 2 mmol, NCS@NH exhibited superior HER properties (with a voltage of 253 mV at 100 mA cm(-2)) and excellent stability for 24 h.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000605666100040	33320141

In order to verify if the presence of this ancient trait is widespread within the order and to investigate why stoneflies have maintained it, we have extended the search for hemocyanin to species of other Plecoptera families. In particular, we assessed the presence of hemocyanin in the larval stage of nine Plecoptera species, belonging to six of the seven families of the European stonefly-fauna, and analyzed its potential functionality as deduced by sequence data. We cloned and sequenced the corresponding cDNAs and studied their expression with RT-PCR technique. Moreover, we performed homology studies using the deduced amino acid sequences. On the basis of our analysis, we hypothesized a functional role of the hemocyanin only for two species: Dinocras cephalotes and Isoperla grammatica (Perloidea). In all the investigated Nemouroidea and in Siphonoperla torrentium (Perloidea), this protein may have been lost. Larval size, life-cycle length, trophic role and environmental induction are discussed as possible explanations of these different physiological requirements.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0962-1075	1365-2583		WOS:000264185800008	19320761

This deposit consists of three major orebodies that are related to NS- and NE-striking fractures within fault zones in Permian-Triassic meta-sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the East Malaya Block. The faulting events represent different episodes that are related to each orebody and are correlated well with the mineralogy and paragenesis. The gold mineralization consists of quartz-dominant vein systems with sulfides and carbonates. The hydrothermal alteration and mineralization occurred during three stages that were characterized by (I) silicification and brecciation; (II) carbonatization, sericitization, and chloritization; and (III) quartz-carbonate veins.Fluid inclusions in the hydrothermal quartz and calcite of the three stages were studied. The primary CO2-CH4-H2O-NaCl fluid inclusions in stage I are mostly related to gold mineralization and display homogenization temperatures of 269-389 degrees C, salinities of 2.77-11.89 wt.% NaCl equivalent, variable CO2 contents (typically 5-29 mol%), and up to 15 mol% CH4. In stage II, gold was deposited at 235-398 degrees C from a CO2 +/- CH4-H2O-NaCl fluid with a salinity of 0.83-9.28 wt.% NaCl equivalent, variable CO2 contents (typically 5-63 mol%), and up to 4 mol% CH4. The delta(OH2O)-O-18 and delta D values of the ore-forming fluids from the stage II quartz veins are 4.5 to 4.8 parts per thousand and -44 to -42 parts per thousand, respectively, and indicate a metamorphic-hydrothermal origin. Oxygen fugacities calculated for the entire range of T-P-X-CO2 conditions yielded log f(O2) values between -28.95 and -36.73 for stage I and between -28.32 and -39.18 for stage II. These values indicate reduced conditions for these fluids, which are consistent with the mineral paragenesis, fluid inclusion compositions, and isotope values.The presence of daughter mineral-bearing aqueous inclusions is interpreted to be a magmatic signature of stage IIIa. Combined with the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions (delta O-18(H2O) = 6.8 to 11.9 parts per thousand, delta D = -77 to -62%.), these inclusions indicate that the initial fluid was likely derived from a magmatic source. In stage IIIb, the gold was deposited at 263 to 347 degrees C from a CO2-CH4-H2O-NaCl fluid with a salinity of 533 to 11.05 wt.% NaCl equivalent, variable CO2 contents (typically 9-15 mol%), and little CH4. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of this fluid (delta O-18(H2O) = 8.1 to 8.8 parts per thousand, delta D = -44 to -32 parts per thousand) indicate that it was mainly derived from a metamorphic-hydrothermal source. The CO2-H2O CH4-NaCl fluids that were responsible for gold deposition in the stage IIIc veins had a wide range of temperatures (214-483 degrees C), salinities of 1.02 to 21.34 wt.% NaCl equivalent, variable CO2 contents (typically 4-53 mol%), and up to 7 mol% CH4. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions (delta O-18(H2O) = 8.5 to 9.8 parts per thousand, delta D = -70 to -58 parts per thousand) were probably acquired at the site of deposition by mixing of the metamorphic-hydrothermal fluid with deep-seated magmatic water and then evolved by degassing at the site of deposition during mineralization. The log f(O2), values from -28.26 to -35.51 also indicate reduced conditions for this fluid in stage IIIc. Moreover, this fluid had a near-neutral pH and delta S-34 values of H2S of -232 to 0.83 parts per thousand, which may reflect the derivation of sulfur from the subducted oceanic lithospheric materials.The three orebodies represent different gold transportation and precipitation models, and the conditions of ore formation are related to distinct events of hydrothermal alteration and gold mineralization. The gold mineralization of the Ulu Sokor deposit occurred in response to complex and concurrent processes involving fluid immiscibility, fluid-rock reactions, and fluid mixing. However, fluid immiscibility was the most important mechanism for gold deposition and occurred in these orebodies, which have corresponding fluid properties, structural controls, geologic characteristics, tectonic settings, and origins of the ore-forming matter.

J	Brueckner, Stefanie M.; Johnson, Gregory; Wafforn, Stephanie; Gibson, Harold; Sherlock, Ross; Anstey, Christina; McNaughton, Ken								Potential for Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide Mineralization at the A6 Anomaly, North-West British Columbia, Canada: Stratigraphy, Lithogeochemistry, and Alteration Mineralogy and Chemistry								MINERALS				11	8					867	10.3390/min11080867				AUG 2021	2021	The Middle Jurassic A6 Anomaly is located 30 km southeast of Eskay Creek, north-central British Columbia and consists of thick, altered felsic igneous rocks overlain by a mafic volcano-sedimentary package. Lithogeochemistry on igneous rocks, X-ray diffraction on altered felsic units, and electron probe microanalysis and secondary ion mass spectrometry on illite and quartz were applied to explore the volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) potential, characterize alteration, and determine fluid conditions at the A6 Anomaly. Lithogeochemistry revealed calc-alkaline rhyodacite to trachyte of predominantly FII type, tholeiitic basalts with Nb/Yb < 1.6 (i.e., Group A), and transitional to calc-alkaline basalts and andesites with Nb/Yb > 2.2 (i.e., Group B). The felsic units showed weakly to moderately phyllic alteration (quartz-illite with minor orthoclase and trace chlorite-pyrite-calcite-barite-rutile). Illite ranged in composition from illite/smectite (K = 0.5-0.69 apfu) to almost endmember illite (K = 0.69-0.8 apfu), and formed from feldspar destruction by mildly acidic, relatively low temperature, oxidized hydrothermal fluids. The average delta O-18 composition was 10.7 +/- 3.0 parts per thousand and 13.4 +/- 1.3 parts per thousand relative to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water for illite and quartz, respectively. Geothermometry involving illite composition and oxygen isotope composition on illite and quartz yielded average fluid temperatures of predominantly 200-250 degrees C. Lithogeochemical results showed that the A6 Anomaly occurred in a late-Early to Middle Jurassic evolving back-arc basin, further east then previously recognized and in which transitional to calc-alkaline units formed by crustal assimilation to enriched Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt (EMORB) (i.e., felsic units, Group B), followed by thinning of the crust resulting in tholeiitic normalized MORB basalts (i.e., Group A) with a minor crustal component. The alteration assemblage is representative of distal footwall alteration, and metal transport in this zone was limited despite favorable temperature, pH, and redox state, indicating a metal depleted source (i.e., felsic units).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2075-163X		WOS:000689428600001

In the manufacturing of the dimensionally stable electrodes, the type of metal catalyst coated on the surface of the metal substrate, the coating and sintering methods substantially influence their performance and durability. In this study, using Ir-Ru-Ta ternary metal coating, various electrodes were prepared depending on the coating method under the same pre-treatment and sintering conditions, and its performance and durability were studied. As a coating method, brush and spray coating were used. As a result, the reduction in the amount of catalyst ink was achieved because more amount of metal could be coated for the electrode using spraying with the same amount of catalyst ink. In addition, the spray_2.0_3.0 electrode prepared by a specific spray coating method shows the phenomenon of cracking and the uniform coating of the ternary metal on the surface of the coating layer, and results in a high electrochemically active specific surface area, and the decomposition performance of 4-chlorophenol was superior to the other electrodes. However, it was found that there was no significant difference in durability depending on the coating method.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-0112	1228-4505		WOS:000752576500007		
J	Yuan TingYuan; Liu Yan; Zhang HuiMin								Petrology and tectonic implications of garnet granulite from Dong Tso, western Bangong-Nujiang suture zone								ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA				31	12			3663	3673						DEC 2015	2015	Separating the Qiangtang terrane in the north and the Lhasa block in the south, the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone is an important tectonic boundary within Central Tibet. However, subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang oceanic crust remains obscure. Here we report several garnet granulites in the vicinity of Dong Tso area, western Bangong-Nujiang suture zone, contributing to understand the tectonic evolution of Bangong-Nujiang suture zone. The garnet granulites as lenses in size of 5. 0 similar to 10mm are distinguished in amphibolites, which occur as tectonic slices in the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone and structurally contacting with ultramafic and mafic rocks. The garnet grains within garnet granulites present as porphyroblasts with irregularly compositional zonation. The composition of garnet core is more homogeneous and characterized by higher Ca and Mg but lower Fe and Mn than the garnet rim. Moreover the rims and cracks of garnet show paragenetic relationship with fine veins composed of chlorite and clinozoisite indicating that the garnet grains suffered metasomatism by later fluids. Fine-grained early garnets and amphiboles were found as inclusions in diopside. These garnets are smaller than 10 pan and characterized by higher Fe and Mn but lower Ca and Mg than the garnet core. All the amphiboles are calcic amphiboles. The early amphiboles are different from the late amphiboles by their enrichment in Na, Fe3+, as well as trace amount of Ba. The early amphiboles normally as inclusions in garnet and diopside porphyroblasts have been transformed into diopsides (rich in Ca but poor in Fe3+ and Na) and melt pockets dominanted by albite. Inclusions/exsolutions composed of plagioclases and Ba-rich hyalophanes are widely distributed in the melt pockets. The late amphiboles occur as fine-grained symplectite with plagioclases surrounding the rim of garnet or present as porphyroblast in matrix, suggesting that they are retrograde products of garnet granulites. In addition, sphenes (rich in Al) are found in the matrix and rutile grains have been replaced by fine and irregular sphene (poor in Al) and ilmenite. Therefore the mineral assemblage of prograde stage is consisting of early garnet (Grt,), early amphibole (Amp,), Al-rich sphene (Spn,) and so on. The peak metamorphic stage is documented by garnet core (Grt(2)) + diopside + plagioclase (Pl(1),) + quartz + rutile + Na-rich and Ba-rich melts, which formed at 870 degrees C, 11. 7kbar on the basis of traditional geothermobarometer. Garnet rim/crack (Grt) + late amphibole (Amp(2)) + clinozoisite + chlorite + plagioclase (Pl(2)) + white mica + Al-poor sphene (Spn(2)) + ilmenite are regarded as the retrograde stage assemblage. In combination with petrographic and geochemical investigations and estimation of metamorphic P-T condition indicates that Dong Tso garnet granulites are products of warm subduction of oceanic crust, providing petrological evidence for the view that 'the Bangong-Nujiang oceanic basin contains many sub-oceanic basin '. The significant decrease of Fe3+ (a. p. f. u) in amphibole and marked increase of almandine from peak to retrograde stage reveals that the Dong Tso garnet granulites suffered reduction reaction and the amphiboles were redoxed during dehydration, generating adakite magma with high oxygen fugacity which promotes the activation from subducted warm oceanic crust and migration to arc magma of ore-forming elements, such as Cu and Au.Therefore, our work provides a case study of the chemical interactions and material migration between subducted warm oceanic slab and overlying subarc mantle wedge, and also contributes to intensively understanding the formation of numerous porphyry-type copper and gold deposits within the Bangong-Nujiang metallogenic belt.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1000-0569	2095-8927		WOS:000367640000011

Compound (2) was irreversibly tethered to the surface through the SH group; (1) was present only in the unadsorbed (dissolved) state. No enhancement of the proton reduction reaction was observed with the homogeneous complex. Pronounced catalysis was exhibited by the heterogenized (surface-attached) material. Neither increase nor decrease in activity was observed when unadsorbed complex (2) was added to the solution of the heterogenized catalyst. The conclusion from these observations, that no catalysis transpires unless the subject molecular complex is tethered to the electrode surface, is totally unexpected; it runs counter to conventional wisdom that an untethered homogeneous electrocatalyst, especially one that requires a particular entatic (partially rotated) configuration to complete its function, would invariably perform better than its surface-immobilized counterpart. The heterogenized complex, present at rather low coverages due to its sizable adsorbed-molecule cross section, was further investigated by polarization-modulation Fourier transform infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-FT-IRRAS), high-resolution electron-energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The electrochemistry (EC) and STM results indicated that the catalytic activity of the immobilized complex is a function of its surface coverage but not of its spatial configuration; the catalytic sites are accessible regardless of the particular arrangement of the pendant active site with respect to the surface. The surface-immobilized complex suffered a non-negligible loss in catalytic activity after the ex situ experiments, perhaps due to (partial) decarbonylation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The nearby redox-active tyrosine (Y-Z) serves as a direct electron acceptor of the Mn4Ca cluster and it forms a low-barrier H-bond (LBHB) with a neighboring histidine residue (D1-His190). Experimental evidence indicates that Y-Z oxidation triggers changes in the hydrogen bonding network that precede proton abstraction from the Mn4Ca cluster. In order to characterize such changes, we compare ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of different states of the catalytic cycle of PSII with dynamics of isolated tyrosine models (namely, p-cresol) in different oxidation states. The systematic comparison of the H-bond networks in different simulated systems suggests that the Y-Z oxidation leads to a water hydration pattern which is more similar to that of the neutral p-cresol rather than that of the p-cresol anion. Our simulations also reveal the twofold nature of the interactions between Y-Z and the Mn4Ca cluster. Firstly, the Y-Z oxidation triggers rapid structural changes of the H-bond pattern in the proximity of the cluster which have been observed to propagate on the ps time scale on the Ca2+ hydration shell up to other water molecules in the proximity of the cluster. Secondly, it is clear that Y-Z interacts with the Mn4Ca cluster also through Coulombic interactions mediated by CP43-Arg357 through the remaining positive charge of the pair. Our results are able to identify, for the first time, the structural rearrangements guided by the oxidation of Y-Z necessary for the evolution of the water splitting reaction in PSII. Based on these findings, we propose a mechanism of structural changes which is functional towards the progression of the catalytic cycle in PSII.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000516527900025	31808768

Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy suggested that CuO species were highly dispersed on the nanosheets. X-ray absorption fine structure spectra indicated that the distorted and stretched Cu-O coordination structures in CuO/Bi2MoO6 nanosheets would provide open active sites. In situ Fourier transform infrared and density functional theory results showed that toluene molecules could be chemisorbed and activated on the active sites of CuO/Bi2MoO6 nanosheets by the C-H group forming CuO/Bi2MoO6 center dot center dot center dot Ph-CH3 surface complex compounds. These would induce electron-hole transfer and initiate photocatalytic reactions under visible light irradiation. The corresponding intermediates of benzaldehyde and benzoic acid would be detected by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of CuO and Bi2MoO6 nanosheets could monitor charge dynamics to facilitate their respective transmission from photoexcitation sites to active centers. This work provides new insights into the essence of visible-light-driven surface photocatalysis and is expected to promote the design of novel and more effective photocatalysts at the molecular level.									24	0	0	0	3	0	24			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000508464500030	31840500

Although much effort has been focused on exploring novel catalysts, their potential effects are usually counteracted by a quick passivation of the electrode as a consequence of side reactions, which likely contribute to the widely observed high-voltage reversibility (e.g. >4 V). Here, we report a job-sharing design of a carbon-based cathode, Ru-IL (ionic liquid)-CNT (carbon nanotube), with fine Ru nanodots anchored on the IL-decorated CNT surface. The subnanometer IL cation linker is crucial to seal carbon surface defects without sacrificing Li+/e(-) charge transfer and therefore efficiently suppresses the occurrence of side reactions. This charged decoration guarantees that Ru functions as the microstructure promoter to stabilize highly disordered Li2O2. It enables achievement of high energy efficiency (80-84%) Li-O-2 batteries characterized by a substantial charge plateau with an extremely low overpotential of 0.18 V. Even by using the mode of voltage cut-off, a reversible capacity around 800-1000 mA h g(-1) is maintained for more than 100 cycles. When the reversible capacity is limited to 500 mA h g(-1), the cycling number can reach up to at least 240 cycles. The disentangled CNT networks, loose precipitation of nanostructured products and high donor number electrolytes allow thick electrode fabrication (8 mg cm(-2)), leading to a high areal capacity of 3.6-7.6 mA h cm(-2). Our results indicate a defect-inspired strategy to bury undesired defect sites in the original electrode framework and to electrochemically synthesize the stable defect-rich Li2O2 product.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000366825300025

The heterostructure was verified as an effective hetero-geneous Fenton-like catalyst for degrading antibiotics including tetracycline, oxytetracycline and chlortetracy-cline hydrochloride, and the related catalytic mechanism was elaborated in detail. Under the optimum conditions, the m-MF@CN/H2O2/vis system exhibited superior photo-Fenton property (degradation efficiency of 93.15% within 30 min, TOC removal efficiency was as high as 60.54% within 120 min) and cycle stability for tetracycline removal. The combination of MgFe2O4 and g-C3N4 enhanced the absorption of visible light, and the energy level matched heterojunction promoted the separation of photogenerated electron-holes to accelerate the redox cycle of equivalent to Fe3+/equivalent to Fe2+. Free radical quenching and electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis confirmed that center dot O-2(-) was the main active species, h(+) and center dot OH also played a synergistic role in the degrading reactions. Notably, a possible degradation pathway of tetracycline was proposed according to the intermediates produced in the re-action process. The one-step synthesized m-MF@CN nanocomposite catalysts possessed high catalytic performance, good stability and recoverability, which not only realized the high-value utilization of ore raw materials, but also provided a potential practical way for efficient treatment of antibiotic wastewater.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0301-4797	1095-8630		WOS:000868332400002	35998532

The AuNi nanodendrite arrays were rapidly prepared by a one-step electrodeposition method using the porous anodic aluminum templates. Owing to its hierarchical structure with abundant active sites, the synergistic catalytic of Au and Ni can be better exploited. These plasmonic AuNi nanodendrite arrays display exceptional photoelectrocatalytic activities for glucose oxidation and hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction under visible light illumination. Specifically, the detection sensitivity for glucose (3.7277 mA mM(-1) cm(-2)) under illumination is about 3.3 folds improvement than in the dark (1.1287 mA mM(-1) cm(-2)), together with high accuracy and low detection limit of 3 mu M. The markedly enhanced performance of AuNi nanodendrite arrays can be attributed to its hierarchical structure with abundant active sites and plasmonic effect of Au with strong absorption band in visible region. Such a newly developed method via the facile and low-cost route is of great significance in designing the plasmon-aided photoelectrochemical biosensors.									19	1	0	0	3	0	19			0956-5663	1873-4235		WOS:000487175000012	31430613

The procedures require not more than an hour to complete at 120-150 degrees C with quantitative yields of: (i) few-atomic-layers thick porous sheets of Ni0.75Fe0.25(OH) 2+ x with surface area ABET = 149 m2 g(-1), and (ii) interconnected Ni0.75Fe0.25S2+ y particles of few nanometers in size covered with a thin oxide/hydroxide layer having ABET = 87 m2 g(-1). These and other morphological and structural features of the materials were inferred from XRD, XPS, Ni-and Fe-edge EXAFS/XANES, TEM/SAED, EDX mapping, SEM, N2 adsorption-desorption, and electrochemical techniques. At lower loadings on the electrode surface (# 0.01 mg cm(-2)), the specific activity for water (1 M KOH) electrooxidation at 0.3 V overpotential is 210 A g(-1) for Ni0.75Fe0.25(OH) 2+ x, and 384 A g(-1) for Ni0.75Fe0.25S2+ y, which excels the performance of the best-performing analogues. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity of sulphides over hydroxides is defined by the better electrical conductivity and different nature of the electrochemically active surface species. At higher loadings, the activity of the microwave-synthesised NiFe catalysts is found to be partially limited by agglomeration, though still high enough to enable the water oxidation rate of 10 mA cmgeom(-2) at overpotentials of only 0.270 +/- 0.005 (flat support) and 0.21 V (foam support) with Ni0.75Fe0.25S2+ y. The developed methods offer a new facile strategy for the creation of high-performing multicomponent catalysts.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			2398-4902			WOS:000436519000016

In this study, a nonmetallic plasmonic S-scheme photocatalyst was fabricated by loading 1D plasmonic W18O49 nanowires onto 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets. W18O49 nanowires play the dual role of a light absorption antenna-that extends light adsorption-and a hot electron donor-that assists the water reduction reaction in a wider light spectrum range. Moreover, S-scheme charge transfer resulting from the matching bandgaps of W18O49 and g-C3N4 can lead to strong redox capability and high migration speed of the photoinduced charges. Consequently, in this study, W18O49/g-C3N4 hybrids exhibited higher photocatalytic H-2 generation than that of pristine g-C3N4 under light irradiation of 420-550 nm. Furthermore, the H-2 production rate of the best-performing W18O49/g-C3N4 hybrid was 41.5 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1) upon exposure to monochromatic light at 550 nm, whereas pure g-C3N4 showed negligible activity. This study promotes novel and environmentally friendly hot-electron-assisted S-scheme photocatalysts for the broad-spectrum utilization of solar light.

J	Shin, Kwanghee A.; Spain, Jim C.								Pathway and Evolutionary Implications of Diphenylamine Biodegradation by Burkholderia sp Strain JS667								APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY				75	9			2694	2704		10.1128/AEM.02198-08				MAY 1 2009	2009	Diphenylamine (DPA) is a common contaminant at munitions-contaminated sites as well as at aniline manufacturing sites. Little is known about the biodegradation of the compound, and bacteria able to use DPA as the growth substrate have not been reported. Burkholderia sp. strain JS667 and Ralstonia sp. strain JS668 were isolated by selective enrichment from DPA-contaminated sediment. The isolates grew aerobically with DPA as the sole carbon, nitrogen, and energy source. During induction of DPA degradation, stoichiometric amounts of aniline accumulated and then disappeared, which suggested that aniline is on the DPA degradation pathway. Genes encoding the enzymes that catalyze the initial steps in DPA degradation were cloned from the genomic DNA of strain JS667. The Escherichia coli clone catalyzed stoichiometric transformation of DPA to aniline and catechol. Transposon mutagenesis, the sequence similarity of putative open reading frames to those of well-characterized dioxygenases, and O-18(2) experiments support the conclusion that the initial reaction in DPA degradation is catalyzed by a multicomponent ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase. DPA is converted to aniline and catechol via dioxygenation at the 1,2 position of the aromatic ring and spontaneous rearomatization. Aniline and catechol are further biodegraded by the well-established aniline degradation pathway. Genes that encode the complete aniline degradation pathway were found 12 kb downstream of the genes that encode the initial dioxygenase. Expression of the relevant dioxygenases was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Both the sequence similarity and the gene organization suggest that the DPA degradation pathway evolved recently by the recruitment of two gene clusters that encode the DPA dioxygenase and aniline degradation pathway.									33	0	0	0	29	0	34			0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:000265586900012	19251893

The as-prepared g-C3N4 exhibited a porous thin sheet like structure with a larger surface area and showed an efficient separation efficiency for radiative charge carriers. The textural structure and morphology of the porous g-C3N4 materials were well characterized by TEM, SEM, XRD, BET, FTIR, Raman, XPS, UV-vis DRS and PL spectroscopy. The starch mediated porous g-C3N4 photocatalyst demonstrated significantly an enhanced visible light photocatalytic performance and excellent physicochemical stability for the photodegradation of organic pollutants (including rhodamine B and phenol). The results revealed that, the optimized gaseous template contents had a significant influence on photooxidative chemical reaction of the as-prepared samples. The radical scavenging experiments proved that holes and . O-2(-) are the main reactive species responsible for the visible light degradation of rhodamine B. This simple, economical and green strategy using starch as gaseous porogen agent for the fabrication of porous g-C3N4 with excellent visible-light photocatalytic activity is desirable for environmental remediation and solar energy applications.									23	3	0	0	3	0	25				2213-3437		WOS:000411143200048

The rate of NO consumption and N2O production were found to be linearly dependent on enzyme concentration, and activity was abolished by enzyme denaturation. Thus, contrary to the eukaryotic enzyme, both T. thermophilus oxidases display a NO reductase activity (3.0 +/- 0.7 mol NO/mol ba(3) x min and 32 +/- 8 mol NO/mol caa(3) x min at [NO] approximate to 50 mu M and 20 degrees C) that, though considerably lower than that of bona fide NO reductases (300-4,500 mol NO/mol enzyme x min), is definitely significant. We also show that for bas oxidase, NO reduction is associated to oxidation of cytochrome b at a rate compatible with turnover, suggesting a mechanism consistent with the stoichiometry of the overall reaction. We propose that the NO reductase activity of T. thermophilus oxidases may depend on a peculiar Cu-B(+) coordination, which may be revealed by the forthcoming three-dimensional structure. These findings support the hypothesis of a common phylogeny of aerobic respiration and bacterial denitrification, which was proposed on the basis of structural similarities between the Pseudomonas stutzeri NO reductase and the cbb(3) terminal oxidases. Our findings represent functional evidence in support of this hypothesis.									140	0	0	0	101	0	142			0027-8424			WOS:000084375400012	10611279

The Asiatic rice borer, Chilo suppressalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is an economically important insect pest of rice crops. In this study, a mitochondrial manganese SOD (Cs-mMnSOD) gene was characterized in C. suppressalis.The deduced Cs-mMnSOD protein has typical highly conserved features of mitochondrial manganese SODs, including four manganese binding residues, the signature DVWEHAYY peptide, and a mitochondria) targeting sequence at the N-terminus. Transcription of Cs-mMnSOD was detectable at all developmental stages, but highest in pupae. Furthermore, the mRNA level of Cs-mMnSOD was strongly upregulated (more than twofold increase) following exposure to low and high temperatures (4, 30 and 35 degrees C), insecticides (chlorpyrifos and chlorantraniliprole), and chemical reagents (cumene hydroperoxide, paraquat, H2O2 and CdCl2), but slightly elevated (less than twofold increase) in response to 8 degrees C, abamectin and CuSO4. Additionally, the Cs-mMnSOD transcription results were consistent with the enzymatic activity data of the protein product. Purified recombinant Cs-mMnSOD protein expressed in Escherichia coli displayed SOD activity and thermostability. Furthermore, E. coli cells overexpressing Cs-mMnSOD exhibited long-term resistance to the oxidative inducers cumene hydroperoxide and paraquat. Our findings indicate that Cs-mMnSOD plays an important role in protecting C. suppressalis against oxidative damage.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000446164200044	29939281

The as-received films consisting of beta-SiC nanocrystals embedded in amorphous SiOxCy and free carbon nanosheets were fabricated via melt spinning of polycarbosilane (PCS) precursors and cured for 3 h/10 h followed by pyrolysis from 900 degrees C to 1200 degrees C. Results reveal that nanoscale structure (beta-SiC/SiOxCy/C-free) provides an ingenious strategy for constructing highly thermal conductive, highly insulating and highly flexible complexes. In particular, the 3 h-cured films sintered at 1200 degrees C with satisfying thermal conductivity (46.8 W m(-1) K-1) and electrical resistivity (2.1 x 10(8) Omega m) are suitable for the realization of high-performance substrates. A remarkable synergistic effect (lattice vibration of beta-SiC nanocrystals and close-packed SiOxCy free-electron heat conduction of beta-SiC and free carbon, and supporting role of oxygen vacancy) contributing to thermal conductivity improvement is proposed based on the analysis of microstructure, intrinsic properties and simulations. Eventually, the SiC films without additional dielectric layers are directly silk-screen printed with high-temperature silver paste and used as heat dissipation substrates for high-power LED devices via chip-on-board (COB) package. The final devices can emit bright light with low-junction temperature (52.6 degrees C) and good flexibility owing to the mono-layer SiC substrate with low thermal resistance and desirable mechanical properties. This work offers an effective approach to design and fabricate flexible heat dissipation ceramic substrates for thermal management in advanced electronic packaging fields.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000427215100036

The strain of S. vortens studied here was isolated from an angelfish and grown in Keister's modified TY-I-S33 medium. A membrane-inlet mass spectrometer was employed to monitor, in a closed system, O-2, CO2, and H-2. When introduced into air-saturated buffer, S. vortens rapidly consumed O-2 at the average rate of 62 +/- 4 nmol/min/107 cells and CO2 was produced at 75 +/- 11 nmol/min/107 cells. Hydrogen production began under microaerophilic conditions ([O-2]=33.+/- 15 mu M) at a rate of 77 +/- 7 nmol/min/107 cells. Hydrogen production was inhibited by 62% immediately after adding 150 mu M KCN to the reaction vessel, and by 50% at 0.24 mu M CO, suggesting that an Fe-only hydrogenase is responsible for H-2 production. Metronidazole (1 mM) inhibited H-2 production by 50%, while CO2 production was not affected. This suggests that metronidazole may be reduced by an enzyme of the H-2 pathway, thus competing for electrons with H+.									20	0	0	0	17	0	20			1066-5234	1550-7408		WOS:000281284800002	20726936

One-dimensional photocatalysts were obtained by the electrospinning method. Particles of metals such as iron, chromium, and copper were used as additives that are capable of improving the fibers' photocatalytic properties based on SrTiO3/PAN. The optimal ratios of the solutions for the electrospinning of fibers based on SrTiO3/PAN with the addition of metal oxide particles were determined. The transmission and reflection of composite photocatalysts with metal oxide particles were measured in a wide range of spectra, from the ultraviolet region (185 nm) to near-infrared radiation (3600 nm), to determine the values of their bandgaps. Thus, the introduction of metal oxide particles resulted in a decrease in the bandgaps of the obtained composite photocatalysts compared to the initial SrTiO3/PAN (3.57 eV), with the following values: -3.11 eV for SrTiO3/PAN/Fe2O3, -2.84 eV for SrTiO3/PAN/CuO, and -2.89 eV for SrTiO3/PAN/Cr2O3. The obtained composite photocatalysts were tested for the production of hydrogen by the splitting of water-methanol mixtures under UV irradiation, and the following rates of hydrogen evolution were determined: 344.67 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) for SrTiO3/PAN/Fe2O3, 398.93 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) for SrTiO3/PAN/Cr2O3, and 420.82 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) for SrTiO3/PAN/CuO.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2079-4991		WOS:000582045500001	32882871

Herein, for the first time, an Au/p-TiO2 (p-type TiO2) strategy with the hole transfer mechanism is developed, remarkably promoting visible-light photocatalytic performance. An efficient acetone evolution rate (138 mu mol-g(-1).h(-1)) in the photocatalytic isopropyl alcohol (IPA) degradation under lambda(ex) = 500 nm light (light intensity, 5.5 mW/cm(2)) was achieved over Au/p-TiO2, which is approximately 5 times as high as that over Au/n-TiO2 under the same conditions. Photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements indicate enhanced charge carrier separation and transfer for Au/p-TiO2. In an elaborate study, apparent quantum efficiency and transmission electron microscopy characterization on selective PbO2 deposition over p-TiO2 revealed that visible-light-excited holes other than electrons generated in the Au interband transition transferred to p-TiO2, which is opposite to the general route in Au/n-TiO2 (n-type TiO2). Energetic holes generated in the d band of Au led to a fluent transfer across the Schottky barrier, which is further confirmed by the IPA photodegradation mechanism study with different scavengers over Au/p-TiO2. This discovery opens up new opportunities in designing and developing efficient metal semiconductor composite materials with visible-light response.									33	4	0	0	2	0	34			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000475532200036	31190526

Herein, we report the identification and characterization of a catalase homolog from Amphiprion clarkii (ClCat), followed by its functional characterization. An open reading frame was identified in the cDNA sequence of ClCat at 1581 bp, which encodes a protein of 527 amino acids (aa) with a molecular mass of 60 kDa. In silico analyses of ClCat revealed characteristic features of the catalase family and a lack of a signal peptide. Multiple sequence alignment of ClCat indicated the conservation of functionally important residues among its homologs. According to phylogenetic analysis, ClCat was of vertebrate origin, positioned within the teleost clade. During native conditions, ClCat mRNA was highly expressed in blood, followed by the liver and kidney. Moreover, significant changes in ClCat transcription were observed after stimulation with LPS, poly I:C, and Vibrio harveyi, in a time-dependent manner. Recombinant ClCat (rClCat) was characterized, and its peroxidase activity was determined. Furthermore, the optimum temperature and pH for rClCat were determined to be 30-40 C and pH 7, respectively. Oxidative stress tolerance and chromatin condensation assays indicated enhanced cell survival and reduced apoptosis, resulting from reactive oxygen species scavenging by rClCat. The DNA-protective function of rClCat was further confirmed via a metal-catalyzed oxidation assay. Taken together, our findings propose that rClCat plays an essential role in maintaining cellular oxidative homeostasis and host immune protection.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000647703200001	33826938

While many plants express a microsomal-type FNS II, the soluble FNS I appears to be confined to a few species of the Apiaceae and was cloned recently from parsley plants. FNS I belongs to the Fe-II/2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases characterized by short conserved sequence elements for cofactor binding, and its evolutionary context and mode of action are under investigation. Using a homology-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction approach, two additional flavonoid-specific dioxygenases were cloned from immature parsley leaflets, which were identified as flavanone 3beta-hydroxylase (FHT) and flavonol synthase (FLS) after expression in yeast cells. Sequence alignments revealed marginal differences among the parsley FNS I and FHT polypeptides of only 6%, while much less identity (about 29%) was observed with the parsley FLS. Analogous to FNS I, FLS oxidizes the flavonoid gamma-pyrone by introducing a C2, C3 double bond, and (2R,3S)-dihydro-kaempferol (cis-dihydrokaempferol) was proposed recently as the most likely intermediate in both FNS I and FLS catalysis. Incubation of either FNS I or FLS with cis-dihydrokaempferol exclusively produced kaempferol and confirmed the assumption that flavonol formation occurs via hydroxylation at C3 followed by dehydratation. However, the lack of apigenin in these incubations ruled out cis-dihydrokaempferol as a free intermediate in FNS I catalysis. Furthermore, neither (+)-trans-dihydrokaempferol nor unnatural (-)-trans-dihydrokaempferol and 2-hydroxynaringenin served as a substrate for FNS I. Overall, the data suggest that FNS I has evolved uniquely in some Apiaceae as a paraphyletic gene from FHT, irrespective of the fact that FNS I and FLS catalyze equivalent desaturation reactions.

To understand the characteristics of hydrogeochemical processes controlling the water quality evolution after the closure of mines, a multi-aquifer system in a closed coalfield in Huainan eastern of China was investigated as an example. Based on the results of mineral characterizations, hydrogeochemistry, and stable isotopes, carbonates minerals, gypsum, and clay minerals as well as atmosphere gases-O-2, CO2, and H2O were recognized as major reactants, and evaporation, dissolution/precipitation of minerals and cation exchange were potential reactions. Using inverse geochemical modeling, three major hydrogeochemical paths in the closed mines were identified. Path1 shows that water in the closed mines is mainly recharged by the overlying Quaternary aquifer and the underlying limestone aquifers through faults and fractures, accompanied by cation exchange and sulfate reduction, making the concentrations of Na+ + K+ and HCO3- increase and the concentration of SO42- decreases along the groundwater flow path. Path 2 shows that the karst groundwater flows from the shallow (recharge) zone to the deep (circulation) zone and then flows upwards to recharge the closed mine and the Permian aquifer through faults and fractures. Along Path 2, dolomite precipitates, ion exchange, and halite dissolution mainly take place, making the concentrations of Na+ + K+ and Cl- increase and the concentration of Ca2+ and HCO3- decrease and the water chemistry type change from Ca-HCO3 type to Na + K-Cl type. Path 3 shows that waters in the mining subsidence ponds (MSPs), Huai River and Quaternary loose aquifer (QLA) are connected. Although the major elements of water in QLA still meet the drinking water guidelines of World Health Organization (WHO) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), considering the fact that water in QLA is a vital drinking water source for local communities, proactive measurements should be undertaken to lower the risk of contamination of QLA by MSPs through minimizing the hydraulic connection between them. Results of this study could benefit water quality prediction and management for these complex and vulnerable systems in the study area as well as other regions of the world.									20	0	0	0	8	0	20			0022-1694	1879-2707		WOS:000568830400077

These bacteria share the unique ability of using methane as a sole carbon and energy source and have been found in a great variety of habitats. Phylogenetically, known methanotrophs constitute a rather limited group and have so far only been affiliated with the Proteobacteria. Here, we report the isolation and initial characterization of a nonproteobacterial obligately methanotrophic bacterium. The isolate, designated Kam1, was recovered from an acidic hot spring in Kamchatka, Russia, and is more thermoacidophilic than any other known methanotroph, with optimal growth at approximate to 55 degrees C and pH 3.5. Kam1 is only distantly related to all previously known methanotrophs and belongs to the Verrucomicrobia lineage of evolution. Genes for methane monooxygenases, essential for initiation of methane oxidation, could not be detected by using standard primers in PCR amplification and Southern blot analysis, suggesting the presence of a different methane oxidation enzyme. Kam1 also lacks the well developed intracellular membrane systems typical for other methanotrophs. The isolate represents a previously unrecognized biological methane sink, and, due to its unusual phylogenetic affiliation, it will shed important light on the origin, evolution, and diversity of biological methane oxidation and on the adaptation of this process to extreme habitats. Furthermore, Kam1 will add to our knowledge of the metabolic traits and biogeochemical roles of the widespread but poorly understood Verrucomicrobia phylum.									212	22	1	0	202	0	233			0027-8424			WOS:000252435300056	18172218	
J	Nittler, LR								Constraints on heterogeneous galactic chemical evolution from meteoritic stardust								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				618	1			281	296		10.1086/425892				JAN 1 2005	2005	Meteorites contain presolar grains that formed in stars prior to solar system formation and preserve a record of stellar and galactic evolutionary processes. We consider a stochastic model of heterogeneous mixing of supernova ejecta into a homogeneous interstellar medium (ISM), first presented by Lugaro et al. The predictions of the model for Si, Ti, and O isotopic ratios are compared with the compositions of presolar SiC, Al2O3, and MgAl2O4 grains. Model parameters that reproduce the range of Si isotopic ratios in SiC grains fail to reproduce the strong observed correlation between SiC Si and Ti isotopic ratios and the range of O-18/O-16 ratios in the oxide phases. The Si-Ti correlation in SiC implies that heterogeneous mixing of SNe ejecta can account for at most 40% of the range of grain isotopic compositions. This result further implies that the ejecta from diverse SNe are well mixed to the percent level in the ISM, consistent with recent results based on stellar and interstellar abundance measurements. However, the presolar grain data provide much more stringent limits on the range of relative element ratios (e. g., Mg/Fe) than can be derived from astronomical observations. The large scatter inmetallicity observed for disk stars of a given age cannot be explained by heterogeneous mixing of stellar ejecta. The range of O-18/O-16 ratios measured in presolar oxide grains implies either that they formed in stars with a wider range of metallicities than the SiC progenitor stars or that their parent stars experienced moderate amounts of cool bottom processing.									52	0	0	0	1	0	53			0004-637X			WOS:000226048800020

The temperature range for this study is chosen to be higher than the operating temperature range of the alloy to accelerate the oxidation kinetics. Developing a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics involved at such accelerated oxidation environments would help to formulate better strategies for countering oxidation related failure events. The results of this study showed that the oxidation rate is greatly influenced by temperature as well as exposure time, and follows a near-parabolic rate law. Characterization of the oxide scales revealed formation of dual oxide layers where the inner layer is primarily rich in Fe and Cr, and the outer layer in Fe only. At 1073 K, formation of cracks can be observed in the oxide scales after 24 h, which became more severe after 1000 h. The oxidation kinetics, when fitted to an Arrhenius type equation, can be associated with activation energy (Q) and parabolic rate constant (k(p)) values. The Q values lie within 104-109 kJ/mol, whereas the k(p) values increase with temperature due to increase in the reaction rate. The kinetic equation developed based on the Q and k(p) values can be used to predict the thickness (inner, outer and overall) of the oxide scales in T91 steel at any temperature and time within the studied ranges.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1598-9623	2005-4149		WOS:000713915500001		
J	Fox, JL; Hac, A								Velocity distributions of C atoms in CO+ dissociative recombination: Implications for photochemical escape of C from Mars								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS				104	A11			24729	24737		10.1029/1999JA900330				NOV 1 1999	1999	We have carried out Monte Carlo calculations to determine the velocity distributions of C atoms produced by dissociative recombination of CO+ using recent data for the branching ratios of various allowed channels and ion and electron temperatures appropriate to the Martian thermosphere. We find that the fractions of C-12 atoms with velocities greater than the escape velocity are similar to 0.66 and similar to 0.62, and those for C-13 are similar to 0.47 and similar to 0.48 at the plasma temperatures characteristic of the exobases at low and high solar activities, respectively. The ratio of the escape fractions of C-13 and C-12, which is a measure of the isotope effect inherent in the CO+ dissociative recombination mechanism, is thus in the range 0.72-0.77. Using model thermospheres and ionospheres for low solar activity from Viking, and for high solar activity from the Mars Thermospheric General Circulation Model, we have computed the global escape flux of C due to dissociative recombination of CO+ as (3 - 5) x 10(5) cm(-2) s(-1). This value is of the same order as current estimates for the escape flux of C in all forms due to sputtering by O+ pickup ions at the current epoch but may be much less than that due to sputtering at earlier times in the history of the planet.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000083414700013		
J	STEMLER, A; JURSINIC, PA								OXIDATION-REDUCTION POTENTIAL DEPENDENCE OF FORMATE BINDING TO PHOTOSYSTEM-II IN MAIZE THYLAKOIDS								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA				1183	2			269	280		10.1016/0005-2728(93)90228-8				DEC 7 1993	1993	The affinity of Photosystem II for formate is less when thylakoid membranes are incubated with ferricyanide in complete darkness. A redox titration of this effect showed that the affinity for formate is not determined by the oxidation state of the non-heme iron (Q(400)) associated with the reaction center complex, nor does formate influence the mid-point potential, E(m), of Q(400). Rather, the formate affinity is determined by the oxidation state of a component with an E(m), of about +480 mV at pH 7.0. The E(m) of this single-electron redox mediator, here referred to as D-480 has a pH-dependence of approx. 60 mV/pH. D-480 is tentatively identified as an auxiliary electron donor (E(m) = +475 mV at pH 7.6), first described by Bearden and Malkin (Bearden, A.J. and Malkin, R. (1973) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 325, 266-274). When D-480 is oxidized in the dark by ferricyanide, the affinity of Photosystem II for other monovalent anions such as bicarbonate and chloride is low. A single saturating flash reverses the effect of ferricyanide, indicating that oxidized D-480 can be reduced in the light. The binding of bicarbonate ions to formate-inhibited thylakoids shows a period-of-two oscillation with flash number. Oxidation of D-480 by ferricyanide has a strong damping effect on these oscillations.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0006-3002			WOS:A1993MP93400004

For comparison purposes, ruthenium-iridium MMO (RuxIr1-xO2, x = 0.9 or 0.5) anodes were prepared by laser, as well as by conventional heating. The laser-prepared anodes were heated at a power density of 0.22 W/mm(2) with a dwell time of 13 min. This procedure was repeated 4 times achieving a mass density of 1.2 mg cm(-2), corresponding to a nominal thickness around 2-3 mu m. Using these conditions, the total laser-procedure 1 h, which is remarkably faster compared with conventional process using an electric furnace as this can last for several hours. The laser-prepared anodes presented electrochemical active surface area and stability 1.9 and 1.6 times, respectively, larger than those prepared by conventional heating. Furthermore, among the prepared anodes, the laser Ti/Ru0.9Ir0.1O2 showed the highest electrocatalytic activity while laser Ti/Ru0.5Ir0.5O2 was the most stable. Finally, this report opens up the opportunity to employ the laser energy as a potential heat source for the synthesis of high quality MMO anodes with modulated properties.									32	1	0	0	9	0	32			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000445416900042

Here, three macrocyclic Ni(II) amine complexes have been used for the electrochemical deposition of NiOx films from either a borate buffer solution (pH 9.2) or more basic conditions (pH = 12.9). The cyclic voltammetry of the complexes in both electrolytes shows very similar features and indicates the deposition of a catalytically active nickel oxide film. The NiOx films have been characterised using infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy complemented by scanning electron microscopy. Testing of the water oxidation activity at pH 9.2 and 12.9 showed that the films deposited from macrocyclic Ni(II) complexes exhibit similar catalytic activity to those derived from Ni2+ salts. The macrocyclic complexes offer the advantage of greater solubility and solution stability over a wider range of deposition conditions. At pH 9.2, the catalytic activity of the NiOx films was significantly higher when using a borate buffer and, in addition, the films were more active at pH 12.9 than at pH 9.2. The NiOx films deposited from molecular complexes were also found to show electrochromic properties. The oxidation of water by these films was enhanced by visible light. Water oxidation currents were observed to increase by similar to 20% under simulated solar radiation.									52	2	0	0	3	0	53			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000320268900010

A suitable support is usually desirable for SACs to prevent the aggregation of metal atoms and improve their dispersity, thereby enhancing their performance for electrochemical energy conversion. Graphynes (GYs), the rising stars of two-dimensional carbon allotropes with monolayer thickness, are composed of sp- and sp(2)-hybridized carbon atoms. The presence of sp-hybridized carbon atoms in GY networks endows them with unique structures and properties, such as well-distributed pores, high carrier mobility, excellent stability, a large specific surface area, and superior electrical conductivity. These unique structures and properties make GYs ideal supports for SACs. In this review, the feasibility of applying GYs as supports for SACs is analyzed with respect to the structure and properties. Then, various synthetic methods for GY-supported SACs are summarized. Moreover, the applications of GY-supported SACs for electrochemical energy conversion are summarized. Finally, the challenges and future research directions of GY-supported SACs for further development are highlighted. We believe that such a comprehensive summary not only provides a profound understanding of GY-supported SACs for electrochemical energy conversion, but also opens up promising channels for SAC design.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000754029000001

In this study, attention is focused on the development of ZnO-TiO2 nanocomposite photoanodes. The target systems are obtained by growing porous arrays of highly crystalline, elongated ZnO nanostructures on indium tin oxide (ITO) by chemical vapor deposition. Subsequently, the obtained nanodeposits are functionalized with TiO2 via radio frequency-sputtering for different process durations, and subjected to final annealing in air. Characterization results demonstrate the successful formation of high purity composite systems in which the surface of ZnO nanostructures is decorated by ultra-small amounts of amorphous titania, whose content can be conveniently tailored as a function of deposition time. Photocurrent density measurements in sunlight-triggered water splitting highlight a remarkable performance enhancement with respect to single-phase zinc and titanium oxides, with up to a threefold photocurrent increase compared to bare ZnO. These results, mainly traced back to the formation of ZnO/TiO2 heterojunctions yielding an improved photocarrier separation, show that the target nanocomposites are attractive photoanodes for efficient PEC water splitting.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			2366-7486			WOS:000486210400002

Cobalt-phosphate (Co-Pi) film fabricated by electrodeposition and Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) fabricated by photochemical reduction were decorated onto TNTAs to enhance the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance together. The photocurrent density of the TNTAs/Co-Pi/Pt photoelectrode could reach 0.185 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under UV lamp illumination (1 mW/cm(2)), which is 2.65 times compared to that of the pure TNTAs photoelectrode. Electrochemistry impedance spectroscopy and Mott-Schottky analysis were conducted to explore the reasons for the enhancement of the PEC performance. Pt NPs could promote the reduction of Co(IV)-oxo intermediate to Co(II) or Co(III) which facilitated the charge transfer in the PEC performance. The result provides a promising guideline to design a simple and efficient photoelectrode for the PEC water-splitting system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we developed a smart strategy to position MoS2 quantum dots (QDs) at the S vacancies on a Zn facet in monolayered ZnIn2S4 (Vs-M-ZnIn2S4) to craft a two-dimensional (2D) atomic-level heterostructure (MoS(2)QDs@Vs-M-ZnIn2S4). The electronic structure calculations indicated that the positive charge density of the Zn atom around the sulfur vacancy (Vs) was more intensive than other Zn atoms. The Vs confined in monolayered ZnIn2S4 established an important link between the electronic manipulation and activities of ZnIn2S4. The Vs acted as electron traps, prevented vertical transmission of electrons, and enriched electrons onto the Zn facet. The Vs induced atomic-level heterostructure sewed up vacancy structures of Vs-M-ZnIn2S4, resulting in a highly efficient interface with low edge contact resistance. Photogenerated electrons could quickly migrate to MoS(2)QDs through the intimate Zn-S bond interfaces. As a result, MoS(2)QDs@Vs-M-ZnIn2S4 showed a high PHR activity of 6.884 mmol g(-1) h(-1), which was 11 times higher than 0.623 mmol g(-1) h(-1) for bulk ZnIn2S4, and the apparent quantum efficiency reached as high as 63.87% (420 nm). This work provides a prototype material for looking into the role of vacancies between electronic structures and activities in 2D photocatalytic materials and gives insights into PHR systems at the atomic level.									321	20	0	0	32	0	321			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000423495200080	29261276

However, the fluid compositions and mechanisms of fluid migration at high temperatures in the crust are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated plagioclase alteration in mafic schists (clinopyroxene [Cpx] schist, hornblende [Hbl] schist, and actinolite [Act] schist) at the contact with a quartz diorite intrusion on Kinkasan Island, NE Japan. The quartz diorite consists of hornblende and plagioclase, and crystallized at 670-760 degrees C and 0.30-0.45 GPa. The quartz diorite contains abundant pegmatitic veins, which consist of plagioclase at their margins and K-feldspar + quartz +/- garnet in their centers. Some pegmatitic veins cut the schistosity of the metamorphic rocks. In the metamorphic rocks, two stages of fluid-mediated alteration during cooling were recognized. The first stage of fluid infiltration (Stage I) was characterized by the formation of a reaction zone around pegmatitic dikes in the Cpx schists. The Cpx was altered to hornblende (Hbl) and Caplagioclase (An(83-95)) was altered to Na-plagioclase (An(36-67)). The replacement proceeded along the grain boundaries of plagioclase and clinopyroxene. The second stage (Stage II) resulted in the formation of K-feldspar veins and replacement of plagioclase (An(35-57)) by K-feldspar (An(0)Ab(1)Or(99)) and albite (An(2)Ab(95)Or(3)-An(12)Ab(87)Or(1)) in the Act and Hbl schists, and the latter were probably derived from the Cpx schists. Assuming the pressure was the same as the crystallization of the quartz diorite intrusion, the alteration temperatures were estimated as 690-730 degrees C for Stage I and 400-570 degrees C for Stage II. Mass balance considerations with assumptions of the volume conservation during the replacements of plagioclase and clinopyroxene/amphibole grains indicate the Cpx schists gained Na and H2O and lost Ca in Stage I, and the Act schists gained K and Si and lost Al and Ca at almost constant Na in Stage II. This indicates that the fluid composition changed from Na- to K-rich during cooling. During the Stage II alteration, when similar to 45% of the plagioclase grains were altered, significant nano- to micro-scale pores were generated in plagioclase, which produced a porosity of similar to 3.0%-3.5% in the plagioclase and increased the whole-rock porosity by 1.3% +/- 0.2%. These pores are now isolated, irregularly shaped, and occur preferentially along the replacement front, suggesting that the pores migrated during or after replacement. The altered zone in plagioclase developed from trans-granular microcracks rather than grain boundaries. Our results suggest that infiltration of K-rich fluids could be self-promoting, with such fluids forming their own pathways via dissolution and precipitation processes during plagioclase replacement. Given that plagioclase is the dominant mineral in various rock types in the mid-crust, reaction-induced porosity networks in plagioclase could be the dominant fluid pathway at mid-crustal depths. The nature of this porosity and fluid migration are potentially controlled by temperature and/or the composition of the fluids. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Alkali can break hydrogen bonds, which accelerate thermal polymerization of urea and formation of nitrogen defects/cyano groups. The presence of nitrogen defects extends the absorption of visible light to longer wavelengths region. The cyano groups can trap g-C3N4's photoinduced electrons and therefore suppress charge recombination. The formation of porous structure increases the surface area and exposes more active sites. As a consequence, compared to pure g-C3N4, NC-g-C3N4 shows boosted visible photocatalytic nitrogen fixation activity (1.59 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) without co-catalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The structures of carbonig-C3N4 composites were characterized by infrared spectra (IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV vis DRS), photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The newly prepared composites showed much higher surface area and better performance for the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) than that of pristine g-C3N4 (CN) under visible light irradiation. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity might be ascribed to the introduction of residual carbon derived from incompletely in situ pyrolysis of formaldehyde-modified dicyandiamide, which was beneficial to the appropriate adjustment of CN band gap and the efficient transfer and separation of photo-excited carriers. The possible photo-catalyitc degradation mechanism of the as-prepared composites under visible light irradiation for MB was also elucidated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The growth mechanism of this unique hybrid structure can be attributed to the double effects of plasma pretreatment and the microstructure of MCCs. Periodical assembly of vertically aligned CNTs and Fe3C nanoparticles leads to a superhydrophobic surface, superior magnetic performance and high activity in photocatalytic degradation toward methyl orange (MO). The enhancement of photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes at the interface of CNT and Fe3C. The proposedmethod provides a new way for the fabrication of three-dimensional CNT-inorganic hybrid nanostructures, which can find attractive applications in catalysis and electrocatalysis.

Authigenic carbonate cements, (micro) nodules, bioturbation casts and tubes from 12 core locations drilled during the Indian National Gas Hydrate Program (NGHP) Expedition 01 were investigated for this study. Three main processes responsible for authigenic carbonate precipitation are identified: organoclastic sulfate reduction, anaerobic oxidation of methane and methanogenesis. Evidence of vigorous methane seepage is indicated in carbonates recovered at Sites 7, 10, 12 (KG Basin) and 19 (Mahanadi Basin). These methane-derived carbonates display typical paragenetic carbonate mineralogies (aragonite, high-Mg calcite with >15 Mol% MgCO3, Ca-rich dolomite). Two separate horizons of methane derived-carbonates are correlated between 4 drill holes (up to similar to 16 km apart). The upper horizon has been dated with C-14 (40,100-51,600 a BP 1950) and clearly indicates that methane seepage has been much more vigorous in the past, possibly due to the effect of lower sea level on the gas hydrate stability zone across the margin.

Here, we report a novel BixFe1-xVO4 mixture system fabricated by electrospinning, which upon annealing is composed of triclinic FeVO4 and monoclinic BiVO4 phases. The mixture demonstrates extended optical absorption and a clear bandgap shift as compared with a pure BiVO4. This is also accompanied by an extended wavelength range for its photoactivity as evident from the incident photon-to-current efficiency. In addition, the mixture with a Bi/(Bi + Fe) ratio of 0.5 (i.e., x = 0.5) shows superior charge transfer and charge separation efficiency. The improved charge transfer efficiency is attributed to the higher catalytic activity of the mixed cation, while the presence of a BiVO4/FeVO4 heterojunction enhances the charge separation. The formation of the heterojunction is verified through detailed microscopic investigations revealing BiVO4 particles intimately surrounded by FeVO4. Our results demonstrate the advantage of establishing a mixture of complex metal oxides in extending optical absorption and boosting the photoelectrochemical performance.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000474712700042

Here, size-selected 27-atom cobalt clusters (Co-27) deposited on hematite (Fe2O3) anodes were tested for water oxidation activity. The uniformity of these anodes allows measurement of the activity of catalytic sites of well-defined nuclearity and known density. Grazing incidence X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (GIXANES) characterization of the anodes before and after electrochemical cycling demonstrates that these Co-27 clusters are stable to dissolution even in the harsh water oxidation electrochemical environment. They are also stable under illumination at the equivalent of 0.4suns irradiation. The clusters show turnover rates for water oxidation that are comparable or higher than those reported for Pd- and Co-based materials or for hematite. The support for the Co-27 clusters is Fe2O3 grown by atomic layer deposition on a Si chip. We have chosen to deposit a Fe2O3 layer that is only a few unit cells thick (2nm), to remove complications related to exciton diffusion. We find that the electrocatalytic and the photoelectrocatalytic activity of the Co-27/Fe2O3 material is significantly improved when the samples are annealed (with the clusters already deposited). Given that the support is thin and that the cluster deposition density is equivalent to approximately 5% of an atomic monolayer, we suggest that annealing may significantly improve the exciton diffusion from the support to the catalytic moiety.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000386953500016	27717160

In this work, CuMnO2 nanostructures were prepared via a facile hydrothermal method at 90 degrees C for 4 h. The prepared CuMnO2 nanostructures were fully characterized, confirming their delafossite structures with a nanoparticle size of about 10-30 nm and a band gap of 1.55 eV. The as-prepared CuMnO2 nanostructures were firstly applied on NaNO2 sensing by differential normal pulse voltammetry (DNPV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). Because CuMnO2 has smaller particle sizes and band gap, more catalytic centers were exposed and higher catalytic activity was expected. CuMnO2 showed a favorable and efficient electrocatalytic effect with a detection limit of 0.28 mu M. The pH variation indicated that the oxidation of NaNO2 on CuMnO2 modified electrodes prefers a weak alkaline environment. Due to its rigid crystal structure, CuMnO2 exhibited long-term stability with the oxidation peak current retention is 96.1% over 20 days.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000722312500012

However, it is extremely challenging to find proper new materials and doping/defect engineering conditions relying only on experimental trial-and-error. In this study, use of vanadium disulfide (VS2) was suggested as an effective cathode catalyst for Li-air batteries (LABs), under the condition of proper doping engineering to optimize electrochemical performances. To investigate the dopant screening and doping processing optimization of VS2, a theoretical concept, which combines first-principles calculations and thermodynamic modeling, was first derived and suggested. Through our approach, it is worth noting that F- and N-doping on H-VS2 shows superior overpotential properties (0.68 V and 0.76 V) than the carbon-based cathode and NH3 and O-2 as reactant for T-VS2, and N-2 and H-2 for H-VS2 are necessary to control the N doping on VS2. Our theoretical work provides the guideline for application of VS2 to cathode of LABs and leads to further insights for designing a new cathode materials based on two-dimensional materials.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000516818700126

Nitritation was established with nitrite accumulation ratios above 85%. Quantitative PCR indicated that Nitrospira was dominant nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and Nitrobacter was few. During nitritation achieving, Nitrobacter was firstly eliminated, along with inhibition of Nitrospira bioactivities, then Nitrospira percentage declined and was finally washed out. Nitritation establishment depended on inhibiting and eliminating of NOB rather than ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) enriching. This is the first study where population dynamics of Nitrobacter and Nitrospira were investigated to reveal mechanism of nitritation in a continuous-flow process. Phylogenetic analysis of AOB indicated that Nitrosomonas-like cluster and Nitrosomonas oligotropha were dominant AOB, accounting for 81.6% of amoA gene clone library. Community structure of AOB was similar to that of complete nitrification system with long hydraulic retention time, but different from that of nitritation reactor with low DO concentration.

As the Zr content increases, the first hydriding reaction is completed in a shorter rime, but the plateau pressure is sloped and decreases. At a composition of x = 0.05, a maximum hydrogen storage capacity is obtained with a enhanced activation property. Upon pressure cycling of the MmNi(4.5)Al(0.5)Zr(0.5) alloy, the hydrogen storage capacity is decreased by only 8% after 4300 cycles. From the X-ray diffraction, SEM and EDX tests, new second phases are observed at high Zr content above x = 0.1. The major second phase is confirmed to be the ZrNi3 phase. It is considered that the improved activation properties of the MmNi(4.5)Al(0.5)Zr(x) alloys are caused by the strong catalytic effect of ZrNi, on the dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen molecule. Among the investigated alloy systems, it is suggested that the most suitable alloy is the MmNi(4.5)Al(0.5)Zr(0.05) as a new hydrogen storage material due to its the large hydrogen storage capacity, the improved activation behavior and the strong resistance to the degradation in the subsequent cyclic operation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	6			0360-3199			WOS:A1994PH19300005

The following results have been obtained: (i) In the washed membranes, O2 centers could maintain the S2 state more than 3 h in darkness at room temperature. This dark-stable S2 was modified as seen by a multiline EPR signal with reduced hyperfine line spacing and also by a thermoluminescence band with upshifted peak temperature. (ii) This modified S2 state had an abnormally long life of t1/2 = 7 h at 20-degrees-C, and its appearance required the presence of EDTA in the medium. On addition of exogenous Ca2+, the modified S2 was converted in darkness to normal S2, and then decayed rapidly to be undetectable. (iii) On illuminating this modified S2, an EPR signal centering at aroung g = 2 was newly induced at no expense of the dark-stable EPR multiline signal. This EPR signal was accompanied by a new thermoluminescence band peaking at around 5-degrees-C, suggesting the presence of a new redox component whose oxidized form is capable of providing a positive charge for thermoluminescence in place of Mn. (iv) This new component was efficiently oxidized by illumination at -5-degrees-C but much less at -60-degrees-C, showing a half-inhibition temperature at around -40-degrees-C. (v) Addition of various divalent cations in place of Ca2+ variously affected both thermoluminescence glow peaks arising from the dark-stable S2 or from the new redox component, suggesting a cation-species-dependent modulation of the redox properties of both components. (vi) Both of these two thermoluminescence bands showed no dependency on flash number, suggesting interruption of further oxidation beyond their respective abnormal states. On addition of Ca2+, all these abnormal properties were abolished and normal period-four flash pattern was restored. These abnormal properties of the redox events in NaCl/EDTA-washed PS II membranes were discussed in relation to the demand for exogenous Ca2+ in recovery of normal properties.									87	0	3	0	78	0	91			0006-3002			WOS:A1990EP09500007

Herein, we report a hetero-structured Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4/CeO2/NF (NNO/CeO2/NF) electrode, exhibiting superior performance owning to the NO3-anion substitution for the OH-in nickel hydroxide to form Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4, together with its interface synergy with ceria. In alkaline solution, the NNO/CeO2/NF electrocatalyst could catalyze the OER with an over -potential of 330 mV to approach 50 mA cm-2. Also, it needs only an overpotential of 120 mV to reach 10 mA cm-2 for HER. Additionally, when a standard two-electrode water elec-trolyzer is fabricated by employing NNO/CeO2/NF as both the cathode and anode, it can generate 10 mA cm-2 at 1.64 V and operate steadily without performance degradation after 25 h. This research provides a novel perspective for reasonable design of advanced catalytic materials with improvements in the field of electrocatalysis. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Morrongiello, John/E-8716-2011	Morrongiello, John/0000-0002-9608-4151			A statistical framework to explore ontogenetic growth variation among individuals and populations: a marine fish example								ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS				85	1			93	115		10.1890/13-2355.1				FEB 2015	2015	Growth is a fundamental biological process, driven by a multitude of intrinsic (within-individual) and extrinsic (environmental) factors, that underpins individual fitness and population demographics. Focusing on the comprehensive information stored in aquatic and terrestrial organismhard parts, we develop a series of increasingly complex hierarchical models to explore spatial and temporal sources of growth variation, ranging in resolution from within individuals to across a species. We apply this modeling framework to an extensive data set of otolith increment measurements from tiger flathead (Platycephalus richardsoni), a demersal commercially exploited fish that inhabits the warming waters of southeast Australia. We recreated growth histories (biochronology) up to four decades in length from seven fishing areas spanning this species' range. The dominant pattern in annual growth was an age-dependent, allometric decline that varied among individuals, sexes, fishing areas, years, and cohorts. We found evidence for among-area differences in growth-rate selectivity, whereby younger fish at capture were generally faster growers. Temporal growth variation was partitioned into two main sources: extrinsic year to year annual fluctuations in environmental conditions and persistent cohort-specific growth differences, reflecting density dependence and/or juvenile experience. Despite low levels of among-individual growth synchrony within areas, we detected a regionally coherent signal of increasing average growth rate through time, a trend related to oceanic warming. At the southerly (poleward) range limit, growth was only weakly related to temperature, but farther north in warmer waters this relationship strengthened until closer to the species' equatorward range limit, growth declined with increasing temperatures. We partitioned these species-wide and area-specific phenotypic responses into within-and among-individual components using a reaction norm approach. Individual tiger flathead likely possess sufficient growth plasticity to successfully adapt to warming waters acrossmuch of their range, but increased future warming in the north will continue to depress growth, affecting individual fitness and even population persistence. Our modeling framework is directly applicable to other long-term, individual-based, data sets such as those derived from tree rings, corals, and tag-recapture studies, and provides an unprecedented level of resolution into the drivers of growth variation and the ecological and evolutionary implications of environmental and climatic change.									98	0	0	0	93	0	98			0012-9615	1557-7015		WOS:000349389800006

The negative strain energy indicates that the SWCNNTs have a stable structure, while the most stable combination in the DWCNNT is (6, 0)@(12, 0). The energy band gaps of (n, 0) SWCNNTs increase while that of (n, n) SWCNNTs decrease as the diameter increase. Moreover, the calculated nanotubes have the ability of photocatalytic water splitting, and the valance band maximum of nanotubes are much lower than that of the monolayer, indicating that the nanotubes have better oxidation capacity than the monolayer. On the other hand, our calculations show that DWCNNTs have type II band alignment with a band gap width significantly smaller than that of SWCNNTs. Interestingly, DWCNNT exhibited a smaller effective mass of electrons than SWCNNTs, which is beneficial to electron migration. Therefore, the construction of nanotube is an effective way to improve the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 monolayer materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000773097400001	35272280

This type of NiO samples presents mesoscopic morphology. The latter characteristic combined to the intrinsic electroacdvity of the oxide leads to the observation of proportionality between NiO thickness and current density. In particular, NiO undergoes two distinct processes of oxidation with reversible features in aqueous media. These redox processes occur in the solid state and, as such, involve mass/charge transfer between the NiO electrode and the electrolyte. On the other hand, the electrochemical oxidation of NiO is accompanied by the progressive chemical dissolution of the oxide when the latter is in the oxidized state. This is a consequence of the elevated content of stored charge on NiO surface when it interfaces a high polarity solvent like water. In the present work we have considered electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for the investigation of the charge transfer/transport properties of NiO during the simultaneous occurrence of chemical and electrochemical processes. The study proposes models of electrical circuits for analyzing the interfacial phenomena involved in the aqueous oxidation of NiO.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000431156900026

Moreover, several haematological variables and the organ composition of haemolymphopoietic sites may vary according to sex or season. The aim of this study was to establish the haematological parameters and the cellular composition of haemolymphopoietic organs in Odontesthes bonariensis, a commercially valuable fish species in Argentina, and also to determine gender or seasonal variations. Haematocrit exhibited the highest value in summer, while haemoglobin concentration was greater in summer and autumn. Erythrocyte count was higher in spring than autumn and winter, but did not differ with summer. The increase in these variables in seasons with higher water temperatures might be a compensatory mechanism to compensate the lower level of oxygen in the environment. Leucocyte formula and blast haemolymphopoietic cells in spleen and head kidney also showed annual variations since cells related to specific immune response, i.e., lymphocytes and thrombocytes, decrease in winter, whereas cells of the non-specific immune pathways, such as granulocyte, rise. The elevation of a particular type of circulating leucocyte was preceded by an increase in values of its precursor in blood in the previous season. Both, spleen and head kidney were active in haemolymphopoiesis, although with some differences in their activity during different seasons. Males showed higher values of circulating lymphoblasts and granulocytes than females, whereas females exhibited higher values of thrombocytes. This study corroborates the high interspecific variations in haematological parameters in fish that underlines the needing of basic studies in order to assess fish health status in new promising species for aquaculture.									2	0	0	0	3	1	3			0920-1742	1573-5168		WOS:000332798300009	23982334

Herein, we report a new approach to engineering the coordination environment of M-N-C (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) SACs by using glutamic add as the N/C source and pyrolysis atmosphere as a regulator. Compared with that in N-2, NH3 was able to promote the doping of N at T< 700 degrees C yet etch the N-species at higher temperatures, by which the M-N coordination number (CN) and the electronic structure were delicately tuned. It was found that the electron density of Ni single atoms increased with the decrease of Ni-N CN. As a consequence, the capability of Ni-N-C to dissociate H-2 was greatly enhanced and a higher catalytic activity in chemoselective hydrogenation of functionalized nitroarenes was achieved. Moreover, this modulation method could be applied to other transition metals including Fe and Co. In particular, the as-synthesized Co-N-C SAC afforded a turnover frequency of 152.3 h(-1 )with 99% selectivity to 3-vinylaniline in the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene, which was the highest ever reported thus far and was at least one order of magnitude more active than state-of-the-art noble-metal-free M-N-C catalysts, demonstrating the great potential of engineering the coordination environment of SACs.									25	1	0	0	2	0	25			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000660374800002

However, the application of this technology is inevitably hindered by low energy conversion efficiency, low selectivity, and the use of sacrificial agents. In this work, we developed a novel flower-like La doped BiOBr nanosheets, and as-prepared catalyst exhibited excellent photocatalytic CO2 conversion of 22.77 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) and CH3OH selectivity of 92.41%. The influence of doped La and catalytic mechanism were further investigated, and the results revealed that the introduction of La species extended the photoresponse range of BiOBr photocatalyst and reduced the photoelectron-hole recombination rate, thus improving the photoactivity of pure BiOBr. This work brings a guidance for designing new high performance photocatalysts in future.									27	1	0	0	5	0	28			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000660303800002

This Review highlights the synthetic strategies for generating Ru nanocrystals with different crystal phases and surface structures, and outlines their implementation in catalytic applications.Metal nanocrystals with controlled shapes or surface structures have received increasing attention, owing to their desirable properties for applications ranging from catalysis to photonics, energy and biomedicine. Most studies, however, have been limited to nanocrystals with the same crystal phase as the bulk material. Engineering the phase of metal nanocrystals while simultaneously attaining shape-controlled synthesis has recently emerged as a new frontier of research. Here, we use Ru as an example to evaluate recent progress in the synthesis of metal nanocrystals featuring different crystal phases and well-controlled shapes. We first discuss synthetic strategies for controlling the crystal phase and shape of Ru nanocrystals, with a focus on new mechanistic insights. We then highlight the major factors that affect the packing of Ru atoms and, thus, the crystal phase, followed by an examination of the thermal stability of Ru nanocrystals in terms of both crystal phase and shape. Next, we showcase the successful implementation of these Ru nanocrystals in various catalytic applications. Finally, we end with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities in the field, including leveraging the lessons learned from Ru to engineer the crystal phase and surface structure of other metals.									66	5	0	0	4	0	66			2058-8437			WOS:000520396600002

This was the first highly time-resolved, real-time measurement study of springtime aerosol in SMA and the results reveal valuable insights into the sources and atmospheric processes that contribute to PM pollution in this region.The average concentration of submicrometer aerosol (PM1 = NR-PM1 + black carbon (BC)) was 22.1 mu gm(-3), which was composed of 44% organics, 20% sulfate, 17% nitrate, 12% ammonium, and 7% BC. Organics had an average atomic oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratio of 0.49 and an average organic mass-to-carbon (OM/OC) ratio of 1.82. Four distinct sources of OA were identified via positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of the HR-ToF-AMS data: vehicle emissions represented by a hydrocarbon-like OA factor (HOA; O/C = 0.15; 17% of OA mass), food cooking activities represented by a cooking-influenced OA factor (COA; O/C = 0.19; 22% of OA mass), and secondary organic aerool (SO Lambda) represented by a semi-volatile oxygenated OA factor (SV-OOA; O/C = 0.44; 27% of OA mass) and a low-volatility oxygenated OA factor (SV-OOA; O = C D 0.44; 27% of OA mass) and a low-volatility oxygenated OA factor (LV-OOA; O = C D 0.91; 34% of OA mass).Our results indicate that air quality in SMA during KORUS-AQ was influenced strongly by secondary aerosol formation, with sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, SV-OOA, and LV-OOA together accounting for 76% of the PM1 mass. In particular, the formation of LV-OOA and sulfate was mainly promoted by elevated ozone concentrations and photochemical reactions during daytime, whereas SV-OOA and nitrate formation was contributed by both nocturnal processing of VOC and nitrogen oxides, respectively, and daytime photochemical reactions. In addition, lower nighttime temperature promoted gas-to-particle partitioning of semivolatile species and formation of SV-OOA and nitrate. During a period of 4 days (from 20 to 23 May), LV-OOA increased dramatically and accounted for up to 41% of the PM1 mass. This intense LV-OOA formation event was associated with large enhancements of both anthropogenic and biogenic VOCs (e.g., isoprene and toluene), high concentration of O-x (= O-3 + NO2), strong solar radiation, and stagnant conditions, suggesting that it was mainly driven by local photochemical formation. We have also investigated the formation and evolution mechanisms of severe haze episodes. Unlike the winter haze events which were mainly caused by intense local emissions coupled with stagnant meteorological conditions, the spring haze events appeared to be influenced by both regional and local factors. For example, there were episodes of long-range transport of plumes followed by calm meteorology conditions, which promoted the formation and accumulation of local secondary species, leading to high concentrations of PM. Overall, our results indicate that PM pollutants in urban Korea originate from complex emission sources and atmospheric processes and that the concentrations and composition of PM are controlled by various factors, including meteorological conditions, local anthropogenic emissions, and upwind sources.									71	0	0	0	27	0	71			1680-7316	1680-7324		WOS:000432998200003

If hybridized with property-complementary nanomaterials, such as nanocarbon, CNTs, graphene, metal oxides/sulfides and conductive polymers, their electrochemical properties can be further enhanced in terms of specific reversible capacity/capacitance, rate capability, cycling stability, and catalytic activity. In this review, we first give a comprehensive overview on recent progress in both monolithic cobalt oxide nanostructures and their hybrid nanomaterials for batteries, supercapacitors, and electrocatalysis applications. Then, structure-property relationships of the cobalt oxide-based nano materials and current challenges in both nanoarchitectures design and their applications in electrochemical energy devices are proposed, and an outlook on future research of this family of materials in electrochemical energy applications are brought forward. This understanding on the relationships of synthesis-nano/microstructure-property-performance of cobalt oxide-based nanomaterials is expected to lay a good foundation for pushing this promising class of materials to the practical application in energy conversion and storage devices and to provide a good reference for the readers in the fields of materials, chemistry, sustainable energy, and nano technology.									117	4	0	0	3	0	117			0079-6425	1873-2208		WOS:000467000300012

In this study, a crystalline cobalt borophosphate (CoBP) was synthesized by reacting CoCl2.6H(2)O with B2O3 and (NH4)(2)HPO4 and evaluated as an electrocatalyst for water oxidation catalysis. The electrochemical and electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst towards water oxidation has been investigated by catalyst coating on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode in different pH solution. Cyclic voltammetric and chronoamperometric studies were performed for the investigation of pH effect on the catalytic activity. Post-catalytic studies indicate that CoBP acts as a pre-catalyst yielding an active phase during the course of electrolysis in the alkaline conditions. The catalyst demonstrated catalytic activity at pH 13.6 with onset potential of 1.46 V (vs. RHE) and Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1). Electrochemical studies show that catalyst exhibits a current densities of 1 and 10 mA cm(-2) at 384 and 441 mV. The catalyst showed a turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.1x10(-2) s(-1) at overpotential of 300 mV.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000475465600022

The structural properties of anthracite play a decisive role in its materialization, while with chemical oxidation, anthracite structure can be purposefully improved. The anthracite oxide was prepared via acid leaching and oxidizing, using high carbon content and low ash content anthracite from Zhaotong, Yunnan Province, China. The structural and spectroscopy characteristics of anthracite and anthracite oxide were acquired with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-F1a). The results show that crystallites in anthracite have intermediate structures between graphite and amorphous. Compared with bitumite and lignite, its structure order degree lies between graphite and low metamorphic coals with relatively high average diameter of coal crystallites(L-a) and average height of coal crystallites (L-c). The process of anthracite oxidation can be modeled in two steps, the edge of crystal was curled and destroyed with strong oxidation, with the generation of C=O group and intercalation of HNO3/H2SO4 into the edge layers, leading to the reducing of lateral sizes; HNO3 /H2SO4 were continually intercalated into crystals, resulted in the increase of interlayer spacing (d((002))) from 0. 351 to 0. 361 nm, and the number of stacked layers dropped to 4. 5 from 6 due to exfoliate. I-D1/I-G in Raman spectroscopy increased from 1. 9 to 2. 0, with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of G bond and intensity of D-2 bond increasing from 63 to 68 and 10.26 to 13. 78. Numbers of new C-O, CO, NO2 groups generated, leading to the decrease of oxygen-containing functional groups content from 0. 11 to 0. 42. After HNO3 /H2SO4 oxidation, the aromaticity (f(a)) of anthracite oxide increases, with the decrease of structure order degree and more-over a lot of active reaction sites generates in the process. The oxidation of anthracite enables anthracite has great potential in the application of porous carbon preparation.									2	3	0	0	0	0	4			1000-0593			WOS:000388251100045	30226691

The activities of hydrogen generation from decomposition of water and the organic pollutants degradation have been evaluated under visible-light irradiation. The Z scheme system can catalyze the hydrogen generation from water splitting and organic pollutants degradation simultaneously under visible light. The presence of organic pollutants can promote the hydrogen generation from water splitting. The activity of hydrogen production is related to the reduction properties of the organic compounds and the highest hydrogen production efficiency obtained in the presence of formaldehyde. The hydrogen production rate, formaldehyde degradation rate, the A.Q.Y. and the eta(c) are determined to be 1687 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), 22.2 mmol g(-1) h(-1), 22.9% and 13.3% when the formaldehyde concentration is 5 mol L-1, the concentration of the catalyst is 1.5 g L-1, the initial pH of solution is 13. When mixed organic pollutants are added, the system can also have a good activity for hydrogen production and organic pollutants degradation. Furthermore, the mechanism of the Z scheme system ZnIn2S4/RGO/BiVO4 for hydrogen generation and simultaneous degradation of organic pollutants has been also discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In 1, the central Mn-III ion is linked to the NNOO donor atoms of the potentially binucleating precursor L2- and additionally coordinates one water molecule and the pseudohalide SCN-, thus yielding a distorted octahedral geometry. The UV-Vis spectra of 1 shows an intense band corresponding to a T-5(2g) - E-5(g) transition at 545 nm; thus presuming the octahedral geometry around the Mn ion. The solid and solution EPR spectra of 1 have been simulated with an HP 53150A microwave frequency counter which has confirmed the +3 oxidation state of the metal ion. We have also conducted a DFT computational study which has confirmed that compound 1 self assembles into a two-dimensional network via O-H center dot center dot center dot O, pi-pi, and unconventional C-H center dot center dot center dot pi(SCN) interactions involving the pi-system of the thiocyanate.

NADPH oxidases (NOXs) and six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate enzymes (STEAPs) are iconic members of the superfamily. NOXs produce extracellular reactive oxygen species that exert potent bactericidal activities and trigger redox-signaling cascades that regulate cell division and differentiation. STEAPs catalyze the reduction of extracellular iron and copper which is necessary for the bioavailability of these essential elements. Both NOXs and STEAPs are present as multiple isozymes with distinct regulatory properties and physiological roles. Despite the important roles of NOXs and STEAPs in human physiology and despite their wide involvement in diseases like cancer, their mode of action at the molecular level remained incompletely understood for a long time, in part due to the absence of high-resolution models of the complete enzymes. Our two laboratories have elucidated the three-dimensional structures of NOXs and STEAPs, providing key insight into their mechanisms and evolution. The enzymes share a conserved transmembrane helical domain with an eye-catching hourglass shape. On the extracellular side, a heme prosthetic group is at the bottom of a pocket where the substrate (O-2 in NOX, chelated iron or copper in STEAP) is reduced. On the intracellular side, the inner heme of NOX and the FAD of STEAP are bound to topological equivalent sites. This is a rare case where critical amino acid substitutions and local conformational changes enable a cofactor (heme vs FAD) swap between two structurally and functionally conserved scaffolds. The catalytic core of these enzymes is completed by distinct cytosolic NADPH-binding domains that are topologically unrelated (a ferredoxin reductase-like flavoprotein domain in NOX and a F420H2:NADP(+)-like domain in STEAP), feature different quaternary structures, and underlie specific regulatory mechanisms. Despite their differences, these domains all establish electron-transfer chains that direct the electrons from NADPH to the transmembrane domain. The multistep nature of the process and the chemical nature of the products pose considerable problems in the enzymatic assays. We learned that great care must be exerted in the validation of a candidate inhibitor. Multiple orthogonal assays are required to rule out off-target effects such as ROS-scavenging activities or nonspecific interference with the enzyme redox chain. The structural analysis of STEAP/NOX enzymes led us to further notice that their transmembrane heme-binding topology is shared by other enzymes. We found that the core domain of the cytochrome b subunits of the mitochondrial complex III and photosynthetic cytochrome b6f are closely related to NOXs and STEAPs and likely arose from the same ancestor protein. This observation expands the substrate portfolio of the superfamily since cytochromes b act on ubiquinone. The rigidly packed helices of the NOX/STEAP/cytochrome b domain contrast with the more malleable membrane proteins like ion channels or amino-acid transporters, which undergo large conformational changes to allow passage of relatively large metabolites. This notion of a rigid hourglass scaffold found an unexpected confirmation in the observation, revealed by structural comparisons, that an helical bundle identical to the NOX/STEAP/cytochrome b enzymes is featured by a de novo designed heme-binding protein, PS1.Apparently, nature and protein designers have independently converged to this fold as a versatile scaffold for heme-mediated reactions. The challenge is now to uncover the molecular mechanisms that implement the isozyme-specific regulation of the enzyme functions and develop much needed inhibitors and modulators for chemical biology and drug design studies.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000572833000024	32815713

Top-down dealloying has been demonstrated to be one of the most effective ways to fabricate 3D porous materials. Vapor phase dealloying, which makes use of the saturated vapor pressure difference between the constituent components in an alloy for selectively removing a less stable element or phase, is a promising versatile method for fabricating porous materials from active metals to inorganic elements. Here, using nickel-zinc and germanium-zinc alloys as the prototypes of single-phase and two-phase precursors, respectively, we report the fabrication of 3D bicontinuous porous Ni and Ge by vapor phase dealloying on the basis of selective element or selective phase evaporations. We also show the incorporation of vapor phase dealloying with chemical vapor deposition for the one-pot growth of 3D nanoporous graphene and the functional applications of vapor phase dealloyed porous Ge as Li ion battery electrodes. This study shines lights on the versatility of vapor phase dealloying for the fabrication of bicontinuous porous materials for a wide range of functional applications. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.

Included in the simulation are all relevant microscopic transitions, including the formation of Pt-OH and Pt-O from Pt, surface diffusion of all three species, as well as an effective place exchange diffusion at high potential. A detailed description of this approach to modeling such a complex surface is also presented. Overall, it is found that many features of the Pt(111) CV, including hydroxylation, hysteresis, and surface roughening, can be correlated to events associated with n-coordinated surface species, such as the hydroxylation wave corresponding to a one-electron oxidation of 9-coordinated terrace sites. Oxidation to Pt-O species at potentials above 1.0 V are shown to correlate to the presence of growing surface roughness, and the simulations suggest the onset of Pt-O formation in steady-state cyclic voltammetry is dominated by the oxidation of 8-coordinated step edges rather than terrace sites. Implications for the stability of Pt(111) catalysts after thousands of voltammetric cycles are discussed. (C) The Author(s) 2019.

The characterisation of the substrate range of this enzyme was hampered by low levels of production using E. coli. The yield and purity of the Krac9555 enzyme was improved using a codon optimised gene, the introduction of a tag and modification of the purification protocol. The heme domain was isolated and in vitro analysis of substrate binding and turnover was performed. Krac9955 was found to preferentially bind alkyl- and alkyloxy-benzoic acids (>= 95% high spin, K-d < 3 mu M) over saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Unusually for a self-sufficient CYP102 family member Krac9955 showed low levels of NAD(P)H oxidation activity for all the substrates tested though product formation was observed for many. For nearly all substrates the preferred site of hydroxylation of Krac9955 was eight carbons away from the carboxylate group with certain reactions proceeding at >= 90% selectivity. Krac9955 differs from CYP102A1 (P450Bm3), and is the first self-sufficient member of the CYP102 family of P450 enzymes which is not optimised for fast fatty acid hydroxylation close to the omega-terminus.

Herein, use of large amplitude Fourier transformed ac voltammetry and comprehensive analysis of the higher harmonics has enabled us to access the redox processes responsible for catalysis. An examination of the voltammetric data for water oxidation in borate buffered solutions (pH 9.2) at electrodes functionalized with systematically varied low loadings of cobalt (CoOx), manganese (MnOx), and nickel oxides (NiOx) has been undertaken, and extensive experiment-simulation comparisons have been introduced for the first time. Analysis shows that a single redox process controls the rate of catalysis for Co and Mn oxides, while two electron transfer events contribute in the Ni case. We apply a "molecular catalysis" model that couples a redox transformation of a surface-confined species (effective reversible potential, E-eff(0)) to a catalytic reaction with a substrate in solution (pseudo-first-order rate constant, k(1)(f)), accounts for the important role of a Bronsted base, and mimics the experimental behavior. The analysis revealed that E-eff(0) values for CoOx, MnOx, ;and NiOx lie within the range 1.9-2.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, and k(1)(f) varies from 2 x 10(3) to 4 x 10(4) s(-1). The k(1)(f) values are much higher than reported for any water electrooxidation catalyst before. The E-eff(0) values provide a guide for in situ spectroscopic characterization of the active states involved in catalysis by metal oxides.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			0002-7863			WOS:000389962800048	27960304

When this occurs, the electrons at the anode catalyst layer (ACL) must be generated by either water oxidation or carbon corrosion which forces the cell into a 'reversal' event. Such events rapidly degrade the anode catalyst layer, but can be mitigated through the use of reversal tolerant catalysts (RTCs) such as IrOx. While widely used in industry, this topic has not received significant attention in the literature. At the membrane electrode assembly (MEA)-level, there are two main approaches to evaluate reversal tolerance: 1) Galvanostatic and 2) Pulsing. In galvanostatic accelerated stress tests (ASTs), the current is held at a constant value until the cell voltage reaches a predetermined value. For pulsing ASTs, the MEA is put through short term 'reversal' conditions before going back to normal operating mode. These ASTs are in fact quite different in terms of the stress they put on the ACL. Here, we directly compare these two ASTs, showing that, when normalized for the same amount of total reversal time, the pulsing experiments result in more severe anode damage than galvanostatic testing.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000656869800003

In particular, PEMFCs are considered to be the ideal clean energy techniques for automobiles due to their high energy density and environment-friendly. Through continuous efforts from both academy and industry for decades, spring in the commercialization of PEMFCs is now coming marked by the first mass-produced hydrogen fuel cell car released by Toyota in 2014. Still, one of the most challenging tasks towards the commercialization of PEMFCs is to develop highly active, stable and low cost electrocatalysts for the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode, for which Pt is the best pure metal catalyst yet expensive for large scale applications. Alloying of Pt with non-noble 3D transition metal M (M=Fe, Co, Ni, etc.) are known to improve the ORR catalytic activity, while recent breakthrough results further demonstrat that certain Pt alloy facets particularly Pt_3Ni {111} surface processes the potential to greatly increase the ORR activity by 90-fold compared to the state-of-the-art commercial Pt catalyst. Inspired by the exceptional ORR activity reported on the extended Pt-skin {111} surface, numerus studies have been devoted to the synthesis of shaped Pt alloy nanocrystals with {111}-oriented surfaces, e.g., nanooctahedra enclosed by six {111} surfaces. These particles are perceived to be the realistic dream-ORR-catalyst and are expected to bring in the 90-fold enhancement over the commercial Pt catalysts. Significant progress in the synthesis of shaped-controlled platinum alloy nanocrystals has been made in recent years, resulting in several families of highly active shaped Pt alloy electrocatalysts including nanooctahedra, icosahedra, nanoframe and nanocage catalysts. Meanwhile, their ORR activity improvements over commercial Pt catalyst have also increased greatly from 3-4 fold reported in 2010 to more than 30-fold reported recently. Despite these progresses, the long-term stability of the shaped Pt alloy nanocrystals particularly under realistic fuel cell condition is still the most challenging issue. In this review, we summarize recent progresses in the morphology control, catalytic activity and durability of shaped Pt-alloy nanocrystals for application in ORR electrocatlaysts in PEMFCs. We first introduce the syntheses of shaped Pt alloy nanocrystals such as octahedra, icosahedra, nanoframes and nanocages and their ORR activity improvement over commercial Pt catalyst. We then review recent efforts on a deeper understanding of the relationship among the element-specific growth, structure and catalytic stability of shaped Pt alloy catalysts. Emphasis will be placed on atomic insights into the structural evolutions of shaped Pt nanocrystals across their full life cycle (from growth to application in electrocatalysis) gained by advanced high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Finally, we summarize several approaches reported recently to improve the catalytic stability of the shaped Pt alloy nanocrystals, for instance, by rational design of tri-metallic shaped alloy nanocrystals and new nanostructures. These results are helpful for designing next-generation shaped Pt alloy nanocatalysts with both high activity and high durability in realistic PEFMCs and may also provide useful insights into metal alloy nanocatalysts for other catalytic reactions.			具有可控形貌的铂合金纳米晶,尤其是表面由(111)面构成的纳米八面体或二十面体等,被认为是一种理想的高催化活性燃料电池电极催化剂,其重要的应用价值吸引了国际上许多研究组的兴趣和大量研究.近年来有关铂合金纳米晶的形貌可控合成和催化性能取得了突飞猛进的进展;但与此同时,如何在长期的催化反应服役过程中保持合金纳米晶的形貌和催化性能的长期稳定是拓展其实际应用的重要瓶颈.本文首先回顾了近年来在铂合金纳米晶的形貌调控和催化性能提升上的重要进展,进一步介绍了铂合金纳米晶在催化反应前后形貌和催化性能的稳定性,以及基于高分辨透射电子显微镜和谱学分析的失效机制研究;最后,总结了提高形貌和催化性能稳定性的一些可行途径.这些结果对进一步设计具有高活性、长寿命的燃料电池铂合金纳米催化剂具有较好的指导作用,同时也对用于其他催化反应的金属合金纳米晶催化剂具有一定的借鉴作用.						1	1	0	0	0	0	2			0023-074X			CSCD:6087220

Schley, Nathan/0000-0002-1539-6031; Crabtree, Robert/0000-0002-6639-8707			Comparison of Amorphous Iridium Water-Oxidation Electrocatalysts Prepared from Soluble Precursors								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				51	14			7749	7763		10.1021/ic300764f				JUL 16 2012	2012	Electrodeposition of iridium oxide layers from soluble precursors provides a route to active thin-layer electrocatalysts for use on water-oxidizing anodes. Certain organometallic half-sandwich aqua complexes of iridium form stable and highly active oxide films upon electrochemical oxidation in aqueous solution. The catalyst films appear as blue layers on the anode when sufficiently thick, and most closely resemble hydrous iridium(III,IV) oxide by voltammetry. The deposition rate and cyclic voltammetric response of the electrodeposited material depend on whether the precursor complex contains a pentamethylcyclopentadieneyl (Cp*) or cyclopentadienyl ligand (Cp), and do not match, in either case, iridium oxide anodes prepared from non-organometallic precursors. Here, we survey our organometallic precursors, iridium hydroxide, and pre-formed iridium oxide nanoparticles. From electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (EQCN) studies, we find differences in the rate of electrodeposition of catalyst layers from the two half-sandwich precursors; however, the resulting layers operate as water-oxidizing anodes with indistinguishable overpotentials and HID isotope effects. Furthermore, using the mass data collected by EQCN and not otherwise available, we show that the electrodeposited materials are excellent catalysts for the water-oxidation reaction, showing maximum turnover frequencies greater than 0.5 mol O-2 (mol iridium)(-1) s(-1) and quantitative conversion of current to product dioxygen. Importantly, these anodes maintain their high activity and robustness at very low iridium loadings. Our organometallic precursors contrast with pre-formed iridium oxide nanoparticles, which form an unstable electrodeposited material that is not stably adherent to the anode surface at even moderately oxidizing potentials.									64	2	0	0	8	1	65			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000306381800045	22725667

The reduction process and the phase evolution during reduction of the mixed oxides was followed by temperature-programmed reduction and XRD. The mixed oxides were activated in an H-2/N-2 flow and then tested as catalysts in the vapour-phase hydrogenation of gamma-butyrolactone (GEL) and a solution of maleic anhydride (MA) in GEL (60:40 w/w). Depending on composition, heating temperature and atmosphere, the samples contained different phases, such as CuO, CdO, Cr2O3, CuCrO2, CuCrO4, alpha-CdCrO4, cubic and tetragonal CuCr2O4, and cubic Cu-Zn and Cu-Cd spinel-type phases. The partial substitution of Cu2+ ions with Zn2+ or Cd2+ ions stabilizes the cubic form of the spinel-type phases, which form via intermediate chromate phases. The final product of reduction in all cases is metallic copper. Cubic CuCr2O4 is more reducible than the corresponding tetragonal phase, which reduces to metallic copper through the intermediate formation of CuCrO2. The presence of zinc or cadmium promotes or inhibits, respectively, the copper reducibility both in CuO and in the copper chromite spinel. In the hydrogenation of GBL, the Cu/Cr catalysts obtained by calcination show similar behaviours, with a small increase in activity as a function of the copper content. At the lower temperatures investigated the main products are tetrahydrofuran (THF) and n-butanol, while at 548 K significant amounts of ethanol are observed, favoured by increasing copper content. On the other hand, the Cu/Cr catalyst obtained by heating under a reduced oxygen atmosphere, for which only tetragonal CuCr2O4 is detected before reduction, shows a decrease in catalytic activity, Partial substitution of the CU2+ ions gives rise to a decrease in GEL conversion, with a considerable deactivation when Cd2+ ions are present. Decreasing the H,IC, molar ratio gives rise to a decrease in activity for all samples, without any significant change in the trend observed. With the MA/GBL solution, the partial substitution of Cd2+ ions for Cu2+ ions also gives rise to considerable deactivation. For the other catalysts, the main products at the lower temperatures are GEL and succinic anhydride (SA), while at 548 K overhydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions predominate. The presence of Zn2+ ions gives rise to an increase in yield in GEL, due to an increase in the hydrogenation activity toward SA, but the consecutive transformation of GEL at high temper ature to low cost by products is not inhibited. On the other hand, the presence in the Cu/Cr catalyst of only CuCr2O4 increases the yield in GEL, as a consequence of a strong inhibition of the overhydrogenation and/or hydrogenolysis reactions of GEL. With the MA/GBL solution, similar behaviours are observed when the H-2/C-4 molar ratio decreases. At the same time, however, the lack in the carbon balance increases and a displacement towards high temperature of the maximum yield in GEL is found.									45	7	0	0	2	0	50			0926-860X			WOS:A1995QL28500009

Rechargeable solid-state flexible Zn-air battery (F-ZAB) is considered as one of the most competitive and promising energy storage system because of its high energy density, intrinsic safety, and flexible mechanical properties. In recent years, although cathode electrocatalysts have made great progress in improving the electrochemical properties of F-ZABs, the mechanical flexibility and durability of F-ZABs for wearable application still face many technical challenges. Moreover, with the miniaturization of wearable electronic devices, the on-chip integrability of F-ZABs is also needful. To maintain the balance among electrochemical properties, flexibility and integrability of F-ZABs, efficient catalyst, durable electrode, high conductivity and flexible electrolyte, and reasonable battery configuration are crucial. In this article, the latest advances and challenges of F-ZABs exploration are introduced though a detailed review of the battery components including the air electrode, Zn electrode, solid-state electrolyte, and the battery configuration. Meanwhile, challenges facing the development of F-ZABs are highlighted together with the discussion of further research directions and perspectives.

Commercial stacks often suffer from cationic contamination of catalyst-coated membranes (CCMs) that comes from impure feed water and corrosion of system components, which can result in increasing operation costs and lowered lifetime. This study describes the behavior of the contaminants in the CCMs and their impact on performance under various operating conditions using Gd3+ as model contaminant imaged with neutron with a combination of high effective temporal (2 s) and spatial (30 mu m) resolutions. The presence of electric field directly affects the position of cations in the CCM leading to their accumulation near the cathode catalyst layer. The cationic impurities trigger multiple loss mechanisms, as the ohmic resistance increase does not scale linearly with the amount of occupied exchange groups in the membrane (10% resistance increase caused by 2.5% exchange groups occupation). A model has been developed that predicts the movement of the ions in the CCM under intermittently operating PEWE and was used as a basis to explain the hysteresis observed in the polarization curve of contaminated PEWEs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000594745300001

Due to the high temperatures involved in their synthesis and the sensitivity of Fe ions toward carbothermal reduction, current synthetic methods are intrinsically limited in type and amount of the desired, catalytically active Fe-N-4 sites, and high active site densities have been out of reach (dilemma of Fe-N-C catalysts). We herein identify a paradigm change in the synthesis of Fe-N-C catalysts arising from the developments of other M-N-C single-atom catalysts. Supported by DFT calculations we propose fundamental principles for the synthesis of M-N-C materials. We further exploit the proposed principles in a novel synthetic strategy to surpass the dilemma of Fe-N-C catalysts. The selective formation of tetrapyrrolic Zn-N-4 sites in a tailor-made Zn-N-C material is utilized as an active-site imprint for the preparation of a corresponding Fe-N-C catalyst. By successive low- and high-temperature ion exchange reactions, we obtain a phase-pure Fe-N-C catalyst, with a high loading of atomically dispersed Fe (>3 wt %). Moreover, the catalyst is entirely composed of tetrapyrrolic Fe-N-4 sites. The density of tetrapyrrolic Fe-N-4 sites is more than six times as high as for previously reported tetrapyrrolic single-site Fe-N-C fuel cell catalysts.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000715845900020	34689551

It is well known that the symbiotic microbes have evolved various mechanisms to either benefit or exploit the mammalian host immune system to maintain homeostasis. However, the strategies employed by the symbiotic microbes to overcome host immune responses in invertebrates are still not clear. In the current study, the hemolymph microbes in oyster Crassostrea gigas were found to be able to directly bind an oyster Ig superfamily member (IgSF) (designated as CgIgIT) to inhibit the immune responses of hemocytes. The mRNA transcripts of CgIgIT in hemocytes increased significantly after the stimulation with hemolymph microbes. CgIgIT was found to be located on the hemocyte membrane and it was able to directly bind the hemolymph microbes and polysaccharides via its three Ig domains and recruited the protein tyrosine phosphatase CgSHP2 through its ITIM. The recruited CgSHP2 inhibited the activities of CgERK, CgP38 and CgJNK proteins to reduce the productions of dual oxidase 2 (CgDuox2) and defensin 2 (CgDef2), which eventually protected the hemolymph microbes from CgDuox2/CgDef2-mediated elimination. Collectively, the results suggest that the oyster IgIT-SHP2 signaling pathway can recognize bacteria capable of residing in oyster hemolymph and inhibit innate immune responses, which contributes to the maintenance, colonization, and survival of hemolymph microbes.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0022-1767	1550-6606		WOS:000581921400007	32989090

Here, hollow N-doped carbon spheres (HNCSs) were prepared by using a polydopamine-assisted method for supporting flowerlike PtPd alloy nanoparticles which were synthesized by the reduction of H2PtCl6 and Na2PdCl4 with ascorbic acid. The effect of Pt-to-Pd molar ratios on the catalytic activity was investigated for methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol electrooxidation (MOR, EOR and EGOR). Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that PtPd/HNCSs (only 2 wt.%) exhibited higher catalytic activity, stability and tolerance to CO poisoning than commercial Pt/C (20 wt.%) catalyst in the alcohols oxidation. It could be attributed to the structural and compositional advantages of the synergistic effect of Pt and Pd besides large specific surface area and mesoporous structure of HNCSs. After 200 scanning cycles, the peak currents density of Pt3Pd1/HNCSs still remained 77.8%, 88.9% and 93.9% of the initial cycle in MOR, EOR and EGOR, respectively. Meanwhile, the kinetic study confirmed that the MOR, EOR and EGOR processes were diffusion-controlled and irreversible. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Rapid aerosol deposition of Co3O4 nanoparticles and thermally induced self-organization lead to an ultra-fine nano-island morphology with more than 94% light transmission at a wavelength of 500 nm. These transparent sub-monolayers demonstrate a remarkable mass-weighted water oxidation activity of 2070-2350 Ag-Co3O4(-1) and per-metal turnover frequency of 0.38-0.62 s(-1) at an overpotential of 400 mV in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution. This mixed valent cobalt oxide structure exhibits excellent long-term electrochemical and mechanical stability preserving the initial catalytic activity over more than 12 h of constant current electrolysis and 1000 consecutive voltammetric cycles. The potential of the Co3O4 nano-islands for photo-electrochemical water splitting has been demonstrated by incorporation of co-catalysts in GaN nanowire photoanodes. The Co3O4-GaN photoanodes reveal significantly reduced onset overpotentials, improved photoresponse and photostability compared to the bare GaN ones. These findings provide a highly performing catalyst structure and a scalable synthesis method for the engineering of efficient photoanodes for integrated solar water-splitting cells.									36	2	0	0	1	0	37			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000381695700013

The potential of beta-SiC to act as a catalyst support for PEMWE anodes was evaluated. To do so, a modified version of the Adams fusion method was used to prepare catalysts with IrO2 supported on beta-SiC with a mass percentage of IrO2 of 20, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 %. The thin-film method was used for the electrochemical characterization of catalysts by cyclic and linear sweep voltammetry. The catalysts were further characterized by scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and N-2 adsorption (BET). Gas diffusion electrodes with the synthesized catalysts were prepared for tests in a laboratory PEMWE. A 10 % improvement over pure IrO2 was found in a supported catalyst with 80 wt.% IrO2. However, such a small improvement is not statistically significant. Therefore, the support may not influence the electrocatalytic activity of IrO2.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000339800600028		
J	Sunda, WG; Huntsman, SA								Interactive effects of external manganese, the toxic metals copper and zinc, and light in controlling cellular manganese and growth in a coastal diatom								LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY				43	7			1467	1475		10.4319/lo.1998.43.7.1467				NOV 1998	1998	Manganese is a fundamental component of the photosystem II reaction center, and thus its requirement should be Linked to light utilization. High levels of Cu and Zn antagonize Mn nutrition by inhibiting cellular Mn uptake. Experiments were conducted to examine the interactive effects of Mn, the toxic metals Cu and Zn, and light on cellular Mn, chlorophyll a (Chl a), and specific growth rate in Thalassiosira pseudonana. Cu and Zn inhibition of growth rate occurred only at low Mn ion concentrations, an effect that was independent of Light intensity and was totally accounted for by inhibition of Mn uptake by these metals. Cells grown at growth-limiting low light intensities contained high levels of Mn and Chi a, which are needed for the synthesis of additional photosynthetic units during low-light acclimation. This additional Mn was not provided by higher cellular Mn uptake rates, since these rates were the same in light-saturated and light-limited cells. However, because steady-state cell Mn is equal to the uptake rate divided by the specific growth rate, the cells were able to accumulate the additional Mn needed for acclimation once light limitation caused growth rate to decline, a inherent negative feedback relation. In seawater, Mn and Cu may interact with light in controlling algal growth rate, since the free ion concentration of both metals is influenced by light within the euphotic zone.									53	2	0	0	44	0	56			0024-3590			WOS:000077285000007

Integration and stability of the mutated D1 proteins in the thylakoid membrane were studied by immunoblot and pulse-chase analyses. It was found that in Delta(N325-E333), the D1 protein with a deletion in the C-terminal tail, could insert in the thylakoids to normal amounts but its stability in the membrane was dramatically reduced. Insertion of D1 in Delta(V58-D61) or Delta(D103-G109);G110R, with deletions in the A-B loop, was severely obstructed, For Delta(P350-T354), with a deletion in the processed region of the C-terminus of D1, no phenotypic effects were observed. The effects of failed D1 insertion or accumulation on Photosystem II assembly was monitored by immunoblot analysis. The conclusions from these experiments are that the extrinsic 33 kDa protein, CP43, and the beta subunit of cytochrome b559 accumulate in the thylakoid membrane independently of the D1 protein, and that accumulation of the D2 protein and CP47 requires insertion but not necessarily accumulation of the D1 protein.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1996VY82100003	24271610

Here, fully decoupled catalytic interfaces realized using surface-structured cocatalyst foils are demonstrated, allowing optimized photoabsorbers to be combined with high-performance earth-abundant cocatalysts. Since many earth-abundant cocatalysts are deposited via solution-based methods, deposition on chemical-sensitive photoabsorbers is a significant challenge. By synthesizing cocatalyst foils prior to device fabrication, photoabsorbers are completely isolated from corrosive chemical environments and are provided with outstanding protection during operation. Si and GaAs photoelectrodes prepared using Ni-based cocatalyst foils achieve excellent half-cell efficiencies and generate stable photocurrents for over 5 days. Furthermore, a GaAs artificial leaf achieves a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 13.6% and maintains an efficiency of over 10% for longer than nine days, an accomplishment that has not been previously reported for an immersed solar water splitting system. These results, together with theoretical calculations of other photoelectrode systems, demonstrate that cocatalyst foils offer a very attractive method for fabricating high-performance solar water splitting systems.									3	0	0	0	0	0	2			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000717741100001

Foods tainted with alloxan are considered as a leading cause of diabetes. Hence, real time quantification of alloxan is mandatory to estimate the diabetogenic risk of food samples. Electrochemical activity of alloxan at various carbon nanomaterials has been used for the quantitative determination of alloxan in neutral and acid media. This method has made use of derivative technique that does not require further instrumentation but has remarkably improved the sensitivity. Alloxan has exhibited the highest electrochemical activity at single-walled carbon nanotubes among the investigated carbon nanomaterials. The redox activity of alloxan has disappeared in the conventional voltammogram at a concentration of 3 x 10(-6) M, whereas, prominent peaks have been observed well below 3 x 10(-7) M in derivative voltammograms. Linear calibration graphs have been constructed in the concentration range between 3 x 10(-3) and 3 x 10(-7) M both in neutral and acid media. The detection limits of alloxan in neutral and acid media are 5 x 10(-8) and 1 x 10(-7) M respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It is recognized that the properties of confined liquid water, or liquid water in contact with hydrophobic surfaces, significantly differ from those of bulk liquid water. However, these unique properties of water are only found within the interfacial phase and a confined environment; thus, their applications are limited. Nowadays, environmentally friendly science, health and energy are main concerns in the world. In this review, an innovative and facile method for preparing mass-produced plasmon-activated water (PAW) with reduced HBs by letting bulk water flow through gold-supported nanoparticles (AuNPs) under resonant illumination at constant temperature is reported. The resulting stable PAW exhibits distinct properties and activities, which significantly differ from those of untreated bulk water. In addition, this PAW has the obvious advantages in environmentally friendly science, green energy, water saving and medicine. (C) 2017 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

Pretreatment revealed that dimethyl phenyl carbinol was slowly oxidized by molecular ozone; however, it readily reacted with hydroxyl radicals to yield acetophenone as a primary product. Acetophenone was further oxidized, first through five different pathways to form benzoic acid, phenyl glyoxalic acid, 4-4 '-diacetyl biphenyl, and several hydroxylated aromatic compounds, and later to aliphatic carboxylic acids via ring cleavage. Regardless of system configuration (homogeneous vs heterogeneous), operating mode (batch vs continuous), and chemical concentration, the average intrinsic rate constants were 1.05 x 10(10) and 9.29 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) for dimethyl phenyl carbinol and acetophenone, respectively.

As one of the most effective strategies to promote CO2 photoconversion, defect engineering shows great potential in modulating the electronic structure and light absorption properties of photocatalysts while increasing surface active sites for CO2 activation and conversion. This Review summarizes the recent progress in defect engineering of photocatalysts to promote CO2 reduction performances from the following four aspects: 1) Approaches to defect (mainly vacancy and dopant) generation in photocatalysts; 2) defect structure characterization techniques; 3) physical and chemical properties of defect-engineered photocatalysts; 4) CO2 reduction performance enhancements in activity, selectivity, and stability of photocatalysts by defect engineering. This Review is expected to present readers with a comprehensive view of progress in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction through defect engineering for elevated CO2-to-fuels conversion efficiency.									11	0	0	0	2	0	10			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000648910000001	33872463

However, knowledge about APX gene family members and their evolutionary and functional characteristics in kiwifruit is limited. In this study, we identified 13 members of the APX gene family in the kiwifruit (cultivar: Hongyang) genome according the APX proteins conserved domain of Arabidopsis thaliana. Phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood split these 13 genes into four groups. The APX gene family members were distributed on nine chromosomes (Nos. 4, 5, 11, 13, 20, 21, 23, 25, 28). Most of the encoded hydrophilic and lipid-soluble enzymes were predicted to be located in the cytoplasm, nucleus and chloroplast. Among them, AcAPX4, AcAPX5, AcAPX8, AcAPX12 were transmembrane proteins, and AcAPX8 and AcAPX12 had the same transmembrane domain. The gene structure analysis showed that AcAPXs were composed of 4-22 introns, except that AcAPX10 was intron-free. Multiple expectation maximization for motif elicitation program (MEME) analyzed 13 APX protein sequences of Actinidia chinensis and identified 10 conserved motifs ranging in length from 15 to 50 amino acid residues. Additionally, the predicted secondary structures of the main motifs consisted of alpha-helix and random coils. The gene expression of fruits in different growth stages and bagging treatment were determined by qRT-PCR. The results showed that 8 AcAPXs had the highest expression levels during the color turning period and only the gene expression of AcAPX3 was consistent with the ascorbic acid content; five AcAPXs were consistent with the ascorbic acid content after bagging. Our data provided evolutionary and functional information of AcAPX gene family members and revealed the gene expression of different members in different growth stages and bagging treatments These results may be useful for future studies of the structures and functions of AcAPX family members.									10	2	0	0	10	0	11			0918-9440	1618-0860		WOS:000538366600001	32506283

In order to explain the reasons of this capacity improvement, the changes in chemical composition of ZTC surface during its pretreatment in sulfuric acid either by simple immersion, or by potentiodynamic polarization, and during subsequent potentiodynamic polarization in KOH solutions, were studied by means of TG/DTA, FTIR spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The results of this study open some novel insights in understanding of very peculiar carbon electrochemistry. The observed changes in surface chemistry include i) fast adsorption of H2O and formation of OH and epoxide groups on immersion in sulfuric acid, ii) the multiplication of concentration of H2O/OH- and epoxide groups during potentiodynamic cycling in sulfuric acid and iii) the ring-opening of epoxide groups (formed during potentiodynamic cycling in acidic solution) upon its potentiodynamic cycling in alkaline solution, according to a S(N)2 type mechanism, which results in the formation of aromatic OH-containing diol compounds.

While some constraints do exist (e.g., zircon evidence for surface liquid water), relatively few constraints exist on the abundances of trace chemical species, which are relevant to assessing the plausibility and guiding the development of postulated prebiotic chemical pathways which depend on these species. In this work, we combine literature photochemistry models with simple equilibrium chemistry calculations to place constraints on the plausible range of concentrations of sulfidic anions (HS-, HSO3-, SO32-) available in surficial aquatic reservoirs on early Earth due to outgassing of SO2 and H2S and their dissolution into small shallow surface water reservoirs like lakes. We find that this mechanism could have supplied prebiotically relevant levels of SO2-derived anions, but not H2S-derived anions. Radiative transfer modeling suggests UV light would have remained abundant on the planet surface for all but the largest volcanic explosions. We apply our results to the case study of the proposed prebiotic reaction network of Patel et al. (2015) and discuss the implications for improving its prebiotic plausibility. In general, epochs of moderately high volcanism could have been especially conducive to cyanosulfidic prebiotic chemistry. Our work can be similarly applied to assess and improve the prebiotic plausibility of other postulated surficial prebiotic chemistries that are sensitive to sulfidic anions, and our methods adapted to study other atmospherically derived trace species.

Recently, bacteria have become resistant to beta-lactamase inhibitors, making this problem pressing. In an effort to overcome this resistance, non-beta-lactam inhibitors of beta-lactamases were investigated for complementarity to the structure of AmpC beta-lactamase from Escherichia coli. This led to the discovery of an inhibitor, benzo (b)thiophene-2-boronic acid (BZBTH2B), which inhibited AmpC with a K-i of 27 nhl. This inhibitor is chemically dissimilar to beta-lactams, raisin the question of what specific interactions are responsible for its activity. To answer this question, the X-ray crystallographic structure of BZBTH2B in complex with AmpC was determined to 2.25 Angstrom resolution. The structure reveals several unexpected interactions. The inhibitor appears to complement the conserved, R1-amide binding region of AmpC, despite lacking an amide group. Interactions between one of the boronic acid oxygen atoms, Tyr150, and an ordered water molecule suggest a mechanism for acid/base catalysis and a direction for hydrolytic attack in the enzyme catalyzed reaction. To investigate how a non-beta-lactam inhibitor would perform against resistant bacteria, BZBTH2B was tested in antimicrobial assays. BZBTH2B significantly potentiated the activity of a third-generation cephalosporin against AmpC-producing resistant bacteria. This inhibitor was unaffected by two common resistance mechanisms that often arise against beta-lactams in conjunction with beta-lactamases. Porin channel mutations did not decrease the efficacy of BZBTH2B against cells expressing AmpC. Also, this inhibitor did not induce expression of AmpC, a problem with many beta-lactams. The structure of the BZBTH2B/AmpC complex provides a starting point for the structure-based elaboration of this class of non-beta inhibitors.									78	1	0	0	62	0	83			0961-8368	1469-896X		WOS:000083626200011	10595535	
J	Jafari, Maasoomeh; Botte, Gerardine G.								Electrochemical valorization of waste activated sludge for short-chain fatty acids production								FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY				10						974223	10.3389/fchem.2022.974223				AUG 30 2022	2022	A tremendous amount of waste activated sludge (WAS) ends up in landfilling even after a substantial retention time during anaerobic digestion. This leftover activated sludge is an organic-rich material with the high potential to produce value-added chemicals such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). In the present study, a novel electrochemical conversion of activated sludge (E-WAS) was carried out on the surface of non-precious electrodes (nickel, stainless-steel and copper) in alkaline media at low applied potential and temperature. Cyclic voltammetry showed that Cu (II)/Cu (III) and Ni (II)/Ni(III) redox couple catalyzed the WAS oxidation reaction to produce SCFAs and hydrogen. The results revealed that Cu(II)/Cu(III) has higher catalytic oxidation capability towards SCFAs. Yields of 48.7, 21.4, and 14.6 mg SCFAs per g of volatile solids were achieved by using copper, nickel and stainless-steel as working electrodes, respectively. Post analysis characterization techniques indicate that copper oxide films lead to WAS oxidation. Total volatile solid removal of 30% was obtained at 35 & DEG;C and 1.65 V in 0.2 M NaOH after 2 h of operation in an electrochemical digestor with copper electrodes which is more efficient than a conventional alkaline treatment (24 h, 55%, 1M NaOH). Ammonia was produced as the by-product of E-WAS oxidation. The highest amount of ammonia (250 mg L-1) was obtained by using nickel as the working electrode after 2 h operation at 35 & DEG;C and 1.35 V applied potential. The change in WAS morphology revealed that the copper oxide film is an effective electrocatalyst for WAS disinfection.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-2646			WOS:000854001600001	36110143

This synthetic approach led to spherical, small, and monodisperse NPs [mean diameter ca. 2.0-2.5 nm determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)]. Wide-ranging characterization of these NPs, including TEM, powder Xray diffraction, and small-angle X-ray scattering, and several spectroscopic techniques, such as X-ray fluorescence, IR, and solid-state NMR, proved the formation of a core/shell structure constituted by a crystalline Bi(0) core and amorphous P-containing shells, representing a unique case of phase segregation for metal/phosphorus materials reported in the literature. The assessed reactivity of the as-prepared Bi/P NPs evidenced their potential application in the synthesis of phosphine (PH3) in a safer way than the conventional approach using P-4 (white phosphorus) and in a sharp contrast with the reported reactivity of amorphous red phosphorus.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000537657500010

In the absence of artificial electron accepters, electron transport was limited to a single turnover. Addition of the electron accepters DCBQ and ferricyanide restored the characteristic period-four oscillation in the UV absorbance associated with the S-state cycle, but not the period-two oscillation indicative of the alternating appearance and disappearance of a semiquinone at the Q(B)-site. In contrast to PS II membranes, all active centers were in state S-1 after dark adaptation. The absorbance increase associated with the S-state transitions on the first two flashes, attributed to the Z(+)S(1) --> ZS(2) and Z(+)S(2) --> ZS(3) transitions, respectively, had half-times of 95 and 380 mu s, similar to those reported for PS II membrane fragments. The decrease due to the Z(+)S(3) --> ZS(0) transition on the third flash had a half-time of 4.5 ms, as in salt-washed PS II membrane fragments. On the fourth flash a small, unresolved, increase of less than 3 mu s was observed, which might be due to the Z(+)S(0) --> ZS(1) transition. The deactivation of the higher S-states was unusually fast and occurred within a few seconds and so was the oxidation of S-0 to S-1 in the dark, which had a half-time of 2-3 min. The same lifetime was found for tyrosine D+, which appeared to be formed within milliseconds after the first flash in about 10% inactive centers and after the third and later flashes by active centers in Z(+)S(3).									32	0	0	0	29	0	32			0166-8595			WOS:A1993MR87900007	24317913

We approach the characterization of their performance in a holistic manner: not just a single performance parameter is considered, but instead a combination of short-term electrocatalytic proficiency in process-relevant conditions and long-term stability. The preparation combines two ingredients: (1) anodization of the felts to generate surface porosity with (2) atomic layer deposition (ALD) to coat the porous substrates with thin iridium films of 8 nm thickness. Samples generated with anodization in various conditions are characterized quantitatively in terms of their electrochemical performance (overpotential eta(10), maximum current density j(max), electrochemically active surface area expressed as roughness factor rf) and of their stability (electrochemical, chemical and physical). We find that electrodes obtained by anodization in water exhibit both lower stability and lower performance than their counterparts prepared in organic electrolytes. However, the electrode type that exhibits the best pure electrochemical performance (lowest eta(10) and highest j(max)) also exhibits a fragile surface structure.

The rates of arsenic sulfide oxidation at higher pH values relative to those at p (H) over tilde2 are in the range of 26-4478, 3-17, 8-182, and 4-10 times for As2S3 (am), orpiment, AsS (am), and realgar, respectively.Numerical simulations of orpiment and realgar oxidation kinetics were conducted using the geochemical reaction path code EQ3/6 to evaluate the effects of variable DO concentrations and mineral reactivity factors on water chemistry evolution during orpiment and realgar oxidation. The results show that total As concentrations increase by similar to1.14 to 13 times and that pH values decrease by similar to0.6 to 4.2 U over a range of mineral reactivity factors from 1% to 50% after 2000 days (5.5 yr). The As release from orpiment and realgar oxidation exceeds the current U.S. National Drinking Water Standard (0.05 ppm) approximately in 200-300 days at the lowest initial dissolved oxygen concentration (3 ppm) and a reactivity factor of 1%. The results of simulations of orpiment oxidation in the presence of albite and calcite show that calcite can act as an effective buffer to the acid water produced from orpiment oxidation within relatively short periods (days/months), but the release of As continues to increase.Pyrite oxidation rates are faster than orpiment and realgar from pH 2.3 to 8; however, pyrite oxidation rates are slower than As2S3 (am) and AsS (am) at pH 8. The activation energies of arsenic sulfide oxidation range from 16 to 124 kJ/mol at p (H) over tilde8 and temperature 25 to 40degreesC, and pyrite activation energies are similar to52, to 88 kJ/mol, depending on pH and temperature range. The magnitude of activation energies for both pyrite and arsenic sulfide solids indicates that the oxidation of these minerals is dominated by surface reactions, except for As2S3 (am). Low activation energies of As2S3 (am) indicate that diffusion may be rate controlling.Limestone is commonly mixed with sulfide minerals in a mining environment to prevent acid water formation. However, the oxidation rates of arsenic sulfides increase as solution pH rises and result in a greater release of As. Furthermore, the lifetimes of carbonate minerals (i.e., calcite, aragonite, and dolomite) are much shorter than those of arsenic sulfide and silicate minerals. Thus, within a geologic frame time, carbonate minerals may not be present to act as a pH buffer for acid mine waters. Additionally, the presence of silicate minerals such as pyroxenes (wollastonite, jadeite, and spodumene) and Ca-feldspars (labradorite, anorthite, and nepheline) may not be important for buffering acid solutions because these minerals dissolve faster than and have shorter lifetimes than sulfide minerals. However, other silicate minerals such as Na and K-feldspars (albite, sanidine, and microcline), quartz, pyroxenes (augite, enstatite, diopsite, and MnSiO3) that have much longer lifetimes than arsenic sulfide minerals may be present in a system. The results of our modeling of arsenic sulfide mineral oxidation show that these minerals potentially can release significant concentrations of dissolved As to natural waters, and the factors and mechanisms involved in arsenic sulfide oxidation warrant further study.

Here, we have successfully realized large band gap reduction and visible light photocatalytic water splitting on a wide band gap semiconductor Mg4Ta2O9 by nitrogen doping. More than 2.6 eV reductions in band gap have been achieved after doping nitrogen into Mg4Ta2O9, which strikingly red-shifts its absorption edge from less than 300 nm to as far as 600 nm. The nitrogen doped Mg4Ta2O9, i.e. Mg4Ta2O9Ny shows promising photocatalytic activities for water reduction and oxidation under visible light illumination (lambda >= 400 nm). Apparent quantum efficiency as high as similar to 1.57% has been achieved at 420 +/- 20 nm which is comparable to a number of active metal oxynitride photocatalysts. Photoelectrochemical analysis suggests that this band gap reduction stems mainly from an uplift of valence band edge position along with nitrogen doping. Our band gap engineering on a compact corundum type compound implies that nitrogen doping can be applicable to a wider range of metal oxides, not necessarily limited to those with an 'open' crystal structure (tunnels or layers, etc.) reported in the literatures, thereby opening new possibilities in searching and developing visible light active photocatalysts.

We report a synthesis of porous carbon-coated noble metal-based catalysts. We adopt simple annealing strategy involving Ir-doped zeolite imidazole skeleton to obtain IrCo alloys encapsulated by the porous carbon layers and carbon nanotubes, which is a new method for synthesizing IrCo alloy. The amount of Ir loaded in IrCo NPs catalyst is extremely low (only 6.7 wt%) and IrCo NPs exhibit excellent catalytic activity for both HER and OER in acidic environment, to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density during HER and OER, overpotential of only 23.9 and 270 mV is required for our novel IrCo NPs catalyst. More significantly, IrCo NPs reach 10 mA cm(-2) during overall water splitting at a cell voltage of only 1.55 V in 0.5 M H2SO4 and demonstrated good durability. Thus, it has excellent prospects to be implemented into PEM for water electrolysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									30	1	0	0	1	0	30			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000464956000021		
J	Dalstra, HJ; Ridley, JR; Bloem, EJM; Groves, DI								Metamorphic evolution of the central Southern Cross Province, Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia								AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES				46	5			765	784		10.1046/j.1440-0952.1999.00744.x				OCT 1999	1999	Two contrasting styles of metamorphism are preserved in the central Southern Cross Province. An early, low-grade and low-strain event prevailed in the central parts of the Marda greenstone belt and was broadly synchronous with the first major folding event (D-1) in the region. Mineral assemblages similar to those encountered in sea-floor alteration are indicative of mostly prehnite-pumpellyite facies conditions, but locally actinolite-bearing assemblages suggest conditions up to mid-greenschist facies. Geothermobarometry indicates that peak metamorphic conditions were of the order of 250-300 degrees C at pressures below 180 MPa in the prehnite-pumpellyite facies, but may have been as high as 400 degrees C at 220 MPa in the greenschist facies. A later, higher grade, high-strain metamorphic event was largely confined to the margins of the greenstone belts. Mineral assemblages and geothermobarometry suggest conditions from upper greenschist facies at P-T conditions of about 500 degrees C and 220 MPa to upper amphibolite facies at 670 degrees C and 400 MPa. Critical mineral reactions in metapelitic rocks suggest clockwise P-T paths. Metamorphism was diachronous across the metamorphic domains. Peak metamorphic conditions were reached relatively early in the low-grade terrains, but outlasted most of the deformation in the higher grade terrains. Early metamorphism is interpreted to be a low-strain, ocean-floor-style alteration event in a basin with high heat flow. In contrast, differential uplift of the granitoids and greenstones, with conductive heat input from the granitoids into the greenstones, is the preferred explanation for the distribution and timing of the high-strain metamorphism in this region.									32	0	0	0	0	0	32			0812-0099			WOS:000082845700008

Excessive ROS may become a source of carcinogen due to DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, cell injury, and cell death. In order to prevent these adverse effects of ROS, antioxidant enzymes have evolved in aerobic organisms. Catalase is a major antioxidant enzyme that breaks down excessive H2O2 and inhibits apoptotic cell death. Here we molecularly characterized catalase from red-lip mullet. The cDNA sequence of LhCAT consists of an ORF of 1545 bp, which encodes a 527 amino acid peptide (similar to 60 kDa). Based on bioinformatics analysis, LhCAT possesses a domain architecture characteristic of catalases, including a catalase proximal active site signature and a catalase proximal heme-ligand signature. It also has heme and NADPH binding sites homologous to previously described catalases. Pairwise alignment with its homologs revealed that LhCAT shares 95.1% identity with Oplegnathus fasciatus catalase and 97.4% similarity with Sparus aurata catalase. An uprooted phylogenetic tree demonstrated that LhCAT resides in a Glade with catalases from other teleosts and exhibits a close relationship with Oplegnathus fasciatus catalase. Among twelve tissue types, we observed the highest LhCAT mRNA expression in the liver, followed by blood. Immune challenge by Lactococcus garvieae, or Poly I:C in the blood or spleen resulted in up regulation at 24 h post injection. We also tested the antioxidant activity of recombinant LhCAT against hydrogen peroxide and found its optimal concentration to be 12.5 mu g/mL. Collectively, these data suggested that LhCAT play an important role in antioxidant defense and immune response of red-lip mullet.									5	2	0	0	5	0	6			0378-1119	1879-0038		WOS:000482251100013	31279712

High-efficient electrocatalysts with robust activity and desirable stability are urgent required. Herein, CoSe/Co (OH)(2) carbonous material (CoSe/Co(OH)(2)-CM (AE)) is constructed via acid etching and in-situ selenization method. Acid etching was employed to expose more Co atoms to increase the active sites and facilitate the selenization process. CoSe/Co(OH)(2) carbonous nanoparticles with optimized composition and morphology advantages manifest accelerated catalytic activity. The characterization results combined with theory calculations reveal that the nanointerface interaction between Co(OH)(2) and CoSe modifies the electronic structure of Co atoms, thus increasing the intrinsic activity of active sites. The CoSe/Co(OH)(2)-CM (AE) exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 299 mV for OER and 207 mV for HER at 10 mA cm(-2 )in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. Moreover, the CoSe/Co(OH)(2)-CM (AE) served as both the cathode and anode only needs a potential of 1.65 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting. This work puts forward an in -situ route to construct transition-metal based electrocatalysts with modulated electronic structure towards highly efficient water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1359-8368	1879-1069		WOS:000793698300002

The Ni3S2 nanowires were uniformly formed on the smooth NF surface, and the Co(OH)(2) shell was formed on the Ni3S2 nanowire surface. By direct NF participation as a reactant without adding any other Ni source, Ni3S2 was formed more closely to the NF surface, and the Co(OH)(2) shell suppressed the loss of active material during charging-discharging, yielding excellent electrochemical properties. The Co(OH)(2)-Ni3S2/Ni electrode produced using 0.5 mmol Co(OH)(2) (Co-0.5-Ni3S2/Ni) exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1837 F g(-1) (16.07 F cm(-2)) at a current density of 5 mA cm(-2), and maintained a capacitance of 583 F g(-1) (16.07 F cm(-2)) at a much higher current density of 50 mA cm(-2). An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with Co(OH)(2)-Ni3S2 and active carbon displayed a high-power density of 1036 kW kg(-1) at an energy density of 43 W h kg(-1) with good cycling stability, indicating its suitability for use in energy storage applications. Thus, the newly developed core-shell structure, Co(OH)(2)-Ni3S2, was shown to be efficient at improving the electrochemical performance.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2079-4991		WOS:000750797600001	35009986

Herein, 3D vanadium nitride (VN) and Pd/VN hollow nanospheres are successfully fabricated and coupled to carry out simultaneous electrocatalytic oxidation (ECO) and electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2, 5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and 2,5-bishydroxymethyl-tetrahydrofuran (DHMTHF), respectively. VN shows excellent ECO performance with high HMF conversion (>= 98%), FDCA selectivity (>= 96%), and faradaic efficiency (>= 84%) after a stability test, and Pd/VN achieves high ECH selectivity for DHMTHF at >= 88% and an HMF conversion of >= 90%, with a faradaic efficiency of >= 86%. VN and Pd/VN incorporated into a membrane electrode assembly in a paired electrolysis system shows potential for large-scale biomass conversion and upgrading. Theoretical calculations reveal that the higher performance of VN for the production of ECO can be attributed to its lower d-band center level relative to the Fermi level compared to that of V2O5, which favors HMF chemisorption and activation. This study paves the way for developing paired electrosynthesis technologies with the potential for biomass utilization and energy conversion.									59	4	0	0	5	0	62			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000480824600001

The following results were obtained: (a) chromatographic analysis with HPLC using an area-ratio method independent of extinction coefficients revealed that 7 +/- 0.5 Chl a are present per 2 Pheo; (b) based on highly sensitive silver staining of proteins and its densitometric evaluation, the contamination by CP47 was estimated to be 4%, i.e., no more than 0.8 Chl can be ascribed to this Chl a binding protein; (c) measurements of laser flash induced absorption changes at 830 nm as a function of the pulse energy indicate that under light saturating conditions one P680(+.)Pheo(-.) radical pair can be formed per 7-8 Chl a; (d) based on the saturation behavior of the different decay components of the absorption changes and on a comparison of the absorption and single photon counting fluorescence data, the 5-ns component is inferred to originate from 'disconnected' Chi. These results lead to the conclusion that functionally fully competent D1/D2/cytb(559) complexes contain 6 Chl per 2 Pheo.

W38) plants with an antisense gene directed against the mRNA of the small subunit of Rubisco were used to investigate the role of O-2 as an electron acceptor during photosynthesis. The reduction in Rubisco has reduced the capacity for CO2-fixation in these plants without a similar reduction in electron transport capacity. Concurrent measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and CO2 assimilation at different CO2 and O-2 partial pressures showed close linear relationships between chloroplast electron transport rates calculated from chlorophyll fluorescence and those calculated from CO2-fixation, These relationships were similar for wild-type and transgenic plants, indicating that the reduced capacity for CO2 fixation in the transgenic plants did not result in extra electron transport not associated with the photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) or photorespiratory carbon oxidation (PCO) cycle. This was further investigated with mass spectrometric measurements of O-16(2) and O-18(2) exchange made concurrently with measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence. In all tobacco lines the rates of O-18(2) uptake in the dark were similar to the O-18(2) uptake rates at very high CO, partial pressures in the light. Rates of oxygenase activity calculated from O-18(2) uptake at the compensation point were linearly related to the Rubisco content of leaves. The ratios of oxygenase to carboxylase rates were calculated from measurements of O-16(2) evolution and O-18(2) uptake at the compensation point. These ratios were lower in the transgenic plants, consistent with their higher CO2 compensation points, It is concluded that although there may be some electron transport to O-2 to balance conflicting demands of NADPH to ATP requirements, this flux must decrease in proportion with the reduced demand for ATP and NADPH consumption in the transgenic lines, The altered balance between electron transport and Rubisco capacity, however, does not result in rampant electron transport to O-2 or other electron transport accepters in the absence of PCR and PCO cycle activity.

The mineralized quartz veins are hosted by similar to E- and NE-trending fault/fracture sets cutting the western boundary of the intrusion and sheared ophiolites. The results of electron microprobe analyses of gold-associated hydrothermal sulfide and silicate minerals suggest that Au was mobilized alongside Ni, Co, Cr and As from the adjacent ophiolitic serpentinite. After granite emplacement, hydrothermal fluids interacted with the sheared serpentinite, leaching metals and re-depositing them in the faults/fractures and adjacent wall rock in a cyclic process. Low-salinity aqueous-carbonic fluids with significant quantities of volatile species (CO2, CH4, and N-2 +/- A H2S) leached and transported Au from deep to shallow crustal levels. Carbon dioxide had a buffering effect on the Au-bearing hydrothermal solution, maintaining its pH within a narrow near-neutral range, where elevated gold concentration was transported by complexation with reduced magmatic sulfur in a reducing environment. Gold deposition along fault/fracture conduits in the Fawakhir granite and adjacent serpentinite resulted from interplay of pressure drop, fluctuations in oxygen and sulfur fugacities, and exsolution of the volatile phases. Infiltration of meteoric water may have contributed to the formation of the late stage gold-sulfide mineralization that formed at shallower levels during terrane uplift. Sulfidation of the Fe-rich magmatic minerals was, on the other hand, the overriding process in the wall rock as evidenced by abundant disseminated sulfides with gold inclusions. Considering the structural control by regional shear zones (fluid conduits) and the voluminous granitic and ophiolitic rocks (metal sources), a high tonnage gold deposit amenable to open pit mining at the El-Sid mine area is very likely.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			1437-3254	1437-3262		WOS:000351519400007

The aim of this study is to identify the photophysical processes that dictate the quenching of emission from defect states upon surface modification and the role of different defects such as zinc interstitials (Zn-i) or oxygen vacancies (V-O) beside the photophysical processes in determining the photocatalytic efficiency of plate-like ZnO nanostructures. For controlling the intrinsic defect state densities of ZnO nanoplates, which is difficult to achieve, their surface was modified using different polymers such as PMMA and PVA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy were employed to identify and quantify the defect states. The analysis of relative defect state densities of Zn-i or V-O showed that Zn-i significantly impacts the photocatalytic activity (PCA) besides V-O, but it has a lower influence than V-O because of the difference in the accessibility and intrinsic nature of these two defects. Synchronous quenching of emission from different defect states with different formation energies and its correlation with the photocatalytic activity led us to conclude that photophysical processes such as concentration-dependent Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), charge transfer (CT) and Zn-i defects play a significant role behind PCA, which has been previously reported to be influenced by V-O only. FRET and CT also play a critical role behind emission quenching upon surface modification. Upon the surface modification of nanoplates, a drop in the quantum efficiency from 12.14% to 4.44% was observed with the fine-tuning of emission colour from bluish-white to blue. Besides the defect states, FRET and CT phenomena are dominant in reducing the quantum efficiency of hybrid light-emitting diodes (HyLEDs) and photocatalytic efficiency. Therefore, the work outlines the reason behind the suppression of luminescence and photocatalytic efficiency of ZnO nanoparticles after surface modification and how to optimise them for their applications as an emissive layer in HyLEDs and efficient photocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000741636800001	35019914

To the growing evidence of non-canonical roles for RNase P RNP subunits including regulation of chromatin structure and function, we add here a role for the rice RNase P Rpp30 in innate immunity. This protein (encoded by LOC_Os11g01074) was uncovered as the top hit in yeast two-hybrid assays performed with the rice histone deacetylase HDT701 as bait. We showed that HDT701 and OsRpp30 are localized to the rice nucleus, OsRpp30 expression increased post-infection by Pyricularia oryzae (syn. Magnaporthe oryzae), and OsRpp30 deacetylation coincided with HDT701 overexpression in vivo. Overexpression of OsRpp30 in transgenic rice increased expression of defence genes and generation of reactive oxygen species after pathogen-associated molecular pattern elicitor treatment, outcomes that culminated in resistance to a fungal (P. oryzae) and a bacterial (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae) pathogen. Knockout of OsRpp30 yielded the opposite phenotypes. Moreover, HA-tagged OsRpp30 co-purified with RNase P pre-tRNA cleavage activity. Interestingly, OsRpp30 is conserved in grass crops, including a near-identical C-terminal tail that is essential for HDT701 binding and defence regulation. Overall, our results suggest that OsRpp30 plays an important role in rice immune response to pathogens and provides a new approach to generate broad-spectrum disease-resistant rice cultivars.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			1467-7644	1467-7652		WOS:000651196700001	33932077	
J	Nie, Li; Cai, Shi-Yu; Sun, Jiao; Chen, Jiong								MicroRNA-155 promotes pro-inflammatory functions and augments apoptosis of monocytes/macrophages during Vibrio anguillarum infection in ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis								FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY				86				70	81		10.1016/j.fsi.2018.11.030				MAR 2019	2019	Upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern-recognition receptors, immune cells are recruited, and multiple antibacterial/viral signaling pathways are activated, leading to the production of immune-related cytokines, chemokines, and interferons along with further activation of the adaptive immune response. MicroRNAs (miRs) play essential roles in regulating such immune signaling pathways, as well as the biological activities of immune cells; however, knowledge regarding the roles of miRs in the immune-related function of monocytes/macrophages (MO/M Phi) remains limited in teleosts. In the present study, we addressed the effects of miR-155 on Vibrio anguillarum-infected MO/M Phi. Our results showed that miR-155 augmented MO/M Phi expression of proinflammatory cytokines and attenuated the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, the phagocytosis and bacteria-killing abilities of these cells were boosted by miR-155 administration, which also promoted M1-type polarization but inhibited M2-type polarization. Furthermore, the V. anguillarum-infection-induced apoptosis was also enhanced by miR-155 mimic transfection, which might have been due to excessive inflammation or the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. These results represent the first report providing a detailed account of the regulatory roles of miR-155 on MO/M Phi functions in teleosts and offer insight into the evolutionary history of miR-155-mediated regulation of host immune responses.									20	2	0	0	15	0	23			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000459528400009	30447432

The Sarvian quartz diorite intruded the surrounding Permian to Tertiary limy formation, culminated in thermal metamorphism as well as skarnification in which the Sarvian deposit formed. Microthermometry studies in the Sarvian skarn deposit reveal two distinct inclusion groups; group A with medium-high temperature and hypersaline and group B with low-medium temperature and low salinity. Group A inclusions which are entrapped during formation of prograde are thought to be derived from the magmatic source. Fluid boiling and subsequent developing of hydraulic fracturing led to inflow and/ or mixing of early magmatic fluids (group A) with circulating ground-water culminated in formation of low salinity and low temperature fluid inclusions (group B) during the formation of retrograde assemblage. Fluid inclusion thermometry reveals the formation temperature and the salinity of 300-370 degrees C and 31-33 wt% NaCl for the prograde stage and 180-230 degrees C and 1-15 wt% NaCl for the retrograde stage of skarnification at Sarvian skarn rocks. Fe-mineralization as well as hydrothermal minerals occurred during retrograde metasomatism. The estimated depth and pressure of occurrence for prograde stage are 1000-1200 m and 100-150 bars, and for retrograde stage, these are about 200 m and 50 bars, respectively. Garnet and pyroxene, as the main constituent minerals of prograde stage, are the most informative minerals offering a suitable tool to constrain the skarnification conditions. Garnets in the Sarvian deposit are mainly grossular and andradite, showing both normal and inverse zoning as the result of variation in their chemical composition. Such types of zoning represent alternation of high acidity oxidation and low acidity oxidation conditions that were prevailed on skarnification in the Sarvian prograde assemblage. Also, chemical composition of the Sarvian pyroxenes shows an alternation of high oxygen fugacity and low oxygen fugacity conditions for their formation. This is also supported by fluctuation of the ratios of andradite to grossular and diopside to hedenbergite, denoting to an obvious shifting that was prevailed between oxidizing and redox conditions during formation of prograde assemblage in the Sarvian. Garnet-pyroxene thermometry determines the formation temperature of prograde assemblage between 370 and 550 degrees C at Sarvian skarn rocks which is verified also by fluid inclusion thermometry. Decomposition of limestone by reaction of high-temperature hydrothermal fluids with carbonate host rock resulted in injection of CO2 into the Sarvian system that caused oxidation, changing Fe+2 to Fe+3 culminated in the magnetite deposition.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1866-7511	1866-7538		WOS:000394012200005

Both the first polymer (PAQTDPP) and the second polymer (PAQBTDPP) comprise anthraquinone (AQ) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as the acceptor1 and acceptor2 components. In contrast, where PAQTDPP incorporates thiophene as the donor, PAQBTDPP incorporates the bithiophene moiety as the donor. Later, two n-n inorganic/organic nano-heterostructures (NHs)-N-TiO2/PAQTDPP and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP-were fabricated using nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanorods (N-TiO2 NRs) and PAQTDPP and PAQBTDPP polymers on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate. The N-TiO2/PAQTDPP and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH materials were utilized as the photoanodes for visible light photoelectrochemical water splitting. At 1.23 V-RHE, the N-TiO2 NR, N-TiO2/PAQTDPP NH, and N-TiO2/PAQBTDPP NH photoanodes exhibited a photocurrent density of 0.157 mA cm(-2), 0.504 mA cm(-2), and 0.397 mA cm(-2) (@10 mV s(-1)), respectively, in a 0.5 M aq. Na2SO4 electrolyte. The inorganic/organic nano-hybrid photoanodes also exhibited cathodically shifted water oxidation onset potential compared to the N-TiO2 NR electrode. The augmented photoelectrochemical performances of the inorganic/organic nano-hybrid materials are attributable to the absorption capability of a broader spectrum of visible light by the polymers, suitable band alignment between the inorganic and organic components of the heterojunction, and better and faster-photogenerated charge carrier separation and transportation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000782203500001

Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae are important pathogenic bacteria responsible for different infectious diseases in several animal species. In the present study, a whole blood culture with S. aureus, E. coli, or S. agalactiae and flow cytometry were used to investigate, whether stimulation with different bacterial species induces different immunomodulation patterns in camel leukocytes. The expression of different cell surface myeloid markers and cell adhesion molecules on monocytes and neutrophils was investigated. In addition, the capacity of monocytes and neutrophils to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) was analyzed. Results Stimulation with either of the bacterial species resulted in the expansion of the camel CD14(high)MHCII(high) monocyte subset with a reduced fraction of CD14(high)MHCII(low) monocytes. For the CD14(low)MHCII(high) monocytes, however, only stimulation with S. aureus or S. agalactiae increased their fractions in blood. Although all bacterial species elicited the upregulation of cell surface MHC class II molecules on granulocytes, the increase was, however, highest on cells stimulated with S. aureus. The expression levels of the two adhesion molecules, CD11a and CD18, on neutrophils and monocytes were differently affected by bacterial stimulation. Functionally, E. coli failed to stimulate ROS production in monocytes, while induced a strong ROS production response in granulocytes. S. agalactiae elicited a week ROS production in granulocytes when compared to the other two pathogens. Conclusions The different responsiveness of monocytes and granulocytes toward different bacterial species indicates different host-pathogen interaction mechanisms for the two cell populations. In addition, the phenotypic and functional differences between cells stimulated with E. coli, S. aureus, or S. agalactiae suggests pathogen-species-specific modulating effects of the bacterial pathogens on the camel innate myeloid cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1746-6148		WOS:000674337300001	34247606

Herein, a facile in situ growth strategy is developed to implant single-atom cobalt in polymeric carbon nitride (pCN) via the bidentate ligand for efficient photocatalytic degradation of oxytetracycline (OTC). The atomic characterizations indicate that single-atom cobalt is successfully anchored on pCN by covalently forming the Co-O bond and Co-N bond, which will strengthen the interaction between single-atom cobalt and pCN. This single-atom cobalt can efficiently expand optical absorption, increase electron density, facilitate charge separation and transfer, and promote OTC degradation. As the optimal sample, Co(1.28%)-pCN presents an outstanding apparent rate constant for OTC degradation (0.038 min(-1)) under visible light irradiation, which is about 3.7 times than that of the pristine pCN. The electron spin resonance (ESR) tests and reactive species trapping experiments demonstrate that the(1)O(2), h(+), center dot O-2(-), and center dot OH are responsible for OTC degradation. This work develops a new way to construct single-atom-modified pCN and provides a green and highly efficient strategy for refractory antibiotics removal.									136	3	0	0	33	0	135			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000541504300001	32567191	
J	Zhang, Fulin; Wang, Fangqin; Li, Dahui								Cloning and molecular characterization of a ferulate-5-hydroxylase gene from water chestnuts (Trapa bicornis Osbeck.)								JOURNAL OF PLANT BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY				27	2			139	146		10.1007/s13562-017-0422-x				APR 2018	2018	Ferulate 5-hydroxylase (F5H), a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, has been indicated to function in the monolignol biosynthesis of sinapyl alcohol, namely the precursor of syringyl lignin during phenylpropanoid metabolism. In the present study, a full-length cDNA clone encoding F5H, designated as TbF5H1, was cloned from water chestnuts (Trapa bicornis Osbeck.) using RT-PCR and RACE. Sequence analysis of TbF5H1 protein revealed the presence of highly conserved motifs shard by P450 s, such as heme binding cysteine, oxygen binding I-helix, and E-R-R triade. Subsequently, TbF5H1 was expressed in bacterial system as a recombinant protein, which was used to ascertain kinetic parameters of the protein with the K-m and V-max values of 2.40 mu M and 3.35 pkat mg(-1), respectively. Together with high identity with other plant F5Hs based amino acid sequences, this result suggested that TbF5H1 had a biological function similar to its homologues in S lignin synthesis. Western blotting analysis using anti-TbF5H1 serum towards total proteins extracted from roots, stems, leaves, and flowers, detected a protein with a molecular weight of about 57 kDa. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed the transcript level of TbF5H1 was higher in leaves than in other tested tissues. Interestingly, TbF5H1 was differentially expressed in response to various stresses, including salt (NaCl), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and heavy metal (lead), as well as elicitation by methyl ester jasmonate (MeJA). The expression of TbF5H1 was not significantly altered under NaCl or lead stress conditions, whereas a significant increase in TbF5H1 expression was detected after elicitation of H2O2 and MeJA, respectively. Moreover, there existed a fine coordination between expression of TbF5H1 and contents of certain nonenzymatic antioxidants. These results indicated that integrated with some redox components, TbF5H1 gene should contribute to the acclimation of T. bicornis to oxidative stress, which is modulated by MeJA.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0971-7811	0974-1275		WOS:000429255200002

In the study presented here, the catalyst mass-dependence of the activity of such nanostructured WOC electrodes and their activity and stability in phosphate buffer electrolytes over nearly the entire pH range (pH 1-14) was explored. For all pH values, current densities of >1 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials eta of 350-500 mV were observed, which are very good values for electrodes containing only earth-abundant elements (Mn, O and C in this case). The very decent performance observed for the mildly acidic pH regime (pH 2-6) was especially noteworthy. For the dependence of eta on the pH, an ideal Nernstian behaviour was detected for the pH window pH 1-10. Above pH 10, a pronounced deviation from the expected trend was found, as most electro-kinetic parameters indicated even higher activities for the strongly alkaline regime. Concerning anode stabilities, current-densities of 2 mA cm(-2) could be maintained at all studied pHs over at least 24 h of continuous operation. Pre- and post-operando spectroscopic analyses (e.g. vibrational and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy) revealed only minor changes of the catalyst structure, composition, morphology or the average Mn oxidation state induced by the electrocatalytic operation, which confirms the good stabilities found in the electrochemical measurements. Thus, we report on an earth-abundant, easily-prepared type of WOC electrode, which exhibits promising activities and stabilities for applications in alkaline, neutral and even acidic electrolytes.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000498556500012

The as-prepared membranes exhibited the highly interconnected, homogeneously distributed and smooth surfaced PVdF-HFP nanofibers, in which the face centered cubic nickel (Ni)/Ni-cobalt (Ni-Co) nanoparticles were uniformly anchored. The Ni:Co(0.5:0.5) content in PVdF-HFP nanofibers exhibited the excellent electrochemical properties toward urea electrooxidation as substantiated from the higher anodic current and lower onset potential in comparison with the other compositions of Ni and Co prepared under the similar conditions. Under the optimized conditions, PVdF-HFP/Ni-Co(0.5:0.5) membrane showed the superior electrochemical performances toward non-enzymatic urea detection, offering the rapid response time, lower detection limit, high sensitivity and wide linear range of 5 s, 12 mu M, 2.4 mu AmM-1 cm(-2) and 20 mu M - 2 mM, respectively. Owing to the robust frameworks, excellent electrical conductivity, large surface area and extended active sites of PVdF-HFP/Ni-Co(0.5:0.5) membrane, the constructed urea sensor exhibited an excellent stability and favorable reproducibility toward urea oxidation and also endowed its applications in human urine samples with the analytical reliability. These findings embrace the unique strategy for the fabrication of freestanding and binder free electrodes and construct the new possibilities toward the utilization of electrospun polymeric electrodes in urea electooxidation and its precise detection.

J	Christen, G; Karge, M; Eckert, HJ; Renger, G								The role of protonation steps in electron transfer reactions in Tris-treated photosystem 2 membrane fragments								PHOTOSYNTHETICA				33	3-4			529	539						1997	1997	The influence of H/D-exchange on the electron transfer from Y-Z to P680(+.), and the recombination reaction between P680(+.) and Q(A)(-.) in Tris-treated photosystem 2 (PS2) membrane fragments at pL [L=lyonium ion (H,D)] = 6.5 was investigated by monitoring and numerical analysis of flash-induced absorption changes at 830 and 320 nm, respectively. The H/D-exchange caused retardation by a factor of approximately 3 of the electron transfer from Y-Z to P680(+.). In marked contrast, no significant effect was observed on the kinetics of P680(+.)Q(A)(-.) charge recombination. In addition, the pH-dependence of P680(+.)Q(A)(-.) recombination kinetics were analysed in samples where Y-Z was functionally eliminated by exposure of Tris-treated PS2 fragments to strong irradiance. In this case the relaxation kinetics could be fitted by three-exponentials with half lifetimes of 150 mu s (fast), 800 mu s (middle) and 10 ms (slow) at pH = 6.0. The fast and middle kinetics were only slightly dependent on pH in the range from 5.0 to 8.0. On the other hand, the normalised amplitudes of these kinetics were markedly pH-dependent. Furthermore, the normalised extent of the slow kinetics was significantly larger in the absorption changes at 320 nm, reflecting the turnover of Q(A), than at 830 nm as an indicator of P680(+.) formation and decay. One possible explanation of this feature is provided by an assumption that Tris-washed PS2 membrane fragments exposed to a strong irradiance contain a redox component competing with Q(A)(-.) in the reduction of P680(+.). Furthermore, the pH-dependent changes of the overall kinetics of P680(+.)Q(A)(-.) recombination originated predominantly from different ratios of the extent of the fast and middle components rather than from marked modifications of the rate constants.					9th Workshop on Photosynthesis9th Workshop on Photosynthesis	APR 11-14, 1996APR 11-14, 1996	Deut Forschungsgemeinsch; Humboldt Univ, Inst BiolDeut Forschungsgemeinsch; Humboldt Univ, Inst Biol	WUSTERHAUSEN, GERMANYWUSTERHAUSEN, GERMANY	21	0	0	0	17	0	21			0300-3604			WOS:A1997YA11100020

The isotopic and elemental data are used to evaluate effects of post-depositional alteration of Sr-87/Sr-86 and delta-C-13. Using our present best estimates for unaltered samples, we construct a new delta-C-13-curve for 850 500 Ma marine carbonates using data in this paper and from literature sources. Delta-C-13 values are high (+4 to +8 parts per thousand) during most of the late Riphean (ca. 900-600 Ma) with brief negative excursions likely associated with glacial periods. Similarly, in the Vendian delta-C-13 falls sharply (from late Riphean highs) to < -3 parts per thousand around the Varanger glaciation (ca. 600 Ma), and then returns to high values (+4 to +2 parts per thousand) remaining until the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary where the curve drops to a value of about -1 parts per thousand in Lower Cambrian carbonates. Coupling of the Sr and C isotopic data is used to develop a simple model for evaluating organic carbon (C(org)) burial in Late Proterozoic oceans. These calculations indicate that C(org) burial rates were lower than present-day values during much of the late Riphean, at the same time that erosion rates were low. Excess O2 produced by the burial of C(org) was likely balanced by oxidation of reduced hydrothermal fluids and weathering reactions. Near the time of the Varanger glaciation, C(org) burial rates dropped but quickly recovered and reached a maximum (a factor of 2-4 greater than present day) in Vendian sediments. High C(org) burial rates were probably driven by high sedimentation rates, and possibly high productivity. The high C(org) burial rate likely gave rise to a large flux of O2; high values of delta-S-34 in Late Proterozoic marine sulfates suggest that this O2 flux was not balanced by increased sulfate formation. Further, the Sr-isotopic record indicates that excess O2 was not balanced by oxidation of submarine hydrothermal fluids. Increased oxidative weathering was probably an important sink for O2; nonetheless, we conclude that a significant and rapid increase in atmospheric O2 occurred in the Vendian. These results have important implications for environmental changes during the first appearance of an Ediacaran metazoan fauna.									475	95	12	0	52	5	562			0016-7037			WOS:A1992HJ96300033

To get more insights into conditioning, a PEMEC with Ir-coated gas diffusion electrode (IrGDE) was investigated by electrochemistry and in situ visualization characterization techniques. The changes of polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), and bubble dynamics before and after conditioning are analyzed. The polarization curves show that the cell efficiency increased by 9.15% at 0.4 A/cm(2), and the EIS and Tafel slope results indicate that both the ohmic and activation overpotential losses decrease after conditioning. The visualization of bubble formation unveils that the number of bubble sites increased greatly from 14 to 29 per pore after conditioning, at the same voltage of 1.6 V. Under the same current density of 0.2 A/cm(2); the average bubble detachment size decreased obviously from 35 to 25 mu m. The electrochemistry and visualization characterization results jointly unveiled the increase of reaction sites and the surface oxidation on the IrGDE during conditioning, which provides more insights into the conditioning and benefits for the future GDE design and optimization.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000757903900001	35142208

Here we report a metal-free nanozyme of modified graphitic carbon nitride and demonstrate its bifunctional enzyme-mimicking roles. With oxidase mimicking, hydrogen peroxide is generated from the coupled photocatalysis of glucose oxidation and dioxygen reduction under visible-light irradiation with a near 100% apparent quantum efficiency. Then, the in situ generated hydrogen peroxide serves for the subsequent peroxidase-mimicking reaction that oxidises a chromogenic substrate on the same catalysts in dark to complete the bifunctional oxidase-peroxidase for biomimetic detection of glucose. The bifunctional cascade catalysis is successfully demonstrated in microfluidics for the real-time colorimetric detection of glucose with a low detection limit of 0.8 mu M within 30 s. The artificial nanozymes with physiological functions provide the feasible strategies for mimicking the natural enzymes and realizing the biomedical diagnostics with a smart and miniature device.									241	16	0	0	47	0	241			2041-1723			WOS:000459704600004	30808912	
J	Mishra, SR; Sabat, SC								Effect of magnesium and calcium ions on the photoelectron transport activity of low-salt suspended Hydrilla verticillata thylakoids: Possible sites of cation interaction								ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATURFORSCHUNG C-A JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES				53	9-10			849	856						SEP-OCT 1998	1998	Stimulatory effect of divalent cations like calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) was investigated on electron transport activity of divalent cation deficient low-salt suspended (LS) thylakoid preparation from a submerged aquatic angiosperm, Hydrilla verticillata. Both the cations stimulated electron transport activity of LS-suspended thylakoids having an intact water oxidation complex. But in hydroxylamine (NH2OH) - or alkaline Tris - washed thylakoid preparations (with the water oxidation enzyme impaired), only Ca2+ dependent stimulation of electron transport activity was found. The apparent K-m of Ca2+ dependent stimulation of electron flow from H2O (endogenous) or from artificial electron donor (exogenous) to dichlorophenol indophenol (acceptor) was found to be identical. Calcium supported stimulation of electron transport activity in NH2OH - or Tris - washed thylakoids was electron donor selective, i.e., Ca2+ ion was only effective in electron flow with diphenylcarbazide but not with NH2OH as electron donor to photosystem II. A magnesium effect was observed in thylakoids having an intact water oxidation complex and the ion became unacceptable in NH2OH - or Tris - washed thylakoids. Indirect experimental evidences have been presented to suggest that Mg2+ interacts with the water oxidation complex, while the Ca2+ interaction is localized between Y-z and reaction center of photosystem II.									0	0	0	0	1	0	1			0939-5075			WOS:000076790000011

The present investigation carried out on the phase pure alpha & beta MoO3 thin film shows that the low bandgap beta-MoO3 possesses a mis-alignment with the water oxidation potential, while a more suitable band alignment is observed for the comparatively large bandgap alpha-MoO3. Both experimental and DFT calculations show that the valence edge of the orthorhombic (alpha-MoO3) phase is located at a higher energy (0.9 eV higher in VB-XPS and 1 eV higher in the DOS plots) than the monoclinic (beta-MoO3) phase, while the conduction edge value is roughly at the same energy level (-2.5 eV) in both polymorphs. Based on the above investigations, an all oxide heterojunction comprising of beta-MoO3/alpha-MoO3 is found to be suitable for improved PEC performance due to favourable energy band diagram and increased visible light absorption in beta-MoO3. Significantly higher cathodic photocurrent is observed for the beta-MoO3/alpha-MoO3 (1.6 mA/cm(2) at applied bias of -0.3V(RHE) under simulated 1 sun irradiation) as compared to the very low anodic response in beta-MoO3 (similar to 1.0 nA/cm(2)) and alpha-MoO3 (32 mu A/cm(2)).

Four glaucony types with complex textural and compositional features have been recognized in cores of the Georgiev Formation of the West Siberian Basin. Samples exclusively made of light green type 1 glaucony (K2O < 6.5%: the less mature type, richer in glauconite-smectite mixed layer) formed under dysoxic conditions in the deepest distal marine environments of the northern sectors of the West Siberian Basin. Dark green type 2 glaucony is the most mature (richest in glauconitic mica: K2O up to 8.5%), is sometimes associated with type 1 glaucony, and is typical of high bottom areas with a low sedimentation rate within the central sectors of the basin. Type 3 glaucony is formed by brown grains, poorer in K and Fe but richer in Al and Si than type 2 glaucony, and is only present in strongly condensed successions of the central-eastern sectors of the West Siberian Basin. Type 4 glaucony is much richer in Fe than any other type, shows fresh yellowish green cores slightly less mature than type 2 glaucony, and brown rims and cracks with composition similar to that of type 3 grains; it was formed in western sectors of the West Siberian Basin, close to Urals. Weathering under a subtropical to temperate climate, and erosion of badly drained peneplaned lowland areas around the basin, provided Al-rich terrigenous clays as substratum for glauconitization, which explains Al and Si enrichment in Siberian glaucony. Maturation from glauconite-smectite to glauconitic mica is monitored by a change from light to dark green colour related to decrease in Al, Si, Mg, Ca and Na, and to increase in K and Fe. Brown rims of type 4 glaucony, and brown type 3 grains formed after leaching of Fe and K from mature glauconite, with formation of clays and Fe oxyhydroxides as reaction products, as a result of free oxygen exposure related to a hydrodynamic regime and temporary sea-level fall. Glauconitization stopped and diagenetic pyrite formed due to basin deepening and burial under black shales during the latest Jurassic-earliest Cretaceous transgression. This study demonstrates that, due to the complex nature of glaucony, the authigenesis of glauconitic minerals in the rock record cannot be correctly understood if the palaeoenvironmental context and the palaeogeographical context of glaucony-bearing sediments are not considered.									29	7	0	0	5	0	34			0037-0746	1365-3091		WOS:000250945600008

Arrayed waveguide gratings (called AWG's or PHASAR's) have become key components in modern WDM systems for their multi-functional and multi-application properties. Silicon oxynitride (SiOxNy) grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is well-suited for the realized application of high contrast waveguides for the range of the refractive index can be largely tuned (1.45-2.0). Except that, the waveguides based on the usage of a SiOxNy core and silicon oxide cladding layers can be fabricated using conventional VLSI fabrication techniques.SiOxNy AWG device with 3% refractive index difference (A) and the transmission spectrum of AWG's device indicated the insertion loss, crosstalk and side-lobe were lower than -3 dB, -15 dB and -40 dB, respectively, by 3D beam propagation method were investigated in this study. The chip size of the whole device is smaller than 4 cm x 1.5 cm, and the highest coupling loss of the rib waveguide for single mode fiber was about -1.6 dB. Based on the simulation results, the device can be really fabricated by thin-film deposition, photo-lithography and dry-etching processes.Reduced the ratio of oxygen to nitrogen in the process gas resulted in the characteristics of the film approaching to silicon nitride films with higher refractive index, extinction coefficient and residual stress. Simultaneously, the films possessed lower Si-O bonds, and higher Si-N and N-H bonds. Oppositely, increased the ratio of oxygen to nitrogen, the characteristics of deposited films tend to silica films formation. Microstructural evolution analysis revealed over-supplied silicon atoms would form silicon nano-crystallized structure in the amorphous optical films for lower N2O/(N-2+NH3) ratio, and resulted in higher refractive index and extinction coefficient. From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) features of rib-type silicon oxynitride waveguide, we found the profile, and the roughness of side- and top-walls of waveguide reached to the manufacturing criteria of AWG device. We had successfully fabricated an AWG device with 8 channels and 1.6mn channel spacing, and the coupling loss and propagation loss were about -2.24 dB and -0.15 dB/cm, respectively. While, the AWG device performances need further improvements by modified design, uniform thin film deposition, and accurate dry-etching processes.

J	Qiu, Siqi; Guo, Renbo; Wang, Qingyu; Yang, Feng; Han, Yibo; Peng, Xiaoniu; Yuan, Hui; Wang, Xina								CdS nanoflakes decorated by Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH				45	10			14985	14994		10.1002/er.6777		MAY 2021		AUG 2021	2021	P-type Ni(OH)(2) has been combined with n-type CdS nanorods and nanocrystals for enhanced photocatalytic property due to the p-n junction. Though CdS nanosheets exhibit fast charge transfer and large superficial area, the decoration of Ni(OH)(2) was rarely reported up to now. In this work, the photo-deposition of Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles on CdS ultrathin nanoflakes was established for efficient photocatalytic H-2 generation. By changing the irradiation time of CdS, the reaction between Ni2+ and OH- can be controlled for different loading density of Ni(OH)(2). As the loading density-dependent morphology, light absorption, carrier separation and transfer were systematically studied for the composites, an obvious band gap narrowing from 2.28 to 2.08 eV was revealed, and the carrier separation and transfer between the CdS nanoflakes and Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles have been enhanced for the composites with deposition time of 3 minutes. These together with the alignment of type "II" bands and the high specific surface area of the flakes and nanoparticles, lead to an optimum H-2 generation of 20.14 mmol/g/h, nearly three times of pure CdS (7.97 mmol/g/h). Such a study not only provides a deposition method of Ni(OH)(2), but also sheds light on the enhancement strategy for photocatalytic property by controlling the microstructure and aligning the hetero-structured bands.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000648309900001

However, the core-shell metal metaphosphates with high energy density in supercapacitor application is rarely reported. Here, the core shell structured Ni(OH)(2)/Ni(PO3)(2) (NNP) hybrid electrode were prepared by one-step electrodeposition, which exhibits a superior specific capacitance of 1477 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1). Furthermore, an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) based on NNP hybrid composite as cathode and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as anode is assembled successfully to deliver a prominent energy density of 67 Wh kg(-1) at 775 W kg(-1) and splendid stability with capacitance retention of 81% after 8000 cycles. The outstanding electrochemical capabilities are attributed to the porous nanoflake and hierarchical core-shell structure of NNP hybrid composite, which can accelerate ion diffusion and charge transfer in redox reaction. These results indicate that nanohybrid NNP material has promise to be an advanced energy storage material. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Upon application of a reverse bias, the ordinarily slow water dissociation reaction at the AEL/CEL junction of the BPM is dramatically accelerated by the large electric field at the interface and by the presence of catalyst in the junction. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), we have found a counterbalanced role of the electric field and the junction catalyst in accelerating water dissociation in a BPM. Experimental BPMs were prepared from a crosslinked AEL and a Nafion CEL, with a graphite oxide (GO) catalyst deposited at the junction using layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly. BPMs with an interfacial catalyst layer were found to have smaller electric fields at the interface compared to samples with no added catalyst. A comprehensive numerical simulation model showed that the damping of the electric field in BPMs with a catalyst layer is a result of a higher water dissociation product (H+/OH-) flux, which neutralizes the net charge density of the CEL and AEL. This conclusion is further substantiated by EIS studies of a high-performance 3D junction BPM that shows a low electric field due to the facile catalytic generation and transport of H+ and OH-. Numerical modeling of these effects in the BPM provides a prescription for designing membranes that function at lower overpotential. The potential drop across the synthetic BPM was lower than that of a commercial BPM by more than 200 mV at >100 mA cm(-2) reverse bias current density, with the two membranes having similar long-term stability.									63	1	0	0	5	0	63			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000442262900031		
J	Onsuratoom, Surakerk; Chavadej, Sumaeth; Sreethawong, Thammanoon								Hydrogen production from water splitting under UV light irradiation over Ag-loaded mesoporous-assembled TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide nanocrystal photocatalysts								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				36	9			5246	5261		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.01.176				MAY 2011	2011	Hydrogen production from the photocatalytic water splitting reaction is very attractive because it is an environmentally friendly process, where hydrogen is produced from two abundantly renewable sources, i.e. water and solar energy, with the aid of photocatalysts. TiO2 is the most widely investigated photocatalyst; however, it alone still exhibits low performance to photocatalytically produce hydrogen. Hence, the aim of this work focused on the enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production over Ag-loaded mesoporous-assembled TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide nanocrystal photocatalysts under UV light irradiation. The TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides with various TiO2-to-ZrO2 molar ratios were synthesized by a sol gel process with the aid of a structure-directing surfactant, followed by Ag loading via a photochemical deposition method. The influences of photocatalyst preparation parameters, i.e. calcination temperature, phase composition, and Ag loading, were studied. The results revealed that the mesoporous-assembled TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide nanocrystal photocatalyst with a TiO2-to-ZrO2 molar ratio of 93:7 calcined at 500 degrees C exhibited the highest photocatalytic hydrogen production activity, and the Ag loading of 0.5 wt.% further greatly enhanced the photocatalytic activity of such TiO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide photocatalyst.

The effects of nocturnal chilling temperature (4-6 t) on the chlorophyll a fluorescence was explored in seedlings of two tropical ravine rainforest tree species, Antho-cephalus chinensis and Barringtonia macrostachya. A. chinensis is a fast growing, pioneer tree species in the ravine rainforest and B. macroslachya is an intermediate canopy layer tree species and its seedlings distribute in the understory. Seedlings of the two species were grown under four different light intensities (8 %, 25 %, 50% and 100% full sunlight), and diurnal, stress-induced photoinhibition, and reversible inactivation and/ or damage of PS 1 reaction centers measured. Our results demonstrated that the effects of nocturnal chilling temperature on photoinhibition were significantly intensified under stronger growth light intensities, but its ef-fects were very small under weak growth light intensity (8% sunlight). Fog can decrease light intensity by 60% - 90% in the morning during the foggy and cool season; hence, the results presented above indicate that fog can ameliorate the haimful effect of natural nocturnal chilling temperature on Xishuangbanna tropical plants through decreasing growth light intensity. Under intermediate growth light intensity (50% sunlight), stress-in-duced photoinhibition occurred in untreated B, macrostachya seedlings but not in A. chinensis; furthermore, under the same treatment conditions, the extent of photoinhibition was stronger in B. macrostachya than in A. chinensis. These results suggest that B, macrostachya is more sensitive to temperature-induced photoinhibi-tion. At intermediate and low growth light intensities (25% sunlight), themial dissipation was greater in A. chinensis than in B. macrostachya after nocturnal chilling temperature treatment, suggesting that protection a-gainst photodamage is stronger in A. chinensis. During the period of nocturnal chilling temperature treatment, photoinhibition in the two species was associated with an increase of thermal dissipation and the aggravation of reversible inactivation and/or damage to the PS It reaction center.			于雾凉季测定了叶片叶绿素荧光参数,探讨了4～6℃夜间低温对4种相对光强下生长的两种西双版纳沟谷雨林树苗光系统Ⅱ(PSⅡ)活性的影响及雾对植物的可能保护机制.随夜间低温处理时间延长,不同光强下生长的团花树(Anthocephalus chinensis)和玉蕊(Barringtonia macrostachya)叶片日间和长期光抑制,以及PSⅡ反应中心的可逆失活或破坏加剧,生长环境光越强夜间低温的效应越明显,弱光下其效应不显著.间接表明雾使光强减弱利于缓解自然夜温降低对本区热带植物的影响.中光强下玉蕊对照植株发生了胁迫诱导的光抑制;相同处理条件下玉蕊的光抑制程度均比团花树重,表明玉蕊对夜间低温引起的光抑制更敏感.夜间低温处理后,中等和低光强下团花树的热耗散多于玉蕊,表明其光保护作用较强.夜间低温处理期间两种植物的光抑制与热耗散增多和PSⅡ反应中心的可逆失活或破坏的加剧有关.						0	7	0	0	3	0	7			1005-264X			CSCD:1585889

Intensive investigations revealed that the ternary hybrid with robust and intertwined nanostructures possesses shorter diffusion pathways, smaller diffusion resistance and faster transfer speeds of electrons and ions, which could expedite the transport of electrolyte to flood and interact with reaction sites, dynamically and thermodynamically. Notably, the active Ni3S4 nanorods within the unique integrated ternary hybrid embedded in graphitic C3N4 nanosheets over a conducting substrate of nitrogen-doped graphene could strongly avoid agglomeration, abscission, anisotropic volume expansion and irreversible mechanical failure, even during extreme electrochemical reactions. Owing to the integrated effect, the ternary hybrid delivers excellent electrochemical performance with long-term stability during water splitting and cycling durability when used in sodium-ion batteries. In particular, a low onset potential of 40 mV (vs. RHE, J = -1.5 mA cm(-2)) is observed in the HER process, and the applied potentials are also as small as 1.47 V (vs. RHE) and 1.51 V for the OER and overall water splitting, respectively, at 10 mA cm(-2) under the same alkaline conditions. As for sodium-ion batteries, the ternary hybrid possesses an advanced specific capacity of similar to 670 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) with particularly excellent rate capabilities and it could even work at a high current density.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000459331600023

PLANTA				250	6			2127	2145		10.1007/s00425-019-03290-4		OCT 2019		DEC 2019	2019	Main conclusion HSP60 gene family in pepper was analyzed through bioinformatics along with transcriptional regulation against multiple abiotic and hormonal stresses. Furthermore, the knockdown of CaHSP60-6 increased sensitivity to heat stress. The 60 kDa heat shock protein (HSP60) also known as chaperonin (cpn60) is encoded by multi-gene family that plays an important role in plant growth, development and in stress response as a molecular chaperone. However, little is known about the HSP60 gene family in pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). In this study, 16 putative pepper HSP60 genes were identified through bioinformatic tools. The phylogenetic tree revealed that eight of the pepper HSP60 genes (50%) clustered into group I, three (19%) into group II, and five (31%) into group III. Twelve (75%) CaHSP60 genes have more than 10 introns, while only a single gene contained no introns. Chromosomal mapping revealed that the tandem and segmental duplication events occurred in the process of evolution. Gene ontology enrichment analysis predicted that CaHSP60 genes were responsible for protein folding and refolding in an ATP-dependent manner in response to various stresses in the biological processes category. Multiple stress-related cis-regulatory elements were found in the promoter region of these CaHSP60 genes, which indicated that these genes were regulated in response to multiple stresses. Tissue-specific expression was studied under normal conditions and induced under 2 h of heat stress measured by RNA-Seq data and qRT-PCR in different tissues (roots, stems, leaves, and flowers). The data implied that HSP60 genes play a crucial role in pepper growth, development, and stress responses. Fifteen (93%) CaHSP60 genes were induced in both, thermo-sensitive B6 and thermo-tolerant R9 lines under heat treatment. The relative expression of nine representative CaHSP60 genes in response to other abiotic stresses (cold, NaCl, and mannitol) and hormonal applications [ABA, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), and salicylic acid (SA)] was also evaluated. Knockdown of CaHSP60-6 increased the sensitivity to heat shock treatment as documented by a higher relative electrolyte leakage, lipid peroxidation, and reactive oxygen species accumulation in silenced pepper plants along with a substantial lower chlorophyll content and antioxidant enzyme activity. These results suggested that HSP60 might act as a positive regulator in pepper defense against heat and other abiotic stresses. Our results provide a basis for further functional analysis of HSP60 genes in pepper.									15	1	0	0	12	0	16			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:000492244500001	31606756

The visible light photocatalytic activities of s-SnP and hetero-SnP were demonstrated successfully for the degradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) and acid orange 7 (AO7) in water. The visible light activity of hetero-SnP increased with the ins-SnP loading and was saturated above 77 mg/g-SiO2, which corresponded to the homogeneous concentration of [ins-SnP] = 50 mu M. It is the Q band of SnP (500-650 nm) that is photocatalytically active under visible light, not the Soret band (420-430 nm) whose absorption intensity is much higher. When applied to the degradation of 4-CP and AO7, hetero-SnP was particularly stable and could be used repeatedly without losing the activity whereas the activity of s-SnP was reduced gradually with repeated uses. The photocatalytic degradation reactions of 4-CP, AO7, and other organic substrates were studied systematically to show that the operating mechanisms are very different depending on the kind of substrates. The properties and activities of s-SnP and hetero-SnP as visible light photocatalysts were investigated in various ways and discussed in detail.									63	4	0	0	21	0	65			1932-7447			WOS:000252287300024

However, the latter two factors may be overcome in two-dimensional (2D) materials with defects. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the behavior of a series of common gas molecules (CO, CO2, NH3, SO2, NO, NO2 and O-2) on defective (S vacancies and non-metal C/N/O doped) MoS2 monolayers in both the 2H and 1T ' phases under biaxial strain (+/- 5%). When defects are introduced, strain can cause the gas molecules around the defects to physically/chemically adsorb, desorb, dissociate or even react with dopant. Meanwhile, the mechanical energy consumed to generate strain can be effectively transferred to change the energy of adsorption/desorption/reaction of adsorbates with an efficiency of at least 15% (if only adsorption strength is altered) up to 200% (if reaction is triggered). Subsequently, a number of interesting phenomena can be observed. For example, the doping-and-undoping cycle (e.g., the C doping of 2H-MoS2 and N doping of 1T '-MoS2 monolayers) can be dynamically controlled by pumping relevant gases and applying proper strain. Reversible adsorption and desorption of NH3 on defective MoS2 monolayers in both phases can be achieved within +/- 3% strain. NO or NO2 and CO can be converted into non-toxic N2O and CO2 over the N-doped (3% strain) and O-doped (- 3% strain) 1T '-MoS2 monolayers. In essence, defective 2D materials can serve as ideal multi-purpose platforms for strain engineering the behaviors of adsorbates.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000533050000001

PHD homologues exist in other types of eukaryotes and prokaryotes where they act on non HIF substrates. To gain insight into the factors underlying different PHD substrates and properties, we carried out biochemical and biophysical studies on PHD homologues from the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, and the protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, both lacking HIF. The respective prolyl-hydroxylases (DdPhyA and TgPhyA) catalyze prolyl-hydroxylation of S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (Skp1), a reaction enabling adaptation to different dioxygen availability. Assays with full-length Skp1 substrates reveal substantial differences in the kinetic properties of DdPhyA and TgPhyA, both with respect to each other and compared with human PHD2; consistent with cellular studies, TgPhyA is more active at low dioxygen concentrations than DdPhyA. TgSkp1 is a DdPhyA substrate and DdSkp1 is a TgPhyA substrate. No cross-reactivity was detected between DdPhyA/TgPhyA substrates and human PHD2. The human Skp1 E147P variant is a DdPhyA and TgPhyA substrate, suggesting some retention of ancestral interactions. Crystallographic analysis of DdPhyA enables comparisons with homologues from humans, Trichoplax adhaerens, and prokaryotes, informing on differences in mobile elements involved in substrate binding and catalysis. In DdPhyA, two mobile loops that enclose substrates in the PHDs are conserved, but the C-terminal helix of the PHDs is strikingly absent. The combined results support the proposal that PHD homologues have evolved kinetic and structural features suited to their specific sensing roles.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3				1083-351X		WOS:000598518600007

Although N-2 constitutes 78.09 % of the earth's atmosphere, however, its conversion to ammonia is strenuous because of its non-polar and triple bond character. To address the burgeoning demand, ammonia is typically synthesized via the conventional energy and capital intensive Haber-Bosch technique utilizing natural gas and releasing tons of (CO2) to the environment. On this basis, cost-effective photon-driven dinitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is aroused thriving attention as a sustainable and eco-friendly process for ammonia production under ambient conditions. Yet, the photocatalytic ammonia production is not up to the mark for industrial application due to low conversion rate, less catalytic selectivity, ambiguous mechanism, and limited faradic or solarto-chemical efficiency. Further, the NRR activity of a catalyst essentially depends upon its electronic and surface texture; hence the fabrication of advanced materials is of paramount interest to enhance the performance. The present review covers the underlying mechanism of N-2 photoreduction, prevailing theories, different catalytic engineering techniques, various detection methods, and critical challenges encountered in the theme of photofixation of dinitrogen to ammonia. Additionally, the overarching goal of this review is to bestow an outline of recent research articles in earmarking high-caliber photocatalytic systems and hence planting a strong foundation to ensure the succeeding improvement in this promising and hastily stretching field of dinitrogen photofixation research.

Using electron spin resonance spectroscopy and different spin-labeled stearate probes, we observed that this light treatment noticeably decreased thylakoid membrane Lipid fluidity. The light-induced membrane rigidification (i) was proportional to the amount of zeaxanthin present in the membranes, (ii) was blocked by dithiothreitol, a potent inhibitor of the violaxanthin de-epoxidase, (iii) was slowly reversible in the dark, (iv) was not observed in thylakoids of an Arabidopsis mutant that has no xanthophyll cycle and (v) was accompanied by a substantial increase in the thermostability of the ionic permeability properties of the thylakoid membranes. The amount of xanthophyll-cycle pigments found in photosystem II was observed to significantly decrease after illumination. Photoacoustic and chlorophyll fluorometric analyses of the illuminated leaves revealed that strong illumination decreased the quantum yield of photosynthetic oxygen evolution and the pigment antenna size of photosystem Il in green light (preferentially absorbed by carotenoids) but not in red light (absorbed by chlorophylls only). Taken together in the light of previous in vitro data on carotenoids incorporated into artificial membranes, our results indicate that the xanthophyll cycle could be an 'emergency mechanism' that rapidly provides thylakoid membrane lipids with rigidifying carotenoid molecules upon sudden increase in light intensity. The significance of this mechanism for the membrane function and adaptation to stressful light and temperature conditions is discussed.

This feature is unique among all known aromatic chromophores and is of outstanding relevance for applications in photocatalysis and organic optoelectronics. Heptazine is the building block of the polymeric material graphitic carbon nitride which is an extensively explored photocatalyst in hydrogen evolution photocatalysis. Derivatives of heptazine have also been identified as efficient emitters in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). In both areas, the inverted singlet-triplet gap of heptazine is a highly beneficial feature. In photocatalysis, the absence of a long-lived triplet state eliminates the activation of atmospheric oxygen, which is favourable for long-term operational stability. In optoelectronics, singlet-triplet inversion implies the possibility of 100% fluorescence efficiency of electron-hole recombination. However, the absorption and luminescence wavelengths of heptazine and the S-1-S-0 transition dipole moment are difficult to tune for optimal functionality. In this work, we employed high-level ab initio electronic structure theory to devise and characterize a large family of novel heteroaromatic chromophores, the triangular boron carbon nitrides. These novel heterocycles inherit essential spectroscopic features from heptazine, in particular the inverted singlet-triplet gap, while their absorption and luminescence spectra and transition dipole moments are widely tuneable. For applications in photocatalysis, the wavelength of the absorption maximum can be tuned to improve the overlap with the solar spectrum at the surface of earth. For applications in OLEDs, the colour of emission can be adjusted and the fluorescence yield can be enhanced.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000656465600001	34059871

We present a model excitation cross section from threshold to high energy for the A(1)Pi state, including cascade by electron impact on CO. The A(1)Pi state is perturbed by triplet states leading to an extended FUV glow from electron excitation of CO. We derive a model FUV spectrum of the 4PG band system from dissociative excitation of CO2, an important process observed on Mars and Venus. Our unique experimental setup consists of a large vacuum chamber housing an electron gun system and the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph optical engineering unit, operating in the FUV (110-170 nm). The determination of the total O I (S-5(o)) at 135.6 nm emission cross section is accomplished by measuring the cylindrical glow pattern of the metastable emission from electron impact by imaging the glow intensity about the electron beam from nominally zero to similar to 400 mm distance from the electron beam. The study of the glow pattern of O I (135.6 nm) from dissociative excitation of CO and CO2 indicates that the O I (S-5(o)) state has a kinetic energy of similar to 1 eV by modeling the radial glow pattern with the published lifetime of 180 mu s for the O I (S-5(o)) state.Plain Language Summary Both Mars and Venus have upper atmospheres that are similar in composition: mostly CO2, CO, and N-2 are dominant molecular gases, with nearly identical UV spectra. The modeling studies of atmospheric UV emissions cannot presently be accurately conducted to the same accuracy as the planetary UV measurements, which avail themselves with state-of-the-art calibrated spectrographs. This dichotomy in accuracy between planetary observation and model occurs because the atomic and molecular emission cross sections with uncertainties of certain transitions are greater than 100%. Furthermore, the analysis is complicated by the spectral blending of the various emissions of the low-resolution spectral spaceborne instruments. We present in this paper a UV laboratory instrument unique in the world at the University of Colorado that can measure for the first time the excitation mechanisms with accurate emission cross sections of both allowed and optically forbidden transitions that are occurring in a planetary atmosphere.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000477707800045

Different from the traditional ultrasonic-HF (U-HF) leaching method, U-CuCCL and U-CuCCL combined rapid thermal processing (U-CuCCL + RTP) were performed to investigate the efficiency of removing the main impurities Fe, Al, Ca, Ti, Ni, V, Cu, and Mn. The evolution of typical precipitates phases on the surface of silicon before and after leaching were observed and analyzed by electron probe micro analyzer. The results show that the impurities removal can be significantly improved under the ultrasonically strengthen process, especially the U-CuCCL process shows a high-efficient impurities removal efficiency. After the U-CuCCL, the etched silicon powders accompanied with numerous porous structure are obtained which is beneficial for the removal of impurities. Notably, it was found that the rapid thermal processing is beneficial for the residual impurities diffuse to the porous layer surface and the purity of silicon powder can be significantly increased from 99.3% to 99.995%.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			1350-4177	1873-2828		WOS:000469892100050	31101287

To examine the phase evolution and thermal stress effect, cyclic thermal fatigue test was done, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were also performed. Conclusions have been made as follows.The as-coated sample showed an amorphous structure, while monoclinic-ZrO2, tetragonal-ZrO2, and cubic-ZrO2 structures were formed after 20 h holding at 700 degrees C. XPS analysis showed that in the as-coated sample, ZrO2-x suboxide had already existed and carbon partially substituted Zr on Zr-O bonding configuration. However, after 20 h holding at 700 degrees C, the suboxide disappeared and boride was formed. As for the thermal stress effect, the fraction of the stable monoclinic phase increased as the heat treatment time increased without thermal stress. On the other hand, after cyclic thermal stress, the formation of a monoclinic phase was retarded. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

This limits its application as a co-catalyst in renewable hydrogen evolution through photocatalytic water splitting in the visible light region. It is well known that noble metal films show active absorption in the visible region due to the existence of the unique feature known as surface plasmon resonance. Here we report tunable plasmons in nitrogen-doped graphene nanostructures using noble metal (Au/Ag) films. The energy resonance point of the prominent peak of the composite nanostructure is altered by changing the separation space of two-layered nanostructures. We found the strength of the absorption spectrum of the composite nanostructure is much stronger than the isolated N-doped graphene monolayer. When the separation space is decreased, the prominent peak of the absorption spectrum is red-shifted to the visible light region. Moreover, currents of several microamperes exist above the surface of the N-doped graphene and Au film composite nanostructure. In addition, the field enhancement exceeds 1000 when an impulse excitation polarized in the armchair-edge direction (X-axis) when the separation space is decreased to 3 A and is close to 100 when an impulse excitation polarized in the zigzag-edge direction (Y-axis). The N-doped graphene and noble metal film composite nanostructure is a good candidate material as a co-catalyst in renewable hydrogen production by photocatalytic water splitting in the visible light region.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000430537600077	29616688

We have detected the third r-process peak elements osmium, platinum, and ( for the first time in a metal-poor star) gold, elements whose abundances can only be reliably determined using HST. Our observations illustrate a pattern seen in other similar halo stars with the abundances of the heavier neutron capture elements, including the third r-process peak elements, consistent with a scaled solar system r-process distribution. The abundances of the lighter neutron capture elements, including germanium and silver, fall below that same scaled solar r-process curve, a result similar to that seen in the ultra metal-poor star CS 22892-052. A single site with two regimes or sets of conditions, or perhaps two different sites for the lighter and heavier neutron capture elements, might explain the abundance pattern seen in this star. In addition, we have derived a reliable abundance for the radioactive element thorium. We tentatively identify U II at 3859 Angstrom in the spectrum of BD + 17 3248, which makes this the second detection of uranium in a very metal-poor halo star. Our combined observations cover the widest range in proton number ( from germanium to uranium) thus far of neutron capture elements in metal-poor Galactic halo stars. Employing the thorium and uranium abundances in comparison with each other and with several stable elements, we determine an average cosmochronological age for BD + 17degrees3248 of 13 +/- 8 4 Gyr, consistent with that found for other similar metal-poor halo stars.									249	8	0	0	0	0	253			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000176071200014

This work reports a successful synthesis of CdSe quantum dots (QDs) modified phosphorus doped g-C3N4 (P-CN) for advanced photocatalytic applications. Phosphorus doping and structural coupling with CdSe QDs are shown to significantly extend visible-light response of g-C3N4 up to 700 nm. The optimized sample 4CdSe/P-CN demonstrates enhanced visible-light driven overall water splitting activities for H-2 and O-2 evolution i.e. 113 and 55.5 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1), respectively, as well as very high photocatalytic CO2 to CH4 conversion efficiency (47 mu mol.h(-1). g(-1)). It also exhibit higher activity (78 %) for 2,4-dichlorophenol degradation as compared to pristine CN-sample. Combined photoluminescence, transient/single wavelength photocurrent, photoelectrochemical, and coumarin fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrate that 4CdSe/P-CN nanocomposite exhibit enhanced charge separation efficiency which is responsible for improved visible light catalytic activities. Our work thus provide a new strategy to design low-cost and sustainable photocatalysis with wide visible-light activity for practical overall water splitting and CO2 reduction applications.									105	3	0	0	17	0	105			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000526110500022

This photo-catalytic hydrogen production activity is 968.2 times higher than that of g-C3N4. Meanwhile, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) of the ternary hybrid photocatalyst is 9.6% at 420 nm. The extension of optical response range is verified by ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). Enhancement of the charge separation efficiency is examined via photoluminescence (PL), surface photovoltage (SPV) and electron spin resonance (ESR). A reasonable catalytic mechanism of the ternary hybrid photocatalyst is proposed. As an electron-bridge, PdAg bimetallic alloy NPs can assist the photoelectrons to transfer from the CB of g-C3N4 to the CB of CdS, from where the photoelectrons react with hydrogen ion to release hydrogen. This work may pave a new way on designing high efficient ternary hybrid photocatalyst.									58	1	0	0	5	0	58			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000591344900003

The unique structure with intensified surface and interface characteristics endow NBTNs with more catalytic sites, and increase charge carrier separation efficiency with an extended charge lifetime, overwhelmingly promoting its photocatalytic performance. The resultant NBTNs possess a relatively high surface area and pore size of similar to 89 m(2) g(-1) and similar to 9.8 nm, respectively. The resultant NBTNs exhibit an excellent solar-driven photocatalytic hydrogen rate (3.17 mmolh(-1) g(-1)), which is almost as high as that of Pt as cocatalyst, in which the apparent quantum yield of 5.4% (420 nm) is recorded for the NBTNs sample. Moreover, the turnover number can be up to 116 000 within 48 h and the turnover frequency is 2400 for NiS. This novel strategy could provide a better understanding of cocatalyst photocatalytic mechanisms, and a scheme simultaneously regulating the morphology and structure of photocatalysts for promoting H-2 generation.									20	1	0	0	1	0	19			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000457533600001	30625419

Here, we used a controlled laboratory microcosm experiment to comparatively assess the environmental degradation of eDNA and eRNA across an acid-base gradient following complete removal of the progenitor organism (Daphnia pulex). Using water samples collected over a 30-day period, eDNA and eRNA copy numbers were quantified using a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene of D. pulex. We found that eRNA decayed more rapidly than eDNA at all pH conditions tested, with detectability-predicted by an exponential decay model-for up to 57 h (eRNA; neutral pH) and 143 days (eDNA; acidic pH) post organismal removal. Decay rates for eDNA were significantly higher in neutral and alkaline conditions than in acidic conditions, while decay rates for eRNA did not differ significantly among pH levels. Collectively, our findings provide the basis for a predictive framework assessing the persistence and degradation dynamics of eRNA and eDNA across a range of ecologically relevant pH conditions, establish the potential for eRNA to be used in spatially and temporally sensitive biomonitoring studies (as it is detectable across a range of pH levels), and may be used to inform future sampling strategies in aquatic habitats.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1755-098X	1755-0998		WOS:000809584900001	35643953

Part 3: Biodiesel-diesel blends								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				39	1			196	208		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.10.093				JAN 2 2014	2014	The auto-thermal reforming (ATR) performance of diesel blended with biodiesel (e.g., B5, B10, B20, B40, and B80) was investigated and compared to pure diesel and biodiesel ATR in a single-tube reformer with ceramic monolith wash-coated rhodium/ceria-zirconia catalyst. The initial operating condition of the ATR of all studied fuels was set as total moles of oxygen from air, water, and fuel per mole of carbon (O/C) = 1.47, moles of water to carbon (H2O/C) = 0.6, and gas hourly space velocity = 33,950 h(-1) at 1223 K reformer temperature, to achieve the same syngas (H-2 + CO) production rate. A direct photo-acoustic micro-soot meter was applied to quantify the dynamic evolution of carbon formation and a mass spectrometer was used to measure the gas composition of reformer effluents. The blends with more biodiesel content were found to have a lower syngas production rate and reforming efficiency, and require more air and higher reformer temperature to avoid carbon formation. Strong correlations between ethylene and solid carbon concentration were observed in the reformation of all the fuels and blends, with more biodiesel content tending to have higher ethylene production. This study is one component of a three-part investigation of bio-fuel reforming, also including fuel vaporization and reactant mixing (Part 1) and biodiesel (Part 2).

In social face-to-face situations, people readily read the affect and intentions of others in their face expressions and gestures recognizing their meaning. Importantly, the addressee further has to discriminate the meanings of the seen communicative motor acts in order to be able to react upon them appropriately. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study 15 healthy non-alexithymic right-handers observed video-clips that showed the dynamic evolution of emotional face expressions and gestures evolving from a neutral to a fully developed expression. We aimed at disentangling the cerebral circuits related to the observation of the incomplete and the subsequent discrimination of the evolved bodily expressions of emotion which are typical for everyday social situations. We show that the inferior temporal gyrus and the inferior and dorsal medial frontal cortex in both cerebral hemispheres were activated early in recognizing faces and gestures, while their subsequent discrimination involved the right dorsolateral frontal cortex. Interregional correlations showed that the involved regions constituted a widespread circuit allowing for a formal analysis of the seen expressions, their empathic processing and the subjective interpretation of their contextual meanings. Right-left comparisons revealed a greater activation of the right dorsal medial frontal cortex and the inferior temporal gyrus which supports the notion of a right hemispheric dominance for processing affective body expressions. These novel data provide a neurobiological basis for the intuitive understanding of other people which is relevant for socially appropriate decisions and intact social functioning.

Herein, a Z-scheme ZnO/Au/graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) composite heterojunction with three-dimensional (3D) urchin-like micro/nanostructure has been successfully fabricated and applied as an excellent photocathode for PEC H-2 evolution. The 3D urchin-like ZnO/Au/g-C3N4 heterostructure provides a rapid Z-scheme charge-carrier transport and collection channel. The characterization of electrochemical impedance and time-resolved photoluminescence confirm that the incorporated Au nanoparticles act as an electron mediator to promote vectorial electron transfer in direct Z-scheme ZnO/g-C3N4 heterojunction. With a bias of 0 V vs. RHE in neutral electrolyte (0.2 M Na2SO4), the Pt co-catalysts loaded Z-scheme ZnO/Au/g-C3N4 photocathode shows a stable photocurrent as high as -0.29 mA cm(-2) over 36,000 s. This work delivers a new insight to the future development of novel all-solid-state Z-scheme photoelectrodes for efficiently converting solar energy into hydrogen fuels.									75	5	0	0	7	0	76			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000510526000037

In this paper, Raman spectroscopy is used to track the evolution of a dianion-anion-neutral mixture in a perylene bisimide (PBI)-doped film under air, with z-scanning carried out in the confocal mode. The precise distribution for the different states along the film depth is realized within 3.5 mu m. The whole film is clearly divided into three regions: the ion-poor state, transition region and ion-rich state. The ion ratio and distribution are strongly related to the film conductivity and the onset voltage shift. Changes in the distribution of the ionic species during oxidation and electrode catalysis are clearly recorded by z-scanning, which is beneficial for understanding the charge transfer properties as well as the mechanism underlying working devices.

The mpg-C3N4 exhibited a hypsochromic shift in the UV-vis absorption profile probably due to a lower degree of condensation of the tris-s-triazine units in its conjugate aromatic system. In addition, the mesoporous material demonstrated enhanced textural properties with a surface area estimated in 49.8 m(2)/g, which is one order of magnitude higher than the surface area of the bulk g-C3N4 sample. In this sense, the mpg-C3N4 shows a higher photocatalytic performance in the production of H-2 through the water splitting process. Furthermore, the mpg-C3N4 was also used as fluorescent probe for the sensitive detection of Au3+ ions in aqueous solution. The fluorescence quenching was quantitatively analyzed by the Stern-Volmer equation using the evolution of the photoluminescence (PL) emission at 371 nm (lambda(exc) = 250 nm). The limit of detection (LOD) was estimated at 1.1 mu M, which was lower than the estimated LOD using the bulk g-C3N4 sample (2.1 mu M). To the best of our knowledge, this work reports for the first time the detection of Au3+ ions through fluorescence quenching using g-C3N4 samples with different textural properties.									34	3	0	0	2	0	34			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000472476200023

The microstructural evolution of the freeze-dried chitosanaluminum/PVA (CAP) aerogels revealed that varied amount of aluminum salt could influence the threedimensional architecture. Especially, the CA1.5P aerogel with herringbone-like structure had high compressive strength of 8.55 MPa, corresponding to the specific modulus of 66.3 m2 s_ 2. Compared to the polymeric chitosan/PVA aerogel, the CAP aerogels showed better fire retardancy, as confirmed by limited oxygen index (LOI) tests and cone calorimeter (CC) tests. Remarkably, the introduction of inorganic components from AIP (about 7.7-20.1 wt%) led to an increased LOI value (35%-41.1%) and lower total heat release and total smoke release. The proposed mechanism suggested that the enhanced flame retardancy benefitted greatly from the formation of alumina-rich hybrid chars with the assistance of thermal degradation of chitosan, which resulted in barrier effects of controlling the heat and smoke hazards. In addition, silanization modification of the composite aerogel was performed by a facile chemical vapor deposition (CVD) treatment to improve the hydrophobicity. The aluminum-incorporated organic-inorganic aerogels with high mechanical strength, good fire-resistance and smoke-suppressant performance could be seen as potential alternatives to traditional flame-retardant foams.									12	0	0	0	2	1	12			1359-8368	1879-1069		WOS:000656542900001		
J	Ouyed, Rachid								A new model for the origin of very metal poor stars and their chemical composition								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				428	1			236	253		10.1093/mnras/sts016				JAN 2013	2013	The genesis and chemical patterns of the metal-poor stars in the galactic halo remain an open question. Current models do not seem to give a satisfactory explanation for the observed abundances of lithium in the galactic metal-poor stars and the existence of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) and nitrogen-enhanced metal-poor (NEMP) stars. In order to deal with some of these theoretical issues, we suggest an alternative explanation, where some of the Pop III supernovae (SNe) are followed by the detonation of their neutron stars [quark-novae (QNe)]. In QNe occurring a few days to a few weeks following the preceding SN explosion, the neutron-rich relativistic QN ejecta leads to spallation of Ni-56 processed in the ejecta of the preceding SN explosion and thus to 'iron/metal impoverishment' of the primordial gas swept by the combined SN+QN ejecta. We show that the generation of stars formed from fragmentation of pristine clouds swept up by the combined SN+QN ejecta acquires a metallicity with -7.5 < [Fe/H] < -1.5 for dual explosions with 2 < t(delay) (d) < 30. Spallation leads to the depletion of Ni-56 and formation of sub-Ni elements such as Ti, V, Cr and Mn providing a reasonable account of the trends observed in galactic halo metal-poor stars. CEMP stars form in dual explosions with short delays (t(delay) < 5 d). These lead to important destruction of Ni-56 (and thus to a drastic reduction of the amount of Fe in the swept-up cloud) while preserving the carbon processed in the outer layers of the SN ejecta. Lithium is produced from the interaction of the neutron-rich QN ejecta with the outer (oxygen-rich) layers of the SN ejecta. A lithium plateau with 2 < A(Li) < 2.4 can be produced in our model as well as a corresponding Li-6 plateau with Li-6/Li-7 < 0.3.									6	2	0	0	0	2	6			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000318227900032

The product served as a highly efficient chainmail bi-functional catalyst toward electrolytic water splitting, requiring small operating cell voltages of only 1.65, 1.73, and 1.79 Vat 50, 100, and 250 mA/cm(2), respectively for overall water splitting. More importantly, the product catalyst also possessed excellent long-term stability, even tested at 250 mA/cm2. The excellent activity and durability may be ascribed to the positive synergistic effects between well-mixed metal phosphides, advantageous nanostructure of interwoven thin vertical nanosheets, protective and conductive N-doped carbon matrix, hydrophilic and aerophobic characteristics, and well dispersed and utilized active materials on skeleton surfaces of the highly conductive NF. This synergistic effect boosting and protective layer armored design for highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts is unique and scalable, suitable for large-scale applications not only in the field of electrocatalysis, but also in other heterogeneous catalysis.

We studied the effect of a CK analog, 6-benzyl adenine (BA), on rice leaves to understand the possible mechanism by which CK delays senescence in a drought-and heat-tolerant rice cultivar Nagina22 (N22) using dark-induced senescence (DIS) as a surrogate for natural senescence of leaves. Leaves of N22-H-dgl162, a stay-green mutant of N22, and BA-treated N22 showed retention of chlorophyll (Chl) pigments, maintenance of the Chl a/b ratio, and delay in reduction of both photochemical efficiency and rate of oxygen evolution during DIS. HPLC analysis showed accumulation of 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll (HmChl) during DIS, and the kinetics of its accumulation correlated with progression of senescence. Transcriptome analysis revealed that several plastid-localized genes, specifically those associated with photosystem II (PSII), showed higher transcript levels in BA-treated N22 and the stay-green mutant leaves compared with naturally senescing N22 leaves. Real-time PCR analyses showed that genes coding for enzymes associated with Chl a/b interconversion and proteins associated with light-harvesting complexes maintained higher transcript levels up to 72 h of DIS following BA treatment. The pigment-protein complexes analyzed by green gel remained intact in both N22-H-dgl162 and BA-treated N22 leaves even after 96 h of DIS. Thus, CK delays senescence by accumulation of HmChl and up-regulating genes in the Chl cycle, thereby maintaining the Chl a/b ratio. Also, CK treatment retains higher transcript levels of PSII-related genes, resulting in the stability of photosynthetic pigment complexes and functional stay-greenness in rice.									54	9	1	0	47	0	65			0022-0957	1460-2431		WOS:000372981800022	26826216

The electron transfer events in Cl--depleted PS-II were investigated by using continuous wave (cw) and pulsed EPR, and the results were compared with those obtained in untreated and Ca2+-depleted PS-II. In Cl--depleted PS II, the S-1 to S-2 transition is not accompanied by the appearance of the S-2 manganese signal in both cw and field-swept echo experiments. In the S-3 state, the cw experiment reveals the presence of a radical signal, and the field-swept echo experiment reveals the presence of a manganese signal similar to that observed in the S-2 state in Cl--reconstituted PS-II. A relaxation enhancement study of the oxidized tyrosine D indicates that a relaxation enhancement occurs only in the S-2 to S-3 transition and not in the S-1 to S-2 transition. The results are interpreted by the following preferred model. In Cl--depleted PS-II, the S-1 to S-2 transition corresponds to the oxidation of a component other than the manganese cluster, possibly an amino acid, and the S-2 to S-3 transition corresponds to the oxidation of the manganese complex. This oxidation sequence is the opposite of that observed in Ca2+-depleted PS-II. and may be due to a modulation by chloride of the relative redox potentials of the mangenese cluster and a nearby oxidizable amino acid. An alternative model involving manganese oxidation that is invisible in the S-1 to S-2 transition but that becomes visible on S-3 formation cannot be ruled out, although it is considered less likely.									35	0	0	0	24	0	35			0021-9258			WOS:A1994NH71600017	8175652

We report on progress towards the development of a photoelectrochemical water-splitting system that will use sunlight and water as the inputs to produce renewable hydrogen with oxygen as a by-product. This system is based on the design principle of incorporating two separate, photosensitive inorganic semiconductor/liquid junctions to collectively generate the 1.7-1.9 V at open circuit needed to support both the oxidation of H2O (or OH-) and the reduction of H+ (or H2O). Si microwire arrays are a promising photocathode material because the high aspect-ratio electrode architecture allows for the use of low cost, earth-abundant materials without sacrificing energy-conversion efficiency, due to the orthogonalization of light absorption and charge-carrier collection. Additionally, the high surface-area design of the rod-based semiconductor array inherently lowers the flux of charge carriers over the rod array surface relative to the projected geometric surface of the photoelectrode, thus lowering the photocurrent density at the solid/liquid junction and thereby relaxing the demands on the activity (and cost) of any electrocatalysts. Arrays of Si microwires grown using the Vapor Liquid Solid (VLS) mechanism have been shown to have desirable electronic light absorption properties. We have demonstrated that these arrays can be coated with earth-abundant metallic catalysts and used for photoelectrochemical production of hydrogen. This development is a step towards the demonstration of a complete artificial photosynthetic system, composed of only inexpensive, earth-abundant materials, that is simultaneously efficient, durable, and scalable.

Three Co mass concentrations related to TiO2 content have been used: 0.5, 1 and 2 wt%. The morpho-structural changes due to the thermal treatment and dopant presence were followed by: thermal analysis methods, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and magnetic measurements. A detailed XRD analysis, based on an own calculus program, has established the lattice constants, the average size of the crystallites, < D >, and the average lattice strains, < S >, which can give some information about the structural disorder. The values of the lattice constants lead to the conclusion that a solid solution of the CoxTi1-xO2 form was obtained. The Co concentration imprints the paramagnetic behavior to the solid solutions. It influences the evolution of the < D > and < S > factors by the competition between: the deficit of oxygen acquired by un-doped TiO2 in the sol gel process (influenced by temperature), the dopant diffusion in the host lattice (influenced by ionic radius and valence) and the super-exchange interactions between the magnetic moments of the molecules of the solid solution (influenced by the concentration of Co). The sample with 1 wt% Co thermally treated at 400 degrees C ensures the best photocatalytic activity in the advanced degradation of nitrobenzene from water.

In a stoichiometric C3H8:O-2 mixture, plasma decay was also studied in a repetitively pulsed discharge for varing numbers of discharge pulses (varying degrees of fuel oxidation). The rate of plasma decay was determined from the temporal evolution of electron density measured using the microwave interferometer. It was observed that gas heating to 600 K leads to a decrease in the rate of plasma decay in all cases. The effect of heating on plasma decay was most profound in the H2O:N-2 mixture (after a single discharge pulse) and in the C3H8:O-2 mixture for high degrees of fuel oxidation. A kinetic scheme was developed to numerically simulate the plasma decay in hydrocarbons and combustible mixtures. Numerical analysis showed that, under the conditions studied, plasma decay was controlled by dissociative electron recombination with simple molecular and cluster ions. Gas heating led to a decrease in the rate of the electron-ion recombination and the rate of conversion of molecular ions to cluster ions. As a result, the gas temperature increase caused a decrease in the fraction of cluster ions for which the recombination coefficients are an order of magnitude higher than the recombination coefficients for molecular ions. The influence of gas heating on the decrease of the amount of cluster ions was more important when the ion composition was dominated by hydrated H3O +(H2O)k ions. The rates of the formation of these ions are extremely sensitive to any variations in gas temperature. As a result, in agreement with our observations, gas heating led to an anomalous decrease in the rates of plasma decay in the H2O:N-2 mixture, as well as in the C3H8:O-2 mixture when H2O molecules were produced due to fuel oxidation.

In this work, PAN-based blend precursors are investigated using ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics simulations with respect to the formation of all-carbon rings, the evolutions of oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing species, and the migration of carbon atoms to form turbostratic graphene. From these simulations, we identify that PAN/cellulose (CL) blend manifests the highest carbon yield and the most substantial all-carbon ring formation. This ReaxFF-based finding is confirmed by Raman and TEM experiments indicating high crystallinity for PAN/CL-derived blend CFs. We trace the pathway of gasification and carbonization of PAN/CL to elaborate the mechanism of the formation of all-carbon ring networks. We discover that the acetals of CL can catalyze the cyclization of the blend precursor, allowing for the search for CL derivatives or the other kinds of bio-based polymers with similar functionalities as alternative blends. In addition, we examine the structural characteristics using the carbon-carbon (C-C) radial distribution functions, C-C bond length distributions, and sp(2) C atom ratios for the four representative precursors, i.e., PAN, oxidized PAN, PAN/nylon 6,6, and PAN/CL. Our simulation results show the most extensive all-carbon ring cluster and graphitic structure growths for PAN/CL. Therefore, we propose PAN/CL as a cost-effective alternative CF precursor, since (a) CL is naturally abundant and eco-friendly for production, (b) the blend precursor PAN/CL does not require oxidation treatment, (c) PAN/CL has a high carbon yield with substantial all-carbon ring formation, and (d) PAN/CL based CFs potentially provide a mechanical property enhancement.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000781514400001	35411903	
J	Sun, Shilin; Wang, Bo; Jiang, Qi; Li, Zhuoran; Jia, Site; Wang, Yucheng; Guo, Huiyan								Genome-wide analysis of BpDof genes and the tolerance to drought stress in birch (Betula platyphylla)								PEERJ				9						e11938	10.7717/peerj.11938				AUG 24 2021	2021	Background. DNA binding with one finger (Dof) proteins are plant-specific transcription factors playing vital roles in developmental processes and stress responses in plants. Nevertheless, the characterizations, expression patterns, and functions of the Dof family under drought stress (a key determinant of plant physiology and metabolic homeostasis) in woody plants remain unclear. Methods. The birch (Betula platyphylla var. mandshuric) genome and plant TFDB database were used to identify Dof gene family members in birch plants. ClustalW2 of BioEdit v7.2.1, MEGA v7.0, ExPASy ProtParam tool, Subloc, TMHMM v2.0, GSDS v2.0, MEME, TBtools, KaKs Calculator v2.0, and PlantCARE were respectively used to align the BpDof sequences, build a phylogenetic tree, identify the physicochemical properties, analyze the chromosomal distribution and synteny, and identify the cis elements in the promoter regions of the 26 BpDof genes. Additionally, the birch seedlings were exposed to PEG6000-simulated drought stress, and the expression patterns of the BpDof genes in different tissues were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The histochemical staining and the evaluation of physiological indexes were performed to assess the plant tolerance to drought with transient overexpression of BpDof4, BpDof11, and BpDof17 genes. SPSS software and ANOVA were used to conduct all statistical analyses and determine statistically significant differences between results. Results. A total of 26 BpDof genes were identified in birch via whole-genome analysis. The conserved Dof domain with a C(x)2C(x)21C(x)2C zinc finger motif was present in all BpDof proteins. These birch BpDofs were classified into four groups (A to D) according to the phylogenetic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana Dof genes. BpDof proteins within the same group mostly possessed similar motifs, as detected by conserved motif analysis. The exon-intron analysis revealed that the structures of BpDof genes differed, indicating probable gene gain and lose during the BpDof evolution. The chromosomal distribution and synteny analysis showed that the 26 BpDofs were unevenly distributed on 14 chromosomes, and seven duplication events among six chromosomes were found. Cis-acting elements were abundant in the promoter regions of the 26 BpDof genes. qRT-PCR revealed that the expression of the 26 BpDof genes was differentially regulated by drought stress among roots, stems, and leaves. Most BpDof genes responded to drought stress, and BpDof4, BpDof11, and BpDof17 were significantly up-regulated. Therefore, plants overexpressing these three genes were generated to investigate drought stress tolerance. The BpDof4-, BpDof11-, and BpDof17overexpressing plants showed promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capabilities and less severe cell damage, suggesting that they conferred enhanced drought tolerance in birch. This study provided an in-depth insight into the structure, evolution, expression, and function of the Dof gene family in plants.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2167-8359			WOS:000701663100002	34513325

This report demonstrates the ability to use high-energy X-ray scattering and atomic pair distribution function analysis, PDF, to resolve structure in amorphous metal oxide catalyst films. The analysis is applied here to resolve domain structure differences induced by oxyanion substitution during the electrochemical assembly of amorphous cobalt oxide catalyst films, Co-OEC. PDF patterns for Co-OEC films formed using phosphate, Pi, methylphosphate, MPi, and borate, Bi, electrolyte buffers show that the resulting domains vary in size following the sequence Pi < MPi < Bi. The increases in domain size for CoMPi and CoBi were found to be correlated with increases in the contributions from bilayer and trilayer stacked domains having structures intermediate between those of the LiCoOO and CoO(OH) mineral forms. The lattice structures and offset stacking of adjacent layers in the partially stacked CoMPi and CoBi domains were best matched to those in the LiCoOO layered structure. The results demonstrate the ability of PDF analysis to elucidate features of domain size, structure, defect content and mesoscale organization for amorphous metal oxide catalysts that are not readily accessed by other X-ray techniques. PDF structure analysis is shown to provide a way to characterize domain structures in different forms of amorphous oxide catalysts, and hence provide an opportunity to investigate correlations between domain structure and catalytic activity.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13				2052-5206		WOS:000366321100015	26634728

In this study, a lactic acid-mediated synthesis route has been developed to prepare g-C3N4 nanosheets, which includes the preassembled formation of lactic acid-melamine co-monomers, followed by direct high-temperature calcination. In this case, it is found that during high-temperature calcination, the lactic acid molecules can greatly prevent the serious polymerization of melamine molecules, resulting in the formation of g-C3N4 nanosheets. Moreover, owing to the strong coupling with melamine molecules, lactic acid can also significantly increase the production rate (ca. 35.16 wt%) of g-C3N4 nanosheets from the melamine precursor via preventing the rapid sublimation of melamine and its intermediates during the calcination progress compared with the well-known two-step calcination method. Photocatalytic experimental data reveal that the resultant g-C3N4 nanosheet photocatalysts show a greatly improved H-2-production rate, and the g-C3N4 (500 L) sample exhibits the best photocatalytic performance, which is obviously two times higher than that of the conventional bulk g-C3N4. In addition to lactic acid, it is very interesting to find that acetic acid can also be used to prepare g-C3N4 nanosheets via a similar formation mechanism, strongly suggesting the universality and versatility of the present lactic acid-mediated synthesis route. The present synthesis strategy may broaden the horizons for the synthesis of high-efficiency photocatalysts.									86	11	0	0	7	0	87			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000468868200037	31065664

Dipnoi have dual breathing modes extracting oxygen from water and air. The primitive lungs of lungfishes are exposed to external antigens including viruses. To date, the immune response of lungfishes against viruses has not been investigated. During viral immune responses, cell exposure to type I interferon induces the replacement of the constitutive proteasome with LMP2, LMP7 and MECL-1 beta subunits forming the immunoproteasome and enhancing antigen presentation to MHC class I molecules. In order to study the immune defense system of the lungfish lung, we have characterized for the first time the three immunoproteasome subunits in the sarcopterygian fish, the Nigerian spotted lungfish (Protopterus dolloi). LMP2, LMP7 and MECL-1 were identified in P. dolloi and their sequences encoded predicted proteins of 216, 275 and 278 amino acids, respectively. The mRNA of these three genes was expressed in multiple tissues, including the lung, with the highest abundance observed in kidney and post-pyloric spleen. In vitro stimulation of lungfish lung and kidney primary cell cultures with PolyI:C for 4 and 12 h resulted in increased LMP2, LMP7 and MECL-1 expression in both tissues. These results suggest a central role of these genes in the activation of an antiviral immune response in lungfish. Importantly, they indicate that the primitive lung of the common ancestor of all tetrapods is capable of inducing the expression of these genes in response to viral stimulation.

Herein, a solvothermal process has been used to fabricate MnxCd1-xS-based products, which can transform into novel heterojunctions consisting of nanorod-like Mn0.2Cd0.8S solid solution and nanoparticle-like alpha-MnS once the x value is higher than 0.20, and the resulted Mn0.2Cd0.8S/MnS heterojunction containing 38 mol% alpha-MnS demonstrates an optimum composition ratio with the best H-2 production activity (335 mu mol h(-1)), which is 1.95 times higher than that (171 mu mol h(-1)) of the single CdS under visible light (lambda >= 420 nm) irradiation. After modified with MoS2 cocatalyst via a one-pot solvothermal process, those MoS2-Mn0.2Cd0.8S/MnS composites show significantly improved photocatalytic performance, and the 15 wt% MoS2-Mn0.2Cd0.8S/MnS achieves the best H-2 production activity (995 mu mol h(-1)), which is 2.97 times higher than that (335 mu mol h(-1)) of the pristine Mn0.2Cd0.8S/MnS with the optimum composition ratio and also higher than that (868 mu mol h(-1)) of the 1.0 wt% Pt-Mn0.2Cd0.8S/MnS. The well aligned energy band structures and the intimate contacts among Mno. Mn0.2Cd0.8S, alpha-MnS and MoS2 facilitate the photogenerated electron transferring from the nanoparticle-like alpha-MnS to the nanorod-like Mn0.2Cd0.8S and then to the nanoflake-like MoS2, thus promoting the charge separation and providing more active sites for H-2 production reaction. This study not only presents a rare example of binary Mn0.2Cd0.8S/MnS heterojunction photocatalyst consisting of Mn0.2Cd0.8S solid solution and alpha-MnS, but also paves a new way to explore highly efficient and noble metal-free photocatalytic H-2 production system for solar energy conversion.									103	6	0	0	5	0	103			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000449444000014

The lack of an adequate support for monitoring the evolution of physical variables prevents the suitable exploitation of the information obtained when monitoring critical patients. This work proposes a solution for designing intelligent alarms capable of addressing the flaws and limitations of threshold alarms.Materials and methods: The solution proposed is based on the multivariable fuzzy temporal profile (MFTP) model, a format model for describing certain monitoring criteria as a set of morphologies defined over the temporal evolution of the patient's physiological variables, and a set of relations between them. The MFTP model represents these morphologies through a network of fuzzy constraints between a set of points in the evolution of the variables which the physician considers especially relevant. We also provide a knowledge acquisition toot, TRACE, with which clinical staff can design and edit alarms based on the MFTP model.Results: Sixteen alarms were designed using the MFTP model; these were capable of supervising monitoring criteria that could be satisfactorily supervised with commercial monitoring devices. The alarms were validated over a total of 196 h of recordings of physiological variables from 78 different patients admitted to an intensive care unit. Of the 912 alarm triggerings, only 7% were false positives. A study of the usability of the toot TRACE was also carried out. After a brief training seminar, five physicians and four nurses designed a number of alarms with this toot. They were then asked to fill in the standard System Usability Scale test. The average score was 68.2.Conclusion: The proposal presented herein for describing monitoring criteria, comprising the MFTP model and TRACE, permits the supervision of monitoring criteria that cannot be represented by means of thresholds, and makes it possible to construct alarms that give a rate of false positives far below that for threshold alarms.

Such changes are caused not only by increasing the linear energy transfer (LET) of beam particles with the penetration depth towards the Bragg peak, but also by nuclear reactions induced by beam nuclei leading to the production of various secondary particles. Although the changes of RBE along the beam axis have been studied quite well, much less attention has been paid to the evolution of RBE in the transverse direction, perpendicular to the beam axis. In order to fill this gap, we simulated radiation fields of H-1, He-4, C-12 and O-16 nuclei of 20 mm in diameter by means of a Geant4-based Monte Carlo model for heavy-ion therapy connected with the modified microdosimetric kinetic model to describe the response of normal ((alpha/beta)(x-rays) = 3.8 Gy) and early-responding ((alpha/beta)(x-rays) = 10 Gy) tissues. Depth and radial distributions of saturation-corrected dose-mean lineal energy, RBE and RBE-weighted dose are investigated for passive beam shaping and active beam scanning. The field of He-4 has a small lateral spread as compared with H-1 field, and it is characterised by a modest lateral variation of RBE suggesting the use of fixed RBE values across the field transverse cross section at each depth. Reduced uncertainties of RBE on the boundary of a He-4 treatment field can be advantageous in a specific case of an organ at risk located in lateral proximity to the target volume. It is found that the lateral distributions of RBE calculated for C-12 and O-16 fields demonstrate fast variations in the radial direction due to changes of dose and composition of secondary fragments in the field penumbra. Nevertheless, the radiation fields of all four projectiles at radii larger than 20 mm can be characterized by a common RBE value defined by tissue radiosensitivity. These findings can help, in particular, in accessing the transverse homogeneity of radiation fields of ions used in studies in vitro.									3	1	0	0	2	0	4			0031-9155	1361-6560		WOS:000404532400001	28557800

IdiA from Synechococcus PCC 6301 was partially sequenced, showing that the N-terminal amino acid is an alanine. Moreover, the gene encoding this protein in Synechococcus PCC 6301 has been identified and completely sequenced. The idiA gene codes for a protein starting with valine and consisting of 330 amino acid residues. Thus, IdiA is apparently synthesized as a precursor protein of 36.17 kDa and cleaved to its mature form of 35.01 kDa between two alanine residues at positions 9 and 10. IdiA is a highly basic protein having an isoelectric point of 10.55 (mature protein). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of IdiA with protein sequences in the database revealed that IdiA has similarities to two basic bacterial iron-binding proteins, SfuA from Serratia marcescens and Fbp from Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Insertional inactivation of the idiA gene in Synechococcus PCC 7942 resulted in a mutant which was unable to grow under iron- or manganese-limiting conditions. Manganese limitation of the mutant strain led to a drastic reduction of photosystem II activity (O-2 evolution) within less than 48 h, while wild-type cells required a prolonged cultivation in Mn-deficient medium before an effect on photosystem II was observed, Thus, IdiA is a protein involved in the process of providing photosystem II with manganese.									39	0	0	0	32	0	42			1350-0872	1465-2080		WOS:A1996VH92500036	8828233

The full-length cDNA of Pcjnk covered 2937 bp with an open reading frame of 1320 bp, encoding 439 amino acids. A typical conserved TPY motif (118Thr-Pro-120Tyr) was found in Pcjnk. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed a constitutive expression of Pcjnk in the tested tissue, with the highest expression occurring in the hepatopancreas. Additionally, the present study initially revealed that relative mRNA expression of Pcjnk and apoptosis level were significantly higher in the premolt stage (D1/D2 and D3/D4 stage) as compared to other molt stages. In contrast to the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) level decreased significantly from the intermolt stage (C stage) to the premolt stage (D1/D2 and D3/D4 stage), then increased from the premolt stage to the postmolt stage (A and B stage).

The as prepared silver/silver molybdate (Ag/Ag2MoO4) composites were systematically characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance absorption spectroscopy (DRS) in order to investigate their crystal structure, morphology and optical property as well. The photocatalytic activities of the composites were subsequently evaluated by their ability to degrade rhodamine B (RhB) under visible-light irradiation. Varies of controlled experiments were then carefully operated to gain a deep insight into the assembling of Ag/Ag2MoO4 composites. It was found that preparation conditions such as pH, reaction time, and the amount of surfactant played important roles in the formation of composites with octahedral microstructures. And the composite obtained at 160 degrees C using 0.5 g of sodium dodecyl sulfate exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance under visible-light irradiation. Capture experiments were also conducted to clarify the function of different active species generated on the surface of Ag/Ag2MoO4 during the photocatalytic process, in which both holes and center dot <bold>OH radicals were found to play crucial role in photocatalytic removal of RhB under visible light irradiation. A possible photocatalytic mechanism of Ag/Ag<bold>2MoO4 was finally proposed on the basis of all the results to explain the higher photocatalytic activity of the octahedral Ag/Ag2MoO4 composites. It was inferred that the photoinduced hot electrons can quickly transfer from the Ag NPs to the conduction band of Ag2MoO4 and react with oxygen and H2O to generate a large quality of active radicals such as <bold>OH and O-<bold>2 because of the SPR effects. Besides, this SPR effects of Ag nanoparticles deposited on the surface of Ag2MoO4 can not only dramatically amplify its light absorption, especially in the visible region, but also promote the separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs and effectively decrease electron-hole recombination.

We recruited 5055 patients. Data on clinical course and comorbid NCDs such as hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD), diabetes mellitus (DM), cancer, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and chronic respiratory disease (CRD) were collected. Statistical analyses were done by Mann-Whitney U, chi(2) and logistic regression tests using Stata version 14.Results: DM and hypertension were the most prevalent comorbidities in patients with positive and negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of mortality-associated factors was significant for DM [1.35 (1.07-1.70)], CHD [1.58 (1.26-1.96)], CRD [2.18 (1.58-3.0)], and cancer [3.55 (2.42-5.21)]. These results remained significant for cancer after adjustment for age, sex and clinical factors. Among patients with positive RT-PCR, death was significantly associated with CRD and cancer, while this association disappeared after adjustment for all potential confounders. There was a significant association between NCDs and higher occurrence of low oxygen saturation, mechanical ventilation requirement and intensive care unit admission after adjustment for age and sex.Conclusion: The presence of NCDs alone did not increase mortality in patients with COVID-19, after adjustment for all potential confounders including clinical factors.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1020-3397	1687-1634		WOS:000765492900002	34927706

It was observed that the structure of NiCo2O4 is highly dependent upon the temperature. At temperatures higher than 700 degrees C, NiCo2O4 tends to release one oxygen and change from spinel to rock-salt structure. To obtain a thin film of nickel-cobalt oxides using RF-magnetron sputtering, a solid film was deposited on a glass substrate using the sintered oxide target with the same composition. Furthermore, the electrical conduction and crystallization of the sputtered oxide thin film was also affected by the annealing environment. After detailed characterization and understanding of the phase transformation, a nickel-cobalt oxide film with the lowest resistivity of 0.05 Omega cm and a high transmittance of 90% in the infrared range was finally obtained. In addition, NiCo2O4 spinel thin films with high transmittance in infrared region were used for the front electrode of solar cells. As a result, the solar cells using IR-transparent NiCo2O4 layer exhibit an improved quantum efficiency, which leads to a higher short circuit current density, J(SC).					10th Asian Meeting on Electroceramics (AMEC)10th Asian Meeting on Electroceramics (AMEC)	DEC 04-07, 2016DEC 04-07, 2016		Taipei, TAIWANTaipei, TAIWAN	7	0	0	0	2	0	7			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000409285800081

Since Haemonchus contortus infection, is associated with severe anemia, studies performed from 1960s to 1990s investigated the association between beta-globin haplotype and resistance against this parasite. However, the findings were controversial, pointing out from increased resistance in animals harboring the beta(A) allele to inexistence of association. Thus, our study aimed to develop a qPCR for beta-globin haplotype identification, and to evaluate the association between beta-globin haplotype and resistance against H. contortus in a group of sheep submitted to artificial infection with this parasite. A total of 286 lambs of Morada Nova breed were experimentally challenged with 4000 H. contortus L3 and monitored for 112 days from weaning. Significantly improved (p < 0.05) phenotypic profiles (lower fecal egg counts, higher packed cell volume and birthweight) were observed for AA haplotype animals, especially when compared to BB animals, while AB animals were similar to BB. This is the first report of a qPCR assay for ovine beta-globin haplotype identification. In view of significant differences of phenotypic profiles between haplotype groups, the developed qPCR may constitute an important tool for sheep producers to improve genetic selection of parasite resistant animals.									4	0	0	0	4	1	4			0304-4017	1873-2550		WOS:000674661900003	33957549

The CNTs were adsorbed onto the surface of the micron SiC particles through hydrogen bonding caused by the groups functionalized on the surface of SiC particles (hydroxyl (-OH)) and CNTs (carboxyl (-COOH)), and then a shift speed ball milling was used to disperse the CNTs uniformly in the matrix. The microstructure characterization showed that this method could maintain the structural integrity of the CNTs, and the hybrid reinforcements could significantly refine the grain size of the matrix. In addition, the basal texture of the composites was weakened gradually as the content of the reinforcement increased. Microstructural investigation revealed that fine MgO formed by in-situ reaction between the oxygen groups and the magnesium matrix resulted in enhanced interfacial bonding. The ultra-high strength and good ductility (ultimate tensile strength: 412 MPa, yield strength: 345 MPa, and elongation: 8.0%) were achieved in the AZ61-5SiC-0.5CNTs composite. The significantly improved strength of the composites was mainly attributed to the synergistic influence of grain refinement, load transfer and increased dislocation density in the matrix due to thermal mismatch while the good ductility can mainly be attributed to the weakened basal texture. This work introduces a method of coupling a novel processing method with hybrid reinforcements approach to develop magnesium matrix composites with high strength and good ductility.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			0921-5093	1873-4936		WOS:000496607100002

The characterization of ZnO@CN was done by different analytical techniques such as XRD, FT-IR, SEM, DRS, XPS, PL and EIS which indicated that the composite has a narrow bandgap, hexagonal-shaped nanobolts structure, high stability, maximum ability to absorb visible light spectrum, high adsorption ability, and excellent charge separation. It was observed that a balanced ratio of ZnO and CN play a vital role in charge separation and provide standard bandgap which participates to boost-up photocatalytic degradation under visible light. As compared with pure CN and ZnO, the composites ZnO@CN-2 showed more efficient photocatalytic activity for TC degradation under the visible - light spectrum. The most advantageous CN amount in ZnO@CN-2 nanocomposite exhibited 2.77- and 1.51-times faster photodegradation as compared to CN and ZnO respectively. The cyclic process investigated the stability of the photocatalyst. The results showed that after washing five times, there was no significant change observed in the rate of degradation. Moreover, the coupling of CN with ZnO facilitates the photodegradation phenomena by providing active sites, producing rich oxygen species and limiting the electrons and hole recombination, which lead to better degradation of TC under the solar irradiation spectrum.									13	3	0	0	3	0	16				2213-3437		WOS:000471644100130		
J	Ji, Nanjing; Li, Ling; Lin, Lingxiao; Lin, Senjie				Lin, Senjie/A-7466-2011				Identification and expression analysis of blue light receptor aureochrome in the harmful alga Heterosigma akashiwo (raphidophyceae)								HARMFUL ALGAE				61				71	79		10.1016/j.hal.2016.11.016				JAN 2017	2017	The raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwois a bloom-forming phytoplankter and responsible for mass fish kills. Previous studies have indicated the importance of light on bloom formation of raphidophytes, but information on their light receptors is limited. Aureochrome (AUREO) is a blue light receptor conserved in photosynthetic stramenopile algae but has not been studied in H. akashiwo. In this study, four full-length cDNA sequences of aureo (named Haaureo1, Haaureo2, Haaureo3 and Haaureo4) were isolated from H. akashiwo. A basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) domain and a light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain were found in each of the four genes. Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR assays revealed different expression patterns among the Haaureo genes in the light: dark (LD) cycle; only Haaureol exhibited a clear diel rhythm, with the highest and the lowest transcript abundances occurring at dawn and dusk, respectively. When the cultures were transferred from LD cycles to continuous dark (DD), the diel rhythm of Haaureol mRNA disappeared, indicating that Haaureol transcription is not under circadian clock control. At transitions from darkness to various wavelength light (red, white or blue spectrum), Haaureol transcript decreased, most markedly under blue light. These results suggest that HaAUREO1 is a blue light-sensitive negative gene regulator, which is probably driven by dark-to-light transitional cues and in turn regulates expression of other genes in the light dark cycle. This study provides a basis on which to elucidate the molecular network governing AUREO-mediated biological responses, and gain understanding on the role of light in H. akashiwo bloom formation.

In addition to genes encoding a GA-specific geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase and a bifunctional ent-copalyl diphosphate/ent-kaurene synthase, the cluster contains four cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes (P450-1, -2, -3, -4). Recently it was shown that P450-4 and P450-1 encode multifunctional enzymes catalyzing the three oxidation steps from ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenoic acid and the four oxidation steps from ent-kaurenoic acid to GA(14), respectively. Here we describe the functional analysis of the P450-2 gene by gene disruption and by expressing the gene in a mutant that lacks the entire GA biosynthesis gene cluster. Mutants in which P450-2 is inactivated by the insertion of a large piece of DNA accumulated GA(14) and lacked biosynthetically more advanced metabolites, indicating that the gene encodes a 20-oxidase. This was confirmed by incubating lines containing P450-2 in the absence of the other GA biosynthesis genes with isotopically labeled substrates. The P450-2 gene product oxidized the 3beta-hydroxylated intermediate, GA(14), and its non-hydroxylated analogue GA(12) to GA(4) and GA(9), respectively. Expression of P450-2 is repressed by high amounts of nitrogen in the culture medium but is not affected by the presence of biosynthetically advanced GAs, i.e. there is no evidence for feedback regulation. The fact that the GA 20-oxidase is a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase in G. fujikuroi and not a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase as in plants, together with the significant differences in regulation of gene expression, are further evidence for independent evolution of the GA biosynthetic pathways in plants and fungi.									70	2	0	0	57	0	80			0021-9258			WOS:000176286000018	11943776

Undoped and iodine-doped PbSe films of polycrystalline particles were coated on thermally oxidized silicon substrates by chemical bath deposition. The PbSe films were oxidized at 380 degrees C for 30 min and then iodinated at different iodine vapor pressures at 380 degrees C for 5 min. When the iodine vapor pressure was below 20 Pa, PbSeO3 was the main phase formed on the surface of PbSe microcrystals for both undoped and iodine-doped films. As the iodine vapor pressure was increased above 20 Pa, Pb3I2O2 and PbI2 phases were formed in both types of films and PbSeO3 disappeared in the undoped film. Only the iodine-doped films showed photo response. The sheet resistance and IR signal-to-noise ratio had maximum values at the iodine vapor pressure of 17.5 Pa in the iodine-doped film. The x-ray diffraction spectra, scanning electron microscopy morphologies, and EDS analyses of the sensitized PbSe films show that the main role of iodine in the sensitization is helping solid-state sintering of PbSe microcrystals which may lead to redistribution of oxygen atoms in the effective atomic sites.

Abundances of volatiles (OH, Cl and F) in apatite from terrestrial and extraterrestrial plutonic and volcanic rocks have been used to study volatile behavior in magmas, however, volatile diffusivities in apatite are poorly constrained. Here we report new experimental results on Cl, F and OH diffusivities in apatite and apply them to estimate magma ascent times and rates. The experiments were carried out on oriented natural Durango fluorapatite crystals at 800-1100 degrees C, 1-atm, and oxygen fugacity at the wilstite-magnetite buffer. Experimental charges and chemical profiles were investigated with a variety of methods, including scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and nuclear reaction analysis.We find that the concentration profiles of Cl show evidence of uphill diffusion that is likely related to the co-existence of three monovalent anions, i.e., OH-, Cl-, F-, at the same site of the apatite structure. Chemical gradients of OH, Cl and F were reproduced using a multicomponent diffusion model to extract the tracer diffusion coefficient (D-i*) of each component (i). The calculated values of D-i* parallel to the c-axis show a general relation of D-F* > D-Cl* > D-OH* and define the following Arrhenius relations (parallel to the c-axis, at 1 bar) as:D-Cl* = 7((+12)(-4) x 10(-5) x [exp(-294(+/- 12) kJ.mol(-1)/RT)]m(2).s(-1)D-F* = 5((+49)(-5) x 10(-4) x [exp(-308(+/- 76) kJ.mol(-1)/RT)]m(2).s(-1)D-OH* = 4((+11)(-3) x 10(-2) x [exp(-401(+/- 39) kJ.mol(-1)/RT)]m(2).s(-1)The activation energy for Cl diffusion that we determined (294 kJ.mol(-1)) is within the range of that reported by Brenan (1994), but the pre-exponential factor is smaller and thus we obtain in general slower diffusivities than Brenan (1994). D-Cl* and D-OH* parallel to the a-axis are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude slower than those parallel to the c-axis, indicating anisotropic diffusion of Cl and OH. Preliminary results on S diffusivity (parallel to the c-axis) at 800-900 degrees C show values between those of Cl and OH. The diffusion coefficients and model proposed in this study can be used to estimate the timescales of volatile re-equilibration in apatite in a variety of contexts from plutonic rocks and layered intrusions, to volcanic rocks and meteorites. We show that, for example, magma ascent rates can be determined by modelling Cl zoning in volcanic apatite. These applications provide new opportunities for understanding the influence of magma ascent rates on the eruption styles of volcanoes, thus having potential contributions to improving volcano forecasting and hazard assessments.

The erupted products are dominantly trachyandesite-trachyte (TT) lavas and pyroclasts, with minor mafic magmas including tephrite-basanite-trachybasalt and alkali olivine basalts emplaced as cinder cones at the base of the stratovolcano. The TT products are characterized by a mineral assemblage of clinopyroxene (diopside-augite), orthopyroxene (clinoenstatite), feldspar (An(2-58), Ab(6-69), Or(2-56)), high Ti phlogopite, F-apatite, Fe Ti oxides, and minor amounts of olivine (Fo(73-80)), amphibole and zircon, whereas olivine (Fo(78-88)), high Mg# (80-89) diopside, feldspar, apatite and Fe-Ti oxide occur in the mafic magmas. The presence of hydrous and anhydrous minerals, normal zonings, mafic cumulates, and the composition of magmatic inclusions in the TT products suggest evolutionary processes in polybaric conditions. In the same way, disequilibrium textures - including orthopyroxene mantled with clinopyroxene, reaction rim of phlogopite and amphibole, the coexistence of olivine and orthopyroxene, reverse, oscillatory and complex zonings of pyroxene and feldspar crystals - suggest magmatic evolutions in open systems with a varying temperature, oxygen fugacity, water as well as pressure and, to a lesser extent, melt chemistry. Mineral, assemblages are used to model the physicochemical conditions and assess default parameters for the thermodynamic simulation of crystallization using MELTS software to track the P-T-H20402 evolution of the magma plumbing system. Thermobarometry and MELTS models estimated the initial nucleation depth at 16-17 kb (56-60 km) for olivine (Fo(89)) and high Al diopside crystals occurring in the mafic primary magma; it then stopped and underwent fractionation between 8 and 10 kb (28-35 km), corresponding with Moho depth, and continued to differentiate in the lower crust, in agreement with the geophysical models. The mafic rocks were formed by crystal fractionation from the reconstructed primary magma (13 wt% MgO) with the minor role of recharge and crustal assimilation. Phenocrysts in TT lavas recorded a wide range of temperature and pressure of crystallization; at least three main levels of magma storage can be recognized according to the statistical analysis of the models, at 6-8 kb (22-28 km), 4-6 kb (15-22 km), and 0.6-3 kb (2-11 Km), respectively. The temperature of crystallization ranged from 1430 to 1180 degrees C for primary mafic magma to alkali olivine basalts and 1180-800 degrees C for TT suite. According to the current geophysical models, the present structure of the magma storage system in the crust beneath the Damavand volcano consists of three major accumulation zones located at 20 km, 6-8 km and 3-4.5 km depth. Our data enlarge this scenario, suggesting a more complex magma storage system strongly controlled by the transpressional tectonic regime. Multi-depth magma reservoirs may account for the local thickening of crust below the volcano. The polybaric fractionation model, using the MELTS algorithm, reproduces mineralogy and chemical variations of minerals and whole rock of the Damavand TT lavas. However, some discrepancies between major elements of models and trends of data can be ascribed to the recharge of more mafic magma, minor crustal assimilation, disaggregation of crystal-rich mushes and uptake of magmatic inclusions, as well as crystals from different crustal levels.The polybaric differentiation as the fractionation and/or accumulation of crystals was the probable mechanism for explaining the scarcity of mafic volcanic rocks at the Damavand volcano.

J	Witt, Andreas; Pozzi, Roberta; Diesch, Stephan; Haedicke, Oliver; Grammel, Hartmut								New light on ancient enzymes - in vitro CO2 Fixation by Pyruvate Synthase of Desulfovibrio africanus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius								FEBS JOURNAL				286	22			4494	4508		10.1111/febs.14981		JUL 2019		NOV 2019	2019	Two variants of the enzyme family pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), derived from the anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio africanus and the extremophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, respectively, were evaluated for their capacity to fixate CO2 in vitro. PFOR reversibly catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA and CO2 to pyruvate using ferredoxin as redox partner. The oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate is thermodynamically strongly favored, and most previous studies only considered the oxidative direction of the enzyme. To assay the pyruvate synthase function of PFOR during reductive carboxylation of acetyl-CoA is more challenging and requires to maintain the reaction far from equilibrium. For this purpose, a biochemical assay was established where low-potential electrons were introduced by photochemical reduction of EDTA/deazaflavin and the generated pyruvate was trapped by chemical derivatization with semicarbazide. The product of CO2 fixation could be detected as pyruvate semicarbazone by HPLC-MS. In a combinatorial approach, both PFORs were tested with ferredoxins from different sources. The pyruvate semicarbazone product could be detected with low-potential ferredoxins of the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum and of S. acidocaldarius whereas CO2 fixation was not supported by the native ferredoxin of D. africanus. Methylviologen as an artificial electron carrier also allowed CO2 fixation. For both enzymes, the results are the first demonstration of CO2 fixation in vitro. Both enzymes exhibited high stability in the presence of oxygen during purification and storage. In conclusion, the employed PFOR enzymes in combination with non-native ferredoxin cofactors might be promising candidates for further incorporation in biocatalytic CO2 conversion. Enzymes EC1.2.7.1.

The thermodynamic functions, standard enthalpy (Delta H degrees), Gibbs free energy (Delta G degrees), and entropy (Delta S degrees), of the reactants and products of these reactions were computed with A5 in the 3(10)-helical (A5(Hel)) and fully extended (A5(Ext)) conformations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) and B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) levels of theory, both in the gas phase and using the C-PCM implicit water model. With quantum chemical calculations, we have shown that H abstraction is the most favorable at the C-alpha followed by the C-beta, then amide N in a model helix. The secondary structure has a strong influence on the bond dissociation energy of the H-C-alpha, but a negligible effect on the dissociation energy of the H-CH2 and H-N bonds. The HO center dot radical is the strongest hydrogen abstractor, followed by HO2 center dot and finally O-2(-center dot). More importantly, secondary structure elements, such as H-bonds in the 3(10)-helix, protect the peptide from radical attack by hindering the potential electron delocalization at the C-alpha when the peptide is in the extended conformation. We also show that he unfolding of the A5 peptide radicals have a significantly higher propensity to unfold than the closed shell A5 peptide and confirm that only the HO center dot can initiate the unfolding of A5(Hel) and the formation of A5(Ext)(center dot). By comparing the structures, energies, and thermodynamic functions of A5 and its radical derivatives, we have shown how free radicals can initiate the unfolding of helical structures to beta-sheets in the cellular condition known as oxidative stress.									17	0	0	0	6	0	17			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000291709500035	21598923

Well temperatures ranged from 25 degrees to 82 degrees C and their depths from 30 to 150 m. Pools with temperatures of 26 degrees to 67 degrees C were also sampled on the northern flank of the Mt. Epomeo. The samples were analysed for bulk chemical composition, as well as H, O and C isotope composition. Isotopic analyses of water samples showed wide variations in both deuterium and oxygen-18, which ranged from -37.4 to +8.1 parts per thousand and -6.8 to 1.1 parts per thousand, respectively. Overall delta(13)C in total dissolved carbon (TDC) ranged from - 11.5 to + 2.3 parts per thousand, and computed delta(13)C Of CO2(g) results ranged from - 18.5 to -1.72 parts per thousand. Water samples with CO2 content of up to about 1 bar partial pressure exhibited delta(13)C((CO2)) ranging from -4 to - l parts per thousand. Water samples varied chemically from low-salinity HCO3 well waters (1-4 g/l) of essentially meteoric origin, to high-salinity C1 waters (up to 40 g/l) Mixing processes from local groundwater, seawater and evaporated waters have also been identified. Models for the chemical and isotopic data on the thermal manifestations have been developed for low- and high-pressure conditions in order to assess the isotopic composition of deep CO2, assuming that this component is continuously added to the solutions until degassing occurs at shallow depths or at the surface. Constraints due to the reaction of water with volcanic glass have been taken into account for in the computations in addition to those relative to the carbon components participating in the carbonate equilibria. Results from such simulations indicate that deep CO2 added to the shallow waters probably has a carbon isotope composition greater than or equal to -2 parts per thousand, which most likely stems from a mixed magmatic-sedimentary origin.

As one of the best and new type energy which is clean, renewable and zero pollution, solar energy is the best choice to achieve sustainable development, because it is an inexhaustible energy source. The issue that semiconductor photocatalysis can use solar light directly to conduct the photocatalytic reaction has aroused widely public concern. As a kind of low cost and non-metal photocatalyst, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) shows great application prospects in decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen, photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, carbon dioxide reduction, antibacterial, selective conversion of organic functional groups, as well as other fields, for its unique electronic band structure, thermal and chemical stability. But at present, g-C3N4 photocatalyst still exists some problems such as small specific surface area, low visible light utilization rate, low light quantum yield, and easy recombination of photo generated carriers which restrict its application in the field of photocatalysis. Therefore, it has become a key subject in the field of photocatalytic research to improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4. The first principles have the incomparable advantages over semi empirical method, which have become an important basis for the calculation and simulation in the field of photocatalytic research. The wide application of first principles based on density functional theory in the field of photocatalysis provides a clear research means to explore the method to improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 effectively and quickly. In this review, some important research progress in g-C3N4 modification in recent years is reviewed from the theoretical point of view, including element doping modification, composite modification, morphology control modification and other means of modification. The microscopic mechanism of improved photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 modified photocatalyst is studied, from the point of view of electronic properties, band structure, optical properties and defect formation energy. Finally, on the basis of summarizing various of the modification research mentioned above, the future development trend of g-C3N4 modified photocatalyst is discussed.									3	4	0	0	1	0	7			1005-281X			WOS:000389392700011

Compared to bare BiVO4, the BiVO4/Co-LaFeO3 composite photoanode shows a water oxidation photocurrent of 3.4 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V versus reverse hydrogen electrode, accompanied by a notable cathodic shift in the onset potential for 300 mV. Combined optical and electrochemical characterizations show that the solid/electrolyte charge transfer efficiency of BiVO4 are dramatically improved by the incorporation of Co-substituted LaFeO3. From the surface kinetic study of charge carriers by intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy, a suppressed surface recombination rate constant is observed and the enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting performance observed in the BiVO4/Co-LaFeO3 photoanode is attributed to the surface passivation effect of Co-substituted LaFeO3.									29	1	0	0	4	0	29			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526330900020	32212636

IRPs are cytosolic proteins that bind to iron-responsive elements (IREs) of the 5'- or 3'-untranslated regions (UTR) of mRNAs that encode many proteins involved in iron metabolism. In this study, we have cloned and described a new regulatory protein belonging to the family of IRPs from the earthworm Eisenia andrei (EaIRP). The earthworm IRE site in 5'-UTR of ferritin mRNA most likely folds into a secondary structure that differs from the conventional IRE structures of ferritin due to the absence of a typically unpaired cytosine that participates in protein binding. Prepared recombinant EaIRP and proteins from mammalian liver extracts are able to bind both mammalian and Eisenia IRE structures of ferritin mRNA, although the affinity of the rEaIRP/Eisenia IRE structure is rather low. This result suggests the possible contribution of a conventional IRE structure. When IRP is supplemented with a Fe-S cluster, it can function as a cytosolic aconitase. Cellular cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, as well as recombinant EaIRP, exhibit aconitase activity that can be abolished by the action of oxygen radicals. The highest expression of EaIRP was detected in parts of the digestive tract. We can assume that earthworms may possess an IRE/IRP regulatory network as a potential mechanism for maintaining cellular iron homeostasis, although the aconitase function of EaIRP is most likely more relevant.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1932-6203			WOS:000342670800103	25279857

The single crystals of AgAlS2 were grown by chemical vapor transport (CVT) method using ICl3 as a transport agent sealed in evacuated quartz tubes. The as-grown AgAlS2 crystals essentially possess a transparent and white color in vacuum. The crystal surface of AgAlS2 becomes darkened and brownish when putting AgAlS2 into atmosphere for reacting with water vapor or hydrogen gas. Undergoing the chemical reaction process, oxygen deficient AgAlO2-2x with brownish and reddish-like color on surface of AgAlS2 forms. The transition energy of deficient AgAlO2-2x was evaluated by TR experiment. The value was determined to be similar to 2.452 eV at 300 K. If the sample is kept dry and moved away from moisture, AgAlS2 crystal can stop forming more deficient AgAlO2-2x surface oxides. The experimental TR spectra for the surface-reacted sample show clearly two transition features at E-W=2.452 eV for deficient AgAlO2-2x and E-U=3.186 eV for AgAlS2, respectively. The E-U transition belongs to direct band-edge exciton of AgAlS2. Alternatively, for surface-oxidation process of AgAlS2 lasting for a long time, a AgAlO2 crystal with yellowish color will eventually form. The TR measurements show mainly a ground-state band edge exciton of E-OX(1) detected for AgAlO2. The energy was determined to be E-OX(1)=2.792 eV at 300 K. The valence-band electronic structure of AgAlS2 has been detailed characterized using polarized-thermoreflectance (PTR) measurements in the temperature range between 30 and 340 K. Physical chemistry behaviors of AgAlS2 and AgAlO2 have been comprehensively studied via detailed analyses of PTR and TR spectra. Based on the experimental analyses, optical and chemical behaviors of the AgAlS2 crystals under atmosphere are realized. A possible optical-detecting scheme for using AgAlS2 as a humidity sensor has also been proposed. Copyright 2012 Author(s).

Lateral edge exposures made by the nanoporous patterning provide electrical and optical characteristics that are different from the original materials. However, nanopatterning processes inevitably generate edge exposure and surface defects that may result in poor reliability and reproducibility of the devices. In this study, we propose a reliable method to passivate nanoporous molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) thin-film transistors (TFTs) using polymer thin films, synthesized by initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) to improve the electrical stability of nanoporous MoS2 TFTs. To this end, functional polymer films of electron-donating poly(1-vinylimidzole) (pVI) and inert poly(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl methacrylate) (pPFDMA) were utilized as passivation layers on nanoporous MoS2 TFTs. An n-type doping effect was observed in the pVI-deposited nanoporous MoS2 film due to the electron-donating imidazole ring, whereas the inert pPFDMA efficiently stabilized the electrical characteristics of the nanoporous MoS2 TFTs. Moreover, the hydrophobic fluoroalkyl chain of the pPFDMA film efficiently prevented oxygen and moisture adsorption on the nanoporous MoS 2 . The superior passivation effect of the pPFDMA layer was confirmed using gate-bias stress tests and long-term storage tests under ambient conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2397-7132		WOS:000770624100002

This study aimed to alter the catalytic activity of biochar by using chemical amendments as an alternative to biomass feedstock screening. Three types of amendments including nonmetal elements (urea for N, sodium dodecyl sulfate for S), transition metal elements (MnSO4 for Mn, FeSO4 for Fe), and alkali/alkaline-earth metal elements (CaCl2 for Ca, NaCl for Na) were added to biomass substrate (peanut shell) before pyrolysis at 950 degrees C to produce 6 different chemically amended BCs. Structure, functional groups, sorption and redox properties of the BCs were characterized, and the catalytic reactivity of the BCs for trichloroethylene (TCE) reduction with a layered iron (II, III) hydroxide (green rust) as reductant was tested.Amending BC with transition metals increased the specific surface area (SSA) of BC and in turn the adsorption affinity, while nonmetals and alkali/alkaline-earth metal amendments decreased SSA. The TCE dechlorination rate increased by 3.5 and 2.5 times for BCs amended with N and S, respectively, compared with Raw-BC, while amendments with Mn, Fe, Ca, and Na had minor effects on reactivity. A second-order kinetic model for TCE reduction was developed, pointing out the critical role of the BC reactive site concentration and competing adsorption of TCE to inreactive surfaces. A conceptual model is proposed for TCE reaction with reactive sites and inreactive adsorptive surfaces on BC. This study suggested demonstrates that the reactive sites density is critical for BC catalytic reactivity, and N amendment is most efficient for improving BC reactivity.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000727816400004

The physical and chemical properties of the as-synthesized nanoparticles were determined by XRD, SEM, EDS, BET, FTIR, XPS, UV-vis DRS, PL, EIS and photocurrent density. XRD patterns confirm that Eu and Tb ions are stably inserted into the framework of ZnO, and the crystallite size decreases to 21 nm compared to that of pure ZnO (32 nm) as the amount of co-dopants increases to optimal value (3 mol% of each). With the insertion of Eu and Tb ions into ZnO, the recombination rate of photo generated charge carriers is found to be low. It is observed that doped Eu and Tb ions can enter the lattice structure of ZnO with a suitable doping concentration, and the obtained doped ZnO have ordered hexagonal wurtzite structures and nearly spherical morphology with high specific surface area and high porosity. Meanwhile, the introduction of Eu and Tb ions can effectively extend the spectral response from UV to visible region for the catalysts, thus reducing the band gap from 3.25 to 2.91 eV. Further analysis by means of XPS measurement showed that the existence of mixture of Eu2+/Eu3+ and Tb3+/Tb4+ oxidation states and high content of the surface chemisorbed oxygen species also contributed to the high photocatalytic activity. It was found that Eu and Tb co-doped ZnO shows highly efficient and stable visible light activity and provides a 100% MB degradation within 15 min, while the degradation time for Eu doped ZnO and Tb doped ZnO is reduced gradually to 50 and 42 min, respectively to obtain the 100% MB degradation. It was also found that the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity over Eu and Tb co-doped ZnO can be significantly increased to 533.8 and 792 mu mol with 0.2 wt% catalyst dose and initial solution pH 9, respectively under similar conditions with good stability. Moreover, simultaneous introduction of Eu and Tb effectively promoted the yield of CH4 to 4.59 mu mol, which was 3.4 fold higher in comparison to pure ZnO. Thus the present approach could provide a versatile strategy for the synthesis of novel and efficient visible light activated photocatalysts.									55	4	0	0	2	0	57			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000509625700033

In the first stage of the process, titanate nanofibers reacted with dilute acid solution under moderate hydrothermal conditions, yielding the anatase nanocrystals on the fiber. In the subsequent heating process, the fibril core of titanate was converted into a TiO2(B) single crystal while the anatase crystals in the shell remained unchanged. The anatase nanocrystals do not attach to the TiO2(B) core randomly but coherently with a close crystallographic registry to the core to form a stable phase interface. For instance, (001) planes in anatase and (100) planes of TiO2(B) join together to form a stable interface. Such a unique structure has several features that enhance the photocatalytic activity of these fibers. First, the differences in the band edges of the two phases promote migration of the photogenerated holes from anatase shell to the TiO2(B) core. Second, the well-matched phase interfaces allow photogenerated electrons and holes to readily migrate across the interfaces because the holes migrate much faster than excited electrons, more holes than electrons migrate to TiO2(B) and this reduces the recombination of the photogenerated charges in anatase shell. Third, the surface of the anatase shell has both a strong ability to regenerate surface hydroxyl groups and adsorb O-2, the oxidant of the reaction, to yield reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH center dot) through reaction between photogenerated holes and surface hydroxyl groups. The adsorbed O-2 molecules can capture the excited electrons on the surface, forming reactive O-2(-) species. The more reactive species generated on the external surface, the higher the photocatalytic activity will be, and generation of the reactive species also contributes to reducing recombination of the photogenerated charges. Indeed, the mixed-phase nanofibers exhibited superior photocatalytic activity for degradation of sulforhodamine B under UV light to the nanofibers of either pure phase alone or mechanical mixtures of the pure phase nanofibers with a similar phase composition. Finally, the nanofibril morphology has an additional advantage that they can be separated readily after reaction for reuse by sedimentation. This is very important because the high cost for separating the catalyst nanocrystals has seriously impeded the applications of TiO2 photocatalysts on an industrial scale.									465	43	1	0	36	1	478			0002-7863			WOS:000273028800039	19911792	
J	Kimura, Y; Mizusawa, N; Yamanari, T; Ishii, A; Ono, T								Structural changes of D1 C-terminal alpha-carboxylate during S-state cycling in photosynthetic oxygen evolution								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				280	3			2078	2083		10.1074/jbc.M410627200				JAN 21 2005	2005	Changes in the chemical structure of alpha-carboxylate of the D1 C-terminal Ala-344 during S-state cycling of photosynthetic oxygen-evolving complex were selectively measured using light-induced Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy in combination with specific [C-13]alanine labeling and site-directed mutagenesis in photosystem II core particles from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Several bands for carboxylate symmetric stretching modes in an S-2/S-1 FTIR difference spectrum were affected by selective C-13 labeling of the alpha-carboxylate of Ala with L-[1-C-13] alanine, whereas most of the isotopic effects failed to be induced in a site-directed mutant in which Ala-344 was replaced with Gly. Labeling of the alpha-methyl of Ala with L-[3-C-13] alanine had much smaller effects on the spectrum to induce isotopic bands due to a symmetric CH3 deformation coupled with the alpha-carboxylate. The isotopic bands for the alpha-carboxylate of Ala-344 showed characteristic changes during S-state cycling. The bands appeared prominently upon the S-1-to-S-2 transition and to a lesser extent upon the S-2-to-S-3 transition but reappeared at slightly upshifted frequencies with the opposite sign upon the S-3-to-S-0 transition. No obvious isotopic band appeared upon the S-0-to-S-1 transition. These results indicate that the alpha-carboxylate of C-terminal Ala-344 is structurally associated with a manganese ion that becomes oxidized upon the S-1-to-S-2 transition and reduced reversely upon the S-3-to-S-0 transition but is not associated with manganese ion(s) oxidized during the S-0-to-S-1 (and S-2-to-S-3) transition(s). Consistently, L-[1-C-13] alanine labeling also induced spectral changes in the low frequency (670-350 cm(-1)) S-2/S-1 FTIR difference spectrum.									63	0	0	0	44	0	63			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000226341700042	15542597

The obtained data revealed (i) the extent of light-induced formation of about one Q(A)(-.) per 230 chlorophylls (Chl) remains virtually invariant to dehydration down to the lowest values of relative humidity (6-8% RH); (ii) a decrease of the RH to 30% leads to severe blockage of the electron transfer from Q(A)(-.) to Q(B) and the progressive replacement of water oxidation by photooxidation of high potential (HP) cytochrome (Cyt) b559 in untreated PS II samples or accessory Chl and carotenoid (Car) molecules in samples with preoxidized Cyt b559; (iii) photooxidation of Cyt b559 is followed by its photoreduction, concomitant with photooxidation of Chl and Car; (iv) in dry samples with preoxidized Cyt b559, not more than a half of total Cyt b559 can be photochemically reduced, independent of the extent of Cyt b559 in the HP form; (v) at low RH values, Cyt b559 photoreduction in samples with preoxidized heme groups and photoaccumulation of Q(A)(-.) take place with biphasic kinetics with similar rate constants for both processes; (vi) Cyt b559 photoreduction in dry samples is DCMU insensitive, while the dark rereduction of photooxidized Cyt b559 is inhibited by DCMU; (vii) fast and slow kinetic phases of Cyt b559 photoreduction dramatically differ in their dependencies on the intensity of CW illumination and are associated with electron donation to Cyt b559 from Q(A)(-.) and pheophytin(-.) respectively. The pathways of light-induced electron transfer in PS II involving Cyt b559 are discussed.									30	0	0	0	25	0	32			0006-2960			WOS:000184100200003	12846561

Herein, micro-meso-macroporous FeCo-N-C-X (denoted as "M-FeCo-N-C-X", X represents Fe/Co molar ratio in bimetallic zeolite imidazole frameworks FeCo-ZIFs) catalysts derived from hierarchical M-FeCo-ZIFs-X was prepared. The micropores in M-FeCo-N-C-X have strong capability in O-2 capture as well as dictate the nucleation and early-stage deposition of Li-O-2, the mesopores provided a channel for the electrolyte wetting, and the macroporous structure promoted more available active sites when used as cathode for Li-O-2 batteries. More importantly, M-FeCoN-C-0.2 based cathode showed a high initial capacity (18,750 mAh g 40.1 Ag-1), good rate capability (7900 mAhg(-1)@0.5 Ag-1), and cycle stability up to 192 cycles. Interestingly, the FeCo-N-C-0.2 without macropores suffered relatively poorer stability with only 75 cycles, although its discharge capacity was still as high as 17,200 mAh g(-1)(@0.1 Ag-1). The excellent performance attributed to the synergistic contribution of homogeneous Fe, Co nanoparticles and N co-doping carbon frameworks with special micromeso-macroporous structure. The results showed that hierarchical FeCo-N-C architectures are promising cathode catalysts for Li-O-2 batteries.

Their similarity to natural photosynthesis, utilizing sunlight and water, has provoked intense research for over half a century. Among many potential photocatalysts, BiVO4, with a bandgap of 2.4-2.5 eV, has emerged as a highly promising photoanode material with a good chemical stability, environmental inertness, and low cost. Unfortunately, its charge transport properties are modest, at most a hole diffusion length (L-p) of approximate to 70 nm. However, recent rapid developments in multiple modification strategies have elevated it to a position as the most promising metal oxide photoanode material. This review summarizes developments in BiVO4 photoanodes in the past 10 years, in which time it has continuously broken its own performance records for PEC water oxidation. Effective modification techniques are discussed, including synthesis of nanostructures/nanopores, external/internal doping, heterojunction fabrication, surface passivation, and cocatalysts. Tandem systems for unassisted solar water splitting and PEC production of value-added chemicals are also discussed.									242	16	0	0	12	0	245			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000471970500015	30793384

Boron-doped diamond (BDD) is widely used as an electrode material for generating (OH)-O-center dot radicals because it has a very large kinetic overpotential for O-2 production, thus increasing electrochemical efficiency for (OH)-O-center dot production. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of O-2 and( center dot)OH production at diamond electrodes are not well understood. We demonstrate that boron-doped diamond surfaces functionalized with hydrophobic, polyfluorinated molecular ligands (PF-BDD) have significantly higher electrochemical efficiency for (OH)-O-center dot production compared with hydrogen-terminated (H-BDD), oxidized (O-BDD), or poly(ethylene ether)-functionalized (E-BDD) boron-doped diamond samples. Our measurements show that (OH)-O-center dot production is nearly independent of surface functionalization and pH (pH = 7.4 vs 9.2), indicating that (OH)-O-center dot is produced by oxidation of H2O in an outer-sphere electron-transfer process. In contrast, the total electrochemical current, which primarily produces O-2, differs strongly between samples with different surface functionalizations, indicating an inner-sphere electron-transfer process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show that although both H-BDD and PF-BDD electrodes are oxidized over time, PF-BDD showed longer stability (approximate to 24 h of use) than H-BDD. This work demonstrates that increasing surface hydrophobicity using perfluorinated ligands selectively inhibits inner-sphere oxidation to O-2 and therefore provides a pathway to increased efficiency for formation of (OH)-O-center dot via an outer-sphere process. The use of hydrophobic electrodes may be a general approach to increasing selectivity toward outer-sphere electron-transfer processes in aqueous media.									27	0	0	0	5	0	26			0743-7463			WOS:000458937400018	30550713

Herein, a new insight into the inducer role of Mt. in structure-tuning of CN at nanoand molecular scales were researched. Results showed that the pores and interlayers of Mt. induced the spatialconfined polymerization of precursors urea (U)/melamine (M), obtaining the highly dispersed CN nanosheets; simultaneously, the Al/Mg-OH groups and interlayer Na cations of Mt. induced the self O, Na, Mg, Al elements from Mt. to dope into the CN framework. It is found that the advantage of urea in nanostructure construction of CN nanosheets for the CN-U/Mt. composite with larger specific surface area, and the superiority of melamine in multi-element doping for CN-M/Mt. with a narrowed band gap. Therefore, the optimal CN-UM/Mt. composite showed the highest activity for Rhodamine B (RhB) photodegradation with a reaction time of 60 min and an apparent rate constant of 0.053 min 1, which is better than most other g-C3N4/clay minerals composites. The enhanced activity could be owing to the high adsorption of Mt., large specific surface area of CN nanosheets, and the adjusted band structure originated from the comprehensive effects of CN nanosheets, nonmetal O- and metal cations doping induced by Mt., enabling a narrowed band gap with strengthened visible-light adsorption and an enhanced photogenerated carrier separation efficiency. Furthermore, in terms of the semiconductor mechanism, it showed more reactive oxygen species of O-1(2) (main) and center dot O-2 (secondary) for effective RhB degradation, but without the typical holes. This work indicates the great potential of Mt. as an inducer in structure tuning of g-C3N4 for efficient photocatalytic purification.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-1317	1872-9053		WOS:000795333400001

Delicate design of heterojunction photocatalysts by coupling the semiconductors at nanoscale with well-matched geometrical and electronic alignments is an effective strategy to ameliorate the charge separation. Here a facile and environment-friendly L-cysteine-assisted hydrothermal process under weakly alkaline conditions is demonstrated for the first time to fabricate ZnIn2S4/In(OH)(3) hollow microspheres with intimate contact, which are verified by XRD, SEM, (HR)TEM, XPS, N-2 adsorption-desorption, UVeVis DRS and photoluminescence spectra. ZnIn2S4/In(OH)(3) heterostructure (L-cys/Zn2+ = 4, molar ratio) with a band-gap of 2.50 eV, demonstrates the best photocatalytic performance for water reduction and MB degradation under visible light, outperforming its counterparts (In(OH)(3) and ZnIn2S4). The excellent activity of ZnIn2S4/In(OH)(3) heterostructure arises from the intercrossed band-edge positions as well as the unique hollow structure with large surface area and wide pore-size distribution, which are beneficial for the efficient charge migration from bulk to surface as well as at the interface between ZnIn2S4 and In(OH)(3). This work provides an efficient and eco-friendly strategy for one-pot synthesis of heterostructured composites with intimate contact for photocatalytic application.

J	Park, Youngjin; Stanley, David W.; Kim, Yonggyun								Eicosanoids up-regulate production of reactive oxygen species by NADPH-dependent oxidase in Spodoptera exigua phagocytic hemocytes								JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY				79				63	72		10.1016/j.jinsphys.2015.06.005				AUG 2015	2015	Eicosanoids mediate cellular immune responses in insects, including phagocytosis of invading microbes. Phagocytosis entails two major steps, the internalization of microbes and the subsequent killing of them via formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we posed the hypothesis that eicosanoids mediate ROS production by activating NADPH-dependent oxidase (NOX) and tested the idea in the model insect, Spodoptera exigua. A NOX gene (we named SeNOX4) was identified and cloned, yielding a full open reading frame encoding 547 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 63,410 Da and an isoelectric point at 9.28. A transmembrane domain and a large intracellular domain containing NADPH and FAD-binding sites were predicted. Phylogenetic analysis indicated SeNOX4 clusters with other NOX4 genes. SeNOX4 was expressed in all life stages except eggs, and exclusively in hemocytes. Bacterial challenge and, separately, arachidonic acid (AA, a precursor of eicosanoid biosynthesis) injection increased its expression. The internalization step was assessed by counting hemocytes engulfing fluorescence-labeled bacteria. The phagocytic behavior was inhibited by dsRNA suppression of SeNOX4 expression and, separately by dexamethasone (DEX, a specific inhibitor of eicosanoid biosynthesis) treatments. However, injecting AA to dsSeNOX4-treated larvae did not rescue the phagocytic activity. Hemocytic ROS production increased following bacterial challenge, which was sharply reduced in dsSeNOX4-treated, and separately, in DEX-treated larvae. AA partially reversed the suppressed ROS production in dsSeNOX4-treated larvae. Treating larvae with either the ROS-suppressing dsSeNOX4 construct or DEX rendered experimental larvae unable to inhibit bacterial proliferation in their hemocoels. We infer that eicosanoids mediate ROS production during phagocytosis by inducing expression of SeNOX4. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, two 14-3-3 cDNAs were identified from the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai (designated 14-3-3 zeta and 14-3-3 epsilon), possessing 59.40% identity with each other. Both genes were predominantly expressed in the gills of unchallenged abalones, and their mRNA signals could also be detected in several other tissues, including the mantle, hepatopancreas and ovary. However, after Vibrio harveyi challenge, hemocytes were induced significantly (p < 0.01). Meanwhile, phagocytosis was inhibited, but apoptosis, reactive oxygen species formation, and caspase 3 expression were significantly induced (p < 0.01), and they were all suppressed with 14-3-3 zeta knockdown (p < 0.01). The differences were that silencing 14-3-3 epsilon reverted the decline in the phagocytic rate derived from bacterial infection, while ROS formation was not influenced significantly. In addition, the expression levels of several antimicrobial peptide and proinflammatory cytokine genes were also decreased with the silencing of 14-3-3 genes. However, with the knockdown of 14-3-3 zeta, the expression of 14-3-3 epsilon was further significantly increased (p < 0.01), and vice versa. Overall, our results suggested that 14-3-3 zeta and 14-3-3 epsilon should play important roles in innate immunity against V. harveyi infection.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0145-305X	1879-0089		WOS:000692706800002	34153282

There are a limited number of animal models available for evaluating and developing new therapies. Most models represent late exudative or neovascular AMD (nAMD) but there is a relative paucity of models that mimic early events in AMD. The purpose of this study is to characterize the evolution of oxidative stress, inflammation, retinal degeneration and neovascularization in a rat model of AMD, created by subretinal injection of human lipid hydroperoxide (HpODE) that found in the sub-macular region in aged and AMD patients. Subretinal HpODE induced retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and retinal degeneration resulting in loss of RPE cells, photoreceptors and retinal thinning. RPE degeneration and atrophy were detected by day 5, followed by neural tissue degeneration at day 12 with robust TUNEL positive cells. Western blot analysis confirmed an increase in pro-apoptotic Bak protein at day 12 in retinal tissues. Oxidative damage biomarkers (4-hydroxynonenal, malondialdehyde, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, and nitrotyrosine) increased in retinal tissue from days 5-12. Muller glial activation was observed in the HpODE injected area at day 5 followed by its remodeling and migration in the outer retina by day 20. RT-qPCR analysis further indicated upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6) both in retinal and RPE/choroidal tissue as early as day 2 and persisted until day 12. Upregulation of oxidative stress markers such as NADPH oxidase (NOX and DOUX family) was detected early in retinal tissue by day 2 followed by its upregulation in choroidal tissue at day 5. Neovascularization was demonstrated from day 12 to day 20 post HpODE injection in choroidal tissue. The results from this study indicate that subretinal HpODE induces advanced AMD phenotypes comprising many aspects of both dry/early and late) and neovascular/late AMD as observed in humans. Within 3 weeks via oxidative damage, upregulation of reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory genes, pro-apoptotic Bak and pro-angiogenic VEGF upregulation occurs leading to CNV formation. This experimental model of subretinal HpODE is an appropriate model for the study of AMD and provides an important platform for translational and basic research in developing new therapies particularly for early/dry AMD where currently no viable therapies are available.									16	0	0	0	9	0	16			0014-4835	1096-0007		WOS:000617822500001	33307075

Despite its economic impact,the genetic diversity is rarely understood. In this study,based on the genetic differentiation and structural variation of mitochondrial ATP synthase gene of C. chinensis in different regions,the influence of environmental selection pressure,especially the geographical altitude,on the genetic diversity and the phylogenetic structure of different geographical populations of C. chinensis was studied,and the changes of bases as well as their amino acid sequence structure of ATP synthase gene in adapting to environmental pressure were discussed,which is important to provide theoretical basis for establishing a control strategy of this pest.【Method】The populations of camellia weevil at different geographical altitudes were collected from the main oil-tea production areas. The specific primers of ATP synthase gene were designed and the ATP synthase gene was amplified by PCR. Genetic diversity and phylogenetic structure were estimated based on ATP gene sequences,and the structural differences of amino acids sequences and frequency were moreover analyzed.【Result】Genetic diversity and the phylogenetic structure of C. chinensis were inferred using the sequences of ATP synthase gene among different geographical populations. Thirty-two haplotypes ( NCBI: MH560360-MH560391) in 119 individuals from all the sample regions in China were obtained. There was no obvious regularity in the genetic diversity differentiation of various geographical populations of camellia weevil ( Nucleotide diversity pi: 0.000 86-0.048 03). The population expansion of camellia weevil was not significant ( Tajima's D< 0,P> 0.05; Fu's Fs > 0). Based on the geographical altitudes,all the samples of camellia weevil can significantly divided into two branches ( F_(st)= 0.374,P<0.001) under different selection pressures ( Choice index: omega_(high altitude) = 1.65,omegalow altitude = 2.26,LRT P<0.001). ATP8 gene in the samples of low altitude branch ( 36 conservative sites) was more conservative compared to that in high altitude branch ( 27 conservative sites),and acidic amino acid utilization rate in high altitude branch was higher than that in low altitude branch,which might be related to the increase of protein stability,oxygen binding efficiency and oxidative respiratory efficiency of insects to adapt to high altitude.【Conclusion】The differentiation degree of ATP synthase gene in C. chinensis populations is low,but there is significant adaptation evolution to geographical altitude.			【目的】基于不同地区茶籽象线粒体ATP合成酶基因遗传分化及结构变异,研究环境压力尤其是海拔对茶籽象不同地理种群遗传多样性及系统发育关系的影响,探讨ATP合成酶基因在适应环境压力中碱基及氨基酸序列结构变化规律,为茶籽象防控提供理论依据。【方法】采集不同地理海拔油茶产区的茶籽象种群,设计ATP合成酶基因特异性引物,PCR扩增获取ATP基因,基于ATP基因应用相关分析软件分析碱基序列遗传多样性及系统发育关系,分析氨基酸序列结构差异及氨基酸使用频率。【结果】获得32个单倍型( NCBI: MH560360-MH560391),其中存在5个共享单倍型,包含个体数2 ~ 36不等;茶籽象各地理种群遗传多样性分化无明显规律(核酸多样性pi为0. 000 86 ~ 0. 048 03),茶籽象种群扩张不明显( Tajima's D < 0,P> 0. 05; Fu's Fs > 0);依据地理海拔,茶籽象种群可显著聚为低海拔和高海拔2个分支,2个分支间受到显著的环境正选择(选择系数:高海拔 omega= 1. 65,低海拔omega= 2. 26,LRT P < 0. 001),分化明显( F_(st)= 0. 374,P< 0. 001);低海拔分支ATP8编码解氨基酸序列( 36个保守位点)较高海拔分支( 27个保守位点)更为保守,且高海拔分支酸性氨基酸使用率较高,这可能与昆虫为适应高海拔而增加蛋白稳定性、提高氧结合效率以及氧化呼吸效率有关。【结论】茶籽象种群ATP合成酶基因分化程度不高,但存在对海拔明显的适应性进化。						0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1001-7488			CSCD:6537389

Water-oxidation catalysis								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				40	2			329	337		10.1021/ic000552i				JAN 15 2001	2001	The novel bridging ligand 1,8-bis(2,2':6',2"-terpyridyl)anthracene (btpyan) is synthesized by three reactions from 1,8-diformylanthracene to connect two [Ru(L)(OH)](+) units (L = 3,6-di-tert-butyl-1,2;benzoquinone (3,6-Bu-t(2)-qui) and 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy)). An addition of (BuOK)-Bu-t (2.0 equiv) to a methanolic solution of [Ru-2(II)(OH)(2)(3,6-(t)Bu(2)qui)(2)(btpyan)](SbF6)(2) ([1](SbF6)(2)) results in the generation of [Ru-2(II)(O)(2)(3,6-(t)Bu(2)sq)(2)(btpyan)](0) (3,6-(t)Bu(2)sq = 3,6 -di-tert-butyl-1,2-semiquinone) due to the reduction of quinone coupled with the dissociation of the hydroxo protons. The resultant complex [Ru-2(II)(O)(2)(3,6-(t)Bu(2)sq)(2)(btpyan)](0) undergoes ligand-localized oxidation at E-1/2 = +0.40 V (vs Ag/AgCl) to give [Ru-2(II)(O)(2)(3,6-(t)Bu(2)qui)(2)(btpyan)](2+) in MeOH solution: Furthermore, metal-localized oxidation of [Ru-2(II)(O)(2)(3, 6-(t)Bu(2)qui)(2)(btpyan)](2+) at E-p = + 1.2 V in CF3CH2OH/etheq or water gives [Ru-2(III)(O)(2)(3,6-(t)Bu(2)qui)(2)(btpyan)](4+), which catalyzes water oxidation. Controlled-potential electrolysis of [1](SbF6)(2) at +1.70 V in the presence of H2O in CF3CH2OH evolves dioxygen with a current efficiency of 91% (21 turnovers). The turnover number of O-2 evolution increases to 33 500 when the electrolysis is conducted in water (pH 4.0) by using a [1](SbF6)(2)-modified ITO electrode. On the other hand, the analogous complex [Ru-2(II)(OH)(2)(bpy)(2)(btpyan)](SbF6)(2) ([2](SbF6)(2)) shows neither dissociation of the hydroxo protons, even in the presence of a large excess of (BuOK)-Bu-t, nor activity for the oxidation of H2O under similar conditions.									166	2	0	0	19	0	168			0020-1669			WOS:000166368600022	11170540

J. Schiller (Dinophyceae), Prymnesium parvum f. patelliferum (J. C. Green, D. J. Hibberd et Pienaar) A. Larsen (Coccolithophyceae), and Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin (Bacillariophyceae), grown at 15 degrees C and 80 mu mol photons . m(-2) . s(-1). Photosynthesis versus irradiance curves were measured at seven temperatures (0 degrees C-30 degrees C) by all three approaches. The maximum photosynthetic rate (P-max(C)) was strongly stimulated by temperature, reached an optimum for Pro. minimum only (20 degrees C-25 degrees C), and showed a similar relative temperature response for the three applied methods, with Q(10) ranging from 1.7 to 3.5. The maximum light utilization coefficient (alpha(C)) was insensitive or decreased slightly with increasing temperature. Absolute rates of O-2 production were calculated from pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometry measurements in combination with biooptical determination of absorbed quanta in PSII. The relationship between PAM-based O-2 production and measured O-2 production and C-14 assimilation showed a species-specific correlation, with 1.2-3.3 times higher absolute values of P-max(C) and alpha(C) when calculated from PAM data for Pry. parvum and Ph. tricornutum but equivalent for Pro. minimum. The offset seemed to be temperature insensitive and could be explained by a lower quantum yield for O-2 production than the theoretical maximum (due to Mehler-type reactions). Conclusively, the PAM technique can be used to study temperature responses of photosynthesis in microalgae when paying attention to the absorption properties in PSII.									47	0	1	0	37	0	48			0022-3646	1529-8817		WOS:000254991300023	27041204

The photocatalysts with confined defects can effectively control the photogenerated carrier migration, but the metastability of such defects considerably decreases the photocatalyst stability. Meanwhile, the introduction of defective region can increase the coordinative unsaturation and delocalize local electrons to promote their interactions with the molecules/ions in that region. The selective growth of modulated heterogeneous interface by defect-induced strategy may not only increase the stability of defective structures, but also enhance the migration of interfacial charges. Using this method, photocatalytic heterostructures with low contact resistances and intimate interfaces are constructed to achieve the optimal charge migration in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In this work, the point, linear, and planar heterogeneous interfaces and related defect engineering techniques are discussed. Particularly, it is focused on the external, defect-induced interfacial heterogeneities with various spatial and dimensional configurations, which exhibit modulated and controllable interfacial properties. Furthermore, the main aspects of fabricating photocatalyst heterostructures by the defect-induced strategy, including the i) controllable generation of defects, ii) advanced characterization methods, and iii) elaborate construction of the minimal interface, are described.									27	2	0	0	2	0	28			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000596772800001	33289948

The electrocatalytic performance of SAECs is closely related to the specific metal species and their local atomic environments, including their coordination number, the determined structure of the coordination sites, and the chemical identity of nearest and second nearest neighboring atoms. The wide range of distinct chemical bonding configurations of a single-metal atom with its surrounding host atoms creates virtually limitless opportunities for the rational design and synthesis of SAECs with tunable local atomic environment for high-performance electrocatalysis. In this review, the authors first identify fundamental hurdles in electrochemical conversions and highlight the relevance of SAECs. They then critically examine the role of the local atomic structures, encompassing the first and second coordination spheres of the isolated metal atoms, on the design of high-performance SAECs. The relevance of single-atom dopants for host activation is also discussed. Insights into the correlation between local structures of SAECs and their catalytic response are analyzed and discussed. Finally, the authors summarize major challenges to be addressed in the field of SAECs and provide some perspectives in the rational construction of superior SAECs for a wide range of electrochemical conversions.									76	1	0	0	3	0	76			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000596127000001	33283369

Nickel dichalcogenides (Ni3S2, NiS, Ni3Se2, NiSe, etc.) are promising materials for high-performance electrochemical energy storage and conversion applications. Herein, 3D Ni3S2 nanorod arrays are fabricated on Ni foam by a facile solvothermal route. The optimized Ni3S2/Ni foam electrode displays an areal capacity of 1602 mu A h cm(-2) at 5 mA cm(-2), excellent rate capability and cycling stability. Besides, 3D Ni3S2 nanorod arrays as electrode materials exhibit outstanding performances for the overall water splitting reaction. In particular, the 3D Ni3S2 nanorod array electrode is shown to be a high-performance water electrolyzer with a cell voltage of 1.63 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting.

To address these challenges, this work demonstrates the construction of dual co-catalysts modified Fe2O3 nanorods photoanode by strategically incorporating CoPi and Co(OH) (x) for photoelectrochemical water oxidation. The Fe2O3/CoPi/Co(OH) (x) nanorods photoanode exhibits the lowest ever turn-on potential of 0.4 V (RHE) (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) and a photocurrent density of 0.55 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V (RHE), 358% higher than that of pristine Fe2O3 nanorods. The dual co-catalysts modification enhances the light-harvesting efficiency, surface photovoltage and hole transfer kinetics of the hybrid photoanode. The dual co-catalyst coupling also increases the carrier density and significantly reduces the depletion width (1.9 nm), resulting in improved conductivity and favorable band bending, boosting photogenerated hole transfer efficiency for water oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000780059000001	35303734

Herein, we report an efficient hybrid photocatalyst for water oxidation, consisting of a ruthenium polypyridyl complex covalently grafted on core/shell Fe@FeOx nanoparticles via a phosphonic acid group. The photoelectrochemical measurements were performed under 1 sun illumination in 1 M KOH. The photocurrent density of this hybrid photoanode reached 20 mu A/cm(2) (applied potential of +1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode), corresponding to a turnover frequency of 0.02 s(-1). This performance represents a 9-fold enhancement of that achieved with a mixture of Fe@FeOx nanoparticles and a linker-free ruthenium polypyridyl photosensitizer. This increase in performance could be attributed to a more efficient electron transfer between the ruthenium photosensitizer and the Fe@FeOx catalyst as a consequence of the covalent link between these two species through the phosphonate pendant group.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000752872400005	34726907

The catalytic activity of the photocatalyst was investigated via bisphenol A (BPA) photocatalitic degradation. The results showed that the photodegradation efficiencies of BPA catalyzed by LaCoO3/AC/Ag3PO4 (2:1:10) composite (reached 99 % after 50 min) was superior to those catalyzed by LaCoO3, Ag3PO4, and LaCoO3/Ag3PO4 (2:10). The BPA photodegradation followed the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, the photodegradation rate constants k catalyzed by LaCoO3/AC/Ag3PO4 (2:1:10) was 10.88 times of that catalyzed by Ag3PO4, 1.56 times of that catalyzed by LaCoO3/Ag3PO4 (2:10). Based on the results of characterization and the experiments of trapping active species in photocatalytic degradation process, the transfer of photo-generated carriers and Z-scheme LaCoO3/AC/Ag3PO4 heterojunctions photocatalytic mechanism were proposed. Furthermore, the possible BPA degradation pathways were involved in hydroxylation, oxidation, ketonization and cyclic cleavage. Z-scheme LaCoO3/AC/Ag3PO4 heterojunctions can be used as an efficient photocatalyst for practical applications in the removal of endocrine disrupting chemical.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000776698400002

In Korea, the fluoride-rich groundwaters are normally associated with rock types, especially granite and gneiss. In Gimcheon, high-fluoride groundwaters (up to a maximum of 2.15 mg/L) were observed with bimodal distribution of concentrations. The groundwater in this area showed relatively high concentrations of anthropogenic chemicals such as nitrate, chloride, and sulfate. Statistical analysis showed that fluoride is positively correlated with pH, alkalinity, sodium, and lithium, indicating that the interaction with granite is the main cause enriching its concentration. In Gimcheon, delta O-18 data of groundwater showed a negative correlation with nitrate and can be used as an indicator of groundwater age. The four samples of fluoride-rich groundwater were plotted in the light delta D and delta O-18 region, showing that they were the result of long water-rock reaction. However, other groundwater with a low-fluoride concentration was evenly distributed throughout all delta D and delta O-18 ranges and did not show a statistically significant correlation with nitrate, indicating possible mixing with another source of fluoride. Considering the influence from the surface on the geochemical characteristics of groundwater in this area, anthropogenic sources including phosphate fertilizer containing fluoride and pesticides may also have partly contributed to the concentrations of fluoride in the low-fluoride groundwater. The scattered distribution of fluoride-rich groundwater and the significant correlation with lithium suggest that pegmatite is the main rock type increasing fluoride concentration in this area.									54	2	0	0	32	0	56			1866-6280	1866-6299		WOS:000291486400022
