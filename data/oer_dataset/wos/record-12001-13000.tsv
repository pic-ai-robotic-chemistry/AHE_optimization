In this paper, ZnO/amorphous-FeOOH core-shell nanorod array is fabricated on Ni foil via a simple two-step chemical bath method and used as OER catalyst. Amorphous FeOOH possesses more O defects than crystalline FeOOH. Besides, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results reveal that the strong electron interactions on nano-interface between ZnO and FeOOH facilitate charge transfer from FeOOH to ZnO. Due to these advantages, the ZnO/amorphous-FeOOH hybrid nanorods exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance for OER, with an overpotential of 301 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1), and outstanding stability.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000529691600012

Inspired by the metal/metal oxides catalysts, we hydrothermally synthesized Ir-IrO2 composites duly confirmed by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), X-ray absorption data, and transmission electron microscope results. A low onset over-potential of merely 234 mV and a Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1) were obtained for the prepared catalyst Ir-IrO2_0.5AF. In addition, Ir-IrO2_0.5AF catalyst retained high activity for long time under constant potential polarization. The enhanced performance is attributed to the introduction of lower valence Ir as hydrogen acceptor: hydrogen transfers from -OOH intermediate in OER to adjacent H acceptor site, forming intermediate with relatively lower Gibbs free energy, and resulting in higher activity. The present study emphasizes on important role of the lower valence composition in launching H acceptors and providing wide opportunities toward rational designing of efficient and stable electro-catalysts.									11	0	1	0	0	0	12			0098-6445	1563-5201		WOS:000435526800010

This report addresses an improved activity toward oxygen evolution by a composite of cobalt-polyoxometalate [Co-4(H2O)(2)(PW9O34)(2)](10-) (CoPOM) and an ionic polymer, poly(vinyl butyl imidazolium) (PVIM), in highly alkaline media. PVIM provides a stable platform for CoPOM and acts as a conductive linker between CoPOM and the electrode surface, forming a concrete solid composite, which balances the multinegative charge of CoPOM synergistically. This improved stability and conductivity of CoPOM by PVIM in the PVIM-CoPOM composite performs remarkable electrocatalytic water oxidation with a very low overpotential of 0.20 V and a very high current density of 250 mA/cm(2) (at 1.75 V vs RHE) with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 52.8 s(-1) in 1 M NaOH.									22	1	0	0	2	0	23			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000451100500022	30339354

Cyclic voltammograms were collected at individual nanoparticles (NPs) with scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) and correlated with particle morphology imaged by electron microscopy. Nanoscale measurements from a statistically informative set of individual NPs revealed that Au NCs have superior HER electrocatalytic activity compared to that of Au ODs, in good agreement with macroscale cyclic voltammetry measurements. Au NCs exhibited more particle-to-particle variation in catalytic activity compared to that with Au ODs. The approach of single-particle SECCM imaging coupled with macroscale CV on well-defined NPs provides a powerful toolset for the design and activity assessment of nanoscale electrocatalysts.									52	1	0	0	2	0	53			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000514255400052	31917592

By using manganese dioxide spheres as both the redox initiator and the self-sacrificing template for the in-situ interfacial polymerization of aniline monomers, we demonstrated a facile approach to preparing porous polyaniline spheres in the presence of physic acid. Subsequent pyrolysis led to nitrogen and phosphorous co-doped carbon spheres (NPCSs) with highly porous structure and good bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Specifically, NPCSs exhibited a comparable half-wave potential (0.83 V vs. RHE) to that of commercial Pt/C, but a larger current density, for ORR and was superior to RuO2 (overpotential, 320 mV) for OER with a smaller overpotential of 310 mV. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations revealed firstly that the heteroatom-doping at the edges of the porous structure plays a dominate role in achieving the high bifunctional catalytic activities. Furthermore, the bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis enabled the fabrication of high-performance Zn-air batteries in aqueous and solid-state electrolytes, exhibiting large energy density, high power density, and good cycling stability.									180	14	0	0	6	0	182			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000467774100060

Here, a neoteric chimeric air-cathode is proposed, in which ultra-dispersed ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles are partially confined by microtube walls of free-standing carbon textiles, but petty parts of Ru with catalytic surfaces are exposed. The special chimeric structure benefits not only for preventing nanocatalysts agglomeration but also tailoring the formation/decomposition mechanisms of lithium peroxide (Li2O2) during oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. Critically, theoretical simulations disclose that the enlarged chimeric catalyst-support interphase between the Ru and carbon matrix enhances the electron density of Ru particles and then induces a gradient Gibbs free energy of LiO2 adsorption energy at active sites, and thus fundamentally modulates the morphology evolution mechanism of finial Li2O2. In the LOBs, the chimeric electrode affords a remarkably high energy efficiency of 84.1% and long-term cyclability (260 cycles at 300 mA g(-1)).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000663171900001

In this paper, solid-phase exfoliation and electrostatic self-assembly strategies are developed to couple ultrathin NiFe-layered-double-hydroxide nanosheets and carbon nanotubes (CNT@NiFe-LDH NS) as an OER catalyst. Then, NiFe nanoparticles anchored on the N-doped CNT (CNT-N-NiFe) for electrocatalyst of CO2RR is synthesized via pyrolysis of a mixture of CNT@NiFe-LDH NS and melamine in a nitrogen atmosphere at 750 degrees C, utilizing the ultrathin NiFe-LDH NS as a metal source and CNT as the framework. CNT@NiFe-LDH NS nanohybrid exhibits a better catalytic activity for OER (with an overpotential of 270 mV at the current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and remarkably stable durability) than Bulk NiFe-LDH in 1 m KOH. Moreover, the CNT-N-NiFe catalyst exhibits a Faradaic efficiency of approximate to 82.6% for the reduction of CO2 to CO at -0.7 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) with a current density of CO 10.2 mA cm(-2).

This technology lies on high-performance bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the fuel cell mode and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the electrolyzer mode. Current catalysts are platinum group metals (PGM) such as Pt and Ir, which are expensive and scarce. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop PGM-free catalysts for large-scale application of RFCs. In this mini review, we discussed the most promising nanocarbon/oxide composite catalysts for ORR/OER bifunctional catalysis in alkaline media, which is mainly based on our recent progress. Starting with the effectiveness of selected oxides and nanocarbons in terms of their activity and stability, we outlined synthetic methods and the resulting structures and morphologies of catalysts to provide a correlation between synthesis, structure, and property. A special emphasis is put on understanding of the possible synergistic effect between oxide and nanocarbon for enhanced performance. Finally, a few nano composite catalysts are discussed as typical examples to elucidate the rules of designing highly active and durable bifunctional catalysts for RFC applications.

Here, cobalt sulfide nanocrystalline supported on the 3D hierarchically flower-like porous nanocarbon (mC-CoSx-50) electrocatalysts have been synthesized through a combination of metal-organic complexation and porous silica templates for efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysis. With the high specific surface area, high nitrogen content and heteroatom doping, the as-synthesized mC-CoSx-50 exhibits an excellent bifunctional oxygen catalytic performance. Remarkably, the rechargeable Zn-air batteries assembled with the cobalt sulfide-based hierarchically porous electrocatalysts reveal a high peak power density and excellent cycling stability in comparison with Pt/C+RuO2 owing to the synergistic effects between cobalt sulfide nanocrystallines and hierarchically porous carbon. We envision that this work not only offers high-performance metal sulfide for future clean energy conversion but also provides a facial strategy for constructing hierarchically porous carbon-supported catalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000772221400001

All the defect configurations resulting from substitutional doping and their complexes were found to be energetically favorable. Also, the various dopant atoms resulted in low lattice distortion on the IrO2 surface, with changes in the bond lengths. All the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediate species (O, OH and OOH) were found to adsorb favorable on the various considered surface configurations. Considering the changes in bond lengths of the OH and OOH intermediate species, we found that the OOH adsorbate species disintegrated on the Os-Ir and W-Ir + F-O configurations in the IrO2 surface slab to O and OH species. This implies that those configurations are unsuitable for the OER reaction. We found that the presence of the Mo, Os and W dopant atoms resulted in higher over-potential (eta(OER)) compared with the pristine IrO2. The electrochemical-step symmetry index (ESSI) versus eta(OER) showed that the Mn-Ir + S-o, Fe-Ir + F-o, Cr-Ir + S-o and S-o dopant configurations resulted in the most improved OER activity. Thus, the consideration of the bond dissociation and free energies, the eta(OER), and ESSI versus the eta(OER) provides significant insight towards assessing catalytic materials for the OER.

Herein, the nanophase-separated ultrafine PtCoW alloy and the Ir nanocrystals covalently coupled with carbon were prepared by using a strawberry-like Ir/C hybrid as a structure-oriented template. The resultant Pt-based ternary alloy and the IrO2-covered metallic Ir feature a well-defined nanophase-separated structure with double active sites for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In acidic environments, the bifunctional catalysts exhibit a total overpotential difference of 585 mV, showing much higher activity and stability compared with commercial Pt/C and IrO2. The outstanding bifunctional performance can be attributed to the strong particle-to-particle interaction between PtCoW and the neighboring Ir in their composite. Density functional theory calculations further confirm that the formed IrO2(100)parallel to Ir(111) epitaxial structure can lower the binding energy of reaction intermediates, thus improving OER kinetics. Moreover, the downshifted d-band center of Pt and the compressive strain in PtCoW alloy should be responsible for the remarkably enhanced ORR activity. Therefore, this work may contribute to URFC systems used as safe and efficient energy storage and conversion devices for space flights, vehicles, and stations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000734164500002

Here, we report on a facile and scalable approach to fabricate highly efficient three-dimensional (3D) bulk catalysts of core-shell nanostructures, in which few-layer NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets are grown on Cu nanowire cores supported on Cu foams, toward overall water splitting. Remarkably, benefiting from the 3D hierarchical nanoarchitecture with large surface areas, fast electron transport, and open-channels for effective gas release, the resulting 3D self-standing catalysts exhibit outstanding OER activity as well as excellent HER performance in an alkaline medium. Using them as bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was achieved at a voltage of 1.54 V, and 100 mA cm(-2) at 1.69 V with excellent durability, which is much better than the benchmark of IrO2(+)//Pt(-) electrodes. Our 3D core-shell electrocatalysts significantly advance the research towards large-scale practical water electrolysis.									758	29	0	0	32	0	763			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000407211200013

Owing to the unique geometric and electronic structures, the exposed TM-Mo-Mo triangle can serve as an active site, and the surrounding oxygen atoms can break the scaling relationships between the CORR intermediatesviathe steric hindrance. The synergistic effects result in an excellent catalytic performance for CORRs. Based on the extensive investigation of series of candidates, W-decorated MXene was identified as the most promising CORR electrocatalyst, with a high selective activity towards the CH(4)production and strong suppression of competing hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs). The adsorption free energy of *COH [Delta G(ads)(*COH)] is proposed as a descriptor to establish a relationship with the catalytic activity. Our rational design principles and rapid screening methods may shed light on the development of other highly efficient CORR electrocatalysts, as well as the other electrochemical systems.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000556582600031	32697243

Nanocomposites of MnO2 and Ni(OH)(2) were directly grown on a carbon paper (CP) electrode using hydrothermal synthesis. The MnO2 nanowires (nw) appeared to be wrapped by the Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets in the MnO2-Ni(OH)(2) composites. The MnO2-Ni(OH)(2) composite electrode exhibited better OER performance than the nwMnO(2)@CP or nsNi(OF)(2) @CP electrodes. In particular, in a 1.0 M KOH alkaline electrolyte, the 1.0 nwMnO(2) 1.0 nsNi(OH)(2)@CP electrode showed the highest OER performance with a cell potential of 1.64 V and Tafel slope of 68 mV dec(-1) at a 10 mA cm(-2) of current density (eta = 0.41 V). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of nwMnO(2)-nsNi(OH)(2) @CP before and after the OER revealed the formation of more oxygen vacancies, which served as OH-adsorption sites, leading to higher OER activity. The stability of the 1.0 nwMnO(2)-1.0 nsNi (OH)(2) @CP electrode was demonstrated through 300 h-OER long-term tests, which yielded a high Faradaic efficiency of 96.2%. The lattice oxygen transfer plays a significant role in enhancing the intrinsic activity of catalysts during OER.

Herein, a partial sulfurization/phosphorization strategy is proposed to synthesize a nonstoichiometric pyrrhotite-type cobalt monophosphosulfide material (Co0.9S0.58P0.42) with a hexagonal close-packed phase for electrocatalytic water splitting. By regulating the degree of sulfurization, the P/S atomic ratio in the cobalt monophosphosulfide can be tuned to activate the Co3+/Co2+ couples. The synergy between the nonstoichiometric nature and the tunable P/S ratio results in the strengthened Co3+/Co2+ couples and tunable electronic structure and thus efficiently promotes the oxygen/hydrogen evolution reaction (OER/HER) processes toward overall water splitting. Especially for OER, the Co0.9S0.58P0.42 material, featured with a uniform yolk-shell spherical morphology, shows a low overpotential of 266 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) with a low Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1) as well as high stability, which is comparable to that of the reported promising OER electrocatalysts. Coupled with the high HER activity of Co0.9S0.58P0.42, the overall water splitting is demonstrated with a low eta(10) at 1.59 V and good stability. This study shows that phase engineering and composition control can be the elegant strategy to realize the Co3+/Co2+ couple activation and electronic structure tuning to promote the electrocatalytic process. The proposed strategy and approaches allow the rational design and synthesis of transition metal monophosphosulfides toward advanced electrochemical applications.									238	16	0	0	9	0	237			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000416878100046	29077385

Often, these materials when used for nonenzymatic electrochemical glucose sensing tend to be interfering with oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in overestimation of the glucose. Herein, to address this, NiFe-based LDH were selected because of their ability to vary the metal ratios. The synthesized LDH have been characterized using various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Among the LDH synthesized, Ni4Fe-LDH have been able to differentiate the glucose oxidation potential and the onset potential of OER with minimum interference. The Ni4Fe-LDH sensor shows a sensitivity of 20.43 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) in the linear range of 0-4 mM concentrations. To further enhance the sensitivity, composites of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been synthesized in situ, and the Ni4Fe/rGOs composites have shown an increased sensitivity of 176.8 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) attributed to the charge-transfer interactions. To understand the experimental observations, detailed computational studies have been carried out to study the effect of the electronic structure on the metal ratios of the LDH and its role in differentiating glucose sensing and the oxygen evolution reaction. Along with this, theoretical calculations are also carried out on LDH-graphene composites to study the charge-transfer interactions.									31	0	0	0	2	0	31			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000512216900105	31916748

To overcome the number and location limitations of defects in the electrocatalyst induced by conventional transition-metal atom (e.g. Fe, Co, and Ni) surface doping, we report a facile strategy of substitution with lower electronegative vanadium in the cobalt carbide, leading to larger amounts of defects in the whole lattice. The self-supported and quantitatively substituted VxCo3-xC (0 <= x <= 0.80) was one-step synthesized in the electrospun carbon nanofibers (CNFs) through the solid-state reaction. Particularly, the V0.28Co2.72C/CNFS exhibit superior hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activity and deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.47 V as the alkaline electrolyzer, which is lower than the values for the Pt/C-Ir/C couple (1.60 V). The operando Raman spectra and density functional theory calculations show that the enhanced electron transfer from V to the orbit of the Co atom makes Co a local negative charge center and leads to a significant increase in efficiency for overall water splitting.									23	5	0	0	3	0	23			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000499740300040	31646856

Herein, we rationally manipulate the electronic states of the strongly electron correlated pyrochlore ruthenate Y2Ru2O7 alternative through partial A-site substitution of Sr2+ for Y3+, efficiently improving its intrinsic OER activity. The optimized Y1.7Sr0.3Ru2O7 candidate observes a highly intrinsic mass activity of 1018 A g(Ru)(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV with excellent durability in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Combining synchrotron-radiation X-ray spectroscopic investigations with theoretical simulations, we reveal that the electron correlations in the Ru 4d band are weakened through coordinatively geometric regulation and charge redistribution by the exotic Sr2+ cation, enabling the delocalization of Ru 4d electrons via an insulator-to-metal transition. The induced Ru-O covalency promotion and band alignment rearrangement decreases the charge transfer energy to accelerate interfacial charge transfer kinetics. Meanwhile, the chemical affinity of oxygen intermediates is also rationalized to weaken the metal-oxygen binding strength, thus lowering the energy barrier of the overall reaction. This work offers fresh insights into designing advanced solid-state electrocatalysts and underlines the versatility of electronic structure manipulation in tuning catalytic activity.									19	1	0	0	0	0	20			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000656994100054	33939408

Herein, we report the first example of using a simple but efficient hydrothermal route to synthesize and self-stabilize ultrathin 0D PdIr NCs (2.4 nm) into a new class of freestanding 2D porous PdIr nanosheets with lateral size up to 1.5 mu m (PdIr PNSs). Distinguished from previously reported 2D noble-metal nanosheets, the resultant 2D PdIr PNSs with immense surface area-to-volume ratio and high density of exposed atoms largely retain the special natures of 0D PdIr building blocks and further optimize their catalytic activity and stability at 2D manner. Electrochemical studies show that 2D PdIr PNSs deliver both excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities with an HER overpotential of 40 mV and an OER overpotential of 285 mV affording 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming those of 0D PdIr building blocks.

Herein, using hydrogenated TiO2 (h-TiO2) nanosheets with enriched oxygen vacancies as the support, two-dimensional CoO/hTiO2 Z-scheme heterostructures are fabricated for hydrogen production through photocatalytic water splitting. It is revealed that the oxygen vacancies in h-TiO2 can inhibit the oxidation of Co2+ into high-valence Co3+ during the hydrothermal reaction and thermal treatment processes. A CoO/h-TiO2 Z-scheme heterostructure possesses a space charge region and a built-in electric field at the interface, and oxygen vacancies in h-TiO2 can provide more reactive sites, which synergistically improve the separation and transportation of photogenerated carriers. As a result, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate achieves 129.75 mu molmiddoth-1 (with 50 mg of photocatalysts) on the optimized CoO/h-TiO2 heterostructures.

Despite continuous efforts, the development of OER/HER electrocatalysts with high activity at low cost remains a big challenge. Herein, a composite material consisting of TC@WO3@g-C3N4@Ni-NiO complex matrix as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the OER and HER is described. Though the catalyst has modest activity for HER, it exhibits high OER activity thereby making it a better nonprecious electrocatalyst for both OER and HER and is further improved by g-C3N4. The catalytic activity arises from the synergetic effects between WO3, Ni-NiO, and g-C3N4. A Ni-NiO alloy and WO3 nanoparticles decorated on the g-C3N4 surface supported toray carbon (TC) matrix (TC@WO3@g-C3N4@Ni-NiO) by a facile route that show an excellent and durable bifunctional catalytic activity for OER and HER in the alkaline medium are developed. This carbon nitride with binary metal/metal-oxide matrix supported with TC exhibit an overpotential of 0.385 and 0.535 V versus RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (Tafel slopes of 0.057 and 0.246 V dec(-1) for OER and HER, respectively), in 0.1 m NaOH.

Herein, we reported a facile one-step annealing strategy for fabricating hybrid electrocatalyst with RuCo alloy nanoparticles encapsulated by N-doped graphite loading on N-doped graphite nanosheets (RuCo@NG/N-GNs), which manifests highly desirable electrocatalytic features toward both acidic OER and alkaline HER with impressively high activity, fast kinetic and excellent stability. The optimized RuCo@NG/N-GNs requires a quite low overpotential of 209 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for acidic OER with a quite low Tafel slope of 56 mV dec-1, and demands a striking low overpotentials of 9 mV at 10 mA cm-2 toward alkaline HER with a Tafel slope of as low as 30 mV dec- 1. Experiments combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the critical role of Co element in enhancing the HER and OER performance. For HER, the surface Co improves the oxophilicity of catalyst that indirectly aids the proton donation in alkaline; and for OER, surface Co itself acts as active sites to directly aid the reaction. The relatively low-cost electrocatalyst in this work is expected to inspire more innovative researches to step forward the large-scale commercial practice feasibility of PEM and alkaline water splitting.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000672571500004

This provides an effective strategy for developing highly active platinum-based catalytic electrodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000812991400001

However, ceria has poor intrinsic catalytic performance and usually requires modifications. In this study, N-doped graphite was used as a substrate, and then CeO2-CoOx was attached to N-doped graphite. Afterward, the effects of the recombination with N-doped graphite and those of Co doping on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic ability of CeO2 were studied. The experimental results showed that the electrocatalytic performance of CeO2-CoOx/N-rGO is higher than that of pure CeO2 and CeO2/N-rGO. After the N-doped graphite recombination, the number of transferred electrons increased at high potential, which fully illustrates that graphite can effectively reduce the overpotential of ORR. The 0.56 eV shift of the C1s in CeO2-CoOx/N-rGO to high binding energy revealed that CeO2-CoOx and N-rGO were combined with each other through covalent bonds. In addition, the increased pyridine nitrogen of N-rGO after the recombination improved the electrocatalytic performance of CeO2-CoOx/N-rGO. Overall, the catalytic ability of CeO2 was greatly improved, and the modified CeO2-CoOx/N-rGO composite showed better catalytic performance for the ORR and OER compared with Pt/C and RuO2.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2053-1591		WOS:000635526600001

A Ni0.9Co0.1Fe2O4 mixed oxide, which is synthesized using a polyol mediated synthesis route, is combined with nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) known as electrically conducting material with high activity for the ORR. The combined bifunctional catalyst was investigated towards its structural properties using TEM, XRD, XPS and Raman spectroscopy and studied with relevant electrochemical characterization techniques, namely rotating disk electrode measurements for ORR and linear sweep voltammetry for OER as well as with scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). The difference between onset potentials for OER and for ORR was similar to that of other published bifunctional catalysts, indicating that the simple synthetic approach yields materials well suited for bifunctional catalysis applications. For ORR investigations the redox competition mode of SECM indicated high selectivity of the materials towards 4-electron reduction of oxygen to water. The mixed material showed an enhanced activity for both reactions in comparison to the untreated and pristine materials. An additional heat treatment of the bifunctional catalyst led to a material with elemental Ni, Co and Fe exhibiting a decreased activity for both reactions.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000387886500011		
J	Reinsberg, Philip Heinrich; Koellisch, Andreas; Baltruschat, Helmut								On the importance of ion pair formation and the effect of water in potassium-oxygen batteries								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				313				223	234		10.1016/j.electacta.2019.05.014				AUG 1 2019	2019	Oxygen reduction in the presence of potassium ions has been identified as a promising candidate for the cathode reaction in aprotic metal-air batteries due to its inherent reversibility. Here, we explore the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction in a dimethyl sulfoxide-based electrolyte using rotating ring-disk electrode measurements as well as differential electrochemical mass spectrometry. Thorough kinetic analysis reveals that the oxygen reduction in presence of K(+ )behaves like an ideal model system and that the usual relationships for reversible reactions are applicable. From the comparison of different electrode materials it has been concluded that the electrode material has an influence on the kinetics of the reduction of oxygen to superoxide, which challenges the picture of a simple outer-sphere mechanism. In fact, the reduction of oxygen to superoxide is most facile at glassy carbon electrodes, whereas it is significantly lower at gold electrodes. Rate constants are reported for gold, platinum and glassy carbon. Adding potassium perchlorate to an inert, tetrabutylammonium-containing electrolyte showed a significant stabilization of the superoxide via a shift of the half-wave potentials of the reduction to more positive potentials. This stabilization of superoxide by potassium as compared to tetrabutylammonium shows that the current interpretation of the cation's effect via Pearson's acid-base (HSAB) concept has to be used with great caution. From a detailed analysis of the effect of K+, the equilibrium constant of ion-pairing between superoxide and K+ has been determined as 725 L mol(-l). Using isotopically labelled F11 8 0 it has been shown that the formation of potassium peroxide is alleviated in the presence which is attributed to a further reaction of the peroxide with water. This in contrast to Li+-containing electrolytes, where water has the opposite effect and prevents peroxide formation. Finally, the unexpected consumption of oxygen has been observed during the oxidation of species deposited onto the surface of the electrode, which has been correlated to the amount of CO2 evolution.

In this study, a method was developed to synthesize directly porous Ni2P nanosheet arrays and Ni2P nanoparticles onto nickel foam via a hydrothermal reaction followed by a phosphorization process. Mechanistic studies revealed that the allomorphs of Ni2P nanosheets and Ni2P nanoparticles in the array-like structure were formed via the Kirkendall effect and Ostwald ripening. A fully functional water electrolyzer containing Ni2P as electrodes for the OER and HER exhibited promising activity and stability. At 10 mA center dot cm(-2), a Ni2P cell voltage of 1.63 V was obtained, which was only 0.05 V smaller than that found for Pt/C/NF||RuO2/NF cell. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance resulted from the favorable porosity of the Ni2P arrays and the synergistic effect between Ni2P nanosheets and Ni2P nanoparticles.									58	6	0	0	4	0	60			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000531780700010

Herein, NiCo2Px nanowires (NWs) vertically grown on Ni foam were adopted as the target to explore the in-situ morphology and chemical component reconstitution during the anodic oxidation. The major factors causing the transformation from NiCo2Px into the hierarchical NiCo2Px@CoNi(OOH)(x) NWs are two competing reactions: the dissolution of NiCo2Px NWs and the oxidative re-deposition of dissolved Co2+ and Ni2+ ions, which is based primarily on the anodic bias applied on NiCo2Px NWs. The well balance of above competing reactions, and local pH on the surface of NiCo2Px NW modulated by the anodic oxidation can serve to control the anodic electrodeposition and rearrangement of metal ions on the surface of NiCo2Px NWs, and the immediate conversion into CoNi(OOH)(x). Consequently, the regular hexagonal CoNi(OOH)(x) nanosheets grew around NiCo(2)P(x)NWs. Benefiting from the active catalytic sites on the surface and the sufficient conductivity, the resultant NiCo2Px@CoNi(OOH)(x) arrays also display good OER activity, in terms of the fast kinetics process, the high energy conversion efficiency, especially the excellent durability. The strategy of in-situ structure reconstitution by electrochemical reaction described here offers a reliable and valid way to construct the highly active systems for various electrocatalytic applications.

Here, Ni-Co hydroxide nanosheets (NCHS) are sprouted from Ni-Co foam (NCF) using an eco-friendly, pure-water-based method, and then are phosphorized and nitrided in N-2 + P plasmas. The resulting N-doped Ni-Co phosphide catalyst (N-NiCoPx/NCF) exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance, heralded by the low overpotentials of N-NiCoPx/NCF for generating a current density of 10 and 400 mA cm(-2) (j(10) and j(400)) in 1 M KOH of only 23 and 191 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and 298 and 410 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as well as by the low decay of high current density (j(100)) in the HER (6.02%) and OER (3.07%) processes for 100 h.

Herein, an amorphous cobalt-cobalt oxide/cobalt selenide composite film (CoOx-CoSe) has been fabricated directly on a three-dimensional macro-porous Ni foam (NF) substrate by a facile electrodeposition method, which shows remarkable activity and good long-term stability as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for the OER and HER under alkaline conditions. In 1.0 M KOH, this catalyst as a robust 3D O-2-evolving anode can achieve 100 mA cm(-2) and 500 mA cm(-2) only at overpotentials of 300 mV and 380 mV, respectively. When used as a HER catalyst, similarly, this electrode shows excellent catalytic performance, which needs an overpotential of 90 mV to deliver 10 mA cm (2). This bifunctional electrode can allow an alkaline electrolyzer to obtain a water-splitting current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of around 1.66 V, which offers potential applications in the field of water splitting.									110	6	0	0	4	0	111			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000379473100024

However, the relatively high cell voltage in two-electrode system and the required external electric power hinder its scalable applications, especially in mobile devices. Herein, we report a bifunctional P, W co-doped Co3N nanowire array electrode with remarkable catalytic activity towards both HzOR (-55 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, -41 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). Inspiringly, a record low cell voltage of 28 mV is required to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in two-electrode system. DFT calculations decipher that the doping optimized H* adsorption/desorption and dehydrogenation kinetics could be the underlying mechanism. Importantly, a self-powered H-2 production system by integrating a direct hydrazine fuel cell with a hydrazine splitting electrolyzer can achieve a decent rate of 1.25 mmol h(-1) at room temperature.									110	5	0	0	6	0	109			2041-1723			WOS:000564285200018	32296070

A photoelectrochemical device is proposed to transform wastewater nitrates to ammonia and nitrous oxide, coupled with water oxidation. Numerical models were developed to quantify the dependence of process efficiencies and nitrogen-removal rates on light absorber band gaps, electrocatalytic kinetic parameters, competing oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, and the reacting nitrate species concentrations that affect the mass-transfer limited current densities. With a single light-absorber and state-of-the-art catalysts, optimal solar-to-chemical efficiencies of 7% and 10% and nitrogen-removal rates of 260 and 395 g(N) m(-2) day(-1) are predicted for nitrate reduction to ammonia and nitrous oxide, respectively. The influence of competing reactions on the performance depends on the nitrate concentration and band gap of the light absorber modeled. Oxygen reduction is more dominant than hydrogen evolution to compete with the nitrate reduction reaction, but it is mass-transfer limited. Even with kinetic parameters that enhanced the driving forces for the competing reactions, the performance is only minimally affected by these reactions for optimally selected band gaps and nitrate concentrations larger than 100 mM. Theoretically predicted peak nitrogen removal rates and specific energy intensities are competitive with reported estimates for electrochemical and Sharon-Anammox processes for ammonia recovery and nitrogen removal, respectively. This result, together with the added benefit of harnessing sunlight to produce value-added products, indicates promise in the photoelectrochemical approach as a tertiary pathway to recover nutrients and energy from wastewater nitrates.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2168-0485			WOS:000630171400007

To do this, dissociating gas flows behind the strong shock wave front were calculated with account for these models.

J	Exner, Kai S.								Why the optimum thermodynamic free-energy landscape of the oxygen evolution reaction reveals an asymmetric shape								MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY				21						100831	10.1016/j.mtener.2021.100831		AUG 2021		SEP 2021	2021	The development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts has been spurred by thermodynamic considerations on the free-energy landscape. It is a common paradigm that the optimum thermodynamic free-energy landscape reveals a symmetric shape in that all reaction intermediates are stabilized at the equilibrium potential of the reaction. However, so far, no OER electrocatalyst has been reported that corresponds to the thermodynamic ideal because of the presence of a linear scaling relationship. Therefore, the common approach builds on the breaking of the scaling relations to establish a catalytic material that is close to the symmetric picture, yet, with minor successes. Relating to the simple two-electron hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it was recently reported that the optimum thermodynamic free-energy landscape reveals an asymmetric shape rather than a symmetric form as soon as overpotential and kinetic effects are factored in the analysis. This finding motivates scrutinizing whether the symmetric free-energy landscape as the thermodynamic ideal in the OER is justified. Transferring the knowledge from the HER to the OER results in the introduction of the electrochemical-step asymmetry index (ESAI), representing the concept of the asymmetric thermodynamic free-energy diagram. By comparing the ESAI to the symmetric picture in terms of the electrochemical-step symmetry index (ESSI), it is demonstrated herein that the asymmetric rather than the symmetric free-energy landscape corresponds to the thermodynamic ideal. This outcome suggests changing the mindset when applying the concept of free-energy diagrams for the discovery of OER materials by heuristic material-screening techniques. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Here, an electrochemical reduction etching method has been developed for controllable tailoring of the cationic defects in iron-based oxides under mild conditions. The optimized defective spinel-type iron nickel oxide exhibits an overpotential as low as 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of only 33.8 mV dec(-1) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), outperforming the benchmark RuO2 and pristine oxide. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that Fe vacancies can enhance Ni-O covalency, increase the density of active sites, and optimize the surface electronic structure, which promote the water adsorption/ activation and moderate oxygen intermediate species adsorption, thus significantly enhancing OER activity. This work provides a promising approach to create cation deficiency and mechanistic insight to understand the vacancy-induced enhancement of oxygen electrocatalysis.									38	6	0	0	1	0	39				2096-5745		WOS:000794135600012

In this work, we demonstrate the successful regulation of the electronic structure in layered NaxCoO2 oxides to introduce a nonFermi-liquid (NFL) state by adjusting the Na content and Na occupation in the lattice. The presence of an NFL is facilitated by the weakened electron-electron correlation when the onsite Coulomb repulsion of Co4+ with Na+ and oxygen vacancy with Na+ is balanced. As a feature of NFL, the metallic states in the vicinity of the Fermi energy contribute to a fast electron transfer efficiency and eventually to an improved OER performance. These findings open up a new avenue to design highly efficient OER electrocatalysts in strong electroncorrelated transition metal material systems by consideration of couplings among the fundamental quantum parameters.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1948-7185			WOS:000745933800001	35044184

And then different transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni) were doped on carbon sphere (CS-M-900). The scanning electron microscopes and elemental mappings prove that the transition metal particles are uniformly doped on the carbon sphere. Meanwhile, the X-ray photoelectron spectrum prove that the transition metals are zero-valence. Furthermore, the electrochemical testings showed the CS-Co-900 had more positive onset potential (0.93 V), half-wave potential (0.84 V), and peak potential (0.81 V). Furthermore, the CS-Co-900 had lower charge transfer resistance (44 Omega) and smaller Tafel slope (65 mV/dec). Most importantly, the oxygen reduction reaction on the CS-Co-900 turned out to be a four electron procedure with excellent methanol tolerance. The improved electrochemical properties towards oxygen reduction reactions of carbon sphere via cobalt doping suggested a design strategy towards future high-performance electrochemical devices.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000441363100009

We report a manganese-based thermochemical cycle with a highest operating temperature of 850 degrees C that is completely recyclable and does not involve toxic or corrosive components. The thermochemical cycle utilizes redox reactions of Mn(II)/Mn(III) oxides. The shuttling of Na+ into and out of the manganese oxides in the hydrogen and oxygen evolution steps, respectively, provides the key thermodynamic driving forces and allows for the cycle to be closed at temperatures below 1,000 degrees C.

However, it is hindered by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an efficient and robust OER catalyst through a simple and low-cost method. Herein, we report the in situ fabrication of amorphous Fe-NiSe/NF without a polymeric binder as a three-dimensional (3D) nanowire electrode for efficient water oxidation. It shows good durability in 1 M KOH. This catalyst requires overpotentials of only 233 and 275 mV to drive current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), and it shows a low Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1). The faradaic efficiency of Fe-NiSe/NF for oxygen evolution was determined to be close to 96.8%.									59	5	0	0	2	0	61			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000405689000019

Compared with the original Fe2O3/CoOx sample, the optimized oxygen-defective Fe2O3/CoOx composite film electrode annealed at 250 degrees C has a 120 mV negative shifting of overpotential and lower Tafel slope. Moreover, the optimized oxygen-defective Fe2O3/CoOx composite film electrode exhibits competitive OER stability for 16 h. This can be attributed to numerous active sites on oxygen-defective CoOx and its weak crystallinity that promises excellent activity as well as stability. Furthermore, the amount of oxygen vacancies in CoOx can be finely tuned by changing annealing temperature. Based on XPS spectra and electrochemical analysis results, we show the relationship between the electronic states of Co and its electrocatalytic OER activity. The results may find broad applications in designing highly efficient catalysts for electrochemical process.									23	2	0	0	0	0	23			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000447479500006

Efficient water splitting processes at electrodes are kinetically limited by the improper adsorption strengths between reaction intermediates/products and electrocatalysts. Heteroatom doping could regulate the electronic structures of transition metals, thereby allowing the optimization of adsorption strengths. In this study, we report a class of arrayed molybdenum carbide nanosheets doped with strong electronegative heteroatoms, achieving excellent water splitting performance. Spectroscopic studies, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near-edge structure, verified the N-induced electronic regulation on Mo2C. In alkaline media, the arrayed N-Mo2C/NF nanosheets realize a stable overpotential of 83.9 mV and 220 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively, comparable to the state-of-the-art precious-metal-based electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations show that the doping of strong electronegative nitrogen dramatically reforms the electronic structure of Mo2C and thus optimizes the adsorption free energies of reaction intermediates in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER). This study provides a viable route and inspiration to fabricate highly efficient electrocatalysts with transition-metal based materials.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000695199600001

The as-prepared nickel electrode contained finger-like straight open pores with an average diameter of similar to 100 mu m and smaller pores with an average diameter of 1-3 mu m in the walls. When used as an anode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the porous nickel electrode shows high catalytic activity, reaching a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under an overpotential of only 300 mV in 1.0 M KOH. It also exhibited excellent performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), resulting in a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under an overpotential of 125 mV in the same electrolyte. For both OER and HER, the electrode shows great catalytic stability and much better catalytic performance than commercial nickel foam. Moreover, an alkaline electrolyzer using identical porous nickel electrodes as both the anode and cathode required a cell voltage of only 1.65 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting. The improved electrocatalytic performance of the electrode can be attributed to its unique dual-pore structure.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000405806900015

Here, N-, O-, and S-tridoped carbon-encapsulated Co9S8 (Co9S8@NOSC) nanomaterials are synthesized via simple pyrolysis of S- and Co(II)-containing polypyrrole solid precursors, and the materials are proven to serve as noble metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting in alkaline medium. The nanomaterials exhibit remarkable catalytic performances for oxygen evolution reaction in basic electrolyte, with small overpotentials, high anodic current densities, low Tafel slopes as well as very high (nearly 100%) Faradic efficiencies. Moreover, the materials are found to efficiently electrocatalyze hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic as well as basic solutions, showing high activity in both cases and maintaining good stability in alkaline medium. A two-electrode electrolyzer assembled using the material synthesized at 900 degrees C (Co9S8@NOSC-900) as an electrocatalyst at both electrodes gives current densities of 10 and 20 mA cm(-2) at potentials of 1.60 and 1.74 V, respectively. The excellent electrocatalytic activity exhibited by the materials is proposed to be mainly due to the synergistic effects between the Co9S8 nanoparticles cores and the heteroatom-doped carbon shells in the materials.									291	18	0	0	9	0	295			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000400449200009

Herein, 3D hybrid structures composed of OD FeNi nanoalloys embedded in 1D N-doped bamboo-like CNTs tangled with 2D N-doped carbon nanosheets (FeNi@N-CNT/NCSs) are rationally fabricated through a feasible carbonization strategy. Benefiting from the firmly N-doped carbon-wrapped FeNi nanoalloys as catalytic sites and hierarchically porous nanoarchitecture for efficient mass diffusion and electron transport, the fabricated FeNi@N-CNT/NCSs exhibit high multifunctional electrochemcial activities, comparable to that of noble-metal-based benchmarks, associated with impressive stability. It is indicated that the FeNi alloys evidently determine electrocatalytic activities, and the presence of FeNi alloys obviously improve long-term reaction stability. In addition, the atomic ratio of Fe to Ni in FeNi alloys can significantly affect the electrochemical performance toward oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction. By using FeNi@N-CNT/NCSs as the anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, an outstanding overall water splitting performance is obtained with the low cell potential and good durability in 1.0 KOH. The assembled Zn-air batteries with the FeNi@N-CNT/NCSs air cathode using the liquid-state and all-solid-state electrolyte exhibit the superior charging discharging performance, robust lifetime, and high flexibility, capturing the critical potential in actual implementation of metal air batteries with portable or wearable characteristics. This work will shed advanced inspiration for the fabrication of highly-efficient multifunctional catalysts for various energy technologies.									30	3	0	0	0	0	30			2168-0485			WOS:000507429100028

A Chronoamperometric Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy Study on the Growth of Li2O2 and Its Effect on the Mechanism of Oxygen Reduction in Dimethylsulfoxide Based Electrolytes								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				245				1035	1047		10.1016/j.electacta.2017.05.021				AUG 10 2017	2017	We report on potential step experiments into the oxygen reduction region in combination with differential mass spectroscopy (DEMS) and the rotating ring disc electrode technique (RRDE). We can thus distinguish between the one electron reduction path leading to superoxide and the 2 electron process leading to lithium peroxide. The evolution of the mass spectroscopic response in the DEMS experiments and evolution of the current at the ring electrode discloses that the deposition of lithiumperoxide hampers the capacity of the electrode for the consecutive transition of two electrons. The latter is required to form Li2O2 on a direct electrochemical pathway. Instead, superoxide becomes the main product of oxygen reduction. A proportionality between coverage with Li2O2 and the share of oxygen reduced to superoxide is observed at platinum. The effect of the Li2O2-deposit is less severe at large overpotentials. However, completion of a single monolayer of Li2O2 on platinum and two monolayers on gold inhibit further oxygen reduction. We suggest that growth of larger Li2O2 structures observed by other authors is caused by a chemical rout to Li2O2 via superoxide disproportionation. Experimental evidence for the latter reaction is provided. In addition, we observe a non-monotonic faradaic current transient typical for nucleation after steps to certain potentials at the gold electrode and ascribe this to the formation of 2D Li2O2. This implies that nuclei of Li2O2 have to form before the solid phase can grow uninhibited. Evidently the involved surface energies cause a crystallisation overpotential and therefore impair the formation of solid Li2O2. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Although these metal-free structures show great potential, detailed mechanistic understanding of their performance remains limited. Here, we review important experimental and theoretical findings relevant to the role of metal-free motifs as either photoelectrodes or electrocatalysts. First, the light-harvesting characteristics of metal-free photoelectrodes (band energetics, exciton binding energies, charge carrier mobilities and lifetimes) are discussed and contrasted with those in traditional inorganic semiconductors (such as Si). Second, the mechanistic insights into the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction by metal-free motifs are summarized, including experimental surface-sensitive spectroscopy findings, studies on small molecular models, and computational modeling of these chemical transformations.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0066-426X		978-0-8243-1068-4	WOS:000401335600015	28301760

The Ag was deposited on TiO2 by photoreduction of AgNO3. The resultant Ag/TiO2 was analyzed by TEM, ESCA, and AA. Evolution of methane was observed in the absence of oxygen for thermal reaction at temperature above 623 K. Photoreaction showed the enhancement in CH3I dissociation due to the presence of Ag on TiO2 surface. In this reaction, methyl radicals produced were recombined to form ethane molecules over the Ag/TiO2. The same reactions in the presence of oxygen change their pathways completely yielding oxygen-containing products. In thermal reaction, CO(g), CO2(g), CH2O(g), (CH3)(2)O-(g), and H2O(g) were observed. On the other hand, in the photochemical reactions, CO2(g), H2O(g), and surface formate groups were produced. Possible pathways for present thermal and photochemical reactions are discussed and the results were compared with that obtained using bare TiO2. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we present the cost-effective, convenient, and efficient method for in situ growth of peculiar MoS2-Ni3S2 nanoflake heterostructures on three-dimensional (3D) Ni foam. The synthesized electrocatalyst was used as a self-supported bifunctional electrode to catalyze oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and it exhibits an overpotential of 125 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and an overpotential of 280 mV to achieve 40 mA cm(-2) for OER. In addition, the material presents a cell voltage of only 1.556 V (10 mA cm(-2)) for overall water splitting in 1 M KOH solution and a robust durability and long-term stability (over 50 h at 10 mA cm(-2)). The excellent electrocatalytic performance with superior stability is mainly due to the 3D porous conductive substrates, peculiar layered heterostructures, superhydrophilic surfaces, and synergistic advantages of bimetallic sulfides. The material has a great application prospect as an earth-abundant electrocatalyst in water splitting for large-scale hydrogen or oxygen production.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000520687300005

Herein, Co3O4@NiCo2O4 double-shelled nanocages (Co3O4@NiCo2O4 DSNCs) with hierarchical hollow structure and oxygen vacancies were designed and synthesized via annealing metal-organic frameworks. Co3O4@NiCo2O4 DSNCs with large specific surface area and three-dimensional interconnected mesopores and cavity not only provide more reaction sites, but also offer an efficient transport environment for reactants. Moreover, oxygen vacancies on the surfaces improve the capture of oxygen species to enhance the reactivity of the catalyst. Consequently, Co3O4@NiCo2O4 DSNCs displayed excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, with a positive half-wave potential of 0.81 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) for ORR (approaching the potential of commercial Pt/C catalyst) and a low potential of 1.65 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER (exceeding Pt/C). In a practical demonstration, the Zn-air battery using Co3O4@NiCo2O4 DSNCs as the cathode delivered a satisfactory power density of 102.1 mW cm(-2), comparable to the Zn-air battery with a Pt/C cathode, and exhibited much longer cycling stability.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000618444900016	33481974

However, the underlying mechanism of atomistic doping or heterogeneous interface with foreign atom is still ambiguous. Herein, a case study of NiFe-LDHs that are homogeneously doped with Ce (CeNiFe-LDH) and interfaced with Ce(OH)(3) (Ce@NiFe-LDH), which elucidates their electronic modulation, in situ evolution of active site, and catalytic reaction mechanisms by using X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy, operando electrochemical Raman spectroscopy, and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, is reported. The results indicate that Ce and Fe atoms serve as the electron acceptors and facilitate the coupled oxidation of Ni3+/4+ in NiFe-LDH, and the activated oxyhydroxide phase of the catalysts exhibits superior catalytic activity for water oxidation. Especially, Ce@NiFe-LDH shows a stronger electron transfer between the loaded Ce(OH)(3) and the matrix, which leads to a better catalytic activity than CeNiFe-LDH. DFT calculations provide a clear picture with atomistic resolution for charge redistribution in the NiFe-LDH surface induced by Ce, which eventually leads to the optimal free energy landscape for the enhanced OER catalytic activity.									43	0	0	0	1	0	43			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000669022800001

For this purpose, CoPi and Pt were electrodeposited on the two working electrodes of an IDA, the generator and the collector. The CoPi-catalyzed OER could then be analyzed on the IDA generator and the reaction product, O-2, could be detected immediately by the closely arrayed Pt IDA collector electrode. The CoPi-Pt IDA reveals a clear O-2 evolution process corresponding to the different oxidation states of the catalyst for the OER and provides information regarding the existence of higher cobalt oxidation states. The turnover frequencies are also calculated using the IDA results. In addition, continuous O-2 production and detection was achieved by holding the CoPi generator at a constant higher potential with the Pt collector at a reducing potential measuring O-2 from the generator. The collection efficiency is above 90%, meaning that 90% of the O-2 product is measured in situ by the IDA collector. Other electrocatalytic reactions of interest could be similarly investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively using IDA electrodes operating in the generator-collector mode.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000605594000012

Their electronic, redox, and transport characteristics reveal significant anisotropic characteristics. The specific function of each surface in water oxidation and proton reduction is in direct relationship with the exposed W coordination number. Our study predicts the (210) facet as being the only possible good candidate for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) upon surface modification, whereas the (200) facet is found to be a good candidate only for HER The (121) facet is an acceptable candidate for both OER and HER and the (111) facet for HER only but has less potentials than (210) and (200). The (040) facet is an unsuitable candidate for OER and HER. Interestingly, the proposed (001) facet is predicted to be the best candidate for HER. These results indicate the right direction to be followed for enhanced photocatalytic water splitting reactions based on the rational design of facet-oriented alpha-SnWO4 samples.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000566481000029

This is the first report of the manufacture of this morphology as impressive water splitting electrocatalyst on a graphite rod substrate using a rapid, onestep, and cost-effective electrodeposition technique. Herein, first, a graphite rod was modified with nickel selenide nanoporous by controlling the electrodeposition condition. The main outcomes reveal that the optimized Ni-Se coverage on graphite rod substrate illustrates hopeful HER acing with fewer overpotentials of -100.7, - 281.3, and -552.9 mV at the current densities of - 10, -100, and -400 mA. cm(-2), in order. Besides, the manufactured Ni-Se nanoporous catalyst is extremely energetic into OER, needing just 268 mV overpotentials for 10 mA. cm(-2) current density. This research proposes a cost-effective and fast manner for manufacturing a novel nanoporous electrocatalyst that is a very active electrocatalyst for H-2 and O-2 improvement reactions. These outcomes propose that electrocatalyst is capable to be used for creating renewable-resource energy in industrial usage.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000767855800009

Using economical and recyclable fibre raw materials as carriers, nickel-supported catalysts were prepared by adsorption and reduction at room temperature. The nanoparticles dispersed and anchored on a rational support, efficiently inhibiting their aggregation and thus enhancing the catalytic activity. For the model catalytic hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol by NaBH4, the N-B-NiP/steam-exploded poplar (SEP) and N-B-Ni5Fe5P/SEP catalysts exhibited much better catalytic performances than the other recently reported catalysts in terms of the catalytic activity (the reaction was completed within 10 min for both aforementioned catalysts), reaction rate constant (0.19 and 0.344 min(-1), respectively) and the activity factor K (19 and 34.4 min(-1).g(-1), respectively). The catalysts showed activities for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under ambient conditions. In general, the reported preparation method of nickel-supported catalysts is convenient, economical and environment-friendly, and is agreement with many green chemistry and sustainable development principles; further, it employs widely available starting materials.

To identify the exact catalytic nature of oxide catalysts, a precisely surface-engineered model catalyst, perovskite (LaMnO3), was investigated for oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) in both aqueous and aprotic solutions. By using integrated theoretical and experimental approaches, we explicitly show that H+-ORR/OER catalytic activity on transition-metal sites fails to completely describe the electrochemical performance of LaMnO3 catalysts in aprotic Li-O-2 batteries, whereas the collective redox of the lattice oxygen and transition metal on the catalyst surface during initial Li2O2 formation determines their discharge capacity and charge overpotential. This work applies oxide catalyst design to tailor both the surface lattice oxygen and the transition-metal arrangement for an aprotic Li-O-2 battery. The optimized model catalyst shows good performance for Li-O-2 batteries under both oxygen and ambient air (real air) conditions.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000606833100041

In this work, we have not only successfully synthesized R3C ZnSnO3 nanowires (NWs) through a hydrothermal process, but ZnSnO3 NWs with a high concentration of oxygen vacancies (referred to as ZnSnO3v NWs), exhibiting a highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction compared to unannealed ZnSnO3 and ZnO NWs. The x-ray diffraction pattern and Raman spectra both confirm that the as-synthesized ZnSnO3 NWs mainly belong to the R3C space group with a second phase of ZnSn(OH)(6). The conversion efficiency of the solar-to-hydrogen ZnSnO3v NWs and the unannealed ZnSnO3 NWs is 4.8% and 1.5%, respectively. The enhancement factor of the ZnSnO3v NWs is up to 320%. The photocurrent of the ZnSnO3 NWs and the ZnSnO3v NW photoelectrodes is even 5.39 and 16.23 times higher than that of the ZnO NWs, demonstrating that the high concentration of oxygen vacancies is regarded as a useful approach to enhance the photoelectrochemical response. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to reveal the performance of hydrogen evolution reaction by LiNbO3-type R3C ZnSnO3 NWs, which could offer a promising way of energy harvesting when using ferroelectric materials.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000482552900001	31349236

We describe a solution-phase reaction scheme that leads to the stoichiometric liberation of dihydrogen and dioxygen in consecutive thermal-and light-driven steps mediated by mononuclear, well-defined ruthenium complexes. The initial reaction of water at 25 degrees C with a dearomatized ruthenium (II) [Ru(II)] pincer complex yields a monomeric aromatic Ru(II) hydrido-hydroxo complex that, on further reaction with water at 100 degrees C, releases H-2 and forms a cis dihydroxo complex. Irradiation of this complex in the 320-to-420-nanometer range liberates oxygen and regenerates the starting hydrido-hydroxo Ru(II) complex, probably by elimination of hydrogen peroxide, which rapidly disproportionates. Isotopic labeling experiments with (H2O)-O-17 and (H2O)-O-18 show unequivocally that the process of oxygen-oxygen bond formation is intramolecular, establishing a previously elusive fundamental step toward dioxygen-generating homogeneous catalysis.									407	4	0	0	43	1	409			0036-8075			WOS:000264802100034	19342584

All the catalysts possess a well-defined mesoporous structure with interconnected networks. Oxygen-deficient mesoporous WO3 (m-WO3-x) was prepared by hydrogenation treatment at different temperatures with improved photothermal coupling performance. Moreover, the as-prepared catalysts exhibit selectivity toward CH4 evolution under visible-light only irradiation. Then, under photothermal conditions, the results show that the concentration of oxygen vacancies of m-WO3 has a great influence on its catalytic performance. The CH4 evolution rate reached 25.77 mu mol g (1), which is about 22 times that of mesoporous WO3 (1.17 mu mol g(-1)) under the same conditions, and a moderate concentration of oxygen vacancies is necessary to achieve selectivity for the conversion of CO2 into CH4. A mechanism of the catalytic reduction of CO2 over m-WO3-x is proposed, in which the initial oxygen vacancies function as an excellent electron transfer mediator and decompose CO2 into its elements (C/CO). These findings may further broaden the scope for photothermal chemical conversion and provide new insights into the oxygen nonstoichiometry strategy for the development of CO2 reduction.									110	15	0	0	11	0	115			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000373119500038

Herein scrap stainless steel wires (SSW) from worn-out tires are employed as a support material for catalyst integration in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In addition, SSW by corrosion engineering is exercised as an in situ formed freestanding robust electrode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By superficial corrosion of SSW, inherent active species are unmasked in the form of Ni/FeOOH nanocrystallites displaying efficient water oxidation by reaching 500 mA cm(-2) at low overpotential (eta(500)) of 287 mV in 1 m KOH. Similarly, cathode scrap SSW with active (alloy) coatings of MoNi4 catalyzes the HER at eta(-200) = 77 mV, with a low activation energy (E-a = 16.338 kJ mol(-1)) and high durability of 150 h. Promisingly, when used in industrial conditions, 5 m KOH, 343 K, these electrodes demonstrate abnormal activity by yielding high anodic and cathodic current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) at eta = 233 mV and eta = 161 mV, respectively.

Sometimes, they are used as supports in order to improve electrocatalytic and photocatalytic properties. We show various achievements of solid solutions as good electrocatalysts, and also, good electrocatalysts support materials in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

In many cases, their use as catalysts supports recorded great improvements. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was largely used to confirm the chemical environment of the results obtained, together with X-ray diffraction (XRD). In the electrochemical methods, cyclic voltammograms (CVA), chronoamperometry and rotating disk electrode (RDE), were also carried out. Linear sweep voltametry (LSV) curve was carried out in some cases to measure the current at a working electrode, and tables were shown for clear explanation.

Herein, we construct a Fe-Co-P-Gr catalyst on nickel foam (NF) support through electroless composite plating to realize the co-deposition of Fe-Co-P alloys and graphene quantum dots. Interestingly, graphene quantum dots exhibit obvious effects on electron mobility and active sites of Fe-Co-P-Gr/NF catalyst. In oxygen evolution reaction, the Fe-Co-P-Gr/NF catalyst exhibits a small overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and fast kinetics with Tafel slope of 37.8 mV dec(-1). Meanwhile, the Fe-Co-P-Gr/NF also has a superior hydrogen evolution reaction performance in 1.0 M KOH. Compared with the Fe-Co-P alloys, the Fe-Co-P-Gr/NF both as the anode and cathode require only 1.58 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

Herein, we fabricate an N/P-codoped Fe/Co/Ni-containing graphene-based material by deriving metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The homogeneous dispersion of tri-metallic Fe/Co/Ni in the MOF-derived carbon materials favors the formation of heterojunctions between the resulted different phosphides, which speed up electron transfer and improve the electrocatalytic properties. The graphene support can efficiently protect the phosphides from degradation during the catalytic process. The obtained FeCoNiP@NC catalyst shows low HER overpotential of 93 and 187 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)in 0.5 M H(2)SO(4)and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. In addition, The FeCoNiP@NC exhibits low OER overpotential of 266 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)in 1.0 M KOH solution. The FeCoNiP@NC electrocatalyst can work as bifunctional electrode materials for overall water splitting in alkaline electrolyte with good stability.

In this work, novel hierarchical CoFe-LDH/NiCo2O4/Ni foam (CoFe-LDH/NCO/NF) core-shell nanowire arrays have been fabricated via a facile two-step strategy. The as-obtained nanocomposites were characterized by multiple methods, and their electrocatalytic properties for OER have also been evaluated. The unique structural and component features for the as-prepared 3D nanocomposites facilitate the enhancement of the OER performances. CoFe-LDH/NCO/NF nanocomposites display an excellent OER electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 273 mV at 20 mA cm(-2), as well as an outstanding long-term electrochemical stability with a 90% current preservation during a 32 h test. The remarkable electrocatalytic performances of the CoFe-LDH/NCO/NF electrode ascribe to the strong synergistic effect between the NiCo2O4 (NCO) nanowires core and the CoFe-LDH nanosheets shell at the interface.

In this study, we present a facile approach to prepare villi-shaped Ni-Fe hydroxides incorporated with oxalate derived from Ni-Fe oxalate through the in situ precipitation growth and subsequent immersion in an alkaline solution. The electrode with an optimized Ni-Fe ratio improves the OER kinetics, on which the electronic structure of the active site is adjusted based on a mutual effect between the adjacent nickel and iron atoms. The OER performance was significantly better than that of monometallic Ni(OH)(2) and pristine Ni foam, with a low overpotential of 277 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability. The enhanced OER performance is ascribed to the advanced intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of the electrode as a result of the synergetic effect of optimized Ni-Fe ratio mixing at the atomic level which leads to an increased surface area, a high number of active sites, and a reduced charge transfer resistivity.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000697282300050	34472325

The results showed that the catalytic active sites for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in stoichiometry SnS2 monolayer locate at the (100) edge site, whereas the basal plane and (010) edge are inert for HER. The S-rich (100) and (010) edges are all catalytic active for HER with a large range of hydrogen coverage. Projected density of state analysis revealed that the mechanism for the improvement of catalytic activity is due to formation of density of states near the Fermi energy level by the S(2)and S(3)terminations. This work provides a new design methodology to improve the catalytic activity of catalysts based on transition metal dichalcogenides.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000566069600001

In this work, a series of Ni-based layered double hydroxide (LDH) electrocatalyst models are constructed, and their OER performance is systematically screened via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We discover that the exposed O sites on the pristine NiOOH substrate are more catalytically active than the Ni sites and play a vital role in the OER process. Moreover, introducing a second transition-metal heteroatom dopant is an effective strategy to boost the OER catalytic activity of the NiOOH matrix. Specifically, Ni@NiFe-2 exhibits an extraordinary OER performance with an overpotential of 0.21 V and can compete with or even outperform the current best catalysts such as RuO2 and IrO2. Our theoretical findings pave a new way for exploring high-efficiency OER catalysts and also shed light on NiFe-based LDHs as advanced candidates.									39	3	0	0	0	0	39			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000490983100029

The as-prepared Ru-MoO3-x NF exhibits good performance for HER with low overpotentials of 12 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 49 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 32.96 mV dec(-1), as well as an excellent durability at least lasting 17 h in alkaline media. The Fe3O4-NiFe LDH NF (layered double hydroxide nickel foam) ultrathin nanosheets electrode shows a low OER overpotential of 216 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 42.42 mV dec(-1). Moreover, a two-electrode water splitting device is fabricated with Ru-MoO3-x NF as cathode and Fe3O4-NiFe LDH NF as anode, it only requires 1.46 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits a long term durability without obvious loss of activity after continuously operating for 180 h. The superior catalytic behavior should be originated from the open heterostructure and oxygen vacancies with high intrinsic activity, abundant exposed active sites, and fast charge transfer. This work provides a new strategy to design heterostructure and transition metal oxides catalysts with improved catalytic activity and durability by a facile route for overall water splitting or other applications.

The development of this class of materials mainly relies on screening experiments using a one-pot protocol of mixing metal ions; notably, the incorporation of different metal ions into desired positions in a single polymeric structure is quite difficult. This review article briefly summarizes the synthesis methods for heterometallic coordination polymers that show heterogeneous electrocatalytic activity. In addition, the relationships between the molecular structure and hydrogen evolution (water/proton reduction), oxygen evolution (water oxidation), CO2 reduction, oxygen reduction, and some important organic reactions are reviewed to offer new ideas for designing efficient energy conversion materials and developing new classes of heterometallic coordination polymers.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2052-1553			WOS:000635546900001

Herein, a nanohybrid with Fe-doped CoSe2 nanoparticles embedded in N-doped bamboo-like carbon nanotubes (denoted as FCS@N-CT) is prepared through simple pyrolysis followed by the selenization employing easily available raw materials for the first time. The received FCS@N-CT shows excellent electrocatalytic comprehensive properties for OER in 1M KOH solution, comparable to and even surpassing the fresh RuO2. Specifically, it requires an overpotential of only 330 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mAcm(-2), and achieves higher current density than that of RuO2 with elevating the potential over 1.652 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. More strikingly, FCS@N-CT exhibits a smaller Tafel slope and much better durability than those of RuO2. The remarkable electrocatalytic performance of FCS@N-CT can be ascribed to the unique nanostructure featuring abundant active sites, the favorable conductive network for rapid charge transfer, the synergistic effect between FCS and N-CT, along with the protection of FCS by carbon layers for strong robustness under catalytic conditions.

On the other hand, a direct Z-scheme constructed from a 2D van der Waals heterostructure can not only effectively separate photogenerated carriers, but also can retain robust redox abilities. g-C6N6/InP, a direct Z-scheme heterostructure with a polarized material is successfully designed, which is verified to be available for overall water splitting through first-principles calculations. Due to the synergistic effects of intrinsic electric field and a direct Z-scheme heterostructure, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can simultaneously take place on the g-C6N6 and InP monolayer, respectively. The predicted solar-to-hydrogen efficiency can reach 21.69%, which breaks the conventional theoretical limit of similar to 18%. The suitable direction of intrinsic electronic field in the polar material can enhance the photogenerated carrier migration and redox abilities for both HER and OER. Based on these findings, the g-C6N6/InP vdW heterostructure can provide a new perspective for finding higher-efficiency Z-scheme photocatalysts with polar materials for overall water decomposition.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000780038000001

In this study, one-dimensional mesoporous BiVO4 nanofibers (BiVO4 NFs) were fabricated by the electrospinning strategy. The NFs were then deposited with NiCo layered double hydroxides (NiCo LDHs) to improve their reaction kinetics, charge transfers, and water oxidation activities. The obtained BiVO4/4 wt%NiCo LDHs composite exhibits enhanced photocatalytic oxygen oxidation activity that is approximately 1.6 times higher than that of BiVO4 NFs, due to the synergistic effects between BiVO4 NFs and NiCo LDHs, which can accelerate the transfer of holes between their surfaces. This design is a promising approach for fabricating large-scale nanofibers with good photocatalytic performance.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000472176900032

In this work, we synthesized S,B-(CoFeCr) and S,B-(CoFeV) oxyhydroxides using a facile solution combustion synthesis (SCS) method for Co3O4 production followed by a simple wet chemistry doping strategy in an alkaline environment. Dopants of early transition metals (i.e., Cr and V) and nonmetals (i.e., S and B) were employed to synergistically enhance activity through surface modulation and to improve hydrophilicity toward water oxidation in neutral and near-neutral pH saline electrolyte. We performed an array of characterization techniques including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (pre- and post-OER) to characterize intrinsic properties of the developed catalysts. The as-prepared S,B(CoFeCr)OOH and S,B-(CoFeV)OOH electrocatalysts required low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials of 174 and 242 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with low Tafel slopes of 45.8 and 52.3 mV dec(-1), respectively, in an alkaline saline (1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl) electrolyte.

In this work, nano cubic clusters of Ni and Fe bimetallic phos-phides (NiFeP@NC/NF) grown on NF substrates were synthesized through a simple secondary hydrothermal reaction and low-temperature phosphating. By exploring the phosphating temperature, the optimized NiFeP@NC/NF material shows excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) properties in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. It has a small initial overpotential of 286 and 242 mV and low Tafel slope of 69 and 126 mV dec(-1 )at current density of 20 mA cm(-2), which is attributed to the synergistic effect of NC@ NiFeP nanocubic clusters and NF framework, NiFeP@NC nanocubic clusters not only provide more active specific surface area but also the interlaced structure is more stable. The introduction of miscella-neous elements can accelerate the mass transfer in the reaction. The results show that NiFeP@NC/NF is an excellent dual-function electrocatalyst for water splitting and a promising candidate for electrocatalytic water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000817795100010

Herein, a two-step method was presented to synthesize CoS2/CoP heterostructures grown on carbon cloth (CoS2/CoP/CC).

As promising alternatives of noble metals-based OER electrocatalysts such as IrO2 and RuO2, the OER performance of nanostructured Co-based materials is far from satisfactory. In this report, a coordination-assisted etching strategy is proposed to incorporate iron into cobalt oxide porous nanoplates, producing composite nanostructures with optimized Co:Fe ratio that manifest significantly enhanced OER performance (an overpotential of 304 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) as well as a low Tafel slope of 38 mV/dec). The enhancement can be attributed to the modulated electronic structure of cobalt, favorable absorption energy of OER intermediates, and the formation of more oxygen vacancies. This work highlights the importance of rational integration of iron with cobalt for optimal electrocatalytic performance enabled by the coordination-assisted etching strategy, providing more opportunities for the design and synthesis of mixed metal electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage.

Herein, combined with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of a copper(I) complex and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of cobalt-based oxides, a type of 1D copper-cobalt hybrid oxide nanowires (CuCoO-NWs) is developed via a facile two-step growth-conversion process toward a bifunctional water splitting catalyst. The CuCoO-NWs exhibit excellent catalytic performances for both HER and OER in the same basic electrolyte, with optimized low onset overpotentials and high current densities. The efficient HER activity is ascribed to the formation of Cu2O, while the activity for OER is primarily enabled by Co-based oxides and abundant oxygen vacancies. The CuCoO-NWs allow for the assembly of a water electrolyzer with strong alkaline media, with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.61 V. Further combination with a commercial silicon photovoltaic allows the direct use of solar energy for spontaneous water splitting with excellent stability for over 72 h, suggesting the potential as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient solar-driven water splitting.									202	6	0	0	7	0	203			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000390117800022

Herein, we probe this interface by utilizing surface transition metals (TMs), carbon monoxide, alkali metal cations (AM(+)), and heavy water in combination within situX-ray absorption spectroscopy. It was found that the surface TMs in the metallic phase may boost the HOR kinetics of Pt in alkali by hosting the interfacial water with the oxygen-down orientation that removes the adsorbed hydrogen on Pt neighbors. Furthermore, surface TMs in either metallic or hydroxide phases improve the HER kinetics of Pt by hosting the hydroxyl generated from water dissociation so it can be desorbed by the interfacial water coordinated to AM(+). The roles of interfacial water in shuffling the HOR/HER intermediates throughout the interface are supported by kinetic isotope effects.									40	3	0	0	2	0	40			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000570224500025

However, as the surface structure of perovskites is dynamic during catalysis, the active sites and contributing factors of the LOER are still unclear, which seriously limits the development of efficient perovskite catalysts. Herein, by using a flexible etching method, we design and fabricate highly efficient La/Sr-based perovskite catalysts with surface Fe sites and Sr vacancies for the LOER and establish a relationship between the LOER and dynamic surface structure. Theoretical calculations and advanced in situ characterizations, such as in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and in situ Raman, have demonstrated that surface Fe sites act as catalytic centers for the LOER, while Sr vacancies can promote the LOER by upshifting the oxygen 2p levels. Furthermore, the time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (tof-SIMS) and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) results reveal that the LOER on perovskites is realized by lattice oxygen dynamic changes via the adsorbed (OH)-O-16 transforming to Co-O-18-O-16 in the O-18 isotope labeling experiment. The synthesized La/Sr-based perovskite catalyst shows superior OER catalytic performance, which is higher than that of the RuO2/C catalyst. This work not only proves the key roles of surface Fe doping and Sr dynamic dissolution in achieving an efficient LOER, but also paves the way for design of high-performance perovskite catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000835923500001

A high-intensity oxygen beam was produced by the 5MV pelletron accelerator at the University of Notre Dame impinging on a thick ultra-pure graphite target. Protons and gamma-rays were measured simultaneously in the center-of-mass energy range from 3.64 to 5.01 MeV, using strip silicon and HPGe detectors. Statistical model calculations were employed to interpret the experimental results. A new broad resonance-like structure is observed for the C-12+O-16 reaction, and a decreasing trend of its S-factor towards low energies is found.					16th International Symposium on Capture Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy and Related Topics (CGS)16th International Symposium on Capture Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy and Related Topics (CGS)	SEP 18-22, 2017SEP 18-22, 2017		Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAShanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2100-014X		*****************	WOS:000479286600056

We have developed a nanosheet array of Ni/Co metal-organic framework (MOF) grown on CoO modified Ni foam (CoO/NF) substrate via the solvothermal process. The high surface area and low resistance of Ni/CoMOF@CoO/NF (NC@CoO/NF) catalyst contribute to efficient water splitting. We have prepared a series of NC-n/CoO/NF (n = 1-4) catalysts to optimize the molar ratio of the Co atom in Ni MOF-74. Among them, NC-2@CoO/NF shows an excellent electrochemical performance in alkaline medium, i.e., low overpotential of 290 and 139 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. For a twoelectrode system with NC-2@CoO/NF, a low cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm-2 has been obtained for overall water splitting which is much smaller than that with commercial Ir/C- Pt/C pair. This excellent performance can be attributed to the synergistic effects of Ni/Co-MOF and CoO/NF. In addition, the as-prepared NC-2@CoO/NF exhibits excellent long-term stability. The computational simulation also supports experimental results. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

During the HER, CuVO x is reduced to VO x -Cu 2 O/Cu as the real active species with increased O vacancies. The lamellar NiO shell provides a large number of active sites as well as super-hydrophilic surface, which effectively facilitate the H 2 O adsorption and decomposition to H ads intermediates. It is found that the intrinsic reaction activity for the conversion of H ads to H 2 could be improved by the VO x -Cu 2 O core with rich O vacancy defects. The obtained CuVO x @NiO composite electrode exhibits remarkable HER activity in alkaline solution with an overpotential as low as 74 mV at 10 mAcm -2 , which also shows excellent stability and a fast kinetic reaction with a Tafel slope of 60.8 mVdec -1 . This pioneer work provides a novel catalyst structure and superb properties for the HER in the alkaline electrolyzer. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

These studies have led to an understanding of the many factors that contribute to the poor material characteristics exhibited by these popular high-T-c phases. With knowledge of the structure-reactivity relationships, a powerful crystal engineering approach has been developed that is capable of producing cation substituted versions of YBa2Cu3O7-delta; the resulting compounds therefrom produced exhibit markedly improved processability, oxygen stability, and durability characteristics. These materials have been combined in thin film structures so as to make prototype SNS junctions and SQUID sensors which exhibit promising device performance characteristics.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0884-2914			WOS:A1997YG45700015

The precursors were pyrolyzed in N-2 to form the N-doped carbon coating on carbon-iron materials; this was followed by subsequent phosphorization using NaH2PO2 as a phosphorus source, yielding the hybrid materials of N-doped carbon wrapped Fe2P/FeP hollow spheres. The resulting hybrid materials showed high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas, pore volumes, and nitrogen contents, which were, more than 80 % pyridinic-N. The hybrid materials were evaluated as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH, and they have exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activities in the two reactions. In the case of the optimum sample, the 0.75-NC-FexP catalyst, a low overpotential/Tafel slope of 193 mV/58 mV center dot dec(-1) for HER and 302 mV/42 mV center dot dec(-1) for OER were obtained. More importantly, the catalyst showed high catalytic activity for overall water splitting and only 1.63 V of cell voltage was needed to reach 10 mA/cm(2) in a two-electrode electrolyzer. The catalyst also exhibited robust long-term durability and only a 16.0 % decrease in current density was observed after a 10 h chronoamperometric testing at 1.63 V. The results suggest that the sample is a promising alternative non-precious-metal catalyst for overall water splitting.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2196-0216			WOS:000475512500027

Traditional efforts are mainly based on a single-site doping of heteroatom ions into either B-sites or O-sites of the ABO(3) structures. Here we propose a dual-site doping strategy by simultaneous incorporation of iodine cations and anions into the B-sites and O-sites of ABO(3) perovskite oxides, respectively. Consequently, both activated B-site transition metals with optimal e(g) orbital occupancy and large amount of active oxygen species were achieved for remarkably improved OER activities. Using this approach, significantly improved OER activities are achieved in some representative perovskite oxides, including Ba0.5Sr0.5(Co0.8Fe0.2)(0.9)O3-delta (BSCF), SrCo0.9O3-delta (SCO) and SrNi0.9O3-delta (SNO). Specifically, the iodine dual-site doped BSCF boosts a small overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1), which is about 130 mV and almost half times lower than that of pristine BSCF, respectively. Besides, this general dual-site doping strategy can also realize scale-up synthesis and achieve a gram-scale production. Our findings show a unique doping strategy to design efficient perovskite oxide electrocatalysts beyond the conventional approaches.									4	0	0	0	0	0	3			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000804425300004

The results shows that this reaction takes place by a mechanism similar to that of cobalt metal oxidation in alkaline media. The voltammetric curves evidence a strong enhancement of the oxygen evolution current in the presence of Co(II). This behavior is consistent with cobalt oxide formation at the diamond electrode surface. Based upon these results, a simple, straightforward method for the production of high activity films on BDD electrode surfaces is demonstrated. The study of the electrochemical behavior in 1 M NaOH shows that the electrodes thus obtained exhibit promising, stable electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution, comparing well with those of thermally deposited cobalt electrodes. The use of BDD as a substrate for the electrocatalytic layers allows the deposition of isolated particles or discontinuous films, thus maximizing the utilization of the catalyst by avoiding the need for thick films.

Specially, bivalent cobalt is introduced into a potassium ferricyanide solution containing hydrochloric acid and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. The uniform PBAs with opened cages are formed tardily after hydrothermal reaction. Time-dependent evolution characterization on composition elucidating the RCE mechanism is based on the sequential reduction of ferric iron and cation exchange reaction between divalent iron and cobalt. The PBA structures are confirmed by electron tomography technology, and the heterogeneous element distribution is verified by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental analysis, leading to the formation of core-shell PBAs with compositional heterogeneity (Fe rich shell and Co rich core) and open cage architecture. When the PBA catalysts are used to boost the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), superior OER activity and long-term stability (low overpotential of 271 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and approximate to 5.3% potential increase for 24 h) are achieved, which is attributed to the unique compositional and structural properties as well as high special surface areas (576.2 m(2) g(-1)). The strategies offer insights for developing PBAs with compositional and structural multiplicity, which encourages more practical catalytic applications.									62	2	0	0	7	0	62			2198-3844			WOS:000463153100005	30989025

However, the overall turnover frequencies of MnOx catalysts are still much lower than that of nanostructured IrO2 and RuO2 catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate that doping MnOx polymorphs with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can result in a strong enhancement of catalytic activity for the water oxidation reaction. It is observed that, for the first time, the catalytic activity of MnOx/AuNPs catalysts correlates strongly with the initial valence of the Mn centers. By promoting the formation of Mn3+ species, a small amount of AuNPs (<5%) in -MnO2/AuNP catalysts significantly improved the catalytic activity up to 8.2 times in the photochemical and 6 times in the electrochemical system, compared with the activity of pure -MnO2.									98	3	0	0	15	0	98			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000350100000004	25284796

These are the first Monte Carlo stellar evolution studies that use complete stellar models. Focusing on 3 M-circle dot models evolved from the pre main-sequence to the first thermal pulse, we survey the remnant core mass, composition, and structure properties as a function of 26 STARLIB reaction rates covering hydrogen and helium burning using a Principal Component Analysis and Spearman Rank-Order Correlation. Relative to the arithmetic mean value, we find the width of the 95% confidence interval to be Delta M-1TP approximate to 0.019 M-circle dot for the core mass at the first thermal pulse, Delta t(1)TP approximate to 12.50 Myr for the age, Delta log(T-c K) approximate to 0.013 for the central temperature, Delta log (rho(c)/g cm(-3)) approximate to 0.060 for the central density, Delta Y-e,Y-c approximate to 2.6 x 10(-5) for the central electron fraction, Delta X-c (Ne-22) approximate to 5.8 x 10(-4), Delta X-c (C-12) approximate to 0.392, and Delta X-c (O-16) approximate to 0.392. Uncertainties in the experimental C-12(alpha, gamma) O-16, triple-alpha, and N-14(p, gamma)O-15 reaction rates dominate these variations. We also consider a grid of 1-6 M-circle dot models evolved from the pre main-sequence to the final white dwarf to probe the sensitivity of the initial-final mass relation to experimental uncertainties in the hydrogen and helium reaction rates.									31	0	0	0	0	0	31			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000377216300046

The isolation procedure involves dodecyl maltoside extraction followed by column chromatography using anion exchange resins. The isolated PS2 reaction center (RC) was analyzed for its biochemical and biophysical characteristics. Analysis by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the complex contained five intrinsic membrane proteins (CP 47, CP 43, D1, D2, and cyt b(559)) and at least three low molecular mass proteins. The complex exhibited high rates of oxygen evolution [333 mmol(O-2) kg(-1)(Chl) s(-1)] in the presence of 2.5 mM 2,6-dimethylbenzoquinone (DMBQ) as an artificial electron acceptor. The red chlorophyll a absorption peak of this complex was observed at 673.5 +/- 0.2 nm. The isolated PS2 core complex was free of photosystem 1 as inferred from its SDS-PAGE and fluorescence spectrum.

Here we report combinatorial screening of nearly 3500 trimetallic A(x)B(y)C(z)O(q) mixed metal oxide compositions that led to the discovery of electrocatalysts with enhanced activity relative to, inter alia, the well-studied pure oxides, ABO(3), and AB(2)O(4) stoichiometries of those metals. Using a fluorescence-based parallel screening method, we directly detect electrolytic oxygen-evolution activity of catalyst arrays under alkaline conditions. From these data, composition-activity relationships amongst mixed oxides composed of earth-abundant elements have been determined. Significant sustained activity is observed only in the presence of Co or Ni, and the data draw attention to synergistic interactions between these redox-active ions and Lewis-acidic cations, such as Fe, Al, Ga, and Cr. The best activities are observed with oxides composed of Ni and Fe, together with another element.									183	14	0	0	16	0	185			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000337977600030

Engineering electronic states through decoration of functional entities is an effective way to advance catalyst design. In this work, Au nanocrystal decorated Fe, Co, and Ni based trimetallic metal organic frameworks (MOFs) (termed Au/(FCN)MOFs), grown in-situ on nickel plates (NP), are developed as high performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. At optimal Au nanocrystal decoration, the Au/(FCN)MOF/NP electrode achieves significantly improved OER performances over the (FCN)MOF/NP electrode, lowering eta(10) and eta(500) from 242 and 340 mV to 216 and 290 mV, respectively, Tafel slope from 42.1 to 31.7 mV dec(-1), and current density decay from 6 to 5% after 50 h operations at an initial current density of 160 mA cm(-2). The enhancement is attributed to the significantly elevated oxidation states of Fe, Co, and Ni, induced by decoration of the Au nanocrystals of high electronegativity, as evidenced with high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in-situ Raman spectroscopy studies. Furthermore, the main active metal centers are identified with in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy study to be Ni and Co, with Fe playing a supporting role to help Ni acquire high valence states to realize enhanced OER activities.									18	1	0	0	1	0	19			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000621625800006

Various multicomponent systems have been investigated so far for the OER, although a systematic investigation is lacking and there are discrepancies as to which formulations make the best catalyst. Here, we perform a systematic investigation of a ternary Ni-Fe-Co oxide gradient library for the OER, using a combinatorial approach. This approach allows a much faster investigation of a vast compositional space compared to the traditional step by step approach. Also, it enables a more reliable comparison of the various catalysts as they all experience the same process and measurement conditions. We used the spray pyrolysis technique in combinatorial electrocatalyst screening for the first time for the generation of a gradient library of Ni-Fe-Co oxides. Combinatorial electrochemical screening using a scanning droplet cell (SDC) set up allowed the study of 94 different points in the compositional space of the trimetallic Ni-Fe-Co oxide library, which was used to deduce a composition-activity relationship. At 10 mA cm(-2), the investigated points spanned an overpotential window of 294-320 mV, with the best performing ternary oxides being confined to a compositional space of 4-15% Fe, 4-15% Co, and 80-90% Ni. This study provides a foundation for broad exploration of other mixed-metal oxide combinations.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000812947900001

The direct fuel cell, especially, is believed to be the quintessential replacement for conventional sources of energy because of its high energy conversion capacity. Electrochemical water splitting has an important role in such sustainable energy technologies. Catalysts play a worthwhile role in water splitting, especially the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Engineering fine micro/nanostructures with subtle morphologies represents an effective strategy to enhance the activity of the resultant catalyst toward OER through exposing abundant electrochemically active sites. So, here we report a Co3O4@SUS catalyst, the well-defined Co3O4 microrods were successfully anchored onto the stainless steel mesh substrate with the assistance of diethylenetriamine using microwave irradiation, utilizing a commercially available microwave instrument. Co3O4@SUS possesses outstanding catalytic activity toward water oxidation. In water oxidation, the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was achieved at 298 mV overpotential with a low Tafel slope of 105 mV dec(-1). In addition to low overpotential, Co3O4@SUS was stable under conditions of continuous O-2 evolution for an extended period (24 h). The results show a highly efficient, scalable, and low-cost method for developing highly active and stable OER electrocatalysts in alkaline solution.									29	1	0	0	5	0	29			2168-0485			WOS:000414825900167

Transition metal nitrides (TMNs) have the advantages of low cost, high electrical conductivity, corrosion resistance, and bifunctional ORR (oxygen reduction reaction)/OER (oxygen evolution reaction) catalytic activity, which are highly desired properties for the rechargeable ZAB. The application of TMNs as electrocatalysts for rechargeable ZAB will be reviewed in this paper. Special emphasis will be put on the regulation of TMNs, which can be realized at atomic, micro, and electronic levels. The regulation of the electrical conductivity, intrinsic catalytic activity, and reaction surface area can enhance the efficiency of rechargeable ZAB. The relationship of the regulation and the promoted performance of rechargeable ZAB will be highlighted. By summarizing recent progress of nanostructured transition metal nitrides for the rechargeable ZAB, this review will give an understanding of the TMN-based electrocatalytic mechanism, promote the development of the advanced electrocatalysts, and inspire the design of highly stable and efficient ZAB.									46	2	0	0	0	0	46				2639-4979		WOS:000588743300006

The powders were analyzed by SEM (scanning electron microscopy), XRD (X-ray diffraction) and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). The electrochemical properties of the MnxCr1-xO1.5 electrodes for the OER (oxygen evolution reaction) in alkaline solution were evaluated by LSV (linear sweep voltammetry), staircase voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The results indicated that the mixed oxides were solid solutions of Mn2O3 (bixbyite) and Cr2O3 (eskolaite), and when x = 0.2, the catalyst had better catalytic activity in the OER process than did that of single Mn2O3 and Cr2O3. At the high potential region (1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl), the current density of the Mn0.2Cr0.8O1.5 electrode was similar to 80 times higher than that of Mn2O3 and similar to 9 times higher than Cr2O3, and its overpotential (eta= 3673 mV at a current density of 1.0 mA.cm(-2)) was considerably lower than that of single Mn2O3 (eta = 996.5 mV) and Cr2O3 (eta = 648.5 mV) catalysts and was comparable to the precious metal oxide IrOx The stability testing indicated that the mixed oxides had good stabilities in strong alkaline solution during the OER process.

From a theoretical point of view, studies reported in the literature so far are mostly based on density functional theory using periodic slab models for the bulk and surface of beta-NiOOH, one of the active NiOx phases. However, cluster models are a valid method to investigate many aspects about structure, charge carrier transport properties, and OER activity of beta-NiOOH. Hence, here we present new cluster models for the surface of beta-NiOOH, where the oxygen atoms are bonded to Mg effective core potentials (ECPs) mimicking neighboring atom cores. This cluster embedding procedure is superior to saturating the cluster with hydrogen atoms, and to using other atomic ECPs for beta-NiOOH. We find that layered materials such as beta-NiOOH are more vulnerable to geometrical rupture and therefore a cluster approach requires additional care in choosing the embedding approach. We evaluated the models by using them to calculate the energy required for water adsorption and deprotonation, which are essential ingredients for OER. Specifically, our results agree with previous slab models that the first deprotonation reaction step requires a large amount of energy. In addition, we find that water and hydroxyl groups have high adsorption energy and therefore the first deprotonation step is limiting the reaction efficiency.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1996-1944			WOS:000404411000032	28772839

The recent observations and understandings for the interfacial state, adsorbed intermediate products, and rate-determining steps (RDS) on CoOx, however, have remained elusive because of the dynamic transformation of different Co ions and the transient nature of the intermediates formed during the OER process. In this work, we propose that under the chosen experimental conditions, the redox process between Co(III) and Co(IV) species does not follow a proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism that is thought to be common prior to the OER, but it involves a proton-decoupled electron transfer, clarified by isotope labeling experiments and in situ electrostatic modulation. The interfacial state of CoOx is negatively charged prior to the formation of Co(IV)=O species. The theoretical concentration of the resulting Co(IV)=O species is approximately 0.1229 X 10(19) cm(-2). The Co(IV)=O species are demonstrated to directly regulate the OER performance. Moreover, we experimentally monitor the dynamic evolution behaviors of Co(IV)=O, Co(O)O-, OOH*, and O-2(-)* intermediates during the OER with in situ time-resolved infrared spectroscopy, and the following elementary step OOH* + OH- -> OO-* + H2O is likely to be the unexpected RDS in the OER process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000813297100001

Recent studies have shown that a group of transition metal sulfide catalysts can completely or partially restructure during electrochemical reactions which then exhibit high activity even better than the best commercial standards. However, such restructuring processes and the final structures of the new catalysts are elusive, mainly due to the difficulty from the reaction-induced changes that cannot be captured by ex situ characterizations. To establish the true structure-property relationship in these in situ generated catalysts, we use multimodel operando characterizations including Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray reflectivity to investigate the restructuring of a representative catalyst, Co9S8, that shows better activity compared to the commercial standard RuO2 during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a key half reaction in water-splitting for hydrogen generation. We find that Co9S8 ultimately converts to oxide cluster (CoOx) containing six oxygen coordinated Co octahedra as the basic unit which is the true catalytic center to promote high OER activity. The density functional theory calculations verify the in situ generated CoOx consisting of edge-sharing CoO6 octahedral clusters as the actual active sites. Our results also provide insights to design other transition-metalbased materials as efficient electrocatalysts that experience a similar restructuring in OER.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2691-3704		WOS:000746270600001	34977893

However, research on heteroatom doped electrocatalysts with abundant defects and well-defined morphology remain a great challenge. Herein, a class of defect-engineered nitrogen-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles/nitrogen-doped carbon framework (N-Co3O4@NC) strongly coupled porous nanocubes, made using a zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 via a controllable N-doping strategy, is demonstrated for achieving remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption fine structure, and electron spin resonance results clearly reveal the formation of a considerable amount of nitrogen dopants and oxygen vacancies in N-Co3O4@NC. The defect engineering of N-Co3O4@NC makes it exhibit an overpotential of only 266 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 54.9 mV dec(-1) and superior catalytic stability for OER, which is comparable to that of commercial RuO2. Density functional theory calculations indicate N-doping could promote catalytic activity via improving electronic conductivity, accelerating reaction kinetics, and optimizing the adsorption energy for intermediates of OER. Interestingly, N-Co3O4@NC also shows a superior oxygen reduction reaction activity, making it a bifunctional electrocatalyst for zinc-air batteries. The zinc-air battery with the N-Co3O4@NC cathode demonstrates superior efficiency and durability, showing the feasibility of N-Co3O4/NC in electrochemical energy devices.									202	19	0	0	21	0	205			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000482137900008

Redox mediators are typically used to convert ionic mixing into electricity at electrodes placed adjacent to a stack of membranes. However, replacing redox mediators with water splitting electrodes can enable the sustainable production of fuels (H-2) and/or oxygen (O-2). We aim to examine if a RED oxygen generation system could meet oxygen requirements for scuba diving. Evolving oxygen from water would enable the development of artificial gills, allowing for an inexhaustible supply of oxygen thus displacing the need to carry oxygen tanks. We show here that the oxygen evolution activation overpotentials are a significant fraction of internal resistance (77%) in a RED system with a small number of cell pairs (N = 5). However, this resistance is nearly negligible (3.2%) as the number of cell pairs increases (N = 500). We further compare the RED systems to four different battery-electrolysis systems (Li-ion, Ni-MH, Ni-Cd, and lead acid) to contextualize the performance of the RED oxygen generation system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000817734700001

Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of MOF-derived ultrafine Co9S8 nanocrystals (similar to 6 nm) embedded in nitrogen-and sulfur- co-doped multilayer-assembled carbon nanoplates (Co9S8/NSCP) for highly efficient oxygen electrocatalysis through polymer self-assembly, metal-organic coordination, and subsequent space-confined pyrolysis. The resultant Co9S8/NSCP shows excellent catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with high half-wave potential (0.9 V) and low overpotential (370 mV), separately. The extremely low reversible oxygen overpotential of 0.7 V is achieved in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, much better than those of single-component counterparts (Co9S8 or carbon), comparable or even superior to those of noble metal catalysts and recently reported advanced catalysts. The superior performance of Co9S8/NSCP can be attributed to the synergistic effect of highly exposed Co9S8 nanocrystals and heteroatom-enriched 3D carbon superstructure, enabling large surface area, protective graphitic layers, and abundant active sites towards fast catalytic kinetics and excellent durability. This work will open the door towards the rational construction of 3D carbon-based nanocrystals for a wide range of applications beyond catalysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000777600700001

Thus, to overcome this unfavourable kinetics, an efficient catalyst is required to expedite the process. In this context, we report on Ni foam functionalised with low cost iron (Fe) and iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)(X)), wet chemically synthesized as OER catalysts. The prepared catalyst based on iron hydroxide precipitate shows a promising performance, exhibiting an overpotential of 270 mV (at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)in 1 M KOH solution), an efficient Tafel slope of similar to 50 mV dec(-1)and stable chronopotentiometry. The promising performance of the anode was further reproduced in the overall water splitting reaction with a two electrode cell. The overall reaction requires a lower potential of 1.508 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2), corresponding to 81.5% electrical to fuel efficiency.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000552843400003	35518625

In general, the in situ electrochemical transformations of non-oxide catalysts are faster than those of the corresponding oxides, and they typically display improved OER activity. Although many approaches for tuning the active surfaces of catalysts as well as investigations into their roles in the mechanism of adsorption of OER intermediates have been reported, we still have a poor understanding of the dominant active sites formed during the OER. This review highlights current progress into the in situ electrochemical tuning with non-oxide catalysts (especially chalcogenides and pnictides) and offers a comprehensive summary of approaches for the enhancement of OER activity. We describe the non-oxide catalysts that have exhibited promising OER performance with strong in situ electrochemical tuning. We also discuss the preoxidation peak positions of the catalysts in alkaline electrolytes. Furthermore, we explore the probability of new active surface formation on non-oxide catalysts with modified OER mechanisms and the collections of available in situ and ex situ methods to identify the active sites in real-time. Finally, we discuss the challenges affecting the future detection of the active sites of the most promising OER catalysts.									124	6	0	0	5	0	126			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100053

Co-MoO2-NC-900 which was obtained by pyrolysis at 900 degrees C displays a low overpotential (370 mV) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and a half-wave potential (E-1/2 approximate to 0.89 V) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), exhibiting bifunctional features. A Zn-air battery with Co-MoO2-NC-900 shows a high power density of 176.5 mW cm(-2) at 217.1 mA cm(-2), which is better than that of reference Pt/C + Ir/C electrocatalysts, and is capable of exhibiting a smaller discharge-charge overpotential (0.85 V) and excellent stability (1145 h). Density functional theory calculations and experiments reveal that the structure and electron transfer between the Co and MoO2 components reduce the free energy of the intermediates, resulting in bifunctional electrocatalytic activity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000680464000001

The LaNiO3 particles synthesised by citrate-based sol gel method have sizes between 30 and 70 nm with an active specific surface area of 1.26 +/- 0.05 m(2) g(-1). LaNiO3 shows high catalytic activity toward HPRR in 0.1 M KOH solution with an exchange current density based on the active surface area (j(OA)) of (7.4 +/- 1) x 10(-6) A cm(-2) which is noticeably higher than the j(OA) of N-doped graphene. The analysis of kinetic parameters suggests that the direct reduction of H2O2, H2O2 decomposition, O-2 reduction and O-2 desorption occur through HPRR on this catalyst. In order to control and minimize oxygen evolution from the electrode surface, the effects of catalyst loading, bulk concentration of H2O2, and using a mixture of LaNiO3 and N-doped graphene are studied. Although the mechanism of HPRR is independent of the aforementioned operating conditions, gas evolution decreases by increasing the catalyst loading, decreasing the bulk concentration of H2O2, and addition of N-doped graphene to LaNiO3.

However, they suffer a large overpotential during oxygen evolution process and thus catalysts play a vital role in the reaction. Here, we systematically explored the influence of Pt-based nanoparticle catalysts on the discharge product Li2O2. Because of the superior electrical conductivity and the strong binding with oxygen, Pt-based nanoparticles serve as active sites which are favorable for the growth of toroidal Li2O2. We also found that the content and composition of Pt-based nanoparticle catalysts exert a significant influence on the electrochemical performance of lithium oxygen batteries. The discharge products are composed of crystalline Li2O2 and oxygen-rich LiO2 characterized by high-energy X-ray diffraction and Raman. Atomic force microscopy further provides detailed information of the particle size and surface roughness. The loading of Pt catalysts determines the phase and size of Li2O2 on the discharged electrode surface. This study will be beneficial for the optimization of Pt-based catalysts used in non-aqueous lithium oxygen batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The synergetic effects of high conductivity of carbon supports and abundant catalytic active sites in TMs make these hybrids promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. However, strategies for modulating the catalytic active species in the above hybrids are limited despite being highly sought after. Furthermore, the exact roles of chemical species in the hybrids (e.g., N, C, or TM) mainly responsible for this high OER performance remain unknown. Herein, an innovative approach based on atomic layer deposition is developed to tune the true active species in Co nanoparticle/N-doped carbon nanotube (Co/N-CNT) hybrids. Specifically, the configuration predominantly promoting water oxidation in an alkaline medium is identified as pyridinic N-Co-C. Furthermore, a physicochemical intact interface between metallic Co nanoparticles and conductive N-CNTs is demonstrated to induce synergetic effects for accelerating charge transfer and enhancing electrocatalytic activity as well as stability in the hybrid catalysts. The optimized hybrid catalyst is revealed to exhibit outstanding alkaline OER activity and stability, outperforming RuO2, a benchmark novel OER electrocatalyst.									38	3	0	0	1	0	39			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000541472000001	32567162

The catalysts were identified by XRD, XPS, DRS measurements, and the photocatalytic activity of WO3 for O2 evolution was studied. The results indicate that with the increasing content of Ar, the oxygen vacancies of WO3 catalysts are increased, the photocatalytic activity for O2 evolution is advanced and the photocatalytic activity of WO3 obtained in pure Ar is the highest. The influence of Fe^2＋ on photocatalytic activity for O2 evolution was also investigated.

Transition metal-based compounds, especially the NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) have been well-established as the most effective and cost-efficient electrocatalysts to boost the sluggish water oxidation and improve the energy efficiency. Nevertheless, a favorable substrate is highly required to expose the poorly conductive active phases and enhance reactivities of OER. In this review, the recent advances concerning synthetic strategies, hierarchical structures, and OER performances of NiFe LDH/nanocarbon hybrid electrocatalysts are summarized. A brief description of OER catalysis, LDHs, and nanocarbon materials is presented firstly, followed by a thorough overview of various investigations according to their synthetic methods and structural characters. The development of high-performance OER catalysts is covered by both a short summary and a presentation of future prospects. This review provides stimulatory knowledge and sheds fresh light into the development of advanced functional materials with a wise hybridization of active phases and conductive substrates.									96	18	0	0	2	0	96			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000382859400003

A top-down approach composed of a solid state reaction and an ion exchange reaction is introduced to fabricate Ti doped BiVO4 nanosheets. Ti doped BiVO4 nanosheets exhibit a thickness of 3 nm with a lateral dimension as large as 2 mu m. The optimal photocatalytic performance is achieved for BiV0.98Ti0.02O4 with an O-2 evolution rate of 102.8 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under visible light, which is 6 times and 23 times higher than those of undoped nanosheets and bulk sample, respectively. The enhancement is attributed to the short diffusion length of the photogenerated carriers in the nanosheets, the effective suppression of direct radiative recombination and the increasing concentration of oxygen vacancies induced by the Ti dopant.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000714415100001

Here, we are presenting nitrogen doped exfoliated graphite foil (NGF) as the 3D support which offers electronically coupled interface to catalytic heterostructure comprises of nickel-iron based oxide and its borate. As developed hybrid (NGF/NiFe/Borate) show excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline condition with low overpotential of 281 mV at current density of 10 mA cm-2 and Tafel slope 62 mv dec- 1. The results beat most nonprecious metal catalysts and noble commercial IrO2 deposited over same NGF substrate with outstanding long-term durability over 10 h at high current density 300 mA cm-2. Efficient electron injection from NGF support and its low resistance leads to enhancement in current density by more than 136 % at operative potential of 1.55 V, in comparison to un-doped exfoliated graphite foil support. Beside electronically tuned support, high catalytic efficiency is also linked with planner growth of borate nanosheets that helps in fast interfacial charge transfer in its transverse direction to the catalytic site. Our work highlights the importance of electronic tuning of catalyst support to enhance the performance of supported borate catalyst and to rationally design low cost, highly active OER catalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000648657100003

Carbon-based catalysts by far form the largest group of non-PGM oxygen electrocatalysts. The performance of carbon catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) can be improved by using a salt-activated synthesis. This method, however, is not applied to improve the catalytic performance of carbon in the OER. In view of the very different reaction micro-environments for the ORR and OER, the carbon active sites for the ORR and OER are expected to be mutually exclusive. Is it then possible to switch between the ORR and OER properties of carbon-based catalysts by using salts with different chemical labilities in a salt-activated synthesis? This communication is a report of our investigation of the effects of lithium salts on the microstructure and performance of doped carbon catalysts in oxygen electrocatalysis in acid.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000395797000016

Presently Li-O-2 batteries suffer from parasitic reactions owing to impurities, found in almost all non-aqueous electrolytes. Impurities include residual protons and protic compounds that can react with oxygen species, such as the superoxide (O-2(-)), a reactive, one-electron reduction product of oxygen. To avoid the parasitic reactions, it is crucial to have a fundamental understanding of the conditions under which reactive oxygen species are generated in non-aqueous electrolytes. Herein we report an insitu spectroscopic study of oxygen reduction on gold in a dimethyl sulfoxide electrolyte containing phenol as a proton source. It is shown directly that O-2(-), not HO2, is the first stable intermediate during the oxygen reduction process to hydrogen peroxide. The unusual stability of O-2(-) is explained using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.									52	2	0	0	2	0	52			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000357209000023	26013064

Here we investigate Ni0.5Fe0.5 clusters as a well-defined model highly active electrocatalyst system for the OER. The electrodes were prepared using gas-phase deposition of mixed Ni0.5Fe0.5 metallic clusters produced by cluster beam deposition (CBD), a technique offering precise control of composition and loading. Highly dispersed Ni0.5Fe0.5 clusters were deposited at 1 equivalent monolayer and used as OER catalyst in 1M KOH. The low loading allows assessment of the intrinsic catalytic activity and their extensive structural characterization by XAFS and XPS spectroscopies. Ni0.5Fe0.5 clusters demonstrate high stability as there is no apparent potential increase after a 12 h constant current density anodization test. After electrochemical aging, the lowest overpotential was achieved and amounts to 372 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The Tafel slope reaches 37 mV dec(-1). The measured electrochemical activity is also compared with other systems. After OER reaction in KOH the cluster surface is enriched in NiOOH, while concomitant Fe depletion from the catalyst surface is observed. These findings help to shed light on the formed active phase at the nanoscale.					12th International Symposium on the Scientific Bases for the Preparation of Heterogeneous Catalysts (PREPA)12th International Symposium on the Scientific Bases for the Preparation of Heterogeneous Catalysts (PREPA)	JUL 08-12, 2018JUL 08-12, 2018		Univ Catholique Louvain, Louvain la Neuve, BELGIUMUniv Catholique Louvain, Louvain la Neuve, BELGIUM	13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000472188100008

Giovagnetti, Vasco/0000-0002-3298-4310			Discerning the effects of photoinhibition and photoprotection on the rate of oxygen evolution in Arabidopsis leaves								JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY				152		SI		272	278		10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.09.010				NOV 2015	2015	Higher plants possess a set of interconnected processes to regulate light harvesting. Non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll a fluorescence (NPQ) is the fastest process activated to protect the photosystem (PS) II from the absorption of excess light energy. However, damage of PSII reaction centers (RCIls) is often inevitable, a phenomenon known as photoinhibition. Both NPQand photoinhibition undermine PSII quantum yield (Phi(PSII)). Recently, we devised a fluorescence-based methodology that uses the coefficient of photochemical quenching measured in the dark following illumination (qPd) to assess the intactness of RCIls. This procedure enables to express Phi(PSII) as a function (f) of NPQand qPd, Phi(PSII) = f(NPQqPd), thus allowing to efficiently discern between the effects of protective NPQ and photoinhibition upon the efficiency of electron transport. In this study, we addressed the relationship between qPd and Phi(PSII) measured by photosynthetic oxygen evolution in intact leaves of Arabidopsis. We found a linear correlation between qPd and Phi(PSII) of oxygen evolution (as well as Fv/Fm). This relates to the fact that qPd reflects the onset of photoinhibition. These results further demonstrate the validity of the qPd parameter and underlying theory in quantitatively assessing PSII efficiency solely by using this effective and simple fluorescence technique.

Herein, we report on CNTs@ultrathin FeOOH nanoflake core/shell networks on a carbon cloth (CNTs@FeOOH/CC) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). With the assistance of a layer of ZnO formed via atomic layer deposition (ALD), ultrathin FeOOH nanoflakes are uniformly grown on CNTs. The CNT cores serve as highly conductive channels to facilitate the transfer of electrons, which effectively enhances the electrical conductivity of FeOOH. Furthermore, the interwoven network structure increases the mass loading and utilization of FeOOH. As a result, the CNTs@FeOOH/CC catalyst exhibits a high OER performance, with features such as a low onset overpotential, large anodic current density, small Tafel slope and excellent long-term electrolysis durability, which are highly desirable for a promising OER electrocatalyst.									52	2	0	0	2	0	52				2052-1537		WOS:000412446400012

The microstructure of the solid solution interlayers and PbO2 coatings was characterized by scanning electronic microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The results indicated that the above oxides interlayer exited in the form of solid solution and the interlayer covered the Ti substrate largely. Accelerated life test proved that the presence of solid solution interlayer can increase the stability of PbO2 electrodes in electrolysis. Cyclic voltammogram indicated that the PbO2 electrode with the solid solution interlayer have more active surface area in sulfuric acid solution. Linear scanning voltammograms showed that the over potentials of the oxygen evolution are decreased with the addition of the solid solution interlayer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the presence of interlayer can increase the electrochemical activity of oxygen evolution reaction and electrical conductivity.									35	6	0	0	6	0	40			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000305804800027

In this work, we report a facile approach to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-based perovskite by introducing the deficiency in the A-site and transition-metal Fe in the B-site. Bifunctional electrocatalysts La0.8Sr0.2MnO3, (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.8)MnO3, (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.98)MnO3 and (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)MnO3 Feo(0.5)O(3) were prepared by a facile sol-gel process. The material characterization results showed that compared with La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.98)MnO3 and (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)MnO3 have smaller particle size, more oxygen vacancies and proper Mn valence, which will benefit both ORR and OER. The results were verified by testing the electrocatalytic activities using rotating-disk electrode (RDE) in alkaline media. For the perovskite oxides with only A-site cation deficiency, the bifunctional electrocatalytic activities increase in the following order: La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 < (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.98)MnO3 < (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)MnO3. With partial substitution of Mn by Fe in the Bsite, the (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)Mn-0.5 Feo(0.5)O(3) perovskite oxide exhibits even better electrocatalytic activity. Further experiments reveal that (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)Mn(0.5)Feo(0.5)O(3) has the highest current density (4.5 mA cm(-2)) in ORR which is comparable to commercial Pt/C (5 mA cm(-2)) and the enhancement of the OER is more obvious than that of the ORR. Subsequently, the perovskite samples were used as the cathode catalysts in zinc-air batteries. The results further prove that proper use of A-site deficiency and B-site Fe doping in perovskite oxides can boost up the electrocatalytic activities.									30	0	0	0	1	0	30			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000497966300109

Ionic liquid, namely N,N-bis(4-(methoxycarbonyl)benzyl)-N-methyl-d-glucaminium hexaflorophosphate (MBMG-PF6), was infiltrated into the pretreated graphene as the precursor to prepare N,P-double doped graphene (G((PF6))). This material has been applied as a metal-free electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), demonstrating a good catalytic activity with an onset overpotential of 100mV, a Tafel slope of 88mV dec(-1), a 97% Faradaic efficiency (FE) and a good durability over 10h. According to the structural and compositional studies, this good HER performance can be attributed to the N,P-dopant and highly porous structure of this catalyst.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2365-6549			WOS:000436798700015

Here, we construct a pyridinic-N-dominated doped graphene with abundant vacancy defects. The optimized sample with an ultrahigh pore volume (3.43 cm(3) g(-1)) exhibits unprecedented ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.85 V in alkaline. For the first time, density functional theory results indicate that the quadri-pyridinic N-doped carbon site synergized with a vacancy defect is the active site, which presents the lowest overpotential of 0.28 V for ORR and 0.28 V for OER. The primary Zn-air batteries display a maximum power density of 115.2 mW cm(-2) and an energy density as high as 872.3 Wh kg(-1). The rechargeable Zn-air batteries illustrate a low discharge-charge overpotential and high stability (>78 h). This work provides new insight into the correlation between the N configuration synergized with a vacancy defect in electrocatalysis.									345	24	0	0	17	0	346			2380-8195			WOS:000432478200021

A cost-effective self-supported stable electrocatalyst with excellent electrocatalytic performance in a wide pH range is greatly required for water splitting. This work reports on the synthesis and anchoring of Fe1CoxNiyP nanoparticles on vertically aligned reduced graphene oxide array (VrGO) via electroless plating. The catalytic activity of Fe1CoxNiyP nanoparticles is tuned finely by tailoring the cationic ratio of Co and Ni. Fe1Co2Ni1P/VrGO exhibits the lowest overpotential (109 and 139 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) and lowest tafel slope (133 and 31 mV dec(-1)) for hydrogen evolution reaction in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. Fe1Co1Ni2P/VrGO exhibits the lowest overpotential (342 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) with lowest tafel slope (60 mV dec(-1)) for oxygen evolution reaction. The enhanced performance of the electrocatalyst is attributed to improved electrical conductivity, synergistic effects, and beneficial electronic states caused by the appropriate atomic ratio of Co and Ni in the bifunctional electrocatalyst. This study helps to explore the effect of variable cationic ratio in the cost-effective ternary iron group metal phosphides electrocatalysts to achieve enhanced electrocatalytic performance for water splitting in a wide pH range.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2381-6872	2381-6910		WOS:000778139700001

Herein, we modify the surface of SUS304 by selenization under mild conditions. The optimal selenization temperature (500 degrees C) is determined by analyzing the surface morphology and elemental distribution. The electrode composition and the role of Se in improving OER activity are clarified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling. The electrode selenized at 500 degrees C is rich in oxygen vacancies and had a high Ni content after electrochemical pre-activation. Moreover, the overpotential is only 284.3 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and no potential degradation occurred over 160 h, indicating excellent stability under alkaline conditions. Further, high stability is achieved during CO2 reduction in a real water matrix. These results provide new insights for modifying commercial stainless-steel electrodes to maximize OER activity for alkaline water splitting and neutral CO2 electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000742842100004

Such a nanocage-like NiS2/NiSe2 heterostructure can expose more active sites, accelerate the mass transport of the ions/gas, and optimize the interfacial electronic structure, which shows a significantly lower overpotential of 290 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) than those of NiS/NiS2 and NiSe2 as counterparts. The experimental characterizations and theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil that the interfacial electron transfer from NiSe2 to NiS2 at the heterointerface can modulate the electronic structure of NiS2/NiSe2, which further cooperates synergistically to change the Gibbs free energy of oxygen-containing intermediates as the rate-determining step (RDS) from 2.16 eV (NiSe2) and 2.10 eV (NiS2) to 1.86 eV (NiS2/NiSe2 heterostructures) during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. And as a result, tetrahedral NiS2/NiSe2 heterocages with dual-phase synergy efficiently trigger the OER process, and accelerate the OER kinetics. This work provides insights into the roles of the interfacial electron transfer in electrocatalysis, and can be an admirable strategy to modulate the electronic structure for developing highly active electrocatalysts.									92	4	0	0	3	0	93			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000500834400001	31808621

In this study, Ni2P/NiFeP owning rich interfaces was fabricated within the Ni(OH)2 nanosheet arrays to form hetero-structured Ni2P/NiFeP catalysts via the Kirkendall effect. The as-prepared catalysts exhibited only 250 mV overpotential towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at + 50 mA cm-2 in alkaline electrolytes, and delivered a current density of + 10 mA cm-2 at 1.57 V in a complete and fully functional water electrolyser using the Ni2P/NiFeP and Ni2P/ Ni2P catalysts on the anode and cathode side, respectively. The evolution and reconstruction of the interface in Ni2P/NiFeP during the electrochemical stability test experiments was also studied. It was found that reducing the interface resulted in a decrease in electrocatalytic performance and a transition in crystal structure to amorphous state was observed. The method developed in this investigation has been found to be useful for developing catalysts of rich interfaces, in turns paving the way for integrating novel highly active and stable electrocatalysts in electrochemical water splitting technologies.

In this article, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that using TiC MXene TinCn-1O2 (n = 2, 3, 4) as the cathode of lithium-air batteries (LABs) can potentially improve its efficiency by increasing the cathode conductivity and lowering the charging overpotential. In addition, the conservative predicted storage density is as high as approximate to 0.5 kWh kg(-1). Compared with the bulk TiC{111}, the favorable structural agreement between the TiC MXenes and Li2O2 and better interfacial conduction help Li2O2 continuously grow on the TiC MXene; and the higher specific surface area (SSA) makes more Li2O2 deposition possible. The predicted reaction path calculations reveal that TiC MXenes have the charging overpotential of 0.13 V because they are excellent catalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Thus, the lower charging overpotential can extremely suppress the side reactions and accelerate the OER rate. All the evidence supports that TiC MXene is a potential high energy density cathode for LABs.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20				2513-0390		WOS:000451893100005

High-throughput methods for measuring fundamental electrochemical properties are demonstrated through the investigation of oxygen-evolution catalysis by using 665 oxide compositions containing nickel, iron, cobalt, and cerium. The behavior of each composition is characterized in 1.0 M NaOH(aq) by using a scanning drop three-electrode cell to perform chronopotentiometry (CP) and cyclic voltammetry experiments. CP measurements at different current densities identify different composition-performance trends, owing to underlying variations in fundamental electrochemical behavior. We report systematic, coincident, composition- dependent trends in the Tafel slopes and the reversible redox potentials of the catalysts. Applying high-throughput electrochemical methods provides insight into composition-property- performance relationships and motivates new directions for the study of catalyst mechanisms by using informatics and theory.									61	2	0	0	4	0	62			2196-0216			WOS:000338295800004

Sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within the electrolytic cell and high energy demand to form O=O bonds have attracted more responsiveness to this area. We report the OER beneficial mixed oxide composite of molybdenum and iridium oxides by a facile hydrothermal method. Adhered IrO2 nanoparticles on MoO3 large particles synergistically possessed a robust nature toward harsh acidic water electrolysis as compared to an alkaline environment. Mass specific OER activity of iridium active centers was greatly enhanced by 7-fold, twice the current density, and was attributed to electronic modulation of noble metal. Enhanced surface area and the existence of highly oxidative species in the O(1s) spectrum of IrO2 and two doublet regions in the X-ray photoelectron spectrum of molybdenum metal were found, accountable for the robust performance. Prepared composite possessing only 30% molar fraction of noble metal presented an excellent long-term stability for 40 000 s. Reduction in the Tafel slope from 57 to 77 mV dec(-1) for IM-30 and IrO2 respectively was observed. The conducted research will open up new avenues for more applications of molybdenum oxides and their derivatives for water splitting.									77	2	0	0	1	0	77			2168-0485			WOS:000429285800047

A typical air electrode fabricated using conductive carbon and a polymeric binder suffers rapid degradation during charging, stemming from oxygen bubbles erosion and carbon corrosion. This work presents a durable air electrode having a self-supported sulfur-doped manganese oxides (MnOx-S) electrocatalyst prepared through hydrothermal process followed by ambient temperature sulfurization. Upon sulfurization, MnO2 nanoflakes are transformed into MnOx-S having a heterostructure of Mn3O4, MnO2 and MnSx. MnOx-S provided superior electrochemical properties for both oxygen reduction reaction (Tafel slope of 68 mV/dec) and oxygen evolution reaction (Tafel slope of 80 mV/dec). Self-supported electrodes using MnOx-S and MnO2 electrocatalysts were scrutinized in a bi-electrode rechargeable ZAB having a stagnant electrolyte. In the ZAB using the self-supported MnOx-S electrode, both significant discharge peak power density (74 mW/cm(2) at 135 mA/cm(2)) as well as low voltage difference between charge and discharge processes (0.75 V) were observed. In addition, for charge-discharge cycling at 20 mA/cm(2), the ZAB using the self-supported MnOx-S electrode achieved stable cycling through 2000 cycles without apparent degradation. The air electrode having the self-supported MnOx-S paves the way for a more durable and higher performance favoring practical application for rechargeable ZABs. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Herein, we crafted three-dimensional (3D) network comprising nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon-coated heterojunctions (denoted NC-Ni0.36Fe0.64/MnOx) via one-step calcination of hybrid precursors containing ternary Prussian blue analogues and polymers. The NC-Ni0.36Fe0.64/MnOx nanocomposites were then exploited as catalysts for OER, displaying exceptional performance with a small overpotential of 300 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 43 mV/dec and an outstanding stability without deactivation over a 10-h OER. Notably, compared to commercial RuO2 catalysts, NCeNi0.36Fe0.64/MnOx catalysts demonstrated much lower overpotential and Tafel slope. The excellent OER performance can be attributed to the presence of high-valence oxidized metal species (Ni2+, Fe2+ and Mn2+) at the hetero-structured interface as well as pyridinic N-doped carbon species on highly conductive graphitic carbon network, thus greatly facilitating the electron-withdrawing from OH- and thus charge transfer during OER. This simple yet effective strategy may open new possibilities for creating a wide range of low-cost, high-efficiency, non-precious transition metal OER catalysts for the overall water splitting.

Stable non-, O-, F-, OH-terminated Ti2C MXenes are constructed to show the real state of Ti2C MXene monolayer in the experiment. Then, the interfacial models of LixO2 (x = 4, 2, and 1) molecules adsorbed on Ti2C, Ti2CO2, Ti2CF2, and Ti2C(OH)(2) MXenes were used to simulate the structural evolution during discharging (oxygen reduction reaction, ORR) and charging (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) processes. The catalytic activity was quantitatively assessed by calculating the ORR and OER overpotentials. Among them, Ti2CO2 MXene displays the best catalytic activity with the lowest ORR/OER/TOT overpotential, suggesting that O-terminated Ti2C MXene is more favorable for Li-O-2 batteries. This is because the Ti 3d orbital of the Ti2CO2 surface is completely polarized near the Fermi level, showing strong oxidation capability toward O-2(2-). These findings give a theoretical guidance for Ti2C MXene used in Li-O-2 batteries and widen the applications of MXene-based materials.									34	1	0	0	0	0	34			1932-7447			WOS:000476693800047

Among the three explored potential candidates for O-enriched bulk Ta3N5 structures with substituted O at N sites and accompanied by interstitial O or Ta-vacancies, the first and third structures are relevant. The four possible (001), (010), (100) and (110) low Miller index exposed facets of Ta(3-x)N(5-y)Oy (y = 7x) are also explored, which show lower formation energies than those of Ta3N5. This highlights O occupation at N sites together with Ta vacancies as native defects in the prepared samples. The most appropriate facets for HER and OER are predicted based on the redox and transport characteristics. Our work predicts (001) and (110) facets only for HER, whereas the (010) facet is predicted for OER. Our findings indicate the importance of understanding the significance of various facets when preparing and testing new material photocatalysts for water splitting reactions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000535921700036	32356530

Herein, we report a highly active and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst, a three-dimensionally interconnected nanoporous PtIr thin film (np-PtIr) for URFC, which was prepared by an electrochemical selective leaching of a less noble element, Os. The np-PtIr showed a much enhanced URFC performance, such as an about 21% and 485% higher round-trip efficiency than that of sole Pt and Ir, respectively, and much enhanced stability confirmed with the ICP-OES analyses. It was revealed from various electrochemical tests and XPS studies that the enhanced URFC performance of np-PtIr resulted from a significantly increased surface area due to the formation of a three-dimensionally interconnected nanoporous structure, as well as a minimization of the ohmic loss due to an inner metallic conduction paths.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2574-0962			WOS:000516665300022

In order to solve this problem, an efficient P, W-MoS2/NiSP/NF catalyst was rationally designed through heteroatom (P and W) doping and heterostructure construction. Interestingly, motivated by the synergistic incorporation of W and P, the 2H-phase MoS2 with limited edge active sites was partially converted into highly active 1T-phase MoS2 with rich defects, which basically activate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)-inert basal plane of MoS2 and significantly enlarge the number of active sites, ultimately endowing the well-designed P, W-MoS2/NiSP/NF catalyst with Pt-like HER performance and superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Importantly, this work exerts a profound influence on the construction of 1T-MoS2 with defects, the design of multi-stage structures, and the achievement of Pt-like catalytic performance.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000599249300025

Oxygen-deficient WO3-x is shown to possess large capacity for storing protons, which could be transferred to the Ru NPs under cathodic potential.

Herein, Fe doped Ni5P4 nanosheet arrays with rich P vacancies are developed via a facile phase transformation strategy. Based on systematic investigations, we have demonstrated that an optimized surface electronic structure, abundant active sites and improved charge transport capability can be effectively achieved by vacancy engineering. Consequently, Fe doped Ni5P4 with rich vacancies show remarkable catalytic performances with 94.5 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 217.3 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, as well as good durability. When directly employed as working electrodes, the as-obtained Fe doped Ni5P4 with rich vacancies can attain 10 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of 1.59 V.

However, despite numerous reports in this field, the origin of the activity of NiFeP, especially in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is still poorly understood. Here, by selectively etching Zn atoms in the Zn-NiFeP precursor, designed NiFeP electrocatalysts with rich defects anchored on carbon cloth (d-NiFeP/CC) were prepared to boost reaction kinetics. The surface defects are greatly beneficial to surface reconstruction, resulting in the generation of oxyhydroxide species, which become the real catalytic active centers. Defect-activated surface reconstruction is demonstrated by in situ Raman analyses and theoretical calculations. As a result, d-NiFeP/CC has an overpotential of only 185 mV for the OER, driving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and maintaining stability for 100 h. For the hydrogen evolution reaction and OWS, the overpotentials are only 88 mV and 256 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. This study not only reports an effective strategy to promote the OWS activity, but also sheds light on the active origin of transition metal phosphide during the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000869862600001

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is catalyzed by SrRuO3 with low potentials (ca. 1.35 V-RHE), but the catalyst's durability is insufficient. Here we show that Na doping enhances both activity and durability in acid media. DFT reveals that whereas SrRuO3 binds reaction intermediates too strongly, Na doping of similar to 0.125 leads to nearly optimal OER activity. Na doping increases the oxidation state of Ru, thereby displacing positively O p-band and Ru d-band centers, weakening Ru-adsorbate bonds. The enhanced durability of Na-doped perovskites is concomitant with the stabilization of Ru centers with slightly higher oxidation states, higher dissolution potentials, lower surface energy and less distorted RuO6 octahedra. These results illustrate how high OER activity and durability can be simultaneously engineered by chemical doping of perovskites.									123	3	0	0	8	0	123			2041-1723			WOS:000466699900001	31053713

This work presents the synthesis of a three-dimensional core-shell nanostructure with an amorphous and crystalline NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) layer on sulfur-modified nickel molybdate nanorods supported by porous Ni foam (S-NiMoO4@NiFe-LDH/NF) through hydrothermal and electrodeposition. Benefiting from high intrinsic activity, plentiful active sites, and accelerated electron transfer, S-NiMoO4@NiFe-LDH/NIF displays an outstanding bifunctional catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both simulated alkaline seawater and natural seawater electrolytes. To reach a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), this catalyst only requires overpotentials of 273 and 315 mV for OER and 170 and 220 mV for HER in 1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl freshwater and 1 M KOH + seawater electrolytes, respectively. Using S-NiMoO4@NiFe-LDH as both anode and cathode, the electrolyzer shows superb overall seawater-splitting activity, and respectively needs low voltages of 1.68 and 1.73 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in simulated alkaline seawater and alkaline natural seawater electrolytes with good Cl resistance and satisfactory durability. The electrolyzer outperforms the benchmark IrO2 parallel to Pt/C pair and many other reported bifunctional catalysts and exhibits great potential for realistic seawater electrolysis.

Herein, we describe the inexpensive synthesis of electrochemically deposited nickel iron sulphides on nickel foam (NiFeS/NF) and their use as highly efficient bi-functional water splitting catalysts that can meet the current energy demands. The NiFeS/NF electrocatalysts exhibited low overpotentials of approximately 231 mV for the OER and 180 mV for the HER in 1 M KOH. Moreover, the NiFeS/NF electrocatalysts exhibited a turnover frequency of one order of magnitude higher than those of state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts (RuO2 and Pt/C) for the OER and HER. In addition to this excellent activity, the bi-functional catalyst also exhibited an outstanding OER and HER electrode stability for over 200 h with minimal loss in activity. Further, it can be directly used in the practical application of alkaline electrolyte membrane water electrolysis. The high performance, prolonged electrode stability, and facile synthesis as an adherent coating on nickel foam suggest that NiFeS/NF electrocatalysts might be suitable for use as alternative commercially viable catalysts.									138	4	0	0	4	0	140			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000387166900014

Recovery of the metallic values has centered on the use of adsorption and cementation processes, although these represent additional costs. In the present work, gold and silver direct electrodeposition from thiourea solutions is studied in a filter press-type electrochemical reactor, using a stainless steel 316 plate as the cathode. The strong influence that the parasitic reactions (hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction on the cathode) have on the gold and silver electrodeposition process was evaluated. Additionally, through manipulation of the reduction potential and the flow velocity, hydrogen evolution was minimized. This result is of great value, principally in the scale-up of the electrodeposition process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									12	2	0	0	2	1	14			0304-386X			WOS:000311978000014

In this study, we report on the synthesis and catalysis of less studied TMDC nanoflakes (NFs) with a design space comprised of three transition metals (rhenium, ruthenium, and iridium) and three chalcogens (sulfur, selenium, and tellurium) for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) in an aprotic hybrid electrolyte containing 0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonypimide salt in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ionic liquid and dimethyl sulfoxide. Our results indicate that among the tested catalysts, ReS2 exhibits the highest current density for both ORR and OER, beyond those of the state-of-the-art catalysts used in aprotic media with Li salts. We performed density functional calculations to provide a mechanistic understanding of the reactions in the ReS2 NFs/ionic liquid system. These novel bifunctional catalyst results could open a way for exploiting the unique properties of these materials in Li-O-2 batteries as well as other important electrochemical systems.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000526394000006

Adopting different mixing modes, we investigate the impact on the production of Al-26 in explosive oxygen burning and find that the result is extremely sensitive to mixing mechanisms. In some cases, we obtain an encouraging result, for example, the greatest final abundance of Al-26 reaches 7.779 x 10(-6), which means that the explosive oxygen burning may be a new origin of Al-26.									1	3	0	0	0	0	3			0256-307X	1741-3540		WOS:000238406300082

Here we report an integrated CdS nanorod/oxygen-terminated Ti_3C_2T_x MXene nanosheet heterojunction with a high catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. By incorporating one-dimensional (1D) CdS nanorods onto annealed ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) MXene nanosheets, the mixed-dimensional 1D/2D heterojunction achieved a hydrogen-evolving rate of 8.87 mmol*g~(-1)*h~(-1), much higher than that of bulk CdS and CdS/unmodified MXene hybrid catalysts. The enhanced HER activity and stability of the designed heterojunction catalyst are attributed to the presence of oxygen-containing terminal groups on the surface of thermally treated Ti_3C_2T_x MXene, extended light absorption spectra as well as the precisely constructed intimate Schottky contact, implying an accelerated interfacial charge transfer and efficient, long-term photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. The results demonstrate that oxygen-terminated 2D MXene can be well utilized as a functional platform for the development of novel heterojunction photocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-5861			CSCD:7270869

Herein, we report a robust hybrid zinc battery that makes use of transition-metal-based redox reaction (M-O-OH -> M-O, M = Ni and Co) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to deliver more electrochemical energies of comparably higher voltage with much longer cycle life. The hybrid battery was constructed using an integrated electrode of NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays grown on carbon-coated nickel foam, coupled with a zinc plate anode in alkaline electrolyte. Benefitted from the M-O/M-O-OH redox reactions and rich ORR active sites in NiCo2O4, the battery has concurrently exhibited high working voltage (by M-O-OH -> M-O) and high energy density (by ORR). The good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of the electrode and the reversible M-O <-> M-O-OH reactions also enabled smooth recharging of the batteries, leading to excellent cycling stabilities. Impressively, the hybrid batteries maintained highly stable charge-discharge voltage profile under various testing conditions, for example, almost no change was observed over 5000 cycles at a current density of 5 mA cm(-2) after some initial stabilization. With merits of higher working voltage, high energy density, and ultralong cycle life, such hybrid batteries promise high potential for practical applications.									106	6	0	0	6	0	107			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000392036600023	27936783

However, a systematic experiment of comparing the catalytic performance in different crystal structures is rarely reported. Herein, the widely-watched PtCu nanoframes (atomically disordered) are firstly synthesised to in-vestigate their structure-properties relationship. Subsequently, rhombohedral PtCu intermetallics (L11 structured, atomically ordered) which were rarely reported before are fabricated by appropriate high temperature treatment. The L11-PtCu delivers significantly enhanced durability (only 15 % attenuation after 30,000 cycles) while decreased initial activity (0.44 A mgPt-1) for ORR compared with their disordered counterpart. In virtue of in-situ STEM experiment assisted by the state-of-the-art 3D tomography, we reveal that the ordering process improves the resistance against Cu leaching meanwhile results in the collapse and aggregation of the NFs. This work provides a visual understanding of Pt based electrocatalyst in different crystal structures for proton exchange membrane fuel cells in the future.									43	7	0	0	3	0	44			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000591691800003

Herein, Co-2(OH)(3)Cl/FeOOH nanosheets are served as both cathode and anode for the concurrent high purity hydrogen generation and high value-added cyclohexanone productions. Thanks to the wondrous synergistic effect between Co-2(OH)(3)Cl and FeOOH, for Co-2(OH)(3)Cl acted as the optimal catalytic sites for cyclohexanol oxidization and FeOOH accelerated the reaction rates by reducing the charge transfer resistance, the two-electrode configuration only required a voltage as low as 1.46 V at 10 mA.cm(-2) for cathode H-2 and anode cyclohexanone. Moreover, by further scaling up the configuration into the 10*10 cm(2) anion membrane electrode assembly reactor, a cyclohexanone production rate of 3.44 g/h and the electricity saved about 0.24 kWh/ m(3) (H-2) were achieved. In addition, the reaction pathways, the C-H bond cleaves first, and then the intermediate carbon free radical is dehydrogenated to generate cyclohexanone on Co-II/Co-III redox, was elucidated elaborately. This work offers an approach to actuate effective transformation of organics with high selectivity and industrial practicability under ambient conditions powered by renewable energy.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000799792600002

So far, layered NiFe double hydroxide represents the best OER activity among all Ni- and Co-based oxides. Here, we report new layered Na1-xNiyFe1-yO2 double oxide OER catalysts exhibiting activity and stability surpassing those of noble metal OER catalysts including IrO2 and RuO2, and a layered NiFe double hydroxide OER catalyst. The superior catalytic properties can be ascribed to the layered structure as well as the enhanced covalency of Ni and Fe. Powered by a lead halide perovskite solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 14.69%, a two-electrode solar water-splitting device combining a Na(0.08)Ni0.9Fe(0.1)O(2) OER catalyst with a NiP hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst delivers a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 11.22%.

It exhibits remarkable catalytic activity and stability toward both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER,n= 230 mV at 50 mA cm(-2)) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER,n= 156 mV at 50 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline media, and bi-functionally catalyzes overall alkaline water splitting at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2)by 1.74 V cell voltage withoutiRcompensation. The enhancement mechanism is ascribed to the impregnated metal sulfide clusters in the nanosheets, which not only promote the formation of ultrathin nanosheet to greatly enlarge the reaction surface area while offering high electric conductivity, but more importantly, efficiently modulate the electronic structure of the catalytically active atom sites to an electron-rich state via strong electronic interaction and strengthen the adsorption of oxygenate intermediate to facilitate fast electrochemical reactions.

Herein, we report the development of a highly active bifunctional oxygen electrode by combining the spinel-type CoFe2O4 and the cubic fluorite structured Er0.4Bi1.6O3-delta (CFO-ESB) for applications in reversible SOCs at reduced temperatures. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that CFO had a good chemical compatibility with the ESB phase. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and O-2-temperature-programmed desorption results revealed that the incorporation of ESB into CFO increased the number of chemisorbed oxygen species, thereby promoting their catalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These results were consistently confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, wherein the low polarization resistance of the CFO-ESB electrode in the YSZ electrolyte was observed (e.g., similar to 0.29 omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C). Consequently, the reversible SOC prepared using the CFO-ESB oxygen electrodes showed excellent performances in both the fuel cell (similar to 1.0 W cm(-2) peak power density) and electrolysis cell (similar to 1.5 A cm(-2) at 1.3 V) modes at 700 degrees C. These results are one of the best values among the spinel-based oxygen electrode adopted cells reported to date, demonstrating highly efficient ORR and OER bifunctionality of the CFO-ESB. Thus, our findings suggest that CFO-ESB has high potential for use in oxygen electrodes for reversible SOC applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000741546800001

Usually, binary NiFe or ternary NiCoFe nano-alloys are used as the-OER catalysts. Herein, combining the precursor alloy design with chemical etching, a simple dealloying route is developed to controllably incorporate five or more nonprecious metals into one nanostructured alloy with a naturally oxidized surface, that is, nanoporous high entropy alloys (np-HEAs) covered with high-entropy (oxy)hydroxides (HEOs). It is found that the alloy composition plays a dominant role in the OER activity enhancement with the np-AlNiCoFeX (X = Mo, Nb, Cr) combination showing the highest activity. Forming quinary HEAs also greatly enhances the electrochemical cycling stabilities compared with the ternary and quaternary counterparts. The result indicates the significance of synergistically incorporating five or more metal elements in one single-phase nanostructure, which provides more structural and chemical degrees of freedom to boost the catalytic performance, overcoming the restriction of normal binary or ternary alloys. Multinary transition metal-based np-HEA is a new class of promising catalyst for various important reactions.									103	9	0	0	3	0	105				2639-4979		WOS:000519825500005

These short delta-MnO2 nanowires are (006) crystal plane dominated and the hybrid (delta-MnO2 nanowires/carbon black) exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The half-wave potential (0.82 V (vs. RHE)) and limiting-current density (5.47 mA cm(2)) of the hybrid in alkaline medium are close to those of 20 wt% Pt/C, respectively. The hybrid is used as cathodic catalyst in a Zn-air battery cell, which displays a peak power density of 138.0 mW cm(2), comparable to that using Pt/C catalyst (142.8 mW cm(-2)). This excellent catalytic performance is attributed to the unique microstructure of the hybrid that accelerates the kinetics of ORR. Furthermore, the ORR catalytic mechanism is also systematically analysed based on the microstructural characterization and electrochemical response. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J	STELZNER, T; HEIDE, K; KOTHE, K								EXTRACTION OF OXYGEN DURING HEAT-TREATMENT OF SILICATE MELTS UNDER VACUUM CONDITIONS								GLASS TECHNOLOGY				31	6			236	239						DEC 1990	1990	Degassing experiments showed that a remarkable volume of oxygen is evolved above 1100-degrees-C by heating a silicate glass under vacuum. There are two temperature ranges for the degassing of oxygen: the first lies between 1100 and 1200-degrees-C where the evolution is an escape of physically dissolved oxygen; the second is between 1250 and 1450-degrees-C and here the oxygen originates from the reaction of the fining agent with the melt.The extractable oxygen content decreases with the time of exposure under vacuum and that produced by the reaction of fining agents is affected by both the crucible material and the bulk chemistry of the melt. Further modification results from the concentration of other gases in the melt, mainly CO2 and H2O.For practical use the oxygen degassing is discussed in terms of a 'fining behaviour' which reflects the tendency of bubbles to nucleate in a melt under a particular set of conditions.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0017-1050			WOS:A1990ER39600005

Within the technological framework of chemical looping combustion, the reaction of the oxygen carrier CuFe2O4 with a typical high-sulfur petroleum coke (designated as JS) was performed, focusing on the conversion of the JS coke, the oxygen transfer from CuFe2O4, and the reaction characteristics involved. Simultaneously, the evolution of sulfur and minerals present in JS was also considered. Thermogravimetric analysis of the reaction of CuFe2O4 with JS demonstrated the reaction superiority of CuFe2O4, with its reactivity being close to that of CuO. The preferred CuFe2O4 oxygen excess number phi for JS conversion was determined as unity. Furthermore, both the experimental means, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry and X-ray diffraction analysis, and the thermodynamic simulation of the reaction of CuFe2O4 with JS indicated that the main reduced counterparts of CuFe2O4 were Cu and Fe3O4. Most of the organic sulfur dominant in JS coke reacted with the reduced CuFe2O4 to form Cu2S, and the side product Fe2SiO4 should also be noted for its detrimental effect on the reactivity of CuFe2O4.									20	4	0	0	0	0	24			0930-7516	1521-4125		WOS:000327739400005

Herein, PBA-derived FeP-CoP nanocubes dispersed on Ti3C2Tx MXene have been fabricated by in situ coprecipitation and subsequent phosphorization process. We found that Ti3C2Tx MXene reduced the size of FeP-CoP nanocubes leading to more active sites, and the strong coupling interaction between FeP-CoP and Ti3C2Tx MXene resulted in higher intrinsic activities and faster charge transfer kinetics. Thus, the optimized FeP-CoP/Ti3C2Tx-5 delivers a low overpotential of 270 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 49.1 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH. This study provides an efficient strategy to prepare metal phosphides and MXene hybrids with unique structures for electrocatalytic water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0888-5885			WOS:000835946800001

Its direct one step carbonization followed by air oxidation led to a porous material whose surface was rich in N-, O- and S-containing groups. TEM images showed the presence of 10 nm graphitic domains in the carbon matrix. When the carbon was used as a photoanode under visible light irradiation, oxygen evolution occurred at overpotentials as low as +0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The ability of the carbon to oxidize water was linked to the presence of sulfur and nitrogen containing groups working as chromophores whose electrons are excited by irradiation leaving reactive vacancies (holes) that are able to accept electrons from oxygen in water molecules. The conductivity of the carbon matrix and the presence of small pores were found of paramount importance. While the former helps in electron transfer within the carbon matrix, strong adsorption of water molecules in micropores close to chromophores enhances the electron transfer from oxygen to the vacancy on the chromophore promoting water splitting and oxygen evolution. This work provides the first direct experimental evidence of water photooxidation reactions using metal-free nanoporous carbons exposed to visible light.

O-transfer reactions that appear to occur concurrently with O2 evolution. This voltammetric technique was useful for extracting the rotation-dependent component of the total current from the large, virtually rotation-independent current for O2 evolution. Data for oxidation of I- at Pt, Au, Pd, Ir, and glassy carbon electrodes show that the E1/2 for IO3- production is correlated with the overpotential for O2 evolution at these electrode materials. Data obtained at an Ir electrode for various reactions with widely varying E(o) values reveal uniform E1/2 values closely correlated with the potential for onset of O2 evolution in both alkaline and acidic solutions. The results support the conclusion that the anodic discharge of H2O is a prerequisite of these anodic O-transfer mechanisms.									82	4	0	0	17	0	84			0013-4651			WOS:A1992HH07700025

However, the commercial development of SOCs is hindered by cost and reliability. To solve the issues, lowering the operating temperature of SOCs is deemed the best solution. Here we report on our effort toward intermediate temperature (IT) SOCs by developing a barrier layer free high-performance oxygen electrode and open structured hydrogen electrode. The results show that the new oxygen electrode provides reasonably good oxygen electrocatalytic activity at IT range for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions and the open structured hydrogen electrode provides low gas diffusion path for H-2/H2O. However, at high electrolysis current density such as 1 A cm(-2) and 650 degrees C, the present oxygen electrode delaminates after 200 h. The phase-inversion derived open structured hydrogen electrode helps gas diffusion but, in the meantime, reduces reactive sites. A proper balance of porosity and number of reactive sites is still needed for future hydrogen electrode development.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000769730000001

In this work, commercial carbon fiber cloth (CFC) was thermally treated with PCl3 in a sealed-tube reactor to obtain phosphorus-modified CFC (P-CFC). The P-CFC can deliver an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with only 310 mV overpotential for 50 h with negligible activity decay, which is superior to all other reported metal-free OER electrocatalysts. The mechanism of improved OER activity was systematically studied by electron microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that the p-type doping on the CFC surface by P atom could promote the electron transfer from OH- to the electrode; moreover, the formation of oxidized C-P active sites under anodic potential boosted OER activity both thermodynamically and kinetically. This work not only develops a highly active metal-free OER electrocatalyst but also introduces a promising method to enhance the durability of carbon support for oxidative electrochemical reactions.

Although the anodic half-reaction of water splitting oxygen evolution dominates the overall photoelectrochemical behavior of the photoexcited anatase, simultaneous reduction under photoelectrochemical conditions is also observed on some anatase faces. The activity of individual facets in anodic half-reaction of water splitting (oxygen evolution) increases in the order {101} < {110} < {001}. The increasing oxidation activity tracks the tendency of the surface to generate the OH' radical producing intermediates (H2O2, ozone) on the trapped hole states. The activity in reduction processes increases in the reversed order. Particularly, the reduction activity of the {101} oriented anatase can be attributed to pronounced hydrogen evolution by a charge transfer of photogenerated electrons. The observed trends agree with DFT-based models which confirm the possibility of a rational design of the photocatalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447			WOS:000397546300020

Herein, we report a facile ambient growth of FeOOH nanosheets (NSs) on the surface of Ti3C2 nanosheets to fabricate the hierarchical FeOOH NSs/Ti3C2. The hierarchical structure efficiently suppresses agglomeration of nanosheets to expose maximal electro-active surface, and provides strong interfacial interaction between FeOOH and Ti3C2 that facilitates fast charge transfer, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Specifically, the FeOOH NSs/Ti3C2 achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.63 V vs RHE with a Tafel slope of 95 mV dec(-1), and possesses excellent OER stability with negligible attenuation of current density after 30 h. This work represents that growth of poor conductive active materials on 2D MXene can boost the catalytic performance of electrocatalyst.									28	2	0	0	1	0	29			2365-6549			WOS:000513245800011

We use the results of Prialnik and Kovetz (1995), concerning the effect of accretion onto a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. These calculations have now been followed by further calculations (Kovetz and Prialnik, 1997) aimed at obtaining the detailed break-up of the isotopic abundances in the ejecta. Our models give us the detailed composition of the secondary star throughout its whole evolution, since we use an extended nuclear reaction network. Using the data concerning the isotopic and element abundances of the surface of the secondary star, we show how the ratios of 12C/13C, 14N/15N and 16O/17O and the abundances of C and N are affected by re-accretion of ejecta material.

This unprecedented effort presents a robust, non-costly ternary alkali metal-based chalcogenide (NaFeS2) as an effective and highly active electrocatalyst prepared by the hydrothermal method. The monocrystalline nature of the NaFeS2 nanostructures was shown using SAED patterns. The differences in the atomic radii of Na and Fe favors the formation of Fe-S bonds largely contributing to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of NaFeS2. Further, a decrease in the kinetic energy of the catalytic reaction increases the electrocatalytic property of NaFeS2. We also highlighted the contribution of the high surface area, the Fermi level and the d-orbitals of Fe in enhancing the OER. NaFeS2/NF shows a current density of 200 mA cm-2 with a small potential of 1.60 V and an overpotential of 370 mV indicating that the material possesses a remarkable electrocatalytic activity outperforming other electrocatalysts in the category. Further, by displaying a potential of -220 mV, NaFeS2/NF attained a current density of -100 mA cm-2, demonstrating a significantly improved HER performance of the electrocatalyst. Also, at a potential of -220 mV, the material exhibited a high stability at a continuous electrolysis of about 30 h. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that out of the possible adsorption sites on the NaFeS2 surface, only (010) and (100) exhibit catalytically preferential adsorption energy (EH) values, which are eventually responsible for the superior electrocatalytic activity. Finally, both the experimental studies and the DFT calculations complement each other and present NaFeS2 as a potentially promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting applications, which can be scaled-up and deployed for large-scale hydrogen productions.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000727804600002

Efficient, stable, and cheap electrocatalysts are keys to realizing this strategy. However, high price and preciousness of commonly used noble metal based catalysts severely hinder this realization. Herein, we report nickel iron phosphide (Ni-FexP) bifunctional electrocatalyst via the in-situ growth of Ni-Fe(OH)(x) on nickel foam (Ni-Fe(OH)(x)/NF) followed by low-temperature phosphidation. As a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, the Ni-FexP/NF only needs an overpotential of 119 mV to drive a current density of -10 mA/cm(2) in a base media. It also shows excellent activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with low overpotentials of 254 mV, 267 mV, and 282 mV at 50, 100 and 200 mA/cm(2), respectively. Moreover, when this bifunctional catalyst is used for overall water splitting, a low cell voltage of 1.62 V is needed to deliver a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), which is superior to commercial electrolyzes and it also shows remarkable stability.

Herein, a series of trimetallic porous Pt-inlaid Ni-Fe nanocubes (NCs) are developed with bifunctions of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In the process of prepare the electrochemical catalysts, Pt nanoparticles are uniformly embedded in the Fe-Ni PBA cube structure, and ascorbic acid is employed as a reducing agent to reduce Pt2+ to Pt nanoparticles. In this work, the cubic structure of Fe-Ni PBA is maintained and the noble metal Pt nanoparticles are embedded. Remarkably, the formation of PBA cubes, Pt inlay and reduction are completed in one step, and Pt nanoparticles are embedded by a simple method for the first time. By employing acid etching method, a porous structure is formed on the PBA cube, which increases the exposed area of the catalyst and provides more active sites for HER and OER. Due to the porous structure, highly electrochemical active surface area and the embedded of highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles, the porous 0.6 Ni-Fe-Pt nanocubes (NCs) exhibits excellently electrocatalytic performance and durable stability to HER and OER. In this work, for HER and OER, And Tafel slopes are 81 and 65 mV dec(-1), the overpotential n at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) are 463 and 333 mV, and the onset potential are 0.444 and 1.548 V, respectively. And after a 12-h i-t test and 1000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV), it maintained high stability and durability. This work opens up a new preparation method for noble metal embedded MOF materials and provided a new idea for the preparation of carbon nanocomposites based on MOF.

Herein, an in-situ cobalt extraction and simultaneous coordination growth strategy is adopted to develop an active and robust interface between nanostructural Cometal-organic framework (Co-MOF) pillars and pemvskite LaCoO3-delta (LC). Moreover, the multi-active cobalt sites, including Co3+ in the LC and coordinatively unsaturated cobalt sites in the Co-MOF, could promote the deprotonation of oxygen adsorption intermediates and act as catalytic active centres. Therefore, the optimal sample exhibits excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 330 mV. Notably, the Zn-air battery with CoMOF/LC-0.5 as the OER catalyst exhibits a low charge potential of 2.03 V and excellent cycling stability. This work illustrates efficient electrochemical catalysts based on pemvskites with low overpotentials that are prepared by an in-situ growth strategy, and have great potential in rechargeable Zn-air batteries.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000543021900023

As is generally known, silicon is an element of second abundance in the Earth's crust. We herein chose the silicon element for the desgin and fabrication of OER-active layered nickel cobalt hydrosilicates (NCS) and found that a phosphate-incorporated strategy can significantly enhance the OER performance of the host hydrosilicates. The resulting NCS:P electrocatalyst can generate much larger catalytic current than that of NCS at the same applied potential, which is even superior to that of Ni(OH)(2) and Co(OH)(2) references in 1.0 M KOH. It is expected that structural and composition synergies endow NCS:P with attractive performance.									72	4	0	0	6	0	73			2168-0485			WOS:000429285800007

"In situ" characterisation revealed all oxide layer presented similar structures, except for the 50 mol% IrO2 nominal composition which showed a higher porosity/roughness. The introduction of KPF6 in the electrolyte resulted in an inhibition of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at high current densities, improving ozone generation efficiency at i > 0.4 A cm(-2), while reducing overpotential for OER. When normalised for the area, the ozone current efficiency presented a good performance of the system. However, improvement of the electrode service life is necessary in order to support the drastic conditions observed during EOP. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Transition metal nitrides with suitable hydrogen adsorption energy have been demonstrated as excellent HER catalysts. Here, we report a simple one-step nitridation method to fabricate Ni3N nanorod arrays on nickel foam (NF) for electrocatalytic water splitting. Large specific surface area and good conductivity endow the self-supported Ni3N/NF electrode extremely low overpotential of h10 1/4 45 mV and excellent cycle stability for the HER in 1 M KOH aqueous solution.

The latter is a cytochrome oxidase reaction, Here we describe the structure of an active dioxygen species in the enzyme captured by cryo-trapping, The productive binding mode of dioxygen in the active site is very similar to that of nitrite and suggests that the catalytic mechanisms of oxygen reduction and nitrite reduction are closely related. This finding has implications to the understanding of the evolution of oxygen-reducing enzymes, Comparison of the dioxygen complex to complexes of cytochrome cd(1) with stable diatomic ligands shows that nitric oxide and cyanide bind in a similar bent conformation to the iron as dioxygen whereas carbon monoxide forms a linear complex. The significance of these differences is discussed.									30	0	0	0	24	0	31			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000168198600086	11278884

Phase- and interface-engineered platinum-nickel nanowires (Pt-Ni NWs) are highly efficient electrocatalysts for alkaline HER. The phase and interface engineering is achieved by simply annealing the pristine Pt-Ni NWs under a controlled atmosphere. Impressively, the newly generated nanomaterials exhibit superior activity for the alkaline HER, outperforming the pristine Pt-Ni NWs and commercial Pt/C, and also represent the best alkaline HER catalysts to date.

Herein, a novel structure of quasi-monolayered NiCo-bimetal-phosphide (NiCoP) has been designed and successfully synthesized by the newly developed process combined with ultrasonic-cavitation and phase-transition. This is the first time to break through the controllable prepa-ration of 2D bimetal-phosphides with a thickness of 0.98 nm in sub-nanoscale. Based on the advantages of 2D quasi-monolayer structure with dense crystalline-amorphous interface and the reconfigured elec-tronic structure between Ni delta+/Co delta+ and P delta-, the optimized Ni5%CoP exhibits an outstanding bifunctional performance for electrocatalyzing both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline medium. Ni5%CoP presents lower overpotentials and voltage of 84 mV & 259 mV and 1.48 V at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 for HER & OER and overall water splitting, respectively, which are superior to most other reported 2D bimetal-phosphides. This work provides a new strategy to optimize the performance of electrolytic water for bimetal-phosphates and it may be of significant value in extending the design of other ultrathin 2D structured catalysts.(c) 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The incorporation of hybrid metal atoms significantly improved the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of the nanotubes. In general, the Fe-NiMoO(4)nanotubes exhibited much better electrocatalytic activity for the OER than single-phase NiMoO(4)nanotubes and most other catalysts. To drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the Fe-NiMoO(4)catalyst only required an overpotential of 217 mV, which is comparable to the integrated performance of commercial IrO2. Furthermore, the Fe-NiMoO(4)catalyst showed a stable performance during CV sweeps and long-term tests. The superior activity and long-term stability demonstrate that the hierarchical Fe-NiMoO(4)nanotube catalyst has promising potential for applications in large-scale water splitting.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000580644700033

By adjusting the key parameters during synthesis (e.g., the loading amount and ratio of Co and S precursors), the microstructure can be tailored in a wide rang; and sulfur defects can be introduced into the nanoplates by thermal annealing. The resulting SW-CoS@CNT serves as a freestanding dual-functional catalytic electrode, showing low overpotentials of 105 and 218 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, which are superior to most reported transition-metal-sulfide-based catalysts in alkaline solution.

Phosphate buffer, which has historically been used to control the pH in this system, accelerates the decomposition of the photosensitizer and inhibits O-2 evolution, whereas sodium hexafluorosilicate (Na2SiF6)-base solutions are ideal buffers for the reaction. Na2SiF6-containing buffers poise the solution under visible light irradiation at ca. pH 5, preventing the pH drop that accompanies oxidation of water in unbuffered solutions. Decomposition of the photosensitizer is not kinetically competitive with oxygen evolution in these buffers. In particular, the Na2SiF6-NaHCO3 buffer greatly improves the turnover number of the photosensitizer, relative to previously used phosphate buffers, without any decrease in activity. Photocatalytic reactions studied under various conditions suggest that adsorbed carbonate or bicarbonate on the surface of the colloidal IrO2 particles contributes to the increased turnover number of the photosensitizer.									255	3	0	0	35	1	260			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000088943500016

More importantly, the primary and rechargeable Zn-air batteries using TD-CFs as air-cathode catalysts are constructed. When compared to batteries with Pt/C + RuO2 and Vulcan XC-72 carbon black catalysts, the TD-CFs catalyzed batteries exhibit remarkable battery reversibility and stability over long charging/discharging cycles.									148	8	0	0	8	0	150			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000434172700030	29665265	
J	Soltani, Mohammad; Amin, Hatem M. A.; Cebe, Atilla; Ayata, Sevda; Baltruschat, Helmut								Metal-Supported Perovskite as an Efficient Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Reduction and Evolution: Substrate Effect								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				168	3					034504	10.1149/1945-7111/abe8bd				MAR 1 2021	2021	Due to increased energy demand and environmental concerns, sustainable energy systems such as electrolyzers and Li-air batteries have attracted significant interest. However, it is imperative to develop an efficient inexpensive catalyst for the underlying reactions, namely oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution (OER) reactions, to overcome their sluggish kinetics. In our previous work, a combination of silver and Co3O4 particles showed high bifunctional activity. Herein, we extend the study to investigate how the electrocatalytic activity is dependent on the oxide composition and the type of the underlaying substrate. A significant enhancement in OER performance is realized at perovskite-supported silver or gold electrodes with activity decreasing in the order Ag >= Au>GC. This is attributed mainly to a synergistic interaction between the oxide and metal support and the enhanced conductivity. The ORR activity observed at oxides loaded on Ag and Au bulk electrode is similar, however they exhibit about 450 mV lower overpotential than on GC. The improved activity at oxides/metal substrate renders this approach promising for O-2-electrodes design.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000625970700001

Crystallinities were studied by x-ray diffraction and morphologies by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Average pore sizes and specific surface areas were analyzed using the Barret-Joyner-Halenda and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller methods, respectively. Samples were also studied by cyclic voltammetry using 1 M aqueous KOH solution saturated with either O-2 or N-2 as electrolytes to investigate their ORR (oxygen reduction reaction) and OER (oxygen evolution reaction) activities. Of the samples produced, mesoporous MnO2 exhibited the highest ORR and OER catalytic activities. Mesoporous MnO2 supported on a gas diffusion layer was also used as a catalyst on the air electrode (cathode) of a lithium-air battery in organic electrolyte. The charge-discharge behavior of mesoporous MnO2 was investigated at a current density 0.2 mAcm(-2) in a pure oxygen environment. Mesoporous MnO2 electrodes showed stable cycleability up to 65 cycles at a cell capacity of 700 mAhg(-1).									19	2	0	0	0	1	20			1738-8090	2093-6788		WOS:000341228300013

Here we report the Aurivillius compound CoBi2O2F4 to be a novel catalyst for catalytic OER. After liquid exfoliation of CoBi2O2F4 crystals in isopropanol, the resulting thin sheets deliver a low overpotential of 334 mV and a small Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1) for catalytic OER, exhibiting substantially higher activity and faster kinetics compared with as-synthesized crystals. This attributes to the increase in accessible surface area and dangling bonds on the edges providing more active sites exposed on the surface after exfoliation. The positive effects of F- anions to benefit OH- adsorption/combination and p-block Bi3+ cations to direct reactants to preferred sites are proposed to synergistically improve the Co-active centers for catalysis; based on this, the OER reaction mechanism on this new catalyst is discussed.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000494506500001

SEM and TEM images both illustrated that RuO2 nanoparticles are well dispersed on the surface of MnO2 nanorods in the as-prepared np-RuO2/nr-MnO2 material. Electrochemical results demonstrated that the np-RuO2/nr-MnO2 as oxygen cathode of Li-O-2 batteries could maintain a reversible capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) within 75 cycles at a rate of 50 mA g(-1), and a higher capacity of 4000 mA h g(-1) within 20 cycles at a rate as high as 200 mA g(-1). Moreover, the cell with the np-RuO2/nr-MnO2 catalyst presented much lower voltage polarization (about 0.58 V at a rate of 50 mA g(-1)) than that measured with only MnO2 nanorods during charge/discharge processes. The catalytic property of the np-RuO2/nr-MnO2 and MnO2 nanorods were further compared by conducting studies of using rotating disk electrode (RDE), chronoamperommetry and linear sweep voltammetry. The results illustrated that the np-RuO2/nr-MnO2 exhibited excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities towards both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Furthermore, in-situ high-energy X-ray diffraction was employed to trace evolution of species on the np-RuO2/nr-MnO2 cathode during the discharge processes. In-situ XRD patterns demonstrated the formation process of the discharge products that consisted of mainly Li2O2. Ex-situ SEM images were recorded to investigate the morphology and decomposition of the sphere-like Li2O2, which could be observed clearly after discharge process, while are decomposed almost after charge process. The excellent electrochemical performances of the np-RuO2/nr-MnO2 as cathode of Li-O-2 battery could be contributed to the excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for both the ORR and OER, and to the one-dimensional structure which would benefit the diffusion of oxygen and the storage of Li2O2 in the discharge process of Li-O-2 battery.

Many materials have aroused great attention in this field. The family of nickel-based sulfides is one of the examples that possesses interesting properties in water-splitting fields. In this paper, a controllable and simple strategy to synthesize nickel sulfides was proposed. First, we fabricated NiS2 hollow microspheres via a hydrothermal process. After a precise heat control in a specific atmosphere, NiS porous hollow microspheres were prepared. NiS2 was applied in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and shows a marvelous performance both in acid medium (an overpotential of 174 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and the Tafel slope is only 63 mV/dec) and in alkaline medium (an overpotential of 148 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and the Tafel slope is 79 mV/dec). NiS was used in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) showing a low overpotential of 320 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), which is meritorious. These results enlighten us to make an efficient water-splitting system, including NiS2 as HER catalyst in a cathode and NiS as OER catalyst in an anode. The system shows high activity and good stabilization. Specifically, it displays a stable current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with the applying voltage of 1.58 V, which is a considerable electrolyzer for water splitting.									251	9	0	0	10	0	252			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000392909500059	27996237

Herein, we expand upon initial LIG reports by functionalizing the LIG with metallic nanoparticles for ion sensing, pesticide monitoring, and water splitting. The LIG electrodes were converted into ion-selective sensors by functionalization with poly(vinyl chloride)-based membranes containing K+ and H+ ionophores. These ion-selective sensors exhibited a rapid response time (10-15 s), near-Nernstian sensitivity (53.0 mV/dec for the K+ sensor and - 56.6 mV/pH for the pH sensor), and long storage stability for 40 days, and were capable of ion monitoring in artificial urine. The pesticide biosensors were created by functionalizing the LIG electrodes with the enzyme horseradish peroxidase and displayed a high sensitivity to atrazine (28.9 nA/mu M) with negligible inference from other common herbicides (glyphosate, dicamba, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid). Finally, the LIG electrodes also exhibited a small overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. The oxygen evolution reaction tests yielded overpotentials of 448 mV and 995 mV for 10 mA/cm(2) and 100 mA/cm(2), respectively. The hydrogen evolution reaction tests yielded 35 mV and 281 mV for the corresponding current densities. Such a versatile LIG platform paves the way for simple, efficient electrochemical sensing and energy harvesting applications.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1618-2642	1618-2650		WOS:000691957000001	34468795

It also plays a central role in the development of a renewable energy field for generation a solar fuels by providing both the protons and electrons needed to generate fuels such as H-2 or reduced hydrocarbons from CO2. To improve these processes, it is necessary to expand the fundamental understanding of catalytically active species at low overpotential, which will further the development of electrocatalysts with high activity and durability. In this context, performing experimental investigations of the electrocatalysts under realistic working regimes (i.e., under operando conditions) is of crucial importance. Here, we study a highly active quinary transition-metal-oxide-based OER electrocatalyst by means of operando ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy performed at the solid/liquid interface. We observe that the catalyst undergoes a clear chemical-structural evolution as a function of the applied potential with Ni, Fe, and Co oxyhydroxides comprising the active catalytic species. While CeO2 is redox inactive under catalytic conditions, its influence on the redox processes of the transition metals boosts the catalytic activity at low overpotentials, introducing an important design principle for the optimization of electrocatalysts and tailoring of high-performance materials.									108	6	0	0	10	0	112			2155-5435			WOS:000393539200037

In CGO/Al2O3 composites the resulting effects driven by such mass diffusion are low viscosity flows and high reactivity between phases, indicated by the formation of CeAlO3. This reaction is promoted by the high content of oxygen defects and the chemical reduction of Ce4+ cations to Ce3+ in CGO/Al2O3 composites under low temperature and low pO(2). In this work, a comparison is made between sintering CGO/Al2O3 under ambient air conditions and under low pO(2), focusing on densification, viscosity and the evolution of the microstructure.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000359459900027

To date, transition metal phosphide (TMP) has been considered as one of the most promising catalysts for water splitting because of its multitudinous but controlled constituent elements and stoichiometric ratios. In this review, the electronic structure analysis of TMP dialectically reveals the active derivation for catalyzing hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). And then the strategies of rationally designing the structure and composition of electrocatalyst to improve its intrinsic activity are discussed, especially interface engineering. Besides, this review also focuses on the negligible stability issue during the water splitting process. In the end, some key challenges and research orientations of TMPs are pointed out, which is instructive for developing high-efficient and stable electrocatalysts for water splitting.

In this study, a novel composite material, Ti/TiO2-NTs/PbO2-CNTs-MnO2, with high oxygen evolution electrocatalytic activity was successfully prepared. First, TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2-NTs) were synthesized in situ on a Ti sheet via anodization and used as an intermediate layer. Subsequently, the adhesion and conductivity of the TiO2-NTs layer were increased through additional anodization, annealing, and electrochemical reduction. Finally, PbO2 was electrodeposited with a constant current in a lead acetate medium and doped with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and MnO2. The surface morphology, phase composition, and electrochemical performance of the composite materials were investigated. Notably, in an acidic electrolyte (150 g/L H2SO4), Ti/TiO2-NTs/PbO2-CNTs-MnO2 exhibited good stability (30 h) and a low oxygen evolution overpotential of 410 mV at 50 mA/cm2, which is almost equivalent to that of precious metals (RuO2 and IrO2) and 499 mV lower than that of the industrial Pb-0.76 wt% Ag alloy. The outstanding performance is mainly attributed to the high aspect ratio of the TiO2-NT structure, synergistic effects of the active particles, and inherently good electrochemical properties of the active particles. Therefore, this study provides a new synthetic route for oxygen evolution materials in acidic media.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000684281000004

The synergistic effects between the hierarchically porous 1D carbon structure and the embedded FeNxC active sites in the carbon framework manifest in superior catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to Pt/C catalyst in both alkaline and acidic media. A rechargeable zinc-air battery assembled in a decoupled configuration with the nonprecious pCNT@Fe@GL/CNF ORR electrode and Ni-Fe LDH/NiF oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrode exhibits charge-discharge overpotentials similar to the counterparts of Pt/C ORR electrode and IrO2 OER electrode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0935-9648			INSPEC:17402133

Here, water-induced formation of Ni2P-Ni12P5 through a one-step phosphorization of nickel foam (NF) is demonstrated for the first time. The abundant interfaces endow Ni2P-Ni12P5/NF with excellent electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in alkaline condition, with an overpotential of 76 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and of 147 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), and a Tafel slope of 68.0 mV dec(-1). The Ni2P-Ni12P5/NF also exhibits better durability than Pt/C/NF during HER at relatively large overpotential. Density functional theory calculations show that the electronic states at the Ni2P-Ni12P5 interface are greatly altered, which enables optimal hydrogen adsorption, accelerates the charge transfer kinetics, and thus enhances the HER electrocatalytic activity. Superior overall water-splitting performance is also obtained by combining Ni2P-Ni12P5/NF with NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. Overpotentials of the cell for achieving 10 mA cm(-2) are only 324 mV. This work provides a facile method for the preparation of interfaces between different nickel phosphide polymorphs toward HER.									50	4	0	0	2	0	52			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000608844800001	33470529

By taking advantages of the unique properties such as solvent effect and low volatility, ionic liquid serves as solvent to disperse metal ions in the precursor preparation and nitrogen-containing carbon source during pyrolysis. The FeCo alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in the N-doped carbon matrix show a homogeneous distribution with average sizes of 50-100 nm. Such a core-shell structure endows the catalyst with both high ORR and OER activity and robust stability in alkaline environments. Especially, the half-wave potential (E-1/2) for ORR is 0.86 V and the overpotential (E-over) for OER to reach the 10 mAmiddotcm-2 current density is only 280 mV. Furthermore, the obtained bifunctional electrocatalyst also displays high efficiency and great durability when applied in the rechargeable Zn-air battery. The specific capacity and energy density at the discharge current density of 10 mAmiddotcm(-2) reach up to 741.5 mAhmiddotg-1 and 830.1 Wh kg(-1), respectively. It's envisioned that this ultra-facile method would be applicable to synthesize highly efficient catalysts for other energy conversion systems. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The synthesized alpha-MnO2/RuO2 urchin nanostructure was constructed with several straight and radially grown nanorods, and composed of homogeneously distributed MnO2 and RuO2 nanoparticles. When the alpha-MnO2/RuO2 nanostructure was applied for air cathode catalyst, it displayed superior cyclic performances of lithium air battery with stable specific capacity, decreased overpotential and good retention rate. The alpha-MnO2/RuO2 urchin nanostructure exhibited excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Linear sweep voltammetry study confirmed that the alpha-MnO2/RuO2 nanostructure possesses catalytic performance comparable to that of commercial Pt/C for the ORR, while it exhibits lower onset potential and higher limiting current than those of commercial Pt/C for the OER.

Herein, a chemical grafting strategy was proposed to facilitate the surface reconstruction of Ni-Co layered double hydroxide@MXene quantum dot (Ni-Co LDH@MQDs) electrocatalysts to optimize the OER kinetics. The surface reconstruction of Ni-Co LDH@MQDs was predicted and monitored by a combination of ab initio molecular dynamics, density functional theory and experimental verification. Compared with weak electrostatic bonds, the rapid surface evolution of electrocatalysts can be revealed due to the strong chemical grafting between the MQDs and LDHs. The reconstituted Ni-Co LDH@MQD electrocatalysts undergo an unconventional bifunctional mechanism to lower the barriers of the rate-limiting step of the OER. This work provides a research strategy for transition metal catalysts for efficient catalysis by designing surface reconfiguration.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000864274400001	36197411

Herein, we fabricated a monolithic-structured electrode by facilely electrodepositing NiCoFe ternary layered double hydroxides (LDHs) onto 3D conductive scaffolds, providing abundant fully exposed active sites for electrochemical reactions. The moderate Co dopant effectively improved the electrical conductivity of the LDH phase and substantially increased its intrinsic activity. When used for oxygen evolution, the asobtained monolith LDH electrode exhibited superior kinetics with 275 mV overpotential required to achieve 10 mA cm-2 in 0.10 M KOH, as well as a very low activation energy of 21.0 kJ mol-1. Such a freestanding electrode was also able to catalyze hydrogen evolution efficiently in alkaline media, which further enabled a high-efficiency water electrolyzer delivering 10 mA cm-2 at a very low cell voltage of 1.62 V in 1.0 M KOH. This sheds fresh insight into the principle and process of practical water electrolysis through the rational design of precious-metal-free bifunctional electrodes with a monolithic configuration.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488			INSPEC:16681205

However, their limited active sites and poor electric conductivity pose a significant hurdle to their HER performance, resulting in a large overpotential. Here, we report the defect engineering in ultrathin tungsten telluride (WTe2) nanosheets with semimetal nature to improve hydrogen evolution effectively. We find that the oxygen plasma etching imposes a cutting effect on WTe2 nanosheets, resulting in a large number of tungsten vacancies. Particularly, the sample after plasma treatment for 10 min shows a feather-like structure with an overpotential of 251 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope of 94 mV/dec, which is 4 times lower than the Tafel slope of pristine nanosheets. Further first-principles calculations shed light on the evolution of defect-rich WTe2 nanosheets and offer rational explanation to their superiority in efficient hydrogen evolution.

The clay mineral montmorillonite (Mmt), sodium montmorillonite (Mmt-Na+) and functionalized material (Mmt-LMO) were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM/Edx) techniques. The XRD patterns of Mmt-LMO composites show both the presence of the perovskitic phase with orthorhombic structure, and a mixture of aluminosilicates, corresponding to the montmorillonite clay minerals. The (Mmt), (Mmt-Na+) minerals and (Mmt-LMO) hybrid material were used to manufacture modified electrodes whose catalytic properties for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions were investigated in alkaline medium.Based on electrochemical experimental results, some of these electrodes are catalytically active toward the hydrogen evolution reaction and the more performant ones were investigated further and it was found that the electrode modified with the composition containing 6 mg LaMnO3 functionalized montmorillonite and 10 mu L Nafion solutions have the best electrocatalytic properties. At the current density of -10 mA/cm(2) the electrode exhibits an over potentialfor hydrogen evolution of -0.48 V and its Tafel slope was measured to be 70 mV/dec.

Herein, a newly designed Fe-Co-Ni-B/boron-doped vertically oriented graphene (Fe-Co-Ni-B/BVG) electrocatalyst is fabricated via single-step electrodeposition method. The as-synthesized electrocatalyst exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities with low overpotentials of 41, 140, and 168 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)in 1.0 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4, and 1.0 M phosphate buffer solutions (PBS), respectively at all pH values (pH 0-13.8). Fe-Co-Ni-B/BVG electrocatalyst also exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities with overpotentials of 163 and 110 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)in 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M PBS solutions, respectively. This electrocatalyst also shows prominent electrochemical durability (over more than 10 h). This study may provide a facile design for the fabrication of cost-effective and non-noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts material for overall water splitting withstand in different pH conditions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000570812400001

The electrochemical potential oscillation on quaternary alloy anode in electrolytic metal manganese (EMM) with and without sodium oleate (NaOL) was studied to investigate electrode reaction process. It is observed that NaOL affected the amplitude and frequency of potential oscillation by chronoamperometry measurement and phase space reconstruction. Furthermore, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results revealed a certain amount of NaOL could reduce the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode. In electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) exploration, the electrode process presented different reaction mechanisms in the absence and presence of NaOL. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FHA) were utilized to characterize the obtained electrolytic product. The combination of OL- and Mn2+, to a certain extent, inhibited the side reaction on anode, responded with reduced potential oscillation frequency and decreased potential value in phase space portrait. Based on the gained results, the relationship between EO and electrode reaction mechanism regulated by NaOL in EMM was proposed. This makes it possible to regulate electrochemical reaction by adjusting the intuitive oscillating signals.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000474325800003

Herein, Co nanoparticles embedded in the N, P-codoped porous carbon (Co/P-N-C) are synthesized using a novel Co-based metal-organic polymer (Co-MOP) as the precursor through carbonization and a subsequent phosphorization treatment process. When the phosphorization treatment is carried out at pH 3, Co/P-N-C exhibits a very low overpotential of 300 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 61 mV dec(-1) and excellent stability over 20000 s. The electrocatalytic performance of Co/P-N-C was even better than that of the commercial RuO2 material. Density functional theory calculations were used to simulate the electrocatalytic process and to verify the experimental findings, which showed that the superior OER performance was attributed to the active sites of doped P and Co nanoparticles. This viable strategy of using a novel Co-MOP to create a novel phosphorized Co/P-N-C microporous carbon-based material may expand the opportunities for the exploration of high-performance and robust nonnoble metal electrocatalysts for energy-conversion reactions.

Herein, a metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived hybrid nanostructure consisted of multiple transition metal phosphide (NiCoZnP) nanoclusters and hierarchical ultrathin N-doped carbon (NC) nanosheets is successfully synthesized as binder-free bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. The ultrafine and monodispersed NiCoZnP nanoclusters with uniform sizes of 3 nm are homogeneously distributed on the ultrathin NC nanosheets, leading to self-supported NiCoZnP/NC nanosheets array on carbon cloth (CC). The NiCoZnP/NC exhibits large surface area and numerous active sites due to the small sizes of NiCoZnP and hierarchical nanostructures of NC. Furthermore, the NiCoZnP/NC nanosheets are directly grown on CC and avoids the usage of binder, which significantly reduces the electrical contact resistance and exhibits superhydrophilic performance. Therefore, the self-supported NiCoZnP/NC nanosheets array demonstrates high HER activity with low overpotential of 74 mV and OER activity with overpotential of 228 mV to reach current density of 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH solution, and exhibits remarkable overall water splitting performances with low potential of 1.54 V to drive 10 mA cm-2 and good long-term stability.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000672588900003

Herein, AgCuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced as a novel bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. The catalyst, AgCuO2 NPs, exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity together with a low overpotential for the overall water-splitting process. The AgCuO2 exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity with a low onset overpotential of 29 mV for the HER and the onset overpotential of 360 mV for the OER, with superior long-term stability in 1.0 M KOH. The catalyst delivered 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at extremely low overpotentials of 42 and 47 mV for the HER and 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 388 mV for the OER.

N-MWCNTs-Co acts as an electrocatalyst for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hence can be used in secondary metal-air batteries and in unitized regenerative fuel cells. It is important to study the OER and ORR at high concentrations of KOH as most of the metal-air batteries employ KOH concentrations >4 M. The OER potential of N-MWCNTs-Co at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was 0.6 V vs. Hg/HgO (corresponding to an overpotential of 0.364 V) in 6 M KOH. The activity towards the ORR of N-MWCNTs-Co at -0.1 V vs. Hg/HgO was 2.7 and 0.2 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M and 6 M KOH respectively. Based on our ORR, OER and impedance studies, we postulate that the non-covalent interactions between the hydrated alkali metal cations and the adsorbed oxygen-based species on the catalyst surface are responsible for the reduction in ORR activity and enhancement in OER activity with increasing KOH concentration. Finally, we provide our initial results using this bifunctional catalyst in a zinc-air battery.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			2046-2069			WOS:000381513100050

Herein, we report a heterostructure of Ni3S2 nanoarray with secondary Fe-Ni(OH)(2) lamellar edges that exposes abundant active sites towards seawater oxidation. The resultant Fe-Ni(OH)(2)/Ni3S2 nanoarray works directly as a free-standing anodic electrode in alkaline artificial seawater. It only requires an overpotential of 269 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) and the Tafel slope is as low as 46 mV center dot dec(-1). The 27-hour chronopotentiometry operated at high current density of 100 mA center dot cm(-2) shows negligible deterioration, suggesting good stability of the Fe center dot Ni(OH)(2)/Ni3S2@NF electrode. Faraday efficiency for oxygen evolution is up to similar to 95%, revealing decent selectivity of the catalyst in saline water. Such desirable catalytic performance could be benefitted from the introduction of Fe activator and the heterostructure that offers massive active and selective sites. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the OER has lower theoretical overpotential than Cl-2 evolution reaction in Fe sites, which is contrary to that of Ni sites. The experimental and theoretical study provides a strong support for the rational design of high-performance Fe-based electrodes for industrial seawater electrolysis.									65	4	0	0	3	0	66			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000587978600004

Using first-principles computations, we proposed a novel design of a nickel single atom catalyst (Ni-SAC) supported by a hybridized graphene-boron nitride monolayer (BCN), to work as a highly active bi-functional electrocatalyst for both HER and OER. B-vacancy defects on BCN can immobilize Ni-SACs with high diffusion barriers. Owing to the effective charge polarization and synergistic effects between graphene, the BN domain, and Ni atoms, this design exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity with very low overpotentials of 0.47/0.02 V for OER/HER. Our design not only provides great potential for achieving overall water splitting but also adds a new class of electrocatalysts for a wide range of clean energy technologies.									29	3	0	0	0	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000501213600007

But they are still prone to be attacked by superoxides or singlet oxygen via hydrogen abstract reactions, which leads to performance decaying during long-term operation. Herein we propose a methylated cyclic ether, 2,2,4,4,5,5-hexamethyl-1,3-dioxolane (HMD), as a stable electrolyte solvent for LOBs. Such a compound does not contain any hydrogen atoms on the alpha-carbon of the ether, and thus avoids hydrogen abstraction reactions. As the result, this solvent exhibits excellent stability with the presence of superoxide or singlet oxygen. In addition the CO2 evolution during charge process is prohibited. The LOB with HMD-based electrolyte was able to run up to 157 cycles, 4 times more than with 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) or 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) based electrolytes.									28	4	0	0	0	0	29			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000458417700027	30589170

Cubic nickel oxide nanosheets were used as catalysts for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxidation of chiral 2-butanol. Under artificial simulated sunlight, NiO-Vo1 exhibited good photo-electrocatalytic OER activity and catalytic stability. The high catalytic activity is mainly attributed to the activation of nickel active sites by the halide ion-induced oxygen defect and the enhancement of photoinduced electron-hole separation efficiency. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic performance of oxygen-deficient nickel oxide for the oxidation of chiral 2-butanol was investigated. The results show the catalytic activity of NiO-Vo1 for electrocatalytic oxidation of 2-butanol to butanone compared with NiO. Interestingly, there is no significant difference in the electrocatalytic activity of NiO for (R)-(-)-2-butanol and (S)-( +)-2-butanol oxidation. When NiO-Vo1 was used as the catalyst, the catalytic oxidation reaction rate of (R)-(-)-2-butanol alcohol was significantly higher than that of (S)-( +)-2-butanol alcohol. At 1.77 V vs RHE voltage, the (R)-(-)-2-butanol alcohol has obvious oxidation reaction while the (S)-( +)-2-butanol alcohol is almost absent, realizing the selective electrocatalytic oxidation of (R)-(-)-2-butanol alcohol. This may be attributed to the difference in the interaction strength of chiral molecules with the surface defects of NiO after applying a voltage during the catalytic process, resulting in different catalytic activities. Here, our proposed strategy through the synergistic effect of applied voltage and surface defects provides a new approach for chiral molecule synthesis and efficient chiral resolution. The halide ion-induced defect-catalyst provides a new strategy for the preparation of efficient electrocatalytic water splitting OER and alcohol-selective oxidation catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000832441600001

In this work, we synthesize bimetallic RhCu ultrathin nanoflake nanoaggregates (RhCu-BUNNs) with atomic thickness by a facile hydrothermal method. For the NRR, bimetallic RhCu-BUNNs exhibit better electrocatalytic activity than monometallic Rh ultrathin nanoflake nanoaggregates (Rh-UNNs) because the introduction of Cu can effectively weaken the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which can achieve a high NH3 yield rate (95.06 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1)) at -0.2 V potential. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the introduction of Cu can effectively lower the energy demand in the *NN reductive process, resulting in NRR activity enhancement. Meanwhile, RhCu-BUNNs also show excellent electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for the glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR). For the electrochemical NH3 production, the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) increases the overall electrolysis voltage. Herein, we replace the anodic OER with the GOR to assist the NRR using a bifunctional RhCu-BUNN electrocatalyst. Specifically, only 1.2 V whole voltage is required for electrochemical NH3 production in the presence of glycerol, accompanied by the generation of valuable glyceraldehyde at the anode. This work may provide a promising pathway to obtain both NH3 and valuable organic chemicals with high efficiency and low cost.									51	2	0	0	1	0	52			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000489345300009

The concept offers several advantages over conventional electrolysis in terms of safety, durability, modularity, and purity. In this work, we demonstrate a vanadium-manganese redox-flow battery, in which Mn3+/Mn2+ and V3+/V2+ respectively mediate the OER and the HER in Mo2C-based and RuO2-based catalysts. The flow battery demonstrates an average energy efficiency of 68% at a current density of 50 mA . cm(-2) (cell voltage = 1.92 V) and a relative energy density 45% higher than the conventional all-vanadium RFB.

Linking the DFT calculations to ab-initio thermodynamic considerations in conjunction with microkinetic modeling enables gaining deep insights into the activity and selectivity trends of graphene-based electrodes as a function of applied bias. We illustrate that both the coverage of intermediates on the electrode surface and the applied electrode potential have a significant effect on the Faradaic efficiency for the electrocatalytic production of H2O2. The presented approach to study overpotential-dependent selectivity trends allows deriving design criteria for peroxide formation, which may serve as a guideline for further studies to realize selective formation of H2O2 using carbon-based materials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000655640900024

(J. Chem. Phys. 130, 104306/9 (2009)). In principle, the reactions initiated by UV photolysis of N2O/I-2 mixtures can be used to probe the chain propagation stage of this dissociation model, and provide additional validation. In the present study, 193 nm laser photolysis of N2O/I-2 mixtures was used to initiate secondary chemical reactions and to produce iodine atoms. Singlet oxygen was generated in this system by the fast reaction O(D-1)+N2O -> O-2(a)+N-2. Emission spectroscopy and laser induced fluorescence techniques were used to follow the time evolutions of I* and I-2. The photolysis of N2O/I-2 mixtures creates all of the species needed to sustain the chain propagation stage of I-2 dissociation process. However, it was found that the high pressures of N2O needed to generate sufficient concentrations of O-2(a) suppressed the I-2 dissociation process. Computational modeling indicated that suppression of the chain propagation reactions under the conditions examined was consistent with the revised dissociation model.

Likewise, to transform a spinel oxide, such as cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4), into a worthy universal-pH, bifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER, respectively), oxygen defects need to be regulated. Prepared by coprecipitation and inert calcination at 650 degrees C, CoFe(2)O(4)nanoparticles (NPs) require 253 and 300 mV OER overpotentials to reach current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, if nickel foam is used as a substrate. With cost-effective carbon fiber paper, the OER overpotential increases to 372 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)at pH 14. The NPs prepared at 550 degrees C require HER overpotentials of 218, 245, and 314 mV at -10 mA cm(-2)in alkaline, acidic, and neutral pH, respectively. The intrinsic activity is reflected from turnover frequencies of >3 O-2 s(-1)and >5 H-2 s(-1)at overpotentials of 398 and 259 mV, respectively. If coupled for overall water splitting, the extremely durable two-electrode electrolyzer requires a cell potential of only 1.63 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2)at pH 14. The homologous couple also splits seawater at impressively low cell voltages of 1.72 and 1.47 V at room temperature and 80 degrees C, respectively.									28	0	0	0	2	0	28			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000542818200001	32469148

Given the many possible reaction intermediates that could exist on the surface of an electrocatalyst, the determination of the precise operative mechanism for a given overall reaction is a challenging task. Indeed, multiple possible pathways could give rise to the final product in an electrocatalytic cycle, although some of these pathways could be more likely to occur than others. In this work, we formulate an optimization framework to discover all possible reaction mechanisms leading to a desired electrochemical product and to sort the mechanisms according to their thermodynamic reaction overpotentials. To this end, we elucidate the basic physical constraints that underlie any electrochemical transformation. We use these constraints to enumerate all potential reaction mechanisms for the specific case of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involved in water splitting on beta-nickel oxyhydroxide, a promising alkaline-medium electrocatalyst. Our analysis reveals several competing OER mechanisms on pure and iron-doped forms of this material, via both single- and two-site pathways and consisting of varying numbers of elementary steps. Our work underscores the complexity of characterizing the mechanism of a given electrocatalytic process, while providing a methodology to address this complexity.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000598992900033

These materials were synthesized by directly coating a thin layer of polydopamine (PDA) on the cage-like structure of graphitic carbon followed by subsequent carbonization without the aid of metal catalysts. By virtue of the versatile coating ability associated with the high nitrogen content, dopamine was demonstrated to be an effective precursor for the preparation of nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon. Various experimental results indicated that dopamine-derived nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon improved the performance of Li-O-2 batteries in terms of capacity, rate capability and cycle life. The enhanced performance was attributed to the formation of active nitrogen functional groups, which benefit the fast electrochemical kinetics of the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions in the oxygen electrode of Li-O-2 batteries.

However, their wide application is prevented by several remaining technical issues, one of which is the lack of suitable bifunctional cathodic catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during discharging and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during charging. Due to low material cost and wide distribution, carbon-based materials may serve as promising electrocatalysts, while doping heteroatoms such as nitrogen or boron can effectively enhance their catalytic activity. Herein, we pyrolyze a metal-organic framework containing Zn, N, and B as the precursor to synthesize dual-doped and metal-free porous carbon materials as efficient ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts. The surface area of obtained carbon materials can be greatly enhanced by pyrolysis under H-2-containing atmosphere. In addition, N and B are evenly distributed within the carbon materials due to the crystalline MOF precursor. The resultant carbon materials exhibit high ORR and OER catalytic activities in both half-cell and single-cell battery measurements. Our study has demonstrated for the first time that MOFs can be used as precursors to synthesize metal-free ORR/OER bifunctional cathodic electrocatalysts with great potential in rechargeable Zn-air batteries.

The phase structure, microstructure, and electrocatalytic properties of the infiltrated electrodes were investigated in comparison with the pristine La1.8Sr0.2NiO4+delta electrode. The Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 infiltrated into the porous electrode backbone appeared as nano-sized particles deposited on La1.8Sr0.2NiO4+delta grains. The primary steps of the electrode reaction were facilitated to varying extents with the assistance of oxygen vacancies in the Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9. As a result, the overall reaction kinetics of the infiltrated electrodes was accelerated. The oxygen vacancy-assisted acceleration effect was leveled off at a Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 loading of around 10 vol%. The leveling-off behavior was explained with respect to the microstructural evolution of the electrodes with increasing Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 loading. The 10 vol% Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 infiltrated electrode achieved appreciably improved electrocatalytic properties.

Here, a novel architecture of discrete heterojunction nanofibers (DH-NFs) was obtained by growing Bi2WO6 nanosheets (NSs) on electrospun BiFeO3 nanofibers (NFs) via solvothermal technology. The charge-separation efficiency of BiFeO3/Bi2WO6 DH-NFs was approximately 2 times higher than that of BiFeO3 NFs and Bi2WO6 NSs. As expected, the BiFeO3/Bi2WO6 DH-NFs exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activities for oxygen evolution and RhB degradation. The reaction rates of BiFeO3/Bi2WO6 DHNFs for oxygen evolution and RhB degradation were 18.3 and 36.7 times higher, respectively, than those of BiFeO3 NFs, and 31.9 and 8.7 times higher than those of Bi2WO6 NSs, respectively. The improved charge-separation efficiency and enhanced photocatalytic activities of BiFeO3/Bi2WO6 DH-NFs could be attributed to the following three points. The 1D heterojunctions could realize the separation and axial transport of photogenerated charges. The discrete structure could facilitate the spatial separation of redox reaction sites as well as photogenerated charges. The high surface area of BiFeO3/Bi2WO6 DH-NFs might provide more active sites for photocatalytic reaction.

The resultant material serves as a selfimproving high intrinsic catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and exhibits desirable activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Results demonstrated that two different phases of MoS2 and Ni3S2 along with the presence of abundant active sulfur edge sites and particular structure lead to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity. The most interesting point is the self-improving behavior of MoS2/Ni3S2 NCR by proceeding the HER. It means by time and catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction the performance of catalyst improved, so that after long time HER the catalyst reaches 10 and 20 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 40 and 85 mV, respectively. It is found that the improvement in catalytic performance can be assigned to the charge transfer enhancement and increasing in active surface area as HER proceeds. Further, characterization investigations show that thiourea phosphate-assisted strategy plays a key role to attain the nano-cubic rods structure. Indeed, the generated MoS2 nanolayers act as a substrate for anchoring and growing of Ni3S2 nano-cubic particles and consequently lead to preparation of cubic nano rods structures. Besides, low onset potential with the overpotential of 200 mV was obtained for OER using MoS2/Ni3S2 NCR. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

For low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation, the yield of Ce3+ is 2.4 molecules / 100 eV, regardless of the presence of oxygen. To investigate the reaction mechanisms of the ceric sulfate dosimeter, we simulated the chemical reaction kinetics curves and the evolution of G(Ce3+), G(O-2), and G(H-2) in the ceric sulfate solution with and without oxygen. Studies of G(Ce3+) as function of the initial concentration of Ce3+ and of the LET were also done. One important finding of this study is that (OH)-O-center dot radicals are scavenged by the reaction (OH)-O-center dot + HSO4- -> SO4 center dot- + H2O, rather than by the reaction (OH)-O-center dot + Ce3+ -> Ce4+ + OH-.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0008-4042			WOS:000308691800001

Herein, we develop high-performance non-noble metal electrocatalysts for pH-universal water splitting, based on nickel/vanadium boride (NiVB) nanoparticles/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrid (NiVB/rGO) through a facile chemical reduction approach under ambient condition. By virtue of more exposure to surface active sites, superior electron transfer capability and strong electronic coupling, the as-prepared NiVB/rGO heterostructure needs pretty low overpotentials of 267 and 151 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) respectively, with the corresponding Tafel slope of 44 and 88 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, the NiVB/rGO electrocatalysts display a promising performance in a wide-pH conditions that require low overpotential of 310, 353 and 489 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER under 0.5 M KOH, 0.05 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) respectively, confirming the excellent electrocatalytic performance among state-of-the-art Ni-based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Therefore, the interfacial tuning based on incorporation of active heterostructure may pave a new route to develop bifunctional, cost-effective and efficient electrocatalyst systems for water splitting and H-2 production.

It is expected that water electrolysis, powered by renewable energy sources, be able to scale-up hydrogen production. However, the reaction kinetic of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) isa sluggish process, which predominantly limits the efficiency of water electrolysis. This review recapitulates the recent progress and efforts made in the design and development of two selected earth-abundant bimetallic electrocata-lysts (NiCo and CoFe) for alkaline OER. Each bimetal electrocatalyst is thoroughly outlined and discussed in five sub-sections, including bimetal (oxy) hydroxides, Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) structures, oxides, composites, alloy and nanostructured electrocatalysts, and assembled with heteroatoms. Furthermore, a brief introduction to an in situ/operando characterization techniques and advantages for monitoring the structure of the electrocatalysts is provided. Finally, a summary outlining the chal-lenges and conceivable approaches to advance OER performance is highlighted and discussed.

Performances of catalysts are appreciably affected by the adsorption energies of key reaction intermediates, whereas the active site engineering to achieve optimal adsorption energy remains challenging. Herein, using density functional theory calculations, we proposed a novel design of transition metal single-atom active sites supported by carbon nanocone (CNC) with high coordination diversity. The particularly diversified electronic states of CNC carbon atoms endow varying coordination to the metal active sites, which then results in a near-continuum distribution of adsorption energies for key intermediates. With this mode, 33 CNC-based active sites exhibit outstanding catalytic potential for the HER with near-zero free energy barriers. Meanwhile, five distinct Cu-N3 active sites can serve as promising candidates for the ORR with low overpotentials. Our work suggests a new strategy of making nanocone-based single-atom catalysts with promising catalytic performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1948-7185			WOS:000835251800001	35900130

In this work, a relatively unexplored and mechanistically unclear nickel-based catalyst has been explored as an ORR and OER catalyst using density functional theory (DFT) investigations. A detailed reaction mechanism involving four-coordination and three-coordination Ni-N-C configurations on a graphene substrate have been investigated, together with the effects of OH ligand binding on Ni-N-C-gra towards ORR and the OER. Through our simulations, we identified the existence of strong influences of the N and C co-ordination environment around the Ni atoms, and the OH ligand affinity determines the overall bifunctional ability of Ni-based catalyst systems. After a detailed analysis, the four-coordination NiC(4)shows excellent bifunctional catalytic potential (eta(ORR)= 0.48 V,eta(OER)= 0.40 V), while NiN3, NiN2C and NiNC(2)have excellent OER catalytic performance (eta(OER)= 0.23, 0.20 and 0.42 V). Analysis of the effects of OH ligand reveals that Ni(OH)N-3, Ni(OH)NC(2)and Ni(OH)C(3)show efficient ORR catalytic performance (eta(ORR)= 0.45, 0.43 and 0.42 V). The calculations in our study reveal that the co-ordination of N and C with Ni greatly affects the bifunctional activity; hence, fine tuning of the C and N contents is highly essential during the catalyst synthesis process.									14	2	0	0	0	0	14			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000578872600019

Amorphous bimetallic NiFe-based (oxy)hydroxides have excellent OER activity under alkaline media, but their poorly electrical conductivity impedes the further improvement of their catalytic performance. Herein, a bimetallic NiFe-based heterostructure electrocatalyst that is composed of amorphous NiFe(OH)(x) and crystalline pyrite (Ni, Fe)Se-2 nanosheet arrays is designed and constructed. The catalyst exhibits an outstanding OER performance, only requiring low overpotentials of 180, 220, and 230 mV at the current density of 10, 100, and 300 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1) in 1 m KOH, which is among the state-of-the-art OER catalysts. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, the electronic coupling at the interface that leads to the increased electrical conductivity and the optimized adsorption free energies of the oxygen-contained intermediates plays a crucial role in enhancing the OER activities. This work focusing on improving the OER performance via engineering amorphous-crystalline bimetallic heterostructure may provide some inspiration for reasonably designing advanced electrocatalysts.									43	0	0	0	1	0	43			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000612025200001	33501753

A Fe-Co-S/NF bifunctional electrocatalyst with nanoflower-like structure was synthesized on three-dimensional porous nickel foam through one-step hydrothermal and one-step high-temperature sulfuration operations, and the material displays high-efficiency electrocatalytic performance. As a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction, Fe-Co-S/NF can drive a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 143 mV with a Tafel slope of 80.2 mV/dec. When it was used as an oxygen evolution reaction catalyst, it exhibits good OER reactivity with a low Tafel slope (82.6 mV/dec) and with requiring only 117 mV overpotential to drive current densities up to 50 mA/cm(2). In addition, the Fe-Co-S/NF//Fe-Co-S/NF electrolytic cell was assembled, an electrolysis voltage of 1.64 V is required to drive a current density of 50 mA/cm(2), which is one of the most active catalysts reported so far. This work indicates that the introduction of S, P and Se treating processes could effectively improve electrical conductivity of the material and enhance the catalytic activity of the material. This work offers an effective and convenient method for improving the morphology of the catalyst, increasing the surface area of the catalyst and developing high-efficiency and low-cost catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000628907800001	33660405

However, recent studies on transition-metal oxyhydroxides depict that iron is the active site for water oxidation. Herein, a heterobimetallic ferberite iron-tungstate nanostructure has been employed as an efficient anode material not only for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involving water and ethanol oxidation but also as a non-noble metal-based anode for overall water splitting (OWS). The presence of tungstate in the nanostructure improves the efficiency of OER, as reflected in the overpotential value of 282 (+/- 3) mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1), which is far better compared to that of pure iron-oxyhydroxides as well as some noble metal-based catalysts. A fair activity of the FeWO4 anode further helped to construct a water electrolyzer coupled with a commercial Pt cathode, giving a cell potential of only 1.66 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density. The strong binding of [FeO6] with the corner- and edge-shared [WO6] presumably provides facile electron conduction as well as robustness in the structure, which results in long durability during OER and OWS. This study showcases a facile approach to design a stable anode relying on earth-abundant metal precursors, which has remained a perdurable challenge so far.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000823097500001

Cobalt oxide/graphene (Co3O4/GR) nanocomposites are synthesized for improved oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction functionalities. The Co3O4/GR composites with Co3O4 loads of 33.7 wt%, 48.2 wt%, and 62.5 wt% are prepared using hydrothermal synthesis. The Co3O4/GR composites' catalytic activities on oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction is shown to reduce the polarization of pristine carbon cloth electrode by 40% and serve as a good cathode catalyst. Lithium/air batteries are assembled with a lithium metal/organic electrolyte/ceramic lithium-ion conductive membrane/aqueous electrolyte/air cathode configuration. These batteries with the developed catalysts demonstrate good long-term stability over 120 h when fed with high (70-100%) relative humidity ambient air. More importantly, the results indicate the Co3O4/GR composite in 48.2:51.8 (w/w) is the optimal load for the hybrid electrolyte lithium-air battery due to its balanced amount of catalytic Co3O4 and charge-transfer mediated graphene, and good dispersibility of the nanocatalyst on the planar graphene surface.									11	2	0	0	1	0	11			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000551511800016

Acetaldehyde-d(4) and methane-d(4) were produced on the mixed overlayers, whereas the major reaction pathway is decomposition to CO on pure Co and formation of ethylene-d(4) on sulfur- or oxygen-covered Mo(110). This inhibition of C-H bond breaking is attributed to electronic modification of the Co film by the underlying sulfur or oxygen. The chemical properties of the unannealed Co-on-sulfur and Go-on-oxygen systems suggests that the Co forms a somewhat uniform layer on top of the sulfur or oxygen at 100 K, as opposed to aggregating into islands. However, the evolution of ethylene-d(4) as the major product from ethanol-da reaction on the annealed Co-S and Co-O systems shows that annealing induces Co-island formation, which leaves regions of sulfur- and oxygen-covered Mo(110) exposed. Modification of the electronic properties and the morphology of the thin Co films significantly alters the reactivity of these surfaces. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this work, Ni3Fe alloy nanoparticles incorporated in three-dimensional (3D) carbon nanotube (CNT)/graphene nanosheet composites with N and S codoping (Ni3Fe/N-S-CNTs) as bifunctional oxygen electrode electrocatalysts for zinc-air battery. The main particle size of Ni3Fe nanoparticles could be well restricted because of the unique 3D structure of carbon nanotube/graphene nanosheet composites (N-S-CNTs). The large specific area of N-S-CNTs is conducive to the uniform dispersion of Ni3Fe nanoparticles. On the basis of the synergistic effect of Ni3Fe nanoparticles with N-S-CNTs, and the sufficient exposure of reactive sites, the synthesized Ni3Fe/N-S-CNTs catalyst exhibits excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 215 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and efficient ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.877 V.

Urea electrolysis can produce hydrogen more energysavingly by replacing OER process with urea oxidation reaction (UOR) due to favorable thermodynamic potential, however lacking efficient UOR catalysts restricts the industrial application. Here we reported novel NiMo-based nanorods, Ni/Ni0.2Mo0.8N/MoO3, by thermal ammonolysis of NiMo-based precursor as excellent catalyst for OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with small overpotentials of 252 mV, and 103 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, the Ni/Ni0.2Mo0.8N/MoO3 shows fabulous catalytic UOR activity with a low potential of 1.349 V at 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming most recently reported non-noble metal catalysts and commercial RuO2. More importantly, the cell voltage of urea electrolysis using Ni/Ni0.2Mo0.8N/MoO3 as cathode for HER and anode for UOR is significantly reduced from 1.52 V of traditional water electrolysis to 1.356 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) with excellent stability for over 400 h, superior to almost recently reported catalysts. The high performances result from the synergistic effect between highly active and conductive metal nickel and nitride, and nanorods arrays grown on 3D substrate. This work demonstrates that this material holds encouraging potential in largescale energy-saving H-2 production and urea-related wastewater treatment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we have fabricated a Co3O4 nanoflakes/nitrogen-doped modified CMK-3 (Co3O4/N-HNMK-3) nanocomposite by a simple solvothermal method. The Co3O4/N-HNMK-3 nanocomposite exhibits not only superior ORR activities (a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.77 V vs. RHE and a J(1600 rpm) of -4.31 mA cm(-2) at 0.5 V vs. RHE) but also excellent OER activities (an over-potential eta(10) mA cm(-2) of 365 mV) in alkaline media. The overall oxygen electrode performance of Co3O4/N-HNMK-3 demonstrates the lowest Delta E (E-OER,E- 10 mA cm-2-E-ORR,E- -3 mA cm-2) value of 0.86 V compared with the benchmark (20 wt% Pt/C and RuO2/C). Moreover, Co3O4/N-HNMK-3 also displays superior methanol tolerance in ORR and good durability in both ORR and OER, showing potential applications in oxygen electrocatalysts.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1387-7003	1879-0259		WOS:000499766900041

However, due to the insufficient activity and stability of bifunctional electrocatalysts for air-cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes, the practical application of rechargeable ZABs is seriously hindered. In the effort of developing high active, stable and cost-effective electrocatalysts, transition metal nitrides (TMNs) have been regarded as the candidates due to their high conductivity, strong corrosion-resistance, and bifunctional catalytic performance. In this paper, the research progress in TMNs-based material as ORR and OER electrocatalysts for ZABs is discussed with respect to their synthesis, chemical/physical characterization, and performance validation/optimization. The surface/interface nanoengineering strategies such as defect engineering, support binding, heteroatom introduction, crystal plane orientation, interface construction and small size effect, the physical and chemical properties of TMNs-based electrocatalysts are emphasized with respect to their structures/morphologies, composition, electrical conductivity, specific surface area, chemical stability and corrosion resistance. The challenges of TMNs-based materials as bifunctional air-cathode electrocatalysts in practical application are evaluated, and numerous research guidelines to solve these problems are put forward for facilitating further research and development.

The presence of Zn2+ segregation has been identified experimentally and theoretically under oxygen-evolving condition, the newly formed V-Zn-O-Co allows more suitable binding interaction between the active center Co and the oxygenated species, resulting in superior ORR performance. Moreover, a liquid flow Zn-air battery is constituted employing the structurally optimized Zn0.4Ni0.6Co2O4 nanoparticles supported on N-doped carbon nanotube (ZNCO/NCNTs) as an efficient air cathode, which presents remarkable power density (109.1 mW cm(-2)), high open circuit potential (1.48 V vs. Zn), excellent durability, and high-rate performance. This finding could elucidate the experimentally observed enhancement in the ORR activity of ZnXNi1-XCo2O4 oxides after the OER test.									166	11	0	0	7	0	167			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000516811300001	31984615

The phase structure has been analyzed by X-ray diffraction technique. Based on the XRD and SEM results, it is believed that the synthesized products are poorly crystallized. To exclude the disturbance of electrode preparation technology on the evaluation of electro-catalytic activity, the real electrode surface area is calculated based on the cyclic voltammetry data, assumed that the specific surface capacitance is 60 mu F cm(-2) for metal oxide electrode. The real electrode area data are used to calculate the current density. The reaction rate constant of OER at different electrodes is also estimated based on basic reaction kinetic equations. It is found that the exchange current is 0.05-0.47 mA cm(-2) (the real surface area), and the reaction rate constant has an order of magnitude of 10(-2)-10(-6) cm s(-1). The influence of the electrode potential on OER rate has been also studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique. Our investigation has shown that the nickel element has more contribution than the cobalt; the nickel oxide has the best electro-catalytic activity toward OER. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The performance of ZABs strongly depends on the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Spinel oxides (AB2O4) have received particular attention because of their high chemical stability under operation conditions, rich raw materials, and compositional flexibility, which provides ample room for the design of spinel-structured oxides for ORR/OER catalysis. Many spinel oxides have been successfully applied as air cathodes in ZABs, but the related research is rather scattered. In this review paper, we will provide an in-time comprehensive review of the recent advances in the development of spinel oxides as ORR/OER electrocatalysts and their particular application as air electrodes in rechargeable ZABs. First, we will introduce the electrochemical fundamentals of OER and ORR on spinel oxides and the key factors determining their activity. Then, we will present the activity regulation strategies of spinel oxides and the performance of rechargeable ZABs using spinel-based air cathodes. Finally, we will highlight the current challenges and future developing directions of spinel-based air cathodes. This review could inspire further mechanistic study of the ORR/OER catalysis on spinel oxides and the development of high-performance air cathodes.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2688-4070			INSPEC:20333776

This report indroduces CuCo2O4 nanoparticles/Ti3C2Tx/nickel foam (NF) hybrid electrocatalyst as a robust electrode for OER, where the presence of the Ti3C2Tx MXene structure could enhance the electrical conductivity of the electrocatalysts. The ultra-thin hybrid structure with large surface area can effectively increase the number of electrochemically active sites and enhance the electrocatalytic performance. Experimental findings indicated that CuCo2O4/Ti3C2Tx hybrid structure on NF shows superior improved OER electrocatalytic activity compared to pristine Ti3C2Tx. Accordingly, hybrid elecrocatalyst not only showed a low overpotential of 1.67 V at 100 mA.cm2, and a small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec-1, but also exhebited an outstanding long-term durability.

Silicon has the potential for high efficiency oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, an important factor, which is the doping concentration of the silicon influence on the OER performance, has not been studied. Our results show that the performance of the silicon photoanode is significantly influenced by its resistivity, which is directly related to the doping concentration. In combination with ultrathin NiFe alloy nanoflakes (2 nm thick) deposited by the electron beam evaporation method, a NixFe(1-x)/TiO2/n-Si photoanode for water oxidation has been demonstrated. Our results show that the prepared Ni80Fe20/TiO2/n-Si photoanode with Si resistivity of 0.5 Omega.cm(-1) exhibits high catalytic performance with a low onset potential of 1.06 V versus RHE (eta(0) = -0.17 V), which are comparable to the state-of-the-art photoanodes using Ir or Ru as a catalyst. In addition, the photocurrent density at the reversible potential for water oxidation (1.23 V versus RHE) is around 21.5 mA.cm(-2), which is higher than most of the metal/TiO2/n-Si photoanodes. Therefore, our Ni80Fe20/TiO2/n-Si (0.5) photoanode shows great potential to replace precious metals for highly efficient large-scale water splitting.									29	1	0	0	1	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000401054300021

Doped MXene combinations as highly efficient bifunctional and multifunctional catalysts for water splitting and metal-air batteries								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				10	42			22500	22511		10.1039/d2ta06297f		SEP 2022		NOV 1 2022	2022	Designing highly efficient bifunctional and multifunctional catalysts for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has attracted acute attention, toward the development of clean and renewable energy technologies. The rare introduction of non-noble TMs such as Fe/Ni/Cu at the surface of MXenes as single atoms (SAs) has shown modified mechanical and electrical properties. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations along with machine learning (ML) based descriptors, we have systematically screened and investigated different MXene combinations based on stability of intermediates and adsorption free energies, exploring their ability to catalyze the reactions. The results reveal that most of the considered MXenes are thermodynamically stable with Ni/Cu/Fe doping, showing the best performance for the OER/ORR/HER, respectively. The surprisingly small overpotentials for these reactions exhibit desirable bifunctional catalysts for water splitting (eta(overall) = 0.48 V) and metal-air batteries (eta(overall) = 0.70 V), even superior to commercially used IrO2(111) and Pt(111) for the OER and HER/ORR, respectively. The high correlations between intermediates (scaling relations) and the varying interaction strength with the catalytic surface mostly govern the performance. The Bader analysis, d-band, and charge density difference show that doped metals not only act as active sites but also behave as an important charge transfer medium between the surface and adsorbate. The significantly low reaction barriers of Ni-Cr2ScC2O2 for all three reactions with robust reaction kinetics make it an efficient trifunctional catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000870387700001

Herein, a cobalt phosphide (CoxP) electrocatalyst composed of high-density small Co2P/CoP nanoparticles homogeneously embedded in one-dimensional (1-D) carbon has been synthesized by using surface-engineered cobalt benzimidazole zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-9) rods as a precursor. The surface engineering strategy employs melamine to modify ZIF-9 by constructing robust Co coordination sites on ZIF-9 surface through the coordination of Co with nitrogen donor sites in melamine. DFT calculations indicate that the surface engineering of ZIF-9 triggered by melamine occurs not only at coordinatively unsaturated Co sites but also at coordinatively saturated Co sites via a thermodynamically favored ligand exchange process between benzimidazole in ZIF-9 and melamine. Subsequent reaction with red phosphorus at high temperature affords a 1-D material having highdensity of CoxP reactive sites and facilitated charge/mass transport, leading to an outstanding electrocatalytic activity for OER-even comparable to commercial RuO2-and excellent electrochemical durability. This scalable strategy involving surface engineering of MOFs represents a breakthrough in the synthesis of efficient OER electrocatalysts in water electrolyzer application.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000805856800003

Herein, partially phosphidated core@shell Co@Co-P nanoparticles encapsulated in bamboo-like N, P co-doped carbon nanotubes (denoted as Part-Ph Co@Co-P@NPCNTs) are prepared through a pyrolysis-oxidation-phosphidation strategy. In this structure, each Co nanoparticle is covered with a thin Co-P layer to form a special core@shell heterojunction interface, and the core@shell structure is further encapsulated by N, P co-doped CNTs that not only protect the Co from corrosion but also guarantee an effective and fast electron transfer on cobalt phosphide. As a bifunctional catalyst for both the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, it exhibits an excellent activity for overall water splitting, and enables long-term operation without significant degradation. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the interface of the Co/Co2P heterojunction could lower the values of Delta G(H)* (hydrogen adsorption) and Delta G(B)(water dissociation), which are negatively correlated to thej(10), because of the electronic structures of up-shiftedd-band center. This study not only presents an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for overall water splitting but also provides a special route for the interface engineering of heterostructures.									37	2	0	0	1	0	37			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000571755300001	32964616

It is also one of the most active electrocatalysts for the oxidation of water, relevant to electrochemical water splitting. However, the use of RuO2 is limited by its low anodic stability under acidic conditions, especially at high overpotentials. In the present work, the electrochemical stability of model RuO2 (110)/Ru(0001) anodes was investigated in order to gain a deeper understanding of the relation between structure and performance in Cl-2 and O-2 evolution reactions (CER and OER, respectively). Online electrochemical mass spectrometry was used to determine the onset potential of CER and OER in HCl and H2SO4 electrolytes, respectively. The onset potential of OER was higher in HCl than in H2SO4 due to competition with the kinetically more favorable CER. A detailed stability evaluation revealed pitting corrosion of the electrode surface with exposure of Ru(0001) metal substrate concomitant with the formation of a hydrous RuO2 in some areas regardless of the applied electrochemical treatment. However, despite local pitting, the RuO2 (110) layer preserves its thickness in most areas. Degradation of the electrode was found to be less severe in 0.5 M HCl due to a decrease in the faradaic efficiency of RuO2 oxidation caused by competition with the kinetically more favorable CER.

Herein, we demonstrate the construction of interface-strengthened CoP nanosheet array with Co2P nanoparticles as such an electrocatalyst through a facile hydrothermal reaction and the subsequent phosphorization process. The two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets with thickness of similar to 55nm expose a great number of active sites. The surface chemical state indicates that the strongly coupled CoP/Co2P electrocatalysts can adsorb or generate more targeted intermediates (e.g. OH- or OOH*) for both HER/OER. As a result, the CoP/Co2P electrocatalysts exhibit small overpotentials of 68 and 256mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively, outperforming most of the recently reported Co-based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, an alkaline electrolyzer assembled by using CoP/Co2P as both cathode and anode can achieve a current density of 10mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of 1.57V and work continuously for over 58 h. This work provides a feasible structural design for transition metal phosphides electrocatalysts with efficient and stable overall water splitting.

Many difficulties in the realization of the real role of ROS in vital activity are caused by the attitude to them only as to chemical substances, while they should be considered in the first place as the major participants of continuous flows of highly non-linear processes in which electron excited species emerge. These processes play a significant role in energy and informational flows in all the living systems. We suggest that the mechanisms of biological action of ROS are determined by the structural patterns (frequency-amplitude patterns of electron excited states generation and their relaxation) of the processes with ROS participation taking place in the aqueous environs. Energy released in such reactions is used as an activation energy for specific biochemical processes, for the continuous 'bumping" of the non-equilibrium state of inter- and intracellular structural components, while the structural patterns of ROS reactions determine biochemical and physiological rhythmic modes. Special role of water in all these phenomena is discussed. From a broader perspective the processes with ROS participation emerging in water preceded and were the necessary condition for origination and evolution of organic living forms on Earth.									19	0	3	0	17	0	23			0035-6050			WOS:000171842800003	11702650

In this work, we have reported the synthesis of FeNiP/NC hollow microboxes (FeNiP/NC) based bifunctional electrocatalyst via the phosphorization process using rationally designed cube-type metal-organic framework (FeNi-MOF) as both the template and carbon source. The FeNiP/NC, which were obtained by assembling the uniform FeNiP nanoparticals together through N-doped carbon, manifests outstanding catalytic performances for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in KOH solution. Notably, FeNiP/NC displays exceptional activity when it was utilized as both anode and cathode toward overall water splitting with potential of 1.54 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte, which is much better than FeP/NC and Ni2P/NC electrocatalyst. More importantly, the improvement of the catalytic activities of FeNiP/NC mainly benefits from the well dispersion of FeNiP nanoparticles on the surface of carbon support, the large active surface area and the doping of N and C derived from organic ligands. In addition, the enhanced electrocatalytic performance of FeNiP/NC for OER is closely related with the in-situ formed surficial MOOH (M = Fe, Ni) active sites, which has been confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis.

Developing cheap yet durable substitutes of precious-metal catalysts, especially the bifunctional electrocatalysts with high activity for both ORR and OER reactions and their streamlined coupling process, are highly desirable to reduce the processing cost and complexity of renewable energy systems. Here, a facile strategy is reported for synthesizing double-shelled hybrid nanocages with outer shells of Co-N-doped graphitic carbon (Co-NGC) and inner shells of N-doped microporous carbon (NC) by templating against core-shell metal-organic frameworks. The double-shelled NC@Co-NGC nanocages well integrate the high activity of Co-NGC shells into the robust NC hollow framework with enhanced diffusion kinetics, exhibiting superior electrocatalytic properties to Pt and RuO2 as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER, and hold a promise as efficient air electrode catalysts in Zn-air batteries. First-principles calculations reveal that the high catalytic activities of Co-NGC shells are due to the synergistic electron transfer and redistribution between the Co nanoparticles, the graphitic carbon, and the doped N species. Strong yet favorable adsorption of an OOH* intermediate on the high density of uncoordinated hollowsite C atoms with respect to the Co lattice in the Co-NGC structure is a vital rate-determining step to achieve excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity.									541	42	0	0	24	0	552			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000407565700013	28627127

Hydrogen evolution on tungsten-based catalysts in alkaline solution								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				44	25	SI		12576	12582		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.02.151				MAY 17 2019	2019	High-purity hydrogen generation for primary energy production is one of the main goals of the renewable energy consumption model. In this regard, water electrolyzers (WE) are projected to fulfil this requirement since they can be coupled to renewable sources, which provide the necessary energy to generate the water splitting reaction. Nowadays, no-noble materials are usually employed as low-cost catalysts to overcome the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, kinetics and mechanistic studies of the HER from faradaic currents is becoming more challenging due to the overlap of by-side reactions such as catalyst oxides reduction. Herein, for the first time ionic currents from differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) are employed to overcome this issue. Thus, the m/z = 2 signal is followed during the hydrogen evolution on tungsten-based catalysts in basic medium and accurate Tafel slopes are achieved and the rate determining step (RDS), as well as the reaction mechanism can be easily attained.

This lumped approach model is able to account for multiple redox processes at each electrode, which, to our knowledge has not been described in the literature. In this article the study is focused on alkaline battery and the model has been validated on 2,6-dihydroanthraquinone/ferrocyanide electrolytes at laboratory full cell level. The model considers the electrochemical reactions, the electrolyte flow rate, the diffusion of the electroactive molecules from the bulk to the reaction sites, the transfer of cations through a perfluorosulfonic membrane and the ohmic losses. Furthermore, the electrochemical reactions accounted for include the reduction and the oxidation of water modeled with Tafel slopes. Thanks to this approach, we highlight the non-negligible role of oxygen evolution reaction in these conditions. The model is used as a tool to optimize operating conditions as well as to predict the most advantageous potential of electrolytes to enhance performances and limit side reactions. For example, under alkaline condition (pH = 14), the negolyte standard potential can be targeted to -0.8 V without competing with HER, however, the posolyte potential must be kept below 0.65 V to avoid competition with OER.

In this study, porous Pt/IrO2/carbon paper (CP) electrocatalysts were developed to reduce the metal loading. The Pt/IrO2/CP electrodes were fabricated by sequential formation of IrO2 layers (loading 0.1 mg cm(-2)) and porous Pt layers (0-0.3 mg cm(-2)) on CP substrates by electrodeposition and spraying techniques, respectively. The fuel cell (FC) performances increased linearly up to 0.69 A cm(-2)with increasing Pt loading (up to similar to 0.3 mg cm(-2)) at 0.6 V, whereas the water electrolysis (WE) activity was highest at Pt loading of 0.2 mg cm(-2). The current densities in the FC and WE modes and round-trip efficiency of the developed Pt/IrO2/CP electrodes with the oxygen electrocatalysts loadings of 0.3 and 0.4 mg cm(-2) were higher or comparable to previously reported values with higher loading (1.5-4.0 mg cm(-2)). These high performances with low loading are probably due to the facile oxygen and water transport through well-developed macropores originating from the open CP structures, providing effective utilization of the IrO2 and Pt electrocatalysts towards OER and ORR, respectively.

Herein, an in situ construction strategy to introduce flexible redox sites of V-Ni centers onto Ni-based metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheet arrays (NiV-MOF NAs) as a promising oxygen electrocatalyst is developed. The abundant redox V-Ni centers with flexible metal valence states of V+3/+4/+5 and Ni+3/+2 enable NiV-MOF NAs excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and a long-term stability under high current densities, achieving current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at recorded overpotentials of 189 and 290 mV, respectively, and showing ignorable decay of initial activity at 100 mA cm(-2) after 100 h OER operation. Operando synchrotron radiation Fourier transform infrared combined with quasi in situ X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopies reveal at atomic level that the flexible V sites can continuously accept electrons from adjacent active Ni sites to accelerate OER kinetics for NiV-MOF NAs during the reaction process, accompanied by a self-optimized structural distortion of VO6 octahedron for promoting the electrochemical stability.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2366-9608			WOS:000693698700001	34927938

The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) resulting from the complicated reaction mechanism and the requirement of the noble metal iridium as the anode catalyst are the two key challenges in implementing proton exchange membrane electrolysis. These challenges may be overcome by the nanoscale design and assembly of novel hybrid materials. Grain boundaries (GBs) are a common crystallographic feature that increase in variability and attractiveness as the particle size decreases. However, the effects of GBs on OER activity in supported hybrid IrO2 catalysts remain unclear. In this study, supported hybrid IrO2 catalysts containing ultrafine nanoparticles were prepared via the self-assembly of iridium precursors on the beta-MnO2 surface. The GBs induced intriguing features such as abundant coordination-unsaturated iridium sites and surface hydroxylation, resulting in enhanced OER activity. The formation of GBs was strongly dependent on the nature of the support. In addition to the morphology, the crystal structure of the substrate may play an important role in inducing dense nanoparticle growth. The established relationship between GB formation and OER activity provides an opportunity to design more stable and effective IrO2-based hybrid materials for the OER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000681739300001	34477659

Herein, a novel bimetallic metal-organic framework (MOF), specifically a copper-cobalt 1, 3, 5-benzenetricarboxylate (Cu-Co-BTC) MOF, was successfully prepared by employing the gas-solid two-phase flow (GSF) synthetic technique. The as-prepared Cu-Co-BTC with its multiple active sites afforded a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 239 mV for the OER in a 1 mol L-1 KOH solution, and showed a better electrocatalytic performance than did single-metal-containing Cu-BTC and Co-BTC materials.

Nanocomposites with the non-noble metal based on MXene have important application prospects in the field of electrocatalytic decomposition of water. In this study, Co4MnFe3/Ti3C2 has been successfully synthesized only by the one-step method and prepared using ultrathin two-dimensional layered Ti3C2 as substrate materials, which is much more convenient than most electrocatalyst hybridization. The hybrid exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in alkaline media with an overpotential of 263 mV and Tafel slope of 26.3 mV.dec(-1), which is much lower than that of its pure Co4MnFe3 counterparts and RuO2 catalyst in alkaline medium. When the current density reaches 10 mA/cm(2), excellent long-range stability is displayed. Meanwhile, a fast reaction kinetics can also be obtained. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations reveal that, due to electron interactions and d-band center of metals, the enhanced density of states in the vicinity of the Fermi level has great influence on the oxygen evolution reaction property of the electrocatalyst via adjusting the adsorption strength of intermediates, which can improve the electrocatalytic performance of the hybrid. More importantly, this work provides a new approach for the electrolytic water oxygen evolution reaction of MXene-based catalysts in alkaline media and shed light on the exploration of advanced electrocatalysts for renewable energy conversion and storage systems.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000680445800011

However, the mechanism for the hydrogen evolution reaction on transition metal phosphides remains unclear. Here, we explore the catalytically active sites and the reaction mechanisms on a variety of model transition metal phosphide surfaces by building cluster expansion models and running Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate that the effect of hydrogen coverage, interaction between hydrogen atoms and desorption kinetics all dictate the HER mechanisms and the active sites, and we propose mechanisms that are in good agreement with experimental studies. The present method provides a general and effective way to probe the active sites and study the mechanisms of catalytic reactions, which can facilitate the rational design of highly active electrocatalysts.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000498220500021	31687692

The SANi-I is prepared via a simple calcination step in a vacuum-sealed ampoule and subsequent cyclic voltammetry activation. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy are applied to confirm the atomic-level dispersion of iodine atoms and detailed structure of SANi-I. Single iodine atoms are found to be isolated by oxygen atoms. The SANi-I is structural stable and shows exceptional electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

Here, we studied the possibility of using poly-5-aminoindole together with graphene oxide, multilayer graphene (MLG), or nitrogen-doped MLG (N-MLG) for the formation of Co-N-C electrocatalysts for both ORR and HER in acid electrolyte. Using 5-aminoindole with ammonium persulfate instead of pre-prepared polymer allows to simplify the synthesis of Co-N-C electrocatalysts, but causes the presence of Co9S8 particles in their composition. It was found that type of graphene-like precursor affects composition catalysts and the ratio of active sites, which leads to differences in their catalytic performance towards ORR and HER. The best efficiency of electrocatalyst derived from N-MLG for both ORR (onset potential of 795 mV, half-wave potential of 688 mV, and a Tafel slope of 73 mV/dec) and HER (overpotential of 207 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm(2), and a Tafel slope of 69 mV/dec) is largely attributed to the highest content of pyridinic nitrogen in its composition, which is responsible for the formation of CoNx active sites. The obtained results allow to conclude that the same active sites of the prepared catalysts are participate in both HER and ORR.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000673808200001

However, achieving the multifunctional activity of the catalyst via the adjustment of strain engineering remains a major challenge. Herein, an excellent trifunctional electrocatalyst (Ru/RuO2@NCS) is prepared by anchoring lattice mismatch strained core/shell Ru/RuO2 nanocrystals on nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets. Core/shell Ru/RuO2 nanocrystals with similar to 5 atomic layers of RuO2 shells eliminate the ligand effect and produce similar to 2% of the surface compressive strain, which can boost the trifunctional activity (oxygen evolution reaction [OER], oxygen reduction reaction [ORR], and hydrogen evolution reaction [HER]) of the catalyst. When equipped in rechargeable Zn-air batteries, the Ru/RuO2@NCS endows them with high power (137.1 mW cm(-2)) and energy (714.9 Wh kg(zn)(-1)) density and excellent cycle stability. Moreover, the as-fabricated Zn-air batteries can drive a water splitting electrolyzer assembled with Ru/RuO2@NCS and achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) only requires a low potential similar to 1.51 V. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the compressive strained RuO2 could reduce the reaction barrier and improve the binding of rate-determining intermediates (*OH, *O, *OOH, and *H), leading to the enhanced catalytic activity and stability. This work can provide a novel avenue for the rational design of multifunctional catalysts in future clean energy fields.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2567-3165		WOS:000797829800001

In this work, a facile electrochemical method was employed to directly deposit Ni3S2 on Ni foam (NF) decorated with graphene (G) for the construction of a self-supporting electrocatalyst NF@G@Ni3S2 with a 3D porous structure. Due to the intrinsic catalytic activity and continuous Ni-Ni network of Ni3S2, 3D porous structure of NF and the excellent electron conductivity of the graphene as well as their synergistic effects, NF@G-5@Ni3S2 exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic performance. In the alkaline solution, the low overpotentials of 119 and 249 mV were required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. And the Tafel slopes were only 64.8 and 98.2 mV dec(-1) for HER and OER, respectively. Remarkably, by employing NF@G-5@Ni3S2 as both anode and cathode for full water splitting, a very low cell voltage of 1.62 V was needed to reach 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, NF@G-5@Ni3S2 also showed an excellent stability for all HER, OER and overall water-splitting, demonstrating a potential prospect of NF@G-5@Ni3S2 for the practical application. Our work opens up a new direction for the development of non-noble metal electrocatalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The substrate generation/tip collection mode of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) quantified the current efficiency (CE) of ClER with a large tip-to-substrate distance (>500 mu m) to avoid intervention of bubbles and spatial variations. Surface interrogation SECM using [Ru(NH3)(6)](2+/3+) coupled with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) identified the Pt4+-enriched surface of Pt/PtOx with a bilayer structure to give more efficient regeneration of Pt(0) under the shorter reversal interval. The in situ SECM complemented bulk electrolysis and XPS to demonstrate that CIER on Pt(0) and OER on Pt/PtOx primarily determine the CE of CIER, in agreement with a kinetic model. The descriptive role of surface Pt/PtOx ratio rationalized the enhanced selectivity for CIER upon the polarity switching, being independent on a scaling relationship. The current reversal (not allowed to IrO2 electrodes) also alleviated calcareous scale deposit in the electrolyte with hardness.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000679917500034	34270208

In this study, amorphous CoFeP/NC hybrid electrocatalyst has been synthesized by a simple and effective phosphorization of a CoFe-based coordination polymer under N-2 atmosphere. The synergistic effects between the CoFeP and N-doped carbon has led to high electronic conductivity attributed to the optimal Fe contents with N-doped carbon and enlarged electrocatalytic active surface area aroused by the nanostructure of CoFeP/NC, as well as the surface structural evolution of oxyhydroxide/phosphate during OER process. The resulting Co0.35Fe0.17P0.48/NC electrocatalyst can attain a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 275 mV with a Tafel slope of 31 mV/dec on glassy carbon electrode and 228 mV on Ni foam electrode in 1 M KOH solution, long-term OER stability of this Co0.35Fe0.17P0.48/NC under the applied potential of 1.53 V vs. RHE demonstrates no obvious decline in current densities of 110 mA/cm(2) within 17 h, which outperforms those of the contrast electrocatalysts in this work and also comparable to that of many of the reported electrocatalysts in the literatures. This Co0.35Fe0.17P0.48/NC electrocatalyst highlights the rational modulation of optimal composition and electronic structure with homogeneous incorporation of the foreign metal-doped and N-doped carbon for the synthesis of highly efficient electrocatalysts toward to the water oxidation reactions.

In this paper, we report a novel hybrid nanostructure with Co, Ni and S co-doped N-enriched porous carbon polyhedron (CoNixSy/NCP) via a absorption-pyrolysis-sulfuration strategy derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) and explored its electrocatalytic performance for OER. During the synthesis process, Ni2+ is abosrbed within the pores or surface of ZIF-67 and Ni/ZIF-67 can be transformed into the Co and Ni co-doped porous carbon frameworks when it is sulfurazed at 800 degrees C. NiS2 and NiCo2S4 nanoparticles formed at high temperature are homogeneously dispersed in porous carbon and can activate its electrocatalytic performance. The porous carbon can enhance the electrochemical surface area and charge transfer efficiency. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between highly active NiS2, NiCo2S4, and porous carbon, CoNixSy/NCP electrocatalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance. The results show that CoNi.Sy/NCP also exhibits a potential as low as 1.51V to achieve 10 mA/cm(2) current density and extremely stability towards OER. The good electrocatalytic activity of CoNixSy/NCP further suggest its great potential as an efficient eletctocatalyst for sustainable energy applications. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

These perovskite phases have been used as catalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution in re-chargeable Zn/air batteries. The utilization of a synchronized reactive gas pulse with N2O or O-2 allows the preparation of perovskite films with almost ideal oxygen content without additional annealing steps and to control the oxygen content of the films. The films with higher oxygen content reveal a lower resistivity. These compositions have been selected to study the influence of the texture on the electrocatalytical activity for oxygen reduction and evolution of the films. Amorphous films, or films with mixed or single orientation can be obtained by varying the target-substrate distance and substrate temperature without changing the composition of the films. A clear influence of the crystallinity on the catalytic activity, i.e. smaller overpotential for the two oxygen reactions, is observed. The amorphous films reveal the largest overpotential, followed by the polycrystalline films with one or more orientations, and the single crystalline films with (100) orientation.

A large parametric study performed in a closed reactor brings valuable information about both dissociation and recombination processes. The CO2 conversion shows a time evolution initially controlled by electron impact dissociation. For longer plasma-on times, the dissociation fraction reaches a steady-state that corresponds to a balance between dissociation processes and back-reaction mechanisms. The characteristic times of vibrational and rotational excitation of CO and CO2 are measured during a single plasma pulse. The dependence of the CO2 conversion as a function of pulse duration and frequency is then analyzed, showing the influence of the plasma excitation conditions on the back-reaction mechanisms. The study of CO2-O-2 and CO-O-2 gas mixtures gives further insight into the impact of the oxygen content in these mechanisms. The global back-reaction rate observed in these experiments is compared with calculated values from rate coefficients available in the literature. The experimental results and preliminary calculations reveal a key role of molecular oxygen and of the metastable electronically excited state CO(a(3)Pi(r)) in the back-reaction. Competing processes involving vibrational excited CO are not dominant in our discharge conditions but may become relevant at slightly higher vibrational temperatures.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000562945600003

Fe-doped Ni2P nanosheets are then insitu grown on Ni submicrowires by a simple wet-chemical reaction followed by a low-temperature phosphorization process. The (Ni0.87Fe0.13)(2)P-Ni composite exhibits the highest catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution among all the as-prepared (Ni1-xFex)(2)P-Ni catalysts, delivering a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at an overpotential of only 257 mV and keeping high stability over 10 h electrolysis. These exceptional activities are attributed to the unique structure combining metallic Ni submicrowires as good electronically conductive substrate and the insitu grown Fe-doped Ni2P nanosheets. Specifically, Fe incorporation leads to strong electron interactions between Ni, Fe, and P, fast reaction kinetics, small charge-transfer resistance, and a large electrochemical surface area, which are responsible for the excellent catalytic performance.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000434071100014

The development of highly efficient, low cost, and stable electrocatalysts is of great importance for the large-scale application of overall water splitting. Herein, we report an effective and facile strategy to prepare non-noble nickel-iron (NiFe) alloy nanoparticles (NPs) decorated on oxidized carbon cloth (OCC) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The homogeneous dispersion of small-sized NPs achieved by anchoring the metal species to oxygen-containing groups on the OCC support, together with the 3D conductive nature of the scaffold, ensures optimal exposure of active metal sites and also results in high electrical conductivity. As a result, our electrocatalyst affords superior oxygen evolution reaction activity with a low overpotential of 281mV at 10mAcm(-2) and is also stable for up to around 17h in an alkaline electrolyte; the catalyst also demonstrates a high efficiency for overall water splitting. Our strategy has, therefore, great potential for practical energy conversion applications.									24	3	0	0	0	0	24			2196-0216			WOS:000471342200017

Here, we demonstrate a robust reduced Fe-oxide@NiCo2O4 bilayered non-precious-metal oxide composite as a highly efficient OER catalyst in an alkaline medium. A bilayered oxide composite film with an interconnected nanoflake morphology (Fe2O3@NiCo2O4) is reduced in an aqueous NaBH4 solution, which results in a mosslike Fe3O4@NiCo2O4 (reduced Fe-oxide@NiCo2O4; rFNCO) nanostructured film with an enhanced electrochemical surface area. The rFNCO film demonstrates an outstanding OER activity with an extraordinary low overpotential of 189 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (246 mV at 100 mA cm(-2)) and a remarkably small Tafel slope of 32 mV dec(-1). The film also shows excellent durability for more than 50 h of continuous operation, even at 100 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, density functional theory calculations suggest that the unintentionally in situ doped Ni during the reduction reaction possibly improves the OER performance of the rFNCO catalyst shifting d-band centers of both Fe and Ni active sites.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000726631400001	34730925

Transition metal phosphides have been identified as promising dual functional catalysts recently. Herein, we report a facile strategy to construct a heterostructure catalyst by integrating cobalt phosphide with molybdenum carbide (MXene). The CoP/Mo2CTx (T is the surface terminal group) catalyst exhibited good HER activity with an overpotential of 78 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), close to that of the Pt/C benchmark, and its OER performance is markedly better than that of the RuO2 benchmark, evidenced by a very small overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. Impressively, when employed for overall water splitting, CoP/Mo2CTx also outperformed the Pt/C + RuO2 combination with a voltage of 1.56 V @ 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that CoP/Mo2CTx has appropriate water adsorption especially the optimal H* adsorption free energy (Delta G(H*)), and the Mo2C MXene support can significantly increase the total density of states and downshift the d-band center for the HER, while for the OER, multiple characterization techniques of CoP/Mo2CTx post the OER test show that CoP in the catalyst can be transformed into Co-OOH during the electrocatalytic process. This study can provide a pathway for the design and fabrication of MXene-supported noble-metal-free bifunctional catalysts toward practical water splitting and energy conversion.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000693800100001

This large effect is due to the efficiency of the neutral O-18 + NO, O-18 + SO, and O-18 + O-2 exchange reactions. The modelling results were compared to new and existing observed isotopic ratios in a selection of cold cores. The good agreement between model and observations requires that the gas-phase abundance of neutral oxygen atoms is large in the observed regions. The (SO)-O-16/(SO)-O-18 ratio is predicted to vary substantially over time, showing that it can be used as a sensitive chemical proxy for matter evolution in dense molecular clouds.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000474880400098	31427830

In addition, the optimal molar ratio of the TA, Fe3+, and Ni2+ ions for synthesis of Fe-Ni ANC@NSCA catalysts are 1:2:5, which can guarantee the formation of carbon aerogel composed of quasi-2D porous carbon sheets and the formation of high-density Fe-Ni ANCs with an ultrasmall size between 2 to 2.8 nm. These Fe-Ni ANCs consisting of N-4-Fe-O-Ni-N-4 moiety are proposed as a new type of active species for the first time, to the best of the authors' knowledge. Thanks to their unique features, the Fe-Ni ANC@NSCA catalysts show excellent performance in oxygen reduction reaction with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.891 V and oxygen evolution reaction (260 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline media as bifunctional catalysts, which are better than the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalysts and RuO2 catalysts.

Here, some facets of the role of trace level of impurities (from 10(-7) to 10(-6) M) in electrocatalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions, and CO oxidation reactions are explored on well-characterized platinum single crystal surfaces and high surface area materials in alkaline and acidic environments. Of particular interest is the effect of anions (e.g., Cl-, NO3-) and cations (i.e., Cu2+) present in the supporting electrolytes as well as surface defects (i.e., ad-islands) that are present on metal surfaces. The examples presented are chosen to demonstrate that a small level of impurities may play a crucial role in governing the reactivity of electrochemical interfaces.									21	1	0	0	2	0	21			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000363941200004

The state-of-the-artcatalysts suffer from poor water splitting activity in alkaline mediadue to their sluggish kinetics, high cost, and scarcity on earth to bescaled up. Herein, we present an electrochemical analysis of ananostructured electrocatalyst based on a face-centered cubic(FCC) copper-rich Cu-Ni-Fe-Cr-Co alloy with a quasi-spherical morphology electrodeposited on a highly porous nickelsubstrate. Electrochemical studies determine the enhanced electro-catalytic activity toward both hydrogen and oxygen reactions in analkaline medium, which has been induced by the synergistic effectof alloy metals. It is shown that the performance of the presentedelectrocatalyst for both the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogenevolution reaction is superior to the recently reported electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Benefiting from its long-termdurability, the material can pave the way to developing high-performance electrocatalysts for full electrochemical water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000793737800028

High performance electrode is the key determinant of SSOCs. Herein, a multifunctional perovskite oxide La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3-delta (LCaFN) is investigated as electrode for SSOCs. The results confirm that LCaFN shows excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2-RR) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalytic activity. In SOFC mode, the SSOCs with LCaFN achieve good electrochemical performance with maximum power density of 300 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. For pure CO2 electrolysis in SOEC mode, polarization resistance of 0.055 Omega cm(2) and current density of 1.5 A cm(-2) are achieved at 2.0 V at 800 degrees C. Besides, the cell shows excellent stability both in SOFC mode and SOEC mode. Most importantly, SSOCs with symmetrical LCaFN electrodes show robust and regenerative performance under anodic or cathodic process during the switching gas, showing the great reliability of the SSOCs. The results show that this novel electrode offers a promising strategy for operation of SSOCs.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000573569400002

However, comparisons of the electrochemical performance of these materials have been challenging due to the different methods of attachment, catalyst loadings, and electrochemical test conditions reported in the literature. Herein, we have leveraged a conventional drop-casting method that allows for the successful adhesion of a wide range of nanoparticulate catalysts to glassy-carbon electrode surfaces. We have applied this adhesion method to prepare catalyst films from 16 crystalline metal-oxide nanoparticles with a constant loading of 0.8 mg cm(-2), and evaluated the resulting nanoparticulate films for the oxygen evolution reaction under conditions relevant to an integrated solar fuels device. In general, the activities of the adhered nanoparticulate films are similar to those of thin-film catalysts prepared by electrodeposition or sputtering, achieving 10 mA cm(-2) current densities per geometric area at overpotentials of similar to 0.35-0.5 V.									369	7	0	0	11	0	369			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000371077300034

This lithium oxide can be converted to insulating lithium peroxide via two different pathways: a second reduction at the cathode surface or disproportionation in solution. The latter process is known to be advantageous with regard to increasing the discharge capacity and is promoted by a high donor number electrolyte because of the stability of lithium oxide in media of this type. Herein, we report that the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction during discharge typically exhibits negative differential resistance. Importantly, the magnitude of negative differential resistance, which varies with the system component, and the position of the cathode potential relative to the negative differential resistance determined the reaction pathway and the discharge capacity. This result implies that the stability of lithium oxide on the cathode also contributes to the determination of the reaction pathway.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			2041-1723			WOS:000457749000005	30723201

Herein, as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts toward the water-splitting process, the desirable cobalt phospho-sulfide (CoPS) nanosheets stem from Co2+ cross-linking to form strong coordination bonds with negatively charged oxygen-containing functional groups on a graphene oxide (GO) sacrificial template via electrostatic interactions. The prepared CoPS catalyst exhibits a distinguished electrochemical performance with a low overpotential (eta) of hydrogen evolution reaction (similar to 52 mV) and oxygen evolution reaction (similar to 280.7 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) and better durability and higher turnover frequencies under alkaline environments. When it was used as the cathode and anode in alkaline media, the CoPS required only 1.62 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming most of the low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. The bond energy of the P=S bond not only effectively adsorb protons but also suitably weakens the adsorption on the Co-Co bridge site, thereby improving the multifunctional electrocatalysis for water splitting. The excellent performance of porous and ultrathin CoPS nanosheets is conducive to the complete exposure of active sites and facile ion transport kinetics, and they serve as a promising non-precious-metal-based electrocatalysts for the water-splitting reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000711236300058

These catalysts are generally synthesized by solution-based methods. We present an in situ synthesis method for NiFe-based OER catalysts through a laser induced graphene (LIG)-assisted process. By loading the metal precursor on a preformed LIG surface followed by laser scribing, we synthesized the NiFe/LIG catalysts via a solid phase transition that did not require utilization of CVD or typical solution-based reactions. The catalysts showed high OER activity and durability. The overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) is as low as 240 mV with a Tafel slope of 32.8 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. Additionally, this method worked well on a carbon fiber paper substrate, providing a convenient approach for the preparation of a free-standing catalytic electrode. This method provides a potential route to the facile synthesis of a variety of catalysts on a conductive surface.									68	3	0	0	5	0	70			2380-8195			WOS:000427444300026

To overcome such challenges, an innovative vapor phased iron-doping strategy is employed on carbon nanotubes (CNT)-interlinked metalorganic framework (MOF) nanosheets (Ni-MOF@CNT) to obtain mixed metal oxide and metal heteronanoparticles superficially implanted partially (semi)-decomposed MOF nanosheets (Ni-M@C-400). These semi-MOF nanosheets attain the structural privileges related to MOF-nanostructure, mixed metal nanoparticles synergism, interconnected-CNT assisted high conductivity, and mechanical strength. As a result, Ni-M@C-400 exhibits exceptional OER activity with overpotential as low as 229 mV to reach the benchmark current density of 10 mA/cm(2) (eta(10)) and exhibits greatly reduced thermodynamic barrier (Tafel slopes of 40.51 mV/dec) along with significant durability for similar to 60 h. More importantly, this sublimated iron-doped semi-MOF (Ni-M@C-400) displays significantly better OER performance over the corresponding annealed bimetallic MOF (NiFe-M@C-400: 270 mV at eta(10)). Moreover, the successful incorporation of vapor phased iron into variety of MOFs (Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu) approved its uniqueness and the universality. This work provides an innovative vapor phased heteroatom-doping strategy to develop cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts for water electrolysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000780656600002

First, a thin layer of surface copper atoms of the foil was converted to gamma-CuBr nanocorals (NCs) by dissolution and in situ deposition in a bromide medium. Then, the CuBr NCs were doped with Co utilizing the high ionic mobility of Cu+ in the gamma-CuBr structure through cation exchange and dissolution reactions. During the Co-doping process, the surface gamma-CuBr was converted to Cu2O, leading to the formation of CuBr/Co@Cu2O NCs. CuBr/Co@Cu2O NCs were then converted to CuBr/Co@CuO hollow NCs (h-NCs), with high surface roughness and high stability by three linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) scans in O-2-saturated KOH solution (0.1 M) over a potential range of 1.2-1.7 V (vs RHE). The h-NC was not formed without Co-doping of gamma-CuBr. The as-formed CuBr/Co@CuO h-NCs exhibit an overpotential of 270 mV with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 66 mV dec(-1) for OER as a result of having high electrochemically active surface area and synergistic catalytic Co and CuBr@CuO nanostructures.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2168-0485			WOS:000548456600021

Herein, a cobalt-containing metal-organic framework using adenine as a ligand was synthesized and pyrolyzed without any other precursors, forming a cobalt nanoparticle-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon/carbon nanotube framework (Co@N-CNTF). Due to the abundant active sites of homogeneously distributed cobalt nanoparticles within nitrogen-doped graphitic layers, the resultant Co@N-CNTF catalysts exhibit an efficient and stable electrocatalytic performance as a tri-functional catalyst towards the ORR, OER and HER, including a high half-wave potential of 0.81 V vs. RHE for the ORR, and a low overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER (0.35 V) and HER (0.22 V). As a proof-ofconcept, the Co@N-CNTF as an OER/HER bifunctional catalyst for full water splitting affords an alkaline electrolyzer with 10 mA cm(-2) under a stable voltage of 1.71 V. Moreover, an integrated unit of a watersplitting electrolyzer using the Co@N-CNTF catalysts, which is powered with a rechargeable Zn-air battery using the Co@N-CNTF as an ORR/OER bifunctional catalyst on air electrodes, can operate under ambient conditions with high cycling stability, demonstrating the viability and efficiency of the selfpowered water-splitting system.									174	7	0	0	9	0	175			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000459331600017

The comprehensive electrocatalytic understanding of nickel selenides possessing a scenario of more than one phase requires special attention for exploiting novel bifunctional electrocatalytic activity. In this report, we propose and develop two series of in-situ grown nickel selenide phases, NiSe2 and Ni0.95Se, supported on nickel foam (NSNF) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for alkaline water electrolysis applications. The NSNF with a well-controlled uniform particle growth orientation provides a favorable active catalytic surface to deliver an exceptional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a 1 M of KOH electrolyte solution. The half-cell performance of the optimized NSNF electrode has been demonstrated to possess the following characteristics: In the HER evaluation, the achieved overpotential values of 175, 276, and 338 mV for 10, 50, and 200 mAcm(-2), respectively; In the OER evaluation, the observed overpotential value of 325 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) which outperformed the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst. Moreover, the alkaline water electrolysis cell demonstration using the optimized NSNF electrocatalyst as a bifunctional electrode exhibits an energy efficiency of 79% as well as a steady alkaline water-splitting process of 17 h at a current density of 50 mAcm(-2).

The development of high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts that could simultaneously catalyze the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can simplify the overall water electrolyser system design and is highly desired but full of great challenges. Due to the sluggish kinetics of the OER, iridium (Ir)-based catalysts with high intrinsic activity, stability and a wide pH window of the OER are ideal materials for bifunctional catalysts. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on Ir-based HER/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts (Ir-BEs) for overall water splitting. We focus on the composition optimization and morphology optimization in enhancing the overall water splitting performance of Ir-BEs, highlighting the fundamental understanding of the key factors that contribute to the performance improvements, including the structure of surface active sites, metal-support interaction, synergistic effect, electronic/geometric effects, etc. Finally, the current challenges faced and outlook are provided for guiding the rational deign of advanced Ir-BEs for overall water splitting.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000659225400001

The treatment led to modifications in the oxides properties, such as reduction of the particle size, increase of surface area and partial reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+ for the Mn(IV) oxides, or of Mn3+ to Mn2+ for Mn2O3, because of favored interactions of the organic molecules with the lattice planes with higher d spacing. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) tests showed the superior catalytic activity of the treated Mn(IV) oxides, for instance alpha,gamma-MnO2-en presented TOF five times higher than pure alpha,gamma-MnO2. The increase in surface area as well as the higher Mn3+ content caused by the treatment of the Mn(IV) oxides were correlated with the improvement in the OER catalytic activity.

Subsequently, SECM was spe-cifically introduced to investigate the local reactivity and conductivity of the CNT samples at submicrometer scale.

This is particularly true in Li-O-2 batteries which represent a very harsh environment mainly because of the formation, upon cycling, of very aggressive superoxide radicals. In such batteries, the use of catalyst in the cathode formulation is quite usual to help oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR and OER) to proceed rapidly and reversibly. However, the slightest binder degradation upon cycling can hinder the catalyst effects dramatically, modifying them to act on other reactions associated with the generated side-products, thus deteriorating cell performances and preventing researchers from drawing the right conclusions about catalytic properties of new materials. In this work, the influence of different catalysts in the degradation of the PVDF binder, on the performance of Li-O-2 batteries, was investigated. The results obtained were compared with the ones of cathodes prepared with the same catalysts but Li-Nafion binder instead (already reported as stable), to further demonstrate that the choice of binder must be strongly linked to the nature of the catalyst. The catalysts employed for this study were alpha-MnO2, and commercial Co3O4, and Co phthalocyanines (CoPc).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000495983900002

Due to the complexity of the multiphase interface, it is still a great challenge to capture gas evolution dynamics under operando conditions to precisely portray the intrinsic catalytic performance of the interface. Here, we establish a single particle imaging method to real-time monitor a potential-dependent vertical motion or hopping of electrocatalysts induced by electrogenerated gas nanobubbles. The hopping feature of a single particle is closely correlated with intrinsic activities of electrocatalysts and thus is developed as an indicator to evaluate gas evolution performance of various electrocatalysts. This optical indicator diminishes interference from heterogeneous morphologies, non-Faradaic processes, and parasitic side reactions that are unavoidable in conventional electrochemical measurements, therefore enabling precise evaluation and high-throughput screening of catalysts for gas evolution systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000820324400001	35727011

The value of double-layer capacitance for Co9S8/Ni3S2 is detected to be 81.4 m F.cm(-2), which is four times more than the precursor (NixCo1-x(CO3)(0.5)OH). This enhancement greatly produces a large number of catalytic reaction sites for contacting with electrolyte ions. The method of in-situ vulcanization growth urges the uniform distribution of Co9S8 and Ni3S2, forming a large number of lattice defects in the heterointerfaces. These lattice defects modulate the local electronic arrangement to become the most active reaction sites. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the defective heterointerfaces are beneficial to the chemisorption of H+ and OH-. Electrochemical tests illustrate that Co9S8/Ni3S2 electrodes exhibit efficient activities for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions and have remarkable stabilities in alkaline solution for commercial application.									98	5	0	0	4	0	100			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000469904500027

Solvent is modeled by explicit nondissociated water molecules, and their structure is determined by a global optimization method. We find that the inclusion of an explicit solvent can significantly affect the geometry of adsorbed intermediates, changing from an interaction with the surface to an interaction with the water bilayer. These water structures consist of stacked octagonal sheets in an ordered network. Solvent stabilization is pronounced for adsorbed *OH and *OOH, which are capable of donating hydrogen bonds. We find little to no change in adsorbate binding energy as the number of layers of solvent is increased from 1 to 3, suggesting a single water bilayer is sufficient to describe the system. With either *O or *OH coadsorbates, the energetics of the reaction pathway with the are relatively unchanged inclusion of explicit solvent.									127	3	0	0	13	0	127			1932-7447			WOS:000402775200049

Conventionally, metal phosphides or metal sulfides are active for HER, their OER activity is relatively poor. Herein, we have precisely prepared quaternary (NiFe)PS3 nanosheets as ultra-effective OER catalysts via a one-step sulfurization and phosphorization method with NiFe prussian blue analogues as precursors. The systematic results demonstrate that the coexistence of PBA, P and S sources is the keypoint for the nanosheet structure. The (NiFe)PS3 nanosheets show very good OER activity with a super-low overpotential (223 mV) to reach 10 mA cm(-2). However, from the energy diagrams, we find that the basal plane of (NiFe)PS3 is almost inert to OER due to the prohibitively high theoretical overpotential of 1.50 V, derives from the weak binding of OH* and OOH* intermediates, and only unsaturated Fe and Ni atoms locate on the (010) plane of (NiFe)PS3 are active for OER. The further ex situ characterizations demonstrate that the in-situ electrochemically formed oxohydroxide layer on the nanosheets contributes significantly to the OER actvity. This work not only provides a simple method to synthesize quaternary bimetallic phosphosulphide nanosheets, but also provides a deep understanding on the origin of the high activity of (NiFe)PS3 nanosheets.									73	6	0	0	3	0	73			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000449446100011

Utilization of metal/semiconductor interface effect has been lately established as a viable implementation to realize the favorable electrocatalytic performance due to the built-in electric field. Herein, a typical Mott-Schottky electrocatalyst by immobilizing Ni/CeO2 hetero-nanoparticles onto N-doped carbon nanofibers (abbreviated as Ni/CeO2@N-CNFs hereafter) has been developed via a feasible electrospinning-carbonization tactic. Experimental findings and theoretic calculations substantiate that the elaborated constructed Ni/CeO2 heterojunction effectively triggers the self-driven charge transfer on heterointerfaces, leading to the promoted charge transfer rate, the optimized chemisorption energies for reaction intermediates and ultimately the expedited reaction kinetics. Therefore, the well-designed Ni/CeO2@N-CNFs deliver superior HER and OER catalytic activities with overpotentials of 100 and 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, in alkaline solution. Furthermore, the Ni/CeO2@N-CNFs-equipped electrolyzer also exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.56 V to attain 10 mA cm(-2) and impressive long-term durability over 55 h. The innovative manipulation of electronic modulation via Mott-Schottky establishment may inspire the future development of economical electrocatalysts for diverse sustainable energy systems.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000751398900001	35122468

Biomass -derived biochar has been considered as promising carbon material because of its advan-tages such as low-cost, renewable, simple preparation, rich structure, and easy to obtain heteroatom by in-situ doping. Herein, Ni2P-Fe2P bimetallic phosphide spherical nanocages encapsulated in N/P-doped pine needles biochar is prepared via a simple two-step pyrolysis method. Benefiting from the maximum synergistic effects of bimetallic phosphide and biochar, high conductivity of biochar encapsulation, highly exposed active sites of Ni2P-Fe2P spherical nanocages, rapid mass transfer in porous channels with large specific surface area, and the promotion in adsorption of reaction intermediates by high-level heteroatom doping, the (Ni0.75Fe0.25)2P@NP/C demonstrates excellent OER activity with an overpotential of 250 mV and a Tafel slope of 48 mV/dec at 10 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH. Also it exhibits a long-term durability in 10 h electrolysis and its activity even improves during the electrocatalytic process. The present work provides a favorable strategy for the inexpensive synthesis of biochar-based transition metal electrocatalysts toward OER, and improves the water electrolysis for hydrogen production.

While developing new catalysts is important, tuning the electronic structure of existing catalysts over a wide electrochemical potential range can also offer a new direction. Here we demonstrate a method for electrochemical lithium tuning of catalytic materials in organic electrolyte for subsequent enhancement of the catalytic activity in aqueous solution. By continuously extracting lithium ions out of LiCoO2, a popular cathode material in lithium ion batteries, to Li0.5CoO2 in organic electrolyte, the catalytic activity is significantly improved. This enhancement is ascribed to the unique electronic structure after the delithiation process. The general efficacy of this methodology is demonstrated in several mixed metal oxides with similar improvements. The electrochemically delithiated LiCo0.33Ni0.33Fe0.33O2 exhibits a notable performance, better than the benchmark iridium/carbon catalyst.									388	17	0	0	32	0	389			2041-1723			WOS:000340615500036	24993836

NiFeOx catalysts were grown on both Au(111) and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) electrodes. DFT predicted Fe edge-site atoms at the NiFeOx/Au(111) interface to be the most thermodynamically favorable reaction center, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy data indicated small NiFeOx catalyst particles on Au(111) contained a high population of OER active Fe edge-site atoms. However, restructuring of the Au(111) surface due to repeated oxidation and reduction cycles of the OER CV measurements encapsulated small NiFeOx nanoparticles at catalyst loadings below similar to 1.5 nmolmetal/cm(2), passivated catalyst edges and reduced bulk OER activity of Au-supported NiFeOx compared with HOPG-supported ones. Analysis of intrinsic activity revealed that the Au(111) support strongly benefited electrochemically accessible NiFeOx atoms, and we observed a 2-3 fold activity enhancement compared with HOPG-supported catalysts for loadings above similar to 1 nmolmetal/cm(2). Evaluating bulk vs intrinsic activity and identifying loading/coverage-dependent support effects is important for accurately probing fundamental interfacial chemistry, choosing suitable catalyst loadings and supports, and optimizing system parameters to maximize the performance of electrocatalyst systems.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200008

These hollow spheres were examined as electrocatalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using the rotating disk electrode technique in an alkaline solution. The obtained mass-specific OER activity was 7.51 A/g for porous LaCoO3 particles and 12.58 A/g for hollow LaCoO3 nanospheres at 1.60 V. These values were more than 4-6 times higher than that of bulk LaCoO3 compound (1.87 A/g). The OER performance of these perovskite-type LaCoO3 compounds was characterized using the Tafel equation, which showed the hollow nanospheres had the fastest kinetics among the three morphologies. The amorphous surface of these porous structures could contribute to the enhanced OER performance. The electrocatalytic and structural analysis results show the porous nanostructures with amorphous surface layers are important to achieve high activity toward OER for water splitting.									56	3	0	0	2	1	59			2168-0485			WOS:000414825900150

Recently, hydrogen evolution reaction is attracting more and more attention due to the energy crisis and environment pollution. Herein, we successfully synthesize polyallylamine-functionalized rhodium nanosheet nanoassemblies-carbon nanotube nanohybrids via a facile one-pot hydrothermal method. Three-dimensionally branched rhodium nanosheet nanoassemblies are consisted of two dimensionally atomically thick ultrathin rhodium nanosheets. The as -prepared polyallylamine-functionalized rhodium nanosheet nanoassemblies-carbon nanotube nanohybrids show the excellent electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic media, with a low onset reduction potential of -1 mV, a small overpotential of 5 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is much superior to commercial platinum nanocrystals. Two dimensionally ultrathin morphology of rhodium nanosheet, particular rhodium-polyallylamine interface, and three-dimensionally networks induced by carbon nanotube are the key factors for the excellent hydrogen evolution reaction activity in acidic media.									34	0	0	0	1	0	34			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000430779400005

Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a Co/CoO/Co3O4 heterostructure embedded in a porous carbon matrix by refluxing and annealing. This composite exhibits several structural merits for catalyzing the ORR: (1) the existence of metallic Co and graphitic carbon enhanced the electrical conduction; (2) the porous, Loose carbon network facilitated the electrolyte permeation and mass transport; (3) more importantly, the nanosized coherent CoO/Co3O4 heterojunctions with structural defects and oxygen vacancies enhanced the charge transport/separation at the interface and adsorption affinity to O-2, thus promoting the ORR kinetics and Lowering the reaction barrier. Consequently, the composite electrode manifests high electrocatalytic activity, attaining a current density of 6.7 mA cm(-2) at -0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), which is superior to pure CoO nanoparticles (4.7 mA cm(-2)), and has good methanol tolerance.

Although conventional NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) shows excellent performance for alkaline oxygen evolution reactions (OERs), it shows extremely poor activity toward hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) due to weak hydrogen adsorption and sluggish kinetics. In this work, integration of sub-nanoscale Ru species with NiFe LDH can dramatically enhance the adsorption energy of H* and improve their HER kinetics. Besides, benefitting from the desired potential-induced strategy, the Ru-NiFe LDH interfaces will convert to RuO2-NiFe(OOH)(x) interfaces to optimize the adsorption energy of OH* to meet the requirement of strengthening the OER performance. Strikingly, the Ru-NiFe LDH-F/NF sample (NF: Ni foam) shows an excellent OER and HER performance with an overpotential of 230.0 mV and 115.6 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, as well as outstanding durability. The overall water splitting device was fabricated by using Ru/NiFe LDH-F/NF as both the HER and OER electrode with a potential of 1.53 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, the theoretical calculations demonstrated that the Ru-NiFe LDH interfaces could optimize the adsorption energy of H* and OH*. This study provides a new insight into the development of highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for water electrolysis.									37	4	0	0	1	0	39			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000534337900031	32319487

However, the electrochemical performances of the various systems are limited, and there is an intensive search for highly efficient electrocatalysts by more rational control over the size, shape, composition, and structure. Of particular interest are the studies on single-atom catalysts (SACs), which have sparked new interests in electrocatalysis because of their high catalytic activity, stability, selectivity, and 100% atom utilization. In this Review, we introduce innovative syntheses and characterization techniques for SACs, with a focus on their electrochemical applications in the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and hydrocarbon conversion reactions for fuel cells (electrooxidation of methanol, ethanol, and formic acid). The electrocatalytic performance is further considered at an atomic level and the underlying mechanisms are discussed. The ultimate goal is the tailoring of single atoms for electrochemical applications.									766	62	0	0	46	0	775			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000413896400005	28544221

Based on this design principle, in this study, we start with a B-site ordered double perovskite Sr2FeMoO6- with poor OER activity as the host material to fulfill the requirement of a short pathway, and then, replace Mo with Ni and Fe with Co to optimize the synergistic interplay of the multi-active sites. Replacing Mo with Ni indeed dramatically enhances the OER activity and structural/operating stability. Further improvement in OER performance is realized by partial substitution of Fe with Co, leading to the development of a material with the nominal composition of Sr2Fe0.8Co0.2Mo0.65Ni0.35O6-, which outperforms the noble metal oxide IrO2 and is better than most of the electrocatalysts developed based on a single descriptor, such as Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3- (e(g) occupancy close to unity), PrBaCo2O5+ (O 2p-band center relative to the Fermi level), and La0.5Sr0.5CoO3- (charge-transfer energy) in many aspects. As a universal method, combined structural and compositional tuning to create a cooperative effect among different active sites for intermediate adsorption and reaction in an ordered structure may provide a new way for the design of superior electrocatalysts for various applications.									42	1	0	0	1	0	41			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000467249200051

The fabricated catalyst exhibits significant hydrogen evolution reaction activity and stability in the alkaline solution, with an overpotential of -196 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the TOF value of CNT/Pt-Ni catalyst is 2.1 times greater than the incumbent commercial Pt/C catalyst (at the overpotential of -300 mV), demonstrating it as a promising electrocatalyst for water splitting reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0366-7022	1348-0715		WOS:000835311100001

The water photooxidation reaction (i.e., oxygen evolution reaction) accompanies three other kinds of side reactions (photoluminescence (PL), surface roughening, and nonradiative recombination). These reactions are competitive with each other, and the ratio of their quantum efficiencies strongly depends on the atomic-scale surface local structure. This Perspective focuses on the atomic-scale surface local structure dependence of those four kinds of competitive reactions on a TiO2 (rutile) single-crystal electrode on which not only a terrace structure but also step structures were strictly controlled. The experimental results are discussed based on the reaction model of water photocoddation that we previously proposed. The photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 surface roughened by the photoinduced roughening process is also focused on.									19	1	0	0	2	0	20			1948-7185			WOS:000337870100010	26270500

Herein, we report a simple strategy to controllably synthesize pure RuP and RuP2 and evaluate their HER performances in all pH range. Different from other transition metal phosphides, the HER performance of the RuP, in all pH range obviously improves as the phosphorus content decreases. By systematic research, it has been found that the RuP-475 with more Ru had much better conductivity and more catalytically active sites than the P rich RuP2-550. In addition, the RuP-475 exhibits excellent HER performance with small overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (46, 47, 22 mV in pH 0, 7, and 14, respectively).									60	6	0	0	2	0	63			2168-0485			WOS:000431927500080

Herein, for the first time, we have proposed an efficient strategy to synthesize Co-Fe bimetallic PBA nanosheet arrays with ultrathin feature and open bimetal centers via one-pot coprecipitation reaction of nickel nitrate and sodium nitroferricyanide in the presence of nickel foam. When employed as the self-supporting bifunctional electrocatalyst, the optimized PBA nanosheet arrays require overpotentials of only 256 and 48 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Remarkably, it allows an alkali-electrolyzer with 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.545 V and a robust operation stability of no less than 36 h. The combination of experimental results and theoretical calculation analysis unravelled that such exceptional electrocatalytic performances could be traced to the ultrathin nanosheet, porous surface structure, and coordinately unsaturated metal centers, enabling abundant active sites, accelerated mass/charge transfer capability, as well as the favorable energy for their transformation to high active Co/Fe-based (oxy)hydroxides during water electrolysis. More broadly, the synthetic strategy is versatile and can be applied to achieve copper foam- and titanium foam-supported bifunctional CoFe-PBA nanosheet electrocatalysts.									68	0	0	0	6	0	68			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000513811800076

Here we use chemoinformatic methods to explore the impact of the rise of oxygen on metabolic evolution. We undertake a comprehensive comparative analysis of structures, chemical properties and chemical reactions of anaerobic and aerobic metabolites. The results indicate that aerobic metabolism has expanded the structural and chemical space of metabolites considerably, including the appearance of 130 novel molecular scaffolds. The molecular functions of these metabolites are mainly associated with derived aspects of cellular life, such as signal transfer, defense against biotic factors, and protection of organisms from oxidation. Moreover, aerobic metabolites are more hydrophobic and rigid than anaerobic compounds, suggesting they are better fit to modulate membrane functions and to serve as transmembrane signaling factors. Since higher organisms depend largely on sophisticated membrane-enabled functions and intercellular signaling systems, the metabolic developments brought about by oxygen benefit the diversity of cellular makeup and the complexity of cellular organization as well. These findings enhance our understanding of the molecular link between oxygen and evolution. They also show the significance of chemoinformatics in addressing basic biological questions.									18	1	0	0	14	0	20			1553-734X	1553-7358		WOS:000302244000034	22438800

However, this strategy requires developing a support that is electronically conductive, is stable in OER conditions, features a large specific surface area and a porosity adapted to gas-liquid flows. To address these challenges, we synthesized IrOx nanoparticles, supported them on doped SnO2 aerogels (IrOx/doped SnO2), and assessed their electrocatalytic activity toward the OER and their resistance to corrosion in acidic media by means of a flow cell connected to an inductively coupled mass spectrometer (FC-ICP-MS). The FC-ICP-MS results show that the long-term OER activity of IrOx/doped SnO2 aerogels is controlled by the resistance to corrosion of the doping element, and by its concentration in the host SnO2 matrix. In particular, we provide quantitative evidence that Sb-doped SnO2 supports continuously dissolve while Ta-doped or Nb-doped SnO2 supports with appropriate doping concentrations are stable under acidic OER conditions. These results shed fundamental light on the complex equilibrium existing between SnO2 and the doping element oxide. They also open a reliable path to develop highly active and robust IrOx nanocatalysts for OER in acidic media.									24	1	0	0	1	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800028

A biomimetic model catalyst, comprising a mu-OH bridged Mn(III-V) dimer truncated by acetylacetonate ligand analogs and hydroxides is employed. The reaction cycle is divided into four electrochemical hydrogen abstraction steps followed by a series of chemical steps. The former employ the tyrosine/tyrosyl redox couple acting as electron and proton sink, thus determining the reference potential. Stripping hydrogen from water leads to the formation of two highly unstable Mn(V)=O/Mn(IV)-O-center dot moieties, which subsequently combine to form a mu-peroxy O-O bond. O-2 evolution results from subsequent consecutive replacement of the remaining Mn-O bonds by water. A Zener "spintronic" type mechanism for virtually barrierless O-2 evolution is found. The applicability of DFT is discussed and extended to include the rate-limiting steps in the OER. Rather than attempting to compute transition states where KS-DFT is unreliable, an upper bound for the activation barrier of the O-O bond formation step is estimated from the hessians of the relevant intermediates.									53	0	0	0	3	0	53			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000293860500028	21773630

FeNi bimetal electrocatalysts have been reported to have good activities toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but negligible oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Herein, we report an advanced multifunctional electrocatalyst based on 7.6 nm FeNi3N nanoparticles anchored on N-doped graphene (FeNi3N/NG). The as-prepared FeNi3N/NG exhibits not only excellent OER and HER activities, but also unprecedented ORR activity in alkaline media. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that FeNi3N with an active (110) surface has stronger capability for O-2 adsorption and cleavage of the O-O bond than Ni4N, leading to significantly enhanced ORR activity of the FeNi3N nanoparticles. As a result, the specific capacity of the primary FeNi3N/NG-based Zn-air battery is as high as 785.2 mA h g(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2), higher than that assembled with a benchmarked Pt/C + IrO2 catalyst. Besides, the overall water splitting device with the FeNi3N/NG electrode material delivers 20 mA cm(-2) at 1.585 V, outperforming electrolyzers assembled with the state-of-the-art bifunctional catalysts. Our results highlight the importance of the fabrication of ultrasmall-sized electrocatalysts with an exposed active surface to the development of renewable energy conversion and storage devices.									74	8	0	0	3	0	75			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000457268300020

Herein we present an economical approach for the synthesis of self-standing cobalt nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on carbon nanotube-grafted multichannel carbon fibers, co-doped with nitrogen and sulfur (Co@ NS/CNT-MCFs), which exhibit comparable ORR (OER) activity to that of commercial Pt/C (RuO2) catalysts in terms of a half-wave potential of 0.837 V for the ORR, and a mere 362 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER, as well as remarkable stability in an alkaline medium. The excellent electrocatalytic properties can be attributed to the hierarchically porous network structure and multiple heteroatom dopants introduced, which favor efficient reagent/product mass transport, in addition to providing a great number of active sites. As a proof of concept, the designed flexible catalysts are also employed as air cathodes in an assembled lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) cell with high specific capacity and outstanding operational durability. These results demonstrate the potential of this novel approach in developing suitable catalysts to enable the next generation of metal-air batteries.									103	1	0	0	9	0	103			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000396146900024

The most effective catalysts for the OER are solubilized redox mediators that may be oxidized at relatively low potentials, but still capable of oxidizing Li2O2 back to molecular oxygen. Since for the effective and long-term utilization of redox mediators in lithium-oxygen cells a clear evaluation of their stability is essential, we have developed a useful methodology for that purpose. This revealed, quite surprisingly, that most commonly used redox mediators are unstable in lithium-oxygen cells, even under argon atmosphere and without being in contact with Li anodes. Using the abovementioned methodology for evaluating efficiency, we now introduce corrole-chelated metal complexes as stable redox mediators in lithium oxygen batteries. This was achieved by taking advantage of the facile methods for introducing changes in the corrole ligands and by choosing properly the central transition metal cation, two aspects that allow for adjusting the redox properties of the metal complexes for theoperative voltage window. Weoutline further directions and believe that this work will promote optimized selection of redox mediators for lithium-oxygen batteries.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000518381300022

The Au Ni alloy NPs/rGO nanocomposites display excellent electrocatalytic activity which is found to improve with increasing Ni content in the Au Ni/rGO alloy nanocomposites. For HER, the best Au Ni alloy NPs/rGO electrocatalyst, the one with the highest Ni content, exhibits high activity with an onset overpotential approaching zero versus the reversible hydrogen electrode and an overpotential of only 37 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Additionally, a low Tafel slope of 33 mV dec(-1) and a high exchange current density of 0.6 mA cm(-2) are measured which are very close to those of commercial Pt/C catalyst. Also, in the ORR tests, this electrocatalyst displays comparable activity to Pt/C. The Koutecky Levich plots referred to a 4 electron mechanism for the reduction of dissolved O-2 on the Au Ni alloy NPs/rGO catalyst. The electrocatalyst thus demonstrates excellent activity towards HER and ORR. Additionally, it exhibits outstanding operational durability and activation after 10,000th cycles assuring its practical applicability. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

To reduce the energy barrier, herein, we adopt a facile in-situ surface modification strategy to develop a low-cost and efficient electrocatalyst for water splitting. The synthesized mulberry-like NiS/Ni nanoparticles exhibit excellent catalytic performance for water splitting. Small overpotentials of 301 and 161 mV are needed to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) accompanying with remarkably low Tafel slopes of 46 and 74 mV dec(-1) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Meanwhile, a robust electrochemical stability is demonstrated. Further high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses reveal that the intrinsic HER activity improvement is attributed to the electron-enriched S on the strongly coupled NiS and Ni interface, which simultaneously facilitates the important electron transfer, consistent with the electrochemical impedance results. The post characterizations demonstrate that surface reconstructed oxyhydroxide contributes to the OER activity and NiS/Ni is an OER precatalyst. This structure construction with in-situ formation of active interface provides an effective way to design efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion.

Herein, an efficient OER catalyst with the solid solution of amorphous Ni2P and Fe2P nanosheets decorated with crystalline Fe3P0$37B0.63 alloy nanoparticles (FePB/NiFeP) is prepared successfully. This amorphous/crystalline composite is synthesized through a simple NaBH4 hydrolysis reaction followed by a high-temperature phosphating process. After hydrolysis of NaBH4, boron is adsorbed on NiFe2O4 precursors in the form of BO2-, and their presence promotes the formation of crystalline FePB alloy nanoparticles and amorphous Ni2P and Fe2P solid solutions. The activated FePB/NiFeP exhibits excellent stability and a superb OER activity of 10 mA cm2 with an overpotential of only 182 mV and a Tafel slope of 43.9 mV/dec, which is superior to most reported transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts. This study provides an idea for the rational design of other advanced amorphous/crystalline interfacial electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2468-6069			WOS:000793276900002

The results show oxygen dissociation is a step-by-step process. The dissociated oxygen atoms can form fcc-fcc or fcc-hcp adsorption structure on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, which is consistent with the results of previous experiments. The Kohn-Sham energy evolutions indicate that the hcp-hcp adsorption structure possesses relatively high energy, and would transform into an fcc-hcp adsorption structure with low energy barrier.

Here, the role played by pyridinic nitrogen-dopants in the chemisorption-based activation of the target reaction is revealed. The study is centered on the monodentate chemisorption of molecular oxygen as the first step of the process. Several configurations of unclustrered nitrogen dopants in which there was always a nitrogen dopant in the edge of the material were tested using DFT. A clearly favorable chemisorbed state for molecular oxygen was found when the pyridinic nitrogen-dopant is hydrogenated and located at an armchair edge. The found chemisorbed state is further favored by additional available charge. By contrast, the chemisorbed state of oxygen is much less favorable when the hydrogenated pyridinic nitrogen-dopants are located at zigzag edges. Moreover, it was found that the charge involved in the hydrogenation of pyridinic nitrogen-dopants remains segregated, becoming available for reduction processes. Detailed reasons for the described facts are given, and an integrated model for the target activation mechanism is proposed including graphitic nitrogen-dopants effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It possesses a subtle orthorhombic -> cubic phase change near room temperature that suppresses Jahn-Teller distortions and presents a unique opportunity to study how atomic structure affects the electronic structure and catalytic activity at a temperature range that is easily accessible in OER/ORR experiments. Previously, we observed that heat-treated alpha-Mn2O3 had a better performance as a bifunctional catalyst in the oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) (Dalton Trans. 2016, 45, 18,494-18,501). We hypothesized that heat-treatment pinned the material into a more electrochemically active cubic phase. In this manuscript, we use high-resolution X-ray diffraction to collect the temperature-dependent structures of alpha-Mn2O3, and then input them into ab initio calculations. The electronic structure calculations indicate that the orthorhombic -> cubic phase transition causes the Mn 3d and O 2p bands to overlap and mix covalently, transforming alpha-Mn2O3 from a semiconductor to a semimetal. This subtle change in structure also modifies Mn-O-Mn bond distances, which may improve the activity of the material in oxygen electrochemistry. OER and ORR experiments were performed using the same electrode at various temperatures. They show a jump in the exchange current density near the phase change temperature, demonstrating the higher activity of the cubic phase.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1468-6996	1878-5514		WOS:000638426200001	33889057

The binding energy of coatings and the diffusion process of oxygen in the melt were simulated, and then the simulation results were compared with the experimental results. The simulation results indicate that for each of the three simulated coatings, inordinate interfacial reactions have occurred between the coating and the melt. The binding energy results show that Y2O3 has the best stability and is the most difficult to break down. ZrO2 has the greatest decomposition energy and is the easiest to break down in the melt. Besides, the molecular dynamics indicate that the diffusion coefficient of the oxygen atom in Al2O3 is larger than that in the other two coatings, indicating that oxygen diffusion in Al2O3 is the fastest at a given temperature. The experimental results show that the oxygen concentration of the melt with Al2O3 coating is the highest, and the oxygen diffusion is of similar magnitude to the simulation values, from which the conclusion can be obtained that the oxygen concentration is significantly influenced by the coating materials.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1672-6421			WOS:000403578900008

Ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy can be used to track surface of a catalyst under a reaction condition as the instrumentations in the last a few decades have made characterization of catalyst surface in a gas phase at Torr pressure or higher possible. It can characterize surface chemistry of a catalyst including surface composition, surface phase and surface oxygen vacancies and other information under a reaction condition and track their evolutions when the reaction condition is changed to another.									10	1	0	0	3	0	10			2211-3398			WOS:000388513000010

Influences of the applied potential and current density on the formation of PANI were investigated. The electrocatalytic effect of Pb electrode modified by PANI on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in sulfuric acid was examined via anodic polarization measurements. The results indicated that a significantly enhanced catalytic activity was obtained on Pb electrodes modified by PANI. The overpotential for OER drops 0.14V similar to 0.42V and the exchange current density rises by one to three orders of magnitude compared to the blank Pb electrode. As a new kind of OER anodes in acidic electrolytes, the Pb electrode coated by PANI shows a potential application prospect in the electrowinning of non-ferrous metals.

Simultaneously, the pathway of xylan decomposition was deduced to illustrate the pyrolysis mechanism. The depolymerization and ring-opening reactions of xylan started at 200 degrees C. After that, it was mainly xylan matrix degradation reaction to form char structure which mainly consisted of phenyl rings and oxygen-containing cyclic compounds with aliphatic chains. With temperature increasing (300-450 degrees C), the decarbonylation reaction, removal of C=C and fatty chains reactions were intensified and the molecular structures of xylan char reconstructed to form fusedring compounds on the order of 1 x 2 and 2 x 2 through condensation. Dehydrogenation and polycondensation reaction of xylan increased at higher temperature (450-600 degrees C). The char structure was composed of high-order fused-ring compounds, and the production of H-2 and CH4 increased greatly.									35	0	0	0	7	0	35			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000514171800063

Thus, we successfully synthesized multimetallic nanoplates (PtAgBiCo and PtAgBi) by combining the concepts of crystal symmetry, oxidative etching and seed ratio, and tuned their activity, stability and methanol tolerance, as well as Pt utilization, for the oxygen reduction reaction in direct methanol fuel cells. Systematic studies reveal that the formation of PtAgBiCo triangular nanoplates with a high morphological yield (>90%) can be achieved by crystallinity alteration, while electrochemical measurements indicate that the PtAgBiCo nanoplates have superior electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction. The specific and mass activity of the PtAgBiCo nanoplates are 8 and 5 times greater than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. In addition, the tetrametallic PtAgBiCo nanoplates exhibit a more positive half-wave potential for the oxygen reduction reaction and possess an excellent methanol tolerance limit compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst.									45	1	0	0	2	0	45			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000402384900015	28626567

Owing to the A : intriguing advantages of the intrinsic active species, tunable crystal structure, remarkable chemical and physical properties, and good stability, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been extensively investigated in various electrochemical energy conversions, such as the CO2 reduction reaction, N-2 reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction. More importantly, it is feasible to change the chemical environments, pore sizes, and porosity of MOFs, which will theoretically facilitate the diffusion of reactants across the open porous networks, thereby improving the electrocatalytic performance. However, owing to the high energy barriers of charge transfer and limited free charge carriers, most MOFs show poor electrical conductivity, thus limiting their diverse applications. As reported previously, MOFs were used as a porous substrate to confine the growth of nanoparticles or co-doped electrocatalysts after annealing. The conductive MOFs can combine the advantages of conventional MOFs with electronic conductivity, which significantly enhance the electrocatalytic performance. In addition, conductive MOFs can achieve conductivity via electronic or ionic routes without post-annealing treatment, thereby extending their potential applications. Different synthesis strategies have recently been developed to endow MOFs with electrical conductivity, such as post-synthesis modification, guest molecule introduction, and composite formatting. The performance of conductive MOFs can even outperform those of commercial RuO2 catalysts or Pt-group catalysts. However, it is difficult to endow most MOFs with high conductivity. This review summarizes the mechanisms of constructing conductive MOFs, such as redox hopping, through-bond pathways, through-space pathways, extended conjugation, and guest-promoted transport. Synthetic methods, including hydro/solvothermal synthesis and interface-assisted synthesis, are introduced. Recent advances in the use of conductive MOFs as heterogeneous catalysts in electrocatalysis have been comprehensively elucidated. It has been reported that conductive MOFs can demonstrate considerable catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability in different electrochemical reactions, revealing the immense potential for future displacement of Pt-group catalysts. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of conductive MOFs in electrocatalysis are discussed. Based on systematic synthesis strategies, more conductive MOFs can be constructed for electrocatalytic reactions. In addition, the morphology and structure of conductive MOFs, which can change the electrochemical accessibility between substrates and MOFs, are also crucial for catalysis, and thus, they should be extensively studied in the future. It is believed that a breakthrough for high-performance conductive MOF-based electrocatalysts could be achieved.									33	7	0	0	0	0	33			1000-6818			WOS:000616616500006		
J	PLONSKI, IH								ELECTROCHEMICAL-BEHAVIOR OF MAGNETITE ON A CARBON-STEEL ELECTRODE IN HYDROCHLORIC-ACID DISODIUM CITRATE BUFFER SOLUTIONS								CORROSION				47	11			840	851		10.5006/1.3585196				NOV 1991	1991	The behavior of magnetite on a carbon steel electrode in HCI-disodium citrate buffer-complexing solutions, at 35-degrees-C, on open circuit and under polarization has been studied. The experimental results are attributed to a nonprotective, incoherent oxide layer, which, with time, exhibited faults, cracks, preferential reduction, and undermining detachment, increasing the metal area on which the two main potential-determining reactions take place, i.e., iron dissolution and hydrogen evolution. The effect of the other cathodic reactions, such as the electrochemical reduction of magnetite and hydrogen evolution (or oxygen reduction), on magnetite is to slow down the last part of the open circuit E(corr)-t curve.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0010-9312			WOS:A1991HH54800004

Meanwhile, members of the 2D MXenes family, particularly Mo2CTx, have recently been identified as promising electrocatalyst and have been used as a potential catalyst supports to anchor single-atom. However, it still has a potential to enhance the performance by increasing surface areas and active sites. Herein, we employ an ionic liquid for coprecipitation with ReO4- salt to synthesis N-, B-, and F-atom-doped ReS2, which is grown evenly on the surface of MoC(2)Tx MXene, followed by a uniform loading of single-atom Pt on NBF-ReS2. The twodimensional morphology allows ReS2 to provide a large surface area for loading more single Pt atoms. In addition, the introduction of N, B, and F via the ionic liquid increases the number of active sites. Owing to these properties, the resulting catalyst exhibits extraordinary catalytic activity and stability during the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction. Liquid or flexible solid-state rechargeable Zn-air batteries equipped with the proposed Pt/NBF-ReS2/Mo2CTx system are also demonstrated to exhibit superior performance. This work presents a general strategy of preparing heteroatom-doped and layered nanostructures with a uniform loading of single-atom to form conductive electrodes for HER and Zn-air batteries.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2405-8297			WOS:000703291700004

E-log i curves on these films indicated two Tafel slopes which were close to - RT/F and - 2RT/F in the low and high current density regions, respectively. The reaction showed one-half order kinetics in [OH-] at low current densities and nearly zero-order at higher current densities. The reaction order with respect to the partial pressures of oxygen was found to be unity. Based on these results, a common mechanism for oxygen reduction involving the electroreduction of physisorbed molecular oxygen forming the peroxide radical as the rate-determining step has been suggested.									78	3	0	0	0	0	78			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:A1991GM42800017

Herein, in situ growth of transition metal nanoparticles is proposed to modify two commonly available feldspar minerals, albite and microcline, for promoting electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction activity via a one-step thermal reduction strategy. Three types of transition metal nanoparticles, namely, Ni, Co, and Fe, are selected to modify the albite or microcline surfaces. As expected, these modified products deliver enhanced catalytic activities compared to the pristine minerals. Particularly, Co-modified microcline (C-KASO) demonstrates the best performance that even outperforms the commercial RuO2 catalyst. This design by coupling low-cost aluminosilicate minerals with active transition metal nanoparticles offers a new insight into directly utilizing the natural abundant resources to address the current energy crisis.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			2699-9412			WOS:000783860800010

In this work, we report a kind of novel nanosheet arrays through a facile hydrothermal and subsequent electrodeposition process. The as-obtained CoNi2S4@PEDOT-150 products possess an overpotential of 270 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 50 mA cm-2 and 90 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, the electrode can be used as both anode and cathode for overall water splitting. It only requires a cell voltage of 1.75 V at 50 mA cm-2, which is superior to previous reports.

We demonstrated that the annealing temperature could influence the final component and structure of the as-prepared Ni@NC materials, which have significant impact on their electrocatalytic performance. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between structure and composition, the optimized Ni@NC-800 exhibits the highest catalytic activity and excellent durability for both HER and OER in alkaline solution. The as-prepared Ni@NC-800 can be further assembled on Ni foam substrate and serve as both anode and cathode for overall-water splitting. The facile preparation, cost-effectiveness, as well as the high activity and excellent durability of the Ni@NC material make it a promising alternative to replace noble-metal-based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0935-9648			INSPEC:17229009

After pyrolysis, the optimized Fe-N-NDC-1-900 exhibits robust anchoring ability to immobilize atomic Fe species with abundant Fe-N-4 sites, demonstrating excellent electrocatalytic activity in both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, E-1/2 = 0.89 V, E-onset = 1.06 V) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER, E-10 = 1.58 V). It also shows outstanding stability and delivers faster kinetics in oxygen electrocatalysis. Furthermore, the bifunctional Fe-N-NDC-1-900 is fabricated for a Zn-air battery, which demonstrates a high open-circuit voltage of 1.479 V, power density of 266 mW cm(-2), specific capacity of 786 mA h g(Zn)(-1), and excellent reversibility with long-term cycling. DFT suggests that the high ORR activity is mainly ascribed to its high electronegativity and small energy barriers, produced by the adjacent pore defects and optimal charge redistribution.									26	2	0	0	1	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000627067700021

Electronparamagnetic resonance (EPR) spin trap experiments were carriedout to study the effects of the RhCrOxcocatalyst on GaN-ZnO inreactive oxygen species (ROS) formation during the POWSreaction. DMPO spin trap studies in aqueous solution suggest thatROS formed during POWS could oxidize DMPO to DMPOXconfirmed by H217O isotope experiments. Further spin trap studiesby DMPO in DMSO, TEMPO, and 4-oxo-TEMP in aqueoussolutions indicate that RhOxcould facilitate both the desiredhydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and undesired reactions ofsuperoxide radicals and singlet oxygen formation. On the contrary,CrOxinhibits formation of these two ROS although it could notpromote the POWS reaction. RhCrOxcompromises the above two effects to be an outstanding cocatalyst for POWS.

Selenium dioxide is reduced to selenium by NC at high temperature and partially anchored to form C-Se-C bond. Impressively, the obtained single-atom catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability that even surpasses state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts and many previously reported nanocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the Se single atoms can serve as the ORR active sites and contribute to lowering the reaction barrier.

The effect of W6+ doping on structure, morphology, and chemical compositions was investigated by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmet-Teller surface area measurement, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Linear sweep voltammetry indicates that doping CoMoO4 with an optimum W6+ amount of 21 wt% provides higher current density at lower overpotential than other catalysts. Compared to undoped CoMoO4, the 21 wt% W-CoMoO4 also shows a remarkable activity and excellent long-term stability in alkaline media. This superior activity is ascribed to the synergistic effect of increased oxygen vacancy, enhanced surface area, and possibly improved electrical conductivity upon W6+ doping. The significances of this work are that the potential OER application of Co-W-Mo tertiary oxide, which has never been studied before, and the effect of non-3d high-valency metal (W) doping on OER activity enhancement are now being recognized.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000438679000065

Although transition metal hydr(oxy)oxides (M-OOH) have satisfactory intrinsic catalytic activity as real catalytic species for OER, their poor dispersion and stability and complicated preparation way seriously limit their subsequent applications. Herein, using a special Co-MOF precursor, a kind of bimetallic hydroxyl oxides (Fe(Co)OOH) has been in situ constructed through a one-step rapid electrochemical activation. Combining electrochemical tests with in situ spectroscopic methods, we demonstrated that the rich electronic CoBDC (Co-2(OH)(2)(C8H4O4)) array structure is conducive to the regulation of electronic structure and the enrichment and transference of OH* species to stabilize M-OOH species and exert bimetal synergistic effect. As expected, Fe(Co)OOH@CoBDC-NF (FCCN) shows the optimal OER performance, with an overpotential of only 241 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), which was nearly 30% lower than reported RuO2. Meanwhile, thanks to the support and dispersion of Co-MOF precursor, its performance can remain after 240 h of ultra-long stability test and large current test under strong alkali condition. In general, this work provides a new design inspiration for ultra-fast synthesis of bimetallic hydroxyl oxides with good dispersion, high activity and long-term stability.									25	2	0	0	1	0	27			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000727784300001

The use of graphite felt for both the cathode and the anode was key to ensuring chemoselectivity and high deuterium incorporation under neutral conditions without the need for an external reductant. This method has a number of advantages over previously reported deuteration reactions that use stoichiometric metallic reductants. Mechanistic experiments showed that O-2 evolution at the anode not only eliminates the need for an external reductant but also regulates the pH of the reaction mixture, keeping it approximately neutral.									53	6	0	0	8	0	54			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000537504200001	32394494

Herein, it is demonstrated that 2D CoNi-metal-organic framework (CoNi-MOF) array grown directly on a Cu substrate is a highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction with a low overpotential (265 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline medium. With the combination of in situ conducting atomic force microscopy and two-point conductivity measurements, it is revealed that the electron transfer is facilitated along the Z-axis better than the other directions, which can lead to an enhanced catalytic activity. In addition, a simple annealing treatment converts this 2D CoNi-MOF to a hybrid nanoplate array of metallic nitrides on an amorphous carbon network, which catalyzes the hydrogen evolution reaction with a compatible overpotential of 120 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and excellent stability.

Development of an efficient catalyst for water oxidation to evolve O-2 is indispensable for the construction of artificial photosynthetic devices. The photosynthetic oxygen evolving complex (OEC) composed of a tetranuclear manganese cluster serves as an excellent example of an efficient catalyst for water oxidation. Recently, significant progress has been reported in the development of manganese complexes as OEC models. The molecular aspects and activities of these manganese complexes toward water oxidation catalysis were reviewed in terms of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis systems. These could provide hints to design an efficient catalyst, as well as a key model reaction to understand the O-2 evolution mechanism in photosynthesis.									42	0	0	0	4	0	42			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000336741600004

Although enormous efforts have been spent on searching for alternative materials, Pt is still the most efficient HER electrocatalyst. Therefore, minimizing the loading amount of Pt in the electrocatalysts is significant. Herein, a new catalyst, uniformly dispersing Pt clusters on MoO2 nanosheets via oxygen vacancy anchoring Pt clusters on MoO2 NSs by a room-temperature light-reduction method (Pt Cs/MoO2 NSs-L), exhibits superior HER activity. The area current density of 0.5 wt% Pt Cs/MoO2 NSs-L (12.2 mA/cm(2)) is close to that of 20 wt% Pt/C (20 mA/cm(2)), but corresponds to a mass activity (7.43 A/mg) of 0.5 wt% Pt Cs/MoO2 NSs-L, 26.5-fold greater than that of the state-of-the-art commercial 20 wt% Pt/C (0.28 A/mg) at an overpotential of 50 mV vs. RHE. Density function theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the adsorption/desorption performance of H* is significantly improved on Pt and nearby Mo which the Pt is anchoring on the oxygen vacancies of MoO2. The present work demonstrates the feasibility of fabrication efficient HER electrocatalysts via a room-temperature light-reduction method and assistance of reducing with oxygen defects.									94	6	0	0	6	0	94			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000474636100015

NiO/CdS with a hierarchical structure exhibits an outstanding photocatalytic activity, the H-2 evolution rate of which is as much as 43 mmol/g/h under visible light. According to various characterization results, photocatalytic mechanism about charge transfer process was proposed. Density functional calculations reveal that oxygen vacancies introduce a defect level in the bandgap of NiO, resulting an increased visible light absorption. Furthermore, the formed heterojunction in NiO/CdS efficiently separates the photogenerated holes and electrons, which enhances the photocatalytic activities. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were carried out to illustrate the existence of oxygen defect. And the mechanism is proposed based on the concentration of Cd2+ ions after photocatalytic reaction. This study paves a new way to design highly efficient heterostructures rationally for photocatalytic H-2 evolution. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, CFOs are prepared using traditional fabrication methods and as a result always exist in powder form, making them difficult to utilise in applications. In this work, a porous bulk CFO material was fabricated via the milling and sintering of metal oxides, which can be used directly as an electrode. This CFO shows excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities. The results show that preparing the CFO under an argon (Ar) atmosphere, at high temperature and with a milling pretreatment improves the density of oxygen vacancies (OVs) in the material, thereby enhancing its ability to electrolyse water. The CFO shows high OER and HER performance when sintered at 10 00 degrees C under an Ar atmosphere and milled. In 6 M KOH solution at 10 mA cm(-2), the OER and HER overpotentials of CFO are as low as 290 and 241 mV, with OER and HER Tafel slopes of 75.5 and 114 mV dec(-1). The synthesis route developed in this study is versatile, with the CFO electrode produced exhibiting high performance in water electrolysis. (c) 2021ElsevierLtd.

These studies not only led to an ever more detailed mechanistic understanding of the biological template, but also paved the way to atypical selectivity and activity, such as catalytic hydrogen evolution. This review is aimed at representing the last decade's progress in the research of and with molybdenum and tungsten functional model compounds. The portrayed systems, organized according to their ability to facilitate typical and artificial enzyme reactions, comprise complexes with non-innocent dithiolene ligands, resembling molybdopterin, as well as entirely non-natural nitrogen, oxygen, and/or sulfur bearing chelating donor ligands. All model compounds receive individual attention, highlighting the specific novelty that each provides for our understanding of the enzymatic mechanisms, such as oxygen atom transfer and proton-coupled electron transfer, or that each presents for exploiting new and useful catalytic capability.

However, it still remains a big challenge to synthesize unconventional crystal structures under mild conditions. Herein, a facile CH4 plasma assisted strategy to synthesize hexagonal close-packed (hcp) Ni3Fe/C porous nanosheets by in situ topology reduction of Ni3Fe-LDH nanosheets is successfully developed. Compared with its face-centered cubic phase counterpart (fcc-Ni3Fe/C), the resulting hcp-Ni3Fe/C catalyst exhibits much enhanced activity with overpotentials of 70 and 201 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. Moreover, a small cell voltage of 1.54 V is realized to drive overall water splitting. Theoretical calculations further reveal that hcp-Ni3Fe allows energetically favorable adsorption and dissociation of H2O molecules. This work presents a new strategy for designing advanced metastable phase electrocatalysts with high performance for energy and environmentally relevant reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000781059700003

In this study, we fabricate hollow cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanofibers with advanced nanostructure using electrospinning and phosphidation. Due to their unique architecture and oxygen-rich surface characteristics, the novel hollow-structure CoP nanofibers effectively increase hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic activity with the low overpotentials of 91 mV (for acid) and 63 mV (for alkaline). Using in situ Raman spectroscopy, it is confirmed that high-oxygen-containing CoP catalysts could transform the CoOOH phase under alkaline conditions, which offer faster water dissociation kinetics. Furthermore, CoP nanofibers exhibited excellent durability even after 30000th accelerated degradation test cycles and overall water splitting for 40 h.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000783370200001

As a good oxygen electrode, it should possess good activity for both the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction and superior stability under operating conditions. During the past, oxygen electrodes for LOBs were generally fabricated by loading noble metal nanoparticles on the surface of a porous carbon support. However, the nanoparticles could easily lose contact with the carbon support during the reversible liquid-gas-solid reactions that involve lithium ions, oxygen gas, and Li2O2. Herein, we reported a novel Ru-metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived carbon composite, characterized by stereoscopic Ru nanoparticle distribution within the carbon matrix, as an alternative oxygen catalyst of LOBs, enabling superior operational stability and favorable activity. More specifically, the battery demonstrated stable charge-discharge cycling for up to 800 times (similar to 107 days) at a current density of 500 mA g(-1) with low discharge/charge overpotentials (similar to 0.2/0.7 V vs Li). A mechanism of regenerative surface was further proposed to explain the excellent cycling stability of the LOBs through the use of the Ru-MOF-C catalyst. These encouraging results imply an accessible solution to address issues related to the oxygen catalyst for the realization of practical LOBs.									35	4	0	0	1	0	36			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000470938500045	31090392

Recent research focuses primarily on the development of efficient CO2 reduction electrocatalysts, while little attention has been given to the development of an effective oxygen evolution anode that is compatible for practical CO2 electrolyzers. In this report, we investigated potential anode candidates that are highly active for oxygen evolution and structurally stable under near-neutral operation conditions for a typical CO2 electrolyzer. The majority of non-precious metal-based catalysts are unstable in neutral bicarbonate electrolytes during CO2 electrolysis. In contrast, iridium-coated porous titanium electrodes exhibited decent oxygen evolution reaction activities as well as excellent stability under near-neutral conditions. Furthermore, by spray coating iridium black nanoparticles onto a cation exchange membrane (Nafion 211) and coupling it with a state-of-the-art nanoporous Ag catalyst as the CO2 reduction cathode, a remarkable total current of similar to 375 mA at an applied cell voltage of 2.6V in the span of 24 h was achieved using a 25 cm(2) CO2 electrolyzer flow cell.

In this work, metal oxides of La0.1Ca0.9MnO3 and nano Co3O47 catalyst as bifunctional catalysts were used in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORER). The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and N-2 adsorption isotherms. The electrocatalytic activity of the perovskite-type La0.1Ca0.9MnO3 and Co3O4 catalysts both as single and mixtures of both were assessed in alkaline solutions at room temperature. Electrocatalyst activity, stability, and electrode kinetics were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating disk electrode (RDE). This study shows that the bifunctional performance of the mixed La0.1Ca0.9MnO3 and nano Co3O4 was superior in comparison to either La0.1Ca0.9MnO3 or nano Co3O4 alone for ORER. The improved activity is due to the synergistic effect between the La0.1Ca0.9MnO3 and nano Co3O4 structural and surface properties. This work illustrates that hybridization between these two metal oxides results in the excellent bifunctional oxygen redox activity, stability, and cyclability, leading to a cost-effective application in energy conversion and storage, albeit to the cost of higher catalyst loadings.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000431668000007

Herein, hetero-atom doping is adopted as the effective strategy to boost catalysis performances. Vanadium elements are doped into nickel hydroxide via a hydrothermal method to improve oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysis performance. XPS spectra reveal that vanadium dopants not only tune the chemical state of Ni, but also serve as promotor during the catalysis. SEM and TEM characterizations show the nanosheets assembled architecture, which provides structure advantages of easily accessible active sites and accelerates charge transfer. Electrochemical tests indicate that V-doping results in improved active sites and enhanced kinetics. The as-prepared V doped Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets grown on nickel foam (V-Ni(OH)(2)/NF) display advanced electrocatalysis performances for both OER and HER. To reach high current densities of 100 and 400 mA cm(-2), the V-Ni(OH)(2)/NF only needs low overpotentials of 275 and 476 mV for OER and 254 and 493 mV for HER. A two-electrode electrolyzer using V-Ni(OH)(2)/NF as bifunctional catalyst exhibits low cell voltages of 1.58 and 1.84 V at current densities of 100 and 400 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting in alkaline solution.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000777832200007

Herein, Co-Mo particles were electrodeposited on the carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-modified copper foam to form the Co-Mo-CNTs/rGO-copper foam (CF), then it was subjected to a certain potential for alkaline etching, thus needle-like E-Co-Mo-CNTs/rGO-CF was synthesized. Results showed that the material surface mainly formed by the interlacing of Co oxide was more conducive to capturing the intermediates in the HER/OER reaction, while the CNTs/rGO-CF structure was closely connected to the metal layer, making excellent performance of total hydrolysis in KOH. The electrocatalyst exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic activity for HER and OER in 1 M KOH, requiring only 71 and 268 mV overpotential to drive 10 mA center dot cm(-2), respectively. Especially, only a battery voltage of 1.52 V was needed to drive 10 mA center dot cm(-2) in two-electrode system for overall water splitting.

Herein, a highly crystalline CuSe has been employed as active electrodes for overall water splitting (OWS) in alkaline media. The pure-phase klockmannite CuSe deposited on highly conducting nickel foam (NF) electrodes by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) displayed an overpotential of merely 297 mV for the reaction of oxygen evolution (OER) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) whereas an overpotential of 162 mV was attained for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the same current density, superseding the Cu-based as well as the state-of-the-art RuO2 and IrO2 catalysts. The bifunctional behavior of the catalyst has successfully been utilized to fabricate an overall water-splitting device, which exhibits a low cell voltage (1.68 V) with long-term stability. Post-catalytic analyses of the catalyst by ex-situ microscopic, spectroscopic, and analytical methods confirm that under both OER and HER conditions, the crystalline and conductive CuSe behaves as an electro(pre)catalyst forming a highly reactive in situ crystalline Cu(OH)(2) overlayer (electro(post)catalyst), which facilitates oxygen (O-2) evolution, and an amorphous Cu(OH)(2)/CuOx active surface for hydrogen (H-2) evolution. The present study demonstrates a distinct approach to produce highly active copper-based catalysts starting from copper chalcogenides and could be used as a basis to enhance the performance in durable bifunctional overall water splitting.									47	1	0	0	4	0	47			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000530830600001	32196943

The mechanism and kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was studied on a porous carbon electrode in an oxygen saturated solution of 0.1 M Lithium bis-trifluoromethanesulfonimide (LiTFSI) in Dimethoxyethane (DME) using cyclic voltammetery (CV) and the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. The oxygen reduction and evolution reactions were found to occur at similar potentials to those observed on a smooth, planar glassy carbon (GC) electrode. The effect of porosity and the resultant increase in surface area were readily observed in the increase in the transient time required for the intermediates to reach the ring and the much larger disk currents (compared to smooth, planar GC) recorded respectively. The RRDE data was analyzed using a kinetic model previously developed by us and the rate constants for the elementary reactions were calculated. The rates constant for the electrochemical reactions were found to be similar in magnitude to the rate constants calculated for smooth GC disks. The porosity of the electrode was found to decrease the rate of desorption of the intermediate and the product and delay their diffusion by shifting it from a Fickian regime in the electrolyte bulk to the Knudsen regime in the film pores. Thus, it is shown that the effect of the electrode porosity on the kinetics of the ORR is physical rather than electrochemical. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their catalytic performance for oxygen evolution still needs further improvement through incorporating new physical and chemical effects. Herein, for the first time, we constructed phosphorus vacancies in cobalt phosphide integrated with reduced graphene oxide (R-CoPx/rGO) as a precursor template for defect engineering for efficient water oxidation. This template in situ transforms into the defect- and lattice distortion-enriched beta-CoOOH integrated with rGO (R-CoPx/rGO(O)), which simultaneously results in significantly enhanced oxygen evolution activity and stability. This catalyst with a 3D hierarchical nanostructure and defect-enriched surface exhibits a small overpotential of 268 mV (10 mA cm(-2)) and high current density of 311 mA cm(-2 )at 1.8 V vs. RHE for oxygen evolution, outperforming the precious metal RuO2 catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the oxygen defects induced by phosphorus vacancies can promote the electrical conductivity of beta-CoOOH. Furthermore, we prove the essential role of the unique beta-CoOOH for efficient water oxidation via a carbon layer coating strategy. This study provides a new path for the development of metal phosphides as precursors for high performance OER catalysts.									83	3	0	0	5	0	84			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000443117300047

The governing heuristics for the choice of support that would result in 'climbing up' the volcano curve for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts are delineated. Ultrathin Ru is deposited on metal coated over porous carbon supports, denoted by M/C, where M = Au, Cu, Pt, Ti and Ru, followed by the electrochemical oxidation of the Ru overlayer, which makes it possible for the support to retain its metallic character without getting oxidized to the less conductive metal oxide. An increase in the specific activity of thin RuO2 is achieved with Au/C and Pt/C-supports against the Ru/C-support. The consolidated experimental and computational results suggest that the increase of the specific activity and subsequent 'climbing up' the volcano map for OER electrocatalysts is due to the interfacial charge transfer and support-induced electrocatalyst faceting. With the increase of the thickness, the support effect on the electrocatalyst activity gets reduced and only the conductivity of the support plays a dominant role in determining the OER activity.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000653913100001

Under acidic electrolysis conditions, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) predominantly causes the overpotential loss, which makes the elucidation of OER kinetics a task of key importance for future catalyst development. Herein, we design a methodology based on vapor-fed polymer electrolyte water electrolysis to fully characterize OER kinetics in the real environment of solid electrolytes and realize the controlled benchmarking of catalysts in the absence of gas passivation commonly observed in liquid-electrolyte half-cell configurations. Vapor-fed cells, allowing for distinct manipulation of water activity, sustain the essential degree of freedom to resolve and determine all four essential kinetic parameters. Thus, this work provides valuable insights into the OER mechanism, isolates the rate-determining step, and experimentally determines the reaction order of the state-of-the-art OER catalyst IrO2/TiO(2)with respect to water. Through the combination of gas and liquid fed kinetic analysis, we elucidate the important missing link for formulating the generic governing relation for the OER overpotential and thereby providing a method for benchmarking of catalyst activities under technically representative conditions.									44	1	0	0	1	0	44			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000549074800015

Here, we developed a facile strategy for fabricating three-dimensional phosphorus and sulfur codoped carbon nitride sponges sandwiched with carbon nanocrystals (P,S-CNS). These materials exhibited high surface area and superior ORR and OER bifunctional catalytic activities than those of Pt/C and RuO2, respectively, concerning its limiting current density and onset potential. Further, we tested the suitability and durability of P,S-CNS as the oxygen cathode for primary and rechargeable Zn-air batteries. The resulting primary Zn-air battery exhibited a high open-circuit voltage of 1.51 V, a high discharge peak power density of 198 mW cm(-2), a specific capacity of 830 mA h g(-1), and better durability for 210 h after mechanical recharging. An extraordinary small charge-discharge voltage polarization (similar to 0.80 V at 25 mA cm(-2)), superior reversibility, and stability exceeding prolonged charge-discharge cycles have been attained in rechargeable Zn-air batteries with a three-electrode system. The origin of the electro catalytic activity of P,S-CNS was elucidated by density functional theory analysis for both oxygen reactions. This work stimulates an innovative prospect for the enrichment of rechargeable Zn-air battery viable for commercial applications such as armamentaria, smart electronics, and electric vehicles.									287	17	0	0	7	0	292			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000392886500035	28001038

Based upon eutectic reaction and dealloying inheritance effect, herein, novel Ni-Fe-O-based composite with a unique mesoporous nanowire network structure is designed and synthesized. The composite exhibits exceptionally low overpotential (10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 244 mV), low Tafel slope (39 mV dec(-1)), and superior long-term stability (remains 10 mA cm(-2) for over 60 h without degradation) toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH. Moreover, an alkaline water electrolyzer is constructed with the Ni-Fe-O composite as catalyst for both anode and cathode. This electrolyzer displays superior electrolysis performance (affording 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.64 V) and long-term durability. The remarkable features of the catalyst lie in its unique mesoporous nanowire network architecture and the synergistic effect of the metal core and the active metal oxide, giving rise to the strikingly enhanced active surface area, accelerated electron/ion transport, and further promoted reaction kinetics of OER.									240	12	0	0	10	0	240			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000425113600004

Nonetheless, the sluggish kinetics and poor durability under acidic and neutral conditions severely hinder practical applications such as electrolyzer compatible with the powerful proton exchange membrane and biohybrid fuel production. Here, we report a boron-doped ruthenium dioxide electrocatalyst (B-RuO2) fabricated by a facile boric acid assisted strategy which demonstrates excellent acidic and neutral OER performances. Density functional theory calculations and advanced characterizations reveal that the boron species form an anomalous B-O covalent bonding with the oxygen atoms of RuO2 and expose the fully coordinately bridge ruthenium site (Ru-bri site), which seems like a switch that turns on the inactive Ru-bri site into OER-active, resulting in more exposed active sites, modified electronic structure, and optimized binding energy of intermediates. Thus, the B-RuO2 exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 200 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and maintains excellent stability compared to commercial RuO2 in 0.5 M sulfuric acid. Moreover, the superior performance is as well displayed in neutral electrolyte, surpassing most previously reported catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000791120500002

Recently, the development of single-atom catalysts has enabled an atomic-level understanding of catalytic processes. However, it remains obscure whether the conventional concept and mechanism of one-dimensional interface are applicable to zero-dimensional single atoms. In this work, we arranged the locations of single atoms to explore their interfacial interactions for improved oxygen evolution. When iridium single atoms were confined into the lattice of CoOOH, efficient electron transfer between Ir and Co tuned the adsorption strength of oxygenated intermediates. In contrast, atomic iridium species anchored on the surface of CoOOH induced inappreciable modification in electronic structures, whereas steric interactions with key intermediates at its Ir-OH-Co interface played a primary role in reducing its energy barrier toward oxygen evolution.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000820287000001	35549330

Here, we report an interfacial coupling and confinement approach to activate CoOx clusters on phosphorized carbon nitride as an efficient and durable OER electrocatalyst. X-ray absorption and theoretical insights demonstrate that a coordinatively unsaturated surface and strong coupling effect tailor the electronic structure of Co active sites with optimized OH- adsorption energy for oxygen evolution. The resulting hybrid delivers high OER activity, reaching 10 mA cm(-2) by applying a low overpotential of 253 mV for continuous operation of 10 h. Moreover, the CoOx clusters exhibit high intrinsic activity, delivering turnover frequencies of 1.69 O-2 s(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV, which are comparable to those of benchmark OER catalysts.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000442385800024

For this purpose, calcined and uncalcined IrO2 nanoparticles were tested in an operando spectroelectrochemical cell. In situ XAS under different applied potentials uncovered strong structural changes when changing the potential. Modulation excitation spectroscopy combined with XAS enhanced the information on the dynamic changes significantly. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the resulting spectra as well as FEFF9 calculations uncovered that both the Ir L-3-edge energy and the white line intensity changed due to the formation of oxygen vacancies and lower oxidation state of iridium at higher potentials, respectively. The deconvoluted spectra and their components lead to two different OER modes. It was observed that at higher OER potentials, the well-known OER mechanisms need to be modified, which is also associated with the stabilization of the catalyst, as confirmed by in situ inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). At these elevated OER potentials above 1.5 V, stronger Ir-Ir interactions were observed. They were more dominant in the calcined IrO2 samples than in the uncalcined ones. The stronger Ir-Ir interaction upon vacancy formation is also supported by theoretical studies. We propose that this may be a crucial factor in the increased dissolution stability of the IrO2 catalyst after calcination. The results presented here provide additional insights into the OER in acid media and demonstrate a powerful technique for quantifying the differences in mechanisms on different OER electrocatalysts. Furthermore, insights into the OER at a fundamental level are provided, which will contribute to further understanding of the reaction mechanisms in water electrolysis.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000684035000088

However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and slow reaction rate of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remain challenging issues. The state-of-the-art Pt and RuO2/IrO2 electrocatalysts demonstrate excellent HER and OER performance. However, the scarcity and high cost hinder their practical applications. Herein, we present a novel approach to design a WCoSe/WCo3O4 heterostructure and use it as an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water-splitting. The synergistic effect of W and Co metal cations in the heterogeneous phase of Se and O anions could increase the charge transfer and electronic modulation of the material which could improve the catalytic activities. The water electrolysis device with the WCoSe/WCo3O4 heterostructure as a bifunctional catalyst required a small cell voltage of similar to 1.49 and 1.66 V at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the water-splitting cell displayed an exceptional durability of 100 h, surpassing the state-of-the-art Pt/C||RuO2 electrolyzer. This work offers a promising approach to construct novel 3D heterostructure electrocatalysts, which would be suitable for various energy conversion applications.									12	0	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000746667500001

Four models are considered: one with high metallicity, for which the evolution proceeds exclusively in the gas phase, two with low metallicity, for which processes proceed both in the gas phase and on grain surfaces, and a model with low metallicity and an artificially reduced oxygen content. One of the low-metallicity models initially contains only neutral components, while some initial ionization of atoms of heavy elements is included in the other models. A network of chemical reactions, including a detailed description of the chemistry of deuterium compounds, is used to analyze this sensitivity. It is shown that the initial composition affects the chemical evolution of most components in some way, but this influence is sometimes negligible. The inclusion of certain chemical factors can be important, such as surface reactions and the loss of a substantial fraction of atoms of heavy elements that are in grains. However, some components are influenced by even small variations in the initial and elemental compositions. One such component is the DCO+ ion, whose evolution is sensitive to the initial degree of ionization of atoms of heavy elements, even if the set of reactions included and the elemental composition are the same in different cases. The possible use of HD and HF as indicators of the presence of molecular hydrogen is also considered. HF reliably traces H-2 at times exceeding 10(5) years under the physical conditions considered. However,HD is not a reliable indicator of H-2 at the densities characteristic for protostellar clouds.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1063-7729	1562-6881		WOS:000395057100002

The added X-ray opacity from this oxygen affects the shock velocity during target implosion, requiring compensation in the shock timing. We developed a radiography technique that nondestructively characterizes the oxygen profile and have used it to track the evolution of the oxygen profiles in various types of storage conditions. Modified storage protocols have reduced the amount of pickup, and our database enables estimation of the oxygen profile at shot time such that the impact on target implosion performance can be minimized.					20th Target Fabrication Meeting20th Target Fabrication Meeting	MAY 20-24, 2012MAY 20-24, 2012		Santa Fe, NMSanta Fe, NM	13	1	0	0	0	0	14			1536-1055	1943-7641		WOS:000317709200013

Here we use light pretreatment to boost oxygen activation by platinum, palladium, or gold loaded on TiO2. Light pretreatment improved catalyst performance by altering metal oxidation state and/or activated oxygen (Oads) generation. For Pt/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2, light pretreatment initially promoted Oath accumulation on the metal. In time, the metal deposits underwent oxidation with a concomitant decrease in the light pretreatment benefit. Au/TiO2 differed in that no Au oxidation was observed. Electrocatalytic assessment indicated that light pretreatment lowered the energy for oxygen activation and that Au was less able to activate oxygen overall. First-principles calculations demonstrated that light pretreatment reduces the oxygen dissociation barrier as each metal becomes negatively charged via electron injection from the TiO2 conduction bands. The calculations also illustrated the ability of Pt and Pd to stabilize the oxygen once dissociated, a trait not imbued by Au.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000401054300068

Prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) act as hypoxia sensors for the HIF system in organisms ranging from humans to the simplest animal Trichoplax adhaerens.Methods: We report structural and biochemical studies on the T. adhaerens HIF prolyl hydroxylase (TaPHD) that inform about the evolution of hypoxia sensing in animals.Results: High resolution crystal structures (<= 1.3 angstrom) of TaPHD, with and without its HIF alpha substrate, reveal remarkable conservation of key active site elements between T. adhaerens and human PHDs, which also manifest in kinetic comparisons.Conclusion: Conserved structural features of TaPHD and human PHDs include those apparently enabling the slow binding/reaction of oxygen with the active site Fe(II), the formation of a stable 2-oxoglutarate complex, and a stereoelectronically promoted change in conformation of the hydroxylated proline-residue. Comparison of substrate selectivity between the human PHDs and TaPHD provides insights into the selectivity determinants of HIF binding by the PHDs, and into the evolution of the multiple HIFs and PHDs present in higher animals.									7	0	0	0	5	0	7				2324-1128		WOS:000464003600001	30519597

Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the heteroatoms in the conducting polymers, such as N, can induce the formation of the electrocatalytic active centers (EACs). For further enhancement of performance, the transition metal ion (TMI)-doped conductive polymers (such as Co(II)-doped PPy and Fe(III)-doped PANI) supported on nickel foam are developed as low-cost and high-performance electrocatalysts for HER or OER. Here, it is demonstrated that the TM. N bonds in TMI-doped conductive polymer can efficiently create high EACs and obviously lower energy barriers of intermediates and products of HER or OER. The experimental results show that the TMI-doped conductive polymer exhibits significantly improved electrocatalytic performance, such as low onset potential, high electrocatalytic activity, and excellent long-term durability. The results suggest the great promise of developing a new family of TMI-doped conducting polymers as low-cost and high-performance electrocatalysts for HER and OER in alkaline media.									29	1	0	0	2	0	29			1022-1352	1521-3935		WOS:000417214600010

Electroactive surface area of as-deposited and annealed films was estimated using oxidation-reduction system containing ferricyanide/ferrocyanide. Electrocatalytic and pseudocapacitive properties of the prepared films were investigated using 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solutions. The maximum specific capacitance of 1324 F g(-1) was observed for alpha-Co(OH)(2) films electrodeposited from nitrate-containing electrolyte. Similarly, the highest electrocatalytic activity and stability in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was determined to be characteristic for Co3O4 films derived from nitrate bath.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			2194-1459	2194-1467		WOS:000426482200001

This review focuses on the emerging application of fluorescent proteins as light-inducible intracellular photochemical partners. The first example of a chemically active GFP-like protein was the phototoxic red fluorescent protein KillerRed, which can be used for precise light-induced killing of cells, protein inactivation, and studying reactive oxygen species signaling in different cellular compartments. Moreover, recent studies revealed that various GFPs can act as light-induced electron donors in photochemical reactions with biologically relevant electron acceptors. These findings have important implications for practical uses of fluorescent proteins as well as for our understanding of the evolution and biology of this protein family.									36	1	1	0	18	0	37			1474-905X	1474-9092		WOS:000282315000003	20672171

Many types of electrocatalysts have been explored to facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, even with the application of catalysts, it is still difficult to achieve stable operation as the carbon electrode (especially the defects) easily undergoes side reactions. To achieve high stability and round-trip efficiency, the rational design of OER catalysts and stable carbon electrodes are required. Herein, we employ a wet impregnation chemistry method to form a thin layer of palladium nanoparticles on the surface of carbon, which largely suppresses the side reaction through a selective coating on the carbon defect sites. Simultaneously, the Pd films serve as an electrocatalyst enabling the OER reaction with a very low overpotential. This rational design improves overall cell efficiency and extends the cycle life of the lithium-oxygen battery.									24	0	0	0	1	0	24			2380-8195			WOS:000503114500003

The effects of the Cd(OH)(2), Co(OH)(2), and Zn(OH)(2) additions on electrode properties such as charge-discharge, reversibility of the electrode reaction, espectroelectrochemical, behavior, superficial morphology by atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, were studied. An anomalous coprecipitation of Zn(OH)(2) was observed. The different concentration of zinc nitrate on the solution affects the amount of zinc hydroxide found on the film; this behavior must be attributed to the differences on the solubility products (K-ps) of the nickel and zinc hydroxides and also to the remarkable zinc amphoteric character. All additives studied displaced the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to more positive values, and reduced the difference between the oxidation and reduction peaks (Ni(III)/Ni(III)), leading to an augmentation of the process reversibility. However, a significant loss on the electrode efficiency was observed for composite films with zinc. Lithium hydroxide solution as electrolyte showed an augmentation of the difference between the peak potential for the oxidation process and the oxygen evolution reaction, and also increased the reversibility of the redox nickel process. AFM images showed similar superficial morphologies for nickel hydroxide films and films with cobalt; on the other hand, films containing cadmium and zinc showed an inhomogeneous morphology. Nickel hydroxide film shows a differentiated spectroelectrochemical behavior when compared with composite films. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

RuIr alloy is considered to be a promising electrocatalyst because of its favorable OER performance and potential for HER. Here, the design of a bifunctional electrocatalyst with greatly boosted water-splitting performance from doping RuIr alloy nanocrystals with transition metals that modify electronic structure and binding strength of reaction intermediates is reported. Significantly, Co-RuIr results in small overpotentials of 235 mV for OER and 14 mV for HER (@ 10 mA cm(-2) current density) in 0.1 M HClO4 media. Therefore a cell voltage of just 1.52 V is needed for overall water splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen. More importantly, for a series of M-RuIr (M = Co, Ni, Fe), the catalytic activity dependence at fundamental level on the chemical/valence states is used to establish a novel composition-activity relationship. This permits new design principles for bifunctional electrocatalysts.									293	19	0	0	14	0	293			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000465600000027	30811671

The depletion of the reserves of fossil fuel combined with the deleterious effects of CO2 in the atmosphere is forcing all the world to search for alternative ways of generation and storing energy. Many scientists around the world are pursuing different forms to produce and store energy. Solar and wind sources are a reality for production of electricity, but are not continuous and require storage devices. The development of batteries and hybrid supercapacitors of high energy and power density is of great importance to complement this requirement of energy storage. Rechargeable metal-air batteries which utilize oxygen electrocatalysis seem to be an ideal choice, once the source of energy is not intermittent as solar and wind energy and is based on oxygen bifunctional electrocatalysis of both oxygen reduction and O-2 evolution reactions. In addition, water splitting allows the conversion and storage of solar/wind energy into chemical energy, generating fuels with high energy content. From this perspective, spinel MnCo2O4-based materials are promising structures for energy storage and conversion of energy. In this review, the use of low cost and abundant multifunctional materials for the development of supercapacitor devices and batteries was summarized. Completely, the design of electrocatalysts for water splitting and their capability to proportionate the tetra-electronic process of the oxygen reduction reaction are reviewed, including the main strategies in the preparation of these materials and considering their key multifunctional role in the way to a more sustainable society.									39	2	0	0	1	0	39			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000618794400047

Most of the highly active expensive electrocatalyts work in a single pH. Therefore, the development of a low cost electrocatalyst, which fulfils the above-mentioned requirements, is highly needed. Here, we report the development of Co3S4 hollow nanoparticles using a one-step hot injection method, and we modified them for superior electrocatalytic OER activity and stability in the entire pH range (alkaline, neutral, and acidic). Activated carbon supported Co3S4 hollow nanoparticles exhibit remarkable OER activity (overpotential, eta = 0.27 V in 1.0 M KOH; 0.33 V in 0.5 M H2SO4; 0.37 V in 1.0 M phosphate buffer) and offer maximal cycling stability for more than 24-48 h (>10 000 cycles) with no loss in the magnitude of current density (10 mA/cm(2)). High spin states of Co2+ and Co3+ and their large spin-orbit interactions (as indicated by XPS and EPR studies) related to oxygen surface exchange mechanism are proposed to account for the observed high electrocatalytic activity at all pH levels.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			2574-0962			WOS:000510104700106

Oxygen electrocatalysis, including both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), dominates the performance of these electrochemical energy systems. However, the sluggish kinetics of these two reactions still limits their performance and even the commercialization of these electrochemical energy storage systems. Therefore, development of nonprecious metal-based oxygen catalysts, especially with bifunctionality for both OER and ORR, is greatly demanded. In this report, polymer-assisted approach has been employed to synthesize LaCoO3-based perovskite nanoparticles, which interconnected together to form porous network structures. X-ray diffraction indicated that replacement of Co with Ni would lead to a lattice expansion due to larger ionic radius of Ni3+ as compared to that of Co3+. The electrocatalytic activity of these materials in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution showed that ORR performance of LaCoO3 can be improved through incorporation of Ni into the B-site while their OER performance will also be enhanced which renders these perovskite oxides to exhibit better bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for both OER and ORR. The enhanced performance with Ni-doping might be due to the synergistic effect from the two transition metals as a result of the formation of new redox couples Ni3+/Ni2+ as well as the higher Co3+/Co2+ ratio, which could promote adsorption of oxygen on the catalytic surface with improved the Co-O bond strength. Our study not only introduces polymer-assisted method to prepare network structured perovskite nanoparticles, but also highlights the importance of B-site metal doping in perovskites as a simple strategy to enhance their bifunctional oxygen catalytic activities.

Significant efforts have been devoted to developing efficient electrode materials for accelerating the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurred at the SOEC anode. Herein, we report that RuO2 nanoparticles possess excellent OER activity at 800 degrees C and can notably promote the OER performance of strontium doped lanthanum manganite/yttria-stabilized zirconia (LSM/YSZ) anode in solid oxide CO2 electrolyzer. The current density is improved from 0.46 A cm(-2) to 0.74 A cm(-2) at 1.2 V and 800 degrees C after anchoring 6 wt.% RuO2 onto the surface of LSM/YSZ composite electrode, with the greatest enhancement of 60%. Characterizations of X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen and transmission electron microscopy suggest that the combination of improved oxygen vacancies on the LSM/YSZ backbone and intrinsic OER activity of RuO2 nanoparticles greatly promote the OER performance in solid oxide CO2 electrolyzer.									12	5	0	0	0	0	13			2405-8297			WOS:000436924800024

The model accounts for: the bulk diffusion of glucose and dissolved oxygen towards the ultramicroelectrode (UME) and catalyst (enzyme-modified surface) and the products (gluconolactone and hydrogen peroxide) bulk one from the catalyst surface into the same cell, adsorption on and desorption from the catalyst surface of particles of both reactants. We have modified the known similar model and included into it two important processes: the surface diffusion of the adsorbed particles and intermediate reaction products, and a possibility to simulate the oxygen flux on the UME surface. The full mathematical model is described by a coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations. It is approximated by using the finite volume method in space and the alternating direction implicit finite difference technique for integration in time. The influence of the immobilized enzyme concentration, distance between the catalyst surface and the UME, surface diffusivity of all intermediate reaction products, reaction rate constants, and bulk diffusivity of reactants on the evolution of the oxygen reduction current into water at the UME is studied. In particular it is found that the surface diffusion of the intermediate reaction products decreases the oxygen reduction current while the reverse reaction between the oxidized enzyme and hydrogen peroxide increases it. The mechanism of these effects is investigated.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1878-5190	1878-5204		WOS:000475580200001

Nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) has been considered a promising electrode material for the OER. However, NiCo2O4 that can be used as an electrocatalyst in HER has not been studied yet. Herein, we report self-assembled hierarchical NiCo2O4 hollow microcuboids for overall water splitting including both the HER and OER reactions. The NiCo2O4 electrode shows excellent activity toward overall water splitting, with 10 mA cm(-2) water-splitting current reached by applying just 1.65 Vand 20 mA cm(-2) by applying just 1.74 V across the two electrodes. The synthesis of NiCo2O4 microflowers confirms the importance of structural features for highperformance overall water splitting.									630	37	0	0	20	0	638			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000377918400029	27061909

In this work, Fe-doped NiO nanosheet arrays are prepared on carbon cloth (Fe/NiO/CC) by a simple solution method and subsequent sonication. The Fe dopants facilitate energy-efficient and rapid surface reconstruction, activate more Ni3+ species, and generate more oxygen vacancies to enable fast and efficient OER. As a result, an overpotential of merely 288 mV is required for a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) by the Fe/NiO/CC electrocatalyst and a small Tafel slope of 72.6 mV dec(-1) is observed in the alkaline electrolyte. Based on densityfunctional theory calculation, the difference in the bonding and charge redistribution in NiO caused by Fe dopants modulates the electronic structure and coordination unequally, consequently increasing the number of active sites and enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activity as well. The results provide a deeper understanding of how heteroatom doping modulates the intrinsic activity of active atoms in transition metal-based electrocatalysts and reveal the role in reconstruction in electrocatalytic OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000862607400001

This study concerns the phase and morphology modulation of Ni3Se2/NiSe nanorod arrays through a hydrothermal process. Partial phase conversion can effectively enhance the electrical conductivity and yield more active sites through atom rearrangement during phase transformation. Quite low optimal overpotentials of 166mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 370mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are obtained in a sample containing 32.4% of NiSe phase and 67.6% of Ni3Se2 phase. The performance is superior to the samples with only one phase. Furthermore, a water electrolyzer was assembled by using two symmetrical NiSe/Ni foam electrodes as the anode and cathode, which can deliver 10mAcm(-2) at a low voltage of 1.61V. More significantly, the water electrolyzer can be operated at 10mAcm(-2) over 10h without noticeable degradation, showing extraordinary operational stability. This phase conversion control strategy provides a new way to improve the catalytic activity of NiSe and may have potential use in the design of other selenide electrocatalysts.									32	3	0	0	0	0	32			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000471314900024	30329216

Herein, a Fe-incorporated dual-metal selenide on nickel foam (Co0.9Fe0.1-Se/NF) is synthesized via a facile one-step electrodeposition method. As-synthesized materials could serve as self-supported bifunctional electrocatalysts with excellent catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Experimental results show that delivering a 10 mA cm(-2) water splitting current density only requires a cell voltage of 1.55 V. In addition, a very stable performance could be kept for about 36 hours, indicating their excellent working stability. Moreover, by means of phase analysis, we have identified that the evolution of the synthesized Co0.9Fe0.1-Se/NF experiences two entirely different processes in HER and OER, which hydroxide and oxyhydroxide are regarded as the real active sites, respectively. This work may pave the way to further understanding the relationships between the reactivity and stability of chalcogenide-based electrocatalysts and facilitating the rational design of efficient electrocatalysts for future renewable energy system applications.

Metal oxide nanoarray electrodes are considered to be alternative options for this issue, although they always suffer from poor conductivity and limited ORR performance in terms of onset potential and diffusion current. In this study, we develop an alternative strategy to prepare a novel bifunctional catalyst by coating threedimensional CoOx nanoarrays with a porous nitrogen-doped carbon layer (NC). The porous NC not only provides a conductive coating to benefit the charge transfer and retains the channels for electrolyte diffusion, but also greatly enhances the electrochemical surface area, which endows the electrode with higher activity for both the OER and ORR in terms of onset potential and diffusion current. When employed as an air cathode in rechargeable zinc-air batteries over 100 cycles, the electrode exhibits durable performance superior to those of Pt/C and IrO2/C. The results fully demonstrate the great potential of the strategy in electrode construction.									36	2	0	0	0	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000408592900005

At present, many pieces of research are focused on the effects of micropore, mesopore and hierarchical pore structure on the catalytic activity, however, there are few works concerning the role of large-dimension through-hole structure. Hence, in this work, we prepare two kinds of carbon materials with large through-hole structure, i.e. N-doped carbon hollow-spheres and hollow-tubes, as the oxygen reduction catalysts. The synthesis follows template-free morphology-controlled pyrolysis, which is more convenient than the preparation of conventional N-doped nanotubes and graphene. The resultant N-doped carbon hollow-spheres and hollow-tubes evidently enhanced their ORR catalytic activity, remarkable long-term stability and methanol resistance. The large-dimension through-hole structure is found to account for the increase in mass transfer.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000540854100001	32375129

Here, we report an electrochemical protocol for selective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides over a CoFe layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH) anode in an aqueous-MeCN electrolyte, coupled with 2-fold promoted cathodic H-2 productivity. This protocol displays high activity (85-96% yields), catalyst stability (10 cycles), and generality (12 examples) in selective sulfide oxidation. We demonstrate its applicability in the synthesis of four important pharmaceutical related sulfoxide compounds with scalability (up to 1.79 g). X-ray spectroscopy investigations reveal that the CoFe-LDH material evolved into amorphous CoFe-oxyhydroxide under catalytic conditions. This work may pave the way towards sustainable organic synthesis of valuable pharmaceuticals coupled with H-2 production.									21	2	0	0	2	0	22			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000615335100012	34163860

The local pH shift driven by the redox reaction can be visualized through fluorescence imaging of the interface. The use of finite strong acid concentrations further serves to constrain the pH change to a thin layer adjacent to the surface. This chemical confinement of the fluorophore improves the system's resolution and enables micrometer scale heterogeneity on the electrode surface to be readily visualized.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1948-7185			WOS:000418786600025	29210579

The effects of duty cycle on the morphology and phase structure were investigated by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The SEM and XRD results show that the decrease of duty cycle can reduce the grain size of PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes and make the electrodes more compact. The CeO2 content in composite electrodes increases with the decrease of duty cycle. The steady-state polarization curves and accelerated life tests demonstrate that the oxygen evolution overpotential and service life of PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes increase with the decrease of duty cycle. The service life of PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes prepared with 25 % duty cycle reaches 218 h which is 1.8 times longer than that of PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes prepared by direct electrodeposition. The bulk electrolysis shows that the degradation of malachite green (MG) on the PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes is the pseudo-firstorder reaction and the MG and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency on PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes increases with the decrease of duty cycle, which can be attributed to the higher oxygen evolution overpotentials, electrochemical active surface area, and CeO2 content in the composite electrodes.									12	3	0	0	1	0	15			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000374711100014

Herein, we identify at the atomic level potential-driven dynamic-coupling oxygen on atomically dispersed hetero-nitrogen-configured Ir sites (AD-HN-Ir) in the OER working conditions to successfully provide the atomically dispersed Ir electrocatalyst with ultrahigh electrochemical acidic OER activity. Using in-situ synchrotron radiation infrared and X-ray absorption spectroscopies, we directly observe that one oxygen atom is formed at the Ir active site with an O-hetero-Ir-N-4 structure as a more electrophilic active centre in the experiment, which effectively promotes the generation of key *OOH intermediates under working potentials; this process is favourable for the dissociation of H2O over Ir active sites and resistance to over-oxidation and dissolution of the active sites. The optimal AD-HN-Ir electrocatalyst delivers a large mass activity of 2860 A g(metal)(-1) and a large turnover frequency of 5110 h(-1) at a low overpotential of 216 mV (10 mA cm(-2)), 480-510 times larger than those of the commercial IrO2. More importantly, the AD-HN-Ir electrocatalyst shows no evident deactivation after continuous 100 h OER operation in an acidic medium.Uncovering the dynamics of active sites in the working conditions is important yet challenging. Here the authors identify dynamic-coupling oxygen on atomically dispersed iridium sites during oxygen evolution reaction using in situ techniques.									25	0	0	0	1	0	24				2041-1723		WOS:000710514300004	34675195

Nickel boride prepared by reducing nickel salts with sodium borohydride proved to be the most suitable one. This catalyst, however, is easily deactivated by hydrogen peroxide ions formed as an intermediate in the reduction of oxygen on oxygen electrodes. The rate of gas evolution on loaded and unloaded electrodes was measured in a specially designed vessel and the results are discussed with respect to the porous structure of the electrodes. Investigation of carbon oxygen electrodes in fuel- containing electrolyte (12 N KOH+1 M N2H4) proved that the increase in temperature has a favourable influence on both the reduction of oxygen (desirable reaction) as well as the oxidation of hydrazine (side reaction) so that no major improvement of their working ability was achieved.					6th international symposium on power sources 2 19686th international symposium on power sources 2 1968	24-26 Sept. 196824-26 Sept. 1968		Brighton, Sussex, UKBrighton, Sussex, UK	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0-08-013435-1	INSPEC:154214

Herein, we have employed a similar idea to exfoliate the layered double hydroxide (LDH), which is proposed as a promising material for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis. Usually, the efficiency of these materials is largely restricted due to their sheetlike morphology, which is susceptible to stacking. In this work, NiFe-LDH sheets were fabricated on nickel foam in a one-step co-precipitation technique and their ultrathin nanosheets (similar to 2 nm) are obtained by in situ oxygen-plasma-controlled exfoliation. In addition, the oxygen vacancies in exfoliated sheets were generated by a chemical reduction method that further improved the electronic conductivity and overall electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst. This approach can address the limitations of NiFe-LDH, such as poor conductivity and low stability, making it more efficient for electrocatalysis. It is also observed that the catalyst having 60 s O-plasma exposure after chemical reduction, i.e., NiFe-OOHOV, outperformed remaining electrocatalysts and exhibited superior OER activity with a low overpotential of 330 mV to achieve a high current density of 50 mA cm(-2). The catalyst also displayed an ECSA-normalized OER overpotential of 288 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibited excellent long-term stability (120 h) in an alkaline electrolyte. Remarkably, ultrathin defect-rich catalyst continuously produced O-2, resulting in a high faradaic efficiency of 98.1% for the OER.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000751884800074	34779604

However, the realization of tunable electronic structure and synergetic catalysis of cobalt sulfides is still a challenge. In this work, a salt-templating route was adopted to embed uniform Co9S8 nanoparticles into high-conductive N, S co-doped carbon nanosheets (Co9S8/N,S-CNs). Benefiting from the abundant catalytic active sites and optimized electronic structure, the as-prepared Co9S8/N,S-CNs exhibited high efficiency with a low overpotential of 325 mV to afford current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and low Tafel slope of 86.3 mV dec(-1) towards oxygen evolution in 1 M KOH alkaline electrolyte.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000458943900008

In this article, we put forward a novel and facile approach, oxidation and subsequent reduction, for in situ porous and wrinkled treatment of commercial nickel foam to construct a micron rough nickel foam (MRNF). The fabricated MRNF is developed as a current collector to construct an OER composite electrode by depositing nanostructured Co(OH)(2) on its surface via constant voltage deposition method. The results indicate that the porous and wrinkled treatment could obviously increases the contact sites between current collector (MRNF) and active material (Co(OH)(2)), leading to a remarkably reduction in charge transfer resistance. The designed MRNF/Co(OH)(2) electrode presents enhanced OER electrocatalysis activity with a low overpotential of 274.4 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2 )within alkaline solution. Furthermore, the hierarchical porous and wrinkle structures of the MRNF also significantly improve the mechanical integrity of the electrode, resulting in superior stability.

Benefiting from the strong electronic interaction between the NiFe LDH nanosheets and Ni3Se4 micro-sized sheets, the hierarchical hetero-Ni3Se4@NiFe LDH micro/nanosheets are endowed with enhanced charge transfer and reaction kinetics. As a result, the obtained hierarchical hetero-Ni3Se4@NiFe LDH/CFC (carbon fiber cloth) electrode shows optimized hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties in alkaline medium with a small overpotential of 85 mV and 223 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. When the hierarchical hetero-Ni3Se4@NiFe LDH/CFCs are used as bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting in a two-electrode electrolyzer, the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is derived at a cell voltage of 1.54 V. Moreover, due to the stability of the novel hierarchical hetero-micro/nanostructure, the as-prepared Ni3Se4@NiFe LDH/CFC exhibited high stability in the electrochemical processes over 100 h. This work highlights the importance of constructing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting by rational design of heterostructures.									57	5	0	0	5	0	58			2055-6756	2055-6764		WOS:000481910600009

Furthermore, a systematicstudy has been conducted on the effect of NP and NS morphologies of VSe2 in their catalytic activities toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under alkaline, neutral, and acidic conditions: Research on VSe2 clearly demonstrates that these morphologies do not have a significant difference for ORR and OER; however, a drastic effect of morphology was observed for HER The ORR activity of both NSs and NPs involves similar to 2.85 numbers of electrons with the Tafel slope of 120 mV/dec in alkaline and neutral pH. In alkaline solution, NPs are proved to be an efficient catalyst for OER with an onset potential 1.5 V; however, for HER, NSs have a better onset potential of -0.25 V. Moreover, the obtained NPs have also better catalytic activity with a 400 mV anodic shift in the onset potential compared to NSs. These results provide a reference point for the future application of VSe2 in energy storage and conversion devices and mass production of other 2D materials.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			2470-1343			WOS:000418744100095	31457371

However, as one of the half reactions, OER is featured with four-proton-coupled electron transfer, which is thus a bottleneck of accomplishing this goal. It is of great realistic significance for the fabrication of catalysts with environment-friendly, cost-effective, long-lived, as well as extraordinary redox behaviors for OER. Herein, a class of ultrathin wrinkled NiFeP nanosheets (NSs) are designed and synthesized by a facile reduction strategy employing NaBH4 as reducing agent at room temperature. As a result, owing to the composition and structure features, a relatively low overpotential of 237 mV is required for the optimized Ni1FE0.8 P NSs to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope is only 39.7 mV dec(-1), both of which are superior to Ir/C catalyst. More importantly, such catalyst also shows no evidence of activity degradation following more than 30 h of electrochemical operation. Our work not only shows a promising electrocatalyst for OER but also offers a simple way for the design and fabrication of cost-effective OER catalysts with both enhanced activity and stability.

The earth abundant first-row metal oxides such as manganese oxide have been found very active after anchoring nanoparticular noble metals such as Au, Pd and Pt onto its surface. Recent reports have demonstrated that Au can increase the turnover frequency (TOF) of MnOx more than 10 times for the OER due to the unique local interaction between Au and MnOx. Here, we conducted a detailed comparative study of different preparation methods on the OER activity of Au/MnO2 nanocomposites, including physical sputtering (PS), deposition precipitation with urea (DPU), DP with NaOH (DPN) and deposition reduction (DR) with NaBH4. Through carefully controlling the preparation conditions, we find chemical preparation methods (i.e., DPU and DPN) can achieve uniform growth of monodispersed Au nanoparticles on MnO2 nanowires (Au/MnO2) same as sputtering; moreover, the as-prepared Au-MnO2 by DPU and DPN shows stronger interaction than that by sputtering, thereby achieving higher OER performance. Delicate chemical valence change and conductivity improvement induced by such interaction are further quantified by conventional XPS, resistivity and impedance measurements.									29	1	0	0	5	0	29			2168-0485			WOS:000361090200020

CoS2, a pyrite-type alkaline HER electrocatalyst, suffers from sluggish HER kinetics and severe catalyst leaching due to its weak water dissociation kinetics and oxygen-related corrosion. Herein, it is demonstrated that the interfacial Lewis acid-base Ce center dot center dot center dot S pairs in CeO2-loaded CoS2 effectively improve the catalytic activity and durability. In CeO2-loaded CoS2 nanowire array electrodes, these interfacial Lewis acid-base Ce center dot center dot center dot S pairs with unique electronic and structural configurations efficiently activate water adsorptive dissociation and kinetically accelerate hydrogen evolution, delivering a low overpotential of 36 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media. Such Ce center dot center dot center dot S pairs also weaken O-2 adsorption on CoS2, leading to undecayed activity over 1000 h. These findings are expected to provide guidance for the design of CeO2-based electrocatalysts as well as other hybrid electrocatalysts for water splitting.									12	0	0	0	3	0	12			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000685847400001	34405538

Here, a facile plasma-photochemical strategy is applied to construct atomically coordinated Pt-Co-Se moieties in defective CoSe2 (CoSe2-x) through filling the plasma-created Se vacancies in CoSe2-x with single Pt atomic species (CoSe2-x-Pt) under ultraviolet irradiation. The filling of single Pt can remarkably enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of CoSe2. Optimal OER specific activity is achieved with a Pt content of 2.25 wt% in CoSe2-x-Pt, exceeding that of CoSe2-x by a factor of 9. CoSe2-x-Pt shows much better OER performance than CoSe2-x filled with single Ni and even Ru atomic species (CoSe2-x-Ni and CoSe2-x-Ru). Noticeably, it is general that Pt is not a good OER catalyst but Ru is; thus the design of active sites for electrocatalysis at an atomic level should follow a different intrinsic mechanism. Mechanism studies unravel that the single Pt can induce much higher electronic distribution asymmetry degree than both single Ni and Ru, and benefit the interaction between the Co sites and adsorbates (OH*, O*, and OOH*) during the OER process, leading to a better OER activity.									153	8	0	0	11	0	153			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000456325900018	30488551

In this letter, we describe the rapid electroless deposition of amorphous Ni-B nanoparticle film on Ni foam (Ni-B/Ni foam) by alternative dipping of Ni foam into Ni precursor and reducing solutions. This Ni-B/Ni foam acts as an efficient and durable 3D catalytic electrode for water splitting, affording 100 mA cm(-2) at 360 mV overpotential for the OER and 20 mA cm(-2) at 125 mV overpotential for the HER in 1.0M KOH, and its twoelectrode electrolyzer demands a cell voltage of 1.69 V to afford 15 mA cm(-2) water-splitting current. Moreover, the catalyst loading can be easily tuned and this alternately dipping deposition technique works universally for other conductive substrates.									68	4	0	0	6	0	69			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000370442900001	26891459

For this purpose, solutions of copper oxide or copper-olive leaf extract complexes were synthesized using copper acetate as a precursor and olive leaf extract as a reducer/stabilizer. Highly defected graphite (DG) rods and plates were then decorated with these particles. The decoration process was conducted by simple immersion of the graphitic materials in the solution followed by oxidation at 250 degrees C to obtain stable cupric oxide nanoparticles on the DGs and used as electrodes. The decorated electrodes were tested for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction in Na2CO3. It was found that the current density and stability for HER reaction can be enhanced as a result of this decoration. The current density variation with temperature variation was monitored and was found to increase when the electrolyte temperature increases from 25 to 48 degrees C, indicating a possible harvesting of solar thermal energy as assistant in water splitting process.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1574-1443	1574-1451		WOS:000455160000015

Tungsten oxide, WO3, has been long expected to be a promising non-precious-metal electrocatalyst for hydrogen production. However, the poor intrinsic activity of this material hampers its development. Herein, we design a highly efficient hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst via introducing oxygen vacancies into WO3 nanosheets. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that the gap states introduced by O vacancies make WO3 act as a degenerate semiconductor with high conductivity and desirable hydrogen adsorption free energy. Experimentally, we prepared WO3 nanosheets rich in oxygen vacancies via a liquid exfoliation, which indeed exhibits the typical character of a degenerate semiconductor. When evaluated by hydrogen evolution, the nanosheets display superior performance with a small overpotential of 38 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1). This work opens an effective route to develop conductive tungsten oxide as a potential alternative to the state-of-the-art platinum for hydrogen evolution.									137	11	0	0	9	0	137			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000418393300111	29178807

An obstacle that impedes the development of OER electrocatalysts is the insufficient emphasis on the spin attribution of electrons. Recently, the different spin configuration of reactants and products in the OER has been recognized as the factor that slows down the reaction kinetics. In this work, Mn substitution was introduced to LaCoO3, which brought about lattice expansion and reduced crystalline field splitting energy. This led to the increase in the effective magnetic moment, which triggers the transfer of Co3+ from low to higher spin states. Thus, the hybridization of Co e(g) and O 2p states across the Fermi level was strengthened. Specifically, with 25 at. % Mn substitution, LaCoO3 transits from a semiconductor to a half-metal, which benefits the spin-oriented electronic transport and resultantly promotes the OER. This method paves the way for the construction of spin pathways in catalysts.</p>									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0003-6951	1077-3118		WOS:000711169600001

Herein, we report one-dimensional iron-cobalt oxide (FeCo2O4) nanorod arrays supported on nickel foam (NF) synthesized via a simple chemical bath deposition (CBD) method to accelerate OER. Consequently, the FeCo2O4 nanorods exhibit significantly increased OER activity in alkaline solutions while maintaining high stability and a low OER overpotential of 290 mV at 25 mA cm(-2). The improved OER performance is attributed to the electrode's enhanced intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, which is due to the synergetic effect of Fe and Co, a large number of active sites, and a low charge transfer resistance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0167-577X	1873-4979		WOS:000745662900002

However, very little is known about the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution in the presence of lithium ions in aprotic electrolytes, which hinders the improvement of low round-trip efficiencies of current lithium-air batteries. We report the intrinsic ORR activity on glassy carbon (GC) as well as polycrystalline Au and Pt electrodes, where Au is the most active with an activity trend of Au >> GC > Pt. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements were used to obtain the kinetic current of the ORR and the reaction order with respect to oxygen partial pressure in 1 M LiClO4 propylene carbonate: 1,2-dimethoxyethane (1:2 v/v). In addition, air electrodes with Vulcan carbon or Au or Pt nanoparticles supported on Vulcan were examined in Li-O-2 single cells, where the observed discharge cell voltages follow the catalytic trend established by RDE measurements. The ORR mechanism and the rate-determining steps were discussed and contrasted with the ORR activity trend in acid and alkaline solutions. (C) 2010 The Electrochemical Society.

However, the further development of RFCs is severely hindered by bifunctional oxygen catalysts. As a promising bifunctional oxygen catalyst, cobalt-based perovskites become a research hotspot in this field. However, its oxygen catalytic activity and stability still need to be further improved. In this paper, a series of Sr_(1-x)Sm_xCoO_3 (SSC, x=0-0.6) oxygen catalysts were prepared by a modified sol-gel method and their oxygen catalytic activity and stability were studied. The results showed that samarium ion doping could effectively improve the bifunctional oxygen catalytic activities of SrCoO_3 perovskite. Among them, Sr_(0.7)Sm_(0.3)CoO_3 (SSC-30) had the highest oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity, and its onset potential and half-wave potential could reach 0.798 V and 0.638 V(vs RHE). Sr_(0.8)Sm_(0.2)CoO_3 (SSC-20) had the highest oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity and its potential and corresponding overpotential eta could respectively reach 1.692 V and 462 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm~2. Based on the results of ORR and OER catalytic activities, SSC-30 had the best bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity and the potential difference DeltaE between OER and ORR was only 1.071 V. In addition, Sm-doping could further improve the oxygen catalytic stability of SrCoO_3, and its catalytic stability toward ORR and OER of SSC-30 was much higher than that of SrCoO_3. The results of this paper can give guidance for the development and application of bifunctional cobalt-based perovskites.			近年来,可逆燃料电池因其高效环保而备受关注,然而其进一步发展受到双功能氧催化剂的严重制约.作为一种极具开发前景的双功能氧催化剂,钴基钙钛矿成为该领域的研究热点.然而,其氧催化活性和稳定性尚需进一步改善.采用改性溶胶-凝胶工艺制备了Sr_(1-x)Sm_xCoO_3(SSC,x=0~0.6)系列氧催化剂,并对其氧催化活性与稳定性进行了研究.结果表明,Sm掺杂能有效改善SrCoO_3体系的双功能氧催化活性.其中,Sr_(0.7)Sm_(0.3)-CoO_3(SSC-30)具有最高的氧还原催化活性,其起始电位和半波电位可达0.798 V和0.638 V(vs RHE).Sr_(0.8)-Sm_(0.2)CoO_3(SSC-20)具有最高的氧析出催化活性,其在10 mA/cm~2电流密度下的电位值可达1.692 V,对应的过电位eta为462 mV.综合氧还原和氧析出催化活性的测试结果,SSC-30具有最佳的双功能氧催化活性,OER和ORR的电位差DeltaE仅为1.071 V.此外,Sm掺杂还能进一步提高SrCoO_3的氧催化稳定性,其中SSC-30对氧还原与析出的催化稳定性均高于SrCoO_3.研究结果有望为双功能钴基钙钛矿的开发和应用提供理论指导.						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-9731			CSCD:6509423

In this study, a hybrid scheme of electrocatalysts is demonstrated for bifunctional operation under both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a single pH solution. The bifunctional hybrid electrodes are synthesized by the incorporation of a nanosized thin Pt film and CoP2 nanoparticles/layers through a physiochemical approach on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. With an optimum bifunctional hybrid electrode, a low overpotential of 320 mV for the OER and 21.1 mV for the HER at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) is demonstrated in an alkaline medium of 1.0 M KOH. The bifunctional electrode demonstrates a good performance with a low applied potential of 1.57 V with excellent stability at 10 mA/cm(2) in a two-electrode electrolyzer system. The nanosized thin Pt layer can offer largely improved electrochemical active sites for Pt-H-ads formation that are advantageous for HER operation and also can improve the conductivity, which is beneficial for the subsequent electrochemical deposition of CoP2 and overall overpotential reduction. At the same time, the positively charged Co+ atoms can act as the hydroxyl receptors (OH-) and negatively charged P- atoms can promote the adsorption of H+ protons, thus improving the H2O splitting process. Various hybrid electrodes are prepared by the variation of CoP2 deposition cycles on the Pt/FTO substrate, and the optimum fabrication conditions can found with a wide range of combinations of CoP2 nanoparticles and layers, which can offer increased active sites to reduce ion transport resistance and promote the diffusion of gas products (H-2 and O-2).									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2574-0970			WOS:000555518200034

Because of the sluggish kinetics, platinum (Pt) is widely used as the electrocatalysts for ORR. However, the high cost of Pt and poor stability of carbon black support under high voltage limit the commercialization and durability of fuel cells. Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) possess large specific area, tunable electronic structure, and high chemical stability, making them a good candidate for ORR catalysts with high activity and durability. This paper reviews the recent progress of 2D TMDs-based ORR electrocatalysts. First, crystal structure, electronic properties, and ORR reaction mechanism are briefly introduced. Then some strategies for adjusting ORR performance of 2D TMDs are summarized, including heteroatom doping, phase conversion, defect engineering, and strain engineering. Meanwhile, the ORR activity enhancement arising from 2D TMDs-based heterostructures is also analyzed. Finally, perspectives are given for current issues and their possible solutions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-324X			WOS:000828119600001

In this study, crystalline CFCO ultrasmall particles with nanometric dimension are synthesized by a reverse micelle method on TiO2 nanoparticles. The particle size decreases with decreasing molar ratio of water to surfactant. The precursors of CFCO must be calcined after loading on TiO2 nanoparticles to achieve CFCO ultrasmall particles with several nanometers in size. Interaction between the precursors and TiO2 is speculated to suppress aggregation of the precursors during calcination. The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 for OER is improved by loading of CFCO ultrasmall particles with 5 nm, whereas the activity decreases by loading of CFCO with more than 15 nm. Photocatalytic activity of the most active CFCO/TiO2 is comparable to that of RuO2/TiO2. Both the lower edge of conduction band and higher edge of valence band of CFCO are lower and higher than those of TiO2, respectively, leading to transfer of excited holes and electrons transferred to CFCO and recombination. When the particle size of CFCO becomes several nanometric dimensions, the transferred holes rapidly reach the surface of CFCO and oxidize water molecules before recombination with electrons.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000527647800001

The most unique aspect of our synthesis protocol is the fact that we are able to solubilize both cubic antifluorite and orthorhombic crystal systems, into uniform solid solutions of Co2-xRhxP nanoparticles under mild reaction conditions. These nanoparticles are active towards the oxygen evolution reaction and deliver higher electrolytic activities as compared to those of Co2P and Rh2P binary phases. Cobalt-rich compositions were found to be the most active, with a sweet spot occurring at a target composition of Co1.75Rh0.25P, where a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was achieved at an overpotential of 0.29 V.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000436516700058

Whereas, their practical application is impeded by several challenging problems, such as the low energy round trip efficiencies and the insufficient cycle life, due to the cathode passivation caused by the accumulation of discharge products. Developing efficient catalyst for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions is effective to reduce the overpotentials in Li-O-2 cells. In our work, we report a Co3O4 modified Ag/g-C3N4 nanocomposite as a bifunctional cathode catalyst for Li-O-2 cells. The g-C3N4 substrate prevents the accumulation of Ag and Co3O4 nanoparticles and the presence of Ag NPs improves the surface area of g-C3N4 and electronic conductivity, significantly improving the oxygen reduction/evolution capabilities of Co3O4. Due to a synergetic effect, the Ag/g-C3N4/Co3O4 nanocomposite demonstrates a higher catalytic activity than each individual constituent of Co3O4 or Ag/g-C3N4 for the ORR/OER on as catalysts in Li-O-2 cells. As a result, the Ag/g-C3N4/Co3O4 composite shows impressive electrochemical performance in a Li-O-2 battery, including high discharge capacity, small gap between charge and discharge potential, and high cycling stability.

Here, we report an in situ deoxidation and graphitization mechanism for graphene oxide that allows for high-quality reduced graphene oxide sheets under the low temperature condition (<300 degrees C) by utilizing a well-known Fischer-Tropsch reaction catalyst (CuFeO2). By applying modified FTR conditions, where graphene oxide was reduced on the catalyst surface under the hydrogen-poor condition, deoxidation with much suppressed carbon loss was possible, resulting in high-quality graphene sheets. Our experimental data and density functional theory calculations proved that reduction which occurred on the CuFeO2 surface preferentially removed adsorbed oxygen atoms in graphene oxide sheets, leaving dissociated carbon structures to be restored to a near-perfect few-layer graphene sheet. TGA-mass data revealed that GO with catalysts released 92.8% less carbon-containing gases than GO without catalysts during the reduction process, which suggests that this process suppressed carbon loss in graphene oxide sheets, leading to near-perfect graphene. The amount of oxygen related to the epoxide group in the basal plane of GO significantly decreased to near zero (from 43.84 to 0.48 at. %) in catalyst-assisted reduced graphene oxide (CA-rGO). The average domain size and the density of defects of CA-rGO were 4 times larger and 0.1 times lower than those for thermally reduced graphene oxide (TrGO), respectively. As a result, CA-rGO had a 246 and 8 times lower electrical resistance than TrGO and CVD-graphene. With these performances, CA-rGO coated paper connected to a coin-cell battery successfully lit an LED bulb, and CA-rGO itself acted as an efficient catalyst for both the hydrogen evolution reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000679406500060	34196523

Herein we give an affirmative answer by reporting an illumination-enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using CuS nanodisks (NDs) alone as the electrocatalyst. Impressively, under 1221 nm laser or xenon lamp illumination, an unprecedented reduction of OER overpotential was observed on the CuS ND-coated electrodes. Transient absorption combined with Mott-Schottky measurements disclosed that near-infrared (NIR) irradiation generated abundant hot holes from LSPR damping in the CuS NDs accounting for the remarkable OER performance enhancement. This is the first report on the direct utilization of plasmonic hot holes in CuS nanomaterials for boosting OER performance, opening up a new route to designing NIR-active photocatalysts/electrocatalysts by exploiting the unique LSPR properties.									6	0	0	0	0	0	5			1948-7185			WOS:000692014200012	34398606

Generating hydrogen by water splitting with highly efficient electrocatalysts is a feasible route to meet current and future energy demand. Herein, the effects of Ru doping and phosphorization treatment on Co(3)O(4)nanoarrays for water splitting are systemically investigated. The results show that a small amount of phosphorus can accelerate hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the trace of Ru dopant can significantly enhance the catalytic activities for HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Ru-doped cobalt phosphorous oxide/nickel foam (CoRuPO/NF) nanoarrays exhibit highly efficient catalytic performance with an overpotential of 26 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)for HER and 342 mV at 50 mA cm(-2)for OER in 1 M KOH solution, indicating superior water splitting performance. Furthermore, the CoRuPO/NF also exhibits eminent and durable activities for alkaline seawater electrolysis. This work significantly advances the development of seawater splitting for hydrogen generation.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3				2046-2069		WOS:000555612200064	35515797

A sol of titania nano-particles was synthesized by means of precipitation technique. The electro-deposition parameters and the properties of composite coatings were compared with those typical of analogous composite electrodeposits produced from the plating bath containing suspended commercially available nano powder Degussa P25. The electrodeposition process obeys the modified Guglielmi's model. The incorporation of TiO2 dispersed phase into iron matrix results in an appreciable increase in the microhardness due to dispersion strengthening. The microhardness of deposits obtained from electrolyte with the addition of nano-sized titania sol exceeds that which is observed for coatings produced from the bath containing aggregated Degussa P25 TiO2 particles. The introduction of dioxide titanium particles into Fe matrix yields photocatalytic properties towards the reaction of organic dye degradation and improves electrocatalytic performance towards hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000424719500006

The presence of transition metal imparts conductivity, surface termination groups induce hydrophilicity and layered structure offers large surface area which makes MXenes a potential candidate to be utilized as an electro-catalyst with enhanced efficiency. The Water Electrolysis (WE) efficiency of an electro-catalysts is dependent on the performance of half-cell reactions i.e. Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER). The OER kinetics of most of the bi-functional electrocatalysts are considered sluggish due to which they are tested in alkaline media. However, due to the metallic nature and surface properties of MXenes, they as substrate not only improve HER performance of grown electro-catalyst but also facilitate OER kinetics which is considered sluggish for most bi-functional electrocatalysts. This review presents the significance of MXenes as HER, OER, and bi-functional electrocatalysts by discussing the electrocatalytic properties of a wide range of MXenes and how their hetero-structures affect HER, OER, and bi-functional electrocatalytic performance. In the end, the current challenges, and future perspectives of MXenes and their nanocomposites for water electrolysis have been discussed. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials have gained attention as catalysts for these reactions, and their catalytic effect upon changing the size, shape, thickness, and phase has been studied. However, there are no reports on the role of proton transfer in catalysis by 2D materials. Here, a novel way to enhance the catalytic effect of 2D MoS2 was demonstrated via functionalization with four different organic moieties: phenyl-Me, phenyl-OMe, phenyl-OH, and phenyl-COOH groups. The role of proton transfer in 2D catalysis was carefully investigated via electrochemical kinetic analysis and electrical measurement. The best HER performance was observed with proton-donating COOH-functionalized active materials due to intramolecular proton transfer, which shows potential in hydrogen adsorption engineering using proton transfer. In addition, other molecularly functionalized 2D catalysts, including MoTe2 and graphene, also show proton transfer due to the incorporation of organic moieties, providing enhanced HER performance.									13	1	0	0	2	0	13			1884-4049	1884-4057		WOS:000441204200003

Titanium electrodes coated with oxides were investigated for oxygen evolution. Experimental results showed that Ti/Pt-IrO2 electrode containing 30 mol% Pt in the coating exhibited significantly higher electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution compared to Ti/IrO2 prepared by the same method, which is also supported by the electrochemical impedance data. Stability tests demonstrated Pt-IrO2 electrocatalyst had a service cycle of 10,000 times in 0.1 M H2SO4 solution. And the anode surface had hardly discovered cracks and had compact structures, which contributed to stable nature of the electrode together with good conductivity and specific interaction between Pt and IrO2 formed during the calcination. Furthermore, the enhanced catalytic activity for 02 evolution at Ti/Pt-IrO2 electrode is preliminarily discussed using the Mott-Schottky analysis. (C) 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.

As the water electrolysis efficiency is primarily restricted by the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), intensive research efforts have been put into this field to acquire good knowledge of the reaction mechanism and obtain active, durable, and cost-effective electrocatalyst materials. Many invaluable findings have been achieved in the past years, with some problems being found in the meantime. It is good timing to summarize what have been achieved and identify what to overcome, which would be helpful to unscramble current OER research status and stimulate insightful thoughts in future studies. In this review article, we briefly introduce current understanding of OER electrocatalysis mechanism and the use of catalyst descriptor parameters for correlation with the activity property. We then summarize recent achievements on development of OER catalyst materials, which are categorized and discussed based on their morphological dimension.

A common approach to forming H-2 involves splitting water. The ability to convert water into hydrogen is limited by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is one of two half-reactions involved in this process. The present study uses quantum chemical calculations to explore the abilities of a metal (oxy)hydroxide complex containing one to three earth-abundant first-row transition metals (Co, Fe, Ni, Mn, Ti) to catalyze the OER. The calculations provide insight into the mechanistic details of this process and the impacts of the coordination environment and substituting metal atoms on the ability to catalyze the OER. The results presented are expected to provide guidance for the rational design of advanced and effective metal catalysts for OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000613198200018

In this study, we explored a facile method of depositing NiFe-LDH catalyst on pyrolytic graphite sheets (PGSs) to explore the synergistic effects at the substrate-electrocatalyst interface. The catalyst was electrodeposited on PGSs using chronoamperometry. The homogeneous distribution of the catalyst with nanosheet morphology on the PGS's surface produced an ultrathin film. The NiFe25/PGS sample showed a low overpotential (332 mV) and Tafel slope (33 mV dec(-1)). The fitting of the Nyquist plots was performed using an equivalent circuit, and the NiFe25/PGS (1.69 U) sample showed the lowest charge transfer resistance among the studied catalysts. In addition, PGS proved a better substrate for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction compared to glassy carbon and fluorine-doped tin oxide. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, we report a one-step electrodeposition strategy to prepare Ni(OH)(2) modified with Ir single-atom catalysts (SACs) (Ir SACs/Ni(OH)(2)) on an electrically conductive substrate of three dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous nickel foam (HP-NF) as efficient OER electrocatalyst. The HP-NF with abundant open pores can not only enable the full exposure of catalytically active sites but also facilitate the diffusion of electrolyte and release of gaseous oxygen produced. The optimal Ir SACs/Ni(OH)(2)@HP-NF exhibits a remarkable catalytic performance and outstanding stability for the OER activity in 1.0 M KOH alkaline media, delivering a low overpotential of similar to 223 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and a low Tafel plot of 58 mV-dec(-1). Various characterizations together with control electrochemical experiments demonstrated that the superior activity and robust stability of Ir SACs/Ni(OH)(2)@HP-NF for OER are originated from the highly distributed and exposed Ir SACs and 3D interconnected pores of HP-NF with high electric conductivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000825777200006

As the bifunctional electrocatalyst, Co-CeO2-N-C nanofibers show excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance, owing to the higher degree of graphitization of carbon, the N-doping, and the formation of an interface between Co and CeO2. The liquid Zn-air battery based on Co-CeO2-N-C nanofibers displays excellent specific capacities (815.9 mA h g(-1) at 5 mA cm(-2)), higher open circuit voltages (1.47 V), and good cycling stability (113 h). The corresponding flexible solid state Zn-air battery shows excellent cycling stability (11 h), and good flexibility.

Herein, we have prepared metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets on a nickel foam (NF) substrate via a two-step procedure including a hydrothermal reaction and an in situ transformation process. As for the anodic OER process, the obtained NiFe-MOF@NF demonstrates excellent catalytic performance with a small overpotential of 265 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and impressive long-term catalytic durability and stability without obvious deactivation. The superior electrocatalytic performance of the obtained NiFe-MOF@NF material is mainly due to the substantial active metal centres, enhanced electrical conductivity and favorable kinetics.

The as-prepared N, O-enriched hierarchical porous carbon (NPC) electrode has a high N doping content (2.67 at%), oxygen-enriched chemical structure (surface oxygen content: 21.34 at%), hierarchical pore distribution (interconnected micro-meso-macropore system), high pore volume (0.72 cm(3) g(-1)), and large specific surface area (1226 m(2) g(-1)) as well as superior electroconductibility, which is advantageous for valid electrolyte approachability and rapid ion transmission to enhance the electrosorption capacity of carbon electrodes. These characteristics provided great salt adsorption capacity (SAC, 31.9 mg g(-1)) and excellent charge efficiency (CF, 60.3%) for capacitive deionization. Meanwhile, the NPC displays bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, capable of constructing a rechargeable Zn-air battery with an open circuit voltage of 1.32 V. As a prototype integrated system, an NPC-800 constructed Zn-air battery was employed to power an NPC-800 symmetrical CDI device (denoted as a self-powered CDI system), showing comparable SAC and CF in the DC power driving mode. Furthermore, the self-powered CDI system also shows high removal efficiency for harmful heavy metal ions from water (99.1% for Pb2+ and 97.9% for Cd2+).									17	0	0	0	4	0	17			2053-1400	2053-1419		WOS:000471031500016

Under the guidance of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations that the introduction of dopants (Fe, Mn, and Ni) into CoP could promote the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances, a series of binder-free CoMxP/carbon cloth (CC; M = Fe, Mn, and Ni; x = 0, 0.05, 0.2, 0.5, and 1) were fabricated. Both experimental measurements and DFT calculations confirm the electronic modulation of dopants. DFT calculations further reveal that the modulated electronic structure promotes the electronic conductivity, favors the adsorption of key species, and consequently promotes the electrochemical performances. As predicted, the bimetallic phosphides demonstrate excellent HER performances in alkaline, acidic, and alkaline simulated seawater solutions and also deliver excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances, overwhelming the commercial RuO2. Benefiting from the modulated electronic structure and the hierarchical structure with massive CoFe0.05P zero-dimensional (OD) quantum dots anchored on two-dimensional (2D) N-doped porous carbon, CoFe0.05P delivered the best HER in four kinds of electrolytes (eta(10 )of 73 mV in an alkaline simulated seawater solution) and OER in two kinds of electrolytes (eta(10) of 264 mV in an alkaline solution) with excellent stability of 45 h in the alkaline solution. The assembled CoFe0.05P/CC//CoFe0.05P/CC with the electrodes folded by 180 degrees can still maintain a low cell potential of 1.62 V at 10 mA.cm(-2). This work proves the feasibility of the reported rational design strategy of developing efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in a wide pH range.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000837949800003

We introduce a convenient and effective sulfur heteroatom tuning strategy to optimize the performance of active Ni and Fe centers embedded into coordination polymer (CP) catalysts. Operando monitoring then provided the mechanistic understanding as to how exactly our facile sulfur engineering of Ni/Fe-CPs optimizes the local electronic structure of their active centers to facilitate dioxygen formation. The high OER activity of our optimized S-R-NiFe-CPs outperforms the most recent NiFe-based OER electrocatalysts. Specifically, we start from oxygen-deprived O-d-R-NiFe-CPs and transform them into highly active Ni/Fe-CPs with tailored sulfur coordination environments and anionic deficiencies. Our operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses reveal that sulfur introduction into our designed S-R-NiFe-CPs facilitates the formation of crucial highly oxidized Ni4+ and Fe4+ species, which generate oxygen-bridged Ni-IV-O-Fe-IV moieties that act as the true OER active intermediates. The advantage of our sulfur-doping strategy for enhanced OER is evident from comparison with sulfur-free O-d-R-NiFe-CPs, where the formation of essential high-valent OER intermediates is hindered. Moreover, we propose a dual-site mechanism pathway, which is backed up with a combination of pH-dependent performance data and DFT calculations. Computational results support the benefits of sulfur modulation, where a lower energy barrier enables O-O bond formation atop the S-Ni-IV-O-Fe-IV-O moieties. Our convenient anionic tuning strategy facilitates the formation of active oxygen-bridged metal motifs and can thus promote the design of flexible and low-cost OER electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000858908300001	36069492

Dicyclohexyl carbodiimide, a specific inhibitor of ATPase, inhibited O2 evolution as this process involved ATP hydrolysis. Cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone, an uncoupler, abolished O2 evolution by breakdown of the active energy dependent transport of nitrate and nitrite and of the proton gradient. NH4Cl, methylamine and hydroxylamine inhibited O2 evolution by acting as bases and cleaving high energy bonds. EDTA combined with the metal ions that were required for oxygen evolution, synthesis-of photosynthetic units and photophosphorylation. This resulted in the blockage of the nitrate and nitrite photoreduction coupled to O2 evolution by preventing transfer of electrons from water and reductant for nitrate and nitrite reduction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0011-3891			WOS:A1993LQ65600023

Thus, efficient water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) based on abundant elements are attracting lots of scientific and technological interest, where active site engineering and a conductivity optimization approach are being used in the quest for the "ideal catalyst." The recent advancements in the design of molecular and oxide/hydroxide WOCs, as well as hybrid derivatives and composite materials are the scope of this chapter. The choices and tuning of relevant structural and electronic parameters are fundamental for molecular and hybrid materials, and the isomorphic substitution in, and doping of bimetallic and trimetallic oxide/hydroxides, are paving the way to high performance WOCs.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0898-8838	1557-8917	978-0-12-816082-4	WOS:000501573300007

Catalyst design of delafossite oxides for water electrolysis anode using theoretical calculations								ECS Transactions				66	33			1	5		10.1149/06633.0001ecst				2015	2015	Understanding the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for improving the performance of water electrolysis. Delafossite oxides (ABO2) were investigated for their potential as OER catalysts using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The relationship between the calculated t2g occupancy of the B site and the experimentally-determined OER activity was examined. Our examination suggests that t2g electrons of the B site can be significant for the OER process. The calculated t2g occupancy is approximately linearly related to OER activity. Thus, we propose that t2g occupancy can be employed as a simple descriptor of the OER activity of delafossite oxide catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1938-5862			INSPEC:15891077

The photoactivity of these materials should be enhanced through shape-controlled particles and nanostructuring; however, facile syntheses to high fidelity shape control are rare. Here, the syntheses of porous Ta3N5 nanoplates and octahedra are reported through nitridation of aerosol-prepared template particles. Specifically, amorphous nanoplates and octahedra with a nominal composition of Ta2O5 were prepared selectively by aerosol-assisted molten salt syntheses (AMSS) through the use of different fluxes. The amorphous nature of the products from AMSS is surprising given their defined shape, yet the use of these templates decreased the nitridation time to Ta3N5 compared to most reports, resulting in a product with fewer surface defects. Moreover, the structure-controlled Ta3N5 samples yielded enhanced photocatalytic performances for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared to structurally ill-defined Ta3N5. Significantly, other metal oxynitrides or nitrides with defined nanoscale features and enhanced photoactivity should be possible through this synthetic approach.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000378102400055

However, there are few examples of electrocatalytic water oxidation with metal telluride as catalysts, especially Fe-based telluride, to the best of our knowledge, has not yet been reported. In this work, the Te-doped Fe-based catalysts (FeTex) with crystalline and amorphous nanosheet structures have been successfully synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) as well as electrodeposition (ED) on the iron foam (IF), where the latter exhibited more remarkable electrocatalytic performance towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the alkaline electrolyte, requiring the overpotential (eta) of only 264.4 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 54.2 mV dec(-1). The electrochemical study confirmed that the residual Te in ED-FeTex does play a role in promoting the catalytic activity for the electrocatalytic water oxidation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2365-6549			WOS:000674320500040

Cobalt-based oxides and sulfides have been actively investigated due to their low cost and high activity. However, the lower intrinsic conductivity of cobalt oxide and the inferior stability of cobalt sulfides still limit their practical application. Herein, CoO was chosen for a proof-of-concept study in which the anion-doping strategy was used to obtain an excellent catalyst. Sulfur incorporation optimizes the charge-transfer properties and active sites of sulfur-doped CoO (S-CoO) and thus gives rise to improved catalytic activity. Besides sulfur doping, the stable framework of the cobalt oxide was well maintained, and thus high stability of S-CoO throughout the reaction process was ensured.									34	3	0	0	1	0	34			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000451233400018	30211962

Herein, by changing the reaction conditions, we prepared a unique rod-like bimetallic CoFe selenite with different exposure of crystal facets via a surfactant-free hydrothermal method. Then, via in situ calcination under N-2 atmosphere at different temperatures, the optimal calcined sample, namely NC4FS-350, showed excellent OER performance of 235 mV@10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 56.1 mV dec(-1) on a glassy carbon electrode, which should be ascribed to its abundant activity sites and improved instinct activity from its improved electronic conductivity, faster mass transfer and electrolyte diffusion, derived from the unique chemical composition and amorphous mesoporous structure. This study provides an efficient strategy to design and develop earth abundant electrocatalysts in the field of energy storage and conversion.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000662329200001

The obtained Co9S8@MoS2 nanohybrids were composed of Co9S8, MoS2, Co-Mo-S phases and assembled nanosheets, and therefore were explored as trifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in an alkaline medium. The nanostructure and chemical components of the series of Co9S8@MoS2 nanohybrids can be modulated by changing the mole ratios of H8Mo12O41P to Co(NO3)(2) precursor. Compared with the sole component and other reported Co9S8@MoS2 nanohybrids, the Co9S8@MoS2 nanohybrid prepared from the 1:1 ratio of PMo12 and Co(NO3)(2) exhibited superior MOR catalysis efficiency (121.4 mA cm(-2)) and an extremely low overpotential (1.49 V) for overall water splitting at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) owning to the effective synergism among Co9S8, MoS2, and Co-Mo-S phase. Overall, this study provides a feasible approach to developing efficient and stable trifunctional bimetal electrocatalysts for clean-energy applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Using a highly hydrated iridium oxide film allows the maximum number of Ir sites to be involved in the electrochemical processes occurring at the catalysts during water oxidation (oxygen evolution reaction, OER). X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectra clearly indicate the co-existence of Ir(III) and Ir(V) at the electrode potentials where OER occurs.

In this work, we prepared a three-dimensional (3D) CoFe-based zemannite-type selenite (KCFS) via in situ transformation of CoFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) as both the precursor and template. The as-prepared CoFe-selenite affords low overpotential in 1.0 M KOH on glass carbon electrode (eta@ 10 mA cm(-2) = 274 mV) with Tafel slope of 45.6 mV dec(-1), indicating rapid kinetics, in addition, keeps high current density around 10 mA/cm(2) at least 50 h when applied voltage of 1.51 V. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of KCFS could be mainly attributed to its unique zeolite structure and compositions with bimetallic centres and SeO3 oxyanion, besides, it exhibits nanoellipsoid rough-surface morphology and hierarchical pores, which is beneficial to the enhanced exposure of the active sites, as well as the mass/charge transport and the electrolyte diffusion.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000572062200003

To address this problem, the use of redox mediators has been proposed, which are supposed to improve the sluggish reaction kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction via a solution mediated oxidation of lithium peroxide. In this study, we present a new thin layer cell for battery related differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) experiments, which exhibits a high electrode surface area to electrolyte volume ratio which is closer to the situation in batteries other approaches/cells with their usually large electrolyte excess. The confined volume also allows a better distinction between the mediating activity of a redox system and a near continuous electrochemical reaction of this species. One further benefit of the new thin layer cell is that experiments can easily be performed under different O-2-partial pressures. This new set-up allows the highly sensitive detection of volatile species formed during the OER. Therefore, small changes in the number of electrons transferred per oxygen molecule are observable. These changes help to identify side reactions and possible decomposition of the reaction products. During our experiments, we investigated the impact of TTF, TMPD, Fc and TEMPO on the oxidation of Li2O2. Within our experiments, we are able to precisely determine the potential at which the catalytic activity of the redox mediation starts. A comparison between the potential at which we observe the activity of the redox mediator to the half wave potential of the redox system could be explained with an outer sphere electron transfer for the oxidation of Li2O2 by a redox mediator. This observation is confirmed by a theoretical treatment of the redox mediation mechanism. Moreover, insights into the number of transferred electrons per oxygen molecule during the activity of the different redox mediators reveal the presence of side reactions. This finding is also underlined by an unexpected shift of the CO2 evolution onset for the redox mediator containing electrolytes. Our experiments also reveal that a Li-O-2 cell, which contains a redox mediator, undergoes less fluctuation in its reversibility compared to a cell without a redox mediator.									19	2	0	0	0	0	19			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000443280900023	30087964

The catalyst can reach current density of 10 mA cm-2 at low overpotentials of 248.2, and 56.1 mV for oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively. The catalyst also shows very low potential of 1.32 V for urea oxidation reaction at 10 mA cm-2. A water electrolyzer that achieves current density of 10 mA cm-2 at small cell voltage of 1.45 V is prepared under action of the developed catalyst. We also conduct urea electrolysis assembled with the catalyst and find that the device requires a cell voltage of only 1.35 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, proving the great potential of our catalyst for simultaneous energy-saving H2 production and the treatment of urea-rich wastewater.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000800383100002

In this research, we integrate the melamine-assisted alkaline cobalt carbonate (CoCH) nanosheets pyrolysis with high-temperature solid phase fusion to construct the 1-C3N4/Co3O4/Ni foam hybrid electrode with Co3O4 ultrathin porous nanosheets as the host, trace C3N4 as the guest, and Ni foam (NF) as the current collector. Benefiting from the unique structure, the obtained 1-C3N4/Co3O4 hybrid nanosheets can significantly reduce the charge transfer distance between the catalysts to electron collector and improve the electron transportation during the OER process. Moreover, the intimate interaction of Co3O4 with C3N4 can induce a charge redistribution at the interface. Consequently, the 1-C3N4/Co3O4NF hybrid electrode exhibits an enhanced OER performance (166 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2)) and good stability, superior to the commercial RuO2 particles and the reported transition metal-based electrocatalysts.

The present work focused on comparing the performance of different carbonaceous cathodes materials,including graphite plate,graphite felt,carbon felt,active carbon felt (ACF),carbon fiber electrode (carbon fiber fabric (CFF),and carbon fiber brush (CFB)) using Ru-Ir DSA as an anode. For simulated Reactive Red X-3B dyeing residual liquids,it was found that carbonaceous cathodes materials could achieve a complete decolorization and the degradation of Reactive Red X-3B followed the first-order kinetics. Using CFF cathode,the removal of COD_(Cr) of dyeing residual liquid was 86. 37%. The first-order kinetic reaction constant on CFF cathode was 0. 0103 min-1,1. 4 folds of that on carbon felt cathode (0. 0073 min-1). Comparing to the graphite plate cathode,the CFB cathode exhibited excellent efficacy for 2e- oxygen reduction reaction and H_2O_2 generation capacity,leading to the degradation of Reactive Red X-3B. The H_2O_2 generation per area of CFB cathode was 10. 40 mumol/L,which was 9. 7 folds of that of graphite plate cathode (1. 08 mumol/L). Based on CV examination,the oxygen evolution potential of carbon fiber electrodes,including CFF and CFB,was found to be higher than the other cathodes used in this work,which favors the inhibition of oxygen evolution and improves electro catalytic efficiency. The results of this study show that carbon fiber cathode with desirable stability may have potential industrial applications in dyeing residual liquid treatment.			为实现染色残液的高效处理及废水回用,鉴于染色残液良好的导电性,选用电化学处理技术,以模拟活性红X-3B染色残液为研究对象,在钌铱形稳电极为阳极和合适的电解条件下,比较石墨板、石墨毡、炭毡、ACF(活性炭纤维毡)、碳纤维电极〔CFF(碳纤维布)、CFB(碳纤维刷)〕等碳素阴极材料的电化学处理效能.结果表明:碳素阴极材料可实现染色残液的完全脱色,活性红X-3B的降解过程符合一级反应动力学特征,其中CFF为阴极时COD_(Cr)去除率达到86. 37%,一级动力学反应常数为0. 010 3 min-1,是石墨毡(0. 007 3 min-1)的1. 4倍.相比于石墨板电极,CFB显示出优异的二电子氧还原和产H_2O_2能力,单位面积产H_2O_2的浓度为10. 40 mumol/L,是石墨板(1. 08 mumol/L)的9. 7倍,产生的H_2O_2导致活性红X-3B的降解, 30 min内实现完全脱色.循环伏安曲线表明,碳纤维电极(包括CFF和CFB)的析氧电位明显高于其他电极,可有效抑制析氧副反应,提高有机污染物降解过程中的电催化效率,有利于降低能耗.研究显示,碳纤维可作为阴极材料应用于电化学处理染色残液,具有良好的稳定性.						0	2	0	0	0	0	2			1001-6929			CSCD:6391460

Herein, a heterostructure consisting of Ni2P and Ni3S2 supported on commercial nickel foam (Ni3S2-Ni2P/NF) was prepared through the conversion of some Ni3S2 molecules into Ni2P by phosphorization engineering. Electrochemical tests revealed that the partial phosphorization of Ni3S2 effectively enhanced the catalytic activity of the host electrocatalyst towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M KOH; in particular, the Ni3S2-Ni2P/NF electrode exhibited the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at the very low OER overpotential of 287 mV and needed the low overpotential of 130 mV to afford 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER. Moreover, the alkaline electrolyzer assembled by two Ni3S2-Ni2P/NF electrodes could deliver 10 mA cm(-2) at the low voltage of 1.58 V and exhibited excellent durability during electrolysis for 15 h. Therefore, our study opens up an attractive fabrication strategy for highly active heterostructure electrocatalysts.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000484986900036	31451822

The titanium hydride was prepared through the reaction between electrolyzed titanium and hydrogen at different hydrogenation temperatures and different time. The evolutions of hydrogen and oxygen contents, density, hardness and phase composition before and after hydrogenation were characterized under different hydrogenation conditions. The results show that the main phases of titanium hydride were TiH1.924, TiH1.971 and TiH2. Increasing the hydrogenation temperature could not enhance the hydrogen content but increase the oxygen content. The effect of the hydrogenation time on the hydrogen content was not obvious. The optimal parameters of the hydrogenation process were obtained: heating at 400 degrees C and holding for 2 h, by which the hydrogen content of 3.63% and oxygen content of 0.18% (mass fraction) can be obtained. In addition, the microstructure, orientations and tissues of electrolyzed titanium and titanium hydride were detected.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000377880800029

Based on our previous findings that short H-bonding on reconstructed beta(II)-Li2CoSiO4 (LCS) nanocrystal surface to enhance OER activity by facilitating proton transfer/dissociation and an electronic push/pull effect of Co and Fe doping on OER performance of Ni-based hydroxides, here we report both combination of Fe-Co synergistic effect with charge transfer and short H-bonding on Li2CoxFe1-xSiO4 (LCxF1-xS, 0 < x < 1) nanocatalyst surface can further enhance OER performances of water splitting. Especially, LiC0.5F0.5S exhibits superior OER activity and super-long term stability (no fade after 10,000 CV cycles, high temperature of 80 degrees C, and 100 h OER measurement at a low overpotential of 0.3 V with high current density of 80 mA cm(-2)). Insight of the ultrahigh OER performance of LC0.5F0.5S is suggested to attribute to the short H-bonding formed on the constructed surface and the synergistic coupling effect between Fe and Co with charge transfer, which leads to favorable electronic structure of TM active sites, promotes proton out of the oxygen on Co site and generates H2O on Fe site by proton transfer.									21	3	0	0	1	0	21			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000463032200048

In this Research Article, a new bifunctional oxygen catalyst has been developed through embedding the ultrafine NiFeO nanoparticles (NPs) in a porous amorphous MnOx layer, in which the NiFeO-core contributes to the high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the amorphous MnOx-shell functions as active phase for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), promoted by the synergistic effect between the NiFeO core and MnOx shell. The synergistic effect is related to the electron drawing of NiFeO core from MnOx shell, which decreases the affinity and adsorption energy of oxygen on MnOx shell and significantly increases the kinetics of ORR The electrocatalytic activity and durability of NiFeO-MnOx depends strongly on the NiFeO:MnOx ratio. NiFeO@MnOx with NiFeO:MnOx weight ratio of 1:0.8 shows the best performance for reversible ORR and OER, with a potential gap (Delta E) of 0.792 V to achieve a current density of 3 mA cm(-2) for ORR (EORR=3) and S mA cm(-2) for OER (E-OER=5) in 0.1 M KOH solution. The high activity of the NiFeOg MnOx(1:0.8) has been demonstrated in a Zn-air battery. Zn-air battery fabricated using the NiFeO@MnOx(1:0.8) oxygen electrode shows similar initial performance with that of Pt-Ir/C oxygen electrode but a much better durability under charge and discharge cycles as the result of the structure confinement effect of amorphous MnOx. The results demonstrate NiFeO@MnO, as an effective bifunctional oxygen catalysts for rechargeable metal-air batteries.									65	3	0	0	1	0	67			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000396186000029	28207229

Owing to the maximum atom-utilization efficiency and unique electronic and geometric structures, single atom catalysts (SACs) have exhibited superior performance in various catalytic systems. Recently, assembled from the functionalized organic linkers and metal nodes, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with ultrafine porosity have received tremendous attention as precursors or self-sacrificing templates for preparing porous SACs. Here, the recent advances toward the synthesis strategies for using MOF precursors/templates to construct SACs are systematically summarized with special emphasis on the types of central metal sites. The electrochemical applications of these recently emerged MOF-derived SACs for various energy-conversion processes, such as oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), are also discussed and reviewed.

In this design, the final catalyst possesses a combination of the high conductivity of graphene, great surface porosity, and the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of the F0.25CP-G which results in high-performance electrocatalytic activity toward the HER and OER. Therefore, the as-synthesized F0.25CP-G catalyst can achieve overpotentials of 66 mV and 230 mV for the HER and OER, respectively, in KOH at 10 mA cm(-2).

The facile methodology developed here avoids the traditionally hydrothermal treatment and the complex exfoliation procedure. The as-prepared etched CoMn-LDHs of similar to 9.3 nm exhibit excellent performance in the oxygen evolution reaction, whereas the etched CoMn-LDHs display a reduction of 150 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) compared to the state-of-the-art RuO2 in 0.1M NaOH. Besides, the etched CoMn-LDHs display much smaller Tafel slope and resistance than that of non-etched CoMn-LDHs. Compared with the traditional method, the as-developed in-situ chemical etching is much more efficient with additional advantages of producing highly active sites. More importantly, density functional theory (DFT) has confirmed the experimental results and documented that the much enhanced electrocatalytic activity of thin CoMn-LDHs is associated with a nearly optimal intermediates (*OH and *O) adsorption energy.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000463008200030

Herein, a facile one-step chemical etching strategy is provided for fabricating one-dimensional hierarchical nanorods array composed of CoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH)/metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) supported on carbon cloth as efficient and stable OER and UOR catalysts. By precisely controlling the etching rate, the ligands from Co-MOFs are partially removed, the corresponding metal centers then coordinate with hydroxyl ions to generate ultrathin amorphous CoFe LDH nanosheets. The resultant CoFe LDH/MOFs catalyst possesses large active surface area, enhanced conductivity and extended electron/mass transfer channels, which are beneficial for catalytic reactions. Additionally, the intimate contact between CoFe LDH and MOFs modulates the local electronic structure of the catalytic active site, leading to enhanced adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates to facilitate fast electrocatalytic reaction. As a result, the optimized CoFe LDH/MOF-0.06 exhibits superior OER activity with a low overpotential of 276 at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with long-term durability. Additionally, it merely requires a voltage of 1.45 V to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution with 0.33 urea and is 56 mV lower than the one in pure KOH. The work presented here may hew out a brand-new route to construct multi-functional electrocatalysts for water splitting, CO2 reduction, nitrogen reduction reactions and so on.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000669092400001	34130269

Herein, we have reported bimetallic cobalt iron oxide (CoFe2O4) with a nanosphere structure as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for OER. Benefiting from the unique mesoporous structure, the as-synthesized CoFe(2)O(4)nanospheres presented superior electrochemical properties to those of the corresponding monometallic Fe3O4, Co3O4, and even commercial RuO2. As a result, the overpotential of the CoFe(2)O(4)electrocatalyst was only 275 mV up to 10 mA cm(-2)and a Tafel slope of 58.6 mV dec(-1)was obtained. Besides, there was negligible variation between the LSV curves obtained before and after conducting 4000 cycles, testifying the outstanding long-term stability.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1466-8033			WOS:000543912100013		
J	Gu, Qinyang; Wu, Wei; Jin, Baosheng; Zhou, Zheng								Analyses for Synthesis Gas from Municipal Solid Waste Gasification under Medium Temperatures								PROCESSES				8	1					84	10.3390/pr8010084				JAN 2020	2020	Municipal solid waste (MSW) gasification could be a novel method that shows the various advantages over traditional MSW treatments in China. Other research concluded that MSW gasification was operating by the assistant heat, and the gasification may occur under medium temperature. So, this study is aimed to investigate MSW gasification and pyrolysis behavior and analyze the syngas evolution and reaction mechanism. The MSW samples were collected in daily life and the experiments were carried out in a fixed tubular reactor below 650 degrees C. The effects of medium temperature and oxygen content on syngas quality were elucidated in depth. The results have shown that temperature can promote the syngas quality in the range of 550-650 degrees C, because the increasing temperature strengthens the reaction rate. The oxygen content should be controlled in a certain range, or oxidation reactions will be more prominent during gasification. The optimal gasification condition in this study was obtained at 650 degrees C and an oxygen concentration of 1.25%, the combustible gas yield and the lower heating value (LHV) of syngas of this condition were 0.296 L/g and 10.98 kJ/L, respectively. This study provides insights for MSW gasification under medium temperature, and a practical gasification system can be designed under a certain condition.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				2227-9717		WOS:000516825300073

However, the performance of existing electrocatalysts is usually restricted by the low electroic conductivity and the limited amount of exposed active sites. In this work, (Fe0.2Ni0.8)(0.96)S tubular spheres supported on Ni foam have been prepared by a sulfuration of FeNi layered double hydroxide spheres grown on Ni foam. Benefiting from the unique tubular sphere architecture, the rich inner defects and the enhanced electron interactions between Fe, Ni and S, this electrocatalyst shows low overpotential of 48 mV for HER at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 mol L-1KOH solution, which is one of the lowest value of non-previous electrocatalyts for HER in alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, assembled this versatile electrode as an alkaline electrolyzer for overall water splitting, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved at a low cell voltage of 1.56V, and reach up to 30 mA cm(-2) only at an operating cell voltage of 1.65V.									30	1	0	0	4	0	30			2045-2322			WOS:000435790500004	29930378

To evaluate the effect of the pore channel size on battery performance, we employed OMCs possessing two different pore sizes (6 and 17 nm). When cycled at a current density of 200 mA g(carbon)(-1), the OMC electrodes reduced polarization in the oxygen evolution reaction by 0.1 V compared to those consisting of conventional super P carbon electrode. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy of the discharged oxygen electrodes provided evidence for the formation of amorphous Li2O2, a product of the oxygen reduction reaction, inside the OMC pores rather than on the electrode surface as in the case of the super P electrode. The OMC electrodes were also effective at high current densities (500 mA g(carbon)(-1) and 1000 mA g(carbon)(-1)).									60	6	0	0	2	0	64			1944-8244			WOS:000329137400085	24236914

In this work, we developed transition metal cation doping strategy into the alpha-MnO2 tunnel structure to tune the Mn oxidation states and control the uniform nanowire morphology, crystalline structure to investigate the effect of doping over bifunctional activity. The single Ni2+ cation doping in alpha-MnO2 with various loading concentrations resulted in 8Ni-MnO2 exhibiting remarkable OER and ORR activity owing to their excessive concentration of Mn3+ and Mn4+ octahedral sites respectively. Further, Co2+ cation doping in 8Ni-MnO2 leads to an enhanced synergistic effect that significantly improves the fraction of Mn3+ quantity which is confirmed by average oxidation state. For electrochemical OER performance, 8Co-8Ni-MnO2 exhibits a potential of 1.77 V, Tafel slope value of 68 mV dec(-1) and lower charge transfer resistance and it is active in ORR with more positive onset potential of 0.90 V, half-wave potential of 0.80 V, better current density (4.7 mA cm(-2)) and a four-electron pathway. Moreover, bifunctional activity (Delta E=E-OER@10 mA cm(-2) - ORR@E-1/2) of 8Co-8Ni-MnO2 demonstrated 0.97 V, indicates an excellent activity in alkaline electrolyte solution.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000747395000023

However, a high voltage gap between charge and discharge significantly limits the round-trip efficiency and cycle stability of Li-O-2 batteries. In the present work, mesoporous Co3O4 is simply prepared and studied as a catalyst in Li-O-2 cells. The Co3O4 nanoparticles possesses a high specific surface area and a spinel crystalline structure. Cyclic Voltammetries demonstrate that mesoporous Co3O4 catalyst enhances the kinetics for either oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Such excellent catalytic performance of Co3O4 could be associated with its larger surface area and 3D ordered mesoporous structure. The electrode with mesoporous Co3O4 exhibits a higher discharge capacity and lowers the over-potential for discharge process, compared with the pure carbon electrode. In Li-O-3 cells, the Co3O4 cathodes show enhanced electrochemical performances, including a high round-trip efficiency and a prolonged cycle life. More than 65 stable cycles are observed with a Co3O4-catalyzed electrode, which could be attributed to the low recharge voltage, at which main side reactions due to decomposition of TEGDME-based electrolyte can be suppressed.

Constructing N-doped carbon shells coordinated with transitional metal composites can greatly enhance the OER activity of electrocatalysts. Herein, a facile electrochemical-pyrolysis strategy is applied to synthesize NiS/C3N4 composite with NNi-S coordination sites by in-situ crystallization on copper foam (CF). A detailed characterization, especially synchrotron-based X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) clearly unravels the N-Ni-S coordination mode is successfully formed. As a result, NiS/C3N4 presents excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 334 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1), and robust electrochemical stability for 50 h in basic media, outperforming some recently reported conventional transitional metal electrocatalysts. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of NiS/C3N4 mainly originates from the N-Ni-S coordination sites, which can provide abundant catalytic active sites, facilitate charge transfer, and enhance electronic conductivity. Furthermore, by tuning the two important experimental parameters of electrodeposition potential and electropolymerization time, the relationship between morphology and electrocatalytic performance of catalysts is deeply explored. This work demonstrates the validity of improving electrocatalytic performance by elaborately tailoring the coordination sites, thereby opening up an applicable and inspiring avenue forward in the design of advanced electrocatalysts for water splitting.									16	1	0	0	2	0	16			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000626518400004

The use of selective catalysts for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) that sparingly reduce oxygen on the anode could significantly reduce the carbon corrosion on the cathode. Herein, we report a novel system of carbon supported Pt/TiOx, catalysts that combines the unique properties of a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) with the known advantages of a carbon support. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy of the selective catalyst shows the encapsulation of the Pt nanoparticles (NPs) by a TiOx layer resulting from the SMSI. Rotating disk electrode experiments confirmed that Pt oxidation and oxygen reduction are hindered due to the TiOx layer. Furthermore, a high HOR activity that is retained even at high potentials proved the superior HOR selectivity of the catalyst.									24	3	0	0	1	0	24			2574-0962			WOS:000483434700024

However, developing OER electrocatalysts with high activity and excellent stability at a high current density remains a considerable challenge. Herein, a facile room-temperature-stirring strategy is described to obtain FeCoNi layered double hydroxide nanocages (FeCoNi-LDHs) using a metal-organic framework as a precursor. The FeCoNi-LDHs have hollow features, while their walls are assembled with ultrathin layered hydroxide nanosheets. By designing a unique structure and tuning the composition, high activity and robust long-term stability of the FeCoNi-LDHs for the OER outperform IrO2, used as the reference catalyst. The as-obtained high electrochemically active surface area and the decreased transfer resistance are ascribed to the significantly improved activity. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the introduction of Fe can fine-tune the electronic structure and decrease the Gibbs free energy difference of the rate-determining step (Delta G(3)), improving the intrinsic activity of FeCoNi-LDHs toward the OER. Furthermore, the proposed room-temperature-stirring strategy can be easily scaled up to more than 10 grams of nanocages through a single batch reaction process, demonstrating the large-scale applicability of the catalysts.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000719134000001

Microporous CoFe-200 and microporous/mesoporous CoFe-550 structures of the CoFe catalysts (CoFe-PBA) were produced by calcination for 1 h in N(2)at 200 degrees C or 550 degrees C, respectively. The electrocatalytic activities of the CoFe catalysts produced for the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER/ORR) were studied in alkaline media. The OER measurements revealed the CoFe-200 catalyst to be superior to CoFe-PBA and CoFe-550, and even surpass the activity of commercial Ir/C in terms of the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2)and onset potential (EonsetOER). On the other hand, the ORR activity of CoFe-550 exhibited a more positive half-wave potential (0.837 V vs. RHE) andEonsetORR(0.942 V vs. RHE) than CoFe-200. The Tafel slope (-55.9 mV dec(-1)) of CoFe-550 was lower than that of Pt/C (-77.8 mV dec(-1)). A comparison of CoFe-200 and CoFe-550 suggested that the microporosity of CoFe-200 (average pore diameter,d <= 2 nm) was beneficial in terms of the OER. In contrast, the mesoporous (d approximate to 35.6 nm) structure of CoFe-550 promoted the mass-transport kinetics of oxygen through the electrode surface. CoFe nanocubes with tunable porosity are potential catalysts that can be utilized selectively for the OER and ORR.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			2196-0216			WOS:000548148100001

Reversible electrochemical reduction of Cu-pPc and Co-pPc was observed and monitored by cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemical investigations. Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry in the positive voltage range led to anodic currents in the oxygen evolution reaction that could be performed at stable current densities and showed a remarkable efficiency in particular for electrodes of Co-pPc in this reaction, attractive for the conversion of electrical energy into chemical energy.									6	0	1	0	0	0	6			1088-4246	1099-1409		WOS:000390248600032

The potentiostatic electroformation of PbO2 can be mainly interpreted as an instantaneous nucleation and two-dimensional growth mechanism under charge transfer control associated with the beta-PbO2 phase generation. From the parametric identification procedure of the whole set of potentiostatic current transients and the corresponding potential dependence of the fit parameters, reasonable values of the physicochemical constants included in the reaction model have been obtained. Reaction and system modelling also take into account the contribution of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics on the top and edges of beta-PbO2 growth centres at high overpotentials.

Controlling the Co3+/Co2+ ratios of cobalt sulfide can tune its electronic structure and further optimize its catalytic performance. Herein, the CoSx/CNT (carbon nanotube) nano composites with various Co3+/Co2+ ratios were designed and prepared by different sulfurization strategies. The CoSx/CNT-700 with the highest Co3+/Co2+ ratio exhibits the most excellent OER electrocatalytic activity in 1 M KOH, including a low overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 71.9 mV dec(-1). The experimental results indicate that tuning the Co3+/Co2+ ratios can improve the OER catalytic activity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0167-577X	1873-4979		WOS:000793230900009

Powders obtained by a proteic sol-gel method were systematically studied using a variety of characterization techniques. Rietveld refinement from XRD data revealed that there was no change in the crystalline structure of the doped cobaltites. Electrochemical analyses showed that the performance of the catalysts decreases with increasing the amount of Cu. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that the polarization resistance (R-p) increases with the degree of doping, harming the kinetics of faradaic processes in OER. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In the presence of oxygen, a poorly conductive layer of Ni(OH)(2) is formed early because of oxygen reduction which occurs prior to nickel deposition. The surface Ni(OH)(2) inhibits the first charge transfer reaction of Ni2+ to active intermediate (categorically represented by Ni(OH)(ads)), and subsequently diminishes the nucleation and growth of nickel. The effect is more pronounced in region with little hydrogen evolution. Surface flakes characteristic of uninhibited nickel deposition are clearly absent in the scanning electron micrographs of deposits. The current efficiency of nickel deposition is slightly increased in the presence of oxygen. It is also round that the oxygen effect is more effective in 0.1 M NiCl2. This is due to the fact that uninhibited deposition of nickel and hydrogen evolution, which are promoted by high and low Ni2+ concentration respectively, are less efficient than oxygen effect at an intermediate concentration level.									44	1	0	0	6	0	44			0013-4686			WOS:A1995RJ25900010

Inspired by the Lego game, hierarchical CdP2-CDs-CoP nanoarrays were fabricated by combining negatively charged carbon quantum dots (CDs) with positively charged Co and Cd ions. Because of the low evaporation temperature of Cd and relatively high solubility product (K-sp) of Cd(OH)(2), trace CdP2 is trapped on the surface of CdP2-CDs-CoP nanoarrays. When coupled with CDs, CdP2 enriches the defects and active sites of catalysts. The CdP2-CDs-CoP nanoarray, as a robust OER electrocatalyst, delivers an overpotential of 285 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), demonstrating its superiority over commercial RuO2.									20	2	0	0	0	0	20			2168-0485			WOS:000613726300025

Here, a series of accurately morphology-regulated electrocatalysts (including nanosheets, nanoflowers, nanotubes and aggregations) derived from Hofmann-type metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are reported for efficient OER. Among all the nanostructures, FeNi nanosheets show the best OER catalytic performance in alkaline media, achieving a low overpotential of 248 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), an ultra-small Tafel slope of 31.2 mV dec(-1)and a satisfactory stability, greatly outperforming the commercial RuO(2)catalyst. The reason is that FeNi nanosheets possess optimized conductivity, oxygen vacancies and N-related active sites. Our research also demonstrates that electron transfer can be achieved through the precise control of the morphology of precursor MOFs.									103	3	1	0	3	0	103			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000569873400030

In this study, a rationally designed 3D Ru/RuO2@N-rGO hierarchical porous heterocatalyst containing abundant interfaces was obtained via a hydrothermal-calcining strategy for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In the synthesis process, polypyrrole helped the self-assembled GO to form a hybrid aerogel network, in situ reducing the Ru salt as reductant and doping graphene as N precursor. CO2, which was in situ produced via the reaction between Na2SO4 and C, could partially or totally oxidize metal Ru to regulate the composition of Ru/RuO2 nanoparticles. Benefiting from the large surface area and a high number of bifunctional active sites coupled interfaces, the as-obtained Ru/RuO2@N-rGO heterostructure catalyst revealed high HER/OER activities in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions, respectively. The present work could provide a way to engineer Ru/RuO2 nanoparticles in 3D electrocatalysts to boost HER/OER performances.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27			2574-0970			WOS:000603402500063

The numerous combinatorial substitutions of perovskite oxides provide rich choices of candidates but pose a great challenge to examine all the possibilities both experimentally and computationally. Inspired by the data-driven materials design approach, we proposed a surface center-environment (SCE) feature model and developed first-principles based machine learning (ML) methods to predict the adsorption free energies of intermediate species (HO*, O*, and HOO*) on the surfaces of perovskite oxides and their overpotentials, critical to evaluating the catalytic performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The SCE feature models contain the elementary properties of substitution elements and the structure information of the perovskite surfaces, demonstrated as an effective description of catalytic reactions on surface in ML models. The ML models predicted that the perovskite oxides adsorb the intermediate species most easily when B = Nb, Mo, Ta, W, and Os, and their overpotentials are low when B = Mn, Fe, Co, Ru, Rh, and Ir. This work demonstrated that the machine learning methods based on SCE features can be applied to describe surface chemical reactions and accelerate the screening for potential perovskite catalysts with target properties.									10	0	0	0	0	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000566336000010

The reversible oxygen reduction/evolution process is activated at voltages as low as 3-4 V and the degree of transformation increases linearly with applied bias. The irreversible processes associated with static surface deformation become apparent above 10-12 V. Post-mortem focused-ion milling combined with atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy is used to establish the mechanisms of irreversible transformations and attribute it to amorphization of the top layer of material. These studies both establish the framework for probing irreversible electrochemical processes in solids and illustrate rich spectrum of electrochemical transformations underpinning electrocatalytic activity in cobaltites.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1614-6832			WOS:000319888000015

Herein, using the hydrothermal method, ultrathin Ni/Co bimetallic metal-organic framework nanobelts that can be directly adopted as highly efficient electrocatalysts are prepared. The optimized Ni/Co ultrathin nanobelts can reach an onset potential of 0.939 V [these values are very close to those of Pt/C (0.940 V)] and show superior stability relative to that of Pt/C toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Additionally, under the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the Ni/Co ultrathin nanobelts show the potential of 1.478 V for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is much better than that of IrO2, indicating the large potential of the metal-organic frameworks as a bifunctional oxygen catalyst in metal-air batteries. In addition, after OER and ORR, the color of the Ni/Co ultrathin nanobelts sample is slightly lighter, and it can be seen that the channel becomes blurred but still exists. The X-ray diffraction, infrared spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results for Ni/Co ultrathin nanobelts before and after catalysis are basically identical. The findings suggest that the ultrathin belt-like structure and the synergy effect between Ni and Co are crucial for tuning the electrocatalytic activity.									67	5	0	0	5	0	67			2366-9608			WOS:000452615800004

Co3O4 films prepared by the UPED method show a more uniform structure on carbon rod and higher catalytic activity than those by other methods, and oxygen evolution reaction over it with an overpotential of 275 +/- 2.3 mV results in a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH.

Here, we synthesized low-cost Fe-based nanocomposites via an electrical wire pulse process, as a hybrid electrocatalyst for the oxygen electrode of Li-O-2 batteries. Fe3O4-Fe nanohybrids-containing electrodes exhibited a high discharge capacity (13,890 mA h g(c)(-1) at a current density of 500 mA g(c)(-1)), long cycle stability (100 cycles at a current rate of 500 mA g(c)(-1) and fixed capacity regime of 1,000 mA h g(c)(-1)), and low overpotential (1.39 V at 40 cycles). This superior performance resulted from the good electrical conductivity of the Fe metal nanoparticles during discharge-charge cycling, which could enhance the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activities. We have demonstrated the increased electrical conductivity of the Fe3O4-Fe nanohybrids using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			2045-2322			WOS:000408448600032	28842692

Herein, we investigate counter-intuitive roles that water electrolysis plays in regulating intercalation chemistry. Using the NaxFe[Fe-(CN)(6)]parallel to NaTi2(PO4)(3) (x < 1) aqueous battery as a platform, we report that high-voltage overcharging can serve as an electrochemical activation approach to achieving concurrent Na-ion intercalation and an electrolytic oxygen evolution reaction. When the cell capacity is intrinsically limited by deficient cyclable Na ions, the electrolytic water oxidation on the cathode allows for extra Na-ion intercalation from the electrolyte to the NaTi2(PO4)(3) anode, leading to a major increase in cyclable Na ions and specific capacity. The parasitic oxygen generation and potential transition-metal dissolution, as proved by our synchrotron and imaging tools, can be significantly mitigated with a simple reassembling approach, which enables stable electrochemical performance and sheds light on manipulating ion intercalation and water electrolysis for battery fast charging and recycling.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000787549000010	35230797

Lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTF2N) in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) was used as the electrolyte during testing. The effect of manganese/manganese oxide addition on the performance of the carbons was compared to that of the bare carbons in a cycling study. From CV results, it was found that single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) had the highest peak current density per gram for ORR and OER than the other types of carbon studied. The SWCNT ORR peak decreased 49% after 100 cycles and only 36% when manganese/manganese oxide was added. The high activity of SWCNT with manganese/manganese oxide spheres make it a desirable material to use as the cathode for Li-air batteries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a new sulfur oxidation strategy is developed to prepare planar BiVO4 photoanodes with in situ formed oxygen vacancies, which increases the majority charge carrier density and photovoltage, leading to a record charge separation efficiency of 98.2% among the reported BiVO4 photoanodes. Upon loading NiFeOx as an oxygen evolution cocatalyst, a stable photocurrent density of 5.54 mA cm(-2) is achieved at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5 G illumination. Remarkably, a dual-photoanode configuration further enhances the photocurrent density up to 6.24 mA cm(-2), achieving an excellent applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of 2.76%. This work demonstrates a simple thermal treatment approach to generate oxygen vacancies for the design of efficient planar photoanodes for solar hydrogen production.									134	10	0	0	13	0	134			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000532552000001	32406092

While physical and spectral characterizations fail to obtain most of these details because of interference from the electrolyte and dynamic surface structures under reaction conditions, electrochemical measurements instead are able to provide the most direct information. A thermodynamic-kinetic model was developed in our previous work, which showed great capability to extract the adsorption energies of reactive intermediates through the Tafel plot without considering the exact structures of catalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, a more adaptive model in combination with probing the methanol oxidation reaction was developed. This approach offers the following advantages: From the aspect of thermodynamics, an experimentally rationalized adsorption profile could be obtained without the requirement to know the scaling factors of reactive intermediates. From the aspect of surface structure, the potential induced change of intermediates' coverage in the reaction could be described with high sensitivity. From the aspect of kinetics, multiple Tafel slopes in a single Tafel plot could be explained by potential induced variation in intermediates' coverage and activation energy in the ratedetermining step (RDS). A volcano relation between the symmetry factor and adsorption energy was also discerned and discussed, showing the strong correlation between thermodynamics and kinetics. Our model offers a promising analyzing tool by providing essential information on the electrochemical interface and both thermodynamic and kinetic properties of catalysts, which are important for the design of next-generation high-performance catalysts for multistep electrochemical reactions.									39	2	0	0	3	0	39			2155-5435			WOS:000562075000054

Our results show that on the silver electrode, for both oxalic acid and glyoxylic acid, the reduction reaction is more favorable toward the dimerization step, leading to tartaric acid, due to the increase in the local pH, while on the lead electrode, the step involving the protonation of the intermediate is more favorable, leading to the formation of glycolate. Techno-economic analysis shows that tartaric acid production from glyoxylic acid and from oxalic acid via electrochemical synthesis can be a potential process at the industrial scale. In the present case, the oxygen evolution reaction was chosen as the reaction at the other electrode for practical reasons, but oxygen is a low-value product. Another anodic reaction with a more valuable oxidation product can be selected to increase the profitability of the overall electrochemical process and thereby decrease the total production costs of tartaric acid.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2168-0485			WOS:000553241400015

Herein, in situ growth of ultrasmall and robust Co@beta-Co(OH)(2) NCs (approximate to 2 nm) hosted in a honeycomb-like 3D N-enriched carbon network was developed for water-oxidation catalysis with extremely small onset potential (1.44 V). Overpotentials of 220 and 270 mV were required to achieve a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) and 100 mAcm(-2), respectively, in alkaline medium (1m KOH). More promisingly, at eta(10)= 240 mV, the prolonged oxygen evolution process (> 130 h) with faradaic efficiency > 95% at a reaction rate of 22 s(-1) at 1.46 V further substantiated the key role of the ultrasmall supported NCs, which outperformed the benchmark electrocatalysts (RuO2/IrO2) and NCs reported so far. It is anticipated that the high redox potential of NCs with regeneratable active sites and their concerted synergistic effects with the Nenriched porous/flexible carbon network are inherently worth considering to enhance the mass/charge transport owing to the nanoscale interfacial collaboration across the electrode/ electrolyte boundary, thereby efficiently energizing the sluggish/challenging oxygen evolution process.									14	0	0	0	3	0	14			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000540482000009	31647181

Furthermore, fossil fuel combustion releases a large quantity of CO2 every day. In the quest for an alternative, although hydrogen is found to be a potent fuel with zero carbon waste, bulk-scale hydrogen production via steam reforming or partial oxidation of hydrocarbons produces tons of CO and CO2 as waste. Perhaps, hydrogen production by means of electrocatalytic water splitting remains a viable and less energy-intensive approach. However, the potential bottlenecks of the water splitting are the large thermodynamic barrier and sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) associated with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a comparatively straight-forward reaction. Efforts over the last few decades have made it possible to design very reactive noble-metal-based catalysts, using Pt, IrO2, and RuO2, which dramatically diminish the working potential and enhance the rate of water oxidation. Nonetheless, the scarcity of these rare-earth metals precludes their physical implication and leads to the design of active transition-metal catalysts like CoOx and FeNi(O)OH as key alternatives. However, copper, a highly conductive and one of the earth's most abundant metals, has not much been explored for electrode materials. Lately, copper-based materials have been employed as successful catalysts for not only the OER and HER (individual half-cell reactions), but also for overall water splitting (OWS) through the design of bifunctional copper catalysts. This review summarizes the recent developments of copper-based electrode materials for electrocatalytic water splitting, with emphasis on OER, HER, and OWS studies. Moreover, Cu materials are categorized by means of counter anions present and based on their catalytic activity (mono- and/or bi-functional behavior). Future scope and challenges to develop active Cu-based materials, as non-noble and earth abundant catalysts for sustainable energy studies, are highlighted.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			2196-0216			WOS:000634878900001

Herein, a versatile strategy was demonstrated to controllably synthesize a family of metal ion-chelated tannic acid coatings on diverse metal hydroxide nanoarchitecturesviathe interfacial coordination assembly process. Typically, the interfacial coordination of tannic acid with a range of metal ions (e.g., Fe3+, Co2+, and Ni2+) enables thein situformation of metal-ligand networks on nickel hydroxide nanowalls and other hierarchical substrates. Importantly, the obtained hierarchical coordination complex showed that its bifunctional electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction is highly dependent on the chelated metal ions. The coordination coating of tannic acid with iron ions on nickel hydroxide nanowalls significantly enhanced the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity and achieved maximal activity toward overall water splitting with good long-term durability. This interfacial coordination assembly coating strategy is facile yet efficient, opening a new avenue for rational modulation of the surface properties of metal (hydro)oxides for promising applications.									58	2	0	0	4	0	59			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000560225400041

The oxidation of water to dioxygen is a 4H+/4e- process, while oxygen can be fully reduced to water by a 4e-/4H+ process or partially reduced by fewer electrons to reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 and O2-. We demonstrate that a novel manganese corrole complex behaves as a bifunctional catalyst for both the electrocatalytic generation of dioxygen as well as the reduction of dioxygen in aqueous media. Furthermore, our combined kinetic, spectroscopic, and electrochemical study of manganese corroles adsorbed on different electrode materials (down to a submolecular level) reveals mechanistic details of the oxygen evolution and reduction processes.Doppelleben: Ein Mangan‐Corrol‐Komplex vermittelt als difunktioneller Katalysator in wassriger Losung die elektrokatalytische Erzeugung von Disauerstoff ebenso wie seine Reduktion.

Impressively, due to the synergistic interplay between FeCo alloys and NG/NCNTs, the resultant hybrid as a bi-functional electrocatalyst demonstrates an outstanding electrocatalytic performance for both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in alkaline electrolytes.

The initial content of oxygen in the molten copper was about 0.5 wt% and the final content was about 30 ppm. As expected, the rate of reduction of liquid copper containing such oxygen contents follows a first order kinetic law, but depending on the oxygen content, there are two controlling stages with different kinetic constants. Over the range of 500 ppm of oxygen dissolved, the first order kinetic constant k was found to be 3.32 x 10(-4) m/s, but below 500 ppm of oxygen, the constant decreased to 0.31 x 10(-4) m/s at 1473 K. A series of experiments was carried out at different temperatures (1423 K, 1473 K, 1523 K and 1573 K) in order to determine the activation energy, which was found to be 54 kJ/mol. At the same temperature (1473 K), graphite disks floating on the liquid surface were used to compare with graphite rods. It was found that the rate of reduction per unit area was 1.6 times higher with rods than with floating disks, due to the stirring of liquid copper produced by gas evolution which in the case of graphite disks was much lower than in the case of rods.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0008-4433			WOS:000251124500004

This inspires the development of simpler strategies for scale-up production since the existing ones rely on precursors whose commercial viability is not yet ascertained. Herein, we demonstrate the insertion prospects of M-Nx (M = Fe, Co, Ni) moieties, the electrocatalytic centers in the M-N-Cs, into commercial carbon to establish that a single-step heating of the inexpensive precursors is sufficient to generate bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with efficiencies that bypass the majority of the known catalysts. Further importantly, we quantify both the ORR and OER trends and the metal insertion limits for each metal while maintaining an atomic dispersion, without the formation of surface migration-induced clustering, because such clustering is inevitable in the existing processes to necessitate an extra acid-leaching step to remove them. We further quantify and explain for each metal a negative mass balance originating from anomalous mass loss of both metal and carbon content, and a massive reconstruction of the carbon backbone catalyzed by the very metal, an event documented for the first time though it ought to be associated with other M-N-C syntheses too. The study establishes an incredibly simple and inexpensive strategy for the realization of M-N-Cs and outlines the parameters to be considered during mass-production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0008-6223	1873-3891		WOS:000816149500005

These 3-DOM IrO₂ honeycomb arrays showed a large surface area and ordered macropores (155 nm in diameter) cross-linked by secondary mesopores. Internal structures of 3-DOM IrO₂ material were observed microscopically through these secondary pores. According to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra, 3-DOM IrO₂ has a rutile crystal structure and is mainly composed of iridium dioxide. In acidic electrolytes, the overpotential of 3-DOM IrO₂ material at 0.5 mV cm-2 was only 0.22 V. Accelerated durability tests demonstrated excellent durability of 3-DOM IrO₂ as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4360		MEDLINE:30960613	30960613

Products were identified using Mass Spectrometry and H-1-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. O-2 and CO2 were also observed as products resulting from carbonate electrolysis and/or the oxygen evolution reaction.. Methane was adsorbed and activated by NiO while CO32- was adsorbed onto non-conducting ZrO2. Oxygen was then abstracted and donated from CO32- to electrocatalytically active sites to form new C-O or O-H bonds. This proposed low temperature electrochemical partial oxidation of methane may provide a new pathway for the synthesis of complex oxygenates and long chain hydrocarbons.

The local solvation structures, the evolution of atomic charges, atomic separations, spin densities, electron localization functions, and frontier molecular orbitals, as well as free energy profiles, evidence that the reaction proceeds through a hybrid (hydrogen atom transfer and electron proton transfer) and hemibond-assisted reaction mechanism. A benchmarking study utilizing high-level ab initio calculations to examine the interactions of a hydroxyl radical pair in the gas phase and the influence of a hemibonded water is also provided.

Herein, a strategy by modulating surface electron densities is adopted to design new catalyst: the Ru-NiFe-P nanosheets on 3D self-supported nickel foam was developed by doping a small quantity of Ru into transition metals phosphates. The designed catalyst displays excellent electrocatalytic performance in 1.0 M KOH, with low overpotentials of 44 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and 242 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) for OER. Particularly, it only needs 1.47 V to yield 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Ru-incorporated NiFe-P can generate new active sites on Ru atoms and increase the catalytic activity of original P sites leading to an optimal Gibbs free-energy on catalysts surface. This work offers a new perspective for designing admirable electrocatalysts.									106	7	0	0	7	0	108			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000510526000045

In this study we investigate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER, from species formed during ORR) in Na+ containing dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on poly and single crystalline Pt and Au electrodes. Using a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) generator collector setup and additional differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), we investigate the ORR mechanism and product distribution. We found that the formation of adsorbed Na2O2, which inhibits further oxygen reduction, is kinetically favored on Pt overadsorption on Au. Peroxide formation occurs to a smaller extent on the single crystal electrodes of Pt than on the polycrystalline surface. Utilizing two different approaches, we were able to calculate the heterogeneous rate constants of the O-2/O-2(-) redox couple on Pt and Au and found a higher rate for Pt electrodes compared to Au. We will show that on both electrodes the first electron transfer (formation of superoxide) is the rate-determining step in the reaction mechanism. Small amounts of added Li+ in the electrolyte reduce the reversibility of the O-2/O-2(-) redox couples due to faster and more efficient blocking of the electrode by peroxide. Another effect is the positive potential shift of the peroxide formation on both electrodes. The reaction rate of the peroxide formation on the Au electrode increases when increasing the Li+ content in the electrolyte, whereas it remains unaffected on the Pt electrode. However, we can show that the mixed electrolytes promote the activity of peroxide oxidation on the Pt electrode compared to a pure Li+ electrolyte. Overall, we found that the addition of Li+ leads to a Li+-dominated mechanism (ORR onset and product distribution) as soon as the Li+ concentration exceeds the oxygen concentration.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000650827100001

However, the stabilizing or catalytic effect of these materials can become complicated due to the presence of major side-reactions observed during dis(charge). Here, we isolate the charge reaction from the discharge by utilizing electrodes prefilled with commercial lithium peroxide with a crystallite size of about 200-800 nm. Using a combination of S/TEM, online mass spectrometry, XPS, and electrochemical methods to probe the nature of surface films on carbon and conductive Ti-based nanoparticles, we show that oxygen evolution from lithium peroxide is strongly dependent on their surface properties. Insulating TiO2 surface layers on TiC and TiN - even as thin as 3 nmcan completely inhibit the charge reaction under these conditions. On the other hand, TiC, which lacks this oxide film, readily facilitates oxidation of the bulk Li2O2 crystallites, at a much lower overpotential relative to carbon. Since oxidation of lithium oxygen battery cathodes is inevitable in these systems, precise control of the surface chemistry at the nanoscale becomes of upmost importance.									109	1	0	0	4	0	110			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000347138000061	25364863

Their design requires structural knowledge of their catalytically active sites and state. Here, we track the atomic-scale structural evolution of well-defined CoOx(OH)(y) compounds into their catalytically active state during electrocatalytic operation through operando and surface-sensitive X-ray spectroscopy and surface voltammetry, supported by theoretical calculations. We find clear voltammetric evidence that electrochemically reducible near-surface Co3+-O sites play an organizing role for high OER activity. These sites invariably emerge independent of initial metal valency and coordination under catalytic OER conditions. Combining experiments and theory reveals the unified chemical structure motif as mu(2)-OH-bridged Co2+/3+ ion clusters formed on all three-dimensional cross-linked and layered CoOx(OH)(y) precursors and present in an oxidized form during the OER, as shown by operando X-ray spectroscopy. Together, the spectroscopic and electrochemical fingerprints offer a unified picture of our molecular understanding of the structure of catalytically active metal oxide OER sites.									245	6	0	0	14	0	246			2520-1158			WOS:000446623000017

Designing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is in desperate need for the development of overall water-splitting devices. Herein, dense CuxO nanowires were fabricated on three dimensional Cu foam (CF), which were consisted of mixed Cu2O phase and CuO phase as electrochemical active sites. Importantly, through characterization of morphology and chemical composition, we found that Cu2O and CuO could transform to each other during electrochemical reduction or oxidation process. Cu2O and CuO served as active center for HER and OER respectively, and the transformation was beneficial to the catalytic performance. In alkaline solution, overpotentials as small as 135 mV and 315 mV to achieve 10 mA/cm(2) current density and small Tafel slope of 135 dec(-1) and 63 mV/dec were obtained on the CuxO NWs/CF catalyst for HER and OER, respectively. And it also showed long-term stability for both HER and OER.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			0253-3820	1872-2040		WOS:000512954800001

Herein, a facile carbonization-oxidation-phosphidation strategy is proposed to construct a novel nanocomposite consisting of CoxP (a mixture of Co2P and CoP) nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped carbon porous polyhedrons based on surface functionalized ZIF-67, which serves as a high-performance electrode material for overall water splitting. With the merits of highly active CoxP nanoparticles and distinct structure characteristics, the resultant composite exhibits superior catalytic behaviors toward both the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolytes. When the as-prepared hybrid is adopted as both the cathodic and anodic catalysts in an alkaline medium, the electrolyzer can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of similar to 1.71 V. More importantly, this work sufficiently proves that surface engineering route is feasible to develop high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts toward overall water splitting application.

Herein, we demonstrate a facile strategy for the preparation of CoP quantum dots (QDs) embedded in S,N-codoped graphite carbon (CoP@SNC) by using organophosphoric acid as both phosphorus and carbon sources. Benefiting from the strong coupling and synergistic effect between CoP QDs and highly conductive S,N-codoped carbon, well-structured porosity and high specific surface area, the resulting CoP@SNC exhibits excellent activities for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), making it a trifunctional electro-catalyst for overall water splitting and rechargeable Zn-air batteries. When CoP@SNC is used for overall water splitting, a cell voltage as low as 1.64 V is required to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2); the obtained rechargeable Zn-air battery with CoP@SNC as the air cathode exhibits a high open-circuit voltage of 1.45 V, a very low discharge-charge voltage gap (0.83 V at 10 mA cm(-2)), and a long cycle life (up to 180 cycles).

Although numerous comprehensions about 2D semiconductor photocatalysts have been amassed up to now, low cost efficiency, degradation, kinetics of charge transfer along with recycling are still the big challenges to realize a wide application of 2D semiconductor-based photocatalysis. At present, most photocatalysts still need rare or expensive noble metals to improve the photocatalytic activity, which inhibits their commercial-scale application extremely. Thus, developing less costly, earth-abundant semiconductor-based photocatalysts with efficient conversion of sunlight energy remains the primary challenge. In this review, it begins with a brief description of the general mechanism of overall photocatalytic water splitting. Then a concise overview of different types of 2D semiconductor-mediated photocatalysts is given to figure out the advantages and disadvantages for mentioned semiconductor-based photocatalysis, including the structural property and stability, synthesize method, electrochemical property and optical properties for H2/O2 production half reaction along with overall water splitting.

In particular, experimental Rh doping of lepidocrocite TiO2 nanosheets has significantly increased catalytic activity. We use first-principles density functional theory to consider the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on both pristine and transition metal doped systems. While the undoped TiO2 nanosheets exhibit several limitations and require high overpotentials during the water splitting reaction, selected dopants modify the binding strength of reaction intermediates and can reduce rate limiting thermodynamic barriers and theoretical required overpotentials. We present an activity volcano for these nanosheets, with the full spectrum of 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals as candidate dopants. Subsequent photocatalytic measurements of OER activity with selected dopants are carried out to validate the predictions, and the trends are found to be consistent. These results help describe how surface dopants affect reaction mechanisms and provide general design principles for high performance catalysts during the water splitting reaction.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000410597600027

This work presents a pair of MOF - derived oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for the advancement of zinc-air batteries. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) are known as ideal materials to create doped carbons. Combining with a sacrificial tellurium template, we have developed a "pseudocarbon nanotube" with a ZIF-8 that is doped with a mixture of zinc, cobalt, and iron. The resulting mixed-metal doped porous carbon nanotubes (CoFeZn@pCNT) show excellent catalytic activity for ORR with a half-way ORR potential (E-1/2) of 0.87 V vs. RHE (reverse hydrogen electrode). Iridium-based catalysts are known as the best option for OER so far, but it is not viable for practical applications due to cost restrictions. Previous research into alternative catalysts has focused on metal oxides with first-row transition metals. Metal sulfides provide superior conductivity compared to metal oxides and are a new frontier in the search for affordable, active, and stable OER catalysts. By combining cobalt, iron, and nickel into a MOF structure (ZIF-67), followed by a sulfurization process, a MOF-derived mixed-metal sulfide catalyst (FeCoNieS@ZIF) has been developed in this study. The resulting catalysts show an onset OER potential of 1.65 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibit remarkable stability for the operation of zinc-air batteries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This can be used as a high temperature reactor for ultrafast and in situ synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) based hybrids within 60 s in an open atmosphere. rGO based hybrids such as Fe3C-G@rGO, Co-Fe3C-G@ rGO, Fe-Fe3C-NG@rGO, CoO@rGO, and Pt@rGO (G represents graphene, and NG represents N-doped graphene) have been synthesized by simply mixing appropriate precursors with GO and treating with microwave. The experiments require neither any external high temperature reactors/furnaces nor any chemical reagents or solvents. Then, rGO based hybrids have been exploited for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and methanol oxidation activity. Co0@rGO and Co-Fe3C-G@rGO show outstanding OER performances with very low overpotential (ti) and a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at 1.52 and 1.56 V with long-term stability. Fe-Fe3C-NG@rGO hybrid shows better oxygen reduction performances, and the onset potential is comparable with precious Pt/C catalyst. The Pt@rGO is highly stable toward methanol oxidation as compared to the Pt/C catalyst. The high catalytic activity and stability are believed to be due to the better adherence of different inorganic nanostructures onto rGO. We strongly believe that this methodology would pave the way for a new era of synthesis of rGO based various hybrids for various applications.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2168-0485			WOS:000427092900133

Herein, Ni and WC (Tungsten Carbide) nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanofibers (Ni-WC/CNFs) electrocatalysts w ere successfully synthesized by electrospinning followed by subsequent carbonization process. The morphology and composition of the Ni-WC/CNFs composite were characterized by using SEM and XRD analysis. Ni and WC nanoparticles were successfully uniformly dispersed on carbon nanofibers (CNFs). The Ni-WC/CNFs electrocatalysts exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity towards OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH solutions. The experimental results show that the OER and HER overpotentials of Ni-WC/CNFs are 350 mV and 190 mV respectively when the current density is 10 mA cm(-2). The excellent electrocatalytic properties of OER and HER are attributed to the synergistic effect between Ni and WC nanoparticles and the large electrochemically active surface area. This study provides a simple and feasible strategy for the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts with low cost and high activity.

In this study, a catalyst-integrated electrode with a tunable composition (borate/Fe dual-doped Ni3S2 hollow microspheres on nickel foam) was fabricated by a self-templating method where the dopant contents can be easily varied by the precursor compounds. The catalyst-integrated electrode showed impressive OER and HER activities and good catalyst stability in an alkaline electrolyte. The performance of this electrode for total electrochemical water splitting was quite exceptional, requiring only a small overpotential of 364 mV to yield 50 mA cm(-2) of current density. The strong total water splitting performance can be attributed to the use of complementary anionic (borate) and cationic (Fe) doping of the nickel sulfide structure to improve various elementary processes in the OER and HER mechanisms.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			0888-5885			WOS:000477787000014

The N-2 evolution rate was observed to decrease with increasing reaction time and was found to be correlated with a decrease in O-2 evolution (OER) activity, the origin of this latter effect however being unknown. Here, we investigate, by means of density functional theory calculation, anion vacancies at the TaON-terminated (001) surface of the perovskite oxynitride SrTaO2N. We find an energetic preference for oxygen and nitrogen vacancies to reside at the surface, where they are spontaneously healed by *O and *OH adsorbates under OER conditions. For nitrogen vacancies, this self-healing leads to an altered stoichiometry Ta4O8+xN4-x that is accompanied by electron doping. Substitution of N by O at the surface also leads to tensile strain, which confines the excess charge to the very surface layer, affecting the binding energy of reaction intermediates and significantly increasing the OER overpotential. This peculiar change in electronic structure thus provides an atomic-scale explanation for the experimentally observed drop in OER activity of perovskite oxynitrides.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17				2639-4979		WOS:000519669700010

The improved CoP2@3D-NPC hybrid materials show excellent electrocatalytic activity toward HER and OER. This material provides a low overpotential of 126 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 167 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH for HER with a small Tafel slope value of 59 mV dec(-1), respectively. Besides, it is also active for the OER under alkaline conditions. Such a prominent property of the CoP2@3D-NPC electrocatalyst could be attributed to its excellent electrical conductivity of 3D carbon substrate, strong synergistic effect between CoP2 nanoparticles and carbon nanosheet as well as extra active sites created by the N-doped structure.

Here we present a nickel phosphite, Ni-11(HPO3)(8)(OH)(6), belonging to the unique class of phosphorus-based inorganic materials with striking structural features that have been explored for the first time in the reaction of electrocatalytic overall water splitting with a profound understanding of the system using in situ and ex situ techniques. When electrophoretically deposited, the nickel phosphite exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic activity, yielding considerably low overpotentials for both the OER and HER with extreme structural stability and enhanced durability in alkaline media. Apart from the attractive structural merits, the higher activity of nickel phosphite is mainly attributed to the formation of oxidized nickel species in the catalytic OER process, while subtle experimental evidence of the participation of phosphite anions for the acceleration of the HER with the support of Ni2+ cations as catalytically active sites is identified, which is highly compelling and has never been previously discovered. Finally, the bifunctionality of nickel phosphite was demonstrated by constructing an alkaline water electrolyzer with a low cell voltage and over 4 days of undiminishing stability. This work offers an appealing cost-effective system based on earth-abundant metals for water electrolysis and can be extended to other transition metal based homo- or hetero-bimetallic phosphites.									155	7	0	0	4	0	155			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000432599100016

Neutron-emission spectra from exotic oxygen isotopes are calculated by the doorway-state approach in heavy-ion multi-nucleon transfer reactions. The results agree with experiment remarkably well, providing evidence that the continuum effects are stronger than similar to 1 MeV, consistent with the shell evolution in exotic nuclei. The peaks in the neutron spectra are understood as doorway-state resonances. The results by this CCSM doorway-state approach are compared with calculations on neutron-scattering resonance peaks made within the CCSM phase-shift approach and also with those obtained in the Gamow shell model, by taking the same Hamiltonian..									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2050-3911			WOS:000370522200012

Moreover, a detailed analysis of its optical and redox properties was carried out by comparing the results obtained via optical spectroscopy and electrochemistry with the trends predicted via a series of DFT and TD-DFT calculations. The electrochemistry results demonstrated that the pi-expanded Co(ii)TPTPP interacted strongly with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), which were finally immobilized on carbon nanotubes via noncovalent interactions and further deposited on glassy carbon. This strong immobilization via pi-pi stacking between Co(ii)TPTPP and MWCNTs leads to significantly stable electrochemically catalyzed hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which provides a new insight into the understanding electron transfer channels.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000474625700046		
J	Li, Huihui; Gao, Yujun; Gao, Daqiang; Wang, Yuhua								Effect of oxide defect on photocatalytic properties of MSnO3 (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba) photocatalysts								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				243				428	437		10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.10.076				APR 2019	2019	Since energy transfer to oxygen species is generally considered to be the critical step during the O-2(center dot-)-driven photocatalytic reaction, it is important to develop approaches to design the oxygen defects induced photo catalysts to improve the performance of oxygen chemisorption. Here we report that a new strategy of oxide defect controlled MSnO3 catalyst is served to turn light into chemical energy by improving species chemisorption on the surface. CaSnO3 with the Ca/Sn ratio of 2.7 (2.7-CaSnO3) rich in oxygen vacancies exhibited a high photocurrent performance and an efficient photocatalytic activity. A superior photo efficiency is achieved for 2.7-CaSnO3, which reduces 93.9% MB dyes within 30 min under 100 mW/cm(2) white LED light irradiation, approximately 3.2 times larger than its stoichiometric one. Under the same LED light irradiation, 577.4 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) of H-2 and 62.0 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) of O-2 are realized over 2.7-CaSnO3. The chemisorption improved by oxygen defects in 2.7-CaSnO3 enables the transfer of photogenerated electrons to oxygen species in space. Therefore, oxygen molecules are activated into superoxide radicals on the oxygen defect-rich MSnO3 successfully. After more oxygen defects doping, the hydrogen evolution rate increases from 553.3 to 1152.7 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), while O-2 production rates increases from 62.0 to 129.1 mu mol h(-1) g(-1). The hydrogen reduction treatment further revealed that the enhancement of both hydrogen and oxygen evolution was realized by introducing more oxygen vacancies into 2.7-CaSnO3.									23	2	0	0	3	0	23			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000453616800044

However, it remains great challenge for CP-based catalysts to be utilized for electrocatalytic oxidation reactions due to their inefficient activities and low catalytic stabilities. Herein, we applied a mixed-metal strategy to fabricate two-dimensional CoxNi1-x-CPs with dual active sites for electrocatalytic water and urea oxidation. By metal ratio regulation in the twodimensional layer, an optimized Co2/3Ni1/3-CP exhibits a water oxidation performance with an overpotential of 325 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 86 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solution for oxygen evolution reaction. Importantly, a lower potential than that of commercial RuO2 is observed over 20 mA cm(-2). Co2/3Ni1/3-CP also displays a potential of 1.381 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for urea oxidation reaction and a Tafel slope of 124 mV dec(-1). This mixed-metal strategy to maximize synergistic effect of different metal centers may ultimately lead to promising electrocatalysts for small molecule oxidation reaction.

Among the prominent candidates, nickel-iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) have been found excellent catalytic activity, but their poor conductivity and stability seriously impede their performance. Herein, we report hierarchical NiFe-LDH nanosheets prepared from NiFe-Alloy on nickel mesh (NM) by high voltage cathodic polarization. The resultant NiFe-LDH/NM exhibits a remarkable OER activity and stability, which has a low over -potential of 340 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, and maintains a current density of 15 mA cm-2 at a constant voltage of 1.56 V for 50 h if the NiFe-Alloy/NM is used as the cathode. The successful conversion of NiFe-LDH nanosheets originating from NiFe-Alloy nanoparticles would open a new avenue for synthesizing transition metal-based LDH compounds.

Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors Impacting Surface Redox Reactions								ACS ENERGY LETTERS				1	5			931	948		10.1021/acsenergylett.6b00391				NOV 2016	2016	Water splitting occurring on a semiconductor photocatalyst has become the Holy Grail process to produce a solar fuel, hydrogen, on irradiation with sunlight (or simulated sunlight) in heterogeneous media. Authors often claim highly efficient evolution of hydrogen and oxygen from water through water splitting or efficient hydrogen evolution in the presence of some sacrificial electron donor, whether photocatalytically or photo electrochemically. Perusal of the scientific and patent literature reveals that yields of hydrogen are disappointingly low even after decades of remarkable advances in materials science and in strategies to achieve significant progress in water splitting. This Review identifies and discusses intrinsic and extrinsic factors (e.g., Phi(h nu) = fn{beta, k(r), S, D, d, s, tau, alpha(h nu)}; photostability; back reactions) that impact redox reactions in general and water splitting in particular. The lack of control and handling of these various factors present a challenging, if not an impossible task in improving process efficiencies to achieve significant practical evolution of hydrogen from water splitting.									97	4	0	0	1	0	97			2380-8195			WOS:000390085700008

More specifically, carbon-supported IrCoOx core-shell nanoparticles exhibited a highly efficient OER catalytic activity and stability compared to state-of-art reference IrOx catalysts in CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 tap-water. IrCoOx/C also exhibited a significantly improved electrochemical oxidation and corrosion resistance than IrOx, resulting in a beneficial suppression of Ir dissolution. The application of IrCoOx/C in the CO2 electrolyzer displayed superior CO space-time yields over prolonged electrolyzer tests.									30	0	0	0	2	0	30			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000532683200057

Herein, we prepared cobalt hydroxide nanoparticles (CoHP) and cobalt hydroxide nanosheets (CoHS) on nickel foam. In the electrocatalytic OER, CoHS shows an overpotential of 306 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2). This is enhanced as compared with that of CoHP (367 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2)). In addition, CoHS also exhibits an improved performance in the electrocatalytic GOR. The improved electrocatalytic performance of CoHS could be due to the higher ability of the two-dimensional nanosheets on CoHS in electron transfer.

The past decade has witnessed the fast development of electrolytic water splitting for H-2 generation, with most of the studies focusing on the development of superior electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Equally important is the innovation of water splitting system design to tackle the critical issues confronted by conventional water electrolysis. Some interesting developments have recently emerged with additional redox-mediated process to separate the HER and OER in time and space. In this Review, the various strategies for decoupled H-2 production are critically reviewed.

In this work, a double-layer CoP/CeO2-FeOxH mixed catalyst is successfully prepared by a two-step electrodeposition process as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in alkaline and neutral solutions. The CoP/CeO2-FeOxH catalytic electrode in alkaline and neutral solutions exhibits overpotentials of 37 for HER and 248 for OER at 10 mA cm(-2). The cell voltages of the whole electrolyzed water in alkaline and neutral media are 1.53 and 1.82 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, this catalyst also shows a significant balance between catalytic activity and stability. This work not only provides a new strategy for the preparation of double-layer composite materials but also provides an experimental reference for the industrial development of electrolyzed water in alkaline or neutral solutions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2168-0485			WOS:000695384700035

This study introduces a new application area for this waste material by investigating its activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. Ruthner powder with the ot-Fe(2)O(3 )phase structure was deposited on the carbon paper substrates using the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) process to fabricate the electrodes. The effect of the concentration of cetrimonium bromide ([CTAB]) and the Ruthner powder ([RP]) in the EPD cell on the morphology and activity of the electrodes were investigated by SEM, LSV, and EIS techniques. The results revealed the formation of a homogenous layer on the carbon paper when [CTAB] and [RP] were respectively 0.4 g.l(-1) and 0.2 g.l(-1). The obtained electrode showed the best activity among all fabricated electrodes. In particular, its onset overpotential and overpotential at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) were respectively 85% and 25% lower than those of bare carbon electrodes. (C) 2021 SECV.

The synthesized Z-C-TiO2 and Z-R-TiO2-x heterostructures manifest remarkable electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with onset over potential of only 320 mV (Tafel slope = 40 mV dec(-1)) and 325 mV (Tafel slope = 45 mV dec(-1)) respectively, with activity over 6 h of testing time in alkaline medium. This enhancement in the activities of engineered nanoscale materials can be attributed to the better coping of reaction intermediate through synergistic effect of two semiconducting materials. Owning to the reduced electron-hole recombination by versatile cascade band alignment of titania with ZnSe, these heterostructures also show superior photocatalytic activity for degradation of reactive blue-866 dye (RB-866) under visible light irradiation when compared to pure titania.

Herein, we synthesized novel polyethyleneimine (PEI) functionalized Echinops-like Rh porous nanostructures (Echinops-like Rh PNNSs) by a solvothermal method, which originated from the self-assembly of Rh two-dimensional (2D) sub-nanoflakes with 1.2 nm thickness. As a good electron donor, -NH2 on PEI could modulate the electronic structure of Echinops-like Rh PNNSs, reducing the adsorption energy of H2O on the surface of Echinops-like Rh PNNSs. Meanwhile, -NH2 groups could specifically enrich H2O molecules under neutral conditions, which facilitates water splitting. The as-synthesized Echinops-like Rh PNNSs exhibit high HER activity with ultralow overpotential, low Tafel slope, and excellent stability. Moreover, the Echinops-like Rh PNNSs also showed an enhanced OER activity than commercial RuO2 with a small overpotential of 79.5 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in neutral media. When using Echinops-like Rh PNNSs as both anode and cathode catalysts for overall seawater splitting, a cell voltage of only 1.61 V is needed for generating 10 mA cm(-2) current density, greatly boosting the efficiency of seawater splitting.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000662986100001

The partial currents of HER and ORR producing H(2)O(2)( )or H2O are quantified. The results show that (i) ORR occurs preferentially in a diffusion-limited manner (either limited by the mass transfer of O-2 or H+) and only the excess H+ not being consumed by the ORR can be converted to Had and H-2 and (ii) at potentials negative of the onset of Had formation, the H2O2 production rate first increases and then decreases with the increasing overpotential. Possible origins for the H2O2 yield in the HER region are suggested. Present results demonstrate that combining DEMS and RRDE techniques can be powerful for deriving the intrinsic kinetics of individual processes in a complex electrochemical system.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000503114100013

The NiCo2O4 nanosheets and NiCo2O4 nanoflowers are produced on the nickel foam (NF) with a large specific surface area by a one-step hydrothermal method and the NiCo2O4 nanoflowers are uniformly distributed in the NiCo2O4 nano-sheets to form a three-dimensional (3D) electrode. Compared to conventional NiCo2O4, the 3D NiCo2O4 electrode provides more active sites (Ni and Co) for oxygen adsorption thus reducing the energy required to break H-O bonds to promote HER. When NiCo2O4/NF is combined with Pd nanoparticles (Pd/NiCo2O4/NF), the HER performance is improved greatly because of the synergistic effects rendered by the 3D structure of NiCo2O4 and Pd nanoparticles. The overpotential of Pd/NiCo2O4/NF is 69 mV at a current density is 10 mA/cm(2) and it is stable for 10 h in alkaline environments. The materials design and properties provide useful information for future development of commercial hydrogen production.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000685504500002

Surface engineering of the electrocatalysts is one of the most popular strategies to improve their catalytic activity. Herein, we, for the first time, designed an advanced bi-functional electrocatalyst for the ORR and OER by simultaneously etching and doping a cobalt sulfides-graphene hybrid with NH3-plasma. The graphene supported Co9S8 nanoparticles were prepared (denoted as Co9S8/G) first, followed by the NH3-plasma treatment, which could not only lead to nitrogen doping into both Co9S8 and graphene, but also partially etch the surface of both Co9S8 and graphene. The heteroatom doping could efficiently tune the electronic properties of Co9S8 and graphene, and the surface etching could expose more active sites for electrocatalysis, which can contribute significantly to the enhanced electrocatalytic performance for ORR and OER. The electrochemical results revealed that the etched and N-doped Co9S8/G shows excellent ORR activity, which is close to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, and great OER activity. The strategy developed here provides a novel and efficient approach to prepare hybrid bi-functional electrocatalysts for ORR and OER.									668	36	0	0	18	0	672			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000374351200018

An Eulerian framework is used to describe the two-phase flow formed by a coaxial injector fed by liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen. A transport equation for the density of the liquid interface represents the jet break-up, subsequent atomization, and space-time evolution of the liquid surface area which combined with a local description of the vaporization flux provides the volumetric source of gaseous oxygen. Subcritical and transcritical conditions are successively considered. Another transport equation for the flame surface density is then used to evaluate the mean reaction rate per unit volume. This reaction rate depends on an effective strain rate and on operating parameters such as the mean pressure prevailing in the combustion chamber. A simple analysis based on the fast chemistry limit indicates that the local rate of reaction varies like the square root of pressure and strain rate. A computational model combining these various elements is established. Calculated cryogenic flame structures are compared to recent experimental data corresponding to different gas to liquid momentum flux ratios and chamber pressures. The mean reaction rate spatial maps are in agreement with experimental OH light emission images which are used to locate the chemical reaction regions. Parametric studies indicate how the liquid or transcritical phase evolution modifies the flame pattern. (c) 2005 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, its extensive realization critically depends on the progress in cost-effective and high-powered oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. As a member of the big family of two-dimensional (2D) materials, nanostructured layered double hydroxides (nLDHs) have made significant processes and continuous breakthroughs for OER electrocatalysis. In this Review, the advancements in designing nLDHs for OER in recent years were discussed with a unique focus on their electronic modulations and in situ analysis on catalytic processes. After a brief discussion on different synthetic methodologies of nLDHs, including "bottom-up" and "top-down" approaches, the general strategies to enhance the catalytic performances of nLDHs reported so far were summarized, including compositional substitution, heteroatom doping, vacancy engineering, and amorphous/crystalline engineering. Furthermore, the in situ OER processes and mechanism analysis on engineering efficient nLDHs electrocatalysts were discussed. Finally, the research trends, perspectives, and challenges on designing nLDHs were also carefully outlined. This progress Review may offer enlightening experimental/theoretical guidance for designing highly catalytic active nLDHs and provide new directions to promote their future prosperity for practical utilization in water splitting.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000709829800001	34520128

J	[Anonymous]								Self-supported ZIF-coated Co2P/V3P bifunctional electrocatalyst for high-efficiency water splitting								Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry				110				587	597						2022	2022	Exploring high-efficiency dual-functional electrocatalysts to drive electrochemical water splitting is ofgreat importance for advancement of renewable hydrogen energy. Herein, a hierarchical core–shell structureelectrocatalyst ZIF-Co2P/V3P is in situ grown on Ni foam (abbreviated as ZIF-Co2P/V3P@NF) by a stepwisemethod. Firstly, Co, V layered double hydroxides (CoV-LDHs) is grown directly on Ni foam (NF)substrate by solvothermal method. Secondly, CoV-LDHs@NF is transferred into 2-MeIm solution andits surface is coated with a layer of imidazolate zeolite skeleton (ZIF). Finally, ZIF-Co2P/V3P@NF catalystis obtained by low-temperature phosphorization method. The performance of hydrogen evolution reaction(HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be adjusted by tuning molar ratio of Co/V, and theoptimized ZIF-Co2P/V3P@NF-2 manifests superior performance due to its core–shell structure coveredby ZIF skeleton, rich heterogeneous interfaces, as well as the positive synergistic interaction betweenthe Co2P and V3P. The overpotentials are only 57 mV@10 mA cm 2 for HER and 261 mV@10 mA cm 2for OER. Remarkably, the alkaline electrolyzer assembled with ZIF-Co2P/V3P@NF-2 catalyst acquires asmall operating voltage of 1.54 V to drive the current density of 10 mA cm 2 and displays excellentlong-term durability. This work provides a novel opinion for design and preparation of non-noble metalelectrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1226-086X			KJD:ART002855943

Herein, we develop a new strategy to fabricate amorphous nickel-iron phosphides (NiFeP) with controllable morphologies as high-performance catalysts for overall seawater splitting. The ligand effect of P tunes the electronic states of the oxidized NiFe sites, thus breaks the scaling relations for OER and reduce the adsorption energy gap between HO* and HOO* from 3.08 eV to 2.62 eV. The NiFeP nanostructures exhibit extraordinarily low overpotentials of 129 mV for OER and 126 mV for HER at 100 mA cm-2 in simulated alkaline seawater, which outperform the best reported electrocatalysts. They could also be operated at 1.57 V with 100 mA cm-2 in a two-electrode electrolyzer and work for more than 500 h. Our work may provide a universal guidance for the design of highly active seawater splitting electrocatalysts.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000720480100006

When it is used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an aqueous alkaline solution, the B,N:Mo2C/BCN catalyst displays high activity and stability in basic electrolytes, better than those of noble-metal-based Pt/C and IrO2 and previously reported transition metal carbide based electrocatalysts. The mechanistic study reveals that the enhanced performance of the hybrid material is attributable to the improved charge transfer characteristics as well as increased electronic structure by B and N codoping and formation of tiny nanoparticles imbedded in BCN networks. The synthesis approach employed in this study could also be suitable for tuning properties of other transition-metal carbides for use as electrocatalysts.									89	4	0	0	4	0	90			2155-5435			WOS:000444364800058

Depending on the excitability and the gradient, twisted scroll waves and scroll wave attachment to the boundary of the reaction volume are observed by optical tomography, which allows the full three-dimensional reconstruction of the vortex structure in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction as well as estimates on the shape and dynamics of the organizing center of the scroll ( the. lament). This behavior is reproduced in numerical simulations with the generic Barkley model for excitable media supplemented by a gradient along the. lament. In particular, the study deals with scroll waves in a cylindrical reaction system with a free surface open to the air. Oxygen penetrating through the free surface inhibits the evolution of waves and establishes a twist of the. lament. Cooling of the reaction system enhances this twist, eventually leading to a bending of the initially straight. lament. Finally, the bending becomes so pronounced that the. lament to2uches the container boundary and breaks into two pieces, each of which has its distinct rotation frequency.									45	1	0	0	2	0	46			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000182961400032

Herein, carbon-supported Ir-Ru alloys were prepared via a simple wet impregnation method followed by solid-state reduction at temperatures of 200, 250, and 300 degrees C under H-2 gas flow and 300, 600, and 900 degrees C under N-2 gas flow. The size, stoichiometric composition, and structural information of the prepared IrRua/C were investigated using transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption fine structure, the results of which exhibited different electrochemical properties in terms of hydrogen oxidation reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrochemical results showed the enhanced OER activities of IrRua/C formed at 200 degrees C under H-2. Furthermore, IrRua/C can be formed under N-2 with a change in the reduction temperature. This study provides fundamental properties for optimizing synthetic parameters of Ir-Ru-based catalysts to alleviate the degradation of conventional carbon-supported Pt owing to CR issues.

In this work, we demonstrate zinc selenide/nickel selenide heterojunction nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon framework (ZnSe/ NiSe@NC) by a selenization process, which exhibit a remarkably catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution. Compared with pristine ZnSe@NC (with a Tafel slope of 68 mV dec 1 and a.10 of 270 mV), ZnSe/NiSe@NC displayed a much improved HER property with a Tafel slope of 45 mV dec 1 and a.10 of 153 mV. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results indicate that the introduction of NiSe can not only facilitate the water dissociation process, but also enhance charge transfer efficiency in ZnSe/NiSe heterostructure. This work demonstrates considerable potential for transition metal selenide-based catalysts through optimization of their composition and structure.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1387-7003	1879-0259		WOS:000871256400003

In the case of hybrid catalysts, synergistic effect is observed through electronic and structural reconstructions at the interface between dissimilar oxides, which provides the improved catalytic activity for ORR and OER. Herein, the Co3O4 deposited Nd0.5Sr0.5CoO3- (NSC) catalyst is designed to achieve the strain and ligand effect considered as rationale for synergistic effect. A well-designed bifunctional hybrid catalyst (Opt-NSC@Co3O4) is prepared through a useful infiltration technique by tuning the wettability of the precursor solution and the concentration of the Co3O4. Through systematic analysis and re-design, both the onset potential and the limiting current density for ORR and OER are significantly improved with unique microstructure fabricated by the infiltration technique. Opt-NSC@Co3O4 shows outstanding cell performance and excellent stability during 60 h with the discharge-charge voltage gap of 0.5 V for a hybrid Li-air battery. The enhanced electrochemical performance suggests that the derived hybrid catalysts fabricated by the advanced infiltration technique could be promising materials for environmentally benign energy-related applications.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			2196-7350			WOS:000436103900012		
J	Mohanty, P; Seibert, M								Action of K-crown ether on photosystem II electron transport: Characterization of the site of action								INDIAN JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY & BIOPHYSICS				34	3			241	248						JUN 1997	1997	We have investigated the inhibitory effect of K-crown (18-crown-6 potassium picrate) on photosystem II (PSII)-enriched membrane fragments and O-2-evolving core complexes. K-crown at 2-4 mu M inhibits about half the control level of O-2-evolution activity in both types of PSII samples. Oxygen evolution studies demonstrated that the ether works by inactivating the centres and not by interfering with antenna function or energy transfer to the reaction centre. K-crown does not disrupt binding of the extrinsic proteins associated with O, evolution nor complex with bound Ca2+ or Cl- cofactors, but rather it directly inhibits electron transfer after the tetrameric Mn cluster. Fluorescence studies on active and Tris-treated samples showed that K-crown does not prevent artificial donors from transferring electrons to PSII but like DCMU inhibits on the acceptor side after Q(A), the primary quinone acceptor. However, the ether is a leaky inhibitor and may also act as a weak donor when the Mn cluster is not present. Oxygen-production experiments using silicomolybdate as an artificial acceptor (which accepts from both pheophytin and Q(B) in PSII membranes) demonstrated that the inhibition is at or near the DCMU site.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0301-1208	0975-0959		WOS:A1997XW56000002	9425742

The design of electrocatalysts has been improved due to better understanding of surface structures of electrocatalysts and their active sites. This review provides insights into both theoretical and experimental electrochemistry that are directed towards a better understanding of the rate-determining step of water splitting, i.e., oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The emphasis of this review is on the origin of the electrocatalytic activity of nanostructured catalysts toward the aforementioned reaction by correlating the electrode performance with their intrinsic electrochemical properties. Also, the design aspects of acidic- and alkaline-medium electrocatalysts is discussed from preliminary discussion on active site engineering to a more applied concern of achieving highly stable and active electrode fabrication. The design concerns while choosing a support for OER electrocatalyst has also been discussed. At the end, challenges in electrolyser designs and problems faced by the industry to commercialize the electrolyser in a cost-effective manner have been discussed.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			0970-4140	0019-4964		WOS:000390633200007

In this work, a Mo doping approach is adopted to enhance the HER and OER bifunctionality of NiFe-LDH. The catalyst MoNiFeSx@FeNi3 obtained after sulfidation exhibits further improved catalytic performance and good stability. In KOH solution (1.0 M), ultralow overpotentials of 67 mV and 142 mV work well to reach current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, separately. In urea (0.33 M) and KOH (1.0 M) solutions, catalyst urea oxidation reaction can be significantly promoted by MoNiFeSx@FeNi3, and can reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under the condition of 1.31 V. Most importantly, our work elaborates a facile strategy to synthesize novel trimetallic transition metal catalyst as a cut-price substitute for precious metals for highly effective overall water splitting.

Here, a low-cost material system is demonstrated, consisting of perovskite/Si tandem semiconductors and Ni-based earth-abundant catalysts for direct solar hydrogen generation. NiMo-based hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst is reported, which has innovative "flower-stem" morphology with enhanced reaction sites and presents very low reaction overpotential of 6 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). A perovskite solar cell with an unprecedented high open circuit voltage (V-oc) of 1.271 V is developed, which is enabled by an optimized perovskite composition and an improved surface passivation. When the NiMo hydrogen evolution catalyst is wire-connected with an optimally designed NiFe-based oxygen evolution catalyst and a high-performance perovskite-Si tandem cell, the resulting integrated water splitting cell achieves a record 20% STH efficiency. Detailed analysis of the integrated system reveals that STH efficiencies of 25% can be achieved with realistic improvements in the perovskite cell and an LCOH below approximate to$3 kg(-1) is feasible.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000677217100001

Nevertheless, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) involved in the Zn-air batteries seriously hinders their practical application. Hence, in this work, a novel and effective method is developed to synthesize ultrafine cobalt nanoparticles (about 35 nm in diameter) embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon spheres (labeled as Co/NDC). Benefiting from the uniform distribution of the ultrafine cobalt nanoparticles, the prepared Co/NDC catalyst owns a large specific surface area and abundant active sites. As shown in the electrochemical test, the Co/NDC bifunctional electrocatalyst prepared in this article exhibits advanced electrochemical performance. The Co/NDC electrocatalyst displays superior electrochemical activities with a half-wave potential of 0.76 V (vs. RHE) for ORR and a low overpotential of 460 mV at the current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) for OER. More significantly, the integrated rechargeable liquid-state Zn-air battery (ZAB) using Co/NDC electrocatalyst as air cathode shows a peak power density up to 149 mA center dot cm(-2), an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.428 V and a long-term cycle stability for more than 50 h. In addition, the self-made flexible rechargeable ZABs also display excellent performance even under different bending and twisting conditions. Therefore, Co/NDC catalyst can effectively serve as a promising candidate for bifunctional electrocatalyst.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000663324500001

Herein, metal phosphonate precursors with controllable morphologies were synthesized in situ on the surface of nickel foam with different solvents, and could be easily converted into carbon- and nitrogen-doped cobalt phosphate through a calcination method. The OER catalytic performance of the final products was studied in detail. The results showed that the nanowire shaped samples of CoPiNF-800 synthesized with deionized water under hydrothermal conditions had the strongest electrochemical performance. They exhibited extraordinary catalytic activity with a very low overpotential of 222 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), the smallest impedance and excellent electrochemical stability. These results not only demonstrate the possibility of preparing low-cost OER catalysts based on transition metal phosphate, but also aid our understanding of the controllable synthesis process of different morphologies.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000646673500001	33794511

Nanosheets of CuCo2S4 are realized from a hydrothermal synthesis method in which the average thickness of the sheets is found to be in the range of 815 nm. Aggregated nanosheets form a highly open hierarchical structure. When used as an electrocatalyst, CuCo2S4 nanosheets offer an overpotential value of 310 mV at a 10 mA cm(2) current density, which remains consistent for 10000 measured cycles in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. A chronoamperometric study reveals constant oxygen evolution for 12 h at a 10 mV s(-1) scan rate without any degradation of the activity. Furthermore, the calculated mass activity of the CuCo2S4 electrocatalyst is found to be 14.29 A/g and to afford a TOF value of 0.1431 s(-1) at 310 mV at a mass loading of 0.7 mg cm(-2). For comparison, nanostructures of Co3S4 and Cu0.5Co2.5S4 have been synthesized using a similar method followed for CuCo2S4. When compared to the OER activities among these three thiospinels and standard IrO2, CuCo2S4 nanosheets offered the highest OER activities at the same mass loading (0.7 mg/cm(-2)). Extensive X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance analyses for a mechanistic study reveal that introduction of Cu into the Co3S4 lattice enhances the oxygen evolution and kinetics by offering Cu2+ sites for utilitarian adsorption of OH, O, and OOH reactive species and also by offering a highly active high-spin state of octahedral Co3+ for OER catalysis.									323	17	0	0	6	0	326			2155-5435			WOS:000410005700035

In this work, we synthesized highly efficient OER electrocatalysts in alkaline solution by carbonization of polydopamine (PDA)-functionalized cobalt-doped lanthanum nickelate perovskite nanorod (La5Ni3Co2) complexes. The calcination temperature and molar ratio for La, Ni, and Co were optimized. The as-prepared complex with a molar ratio of 5:3:2 (La:Ni:Co) and a calcination temperature of 500 degrees C displayed enhanced OER activity and excellent durability. In 1.0 M KOH, the overpotential of the as-prepared catalyst at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was 0.360 V, which is comparable to those of noble metal-based materials or perovskite-based materials. The Tafel slope is 48.1 mV dec(-1), which is smaller than those of prepared composites. The satisfactory oxygen evolution activity could be attributed to the increased Co3O4, O-2(2-)/O-, pyridine N, and quaternary N species after calcination treatment, and the improved amount of Ni3+ during the OER process, as well as the high surface area and electrochemical surface area.									8	0	0	0	0	0	7			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000498821300057	31620767

In this work, a nickel foam (NF) supported hierarchical MnCo2O4 nanowire@NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) heterostructure (labeled as MCO@NiFe-LDH/NF) was constructed using a hydrothermal-annealing-hydrothermal route. Electrochemical tests showed that the as-constructed MCO@NiFe-LDH/NF could be used as an integral electrode for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. To get the current density of -10 mA cm(-2) for HER or 100 mA cm(-2) for OER, an overpotential of 129/283 mV was separately required. In a two-electrode system with MCO@NiFe-LDH/NF as both the anode and cathode, 1.55/1.705 V of cell voltage was needed to reach current density of 10/100 mA cm(-2). More importantly, the as-constructed integral electrode could continuously catalyze for 200 h, full water splitting at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2), demonstrating prominent long-term stability.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				1466-8033		WOS:000698789900001

Developing low-cost and durable alternatives to precious-metal catalysts with high activity for OER are highly desirable to reduce the processing cost and complexity of renewable energy systems. Recently, metal phosphides based on earth-abundant transition metals, especially bimetallic phosphates have emerged as promising candidates for efficient OER catalysts. The rational design of nanostructured bimetallic phosphates is critical for the practical applications of these electrocatalysts, which requires a well understanding of the composition control and nanocrystal growth process. Herein, we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of novel iron-cobalt bimetallic phosphides (FeCoP) with hollow structures by phosphating Fe (Co)-centered metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The resultant FeCoP hollow polyhedron, which have large specific surface area providing rich catalytic active sites, show excellent electrocatalytic activity towards OER with low overpotential, small Tafel slope, and remarkable stability. This work provides a new strategy for exploring efficient phosphide catalysts and opens up new avenues for the development of OER catalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

K-23 promotes the oxygen evolution and DCIP photoreduction at low concentration and inhibits them at relatively high concentrations, while an efficient inhibition at low concentration is found in variable fluorescence. These data further confirm that the inhibitor K-23 action is based on its redox interaction rather than quenching effect. Addition of DPC could not restore the DCIP photoreduction activity. It is suggested that the inhibitory site is at the acceptor side. Using ferricyanide as electron acceptor, the effect of K-23 and DCMU on the oxygen evolution of trypsin-treated thylakoids was investigated. It is found that oxygen evolution of trypsin-treated thylakoids was insensitive to DCMU, whereas became more sensitive to K-23 and also the promotion of K-23 at low concentration disappeared. This strongly indicates that trypsin treatment modified the binding site of K-23 and increased its accessibility to K-23 target site. From the comparison of K-23 with DCMU, we conclude that the binding site of K-23 is different from that of DCMU even though they both bind at the acceptor side. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The content of nickel oxide in the coatings depends on the conditions in which they were obtained. Using the potentiodynamic method, for these composite layers the polarisation curves of the oxygen electroevolution process from the 1 M KOH solution were determined. For comparison, curves were also plotted for copper and an amorphous Ni-P electrode. The electrodes were subjected to anode-cathode cycling in the range from the potential of oxygen evolution to the potential of hydrogen evolution. For the modified electrode materials, the characteristics of the oxygen electroevolution process were again determined. From these results the influence of the electrode material, and also the influence and advantage of preliminary modification of the surfaces of the electrodes on the process of oxygen evolution in an alkaline environment, were estimated. It was indicated that a correlation exists between the values of the exchange current of the oxygen electroevolution reaction and the electrooxidation ability of ethanoloamine on the electrode materials studied.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0040-6090			WOS:A1995TK28500008

In this work, owing to a Co-based zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF-67) that effectively inhibited WS2 growth, few-layered WS2 was confined to the surface of Co, N-doped carbon polyhedron (WS2@ Co9S8), with more marginal active sites and higher conductivity, which promoted efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For the first time, WS2@Co9S8 was prepared by mixing in one pot of a liquid phase and calcination, and WS2 realized uniform distribution on the polyhedron surface by electrostatic adsorption in the liquid phase. The obtained hybrid catalyst exhibited excellent OER and HER catalytic activity, and the OER potential was only 15 mV at 10 mA cm-2 higher than that of noble metal oxide (RuO2). The improvement of catalytic activity can be attributed to the enhanced exposure of sulfur edge sites by WS2, the unique synergistic effect between WS2 and Co9S8 on the metal- organic framework (MOF) surface, and the effective shortening of the diffusion path by the hollow multi-channel structure. Therefore, the robust catalyst (WS2@Co9S8) prepared by a simple and efficient synthesis method in this work will serve as a highly promising bifunctional catalyst for OER and HER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000823004800001	35466672

A 10 g sample of high-Ti basalt 70035 was reduced with hydrogen in seven experiments at temperatures of 900-1050-degrees-C and pressures of 14.7-150 psia. In all experiments, water evolution began almost immediately and was essentially complete in tens of minutes. Oxygen yields ranged from 2.93 to 4.61% of the starting sample weight, and showed weak dependence on temperature and pressure. Analysis of the solid samples demonstrated total reduction of Fe2+ in ilmenite and small degrees of reduction in olivine and pyroxene. TiO2 Was also partially reduced to one or more suboxides. Data from these experiments provide a basis for predicting the yield of oxygen from lunar basalt as well as new constraints on natural reduction in the lunar regolith.									22	1	0	0	0	0	23			2169-9097	2169-9100		WOS:A1994NQ25200004

GaN: ZnO was modified with nanoparticulate Mn3O4, RuO2, and IrO2 as O-2 evolution cocatalysts and with core/shell-type Rh/Cr2O3 composites as H-2 evolution cocatalysts. The photocatalytic activity of the coloaded samples for overall water splitting was higher than that of the samples modified with either of the O-2 or H-2 evolution cocatalysts alone. The activity enhancement induced by coloading was comparable for the three O-2 evolution cocatalysts investigated at the optimized loading amounts. Loading of a more efficient Rh/Cr2O3 cocatalyst prepared by adsorption of Rh nanoparticles further improved the photocatalytic activity. It was concluded that a simultaneous improvement in both oxidation and reduction reactions was effective at enhancing the photocatalytic activity of GaN:ZnO, whereas the reduction reactions limited the overall reaction rate of the coloaded system more significantly.									44	3	0	0	5	0	45			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000336741600021

Herein, the uniform and high-density W-doped ultra-small RuP2 (W0.05-RuP2@C3N4-NC) are synthesized by incorporating oxygen-bridged [WO4] tetrahedron into tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-melamino-formaldehyde (MF) ligands. EDTA-MF shows strong metal-support interaction, dedicating to the optimal dispersion, highest Ru yields, and HER activity. W atoms regulate local electron structure and coordination environment, leading to faster proton supply and hydrogen release, thus achieving 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotential of 27 mV (alkaline) and 66 mV (acidic). Notably, W-0.05-RuP2@C3N4-NC maintains stability with staged 500-1000 mA cm(-2) for 1000 h in alkaline, and 1000 mA cm(-2) for -300 h in acid, ascribing to the immobilized ultra-stable RuP2 nanoclusters via EDTA-MF and metal-oxygen sites. The excellent activity and stability hold promise for industrial hydrogen production, which provides deeper insights into catalyst-support interaction and reasonable design of high Ru-loading electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000787903800004

However, a further improvement in battery performance with the MnO2 catalyst is limited by its low electronic conductivity and catalytic activity, which strongly depend on the morphology and composition. In this work, we develop a carbon and binder-free MnO2-x nanosheets/stainless steel (SS) cathode via a simple and effective electrodeposition-solvothermal route. The created Mn(III) and oxygen vacancy in MnO2-x nanosheets allows an significant increase in the electronic conductivity and catalytic activity. It is experimentally shown that the use of the present nanostructure MnO2-x/SS cathode in a non-aqueous lithium-oxygen battery results in a rechargeable specific capacity of 7300 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g(-1), which is 39% higher than that with the MnO2/SS cathode. In addition, the specific capacities at 400 mA g(-1) and 800 mA g(-1) reach 5249 mAh g(-1) and 2813 mAh g(-1), respectively, which are over 30% higher than that with the MnO2/SS cathode. Furthermore, the discharge/charge cycle test shows no degradation for 120 cycles. All the results show that the present nanostructure MnO2-x/SS cathode is a promising candidate for high-performance lithium-oxygen batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, these future generation energy-storage devices are still subject to technical limitations, including a squat round-trip efficiency and a deprived rate-capability, due to the slow-moving electrochemical kinetics of both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) over the surface of the cathode catalyst. Because the electrochemistry of LOBs is rather complex, only a limited range of cathode catalysts has been employed in the past. To understand the catalytic mechanisms involved and improve overall cell performance, the development of new cathode electrocatalysts with enhanced round-trip efficiency is extremely important. In this context, transition metal carbides and nitrides (TMCs and TMNs, respectively) have been explored as potential catalysts to overcome the slow kinetics of electrochemical reactions. To provide an accessible and up-to-date summary for the research community, the present paper reviews the recent advancements of TMCs and TMNs and its applications as active electrocatalysts for LOBs. In particular, significant studies on the rational design of catalysts and the properties of TMC/TMN in LOBs are discussed, and the prospects and challenges facing the continued development of TMC/TMN electrocatalysts and strategies for attaining higher OER/ORR activity in LOBs are presented.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2079-4991		WOS:000594313900001	33114076

Nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) has been considered a potential catalyst for OER Herein, we report a simple/green approach to improve the oxygen evolution activity of NiFe LDH supported on carbon black (CB). Specifically, ultrasonic exfoliation (UIP500hd, 20 kHz, 500 W) in pure water has been applied to boost the activity of NiFe LDH/CB towards OER. The exfoliated NiFe LDH/CB nanosheets display significantly higher OER activity than their corresponding bulk NiFe LDH/CB in an alkaline solution, with an overpotential of 220 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is 60 mV lower than the 280 mV of the bulk NiFe LDH/CB. Notably, it is comparable with the current record overpotential (similar to 200 mV) and superior than other non-precious catalysts. Additionally, after exfoliation, it possesses outstanding kinetics (Tafel slope of 35 mV dec(-1)) for OER. Besides the improved activity, the exfoliated NiFe LDH/CB has shown a high stability with nearly a constant potential through 12h electrolysis at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The characterization analysis reveal that the improved electrochemical performance is closely related to the synergistic effects of the Ni2+ and Fe2+ enriched surface of the exfoliated NiFe LDH/CB, as well as single/few layers structure after exfoliation.									39	1	0	0	3	0	39			1350-4177	1873-2828		WOS:000488417100038	31421616

Mesoporous materials offer an attractive route for generating efficient electrocatalysts with high mass transport capabilities. Herein, we report an efficient hard templating pathway to design and synthesize three-dimensional (3-D) mesoporous ternary nickel iron nitride (Ni3FeN). The as-synthesized electrocatalyst shows good OER performance in an alkaline solution with low overpotential (259 mV) and a small Tafel slope (54 mV dec(-1)), giving superior performance to IrO2 and RuO2 catalysts. The highly active contact area, the hierarchical porosity, and the synergistic effect of bimetal atoms contributed to the improved electrocatalytic performance toward OER. In a practical rechargeable Zn-air battery, mesoporous Ni3FeN is also shown to deliver a lower charging voltage and longer lifetime than RuO2. This work opens up a new promising approach to synthesize active OER electrocatalysts for energy-related devices.									38	6	0	0	1	0	39			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000521560100001	34138285

Structural design of durable non-noble nanomaterials as bifunctional OER/ORR catalysts is a major drawback to commercial applications. Herein, we exposed a strongly coupled hybrid material comprising of NiFeP-cubes nanoparticles supported on three-dimensional interconnected Fe,N-decorated carbon (3D-FeNC) as a robust bifunctional ORR/OER catalyst. The strongly coupled NiFeP@3D-FeNC catalyst shows better electron and mass transfer capability, exposure of abundant ORR/OER active sites on the surface, and strongly coupled effects. Accordingly, the as-prepared NiFeP@3D-FeNC catalyst exhibits robust ORR activity (half-wave potential of 0.84 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) and OER performance (over-potential 0.25 V@10 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline media. Significantly, the oxygen electrode prepared from the NiFeP@3D-FeNC catalyst further demonstrated superior charge/discharge behavior and long-lasting rechargeability than the benchmark Pt/C + IrO2 catalyst in rechargeable zinc-O-2 batteries. This approach opens up a new avenue for the synthesis and advanced the hybrid nanomaterials for various applications.									48	2	0	0	3	0	49			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000455561200072	30543400

The tungsten oxynitride carrier decorated with oxygen vacancies can improve the conductivity and electrochemical stability of the catalyst. At the same time, it offers strong anchoring interaction and ensures good dispersion for the loaded Co metals, thus achieving high catalytic activity and durability. Theoretical calculations show that electron transfer occurs at the interface between WNO and Co4 leading to a higher accumulation of electrons around the Co site, promoting the ORR reaction kinetics. Due to these advantages, 3DOM Co@WNO was found to possess ORR activity comparable to Pt/C and superior primary Zn-air battery performance over Pt/C and excellent stability as well. This study advances the evolvement of high-efficiency and durable ORR electrocatalysts using intrinsically robust and conductive oxynitride support strategy with strong metal-support interactions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000822986300004

Excitation of localized surface plasmonic resonance on plasmonic metals under illumination can generate hot electrons that assist in the catalytic reaction. However, the correlation between the microstructural geometry, dielectric environment, internal energy flow in the hybrid structure, and the chemical reaction rate is so far not clear. Here, a composite with a plasmonic Au metal yolk and a nearly transparent Ni3S2 shell is designed to maximize the absorption of incident light by forming strong localized surface plasmonic resonance at the yolk as predicted by 3D finite element method. The incoming photoenergy is dominantly dissipated on the shell by forming electron-hole pairs, leading to higher energy flow rate for oxygen evolution reaction. The overpotential is 252 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and the catalytic activity of Au@Ni3S2 achieves ca. 85-fold that of pure Ni3S2 under illumination and surpasses the commercial IrO2 catalyst. The study opens the door of exploration of highly effective hybrid composite catalysts for energy applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-7350			WOS:000458309700016

Here, we report atomically dispersed nickel coordinated with nitrogen and sulfur species in porous carbon nanosheets as an electrocatalyst exhibiting excellent activity and durability for OER with a low overpotential of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1) in alkaline media. Such electrocatalyst represents the best among all reported transition metal- and/or heteroatom-doped carbon electrocatalysts and is even superior to benchmark Ir/C. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the well-dispersed molecular S vertical bar NiNx species act as active sites for catalyzing OER. The atomic structure of S vertical bar NiNx centers in the carbon matrix is clearly disclosed by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy together with computational simulations.

Herein, a carbon-encapsulated FeWO4-Ni3S2 with 3D spherical flower-like nanosheets structure is prepared by solvothermal and calcination. It only needs low overpotentials for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER, eta(10) = 200 mV) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, eta(10) = 50 mV) in 1.0 M KOH. Besides, it could operate stably for 100 h at large current density of 1,000 mA cm(-2) in industrial condition (6.0 M KOH, 60?) for overall water splitting (OWS), suggesting great industrial potential. Such good performance could be owing to: (1) Carbon-encapsulated structure can prevent the catalyst from corrosion in alkaline environment; (2) The modification of Ni3S2 to FeWO4 can enhance the intrinsic activity; (3) The unique 3D spherical flower-like nanosheets morphology could offer numerous active sites, and is beneficial for enhancing the stability by the desorption of bubbles.

The surface properties were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. Integration of the voltammetric curves provided the voltammetric charge, q*, which is proportional to the active surface area. Kinetic data showed that Cl-2 evolution occurs with a single mechanism over the whole explored potential range and at all electrode compositions. Fractional reaction orders with respect to both Cl- and H+ revealed double-layer effects attributed to the occurrence of Cl- specific adsorption. The apparent activity increased with CeO2 content, whereas the true electrocatalytic properties, estimated by normalizing the current to unit surface charge, decreased in the presence of CeO2 with a minimum of 10% CeO2. The presence of CeO2 also makes the oxide layers more prone to mechanical erosion by the evolving gas bubbles.

O-2 inhibits CO2 fixation by stimulating photorespiration, thus reducing plant production. O-2 interacts with photosynthetic electron transport in the chloroplasts' thylakoids in two main ways: by accepting electrons from PSI (Mehler reaction); and by accepting electrons from reduced plastoquinone (PQ) mediated by the plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX). In this study, we show, using 101 plant species, that there is a difference in the potential for photosynthetic electron flow to O-2 between angiosperms and gymnosperms. We found, from measurements of Chl fluorescence and leaf absorbance at 830 nm, (i) that electron outflow from PSII, as determined by decay kinetics of Chl fluorescence after application of a saturating light pulse, is more rapid in gymnosperms than in angiosperms; (ii) that the reaction center Chl of PSI (P700) is rapidly and highly oxidized in gymnosperms during induction of photosynthesis; and (iii) that these differences are dependent on oxygen. Finally, rates of O-2 uptake measured by mass spectrometry in the absence of photorespiration were significantly promoted by illumination in dark-adapted leaves of gymnosperms, but not in those of angiosperms. The light-stimulated O-2 uptake was around 10% of the maximum O-2 evolution in gymnosperms and 1% in angiosperms. These results suggest that gymnosperms have increased capacity for electron leakage to oxygen in photosynthesis compared with angiosperms. The involvement of the Mehler reaction and PTOX in the electron flow to O-2 is discussed.									62	1	0	0	58	0	62			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000321461300010	23624674

Many attempts have been made to develop metal-free catalysts, but the lack of understanding of active-sites at the atomic-level has slowed the design of highly active and stable metal-free catalysts. A sequential two-step strategy to dope sulfur into carbon nanotube-graphene nanolobes is developed. This bidoping strategy introduces stable sulfur-carbon active-sites. Fluorescence emission of the sulfur K-edge by X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) and scanning transmission electron microscopy electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) mapping and spectra confirm that increasing the incorporation of heterocyclic sulfur into the carbon ring of CNTs not only enhances OER activity with an overpotential of 350 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), but also retains 100% of stability after 75 h. The bidoped sulfur carbon nanotube-graphene nanolobes behave like the state-of-the-art catalysts for OER but outperform those systems in terms of turnover frequency (TOF) which is two orders of magnitude greater than (20% Ir/C) at 400 mV overpotential with very high mass activity 1000 mA cm(-2) at 570 mV. Moreover, the sulfur bidoping strategy shows high catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Stable bifunctional (ORR and OER) catalysts are low cost, and light-weight bidoped sulfur carbon nanotubes are potential candidates for next-generation metal-free regenerative fuel cells.									245	10	0	0	7	0	244			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000372525500008

Platinum-group metal (PGM)-free materials have been intensively investigated as alternatives to replace the well-accepted but costly PGM-based catalysts such as Pt for ORR and Ir/Ru (oxides) for OER. Particularly, metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived carbon materials are emerging PGM-free catalysts for ORR/OER. So far, excellent works have been achieved to enhance the activity and durability of the MOF-derived PGM-free catalysts. It is the occasion to promote the PGM-free catalysts to the next level of application, i.e. in real devices. However, ORR/OER in real devices are potentially subject to the porosity related challenges, e.g. electron/mass transfer issue and active site isolation in organic Li-air batteries. To address these challenges, the rational design of porous electrocatalyst for devices is required. In this review, we summarize the most recent progress of MOF-derived carbon materials for ORR/OER with the focus on not only the active site engineering but also the design of porous structure. We also provide perspectives on the rational design of PGM-free catalysts using MOF as precursors. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The nanocrystalline Ni-Mo alloy coatings were deposited at different cathode current densities (c.d.) on copper substrate. The electrocatalytic activity of the electrodeposits for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH were evaluated by electrochemical techniques like cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry (CP). The corrosion stability of the Ni-Mo alloys was tested in same alkaline medium by potentiodynamic polarization study. The experiment results demonstrated thatNi-Mo alloy deposited, respectively at 1.0 A dm(-2) (38.3 wt.% Mo) and 4.0 A dm(-2) (33.2 wt.% Mo) are good electrode materials for HER and OER. Further, Ni-Mo alloy deposited at 4.0 A dm(-2) was found to be most corrosion resistant in the alkaline medium. The electrocatalytic activity of Ni-Mo alloys were explained in terms of their surface morphology, phase structure and chemical composition, confirmed by XRD, SEM and EDX analysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2297-3400			WOS:000409365000016

However, the OWS system usually requires large energy consumption due to the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction. Herein, we fabricated a PtCu nanoalloy (PtCu-NA) through a template-assisted method and evaluated its bifunctional activities for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M KOH and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) in 1 M KOH + 1 M hydrazine. Remarkably, the interplanar crystal spacing of PtCu-NA was larger than that of standard PtCu and closer to that of Pt, which can be attributed to the template-assisted synthesis method. Thus, the as-prepared PtCu-NA needs low overpotentials of 224 and 668 mV to drive HER and HzOR at 100 and 200 mA cm(-2), respectively, which are much better than those of commercial Pt/C (453 and 1081 mV). After coupling the HER and HzOR together, the overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) cell needs a small voltage of 0.666 V to deliver 200 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH + 1 M hydrazine, outperforming the Pt/C (0.792 V). Impressively, the assembly OHzS cell could run stably for more than 110 h. These performances can be attributed to the regulation of the crystal structure of the PtCu alloy and the synergistic effect between Pt and Cu.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2574-0962			WOS:000840778000001

Most existing synthetic routes require high temperature to ensure the uniform mixing of various elements, making the synthesis highly challenging. Here, for the first-time novel carbon fiber supported high-entropy Co-Zn-Cd-Cu-Mn sulfide (CoZnCdCuMnS@CF) nanoarrays are fabricated by the mild cation exchange strategy. Benefiting from the synergistic effect among multiple metals and the strong interfacial bonding between high-entropy Co-Zn-Cd-Cu-Mn sulfide nanoarrays and the carbon fiber support, CoZnCdCuMnS@CF exhibits superior catalytic activity and stability toward overall water splitting in alkaline medium. Impressively, CoZnCdCuMnS@CF only needs low overpotentials of 173 and 220 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), with excellent durability for over 70 and 113 h for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) respectively. More importantly, the bifunctional electrode (CoZnCdCuMnS@CF parallel to CoZnCdCuMnS@CF) for overall water splitting can deliver a small cell voltage of 1.63 V to afford 10 mA.cm(-2) and exhibit outstanding stability of negligible decay after 73 h continuous operation. This work provides a viable synthesis route toward advanced high-entropy materials with great potential applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000784880200002

Here, the general synthesis of ultrathin metal borate (i.e., Co-B-i, Ni-B-i, and Fe-B-i) nanomeshes is reported by capitalizing on 3D bark-like N-doped carbon (denoted BNC) as nanoreactors. Indeed, this strategy is straightforward, only comprising a one-step reaction between metal cations and sodium borohydride without using templates. As nanoreactors, the BNC derived from biomass waste of lychee exocarp possesses distinctive advantages of low cost, fractured textures, porous nanostructures (surface area: 1915.5 m(2) g(-1)), electronegative surface (zeta potential: -43.4 mV), and superhydrophilicity for greatly facilitating the adsorption of metal cations with strong strength to effectively control the growth of 2D nanomeshes. The as-synthesized Co-B-i and Ru-doped Co-B-i (Ru-Co-B-i) nanomeshes exhibit excellent performance for the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively. Impressively, the water splitting device based on the Co-B-i and Ru-Co-B-i nanomeshes can enable a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small cell voltage of 1.53 V. Therefore, this work paves new avenues for the facile synthesis of ultrathin metal nanomeshes.									41	4	0	0	2	0	41			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000477664700005

The use of laser ablation for the study of uranium plasma chemistry in atmospheric ablation plumes is highly relevant for nuclear forensics and standoff detection, but the behavior of such systems is currently not well understood. One of the main difficulties in studying these systems is that the already considerable complexity of plume dynamics in vacuum conditions is further enhanced by shockwave formation and plasma-chemical behavior in reactive, atmospheric environments. Therefore, in order to understand the ablation dynamics of an atmospheric uranium ablation system, both the transport and kinetics of the reactive uranium plasma plume have to be accounted for. In this work, we present a two-dimensional compressible, reactive, multi-species fluid model of the early stages of femtosecond uranium plume expansion in atmospheric oxygen. This model utilizes a previously constructed uranium-oxygen plasma chemistry reaction mechanism consisting of 172 reaction channels and 30 species in order to treat the reaction kinetics of a uranium ablation plume. The model captures both the complex compressible dynamics of the ablation shockwave and the stratification of the ablation plume into regions of varying reactivities and molecular compositions due to the plasma-chemical interactions between the plume and the reactive atmosphere. The result is a detailed picture of the spatial and temporal evolution of both the fluid moments and the major plasma-chemical species concentrations of the ablation plume.

Here, the colloidal synthesis of earth-abundant electrocatalysts of Mo-Ni nanoparticles for efficient water splitting by thermal decomposition of Ni(acac)(2) and Mo(CO)(6) in the presence of 1-octadecene and oleylamine at 320 degrees C is reported. It is shown that the optimized catalysts (Mo0.6Ni0.4) only require low overpotentials of 0.065 V for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and of 290 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in KOH (1.0 m). The as-prepared Mo-Ni alloy nanoparticles also show extraordinary durability for both the HER and OER. A low potential of approximate to 1.62 V is required to yield a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) when utilizing the alloy nanoparticles as bifunctional catalysts in a two-electrode electrolyzer system. The ease of preparing either rigid or flexible high-performance electrodes by making use of the alloy nanoparticle electrocatalysts without the need for binder further suggests the attractive application of colloidally stable nanoparticles in the field of electrochemical water splitting.									33	1	0	0	0	0	33			2196-7350			WOS:000437727600030

Herein, a novel electrocatalyst of cobalt (Co) and nitrogen (N) doped graphdiyne (Co-N-GDY) was designed and synthesized using a facile method with just a small amount of Co precursor to reach up to 1.3wt % based on XPS data. Among them, the 1% Co-N-GDY, synthesized with 1wt % of Co in the preparation stage, was demonstrated as the most effective ORR and HER catalyst. Due to the synergistic effect of Co, N, GDY and strong interaction between Co and GDY, the Co-N-GDY exhibited excellent ORR and HER catalytic performance. As for ORR, the activity of 1% Co-N-GDY is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C. Especially the half-wave potential of 1% Co-N-GDY is superior to most previously reported Co-based carbon materials. In HER, the 1% Co-N-GDY shows a low onset overpotential of 97 mV and a small Tafel slope of 132mV per decade, which exhibits comparable or even better performance than many reported non-precious metals catalysts.

Here, CoOx/N-doped graphene/polymeric carbon nitride (CoOx/NG/PCN) hybrid was prepared by thermal annealing method. The introduction of NG greatly prevented the aggregation of CoOx nanoparticles. Further doping PCN into CoOx/NG, CoOx/NG/PCN showed wrinkle and cross-linked structure. And the introduction of PCN can effectively increase the contents of pyridinic N and numbers of O defects to result in the improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Detailed experiments suggested that the onset and half-wave potentials (E-onset and E-1(/2)) of CoOx/NG positively shifted of 110 and 100 mV, respectively compared to pure CoOx nanoparticles. When further doping PCN into CoOx/NG, E-onset and E-1(/2) were further positively shifted of 40 and 110 mV, respectively. More importantly, such ORR activity exhibited comparative activity and even more superior stability and excellent methanol tolerance than commercial Pt/C. Additionally, the resulted CoOx/NG/PCN also showed superior OER activity. Compared with CoOx/NG and CoOx, the overpotential of CoOx/NG/PCN for 10 mA/cm(2) current densities was decreased for 160 mV and 180 mV, respectively. Especially, the investigation herein may assist in a new insight to bond configurations modification of catalysts and can be extended to other catalytic systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Ni-based catalyst is perceived as a promising electrocatalyst due to its excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. Herein, beta-Ni(OH)(2)/NF is designed for OER and HER, using a facile hydrothermal etching method. The separation rate of hydroxide is controlled by the copper-ammonium complexation reaction, and the different amounts of oleic acid is added as a protective agent to regulate the surface morphology of the Ni foam. The ingenious combination of several reactants allows us to synthesize different morphology catalysts, and get the best performance from them. The catalyst exhibits superior OER and HER electrocatalytic performance, which overpotential is 329 mV during the OER and 170 mV for the HER at 50 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, it demonstrates small Tafel slopes of 51 mV dec(-1) for HER and 40 mV dec-1 for OER in 1.0 M KOH solution. Moreover, the catalyst presents a stable activity with no significant attenuation after 24 h OER and HER reaction. The hydrothermal etching method is expected to offer an adjustable synthetic strategy for the reasonable design of highly efficient, durable and non-noble-metal bifunction catalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000626266700007

In contrast to conventional transition metal alloys, high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have immense potential to maximize their catalytic properties because of their high stability and compositional diversity as oxygen evolution reactions (OERs). This work presents medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) as OER electrocatalysts to simultaneously satisfy the requirement of high catalytic activity and long-term stability. The surface of MEA electrocatalyst is tailored to suit the OER via anodizing and cyclic voltammetry activation methods. Optimized electrical properties and hydrophilicity of the surface enable an extremely low overpotential of 187 mV for achieving the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) alkaline media. Furthermore, a combined photovoltaic-electrochemical system with MEA electrocatalyst and a perovskite/Si tandem solar cell exhibits a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 20.6% for an unassisted hydrogen generation system. These results present a new pathway for designing sustainable high efficiency water splitting cells.									7	0	0	0	0	0	6			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000745482100001	35064754

Inspired by our recent study on high-performance HER catalyst using the nanostructured CoMoO4 center dot nH(2)O precursor, herein, we report a facile synthesis of Co1-xFexOOH catalyst derived from the same precursor and its excellent electrocatalytic properties towards the OER in alkaline electrolytes. A core-shell structured nanocatalyst consisting of disordered Co1-xFexOOH layer over the surface of crystalline CoMoO4 center dot nH(2)O nanosheets was synthesized using a simple hydrothermal method followed by anodic electrooxidation. Thus-prepared catalyst exhibited extraordinarily high and stable activity towards the OER in alkaline electrolyte, which outperformed most Co-based OER catalysts. Combined with the HER catalyst derived from the same CoMoO4 center dot nH(2)O precursor as the cathode, we further developed and tested a simple water-splitting cell, which significantly surpasses the benchmarking IrO2-Pt/C couple (1.63 V) and requires a voltage of only 1.517 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution. Density functional theory calculations were conducted to gain insight into the Fe-doping induced improvement of OER activity. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, MoNi alloy nanograins are embedded in Mo-doped NiO nanosheets by partial reduction treatment, which vertically grow on three-dimensional (3D) nitrogen-doped graphene foam substrate (MoNi@Mo-NiO@NGF). The hybrid composite demonstrates superb bifunctional electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions. Especially, it possesses the ultra-low hydrogen evolution overpotential of 56 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline condition. The excellent catalytic activity and remarkable stability can be attributed to the optimized surface electronic structure of MoNi alloy by Mo doping, the synergy interface interaction between MoNi nanograins and Mo-NiO substrate, and the high conductivity and corrosion resistance of NGF support. Thus, this work provides a new strategy for the highperformance catalyst towards overall water splitting by the dual regulation of surface and interface.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000820619400004

Here, we demonstrate that the nature of alkali metal cations can profoundly impact the oxygen evolution activity of surface-mounted metal-organic framework (SURMOF) derived electrocatalysts, which are based on NiFe(OOH). In situ Raman spectroscopy results show that Raman shifts of the Ni-O bending vibration are inversely proportional to the mass activities from Cs+ to Li+. Particularly, a laser-induced current transient technique was introduced to study the cation-dependent electric double layer properties and their effects on the activity. The catalytic trend appeared to be closely related to the potential of maximum entropy of the system, suggesting a strong cation impact on the interfacial water layer structure. Our results highlight how the electrolyte composition can be used to maximize the performance of SURMOF derivatives toward electrochemical water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000783561600001	35274423

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is integral to nearly all material and fuel electrosyntheses. However, very little is known about the structural evolution of the OER electrocatalyst, especially the amorphous layer that forms from the crystalline structure. Here, we investigate the interfacial transformation of the SrIrO3 OER electrocatalyst. The SrIrO(3 )amorphization is initiated by the lattice oxygen redox, a step that allows Sr2+ to diffuse and O2- to reorganize the SrIrO(3 )structure. This activation turns SrIrO3 into a highly disordered Ir octahedral network with Ir square-planar motif. The final SryIrOx exhibits a greater degree of disorder than IrOx made from other processing methods. Our results demonstrate that the structural reorganization facilitated by coupled ionic diffusions is essential to the disordered structure of the SrIrO3 electrocatalyst.									60	1	0	0	2	0	59			2375-2548			WOS:000606331400013	33523986

In this work, NiTe2/Ni(OH)(2) hybrid nanosheet is successfully fabricated on carbon fiber cloth by a successive hydrothermal reaction for the first time, showing excellent catalytic performance for both electrochemical water oxidation and urea oxidation reaction. Benefiting from the unique electron property of NiTe2 and strong synergistic interaction between NiTe2 and Ni(OH)(2), the as-obtained hybrid catalyst only need an overpotential of 267 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, and achieve 73 mA/cm(2) at 1.523 V in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea. The innovation of this work is the incorporation of NiTe2 and Ni(OH)(2) to boost its catalytic ability. This novel method is expected to provide new chance for developing efficient catalysts for energy conversion application.									33	2	0	0	2	0	33			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000510947000073

To avoid air sparging and achieve automatic pH regulation, we proposed a three-electrode E-Fenton system which utilized the electrochemically produced O-2 from anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and localized pH conditions near electrodes. In order to address the external demand of O-2 for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, two-electron transfer) compared to the O-2 supply from OER (four-electron transfer) in the two-electrode system, an additional cathode (primary reaction as hydrogen evolution reaction, HER) was introduced to increase OER current for enhanced O-2 production. With set current of -5 mA for the additional cathode, the equivalent oxygen supply rate at the anode was 1.9 mL h(-1), resulting in a maximum H2O2 concentration of 20.9 mg L-1 and Rhodamine B removal of 97.4% within 120 min. The contaminant removal was much higher than that of 5.0% for twoelectrode E-Fenton systems without aeration. Proton generation from the anode gradually developed the acidic environment (pH 2.9-3.1) in the treatment zone, which was beneficial for (OH)-O-center dot formation and contaminant removal. The aqueous pH was eventually neutralized by OH produced from the cathodes, and the final pH was 6.1. Our system represents a promising approach for groundwater electrochemical remediation with efficient contaminant removal and pH regulations. (C)2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence for the presence of Ce3+ and Co2+ as well as Co4+ and Co3+ ions revealed by XPS measurements as well as XRD analysis indicates that a CeCoO2.5 brownmillerite phase may be extruded to the surface. A surface Co4+/Co3+ couple is known to be a good OER catalyst. The performance of the SCCO-based catalysts is better at higher current rates (>0.1 mA cm(-2)) than that of Vulcan XC-72 and even close to that of the 50% Pt/carbon-black catalyst. This catalyst could be used in a metal/air battery or a PEM fuel cell as an efficient and stable bifunctional catalyst.									130	4	0	0	6	1	134			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:000307790300031

In this report, surface modification was introduced as a potential approach to generate hybrid electrocatalyst. The immobilized polymer brush, poly(1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium) (PAMI), was used as a nanostructured template for guiding the electrochemical deposition of metallic nanoparticles (Pd, Pt). The intrinsic properties of the polymer brush in term of nanostructured architecture and the anions mobility within the polymer was exploited to generate a hybrid electrocatalyst. The latter was generated using two different approaches including the direct electrochemical deposition of Pd or Pt metal and the indirect approach through the anion exchange reaction followed by the electrochemical deposition under self-electrolytic conditions. The hybrid structure based on the polymer/metallic NP exhibits an enhancement of the catalytic performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction with a low Tafel slope and overpotential. Interestingly, the indirect approach leads to decrease the metal loading by two orders of magnitude, when compared to those generated in the absence of the polymeric layer, while retaining the electrocatalytic performance.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000491219700094	31554394

Here, CoFe hydroxide/carbon nanohybrid is reported as an efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalyst derived from the in situ formed molecular Fe-salen complexes and Co2+ ions at a low temperature of 160 degrees C. It has been evidenced that Fe-salen as a molecular precursor facilitates the confined-growth of metal hydroxides, while Co2+ plays a critical role in catalyzing the transformation of organic ligand into nanocarbons and constitutes an essential component for CoFe hydroxide. The resulting Co1.2Fe/C hybrid material requires an overpotential of 260 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with high durability. The high activity is contributed to uniform distribution of CoFe hydroxides on carbon layer and excellent electron conductivity caused by intimate contact between metal and nanocarbon. Given the diversity of molecular precursors, these results represent a promising approach to high-performance carbon-based water splitting catalysts.									22	5	0	0	4	0	22				2198-3844		WOS:000477708000007	31380163

The synthesized PEDOT-CoMn2O4 nanocomposites from alpha-MnO2 nanorod favour 4e oxygen reduction process of oxygen to water and exhibit high ORR activities in the stable conducting platform of the polymer. The catalytic effect is studied by Linear Sweep Voltammetry using Rotating Disk Electrode at varying rotation speed (0 to 3000 rpm). Although the alpha-MnO2 nanorod does not show any OER/ORR activity, the spinel makes the difference and the nanocomposites of PEDOT - CoMn2O4 exhibit unexpected, surprisingly high ORR activities in their conducting and stable form. The enhanced catalytic activity arises from synergetic chemical coupling effects between PEDOT and CoMn2O4. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Although binary phosphides are inexpensive, their performance is not as good as noble metals. Adding a third metal element to binary phosphides (Ni-P, Co-P) provides the opportunity to tune their crystalline and electronic structures and thus their electrocatalytic properties. Here, ternary phosphide (NiCoP) films with different nickel to cobalt ratios via an electrodeposition technique are synthesized. The films have a triple-layered and hierarchical morphology, consisting of nanosheets in the bottom layer, approximate to 90-120 nm nanospheres in the middle layer, and larger spherical particles on the top layer. The ternary phosphides exhibit versatile activities that are strongly dependent on the Ni/Co ratios and Ni0.51Co0.49P film is found to have the best electrocatalytic activities for both hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen evolution reactions. The high performance of the ternary phosphide film is attributed to enhanced electric conductivity so that reaction kinetics is accelerated, enlarged surface area due to the hierarchical and three-layered morphology, and increased local electric dipole so that the energy barrier for the water splitting reaction is lowered.									330	21	0	0	12	0	330			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000388166700011

Recent findings showed that deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) can be employed to reduce the loading of expensive catalysts like Pt and to increase the catalytic activity of catalysts in the streams of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) respectively. Herein, for the very first time, we found an interesting property of DNA in electrocatalysis by a simple and fast physical modification over the gas diffusion layers (GDL). The DNA molecule while embedded over the GDL surface, it has modified the surface phenomenon in addition to the active functional groups to give the electrocatalytic activity. The DNA modified GDL (DGDL) has showed better kinetic trend and activity in both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and HER in alkaline and acidic media respectively. To further ensure the nature of these surface modified GDL, we have utilized other important bio-molecules also and studied their activity in comparison with DNA. For that, we have chosen carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) bio-molecules for the same. In OER in 1 M KOH, to reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density, DGDL required an overpotential of 384 mV compared to CGDL and BGDL which required 402 and 414 mV respectively. Similarly, for HER too, for attaining 10 mA cm(-2), DGDL, CGDL and BGDL required over-potentials 298, 369 and 393 mV respectively. The increase in activity was owing to the presence of surface functionalities that facilitated improved charge transfer kinetics and electrode-electrolyte interaction in an efficient manner. With these fruitful findings in activities, in futuristic, our proposed route can be extended to design various other smart, cost effective and self-standing metal free catalysts in a facile way.

Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are important electrocatalytic processes in electrolyzers and fuel cells. Exploring efficient non-precious metal catalysts for HER and ORR in acidic medium remains a great challenge. Herein, we report that graphene-supported iron-based nanoparticles encapsulated in a nitrogen-doped carbon (Fe@N-C) hybrid material acts as an efficient HER and ORR catalyst. The hybrid material was synthesized by pyrolysis of graphene oxide and ammonia ferric citrate followed by acid-leaching. During the pyrolysis, nitrogen was doped into a graphene lattice, and the carbon nanoshell grown on graphene effectively suppressed the stacking of graphene sheets, exposing more active sites to reactants. The hybrid material showed higher electrocatalytic activities than graphene sheets or Fe@N-C alone, which is probably attributed to the synergetic role of nitrogen-doped graphene and Fe@N-C towards the electrocatalytic reactions.									51	3	0	0	1	0	53			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000350894400010	25612219

Inspired by this concept, a carbon-coated MnCoNi alloy/oxide catalyst (Ox-MnCoNi-C) was synthesized by carbonization of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and controllable reoxidation process. Owing to the synergetic interaction between abundant active sites on the heterogeneous interface and the good electron transfer rate of graphitic carbon, Ox-MnCoNi-C exhibits a low potential gap (Delta E) of 0.79 V. Meanwhile, the assembled liquid zinc-air batteries exhibit high power density (125 mW cm-2), superior primary discharge specific capacity (822 mAh gZn -1), and no less than 100 h of steady charging and discharging operation running at 5 mA cm-2.

Science advances				8	35			eabq6261	eabq6261		10.1126/sciadv.abq6261				2022-Sep-02	2022	Solid-state Li-O2 batteries (SSLOBs) have attracted considerable attention because of their high energy density and superior safety. However, their sluggish kinetics have severely impeded their practical application. Despite efforts to design highly efficient catalysts, efficient oxygen reaction evolution at gas-solid interfaces and fast transport pathways in solid-state electrodes remain challenging. Here, we develop a dual electronic-ionic microenvironment to substantially enhance oxygen electrolysis in solid-state batteries. By designing a lithium-decorative catalyst with an engineering crystal structure, the coordinatively unsaturated sites and high concentration of defects alleviate the limitations of electronic-ionic transport in solid interfaces and create a balanced gas-solid microenvironment for solid-state oxygen electrolysis. This strategy facilitates oxygen reduction reaction, mediates the transport of reaction species, and promotes the decomposition of the discharge products, contributing to a high specific capacity with a stable cycling life. Our work provides previously unknown insight into structure-property relationships in solid-state electrolysis for SSLOBs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2375-2548		MEDLINE:36054349	36054349

To couple the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with low-potential hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) is highly promising to significantly reduce the input cell voltage of water electrolysis, which requires high-performance bifunctional HER and HzOR electrocatalysts. Herein, a newtype Ru nanoparticle/mesoporous N-doped carbon (Ru/MPNC) composite is readily constructed with greatly exposed ultrafine Ru particles fused into N-doped carbon walls, and stabilized by in situ formed robust Ru-N metal-support interaction inherently stemming from the particular precursor, thus exhibiting superior bifunctional HER and HzOR activity, far surpassing commercial Pt/C. Furthermore, the two-electrode electrolyzer only require an ultrasmall cell voltage of 0.149 V to achieve 50 mA cm-2, which can be also easily driven by a direct hydrazine-H2O2 fuel cell to attain a decent H2 production rate of 0.893 mmol h-1. The theoretical calculations uncover the robust integration of Ru with NC can tailor the electronic property of exposed Ru sites, endowing the decreased water dissociation energy barrier, together with optimized adsorption free energies of H* and dehydrogenation intermediates of N2H4.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000811310400005

This approach was used to generate various unitary, binary and ternary amorphous oxides for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution.Amorphous materials have attracted increasing attention in diverse fields due to their unique properties, yet their controllable fabrications still remain great challenges. Here, we demonstrate a top-down strategy for the fabrications of amorphous oxides through the amorphization of hydroxides. The versatility of this strategy has been validated by the amorphizations of unitary, binary and ternary hydroxides. Detailed characterizations indicate that the amorphization process is realized by the variation of coordination environment during thermal treatment, where the M-OH octahedral structure in hydroxides evolves to M-O tetrahedral structure in amorphous oxides with the disappearance of the M-M coordination. The optimal amorphous oxide (FeCoSn(OH)(6)-300) exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in alkaline media, where the turnover frequency (TOF) value is 39.4 times higher than that of FeCoSn(OH)(6). Moreover, the enhanced OER performance and the amorphization process are investigated with density functional theory (DFT) and molecule dynamics (MD) simulations. The reported top-down fabrication strategy for fabricating amorphous oxides, may further promote fundamental research into and practical applications of amorphous materials for catalysis.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2041-1723		WOS:000764895600009	35246554

In this work, we developed a one-step facile hydrothermal approach to successfully synthesize NiS(2)microspheres. By changing the experimental parameters, the reason that affects the formation of nanostructured spheres is investigated and discussed in detail, and the formation mechanism of microspheres is proposed innovatively. Furthermore, electrochemical testing results show that the 7 h-NiS(2)catalyst exhibits a remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an overpotential of 311 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)in 1.0 M KOH, superior to precious metal RuO2. The NiS(2)catalyst also exhibits a robust durability. This work will contributes to the rational design and the understanding of growth mechanism of transition metal chalcogenide electrocatalysts for diverse energy conversion technologies.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000542189000001	32500645

The roughness factors, R-F, of electrodes made of these films were determined by AC-impedance and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The two procedures compared well, and enabled the discrimination between apparent and true (real) electroactivity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

It is urgent and necessary to develop non-noble bifunctional catalysts for both the ORR and the OER with high catalytic activity. Herein, an in situ synthetic route to obtain Mo2C-C hybrid microspheres as bifunctional catalysts has been reported. In this route, the synchronously prepared C microspheres act not only as the template, but also as the reactant. Interestingly, SEM, TEM and XPS results show that core-shell, yolk-shell and pierced structured microspheres could be formed by increasing the content of Mo2C in the Mo2C-C hybrids. Additionally, the formation of a non-crystalline amorphous MoOx (MoO2 and MoO3) nano-film appears to improve the conductivity of the as-prepared Mo2C-C hybrids. Rotating-ring-disk electrode (RRDE) results show that the Mo2C-C hybrids exhibit enhanced catalytic activity for the ORR and OER compared with that of the C microspheres and Mo2C. In particular, Mo2CC-5 displays excellent bifunctional activity and stability, which is close to the behavior of a commercial Pt/ C electrocatalyst for the ORR and a RuO2 electrocatalyst for the OER.									66	1	0	0	3	0	67			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000382110900027

The introduction of naturally porous GDY nanolayers on FeCH surface endows the pristine catalyst with structural advantages for boosting catalytic performances. Benefited from the protection of robust GDY nanolayers with intimate contact between GDY and FeCH, the combined material exhibits high long-term durability of 10 000 cycles for oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) and 9000 cycles for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1.0 M KOH. Such excellent bifunctional OER/HER performance makes FeCH@GDY/NF quite qualified for alkaline two-electrode electrolyzer. Remarkably, such electrocatalyst can drive 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at 1.49 and 1.53 V, respectively. These results demonstrate the decisive role of GDY in the improvement of electrocatalytic performances, and open up new opportunities for designing cost-effective, efficient, and stable electrocatalysts for sustainable oxygen/hydrogen generation.									51	7	0	0	3	0	52			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000457067300008	29558102

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that occurs at the anode side requires a four-electron transfer under highly oxidizing conditions. OER has a large overpotential and therefore determines the overall efficiency. Certain electrocatalysts can efficiently help to improve the reaction kinetics. Owing to the high cost of precious metals such as Pt, Ru, and Ir, non-precious metal oxide catalysts have been vigorously investigated under alkaline conditions. Herein, we synthesized novel highly dispersed amorphous CoOx for the first time in the form of a cluster favorable to enhance the OER activity using a facile method via the air dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. Compared with the pristine biopolymer-cobalt complex, the amorphous CoOx cluster exhibits a much higher current density and a lower overpotential for OER, e.g., the overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and the overpotential of only 350 mV at 300 mA cm(-1). The excellent electrocatalytic OER activity was attributed to the unsaturated catalytic sites on the amorphous CoOx cluster. In addition, we studied the reaction mechanism, and it was observed that pure O-2 DBD plasma could lead to the evolution of crystalline CoOx; however, the presence of N-2 and O-2 in DBD plasma could ensure the facile evolution of amorphous CoOx clusters. This study provides a new strategy to design amorphous materials for electrocatalysis and beyond.									109	7	0	0	3	0	112			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000408435400018	28792057

In this paper, cobalt-sulfide-selenium (Se:CoS2-x) core-shell nanostructures are prepared by a simple two-step method, including hydrothermal reaction and chemical vapor deposition. The resulting product exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, owing to the synergistic effects between CoS2 and CoSe1-x, as well as the plentiful active sites in the electrode structure. The Se:CoS2-x material shows a more improved hydrogen evolution reaction activity compared to CoS2 and Co(OH)Cl precursor catalysts, with a low overpotential of only 240 mV achieved at 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, Se:CoS2-x as a bifunctional water splitting catalyst also shows remarkably improved oxygen evolution reaction activity, with a low overpotential of only 1.32 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The above results show that selenide/sulfide materials provide a new research direction for discovering high-performance and cheap electrode materials.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000635705100001	33885490

The samples were directly utilized as the working electrodes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The optimal sample N-NiFe-S/C-8/2@CC possessed superior OER electrocatalytic activity with a remarkably low overpotential of 232mV at a current density of 10mAcm(-2) in 1M KOH aqueous solution. At the same time, a small Tafel slope of 58mVdec(-1) was achieved and excellent durability was also demonstrated. Such superior OER activity and durability of N-NiFe-S/C@CC may originate from a synergetic effect between Fe and Ni, the nitrogen-doped carbon matrix derived from MOFs, and the direct growth of active materials on CC. This facile approach of preparing bimetal sulfide compounds derived from MOFs may be a viable method for designing and preparing high-performing electrocatalytic materials for wider applications.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			2196-0216			WOS:000476572700018

Their high catalytic activity, originating from the strong coupling effect of Co with N, lead to the formation of active sites with suitable binding energies for promoting the discharging and charging reactions. Herein, we propose the synthesis of an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst (ZIFCNDA) prepared by the introduction of Co ions during the polymerisation of dopamine, which lead to the direct doping of a carbon framework and the localized growth of Co-based MOFs polyhedrons, generating Co-based nanoparticles (Co NPs) upon pyrolysis. The C3N4-controlled polydopamine growth formed thin graphitized carbon nanosheets which can facilitate the transfer of electrons to the catalytically active sites. The ZIFCNDA catalyst was able to efficiently catalyse both the oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions). The ZAB containing the developed catalyst presented a stable discharge voltage of 1.1 V at a high current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with higher stability and longer cycle life compared to their counterparts constructed using Pt/C and Ir/C in air-cathode. This study illustrates a platform to enhance the catalytic activity of the ORR and OER catalyst via promoting the formation of well distributed cobalt active sites, achieved due to the insertion of cobalt ions during the polymerization process of dopamine, instead of on a previously prepared framework and their application for rechargeable metal-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000848235000007

In this study, we report the first synthesis of phase-pure RuB2 by using a salt melt of potassium chloride and lithium chloride as the solvent. When used as an electrocatalyst in 0.5 M sulfuric acid, the as-prepared RuB2 needs an overpotential of only 223 mV for the OER to produce an operationally relevant current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This is almost the smallest overpotential value for Ir/Ru-based acidic OER catalysts reported to date. More importantly, in the acidic full water splitting, RuB, exhibits outstanding activity and stability, which merely needs a cell voltage of 1.525 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) , lower than those of the most bifunctional electrocatalysts reported in acid electrolytes. Theoretical calculation results further identify the formation of *OOH as the rate-determining step and the lower energy barrier for the RuB2 catalyst, improving the OER activity. This work represents a significant addition to exploring a new class of transition metal borides with outstanding activity in acidic water electrolysis and beyond.									59	4	0	0	3	0	59			2380-8195			WOS:000571642600017

This work provides a strategy to fabricate an advanced NiFe-based catalyst to steadily speed up the OER based on a strong amorphous-amorphous coupling effect generated through amorphous CuS that induces the formation of amorphous NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets (A-NiFe NS/CuS). The presence of the strong coupling effect not only modifies the electronic structure of catalytic sites to accelerate the reaction kinetics but also enhances the binding between the catalyst and substrate to strengthen the durability. In comparison to well-grown core-shell crystalline NiFe LDH on CuO, the as-synthesized amorphous A-NiFe NS/CuS gives a low overpotential of 240 mV to achieve 100 mA cm(-2) and shows robust stability under 100 h of operation at the same current density. Therefore, amorphous-amorphous coupling between catalyst-substrate by elaborate and rational engineering yields an opportunity to design efficient and robust NiFe-based OER catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000800295400032	35343674

In this work, we are reporting such a discovery of utilizing the stainless steel (SS) scrubber directly as a catalytic electrode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of water electrolysis in 1 M KOH. The iR corrected overpotential calculated at an areal current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for a SS scrubber in HER is 315 mV which is 273 mV higher than Pt/C. Similarly, the SS scrubber required 418 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) which is just 37 and 98 mV higher than Ni(OH)(2) and RuO2. Interestingly, the kinetic analysis revealed that the SS scrubber had facile kinetics for both HER and OER in 1 M KOH as reflected by their corresponding Tafel slope values viz., 121 and 63 mV dec(-1), respectively. In addition, the two electrode cell fabricated using the same SS scrubber electrode delivered 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.98 V. Beyond everything, the SS scrubber had shown ultrahigh stability in both half-cell and full-cell studies for total water splitting. Further, as far as the cost of an electrode material per gram is concerned, the SS scrubber defeats all the best electrocatalysts of water splitting by having a price of just $0.012 USD which is $2.228 USD lower than pure Ni, $59.658 USD lower than RuO2 and $158.028 USD lower than Pt/C 20 wt % catalyst. The overall study specified that the SS scrubber can be adapted for cost-efficient large scale water electrolysis for bulk hydrogen production.									47	2	0	0	3	0	49			2168-0485			WOS:000424728300105

High-conductivity electrolytes such as seawater represent a commonly encountered and relatively benign environment An electrolyte is unlikely to chemically attack polymer-matrix composites such as graphite/epoxy, and long-term exposure typically would result in only minor moisture-induced damage. However, the relatively high conductivity of graphite fibers coupled with a high-conductivity electrolyte may promote damaging electrochemical reactions to occur Anodic polarization of graphite/epoxy (which could result from stray electrical currents) causes rapid and substantial corrosion damage at applied current densities as low as 1 muA/cm2. Unlike metals, where corrosion damage results from direct electrochemical dissolution damage of graphite-fiber polymer matrix composites is the result of secondary chemical reactions involving electrochemically evolved species. Experimental evidence suggests that this damage is associated with oxygen evolution at the anode. The mechanism is thought to be attack by adsorbed atomic oxygen, which occurs as an intermediate in the O2 evolution reaction.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0010-9312			WOS:A1992KF41400007

In this study, we report the activation of CoTe2 for OER by doping secondary anions into Te vacancies to trigger a structural transition from the hexagonal to the orthorhombic phase. The achieved orthorhombic CoTe2 with partial vacancies occupied by P-doping exhibits an exceptional OER catalytic activity with an overpotential of only 241 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a robust stability more than 24 h. The combined experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the defective phase transformation is controllable and allows the synergism of vacancy, doping as well as the reconstructed crystallographic structure, ensuring more exposure of catalytic active sites, rapid charge transfer, and energetically favorable intermediates. This vacancy occupation-driven strategy of structural transformation can also be manipulated by S- and Se-doping, which may offer useful guidance for developing tellurides-based electrocatalyst for OER.									48	2	0	0	2	0	48			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000543744100056	32479055

Herein, this study puts forward a new Co decorated N,B-codoped interconnected graphitic carbon and carbon nanotube materials (Co/NBC) synthesized by direct carbonization of a cobalt-based boron imidazolate framework. It is demonstrated that the carbonization temperature can tune the surface structure and component of the resultant materials and optimize the electrochemically active surface area to expose more accessible active sites, effectively boosting the electrocatalytic activity. As a result, the optimized Co/NBC shows superior bifunctional catalytic activity and stability toward OER and HER in 1.0 m KOH solution. Furthermore, the catalyst can serve as both the anode and cathode for water splitting to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.68 V. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that the excellent activity of Co/NBC catalyst benefits from the synergistic effect of partial oxidation of metallic cobalt, conductive N,B-codoped graphitic carbon and carbon nanotube, and the coupled interactions among these components. This work opens a promising avenue toward the exploration of boron imidazolate frameworks as efficient heteroatom-doped catalysts for electrocatalysis.									135	10	0	0	3	0	136			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000436104800018

Low-cost electrocatalysts with excellent performance are required to improve the energy efficiency in overall water splitting. Here, a Co-W-B-P/CF catalyst with a nanoflower-like structure consisting of microspheres and nanoflakes was successfully synthesized using a onestep double-pulse electrodeposition approach. When used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, Co-W-B-P/CF presented the potentials of 1.57 and 1.86 Vat current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH solution, respectively. This was even comparable to that of the high-cost commercial catalyst Pt/C(-)//IrO2(+). Detailed electrochemical tests also showed that the kinetics, electron transfer, and intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of Co-W-B-P/CF in the HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) and the OER (oxygen evolution reaction) were dramatically improved due to the synergetic effect of co-doped B and P elements. Considering the excellent electrocatalytic performance of CoW-B-P/CF, along with the simple synthesis method and low cost, bifunctional electrocatalyst Co-W-B-P/CF for overall water splitting is promising.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000813061800001

Journal of colloid and interface science				629	Pt B			1003	1014		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.09.138				2022-Sep-29	2022	Developing low-cost electrocatalysts with excellent activity is significant for accelerating the slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, an effective electrocatalyst is prepared via the cross-linked effect and reconstruction strategy based on inexpensive transition metals (Fe, Co, and Ni) and phytic acid (PA). The feasibility of utilizing the cross-linked effect and reconstruction strategy is due to that PA molecules with strongly electronegative phosphoric acid groups possess a great deal of complexing sites, which can facilitate the formation of large cross-linked network by randomly complexing Fe, Co and Ni ions. And the carboatomic rings in PA molecules will reconstructed as carbon-matrix when PA molecules decompose. The above structural evolution of large cross-linked network and reconstructing process is rigorously analyzed through the characterization methods such as XPS. These analysis results indicate that FeCoNi-PA-300 possesses a high degree of amorphization, an abundant nanoporous structure, and a small nanoparticle size, resulting in a large electrochemically active area. Consequently, FeCoNi-PA-300 just needs low overpotentials of about 271mV and 286mV to obtain the current densities of 50 and 100mAcm-2, respectively. Meaningfully, this synthetic method is a general strategy to meliorate the OER activity and electrical conductivity of other catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1095-7103		MEDLINE:36208601	36208601

Along with using earth-abundant, atomically engineered catalysts that are highly active and stable, clean, chemical-waste-free catalyst production-using minimum resources-is a major hurdle toward achieving zero-carbon-emission commercial operations. Herein, we propose a clean way to fabricate NiSe2-CoSe(2)on nickel-cobalt foam (NCF) using pure water for thein situsprouting of NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors. The excellent electrocatalytic activity for overall water splitting in alkaline electrolytes is highlighted by the overpotentials of NiSe2-CoSe2/NCF for delivering current densities of 10 and 400 mA cm(-2)(j(10)andj(400), respectively) at only 24 and 257 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 250 and 346 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as well as the fast reaction kinetics affording small Tafel slope values of 24 (HER) and 48 (OER) mV dec(-1), respectively. NiSe2-CoSe2/NCF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance and structural stability, evidenced by the unchanged polarization curve after 10(4)cycles of CV tests and low decay of high current density (j(100)) after 100 h of HER and OER measurements. Theoretical analysis revealed that the Co atoms dispersed on the heterointerfaces between the NiSe(2)and CoSe(2)phases act as the electrocatalytic sites.									23	2	0	0	2	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000542473000011

However, it remains a challenge for simple cobalt oxides such as CoO, Co3O4 and CoOOH to provide high catalytic activity both with ideal conductivity and stability. Herein, we prepared a new type of sulfur-incorporated cobalt oxide nanocages as high efficiency OER catalyst using Co-MOF as precursor. With the help of sodium sulfide, one step water-warm immersionalcohol refluxing method can achieve the cavitation of precursors and uniform incorporation of sulfur atoms meanwhile. The hollow cubic structure constructed by fluffy nanosheets is beneficial to the exposure of active sites, the regulation of electronic structure and improve the electron transfer speed. After electrochemical testing, the prepared CoS@CoO showed outstanding OER activity compared with other cobalt-based catalysts. More importantly, this material has also withstood the electrochemical test of long range due to the stable structural foundation provided by Co-MOF. This work comes up with a new idea for OER activity promotion of hollow doped cobalt-based catalysts through morphology control and electronic structure optimization.

Here we report a simple method to improve the OER catalytic activity via loading Co3O4 nanoparticles onto boron carbon oxynitride (BCNO) nanosheets, which greatly decreases the overpotential (similar to 80 mV) and improves the stability of the Co3O4 nanoparticles. The Co3O4/BCNO nanocomposite exhibits a good OER performance with a small Tafel slope of 57.58 mV/dec and a low overpotential of 317 mV (vs RHE at 10 mA/cm(2)) under alkaline conditions. The high OER performance of the Co3O4/BCNO nanocomposite is induced by the larger active surface area and higher ratio of Co3+ to Co2+ ions as well as the formation of Co-N chemical bonds.

Among many different nonprecious metal based candidates, transition metal nanoparticles encapsulated in graphene layers have gained increasing attention over recent years. In this study, it is demonstrated that metallic cobalt nanoparticles sheathed by multilayered nitrogen-enriched graphene shells can be facilely prepared using cobalt-containing Prussian blue colloids as the single precursor. These metallic cobalt cores can be readily leached out by HCl treatment, resulting in hollow graphene spheres. Products with or without acid leaching exhibit great bifunctional activities for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes. Most importantly, it is found that the removal of the metallic cores does not deteriorate but rather enhances the electrocatalytic performance. Based on this and other experimental observations, Co-N-C moieties are proposed as the catalytically active sites. At last, it is shown that these catalysts can be employed as the air catalyst of primary zinc-air batteries with excellent current density, power density, and operation durability.									296	18	2	0	6	0	301			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000379734000016

The best performing oxygen catalysts often contain precious metals at a high manufacturing cost. In this paper, two low-cost catalysts for the oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution reactions (OER), based on LSFCO perovskite and Ni-Fe hexacyanoferrate, were compared with a precious metal palladium catalyst on carbon (Pd/C). LSFCO/C showed the best all-round performance as a single bifunctional catalyst but Pd/C had the strongest ORR activity. Ni-Fe hexacyanoferrate is straightforward to manufacture in industrial quantities, and is more active for the OER than palladium and LSFCO perovskite at small loadings < 5 mg cm(-2). By mixing a small loading of Pd/C with Ni-Fe hexacyanoferrate, lower overpotentials for both the ORR and OER can be reached, with the difference in potential between the two reactions being only 0.62 V at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2). The effect of catalyst loading of each catalyst on the gas-diffusion electrode was studied, and rotating disk voltammetry was used to study the catalytic behavior of the Ni-Fe hexacyanoferrate catalyst.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a new route to design highly active catalysts owing to their adjustable composition, morphology and surface area. Herein, a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst was fabricated by forming an interconnected and conducting Co-N/C framework on bamboo-like hollow MnO nanowires. The hybrid demonstrates prominent ORR/OER activity and promising potential in rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Especially, when assembled into solid-state Zn-air batteries, high open-circuit potential and stable discharge-charge cycling platforms were achieved. The outstanding performances stem from the synergistic effect of the two composites in one-dimensional nanowires, facilitating the convenient and sustainable diffusion of electrolytes to active sites. This work provides a new guideline to optimize MOF-derived materials as substitutes for Pt/C and RuO2 noble-metal catalysts for air cathodes in both liquid- and solid-state Zn-air batteries.									127	10	0	0	8	0	127			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000433427300043

The structural evolution of the films during thermal annealing were studied by using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), Raman spectra and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), while the change of bonding structure and interface products were obtained by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The existence of oxygen vacancies in the surface layer of the as-deposited HfO2 film was confirmed by Auger line shapes, which could facilitate the adsorption of ambient oxygen on the free surface and induce the diffusion of oxygen atoms to the surface layer during thermal annealing. Meanwhile, the newly formed defects in the films could provide more passageways for the diffusion of oxygen atoms to the film-substrate interface layer. The oxygen that diffused to the interface layer was the key factor of the change in the interface structure, which participated in the interface reaction. In addition, the formation amount and bonding structure of the interface products such as suboxide of silicon and hafnium silicate were influenced by the oxygen concentration of the external environment.

Highly efficient non-noble metal based electrocatalysts are urgently required to be developed and to replace the commercial Ru/Ir based oxide. Herein, we report the three-dimensional hierarchical NiCo2O4/CNT-150 composite with high activity for the OER that was synthesized via a hydrothermal reaction and subsequent annealing. Compared with CNTs, commercial RuO2 catalysts, NiCo2O4/CNT, NiCo2O4/CNT-250, and NiCo2O4/CNT-150 exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic performance with a lower onset overpotential of 300 mV and the corresponding Tafel slope of 129 mV per decade. The flower-like NiCo2O4/CNT-150 shows an excellent catalysis performance with higher current density than the commercial RuO2 catalyst. Moreover, the NiCo2O4/CNT-150 demonstrates the excellent long-term durability in 0.1 mol L-1 KOH for the OER. The significant catalytic performances are ascribed to the excellent conductivity of CNTs and the high specific surface area of the three dimensional flower-like NiCo2O4.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2046-2069			WOS:000442078800061	35548168

The oxides were obtained by a sol-gel route, using malic acid as precursor. The catalytic activity of LaMnO3 electrode, prepared by this new method, was found to be approximately 15 limes higher than the one obtained by ceramic method. The introduction of 0.2-0.4 mole Sr in the perovskite lattice further improved the activity of the catalyst. However, other Sr-substitutions (0.1 and 0.6 mole) appeared to be less beneficial. 0.2 mole Pb-substitution showed to be highly detrimental From the electrocatalysis point of view.

In this regard, heterostructures and defects engineering have been proven to be effective strategies for addressing the two issues. However, the integrated construction of heterostructures and defects has been reported rarely. Herein, a facile in-situ photodeposition strategy has been developed to grow CdS nanocrystals on MnO2-x nanorods with rich oxygen vacancies (VO) as a direct Z-scheme photocatalyst for boosting water oxidation. It has been found that the Cd2+ ions accept photoelectrons from MnO2-x under irradiation for the in-situ growth of CdS nanocrystals, which enables a close contact between the two components, providing high-speed electron-transport channels for photocatalysis. Meanwhile, the photooxidation half reactions extract surface lattice oxygen, leading to the increase of VO content in MnO2-x, which supplies abundant active sites for oxygen evolution. Owing to the synergistic effects of VO and Z-scheme systems, the optimized MnO2-x/ CdS photocatalyst displays a dramatically enhanced photocatalytic activity with an O2 production rate of 779 lmol g-1h-1 under visible-light irradiation without any cocatalysts, which is 2.33 times higher than the bare MnO2-x.

Platinum or platinum bimetallic alloys are common choices as the electrode material, but prohibitive costs hamper their use. Complex alloy materials, such as high-entropy alloys (HEAs), or more generally, multiple principal component alloys (MPCAs), have emerged as a material capable of overcoming the limitations of platinum and platinum-based materials. Theoretically, due to the large variety of active sites, this new kind of material offers the opportunity to identify experimentally the optimal binding site on the catalyst surface. This review discusses recent advances in the application of such alloys for the oxygen reduction reaction and existing experimental challenges in the benchmarking of the electrocatalytic properties of these materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2305-7084		WOS:000763911500001

Here, a new type of electrocatalyst with core-shell carbon/NiCo2O4 double microtubes architecture is successfully synthesized through a hydrothermal method combined with the calcination process with wet tissues as the template and carbon resource. The outer NiCo2O4 nanosheet arrays contain abundant defects, which come from reduction of the carbon in wet tissues. This indicates that carbon is a very excellent defect inducer. The inner carbon microtubes can act as the robust structure skeleton and these core-shell double microtubes provide abundant diffusion channels for oxygen and electrolyte, both of which contribute to improving the stability by avoiding damage to the electrode from produced O-2 bubbles and the collapse of the outer NiCo2O4 microtubes. Electrochemical results show that the electrode, core-shell carbon/NiCo2O4 double microtubes loaded on carbon cloth, exhibits prominent electrocatalytic activity with an overpotential of only 168 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope as low as 57.6 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH. This new type of electrocatalyst possesses great potential in water electrolyzers and rechargeable metal-air batteries.									26	3	0	0	1	0	28			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000482640200001	31448556

We used grand canonical quantum mechanics to predict the OER mechanisms including kinetics and thus overpotentials as a function of Fe content in (Ni, Fe) OOH catalysts. We find that density functional theory (DFT) without exact exchange predicts that addition of Fe does not reduce the overpotential much. However, DFT with exact exchange predicts dramatic improvement in performance for (Ni, Fe) OOH, leading to an overpotential of 0.42 V and a Tafel slope of 23 mV/decade (dec), in good agreement with experiments, 0.3-0.4 V and 30 mV/dec. We reveal that the high spin d(4) Fe(IV) leads to efficient formation of an active O radical intermediate, while the closed shell d(6) Ni(IV) catalyzes the subsequent O-O coupling, and thus it is the synergy between Fe and Ni that delivers the optimal performance for OER.									254	6	0	0	15	0	255			0027-8424	1091-6490		WOS:000434114900035	29784794

Here, we develop highly efficient OER and HER electrocatalysts through the scalable fabrication of NiFeZn hydroxide nanosheets firmly arrayed on a hierarchical porous intermetallic NiZn and Ni heterojunction over nickel foam (NiFeZn-OH/NiZn-Ni/NF). One bimodal porous NiZn intermetallic/Ni layer is in situ constructed on the nickel foam surface to maximize the exposure of catalytic sites and build firm NiFeZn-OH nanosheets via the redox reaction with FeCl3. NiFeZn-OH/NiZn-Ni/NF shows low overpotentials of eta(50/600) around 235/284 mV for OER and eta(50/600) around 73/212 mV for HER, small Tafel slopes of 46.1 and 41.1 mV dec(-1), and prolonged catalytic durability in an alkaline medium because of the strong synergistic effects of Zn doping, multiple interface engineering, and integral three-dimensional free-standing scaffold. As bifunctional catalysts, NiFeZn-OH/NiZn-Ni/NF required a low electrolytic voltage of 1.49 V at 20 mA cm(-2) (1.61 V at 100 mA cm(-2)) with a sustained and stable output for 40 h during water splitting. This work might provide insights into the exploration of low-cost and highly efficient intermetallic/multimetallic hydroxide heterostructured electrocatalysts for practical overall water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000739230100001

Moving fronts of oxygen evolution during electropolishing in different electrochemical cells								Galvanotechnik				99	2			290	300						Feb. 2008	2008	When electropolishing brass (CuZn37) in a Hull cell under galvanostatic conditions, a moving front of oxygen bubbles can be observed, depending on the current density used. Local changes in secondary current distribution are a function of the position on the Hull cell panel, as well as the primary current distribution at the beginning of the process. Changes in secondary current distribution and localised potential values are manifested by the moving front of oxygen bubbles. Recent studies have revealed a systematic oscillation in a pre-production cell design. Such oscillations are most likely linked to the complex, non-linear reaction of oxygen evolution.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0016-4232			INSPEC:9890043

However, the development of highly active and low cost electrocatalysts is a considerable challenge. Herein, Co-Cu alloy nanoparticles-incorporated carbon nanowires electrocatalyst was synthesized and evaluated for both OER and HER. The nanomaterials were fabricated by facile electrospinning of sol-gel composed of cobalt acetate, copper acetate, and poly(vinyl alcohol) followed by calcination in an inert environment. Adjusting the composition of the metallic counterpart was found to significantly enhance electrochemical properties of the catalyst. Furthermore, the unique nanowire morphology and structural properties of incorporated Co-Cu alloy, the (Co0.95Cu0.05@CHWs) composition exhibits good electrocatalytic performance for both OER and HER in the alkaline medium. Physicochemical characterizations using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscope, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy have confirmed the formation of alloy structure and nanowire morphology. The optimum composition (Co0.05Cu0.05@CNWs) requires small overpotential, eta(10) of similar to 285 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and similar to 160 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with the corresponding Tafel slope of 92 mV dec 1 and 172 mV dec(-1) versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively. In addition, only negligible loss in activity was observed after 1000 cycles and prodeces cell voltage of 1.58 Vat current of 10 mA/cm(2) and 1.72 Vat current density of 50 mA/cm(-1) in two electrode system. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were employed to verify experimental results. Electronic density of states (DOS) results reveal an increase in electronic states near the Fermi level upon Co-Cu heterojunctioning with CNW5. This is indicative of improved catalytic activity and more favorable binding energies of HER and OER intermediates. Reaction coordinate diagrams for HER and OER were developed, which aided in identifying thermodynamically limiting steps. This work may provide a feasible approach for incorporating other transition metals to design low-cost and high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.

Here we investigate a tandem particle-suspension reactor design for solar water splitting comprising micron-scale photocatalyst particles suspended in an aqueous solution with soluble redox shuttles. A porous separator facilitates redox species transport between the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction compartments while averting gas crossover. A two-dimensional, transient model of the reactor is presented to illustrate the coupling between light absorption, interfacial electron-transfer kinetics and species transport, and their combined impacts on overall solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency. The volumetric reactivity of the suspended semiconductor particles is dictated by combining the (photo) current-voltage behavior of a photodiode with Butler-Volmer electron-transfer kinetics. For the first time, a quantitative approach to determine the impacts of surface-dependent redox shuttle kinetic parameters on reaction selectivity in a Z-scheme system is established. Model results provide insights on the effects of optical, transport and kinetic properties of the semiconductor particles and the redox shuttles on the overall reactor performance. Solar-to-hydrogen reactor efficiencies predicted with BiVO4 particles for oxygen evolution are at least two times larger than efficiencies achieved with wider band-gap TiO2 particles due to enhanced visible light absorption; hydrogen evolution with SrTiO3:Rh particles was considered for both cases. Superior performance is predicted with proton-coupled electron transfer redox shuttles (para-benzoquinone/hydroquinone and iodide/iodate) that absorb little-to-no visible light, while also facilitating operation at near-neutral pH conditions, as compared to the non-proton-coupled triiodide/iodide and iron(III)/iron(II) redox shuttles. For 1 cm tall reaction compartments, diffusive species transport is fast enough to sustain reactor operation at a 1% solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency for both para-benzoquinone/hydroquinone and iodate/iodide redox shuttles with less than 2.2 mg L-1 of each of BiVO4 and SrTiO3:Rh particles in the solution.									54	1	0	0	10	0	54			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000423017000011

Nonprecious metal catalysts comprised of inexpensive and earth-abundant transition metals are regarded as a promising substitute for noble metal catalysts used in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but are still practically unfeasible mainly due to unsatisfactory activity and durability. Here we report a facile two-step preparation method for WOx nanowires with high concentration of oxygen vacancies (OVs) via calcination of W-polydopamine compound precursors. The resulting hybrid material possesses a uniform and ultralong 1D nanowires structure and a rough and raised surface, which can effectively improve the specific surface area. The products exhibit excellent performance for H-2 generation: the required overpotentials for 1 and 10 mA cm(-2) are 18 and 108 mV, the Tafel slope is 46 mV/decade, and the electrochemically active surface area is estimated to be similar to 77.0 m(2) g(-1). After 1000 cycles, the catalyst works well without significant current density drop. Our experimental results verified metallic transition metal oxides as superior non-Pt electrocatalysts for practical hydrogen evolution reactions.									15	2	0	0	1	0	16			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000412392600003	28805657

In this work, we report a NiV LDH ultrathin nanosheet doped with Fe3+ through a one-step co-precipitation method. Benefiting from the successful doping of Fe3+, which could effectively enhance the oxidation capacity of Ni3+ and facilitate the charge transport of NiV LDH, the ultrathin Ni3V1Fe1 LDH nanosheet shows an efficient catalytic performance for the water oxidation. A low overpotential of 269 mV was required achieving the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a long-term stability for 1000 cycles was also shown for the obtained electrode. This work provides a facile pathway for preparing Ni-based LDH materials and makes them promising catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction.									41	4	0	0	2	0	42			2052-1553			WOS:000475394700029

However, widespread application of this technique is hindered by the high overpotential required for the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this contribution, we report that novel N based conducting polymers exhibit excellent charge transfer properties with earth abundant transition metals. A strong interaction between Ni and N from polypyrrole (PPy) was identified via XPS, resulting in higher amounts of Ni delta++ sites at the interface. Electronegative N from PPy shell, covering Ni12P5 microspheres, interacts with Ni on the inner edge and electrodeposited Co on the outer edge, establishing a dual synergic effect. This hybrid catalyst, with Co-N and Ni-N active interfaces, demonstrates faster OER kinetics owing to improved electrophilicity towards hydroxyl ions. With dual M-N sites, Co@Ni12P5/PPy displays a low Tafel slope of 40 mV/dec and stability up to 7 h of electrochemical cycling. This work enables discovery of a new class of anode materials based on metal-PPy analogs for alkaline OER. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Crystalline transition metal oxides as the promising non-noble catalysts, however, are often suffering from the large excess overpotential and unsatisfactory performance. To boost their intrinsic catalytic property, we report here an incorporation of electronegative sulfur into crystalline cobalt oxide (S-CoOx) to create structural disorder via a facile room-temperature ion exchange strategy. Compared with its crystalline form, the disorder in S-CoOx catalyst enables the increased low oxygen coordination and rich defect sites, which endows S-CoOx a superior catalytic activity for both OER and HER in alkali. Intriguingly, a water electrolyser adopting S-CoOx as both OER and HER electrode catalysts requires mere 1.63 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. This work highlights the effectiveness of designing high-performing electrocatalysts for water electrolysers based on disordered structural materials.									73	10	0	0	2	0	74			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000530669500009

Anionic Ru-oxo complexes (AHA)(2)RuO- (2) and (NTA)Ru(O)Cl- (5 e) have prohibitively large free energies of coupling, while neutral and monocationic species (1 b, 3-5 a-d) show small to moderate free energies of coupling. Transition states for O-O coupling were found for (NTA)RuO (5 a), (NTA)RuO(NH3) (5 c), (NTA)RuO(Pyr) (5 d), (DMG)(2)ClRu(O) (8) and (POR)RuO(Cl) (9), yielding moderate activation energies in the range of 18-22 kcal/mol. The overall oxygen evolution reaction (OER) free energies decrease in favourability as the coordination number of LRuO decreases, i. e. 7>6>5. The modest activation energies and free energies along the reaction coordinate for (NTA)(L)RuO and (POR)ClRu(O) suggest that these species would undergo kinetically and thermodynamically favorable oxygen evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000692799900001

This, combined with their porous structure, makes them excellent catalyst supports. Here, the high electrocatalytic activity of a composite, formed by supporting Ni3N nanoparticles on a benzimidazole COF, for oxygen evolution reaction is shown. The composite oxidizes alkaline water with a near-record low overpotential of 230 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)). This high activity is attributed to the ability of the COF to confine the Ni3N nanoparticles to size regimes otherwise difficult to obtain and to its low band gap character (1.49 eV) arising from the synergy between the conducting Ni3N nanoparticles and the pi-conjugated COF. The COF itself, as a metalfree self-standing framework, has an oxygen evolution reaction activity with 10 of 400 mV. The periodic structure of the COF makes it serve as a matrix to disperse the catalytically active Ni3N nanoparticles favoring their high accessibility and thereby good charge-transport within the composite. This is evident from the amount of O-2 evolved (230 mmol h(-1) g(-1)), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest reported.

Herein, we report a simple method to synthesize novel two-dimensional Ni76Co24 layered double hydroxides (Ni76Co24-LDHs) nanosheets as an effective OER catalyst. The obtained Ni76Co24-LDHs display a low onset overpotential of 242 mV, along with an excellent cycling stability. The Tafel slope of Ni76Co24-LDHs is only 57 mV dec(-1) which demonstrates an active kinetics for OER. The high catalytic activity of Ni76Co24-LDHs may be attributed to the porous tremella-like structure with large surface area, synergistic effect of Ni and Co, and a pinning of the Co3+/4+ and Ni3+/4+. More importantly, the high catalytic property and simple synthetic method of Ni76Co24-LDHs may have a promising potential for practical application.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000381181300010

Conventional overall water electrolysis (OWE) has been regarded as a promising approach for effective H-2 production, however, it is largely restricted by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Coupling kinetically favorable anodic reactions, such as biomass-derived compound oxidation and pollutant degradation, with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in hybrid water electrolysis (HWE), can not only solve the biomass recycling and pollutant emission problems but also save the energy cost for clean H-2 generation. Hence, various advanced earth-abundant electrocatalysts have been developed to catalyze those promising anodic reactions, yet some problems such as tedious preparation and unsatisfactory performance still exist. Given the gap between research and practical applications, this review summarizes the recent progress in electrocatalysts for diverse alternative anodic oxidation reactions over the last five years together with their application in HWE systems. An in-depth understanding of different reaction mechanisms and assessments toward electrocatalysts is discussed to further enhance anodic efficiency. The advantages, differences, and critical issues of different HWE systems are thoroughly discussed as well, providing a new avenue for low-voltage H-2 production from renewable resources and waste products.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000797783200001

With ever-increasing importance of hydrogen-based energy cycle, metal carbides have received increasing attention as alternative electrocatalysts for Pt-group metal catalysts in renewable energy conversion reactions. This Mini-review provides recent advances in transition metal carbide (TMC)-catalyzed energy conversion reactions. We summarize major attributes of TMCs as electrocatalysts and highlight structural design and reactivity of TMCs for hydrogen-, oxygen-, and carbon-involving energy conversion reactions with notable examples.

Herein, a novel LDH@N-CoOx@C bifunctional electrocatalyst was synthesized by a straightforward solution reaction, annealing process, and hydrothermal reaction. The material consisted of two-dimensional (2D) NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets self-grown on N-doped CoOx carbon polyhedra derived from bimetal-organic frameworks. The outer LDH nanosheets effectively maintained the catalytic activity and long-term stability of the inner N-CoOx@C. The heterostructure formed by the LDH self-growth on N-CoOx@C and the strong electronic interaction between N-CoOx@C and LDH greatly promoted the OER and ORR activities. The LDH@N-CoOx@C exhibited a low overpotential of 273 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and a half-wave potential (E-1/2) close to the commercial Pt/C catalyst for ORR, demonstrating its excellent bifunctional catalytic performance. In addition, the LDH@N-CoOx@C catalyst showed a higher energy density and extraordinary stability in liquid Zn-air batteries (ZABs) compared with the commercial Pt/C + RuO2 catalyst, having good prospect in flexible all-solid-state ZABs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000794034600003

Chemical composition engineering is one of the most valid approaches to regulate the active sites for improved activity. Here we developed new robust OER electrocatalysts of FeCo phosphate (FCP) composites by a simple and low-cost co-precipitation method. The electrocatalytic activity depends intensely on the composition tuning by the dosage of Fe and Co precursor and the optimized catalyst requires overpotentials of only 273 and 298 mV to drive current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, respectively. It shows a low Tafel slope of 35.9 mV dec(-1). Meanwhile, the faradaic yield was determined to be similar to 96% together with excellent stability for long-term OER. Both the collective effects of phosphate anion features and the regulation of cations were discussed for the enhancement in OER electrocatalysis. The strategy proposed here provides a new insight for in-depth understanding and designing of high-performance OER electrocatalysts. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, a novel Co-based coordination molecular cluster has been first introduced as precursor to obtain metallic cobalt core shelled by N-doped carbon (Co@NC) structure which operates as an oxygen evolution electrode. Specifically, a new cocrystal compound, [Co-7(II)(mu(3)-CN)(6)(mmimp)(6)] [(CoClN)-Cl-II-N-3(CN)(2)]center dot 3CH(3)OH (Co7+1, mmimp = 2-methoxy-6-((methylimino)-methyl)phenol), was isolated consisting of Brucite disks of cobalt where the usual bridging mu(3)-OH is replaced by mu(3)-CN produced by the in-situ decomposition of dicyanamide (N C-N-C N). The cobalt atoms are bonded through the nitrogen atom of the cyanide. Remarkably, time dependent thermogravimetric-mass spectrometry (TG-MS) analysis was utilized to track its pyrolysis process. It allowed us to propose a possible formation process of the Co@NC structure from Co7+1. Interestingly, an extremely superior OER electrode is optimized for Co@NC-600 having the lowest overpotential of 257 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) in 1 mol/L KOH solution. The present study pins down the importance of clusters of transition metals on realizing distinct nanostructures operating as highly efficient OER electrocatalyst. (C) 2019 Science China Press.

Systematic structural and morphological analysis of solvothermally fabricated Iron (Fe) and Nickel (Ni) based MOF and their CNTs composites was carried out by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) techniques. Synergetic effect of bimetallic metal organic framework (MOF) and conductive CNTs support improves the catalytic response of MOF. FeNiNH2BDC-5 wt % CNTs composite demonstrated current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an over potential (eta) 0.22 V and onset potential of 1.36 V vs RHE, comparable with RuO2 state-of-the-art catalytic material for oxygen evolution reaction in a fuel cell. Furthermore, FeNiNH2BDC-5 wt % CNTs composite tafel slope of 68.50mV/dec and 0.675(-1) turnover frequency (TOF) ascertain it as a promising alternative candidate towards costly Pt, Pd, Ir and Ru based catalysts.

Here, an efficient and novel trifunctional electrocatalyst (Fe2P/Co@NPC) with Fe2P and Co nanoparticles embedded in porous carbon has been developed by facile one-pot pyrolysis. The synergistic effect of Fe2P and Co nanoparticles furnishes Fe2P/Co@NPC with excellent catalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, E-1/2 = 0.876 V), oxygen evolution reaction (OER, eta(10) = 331 mV), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, eta(10) = 235 mV). Significantly, using Fe2P/Co@NPC catalyst as the cathode, the assembled anion exchange membrane fuel cell delivers a peak power density of 1.25 W cm(-2). Moreover, the assembled rechargeable Zn-air battery, using Fe2P/Co@NPC as a bifunctional oxygen catalyst, exhibits a maximum power density of 233.56 mW cm(-2) and impressive cycle performance. Using Fe2P/Co@NPC as a bifunctional HER and OER catalyst, the overall water electrolyzer also achieves a low voltage of 1.73 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2). This work represents a protocol for the preparation of high efficient trifunctional electrocatalysts using cheaper heteroatom-containing metal-organic small molecules as a precursor for electrochemical energy devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000825696700001

However, their practical use is limited by the use of costly noble-metal electrocatalysts for the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurred at the air electrode of the Zn-air batteries.

The NiS (x) /CNT electrocatalyst on a carbon cloth electrode exhibits a low OER overpotential of 288 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in current density, and the electrocatalyst on a rotating disk electrode exhibits a half-wave ORR potential of 0.81 V in alkaline electrolyte. With the use of the NiS (x) /CNT electrocatalyst for the air electrode, the fabricated aqueous rechargeable Zn-air batteries show a fairly good maximum output power density of 110 mW cm(-2), which highlights the great promise of the ALD NiS (x) /CNT electrocatalyst for Zn-air batteries.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000641233200001	33770782

Herein, a solvent vapour thermal reaction (SVTR), in which the phosphating process is conducted in an atmosphere of solvent vapours, is well designed for the first time to acquire NiCoP with diversified morphology. During this process, evaporative solvents not only react with aluminium phosphide (ALP) to generate phosphine as phosphorus source, but also disperse around the materials to influence phosphating reaction. The hydrogen evolution reaction activity of NiCoP is significantly enhanced by modulating the extent of phosphorization according to different reaction degree between ALP and solvents. Note that EG-NiCoP (ethylene glycol as solvent) manifests the most prominent HER performance in alkaline condition and (111) plane is the most stable and the highest catalytic active crystal face of NiCoP. The novel phosphating approach inspires a new thinking to devise more metal phosphides applied in energy-related applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it remains challenging in synthesis especially for such dual control and at large scale. In this study, we present a stepwise chemical oxidation route, involving phase transition and reconstruction processes, to access ultrathin CoOOH nanosheets with a thickness of ca. 4 nm and abundant oxygen vacancies. Other transition metals were also doped into CoOOH nanosheets through this strategy. Among them, the optimized FeCoOOH nanosheets demonstrated an efficient OER activity with overpotential as low as 252 mV (current density: 10 mA cm(-2)) and excellent stability. A high and stable solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 10.5% was acquired when FeCoOOH nanosheets were used as the anode in a constructed water splitting device driven by solar energy. This study offers a noble and facile strategy for potentially scalable preparation of atom-modulated ultrathin metal (oxy)-hydroxide nanosheets, and also demonstrates the OER applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000696186400001	34528043

In this Minireview, recent examples of single-atom electrocatalysts used for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR), and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) are introduced. Many density functional theory (DFT) simulations have predicted that SACs may be effective for CO2 reduction to methane or methanol production while suppressing H-2 evolution, and those cases are introduced here as well. Single atoms, mainly Pt single atoms, have been deposited on TiN or TiC nanoparticles, defective graphene nanosheets, N-doped covalent triazine frameworks, graphitic carbon nitride, S-doped zeolite-templated carbon, and Sb-doped SnO2 surfaces. Scanning transmission electron microscopy, extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurement, and in situ infrared spectroscopy have been used to detect the single-atom structure and confirm the absence of nanoparticles. SACs have shown high mass activity, minimizing the use of precious metal, and unique selectivity distinct from nanoparticle catalysts owing to the absence of ensemble sites. Additional features that SACs should possess for effective electrochemical applications were also suggested.									158	15	0	0	3	0	162			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000419685900008	28895315

However, sluggish dynamic processes, including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), need to be overcome to allow their practical application. Here, Fe-doped NiO nanosheets were prepared using a hydrothermal method on carbon cloth (CC) and acted as the electrode material in Li-O-2 batteries. The Fe-doped NiO/CC electrodes can exhibit stable performance for 102 cycles under a restricted capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 340 mA g(-1) and show discharge capacities of about 6010 and 5000 mA h g(-1) at current densities of 100 and 200 mA g(-1), respectively. Li-O-2 batteries based on the Fe-doped NiO/CC electrodes deliver better electrochemical and electrocatalytic performances compared to the NiO/CC electrodes owing to the substitution of Ni2+ in NiO by Fe3+ to provide further active sites, which can significantly enhance the stability during ORR and OER catalysis. Moreover, Fe-doped NiO/CC has more oxygen vacancies than NiO/CC, which is also very beneficial for supporting the cycling stability and reversibility of Li-O-2 batteries.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000733582900001

The electrochemical activity of the composite catalyst decreases slightly, but its performance retention after the accelerated durability test (ADT) is higher. In the single cell test, the MEA fabricated using the composite catalyst maintains good single cell power generation performance. Compared with the control fabricated with Pt/C (JM), the cell voltage at 1 A cm(-2) and the maximum power density are increased by 23 mV and 119 mW cm(-2), respectively. Especially, its durability under continuous cell reversal condition is also improved significantly, and the holding time is prolonged by 1 h.

Compared with alkaline or acidic electrolytes, the water splitting in neutral media is more daunting and less explored, which is mainly attributed to the additional challenge in improving the sluggish kinetics of water dissociation in neutral pH. However, if the neutral water splitting system could be realized, it would bring about the opportunity to direct splitting of less corrosive saline water that is the most abundant resource, which allows a massive and sustainable hydrogen fuel production. Here we review recent research in the development of both HER and OER electrocatalysts that are operated in neutral conditions from the perspective of the reaction mechanisms, rate-determining steps, and component-structure-activity correlations. Single-atom catalysts as an emerging field are also highlighted for their high atom utilization efficiency and high activity. In view of large-current-density operating conditions, three-dimensional freestanding electrodes where catalysts grow directly on the conductive substrates become the main tendency. In addition, superhydrophilic and superaerophobic electrode surfaces are summarized with regard to rapid ion diffusions and gas bubbles release, especially under large current densities. Finally, we address the challenges associated with neutral water electrolysis and future pathways in the hope of guiding the design of the electrocatalysts and electrode materials to make large-scale hydrogen production easier and more efficient.									66	2	0	0	4	0	66			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000618010600003

One school of thought reported pronounced catalyst influence on improving the oxidation kinetics of Li2O2. Many of them have attributed the enhancement to the presence of soluble species acting as mass-transport facilitators. Another school of thought reported that applying catalysts leads no improvement in the Li2O2 oxidation kinetics due to lacking of soluble species derived from Li2O2 oxidation. These discrepancies and open questions preclude rational design of efficient catalysts for nonaqueous OER In this work, using online electrochemical mass spectrometry, we show that solid catalysts (e.g., ruthenium) effectively promote Li2O2 oxidation kinetics to evolve O-2 in a solid-state environment. This unambiguously demonstrates that nonaqueous OER is a catalytic-active process and that catalysts enhance the OER via solid solid interaction between the catalyst and the discharge products instead of liquid phase mediations. Our findings highlight that the key governing factor for nonaqueous OER activity lies in catalyst's ability to interact/stabilize the solid reaction intermediates. Our work provides direct evidence of solid solid OER catalysis and insights into its underlying enhancement mechanism.									57	0	0	0	6	0	57			1932-7447			WOS:000373416500020

In 0.1 M H2SO4 solutions, the hydrogen desorption peaks overlap those of Cd(ad) turning the charge calculation problematic. To avoid such a situation, Cd upd was deposited in 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution. The results were transposed to acidic medium in order to analyse the effect of Cd upd on the oxygen reduction reaction. It was shown that the presence of Cd upd on the platinum surface inhibits the oxygen reduction reaction. The increase in Cd coverage firstly changes the mechanism of the orr from 4 to 2 electrons and finally inhibits it completely by blocking all the surface active sites.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0013-4686			WOS:A1992JQ77700001

Dual modification via heteroatom doping and surface treatment is an attractive strategy to overcome the above problems. Herein, for the first time, a hematite nanorod photoanode was ameliorated via the fluorine treatment (F-treatment) of both bulk and surface, enabling simultaneous charge separation from the interior to the interface. Accordingly, the novel photoanode (FeFx/F-Fe2O3) exhibited an outstanding PEC water oxidation activity, with a 3-fold improved photocurrent density than that obtained using unmodified alpha-Fe2O3. More specifically, fluorine doping (F-doping) in the hematite bulk remarkably increased the concentration of charge carriers and endowed it with favorable electrical conductivity for rapid charge transfer. Further surface F-treatment on F-doped alpha-Fe2O3 (F-Fe2O3) enriched the F-Fe bonds on the surface, which significantly boosted the OER kinetics and thereby inhibited the detrimental charge recombination. As a consequence, the efficiencies of bulk electron-hole pair separation and surface hole injection increased by 2.8 and 1.7 times, respectively. This study points to fluorine modulation as an attractive avenue to advance the PEC performance of metal oxide-based photoelectrode materials.									26	0	0	0	2	0	26			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000516533300036	31970358

Here we show that woodpile (WP)-structured Ir, consisting of 3D-printed, highly-ordered Ir nanowire building blocks, improve OER mass activity markedly. The WP structure secures the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) through enhanced utilization efficiency of the extended surface area of 3D WP catalysts. Moreover, systematic control of the 3D geometry combined with theoretical calculations and various electrochemical analyses reveals that facile transport of evolved O-2 gas bubbles is an important contributor to the improved ECSA-specific activity. The 3D nanostructuring-based improvement of ECSA and ECSA-specific activity enables our well-controlled geometry to afford a 30-fold higher mass activity of the OER catalyst when used in a single-cell PEMWE than conventional nanoparticle-based catalysts. Improved design of three-dimensionally nanostructured catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can play a key role in maximizing the catalytic performance. Here, the authors show that woodpile-structured iridium consisting of 3D-printed, highly-ordered nanowire building blocks significantly improve OER mass activity.									30	0	0	0	0	0	30			2041-1723			WOS:000577113300001	33004820

Here we studied flash-induced oscillatory patterns in oxygen evolution by previously dark-adapted cells of the green alga Dunaliella tertiolecta (Butcher) and the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum (Bohlin). The activity of the oxygen-evolving complex was found to be species-specific and influenced by photoacclimation. Results from measurements of oxygen flash yield obtained for these organisms grown under light-saturating conditions are directly comparable to those previously reported in the literature for other microalgae and higher plants. However, similar measurements on cells grown in low-light and/or light-starved conditions indicate an increased level of backward transitions (double misses) leading to the formation of super-reduced states (i.e. S-1 and S-2). Thus, in this communication, we present the first evidence that super-reduced states can be generated in vivo and speculate on how they may be physiologically important.									22	0	0	0	18	0	22			1445-4408			WOS:000181553800006	32689012

We have shown that, for simulation of the period-four oscillatory behavior of oxygen evolution, it is essential to consider the so-called intermediate S-state as an initial phase of each of the S-n-Sn+1, (n = 0, 1, 2, 3) transitions. The intermediate S-states are defined as [SnYZox]-states (n = 0, 1, 2, 3) and are formed with rate constant k(iSn) similar to 1.5 x 10(6) s(-1), which was determined from comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental data. The assumed intermediate S-states shift the equilibrium in reaction P680(+)Y(Z) -> P680Y(Z)(ox) more to the right and we suggest that kinetics of the intermediate S-states reflects a relaxation process associated with changes of the redox equilibrium in the above reaction. The oxygen oscillation is simulated without the miss and double-hit. parameters, if the intermediate S-states, which are not the source of the misses or the double-hits, are included in the simulation. Furthermore, we have shown that the intermediate S-states, together with S(2)Q(A)(-) charge recombination, are prerequisites for the simulation of the period-four oscillatory behavior of the chlorophyll fluorescence.									19	0	0	0	18	0	19			0006-3495	1542-0086		WOS:000254076300030	18178650

Cyclic voltammetry demonstrated that these amorphous alloys have excellent long-term cyclic durability when compared to crystalline Ni and Ni95Co5. Potentiostatic polarization measurements showed that the catalytic performance of amorphous Ni74.2Co5Nb12.5Y8.3 was maintained by displaying a low overpotential of 346 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) even after 10,000 cycles, while deactivation could be observed for the other catalysts. XPS analysis revealed that the retention of catalytic activity was attributed to the stabilization of beta-NiOOH. Through transmission electron microscopy analysis, it was found that the surface of amorphous Ni74.2Co5Nb12.5Y8.3 remained amorphous, although definitive signs of electrochemically induced Nb leaching could be observed. The leaching of Nb aided the overall performance since Nb is not electrochemically active toward the OER and was solely added to facilitate the formation of an amorphous structure. These findings not only support the excellent long-term stability and activity of amorphous Ni74.2Co5Nb12.5Y8.3 nanoparticles toward the alkaline OER but also demonstrate how anodic cycling can be used to condition the surface of the catalyst.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2574-0970			WOS:000583331600056

As a first task, the reaction of the inorganic part of the ruthenium-catalyzed BZ reaction was investigated under illumination of the system in the visible range. The concentrations of Br- and Ru(bpy)(3)(3+) were measured simultaneously by using a bromide ion-selective electrode in a spectrophotometric cell at different initial concentrations. The role of oxygen in this procedure was examined and found to be responsible for the evolution of Br-, rather than a direct reduction of bromate by the catalyst in the excited state. Mechanistic suggestions are made to explain these photoinduced effects.									39	1	0	0	2	0	39			0022-3654			WOS:A1995RZ37300025

Herein, we report a class of open hollow Co-Pt bimetallic nanoclusters embedded in mesoporous N-doped carbon nanoflake arrays grown on flexible carbon cloth (Co-Pt/C NAs, 2.5 wt% Pt), which demonstrate outstanding electrocatalytic activity and ultra-long durability for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution in alkaline media (50 mV for hydrogen evolution and 320 mV for oxygen evolution, vs. RHE). The high performance arises from the unique nanostructure and the synergy of Co-Pt promoting water dissociation as demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculation results. It can be directly utilized as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall alkaline water splitting, and it outperforms noble-metal-based materials in terms of much lower operating voltage (1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) and higher stability (no degradation at a constant current or voltage up to 120 h), representing a highly promising electrode for electrochemical energy conversion.									28	1	0	0	0	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448412700035

In this research, novel functional carbon nanotubes with multi-active sites including well-dispersed single-atom iron throughout the walls and encapsulated ultrafine iron nanoparticles were synthesized as an electrocatalyst (Fe-NP@Fe-N-C) through one-step pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks. High-resolution synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy were applied to characterize the unique structure of the electrocatalyst. In comparison to the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 electrodes, the newly prepared Fe-NP@Fe-N-C presented a superb bifunctional performance with its narrow potential difference (E-gap) of 0.73 V, which is ascribed to the metallic Fe nanoparticles that boosts the adsorption and activation of oxygen on the active sites with an enhanced O-2 adsorption capacity of 7.88 cm(3) g(-1) and synergistically functionalizes the iron atoms dispersed on the nanotubes. A rechargeable zinc-air battery based on Fe-NP@Fe-N-C exhibited a superior open-circuit voltage (1.45 V), power density (106.5 mW cm(-2)), and stable cycling performance. The green technique developed in this work for the fabrication of functional nanotubes raises the prospect of making more efficient electrocatalysts for sustainable energy cells.

In this work, we study the catalytic activities of both rutile RuO2 and RuO2 monolayer for ORR and OER in the battery using density functional theory method. Computational results show that the RuO2 monolayer exhibits a higher catalytic activity than the rutile RuO2 does. More interestingly, it is found that during discharge a similar lattice structure between RuO2 monolayer and Li2O2 {0001} surface can induce the formation of crystallized Li2O2 with the conductive {0001} surface exposed, whereas during charge the RuO2 monolayer can attract the remaining Li2O2 to its surface spontaneously, thus maintaining the solid-solid reaction interface. Our results suggest that the RuO2 monolayer is a promising catalytic material for nonaqueous lithium-oxygen batteries.									37	0	0	0	2	0	37			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000373416500007

However, the high cost and poor stability of conventional electrocatalysts, which are based on precious metals, hinder the large-scale commercialization of this technique. Therefore, the current research demands development of highly active catalysts which do not require any precious metal. Herein, we report the fabrication of a Co(OH)(2) electrocatalyst on a metallic Cu film supported on a Ni foam substrate. The developed electrocatalyst has dense Co(OH)(2) nano-flakes on the Cu film and exhibits excellent performance towards the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline solution. A current density of 10 mA/cm(2) can be achieved at an overpotential of 325 mV and the catalyst has a small Tafel slope value of only 77 mV/dec. In addition, the catalytic reaction remains stable for 20 h of chronoamperometry test without any noticeable decay. The promising catalytic performance of this catalyst is attributed to the synergistic effect between the Co(OH)(2) electrocatalyst and the Cu-modified Ni foam. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This article presents a comprehensive analysis of laboratory data on the effects of high oxygen partial pressures on photosynthesis, and on photo-lithotrophic and chemo-organotrophic growth, of oxygen-producing organisms. The article also contains an analysis of the extent to which high oxygen concentrations occur at the site of photosystem II (PSII) activity under natural conditions today and in the past. The conclusion is that the oxygen concentrations found in nature are very unlikely to reach that needed to cause 50% inhibition of the photosynthetic oxygen production reaction in subthylakoid particles, but that it is just possible that a small part of the inhibition of photosynthesis and of photo-lithotrophic growth by oxygen can be attributed to inhibition of oxygen production by PSII.									31	0	0	0	30	0	31			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000248913400004	17611812

J	Mai, Hien Duy; Kim, Suncheol; Yoo, Hyojong								Gold nanodots-decorated nickel hydroxide nanoflowers for enhanced electrochemical oxygen evolution activity								JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY				82				359	366		10.1016/j.jiec.2019.10.035				FEB 25 2020	2020	Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is considered a major challenge in the production of efficient electrochemical water splitting devices. To overcome the challenge, the development of inexpensive electrochemical catalysts with high energy conversion efficiencies is vital. Nanohybrids composed of noble metal nanoparticles and transition metal hydroxides often possess catalytically active sites that are beneficial for OER performance. In this study, we report a successful synthesis of Ni(OH)(2) nanoflowers with a high degree of crystallinity and uniformity. The as-prepared Ni(OH)(2) nanoflowers are employed as templates for effective and controllable loading of Au nanodots to obtain Ni(OH)(2)@Au nanohybrids. An examination of the OER activity reveals that Ni(OH)(2)@Au nanohybrids exhibit a considerably lower overpotential (eta) value (390 mV) at a current density of 5 mA cm(-2) and a smaller Tafel slope (120 mV dec(-1)) than those of Ni(OH)(2) nanoflowers (540 mV and 324 my dec(-1), respectively). The OER enhancement effect is mainly attributed to the decoration of Au nanodots, inducing charge transfer from Ni to Au and thereby stabilizing the Ni species at high oxidation levels. Moreover, the uniform loading of Au nanodots on the anisotropic Ni(OH)(2) nanoflowers provides more active interfacial surfaces, which are expedient to OER.

Herein, the interconnected nanoarrays consisting of Co-Ni bimetallic metaphosphate nanoparticles embedded in a carbon matrix (Co2-xNixP4O12-C) are fabricated through a mild phosphorylating process of cobalt-nickel zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (CoNi-ZIF). Density functional theory calculations reveal moderate adsorption of oxygenated intermediates on the doping Ni site, and current density simulations imply homogeneous and higher current density due to the morphology integrity of the interconnected metaphosphate nanoarrays. As a consequence, the optimized Co1.6Ni0.4P4O12-C affords a superior OER activity (eta = 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and long-term stability in alkaline media (1 m KOH) that are comparable to most reported catalysts. The strategy for balancing the doping effect and morphology effect provides a new perspective when designing and developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage applications.									79	6	0	0	5	0	79			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000531346200001

However, pure Ni3S2 towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) exhibits relatively low catalytic activity. Herein, a one-step annealing strategy is demonstrated for the synthesis of Ni3S2 nanowires on nickel foam (NF) through N doping towards vigorous HER performance both in acid and alkaline solution. The 1D N-Ni3S2 nanowires, integrated onto a 3D NF electrode, show a high catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 196 mV and a small Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1) in an acid electrolyte. In an alkaline medium, the N-Ni3S2 NWs exhibit a low overpotential of 105 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is lower than other reported Ni3S2-based HER catalysts. The superior HER catalytic performance is attributed to its unique structural features, both the morphology and electronic structure. Our work provides profound guidance for the design and optimization of electrocatalysts for an efficient HER.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000444190500034	29998236

The fabricated material was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The sequentially deposited MnOx/Co-Fe catalysts, tested using cyclic voltammetry (CV), showed activity for both the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR and OER), with better performance than either MnOx or Co-Fe alone. The fabricated material was assembled into a zinc-air battery as the air electrode component for battery cycling tests. The zinc-air battery using MnOx/Co-Fe catalysts exhibited good discharge-recharge performance and a cycling efficiency of 59.6% at 5 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to Pt/C catalysts. In addition, the electrodeposited MnOx/Co-Fe layer showed strong adhesion to the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and was structurally stable throughout 40 h of battery cycling. (C) The Author(s) 2017.

Owing to their distinguishable characteristics, the fabricated honeycomb porous-structured NiFeCo-LDH@MXene composites exhibited outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for pair hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline medium. The developed NiFeCo-LDH@MXene electrocatalyst required low overpotentials of 130 and 34 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively. Furthermore, an assembled NiFeCo-LDH@MXene||NiFeCo-LDH@MXene device exhibited a cell voltage of 1.41 V for overall water splitting with a robust firmness for over 24 h to reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density, signifying outstanding performance for water splitting reactions. These results demonstrated the promising potential of the designed 3D porous NiFeCo-LDH@MXene sheets as outstanding candidates to replace future green energy conversion devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000845554200001	36014753

Herein, we developed a convenient, efficient, and scalable method for the construction of monometallic Co-LDHs with tunable Con+ (n = 2, 3) concentration by a one-pot solvothermal reaction in a short time (e.g., 2 and 4 h) using only cobalt nitrate and hexamine as raw materials. The catalytic performance of Co-LDHs was mainly determined by the Con+ (n = 2, 3) concentration, which could be simply regulated by tuning the solvothermal time. Combining the joint merits of three-dimensional flowerlike architecture (abundant accessible active sites and a fast electron/mass transport), Co-LDHs-4 with abundant Co3+ species exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction in terms of a low overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10) = 241 mV) and long-term durability for 70 h at 100 mA cm(-2), better than the state-of-the-art IrO2 and most of the reported analogues. Besides, Co-LDHs-2 enriched in Co3+ displayed a superior electrochemical activity for H2O2 detection with a broad linear range (0.002-20 mM), a low detection limit (0.002 mM), and a high response sensitivity (272.02 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2)). Therefore, this work opens a new horizon for the rational development of a highly active electrocatalyst with tunable concentrations of active components.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526543400055	32097560

However, the synthesis of phase-controllable perovskite oxide nanosheets with thickness down to a few nanometers remains a challenge since the formation of a perovskite phase often requires long-time calcination at high temperatures. Here, a salt-templated strategy for fabrication of atomically thin perovskite oxide of LaMnO3 with tailored phase structure for highly active OER catalysts is reported. The orthorhombic structure of LaMnO3 nanosheets demonstrates much higher electrochemical activity than the tetragonal or hexagonal phase and the benchmark IrO2 catalyst, exhibiting extremely small onset overpotential (approximate to 70 mV) and a low overpotential (approximate to 324 mV at 10 mA cm-2disk) in alkaline solution. The remarkable OER activity of this catalyst is attributed to the desired surface binding energetics (or the unique electronic structures) inherent to the orthorhombic phase, as predicted by density functional theory calculations and confirmed by experimental measurements. Further, it is believed that this study paves a new path toward rational the design of perovskite oxide nanosheets with desired phase structures for many applications.									13	0	0	0	0	0	12			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000669386800001

Using urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to replace oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can reduce the potential at anode and simultaneously purify the nitrogen-containing wastewater. Herein, the carbon encapsulated Ni-WO2 hybrids self-supported on nickel foam [denoted as (Ni-WO2)@C/NF] is synthesized via a hydrothermal method and then annealing in high temperature. The physicochemical characterizations indicate that the Ni-WO2 hybrids are encapsulated by carbon layer and the particles are evenly dispersed on the surface of nickel foam. It only needs a potential of 1.31 V and -77 mV for UOR and HER to produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), exhibited outstanding catalytic activity. Furthermore, it only requires 1.38 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall urea oxidation and lasting 80 h at 80 mA cm(-2) without attenuation, highlighting the stability. This good performance could be originated from the synergistic effect between nickel and tungsten oxide, the carbon-encapsulated and the self-supported structure. This work offers a promising method for cost-effective and energy-saving H-2 production and nitrogen-containing wastewater treatment.									36	0	0	0	2	0	36			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000523643100002

The assembly of the PEC consisted of an anionic solid polymer electrolyte membrane (gas separator) clamped between an n-type Fe(2)O(3)photoanode and a p-type CuO photocathode. The semiconductors were deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) transparent substrates and the cell was investigated with the hematite surface directly exposed to a solar simulator. Ionomer dispersions obtained from the dissolution of commercial polymers in the appropriate solvents were employed as an ionic interface with the photoelectrodes. Thus, the overall photoelectrochemical water splitting occurred in two membrane-separated compartments, i.e., the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. A cost-effective NiFeOx co-catalyst was deposited on the hematite photoanode surface and investigated as a surface catalytic enhancer in order to improve the OER kinetics, this reaction being the rate-determining step of the entire process. The co-catalyst was compared with other well-known OER electrocatalysts such as La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8CoO3(LSFCO) perovskite and IrRuOx. The Ni-Fe oxide was the most promising co-catalyst for the oxygen evolution in the anionic environment in terms of an enhanced PEC photocurrent and efficiency. The materials were physico-chemically characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2073-4344		WOS:000546007000045

Although significant advances have been made to improve bulk charge properties as well as surface catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction, it still remains challenging to meet the standards for practical applications. As such, deeper understanding and analysis is necessary to guide efforts to achieve higher activities. This perspective reviews and analyzes the important progress on hematite photoanodes from multiple angles. We highlight the critical role of defect chemistry in terms of bulk properties and surface reaction kinetics. Careful manipulation of the quantity of oxygen vacancies and majority/minority charge carriers is shown to be essential for higher activity. One major type of surface recombination site, which can be readily removed, is identified to be an Fe2+ species based on multiple photoelectrochemical and spectroscopic observations. Analyzing Xray absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical energy diagrams, we present a clear picture of water oxidation dynamics at different operating conditions, revealing the relationship between photogenerated holes and surface recombination states. Finally, we conclude that to make hematite photoanodes commercially viable, tuning the minority charge transport properties should be regarded as the priority.									36	0	0	0	2	0	36			2398-4902			WOS:000469258600001

Nevertheless, the anions in the OER catalysts have been neglected for various reasons such as inactive sites, dissolution, and oxidation, amongst others. Herein, we applied a model catalyst s-Ni(OH)(2) to track the anionic behavior in the catalyst during the electrochemical process to fill this gap. The advanced operando synchrotron radiation Fourier transform infrared (SR-FTIR) spectroscopy, synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy (SRPES) depth detection and differential X-ray absorption fine structure (D-XAFS) spectrum jointly point out that some oxidized sulfur species (SO42) will selfoptimize new Ni-S bonds during OER process. Such amazing anionic self-optimization (ASO) behavior has never been observed in the OER process. Subsequently, the optimization-derived component shows a significantly improved electrocatalytic performance (activity, stability, etc.) compared to reference catalyst Ni(OH)(2). Theoretical calculation further suggests that the ASO process indeed derives a thermodynamically stable structure of the OER catalyst, and then gives its superb catalytic performance by optimizing the thermodynamic and kinetic processes in the OER, respectively. This work demonstrates the vital role of anions in the electrochemical process, which will open up new perspectives for understanding OER and provide some new ideas in related fields (especially catalysis and chemistry).

Herein, we report a one-step in situ etching hydrothermal method to construct Co(OH)(2) and Ni(OH)(2) heterostructure nanomaterials, successfully activating the basal plane of Co(OH)(2). The abundant lattice strains that appear at heterogeneous interfaces cause a downshift of the d-band center of Co in Co(OH)(2) and promote the desorption of oxygen during the OER process, which accelerates reaction kinetics of the OER and improves catalytic activity effectively. Furthermore, the electron interaction at the Co(OH)(2)/Ni(OH)(2) interfaces leads to charge polarization, which will regulate the adsorption and dissociation of H2O molecules and enhances mass and electron transfer. Owing to the above advantages of Co(OH)(2)/Ni(OH)(2) interfaces, the as-prepared composite catalysts show an excellent OER catalytic performance with a low overpotential of only about 270 mV at 20 mA cm(-2), maintaining long-term catalytic stability for more than 24 h at 20 mA cm(-2).									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000655734700001

Their electrochemical water splitting activity is, however, somewhat limited. This work reports a facile approach to promote the water splitting kinetics of a perovskite oxide, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta, by constructing a core-shell structured composite, CoNi/Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta/N-doped-C, which couples Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta with CoNi nanoparticles and N-doped-C. By this simple approach, the hydrogen evolution reaction inactive Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta is transformed into a highly efficient catalyst (CoNi/Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta/N-doped-C), which shows a small overpotential (0.18 V) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. The CoNi/Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta/N-doped-C also exhibits a remarkably high activity for oxygen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH solution. A small overpotential of 0.22 mV is demanded to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to that of pristine Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta and many state-of-the-art catalysts. An alkaline electrolyzer using CoNi/Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta/N-doped-C as both electrodes delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small operating voltage (1.64 V), much superior to a symmetric prototype using Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta. Therefore, CoNi/Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta/N-doped-C is among the best bifunctional catalysts for water splitting. More generally, this work opens new opportunities regarding designs of novel electrocatalysts and further improvements of state-of-the-art catalysts for various applications.									8	0	0	0	0	0	7			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000459842800011

This study reports on the electrochemical behaviour of two different NiFe-oxide compositions (i.e., Ni1Fe1-oxide and Ni1Fe2-oxide) prepared by the oxalate method. These catalysts are assessed for single-cell operation in an MEA including a Sustainion (TM) anion-exchange membrane. The electrochemical polarization shows a current density of 650 mA cm(-2) at 2 V and 50 degrees C for the Ni1Fe1 anode composition. A durability test of 500 h is carried out using potential cycling as an accelerated stress-test. This shows a decrease in current density of 150 mA cm(-2) mainly during the first 400 h. The performance achieved for the anion-exchange membrane electrolyser single-cell based on the NiFeOx catalyst appears promising. However, further improvements are required to enhance the stability under these operating conditions.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11				1996-1073		WOS:000537688400189

The doping concentrations of N and S of 3DSNG can be easily modulated by growth parameters, which strongly influence its catalytic activity. As a free-standing hybrid electrocatalyst without polymer binder, the optimized 3DSNG/NF doped with 2.56 at% N and 2.95 at% S, delivers good catalytic activity: it shows a very low Tafel slope of 45.61 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solution, which is much lower than that of RuO2 (78.62 mV dec(-1)); it requires only a very low overpotential of 339 mV to obtain a large current density of 100 mA cm(-2), which is far lower than that of RuO2 (418 mV); furthermore, it exhibits good long-term stability even after 50-h current-time test. The good OER performance and stability of 3DSNG/NF can be attributed to the synergistic effects originating from its unique hierarchical architecture. The porous and conductive graphene skeleton can not only guarantee the mechanical and structural stability, but also facilitate the electron transfer and ion diffusion; most important, the homogenously doped nitrogen and sulfur atoms create abundant catalytic active sites.

(IrxCu1-xOy nanotubes were investigated to be composed of rutile IrO2 phase where Cu substituted Ir sites. This elemental subsititution induced the amorphization and generation of oxygen vacancy defects in the rutile phase of IrxCu1-xOy nanotubes. Among IrxCu1-xOy series, Ir0.48Cu0.52Oy nanotubes, having a reduced noble Ir content by more than a half, showed the best activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in pH-universal condition, and even outperformed the material containing only Ir, commercial Ir/C and the other Ir-based binary metal oxide catalysts found in the literature. Of importance, Ir0.48Cu0.52Oy presented an excellent stability during continuous OER for 20,000 s in all the acidic, neutral and alkaline media despite their amorphousness. The introduction of Cu into IrO2 was beneficial for improving not only the OER catalytic activity but the durability along with cost-effectiveness.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

RuO2 is one of the benchmark oxygen evolving electrocatalysts, but remains challenging in high activity in all-pH electrolytes. Herein, we report a confined oxygenation strategy using the finite oxygen species from graphene oxide to synthesize two dimensional (2D) heterostructures of intrinsically defective RuO2 nanocrystals uniformly grown on graphene (2D D-RuO2/G), showing ultrathin thickness of 9 nm, high specific surface area of 125 m(2) g(-1), enriched hydroxylated surface and notably intrinsic defective RuO2 with low Ru-O coordination number of 5. Consequently, 2D D-RuO2/G exhibits a robust stability and an extraordinary oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance both in acidic and alkaline solutions, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 169 and 175 mV, and a water oxidation turn over frequency of 1.07 and 1.25 S-1 at 270 mV, respectively, corresponding to 344 mV of total overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, which greatly exceeds the state-of-the-art of pH-universal OER electrocatalysts. Theoretical studies indicate that intrinsic defective Ru sites can enhance the adsorption and accelerate the decomposition of hydroxyl groups to boost the OER activity. This confined oxygenation strategy provides the opportunities to construct 2D advanced defective OER electrocatalysts in all-pH electrolytes.									28	3	0	0	1	0	28			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000595909600002

Herein, a heterointerface strategy is proposed for constructing 1T-phase tungsten sulfide decorated on cobalt sulfide for modulating the electronic structure and retarding the phase change of the underlying cobalt sulfide due to the high oxophilicity and strong electronic interaction, as well as the metallic feature. Consequently, an impressive electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen reduction is achieved with a comparable mass activity to platinum-group metals and no noticeable degradation regardless of what is performed in the rotating-disk electrode and gas diffusion electrode setups. Moreover, the turnover frequency is almost one order of magnitude higher than that of cobalt sulfide for catalyzing oxygen evolution. When employed as the cathode of a zinc-air battery, it delivers an improved cycling performance over 480 h of operation and a peak power density of 183.5 mW cm(-2), outperforming most transition metal sulfides reported to date. This work provides an effective strategy to improve the activity and durability of first-row transition metal sulfides by interface engineering for oxygen electrocatalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000797053200001

The catalysts were prepared using impregnation and microwave irradiation methods. It has been found, that the combination of both of these methods was a more efficient way for fabrication of high catalytically active Co3O4/C and AuCo3O4/C catalysts. The synthesized Co3O4/C and AuCo3O4/C catalysts showed high electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction in an alkaline medium. The ORR onset potential for the investigated catalysts was comparable to theoretical ORR potential values between 0.7 and 0.9 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000514749500020

Herein, NiSe nanowire arrays are controllably grown on carbon fibers (CFs) by a simple solvothermal process. The NiSe/CFs catalyst was characterized with electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction techniques. In 1.0 M KOH, the performance of the NiSe/CFs catalyst towards electrocatalytic OER was investigated. At the current density of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2), the overpotentials are only 318 and 334 mV, respectively. The Tafel slope is 46 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the NiSe/CFs catalyst shows no degradation after more than 120 h of continuous oxygen evolution. The performance is thus superior to the commercial IrO2 catalysts. The excellent activity of the NiSe/CFs catalyst for OER benefits from its structural merits and the in situ formed catalytically active species. This work sheds light on designing highly efficient, stable, and cheap catalysts for flexible OER catalysts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

With the aim of tuning electronic structure of electrocatalysts and altering potential limiting step of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the ultra-small Pt, La co-doped IrO2 nanoparticles with average size of 2 nm highly dispersed on N-doped carbon (NC) was designed. Impressively, the representative Pt0.1La0.1-IrO2@NC exhibited the record performance toward OER in 0.5 M H2SO4 with a low overpotential of 205 mV (10 mA.cm(-2)), an extremely excellent stability of 135 h, and a fairly high TOF value of 5.71 s(-1) at eta = 280 mV.

Developing a bifunctional catalyst with high activity and durability is an effective strategy to address the above challenges. Herein, a Co3O4/Mn3O4 nanohybrid with heterointerfaces is designed as advanced cathode catalyst for ZABs. Density functional theory calculations show the heterogeneous interface between Co3O4/Mn3O4 can improve the dynamics of carrier transport and thus enhancing the catalytic activity and durability. The Co3O4/Mn3O4 catalyst anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) exhibits high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with a half-wave potential of 0.86 V, and excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with the potential of 1.59 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which are comparable to the commercial noble metal catalysts. The improved ORR/OER catalytic activity is ascribed to the synergistic effect of heterointerfaces between Co3O4 and Mn3O4 as well as the improved conductivity and contact area of oxygen/catalysts/electrolytes three-phase interface by rGO. Furthermore, a home-made ZAB based on Co3O4/Mn3O4/rGO shows a high open circuit voltage of 1.54 V, a large power density of 194.6 mW cm(-2) and good long-term cycling stability of nearly 400 h at 5 mA cm(-2), which affords a promising bifunctional oxygen catalyst for rechargeable ZABs.

Herein, a biomass-derived three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon/cobalt silicate (C/Co2SiO4) architecture is developed as a support for loading nickel oxide (NiOx) species to prepare an earth-abundant and non-noble-metal-based NiOx/C/Co2SiO4 electrocatalyst. The NiOx nanoparticles are dispersed on 3D C/Co2SiO4 support and the introduction of NiOx species improves the OER active sites and shows the bimetal (Co, Ni) synergetic effect. The NiOx/C/Co2SiO4 electrocatalyst exhibits the overpotential with 355 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope with 40 mV dec(-1) and large electrochemical active surface areas (ECSA), which are superior to C/Co2SiO4 support and NiOx. The catalytic properties achieved herein are superior or comparable to most transition metal oxides/hydroxides. The findings reveal that the introduction of NiOx nanoparticles can greatly boost the OER property of C/Co2SiO4 support. This work not only develops a non-noble-metal-based NiOx/C/Co2SiO4 catalyst, but also verifies that the introduction of metal oxide species on biomass-derived 3D C/Co2SiO4 provides a new horizon to explore economical, high-efficient and robust OER catalysts.

Numerous bi- and multimetal-based, low-cost, high-performance OER electrocatalysts have been developed. However, unary metal-based high-performance electrocatalysts are seldom reported. In the present study, Co-2(OH)(3)Cl/vanadium oxide (VOy) composites are synthesized, from which VOy is completely etched out by a simple cyclic voltammetry treatment, which simultaneously transforms Co-2(OH)(3)Cl in situ to ultrafine CoOOH. The selective removal of VOy modulates the nature of the surface in the obtained CoOOH by creating surface oxygen vacancies (V-o), along with disordered grain boundaries. The best-performing CoOOH with optimum V-o is found to be associated with a low overpotential of 282 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) catalytic current density on a simple glassy carbon electrode for OER. This facile protocol of selectively etching VOy to modulate the nature of the surface is successfully applied to synthesize another Fe-based electrocatalyst with high OER performance, thus establishing its utility for unary metal-based electrocatalyst synthesis.									39	0	0	0	4	0	39			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000502400200001

Here, we prepared Pd3Ru alloy nanocatalysts with Ru segregated on the surfaces, forming adatoms and clusters. This structure dramatically lowered the overpotential of Pd toward HER in 1 M KOH by 104 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The HER activity was even higher than that of Pt (6 mV improvement at 10 mA cm(-2)). Theoretical simulation results revealed that Ru adatoms/clusters on the surface could weaken the hydrogen-binding energy and promote the OH adsorption, consequently lowering the reaction barrier of the rate-determining step in HER. Our findings are of significance for clarifying the role of Ru in bimetallic catalysts and rational design of more active catalysts for HER/HOR.									77	4	0	0	3	0	77			2155-5435			WOS:000489204000087

The reaction mechanism is supplemented by a detailed description of oxygen plasma chemistry (19 species and 142 reaction channels) and is used to model an atmospheric laser ablated uranium plume via a 0D (global) model. The global model is used to analyze the evolution of key uranium molecular species predicted by the reaction mechanism, and the initial stage of formation of uranium oxide species.									24	0	0	0	7	0	24			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000414589100001

J	Hu, Ankang; Qiu, Rui; Wu, Zhen; Zhang, Hui; Li, Junli								CPU-GPU coupling independent reaction times method in NASIC and application in water radiolysis by FLASH irradiation								BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS				8	2					025015	10.1088/2057-1976/ac52d9				MAR 1 2022	2022	The mechanism of the FLASH effect remains unclear and could be revealed by studying chemical reactions during irradiation. Monte Carlo simulation of the radiolytic species is an effective tool to analyze chemical reactions, but the simulation is limited by computing costs of the step-by-step simulation of radiolytic species, especially when considering beam with complex time structure. The complexity of the time structure of beams from accelerators in FLASH radiotherapy requires a high-performance Monte Carlo code. In this work, we develop a CPU-GPU coupling accelerating code with the independent reaction times (IRT) method to extend the chemical module of our nanodosimetry Monte Carlo code NASIC. Every chemical molecule in the microenvironment contains time information to consider the reactions from different tracks and simulate beams with complex time structures. Performance test shows that our code significantly improved the computing efficiency of the chemical module by four orders of magnitude. Then the code is used to study the oxygen depletion hypothesis in FLASH radiotherapy for different conditions by setting different parameters. The transient oxygen consumption rate values in the water are calculated when the pulses width ranges from 2 ps to 2 mu s, the total dose ranges from 0.5 Gy to 100 Gy and the initial oxygen concentration ranges from 0.1% to 21%. The time evolution curves are simulated to study the effect of the time structure of an electron linear accelerator. Results show that the total dose in several microseconds is a better indicator reflecting the radiolytic oxygen consumption rate than the dose rate. The initial oxygen greatly affects the oxygen consumption rate because of the reaction competition. The diffusion of oxygen determined by the physiological parameters is the key factor affecting oxygen depletion during the radiation using electron linear accelerators. Our code provides an efficient tool for simulating water radiolysis in different conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2057-1976			WOS:000757615100001	35133302

In this work, structurally stable electrode plates are developed based on the nanostructured Ni-Fe catalysts on highly porous and dimensionally stable Co reactive deposited on Ti substrates, Ni-Fe@Co/Ti. SEM analysis shows the hierarchically structured micro- and nano-porous structure of the Co electrode on Ti substrates by reactive deposition route. The surface area of the reactive deposited Co is 3 times larger than that of the conventional electrodeposited Co electrode, providing highly porous and stable base for the subsequent deposition of Ni-Fe electrocatalysts. The as-prepared Ni-Fe@Co/Ti electrode exhibits high catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution in alkaline solutions, achieving an onset potential of as low as 1.44 V (eta = 210 mV) and delivering a current of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 0.26 V. Most importantly, the electrode shows excellent stability with negligible degradation under the discharge current density at 100 mA cm(-2) for 100 h, demonstrating the practical applicability of the Ni-Fe@Co/Ti nanostructured electrodes for industrial scale water electrolysis.

This strategy involves embedding Pd2+ cation into the interlayer of sodium titanate sheets through cation exchange with Na+, followed by annealing to obtain metallic Pd NP-embedded anatase phase TiO2 (Pd-TiO2). The resulting Pd-TiO2 shows excellent electrocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (i.e., an overpotential of 108 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) with good stability in acidic media, along with good activity and excellent stability under basic and neutral conditions. The high HER activity is attributed to the uniform distribution and strong attachment of Pd NPs in the TiO2 nanospheres, the high porosity of mesoporous TiO2 nanostructures, and the creation of oxygen vacancies in TiO2 induced during the cation exchange process. Our findings are supported by the density functional theory calculations, which demonstrate the synergistic effect between Pd and TiO2 and the contribution of oxygen vacancies to the high HER performance.

However, further modification of the reconstructed active surfaces for better catalytic performances has not been reported. In this work, NiSe nanorods are prepared on nickel foam (NiSe@NF) as the pre-catalyst for electrochemical OER. It is revealed that non-stoichiometric NiO nanosheets with abundant Ni vacancies (NixO) are formed on the surfaces of NiSe nanorods (NixO/NiSe@NF) via in-situ electrochemical oxidation. Furthermore, the OER performances are obviously improved after heteroatom Fe is incorporated electrochemically into NixO nanosheets ((FeNi)O/NiSe@NF). For OER to have a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution, the as-prepared (FeNi)O/NiSe@NF electrode only needs an overpotential of 268 mV. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the formation of Ni vacancy can increase the free energy of *OH. More importantly, the incorporation of heteroatom Fe into Ni vacancy can significantly decrease the free energy of *O, which enables Fe-NiO to have the lowest theoretical overpotential for OER in this work. The present work provides a facile and universal strategy to modify the reconstructed active oxides' surfaces for higher electrocatalytic performances. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, we constructed N-doped carbon fibers as the substrate, which could provide high electronic conductivity and large surface area for the load of active catalysts, as well as close incorporation. The nanosheets morphology of NiSe2/Ni5P4 is conducive to enlarging the specific surface area and exposing more active sites. The electrical conductivity is improved by the selenide and carbon nano-fiber substrate. The multiple features, including the unique structure characteristics, heterostructure of NiSe2 and Ni5P4, and high electroconductivity, endow NiSe2/Ni5P4 with superior catalytic activity towards water splitting. As a result, the overpotentials at the cathode current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) upon NiSe2/Ni5P4 nanosheets are 112 and 350 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4. For oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the overpotential of NiSe2/Ni5P4 nanosheets at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte is 316 mV. Furthermore, the bifunctional NiSe2/Ni5P4 nanosheets exhibit excellent working stability for both HER, OER and overall water splitting, showing potential application in hydrogen energy.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000623253600001

It is still a big challenge to achieve an efficient integration of three functions in one freestanding electrode. Herein, a facile and upscalable strategy is demonstrated, to construct cobalt nanoparticle-encapsulated 3D conductive films (Co/CNFs), which were induced by in situ solid diffusion from bulk cobalt metal. Under high-temperature, volatile cobalt species from bulk cobalt foil are trapped by the contacted nitrogen-rich carbons, followed by catalytic growth of interconnected carbon tubes, forming the 3D structured film. This resulting film can be directly preformed as self-supporting and binder-free electrode, which simultaneously facilitates the ORR, OER, and HER with excellent activities and superior stability. Furthermore, such "all-in-one" film also exhibits remarkable performance for Zn-air batteries and overall water splitting, demonstrating its feasibility for practical applications.									243	15	0	0	10	0	245			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000462619000027	30721541

Herein, based on polymerizable ionic liquids (PILs) functionalized with nitrate groups as pore former and precursor of C and N, a facile one-pot thermal treatment method was developed to construct a hybrid electrocatalyst consisting of earth-abundant materials, which was made of Co-based nanoparticles (NPs) grown on 2D N-doped and macroporous carbon nanosheets (pCNs) of approximately 20-50nm thickness, that is, Co-N-pCNs. The obtained Co-N-pCNs catalyst manifests enhanced catalytic performance for both ORR and OER, even compared with the best-known commercial catalysts, such as Pt/C and IrO2. The enhanced catalytic activity arises from the 2D nanosheets and porous structures, well-dispersed Co-based NPs on the carbon sheets, the introduction of electron-rich nitrogen, and the stability by the carbon protection of Co-based NPs between the interlayers of nanosheets. Our present work supplies a novel opportunity for exploring 2D non-precious-metal catalysts for ORR and OER.									57	1	0	0	3	0	59			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000400982900011

In order to explore an efficient method to fabricate a high-performance electrocatalyst via modification of advanced nanostructure, a coaxial electrospinning method with in-situ synthesis and subsequent carbonization to construct 3D flexible Janus-like electrocatalysts is developed. The resulting Janus nanofibers have a unique core-shell hollow fiber structure, where NiFe alloy electrocatalysts supported by N-doped carbon nanobelt are located on the inner wall of the carbon layer, and leaf-like Co-N nanosheets are anchored on the outer wall of the carbon layer. As a result, the electrocatalyst exhibits excellent bifunctional catalytic performance for ORR and OER, demonstrating the small potential gap value of 0.73 V between the ORR half-wave potential and the OER potential at 10 mA cm(-2), which is even comparable to the mixed commercial noble catalyst with 20% Pt/C and RuO2. The rechargeable Zn-air battery is constructed and displays a large open-circuit voltage of 1.44 V, high power density (130 mW cm(-2)) and energy density (874 Wh kg(-1)). This study provides a concept to synthesize and construct high performance bifunctional electrocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000770490600001	35304814

The biological effect of radiation depends on the dose (D = I.t; I and t are the intensity and time of irradiance, respectively). In photosynthesis light is a substrate for the photoelectronic conversion and can be toxic to photosystem II (PSII) as well. This toxicity is expressed by the degradation of the reaction centre D1 protein and, as a consequence, the loss of PSII activity of wild type and mutant Synechocystis cells being subjected to high light. The aim of the present study was to examine whether the photoinhibition of PSII follows the reciprocity law characteristic of a dose response. We measured the change of steady state level of room temperature fluorescence at 685 nm (due to the antenna and reaction center chlorophylls), variable chlorophyll fluorescence and oxygen evolution of wild type Synechocystis 6803 cells after exposure to high light intensities (1200-8000 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) for different durations (0 - 20 min). We observed that the log of degree of PSII inactivation as a function of light intensity gave a straight line, indicating the validity of the reciprocity law. Average cross-sectional areas for inactivation were found to be 0.066 m(2)/mol (steady state oxygen evolution), 0.12 m(2)/mol (steady state level of F-685nm), and 0.25 m(2)/mol (induction of F-v/F-max).									37	0	0	0	33	0	37			0176-1617	1618-1328		WOS:A1995QP97700004		
J	PFEIFFER, B; SCHULTZE, JW								ELECTROCHEMICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF THE AUTOPHORETIC COATING PROCESS								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY				21	10			877	884		10.1007/BF01042454				OCT 1991	1991	Autophoretic coating (AC) is a complex chemical process consisting of various electrochemical partial reactions such as metal corrosion, hydrogen evolution and peroxide and oxygen reduction. While the redox potential of the bath is very positive, about 0.6 V, the coating process takes place at about -0.2 V dependent on the bath composition. The low conductivity of the bath is necessary to maintain the dispersion, but it hinders the kinetic investigations. Nevertheless potentiodynamic polarization curves show that the diffusion limited peroxide reduction and the corrosion of iron are the most important reactions. From the corrosion current density a maximum weight loss of 0.1 mg cm-2 is estimated for a standard film of 20-mu-m thickness. Hydrogen evolution is almost negligible during the first period of dipping. This conclusion can be justified by measurements in the hydrogen permeation cell. The partial current densities are not influenced by various emulgators, but the dispersion catalyses the hydrogen evolution and inhibits the anodic corrosion. The diffusion of peroxide is hindered. Potentiostatic measurements in various solutions show the role of ferrous ions deriving from corrosion in the case of iron or by reduction of ferric ions in the case of gold. Measurements at a disc electrode show that the cathodic reactions are dominated by diffusion and migration.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0021-891X			WOS:A1991GG99100007

Among them, nickel- and cobalt-prepared samples are showing high activity as water oxidation catalysts in alkaline electrolytes. The applicability to waste metal material is exemplified using one of the most abundant waste metal alloys, i.e. steel: with a suitable multi-layer architecture, comprising, a large surface-area iron oxyhydroxide core-geometry and a steel-derived catalytic overlayer, the overpotential for oxygen evolution (at 10 mA cm(-2)) could be improved to only 370 mV. Chemical analysis is provided to elucidate the reaction pathway, encompassing metal halogenation, formation of meta-stable metal-organic intermediates or direct electrochemical reduction, respectively. Structural peculiarities of the derived films are finally demonstrated upon development of a photoactive nickel oxyhydroxide/silicon junction realizing a photocurrent of 1 mA cm(-2) at the thermodynamic potential for oxygen evolution and short-term stabilization in the range of several hours.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0942-9352			WOS:000542554000003

Herein, we developed a rutile-structured ruthenium-manganese solid solution oxide with oxygen vacancies (Mn0.73Ru0.27O2-delta) by using an electron-feeding modulation strategy to stabilize the catalyst structure and accelerate the OER kinetics. Due to the optimal electronic structure and enhanced electrical conductivity, the Mn0.73Ru0.27O2-delta catalyst displayed a low overpotential of 208 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, outperforming the benchmark RuO2 and most previously reported noble-metal based OER catalysts. Experimental characterization verified that the electron transfer occurred from Ru to Mn atoms with the bridging O atom, which was further enhanced with the existence of oxygen vacancies. Therefore, the center Ru active sites in an electron-deficient state is favorable for bonding with active oxygen intermediates. Meanwhile, theoretical calculations revealed that the simultaneous incorporation of Mn components and O vacancies significantly decreased the anti-bonding spin states of Ru's d-orbitals, which modulated the adsorption and desorption energy barriers of elementary reactions on the active Ru sites, thus boosting the overall OER kinetics.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000790414900001

Prior to XAFS analyses, the photoelectrochemical water oxidation activities of both cocatalysts were assessed by linear sweep voltammetry, with results demonstrating that the Co-B-i cocatalyst enhances oxygen evolution to a greater degree than the Co-P-i. Co K-edge XAFS spectra were acquired for both cocatalysts on SrTiO3 photoelectrodes during photoelectrochemical water splitting. The XAFS spectrum of the Co-B-i was significantly more intense than that of the Co-Pi, indicating that a greater concentration of the Co-B-i cocatalyst was present on the photoelectrode compared with the Co-P-i. The results of this study demonstrate that both the Co-P-i and Co-B-i cocatalysts are able to efficiently promote water oxidation, and that the Co-B-i functions more effectively than the Co-P-i because it generates a greater abundance of reaction sites.

The yield was 158.1% in air and 96.5% under a nitrogen atmosphere, showing oxygen might be involved in the reaction and that NaNO2 is an oxygen source and cocatalyst in the system.

Typically, the traditional one-step phosphorization route offers limited phase control, with hexagonal phosphide phase structure (Ni2P type). Moreover, the phase component sensitively depends on the metal ratio to a great degree, posing great challenges to synthesize NiCo bimetallic phosphides with tuned composition and phase structure. Herein, we report a carbon encapsulated Ni2+ post-modified CoP nanowire (denoted as Ni-CoP@C) with single orthorhombic CoP phase structure and tuned Ni doping content via a facile & novel in-situ isomorphous-substitution method. More importantly, no any phase separation occurs, also further achieving a high Ni doping content (57 at%) that is less realized previously. As an example application, the as-made Ni-CoP@C nanowire exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability, showing promising potential in the field of water splitting. The present novel strategy will pave the way for further phase controllable fabrication of bi/multi-metal-based materials in catalysis and energy storage & conversion fields.									56	4	0	0	2	0	57			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000474636100016

However, some defects still exist to block the solar utilization efficiency and hydrogen evolution kinetics. Herein, the NiMoO4 semiconductor is combined with a BiVO4 photoanode, for the first time, and excellent PEC performance is achieved on the basis of heterojunction formation and favorable conductivity of NiMoO4. In addition, it has been demonstrated that NiMoO4 promotes the light absorption ability, charge separation efficiency, and surface charge-transfer efficiency comprehensively. To further improve the photoconversion efficiency, cobalt phosphate, as an oxygen evolution reaction cocatalyst, is deposited on the above electrode and achieves a much enhanced utilization efficiency of 1.18%, with a photocurrent density of 5.3 mAcm(-2) at 1.23V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode; this exceeds most results reported to date. This rational and unique photoanode construction provides a new thread for the photoelectrode designation.									63	1	0	0	5	1	63			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000441237800005	29863749

Herein, taking Co4N as a case study, we tune the d-orbital of metallic Co4N nanowires via rapid formation of iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH). Experimental analyses show that FeOOH@Co4N/SSM exhibits excellent HER catalytic activity with considerable low onset overpotential (22 mV), small Tafel slope (34 mV dec(-1)), and excellent stability at current densities ranging from 20 to 100 mA cm(-2). Additionally, theoretical assessments display that the hybridization of Co4N with FeOOH is beneficiary for optimizing and promoting the free energy of H adsorption due to the tuning of d-orbital. An overall water-splitting device assembled based on bifunctional FeOOH@Co4N/SSM delivers an onset potential of 1.48 V with excellent stability up to 4 days. This shows a new strategy for designing a high-performance water-splitting device based on cobalt-based electrocatalysts.									98	6	0	0	5	0	98			1944-8244			WOS:000458347900048	30644716

Ruthenium (Ru)-based catalysts exhibit great po-tential in HER, whereas the extensive application is largely hampered by the insufficient performance and durability at current stage. In addition, understanding and revealing the activity enhancement mechanism of Ru-based catalysts is still very tempting while challenging. Herein, we use the oxygen-rich functional groups of graphene oxide (GO) to adsorb Ru species and in situ generate reduced graphene oxide supported Ru nano-particles (NPs) catalysts by annealing (Ru/rGO-700). Ru/rGO-700 exhibits low overpotential of 26 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in alkaline electrolytes, and simultaneously the strong interaction induced by the Ru-O bond between the support and the anchored Ru NPs endows the catalyst a desirable stability, thus the activity of the catalysts barely decays after 50,000 cycles of durability testing. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the introduction of anionic oxygen leads to the electron-deficient characteristics of Ru NPs, which weakens the Ru-H affinity and accelerates/ or favors water dissociation and hydrogen desorption. In addition, the integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP) confirms that the introduction of electron holes weakens the an-tibonding interactions between Ru atoms, thus the stability of the catalysts is greatly improved.									8	1	0	0	1	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773514800001

To investigate the corrosion mechanism of plutonium with oxygen, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out in the present study to investigate the interaction of plutonium atoms with oxygen molecules. Considering all possible spin states, a comprehensive description of the reaction mechanism is presented. All minima and transition state structures along the reaction pathway are optimized and the interaction energies and equilibrium distances were evaluated. The nature of the Pu-O bonding mode evolution along the reaction pathways was further validated using electron localization function (ELF) calculations, which indicated that the interaction could be considered as an electrostatic interaction in the entrance channel and a strong covalent interaction in the exit channel. We analyzed the density of states (DOS) for the minima and transition states, for the sake of analyzing the contribution of 5f electrons/orbitals in the title reaction. The results indicate that the most of the contributions to the HOMO come from the 5f orbitals of the plutonium atoms. Furthermore, reaction rate constants computed between 298 and 1000 K using variational transition state theory (VTST) suggest that Wigner tunneling effects are generally large for the reactions considered. Additionally, product energy distributions for the title reaction were evaluated by carrying out direct classical trajectory calculations. The results demonstrate that most of the available energy appears as the vibration energy of the products. The outcomes of the current theoretical studies provide detailed insights for understanding the interaction of plutonium with oxygen molecules.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2046-2069			WOS:000406104300058

This is achieved using small nanoparticles. The knowledge of the water-IrO2 nanoparticle interface is of high importance to understand the IrO2 behavior as electrocatalyst in aqueous solutions. In this contribution, DFT (PBE-D2) calculations and AIMD simulations on IrO2 nanoparticle models of different sizes ((IrO2)(33) and (IrO2)(115)) are performed. Results show that two key factors determine the H2O adsorption energy and the preferred adsorption structure (molecular or dissociated water): metal coordination and hydrogen bonding with oxygen bridge atoms of the IrO2 surface. Regarding metal coordination, and since the tetragonal distortion existing in IrO2 is retained on the nanoparticle models, the adsorption at iridium axial vacant sites implies stronger Ir-H2O interactions, which favors water dissociation. In contrast, Ir-H2O interaction at equatorial vacant sites is weaker and thus the relative stability of molecular and dissociated forms becomes similar. Hydrogen bonding increases adsorption energy and favors water dissociation. Thus, tip and corner sites of the nanoparticle, with no oxygen bridge atoms nearby, exhibit the smallest adsorption energies and a preference for the molecular form. Overall, the presence of rather isolated tip and corner sites in the nanoparticle leads to lower adsorption energies and a smaller degree of water dissociation when compared with extended surfaces.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000686301300001	34473817

Significant anodic photocurrent was observed in our epitaxial ferroelectric BiFeO3 films prepared from sputter deposition. Both negative polarization charges and thinner films were found to promote the anodic photocatalytic reaction. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy proved that the conduction and valence band edges of BiFeO3 straddle the water redox levels. Theoretical analyses show that the large switchable polarization can modify the surface properties to promote the hydrogen and oxygen evolutions on the surfaces with positive and negative polarization charges, respectively.

Colloidal synthesis of MoSe2, WSe2 and their hierarchical structures as bifunctional electrocatalysts								Microscopy and Microanalysis				27	suppl.1			670	2		10.1017/S1431927621002786				2021	2021	Summary form only given. Recently LMDs have shown promising results as a non-precious alternative for the electrochemical water splitting reactions. Practically, for efficient water splitting reaction, electrocatalysts should be compatible with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the same medium. Owing to sluggish kinetics for water splitting reaction, OER in alkaline medium is a bottleneck in the process. Theoretical and experimental evidence suggest that edges of the LMDs such as MoS2, MoSe2 are catalytically more active than basal planes. Thus, LMDs as electrochemical catalysts with a large number of exposed edge sites are desired. Similarly, heterostructure engineering with enhanced edge sites can also provide an opportunity to alter the electronic properties and can be a promising strategy to enhance the water-splitting reaction via a synergistic effect. To overcome the low-yield and substrate effect of various synthetic approaches such as CVD, PVD, exfoliation and restacking, facile low-cost, energy-efficient wet chemical methods have been designed. Wet-chemical methods allow for synthesizing substrate-free nanostructures with high-yield, which are desirable for catalysis and sensing applications. However, one-step synthesis of heterostructures through the wet-chemical process is still challenging and tend to form alloyed nanostructures when the precursors are mixed. Herein, using metal precursors with different reactivity towards chalcogen metal, we have designed a synthesis method for MoSe2, WSe2 and hierarchical heterostructure Mose2@WSe2 through one-step colloidal synthesis. As-synthesized nanostructures have flower morphology with large number of exposed edges, desired for electrocatalysis. As-synthesized nanostructures have been used for the complete water-splitting reaction in an alkaline medium. The overpotential at current density 10 mA/cm2 for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction requires only 148 mV and 30 mV positive as compared to commercial Pt/C and RuO2, respectively. Owing to the reactivity difference of the metal ion precursor (W and Mo) towards the chalcogen, our reaction scheme was extended to synthesize hierarchical heterostructures. However, due to negligible lattice mismatch between MoSe2 and WSe2, the distinction between alloy or hierarchical heterostructure through SAED and HRTEM micrograph is difficult. To check the distribution of Mo, W and Se, STEM-EDS mapping was performed. Se is uniformly distributed throughout the nanostructure; however, Mo and W show phase segregation. Mo being rich in the core, and W is predominantly present in theouter sheets.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1431-9276			INSPEC:20807934

Conservation of distantly related membrane proteins: Photosynthetic reaction centers share a common structural core								MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				23	11			2001	2007		10.1093/molbev/msl079				NOV 2006	2006	Photosynthesis was established on Earth more than 3 billion years ago. All available evidences suggest that the earliest photosynthetic organisms were anoxygenic and that oxygen-evolving photosynthesis is a more recent development. The reaction center complexes that form the heart of the energy storage process are integral membrane pigment proteins that span the membrane in vectorial fashion to carry out electron transfer. The origin and extent of distribution of these proteins has been perplexing from a phylogenetic point of view mostly because of extreme sequence divergence. A series of integral membrane proteins of known structure and varying degrees of sequence identity have been compared using combinatorial extension-Monte Carlo methods. The proteins include photosynthetic reaction centers from proteobacteria and cyanobacterial photosystems I and II, as well as cytochrome oxidase, bacteriorhodopsin, and cytochrome b. The reaction center complexes show a remarkable conservation of the core structure of 5 transmembrane helices, strongly implying common ancestry, even though the residual sequence identity is less than 10%, whereas the other proteins have structures that are unrelated. A relationship of sequence with structure was derived from the reaction center structures; with characteristic decay length of 1.6 angstrom. Phylogenetic trees derived from the structural alignments give insights into the earliest photosynthetic reaction center, strongly suggesting that it was a homodimeric complex that did not evolve oxygen.									84	0	1	0	72	0	88			0737-4038	1537-1719		WOS:000241094700003	16887904

However, the overall electrochemical water splitting is limited by the low efficiency of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) leading to a high overpotential. In this study, finely dispersed cobalt particles supported on graphene are prepared as an anodic catalyst and coupled with phosphate activation to enhance and stabilize OER activity. The small particles enable a high exposure of the surface active sites. Also, the highly conductive graphene backbone accelerates electron transport. Activation by phosphate in the electrolyte leads to the formation of the active Co(iii) species with enriched oxygen vacancies meanwhile facilitating the kinetics. The finely dispersed cobalt particles supported on graphene together with phosphate activation lead to high electrochemical surface area and intrinsic activity, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 0.35 V and a low Tafel slope of 45 mV per decade, together with good stability. The cobalt mass based current density is 19-8000 times higher than current benchmarking catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000618190800026

However, in 5 M HCl, the activation-passivation transition occurs, and the cathodic reaction is mainly related to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) controlled by the Volmer reaction.

Here, we report the electronic modulation of iridium oxides through the introduction of molybdenum to boost the OER performance in an acidic electrolyte. Remarkably, the prepared iridium-molybdenum oxide (IrMoOx) nanofibers with a low crystallinity through an electrospinningcalcination strategy show a superior OER activity in an acidic electrolyte with a low overpotential of 267 mV at 10 mA cm-2 compared with bare IrOx (333 mV) and MoOx (almost no OER activity) as well as the benchmark commercial IrO2 catalyst (330 mV). Furthermore, the IrMoOx nanofibers catalyst exhibits an excellent long-term stability with a slight degradation of the current density after 30 h because of the strong electronic interactions between IrOx and MoOx components. Furthermore, an overall water splitting device assembled with IrMoOx and Pt/C as electrodes delivers a cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and desirable long-term stability, much better than Pt/C||IrO2 electrolyzer (1.66 V). This work offers a simple and efficient route to fabricate metal oxide-based electrocatalysts with bimetallic active sites, presenting a synergistic enhanced OER performance at a low pH circumstance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000795080400002

Here, inexpensive trimolybdenum phosphide (Mo3P) nanoparticles with an exceptional activity-ORR and OER current densities of 7.21 and 6.85 mA cm(-2) at 2.0 and 4.2 V versus Li/Li+, respectively-in an oxygen-saturated non-aqueous electrolyte are reported. The Tafel plots indicate remarkably low charge transfer resistance-Tafel slopes of 35 and 38 mV dec(-1) for ORR and OER, respectively-resulting in the lowest ORR overpotential of 4.0 mV and OER overpotential of 5.1 mV reported to date. Using this catalyst, a Li-air battery cell with low discharge and charge overpotentials of 80 and 270 mV, respectively, and high energy efficiency of 90.2% in the first cycle is demonstrated. A long cycle life of 1200 is also achieved for this cell. Density functional theory calculations of ORR and OER on Mo3P (110) reveal that an oxide overlayer formed on the surface gives rise to the observed high ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity and small discharge/charge overpotentials.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000587679900001	33169392

Then cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)(2)) was deposited on the surface of SSG through a convenient microwave-polyol method. The resulting electrode (Co(OH)(2)/SSG-FGS) exhibited remarkable catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution, which was closely related with the unique structural advantage of the composite electrode. The self-supporting structure of Co(OH)(2)/SSG-FGS possessed the current collector and provided conducting channels for Co(OH)(2) particles, enabling fast electron transfer from Co(OH)(2) active sites along SSG to the FGS current collector and enhancing the catalytic performance of Co(OH) (2)/SSG-FGS for OER. Therefore, the Co(OH)(2)/SSG-FGS just required an overpotential of 140 mV to achieving 10mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH solution, which even surpassed the commercial RuO2 catalyst. Additionally, the excellent stability of Co(OH)(2)/SSG-FGS highlighted its efficiency and made it preferable as an efficient catalyst for OER. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, the welldesigned RuCoP nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped polyhedron carbon (RuCoP@CN) composite is fabricated by in-situ carbonization of Co based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) and phosphorization. Ru-substituted phosphate is proved to be imperative for the electrochemical activity and stability of individual catalysts, which can efficiently yield the active electronic states and promote the intrinsic OER and HER activity. As a result, a current density of 10 mA cm-2 is achieved at a cell voltage as low as 1.60 V when the RuCoP@CN electrocatalyst applied for the overall water splitting, which is superior to the reported RuO2 and Pt/C couple electrode (1.64 V).

Inspired by recent experiments of hybridizing MXenes with carbon materials, here we theoretically design a series of heterostructures of N-doped graphene supported by MXene monolayers as bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Our first-principles calculations show that the graphitic sheet on V2C and Mo2C MXenes are highly active with an ORR overpotential down to 0.36 V and reaction free energies for the HER approaching zero, both with low kinetic barriers. Such outstanding catalytic activities originate from the electronic coupling between the graphitic sheet and the MXene, and can be correlated with the pz band center of surface carbon atoms and the work function of the heterostructures. Our findings screen a novel form of highly active electrocatalysts by taking advantage of the fast charge transfer kinetics and strong interfacial coupling of MXenes, and illuminate a universal mechanism for modulating the catalytic properties of two-dimensional hybrid materials.									171	19	0	0	6	0	173			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000435358600007	29616270

Herein, for the first time, we developed a facile strategy to design a three-dimensional flower-like cobalt nickel phosphate as such an electrocatalyst. The cobalt nickel phosphate was directly supported on Ni foam ((Co0.5Ni0.5)(3)(PO4)(2)/Ni) via a simple two-step hydrothermal method. This method offers several advantages including low cost, facile synthesis and binder-free. Benefiting from its three-dimensional flower-like nanostructure with a big specific surface, high conductivity and the synergic effect of metal ions are the as-synthesized (Co0.5Ni0.5)(3)(PO4)(2)/Ni reveals excellent oxygen evolution reaction activity in alkaline electrolyte. It exhibits a low overpotential of 273 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 59.3 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH. Notably, the (Co0.5Ni0.5)(3)(PO4)(2)/Ni also operates efficiently in 30 wt% KOH, capable of affording an anodic current of 10 mA cm(-2) at a lower overpotential of 246 mV and retains its catalytic performance for at least 30 h.									35	2	0	0	1	0	35			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000415281400043

Focusing on this topic, electrocatalytic oxidation reactions including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) are highly attractive, which could be involved as efficient anodic reactions to couple the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) more efficiently. Currently, abundant transition metal-based catalysts have been explored for OER and UOR, while few bifunctional catalysts with versatile application range are reported, and the current activity and operational stability are still unsatisfied. Herein, we proposed a self-sacrificial templated route to fabricate uniform CuFe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocubes grown on Cu(OH)2 nanoarrays as efficient pre-catalysts for both OER and UOR catalysis. After undergoing a pre-oxidation process with substantial accumulation of the active species, highly efficient and ultrastable electro-oxidation behavior can be achieved for promoted OER and UOR. Typically, an ultralow onset potential of 1.423 V vs. RHE with high catalytic current density can be achieved for OER, and an ultralow potential of 1.248 V vs. RHE is required for the optimized catalyst to achieve a 10 mA cm-2 UOR current density. Of note, over 300 h and 150 h stable current can be realized for OER and UOR, accompanied by dramatic increment of the activities. The discovery of the PBA-based pre-catalysts and the investigation of the pre-oxidation process could give useful guidance for future designing of advanced catalysts for the electro-oxidation reactions.									25	1	0	0	2	0	25			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000693417600005

The oxygen evolution in acid over noble catalysts remains its capital cost, hence which impedes it from being deployed. Semiconductor TiO2 was randomly examined in 2D film electrode but is rarely investigated in state-of-the-art 3D porous electrode using Nafion(R) binder due to the incapability of electrochemical window. Here we demonstrate mesoporous TiO2 for oxygen evolution which is synthesized by gliding arc plasma. Our mesoporous TiO2 (mT, mTc) catalysts outperform commercial TiO2 (cT), in terms of the decrease of 800 mV in onset potential, 13.4 times current at the approximate starting potential (of Tafel slope region), 4.7 times current (of overall reaction rate) at 2.652 V vs RHE. Of interest the rationale behind the remarkable activity is the nature of the electrode-solution interface, which is triple phase boundary (TPB), revealed by inherent parameters of solution resistance R (s) and double-layer capacitance C (d). Both R (s) and the fraction in voltage drop of resistance and capacitance ( f (Rs), f (Cd)), are consistent with apparent parameters such as ionomer/catalyst ratio (I/C), catalyst, and activity. The suitable electrochemical potential window allows semiconductor TiO2 in 3D porous electrode examined. More importantly, the inherent parameters are disclosed to correlate with the TPB, which provides electrochemistry and plasma communities with such new insights.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000693766300001

The film formation of solid iodine acts as a negative nonlinear feedback slowing down the iodide oxidation due to its poor conductivity, and oxygen evolution as a positive nonlinear feedback by destroying the iodine film mechanically and by promoting its dissolution through convection mainly via a disproportional reaction. Based on the results of electrochemical experiments and in situ Raman spectroscopy, a tentative mechanism is given concerning the interfacial phase transitions and the disproportional reaction.

In searching for advanced catalysts, it is equally important to fundamentally understand working mechanism and be able to rationally design and manipulate catalytic sites. Starting from the density functional theory (DFT) calculations as a guidance, our theoretical model revealed that chromium substitution in nickel-iron hydroxides (Ni1-xFex(OH)(2)) not only accelerated the charge transfer but also regulated the adsorption energy of OER intermediates to achieve optimal binding strength. Experimentally, chromium was doped into the laminate of Ni1-xFex(OH)(2), resulting in the enhanced catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction, which confirmed the predictions from the theoretical data. The porous and ultra-thin ternary Ni1-x-yFexCry(OH)(2) electrocatalysts were grown directly on a nickel foam (NF) substrate, with an optimum composition Ni0.66Fe0.27Cr0.07(OH)(2)/NF identified, which exhibited a superior OER performance, i.e., achieving a significant current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 231 mV, a small Tafel slope (31 mV dec(-1)) and an excellent stability at a highly oxidative potential of 1.68 V vs RHE in alkaline electrolyte. The comprehensive study involving both theoretical and experimental results in this work provides an insightful guidance in designing efficient OER catalysts for chemical and electrical energy conversion and storage.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000573943100002

Herein, we present a convenient method to synthesize Co-Cu hollow nanoprisms after wrapping and calcining with trithiocyanuric acid (C3H3N3S3) (denoted N-Co-Cu-S-x HNs). The results showed that Cu doping modified the charge density of Co center, leading to the enhancement of the intrinsic activity of the Co3S4 active center, meanwhile wrapping trithiocyanuric acid on the sur-faces and calcinating to form N-containing C skeleton as a flexible substrate to encapsulate the catalysts, which effectively protected the active sites inside the catalysts. Notably, the OER catalyst that was opti-mized by adjusting the metal ratio and controlling the trithiocyanuric acid incorporation exhibited a low overpotential of 306 mV under a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and showed a superior durability of more than 27 h.

However, there is still serious lack of valid approaches to further enhance their catalytic performance. Herein, we propose a spin state modulation strategy to improve the OER electrocatalytic activity of typical perovskite material of LaCoO3. Specifically, the electronic configuration transition was realized by a simple high temperature thermal reduction process. M-H hysteresis loop results reveal that the reduction treatment can produce more unpaired electrons in 3d orbit by promoting the electron transitions of Co from low spin state to high spin state, and thus lead to the increase of the spin polarization. Electrochemical measurements show that the catalytic performance of LaCoO3 is strongly dependent on its electronic configuration. With the optimized reduction treatment, the overpotential for the OER process in 0.5 M KOH electrolyte solution at 10 mA cm(-2) current density was 396 mV, significantly lower than that of the original state. Furthermore, it can mediate efficient OER with an overpotential of 383 mV under an external magnetic field, which is attributed to the appropriate electron filling. Our results show that electron spin state regulation is a new way to boost the OER electrocatalytic activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000753947400001	35147254

However, the as-synthesized TMDs are usually chemically inert because of their perfect atomic structure and inaccessible interlayer space for electrolytes. Herein, we activate 2D palladium diselenide (PdSe2) for catalysing the oxygen reduction reaction using a controllable electrochemical intercalation process. The electrochemically activated PdSe2 exhibits greatly enhanced electrocatalytic activities such as a doubled current density, 250 mV positive shift of potential, 5 times smaller Tafel slope, and greatly improved stability. DFT calculations were employed to study the mechanisms of electrochemical activation. Complementary experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the significantly increased activities come from (1) the activated surface with enriched Se vacancies and chemically bonded oxygen, and (2) easy access of the interlayer space for reaction intermediates. Furthermore, the robustness of the Pd-Se bonding ensures high structural stability and excellent resistance to degradation.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5				2052-1537		WOS:000649424700001

Here, a highly active and durable cactus-like nanoparticle with an exposed heterointerface between the IrO2 and the low oxidation state Ru by introducing a trace amount of Mn dopant is reported. The heterostructure fabrication relies on initial mixing of the Ru and Ir phases before electrochemical oxidation to produce a conjoined Ru/IrO2 heterointerface. Benefitting from electron transfer at the heterointerface, the low oxidation state Ru species shows excellent initial activity, which is maintained even after 180 h of continuous OER test. In a half-cell test, the Mn-doped RuIr nanocactus (Mn-RuIr NCT) achieves a mass activity of 1.85 A mg(Ir+Ru)(-1) at 1.48 V-RHE, which is 139-fold higher than that of commercial IrO2. Moreover, the superior electrocatalytic performance of Mn-RuIr NCT in the PEM electrolysis system ensures its viability in practical uses. The results of the excellent catalytic performance for acidic OER indicate that the heterostructuring robust rutile IrO2 and the highly active Ru species with a low oxidation state on the catalyst surface drive a synergistic effect.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2366-9608			WOS:000719618400001	35041273

The 3D nickel arrays are strongly anchored on the substrate, forming self-supported electrocatalysts with reinforced structural stability and high electrical conductivity. Because of their increased active surface area, abundant channels for electron/ion transportation and enhanced electronic conductivity, the designed 3D nickel arrays exhibit superior electrocatalytic OER performance with a low overpotential (496 mV at 50 mA cm(-2)) and a small Tafel slope (43 mV dec(-1)) as well as long-term stability (no decay after 24 h) in alkaline solution.

In this study, we used a simple strategy to deposit a nickel iron layered double hydroxide (NiFeLDH) onto cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanowires. The cobalt oxide nanowires are covered with thin nanosheets of NiFeLDH forming a core shell structure. The Co3O4 nanowires contain the mixed oxidation states of Co2+ and Co3+, and the surface modification of Co3O4 nanowires has shown synergetic effects due to there being more oxygen defects, catalytic sites, and enhanced electronic conductivity. Further, the core shell structure of Co3O4 nanowires demonstrated a bifunctional activity for water splitting in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. From the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a current density of 10 mA cm - 2 is achieved at a potential of - 0.303 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Meanwhile for the case of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a current density of 40 mA cm - 2 is measured at a potential of 1.49 V vs. RHE. Also, this electrocatalyst has shown a considerable long- term stability of 15 h for both the HER and the OER. Importantly, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has shown that the NiFeLDH integration onto cobalt oxide exhibited around 3 fold decrease of charge transfer resistance for both the HER and the OER in comparison with pristine cobalt oxide films, which reveals an excellent electrocatalytic activity for both faradaic processes. All these results confirm that the proposed electrocatalyst can be integrated into an efficient water splitting system.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000470710300013

In this work, by growing amorphous multi-transition-metal (cobalt and iron) oxide on two-dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP), we develop a bifunctional electrocatalyst (CoFeO@BP), which is able to efficiently catalyze both HER and OER. The overpotentials for the hybrid CoFeO@BP catalyst to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)in 1 mKOH are 88 and 266 mV for HER and OER, respectively. Based on a series of ex-situ and in situ investigations, the excellent catalytic performance of CoFeO@BP is found to result from the adaptive surface structure under reduction and oxidation potentials. CoFeO@BP can be transformed to CoFe phosphide under reduction potential, in situ generating the real active catalyst for HER.									81	6	0	0	2	0	81			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000567863900001	32767438

Herein, cobalt and nitrogen codoped ultrathin porous carbon nanosheet (Co-N-PCN) is developed by directly carbonizing the graphene oxide sandwiched cobalt ion adsorbed polyaniline-co-polypyrrole (PACP) precursors. The nitrogen-rich PACP favors the formation of abundant Co-N-x-C active species, while the 2D ultrathin nanosheet structure ensures the high exposure of the generated Co-N-x-C active sites to the electrolyte. In addition, the sandwiched graphene acts as the conductive backbone to facilitate fast charge transfer and enhance the electrode conductivity. Benefiting from the synergistic effect, the Co-N-PCN presents superior electrocatalytic properties with low overpotentials and favorable kinetics to Pt and RuO2 as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER. Remarkably, the potential difference of OER and ORR (Delta E= E-j=10 - E-1/2) is as low as 0.81 V in 0.1 M KOH, indicating the Co-N-PCN outperforms most of the previously reported bifunctional electrocatalysts.

Herein, a mesoporous hierarchical flake arrays (FAs) structure grown on flexible carbon cloth, integrated with the microsized nitrogen-doped carbon (N-doped C) FAs, nanoscaled P-doped CoSe2 hollow clusters and atomic-level P-doping (P-CoSe2/N-C FAs) is described. The P-CoSe2/N-C FAs thus developed exhibit a reduced overpotential (approximate to 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and large half-wave potential (0.87 V) for oxygen reduction reactions. The excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance is ascribed to the synergy among the hierarchical flake arrays controlled at both micro- and nanoscales, and atomic-level P-doping. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the free energy for the potential-limiting step is reduced by P-doping for OER. An all-solid-state zinc-air battery made of the P-CoSe2/N-C FAs as the air-cathode presents excellent cycling stability and mechanical flexibility, demonstrating the great potential of the hierarchical P-CoSe2/N-C FAs for advanced bifunctional electrocatalysis.									150	8	0	0	6	0	150			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000446155700028

Electrochemical Methane Activation and Conversion to Oxygenates at Room Temperature								ECS Transactions				53	23			1	20		10.1149/05323.0001ecst				2013	2013	Methane was electrochemically activated at room temperature to oxygenates using CO32- as an oxygen-donating species over a NiOZrO2 bifunctional electrocatalyst. Products identified from this activation using Mass Spectrometry and 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy include CH3OH, HCHO, CO, HCOO-, C2H5OH, H3CCOO-, C3H8O, and C3H6O. In addition, O2 and CO2 were also observed as products resulting from carbonate electrolysis and/or the oxygen evolution reaction. Methane was adsorbed and activated by NiO while CO32- was adsorbed onto non-conducting ZrO2. Oxygen was then abstracted and donated from CO32- to electrocatalytically active sites to form new C-O or O-H bonds. Twoand three-carbon species were formed via a C=O bond resonance mechanism which facilitated new C-C bond formation.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1938-6737			INSPEC:14309828

The Fe-doping can greatly enhance the catalytic activity of Co/Fe-MOF, which presents much smaller overpotentials and Tafel slopes than the monometallic Co-MOF in 1.0 M KOH solution, and remarkable durability that superior to the corresponding commercial catalysts of PVC and RuO2 for both of the two processes. Impressively, the OER activity of Co/Fe-MOF is comparable to the RuO2 and even higher a current densities (>= 10 mA m(-2)). An electrolyzer by employing the Co/Fe-MOF modified Ni foam as cathode and anode was assembled, which shows better performance and durability for overall water splitting than the system built from PVC and RuO2.

Herein, the surface reconstruction of NiFeP and underlying dynamic Ni(OH)2-NiOOH transformation are characterized under electro-anodic HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR). The Ni(OH)2-NiOOH/ NiFeP heterojunction presents extraordinary HMFOR performance and produces FDCA with a yield over 99% and a Faradaic efficiency over 94%. The reconstructed NiOOH is suggested to chemically (not electrochemically) oxidize HMF while itself is reduced back to Ni(OH)2; The applied anodic potential then drives the oxidation of Ni (OH)2 to NiOOH, to circlize the HMF oxidation process. Meanwhile, the deeper oxidation of NiOOH to NiO(OH)2 or beyond can drive the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, a NiOOH-centered dual-circle mechanism is unraveled to understand the entangled and competitive HMFOR and OER, which will be helpful to design better HMFOR electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000803622500002

Herein, we demonstrate Ni-Fe layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs) nanosheets as highly active OER catalysts, which are synthesized by a facile, scalable and template free method. The ordered nanosheets structure of NiFe-LDHs with Fe contents from 0 to 25% was obtained at low temperature with precisely controlled the pH value by complexation-precipitation process. Compared with 20% commercial Ir/C, the obtained sample with 15% Fe exhibits superior catalytic performance in 1 mol L-1 KOH solution. Its overpotential and Tafel slope are, 216 mV and 37 mV dec(-1), lower than that of 20% Ir/C (330 mV and 130 mV dec(-1)) respectively at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, it also exhibits superior stability and durability to 20% Ir/C in 15 h galvanostatic polarization experiments. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The direct growth of Co(OH)(2) on nickel foam (NF) [Co(OH)(2)/NF)] makes this an effective bifunctional catalyst-electrode pair for water splitting with high activity and excellent stability. The Co(OH)(2)/NF electrode exhibits an overpotential of 182 mV (112 mV dec(-1)) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 281 mV (88 mV dec(-1)) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (without iR correction). Co(OH)(2)/NF displays long-term durability (150 h) with a low potential loss of 3.1 and 3.4% for HER and OER, respectively. The active bifunctional Co(OH)(2)/NF-electrode pair assists in constructing a water electrolyzer that affords 10 mA cm(-2)@1.66 V. Co(OH)(2)/NF//Co(OH)(2)/NF exhibits high stability (over 150 h) with 4.1% potential loss. The earth abundant nonprecious-metal-based electrode [Co(OH)(2)/NF] and the solar cell structure afforded continuous evolution of hydrogen and oxygen (@1.65 V), which can be projected to allow for low-cost, large-scale hydrogen generation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000819238300001

The efficiency of water-splitting is largely restricted by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we developed a two-step method to prepare 3D porous material through chemical vapor deposition and electrodeposition combined with the first-principles calculations. Ultrathin alpha-Co(OH) (2) nanosheets grown on the combined substrate of N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) and nickel foam were fabricated to investigate their electro-chemical behaviour. Because of the characteristics of the ultrathin, microporous alpha-Co(OH)(2) and its derivatives, the 3D Co(OH)(2)@NCNTs@NF exhibits outstanding performance as a bifunctional catalyst for water-splitting. The overpotentials to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 1 M KOH for OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are 270 mV and 170 mV, respectively. The as-prepared material exhibits superior stability, which generate 10 mA cm(-2) current density in overall water-splitting over 600 h without obvious degradation in 1 M KOH at voltage of 1.72 V vs. RHE. The first-principles calculations reveal that the N-doping not only can effectively enhance the interaction between the substrate and active material (CoOOH), but also modulate the electronic structure of CoOOH to speed up the O-2 releasing during the OER.									95	5	0	0	2	0	95			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000430057000012

Exploiting cost-efficient OER electrocatalytic materials to improve the performance of overall water splitting is necessary. Partial chemical etching of iron foam (IF) with glacial acetic acid, using IF as the metal source and substrate, to form vertically aligned FeS/Fe2O3 heterogeneous nanosheets on the IF (FeS/Fe2O3/IF) can obtain a hierarchical electrode to meet the above requirements. The nanosheets with heterogeneous interfaces in situ grown on IF can adjust electronic structure and expose more active sites, resulting in great improvement of catalytic activity and stability. FeS/Fe2O3/IF requires a small overpotential of 266.5 mV to attain 10 mA cm-2 and its Tafel slope is 51.17 mV dec-1. It is worth noting that FeS/Fe2O3/IF can work continuously for 50 h at high current density, which proves the strong stability during the OER process. The FeS/Fe2O3/IF has high electrocatalytic activity and stability, and can be used as a good candidate material for electrocatalytic OER in industrial manufacture.

Herein, a novel bifunctional hybrid catalyst of hortensia-like MnO2 synergized with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (MnO2/CNTs) is controllably synthesized by reasonably designing the crystal structure and morphology as well as electronic arrangement. On the basis of these strategies, the hybrid accelerates the reaction kinetics and avoids the change of structures. As expected, MnO2/CNTs exhibit a remarkable ORR and OER activity [low ORR Tafel slope: 71 mV dec(-1), low OER Tafel slope: 67 mV dec(-1), and small potential difference (Delta E): 0.85 V] and a long-term stability, which should be attributed to its unique morphology, K+ ions in the 2 x 2 tunnels, and synergistic effect between MnO2 and CNTs. Notably, in zinc-air batteries (ZABs), aluminum-air batteries (AABs), and magnesium air batteries (MABs), the composite shows high power density (ZABs: 243 mW cm(-2), AABs: 530 mW cm(-2), and MABs: 614 mW cm(-2)) and large specific capacities (793 mA h g(zn)(-1), 918 mA h g(Al)(-1), and 878 mA h g(Mg)(-1)). Importantly, the rechargeable ZABs reveal small charge-discharge voltage drop (0.81 V) and strong cycle durability (500 h), which are better than the noble-metal Pt/C + IrO2 mixture catalyst (the voltage drop: 1.15 V at first and 2 V after 100 h). These superior performances together with the simple synthetic method of the hybrid reveal great promise in large-power energy storage and conversion equipment.									51	3	0	0	2	0	51			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000455561200059	30525371

Here, we report a facile one-step blending approach to synthesize efficient and durable OER electrocatalysts of silver decorated hydroxides (Ag@hydroxides). The general efficacy of this methodology is demonstrated in five hydroxides, in form of powders or selfsupported electrodes. The decoration of Ag lowers the overpotentials by 41-56 mV, rendering Ag@NiFe LDH among the most active OER catalysts. It requires an overpotential of 246 mV only to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Under industrial electrolysis conditions (30 wt% KOH and 80 degrees C), the cell voltage is 1.76 V for 500 mA cm-2. It is 270 mV lower than the intact nickel mesh, corresponding to a 9% improvement in the energy conversion efficiency. Furthermore, by combining spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculation we unravel that the strong interfacial charge transfer is the root cause for the promoting catalytic activity, where the binding energies of catalytic intermediates are optimized. This work provides a facile and ease-to-scale-up approach for the synthesis of efficient and durable electrocatalysts and demonstrates the power of regulating the interface in improving electrocatalytic kinetics.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000799815000003

Here, we report direct photoelectrochemical (PEC) experimental proof that the injection of plasmonic hot holes depends on the size of the metallic nanostructures. PEC results clearly indicate that a plasmonic template with smaller Au nanoprisms exhibits higher external and internal quantum efficiencies, leading to a significant enhancement of both oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions. We verified that these outcomes stemmed from the enhanced hot hole generation with higher energy and transfer efficiency driven by enhanced field confinement. These findings provide a facile strategy by which futuristic photocatalysis and solar energy conversion applications based on plasmonic hot holes can be expedited.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			2380-8195			WOS:000639063800014

The crystal phase and microstructure features of the products were characterized in detail by using some characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction(XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and N-2 adsorption-desorption measurement and so on. The in situ surface chemical etching process under hydrothermal conditions leads to the generation of Ni3S2 nanowires 3D network that binds to NF firmly with relatively low interfacial resistances. In an aqueous electrolyte of 1 mol.L-1 KOH, the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of the obtained electrodes was tested by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), chronopotentiometry, and electrochemical impedance test (EIS). At a ultrathigh current density of 100 mA.cm(-2), Fe2O3@Ni3S2/NF electrode showed a low OER overpotential of only 223 mV, which was 285 mV lower than that of Ni3S2/NF electrode (before growth of Fe2O3). These excellent properties are attributed to the faster reaction kinetics and smaller charge transfer impedance of Fe2O3@Ni3S2/NF electrode comparing with Ni3S2/NF.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1001-4861			WOS:000684063200010

Here, we studied low-Ir-content, highly active, double perovskites (Sr2MIrO6, M = Ni, Co, Sc and Fe) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid combining electrochemical experiments, DFT, and advanced characterization techniques. The initial OER performance depends on Ir's oxidation state and the geometric features of IrO6 frameworks, which are tuned by the choice of M. Higher oxidation states, particularly Ir6+, enhance the OER activity: Sr2NiIrO6 and Sr2CoIrO6 display potentials of similar to 1.53 V at 10 mA cm(-2), comparable to the best Ir-based catalysts in the literature. However, because of their less symmetric structures, perovskites with Ir6+ are less stable, prone to surface reconstruction and their cations leach under OER conditions. These results show that improved iridium-based OER electrocatalysts in acid can be designed by balancing their activity and stability.									17	1	0	0	1	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000616679700041

Delithiated Li1-xNiO2 was thermally decomposed to a spinel phase (Fd3m) at around 220 degreesC. For x less than or equal to 0.5, Li1-xNiO2 was decomposed to LiNiO2 and LiNi2O4 and the fraction of the spinel in the decomposed product increased almost linearly with x. For x > 0.5, Li1-xNiO2 was converted into the spinel and this reaction was accompanied by oxygen evolution. On further heating, delithiated Li1-xNiO2 of all compositions turned into a rock salt phase (Fm3m) with NiO structure. The temperature for the decomposition of Li1-xNiO2 to a spinel was independent of x, however, the temperature for the decomposition to a rock salt phase decreased with increasing x. The thermal behavior of Li1-xNiO2 could be interpreted as an overlap of the exothermic rearrangement of nickel and lithium cations to form a spinel or a rock salt phase and the endothermic oxygen evolution reaction.

Herein, we report a novel, simple and one-pot method to fabricate ultrafinely dispersed Co-CoOx nanoparticles encapsulated in a nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (denoted as Co-CoOx/CN) via an efficient thermal condensation of d-glucosamine hydrochloride, melamine and Co(NO3)(2)center dot H2O. A well-designed Co-CoOx based hybrid that possesses high activity and excellent durability for the OER and HER in alkaline solution has been fabricated. The catalyst displays good stability for 30,000 s and small Tafel slope of 82 mV per decade for OER and 110 mV per decade for HER. Detailed electrochemical and physical studies indicate that the high OER and HER activity of the hybrid catalyst arises from the strong interaction between Co-based NPs and N-doped carbon nanotubes, and especially the synergistic effect of Co and cobalt oxide.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000435588600006

Extensive studies have been carried out in last two decades to replace state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts by efficient transition metal based materials. Transition metal salts, organometallic compounds, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), polyoxometallates (POMs) etc. have been explored as the precursors for the materials synthesis. In this respect, Prussian blue (PB) and Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) attain special interest as the precursors of the materials due to their facile, robust and cost effective synthesis, highly porous structure and designed morphology. Moreover, PBAs can be prepared with multi-metal system, core-shell and hollow structure. A series of materials have been synthesized by employing PB or PBA with tailorable properties like exposed facets, porous structure, high electrochemical surface area, improved electron transport and accessible catalytic sites. These materials are found to produce excellent electrochemical activity for oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction as well as overall water splitting. In this review, we have focused on the recent progress in PB and PBA derived materials describing their synthesis, diverse architecture, morphology and enhanced electrochemical performances. The major achievements and challenges related to PB and PBA derived materials for the energy conversion have been discussed with the direction of possible future advancement. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, Ni/NiTiO3 with a villiform structure assembled by nanosheets is presented as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst. The Ni/NiTiO3 with a molar ratio of 15 : 1 (Ni : Ti) manifests remarkable catalytic performance for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solutions, with onset overpotentials of 270 mV for the OER and similar to 50 mV for the HER. Large amounts of Ni nanoparticles inset in the NiTiO3 nanosheets possess a high specific surface of 28.4 m(2) g(-1) which is far greater than that of bare Ni (7.7 m(2) g(-1)). The results of long-term OER operation confirm that the introduction of Ti4+ is favorable for enhanced stability. When the catalyst is employed as both the cathode and anode for overall water splitting, it displays an onset potential of 1.55 V in 1 M KOH solution which can rival that of the integrated performance of Pt/C and RuO2. Hence, our Ni/NiTiO3 electrocatalysts have enormous potential for realistic large-scale water splitting.									37	2	0	0	0	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000417063200026

In recent studies, either a synergistic effect on multimetallic catalysts or spin polarization in ferromagnetic materials is considered as a desirable way to improve water electrolysis. Herein, the OER performance of amorphous FeNiCo-based multimetallic catalysts with adjustable composition was investigated from the perspective of atomic structure. Mossbauer spectra results demonstrate that the OER activities exhibit a significant dependence on the local structure of catalysts in which a catalyst with a high content of Fe clusters of low coordination numbers tends to obtain higher activity. Furthermore, benefiting from the spin polarization of these ferromagnetic catalysts, the OER activity is notably enhanced in the presence of a magnetic field. In particular, overpotential reduction exceeding 20 mV (above 100 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline OER performance is observed for strong ferromagnetic catalysts in comparison with the weak ferromagnetic ones. An increment of 65.2% in turnover frequency is achieved for the catalyst with the strongest ferromagnetism. This magnetic enhancement strategy affords an effective way of improving the water oxidation performance on amorphous ferromagnetic catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000757938100001	35171561

Manganese oxide (MnOx) nanoparticles were synthesized on oxygen- and nitrogen-functionalized carbon nanotubes (OCNTs and NCNTs) by calcination in air of Mn-impregnated CNTs with a loading of 10 wt% Mn. The calcined samples were exposed to reducing conditions by thermal treatment in H-2 or NH3, and to strongly oxidizing conditions using HNO3 vapor, which enabled us to flexibly tune the oxidation state of Mn from 2+ in MnO to 4+ in MnO2. The samples were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and temperature-programmed reduction. The oxidation state of Mn was more easily changed in the MnOx/NCNTs samples compared with the MnOx/OCNTs amples. Furthermore, the reduction of MnO2 to MnO occurred in one-step on NCNTs, whereas Mn2O3 intermediate states were observed for OCNTs. STEM and TEM images revealed a smaller and uniform dispersion of the MnOx nanoparticles on NCNTs as compared to OCNTs. Electrocatalytic oxygen evolution tests in 0.1 M KOH showed that Mn in high oxidation states, specifically 4+ as in MnO2 generated by HNO3 vapor treatment, is more active than Mn in lower oxidation states, using the potential at 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slopes as the performance metrics.									29	0	0	0	1	0	29			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000406089200037	28678247

In this article, highly efficient MOF-based photoelectrocatalysts (MOF-5 and amine-functionalized MOF (NH2-MOF-5)) have been synthesized at room temperature and have been successfully characterized. For the photoelectrochemical studies, working electrodes are prepared by coating the synthesized photoelectrocatalysts on Ni-foam. All the synthesized materials have been successfully characterized via powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, elemental mapping, and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. Photoelectrochemical measurements for oxygen evolution reaction are performed via cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry. It has been observed that among all the synthesized catalysts, Co3O4@NH2-MOF-5/NF has emerged as an efficient, stable, and highly active photoelectrocatalyst towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as compared to all other synthesized catalysts. It requires just 223 mV overpotential to deliver the 10 mA cm(-2) current density and exhibits the lowest Tafel slope 52 mV dec(-1) as compared to all other synthesized samples and some of the previously reported catalysts. Furthermore, long-term catalytic stability is studied via continuous linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometric measurements.

A three-dimensional NiFe layered double hydroxides nanowire/nanoporous Ni interlayer/nickel foam substrate (NiFe-LDH/Ni/NF) electrocatalyst was designed and prepared on NF by a polystyrene (PS) microsphere template and a two-step in situ electrodeposition method.

In NiFe-LDHs/Ni/NF, the nickel nanoporous interlayer bonded closely with the NF matrix and simultaneously became loaded with the NiFe-LDH nanowires, which accelerated the electron transfer of the electrocatalyst nanowires to the matrix, increased the apparent active area, and promoted the OER. As expected, with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), NiFe-LDHs/Ni/NF exhibited a smaller overpotential of 247 mV, a smaller Tafel slope of 35.52 mV dec(-1) and better durability than those of Ni/NF or NiFe-LDHs/NF.

However, the mechanism of magma oxidation and how it relates to the increase in H2O remain unclear. In this study, we used infrared spectroscopy of mantle wedge orthopyroxene to trace the temporal and spatial evolution of oxygen fugacity during the transport of hydrous arc melts towards the crust. A positive correlation between equilibrium oxygen fugacity and orthopyroxene H2O concentrations for the peridotite samples studied allowed the assignment of specific, commonly observed absorption bands to redox-sensitive crystallographic defects. H2O content associated with these redox-sensitive defects increases in concentration across individual crystals, uniquely preserving the time-dependent transition from reduced to oxidized conditions during the migration of hydrous melts through the mantle wedge. A separate but related process of reaction with H-2 occurring primarily during the earliest stages of melt-mantle reaction may be fundamental in generating the oxidized nature of hydrous melts. Our study proposes that the oxidized nature of arc magmas may not be a primary feature, but is instead acquired progressively as hydrous primary melts react with the surrounding mantle.									46	6	0	0	3	0	49			1752-0894	1752-0908		WOS:000477864200019	31372181

The employment of a well-defined cobalt cluster results in an unusual topology of the Co-2-MOF, where one of the cobalt centers has three open coordination positions, which has no precedent in MOF materials based on cobalt. Adsorption isotherms have revealed that Co-2-MOF is in the range of best CO2 adsorbents among the carbon materials, with very high CO2/CH4 selectivity. On the other hand, dispersion of Co-2-MOF in an alcoholic solution of Nafion gives rise to a composite (Co-2-MOF@Nafion) with great resistance to hydrolysis in aqueous media and good adherence to graphite electrodes. In fact, it exhibits high electrocatalytic activity and robustness for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with a turnover frequency number value superior to those reported for similar electrocatalysts. Overall, this work has provided the basis for the rational design of new cobalt OER catalysts and related materials employing well-defined metal clusters as directing agents of the MOF structure.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000503918300027	31752488

Although great efforts have been made to improve the HER activity of MoP, the rational design of MoP catalysts with either more active sites or higher conductivity is still challenging. Herein, a defect-rich structure (DR-MoP) is synthesized via a novel and facile low-temperature calcination strategy. Moreover, the DR-MoP is also proved to be incorporated with oxygen. The defect-rich structures could provide more active sites, and the incorporation of oxygen could further enhance the intrinsic conductivity. Thus, the DR-MoP catalyst shows outstanding HER activity and stability in both acidic and alkaline media, making it a good alternative to replace the precious-metal catalysts. Besides, the formation mechanism of DR-MoP has been discussed by controlling different annealing temperatures. This work paves a novel and effective way for improving the HER performance of transition metal phosphides by defect engineering. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

There are relatively few related research reports due to the thermodynamic instability of transition metal sulfides (TMSs) at the oxidation potential and these are usually focused on single metal sulfides or bimetal sulfides. Metal sulfide mixture systems are rarely studied. The fabrication of a TMS/TMS interface is a feasible method to improve the kinetics of the OER. Here, we constructed TMS hybrid electrocatalysts with multiple phase interfaces for the oxygen evolution reaction, named S-CoFe/CNTs. The results show that the S-CoFe/CNT catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 258 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and has high activity in the OER process. Meanwhile, the catalyst also shows a low Tafel slope (69 mV dec(-1)) and good stability. This can be attributed to the synergistic catalysis of the multiphase interface in the catalyst and the rapid electron transfer pathway brought by CNTs. The new strategy for the synthesis of catalysts containing the TMS/TMS interface provides a new idea and method for the development of efficient and practical water splitting catalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000715431800001	34747966

This ternary metal sulfide is equipped with enhanced activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline electrolyte. Through comparison of the alloys with diverse compositions, we find out the best electrochemical property of a particular alloy sulfide forming on a AgCuZn substrate (Ag:Cu:Zn = 43:49:8). The alloy sulfide exhibits an onset overpotential (eta) of 0.27 V with a Tafel slope of 95 +/- 2 mV dec(-1) and a current density of 130 mA cm(-2) at eta of 0.57 V. Moreover, the obtained AgCuZn sulfide displays excellent stability, where the current density can increase to 130% of the initial value after a water electrolysis test for 100 000 s (27.7 h). Through investigating the electrode before and after the electrocatalysis, we find a remarkable activated process during which self-supported copper-silver oxide nanowire (CuO-Ag2O NW) arrays in situ form on the surface of the electrode.

However, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction/ evolution reaction (ORR/OER) limits their practical applications. In this regard, developing an efficient ORR/OER electrocatalyst for LABs is highly important for the scientific community. Herein, we propose the pristine and copper core-shell Pt-based nano clusters (NCs) as ORR/OER catalysts with different morphologies for the Li-air battery applications. The growth patterns of intermediates formed during the possible nucleation processes have been investigated in detail. Moreover, the effect of different morphologies has also been investigated by carrying out the free energy analysis for ORR/OER. Furthermore, we show that the ORR/OER activity of the catalysts can be attributed to the varied surface distribution of platinum atoms and facets on different shaped/morphology NCs. In addition to the first-ever reporting of Pt NCs as efficient electrocatalysts for Li-air batteries, this study also communicates insight into the ORR/OER activity tunability by regulating the morphology of NCs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000868703000001

In this study, the authors report a surface phase engineering strategy to improve the OER performance of transition metal nitrides (TMNs). The iron-nickel nitrides/alloy nanospheres (FeNi3-N) wrapped in carbon are synthesized, and the optimized FeNi3-N catalyst displays dual-phase nitrides on the surface induced by atom migration phenomenon, resulting from the different migration rates of metal atoms during the nitridation process. It shows excellent OER performance in alkaline media with an overpotential of 222 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 41.53 mV dec(-1), and long-term durability under high current density (>0.5 A cm(-2)) for at least 36 h. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the dual-phase nitrides are favorable to decrease the energy barrier, modulate the d-band center to balance the absorption and desorption of the intermediates, and thus promote the OER electrochemical performance. This strategy may shed light on designing OER and other catalysts based on surface phase engineering.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000722927500001	34837326	
J	Li, Jinzhou; Wang, Lili; Wang, Tianning; Chang, Jiuli; Wu, Dapeng; Xu, Fang; Jiang, Kai; Gao, Zhiyong								Self-supported molybdenum nickel oxide catalytic electrode designed via molecular cluster-mediated electroplating and electrochemical activation for an efficient and durable oxygen evolution reaction								JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				628				607	618		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.08.009				DEC 15 2022	2022	Efficient and durable nonprecious catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for practical water electrolysis for hydrogen production. A self-supported OER catalytic electrode with sufficient exposure of the catalyst and tight anchoring onto the current collector is vital for the catalytic activity and stability, and is therefore deemed to be a preferable tactic to enhance water electrolysis performance. Herein, a polyoxometalate (POM) molecular cluster-mediated electroplating and activation tactics are proposed to design a self-supported molybdenum nickel oxide (MoNiOx) catalytic electrode for the OER. The MoNiOx active layer can anchor tightly onto the Ni foam current collector with sufficient surface exposure and high structural stability, therefore enabling high alkali OER catalytic efficiency (222 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and robust durability (only slight decay in catalytic efficiency upon 12 days of chronopotentiometry (V -t) test). Moreover, the easily processable electroplating and active protocol can serve as a general approach to prepare other OER catalytic electrodes by altering the reactants and current collectors. The current work paves a facile and universal way to design a highly active and durable molybdenum (Mo) based hybrid catalytic electrode for OER via molecular cluster-assisted electroplating and activation treatment.

Carbon fiber paper (CFP) with three-dimensional macroporous structure, excellent corrosion resistance, and high electrical properties is used as the support material to prevent surface passivation during the long-term process of OER. Through a facile method of hydrothermal synthesis and thermal treatment, vertically aligned arrays of spinel CoxFe3-xO4 nanostructures are homogeneously grown on CFP. The morphology and the Fe-doping content of the CoFe oxide nanoarrays can be controlled by the Fe3+ concentration in the precursor solution. The arrays of CoFe oxide nanosheets (NSs) grown on CFP (Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP) deliver lower Tafel slope (34.3 mV dec(-1)) than CoFe oxide nanowire (NW) arrays grown on CFP (Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NVVs/CFP) in alkaline solution, owing to higher Fe-doping content and larger effective specific surface area. The Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP electrode exhibits excellent stability for OER at large current densities in alkaline solution. Moreover, the morphology and structure of CoFeO nanoarrays are well preserved after long-term testing, indicating the high stability for OER.									46	7	0	0	1	0	46			1944-8244			WOS:000451496000045	30362701

The effect of calcination temperature and CF amount on morphologies, components, and properties of the as-prepared materials is investigated. The results demonstrate that a proper CF template can endow the as-obtained materials with hierarchically hollow-fiber morphology and multi-components (Ni-0, NiO, and C) at a certain calcination temperature, therefore providing excellent magnetic, adsorptive, and electrocatalytic OER and HER properties. Specifically, the unique hierarchical morphology and synergistic effect between Ni-0 and NiO remarkably enhance OER and HER properties of as-prepared samples. This strategy is low-cost, simple, eco-friendly, and could be extended to prepare other composites with multi-components and functionalities.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000594068500001

However, little attention has been focused on investigating the relationship between the interfacial facets and their catalytic activity. Here, we design and implement Pd-Pt interfaces with controlled heterostructure features by epitaxially growing Pt nanoparticles on Pd nanosheets. On the basis of both density functional theory calculation and experimental results, we demonstrate that charge transfer from Pd to Pt is highly dependent on the interfacial facets of Pd substrates. Therefore, the Pd-Pt heterostructure with Pd(100)-Pt interface exhibits excellent activity and long-term stability for hydrogen evolution and methanol/ethanol oxidation reactions in alkaline medium, much better than that with Pd (111)-Pt interface or commercial Pt/C. Interfacial crystal facet-dependent electronic structural modulation sheds a light on the design and investigation of new heterostructures for high-activity catalysts.									90	3	0	0	6	0	90			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000402691600038	28488861

National science review				8	1			nwaa201	nwaa201		10.1093/nsr/nwaa201				2021-Jan	2021	Exploring stable clusters to understand structural evolution from atoms to macroscopic matter and to construct new materials is interesting yet challenging in chemistry. Utilizing our newly developed deep-ultraviolet laser ionization mass spectrometry technique, here we observe the reactions of neutral cobalt clusters with oxygen and find a very stable cluster species of Co13O8 that dominates the mass distribution in the presence of a large flow rate of oxygen gas. The results of global-minimum structural search reveal a unique cubic structure and distinctive stability of the neutral Co13O8 cluster that forms a new class of metal oxides that we named as 'metalloxocubes'. Thermodynamics and kinetics calculations illustrate the structural evolution from icosahedral Co13 to the metalloxocube Co13O8 with decreased energy, enhanced stability and aromaticity. This class of neutral oxygen-passivated metal clusters may be an ideal candidate for genetic materials because of the cubic nature of the building blocks and the stability due to cubic aromaticity.									11	1	0	0	0	0	10				2053-714X		MEDLINE:34691557	34691557

This method is simple in operation, has short reaction time, and can be conducted at mild temperatures (300-400 degrees C). The electron paramagnetic resonance, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, and positron annihilation lifetime spectra results indicate that oxygen vacancies are produced in Bi4Ti3O12-x, and they can be adjusted by tuning the reduction reaction conditions. Control experiments show that the reduction time and temperature have great influences on the photocatalytic activities of Bi4Ti3O12-x The optimal Bi4Ti3O12-x is the sample undergoing the reduction treatment at 350 degrees C for 60 min and it affords a hydrogen evolution rate of 129 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1) under visible-light irradiation, which is about 3.4 times that of the pristine Bi4Ti3O12. The Bi4Ti3O12-x photocatalysts have good reusability and storage stability and can be used to decompose formaldehyde and formic acid for hydrogen production. The surface oxygen vacancies states result in the broadening of the valence band and the narrowing of the band gap. Such energy level structure variation helps promote the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs thus leading to enhancement in the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, the narrowing of the band gap leads to a broader visible light absorption of Bi4Ti3O12-x.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			2079-4991			WOS:000434889100082	29690518

Intermetallic compounds with well-defined crystal and electronic structures as well as particular chemical bonding features are suggested here to act as precursors for new composite materials with attractive catalytic properties. Al2Pt combines a characteristic inorganic crystal structure (anti-fluorite type) and a strongly polar chemical bonding with the advantage of elemental platinum in terms of stability against dissolution under OER conditions. We describe here the unforeseen performance of a surface nanocomposite architecture resulting from the self-organized transformation of the bulk intermetallic precursor Al2Pt in OER.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000566905900070	32441451

Here, we demonstrate modulation of electron structures in 3D hollow MoS2 for increasing intrinsic conductivity and activating basal planes through heteroatom doping to achieve superior HER performances. The oxygen doped hollow MoS2 nanoarchitectures (H-O-MoS2) assembled from nanosheets are constructed by oil-water two-phase method and anion exchange reaction. The H-O-MoS2 presents overpotential of 207 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1), which are much lower than hollow MoS2 (H-MoS2) and oxygen doped solid MoS2 (S-O-MoS2). Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, electron structures of MoS2 including electron density, band structure and density of state are modulated through oxygen doping, leading to highly activated basal surfaces and enhanced conductivity. Compared with H-MoS2, hydrogen adsorption of Gibbs free energy of H-O-MoS2 is reduced to 1.11 from 2.15 eV, enhancing hydrogen adsorption-desorption rate. The concept of our work combines advantages of hollow structures and electron structure modulation by oxygen doping to greatly enhance HER of MoS2, which could be extended to other 3D metal dichalcogenides catalysts for water-splitting.									6	0	1	0	1	0	6			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000555835300006

Here, a flexible, self-standing hybrid film comprising a N-doped single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) network on which are anchored Ni nanoparticles encapsulated by a monolayer of N-doped carbon (NCNi) is reported. The films are prepared by floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition followed by NH3 treatment. The material obtained at optimum conditions shows excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in alkaline media with low overpotentials of 190 and 270 mV for HER and OER, respectively, to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). A current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.57 V is achieved when this freestanding and binder-free rod-shaped NCNi/SWCNT assembly is used as cathode and anode in 1 m KOH solution for overall water splitting, presenting one of the best values reported to date.									43	4	0	0	4	0	43				2198-3844		WOS:000477708000001	31380158

In this regard, herein, Co3O4-NiO nanocomposite with compositions 0.9Co(3)O(4)-0.1NiO, 0.8Co(3)O(4)-0.2NiO, 0.7Co(3)O(4)-0.3NiO and 0.6Co(3)O(4)-0.4NiO, has been identified as electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A facile wet chemical citrate-nitrate decomposition protocol has been proposed to synthesize Co3O4-NiO electrocatalysts in large scale. The systematic electrochemical studies have been carried out to understand the effect of NiO addition on the OER performance of Co3O4. The 0.7Co(3)O(4)-0.3NiO nanocomposite modified screen-printed electrode (SPE) exhibits superior OER activity as compared to the other Co3O4-NiO nanocomposites and pristine Co3O4 modified SPE. The 0.7Co(3)O(4)-0.3NiO modified SPE delivers the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at lowest overpotentials of 280 mV with smallest Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1) and long term stability of 25 h in 1.0 M KOH.

The effects of V dopant on titania supports are proved to be twofold: i) enhancing the simplification of phase composition and consequently improving the homogeneity of porous morphology; ii) introducing redox couple V (IV)/V (V) to the surface of titania. As a result, the catalyst's OER activity is improved with the increase of V dopant in the titania support after loading IrO2 via Adams fusion method. In single cells, the OER performance gradually increases with V dopant from 0 to 20 at.%, followed by a performance deterioration with V amount reaching 30 at.% due to the corrodible V2O5 precipitate.

Generally this type of investigation is carried out by separated TMO thin films on various substrates with a different lattice constant. In this study, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of Van der Waals La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (LSMO) membrane is studied as a function of continuous strain manipulation via curvature change. It is found that a total of approximate to 800% OER activity tunability can be achieved by only approximate to 0.4% in situ strain modulation. Then the variation of in-plane interaction strength of the e(g) orbital is found to correspond to the sensitive OER tunability and 3dx(2)-y(2) orbital occupancy is favored in an OER enhancement of LSMO.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2366-7486			WOS:000645211200001

Two procedures were used for the embedding of malemide functional groups on surface or edge of graphene; MI-EGnPs (maleimide edge-functionalized graphene nanoparticles) with the more edges functional groups and MI-GnPs (maleimide functionalized graphene nanoparticles) with the more surface functional groups. In order to investigate the influence of functionalization on the electrochemical behavior of the modified graphene structures, the prepared materials were used as the metal-free electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. MI- EGnPs showed a Tafel slope of -110 mV dec(-1) compared to -168 mV dec(-1) for MI-GnPs. The observed difference in the electrochemical performances of the samples were interpreted due to the connection places of functional groups.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2365-6549			WOS:000453576900013

However, it remains challenging. Controlling the morphology of bimetallic Pd-Pt nanostructures can be a great way to improve their electrocatalytic properties compared with previously developed catalysts. Herein, we synthesize bimetallic Pd-Pt nanodendrites, which consist of a dense matrix of unsaturated coordination atoms and high porosity. The concentration of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride was significant for the morphology and size of the Pd-Pt nanodendrites. Pd-Pt nanodendrites prepared by cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (200 mM) showed higher activities towards both the hydrogen evolution reaction and methanol oxidation reaction compared to their different Pd-Pt nanodendrite counterparts, commercial Pd, and Pt catalysts, which was attributed to numerous unsaturated surface atoms in well-developed single branches.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4344		WOS:000726992300001

To improve the catalytic activity of OER electrocatalysts, several design strategies, such as construction of nanostructures, porous structures and composite materials have been proposed. Herein, spinel NiCo2O4 3-D nanoflowers supported on graphene nanosheets (GNs) are prepared by a simple solvothermal synthesis method as non-noble metal electrocatalysts for OER. The present NiCo2O4/GNs composite integrates multiple advantages of nanostructures, porous structures and composite materials, including high surface area, abundant catalytic sites and high stability. Benefiting from the favorable features, the NiCo2O4/GNs composite exhibits a better OER performance than NiCo2O4 and RuO2 in alkaline medium, which has a low onset potential (1.50 V), a small Tafel slope (137 mV dec(-1)).

Herein, hybrid amorphous/crystalline FeCoNi layered double hydroxide (LDH)-supported single Ru atoms (Ru SAs/AC-FeCoNi) are developed for enabling a highly efficient electrocatalytic OER. The amorphous outer layer in Ru SAs/AC-FeCoNi is composed of abundant defect sites and unsaturated coordination sites, which can serve as anchoring sites to stabilize single Ru atoms. The crystalline inner has a highly symmetric rigid structure, thereby strengthening the stability of support for a long-lasting OER. The synergistic effects endow this hybrid catalyst with extremely low overpotential (205 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). Density functional theory calculation indicates that single Ru atoms stabilized by hybrid amorphous/crystalline FeCoNi LDH facilitate the formation of Ru-O* (rate-determining step), thus accelerating the OER process.									28	3	0	0	0	0	28			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000588362500001

However, the ability to sustain unattenuated performance under challenging industrial conditions entailing high corrosivity of the electrolyte (approximate to 30wt.% KOH), high temperature (>80 degrees C) and high current densities (>500mAcm(-2)) is the ultimate criterion for practical viability. This work evaluates the chemical and structural stability of NiFe LDH at conditions akin to practical electrolysis, in 30% KOH at 80 degrees C, however, without electrochemical polarization, and the resulting impact on the OER performance of the catalyst. Post-analysis of the catalyst by means of XRD, TEM, FT-IR, and Raman spectroscopy after its immersion into 7.5m KOH at 80 degrees C for 60h revealed a transformation of the structure from NiFe LDH to a mixture of crystalline -Ni(OH)(2) and discrete predominantly amorphous FeOOH containing minor non-homogeneously distributed crystalline domains. These structural and compositional changes led to a drastic loss of the OER activity. It is therefore recommended to study catalyst stability at industrially relevant conditions.									35	1	0	0	1	0	35			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000445447300014	29931818

Through moderate solvothermal route, cobalt sulfides are synthesized in situ growth and observed by scanning electron microscope image analysis. Noteworthily, 3D hierarchical cobalt sulfides acting as bifunctional photocatalysts are implemented to catalyze the visible-light-driven oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. This efficient, earth-abundant, and nonnoble water splitting catalyst for artificial photosynthesis is thoroughly analyzed by various spectroscopic techniques with the aim of investigating its photocatalytic mechanism under visible-light illumination. The main catalyst of CoS-2 exhibits considerable H-2 evolution rate of 1196 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) and O-2 yield of 63.5%. The efficient activity is attributed to the effective electron transfer between the photosensitizer and catalyst, which is verified by transient absorption experiments. The effective electron transfer between the photosensitizer and catalyst during water oxidation is verified by the dramatic decline of [Ru(bpy)(3)](3+) concentration in the presence of the catalyst CoS-2. At the same time, transient absorption experiments support a rapid electron transfers from (EY)-E-3* (excited photosensitizer eosin-Y) to the catalyst CoS-2 for efficient hydrogen evolution.									126	7	0	0	17	0	130			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000397348100021

However, their specific activity and durability require substantial enhancement to meet the requirement of the practical applications. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that a layered perovskitemetal oxide nano-hybrid electrocatalyst synthesized through a one-pot combustion process shows remarkably high OER activity in alkaline solution. The hybrid consists of two major phases, i.e. NiO and K2NiF4-type layered perovskite (La0.613Ca0.387)(2)NiO3.562, showing synergistically enhanced OER activity and excellent durability under harsh OER operating conditions.

A cyclic voltammetric activation is found to enhance the activity of the CoB and W2CoB2 precatalysts due to the transformation of their surfaces into the amorphous CoOOH layer with a thickness of 3-4 nm. However, such surface transformation does not happen on the WB and WCoB due to their superior structure stability under the applied voltage, highlighting the importance of metal components for the surface reconstruction process. It is found that, compared with CoB, the W2CoB2 surface shows a quicker reconstruction with a larger active surface area due to the selective leaching of the W from its surface. In the meantime, the metallic W2CoB2 core underneath the CoOOH layer shows a better promotion of its oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance than CoB. Therefore, the ternary W2CoB2 shows better OER performance than the CoB, as well as the WB and WCoB. It is also found that the mixture of W2CoB2 with Pt/C as the catalysts in air electrode for rechargeable Zn-air battery (ZAB), shows better performance than the IrO2-Pt/C couple-based ZAB.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000780486800001	35347855

Studies on the crystal structures of quadruple perovskite ruthenates are rare, and the origin of OER activity or stability from a structural aspect has not been clarified in detail. This presents the need to study the effects of cations at the A site of quadruple perovskite ruthenates ACu(3)Ru(4)O(12) (A = Ca, Sr, La, Nd, and Ce) on the OER catalytic activity and stability in acidic aqueous solutions. CaCu3Ru4O12 has the highest activity and stability among all quadruple perovskite samples. The type of cation at the A site changes the average Cu and Ru valence states, and the plot of OER activity versus the average Cu valence number shows a volcano-type relationship. In addition, stability increases with a decrease in Ru-O bond length. This research provides a good design principle for OER catalysts with high activity and stability in severely acidic aqueous solutions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000822055100001	35802899

In this work, a simple and effective strategy was developed to synthesize a series of amorphous MoCo lamellar hydroxide through one-step chemical co-precipitation. Systematic investigations showed that different functional agents (2-methylimidazole, NaOH, NH4OH) in the fabrication process resulted in different micromorphology of the catalyst, thus influencing its electrocatalytic performance. Also, adding various amounts of Mo could influence the intrinsic catalytic properties. Samples synthesized with appropriate functional agent addition and optimized Mo addition exhibited amorphous nature and bent nanosheet morphology, as well as highest intrinsic catalytic activity, showing a low overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1) in 1 m KOH solution. Additionally, the catalytic performance of the sample showed just small decay after 50 h chronopotentiometry test and 3000 cyclic voltammetry cycles, exhibiting the ultra-stable catalytic activity of the catalyst. This work provides a possible large-scale commercial production strategy of OER catalysts with promising performance and low fabrication cost.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000722159200001	34738738

As a result of the ease of thermal evaporation and particulate self-assembly growth, the phthalocyanine molecular species can be uniformly deposited layer-by-layer on the surface of substrates. This structure can be used as a template to achieve a tunable amount of catalysts, high dispersion of the nanoparticles, and transparency of the catalysts. In this study, we present a systematic study of the structural and optical properties, surface morphologies, and electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of cobalt oxide prepared from a phthalocyanine metal precursor. Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) films with different thicknesses were deposited by thermal evaporation on different substrates. The films were annealed at 400 degrees C in air to form a material with the cobalt oxide phase. The final Co oxide catalysts exhibit high transparency after thermal treatment. Their OER measurements demonstrate well expected mass activity for OER. Thermally evaporated and treated transition metal oxide nanoparticles are attractive for the functionalization of (photo)anodes for water oxidation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000389161600032	27813407

However, Ni-rich NMCs are more and more in the focus of current research due to their higher specific capacity and energy. In this work we will compare LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (NMC111), LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622), and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) with respect to their cycling stability in NMC-graphite full-cells at different end-of-charge potentials. It will be shown that stable cycling is possible up to 4.4 V for NMC111 and NMC622 and only up to 4.0 V for NMC811. At higher potentials, significant capacity fading was observed, which was traced back to an increase in the polarization of the NMC electrode, contrary to the nearly constant polarization of the graphite electrode. Furthermore, we show that the increase in the polarization occurs when the NMC materials are cycled up to a high-voltage feature in the dq/dV plot, which occurs at similar to 4.7 V vs. Li/Li+ for NMC111 and NMC622 and at similar to 4.3 V vs. Li/Li+ for NMC811. For the latter material, this feature corresponds to the H2 -> H3 phase transition. Contrary to the common understanding that the electrochemical oxidation of carbonate electrolytes causes the CO2 and CO evolution at potentials above 4.7 V vs. Li/Li+, we believe that the observed CO2 and CO are mainly due to the chemical reaction of reactive lattice oxygen with the electrolyte. This hypothesis is based on gas analysis using On-line Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry (OEMS), by which we prove that all three materials release oxygen from the particle surface and that the oxygen evolution coincides with the onset of CO2 and CO evolution. Interestingly, the onsets of oxygen evolution for the different NMCs correlate well with the high-voltage redox feature at similar to 4.7 V vs. Li/Li+ for NMC111 and NMC622 as well as at similar to 4.3 V vs. Li/Li+ for NMC811. To support this hypothesis, we show that no CO2 or CO is evolved for the LiNi0.43Mn1.57O4 (LNMO) spinel up to 5 V vs. Li/Li+, consistent with the absence of oxygen release. Lastly, we demonstrate by the use of C-13 labeled conductive carbon that it is the electrolyte rather than the conductive carbon which is oxidized by the released lattice oxygen. Taking these findings into consideration, a mechanism is proposed for the reaction of released lattice oxygen with ethylene carbonate yielding CO2, CO, and H2O. (C) The Author(s) 2017.

Compound 1 shows a 3D network constructed from both a dinuclear cluster and mononuclear Co(II) nodes. The mixture of triangular trinuclear and rhombus tetranuclear cluster nodes linked by 5-i-butoxyisophthalate and bpp give rise to a 3D pillared-layer structure of 2. The structural and topological differences of the two complexes demonstrate that the characteristics of the N-donor auxiliary ligands play significant roles in constructing the novel architectures of coordination polymers.

Herein we report a new strategy of fabricating a 3-D hierarchical CuO nanocrystal array (CuO NCA) on Cu foam through a two-step sacrifice-template method. This CuO NCA possesses high conductivity, great stability, and impressive catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. The CuO NCA can achieve a high current density of 100 mA/cm(2) at a relatively low overpotential of 400 mV for OER, which shows a better performance than other Cu-based OER catalysts and IrO2 . The high activity of CuO NCA is well retained during a 10-h OER test at a high current density around 270 mA/cm(2), which is about 10 times higher than the current density achieved by IrO2 (around 25 mA/cm(2)) with the same applied overpotential. According to our best knowledge, CuO NCA is currently the most efficient and stable Cu-based electrocatalyst for water oxidation in alkaline electrolytes.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1674-0068	1003-7713		WOS:000455960700012

Herein, a two-step strategy is reported that involves the preparation of the new boron imidazolate framework (BIF-73) which is subsequently utilized as a precursor to yield the crystalline 2D nanosheet material (Fe@BIF-73-NS) via post-synthetic modification. This new electrocatalytic material stabilizes ultra-small (Fe2O3) fragments resulting in an excellent electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER: lower overpotential with 291 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (faradaic efficiency of CO reaching 88.6% at -1.8 V vs Ag/AgCl) without the need for noble metals. Additionally, theoretical calculations and microscopy reveal that the superior OER performance can be attributed to the increased exposure of binding sites within the material to which the catalytically active Fe(3+)centers are bound through a post-synthetic modification procedure. A red-shift of the Fermi level around the valence band is observed and is proposed to be a result of the aforementioned interactions. This work opens an avenue toward the development of 2D functional metal organic framework nanosheets for energy conversion applications.									11	2	0	0	0	0	11			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000539571300001	32529762

Here we present the construction of FeCo-FeCoP@C hollow nanocubes encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages (FeCo-FeCoP@C@NCCs) through controlled carbonization and subsequent phosphorization of a Prussian blue analogue. With stronger electronic interaction and hollow structure, the as-obtained FeCo-FeCoP@C@NCCs material requires small overpotentials of 91 mV and 280 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH toward hydrogen and oxygen evolution, respectively. More importantly, applying this material for overall water splitting, it only requires 1.64 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits impressively durability over 40 h without obvious performance decay. The present approach inspires potentials for the controllable synthesis of multi-component catalysts for practical applications.

In general, changing of synthesis method and the doping metal affect the electrochemical activities of BSCF. In this work, silver doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF-Ag) perovskite structure is shown to be a better electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its lower overpotential and extended durability. BSCF structure was synthesized by the EDTA-citric acid method. Appropriate amount of Ba(NO3)(2) and EDTA were dissolved 0.1 M NH4OH solution. Nitrate salts of other metals were dissolved in distilled water, then mixed with prepared Ba(NO3)(2) solution. The mixture was stirred at 70 degrees C until gelation occurred. The gelled samples obtained were baked in a drying oven at 250 degrees C for 24 h before being calcined at 1000 degrees C for 12 h. To achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), BSCF-Ag has required an overpotential of 0.36 V, which is very low compared to BSCF. To determine the stability of BSCF-Ag, continuous chronopotentiometry tests were carried out for 5 h and at a constant current density of 10 mA cm(-2). BSCF-Ag was characterized by XRD, SEM, and XPS.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000561000500001

The stable Co NPs are active for catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.1 M KOH, producing a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 0.39 V (1.62 V vs RHE, no iR-correction). Their catalysis is superior to the commercial Ir catalyst in both activity and stability. These Co NPs are also assembled into a monolayer array on the working electrode, allowing the detailed study of their intrinsic OER activity. The Co NPs in the monolayer array show 15 times higher turnover frequency (2.13 s(-1)) and mass activity (1949 A/g) than the NPs deposited on conventional carbon black (0.14 s(-1) and 126 A/g, respectively) at an overpotential of 0.4 V. These stable Co NPs are a promising new class of noble-metal-free catalyst for water splitting.									276	10	0	0	14	0	276			0002-7863			WOS:000356322300025	26018822

The large-scale application of these devices is finite due to slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In order to solve this issue, plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) is used to synthesize high performance nano oxide (NiOx@Co3O4/CC) electrocatalyst for OER applications. Herein, the cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanowire arrays are grown on oxygen plasma-treated carbon-cloth (CC) and then a thin layer (similar to 1.2 nm) of nickel oxide (NiOx) is deposited on the Co3O4/CC through PE-ALD method. The electrocatalyst of two transition metal oxides plays a leading role in improving the OER performance and stability. The overpotential for OER of NiOx@Co3O4/CC electrocatalyst is 360 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than that of Co3O4/CC (420 mV) and comparable to commercial RuO2 (350 mV) electrocatalyst. Moreover, the stability of NiOx@Co3O4/CC electrocatalyst is also improved, which only 8.85% of the initial current is loss after 40,000 s.

Here, we report three novel porous metal phosphonates, cobalt phosphonate (CoPIm), nickel phosphonate (NiPIm), and nickel-cobalt phosphonate (NiCoPIm), using iminodi(methylphosphonic acid) as an organophosphorous precursor via a hydrothermal nontemplated synthetic route. All three materials have been explored as electrocatalysts for the OER. Notably, the CoPIm material exhibits excellent electrocatalytic behavior among all of the as-prepared catalysts. The high surface area and the formation of active CoOOH species on the catalyst surface during the OER process are the main driving force for a superior electrochemical OER. The CoPIm catalyst requires a very small overpotential (334 mV) to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution with a Tafel slope of 58.6 mV dec(-1) as compared to NiPIm, NiCoPIm, and commercial IrO2. Additionally, the prepared CoPIm catalyst shows excellent stability up to 25 h, suggesting its potential in electrochemical water splitting.									30	1	0	0	6	0	30			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000551969200073

Hence, overcoming the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a focus of enormous research efforts in the field of electrocatalysis. Recently, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have emerged as very promising low-cost catalysts for the OER in alkaline media. Exfoliation of bulk LDH into ultra-thin sheets, preparation of high surface area 3D structures and the combination with carbon materials are only a few examples used to enhance the activity toward the OER in the last years. The intrinsic stability of the LDHs and the stability of related electrode assemblies represent the second highly important aspect of catalyst evaluation. Although OER activity improvement of LDHs seems to have reached a plateau, their stability is much less optimized and more development in this direction is critically needed.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2451-9103			WOS:000424677900002

Here we present the identification of 6H-phase SrIrO3 perovskite (6H-SrIrO3) as a highly active electrocatalyst with good structural and catalytic stability for OER in acid. 6H-SrIrO3 contains 27.1 wt% less iridium than IrO2, but its iridium mass activity is about 7 times higher than IrO2, a benchmark electrocatalyst for the acidic OER. 6H-SrIrO3 is the most active catalytic material for OER among the iridium-based oxides reported recently, based on its highest iridium mass activity. Theoretical calculations indicate that the existence of face-sharing octahedral dimers is mainly responsible for the superior activity of 6H-SrIrO3 thanks to the weakened surface Ir-O binding that facilitates the potential-determining step involved in the OER (i.e., O* + H2O -> HOO* + H+ + e(-)).									177	6	0	0	8	0	175			2041-1723			WOS:000452633000004	30531797

The low concentration of reactant in neutral electrolyte mandates that OER catalysts provide both the water adsorption and dissociation steps. Here it is shown, using density functional theory simulations, that the addition of hydrated metal cations into a Ni-Fe framework contributes water adsorption functionality proximate to the active sites. Hydration-effect-promoting (HEP) metal cations such as Mg2+ and hydration-effect-limiting Ba2+ into Ni-Fe frameworks using a room-temperature sol-gel process are incorporated. The Ni-Fe-Mg catalysts exhibit an overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in pH-neutral electrolytes and thus outperform iridium oxide (IrO2) electrocatalyst by a margin of 40 mV. The catalysts are stable over 900 h of continuous operation. Experimental studies and computational simulations reveal that HEP catalysts favor the molecular adsorption of water and its dissociation in pH-neutral electrolyte, indicating a strategy to enhance OER catalytic activity.									40	1	0	0	2	0	40			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000507546700001	31950562

Although binary transition metal oxides, particularly spinel ferrites with a general chemical formula MFe2O4, are a promising class of candidates for OER, their intrinsically low electrical conductivity has a significant negative impact on their electrochemical performances. Herein, we report a simple one-step method for tailoring carbon spheres (CSs) with CoFe2O4 (CFO) to form a CFO@CSs composite as a cost-effective electrocatalyst. The as-synthesized CFO@CSs features a high specific surface area of 56.94 m2/g and exhibits decently high OER catalytic activity with a relatively small overpotential of 390 mV at 10 mA/cm2, fast kinetics, and high durability in alkaline medium. Moreover, the pairing of the bare Ni mesh electrode as the cathode and the CFO@CSs on Ni mesh as the anode is set up to illustrate its feasibility for the overall alkaline water splitting. This study offers a cost-effective electrocatalyst for OER that can be used instead of precious metals in various renewable energy storage and conversion applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000743262100006

Here, by adjusting the surface wettability of the catalyst using a facile two-step strategy, a porous nanosheet electrocatalyst composed of NiFe hydroxide and NiFe phosphate (denoted as NiFe/NiFe:Pi), has been designed and developed. The two-step strategy not only allows us to successfully control the morphology but also provides an approach to modify the surface chemical property of a catalyst. After phosphorylation, the surface wettability of the NiFe/NiFe:Pi catalyst is significantly enhanced (contact angle 44 +/- 3 degrees) in comparison to that of NiFc hydroxide electrode without phosphorylation (contact angle 129 +/- 5 degrees). Serving as an oxygen evolution catalyst in 1 M KOH aqueous solution, the NiFe/NiFe:Pi electrode yields strong synergistic. oxygen evolution activity to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential merely of 290 mV. The catalyst also exhibits extraordinary high current densities of 300 mA cm(-2) at an extremely low overpotential of 340 mV, which is among the best Ni-based OER electrocatilysts to date. The well-maintained open, porous nanosheet structure, enhanced surface wettability, and increased charge transfer rate at the NiFe/NiFe:Pi catalyst, together with effective mass transport and enlarged catalytic active sites offered by the hierarchical porous structure, contribute to the extraordinary water oxidation performance.									221	4	0	0	8	0	222			2155-5435			WOS:000398986700036

The spinel-type nickel cobalt oxide (NiCo2O4) nanowires are hydrothermally synthesized and can serve as an excellent oxygen evolution reaction catalyst. Subsequent sulfurization of the NiCo2O4 nanowires leads to the formation of pyrite-type nickel cobalt sulfide (Ni0.33Co0.67S2) nanowires. Due to the 1D nanowire morphology and enhanced charge transport capability, the Ni0.33Co0.67S2 nanowires function as an efficient, stable, and robust nonnoble metal electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), substantially exceeding CoS2 or NiS2 nanostructures synthesized under similar methods. The Ni0.33Co0.67S2 nanowires exhibit low onset potential of -65, -39, and -50 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode, Tafel slopes of 44, 68, and 118 mV dec(-1) at acidic, neutral, and basic conditions, respectively, and excellent stability, comparable to the best reported non-noble metal-based HER catalysts. Furthermore, the homologous Ni0.33Co0.67S2 nanowires and NiCo2O4 nanowires are assembled into an all-nanowire based water splitting electrolyzer with a current density of 5 mA cm(-2) at a voltage as 1.65 V, thus suggesting a unique homologous, earth abundant material system for water splitting.									432	23	0	0	12	0	438			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000354220000010

The synthesized electrodes demonstrate first-rate performance with enhanced durability for electrolysis. Individually, Ni3S2/MoS2-CC affords an overpotential (eta) of 173 mV (at 100 mA cm(-2)) in HER, while NiFe(OH)(x)@Ni3S2/MoS2-CC affords an eta of 309 mV (at 100 mA cm(-2)) in OER. Tight interstratification between the nanosheet (NS) array and amorphous bimetallic hydroxides lead to enhanced affinity for OH-/H+, improved conductivity, increased charge transfer, and enriched active sites. The two-electrode alkaline (1.0 M KOH) electrolyzer (NMC//NFNMC) requires a low overall voltage (Delta V) of 1.55 and 1.71 V to reach 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. The rational combination of TMDs and TMDs/NiFe(OH)(x) delivers a useful methodology for designing and constructing low-cost, hierarchical, transition metal-based composite catalysts with high performance for water electrolysis.									21	1	0	0	2	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000457893400052

The electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) study of the CuCo2O4@CC electrode shows high durability and good activity in 1 M KOH. As an energy storage electrode, it shows a high specific capacitance of 1438 Fg(-)(1) at 10 mA cm(-2) in a 3 M KOH electrolyte. The electrochemical stability of the CuCo2O4@CC electrode was tested for 5000 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2), and it showed 98.6% stability. This CuCo2O4@CC electrode produces a capacitance of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 288 mV for the OER, with a Tafel slope of 64.2 mV dev(-1). The electrochemical stability measured at an overpotential of 292 mV for 12 hat 10 mA cm(-2) shows good electronic stability in an alkaline medium. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the CuCo2O4@CC electrode may be due to the Cu and Co counterparts in addition to the high surface area. The CuCo2O4@CC electrode is a simple, flexible, and cost-effectivive electrode in both electrocatalytic OER and energy storage applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, the Co(III) cation in typical LaCoO3 (LCO) favors low spin state, which is mediocre for absorbing oxygen-containing groups involved in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), thus hindering its further development in electrocatalysis. Herein, both experimental and theoretical results reveal the enhancement of bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in LaCoO3 by N doping. More specifically, electron energy loss spectroscopy and superconducting quantum interference devices magnetic analysis demonstrate that the Co(III) cation in N-doped LaCoO3 (LCON) achieves a moderate e(g) occupancy (approximate to 1) compared with its low spin state in LaCO3. First-principle calculation results reveal that N dopants play a bifunctional role of tuning the spin-state transition of Co(III) cations and increasing the electrical conductivity of LCO. Thus, the optimized LCON exhibits an OER overpotential of 1.69 Vat the current density of 50 mA/cm(2) (1.94 V for pristine LCO) and yields an ORR limiting current density of 5.78 mA/cm(2) (4.01 mA/cm(2) for pristine LCO), which offers a new strategy to simultaneously modulate the magnetic and electronic structures of LCO to further enhance its electrocatalytic activity.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000612551400027	33399444

This unique 3D oriented nanosheet array structure can expose more catalytic active sites, promote the penetration of electrolyte solution on the catalyst surface, and facilitate the transfer of ions, thus speeding up the kinetic process of Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and Oxygen evolution reaction (OER). At the current densities of 10 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH solution, the HER overpotential (71 mV) of the FeNi2P/CC self-supporting electrode is very close to that of noble metal HER catalyst of 20% Pt/C (54 mV), and its OER overpotential (210 mV) is 34% lower than that of the precious metal OER catalyst of RuO2 (318 mV), demonstrating the excellent electrocatalytic performance of the FeNi2P/CC catalyst. Moreover, the cell voltage for full water splitting (at 10 mA/cm(2) current densities) of the FeNi2P/CC bifunctional electrode cell is 1.52 V, which is 3.8% lower than that of the full noble-metal electrode reference cell (RuO2 parallel to Pt/C, 1.58 V), suggesting that this FeNi2P/CC bifunctional catalyst is likely to replace precious metals to reduce the costs in full water splitting application. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculation results, the introduction of iron atom can change the electronic structure of the Ni2P, so it can reduce the adsorption energy of hydrogen and oxygen, and facilitate the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen and oxygen on the surface of the catalyst, improving its performance of HER and OER.

Particularly, two-dimensional (2D) MOF nanosheets materials possess both advantages of 2D layered nanomaterials and MOFs, are considered as promising nanomaterials. Herein, we report a facile and scalable in situ hydrothermal synthesis of a 2D Co-based bimetallic MOFs (Co-Fe/Ni@HPA-MOF nanosheets), which can be stable in alkaline solution and directly adopted as highly efficient electrocatalysts. The Co-Ni@HPA-MOF can reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotential of 320 mV with a small Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1), which is comparable to that of commercial RuO2 (58 mV dec(-1)). The excellent electrocatalytic properties can be attributed to the 2D nanosheet and the coupling effect between Co and Ni, which provided large number of accessible active sites. The results highlight the great potential of utilizing MOF nanosheets for electrocatalysis, and will pave a way to develop more efficient 2D MOFs for diverse catalytic applications.									33	4	0	0	1	0	33			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000464772500005

Precious metal-free functionalized carbon materials are widely demonstrated as the most promising candidates, while it still lacks effective synthetic methodology to controllably synthesize carbocatalysts with targeted active sites. This work demonstrates the direct utilization of the intrinsic structural defects in nanocarbon to generate atomically dispersed Co-Nx-C active sites via defect engineering. As-fabricated Co/N/O tri-doped graphene catalysts with highly active sites and hierarchical porous scaffolds exhibit superior ORR/OER bifunctional activities and impressive applications in rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Specifically, when integrated into a rechargeable and flexible solid Zn-air battery, a high open-circuit voltage of 1.44 V, a stable discharge voltage of 1.19 V, and a high energy efficiency of 63% at 1.0 mA cm(-2) are achieved even under bending. The defect engineering strategy provides a new concept and effective methodology for the full utilization of nanocarbon materials with various structural features and further development of advanced energy materials.									359	38	0	0	16	0	364			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000412184100030	28782846

However, the sluggish kinetics of the HER/OER/ORR and their dependency on noble-metal-based catalysts (e.g. Pt, Ir and Ru) hinder the large-scale commercial applications of these devices. Hence, the development of low-cost, efficient, stable and scalable electrocatalysts, especially bifunctional HER/OER or OER/ORR electrocatalysts that could simultaneously catalyze HER/OER or OER/ORR, is highly desired but full of great challenges. To date, non-noble cobalt (Co)-based materials, including cobalt oxide, cobalt phosphides, cobalt chalcogenides (sulfide and selenides), Co-included layered double hydroxides, Co-N-C, Co-based single atoms and their composites, have been widely investigated as bifunctional electrocatalysts owing to their innate electrochemical capabilities and structural adjustability by mixing, doping or combining with other materials, such as carbon materials. In this review, the fundamental mechanisms of the bifunctional electrocatalysis of ORR/OER and OER/HER are introduced and analyzed, and recent progress in the design, synthesis and emerging applications of Co-based materials as bifunctional electrocatalysts for ORR/OER or OER/HER in alkaline electrolytes are summarized and discussed. Finally, the strategies and perspectives for designing novel highly efficient bifunctional cobalt-based electrocatalysts are analyzed. This analysis is expected to highlight the challenges faced by bifunctional noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for the study and development of next-generation electrocatalysts for the HER/ORR/OER.									157	8	0	0	7	0	157			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000481578000001

Au composites were successfully prepared in a wet condition and their use as actuator devices showed rapid bending toward the anode in response to an applied voltage of 2.0V in water without gas evolution. Direct polymer electrolyte fuel cells have also been reported as typical examples of the application of a polymer electrolyte membrane. These are represented by direct ascorbic acid fuel cells that use carbon anodes without exhausting any harmful chemicals, and by the technical advantages of an anion-exchange membrane alternative to the conventional cation-exchange membrane in direct fuel cells with ethanol or glucose fuels. Finally, a reversible air electrode for the oxygen reduction and evolution reaction was integrated with an anion-exchange membrane to diminish the influence of atmospheric carbon dioxide on the oxygen reaction.

However, the relatively complicated surface structuring methods, high Tafel slope, and low stability hinder their practical applications to replace the conventional Ir- and Ru-based catalysts. Herein, a strategy to construct hierarchically architected mixed oxides on conductive substrates (e.g., ITO and Ni foam) via a nanosheet (NS) deposition and subsequent bidirectional nanomodification approach, with metal salts in an aprotic polar solvent (e.g., acetone) as the primary modifying reactants is reported. This strategy is used to prepare NiO-based NSs with nanopores, nanobranches, or a combination of both, containing up to four transition metal elements. Record-low Tafel slope (22.3 mV center dot dec(-1), approximate to lowest possible by computational predictions) and week-long continuous operation durability are achieved by FeMnNi-O NSs supported on Ni foams. Taken together, properly designed hierarchical mixed oxide electrodes may provide a cost-effective route to generating high, reliable, and stable OER catalytic activities, paving the way for both new electrocatalyst design and practical water-splitting devices.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000628842200001	33719180

Anionic regulation of electrocatalysts by modulating the electronic structure of active sites significantly promotes OER performance. To prove the concept, NiFeS electrocatalysts are fabricated with gradual variation of atomic ratio of S:O. With the rise of S content, the overpotential for water oxidation exhibits a volcano plot under anionic regulation. The optimized NiFeS-2 electrocatalyst under anionic regulation possesses the lowest OER overpotential of 286 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and the fastest kinetics being 56.3 mV dec(-1) to date. The anionic regulation methodology not only serves as an effective strategy to construct superb OER electrocatalysts, but also enlightens a new point of view for the in-depth understanding of electrocatalysis at the electronic and atomic level.									127	26	0	0	6	0	131			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000404553100016	28508560

The emergence of heterostructures invokes new opportunities to use the full potential of pristine MOFs as efficient catalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, a MOF surface-reaction strategy is developed to synthesize MOF-based heterostructures without pyrolysis. Uniform Fe(OH)(3) nanosheets are grown controllably on the Co-MOF-74 surface by a fast "phenol-Fe" reaction that takes advantage of the hydroxyl sites in Co-MOF-74. The resulting Fe(OH)(3)@Co-MOF-74 heterostructure delivers an excellent performance in the OER with a low overpotential of 292 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Notably, the introduction of Fe can improve the intrinsic activity of the original Co atom significantly. The turnover frequency in Fe(OH)(3)@Co-MOF-74 (1.209 s(-1)) is more than 25 times higher than that in Co-MOF-74 (0.048 s(-1)). This work presents a fresh concept for the fundamental design of advanced pure-MOF-based heterostructures and, thereby, provides a new avenue for the fabrication of other energy-conversion and -storage materials.									27	2	0	0	0	0	27			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000487780200001	31407864

The energy release properties of aluminum (Al) nanoparticles in droplets and the influence of oxygen content on agglomerate evolution were studied. The phase separation of liquid fuel and Al nanoparticles occurs during the combustion process of concentrated nAl/JP-10 nanofluid. The burning forms of Al nanoparticles within the droplet include local, splash out, and agglomerate burning. Among them, agglomerate burning is the primary form of energy release. During the combustion process, Al particles gradually form an Al agglomerate, and the oxidation reaction of Al nanoparticles mainly occurs after the diffusion flame disappears. Oxygen content has a significant effect on the agglomerate burning of Al nanoparticles. When oxygen content is >10%, the Al particles are successfully ignited. When oxygen content reaches 50%, a deflagration of the agglomerate occurs, and the Al particles rapidly oxidize to completely release heat and form a dense alumina sphere.									15	2	0	0	1	0	17			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000483170300021

Here, a facile method for trapping Pt nanoparticles at oxygen vacancies of molybdenum oxide (MoOx) nanosheets, yielding a high-performance MoOx/Pt composite electrocatalyst for both the glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolytes, is reported. Combined electrochemical experiments and theoretical calculations reveal the important role of MoOx nanosheets for the adsorption of glycerol molecules in GOR and the dissociation of water molecules in HER, as well as the strong electronic interaction with Pt. The MoOx/Pt composite thus significantly enhances the specific mass activity of Pt and the kinetics for both reactions. With MoOx/Pt electrodes serving as both cathode and anode, two-electrode glycerol electrolysis is achieved at a cell voltage of 0.70 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is 0.90 V less than that required for water electrolysis.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000702443900001	34596974

WOxNWs/N-rGO were synthesized by solvothermally coupling tungsten oxide nanowires with melamine/graphene oxide followed by annealing. The WOxNWs/N-rGO exhibit only 40 mV of overpotential to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is only 7.01 mV greater than that of Pt/C but 4.90 and 9.90 mV less than those of WOxNWs/rGO and WOxNWs, respectively. A durability test of WOxNWs/N-rGO reveals only a 14 mV overpotential shift after 5000 cycles at a large current density of 100 mA cm(-2). At a constant overpotential of 55 mV, the WOxNWs/N-rGO activity also exhibits a slight degradation of approximately 5.4% after 12 h. The outstanding performance of the WOxNWs/N-rGO for the HER is attributed to the synergetic effect between the oxygen-vacancy-rich WOxNWs and N-rGO.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448413100050

However, the development of non-precious metal catalysts for improving the sluggish oxygen reaction kinetics of the air cathode of ZAB still presents a challenge. Herein, nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheet arrays vertically grown on carbon cloth decorated with CeO2/Co heterostructure (Co/CeO2-NCNA@CC) as an integrated cathode have been successfully constructed using a facile carbonization-hydrolysis procedure using a metal-organic framework (MOF) as a precursor. The size of CeO2 nanoparticles can be controlled with an average diameter of about 6.0 nm through unique hydrolysis to form the heterostructure with Co species, which are uniformly dispersed on the surface of nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheet arrays (NCNA). NCNA vertically grown on carbon cloth (CC) has improved wettability and allows for the CeO2/Co heterostructure to be easily accessible. The abundant intrinsic oxygen vacancies in CeO2 bring the catalyst an excellent ability to tune the oxygen concentration during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes. The integrity of the electrode accelerates the transfer of electrons from the active sites to the CC current collector. Therefore, ZAB using Co/CeO2-NCNA@CC as the integrated cathode exhibits an impressive electrocatalytic performance toward both ORR and OER. The ZAB with Co/CeO2-NCNA@CC cathode has an open-circuit voltage of 1.47 V and supply capacity of 784.4 mA h g(Zn)(-1) even after 380 h operation at 5.0 mA cm(-2), which surpasses the catalysts of commercial Pt/C + RuO2 and the most reported catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000782249500001

Co-based perovskites with superior durability can be used as the promising OER catalysts for the direct seawater electrolysis, though their OER catalytic activity still needs to be improved. In this work, we propose a novel top-down phase evolution method to synthesize a Co-based perovskite hybrid (P/RP-SNCF) compositing the ABO(3)-type SrNb0.1Co0.7Fe0.2O3-delta (P-SNCF) and Ruddlesden-Popper Sr3NbCoO7-delta (RP-SNCF) perovskite by a facile annealing method. Compared with P-SNCF, the OER process of P/RP-SNCF prefers the lattice oxygen oxidation (LOM) pathway. The P/RP-SNCF hybrid shows significantly enhanced OER catalytic activity with the overpotential being as low as 335 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). By the active surface reconstruction of P/RP-SNCF with electrochemical reduction, the optimized ER-P/RP-SNCF-5 shows the further improved OER activity. Furthermore, by using ER-P/RP-SNCF-5 as the anode for the direct seawater electrolysis, the electrolytic voltage reaches 1.57 V to yield a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and keeps stable for 100 h. The proposed strategy provides a new insight into the design of the high-performance perovskite hybrid for the direct seawater electrolysis. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, almost all the current researches are based on the assumption of the self-stability of the heteroatom-doped carbon materials, neglecting their possible structural evolution during electrocatalysis, especially under harsh oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions. Besides, previous researches always focused on the dropcast carbon-based materials with only a few participated dopants, leading to unobservable structural evolution during the electrolysis. Here, heteroatom-doped graphite flakes (GP) with a large quantity of participated dopants are chosen as the research model to multiply the transformation during the electrolysis. Through the combination of theoretical calculations and experiments, we present the nearly complete dissolution of the heteroatoms in N-, P-, and Se-doped carbon materials in the form of the high-valence oxoanions during OER. The oxygen-abundant residues are proven to be responsible for the OER activity. Among the oxygen-containing functional groups in the residues, the ortho-quinone moieties, whose structures change with the doping elements, are finally identified as the active sites. Heteroatom-doped carbon materials as the supporting substrates for the metal-based composite experience a similar transformation, leading to unexpectedly different activity origins. Our work not only reveals the real active sites of the heteroatom-doped carbon materials for OER but also provides new insight into understanding the heteroatom-doped carbon materials as the supporting substrates for other anodic reactions.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000765779100046	35138841

The microscopic morphology and phase composition of the anodic oxide layers were observed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, respectively. The activity and reaction kinetics of the anodes varied noticeably during electrolysis, indicating the formation and stabilization of the anodic oxide layer. With increasing electrolysis time, the potential and overpotential of oxygen evolution of the anodes mainly presented a declining trend, whereas their electrode surface exchange current density demonstrated a rising trend. This depolarization can be accounted for by the increasing roughness of the anodic surface and the catalytic effect of increasing beta-PbO2 content. The anodic oxide layer obtained after 15 days of electrolysis presented the most compact and the best regular structure among five experimental samples. The corrosion phases of the anodic oxide layers mainly consisted of PbSO4, PbO, alpha-PbO2, and beta-pbO(2). With increasing electrolysis time, the alpha-PbO2 content presented a declining trend, whereas the beta-PbO2 content demonstrated a rising trend. alpha-PbO2 and beta-PbO2 showed preferential growth orientations toward the (111) and (101) planes, respectively.

Here we design a crystalline-amorphous Ni-Fe-Al hybrid phosphides nanosheet arrays grown on NiFe foam for efficient OER application. Dynamic surface reorganization of phosphides at anodic/cathodic polarizations is probed by in situ Raman spectroscopy. The reconstructed amorphous Ni(Fe)OOH species are determined as the active phases that facilitate the OER process. This unique electrode shows highly catalytic activity toward water oxidation, achieving the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at 181 and 214 mV in 1 M KOH, respectively. Meanwhile, it also exhibits excellent stability at a large current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for over 60 h. This work reveals the dynamic structural transformation of pre-catalyst in realistic conditions and highlights the important role of oxyhydroxides as real reactive species in OER process with high activity.

This study demonstrates a novel layered perovskite via Co-doping strategy, i.e. LaS(r)3Co(1.5)Fe(1.5)O(10-delta), which possesses significantly higher electrocatalytic activity, considerably lower over-potential and Tafel slope, remarkably higher mass activity (MA) and specific activity (SA) together with a better long-term stability than the undoped parent perovskite, the state-of-the-art IrO2 and the most active Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) under harsh OER cycling conditions in alkaline solution. These merits mainly originate from the presence of partial oxidation of surface Co3+ to Co4+ in LaSr3Co1.5Fe1.5O10-delta, an appropriate possible structure-dependent position of O p-band centre to the Fermi level and an increased amount of highly oxidative oxygen species O-2(2-)/O- in conjunction with a strong OH- adsorption and O-2 desorption abilities. These findings not only improve the electrocatalytic activities of the layered perovskite family via optimal doping but also highlight the potential application of LaSr3Co1.5Fe1.5O10-delta as an earth-abundant, cost-effective, highly active and durable electrocatalyst for OER in energy conversion and storage technologies.									54	4	0	0	4	0	57			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000411687800014

This paper reports a facile preparation of 3D hierarchical flower-like P-doped Ni-Fe disulfide microspheres by successive hydrothermal and one-step phosphosulfidation, using P2S5 as a source of phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S). Owing to the synergistic effect of the binary metal system, the introduction of P, and unique 3D porous architecture, the flower-like P-doped Ni-Fe disulfide microspheres deliver outstanding OER performance-an overpotential of 264 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a significantly low Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1), and excellent long-term durability over 50 h with negligible degradation in alkaline media. The fabrication method applied in this study can provide a new facile approach to the design and synthesis of P-doped metal sulfide materials for various electrochemical applications.									15	2	0	0	0	0	15			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000621172800005

We studied the effect of an electrolytic bath pH on the electrodeposition of Pb- Co coatings, and the coating properties were analyzed. The pH was varied from 1 to 6 for a solution without and with ascorbic acid as complexing agent. Cathodic polarization curves show that the deposition conditions have a greater effect on the reduction potential of Co2+ than the reduction potential of Pb2+. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer analysis shows that a pH higher than 4 promotes Co deposition and yields a [Pb]/[Co] film ratio lower than 1. Scanning electron micrographs showed that samples grown at a pH higher than 2 were covered with Co dendrites, and that the sample grown with ascorbic acid at pH 1 exhibited a compact morphology. Anodic polarization curves showed that Pb-Co-coated anodes grown at pH 1 with a complexing agent evolved oxygen at c.a. 1.6 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode, which lead to a 40% reduction in the required overpotential (eta) for the oxygen-evolution reaction compared with conventional Pb-Ca-Sn anodes.

In this work, an in situ N doping strategy was demonstrate to boost the efficiency and stability of nickel molybdenum sulfide both in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that such modification offers enriched active sites for electrochemical reaction, and further increases the kinetic driven force of water electrolysis. As a result, the N -NiMoS electrode exhibits a remarkably improved performance with rather low potential of 1.54 V to offer a current density of 10 mA cm -2 for overall water splitting, which is 130 mV decrease than that of pristine one. In addition, impressive electrochemical stability also reveals a 76.6% preservation of initial current density after 100 h test, which is superior than that of pristine one after 25 h test. Therefore, the potential to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts by as-proposed route promises a valuable way to develop efficient catalysts with enhanced property for electrochemical applications.

Here we introduce a new route to produce an efficient catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that is made by ball milling and sintering. By using Se as a grinding aid, the bulk electrode Ni1-xFexSe1.15 is obtained with high porosity and robust mechanical strength after sintering. Active Ni1-xFex layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets are subsequently produced on the surface of the Ni1-xFexSe1.15 by in situ electrochemical oxidation. Compared with traditional synthesis methods, the new process displays superior advantages, such as producing an electrode that is substrate-free and exhibits robust mechanical strength as well as being cost-effective for mass production. Additionally, V- and Mn-doped Ni0.75Fe0.25-LDH exhibit comparable and competent OER performance in 1 M KOH solution. Ni0.71V0.04Fe0.25-LDH achieves current densities of 100 and 1000 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 244 and 300 mV, respectively. This work demonstrates a promising way to synthesize highly efficient and robust electrocatalysts for water oxidation.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000486360500033	31424186

Herein, a novel approach involving an in-situ transformation of Co(OH)(2) nanosheets into NH4CoPO4 center dot H2O nanoplates on Co foil is reported. As a 3D self-supported oxygen revolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst, the as-prepared NH4CoPO4 center dot H2O/Co exhibits remarkable catalytic activity and exceptional stability. Specifically, it can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a quite low overpotential of 254 mV with a small Tafel slope of 64.4 mV dec(-1) in alkaline electrolyte. Through experimental study and theoretical analysis, the excellent OER performance can be attributed to enriched exposed active sites, favorable electron/proton transfer and mass transport, and its unique asymmetric local atomic and electronic structure. Thus, this present research not only provides a practicable in-situ transformation strategy to design 3D self-supported electrocatalysts, but also enlightens a new way of developing transition-metal phosphates for efficient and stable water oxidation at atomic level.

Research work has indicated that the presence of phosphorus could lead to the formation of a phosphide/(hydro)-oxide core/shell structure. In this work, we have developed a fabrication technique for a robust NiOOH@amorphous Ni-P bilayer on a zirconia mesh support through the collaboration of electroless deposition and robocasting. During the electroless deposition, a fully amorphous structure can be obtained with a certain phosphorus content (7-8 wt %). Relatively thick films (in the order of 5 mu m) had an excellent adhesion on the mesh structure because of the large curvature. A stable Ni oxy/hydroxide surface (similar to 200 nm) can be formed in bilayer nature (NiOOH/Ni-P) due to preactivation. The combination of catalyst active sites on the surface and high conductivity of metallic body enables good OER performance with an overpotential of 286 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Together with excellent chemical stability and mechanical strength of the ceramic substrate, this novel combination gives rather excellent adhesion and stability in alkaline solution and provides a different angle for the hierarchical design of corrosion resistant and high-performance OER electrodes for industry.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000444793000030	30117733

Herein, we report alcogel electrolysis technique to prepare nickel cobalt alloy nanoparticles in silica matrix and then growth of carbon nanostructured material by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method for its application towards electrochemical catalysis of oxygen evolution reaction. The growth conditions of carbon nanostructures specially multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and carbon onions are tuned by controlling the temperature of CVD. It is found that MWCNTs at temperature of 650 degrees C are preferentially formed while carbon onions are formed predominantly at 750 degrees C. The onion like carbon formed on Ni-Co alloy nanostructures at temperature of 750 degrees C is attributed to over growth of NiCo alloy nanoparticles achievable at higher temperatures. The diameter of MWCNTs were found to be in the range of 5-25 nm while carbon onions in the range 50-100 nm as revealed by TEM studies after etching silica particles by HF. The oxygen evolution reaction activity of the sample synthesized at 750 degrees C was found to be inferior than exhibited by MWCNTs formed at 650 degrees C which was possibly due to the presence of bigger size carbon onions having a less surface area. The overpotential exhibited by NiCo-MWCNTs is 340 mV which is just 35 mV higher than bench mark Ir/C catalyst. The better OER performance exhibited by NiCo-MWCNTs is devoted to encapsulated nickel-cobalt alloy particles by well graphitized carbon layers, defective side walls of nanotubes and oxygenated functional groups (C=O, C-O) which are proven active sites for OER.									26	1	0	0	0	0	26			2053-1591			WOS:000487739500001

Meanwhile, charge transfer engineering is an efficient approach to modulate the localized electronic properties of catalysts and tune the electrocatalytic performance. Herein, we tactfully fabricate PtFeNi alloys/NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) heterostructure by an easily electrochemical way with a small amount of Pt. The experimental and theoretical results unravel that the charge transfer on the alloy clusters modulated by the defective substrates (NiFe LDHs), which synergistically optimizes the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates. The electrocatalyst exhibits an ultra-low overpotential of 81 and 243 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution, respectively. Furthermore, the overall water splitting indicates that PtFeNi alloys/NiFe LDHs presents an ultra-low overpotential of 265 and 406 mV to reach the current density of 10 and 300 mA cm(-2), respectively. It proves that the PtFeNi alloys/NiFe LDHs catalyst is an excellent dual-function electrocatalyst for water splitting and promising for industrialization. This work provides a new electrochemical approach to construct the alloy heterostructure. The prepared heterostructures act as an ideal platform to investigate the charge re-distribution behavior and to improve the electrocatalytic activity.

The IrO2/CNT catalyst was prepared from iridium complex and COOH-CNT by hydrothermal method. The synthesized IrO2/CNT catalysts was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, Raman microscopy, Fourier transfer-infrared spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and electrochemical methods. The average particle size of the IrO2 particles on CNT is 1.7 nm and the loading amount of IrO2 is 4 wt%. The XPS measurement reveals that Ir complex was completely converted to iridium oxide through hydrothermal treatment. The IrO2/CNT catalyst showed sufficient performance for OER activity and durability in sulfuric acid solution.

Here it is shown that for films produced by using BaF2 as a source material, the post-annealing procedure can be closely controlled by monitoring the F that evolves due to the water vapor reaction with BaF2. The use of an ion-sensitive electrode allowed small F evolution rates (about 1 ng s-1) to be detected above background, sufficient to measure the F evolution rate from even the smallest samples used. The time interval during which F evolves was found to increase with increasing YBCO film area being annealed.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0896-1107			WOS:A1992JP91100012

Moreover, it is urgently needed to develop highly efficient noble metal-free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts to accelerate the development of overall water splitting green energy conversion systems. Herein, a facile and cost-efficient strategy to synthesize Co9S8 nanoparticles-embedded N/S-codoped carbon nanofibers (Co9S8/NSCNFs) as highly active OER catalyst is developed. The hybrid precursor of core-shell ZIF-wrapped CdS nanowires is first prepared and then leads to the formation of uniformly dispersed Co9S8/N, S-codoped carbon nanocomposites through a one-step calcination reaction. The optimal Co9S8/NSCNFs-850 is demonstrated to possess excellent electrocatalytic performance for OER in 1.0 m KOH solution, affording a low overpotential of 302mV to reach the current density of 10mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 54mV dec(-1), and superior long-term stability for 1000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. The favorable results raise a concept of exploring more MOF-based nanohybrids as precursors to induce the synthesis of novel porous nanomaterials as non-noble-metal electrocatalysts for sustainable energy conversion.									99	6	0	0	6	0	99			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000434172700010	29665268

Firstly, trimetallic Ni-Fe-Co (oxy) hydroxides have been electrodeposited on CFC support (NiFeCo/CFC). Secondly, a solvothermal selenization process has been used to convert NiFeCo/CFC into NiFeCoSex/CFC using N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent. The composition and homogeneous distribution of NiFeCoSex/CFC nanoparticles are determined by XRD, XPS, SEM elemental mapping and EDX images. Furthermore, SEM images reveal that NiFeCoSex/CFC has volcano-shaped morphology with rough surface and homogenously distributed on the surface of CFC, which may provide more active sites for OER. The electrochemical measurements show that trimetallic NiFeCoSex/CFC possesses the better electrocatalytic activity with the lower overpotential (150 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), Tafel slope (85 mV dec(-1)), larger double-layer capacitance (200 mF cm(-2)) and long-term stability than unary or binary metal selenides. The enhanced activity of NiFeCoSex/CFC may be attributed to the trimetallic Ni-Fe-Co selenides and selenides-CFC synergistic interaction. It may offer a promising way to design transition multimetallic selenides supported on conductive support as electrocatalysts for OER. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, we report a facile onepot ethyleneglycol (EG) mediated solvothermal synthesis of orthorhombic Co2P with particle size similar to 20-30 nm as an efficient HER and OER catalysts. Synthesis parameters like various solvents, temperatures, precursors ratios, and reaction time influences the formation of phase pure Co2P. Investigation of Co2P as an electrocatalyst for HER in acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) and alkaline medium (1.0 M KOH), furnishes low overpotential of 178 mV and 190 mV, respectively to achieve a 10mA cm similar to 2 current density with a long term stability and durability. As an OER catalyst in 1.0 M KOH, Co2P shows an overpotential of 364 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density. Investigation of Co2P NP by XPS analysis after OER stability test under alkaline medium confirms the formation of amorphous cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) as an intermediate during OER process.

Here, we present a novel Ni5P4/N-doped carbon@CoFeP/N-doped carbon composite (Ni5P4/NC@CoFeP/NC) as electrocatalysts for OER. This elaborate structure consists of Ni5P4/NC derived from Ni-MOF and CoFeP/NC derived from CoFe-Prussian blue analog MOF (Co-Fe PBA). The cube-like CoFeP/NC are scattered and uniformly coated on the sheet of Ni5P4/NC flowers. Among them, NC can enhance the conductivity of phosphides, while CoFeP/NC can increase the electrochemical active area, which benefit the properties of Ni5P4/NC@CoFeP/NC. Notably, the Ni5P4/NC@CoFeP/NC catalyst possesses outstanding OER performances with a low overpotential of 260 and 303 mV at a current density of 10 and 100 mA center dot cmxe003;2, an ultra-low Tafel slope of 31.1 mV center dot dec1 and excellent stability in 1 M KOH. XPS analysis shows that proper chemical composition promotes the oxidation of transition metal species and the chemisorption of OH-, thus accelerating the OER kinetics. Therefore, this work provides a hopeful method for designing and preparing transition metal phosphide/carbon composite as OER electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0021-9797	1095-7103		WOS:000793342200010	35303642

Here, a uniform deposition of Ru nanoparticles strongly interacting with oxygen-rich carbon nanotube architectures (Ru-OCNT) through ozonation and hydrothermal approaches has been designed. The hierarchical structure of Ru-OCNT is made by self-assembly of oxygen functionalities of OCNT. Ru nanoparticles interact strongly with OCNT at the Ru/OCNT interface to give excellent catalytic activity and stability of the Ru-OCNT, as further confirmed by density functional theory. Owing to the hierarchical structure and adjusted surface chemistry, Ru-OCNT has an overpotential of 34 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 27.8 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, and an overpotential of 55 mV with Tafel slope of 33 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4. The smaller Tafel slope of Ru-OCNT than Ru-CNT and commercial Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes indicates high catalytic activity and fast charge transfer kinetics. The as-proposed chemistry provides the rational design of hierarchically structured CNT/nanoparticle electrocatalysts for HER to produce hydrogen fuel.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000659695800001	33999455

Much effort has been devoted to understanding the surface reconstruction, but little on identifying the origin of the enhanced performance derived from the substrate effect. Herein, we report the electrochemical synthesis of amorphous CoOOH layers on the surface of various cobalt sulfides (CoS alpha), and identify that the reduced intermolecular energy gap (Delta(inter)) between the valence band maximum (VBM) of CoOOH and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of CoS alpha can accelerate the formation of OER-active high-valent Co4+ species. The combination of electrochemical and in situ spectroscopic approaches, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), operando electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Raman, reveals that Co species in the CoOOH/Co9S8 are more readily oxidized to CoO2/Co9S8 than in CoOOH and other CoOOH/CoS alpha. This work provides a new design principle for transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000797548100001	35037704

Herein, by a facile composite electrodeposition method, an electrocatalyst with Mo particles anchored on the Ni-P matrix (Mo/Ni-P) was fabricated and utilized for urea-assisted water electrolysis of hydrogen production. As expected, the urea-involved electrolytic cell with the as-obtained Mo/Ni-P served as both the anode and cathode merely needs a voltage of 1.55 V to sustain a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) (0.16 V less than that of the conventional water splitting at 50 mA cm(-2)) and can maintain the stability for 12 h. Additionally, the solar-driven urea-assisted water electrolysis system was constructed under lab conditions and solar-hydrogen-electricity energy conversion processes were also simulated. Moreover, it was demonstrated that tungsten (W) particles can also serve as an accelerant for promotion both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UOR activity of pristine Ni-P.

The adsorption free energy can be optimized by modulating the electronic structure and adjusting the crystal configuration. Meanwhile, the transformation of the active phase can be promoted by introducing strain energy. The theoretical calculations are conducted to verify the rational envisage. However, it is still a great obstacle to introducing strain into the electrocatalysts and avoiding destruction. The stress field caused by dislocation can realize both of the above. Hence, the molten salt with the bound water method is proposed and the abundant dislocation layered double hydroxides (D-NiFe LDH) are constructed. The in situ characterizations further verify the dislocations significantly affect the generation of the active phase and the state of electronic structure. Consequently, the D-NiFe LDH exhibits outstanding OER activity and obtains 10 mA cm(-2), only requiring 199 mV overpotential with fabulous stability (100 mA cm(-2) more than 24 h). The work paves a new avenue for the rational introduction dislocations to optimize the crystal configuration and boost the active phase formation, significantly enhancing the OER performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000836886900001	35931456

Here, we report a sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine/carbon nanotube hybrid (CoPc-SO3H/CNT) prepared by a facile anchoring method along with sonication and magnetic stirring. The resulting CoPc-SO3H/CNT hybrid exhibits better catalytic activity for ORRs and OERs than the cobalt phthalocyanine/carbon nanotube hybrid (CoPc/CNT), sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc-SO3H), cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) and the carbon nanotube (CNT). The onset potential of CoPc-SO3H/CNT for the ORR in 0.1 M KOH is 0.88 V (vs. RHE), which is higher than that of CoPc/CNT (0.85 V), the CNT (0.80 V), CoPc-SO3H (0.77 V) and CoPc (0.66 V). Meanwhile, the CoPc-SO3H/CNT hybrid shows a much lower OER potential (1.62 V) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) compared to CoPc-SO3H (1.64 V), CoPc/CNT (1.74 V), the CNT (1.96 V) and CoPc (>2.00 V) in 1 M KOH. Similar patterns are also found in 0.1 M KOH solution. Both the conductive CNT and the electron-withdrawing sulfonic groups are confirmed to benefit the electrochemical oxygen reactions (ORRs/OERs).									21	1	0	0	1	0	21			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000499996800012	31710322

This paper proposes a simple one-step synthetic strategy for preparing self-supported Cu2Se/NiSe2 heteronanostructure electrodes for the OER with well-defined heterointerfaces by directly embedding onto the conductive nickel foam substrate. The prepared catalyst significantly enhances OER activity with low overpotentials of 277 and 290 mV at current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, which is attributed to electronic structure modulation by synergetic interactions and enhanced charge transportation between Cu2Se and NiSe2 nanostructures. The as-prepared electrodes achieved high durability in 1 M KOH, retaining initial activity levels after 24 h continuous operation. We performed comprehensive spectroscopic and microscopic characterization before and after the OER to clarify active species and relate them to OER catalysis. Enhanced catalyst efficiency arises from integrating multicomponent electrocatalytic systems, which has been emphasized by the present findings.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2168-0485			WOS:000703351200039

In this paper, pressure variations inside the cell for the gaseous hydrogen version are analyzed and correlated with oxygen evolution side reaction at the end of charging, the recombination of oxygen with hydrogen during charging and a subsequent rest period, and the self-discharge of the nickel electrode. About 70% of the recombination occurred simultaneously with oxygen evolution during charging and the remaining oxygen recombined with hydrogen during the 1st hour after charging. Self-discharge of the cell varies linearly with hydrogen pressure at a given state of charge and increased with increasing battery charge levels. The coulometric efficiency calculated based on analysis of the pressure-time data agreed well with the efficiency calculated based on the current-time data. Pressure variations in the battery are simulated accurately to predict coulometric efficiency and the state of charge of the cell, factors of extreme importance for a battery intended for implantation within the human body.

Raman mapping characterisation is performed, revealing that the structure of basal plane graphene is damaged due to the electrochemical perturbation of the OER. Electrochemical perturbation, in the form of electrochemical potential scanning (linear sweep voltammetry), and a thorough comparison of the OER at different scan rates and chronoamperometry tests at different voltages, create active edge plane sites/defects upon the basal plane graphene surface in the case of the mono- and few- layer graphene electrodes. The electrochemical performance gradually decreases with consecutive OER scans upon a given graphene electrode, with the process damaging the basal plane graphene sheet, after which there is a loss in the electrochemical signal due to a loss in electrically conductive pathways. Importantly, the severity of these changes is dependent on the potential and chosen scan rate that is applied to the graphene electrode. In contrast, however, multilayer graphene's initial performance towards the OER process improves after the first few scans, which is likely due to an increase in the coverage of edge plane sites/defects and its underlying layers maintaining electrical contact. This work indicates the importance of the scan rate and potential limits applied to graphene electrodes in addition to the relationship between the number of layers and structural integrity. This new knowledge is of fundamental importance to be advantageously applied within the energy sector and beyond.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2196-0216			WOS:000496539000013

During the nitrogen fixation phase, depression in light-dependent oxygen evolution results from alterations in the state of Q(A)/Q(B) complex. The reaction centre in photosystem II is not oxidised efficiently. Light dependence of nitrogenase function under such conditions appears to be related to the coupling of photosystem I to endogenous electron donors, such as glycollate.

Ershov, Boris G./0000-0002-3253-1127			Important role of seawater radiolysis of the World Ocean in the chemical evolution of the early Earth								RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY				193						109959	10.1016/j.radphyschem.2022.109959				APR 2022	2022	It is generally recognized that the evolution of early Earth was affected by an external energy source: radiation from the early Sun. We also propose and substantiate the hypothesis of important role of natural radioactivity, as an internal energy source, in the evolution of early Earth. Radioactive isotopes have been present on Earth since its formation. The decay of long-lived Th-232, U-238, U-238, and K-40 was an important source of energy and, together with accretion of interplanetary matter and the action of gravitational forces, it promoted melting and differ-entiation of matter and tectonic activity of early Earth. At the same time, radioactive isotopes initiated radiation -chemical transformations of the Earth's matter and contributed to the chemical evolution of the planet. The initial content of radioactive isotopes in the World Ocean of the early Earth and the kinetics of their decay, the values of the absorbed dose and dose rate, as well as the efficiency of seawater radiolysis as a function of time are calculated. It is shown that the decay of long-lived isotopes initiated radiation chemical reactions of compounds dissolved in the ocean and gave rise to oxygen. The ocean served as a "reservoir " that collected components of the early atmosphere and products of their transformations and simultaneously as a "converter " in which further chemical reactions of these compounds took place. The chemical transformations of dissolved inorganic com-pounds boosted interrelated processes important for evolution: formation of organic matter, including prebiotic molecules, purification of the ocean, and oxygenation of hydro-and atmosphere of Earth. As a result, ocean became the "cradle " for the emergence of life. Radical mechanisms for the formation of simple amino acids, sugars, and nitrogen bases, i.e., the key structures of all living matter, were proposed. The amounts of organic matter and oxygen accumulated with time were calculated; the results confirmed the role of natural radioactivity in the evolution of Earth's matter and the emergence of life. We expect that this hypothesis would become the starting point for considering the important role of natural radioactivity and radiation-chemical processes in the general picture of Earth's evolution and emergence of life.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0969-806X	1879-0895		WOS:000789666200001

Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel core-shell trimetallic Ni0.70Fe0.10V0.20S2 @ amorphous NiFe hydroxide for enhancing OER kinetics using thermal sulfidation and in situ electrochemical tuning methods. Electrochemical testing of various as-prepared catalysts at the same mass loading demonstrated that the trimetallic Ni0.70Fe0.10V0.20S2 @ amorphous NiFe hydroxide possessed the highest intrinsic activity for the OER compared to other reference catalysts. Furthermore, the heterostructures are directly grown on a carbon paper with a high surface area and good conductivity to form an integrated 3D electrode with an overpotential of 204 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. This is one of the most effective OER electrocatalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy indicated that the material structure and chemical composition of Ni0.70Fe0.10V0.20S2 @ amorphous NiFe hydroxide exhibited good stability under harsh OER conditions. These advantages could be mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between the core and shell, high electronic conductivity of the core, and more active sites on the surface of the amorphous shell.

On a cyclic voltammogram (CV) several characteristic areas can be distinguished: at the anode region of the CV at potentials higher than 1.4 V, the anode current is growing exponentially due to the simultaneous reactions of Pb(II) oxidation and the evolution of oxygen. At the cathodic branch of a CV, a current maximum is observed at potentials of 1.0-1.2 V, corresponding to the reaction of the reduction of lead dioxide. If the polyaminoguanidine hydrochloride is present in the electrolyte, the electrodeposition of lead dioxide is inhibited. If the anionic polymer additive Nafion (R) is in the electrolyte, one can see an increase in the peak of cathodic reduction of lead dioxide, which indicates an increase in the formation rate of PbO2. The addition to the electrolyte of anionic surfactants leads to a slight inhibition of the process of deposition of PbO2. As one can see from the experimental data, the adsorption of anionic surfactants is described satisfactorily by the Langmuir isotherm. Values of the limiting adsorption and the adsorption equilibrium constant were calculated. According to the results obtained, the anionic surfactants, cationic polyelectrolyte polyaminoguanidine hydrochloride and anionic polyelectrolyte Nafion (R) can be used as additives to the electrolyte during the deposition of the lead dioxide. It has been established, that they are being included into the growing deposit by forming the composite coatings with different composition and various electrocatalytic activity in the reaction of the evolution of oxygen. The content of organic compound in the oxide can vary from 2 to 16 w.%, a surfactant-oxide and polyelectrolyte-oxide composite coating is formed. The overpotential of the oxygen evolution decreases in the line C4F9SO3K> C12H25O4SNa> C16H29O6SNa. It should be noted that the energy of adsorption on PbO2 increases in the same line.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2306-871X	2313-4984		WOS:000483180400010

In this study, an n-type cubic In2O3 semiconductor is employed for the first time to load IrOx species (Ir-In2O3 mass ratio: 17.6 %). Consequently, the IrOx@In2O3 heterojunction, which exhibits outstanding OER performance promoted by weak-light irradiation, is formed. Notably, IrOx (approximately 1.7 nm in size) and In2O3 are observed to crystallize independently during heterogeneous nucleation with no Ir atoms doped in the In2O3 lattice. This avoids Ir loss and ensures the full exposure of all Ir-based sites. The IrOx@In2O3 heterojunction exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic water oxidation with overpotential values of 190 and 231 mV at current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2), surpassing all IrOx-based catalyst results reported to date. Nano-sized IrOx on the surface, irradiated by the weak-light beam of LED-365 (1.8 mW cm(-2)), can be fully activated as an OER site. Moreover, the overpotential is further reduced to 176 and 210 mV to deliver the corresponding current. This work is anticipated to aid in the design of more efficient multi-field coupling OER systems.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000726888700058	34591342

The following work presents the design of a new electrode which is composed by deposited cobalt octaethylporphyrin onto glassy carbon and graphene, where both carbonaceous materials have been electrochemically oxidized prior to the porphyrin deposition. The novel generated system is stable and has an electrocatalytic effect towards the oxygen reduction reaction, as a result of the significant overpotential shift in comparison to the unmodified electrode and to the electrodes used as target. Kinetic studies corroborate that the system is capable of reducing molecular oxygen via four electrons, with a Tafel slope value of 60 mV per decade. The systems were morphologically characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies showed that the electrode previously oxidized and modified with cobalt porphyrin is the system that possesses lower resistance to charge transfer and higher capacitance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2073-4344			WOS:000454711500061

Herein, a composite based on FeSe2@CoSe2 particles supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was successfully prepared as an OER catalyst. In the catalyst, the CoSe2 phase was located on the FeSe2 surface, forming a large number of exposed heterointerfaces with acidic iron sites because of strong charge interaction between CoSe2 and FeSe2. It is believed that the exposed heterointerfaces act as catalytic active sites for OER via a two-site mechanism, manifesting an overpotential as low as 260 mV to reach the current density of 10 inA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH and excellent stability for at least 6 h, which is superior to those of CoSe2/rGO, FeSe2/rGO, as well as most of the FeNi- and FeCo-based electrocatalysts reported in recent literatures. It was demonstrated that the most optimal composite electrocatalysts release more Fe species into the electrolyte during the OER process, whereas the releasing of Co species is negligible. When the FeSe2@CoSe2/rGO catalysts were loaded on a alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode, the photocurrent density was increased by three times. These results may open up a promising avenue into the design and engineering of highly active and durable catalysts for water oxidation.									103	3	0	0	4	0	104			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000434895500091	29741088	
J	Allen, J. P.; Williams, J. C.								The evolutionary pathway from anoxygenic to oxygenic photosynthesis examined by comparison of the properties of photosystem II and bacterial reaction centers								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				107	1			59	69		10.1007/s11120-010-9552-x				JAN 2011	2011	In photosynthetic organisms, such as purple bacteria, cyanobacteria, and plants, light is captured and converted into energy to create energy-rich compounds. The primary process of energy conversion involves the transfer of electrons from an excited donor molecule to a series of electron acceptors in pigment-protein complexes. Two of these complexes, the bacterial reaction center and photosystem II, are evolutionarily related and structurally similar. However, only photosystem II is capable of performing the unique reaction of water oxidation. An understanding of the evolutionary process that lead to the development of oxygenic photosynthesis can be found by comparison of these two complexes. In this review, we summarize how insight is being gained by examination of the differences in critical functional properties of these complexes and by experimental efforts to alter pigment-protein interactions of the bacterial reaction center in order to enable it to perform reactions, such as amino acid and metal oxidation, observable in photosystem II.									27	0	0	0	22	0	26			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000286199300005	20449659

Although copper and nickel are known to be bifunctional catalysts for ORR and OER, sluggish reactions as a result of the exceptionally strong O=O bond on the metal surface make it difficult to achieve high system efficiency. In this study, a metal carbide layer (CuCx and NiCx) on dendritic copper and nickel is fabricated by a facile electrodeposition process to provide efficient catalytic active sites with moderate binding energy for easy electron transfer in both the OER and the ORR. The dendritic structure provides an enriched catalytic surface and the protective metal carbide layer offers an appropriate O binding energy and durability of Zn-air batteries. Owing to the presence of the stable metal carbide surface on the dendritic metal, the CuCx/Cu and NiCx/Ni catalysts exhibited well-defined limiting current densities of -5.19 and -5.11 mA cm(-2), respectively, and improved ORR and OER activities with lower polarization than the corresponding metal catalysts. Density functional theory revealed a 0.74 eV decrease in the overpotential of NiCx/Ni-catalyzed OER reactions compared with Ni-catalyzed OER reactions. The experimental and theoretical results prove that carbide layers on dendritic metal surfaces can greatly improve the activity of ORR and OER bifunctional electrocatalysts for Zn-air batteries.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000453766400004	30381898

However, their underlying catalytic reaction kinetics, particularly under catalyst surface defect and practical acidic conditions, have been rarely studied. In this work, ORR reaction kinetics on PtCu (111) are systematically studied using Density Functional Theory (DFT) analysis. Clean PtCu (111), defective PtCu (11 1)-DF and H atoms covered H-PtCu (1 1 1)-DF models were considered to investigate the effect of surface defects and H coverage on ORR reaction kinetics. In addition, the solvent effect (hydronium) was considered in this work to model a more realistic acidic reaction condition. The results show that defective PtCu (1 1 1)-DF surface is more active than clean PtCu (1 1 1), and ORR reaction proceeds with the peroxyl dissociation pathway on the two clean surfaces. However, when H coverage is considered on the PtCu (1 1 1)-DF surface, the ORR follows the oxygen dissociation pathway. Furthermore, when both H coverage and solvent effect were taken into consideration, the existence of hydronium can effectively facilitate the protonation of OH* and O* thus promoting the ORR reaction. The present study reveals that consideration of acidic conditions is essential in the study of ORR reaction mechanism and activity prediction for Pt-metal alloy catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000729147300007

However, it still remains a formidable challenge to efficiently induce the reconstruction of OER catalysts toward enhanced electrocatalytic performance. In this work, a novel and simple 2-methylimidazole (2-MIM) treatment approach is demonstrated to promote the electrochemical reconstruction of cobalt layered double hydroxides. The 2-MIM modification enables an effective transformation into amorphous cobalt (oxy)hydroxides with abundant oxgen vacancies, which could afford enlarged electrochemical active surface and more active sites. As a result, the overpotential of the activated catalyst after in situ electrochemical reconstruction at 10 mA cm(2) is reduced by similar to 60 mV compared with that of the original counterpart. The present 2-MIM-assisted in situ electrochemical reconstruction strategy provide a fresh impetus for developing superior OER catalysts.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664247600006

All the oxygen in the atmosphere is derived from this reaction, and without it the biosphere, as we know it, would not exist. Indeed, the appearance of this catalytic center similar to 3 billion years ago gave rise to the "big bang of evolution". Thus, understanding the structure and functioning of this metal cluster is a major topic in science, and here I discuss it in terms of research that has occurred over the past 12 years dating back to when it was first proposed to be a Mn3CaO4 cubane with the fourth Mn attached to cubane by one of its oxo bridging bonds. Since then, a number of. novel properties have emerged for this metalloprotein with implications for its catalytic mechanism and evolutionary origin.									29	1	0	0	7	0	29			0006-2960			WOS:000386422100002	27704798
