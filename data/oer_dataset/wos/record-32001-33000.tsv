J	Shutilova, NI								On the mechanism of photosynthetic oxidation of water in a dimeric oxygen-evolving complex of chloroplasts photosystem II								BIOFIZIKA				45	1			51	57						JAN-FEB 2000	2000	Based on the analysis of the molecular organization and properties of an isolated oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II of plant chloroplasts, a mechanism of water oxidation and oxygen release during photosynthesis was proposed. It is suggested that the photolysis of water occurs in a dimeric oxygen-evolving complex consisting of two core complexes. In the region of contact of these complexes, a hydrophobic <<boiler>> is formed where the conditions for screening and stabilization of Z-linanded manganese cations accumulating positive charges for the oxidation of water molecules are created. A prerequisite to the photolysis of water is the formation of a binuclear [Mn3+-OH ... HO-Mn3+] hydroxyl-manganese associate, which appears in the dimeric oxygen-evolving complex after the first two light flashes as a result of photohydrolysis of photochemically oxidized Z-liganded manganese cations, The process is accompanied by the release of the first water protons to the medium. The photosynthetic oxidation of water hydroxyls occurs at the next stage and is considered as synchronous detachment of four electrons from two bound OH-groups of the associate upon photooxidation of Mn3+ cations to Mn4+ cations after two subsequent light flashes, This process is accompanied by the disproportionation of electron density and the formation of a bond between oxygen atoms of hydroxyls followed by the evolution of molecular oxygen and protons, and regeneration of two starting Mn2+ cations and the primary state of the system.									4	0	1	0	2	0	4			0006-3029			WOS:000085697200007	10732210	
J	Ibraheem, Shumaila; Chen, Siguo; Li, Jia; Wang, Qingmei; Wei, Zidong								In situ growth of vertically aligned FeCoOOH-nanosheets/nanoflowers on Fe,N co-doped 3D-porous carbon as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for rechargeable zinc-O-2 batteries								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				7	16			9497	9502		10.1039/c9ta01964b				APR 28 2019	2019	Rational design of cost effective, highly active and robust bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER/ORR) is crucial for rechargeable metal-air batteries. Encapsulating and supporting transition-metal nanomaterials for the OER in and on porous carbon-based catalysts for the ORR are the two main routes for the construction of bifunctional OER/ORR catalysts. However, none of the above two strategies has achieved simultaneous maximum exposure of OER and ORR active sites, while maintaining high catalytic stability. In this study, it is demonstrated that transition-metal oxide nanosheets/nanoflowers in situ vertically grown on Fe, N co-doped 3D-porous carbon (FeCoOOH-NS/NF perpendicular to 3D-FeNC) can achieve the simultaneous maximum exposure of both OER and ORR active centers. Benefiting from this unique vertical growth structure, the FeCoOOH-NF perpendicular to 3D-FeNC catalyst demonstrates an outstanding half wave potential of 855 mV for the ORR and a low overpotential of only 230 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER, ranking it among the most active non-noble metal bifunctional OER/ORR catalysts reported in the literature. Remarkably, when being employed as an O-2 electrode in primary and rechargeable zinc-O-2 batteries, FeCoOOH-NF perpendicular to 3D-FeNC presents a higher power density of 220 mW cm(-2) than that of Pt/C + IrO2 (190 mW cm(-2)) as well as excellent cycling durability.									40	2	0	0	2	0	40			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000467249200008

Previous studies mainly focus on the modulation of their electronic structures, which undoubtedly optimizes the electronic properties, but is not the only determinant of performance in practical applications. Herein, we propose a generalized strategy to incrementally manipulate the architectures of several atomically thin transition metal (hydr)oxides, and study their effects on catalytic water oxidation. The results demonstrate the obvious superiority of a wrinkled nanosheet architecture in both catalytic activity and durability. For instance, wrinkled Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets display a low overpotential of 358.2 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a high current density of 187.2 mA cm(-2) at 500 mV, a small Tafel slope of 54.4 mV dec(-1), and excellent long-term durability with gradually optimized performance, significantly outperforming other nanosheet architectures and previously reported catalysts. The outstanding catalytic performance is mainly attributable to the 3D porous network structure constructed by wrinkled nanosheets, which not only provides sufficient contact between electrode materials and current collector, but also offers highly accessible channels for facile electrolyte diffusion and efficient O-2 escape. Our study provides a perspective on improving the performance of graphene-like nanomaterials in a wide range of practical applications.									47	0	0	0	1	0	47			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000426615600100	29361233

In the present study, Eu(III)-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3) nanoparticles were synthesized and their catalytic activities were demonstrated to examine the roles of dopants in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, photocatalytic organic pollutant degradation and photoelectrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. The fundamental properties were characterized by X-ray diffraction crystallography, scanning electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, UV-visible absorption, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). CO2 reduction products were observed to be mainly methanol, CO and CH4 with minor C-2 compounds. Photocatalytic dye degradation showed the order of methyl orange < rhodamine B < methylene blue. The catalytic performances were found to be dependent on the Eu doping levels. Photoelectrocatalytic activities were tested by linear sweep voltammetry under 395 nm light which corresponds to the direct L-5(6) <- F-7(0) transition of Eu(III). Consequently, undoped SrTiO3 showed the highest enhancement in current density. Eu(III) ion was appeared to be initially doped in Sr(II) site confirmed by photoluminescence and XPS profiles. Ti(IV) oxidation state was also impacted by Eu(III) doping. The various tests demonstrated that Eu(III)-dopant could be a very useful probe for the elucidation of local environmental site and the dopant-role on catalytic activities.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000659174100004

ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces				11	26			23125	34		10.1021/acsami.9b03624				3 July 2019	2019	Optimizing interfacial contact between graphene and a semiconductor has often been proposed as essential for improving their charge interactions. Herein, we fabricated bismuth vanadate-reduced graphene oxide (BiVO4/rGO) composites with tailored interfacial contact extents and revealed their disparate behavior in photoelectrochemical (PEC) and powder suspension (PS) water oxidation systems. BiVO4/rGO with a high rGO coverage on the BiVO4 surface (BiVO4/rGO HC) exhibited an 8-fold enhancement in the PEC photocurrent density with respect to neat BiVO4 at 0 V versus Ag/AgCl, while BiVO4/rGO with a low rGO coverage (BiVO4/ rGO LC) gave a lesser 3-fold enhancement. In contrast, BiVO4/rGO HC delivered a detrimental elfect, while BiVO4/rGO LC exhibited an enhanced performance for oxygen evolution in the PS system. The phenomenon is attributed to changes in the hydrophobicity of the BiVO4/rGO composite in conjunction with the interfacial contact configuration. A better BiVO4/rGO interfacial contact was found to improve the charge separation emciency and charge transfer ability of the composite material, explaining the superior PEC performance of BiVO4/rGO HC. Additionally, optimization of the interfacial contact extent was revealed to further improve the energetics of the composite material, as evidenced by a Fermi level shift to a more negative potential. However, the high hydrophobicity of BiVO4/rGO HC arising from the higher rGO reduction extent triggered poor water miscibility, reducing the surface wettability and therefore hampering the photocatalytic O2 evolution activity of the sample. The study underlines water miscibility as a governing issue in the PS system. copy American Chemical Society.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244			INSPEC:19841873

A unique architecture of dual-phase octahedral CoMn2O4/carbon hollow nanofibers has been prepared via a two-step heat-treatment process including preoxidation treatment and Ostwald ripening process. The hollow and porous structures provide interior void spaces, large exposed surfaces, and high contact areas between the nanofibers and electrolyte and the morphology can be engineered by adjusting the heating conditions. Due to the intimate electrical and chemical coupling between the oxide nanocrystals and integrated carbon, the dual-phase octahedral CoMn2O4/carbon hollow nanofibers exhibit excellent OER activity with overpotentials of 337 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 82 mV dec(-1). This approach will lead to the new perception of design issue for the nanoarchitecture with fine morphology, structures, and excellent electrocatalytic activity.									48	2	0	0	3	0	48			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000404986200012	28544445

Based on the cyclic voltammetry scans and voltampere relation analysis, in direct oxidation, the oxygen evolution from H2O2 decomposition was completely inhibited, and more center dot OH radicals could be then generated over PbO2/TiO2 and in the presence of powder activated carbon (PAC). PbO2/TiO2 can be indicated as an appropriate for the direct electrooxidation of ammonia in an unpacked bed reactor. While the efficiency for direct oxidation of ammonia was similar for the three anodes in a PAC packed reactor due to the presence of PAC could avoid short circuit and enhance electric efficiency. In indirect oxidation mediated by active free chlorine, Rh-Ir/TiO2 was the most effective in ammonia removal when chloride was present in the reaction system, and the disappeared ammonia was mainly transferred to N-2, and only a small part was converted into nitrate (there was no nitrite detected during the reaction). The results indicated that Rh-Ir/TiO2 had the highest oxidation capability for ammonia compared with Ta-Ir/TiO2 and PbO2/TiO2. Hence, Rh-Ir/TiO2 based on a PAC packed bed reactor provides an alternative for the treatment of ammonia wastewater with high chloride concentration.									18	1	0	0	11	0	20			0049-6979	1573-2932		WOS:000351523700006

One of the typical aspects of liquid metal refining during ESR for the advanced steel and alloy production is desulfurization. It involves two patterns, i.e., slag-metal reaction and gas-slag reaction (gasifying desulfurization). In this paper, the advances in desulfurization practices of ESR are reviewed. The effects of processing parameters, including the initial sulfur level of consumable electrode, remelting atmosphere, deoxidation schemes of ESR, slag composition, melting rate, and electrical parameters on the desulfurization in ESR are assessed. The interrelation between desulfurization and sulfide inclusion evolution during ESR is discussed, and advancements in the production of sulfur-bearing steel at a high-sulfur level during ESR are described. The remaining challenges for future work are also proposed.									13	5	0	0	0	0	13			1674-4799	1869-103X		WOS:000608742500002

Powdered non-film forms, that is, bulk OFMs exhibit excellent catalytic activities toward electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction, water splitting, and the oxygen reduction reaction. However, electrode preparation using bulk solids suffers from a range of oft-encountered difficulties, primarily limited by challenges in controlling their thickness, roughness, and particle sizes, despite early performance promises. Targeting energy sustainability, it is a matter of growing interest to directly integrate OFMs in the form of thin films onto conductive substrates. In essence, this leads to electrocatalysts with controlled features: thickness, roughness, and particle sizes. Thus far, there are only a handful of OFM thin films developed for electrocatalysis. Exploration of these understudied OFM thin films to serve electrocatalysis still lies at its infancy. This review will cover the key discoveries of OFM thin films as electrocatalysts and will critically examine the strengths, challenges, and future goals in exploring bespoke OFM thin films for electrocatalysis, under conditions that mimic real-world applications.									10	0	0	0	1	0	9			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000635801600001

However, most reported electrocatalysts work effectively in alkaline medium in which H2O2 will easily decompose into water. It is still of great challenge to develop cost-effective electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity for electrocatalytic H2O2 production in acidic media. Herein, it is first theoretically demonstrated that the adsorption energy of OOH* intermediate on carbon can be optimized by embedding Co nanoparticles (Co NPs) and tuning oxygen-containing functional groups, ensuring high activity and selectivity. Guided by density functional theory calculations, highly porous open carbon nanocages with embedded Co NPs are designed and synthesized by template-engaged method. The pyrolysis temperature can effectively modulate the electronic and pore structure of carbon nanocages. Impressively, the optimized carbon nanocages synthesized at 700 degrees C (P-Co@C-700) with highest percentage of -C-O-C group and defects, largest specific surface area (1351 m(2) g(-1)), and mesoporous structure exhibit high selectivity up to 94% toward H2O2 production in 0.1 M HClO4. Furthermore, the P-Co@C-700 nanocages display promising application for efficient electro-Fenton degradation of model organic pollutant.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000741960400001

Excessive light intensities inhibit primarily photosystem II electron transport. This results in generation of toxic singlet oxygen due to impairment of electron transport on the acceptor side between pheophytin and Q(B)-the secondary electron acceptor. High light stress also impairs electron transport on the donor side of photosystem II generating highly oxidizing species Z(+) and P680(+). A conformational change in the photosystem II reaction centre protein D1 affecting its Q(B)-binding site is involved in turning the damaged protein into a substrate for proteolysis.The evidence indicates that the degradation of D1 is an enzymatic process and the protease that degrades D1 protein has been shown to be a serine protease. Although there is evidence to indicate that the chlorophyll a-protein complex CP43 acts as a serine-type protease degrading D1, the observed degradation of D1 protein in photosystem II reaction centre particles in vitro argues against the involvement of CP43 in D1 degradation. Besides the degradation during high light stress of D1, and to a lesser extent D2-the other reaction centre protein, CP43 and CP29 have also been shown to undergo degradation.In an oxygenic environment, D1 is cleaved from its N- and C-termini and the disassembly of the photosystem II complex involves simultaneous release of manganese and three extrinsic proteins involved in oxygen evolution. It is known that protein with PEST sequences are subject to degradation; D1 protein contains a PEST sequence adjacent to the site of cleavage on the outer side of thylakoid membrane between helices IV and V.The molecular processes of ''triggering'' of D1 for proteolytic degradation are not clearly understood. The changes in structural organization of photosystem II due to generation of oxy-radicals and other highly oxidizing species have also not been resolved. Whether CP43 or a component of the photosystem II reaction centre itself (D1, D2 or cyt b559 subunits), which may be responsible for degradation of D1, is also subject to light modification to become an active protease, is also not known. The identity of proteases degrading D1, LHCII and CP43 and C29 remains to be established.									7	0	0	0	8	0	9			0250-5991	0973-7138		WOS:A1995QJ46700005

The development of effective synthetic methodologies toward G-SAMs with monodispersed metal atoms is vital for exploring their fundamental properties and potential applications. A convenient, rapid, and general strategy to synthesize a series of monodispersed atomic transition metals (for example, Co, Ni, Cu) embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene by two-second microwave (MW) heating the mixture of amine-functionalized graphene oxide and metal salts is reported here. The MW heating is able to simultaneously induce the reduction of graphene oxide, the doping of nitrogen, and the incorporation of metal atoms into the graphene lattices in one simple step. The rapid MW process minimizes metal diffusion and aggregation to ensure exclusive single metal atom dispersion in graphene lattices. Electrochemical studies demonstrate that graphene-supported Co atoms can function as highly active electrocatalysts toward the hydrogen evolution reaction. This MW-assisted method provides a rapid and efficient avenue to supported metal atoms for wide ranges of applications.									184	16	0	0	6	0	187			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000442732400017	30016001

CVD-graphene was successfully oxidized without any pores or peeling off from the substrates. When the H2SO4 concentration was increased, the electrical resistance of the oxidized graphene (OG) increased. In particular, OG-20 shows a nonlinear current-voltage curve similar to that of a diode owing to direct tunneling through the interfaces between the nanosized sp(2) and sp(3) regions. The changes in electrical properties occurred because of structural evolution. As the H2SO4 concentration increased, the number of oxygen functional groups (epoxide/hydroxyl and carboxyl groups) in the OG increased. In addition, a reduction in the average distance between defects in the OG was determined using Raman spectroscopy. Oxidation using a KMnO4/dilute H2SO4 mixture results in CVD-graphene with modified electrical properties for graphene-based applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4352		WOS:000785079700001

Chemical evolution models which accomplish this require that low-mass stars destroy He-3 in the envelope gas that they return to the interstellar medium. A simple argument based on the rates of limiting nuclear reactions shows that the same giant branch mixing process which appears to be needed to explain the observed C-12/C-13 and C/N ratios in 1-2 M. stars would indeed also probably destroy He-3 by a large factor in the bulk of the envelope material. The conclusion is that Galactic He-3/H estimates should not be trusted for setting an upper limit on primordial (D + He-3)/H. This removes the strongest lower bound on the cosmic baryon density from big bang nucleosynthesis and the only argument for abundant baryonic dark matter.									62	0	0	0	0	0	62			0004-637X			WOS:A1995QJ10300005

First-row transition metal complexes are extensively investigated for OER, but the role of these metal complexes as a true catalyst is doubtful. Some doubts have been expressed about the role of first-row transition metal complexes for OER at high overpotentials (eta > 450). Generally, the detection of the true catalyst has so far been focused on high overpotentials (eta > 450) because at low overpotentials (eta < 450), many methods are not sensitive enough to detect small amounts of heterogeneous catalysts on the electrode surface during the first seconds of the reaction. Ni(II) phthalocyanine-tetra sulfonate tetrasodium (1) is in moderate conditions (at 20-50 degrees C and pH 5-13) in the absence of electrochemical driving forces, which could make it noteworthy for OER, Herein, the results of OER in the presence of 1 at low overpotentials under alkaline conditions are presented. In addition, in the presence of Ni complexes, using an Fe ion is introduced as a new method for detecting Ni (hydr)oxide under OER. Our experiments indicate that in the presence of a homogeneous OER (pre)catalyst, a deep investigation is necessary to rule out the heterogeneous catalysts formed. Our approach is a roadmap in the field of catalysis to understand the OER mechanism in the presence of a molecular Ni-based catalyst design. Our results shown in this study are likely to open up new perspectives and discussion on many molecular catalysts in a considerable part of the chemistry community.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000790015500047	35179022

However, it suffers severely from sluggish discharge/charge kinetics. A binder-free integrated cathode is fabricated which contains NiFeRu layered double hydroxide (NiFeRu LDH) nanosheets grown on a 3D conductive graphite foam (NiFeRu LDH@GF) in this work. This integrated 3D cathode exhibits a specific capacity of 3,085 mAh g(-1) and a cycle life of 46. The electrochemical performances of NiFeRu LDH derived metal oxides (DMO@GF) by calcining NiFeRu LDH@GF at 350 degrees C, 450 degrees C, and 550 degrees C are also been investigated. The 450 degrees C obtained DMO@GF (450-DMO@GF) exhibits the highest catalytic activity for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. The unique floccule-like and cross-connected structure of the 450-DMO@GF and its low charge transfer resistance are responsible for the outstanding electrochemical performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2296-598X			WOS:000592277200001

Although a variety of theoretical and experimental studies have been carried out during the past half-century, their practical applications are still restricted by the poor absorption of visible light and very low hole mobility. Here, by using first-principles calculations, we prove that the delta-nitrogen-doping is a powerful strategy to modulate the electronic structures of two-dimensional (2D) perovskite oxide K2La2Ti3O10. Our results demonstrate a significant enhancement of its photocatalytic and optoelectronic performance. Its bandgap becomes a direct one and decreases dramatically from 3.12 eV of 2D pristine K2La2Ti3O10 monolayer to 1.63 eV in its N-doping counterpart. Correspondingly, the calculated optical absorption spectrum shows a considerable improvement in the visible region (10(4) cm(-1)). Moreover, its hole effective mass also has a pronounced reduction from 26.1 to 0.346 m(0), which increases the hole mobility greatly from 0.15 to 3.77 x 10(3) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2053-1591		WOS:000465196400009

Herein, we design a highly efficient electrocatalyst consisting of monocrystalline NiMoO4 nanorods modified by broccoli-like hierarchical Ni(PO3)(2)-Ni2P coupling with MoOx self-supported catalyst. As HER proceeds, catalytic performance gets better due to the dissolution of MoOx to further expose more nickel sites as Lewis base sites and in-situ formation of hydroxyl-ligands on the surface of loading nanoparticle as Lewis acid sites, which effectively integrate artificial frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) to respectively promote adsorption of H* and activation of H2O molecules. Moreover, the electron-transfer leads to the downshift of the D-band center of Ni, which helps optimizing desorption ability of H*. Therefore, such reconstructed catalyst exhibits extremely low overpotentials of 11 and 79 mV to afford 10 and 100 mA.cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with sustainable durability for over 110 h, outperforming most of reported advanced alkaline HER catalysts. Additionally, this catalyst used as cathode for overall alkaline water splitting at 10 and 100 mA.cm(-2) with only 1.48 and 1.57 V, showing its broad application prospect in practical large-scale hydrogen production.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000793657500002

The Cz-Si samples are first irradiated at room temperature with 2.5 MeV electrons and then heat-treated at 320 degrees C to anneal out the VO, V2O, and V3O centers and generate the VO2, V2O2, and V3O2 complexes as the dominant vacancy-oxygen-related defects. Subsequently, the samples are irradiated at room temperature again and subjected to 30-min isochronal annealing in the temperature range 75-350 degrees C. Defect evolution upon the treatments is monitored by means of the local vibrational mode (LVM) absorption spectroscopy. From an analysis of changes in intensity of the LVM lines it is revealed that the second irradiation results in a noticeable decrease in the concentrations of the VO2, V2O2, and V3O2 complexes and an increase in the concentrations of the oxygen dimer and the VO2* defect (metastable state of VO2, which consists of the VO and O-i components). The observed defect transformations are argued to be related to interactions of the radiation-induced self-interstitial silicon atoms (I) with the vacancy-oxygen complexes via the following reactions: VO2 + I -> O-2i, V3O2 + I -> V2O2, V2O2 + I -> VO2*.

Both the friction and wear rates of a-C:H films sliding against Al2O3 in nitrogen and argon were lower than that in oxygen and humid air atmospheres. And superlubricity (0.009) was achieved in dry nitrogen atmosphere for self mated a-C:H counterpart. From the viewpoint of various gas molecules' adsorption, the a-C:H films' friction behavior was investigated. Micro-Raman and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were employed to study the interfacial structural evolution and tribofilm distribution in different atmospheres. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to reveal the relation between wear rate and tribo-oxidation reaction in various atmospheres. We confirmed that nitrogen molecule provided repulsion force at sliding interface and reduced friction of a-C:H film. Meantime, graphitic tribofilm also played a significant role. It was stated that electronic repulsion force aroused by adsorption was enough for ultra-low friction, while the presence of graphitic tribofilm had synergetic effect with it in achieving superlubricity. This study provided considerations and discussions about interfacial electronic character's effect on friction behaviors of carbon based film.									20	2	0	0	0	0	21			0925-9635	1879-0062		WOS:000407409200013

To increase the reaction rate, the high-efficient electrocatalysts are needed. Among various catalysts, platinum and its alloys are investigated as the best catalyst for the ORR. However, the use of Pt-based catalysts is still suffered from many disadvantages including excessive cost, scarcity, and poor stability. In this work, lithium-birnessite (Li-bir), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and Li-bir/rGO nanocomposite were tested as the ORR catalysts. The linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) curves at a scan rate of 10 mV s(-1) show that the Li-bir/rGO nanocomposite provides the best catalytic performance with an onset potential of 0.87 V vs. RHE, half-wave potential of 0.72 V vs. RHE, limiting current density of 5.72 mA.cm(-1) (at a rotation rate of 1600 rpm), along with the Tafel slope of 92.5 mV.dec(-1). Furthermore, the electron transfer number per oxygen molecule calculated by Koutechy-Levich (K-L) equation is 3.84, indicating a 4-electron pathway for the ORR suggesting that the Li-bir/rGO nanocomposite can be used as a high-efficient ORR catalyst. More interestingly, a current retention of the Li-bir/rGO nanocomposite remains over 84 % while the current density of the commercial Pt/C decreases to 67 % after 17,000 seconds. The catalyst in this work may be practically used in many applications such as metal-air batteries.					233rd Meeting of The-Electrochemical-Society (ECS)233rd Meeting of The-Electrochemical-Society (ECS)	MAY 13-17, 2018MAY 13-17, 2018	Electrochem SocElectrochem Soc	Seattle, WASeattle, WA	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1938-5862	1938-6737	978-1-60768-841-9	WOS:000541678600114

Carbon as a pillar material has been used for long time due to its intrinsic properties like high conductivity and large surface area that can increase activity of electrocatalyst. However, severe drop in activity due to carbon corrosion is the main challenge. Here, we introduce robust, conductive and stable Magneli phase Ti4O7 nano-pillar in to flower like nickel ruthenium-layered double hydroxide (3D-FL-NiRu-LDH/Ti4O7) through an easy in situ growth approach for the first time. The decoration of Magneli phase Ti4O7 not only significantly improves the activity but also stability of LDH nanosheet catalyst. The as-synthesized materials retain 98% of the activity after 45 h which surpasses all the reported LDH catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction under alkaline media. The key roles of Ti4O7 are to provide the effective charge transfer networks of LDH catalyst and prevent agglomeration of LDH catalysts though strongly coupled interactions evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Therefore, the developed catalyst demonstrates promising conductivity, together with durability. The reported approach of introducing a robust and conductive pillar coupled with LDH catalysts provides a novel pathway for developing a highly efficient and durable electrocatalyst.									41	6	0	0	5	0	44			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000430057000032

It occurs during the biochemical reactions of the photorespiratory C(2) cycle, which is an ancillary metabolic process that allows photosynthesis to occur in oxygen-containing environments. Recent research has identified the genes for many plant photorespiratory enzymes, allowing precise functional analyses by reverse genetics. Similar studies with cyanobactena disclosed the evolutionary origin of photorespiratory metabolism in these ancestors of plastids.

Herein, free from any surfactant, three-dimensional flower-like FeNi metal organic framework (FeNi-MOP) composed of two-dimensional nanosheets have been formed by onestep wet-chemistry method. FeNi-MOF exhibit superior electrocatalytic OER performances with low overpotentials of 150 mV at 100 mA/cm(2) and Tafel slopes of 38.7 mV/dec in alkaline media, and show remarkable catalytic stability for more than 100 hat large current densities. XPS, In-situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, IR spectra and TG were used to explore the reasons for the excellent catalytic activity and long-lifes stability of the catalyst, and it was proved that the catalyst exhibits pi-pi interaction after the catalytic reaction, which leads to excellent catalytic activity and stability. Meanwhile, In situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy was used to probe the specific transformation process during the OER. The density functional theory was used to further analyzed the intrinsically catalytic activity of FeNi-MOF.									19	5	0	0	2	0	20			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000509632300050

But in the process of EOW preparation, there are lack of research of the key electrode material, and it was not to establish the relationship between the electrode materials and bactericidal activity factor(HClO). RuO_2-SnO_2 anode was prepared by thermal decomposition method. It could be seen that the crystal type of RuO_2-SnO_2 was the typical rutile structure by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The electrode surface exhibited the electrochemical characteristics of RuO_2 through cyclic voltammetry(CV) without the characteristics of SnO_2. The polarization curve of chloride evolution and oxygen evolution were further studied by Linear sweep voltammetry(LSV). With the current density of 70 mA/cm~2, the potential difference between chloride evolution and oxygen evolution was 368mV for RuO_2-SnO_2 electrode, but 278 mV for RuO_2 electrode. It suggests that the selectivity of chlorine evolution reaction of RuO_2-SnO_2 electrode is higher than that of RuO_2 electrode. On this basis, electrolysis efficiency, available chlorine content, hypochlorous acid content and the acceleration life test of RuO_2-SnO_2 electrode were all studied in the actual preparation process of electrolyzed oxidizing water. The results showed that compared with RuO_2, the electrolysis efficiency of RuO_2-SnO_2 electrode increased by 11.34% available chlorine content increased by 35.57% and hypochlorous acid content increased by 33.62%. And, what's more, the acceleration life is increased 14 fold. Finally, by SEM characterization and electrochemical porosity calculations of RuO_2-SnO_2 electrode, it had suggested that the electrode surface is smooth and the internal porosity is large. So it can hinder the electrolyte penetration into the inner of electrode, enhance the electrode corrosion resistance, and improve the service life.			氧化电解水是一种高效、环保的杀菌剂,在医疗卫生、食品安全和农业生产方面有着广泛的应用。但目前氧化电解水制备过程中,缺少对关键电极材料的研究,没有建立电极材料与杀菌活性因子(HClO)之间的关系。采用热分解法制备RuO_2-SnO_2氧化物合金电极。通过XRD表征可以看出其晶型为典型的金红石型结构,进一步通过循环伏安(CV)表征证明其表面为典型的RuO_2电化学特征,没有SnO_2电化学特征。在此基础上,利用线性伏安(LSV)技术分别考察了RuO_2-SnO_2的析氯极化曲线和析氧极化曲线,研究表明电流密度为70 mA/cm~2时,RuO_2-SnO_2电极的析氯析氧电势差为368 mV,而RuO_2为278 mV,提高了析氯反应选择性。在此基础上,对RuO_2-SnO_2电极在实际制备氧化电解水过程中的电解效率,有效氯含量、次氯酸含量及强化实验寿命进行了考察。结果表明,RuO_2-SnO_2电极比RuO_2电极氯离子电解效率提高了11.34%,有效氯含量提高了35.57%,次氯酸含量提高了33.62%,电极强化实验寿命提高了14倍。最后,通过SEM表征和电化学孔隙率的计算,表明RuO_2-SnO_2电极表面较平整,内部孔隙率大,所以使电解液不容易渗透到电极内部,而使电极的耐腐蚀性和使用寿命都将得到提高。						1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1001-9731			CSCD:5553714

Three typical clay minerals, e.g., kaolinite, sepiolite, and talc, were adopted as photocatalyst carriers. Notably, the acid-treated clay minerals coupled with g-C3N4 in three different ways. The kaolinite/g-C3N4 composite, in particular, proceeded with an intercalation reaction due to the in situ growth of g-C3N4 within the layers of acid-treated kaolinite, leading to the expansion of kaolinite layers and a prominently large specific surface area of 61.9 m(2) g(-1). The resultant composites were used in photocatalytic H-2 generation by water splitting and CO2 reduction, exhibiting superior photocatalytic performance to the g-C3N4 . Among the obtained composites, the optimized kaolinite/g-C3N4 showed the best photocatalytic activities, e.g. 3.03 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) of CO evolution and 385 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) of H-2 evolution, compared with merely 0.91 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) of CO evolution and 96.4 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) of H-2 evolution for bare g-C3N4. The superior performance of kaolinite/g-C3N4 can be ascribed to the large specific surface area and better distribution of g-C3N4, which can enhance the light absorption, increase the number of active sites and favor the charge separation.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			0169-1317	1872-9053		WOS:000727766100006

First of all, Te was deposited on the rGO/PI using electrochemical deposition method to obtain Te-rGO/PI that has various morphologies. Secondly, a monolayer Pb film was deposited on the Te-rGO/PI by the similar electrochemical method to get a transition state material of Pb@Te-rGO/PI. Finally, the target Pt@Te catalyst on the rGO/PI with large surface area was obtained by a chemical oxidation method, in which Pb was stripped off from the Pb@Te-rGO/PI by an oxygenation of H2PtCl6, while the oxygenation process, Pt replaced Pb to be deposited on the surface of Te-rGO/PI to form Pt@Te-rGO/PI. Then the prepared Pt Te-rGO/PI was used as a working electrode to study the hydrogen evolution behavior in 0.5 mol/l H2SO4. By comparison the catalyst of sole Pt-rGO/PI nanoparticles, Pt@Te-rGO/PI catalyst considerably abated the demanding of Pt. And it shows excellent HER activities with a low overpotential of 0.1 V. The Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1) reveals most likely the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). On the other hand, the catalyst displays satisfactory stability. This work may pave a potential pathway for synthesizing multi-morphology nano-Pt catalyst with high surface area for application in the study of HER.

However, controlled synthesis of functional mesoporous carbons with large tunable pore sizes, small particle size, well-designed functionalities, and uniform morphology is still a great challenge. Herein, we report a versatile nanoemulsion assembly approach to prepare N-doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres with high uniformity and large tunable pore sizes (5-37 nm). We show that the organic molecules (e.g., 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, TMB) not only play an important role in the evolution of pore sizes but also significantly affect the interfacial interaction between soft templates and carbon precursors. As a result, a well-defined Pluronic F127/TMB/dopamine nanoemulsion can be facilely obtained in the ethanol/water system, which directs the polymerization of dopamine into highly uniform polymer nanospheres and their derived N-doped carbon nanospheres with diversely novel structures such as smooth, golf ball, multichambered, and dendritic nanospheres. The resultant uniform dendritic mesoporous carbon nanospheres show an ultralarge pore size (similar to 37 nm), small particle size (similar to 128 nm), high surface area (similar to 635 m(2) g(-1)), and abundant N content (similar to 6.8 wt %), which deliver high current density and excellent durability toward oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline solution.									247	15	0	0	20	0	254			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000466987900039	30964289

Hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) is a promising photocatalytic material due to its favorable band gap, earth abundance and low cost. However, overcoming hematite's poor surface and electrical properties is crucial for reaching its theoretical potential. To this end, we show that single layer graphene transferred to the surface of nanostructured, titanium doped hematite results in a photocurrent density 1.6 times greater than bare hematite. Understanding the mechanism behind this enhancement is important for optimizing graphene coatings on photocatalysts. Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy reveals that graphene affects the surface-electrolyte interface without modifying the bulk of the hematite. Kinetic studies were performed using Intensity Modulated Photocurrent Spectroscopy, revealing that hematite with the graphene overlayer is able to transfer charge more efficiently due to a decrease in the surface recombination rate. Therefore, the main contribution of graphene on hematite is reduced surface recombination, resulting in a higher yield of charge carriers on the catalytic surface to participate in the oxygen evolution reaction. Single layer graphene overlayers have the potential to act as a general surface-modification technique to improve the photocurrent density of other metal oxide photocatalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Plants and algae have evolved mechanisms to regulate light harvesting efficiency in response to variable light intensity so as to avoid oxidative damage. Nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) consists of the rapid dissipation of excess excitation energy as heat. Although widespread among oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, NPQ shows important differences in its machinery. In land plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, NPQ depends on the presence of PSBS, whereas in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii it requires a different protein called LHCSR. In this work, we show that both proteins are present in the moss Physcomitrella patens. By generating KO mutants lacking PSBS and/or LHCSR, we also demonstrate that both gene products are active in NPQ. Plants lacking both proteins are more susceptible to high light stress than WT, implying that they are active in photoprotection. These results suggest that NPQ is a fundamental mechanism for survival in excess light and that upon land colonization, photosynthetic organisms evolved a unique mechanism for excess energy dissipation before losing the ancestral one found in algae.									147	2	0	0	141	0	150			0027-8424			WOS:000278807400063	20505121

Herein, we uncovered that oxygen vacancy (VO)-attired Cu/Cu0.76Co2.24O4 dual-active-sites catalysts significantly increase the hydrogen production rate of AB hydrolysis. The turnover frequency of Cu/Cu0.76Co2.24O4-VO dehydrogenation in 0.10 M NaOH can reach 50.33 molH2/(molcat.min), which is 45.9 times that of metal Cu. By means of a joint experimental and computational study, the VO defects promote the formation of electron-rich surface of Cu0.76Co2.24O4, and the Cu also enriches the surface electrons due to the strong interaction with TMOs, which enhances the activation of O-H and B-H bonds, respectively, and significantly accelerates the rate-determining step of the reaction. This work demonstrates the important role of constructive defects in regulating surface electrons of dual-active-sites catalysts on the performance enhancement and provides a broader idea for the design of excellent AB hydrolysis catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000809947500002

Understanding of structural changes accompanying with those interfacial processes is important not only for fundamental science but also for a wide range of applications, especially electrocatalysis. In the last several decades, a variety of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques have been developed to observe geometric/molecular/electronic structures at the solid/liquid interfaces in situ. However, techniques to probe the electronic structure of electrocatalysts are still limited because of the complexity of the experimental setup and the interpretation of results. Since the 1980s, our groups have developed and utilized various techniques which enable to investigate those structural changes under electrochemical potential control. In the present paper, our recent research progress on the electronic structure at solid/liquid interfaces, (1) in situ XAFS studies on molecular catalysts confined within molecular layers and electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, (2) development of an in situ electrochemical XPS apparatus for the solid/liquid interfaces and (3) investigation of the electronic structure of metal surfaces modulated by adsorbed species by in situ DR-SFG is briefly reviewed.

Based on mutually corroborating growth, electrochemical measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we herein develop the HER-active vertical graphene nano-hills (VGNHs) on Co thin films such that Co atoms are introduced into the VGNH tip region. The HER activity exhibits a volcano-shaped curve with respect to the encapsulated Co density, and the best performance achieved at the nominal Co substrate thickness of 1 nm is characterized by the low onset potential, overpotential, and Tafel slope in acidic electrolyte. Especially, with this low-cost yet structurally and chemically stable Co-seeded VGNH catalyst, a record-level mass activity is achieved. The emergence of the HER activity from the combination of originally HER-inactive VGNHs and Co thin films is clarified by DFT calculations, which identifies the synergistic effects of the nanoscale curvature at the VGNH tip and the charge-transfer doping by encapsulated Co atoms.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000476599900045

The catalysts are prepared via a pulse microwave assisted polyol synhtesis method. The techniques of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) are adopted to investigate the elemental composition, the structure, and the morphology of the as prepared electrocatalysts.Their electrocatalytic properties toward HOR and ORR are evaluated by the aid of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) techniques. It is found that after the addition of even a small amount of iridium, the electrocatalytic activity of pure palladium is enhanced toward both reactions.According to the obtained results the highest HOR and ORR electrocatalytic activity enhancement is exhibited by PdIr (1:1) sample. The order of the electrocatalytic activity is found to be PdIr > PdIr3 > Pd3Ir > Pd > Ir for HOR and PdIr > Pd3Ir > PdIr3 > Pd > Ir for the ORR, respectively.

Results showed the general chemistry of the groundwater is of SO4 (2-) type. Water-rock reactions of halite, Glauber's salt, gypsum and celestite, and reverse ionic exchange dictated the groundwater chemistry evolution, increasing concentrations of Cl-, Na+, SO4 (2-), Ca2+, Mg2+ and Sr2+ in the groundwater. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 values of groundwater ranged from -10.8 to -7.7 and -74.4 to -53.1 aEuro degrees, respectively. Modern groundwater was identified in the proluvial fan and the shallow aquifer of the fine soil plain, likely as a result of direct infiltration of rivers and irrigation returns. Deep groundwater was depleted in heavy isotopes with C-14 ages ranging from 3,000 to 26,000 years, suggesting palaeowater that was recharged during the late Pleistocene and middle Holocene epochs under a cold climate. These results have important implications for groundwater management in the Shule River basin, since large amounts of groundwater are effectively being mined and a water-use strategy is urgently needed.									29	2	0	0	8	0	31			1431-2174	1435-0157		WOS:000365079400009

Besides. at 10(4) mol dm bicarbonate concentration, the oxygen consumption rate is almost two orders of magnitude higher than the UO2 dissolution rate. These results suggest that at low bicarbonate concentration (< 10(-2) mol dm(-3)) the alteration of the spent nuclear fuel cannot be directly derived from the measured uranium concentrations in solution. On the other hand. the study a( low bicarbonate concentrations of the evolution of the UO2 surface at nanometric scale by means of the SFM technique shows that the difference between oxidation and dissolution rates is not due to the precipitation of a secondary solid phase on UO2.

However, homogenous Ni(OH)(2)nanomaterials with abundant active sites suffer from low conductivity and easy aggregation, resulting in low catalytic activity and stability. Here, we report a new synthetic method capable of generating abundant and confined S-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2)nanoparticles (NPs) (3-5 nm) within a 3D semiconductor substrate, metal-chalcogenide semiconductor zeolite (CSZ). This method operatesviasequential fluoride-assisted cationic stripping andin situNi(OH)(2)generation and is demonstrated here as an effective method to synthesize Ni2+-containing CSZ that are known to defy direct synthesis. The resulting composite (denoted Ni(OH)(2)NPs@CSZ) exhibited excellent OER performance with a very low overpotential of only 212 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)in O-2-saturated 1 M KOH solution, and low Tafel slope of 64.2 mV dec(-1), which is superior to that of benchmark IrO2. DFT calculations indicate that the interaction between the embedded Ni(OH)(2)NPs and the dopant, S2-, from the host CSZ played a crucial role in improving OER performance. This work provides a new path for developing high-performance Ni(OH)(2)-based OER catalysts and may also serve as a general approach for loading large amounts of other catalytically active NPs into semiconducting open frameworks to further optimize electrocatalytic performance.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000541615200014

The prepared electrodes are subjected to different electrochemical studies. Benchmark recommends the use of the overpotential required to achieve current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) (eta(t=0)) in linear sweep voltammetry, LSV, at 10 mV.s(-1) as an activity parameter for oxygen evolution reaction, OER. The values of eta(t=0) equal 0.443 and 0.440 for Co/G and Co-(cit)/G, respectively. This work suggests an activation routine based on the observed sequential enhancing of eta(t=0) values through successive cyclic voltammetry in 1 M NaOH. Satisfactory eta(t=0) values of 0.437 and 0.394 V are obtained for the activated electrodes prepared in absence and presence of citrate anions, respectively. All the prepared electrodes show noteworthy stability over 2hrs. The values of overpotential after 2 hrs eta(t)(=)(2h) in 1 M NaOH reveals higher efficiency for the electrodes prepared from citrate-containing bath rather than citrate free bath. The morphology and the structure of the optimum electrodes are characterized. RRDE and eQCM studies clarify the role of the citrate anion in controlling the deposited cobalt phases. The OER catalytic activities are correlated with the deposited cobalt phase structure for the prepared electrodes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report the synthesis of efficient cobalt-modified nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C/Co) electrocatalysts by using a one-pot pyrolysis. The abundant source of N in g-C3N4 contributes to the in situ N doping in the carbon matrix, which favors the formation of Co-related catalytic active sites. The N-C/Co-1 (prepared with 1 mmol Co salt) sample exhibits the best performance towards the ORR, with a positive half-wave potential of 0.86 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), high stability and excellent methanol tolerance, which outperforms the commercial Pt/C catalyst. We find that the high performance is dependent on the optimal content of Co that can achieve the maximum amount of Co-N-x catalytic species. In addition, we reveal that the size effect of Co nanoparticles is not the determining factor for the ORR activity in the current system, as the kinetics of the ORR reaction is dominantly determined by the active sites derived from Co-N-x species. By exploiting the N-C/Co-1 sample as an air cathode catalyst, the assembled Zn-air battery presents a maximal power density of 153 mW cm(-2) as well as good durability during continuous cycle tests.									8	1	0	0	1	0	8			2196-0216			WOS:000503890500001

Hence, identifying a bifunctional catalyst with low-cost and high-stability is very crucial for Zn-air batteries. Herein, we report a simple method to prepare core-shell-structured Co@Co3O4 nanoparticles encapsulated into N-doped carbon polyhedra by carbonization and controlled oxidation of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which are then applied as a bifunctional catalyst for Zn-air batteries. Using such a configuration, enhanced performances, including a high power density of similar to 64 mW cm(-2), a stable voltage profile over 80 h battery operation with four mechanical recharges, a small discharge/charge overpotential of similar to 0.66 V and a long-life of 100 cycles for 200 h operation at 5 mA cm(-2), have been achieved. These excellent performances can be attributed to abundant graphited carbon and CNTs, high N-doping, plentiful pores, the synergy between the semiconductive Co3O4-coating layer and the conductive Co bulk, and the uniform Co@Co3O4 nanoparticles in this catalyst which effectively improve electrical conductivity/ion transfer and further concertedly promote the catalytic activity towards the ORR/OER. Moreover, the belt-shaped polymer Zn-air battery with this catalyst also shows good electrochemical stability under different deformations.									142	7	0	0	4	0	145			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000423466100012

The prepared P-NiFe@CF catalyst consisted of Ni5P4, NiP2, and FeP with 3D flower-like P-NiFe architecture on CF. P-NiFe@CF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the UOR (demanding only 1.39 V (vs. RHE) to achieve 200 mA cm(-2)), and for the HER with a low overpotential of 0.023 V (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2), indicating its feasibility as a bifunctional catalyst electrode for urea electrolysis. A urea electrolysis cell with P-NiFe@CF as both the free-standing anode and cathode generated a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell potential of 1.37 V (vs. RHE), which is considerably lower than that of water electrolysis, and also lower than previously reported values. The results indicate that the P-NiFe@CF catalyst electrodes can be used as free-standing bifunctional electrodes for urea electrolyzers.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2045-2322			WOS:000716666700087	34754002

In this work, three-electrode-system was employed to study the effect of Fe3+ on Nafion-bonded IrO2 catalyst which is conventional anode catalyst for PEMWE. Study results showed that Fe3+ contamination decreased IrO2 catalytic activity significantly only when the following two conditions were both satisfied: 1) Nafion resin exists in working electrode; 2) working electrode potential was over 1.471 V (vs. NHE) which is around the initial voltage of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Besides, the contaminated working electrode activity was recovered to about 16% by being immersed into 3 M H2SO4 solution, but it was recovered to about 59% by ethanol washing method. These study results revealed that Fe3+ plays a role of catalyst for H2O2 production during OER process, which leads to Nafion resin decomposition. The degradation products covered working electrode surface, and thus decreased effective active sites of IrO2. Nafion degradation was further confirmed by analyzing 1) F- content in anode water and 2) FTIR of contaminated Nafion membrane. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, the studies of metal-free catalysts containing sp(2)- or sp(3)-hybridized B sites have displayed an attractive prospect for N-2 reduction but have obscured the nature of the optimal active B species. Herein, with the aid of first-principles calculations, we explicitly disclose that sp(2)-hybridized B is the optimal species for providing high activity for N-2 reduction and particularly outstanding capability to suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Specifically, the system with B substituting an edge N atom in the cavity of C2N is proposed to be highly promising for N-2 reduction under mild conditions. The developed comprehensive insight is of clear significance for the rational design of advanced catalysts for NH3 synthesis under mild conditions.									30	1	0	0	0	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521346600038

Modification of the surface of the Ni + Mo + Si electrodes was carried out by leaching out of the Si particles in alkaline solution. In this paper coatings modified in that way were denoted as Ni + Mo-Si. Electrochemical measurements were undertaken on both Ni I Mo composite coating and modified Ni + Mo-Si composite coating after thermal treatment in air (700 degrees C, 1 h). It was stated that composite coatings are characterized by very porous surface in comparison with nickel coating after the same thermal treatment. Apparent activity for OER on the obtained coatings was studied by means of both do and ac electrochemical methods in S M KOH. In the Tafel plots determined for the OER, two well defined and the same slopes were observed for all investigated electrodes. This fact indicates that the OER on all obtained electrodes is controlled by the same mechanism. It has been stated that additional ingredients in the coating and modification of the surface cause an increase in electrochemically active surface area and improve electrochemical characteristics of the coatings in OER.

Herein, we successfully integrated a defective TiO2/MoP heterojunction with highly conductive carbon cloth (CC), for constructing a panel reactor with charge transfer channels to boost H-2 evolution. As expected, the behavior of photogenerated charge carriers is effectively steered, resulting in high-efficiency charge migration and separation, and consequently improving photocatalytic activity. The optimal TiO2/MoP/CC exhibits a H-2 generation rate of 14.7 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2), up to 19 times higher than that of TiO2/CC. Our work can open up ways to optimize the photocatalytic performance by developing novel non-powder-based photocatalyst systems with good stability and recyclability.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2052-1553			WOS:000641547200004

The 2-step method of Cohcc nanocubes preparation was applied: i) metallic cobalt deposition and ii) cobalt electrooxidation in Co(CN)(6)(3-) containing electrolyte. The presence of CN stretching vibrations was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The energy band gap was equal to 2.5 eV and was estimated using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The presence of Cohcc did not clearly affect the absorbance ability of tested films. Electrodes were tested as photoanodes for water splitting. It was shown that electrocatalytical properties of Cohcc in the oxygen evolution reaction strongly affect the photocurrent generated during FTO/BiVO4/Cohcc illumination. A significant, almost 1 V, shift of the onset potential towards lower potential was achieved. The role of Cohcc has been discussed on the basis of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is still a great challenge to develop economical and effective CN-FeSACs satisfying the needs of high output power. Herein, an ionothermal-transformation strategy is proposed to synthesize hierarchically tubular porous CN-FeSACs with an ultrahigh special surface area of 2500 m(2) g(-1) to host abundant single-atom iron sites with an attempt to simultaneously boost sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics and mass transport. Benefiting from the unique feature, the final obtained material shows an ORR half-wave potential of 0.885 V, higher than that of benchmark Pt/C (0.850 V). When assembled into zinc-air battery, a large peak power density of 208 mW cm(-2) is achieved, which is far superior to that of Pt/C (119 mW cm(-2)). This work provides an economical and feasible strategy to prepare hierarchically porous CN-FeSACs for energy conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000752977200031	34851600

In this study, we report a high-performance electrode material, Ti3C2Tx supported Fe3O4 nanoplates (denoted as MXene-Fe), synthesized by a simple in situ wet chemistry method in a solvothermal system. The mesoporous MXene-Fe material as a supercapacitor electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 368.0 F g(-1) at 1.0 A g(-1) and long cycling stability with about 81% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles at 10.0 A g(-1). Moreover, the optimized MXene-Fe also displays high electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution (1.0 M KOH) with a low overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 65.1 mV dec(-1).

However, the synthesis of metastable curved structures is very difficult. Herein, a simple room temperature coprecipitation method is proposed to synthesize 3D cobalt (Co) hydroxide (alpha-Co(OH)(2)) electrocatalysts that consist of curly 2D nanosheets. The formation process of curly nanosheets is elaborated systematically and the results demonstrate that the -NHx group has great effect on the formation of curly structure. Combining the advantage of 2D curly nanosheet and 3D aggregate structure, the as-prepared alpha-Co(OH)(2) curly nanosheet aggregates show the best water oxidation activity with an overpotential of 269 mV at j = 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 m KOH. The electrocatalytic process studies demonstrate that the formation of Co-IV(sic)O species is the rate-determining step. Theoretical calculations further confirm the beneficial effect of the bent structure on the conductivity, the adsorption of OH- and the formation of OOH* species.									17	2	0	0	1	0	17			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000535297600001	32452654

Among them, the interface engineering between semiconductors and the construction of surface-active sites play a vital role in generating and transporting light-excited electrons, which can ultimately accelerate water decomposition. Therefore, the MoS2@MoO3 step (S)-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst was prepared by in-situ partial sulfidation. The excellent interface engineering of MoS2@MoO3 nanomaterials achieves a high surface reaction rate. The in-situ vulcanization strategy gradually corrodes from the outside to the inside. The introduction of sulfur atoms can replace oxygen atoms to build a sulfur-rich surface and generate molybdenum sulfide. The amount of thioacetamide is adjusted to control vulcanization and optimizing the experimental conditions, the best hydrogen production rate is 12416.8 mu mol h(-1) g(-1). An in-situ irradiation XPS experiments and DFT calculations provide a deeper understanding of the S-scheme electron transport mechanism in MoS2@MoO3. MoS2@MoO3 interface interaction has penetrating electron channels and a strong interface interaction force, which effectively promotes the charge transfer between interfaces. This gradual surface vulcanization strategy provides new ideas for introducing synergistic surface-active sites and optimizing interface engineering photocatalyst projects.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000779659500003

Deposition of Na multilayers leads to a first monolayer of oxidic Na followed by metallic Na island growth. XPS results for the oxidation of the metallic Na islands indicate an incomplete oxidation of Na at 125 K. Oxidation at 350 K completely oxidizes the metallic islands producing a mixture of Na2O and Na2O2. Thermal evolution of the oxidation products was examined. After oxidation at 350 K and flashing to 750 K, Na2O and Na2O2 are the primary oxides on MnO(100). After flashing to 850 K, a solid state reaction of Na2O2/Na2O and the MnO(100) substrate forms a NaMnO2-like surface compound which decomposes above 850 K. Oxygen exchange between CO2 and Na oxides is observed. The strong interaction between CO2 and Na oxide islands forms Na2CO3 on MnO(100). Heating the Na2CO3 covered MnO(100) surface to 600 K for 10 min drives oxidic Na in the first monolayer into the MnO subsurface, and produces a surface exposing islands of Na2CO3 on MnO(100).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0039-6028	1879-2758		WOS:000632455700004

The ratio of TiO2 to IrOx was precisely controlled by varying the number of ALD cycles for each precursor. Silicon with a 2 nm surface SiO2 layer was coated with TiO2-IrOx alloys ranging in composition from 18 to 35% iridium relative to the sum of titanium and iridium concentrations. IrOx catalyzed oxygen evolution and imparted a high work function to the TiO2-IrOx alloys, enabling photovoltages during water oxidation that exceeded 600 mV. TiO2 imparted stability and inhibited corrosion of the underlying silicon light absorber. After annealing in forming gas (5% H-2/95% N-2), TiO2-IrOx alloys were stable for 12 h of continuous water oxidation in 1 M H2SO4. Key properties of the MIS junction affecting electrochemical operation were also extracted by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This work demonstrates that alloying by ALD is a promising approach for designing corrosion resistant Schottky contacts with optimized electronic and materials properties for catalyzed, solar driven water oxidation.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000455558100011

In this paper, a series of BMZIFs catalysts based on ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 modified by a small amount of glucose were fabricated for Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR). With the reasonable glucose adding and further water as solvent, the modified BMZIFs (BM2-C-6-50(T)) exhibits excellent ORR performance with the half-wave potential reaches of 0.84 V and the limiting current density of 5.26 mA cm(-2), due to the large specific surface area of 387.18 m(2) g(-1) and the uniform micro/ mesoporous structure. The glucose can significantly improve the graphitization degree and conductivity of the catalyst. Compared with the unmodified BMZIFs, the active material Co-N-x also gets more loading due to low-dimensional structures and increasing surface areas by the water solvent modification. This work can provide a green and mild approach to modify the structure of BMZIFs to effectively improve the electrocatalytic performance for derivatization catalysts.

Herein, a series of different proportion bimetallic uploaded nitrogen-doped graphene materials (Fe2O3-Co NPs-N-GR) were successfully synthesized through a simple, green and cost-effective method for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). All of the materials we used were earth-abundant and inexpensive. In this work, employing the interaction between DA and metal ions, Co2+ and iron (II) phthalocyanine (FePC) were loaded on the graphene oxide (GO). Moreover, the doping of N, reduction of GO and forming of Fe2O3 NPs, Co NPs were realized by one-step calcination method. Among the series of catalysts we synthesized, Fe2O3(1)-Co-(1) NPs-N-GR exhibits better HER performance than other catalysts that we synthesized. Fe2O3(1)-Co-(1) NPs-N-GR exhibits significant catalytic activity and excellent durability for HER in a wide pH range. The electrocatalytic performance of Fe2O3(1)-Co-(1) NPs-N-GR toward HER is better in acidic solution (0.5 M H2SO4) than in alkaline solution (1.0 M NaOH), the onset overpotential is 0.36 V, Tafel slope is 66 mV dec(-1) and current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotential is 0.39 V. The excellent HER catalytic performance of Fe2O3(1)-Co-(1) NPs-N-GR stem from its unique composition and structural properties by combining Fe2O3-Co nanoparticles and N co-doped graphene.

Here, we prepared cobalt phosphonate-derived N-doped cobalt phosphate/carbon nanotube hybrids (CoP-iC-N/CNTs) by hydrothermal treatment of N-containing cobalt phosphonate and oxidized carbon nanotubes (o-CNT) followed by high-temperature calcination under nitrogen atmosphere. The resultant CoPiC-N/CNT exhibits a superior electrocatalytic performance for the ORR in alkaline media, which is equal to the commercial Pt/C catalyst in the aspect of half-wave potential, onset potential and diffuse limiting current density. Furthermore, the excellent tolerance to methanol and strong durability outperform those of commercial Pt/C. It is found that cobalt phosphonate-derived N-doped cobalt phosphate and the in-situ formed graphitic carbons play key roles on the activity enhancement. Besides, introducing a suitable amount of CNTs enhances the electronic conductivity and further contributes to the improved ORR performance.

The presented 3D-CFD model, developed using the software ANSYS Fluent 15.0, is validated against experimental data obtained from a pilot-scale pressurized entrained flow reactor. The comparison of the model with experiments shows a good correlation for the investigated Rhenish lignite. It is established that the modeling approach is suitable for predicting pressure- and temperature-dependent conversion rates in entrained flow gasifiers. This work focuses on the comprehensive modeling of char particle reactions. Pore diffusion and boundary layer diffusion become relevant at high temperatures. An nth order effectiveness factor approach with intrinsic reaction kinetics is applied in order to account for these diffusion limitations. Furthermore, the influence of thermal deactivation on the reactivity of the char surface is included. Several submodels are introduced, with focus on the structural evolution of char particles. A new pore structure model for high temperatures is developed that describes the surface area, the diameter, the density, the porosity and the mean pore diameter of the particles as a function of reaction regime and char conversion. User defined functions (UDF) include all submodels as well as the aforementioned effectiveness factor approach for the reactions of char with O-2, CO2 and H2O. The computational effort is comparable to combustion simulations performed with standard models available in the software used. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It displays ultralow overpotentials for OER (200 mV) and HER (16.6 mV) at 20 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, which is superior to the ever reported HER catalysts. For overall water splitting, it only needs 1.48 V to derive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and it also demonstrates an outstanding long-term stability with an ignorable decline in performance after testing 504 h at the current density of 150 mA cm(-2). The excellent performance is ascribed to the ultrasmall FeIr alloy, the 3D conductive substrate, and the ethylene-glycol ligand environment facilitates highly efficient HER through hydrogen spillover. Thus, this work undoubtedly provides a promising method for developing ultralow-loading noble metal catalysts with excellent performance at large current density for overall water splitting.									79	2	0	0	7	0	79			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000564573800005

An effective material-based mitigation strategy against cell reversal is to add oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts into the anode to make reversal-tolerant-anodes (RTAs). However, RTAs still suffer from an eventual sudden death, and the failure mechanisms of this sudden death have not been well studied thus far. Here we show a novel in-situ measurement technique with a distinctive partition membrane electrode assembly (MEA) to research the failure mechanism of RTAs. It is observed for the first time that the failure of RTAs is mainly attributed to the destruction of electron conducting paths caused by carbon corrosion from catalyst layers (CLs), gas diffusion layers (GDLs) and bipolar plates (BPs), rather than deactivation of the OER catalyst. As a verification, the application of additional OER catalysts on the GDL is found to effectively prolong the reversal tolerant time. These results add significant new insights into the failure mechanism of the RTA MEA and will be of practical importance in directing to design advanced MEAs and BPs that can withstand cell voltage reversal.

The setup enables rapid inductive heating of the electrodes to temperatures up to 1900 degrees C under precise infrared temperature control in controlled gas atmospheres. The constant overpressure inside the cell prevents the ambient atmosphere to permeate and contaminate the process. Finely adjusted sensors afford accurate and instant information on the electrodes' surface temperature. The subsequent cooling process in argon atmosphere proceeds without any treatment in water. After annealing, the crystals inside the chamber can immediately be subjected to any type of electrochemical deposition, modification, or characterization in two distinct three-electrode chambers, again without any exposure to air. Both chambers feature pump-controlled supply and withdrawal of liquid electrolyte. A special characteristic is the inert-gas flow inversion capability to transfer electrodes into separate portable inert-gas chambers. Design details are presented and their functionality during thermal preparation and electrochemical voltammetry of Ir(111) catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction are demonstrated. The station provides a crystal handling environment superior to the classic flame annealing approaches, yet to constitute a cost-effective alternative to vacuum chambers.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2366-9608			WOS:000484495900001

In 0.5 M H2SO4, this MnMoO4 NSA/NF electrode needs an overpotential of 89 mV to drive current densities of 10 mA cm(-2), to achieve the same current density, it demands overpotentials of 105 mV in 1.0 M KOH, 161 mV in 1.0M PBS (pH = 7), respectively. After continuous CV scanning for 1000 cycles under different pH conditions, it also demonstrates an excellent stability with ignorable activity decrease. Such preeminent HER performance may be derived from the synergistic effect between manganese (Mn) and molybdenum (Mo) atoms, exposure of more active sites on the nanosheets and effective electron transport along the nanosheets. This MnMoO4 NSA/NF electrocatalyst provides us a highly efficient material for water splitting devices for industrial hydrogen production.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000434988200001	29808833

The identified reaction products range from carbon nitrides over graphitic carbon to distinct molecular fluorophores. On the other hand, the solid, non-fluorescent reaction product produced at higher temperatures has been found to be a valuable precursor for the CO2-laser-assisted carbonization reaction in carbon laser-patterning. This work addresses the question of structural identification of both, the fluorescent and non-fluorescent reaction products obtained in the thermal reaction of citric acid and urea. The reaction products produced during autoclave-microwave reactions in the melt were thoroughly investigated as a function of the reaction temperature and the reaction products were subsequently separated by a series of solvent extractions and column chromatography. The evolution of a green molecular fluorophore, namely HPPT, was confirmed and a full characterization study on its structure and photophysical properties was conducted. The additional blue fluorescence is attributed to oligomeric ureas, which was confirmed by complementary optical and structural characterization. These two components form strong hydrogen-bond networks which eventually react to form solid, semi-crystalline particles with a size of similar to 7 nm and an elemental composition of 46% C, 22% N, and 29% O. The structural features and properties of all three main components were investigated in a comprehensive characterization study.									47	3	0	0	5	0	48			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000558925700019	34094179

Herein, according to requirements of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts under chlor-alkali electrolysis conditions, a three-component Ru/Ni/WC electrocatalyst with a weak exothermic effect for the water adsorption step ( increment H-H2O = -0.12 eV), low water dissociation energy barrier (Delta G(b) = 0.61 eV), and close-to-zero Gibbs free adsorption energy ( increment G(H*) = -0.03 eV) is designed through density functional theory calculations. Under the guidance of theoretical calculations, a novel multi-interface composite electrocatalyst is successfully prepared, denoted as Ru/Ni/WC@NPC (Ru wt.% = 4.13%). In a strongly alkaline medium, Ru/Ni/WC@NPC (Ru wt.% = 4.13%) records an excellent HER electrocatalytic activity with a very low overpotential (eta(10) = -3 mV) at 20 degrees C and even demonstrates exciting HER behavior at 90 degrees C (eta(10) = +2.8 mV). Most importantly, the electrochemical test under simulated chlor-alkali electrolysis condition demonstrates better HER performance than the industrial cathode material of commercial 20% Pt/C and low carbon steel. Generally, this study reveals a new strategy and reference for constructing effective and robust HER electrocatalysts that match with the chlor-alkali industry.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000782775500001

The obtained NiS2-MoS2/PVEIB/PPy/GO nanosheets exhibited the excellent electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). PVEIB played an essential role in the fabrication of this inorganic/organic hierarchical lamellar micro-/nanostructures, which not only played as a good connector between transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) heterostructures and PPy/GO, inducing the formation of metallic 1 T-MoS2, but also effectively stabilized more electrons and further facilitate the Heyrovsky reaction for the generation and release of H2. Though NiS2 possessed poor conductivity and induced partial 1 T-MoS2 transformed to 2H-MoS2 on PVEIB/PPy/GO, the preeminent HER activity was still gained, because NiS2 could effectively prevent the oxidation of MoS2 exposed in the atmosphere. Especially, the crystal phase transition of MoS2 from 1 T to 1 T' phase in NiS2-MoS2/PVEIB/PPy/GO could be detected by XPS after long-term HER test. Therefore, poly(ionic liquid)s and another metal ion would induce the crystal structures of TMDCs and optimize their electrocatalytic performance, which might afford a new thought towards the reasonable design of electrocatalysts based on TMDCs for electrochemical water splitting.<comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment									6	2	0	0	1	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000639367700003

Nanomaterials can be tuned to obtain the desired properties. These methods include modification of the surface by functionalization, controlling the defects at the edge and the basal plane, and doping with metals, other nanomaterials, or heteroatoms. At the lower dimensions, they bear an enhanced surface-to-volume ratio. These act as potential sites for catalysis, and hence, nanomaterials have an immense ability to mediate organic transformations. Although these have not yet taken over the reported metal/ligand-based catalysts completely, one can agree to the fact that nanoscience and nanotechnology have a charisma of their own. Over the years, they have acquired importance in industries as well, chiefly because of their heterogeneous nature that allows one to reuse them in subsequent runs. In this Account, we have made an effort to introduce the readers to the various forms of transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) that have been used in photo or thermal catalysis as well as our contributions in this regard. To date, various accounts or reviews centered around these materials have focused chiefly on energy related applications or electrocatalytic transformations like the water-splitting process, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and the oxygen evolution/reduction reaction (OER/ORR) and electronics such as transistors, solar cells, photodetectors, etc. Also, these materials have gained popularity in drug delivery systems and sensing applications. Very few reports have brought about the role of TMCs in catalysis. Herein, we have laid emphasis on the use of these materials in organic transformations, chiefly categorized as oxidation-reduction reactions and C-C or C-heteroatom bond forming reactions, mediated thermally or photochemically. It is also possible to merge the multifaceted applications of TMCs, as demonstrated in our recent report on the cross dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction synchronized with HER. Apart from this, we have discussed some of the other reactions such as hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) as well. Some of the key challenges persisting in this field include the design of chiral materials for various enantioselective or diastereoselective reactions, correlation of the experimental output with theoretical studies, controlling the extent of doping, and detailed analysis of TMCs mediated organic transformations. In a nutshell, TMC mediated catalysis is a relatively unexplored, yet a highly promising field, and overcoming these challenges would enhance the potential of this field manifold in various sectors.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2643-6728		WOS:000852137400001

In this study Iridium oxide (IrOx) supported on graphitized Vulcan (GV) black (56 wt% Ir) was added as an OER catalyst into the anode of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) (0.1 mgIr/cm(2)). When exposed to intermittent 5-, 10 and 30 minutes of starvation, with 10 min recovery periods, the reversed cell potential was clamped at -0.8 V, mitigating severe carbon degradation. The intermittently starved MEAs regained >95% of their initial performance. After the first event, the performance loss was significant at 4% (0.2 A/cm(2)) with increases in ohmic resistance, thereafter the performance remained relatively stable. Using SEM and EIS, the increased ohmic resistance was attributed to deformation and contraction of the membrane and ionomer reconfiguration which impacted proton conductive pathways. Thinning of the anode was unavoidable, contributing to contact resistance and decreased performance. The Pt and IrOx/GV catalyst remained relatively stable when subjected to multiple short periods of fuel starvation. The IrOx/GV MEA was reversal tolerant and provided insight into the degradation processes which occur during periodic and prolonged fuel starvation.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000621173100001

Interface and defect engineering can modify the intrinsic ion/electron kinetics by regulating the electronic structure. Herein, a polyacrylonitrile/MgFe2O4 (PAN-MFO) electrode with heterojunction and oxygen vacancies was first designed and synthesized as a flexible free-standing anode of FLIBs by electrostatic spinning technology. The PAN carbon nanofiber (PAN-CNF) as the skeleton structure provides fast conductive channels, buffers the volume expansion, and enhances the cycle stability. The heterostructure constructs the internal electric field, facilitates the Li+/charge transfer, intensifies the Li+ adsorption energy, and enhances the interfacial lithium storage. Oxygen vacancies improve the intrinsic conductivity, lower the Li+ diffusion barrier, weaken the Fe-O bonding, and facilitate the conversion reaction. Because of the synergistic effect of the multifunctional structure, the PAN-MFO shows superior cycle and rate performance with ultrafast kinetics. Flexible LiCoO2/PAN-MFO full pouch cells were also assembled that demonstrated a stable cycle performance and power supply in both the plain and bent states.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000787543300050	35226473

Among two-dimensional materials, the deficiency of surface active sites and a high band gap restrict the catalytic activity of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) material towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which hinders its applicability in fuel cells. A bane to boon strategy has been introduced here by coupling two sluggish ORR materials (hBN & MoS2) by a probe-sonication method to form a heterostructure (termed HBPS) which fosters four electron pathways to assist the reduction of oxygen. Theoretical and experimental studies suggest the kinetically and thermodynamically favorable formation of boron vacancies (B-vacancies) in the presence of MoS2, which act as active sites for oxygen adsorption in HBPS. B-vacancy induced uneven charge distribution together with band gap depression promote rapid electron transfer from the valance band to the conduction band which prevails over the kinetic limitation of pure hBN nanosheets towards ORR kinetics. The formed B-vacancy induced HBPS further exhibits a low Tafel slope (66 mV dec(-1)), and a high onset potential (0.80 V vs. RHE) with an unaltered electrochemically active surface area (ESCA) after long-term cycling. Thus, vacancy engineering in hBN has proved to be an efficient approach to unlock the potential of catalytic performance enhancement.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2516-0230			WOS:000667785900001	36134305

Density functional theory calculations unraveled that S vacancies involved in MoS3 played a crucial role in activating the NRR via a consecutive mechanism with a low energetics barrier and simultaneously suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction.

As one member of the transition-metal phosphides, CoxP-based materials have been widely explored as electrocatalyts; however, their application in the traditional thermal catalysis are rarely reported. In this work, cobalt phosphide/carbon nanocubes are designed and their catalytic activity for the selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes to anilines is studied. A high surface area metal-organic framework (MOF), ZIF-67, is infused with red phosphorous, and then pyrolysis promotes the facile production of the phosphide-based catalysts. The resulting composite, consisting of Co2P/CNx nanocubes, is shown to exhibit excellent catalytic performance in the selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes to anilines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing catalytic activity of a cobalt phosphide in nitroarenes hydrogenation.									57	7	0	0	2	0	61			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000428376900006	29265577

The photoanode was obtained by a gold electrode (GE) modified with carboxylic acid functionalized SH-Calix-4-arene-COOH and IrO2 nanoparticles attached light absorbing cyanine dye via polymeric oligoaniline linkages. The conductive polymer, 4- (4H-Dithieno [3,2-b: 2', 3'-d] pyrrol-4-yl)aniline, was coated on GE using electropolymerization and used as a photocathode after platinum nanoparticles (Pt) were attached on the surface. The system was illuminated under the visible light, and the water was oxidized via IrO2 catalyst to produce hydrogen on the photocathode side while oxygen on the photoanode. A photocurrent density of 182.03 mu A cm(-2) was obtained by direct transfer of electrons without using a mediator. The bilirubin oxidase (BOx) enzyme was successfully used to remove excess oxygen from the reaction chamber and a further increase in photocurrent was reached up to 272.44 mu A cm(-2).

In this work, hollow FeP nanoparticles densely encapsulated in carbon nanosheet frameworks (donated as hollow FeP/C nanosheets), in situ converted from Fe-glycolate precursor nanosheets through carbonization and subsequent phosphorization, are designed and synthesized as an advanced electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. FeP hollow nanoparticles are transformed from intermediate Fe3O4 nanoparticles through the nanoscale Kirkendall effect. The two-dimensional architecture, densely embedding FeP hollow nanoparticles, provides abundant accessible active sites and short electron and ion pathways. The in situ generated carbon nanosheet frameworks can not only offer a conductive network but also protect the active FeP from oxidation. As a result, hollow FeP/C nanosheets exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction in 0.5 m H2SO4 with a quite low overpotential of 51.1 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 41.7 mV dec(-1), and remarkable long-term stability. The study highlights the in situ synthesis of two-dimensional metal phosphide/C nanocomposites with highly porous features for advanced energy storage and conversion.									54	4	0	0	4	0	55			2198-3844			WOS:000458118100016	30775234

Reduced ferredoxins can also lose electrons to molecular oxygen, which may lower the availability of electrons for cellular or synthetic reactions. Ferredoxins thus play a key role in diverse kinds of redox biochemistry, especially the enzymatic H-2 production catalyzed by [FeFe] hydrogenases. We investigated how the yield of anaerobic and aerobic H-2 production vary among the four different types of ferredoxins that are used to deliver electrons extracted from NADPH within the synthetic, fermentative pathway. We also assessed the electron loss due to O-2 reduction by reduced ferredoxins within the pathway, for which the difference was as high as five-fold. Our findings provide valuable insights for further improving biological H-2 production technologies and can also facilitate elucidation of mechanisms governing interactions between Fe-S cluster(s) and molecular oxygen.									1	1	0	0	1	0	2			2296-4185			WOS:000627746000001	33718343

However, the dispersion and inevitable dissolution of Fe species still need to be addressed through deliberate design. Here, trace amounts of Fe chelated with tannic acid (TA) are precisely anchored to ultrathin Co hydroxides (TF@Co(OH)(2)-t) through a new anodic interfacial coordination assembly strategy: firstly, the ZIF-67@Co(OH)(2) precursor with ultrathin Co(OH)(2) nanosheets vertically grown on the shell, provides abundant active sites and sufficient anchoring regions for subsequent TA-Fe coating; secondly, the TA-Fe ligand network quickly and robustly coats the surface of the Co(OH)(2)via positive potential-driven chronopotentiometry, yielding TF@Co(OH)(2)-t with good dispersion and controllable Fe species. The TA-Fe network efficiently activates Co species and prevents the dissolution of Fe ions. Physical characterization and DFT simulations reveal that the optimized OER activity with 317 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for TF@Co(OH)(2)-500 can be attributed to the accelerated electron transfer, increased active sites, and the moderate fall in d-band center levels due to Fe integration. Moreover, prolonged stability is realized benefiting from the robust TA-Fe coating protecting the actives sites.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000679471700001	34477751

Herein, we have synthesized a series of mixed Fe-Co-MOFs (MFC-MOFs) with low crystallinity by a simple one-step solvothermal method, which can be applied as direct electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction. The broadening and weakened XRD diffraction peaks and the diffused ring in SAED reveal the low-crystalline characteristic of MFC-MOFs. The shifted Co 2p(3/2)and Fe 2p(3/2)peaks in XPS confirm the redistribution of local electrons in MFC-MOFs. The formation of more favorable Co in higher valence state is confirmed in XPS, which is more beneficial to be transformed into active OOH-like intermediates for OER. The optimal MFC-MOFs exhibits a lower overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2), which decreases in 212 and 140 mV compared to that of Fe-MOFs and Co-MOFs, respectively. Meanwhile, a remarkably low Tafel slope (37 mV dec(-1)) and a favorable long-term stability (over 20 h) are obtained on the MFC-MOFs, which are all much superior to those of the as-synthesized RuO2. The enhanced catalytic activity can be mainly attributed to the inter-molecular synergy between Co-MOFs and Fe-MOFs, which affords MFC-MOFs low-crystalline structure and enlarged surface area. The optimized structure in return promotes the exposure of more active sites and remarkably improves the charge transfer capability. Overall, the design strategy based on the inter-molecular synergistic interactions and low-crystalline structure are worthy to be extended to increase the stability, catalytic active sites and electron transfer ability of mixed-node MOF electrocatalysts.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000545905400007

Herein, ultrafine RuPd alloy nanoparticles anchored in MOFs-derived N-doped porous carbon dodecahedrons (RuxPd1-x @NPC) were synthesized by microwave-assisted ethylene glycol reduction method. Due to the synergistic promotion by modulating the composition and structure, excellent HER catalytic performance was achieved in both alkaline and acidic media for the as-prepared RuxPd1-x @NPC electrocatalysts with low noble metal loading. In which, Ru0.7Pd0.3 @NPC exhibited significantly enhanced alkaline HER activity with a low overpotential of only 20 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, Ru0.3Pd0.7 @NPC showed admirable HER activity in acidic media, which delivered an overpotential of 36 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Additionally, the proposed catalysts demonstrated high mass activity and good long-term stability in both alkaline and acidic condition, remarkably surpassing the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The superior activity of the RuxPd1-x @NPC catalysts is attributed to improved intrinsic activity, fast charge transfer kinetics and distinct electrochemical active surface areas after alloying. This work provides a rapid and facile synthesis of highly efficient, durable and affordable alloy electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, major challenges in the fabrication of highly efficient and cost-effective HER electrocatalysts for alkaline conditions are related to the considerably sluggish water dissociation and the massive use of precious metals. Herein, we propose a facile strategy to encapsulate Ru-substituted Co nanoparticles within few-layer N-doped graphene (2-5 layers), exhibiting robust and highly active performance in water electrolysis. The optimized catalyst with a tiny Ru substitution (similar to 5.55 wt%) displays a low overpotential of -34 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), the high mass activity of 10.99 A/mg((Ru)) at -50 mV, and excellent durability in 1 M KOH over 16 h, even better than commercial Pt/C. Experimental and computational studies (density functional theory) demonstrate that the tiny Ru substitution greatly accelerates the water capture and dissociation rates, and improves the electrochemical hydrogen evolution in basic electrolytes. This work delivers in-depth insights into the relationship between the apparent alkaline-HER activity and the intermediate adsorbed state and provides a promising strategy for designing and synthesizing efficient electrocatalysts that enhance the alkaline-HER activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000762842400003

In order to reveal the non-equilibrium reaction mechanism, online mass spectrometry and O-18(2)-(CO2)-C-13 dual isotope gases were used to analyze the decarburization process in real time. The results show that the real-time analysis method can reflect the evolution process dynamically. Although the overall decarburization rate keeps basically constant, the proportion of O-2 directly producing CO2 decreases, whereas the proportion of post-combustion increases because part of the injected O-2 and produced CO undergo a post-combustion reaction on the surface layer. O-2 still reacts with [C] to form CO2 when the gas supply is sufficient, but when the gas supplies are critical and insufficient, the proportion of O-2 reacting with [C] to form CO2 decreases to 0 and O-2 only reacts to form CO during the decarburization.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1047-4838	1543-1851		WOS:000744390700003

The high degradation power of these advanced oxidation processes is due to the large production of hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot), a strong oxidizing agent, by reaction between H2O2 and Fe2+ in the solution to be treated. These radicals are used to oxidize organic pollutants to aromatic and aliphatic intermediates through subsequent oxidation until complete mineralization. Degradation kinetics and evolution of the chemical composition of treated solutions in each process was followed by high performance liquid chromatography. The mineralization efficiency was determined by chemical oxygen demand analysis. The effect of experimental parameters such as initial herbicide concentration, hydrogen peroxide concentration, ferrous ion concentration and applied current on the degradation kinetics was examined. Better degradation and mineralization efficiency were observed in photo-Fenton and electro-Fenton processes compared with conventional Fenton process. A pseudo-first order kinetic model was employed to describe the result and determine the apparent and absolute rate constants of the reaction between hydroxyl radicals and herbicides.									37	1	0	0	22	0	38			0959-3330	1479-487X		WOS:000256961300001	18661732

The optimal Cu@Cu-N-C catalyst obtained at 1000 degrees C features a hollow polyhedral morphology, which is resulted from the carbothermal reaction of in-situ generated Cu2O and ZnO with carbon beyond 800 degrees C. The best-performance Cu@Cu-N-C exhibits an impressive catalytic bifunction towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) which is assumed to be imparted by the unique Cu(0)Cu(II)-N-x active sites. In alkaline electrolyte, it shows the ORR performance (E-1/2 = 0.83 V vs RHE) comparable to Pt/C (E-1/2 = 0.85 V vs RHE), and the assembled zinc-air (Zn-air) battery displays an excellent durability with the open circuit voltage (1.23 V) decaying only by ca. 4.2% in 80 hat 20 mA cm(-2). For CO2RR, it also delivers an outstanding catalytic performance converting CO2 into CO with a high Faradaic efficiency (90% at -0.5 V vs RHE). Control experiments have indicated that the potential synergistic interactions between Cu (0) (from Cu NPs) and Cu-N-x sites have promoting effects on both ORR and CO2RR. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, hierarchical flower-like CoS2-MoS2 heterostructure hybrid spheres grown on carbon cloth (CoS2-MoS2/CC) were prepared by sulfuring wheel-shaped polyoxometalate {Co20Mo16}. The as-prepared CoS2-MoS2/CC as bifunctional electrocatalyst manifests excellent alkaline oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution activities with low overpotentials of 240 mV for OER and 60 mV for HER at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. When assembled as two-electrode cell, CoS2-MoS2/CC delivers an extremely low cell voltage of 1.52 V at 10 mA cm(-2) accompanied with remarkable long-term durability. Additionally, CoS2-MoS2/CC exhibits favorable overall-water-splitting performance in simulated seawater. The superior performance of CoS2-MoS2/CC should be ascribed to the optimized intrinsic electron structure via electron transfer from MoS2 to CoS(2)along with the synergistic effect of well-exposed heterostructure interfaces and favorable diffusion channels.

Despite this, there remains a poor understanding of the extent, duration, and the factors limiting this process on a reservoir scale. Here we show how a combination of petrography, fluid inclusion, rare earth element (REE), and carbon (delta C-13), oxygen (delta O-18), and sulfur (delta S-34) stable isotope data can disentangle the fluid history of the world's largest CO2 accumulation, the LaBarge Field in Wyoming, USA. The carbonate-hosted LaBarge Field was charged with oil around 80 Ma ago, which together with nodular anhydrite represent the reactants for TSR. The nodules exhibit two distinct trends of evolution in delta C-13 with both delta S-34 and delta O-18 that may be coupled to two different processes. The first trend was interpreted to reflect the coupled dissolution of anhydrite and reduction to elemental sulfur and the oxidation of organic compounds and associated precipitation of calcite during TSR. In contrast, the second trend was interpreted to be the result of the hydrothermal CO2 influx after the cessation of TSR. In addition, mass balance calculations were performed to estimate an approximate TSR reaction duration of 80 ka and to identify the availability of organic compounds as the limiting factor of the TSR process. Such an approach provides a tool for the prediction of TSR occurrence elsewhere and advancing our understanding of crustal fluid interactions.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			1525-2027			WOS:000458607200018

Single-atom catalysis (SAC) is recognized to have high potential in this area due to its rich chemical and physical properties. In this work, we proposed a Mo atom anchored covalent organic framework (MoPc-TFPN) for photo-assisted electrocatalysis of the N-2 reduction reaction using first-principles calculations. Our theoretical results demonstrated that this MoPc-TFPN catalyst has a considerably low onset potential of -0.24 V, which is comparable to or better than those of widely used noble catalysts. Because Mo denotes electrons to the Pc-TFPN substrate, the positive charged Mo has low binding affinity to H, thus greatly suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). More importantly, the MoPc-TFPN has appropriate band edges with high light-absorption efficiency, which could be beneficial to improve the electrocatalytic efficiency of the NRR. This work uncovers a promising strategy for nitrogen fixation by photo-enhanced electrocatalysis under ambient conditions which could combine the ultimate functions of 2D semiconducting nanostructures for high performance catalysis.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000672528000001

Metallic Ru has proven to be one of the promising candidates for the HER. However, the syntheses of Ru nanoparticles in previous reports require harsh reaction conditions such as high temperature or very strong external reductants. Herein, we report an extremely simple and mild method to prepare ultra-small Ru nanoparticles in situ inlaid into a Ni(OH)(2) nanoarray grown on Ni foam (Ru/Ni(OH)(2)/NF) through the spontaneous oxidation-reduction reaction strategy. In 1.0 M KOH, this self-supported material displays a high HER activity with an overpotential as low as 25 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), as well as a low Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1). When assembled in a device for overall water splitting, it achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.50 V and shows outstanding long-term stability even at 50 mA cm(-2). The present work provides a facile and green strategy to prepare non-Pt HER electrocatalysts and it can be applied to the development of new photo-and electrocatalysts.									46	0	0	0	3	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472225200020

The catalytic performance can be further enhanced by improving the intrinsic catalytic activity, exposing more active sites and coupling with conductive support. Herein, a novel electrocatalyst based on nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxides decorates with uniformly distributed CoPx nanoparticles with a suitable P/Co ratio (x = 1.7) via a facile and mild condition. The optimized composite (CoPx/N-rGO) exhibits superior electrocatalytic HER activities with a low overpotential of 104 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)), a small Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1), and long-term stability in the alkaline media, comparable to the performance of other HER electrocatalysts. The remarkable HER performance can be ascribed to the good electrical conductivity of rGO and extra active sites created by nitrogen doping. In addition, the ultrafine nanostructure (average particle size approximate to 4 nm) and well-dispersed CoPx nanoparticles also help expose more active sites for electrocatalytic reactions, largely hindering the agglomeration and exfoliation. This work provides a versatile route on the design of multifunctional composite materials for renewable energy research with low cost and high activity.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2196-7350			WOS:000441125500026

The CCLGDL design with only 0.08 mg(Ir) cm(-2) can achieve comparative cell performances to the conventional commercial electrode design, saving approximate to 97% Ir catalyst and augmenting a catalyst utilization to approximate to 24 times. CCLGDLs with regulated patterns enable insight into how pattern morphology impacts reaction kinetics and catalyst utilization in PEMECs. A specially designed two-sided transparent reaction-visible cell assists the in situ visualization of the PEM/electrode reaction interface for the first time. Oxygen gas is observed accumulating at the reaction interface, limiting the active area and increasing the cell impedances. It is demonstrated that mass transport in PEMECs can be modified by tuning CCLGDL patterns, thus improving the catalyst activation and utilization. The CCLGDL concept promises a future electrode design strategy with a simplified fabrication process and enhanced catalyst utilization. Furthermore, the CCLGDL concept also shows great potential in being a powerful tool for in situ reaction interface research in PEMECs and other energy conversion devices with solid polymer electrolytes.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000756612600001	35174962

In the deposition solution containing various amount of (NH4)2MoS4 and NaOH, amorphous MoSx films have been electrochemically deposited on carbon cloth by using constant potentials method under ambient conditions. The X-ray diffraction patterns show that the resulted samples are amorphous, X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectrum reveal that amorphous MoSx exists defective MoV=O sites coordinated with bridged sulfur. The electrodepositing conditions have been optimized and the optimal MoSx electrode exhibits overpotential of 156 mV in 0.5 mol L-1 H2SO4 and 232 mV in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH without iR correction for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at current density of 10 mA cm-2, which surpasses the property of most of the amorphous MoSx-based electrodes. On the basis of MoV=O as the proposed active sites, the possible catalytic pathway is suggested. More importantly, the optimized MoSx electrode shows excellent stability for HER in acidic and alkaline electrolyte. This approach for synthesis of MoSx in alkaline electrolyte may be developed as effective way to prepare high-performance electrocatalytic electrode for HER. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, direct visualization of the defect structures and their evolution mechanism is lacking. Herein, aberration-corrected and in situ transmission electron microscopy was complemented by theoretical calculations to investigate the effect of temperature on the defect evolution behavior during hydrogenation treatment. Low processing temperature (100-300 degrees C) leads to the occurrence of randomly distributed oxygen vacancies within WO3-x nanosheets. At higher temperatures, oxygen vacancies become highly mobile and aggregate into stacking faults. Planar defects are prone to nucleate at the surface and develop in a zigzag form at 400 degrees C, while treating at 500 degrees C promotes the growth of {200}-type stacking faults. Our work clearly establishes that the atomic configuration of the defects in WO3-x samples could be manipulated by regulating the hydrogenation temperature. This study not only expands our understanding of the structure-function relationships of sub-stoichiometric tungsten oxides but also unlocks their full potential as advanced catalysts by tuning stoichiometry in a controlled manner.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000737995900001	34958188

In this context, we built heterostructures of multilayered CoNi-cyanide bridged coordination (CoNi-CP) nanosheets and graphene oxide (GO) sheets (CoNi-CP/GO) as a source for heterostructured functional electrodes. The layered CoNi-CP/GO hybrid components heated in nitrogen gas (N2) at 450 degrees C yield CoNi-based carbide (CoNi-C) through thermal decomposition of CoNi-CP, while GO is converted into reduced GO (rGO) to finally form a CoNi-C/rGO-450 composite. The CoNi-C/rGO-450 composite shows a reasonable efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through water oxidations in alkaline solution. Meanwhile, regulated annealing of CoNi-CP/GO in N2 with thiourea at 450 and 550 degrees C produces CoNi-based sulfide (CoNi-S) rather than CoNi-C between rGO sheets co-doped by nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) heteroatoms (NS-rGO) to form CoNi-S/NS-rGO-450 and CoNi-S/NS-rGO-550 composites, respectively. The CoNi-S/NS-rGO-550 shows the best efficiency for electrocatalytic OER among all electrodes with an overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 79.5 mV dec(-1). By applying the iR compensation to remove resistance of the solution (2.1 O), the performance is further improved to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 274 mV with a Tafel slope of 70.5 mV dec(-1). This result is expected to be a promising electrocatalyst compared to the currently used electrocatalysts and a step for fuel cell applications in the future.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000571433500023	32805866

However, it is a long shot for the grand-scale applications of Li-O-2 battery at current stage owing to its significant polarization, inferior cycling life, and irreversible decomposition of Li2O2 . Herein, a facile way of preparing the highly dispersed Co-based nanoparticles encapsulated into porous N-doping carbon polyhedral with the low content of Ru modification (LRu@HDCo-NC) is explored through the pyrolysis of Co/Zn based zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) containing Ru-based ligands. Even with the very small amount of Ru introduction (1.8%), LRu@HDCo-NC still exhibits the superior oxygen evolution reaction/oxygen reduction reaction (OER/ORR) performance and also inhibits side reactions in Li-O-2 battery because of the abundant pores, plentiful surface N heteroatoms, and highly dispersed metal-based sites which are induced by the volatilization of Zn, and conductive/stable carbon skeleton derived from ZIFs. When applied in Li-O(2 )batteries, LRu@HDCo-NC cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 15,973 mAh.g(-1) at 200 mkg(-1), good capacity retention at higher rate (12,362 mAh.g(-1) at 500 mA.g(-1)) and outstanding stability for > 300 cycles with low voltage polarization of < 2.3 V under a cut-off capacity of 1,000 mAh.g(-1) at 500 mA.g(-1) . More critically, a series of ex situ and in situ characterization technologies disclose that the LRu@HDCo-NC cathodes can effectively promote the reversible reactions in Li-O-2 batteries.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000714511900003

Electrocatalysts and photocatalysts are essential components determining the performance of water electrolyzers and photocatalytic reactors, respectively. Currently, there is a pressing need to develop efficient and stable electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for large-scale deployment of these devices to reach carbon neutrality. Herein, we report the synthesis of single-atom Ir and Ru anchored on mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (Ir-g-CN and Ru-g-CN), which can be used as electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Remarkably, Ru-g-CN shows a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 12.9 and 5.1 s- 1 at an overpotential (eta) of 100 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively, outperforming Ir-g-CN, commercial Pt/C benchmark and many other advanced HER catalysts reported recently. Moreover, Ru-g-CN can deliver an exceptionally high mass activity of 24.55 and 8.78 A mg- 1 at eta = 100 mV in acidic and alkaline solutions, meanwhile exhibiting a high apparent current density, which is favorable for practical applications. Additionally, both Ru-g-CN and Ir-g-CN show outstanding catalytic stability, continuously catalyzing the HER in acidic and alkaline conditions for 120 h with minimal degradation. Besides, when used for photocatalytic water splitting, Ru-g-CN can achieve a high hydrogen production rate of 489.7 mmol H2 gRu- 1 h-1, and shows good photocatalytic stability. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that loading Ir and Ru single-atoms on g-CN alters the electronic structure, resulting in a reduced bandgap and improved electrical conductivity, facilitating electron transfer during the catalysis. Moreover, the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption on Ru-g-CN and Ir-g-CN is also substantially lowered, enhancing HER performance.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000804054800002

Herein, the conjugated monomer 3,6-dibromopyridazine (DBP) is integrated within polymeric carbon nitride (PCN named as CNU = carbon nitride containing urea precursor ) via thermal condensation, which is designated as CNU-DBP. These samples are used for the first time in the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 reduction and hydrogen (H-2) evolution through water splitting. Such integration intimidates the electron density, promoting charge transfer separation and elevating the photocatalytic activity of CNU under visible light illumination. The superior sample such as CNU-DBP9.0 after 4 h of photooxidation generates 65.7 mu mol of CO and 17.3 mu mol of H-2 of the reaction system, emphasizing the highest photocatalytic activity. The H-2 evolution rate (HER) for pristine CNU is found as 11.9 mu mol h(-1) whereas for CNU-DBP9.0 it is estimated at 178.2 mu mol h(-1) with 15 times greater activity. This process predicts a significant diversion in the specific area, bandgap, and chemical composition and promotes the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers from the ground state to the excited state of CNU, thereby considering it a best candidate for the photoreduction of CO2 source and water splitting into H-2.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000690702300001

Nevertheless, the essence of electrode function mechanism of catalysts remains unclear. Therefore, design and optimization of catalysts are restricted. Herein, an in situ Raman spectroscopy method is employed to directly measure the electrode properties of the NiCo double hydroxides (NiCo DHs) under working conditions. Given definitely evidence, the evolution process of in situ Raman spectra shows that the Ni element is converted to NiOOH under UOR potentials, while the Co dopant is converted to CoOOH and further to higher-valence CoO2 species. Obviously, the catalytically active phase toward UOR is really a complex NiOOH-CoOOH-CoO2 phase. Accurately matched spectral wavenumbers and electrochemical measurements of the catalytic electrodes explicitly reveal that the addition of Co assuredly reduces the onset potential for electroactive NiOOH formation. The Raman results also indicate effects of the Ni-O bond elongation and increased disorder caused by Co doping. Herein, an important understanding and new mechanistic perspectives for the electrode reaction process of UOR with NiCo binary catalysts are provided.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000755613900001

Using a standard model of chemical evolution of the Galaxy we have reproduced the solar neighborhood abundance data and estimated the oxygen and iron yields of genuine SN II origin. The estimated yields are compared with the theoretical yields to derive the relation between the lower and upper mass limits in each generation of stars and the initial mass function (IMF) slope. Independent of this relation, we furthermore derive the relation between the lower mass limit and the IMF slope from the stellar mass-to-light ratio in the solar neighborhood. These independent relations unambiguously determine the upper mass limit of m(u) = 50 +/- 10 M-. and the IMF slope index of 1.3-1.6 above 1 M-.. This upper mass limit corresponds to the mass beyond which stars end as black holes without ejecting processed matter into the interstellar medium. We also find that the IMF slope index below 0.5 M-. cannot be much shallower than 0.8.									56	0	0	0	0	0	56			0004-637X			WOS:A1997XJ16700023

The powder mixture with 20% wt. content of reinforcing ceramic was investigated throughout this research. The mixed powders were cold pressed and sintered in a vacuum at 1030 degrees C. The SHS reaction between sintered feed powders resulted in a rapid temperature increase from the heat generated. The temperature increase led to the melting of an aluminum-based metallic liquid. The metallic liquid infiltrated the porous SiO(2)ceramics. Silicon atoms were transited into the intermetallic iron-aluminum matrix. Subsequently, a ternary matrix from the Fe-Al-Si system was formed, and synthesis of the oxygen and aluminum occurred. Synthesis of both these elements resulted in formation of new, fine Al(2)O(3)precipitates in the volume of matrix. The proposed microstructural evolution model for growth of ultra-fine Al(2)O(3)oxides from SiO(2)silica ceramic decomposition during SHS was successfully verified through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis and X-ray diffraction (XRD).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1996-1944		WOS:000550198300001	32585925

Herein, we first demonstrate that well-designed S-vacancies on SnS2 atomic thin layers (denoted V-S-SnS2) can directly enhance water oxidation in the overall photocatalytic CO2 reduction by promoting the formation of molecular O-2. As a result, an average 8.2 times higher CO2 photoreduction efficiency (CO evolution rate of 25.71 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) was obtained on the champion V-S-SnS2 (23.07%) catalyst than that on the pristine SnS2 catalyst (CO evolution rate of 3.14 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) upon white light illumination. Two types of water decompositions (1660 cm(-1)/1620 cm(-1)) that vary with the S-vacancy concentration were observed by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), demonstrating the key role of the S-vacancy-induced water decomposition configuration (1660 cm(-1)). Kinetic analysis confirms that the water decomposition reaction is the rate-determining step in the overall CO2 photoreduction and was indeed accelerated on S-vacancy sites (k(1660) = -0.033/k(1620) = -0.021). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that S-vacancies facilitate the OER by lowering the energy barriers of intermediate transformations.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000759748300001

These measurements are employed to determine the quasi-steady-state densities of surface accumulated holes, p(s), and correlate these with photocurrent density as a function of light intensity, allowing a rate law analysis of the water oxidation mechanism. The reaction order in surface hole density is found to be first order for p(s) < 1 nm(-2) and third order for p(s) > 1 nm(-2). The effective turnover frequency of each surface hole is estimated to be 14 s(-1) at AM 1.5 conditions. Using a single-electron redox couple, potassium ferrocyanide, as the hole scavenger, only the first-order reaction is observed, with a higher rate constant than that for water oxidation. These results are discussed in terms implications for material design strategies for efficient water oxidation.									55	1	0	0	7	0	55			2380-8195			WOS:000389617900022

Through the application of TPD theory, the activation energies of the thermal decomposition reactions in various gaseous atmospheres (helium, oxygen, air, ozone/air mixture) were also calculated. The results of these investigations showed that an increased calcination heating rate had a direct correlation with an increased rate of weight loss. The template removal reaction in an inert atmosphere (helium) was endothermic; however, the presence of oxidizing components in the gas atmosphere gave rise to significant exothermic reactions. We found that the least stressful conditions for template removal occurred with a heating rate of 0.5 K/min in an atmosphere containing a mixture of air and ozone (1%). For these conditions, the maximum rate of weight loss was 0.061%/min, and the temperature at maximum weight loss was 487 K; the template was fully removed at a final temperature of ca 723 K.									19	1	0	0	1	0	20			0888-5885			WOS:000171825900019

In this paper the parameters for both the cathodic reactions and anodic catalytic activity are independently studied from each other using graphite electrode. The cathode based electro-Fenton and anodic electro-chlorination has been studied for degradation and decolorization of Reactive Black 5 (RB 5) dye. Process parameter interaction and optimization has been done using response surface methodology (RSM), central composite design matrix with statistical analysis including ANOVA and 3D plots. Electro-Fenton treatment was studied for pH, catalyst concentration, current applied and distance between the electrodes with pH, catalyst concentration and current applied being significant for both decolorization and degradation. Statistical analysis depicted the significant role of pH, current applied and distance between the electrodes in the electro chlorination treatment of RB5. Carbon as cathode was extremely effective however, in case of anode the carbon has low stability near oxygen evolution potential. (C) 2017 The Electrochemical Society.

The Al concentration in the sol for the doped metallic oxide on the electrode was investigated. The surface morphologies of the electrodes were characterized via SEM, EDS, XRD and XPS. The electrochemical properties and stabilities of the anodes were investigated by CV, LSV, EIS and accelerated life tests. The surface of the SnO2-Sb-Al anode was uniform and compact when the amount of doped Al was 2.0 at.%, and it possessed the smallest particle size with a long service life. Moreover, the SnO2-Sb-Al-2 anode had the highest oxygen evolution potential (1.57 V). The mineralization degree of phenol reached 69.2% after 2 h when the effective area of the SnO2-Sb-Al-2 anode was 8 cm(2) and the applied current density was 10 mA/cm(2). Thus, the electrode is suitable for printing, dyeing, and electroplating, while also having potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry and in wastewater cleanup of other refractory biodegradables.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2352-4928			WOS:000571063400001

In this study, amorphous tungsten phosphosulphide nanoparticle (WPS NP)-modified CdS (WPS/CdS) catalysts were successfully prepared by a simple physical mixing method. The activity of the 15% WPS/CdS composite catalyst is the best, and the average hydrogen production rate reached 123 257 mu mol g(-1) in 5 h, and the highest AQE of 9.15% is derived at 420 nm for the 15% WPS/CdS composite catalyst. Simultaneously, five cycle stability tests were performed on the 15% WPS/CdS composite catalyst, and the results show that the 15% WPS/CdS composite catalyst exhibits a high stability. WPS NPs not only improve the visible light absorption rate, but also provide a large number of exposed active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction. These active sites can capture photogenerated electrons on CdS NRs quickly, and can be used for the hydrogen evolution reaction quickly, promoting the transmission and separation of photogenerated charges and inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electron and hole pairs. Thus, the utilization rate of photogenerated electrons generated by visible light is improved, and the activity of the photocatalyst is significantly increased.									23	2	0	0	0	0	23			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000510729400009	31912807

Many research studies have investigated the function of Fe in the OER active phase, such as M(OH)2/MOOH (M = Ni and/or Fe), while, surprisingly, very few studies have examined the function of Fe in the & ldquo;precatalyst & rdquo; system. Accordingly, in this work, the Ni3 & minus;xFexP (x = 0, 0.5, 1) series as an Ni-based precatalyst was employed to inspect the function of internal and external Fe in the Ni-based precatalyst system. It was realized that the sample with internal Fe (i.e., Ni2.5Fe0.5P and Ni2FeP) exhibits efficient OER activity compared to that of the Fe-free one (i.e., Ni3P) owing to the large amount of active M(OH)2/MOOH formed on the surface. This indicates that the internal Fe in the present system may have the ability to facilitate the phase transformation; it was later rationalized from electronic structural calculations that the d band center of the internal Fe (middle transition metal) and Ni (late transition metal) holds the key for this observation. Adding excessive ferrous chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2 & middot;4H2O) as the external Fe in the electrolyte will greatly improve the OER performances for Ni3P; nevertheless, that the OER activity of Ni2FeP is still much superior than that of Ni3P corroborates the fact that the Fe impurity is not the only reason for the elevated OER activity of Ni2FeP and that internal Fe is also critical to the phase transformation as well as OER performance.<comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000844613200001	35929738

Electrochemical study was applied in order to obtain comprehensive information on the mechanism and kinetics of the process of anodic dissolution of aluminium, supplemented by monitoring of surface topography using an electron microscope. The corrosion rate of AA1050 increases with increasing concentration of hydroxyl ions OH-. Cathodic reaction occurs in the form of two competing processes, oxygen depolarization and hydrogen evolution. During anodic polarization process up to +8 V vs Ag vertical bar Ag2O, activation control of the electrochemical process is converted to diffusion control upon reaching the potential approx. 0 V. Instantaneous impedance spectra in Nyquist projection had at least two time constants: high-frequency loop of capacitive character associated with charge transfer process during anodic dissolution and negative low-frequency capacitance loop. Dynainic processes occurring during anodic dissolution of aluminium alloy can be concluded on the base of instantaneous change of electric parameters. Dynamic Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (DEIS) enables continuous impedance monitoring of non-stationary processes, such as anodic dissolution of aluminium in aqueous alkaline environments.

Semiconductor heterogeneous photocatalysis is currently utilized within a wide variety of societally impactful processes, spanning reactions such as hydrogen production and CO2 conversion, to the organic transformation of raw materials for value-added chemicals. Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have recently emerged as a new promising class of cheap and easy to make photocatalytic semiconductors, though their unstable ionically bound crystal structure has thus far restricted widespread application. In this Review, we examine the issues hampering MHP-based photocatalysis and highlight the general approaches being taken to achieve promising and stable photocatalytic reaction environments. Specifically, we outline the adoption of (1) halogen acid solutions (i.e., HX; X = I or Br) for hydrogen evolution reactions, (2) relatively low-polarity solvents for CO2 photoreduction and organic transformations, and (3) the encapsulation of perovskites for CO2 reduction and water splitting. Further, we detail the measures being taken to arrive at intrinsically stable photocatalytic materials, removing the need for atypical environments. With each technology offering unique sets of benefits and challenges, we conclude by outlining potentially promising opportunities and directions for metal halide perovskite-based photocatalysis research moving forward.									221	5	0	0	8	0	220			2380-8195			WOS:000526315900013

Whereas 2D phosphorene does not catalyze the complete water-splitting reactions, O, S, and N coverages improve the situation drastically and become susceptible to catalyze the complete reaction at certain coverages. We find that for all of these dopants, 0.25-0.5 monolayer coverages are thermodynamically more stable and do not introduce midgap defect states and the composite systems remain semiconducting along with the properly aligned valance and conduction bands. Further, within visible light excitation, the optical absorption remains very high 10(5) cm(-1) in these composite systems and the fundamental optical anisotropy of phosphorene remains intact. We also investigate the effect of layer thickness through bilayer phosphorene with oxygen coverages. Finally, we investigate the excitonic properties of these composite materials that are conducive to both redox reactions. The present results will open up new avenues to take advantage of these metal-free phosphorene derivatives toward its outstanding potential in photocatalysis.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000429625600018

This research reports the design and development of novel palladium based metallosurfactant (PdCPC(I)) that belongs to the unique class of inorganic-organic hybrid with striking structural features that are explored for the first time in the HER. The formation of the micelle, molecular orientation and surface characteristics of the metallosurfactant are calculated by conductivity and contact angle measurements. The reduction of palladium in metallomicelles during electrolysis accelerates the HER. Metallosurfactant makes the substrate hydrophilic, which in turn enhances the activity of the modified substrate. The 269 mV and 400 mV (vs RHE) overpotential is required to achieve the 10 mA cm(-2) of current density for PdCPC(I) and CPC, respectively. Tafel slope of PdCPC(I) is 57 mV dec(-1), which signifies that the reaction follows the Volmer- Heyrovsky mechanism in the presence of catalyst. The presence of the palladium in the core of the micelle is certified by ICPMS study. The present electrocatalyst also demonstrates 40 h of electrochemical durability. This work opens the doors toward the enhancement of HER, which fulfills the dreams for future energy resources. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Its mechanistic origin, however, contains some uncertainties. Even for the modern atmosphere, the primary mechanism responsible for the S-MIF observed in nearly all tropospheric sulfates has not been identified. Here we present high-sensitivity measurements of a fifth sulfur isotope, stratospherically produced radiosulfur, along with all four stable sulfur isotopes in the same sulfate aerosols and a suite of chemical species to define sources and mechanisms on a field observational basis. The five-sulfur-isotope and multiple chemical species analysis approach provides strong evidence that S-MIF signatures in tropospheric sulfates are concomitantly affected by two distinct processes: an altitude-dependent positive S-33 anomaly, likely linked to stratospheric SO2 photolysis, and a negative S-36 anomaly mainly associated with combustion. Our quadruple stable sulfur isotopic measurements in varying coal samples (formed in the Carboniferous, Permian, and Triassic periods) and in SO2 emitted from combustion display normal S-33 and S-36, indicating that the observed negative S-36 anomalies originate from a previously unknown S-MIF mechanism during combustion (likely recombination reactions) instead of coal itself. The basic chemical physics of S-MIF in both photolytic and thermal reactions and their interplay, which were not explored together in the past, may be another ingredient for providing deeper understanding of the evolution of Earth's atmosphere and life's origin.									22	2	0	0	7	0	24			0027-8424			WOS:000442351000044	30082380

Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) analyses were performed to investigate the synergistic effect of metal oxides on the surface of rGO nano-sheets in the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) process. The good electrochemical results show that Mn3O4-Co3O4-rGO can be a promising, inexpensive nano-catalyst for application in alcohol fuel cells. In addition, as nanoparticles inhibit cancer cell growth by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), we explored the synergic effect of the three-component synthetic nanomaterial in gastric cancer cells (AGS). Results indicated that Mn3O4-Co3O4-rGO inhibited AGS cell growth by induction of ROS, upregulation of Mir-20a-5p, and downregulation of ZBTB4 gene.

OH radicals have a higher oxidation potential compared with other oxidative species such as free radical O, atomic oxygen, hydroperoxyl radical (HO2), hydrogen peroxide(H2O2) and ozone. In this study, surface discharges on liquids (water and its solutions) were investigated experimentally. A pulsed streamer discharge was generated on the liquid surface using a point-to-plane electrode geometry. The primary generation process of OH radicals is closely related to the streamer propagation, and the subsequent secondary process after the discharge has an influence on the chemical reaction. Taking into account the timescale of these processes, we investigated the behavior of OH radicals using two different diagnostic methods. Time evolution of the ground-state OH radicals above the liquid surface after the discharge was observed by a laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique. In order to observe the ground-state OH, an OH [A(2) Sigma(+) (nu' = 1) <- X-2 Pi (nu '' = 0)] system at 282 nm was used. As the secondary process, a portion of OH radicals diffused from gas phase to the liquid surface and dissolved in the liquid. These dissolved OH radicals were measured by a chemical probe method. Terephthalic acid was used as an OH radical trap and fluorescence of the resulting 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid was measured. This paper directly presents visualization of OH radicals over the liquid surface by means of LIF, and indirectly describes OH radicals dissolved in water by means of a chemical method.

Here, we report hierarchical nanoporous (NP) transition-metal (TM = Fe, Co)-doped Pt3Al intermetallic compounds, which are composed of surface alloys of Pt and TMs with in situ self-grown TM hydroxides in an alkaline environment, NP (Pt1-xTMx)(3)Al/Pt-TM(OH), as highly efficient bifunctional catalysts for the HER. By virtue of the constituent Co(OH)(2) having moderate hydroxyl adsorption to accelerate water dissociation and the Pt atoms facilitating the adsorption/desorption of reactive hydrogen intermediates, the NP (Pt1-xCox)(3)Al/Pt-Co(OH)(2) exhibits superior HER activity in 0.1 M KOH, with a low Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential of similar to 43 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), as well as exceptional durability due to its unique nanoporous structure with stable intermetallic bonds. These electrocatalytic properties outperform state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts, suggesting that multi-site design is suitable for producing highly efficient catalysts towards the HER in alkaline environments.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000509471800019

Electrochemical nitrogen fixation, which is a promising ammonia synthesis method, can achieve artificial N-2 fixation at room temperature and pressure. We report that 5% Co4N/Co-2 C@rGO is a high-efficiency nitrogen reduction reaction electrocatalyst for ammonia synthesis under ambient conditions. The catalyst obtains high NH3 yield (24.12 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1)) and Faradaic efficiency (24.97%) at -0.1 V (vs RHE) in 0.1 M HCl. The addition of graphene reduces CoN to Co2C and Co4N. A high ratio of Co-C bonds improves NRR performance. The excellent performance of the catalyst is attributed to the high proportion of pyridine N and pyrrole N. Data analysis results show that the NRR on the surface of Co4N adopts a favorable Mars-van Krevelen reaction mechanism. Moreover, the Co2C(101) crystal plane is more conducive to NRR.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			2168-0485			WOS:000613726300033

Therefore, effort is required to create clean and sustainable energy resources to address these environmental issues. In this context, hydrogen evolution from water splitting-based photoelectrochemical technologies plays a significant role as a zero CO2 emission fuel. Here, we design and prepare carbon-doped SnO2 nanostructures by a simple single-step thermal decomposition method and coated on a MoS2/p-Si substrate for hydrogen evolution by photoelectrochemical water splitting. The C-doped SnO2/MoS2/p-Si shows enhanced activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction, with an onset potential of -0.17 V at 2.73 mA/cm(2), and high stability for over 45 hours. In addition, the doping of carbon influences the shape of the nanostructures, inducing their transformation from cubical rods to polyhedral structures. This study provides a promising method for the fabrication of heterogeneous photoelectrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000678509400001

Herein, an integration of interfacial engineering and ions incorporation was achieved to develop high-performance hybrid electrocatalyst through a facile phosphidation treatment of Cu2+-doped Co9S8 nanowires arrays (Co9S8-Cu NAs) growth on nickel foam. Through this treatment, cobalt phosphide (CoxP, i.e., Co2P and CoP) nanoparticles are decorated on the surface of Co9S8-Cu NAs, forming a novel ternary CoxP/Co9S8-Cu NAs electrocatalyst. The incorporation of Cu2+ enables the modulation of electronic structures of Co9S8 and contributes to the optimization of reaction immediate energetics. The formed abundant interfaces between CoxP and Co9S8-Cu facilitate the charge transfer and create more exposed active sites, further boosting the HER performance. As a result, the CoPx/Co9S8-Cu NM exhibited high HER activity and stability with a low overpotential of 118 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution, which can surpass many previously reported Co-based HER catalysts. This work highlights the synergy of the interfacial engineering and ions incorporation in the construction of high-performance and stable electrocatalysts for the water splitting application.

In this work, two-dimensional (2D) snow-flake CdS was synthesized via a solvothermal method. Pd-Ni hollow alloy with different compositions were synthesized by a galvanic replacement method, and decorated on CdS surface. The structural microscopic and spectroscopic analysis demonstrated that the formation of PdNi hollow nanoparticles (HNPs) and the decoration of PdNi HNPs on CdS (PdNi/CdS). Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction was performed under visible light irradiation (lambda >= 420 nm). Pd1Ni1/CdS exhibited higher photocatalytic H-2 generation rate about 54 mmol/h/g with a quantum efficiency of 63.97% at 420 nm, which was 1.7-fold higher than that of Pd/CdS (32.4 mmol/h/g). The high photocatalytic performance for Pd1Ni1/CdS was mainly attributed to the strong interaction between Pd1Ni1 HNPs and CdS, and the formation of unique hollow structure of PdNi alloy with porous nature which provided more active sites for H-2 evolution. Additionally, the synergistic effect between Pd and Ni, as well as the 2D morphology of CdS enhance the mobility of photo-generated charge carriers which minimize their recombination in turn enhance the photocurrent and photocatalytic performance of solar water splitting reaction.

In this work, we report hybrid implanted hybrid electrocatalysts that consist of composition controllable Co and Co2P hybrids confined in a defect-rich carbon nanotube (CNT) and N-doped amorphous carbon (ACF) hollow nanocube hybrid (Co/Co2P@ACF/CNT HNCs) derived from ZIF67 nanocubes for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This electrocatalyst was achieved by the simple etching-pyrolysis-phosphidation of Co-centered ZIF67 nanocubes (NCs). When used as an electrocatalyst for the HER, Co/Co2P@ACF/CNT HNCs annealed at 900 degrees C required a minimum overpotential of 78 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and remained highly stable in KOH electrolyte for up to 48 h of electrolysis. Theoretical evaluations confirm that there exist electronic interactions and multiple synergistic effects between the Co/Co2P hybrid and ACF/CNT hybrid, which are responsible for simultaneously modulating the water dissociation, increasing the number of active sites, increasing the electronic states of Co d-bands and optimizing the hydrogen adsorption energy towards achieving high HER catalytic performance. This present work supplied a facile route toward the design of highly active, durable and inexpensive HER electrocatalysts.									41	2	0	0	0	0	41			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472225200030		
J	Hobbs, Charlie; Dailey, Harry A.; Shepherd, Mark					Shepherd, Mark/0000-0002-7472-2300			The HemQ coprohaem decarboxylase generates reactive oxygen species: implications for the evolution of classical haem biosynthesis								BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL				473				3997	4009		10.1042/BCJ20160696				NOV 2016	2016	Bacteria require a haem biosynthetic pathway for the assembly of a variety of protein complexes, including cytochromes, peroxidases, globins, and catalase. Haem is synthesised via a series of tetrapyrrole intermediates, including non-metallated porphyrins, such as protoporphyrin IX, which is well known to generate reactive oxygen species in the presence of light and oxygen. Staphylococcus aureus has an ancient haem biosynthetic pathway that proceeds via the formation of coproporphyrin III, a less reactive porphyrin. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that HemY of S. aureus is able to generate both protoporphyrin IX and coproporphyrin III, and that the terminal enzyme of this pathway, HemQ, can stimulate the generation of protoporphyrin IX (but not coproporphyrin III). Assays with hydrogen peroxide, horseradish peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase confirm that this stimulatory effect is mediated by superoxide. Structural modelling reveals that HemQ enzymes do not possess the structural attributes that are common to peroxidases that form compound I [ Fe-IV=O](+), which taken together with the superoxide data leaves Fenton chemistry as a likely route for the superoxide-mediated stimulation of protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase activity of HemY. This generation of toxic free radicals could explain why HemQ enzymes have not been identified in organisms that synthesise haem via the classical protoporphyrin IX pathway. This work has implications for the divergent evolution of haem biosynthesis in ancestral microorganisms, and provides new structural and mechanistic insights into a recently discovered oxidative decarboxylase reaction.									10	0	0	0	8	0	11			0264-6021	1470-8728		WOS:000393758200020	27597779

Earliest traces of oxygen date from 2.7 Ga, thus raising questions as to what may have caused BIF precipitation before oxygenic photosynthesis evolved. The discovery of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria thriving through the oxidation of Fe(II) has provided support for a biological origin for some BIFs, but despite reports suggesting that anoxygenic phototrophs may oxidize Fe(II) in the environment, a model ecosystem of an ancient ocean where they are demonstrably active was lacking. Here we show that anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria contribute to Fe(II) oxidation in the water column of the ferruginous sulfate-poor, meromictic lake La Cruz (Spain). We observed in-situ photoferrotrophic activity through stimulation of phototrophic carbon uptake in the presence of Fe(ll), and determined light-dependent Fe(ll)-oxidation by the natural chemocline microbiota. Moreover, a photoferrotrophic bacterium most closely related to Chlorobium ferrooxidans was enriched from the ferruginous water column. Our study for the first time demonstrates a direct link between anoxygenic photoferrotrophy and the anoxic precipitation of Fe(III)-oxides in a ferruginous water column, providing a plausible mechanism for the bacterial origin of BIFs before the advent of free oxygen. However, photoferrotrophs represent only a minor fraction of the anoxygenic phototrophic community with the majority apparently thriving by sulfur cycling, despite the very low sulfur content in the ferruginous chemocline of Lake La Cruz.									46	1	0	0	33	0	46			1664-302X			WOS:000347108200001	25538702

In contrast, organic pi-conjugated polymers, especially precisely synthesized ones, have been extensively studied as photoharvesting and charge-separating materials in dry photoelectron-conversion devices, such as organic photovoltaic cells. However, the use of conjugated polymers as photocathodes; i.e., photoelectrocalatalytic reduction-active materials in direct contact with aqueous electrolytes, has been less explored. This review describes the fundamentals of the electrochemistry of water and oxygen reduction, as well as organic semiconductor functions for photocathode activity in water, along with figures of merit for organic photocathodes used to practically produce hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide. Recent research on conjugated polymers in this field is then surveyed after briefly referring to early trial-and-error investigations using conventional conjugated polymers. Basic and very simple designs of robust polythiophene films are demonstrated as examples of successful materials which act as both visible-light harvesters and catalysts for hydrogen evolution and the production of hydrogen peroxide, and as counterparts in combination with conventional oxygen-evolution catalysts. Perspectives for this emerging field are also briefly provided.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000611869600001

The dissolution of galena (PbS) surface in acidic (HCl, pH = 1) and oxygen saturated solution was investigated in an AFM liquid cell at room temperature over 45 h. In this apparatus, solution circulates into the flow-through reactor at high-flow rate and is periodically sampled for chemical analysis. In the first hours of microtopography measurement square etch pits delimited by steps of minimal depth of 1 nm nucleate and growth attaining a maximal depth of 80 nm. After this short stage, surface features evolve by formation of widespread protrusions 1 to 3 nm high and homogeneously distributed, while nucleation and growth of new etch pits is inhibited, and large rough terraces delimited by macrosteps 50 to 100 nm high are formed by dissolution. The solution interacting with galena surface is strongly undersaturated with respect to both galena and anglesite (PbSO4), namely solution saturation state for these minerals decreases during the experiment by more than two order of magnitude, and dissolution rate was then derived from lead concentration in solution. During the duration of the experiment, dissolution rates decrease by more than one order of magnitude attaining a final value of 4.5 +/- 0.5 x 10(-8) mol m(-2) sec(-1). Other dissolution experiments performed using different mineral grains confirmed the reproducibility of the galena surface evolution process. However, protrusion observed at lower hydrogen ion activity (pH = 3)showed a rounded shape. From thermodynamic and XPS data in the literature, we predicted that nanometric protrusions are composed of native sulphur, an intermediate and slowly dissolving phase that, in turn, react with oxygen to dissolve and migrate towards bulk solution in a more oxidised state leg. as SO42-. S2O32-, etc.).We Interpreted that the protrusion dissolution reaction represents the step limiting the rate of the overall dissolution reaction, and the evolution of the rate regime is a transitory stage due to the continuous increase in the thickness of the altered layer that coats the surface. Finally. this nanoscale detailed description of galena dissolution process is relevant in terms of both reaction mechanisms and computational modelling of metal sulphide oxidation processes.

PdAg bimetallic nanoparticles make a close contact interface between g-C3N4(CN) and Zn0.5Cd0.5S(ZCS). Under visible light irradiation, CN and ZCS are both excited to generate electron-hole pairs, PdAg bimetallic nanoparticles act as a bridge between CN and ZCS. Not only can the photogenerated electrons from CN be captured, but they can also be quickly transferred to the surface of ZCS and participate in the photocatalytic reaction to release H-2, and the recombination of charge carriers between the contact interface of ZCS and CN can be significantly inhibited. In addition, the thin CN layer reduces the photocorrosion of the ZCS and enhances the specific surface area of the composite material. After testing, the composite material with 30 wt% ZCS and 4 wt% PdAg demonstrates hydrogen evolution performance, up to 6250.7 mu mol g(-1)h(-1), which is 753 times the hydrogen evolution rate of single-component CN and 12.6 times of ZCS/CN. Compared with single-component and two-component photocatalysts, the ternary ZCS/PdAg/CN photocatalyst achieves significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity.

Various mineral assemblages were used to reconstruct the crystallization conditions of the dyke rock for different stages during cooling. The early magmatic phenocryst assemblage is alkali feldspar + nepheline + augite + olivine + magnetite and indicates liquidus temperatures of similar to850degreesC, silica activities of similar to0.5, and oxygen fugacities of FMQ -1.5 to -3. The groundmass assemblage albite + microcline + nepheline + sodalite + arfvedsonite + aegirine + aenigmatite + astrophyllite indicates lower temperatures of between 600 and 450degreesC. at silica activities of 0.25, and oxygen fugacities around the FMQ buffer. Amphibole composition strongly responds to fluorite saturation and proves crystallization occurred in a system closed to oxygen. Late-stage hydrothermal conditions are indicated by the conversion of nepheline and socialite to analcime and the growth of aegirine on artvedsonite. These late-stage reactions are constrained to temperatures of <300degreesC, water activities of between 0.5 and unity, and oxygen fugacities above MH. The dyke has to be regarded as a small equivalent of the larger Ilimaussaq complex, in which identical differentiation processes proceeded at a scale very different in terms of magma volume and cooling times.									33	0	0	0	1	0	33			0026-461X	1471-8022		WOS:000186962800005

The as-synthesized Ni2P/CFC and Cu3P/CFC as electrodes all show the bifunctional electrocatalytic performances towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), simultaneously all demonstrating the electrocatalytic activities of the furfural hydrogenation reaction (FHR) and furfural oxidation reaction (FOR) in alkaline media. Comparatively, the Cu3P/CFC exhibits higher FHR activity with almost similar to 100% selectivity of the furfuryl alcohol (FAL) product and high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 92.0%-98.0% over the applied potential range of -0.05 to -0.55 V (vs. RHE), while the Ni2P/CFC indicates higher FOR activity with almost similar to 100% selectivity of furoic acid (FA) product and FE of 90.0%-98.0% at the applied potential of 1.2-1.7 V (vs. RHE) in alkaline electrolyte containing 50 mM furfural. The DFT calculations results reveal that the (1-10) dominated Cu3P can obtain higher hydrogen coverage but restricted H-2 desorption compared to the (001) dominated Ni2P, therefore the adsorbed active hydrogen (H) atoms from water can be effectively used for the FHR process, resulting in high FE and current density. The superior FOR activity of the Ni2P/CFC is mainly stemmed from the formed high valence state Ni species during electrocatalysis. Thanks to the superior FHR performance of Cu3P/CFC and FOR activity of Ni2P/CFC, a two-electrode H-type electrocatalysis system assembled with the Cu3P/CFC as cathode and Ni2P/CFC as anode can be constructed for simultaneously electrocatalytic production of FAL and FA with almost similar to 100% selectivity in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte containing 50 mM furfural in each chamber under the given experimental conditions, demonstrating high FE of 97%-99%.									70	5	0	0	6	0	71			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600093

Active and durable hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts must be developed: linking their electrochemical surface area (ECSA) loss to their HOR activity and understanding whether the ECSA loss of carbonsupported platinum group metal-based (PGM/C) HOR catalysts is irreversible (nanoparticles dissolution, detachment, Ostwald ripening) or reversible is pivotal. Using identical-location transmission electron micrographs (IL-TEM) and ECSA characterizations by "CO-like" stripping undertaken pre and post accelerated stress tests (AST), the different degradation mechanisms undergone by monometallic (Pt/C and Pd/C) and bimetallic catalysts (Pd-Pt/C and Pd-Ni/C) are unveiled. Monometallic PGM/C undergo extensive reversible poisoning and irreversible degradation upon operation at low potential, in contrast to bimetallic catalysts, which are less affected. Pd-Ni exhibits the smallest loss of ECSAPGM and HOR activity: it poorly catalyzes carbon corrosion and is hardly poisoned by "CO-like" species.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000707917600003

The solar cell was adapted to provide sufficient photovoltage to drive both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The best results, in terms of photoelectrochemical stability and performance, were obtained with an Ag/Pt layer stack as H-2 evolving photocathode back contact and with a RuO2 counter electrode for O-2 evolution. Under irradiation by simulated sunlight (AM 1.5 spectrum with 100 mW/cm(2)), we achieved 6.8% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency at 0 V applied bias in a two-electrode set-up. This sets a fresh benchmark for integrated thin film silicon tandem based photoelectrochemical devices. In addition, the photovoltage at constant current (-3 mA/cm(2)) was measured over a prolonged period of time and revealed an excellent chemical stability (operation over 50 h) of the photocathode. Furthermore, we present an empirical serial circuit model of the PV-EC device, in which the corresponding photovoltaic and electrochemical components are decoupled. This allows for a detailed comparison between the solar cell and the PV-EC cell characteristics, from which the relevant loss processes in the overall system could be identified. The model was further used to compare calculated and measured photocurrent-voltage characteristics of the investigated PV-EC device which showed excellent agreement. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) was formed by a cathode with a catalyst layer made of Pb/C 20 wt% supported on Toray Paper and a catalyst loading of 0.5 mg Pb cm(-2). The anode was a 2 mg Pt cm(-2) gas diffusion anode fed with H(2). The main advantages of this process are: (1) the electrochemical reactor allows to carry out the electrosynthesis without supporting electrolyte, improving in this way the NAC purification and (2) a pronounced decrease of the electrosynthesis energy consumption due to both, the small internal resistance of the PEMER (electrode gap very small and electrolyte very conductive) and the choice of the H(2) oxidation as anodic reaction in stead of the oxygen evolution reaction from water oxidation.

Thus, we have studied in detail light-driven water oxidation with a trinuclear Ru(bda) (bda: 2,2'-bipyridine-6,6'-dicarboxylate) macrocycle MC3 and its highly water soluble derivativem-CH2NMe2-MC3 using a series of ruthenium tris(bipyridine) complexes as photosensitizers under varied reaction conditions. Our investigations showed that the catalytic activities of these Ru macrocycles are significantly affected by the choice of photosensitizer (PS) and reaction media, in addition to buffer concentration, light intensity and concentration of the sensitizer. Our steady-state and transient spectroscopic studies revealed that the photocatalytic performance of trinuclear Ru(bda) macrocycles is not limited by their intrinsic catalytic activities but rather by the efficiency of photogeneration of oxidant PS(+)and its ability to act as an oxidizing agent to the catalysts as both are strongly dependent on the choice of photosensitizer and the amount of employed organic co-solvent.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2367-0932			WOS:000564303100001

Herein, nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxides (Ni-Co LDHs) were rationally synthesized by a facile method and can be served as efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation. For comparison, Ni-Co LDH nanoflowers have also been synthesized by controlling the synthetic process. The composition and morphologies of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The as-obtained Ni-Co LDH nanocages exhibit a high catalytic activity toward the water oxidation reaction (WOR). The electrochemical results show that the overpotential of Ni-Co LDH nanocages electrode was 350 mV at a catalytic current density of 10.0 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, the Tafel slope was as low as similar to 93 mV dec(-1). The unusual catalytic properties of Ni-Co LDH nanocages could be attributed to the hollow structure and the synergetic effect between Ni metal and Co metal.									21	0	0	0	3	0	21			1452-3981			WOS:000417122400008

However, the practical realization of Li-O-2 batteries is still confronted with the challenge of electrode side reactions that lead to severe solvent/electrode degradation upon cycling. To understand the reaction process on the electrode, it is necessary to obtain detailed information about the chemicals formed on the Li-O-2 battery electrode. Herein, a universal method to fabricate large-area regularly patterned gold nano-dots using an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) mask was developed. The gold nano-dots were patterned on to conductive substrates such as Au film and graphene, and then the films were used as SERS (Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy)-active cathodes in Li-O-2 batteries. The discharge products on the different electrodes (graphene and gold) were analyzed and the results indicated that the SERS electrode will be a useful tool for studying the reaction process on lithium-air cathodes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2046-2069		WOS:000387621700064

With high nickel content, the cathodes are of great interest for delivering the desired specific energy and energy density. However, the cells still suffer from fast capacity decay and low thermal-abuse tolerance to high voltage. At the highly delithiated state, the damage in the cell is mainly from severe parasitic reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction in the cathode and oxidization of the organic electrolyte. These side reactions rapidly weaken the system's rate capacity and cyclability. Solutions are being sought to provide safe operation and practical application. Three strategies have proven to be encouraging choices: surface coating, a core-shell structure, and a concentration gradient structure. For each strategy, the material architecture, fabrication procedure, operation principle, advances, and challenges are discussed in this review. The prospects for further developments are also summarized.									87	4	0	0	6	0	86			2451-9294			WOS:000430591500008

Multiple electron transfer in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and its slow kinetics represent a serious hedge for efficient water splitting, requiring the design and development of advanced electrocatalysts with porous structures, high surface areas, abundant electroactive sites, and low overpotentials. These requisites are common for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and derived materials that are promising electrocatalysts for OER. The present work reports on the synthesis and full characterization of a heteroleptic 3D MOF, [Zn-2(mu(4)-odba)(2)(mu-bpdh)]n center dot nDMF (Zn-MUM-1), assembled from 4,4'-oxydibenzoic acid and 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-3,4-diaza-2,4-hexadiene (bpdh). Besides, a series of heterometallic MnZn-MUM-1 frameworks (abbreviated as Mn0.5Zn0.5-MUM-1, Mn0.66Zn0.33-MUM-1, and Mn0.33Zn0.66-MUM-1) was also prepared, characterized, and used for the fabrication of working electrodes based on Ni foam (NF), followed by their exploration in OER. These noble-metal-free and robust electrocatalysts are stable and do not require pyrolysis or calcination while exhibiting better electrocatalytic performance than the parent Zn-MUM-1/NF electrode. The experimental results show that the Mn0.5Zn0.5-MUM-1/NF electrocatalyst features the best OER activity with a low overpotential (253 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (73 mV dec(-1)) as well as significant stability after 72 h or 6000 cycles. These excellent results are explained by a synergic effect of two different metals present in the Mn-Zn MOF as well as improved charge and ion transfer, conductivity, and stability characteristics. The present study thus widens the application of heterometallic MOFs as prospective and highly efficient electrocatalysts for OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000820125200001	35699592

Here, we present bottom-up studies for an electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process through molecular activation to systematically control surface catalytic activity corresponding to an interfacial charge transfer in a porphyrin monolayer on inactive graphene. The two-dimensional (2D) assembly of porphyrins that create homogeneous active sites (e.g., electronegative tetrapyrroles (N4)) on graphene showed structural stability against electrocatalytic reactions and enhanced charge transfer at the graphene-liquid interface. Performance operations of the graphene field effect transistor (FET) were an effective method to analyse the interfacial charge transfer process associated with information about the chemical nature of the catalytic components. Electronegative pristine porphyrin or Pt-porphyrin networks, where intermolecular hydrogen bonding functioned, showed larger interfacial charge transfers and higher HER performance than Ni-, or Zn-porphyrin. A process to create surface electronegativity by either central N-4 or metal (M)-N-4 played an important role in the electrocatalytic reaction. These findings will contribute to an in-depth understanding at the molecular level for the synergetic effects of molecular structures on the active sites of electrocatalysts toward HER.									29	1	0	0	0	0	29			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000397126000032	28266680

However, they still require highly active and stable oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) bi-functional catalysts to promote their performance. Here, we report the synthesis of Fe,Ni on N doped carbon sheets supported on N doped carbon nanotubes (Fe,Ni-N-C/N-CNT), which shows ORR activity with a half wave potential of 0.879 V and an OER activity of 315 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Using Fe,Ni-N-C/N-CNT as the air electrode, the fabricated primary ZAB shows a high peak power density of 271 mW cm(-2), and the rechargeable ZAB can stably operate for more than 200 h with a high energy efficiency of 61%, surpassing the conventional ZABs using Pt/C-IrO2. We find that the ORR activity is related to the Fe-N-C species in the catalysts, while thein situgenerated NiFe(2)O(4)nanoparticles under the OER conditions are beneficial for the OER activity. Poly(ethylene imine) used in the synthesis was found to be important for obtaining a high performance catalyst and helps the binding of the carbon sheets containing the Fe-N-C sites to carbon nanotubes and also the capture of thein situgenerated NiFe(2)O(4)nanoparticles. These results demonstrated the high potential of functionalized carbon composites for application in rechargeable ZABs.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000560225400029

The process should be carried out at potentials lower than the potential at which oxygen evolution starts. The reaction rate does not depend on pH in the range from 3.5 to 10. H acid is destroyed by 25% during electrochemical oxidation. Anion radical is one of the products of one-electron oxidation of the substrate. It quickly undergoes deprotonation. The final products of H acid oxidation are as follows: CO2, H2O, NH3, SO42- and at least 7 other organic compounds - naphthalene derivatives. Electrochemical oxidation combined with photochemical reaction causes an increase in the conversion (calculated as a change in TOC) to about 50%. At the same time, COD value decreases by about 70%. Addition of TiO2 catalyst in dispersed form to the solution causes further decrease in TOC and COD to 55 and 75%, respectively. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Although Li-excess materials are regarded as high-capacity positive electrodes, there are several issues in the anionic redox reactions, such as oxygen gas evolution and large resistance, which lead to capacity fading and limitation of high-current operation. Here, we report the high-current operation of an electrochemical cell using the Li2RuO3-Li2SO4 positive electrode in LiBs. The cell using Li2Ru0.8S0.2O3.2 showed a high capacity of 350 mAh g(-1) with an average discharge voltage of 2.9 V vs Li at 25 degrees C. By introducing an amorphous matrix based on Li2SO4, a high diffusion coefficient was maintained during the whole charge-discharge process, and low charge-transfer resistance was maintained even at a high oxidation state up to 4.2 V vs Li. As a result, extremely high current operation, such as 40 C rate, was achieved.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000462944700003

However, the roles of metal oxides in abiotic humification reactions under micro-aerobic remain ambiguous. The aim of this study was to use non-destructive measurement methods to investigate the role of MnO2 in the evolution of humic substances (HSs) during oxidative polymerization of polyphenol-amino acid. Our results suggested a synergistic effect between MnO2 and O-2 in promoting the polymerization reaction and identified that MnO2 alone had a limited ability in accelerating the transformation of fulvic acid (FA) to humic acid (HA), whereas O-2 was the key factor in the process. Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) showed that the evolution in the UV-vis spectra followed the order of 475-525 nm>300-400 nm>240-280 nm in the humification process, indicating the formation of simple organic matter followed by FA and then HA. C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR) analysis revealed that the products under both air and N-2 conditions in the presence of MnO2 had greater amounts of aromatic-C than in the absence of MnO2, demonstrating that MnO2 affected the structure of the humification products. The results of this study provided new insights into the theory of abiotic humification. (c) Higher Education Press 2020									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2095-2201	2095-221X		WOS:000551507700001

The advent of high capacity cathode materials necessitates a clear understanding of the associated reaction kinetics at elevated temperatures. Here, we present a comprehensive thermo-electrochemical analytics approach to study simulated calorimetric experiments and kinetic parameters estimation for understanding material specific thermal stability. In particular, the focus of the present study is on the fundamental understanding of the thermal stability of disparate cathode materials for lithium-ion intercalation chemistry. Unfortunately, stability of high-capacity cathode materials at elevated temperatures is often challenged by undesirable side reactions including oxygen evolution that promotes electrolyte combustion. The electrochemistry coupled thermo-kinetic strategy presented here acknowledges the multiple abuse reactions associated with the cathode active material and electrolyte interaction at elevated temperatures, which is elucidated via thermal runaway potential based on simulated oven test signatures. The proposed thermo-electrochemical analytics could prove decisive in deconvolving the innate thermal instability signatures of electrode electrolyte pairs in Li-ion battery chemistry.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000503919500009

Considering that the oxidation of Na2SO3 is thermodynamically and kinetically much easier than the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), this study proposes replacing the OER with Na2SO3 oxidation to recover the potential energy of SO2 and simultaneously reduce the energy consumption of water electrolysis. First, the influences of the reaction temperature and Na2SO3 concentration on Na2SO3 -assisted water electrolysis (SAWE) were studied. Then, the difference between Na2SO3 electrolysis and water electrolysis was compared under optimum conditions. Furthermore, the long-term stability of SAWE was assessed. The results of this study suggest that the onset potential of water electrolysis decreases from 0.73 V vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE) to 0.28 V vs SCE by replacing the OER with Na2SO3 oxidation. The energy consumption of producing hydrogen by water electrolysis is reduced with the use of the potential energy of SO2. For SAWE, the Na2SO3 oxidation kinetics and hydrogen production rate are improved as the reaction temperature and Na2SO3 concentration increase.									8	3	0	0	1	0	11			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000551544900115

The mechanism of these processes is related with thermal phenomena as a result of which heat is released. When the cell temperature increases substantially the battery can be damaged. This phenomenon is often called thermal runaway (TRA). The present work investigates the changes in positive and negative plate potentials, temperature, current, and gassing rate during thermal runaway. It is established that during TRA maximums in the transient curves of positive plate potential, current, and finally cell temperature appear. These maximums mark four periods in the development of the TRA phenomenon. The processes that take place during each of these periods are elucidated. On ground of the experimental results a model of the electrochemical and chemical reactions that take place in the system is proposed. The thermal effects of these reactions lead to increase of the cell temperature. Water decomposition at the positive plate and water formation at the negative one cause changes in the concentration of H2SO4 at the plate interfaces. When the applied cell voltage is high the increase of the temperature and the changes in H2SO4 concentration lead to changes in the structure and phase composition of the electrodes interfaces. This results in changes of the type of the reactions that proceed at the two interfaces. Exothermic chemical reactions take place at the negative plate. Due to the increased temperature and H2SO4 concentration the positive plate partially passivates and the current goes through maximum and starts to decrease. The changes in Pb/solution interface and the decreased O-2 flow lead to a maximum in the cell temperature. Problems appear when the value of this maximum becomes higher than the temperature limit below which the battery operates normally.On ground of this model of the thermal phenomena during OxCy operation the limits in the cell current and voltage as well as the thickness and type of the separator for which appearance of TRA does not cause battery damage are determined.

The kinetics of Ru(bpy)32+ oxidation fit an electrochemical model of redox catalysis involving electron transfer between the two electrochemically reversible redox couples, i.e. Ru(bpy)33+/Ru(bpy)32+ and Tl3+/Tl+, mediated by the dispersion of microelectrode particles of RuO2.xH2O. In this model, the rate of reaction is assumed to be controlled by the diffusion of Ru(bpy)32+ toward, and Ru(bpy)33+ away from, the catalyst particles.

However, the development of highly efficient cocatalysts remains challenging. In the present work, we construct independent Cr2O3 as an efficient cocatalyst on the crystal facets engineered TiO2 for photocatalytic CO2 reduction for the first time. Moreover, a combined strategy of crystal facets engineering of TiO2 and loading of Cr2O3 cocatalyst is adopted to further promote the charge carriers' separation/transfer. In comparison with the cocatalyst-free TiO2 without facets engineering, 2HF-TiO2/0.2Cr(2)O(3) exhibits near 30-fold enhancement on the CO2 conversion efficiency. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the maximal synergy of crystal facets engineering and cocatalyst loading for well-matched CO2 reduction half-reaction and H2O oxidation half-reaction. These findings not only provide new insights for understanding the role of Cr2O3 in photocatalytic systems but also may shed light on the design of photocatalysts from the perspective of overall photocatalytic CO2 reduction.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000647737300002

In this study, we synthesized thin films of silver selenide (Ag2Se) using a simple thermal evaporation route and demonstrated their electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. The Ag2Se catalysts show improved electrochemical surface area and good HER electrocatalytic behavior (367 mV overpotential @ 10 mA.cm(-2), exchange current density: similar to 1.02 x 10(-3) mA.cm(-2), and Tafel slope: 53 mV.dec(-1)) in an acidic medium). The reliability was checked in 0.5 M sulfuric acid over 20 h. Our first-principles calculations show the optimal energy of hydrogen adsorption, which is consistent with experimental results. The works could be further extended for finding a new catalyst by associating the selenide, sulfide or telluride-based materials without complex catalyst synthesis procedures.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2079-4991		WOS:000495666800115	31618964

Here, we report the successful preparations of carbon xerogels (CX) derived from resorcinol and formaldehyde monomors. Carbon xerogel was further functionalized with transition metals and transition metal dichalcogenides namely; Mo, W, MoS2 and WS(2 )through the hydrothermal process in presence of nickel foam (NF). These binder free nanocomposites were employed as electro-catalysts for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). An outstanding electrochemical activity for MoS2/CX/NF electro-catalyst for MOR was observed that delivered high current density of about 550 mA?cm(-2 )and long-term stability. This outstanding electro-catalytic performance towards MOR for MoS2/CX are due to the unique nanocoil structure of MoS2, which increases mesoporosity and active surface area, allowing for sufficient electrical conductive channels and pathways for electrons. This work could introduce a promising electro-catalyst for large scale commercial fuel cell applications.

Herein, an oxygenated alkynyl carbon material (OACM) was synthesized via the solvent-free mechanochemical reaction of CaC2 and CO2 under mild conditions, and its electrochemical performance as a supercapacitor electrode was investigated. The gas-solid reaction here is efficient and cost effective owing to the mechanical activation of CaC2. The resultant nanosized OACM features a 3D structure with alkynyl-linked oxygenated carbon chains, hierarchical porosity, numerous defects, high oxygen content, and polycrystalline state. The OACM exhibits high electrochemical performance, including a high specific capacitance (121.8 F g(-1) under 0.15 A g(-1)), superior electrical conductivity (1522 S m(-1)), and excellent cycling stability (above 96.6% in 5000 cycles) due to its unique structure. This work provides a new CO2 use and an innovative synthesis approach for high-performance alkynyl carbon materials.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2168-0485			WOS:000675465900008

Herein, we report a strategy for in situ growth of Pt3Ni truncated octahedrons on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets and then obtain an ordered porous catalyst via a template method. Meanwhile, we use the finite element calculation to clarify the relationship between the component structure and performance and find that the performance of the spherical shell microstructure catalyst is higher than that of the disc structure catalyst, which is also verified by experiments. The experimental analysis shows that the ordered porous catalyst is conducive to enhancing electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. In an acidic solution, the overpotential is 25 mV (10 mA.cm(-2)), and the Tafel slope is 22.86 mV.dec(-1). In an alkaline solution, the overpotential is 44.1 mV (10 mA.cm(-2)), and the Tafel slope is 39.06 mV.dec(-1). The synergistic coupling between Ti3C2Tx and Pt3Ni nanoparticles improves the stability of the catalyst. The in situ growth strategy and design of microstructure with its correlation with catalytic performance represent critical steps toward the rational synthesis of catalysts with excellent catalytic activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000836110900003

Continuous Representation of the Proton and Electron Kinetic Parameters in the pH-Potential Space for Water Oxidation on Hematite								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				119	12			6619	6625		10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b00053				MAR 26 2015	2015	Understanding the mechanisms of multielectron and multiproton electrochemical reactions, particularly in the context of solar-to-fuel water splitting, is an outstanding challenge. Historically, Pourbaix diagrams are used to show the influence of potential and pH on the thermodynamic stability of electrode-electrolyte systems. These diagrams do not carry kinetic or mechanistic information, which often restricts their use to cases in which the thermodynamic limit can be assumed. We introduce and construct from experimental data two new types of diagrams that demonstrate the kinetic variations of electrochemical reactions as a function of pH and potential. These diagrams show the variation of the electron-transfer parameter (alpha) and the proton reaction order (rho) in a wide range of potential and pH. We present alpha(pH, E) and rho(pH, E) for water electrolysis on an iron oxide electrode in the range of pH 7 to 13. In these plots, regions of acidic and basic mechanisms, relationship to surface protonation equilibria, and switching between acidic and basic mechanisms due to electrochemical production of protons can be easily identified. The proton reaction order is zero in the acidic side, while it is nonzero in the basic limit. A larger empirical electron-transfer parameter is observed in the basic compared to the acidic region. These observations are related to the differences in oxidation mechanism between the two regions. We propose the use of such diagrams to gain an expanded and enhanced view of the kinetics of multielectron and multiproton electrochemical reactions.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000351970800017

Herein, a threestep process of hydrothermal, electrodeposition and phosphorization was carried out to grow nanoparticulate Se, Fe-Ni2P/Ni12P5 on NF (Se, Fe-NiP/NF) in this work. The catalyst exhibits excellent OER electrocatalytic performance, requiring an overpotential of only 225 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of only 33 mV . dec(-1), and can maintain stability for more than 100 h under alkaline conditions. Remarkably, the surface of the nanoparticles after stability testing was rougher, exposing many very small nanoflakes thus exposing more active sites, which is responsible for its extremely long time stability. The results show that the co-doping of Se and Fe can effectively reduce the energy barrier of electrocatalytic reactions and improve the morphology, which provides a new approach to explore high-performance and corrosion-resistant electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000862935900005

Herein, Ti was post-synthetic exchanged into Zr-based metal organic frameworks to synthesize UiO-Zr-Ti as NRR electrocatalysts. The incorporated Ti is found to function as active sites for NRR and benefit the improved charge-transfer efficiency, which has a positive effect on the high NH3 yield rate. Moreover, the existence of Zr and Ti species can effectively suppress the competing HER, thus leading to high Faradaic efficiency. Therefore, the modified UiO-Zr-Ti-5d shows the highest NH3 yield rate of 1.16 x 10(-10) mol cm(-2) s(-1) and the highest Faradaic efficiency of 80.36%, which is comparable to recently reported NRR electrocatalysts.

In this article, we employ first-principles calculations to explore the potential of modified barium titanate (BaTiO3), an inexpensive perovskite oxide that can be synthesized from earth-abundant precursors, for the design of efficient water oxidation electrocatalysts. Our calculations identify Fe and Ni doping as a means to improve the electrical conductivity and to reduce the overpotential required for water oxidation over BaTiO3. Based on computed Pourbaix diagrams and pH/potential-dependent surface phase diagrams, we further show that BaTiO3 is stable under reaction conditions and is not sensitive with respect to poisoning by reaction intermediates and hydrogen adsorption. This proof of concept demonstrates that even minor compositional modifications of existing materials may greatly improve their catalytic activity, a fact that is often neglected when larger composition spaces are screened.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000387024300059	27748475

Surface wettability of photoanode, which dominates the adsorption and desorption processes of reactants and products, is expected to affect PEC water splitting efficiency. However, its role in PEC reactions and its synergic effects with other intrinsic properties of catalysts in PEC water splitting are still not well understood. Here, we systematically investigated the relationship between the wettability and PEC performance of TiO2 catalysts. The wettability of TiO2 films was successfully modulated by hydrogenation and ultraviolet light irradiation. The hydrophilic TiO2 films showed distinct PEC water splitting performances, which was then found to be determined by the surface wettability and active areas in solid/ liquid/gas three-phase interface in reaction. In addition, the wettability also demonstrates a great influence on the stability of the catalyst. This work reveals that water splitting efficiency of PEC catalysts can be significantly improved by tuning surface wettability, which plays an important role in designing and synthesizing highly active catalysts.

We show the high mass transport, floating electrode technique offers a solution as it adequately describes hydrogen oxidation (HOR) and evolution over a wide potential range, as needed for various electrochemical systems. The peak HOR mass activities measured on the floating electrode were 68-93 A.mg(metal)(-l)- significantly higher than achieved in an experimental setup of an electrochemical hydrogen pump (EHP, 6-12 A.mg(metal)(-1)). This implies that the EHPs operate with a significant mass transport limitation. Additionally, poison tolerances of catalysts using low concentrations of 20 ppm CO produced transient responses over ca. 500 s which correctly followed the CO tolerances determined from EHPs (PtRu/C > Pt/C > PtNi/C). A model of the kinetic transient responses on the floating electrode is provided which aids in describing the catalytic behaviour in poisoned environments.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000521513300012

A series distinct and excellent properties bestow graphdiyne excellent performance in many fields. Here, an innovative progress for preparing graphdiyne by using Cu+ contained material as catalyst is reported and the composite CuI-GD is coupled with flower-like NiAl-LDH to produce H-2 from photocatalytic water splitting. The results of FTIR and Raman spectroscopy together reveal that graphdiyne nanosheets are synthesized successfully by employing a cross-coupling method. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance shows that the hydrogen production activity of CuI-GD/NiAl-LDH has a 15- and 216-fold enhancement compared with CuI-GD and NiAl-LDH, respectively. A series of characterizations are carried out to expound the underlying reasons in the enhancement of the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of CuI-GD/NiAl-LDH. Meanwhile, a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process was proposed to understand the interaction among these materials.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000678658700001

Then, platinum nanoparticles were deposited on the MWCNTs by means of electrodeposition technique. Catalyst materials were characterized by electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and three electrode electrochemical measurements. Catalysts supported on the directly grown MWCNTs exhibit notably better electrocatalytic performance towards methanol oxidation compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Modification of MWCNTs with tungsten carbide was shown to further increase the catalyst performance. It is believed that the superior performance of catalysts prepared on the MWCNTs as catalyst support results mostly from the superior electrical contact and unique spatial configuration of the directly grown MWCNTs, while the positive effect of the tungsten carbide co-catalyst is mostly attributed to its improved resistance towards poisoning with the reaction intermediates produced during the methanol oxidation.

However, despite much research works carried out on them, they have not yet found large-scale applications, mainly due to the unavailability of sustainable catalysts that can catalyze the reactions employed in them. Currently, noble metal-based materials are the ones that are commonly used as catalysts in most commercial fuel cells, electrolyzers, and metal-air batteries. Hence, there has been considerable research efforts worldwide to find alternative noble metal-free and metal-free catalysts composed of inexpensive, earth-abundant elements for use in the catalytic reactions employed in these energy systems. In this concept paper, a brief introduction on catalysis in renewable energy systems, followed by the recent efforts to develop sustainable, heteroatom-doped carbon and non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts, the challenges to unravel their structure-catalytic activity relationships, and the authors' perspectives on these topics and materials, are discussed.									39	3	0	0	2	0	39			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000407397300001	28397303

Mechanistic details of the mercaptoethanol reaction have been elucidated. Mercaptoethanol reacts with Ni(110) to form ethanol, acetaldehyde, methane, CO, and hydrogen. Mercaptoethanol reactivity is dominated by thiolate formation as suggested by the S 2p core level binding energy. Near 200-250 K, the C-S bond cleaves with the evolution of ethanol and formation of surface ethoxide which is easily discernible from vibrational spectroscopy. The ethoxide dehydrogenates to form acetaldehyde, which either desorbs or reacts to form methane and CO. In dramatic contrast, the structurally similar ethanedithiol apparently adsorbs in a bidentate fashion, resulting in a dithiolate which selectively splits out ethylene and produces surface sulfur. The difference in the reactivity of ethanedithiol and mercaptoethanol is understood in terms of the inactivity of the Ni(110) surface toward C-O bond scission, which is primarily a reflection of the strength of C-O bonds compared with C-S bonds.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-3654			WOS:A1995RR25000033

The challenges in such construction mainly include selection of green dopant and control of active sites. Herein, we present phytic acid as a phosphorus source for P-doped TNAs. An oxygen vacancy (Ov) and P co-doped TNAs (P-TiO2-y) was prepared as an electrochemical oxidation anode. P-TiO2-y exhibits excellent degradation activity due to the formation of Ti-O-P bonds and generation of Ov. P-doping was beneficial in improving the oxygen evolution potential of the electrode, which would be benefit for electrocatalytic degradation of pollutants. Using the P-TiO2-y anode with a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for tetracycline degradation, after a 3 h treatment, the removal rate, chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon removal rates were 100%, 90.32% and 76.60%, respectively. The P-TiO2-y also has excellent degradation performance for phenol, hydroquinone, p-nitrophenol and metronidazole.									9	1	0	0	4	0	10			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000653029000004	34030425

Herein, we reported a reliable and universal method to fabricate the leaf-like Co-doped Ni3S2 architecture anchored on Ni mesh. The optimized Co-doped Ni3S2 electrocatalyst exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity toward the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and chemical oxidation as well as excellent durability. Specifically, a significantly reduced cell voltage of 0.80 V is attained at 50 mA cm-2 in sulfion-containing electrolytes, which is about 0.94 and 1.20 V lower than that of urea electrolysis and water splitting, respectively. In situ Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical characterization results imply that the desired oxidation state of the NiIII formed on the surface with shortened oxidation pathway accounts for the increased urea oxidation, whereas a direct electron transfer to surface active sites is responsible for superior sulfion oxidation. In situ spectroscopic evidences further unravel that the sulfion (S2-) were stepwisely oxidized to short-chain polysulfides including S(2)(2-)and S(4)(2-)and then to elemental sulfur (S-8). This work highlights that the integrated overall reaction holds the great promise for saving energy H-2 generation and environmentally friendly recovery of sulfur with enhanced electron utilization efficiency.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773452600002

Monolayer nanosheet was prepared by the above processes, although some bilayer or trilayer nanosheets were also produced. The [Ca2Ta3O9.7O0.2](-) nanosheets exhibited photocatalytic activity for H-2 evolution from water under visible light irradiation. In contrast, CsCa2Ta3O9.7N0.2 exhibited very low photocatalytic activity for H-2 evolution under the visible light irradiation, even when methanol was added to water as a sacrificial agent. The improved photocatalytic activity originates from the characteristics of nanosheets such as their molecular thickness and large surface area. Further, the Rh-loaded [Ca2Ta3O9.7N0.2](-) nanosheets restacked with protons exhibited photocatalytic activity for H-2 and O-2 evolution from pure water under UV-light irradiation. The ratio of H-2/O-2 evolved was around 3. The ratio of N/O in the catalyst remained the same after the photocatalytic reaction, signifying that there was no decomposition of the catalyst during the reaction. This indicates that the present N-doped nanosheet is stable in the photocatalytic reaction.									119	2	0	0	8	0	119			0002-7863			WOS:000309099700034	22928937

In this study, spray-drying combined with thermal decomposition reduction technique is employed to synthesize single-metal Pt, Pt-based multimetallic, and high-entropy alloy (HEA) 3D-nanoframeworks under mild conditions (at 300 degrees C in a H-2 atmosphere). It is found that the as-synthesized Pt 3D-nanoframework shows super-large surface areas of 94.9 m(2)/g and improves electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction and methanol oxidation reaction. Moreover, the addition of the Pt element could decrease the reduction temperature of other metals (Ni, Fe, Co, Cu, Ru, etc.) via the autocatalytic behavior, and thus the Pt-based multimetallic (such as PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe) and PtCoNiCuRu HEA 3D-nanoframeworks are first designed and successfully prepared with a single-phase solid solution under low thermal decomposition temperatures (300 degrees C) in a H-2 atmosphere.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000743706500001

Results indicated that the internal burning-out process represented by shell-like particles at 500 degrees C independent on NO2 concentration, while the development of hollow shells for the soot was suppressed with increasing the temperature. A tendency with soot toward a less ordered arrangement with short and defective graphene layers after oxidizing at 500 degrees C was also observed, which was suppressed with added NO2 and increasing temperature. Many carbon oxygen functionalities produced at 40% oxidation and the intensity of the peak gradually increased as the increase of the oxidation degree, while the increase of the peak intensity became less sensitive with added NO2 and increasing temperature. Abundant micropores and mesopores formed inside the particles during the soot oxidation process depending on oxidizer and temperature, micropores (smaller than 2 nm) were extensively generated at the early stages of the oxidation while mesopores increased sharply after 20% oxidation. The trends were correspondent to the oxidation modes with different oxidizer and temperature. The correlationship observation suggested that soot oxidation behavior was dependent on competing rates of reaction kinetics versus mass transport of oxidizer according to the oxidation evolution of surface and pore.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1536-383X	1536-4046		WOS:000791157900001

Herein, we prepared a novel TiO2@WS2 hybrid via a facile and scalable two-step hydro thermal strategy combined with selective etching. Benefited from acid-etched TiO2 nano belts with rough surface as substrate, ultrathin WS2 nanosheets nucleated and vertically grew into few layers in the confined configuration with more exposed active edges. Furthermore, the partial incorporation of oxygen in WS2 inherited from the remaining O-W bonds of tungsten precursor enhanced the electrical conductivity of the hybrid. Therefore, TiO2@WS2 hybrid was proved to be efficient and durable electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution in alkaline medium. Upon optimal conditions, the hybrid only required a small onset overpotential of 95 mV and a low overpotential of 142 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), superior to pristine WS2 and TiO2. In addition, better cycling stability during the alkaline HER process was also obtained, indicating its capability in future practical application. The synthesis strategy presents a cost-effective approach to produce efficient WS2-based HER electrocatalyst for electrochemical water splitting. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Structural changes in the Mn4Ca cluster and the mechanism of photosynthetic water splitting								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				105	6			1879	1884		10.1073/pnas.0707092105				FEB 12 2008	2008	Photosynthetic water oxidation, where water is oxidized to dioxygen, is a fundamental chemical reaction that sustains the biosphere. This reaction is catalyzed by a Mn4Ca complex in the photosystem II (PS II) oxygen-evolving complex (OEC): a multiprotein assembly embedded in the thylakoid membranes of green plants, cyanobacteria, and algae. The mechanism of photosynthetic water oxidation by the Mn4Ca cluster in photosystem 11 is the subject of much debate, although lacking structural characterization of the catalytic intermediates. Biosynthetically exchanged Ca/Sr-PS II preparations and x-ray spectroscopy, including extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), allowed us to monitor Mn-Mn and Ca(Sr)-Mn distances in the four intermediate S states, S-0 through S-3, of the catalytic cycle that couples the one-electron photochemistry occurring at the PS 11 reaction center with the four-electron water-oxidation chemistry taking place at the Mn4Ca(Sr) cluster. We have detected significant changes in the structure of the complex, especially in the Mn-Mn and Ca(Sr)-Mn distances, on the S-2-to-S-3 and S-3-to-S-0 transitions. These results implicate the involvement of at least one common bridging oxygen atom between the Mn-Mn and Mn-Ca(Sr) atoms in the O-O bond formation. Because PS II cannot advance beyond the S-2 state in preparations that lack Ca(Sr), these results show that Ca(Sr) is one of the critical components in the mechanism of the enzyme. The results also show that Ca is not just a spectator atom involved in providing a structural framework, but is actively involved in the mechanism of water oxidation and represents a rare example of a catalytically active Ca cofactor.									151	1	1	0	74	0	154			0027-8424			WOS:000253261900021	18250316

Depending on the dissolution conditions the timescales of nanoporosity evolution can vary over several orders from sub-second timescales to days, and as such evolution for each condition may appear unrelated. We show that the extent of dissolution (EOD), i.e., the fraction of electroactive atoms dissolved, and not time, is an appropriate descriptor for nanoporosity evolution. Using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations we demonstrate that morphological features obtained over a wide range of temperature, alloy composition, material interactions, etchant concentration and overpotential values are nearly identical for a given EOD. Timescales for different conditions are related by a scaling parameter. Dissolution behavior observed with one experiment can be used to predict results for another experiment, e.g., we relate linear sweep and potential step to constant potential experiments on the basis of EOD. This understanding may be useful for predicting morphology for slow etching/corrosion/leaching conditions from accelerated dissolution experiments as well as design of nanoporous materials.

Current routes of olefin epoxidation either involve hazardous reagents or generate stoichiometric side products, leading to challenges in separation and significant waste streams. Here, we demonstrate a sustainable and safe route to epoxidize olefin substrates using water as the oxygen atom source at room temperature and ambient pressure. Manganese oxide nanoparticles (NPs) are shown to catalyze cyclooctene epoxidation with Faradaic efficiencies above 30%. Isotopic studies and detailed product analysis reveal an overall reaction in which water and cyclooctene are converted to cyclooctene oxide and hydrogen. Electrokinetic studies provide insights into the mechanism of olefin epoxidation, including an approximate first-order dependence on the substrate and water and a rate-determining step which involves the first electron transfer. We demonstrate that this new route can also achieve a cyclooctene conversion of similar to 50% over 4 h.									54	3	0	0	4	0	55			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000465188800038	30963761

The coal self-heating in underground coal seams involves a chain of physico-chemical reactions, which are linked together through compositional gas flow and diffusion, reaction kinetics, energy transport and coal deformation mechanisms. Although coal-oxygen reactions have been comprehensively investigated, fewer studies consider the collective impacts of methane-desorption induced coal deformation and compositional gas concentration changes on the methane-rich coal self-heating. We included these self-heating mechanisms of underground methane-rich coal seams in the revised model. The validation and superiority of the new model were demonstrated against previous results. The model was applied to quantify the self-heating susceptibilities associated with methane desorption diffusion time, coal permeability, differential pressure of leakage, coal-oxidation reaction heat and coal-oxidation rate. The simulation results show that (1) The compositional gas flow in fractures is related not only with coal permeability and methane desorption rate, but also with gas thermal expansion induced self-acceleration effect (2) The desorption methane in coal matrix infiltration into the fractures can not only dilute oxygen concentration and inert combustible coal, but also hinder outside air leakage into porous coal media, even promote the coal self-heating at the later stage due to gas self-accelerating effect and matrix shrinkage. (3) The larger differential pressure of leakage, coal permeability, coal-oxidation reaction heat and pre-exponential factor can enhance coal self-heating, whereas the larger coal-oxidation activation energy may retard coal self-heating. The simulation results can be used to better understand the coupling mechanism of coal-gas-heating interactions associated with methane and coal spontaneous combustion, and provide some suggestions as to how to control the variables or parameters to retard or suppress the symbiosis disasters of gas and coal spontaneous combustion in underground porous coal media.

In this paper, a novel synthesis of truncated octahedral PtNi(35)alloy catalysts that consist of homogeneous Pt-Ni alloy cores enclosed by NiO-Pt double shells through thermally annealing defective heterogeneous PtNi(3.5)alloys is reported. By tracking the evolution of both compositions and morphologies, the outward segregation of both PtO(x)and NiO are first observed in Pt-Ni alloys. It is speculated that the diffusion of low-coordination atoms results in the formation of an energetically favorable truncated octahedron while the outward segregation of oxides leads to the formation of NiO-Pt double shells. It is very attractive that after gently removing the NiO outer shell, the dealloyed truncated octahedral core-shell structure demonstrates a greatly enhanced ORR activity. The as-obtained truncated octahedral Pt21Ni core-shell alloy presents a 3.4-folds mass-specific activity of that for unannealed sample, and its activity preserves 45.4% after 30000 potential cycles of accelerated degradation test (ADT). The peak power density of the dealloyed truncated octahedral Pt2.1Ni core-shell alloy catalyst based membrane electrolyte assembly (MEA) reaches 679.8 mW/cm(2), increased by 138.4 mW/cm(2)relative to that based on commercial Pt/C.									5	2	0	0	0	0	6			2095-1701	2095-1698		WOS:000546885900005

Here, for the first time, we demonstrate a new strategy, taking the catalytic system based on Ni-Co wrapped Ag nanowires (Ni-Co@Ag NWs) for highly effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via in situ electrochemical co-deposition. The introduction of Ag NWs provides a barrier-free network as an expressway for electron transfer to numerous catalytic sites. The synergy effect between Ni, Co and Ag further lowers the energy barrier for facile hydrogen atom adsorption and hydrogen desorption. Meanwhile, the obtained catalyst has a unique Setaria-inflorescence-structure with the Ag core as the "rachis" and the Ni-Co shell as the "pinnules", providing abundant active sites and mass transport pathways. Consequently, this system exhibits a highly efficient hydrogen evolution with an overpotential of similar to 33 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is, to the best of our knowledge, the lowest value compared with those reported previously for Ni-Co binary catalysts. This work presents a new strategy to design high-performance and low-cost metal-based catalysts for the HER.									6	1	0	0	1	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000501213600038

The chloride requirement was specific and the K-m for Cl- was 20 mM. The known inhibitors of O-2 evolution such as NH2OH and NH4+ were strong inhibitors of this oxidase activity. The reduced form of the 33 kDa protein was active as the oxidase. Addition of P-ME abruptly inhibited O, evolution in PSII particles initiating an O-2 uptake, suggesting that the disulfide form of MSP was essential for O-2 evolution activity. While the reduction of the 33 kDa protein by P-ME was shown to be essential for the induction of Mn-II oxidation to Mn-III associated with O-2 uptake, there was 1:2 stoichiometry between O-2 uptake and Mn-III formed and SH disappearance. The geometry of the catalytic sulfhydryl site has been probed by fluorometry using O-phthalaldehyde (OPA). A characteristic 337 nm absorption band observed in OPA-bound protein indicated the formation of thioisoindole derivative at the Mn-II bonding site. The CD spectrum and the fluorescence emission and excitation spectra suggest conformational changes in the oxidized and reduced form of this protein. The results of these studies suggest that tryptophan 241 and two lysine residues of this protein are in close proximity to functional cysteine residues at the active site. In the proposed reaction mechanism for Mn-II oxidase activity, the reduced 33 kDa protein in the presence of Cl- ions catalyses the oxidation of Mn-II to Mn-III associated with oxygen uptake.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0168-9452			WOS:A1994NN55200004

In the photocatalytic chamber of PEHPS, nano-sized Cd(1-x)ZnxS/Pt photocatalysts were utilized. The synthesized Cd(1-x)ZnxS/Pt photocatalysts were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and diffuse reflectance UV Vis spectroscopy.

S2O3-2 produced in the photocatalytic chamber of PEHPS was used as redox species in the electrocatalytic chamber. This process decreased the cell potential of water electrolysis from 2.50 V to 1.70 V on glassy carbon electrodes. Moreover, usage of electro-polymerized metallophthalocyanines (Poly-MPc) as cathode active electrocatalyst, the over-potential of cathode of the electrocatalytic chamber for hydrogen reduction reaction decreased by 0.230 V.

Herein, a highly active and stable metal-free electrocatalyst, N and S co-doped porous carbon derived from human hair, was developed for HER for the first time, with an electrocatalytic performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalysts. SEM, TEM and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements showed that the resultant carbon exhibited a porous structure with a high specific surface area (up to 830.0 m(2) g(-1)) and rich porosity. XPS measurements showed that N and S were co-doped into the carbon molecular skeletons. Importantly, electrochemical measurements showed high activity for hydrogen evolution with a low overpotential of only -12 mV, a Tafel slope of 57.4 mV dec(-1), a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at -0.1 V vs. RHE, and remarkable durability. The results highlight a unique paradigm for the preparation of highly efficient electrocatalysts for HER based on abundant biowastes.									108	1	0	0	6	1	109			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000352489200053

These nanostructures were characterized by different techniques (Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM)), and were evaluated as Hydrogen Evolution Reaction electrocatalysts in 0.5 M sulfuric acid. The effects of varying the platinum amount during the synthesis were systematically studied by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), polarization measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. HRTEM shows that the bimetallic nanostructures display a different morphology compared to that observed for pure Ni and Pt ones. The process of hydrogen adsorption-desorption in the as-prepared electrodes seems to occur in (110) and (100) facets. It was found that the increase in the activity for the HER is due to an increased electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and/or stabilization in the case of elemental electrode materials; and to the effect of Pt amount in the case of the Ni Pt nanostructures (synergistic effect leads to lower overpotential). It has been established that the main pathway for the HER is Volmer-Heyrovsky. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Four different GSTs (MrMuGST1-MrMuGST4) showing similarities with Mu-type GSTs were cloned from the hepatopancreas of Macrobrachium rosenbergii. These four GSTs have 219, 216, 218 and 219 amino acids in length, respectively. MrMuGST1-MrMuGST4 proteins all have a G-site in the N-terminus and an H-site in the C-terminus. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that four Mu-type GSTs are classified into two different clades (MrMuGST2 one clade; MrMuGST1, MrMuGST3 and MrMuGST4 other clades). Nonetheless, no site under positive selection was detected but rapid evolution was found in the few of MuGST genes. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results showed that MrMuGST1 and MrMuGST2 transcripts were expressed in all detected tissues, however, MrMuGST3 and MrMuGST4 were just mainly expressed in hepatopancreas and intestines. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that MrMuGST1 and MrMuGST2 were down-regulated upon Vibrio anguillarum challenge, whereas MrMuGST3 and MrMuGST4 were quickly up-regulated 2 h after the Vibrio challenge. Our results imply that different Mu-type GSTs may respond to Vibrio challenge with different manners. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using glucose as the carbon source for the fabrication of Mo2C is not only environmental friendly but also promotes the formation of nanospheres and improves the dispersibility of the catalysts. The carbon shell formed by calcination also can improve the electron transfer between Ni foam substrate and nanospheres. Furthermore, the carbon shell can act as "armour for catalyst", protecting the Mo2C from the harsh conditions (e.g., strong acidity or alkalinity) and improving the stability of the catalysts during electrocatalysis. The optimal electrocatalyst is Mo2C@NF-850, which only needs overpotential of 42 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction to reach 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 76 mV-dec(-1), as well as satisfactory durability in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte for HER.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000607851200011

However, low cyclability and current rates are two major drawbacks that hinder them from further realization. These issues necessitate the discovery of novel materials to significantly enhance the redox process of discharge products. In this study, a novel catalytic system comprised of tin sulfide (SnS) nanoflakes as a solid catalyst and tin iodide (SnI2) as a dual-functional electrolyte additive is discovered. This system enables operating the battery at high current rates up to 10 000 mA g(-1) (corresponding to 1 mA cm(-2)). The SnS catalyst shows outstanding catalytic activity for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions compared to carbon, noble metals, and other transition metal dichalcogenides. It also exhibits good structural integrity at high rates. The computations indicate numerous possible oxygen reduction sites without oxygen dissociations on the SnS surface through solution mechanism that is likely responsible for the formation of Li2O2. The calculations also indicate that the role of the SnI2 is not only reacting with the lithium anode to provide protection but reducing the charge potential by promoting catalytic decomposition of the Li2O2. This work provides new novel additives for designing high-rate Li-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000867406000001

Once in the diffuse gas, this material is cycled through molecular clouds before being incorporated into young stars and planetary systems during star formation. Infrared observations have confirmed the presence of carbon, SiC, hydrocarbons, and oxygen-rich silicate grains in nova ejecta, suggesting that some fraction of the pre-solar grains recently identified in meteoritic material may come from novae. The mean mass returned by a nova outburst to the ISM probably exceeds similar to 2 X 10(-4) M-circle dot. Using the observed nova rate of 35 +/- 11 per year in our Galaxy, it follows that novae introduce more than similar to 7 x 10(-3) M-circle dot yr(-1) of processed matter into the ISM. It is likely, however, that novae ejecta are more massive than believed, and this value is a lower limit. Novae are expected to be the major source of N-15 and O-17 in the Galaxy and to contribute to the abundances of other isotopes in this atomic mass range. In order to understand better their contributions to galactic chemical evolution, we have begun a series of studies with the latest nuclear reaction rate libraries. We report both on how these new rates affect the properties of the outburst and, in addition, how they change the predictions of the contributions of novae to Galactic chemical evolution.					6th International Conference on Nuclei in the Cosmos6th International Conference on Nuclei in the Cosmos	JUN 27-JUL 01, 2000JUN 27-JUL 01, 2000		UNIV AARHUS, AARHUS, DENMARKUNIV AARHUS, AARHUS, DENMARK	10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0375-9474			WOS:000168799300023

Here, we propose a gas-foaming strategy to fabricate sustainable and 3D hierarchically porous N-doped carbon with high specific surface area and abundant defects sites derived from biomass. The obtained catalyst exhibits prominent ORR property with higher half-wave potential (0.861 V) and slightly lower kinetic current density (32.44 mA cm(-2)), compared to Pt/C (0.856 V and 43.61 mA cm(-1)). Furthermore, employing it as catalyst of air cathode, the Al-air battery delivers remarkable discharge performance with excellent power density of 401 mW cm(-2), distinguished energy density of 2453.4 Wh kg(-1) and extremely high open-circuit voltage of 1.85 V among the reported metal-air batteries in the literatures. This gas-foaming strategy for full utilization of biomass affords a chance to explore scalable advanced catalysts in metal-air battery.

Oxygenic photosynthesis: EPR study of photosynthetic electron transport and oxygen-exchange, an overview								CELL BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS				77	1	SI		47	59		10.1007/s12013-018-0861-6				MAR 2019	2019	In this review, we consider the applications of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods to the study of the relationships between the electron transport and oxygen-exchange processes in photosynthetic systems of oxygenic type. One of the purposes of this article is to encourage scientists to use the advantageous EPR oximetry approaches to study oxygen-related electron transport processes in photosynthetic systems. The structural organization of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain and the EPR approaches to the measurements of molecular oxygen (O-2) with O-2-sensitive species (nitroxide spin labels and solid paramagnetic particles) are briefly reviewed. In solution, the collision of O-2 with spin probes causes the broadening of their EPR spectra and the reduction of their spin-lattice relaxation times. Based on these effects, tools for measuring O-2 concentration and O-2 diffusion in biological systems have been developed. These methods, named spin-label oximetry, include not only nitroxide spin labels, but also other stable-free radicals with narrow EPR lines, as well as particulate probes with EPR spectra sensitive to molecular oxygen (lithium phthalocyanine, coals, and India ink). Applications of EPR approaches for measuring O-2 evolution and consumption are illustrated using examples of photosynthetic systems of oxygenic type, chloroplasts in situ (green leaves), and cyanobacteria.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			1085-9195	1559-0283		WOS:000462449200005	30460441

The abundant oxygen-containing groups on GO surfaces can provide nucleation sites through electrostatic interaction with the assistance of surfactant to promote heterogeneous nucleation of MoS2 on GO surfaces. During reaction, GO was reduced to graphene (rGO) by eliminating the oxygen-containing groups. The nonwettability between MoS2 and rGO compels the growing MoS2 nanosheets to stretch out of the rGO surfaces, leading to the high-density edges. Besides, the excess surfactant can insert the interlayer of MoS2, causing the enlarged interlayer spacing. The obtained MoS2 could exhibit improved catalytic activity and the synthetic approach presented here may be extended to grow other transition metal dichalcogenide materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this method, high magnetic field was employed to tune the shell thickness. The mechanism of shell-tuning by magnetic field was discussed. The formation of Co2P hollow NPs involves two main processes: the dissolution of CoO on the surface of Co NPs, and the Kirkendall effect process. Magnetic field can reduce the particle size and tune the shell thickness by accelerating the dissolution process and slowing down the Kirkendall effect process. The effects of shell thickness on the stability of the hollow NPs were investigated. During the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process in alkaline medium, the Co2P hollow NPs with shell thicker than 3.90 nm have good structure stability and perform a good catalytic performance. Nevertheless, when shell thickness is reduced to 3.32 nm, there is a great change in the hollow structure. It will fracture into small NPs and lead to significant degradation of activity. This work develops a reasonable method to synthesize small-sized transition metal phosphides hollow particles with adjustable shell thickness, and provides a reference for balancing the activity and stability of hollow particles, which is significant to prepare hollow nanoparticles with good catalytic performance.

In this work, Mo2C-Mo3C2 heteronanowires with significantly enhanced catalytic performance are constructed from an MoAn precursor via an accurate phase transition process. The structure disordering and surface carbon shell of Mo2C-Mo3C2 heteronanowires can be precisely regulated, resulting in an enlarged surface area and a defect-rich catalytic surface. Density functional theory calculations are used to identify the effect of the defective sites and carbon shell on the free energy for hydrogen adsorption in hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect between different phases and the introduced lattice defects of Mo2C-Mo3C2 are considered to enhance the HER catalytic performance. The designed catalyst exhibits optimal electrocatalytic activity in both acidic and alkaline media: low overpotentials of 134 and 116 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1), and a long-term stability for 5000 cycles. This work will provide new insights into the design of high-efficiency HER catalysts via interfacial engineering at the nanoscale for commercial water splitting.									37	2	0	0	0	0	37			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000506883100024	31789328

In this work, in order to enhance the light harvesting ability as well as ameliorate the separation and transportation of photo-induced charges at the same time, Ni ion was adopted to modify Zn0.5Cd0.5S catalyst. The subsequent photocatalytic water splitting tests showed that the H-2 evolution rate over Ni doped Zn0.5Cd0.5S was 6 times higher than that achieved on the prestine Zno.sCdo.sS, indicating a significant enhancement in catalytic activity. Furthermore, the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol was also performed by the as-prepared catalysts under visible light irradiation. When 1% Ni ions were doped in Zno.sCclo.55 solid solution, the yield of product benzaldehyde was increased from 70% to 92%. The photoelectrochemical test suggests that the improved photocatalytic performance is presumably ascribed to the efficient separation of photo-generated carriers. Additionally, DOS calculation confirms the contribution of the improved light harvesting ability of Ni-doped Zn0.5Cd0.5S in the photocatalytic reaction. In all, this work presents that doping Ni into ZnS/CdS solid solution is a very useful technique to improve photocatalytic activity for two typical photocatalytic reactions-the H-2 evolution and alcohol selective oxidation reaction.									80	9	0	0	6	0	82			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000467661700043

However, these properties vary strongly with the IrOx form, ranging from durable crystalline IrO2 to more active but less stable amorphous, hydrous oxides. Herein we demonstrate how an operation transient during proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) can induce conversion of IrO2 in the anode catalyst layer into a more hydrous form. We operate a 5 cm(2) PEMWE cell at 80 degrees C and elevated H-2 pressure, then interrupt the power supply and observe the OCV showing a characteristic decay to eventually 0 V. We postulate that the IrO2 surface reacts with H-2 crossing over the membrane, confirm ex situ via TGA and XRD analyses that IrOx can be reduced to metallic Ir under H-2 at 80 degrees C, elaborate the related thermodynamics and match them with the electrochemical potential of the IrOx catalyst during the above transient. This is supported in situ via cyclic voltammograms and polarization curves showing improved OER activity. Moreover, we demonstrate that subsequent polarization to the OER potential range transforms the reduced catalyst surface into a more hydrous IrOx and wrap up with implications for the long-term performance and durability of PEMWE devices.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000618348400001

Here, we present for the first time, hierarchical multiroom-structured molybdenum carbide/carbon composite microspheres grafted with Ni nanoparticle-embedded N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) (i.e., mNi-NCNT-MoC-C), which are prepared by pilot-scale spray drying and subsequent surface growth of NCNT bundles. The designed mNi-NCNT-MoC-C microspheres show efficient bifunctional catalytic activities toward both oxygen reduction and evolution. In addition, the hierarchical multiroom structure of mNi-NCNT-MoC-C microspheres increases the discharge capacity by providing sufficient space to accommodate Li2O2, which forms during discharging. A Li-O-2 battery prepared using mNi-NCNT-MoC-C microspheres as an air electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performances including a long cycle life (199 cycles) and low overpotentials of 0.20 and 0.21 V for charging and discharging, respectively. The synergetic effects of efficient morphology (i.e., the multiroom structure), highly electrocatalytically active materials (i.e., NCNT, Ni, and MoC), and high electrical conductivity (imparted by the NCNTs) is responsible for the superior performance of mNi-NCNT-MoC-C microspheres as an air cathode material for Li-O-2 batteries.									20	3	1	0	2	0	21			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000444000000091

Yet, traditionally employed MOF-conversion conditions (e.g., pyrolysis) commonly involve multiple complex high-temperature reaction processes, which often make it challenging to control the composition, pore structure, and active-sites of the MOF-derived catalysts. Herein, a general, simple, room-temperature method is presented for a controlled electrochemical conversion of MOF (EC-MOF) films into porous, amorphous metal sulfides (a-MSx). Detailed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis and control over independent EC-MOF parameters (e.g., scan-rate and potential window) enable to gain insights on the MOF-conversion mechanisms, and in turn to fine-tune the porosity and composition of the obtained MSx. As a result, a highly active amorphous cobalt sulfide (a-CoSx) electrocatalyst can be designed for hydrogen evolution reaction in neutral pH. Furthermore, the adjustable nature of the EC-MOF method allows to draw conclusions about the correlation between the concentration of catalytically active species (S-2(2-) sites) and the hydrogen evolution properties of the a-CoSx. Given the method's generality and the diversity of available MOF structures, EC-MOF provides a compelling platform for a rational design of a wide variety of active electrocatalytic materials.									96	3	0	0	6	0	97			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000431614500015

Many studies thus far have been limited to ex situ characterizations or bulk film measurements, often in the absence of solvent. Here we describe an investigation of the CoPi catalyst by surface interrogation scanning electrochemical microscopy (SI-SECM). This method should allow us to selectively study surface atoms separately from the bulk in a solvent-filled environment. By SI-SECM, independent titrations of surface Co-III and CoIV were performed, yielding a direct measurement of the surface active-site density of a CoPi electrode (11 Co/nm(2)). The pseudo-first-order reaction rate constants of Co-III and CoIV with water were determined to be 0.19 and >2 s(-1), respectively, through time-dependent titration measurements.									93	3	0	0	7	0	93			0002-7863			WOS:000348483400016	25562373

Hydrogen can be generated in a more sustainable way from renewable energy sources via electrocatalytic water splitting. However, the high cost and low abundance of the benchmarking platinum-based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts hinder their widespread applications. Thus, developing highly efficient, stable, and low-cost electrocatalysts to replace platinum for HER is imperative, but remains a challenging task. Recently, efforts have been devoted to developing non-noble HER electrocatalysts, including transition metal carbides, oxides, phosphides, and sulfides. However, traditional synthetic strategies cannot effectively control active sites and the catalysts tend to aggregate under high temperature. Recently, polyoxometalates (POMs) have been applied as precursors for the preparation of non-noble HER electrocatalysts as they contain discrete metal-oxygen clusters with well-defined structures. POMs are typically composed of oxygen ligands and high-valent metal ions such as V(V), Mo(VI), and W(VI), which can serve as V, Mo, and W sources to produce the corresponding metal carbides, oxides, phosphides, and sulfides by pyrolysis at high temperature. Some POMs may also contain a series of redox-active heteroatoms, which are usually named hetero-polyoxometalates. These can serve as precursors to electrocatalysts with uniform heteroatom doping. Moreover, direct applications of POMs as molecular catalysts in HER have, in recent years, received rapidly growing attention. This is because POMs not only serve as mediators or molecular catalysts to facilitate the HER, but can also be deposited on the electrode surface to catalyze the HER. However, the interpretation that HER catalytic activity enhancement is due to the intrinsic catalytic properties of the electrodeposited polyoxometalate or the deposition of small amounts of platinum has been highly debated. Reviewing these studies may help us understand the intrinsic active sites as well the intrinsic HER mechanism of POMs and POMs-derived catalysts, and thus design more efficient HER catalysts. This review, therefore, focuses on recent progress in the applications of POMs and their derivatives in electrocatalytic HER. Firstly, basic HER mechanisms for common metal catalysts and POMs molecular catalysts are discussed along with challenges in the field of HER. Next, applications of POMs molecular catalysts and POMs-derived catalysts in HER are summarized. Finally, some perspectives of POMs-based catalysts/pre-catalysts for electrocatalytic HER are proposed.									16	2	0	0	0	0	16			1000-6818			WOS:000534784800007

Here, an interface engineering strategy is demonstrated to construct an efficient and stable catalyst based on NiS@MoS2 core-shell hierarchical microspheres for the hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). The ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets in-situ grow on the surface of NiS hierarchical micro-sized spheres constructed by porous nanoplates, endowing the composites with rich interfaces, well-exposed electroactive edges, high structural porosity and fast transport channels. These advantages are favorable for the improvement of catalytic sites and the transport of catalysis-relevant species. More importantly, the intimate contact between MoS2 nanosheets and NiS nanoplates synergistically favors the chemical sorption of hydrogen intermediates, thereby reducing the reaction barrier and accelerating the HER catalytic process. As a result, the optimized NiS@MoS2 catalyst manifests impressive HER activity and durability, with a low overpotential of 208 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 146 mV in 1.0 M KOH at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. This work not only provides an effective way to construct core-shell hierarchical microspheres but also a multiscale strategy to regulate the electronic structure of heterostructured materials for energy-related applications.

Evaluation of landfill leachate pollution and treatment								DESALINATION				220	1-3			108	114		10.1016/j.desal.2007.01.026				MAR 1 2008	2008	Leachate from municipalities' landfills represents a potential health risk to both surrounding ecosystems and human populations. This study deals with the Ouled Fayet site (west of Algiers), which has been operational for five years, receiving non-hazardous, municipal and assimilated wastes from 34 municipalities corresponding to 363,000 T/year, stored in a settler and then rejected in the receiving environment. The composition of the wastes is extremely changeable according to the nature, the deposit time, and the climatic changes.Several landfill leachate samples were taken from the entry and exit settler, and evaluated. The analysis yielded the following results; very concentrated organic matter, chemical oxygen demand (COD) = 3552 mg/L, BOD5 = 980 mg/L and BOD/COD ratio of 0.25. We observed that the water leachate is in the anaerobic reactions corresponding to the beginning of methane step, the pH of 8.27 reflects this biochemical evolution phase. Management of Algiers is undergoing drastic changes (source separation, closure of old landfills, reduction of the number etc.) that is why the municipalities are actually forced by the legislation to follow a minimization of the solid wastes by adopting a new strategy of reuse and recycling before all elimination or treatment possibility.

Herein, a nonradical oxidation process via peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation by CuO/MXene for treating high-salinity organic wastewater was developed. Rapid removal efficiency of target pollutant carbamazepine (CBZ) was significantly enhanced to 95.88% within 20 min by CuO/MXene under high salinity conditions (NaCl, 200 mM), compared to the efficiency of 4.30% exhibited by PMS alone. Besides, CBZ maintained a higher removal efficiency of > 81.04% in complex highly saline wastewater composed of eight common inorganic anions. Radical quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis confirmed that radical and nonradical oxidation processes were involved in the catalytic process. However, singlet oxygen (1O2) was identified as the primary reactive species, and its contribution rate to CBZ degradation was > 73.58% in a wide pH range (3.0-9.0). The oxygenated functional groups and the interaction between CuO/MXene and PMS facilitated the production of 1O2. The degradation pathway was proposed based on the detection of intermediates. This work provided a new inspiration for the decontamination of organic contaminants under high salinity conditions via a nonradical oxidation process.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000788663100002

For thermodynamics,the DFT calculation results showed that the energy barriers in LaMnO3, LaCoO3, and LaNiO3 were about 0.99 eV, 1.65 eV and 2.42 eV in the first process and 0.94 eV, 1.82 eV and 2.64 eV in the second process,and the barriers energy in LaMnO3 were smaller than those on the others,so it showed the best catalytic performance in N2O molecule decomposition. The O-2 molecule desorption energy were 0.5 eV, 0.3 eV and 0.19eV in LaMnO3, LaCoO3 and LaNiO3,so the low desorption energy made O-2 molecules detach from the surface easily to complete the entire reaction process. In addition,the calculation results of the kinetic reaction rate coefficient(k) also proved that LaMnO3 had extremely high kinetic activity for dynamics, and the O-2 molecules desorption reaction was not a rate-controlled process. Therefore, LaMnO3 had high catalytic activity for the N2O molecules decomposition reaction in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics, and these results increased our understanding of the mechanism of NOx decomposition on perovskites.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2468-8231			WOS:000682935700001

However, two light absorption components generally suffer from poor charge collection and cannot be efficiently utilized because of non-ideal interfaces. Herein, a triple-deck three-dimensional (3D) architecture was designed through a one-step shaping process with an additional stress relaxation WO3 underlayer. The final photoanodes showed a promising photocurrent density of 5.1 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G illumination. Using the uniformly distributed oxygen evolution co-catalyst (OEC) layer as the outer most shell of the WO3/BiVO4/OEC triple-deck 3D structure with a dense WO3 underlayer, the water splitting efficiency was improved dramatically by facilitating the charge transfer process at the electrode/electrolyte interface.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000369908900037	26797394

JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY				175	7			453	461		10.1007/s00360-005-0010-6				OCT 2005	2005	Biological functions are dependent on the temperature of the organism. Animals may respond to fluctuation in the thermal environment by regulating their body temperature and by modifying physiological and biochemical rates. Phenotypic flexibility (reversible phenotypic plasticity, acclimation, or acclimatisation) in rate functions occurs in all major taxonomic groups and may be considered as an ancestral condition. Within the Reptilia, representatives from all major groups show phenotypic flexibility in response to long-term or chronic changes in the thermal environment. Acclimation or acclimatisation in reptiles are most commonly assessed by measuring whole animal responses such as oxygen consumption, but whole animal responses are comprised of variation in individual traits such as enzyme activities, hormone expression, and cardiovascular functions. The challenge now lies in connecting the changes in the components to the functioning of the whole animal and its fitness. Experimental designs in research on reptilian thermal physiology should incorporate the capacity for reversible phenotypic plasticity as a null-hypothesis, because the significance of differential body temperature-performance relationships (thermal reaction norms) between individuals, populations, or species cannot be assessed without testing that null-hypothesis.									120	6	1	0	119	0	125			0174-1578	1432-136X		WOS:000233241600001	16034580

A better understanding of the processes that influence pyrite oxidation will help to determine the rate of acid and cation evolution from pyritic mine tailings. The oxidation process is surface-controlled and may be influenced by cadmium sorption, which forms surface precipitates and complexes that may limit pyrite oxidation. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of cadmium sorption on the rate of FeS2 oxidation by molecular oxygen. Raman spectroscopy was used to track the evolution of oxidized sulfur products, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy was used to quantify iron oxidation rates. Cadmium concentrations as low as 50 mu M depressed pyrite oxidation rates. Oxygenation of amorphous FeS2 (1 g/L) is described by a pseudo-first-order reaction with a rate constant of 6.85 x 10(-5) s(-1); FeS2 sorbed with 500 mu mol of Cd g(-1) prior to oxygenation exhibited an oxidation rate 5.15-fold lower with a rate constant of 1.33 x 10-5 s(-1). Raman and XANES data indicate that cadmium sorption influences FeS2 oxidation. In natural systems, suppression of FeS2 oxidation by Cd and other soft Lewis acids may retard the release of acidity and trace metals to the environment.									18	0	0	0	4	0	18			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000086456100019		
J	Rouault, T A; Klausner, R D								The impact of oxidative stress on eukaryotic iron metabolism.								EXS				77				183	97						1996	1996	The processes of iron uptake and distribution are highly regulated in mammalian cells. Expression of the transferrin receptor is increased when cells are iron-depleted, while expression of the iron sequestration protein ferritin is increased in cells that are iron-replete. Regulation of expression of proteins of iron uptake (transferrin receptor) and iron sequestration (ferritin) presumably ensures that levels of reactive free iron are not high in cells. Formation of reactive oxygen species occurs when free iron reacts with oxygen, and tight regulation of iron metabolism may enable cells to avoid engaging in destructive chemical reactions. Levels of intracellular iron are directly sensed by two iron sensing proteins. Iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) is a bifunctional protein; in cells that are iron-replete, IRP1 contains an iron-sulfur cluster and functions as cytosolic aconitase. In cells that are iron-depleted, IRP1 binds stem-loop structures in RNA transcripts known as iron responsive elements (IREs). Iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) binds similar stem-loop structures, but the mode of regulation of IRP2 is different in that IRP2 is rapidly degraded in iron-replete cells. The post-transcriptional regulation of genes of iron metabolism in mammalian cells ensures that cells have an adequate supply of iron, and also ensures that cells do not generate excess reactive oxygen species through the interaction of free iron and oxygen.									15	1	0	0	14	0	16			1023-294X			MEDLINE:8856975	8856975

PCC 6803 designated as chlL(-) was unable to make significant amounts of chlorophyll in darkness. However, an apparent pseudorevertant has been generated spontaneously that can synthesize an increased amount of chlorophyll under light-activated heterotrophic growth conditions. Under these conditions, the chlorophyll content in this pseudorevertant was about 20% of that in the wild-type strain and about 4 times more than that in the original and in the recently recreated chlL-deletion mutant. This is paralleled by increased performance of dark-grown cells in terms of chlorophyll fluorescence induction and oxygen evolution rates in the pseudorevertant versus in the original mutant. PCR analysis confirmed that the chlL(-) pseudorevertant mutant still lacked the chlL gene. These results imply that the light-independent chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway was partly recovered.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1521-6543	1521-6551		WOS:000171877300003	11699873

The impact of substituting Th, which has a stable oxidation state of 4 + as opposed to the stable 6+, 5+, or 4 + states of U, into UO2 on the oxidation potential of the resulting isostructural solid solution is investigated. Hydrothermally grown single crystals of UxTh1-xO2, with x = 0.1, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, or 1.0 are subjected to a damaging 532 nm laser whose power is tuned at > 3.04 mW to be simultaneously used as a driving force for oxidation and as an excitation source for mu-Raman spectroscopy. In so doing, the oxidation of UxTh1-xO2 to UxTh1-xO2+delta when x = 0.9 or 0.75 can be tracked by the evolution of a peak near 630 cm(-1), which is indicative of the formation of oxygen interstitials. Higher Th contents disable this oxidation reaction and engender increased laser damage resistance. The oxidation of UO2 to U3O8 is found to be completely inhibited by all Th contents studied.

The microstructure and electrochemical properties of the anodes were studied with SEM, EDX, XRD, potentiodynamic polarization, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and accelerated life test. It has been shown that the prepared oxide anodes have uniform surface composition, and there is no evident aggregation of IrO2 particles. Tantalum forms solid solution in the rutile IrO2 phase. With the increase of the sintering temperature, the mutual solubility between iridium and tantalum increases, and the crystallite grains of the oxide coating become finer. Moreover, with rising of the sintering temperature, the electrocatalytic activity of the oxide electrode for oxygen evolution and the electrochemically active surface area are reduced. The Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5 anode prepared at 500 degrees C presents the longest service life.									13	14	0	0	0	0	24			1002-185X			WOS:000285958900005

These cathodes will not be able to meet the increasing requirements until lithium-rich layered oxides emerge with beyond-capacity performance. Nevertheless, in-depth understanding of the evolution of crystal and excess capacity delivered by Li-rich layered oxides is insufficient. Herein, various in situ technologies such as X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy are employed for a typical material Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, directly visualizing O--O- (peroxo oxygen dimers) bonding mostly along the c-axis and demonstrating the reversible O2-/O- redox process. Additionally, the formation of the peroxo O-O bond is calculated via density functional theory, and the corresponding O-O bond length of approximate to 1.3 angstrom matches well with the in situ Raman results. These findings enrich the oxygen chemistry in layered oxides and open opportunities to design high-performance positive electrodes for lithium-ion batteries.									231	17	0	0	8	0	232			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000429410300009	29457283

However, large particles with low catalytic activity are formed easily for the transition metals during high-temperature carbonization. Herein, PAN nanofibers uniformly distributed with FeCl3 were coated with SiO2 and then carbonized to obtain Fe-N-Si tri-doped carbon nanofibers catalyst (Fe-N-Si-CNFs). The SiO2 can further anchor the Fe atoms, thus preventing agglomeration during the carbonization process. Meanwhile, Si atoms have been doped in CNFs during this process, which is conducive to the further improvement of catalytic performance. The Fe-N-Si-CNFs catalyst has a 3D network structure and a large specific surface area (809.3 m(2) g(-1)), which contributes to catalyzing the ORR. In alkaline media, Fe-N-Si-CNFs exhibits superior catalytic performance (E-1/2 = 0.86 V vs. RHE) and higher stability (9.6% activity attenuation after 20000s) than Pt/C catalyst (20 wt%).

However, it remains challenging to control morphology and structure of WO3-x nanomaterials. Here, we report the solvothermal synthesis of WO3-x nanostructures with different morphologies in tungsten hexachloride-ethanol solution through adjusting the filling fraction of ethanol in autoclave. The structural and morphological conversion mechanisms are related to the changes in the viscosity and Brownian motion caused by the concentration of tungsten hexachloride in ethanol. The studies on the photoluminescence (PL) properties reveal that the WO3-x nanostructures emit ultraviolet, blue, green and red emissions. The PL emissions are attributed to the recombination between the electron occupying the resonant defect state in the conduction band and the hole in the valence band and the transitions between the conduction and valence bands as well as the transition between the oxygen vacancy states. The enhancement of PL intensity is related to the increase of oxygen vacancies and the phonon suppression during the PL emission as well as the nanocavity structure. Furthermore, the potential applications in the catalysis fields are discussed. These results provide a new technique to control the structure of WO3-x nanomaterials and contribute to the development of next-generation PL emission nanodevices based on vacancy- and structure-engineered WO3 materials and the rational design of catalytic materials.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000620869100005

Experimental results clearly indicated that dissolved oxygen (DO), hydraulic retention time (HRT) and concentration of the model bacteria (Escherichia coliform) affected the removal efficiency. It was found that the ultimate removal efficiency was 99% at DO level of 21.34 mg/L, HRT at 60 s and high concentration of E. coli at 10(9) CFU/mL. The morphologic studies also showed that E coliform could be further mineralized into CO(2) and H(2)O. Dissolved organic carbon, pH and gas chromatograph analysis had justified most importantly the evolution Of CO(2). Experimental results revealed that the photomineralization rate of E. coliform followed pseudo-first-order kinetics by the role of DO. The derived empirical models were found consistent with the proposed reaction pathways of a combined UV breakdown on mass cell and a dual-site Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism where the rate-controlling step is the surface interaction between the adsorbed cleavage bacterial cells and hydroxyl radicals.

Currently, the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for water splitting in acidic solutions are IrO2 or RuO2 for the O-2 evolution reaction (OER) and Pt for the H-2 evolution reaction (HER). Realization of large-scale H-2 production from water splitting requires competent nonprecious electrocatalysts. Despite the advances of decades in this field, several challenges still exist and need to be overcome: (1) Most efforts in the design of nonprecious electrocatalysts have focused on developing HER catalysts for acidic conditions but OER catalysts for alkaline conditions owing to their thermodynamic convenience, potentially resulting in incompatible integration of the two types of catalysts and thus inferior overall performance. (2) In conventional water electrolysis, HER and OER are strictly coupled and therefore H-2 and O-2 are produced simultaneously, which may lead to explosive H-2/O-2 mixing due to gas crossover. Meanwhile, the coexistence of H-2,O-2, and electrocatalysts could produce reactive oxygen species that might shorten the lifetime of an electrolyzer. (3) The HER rate is often limited by that of OER due to the more sluggish kinetics of the latter, which lowers the overall energy conversion efficiency. Moreover, the product of OER, O-2, is not highly valuable. (4) It remains challenging to develop efficient and low-cost H-2 storage and transport systems for the future H-2 economy.In this Account, we describe recent progress in innovative strategies to address the aforementioned four challenges in conventional water electrolysis. These novel strategies include (1) overall water electrolysis based on bifunctional nonprecious electrocatalysts (or precursors) to drive both HER and OER under the same conditions, (2) decoupled water electrolysis achieved by redox mediators for temporally and spatially separating HER from OER, (3) hybrid water electrolysis by integrating thermodynamically more favorable organic upgrading reactions to replace OER, and (4) tandem water electrolysis by utilizing biocatalysts for converting the in situ produced H-2 with foreign compounds (e.g., CO2 and N-2) to more valuable products. Finally, the remaining challenges and future perspectives are also presented. We hope this Account will function as a momentum call for more endeavors into the development of advanced electrocatalytic systems and novel strategies for practicable H-2 production from water as well as the electrocatalytic upgrading of diverse organic compounds.									733	41	0	0	32	1	740			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000439398000001	29537825

Here, with ZIF-67-derived Co-based carbon frameworks (Co/NCs) as model catalysts, we systematically investigated the effects of different reaction parameters on the HER kinetics and discovered that the HER activity was directly dependent not on the type of nitrogen in the carbon framework but on the relative content of surface hydroxyl and water (OH-/H2O) adsorbed on Co active sites embedded in carbon frameworks. When the ratio of the OH-/H2O was close to 1:1, the Co/NC nanocatalyst showed the best reaction performance under the condition of high-pH electrolytes, e.g., an overpotential of only 232 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the 1 M KOH electrolyte. We unambiguously identified that the structural water molecules (SWs) in the form of hydrous hydroxyl complexes absorbed on metal centers {OHad center dot H2O@M+} were catalytic active sites for the enhanced HER, where M+ could be transition or alkaline metal cations. Different from the traditional hydrogen bonding of water, the hydroxyl (hydroxide) groups and water molecules in the SWs were mainly bonded together via the spatial interaction between the p orbitals of O atoms, exhibiting features of a delocalized pi-bond with a metastable state. These newly formed surface bonds or transitory states could be new weak interactions that synergistically promote both interfacial electron transfer and the activation of water (dissociation of O-H bonds) at the electrode surface, i.e., the formation of activated H adducts (H*). The capture of new surface states not only explains pH-, cation-, and transition-metal-dependent hydrogen evolution kinetics but also provides completely new insights into the understanding of other electrocatalytic reductions involving other small molecules, including CO2, CO, and N-2.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2691-3704		WOS:000820442900001	35783181

Therefore, the desorption of oxygen surface groups during the decomposition-reduction of the metal salt precursors of the fresh carbon-based catalysts can lead to surface reconstruction of the metal nanoparticles, which can significantly affect their catalytic activity. In this work, the oxidation states of Ru atoms supported on both an activated carbon thermally treated during the reduction process. The precursor to prepare these catalysts is Ru(No)(NO3)(3). The main results were obtained by using in situ x-ray absorption near-edge structure analysis of the Ru K-edge under conditions comparable to the temperature-programmed reduction experiments. The different reduction mechanism observed in each of the catalysts, of a multistep nature if oxygen surface groups are present and single-step in the case of clean graphitic surfaces, differences in both the final Ru oxidation state and the main cause of the five-times higher catalytic activity observed in the presence of the catalyst without surface oxygen groups for the NH3 decomposition reaction.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000322240600052

The complex [H2O(terpy)Mn(O)(2)Mn(terpy)OH2](NO3)(3) (terpy is 2,2':6',2 "-terpyridine), which was synthesized and structurally characterized, contains a di-mu-oxo manganese dimer and catalyzes the conversion of sodium hypochlorite to molecular oxygen. Oxygen-18 isotope labeling showed that water is the source of the oxygen atoms in the molecular oxygen evolved, and so this system is a functional model for photosynthetic water oxidation.									616	11	1	0	95	0	621			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000078959200045	10066173

We used the evolution of yeast aerobic fermentation as a model to explore how gene regulation has evolved and how this process has contributed to phenotypic evolution and adaptation. Most eukaryotes fully oxidize glucose to CO2 and H2O in mitochondria to maximize energy yield, whereas some yeasts, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its relatives, predominantly ferment glucose into ethanol even in the presence of oxygen, a phenomenon known as aerobic fermentation. We examined the genome-wide gene expression levels among 12 different yeasts and found that a group of genes involved in the mitochondrial respiration process showed the largest reduction in gene expression level during the evolution of aerobic fermentation. Our analysis revealed that the downregulation of these genes was significantly associated with massive loss of binding motifs of Cbf1p in the fermentative yeasts. Our experimental assays confirmed the binding of Cbf1p to the predicted motif and the activator role ofCbf1p. In summary, our study laid a foundation to unravel the long-time mystery about the genetic basis of evolution of aerobic fermentation, providing new insights into understanding the role of cis-regulatory changes in phenotypic evolution.									10	0	0	0	6	0	10			1759-6653			WOS:000324594100003	23650209

Considering the challenge of serious aggregation, rational synthesis of an atomic catalyst with good dispersion of atoms is paramount to the development of these catalysts. Herein, we report an enhanced confinement strategy to synthesize a catalyst comprised of atomically dispersed Fe supported on porous nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon from the novel and more cross-linkable Melamine-Glyoxal Resin. Densified isolated grid trapping, excessive melamine restricting, and nitrogen anchoring are strongly combined to ensure the final atomic-level dispersion of metal atoms. Experimental studies revealed enhanced kinetics of the obtained catalyst towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This catalytic activity originates from the highly active surface with atomically dispersed iron sites as well as the multi-level three-dimensional structure with fast mass and electron transfer. The enhanced confinement strategy endows the resin-derived atomic catalyst with a great prospect to develop for commercialization in future.

Chemical analysis and determination of room-temperature modulus of rupture (MOR) and Young's modulus, as well as a complete microstructural characterization of the as-received materials, were performed, Mechanical characterization at high temperature (1000 degrees, 1200 degrees, and 1450 degrees C) was done in terms of Young's modulus and MOR in an argon atmosphere (<1000 ppm oxygen at 1000 degrees C). Modulus-of-elasticity values ranged from 4 to 16 Cpa, and their evolution with temperature was determined by the evolution of the microstructure in the bulk of the specimens. A strong effect of aluminum-metal concentration on Young's modulus overrode other microstructural differences among the materials. MOR values ranged from 6 to 20 MPa, and their evolution with temperature was determined by the evolution of the microstructure in the bulk of the specimens at the lower testing temperatures (T less than or equal to 1200 degrees C) and by phase assemblages in the surface regions of the specimens - essentially by the presence of the dense MgO zone - at 1450 degrees C, The thickness of the dense MgO zone in the aluminum-containing materials was determined by the amount of aluminum and the MgO aggregate size.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			0002-7820			WOS:000085763900038

Identification of scalable methods for the fabrication of monolithic devices and gaining insights into their operating mode to identify solutions to improve performance and stability represent great challenges. Herein, we report on the one-step fabrication of a CoWO|ITO|3jn-a-Si|Steel| CoWS monolithic device via the simple photoinduced deposition of CoWO and CoWS as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and onto an illuminated ITO|3jn-a-Si|Steel solar cell using a singledeposition bath containing the [Co(WS4)2]2- complex. In a pH 7 phosphate buffer solution, the best device achieved a solar-to-hydrogen conversion yield of 1.9%. Evolution of the catalyst layers and that of the 3jn-a-Si light-harvesting core during the operation of the monolithic device are examined by conventional tools such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) together with a bipotentiostat measurement. We demonstrate that the device performance degrades due to the partial dissolution of the catalyst. Still, this degradation is healable by simply adding [Co(WS4)2]2- to the operating solution. However, modifications on the protecting indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) layer are shown to initiate irreversible degradation of the 3jn-a-Si light-harvesting core, resulting in a 10-fold decrease of the performances of the monolithic device.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000809999500001	35623012

Under specific hydrological and chemical conditions with high amounts of dissolved oxygen, the migration of nitrate ions in the aquifer, seems to be unaffected by any hydrological process, chemical substance or reaction. Examination of the relationship between nitrate concentration and aquifer properties shows that maximum nitrate concentration values follow the main axes of groundwater movement, while zones of increased recharge coincide with zones of diluted nitrate concentration.Profiles of the evolution of chemical parameters vs depth, show that the main process causing nitrate increase in groundwater, is the oxidation of ammonia originating from the rapid leaching of inorganic fertilizers applied to cultivated areas.

We present laboratory studies of the micro-structural evolution of an amorphous ferro-magnesian silicate, of olivine composition, following thermal annealing under vacuum.Methods. The amorphous silicate was prepared as a thin film on a diamond substrate. Annealing under vacuum was performed at temperatures ranging from 870 to 1920 K. After annealing the thin films were extracted from the substrate and analysed by transmission electron microscopy to infer their microsturctural and compositional evolution.Results. Spheroidal metallic nano-particles (2-50 nm) are found within the silicate films, which are still amorphous after annealing at 870 K and partially crystalized into forsterite for annealing up to 1020 K. We interpreted this microstructure in terms of a reduction of the initial amorphous silicate FeO component, because of the carbon-rich partial pressure in the furnace due to pumping mechanism. Annealing in a controlled oxygen-rick atmosphere confirms this interpretation.Conclusions. The observed microstructures closely resemble those of the GEMS (Glass with Embedded Metal and Sulphides) found in chondritic IDPs (Interplanetary Dust Particles). Since IDPs contain abundant carbonaceous matter, a solid-state reduction reaction may have occurred during heating in the hot inner regions of the proto-solar disc. Related to this, the presence of forsterite grains grown from the amorphous precursor material clearly demonstrates that condensation from gaseous species is not required to explain the occurrence of forsterite around young protostars an din comets. Forsterite grains in these environments can be formed directly in the solid phase by thermal annealing of amorphous ferro-magnesian silicates precursor under reducing conditions. Finally, locking iron as metallic particles within the silicates explains why astronomical silicates always appear observationally Mg-rich.									42	0	0	0	0	0	42			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000235777600001

Herein, the exfoliated black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets were coupled with BiOBr nanosheets having higher Fermi level, and thereby it constructed a novel layered BP/BiOBr nano-heterojunction with chemically bonding, larger contact interface and unique band structures. BiOBr nanosheets were self-assembled on the surface of BP nanosheets by a facile liquid-phase ultrasound combined with solvothermal method. The photocatalytic performance for tetracycline (TC) degradation, oxygen evolution and H2O2 production rate of Sol-10BP/BiOBr was 7.8, 7.0 and 2.6 times than that of pure BiOBr, respectively. The in-situ generated H2O2 and (OH)-O-center dot became the main active species of mineralization and decomposition of TC. The novel S-scheme two-dimensional BP/BiOBr nano-heterojunction for boosting spatial charge separation retained the useful holes-electrons with higher redox ability, which was very beneficial for producing more (OH)-O-center dot, H2O2 and O-2, and the photocatalytic activity was greatly improved.									226	21	0	0	43	0	228			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000514758500061	31889599

Herein, ternary Ni-Fe-V sulfides nanobundles supported on nickel foam (NiFeVS/NF) with one-dimensional structure have been fabricated as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. Firstly, a facile electrodeposition realizes homogeneous dispersion of Fe on NF (Fe/NF). Secondly, hydrothermal sulfurization with introduction of V source can obtain ternary NiFeVS/NF. SEM and TEM show that one-dimensional NiFeVS nanobundles are observed to vertically cover on NF, providing abundant active sites with rapid charge transfer. The ternary NiFeVS/NF has superior activity with overpotential to 161 mV at 10 mA cm (2) than binary NiVS/NF, NiFeS/NF and single Ni3S2/NF. The possible synergistic effect of ternary Ni-Fe-V sulfides may lead to enhanced intrinsic activity confirmed by electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. Further, ternary NiFeVS/NF has robust stability in 10 h water electrolysis with unchanged bundle-like structure.

In this work, an integrated electrode comprising of Co3Mo nanoalloys and porous CoO/Co2Mo3O8 hybrid nanosheets (Co3Mo/CoMoOx) was developed via a facile topological transformation by directly annealing of CoMoO4 under H-2 atmosphere. This topological transformation endows the resultant Co3Mo/CoMoOx heterostructures with abundant and strong coupling interfaces, which could synergistically strengthen the conductivity of the catalyst and accelerate the charge transfer kinetics. Benefiting from the unique heterostructure and synergy among the different domains, the optimized Co3Mo/CoMoOx exhibits promising HER and OER performance with overpotentials of 26 and 256 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, as-assembled Co3Mo/CoMoOx||Co3Mo/CoMoOx possesses a cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution, which is preferable to many other reported bifunctional catalysts. This work shed a light on the design of efficient integrated bifunctional electrocatalyst by synergistically coupling of CoMo-based alloys with metal oxides.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000772826700002

Isothermal potentiostatic and galvanostatic tests were performed on 220cm(2) single cells under a wide range of operating conditions in order to investigate the "cold start" behaviour. Different parameters have been investigated: the initial water contained in the membrane, the operating voltage, the cell temperature and current. An optimal wetting level of the fuel cell (FC) core for which cumulated heat generated by the electrochemical reaction is maximal, has been observed. Water management analysis from the membrane coupled with cell resistance measurement allowed to formulate a phenomenological interpretation of the overall FC performance evolution. FC starving is not only due to ice formation in the cathode layer pores, thus hindering oxygen transport. It is also due to ice formation in active reaction sites increasing the electrical resistance of the cell. Both factors dramatically reduce FC performance under load. The relative balance of each effect has been assessed. After each shutdown and start up at subfreezing temperature, a polarization curve at rated conditions was carried out to quantify the FC performance degradation. Performances reduce less than 1% per cold start at rated current density. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									43	4	0	0	0	0	47			0378-7753			WOS:000262796000011

The ease of applying mechanical strain reversibly in low dimensional materials can be exploited in optimizing their artificial photosynthetic or photocatalytic properties. In this work, strain effects on the concerted interplay of all the factors controlling the photocatalytic ability, such as suitable band edges straddling the redox potentials for CO2 reduction with the water and oxygen evolution reactions, optical absorbance and conductivity, carrier mobilities, carrier mobility ratios (i.e. hole/electron or electron/hole mobility ratio) and exciton binding energies, have been comprehensively studied on monolayer MoS2 nanosheets and calibrated, using density functional theory, to ascertain the type and magnitude of strain under which the optical absorbance and conductivity, carrier mobilities and the carrier mobility ratio are simultaneously and optimally enhanced, while the requisite redox reactivity and small exciton binding energies are retained. Additionally, the role of pH has been carefully addressed. Optical conductivity in pristine ML-MoS2 calculated in this work agrees with the experimental ones. Of all strain types studied, shear strain is found to be most effective in driving the kinetics of the light-driven reduction of CO2 with water, water reduction in the absence of CO2 [i.e. the H-2 evolution reaction (HER)] and oxidation of water [i.e., the O-2 evolution reaction (OER)] with nearly the same efficiency. The optical absorbance and conductivity are found to reach their maximum magnitude at 3% shear strain along the direction of lattice dilation. 0.5-3.5 and 0.5-6.5 ranges in pH are found to be favorable for the photo-catalytic HER and CO2 reduction with water respectively. Carrier mobility has been calculated using a more reliable and robust formulation where the carrier mobility depends not only on the carrier effective mass, deformation potential and elastic modulus along the longitudinal charge transport direction but also on these parameters along the transverse direction. Shear strain induces the maximum enhancement in carrier mobilities and the carrier mobility ratio, which facilitates the separation and migration of e(-)-h(+) pairs along opposite or transverse directions and thereby in prolonging the carrier lifetimes, i.e., lowering their recombination rates.									32	0	0	0	0	0	32			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000414073400022

In this connection, a numerical investigation on influences of intake oxygen enrichment combined with excess air ratio on combustion behavior of the rotary engine needs to be clarified. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations coupling with chemical kinetic mechanisms was performed in this study, and the numerical results had been validated with existing experimental data. The species evolution, combustion characteristics, and pollutant formation were monitored to assess the oxygen-enriched combustion of the rotary engine. Results showed that there was a significant influence of intake oxygen enrichment for improving flame development and burned volume due to the reasonable species concentration and intense turbulence intensity. Increasing oxygen enrichment led to the enhanced peak pressure and advanced corresponding position, resulted in a rapid combustion period for improving heat-release efficiency and combustion efficiency, meanwhile made a higher indicated mean effective pressure at the price of a smaller increment of nitrogen oxide formation. The substantial reductions of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbon, and soot were recorded, which is attributed to the higher-oxygen mixture with suitable lean operations. Considering combustion characteristics and emissions performance, the operation of intake oxygen volume of 30% accompanying the excess air ratio of 1.1 is the best choice for the engine used in the current study.									34	1	0	0	0	0	35			0196-8904	1879-2227		WOS:000515440100100

Functionalization with Fe(III) oxides gave the best results, leading to photoanodes capable of efficiently splitting water, with photocurrent densities up to 6 +/- 1 mA cm(-2) at 0 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight illumination. The resulting Solar To Hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies, measured in two electrodes configuration, were in the range 3.7-5%, depending on the counter electrode that was employed. Investigations on the stability showed that these photoanodes were able to sustain 120 minutes of continuous illumination with a < 10% photocurrent loss at 0 V vs. RHE. Pristine photoanodic response of the cells could be fully restored by an additional SILAR cycle, evidencing that the observed loss is due to the detachment of the more weakly surface bound catalyst.									28	2	0	0	3	0	28			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000321954200035	23820552

Herein, two novel ionic Ru(ii)-Fe(ii) complexes, [Ru(tmphen)(3)](2)[Fe(CN)(6)] and [Ru(phen)(3)][Fe(CN)(5)(NO)], where tmphen = 3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline and phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, were synthesized and characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, elemental analysis, FT-IR, and single-crystal X-ray structural analysis. By thermally decomposing the [Ru(tmphen)(3)](2)[Fe(CN)(6)] complex at 600 degrees C for 4 h, a heterostructured RuO2-Fe2O3 nanocomposite was fabricated through a facile one-pot treatment and then characterized by FT-IR, XRD, FT-Raman, UV-Vis (DRS), ICP-OES, FE-SEM, TEM, TGA/DTG, BET, and XPS analyses, which revealed the formation of highly crystalline RuO2-Fe2O3 nanoparticles with an average size of 8-12 nm. The prepared nanocomposite was an efficient heterostructured electrocatalyst for performing water-splitting redox reaction processes, including hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) in alkaline solutions. In this regard, RuO2 and Fe2O3 samples were also prepared through thermal decomposition of [Ru(tmphen)(3)](NO3)(2) and K-4[Fe(CN)(6)] precursors, respectively, as control experiments to compare their HER and OER electrocatalytic activity with that of the RuO2-Fe2O3 nanocomposite. Specifically, the RuO2-Fe2O3 nanocomposite exhibited significant electrocatalytic performance, generating 10 mA cm(-2) current density at -148 and 292 mV overpotentials, and the Tafel slope results from fitting the LSV curves to the Tafel equation were -43 and 56.08 mV dec(-1) for the HER and OER, respectively. Therefore, the heterostructured RuO2-Fe2O3 nanocomposite can be viewed as a bi-functional electrocatalyst for HER and OER because it exploits the synergistic effects of heterostructures and active sites at its interface.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000778707000001	35383818

In this study, PtCo nano-alloy electrocatalyst was prepared by liquid phase synthesis method with sodium borohydride as reducing agent, triethylamine as complexing agent, and by sequential heat-treatment. The physical properties of the catalyst were characterized by different analytical methods. We studied the effects of heat-treatment temperature, different amounts of sodium borohydride and triethylamine on electrochemical performance. The results show that heat-treatment can greatly improve the mass activity of the catalyst, and 500 degrees C is the optimal temperature for preparing the catalyst with the highest catalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction(ORR). Compared with commercial TKK-PtCo alloy catalyst under the same test system, the as-prepared catalysts exhibits advantages of more uniform particle size distribution, smaller particle size and higher electrochemical performance. In particular, the mass activity (MA) of the prepared catalyst is 133 mA/mg(pt), which is 3 times of TKK-PtCo alloy catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-324X			WOS:000621863700008		
J	Henry, RBC; Edmunds, MG; Koppen, J				Henry, Richard C/B-6117-2011				On the cosmic origins of carbon and nitrogen								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				541	2			660	674		10.1086/309471				OCT 1 2000	2000	We analyze the behavior of N/O and C/O abundance ratios as a function of metallicity as gauged by O/H in large, extant Galactic and extragalactic H II region abundance samples. We compile and compare published yields of C, N, and O for intermediate mass and massive stars and choose appropriate yield sets based on analytical chemical evolution models fitted to the abundance data. We then use these yields to compute numerical chemical evolution models that satisfactorily reproduce the observed abundance trends and thereby identify the most likely production sites for carbon and nitrogen. Our results suggest that carbon and nitrogen originate from separate production sites and are decoupled from one another. Massive stars (M > 8 M.) dominate the production of carbon, while intermediate-mass stars between 4 and 8 M., with a characteristic lag time of roughly 250 Myr following their formation, dominate nitrogen production. Carbon production is positively sensitive to metallicity through mass-loss processes in massive stars and has a pseudo-secondary character. Nitrogen production in intermediate mass stars is primary at low metallicity, but when 12 + log (O/H) > 8.3, secondary nitrogen becomes prominent, and nitrogen increases at a faster rate than oxygen-indeed, the dependence is steeper than would be formally expected for a secondary element. The observed fiat behavior of N/O versus O/H in metal-poor galaxies is explained by invoking low star formation rates that flatten the age-metallicity relation and allow N/O to rise to observed levels at low metallicities. The observed scatter and distribution of data points for N/O challenge the popular idea that observed intermittent polluting by oxygen is occurring from massive stars following star bursts. Rather. we find most points cluster at relatively low N/O values, indicating that scatter is caused by intermittent increases in nitrogen caused by local contamination by Wolf-Rayet stars or luminous blue variables. In addition, the effect of inflow of gas into galactic systems on secondary production of nitrogen from carbon may introduce some scatter into N/O ratios at high metallicities.									315	2	1	0	0	0	317			0004-637X			WOS:000089825000014

Since then, symbiotic proficiency has spread to distant genera of alpha- and beta-proteobacteria, via horizontal transfer of essential symbiotic genes and subsequent recipient genome remodeling under plant selection pressure. To tentatively replay rhizobium evolution in laboratory conditions, we previously transferred the symbiotic plasmid of the Mimosa symbiont Cupriavidus taiwanensis in the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, and selected spontaneous nodulating variants of the chimeric Ralstonia sp. using Mimosa pudica as a trap. Here, we pursued the evolution experiment by submitting two of the rhizobial drafts to serial ex planta in planta (M. pudica) passages that may mimic alternating of saprophytic and symbiotic lives of rhizobia. Phenotyping 16 cycle-evolved clones showed strong and parallel evolution of several symbiotic traits (i.e., nodulation competitiveness, intracellular infection, and bacteroid persistence). Simultaneously, plant defense reactions decreased within nodules, suggesting that the expression of symbiotic competence requires the capacity to limit plant immunity. Nitrogen fixation was not acquired in the frame of this evolutionarily short experiment, likely due to the still poor persistence of final clones within nodules compared with the reference rhizobium C. taiwanensis. Our results highlight the potential of experimental evolution in improving symbiotic proficiency and for the elucidation of relationship between symbiotic capacities and elicitation of immune responses.									28	0	0	0	26	0	28			0894-0282	1943-7706		WOS:000340735700007	25105803

Herein, hollow microspheres self-assembled by a layer of interweaving Fe2O3 nanorods are first fabricated by a one-step hydrothermal process, which are then covered by dopamine. Finally, annealing treatment at the assigned temperature in N-2 is conducted to synthesize Fe/FexOy nanorod-based hollow microspheres (similar to 900 nm in diameter) covered by N-doped carbon. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that, by the side of the commercial 20% Pt/C, the as-obtained T-650 has a higher onset potential (83-mV positive shift), more positive half wave potential (55-mV positive shift), and larger limiting current density (increased by 0.9 mA cm(-2)). It is found that the simultaneous presence of zero-valence Fe and nitrogen atoms is the key to the high catalytic activity of the as-synthesized Fe-N-C material, and these unique hierarchical hollow porous microspheres make the electrocatalyst possess excellent catalytic performance, long-time stability, and superior methanol tolerance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000716250300004

Herein, the outstanding hydrogen evolution performance of a nonprecious material based electro-catalyst obtained through the pyrolysis of bilayer thin films of metal-organic framework and graphitic carbon nitride supported on a 3D Ni foam is demonstrated. The obtained electrocatalyst exhibits a pyramid structure composed of nickel and carbon, coupled with nitrogen doped carbon nanosheets on the outer layer. It requires a negligible overpotential (approximate to 0 mV) to initiate hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. The overpotentials needed to deliver current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) are 8 and 28 mV, respectively. Moreover, the as-prepared electrode also exhibits prominent stability in prolonged constant potential electrolysis of water. Density functional theory calculations reveal the active sites originated from the combination of nitrogen doped carbon nanosheets (N-C) and the encapsulated Ni nanoparticles. Furthermore, the obtained hydrogen electrode is one of the most active catalysts toward HER, even comparable with the benchmarking platinum carbon catalyst. It has the potential to be fabricated and employed as the working electrode for large-scale electrolytic generation of hydrogen from water.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2366-7486			WOS:000424593300003

However, the efficiency of such a system is limited by the conventional noble metal catalysts. Herein, using first-principle calculations, we demonstrate the potential of non-precious Co- and N-codoped graphene systems (CoNx-N/O-gra, x = 1-4) in efficiently catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The findings showed that the activity of the Co sites was influenced by the concentration and configuration of N dopants, as well as the coordination environment of Co atom. From the volcano curve, obtained by plotting the exchange current as a function of the adsorption free energy, optimal performance was achieved on CoN4-gra, which was attributed to the moderate adsorption of CoN4-gra towards H. The electronic structures analyses confirmed that the hybridization between Co sp orbital and H s orbital played key role in tuning the interactions between the catalysts and H, which could be regulated by the coordination environment of Co. The present findings highlight the potential of non precious metal/non-metal-codoped graphene as HER catalysts and offers an effective approach to tune the HER activity by modifying the coordination environment of the metal atoms.

The incorporation of an oxygen evolving catalyst (OEC) on the WO3 surface can improve the kinetics for water oxidation and increase the branching ratio for O-2 production. Ir-based OECs were attached to WO3 photoanodes by a variety of methods including sintering from metal salts, sputtering, drop-casting of particles, and electrodeposition to analyze how attachment strategies can affect photoelectrochemical oxygen production at WO3 photoanodes in 1 M H2SO4. High surface coverage of catalyst on the semiconductor was necessary to ensure that most minority-carrier holes contributed to water oxidation through an active catalyst site rather than a side-reaction through the WO3/electrolyte interface. Sputtering of IrO2 layers on WO3 did not detrimentally affect the energy-conversion behavior of the photoanode and improved the O-2 yield at 1.2 V vs. RHE from similar to 0% for bare WO3 to 50-70% for a thin, optically transparent catalyst layer to nearly 100% for thick, opaque catalyst layers. Measurements with a fast one-electron redox couple indicated ohmic behavior at the IrO2/WO3 junction, which provided a shunt pathway for electrocatalytic IrO2 behavior with the WO3 photoanode under reverse bias. Although other OECs were tested, only IrO2 displayed extended stability under the anodic operating conditions in acid as determined by XPS.									82	3	0	0	6	0	83			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000330779700032	24435160

In the initial thermal reaction, the coordination of a water molecule is followed by cleavage of an O-H bond and aromatization of the PNN ligand to form (PNN)RuH(CO)(OH) (3'), the most stable complex in the reaction. This low-barrier step is followed by the rate-determining dearomatization and formation of H-2. Next, a second water molecule is activated, resulting in the formation of the cis-dihydroxo complex (PNN)Ru(CO)(OH)(2) (7), which photolytically eliminates H2O2. Time-dependent DFT calculations predict that the breaking of the two strong Ru-O bonds and the formation of the O-O bond in this photolytic reaction involve low-energy triplet states and singlet-triplet crossings. Rather than regeneration of initial complex 1 after the light-induced H2O2 evolution in the catalytic cycle, the DFT calculations predict a new route with a lower energy barrier via the regeneration of 1', an isomer of 1 with the unsaturated carbon at the nitrogen side arm of the PNN ligand. This new route involves hydride transfer from the methylene group at the nitrogen side, rather than the previously proposed regeneration of 1 through hydride transfer from the phosphorus side arm of the PNN ligand.									121	1	0	0	11	0	121			0002-7863			WOS:000275084400042	19957936

In order to get more outstanding catalysts for both HER and MOR, we combined well-defined PtNi concave nanocubes (CNCs) bounded by high-index facets (HIFs) with Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets via a facile hydrothermal process and successfully obtained hybrid PtNi/Ni(OH)(2)-x, where x means the initial mass of Ni(OH)(2) in the synthesis. Remarkably, after the combination, the smooth surfaces of as-prepared PtNi CNCs were transmuted into rough ones made up of PtNi nanospheres (5-7 nm), with Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets serving as the substrate. Therefore, benefiting from the merging step, the open-framework structure with more active sites exposed was formed. Besides, the unique synergistic effect and electronic effect inside PtNi alloy and between PtNi to Ni(OH)(2), as well as the appropriate mass ratio of the two components make PtNi/Ni(OH)(2)-4.0 an excellent electrocatalyst with enhanced activity and promoted stability for both HER and MOR, which is superior to that of commercial Pt black and PtNi CNCs enclosed by HIFs. We believe that this work may potentially be applied in effective electrocatalyst construction and energy conversion.

Herein, we report a novel strategy to achieve highly exposed and atomically isolated Co-N-4 active sites within porous carbon polyhedron with bumpy exterior by pyrolysis of predesigned Zn-modified metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) together with tripolycyanmide, during which Zn is evaporated away at high temperature of 900 & DEG;C and leaves free vacancies for N to stabilize Co atoms. The bumpy exterior dramatically enlarges its specific surface area and improves the number of active sites. The local structure of single Co atoms coordinated with N is confirmed by combing spherical aberration correction electron microscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure analyses. Remarkably, the obtained Co-N-4 single sites exhibit a high ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.861 V that is superior to commercial Pt/C (0.819 V), as well as excellent performance and stability in Zn-air batteries with a peak power density of 260 mW cm(-2). Our work will endow the opportunities to propagate this approach to develop various single-metal-atom materials.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000772755700003

It is known that designed metal-based electrocatalysts applied in WORs afford high oxidation states to accelerate the electron transfer (ET), so that the rate-determining step (RDS) of the reaction is controlled by the proton transfer (PT) step of a commonly accepted concerted proton-electron transfer pathway. An alternative idea is installing an organic super-base in the closest position to the catalyst nerve center to capture protons at the end of each catalytic loop. In this work, the mentioned repeatable cycle is operated through a guanidine (present in arginine) proton relay (GPR) with a low-energy-barrier hydrogen bonding characteristic, as was confirmed by proton inventory isotopic studies and Gerischer impedance from a semi-infinite transmission line. Direct experimental evidence was provided by kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), proton inventory, pH-dependency on the RHE scale, atom proton transfer, Tafel slope, and Gerischer impedance behavior. The obtained Gerischer impedance indicates a sinking process and efficient proton shuttling, in which a chemical-electrochemical-chemical (CEC)-type mechanism controls the overall WOR. This evidence specifies that the rate of the proton exchange reaction on guanidine sites is extremely larger than the natural transport rate in the polymer/electrolyte interface. The results of experimental studies unveil a PT-accelerated non-concerted mechanism with the first ET-step as the RDS of WORs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000616679700037

Here, we explore a new class of metal organic framework (MOF) composite (NiMo polyhedron) as an active electrocatalyst material for HER application - synthesized through the conventional hydrothermal process. The bimetallic MOF system having grown on Nickel foam (NiMo/NiMoO4@NC/NF) delivers higher catalytic activity by achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 80 mV, with a Tafel slope of 98.9 mV dec(-1) (0.5M H2SO4), comparing favorably with the electrochemical enactment of existing bimetallic MOF-based catalysts. The enhanced HER activity of the synthesized MOF, is primarily due to the structural merits of MOF and the synergy between the MOF and the guest species (Ni and Mo metal atoms). Adding to the excellent HER performance, the electrode also exhibits good stability in acidic medium for a prolonged duration of 24 h. Hence, the synthesized low-cost, non-Pt electrode MOFs with its greater HER performance can be an auspicious applicant as an HER catalyst for water splitting and hydrogen generation applications.									31	1	0	0	3	0	31			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000461150400108

There are three distinct families of heme-copper oxygen reductases: A, B, and C types. The A- and B-type oxygen reductases have an active-site tyrosine that forms a unique cross-linked histidine-tyrosine cofactor. In the C-type oxygen reductases (also called cbb(3) oxidases), an analogous active-site tyrosine has recently been predicted by molecular modeling to be located within a different transmembrane helix in comparison to the A- and B-type oxygen reductases. In this work, Fourier-transform mass spectrometry is used to show that the predicted tyrosine forms a histidine-tyrosine cross-linked cofactor in the active site of the C-type oxygen reductases. This is the first known example of the evolutionary migration of a post-translationally modified active-site residue. It also verifies the presence of a unique cofactor in all three families of proton-pumping respiratory oxidases, demonstrating that these enzymes likely share a common reaction mechanism and that the histidine-tyrosine cofactor may be a required component for proton pumping.									53	1	0	0	46	0	56			0006-2960			WOS:000242935600028	17176062

In the case of atomic scale structures, amorphous and atomic-scale roughed surface structure of RuO2 and TiO2 shows high catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction. On the other hand, in the case of nano-scale structures, the anodic porous TiO2 films controlled their crystallinity and pore size can be used as new applications such as flexible dye sensitized solar cells and size selective photocatalysts. The porous Al2O3 films can be used as a template for formation of highly durable platelet carbon nanofiber supports of cathode electrode for fuel cells.

However, the successful design and synthesis of earth-abundant and efficient catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remain a significant challenge. This work presents cost-effective and straightforward ways to improve the OER activity under alkaline conditions by activating the catalyst-support and reactant-support interaction. Micro/nano-sized fibrous poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) was synthesized via simple and scalable electrospinning and subsequently coated with Cu by electroless deposition to obtain the electrocatalyst with a large specific surface area, enhanced mass transport, and high catalyst utilization. Scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction confirmed the successful synthesis of the series of Cu/PVdFHFP fibrous catalysts with varied ferroelectric polarizability of the PVdF-HFP support in the order of stretch-anneal > anneal > stretch > without pre-treatment of the catalyst. The best OER activity was confirmed for the Cu/PVdF-HFP catalyst with stretch and annealed treatment among the catalysts tested, suggesting that both the reaction kinetics and energetics of stretch-annealed Cu/PVdF-HFP catalysts were optimal for the OER. The electron delocalization between Cu and PVdF-HFP substrates (electron transfer from Cu to the negatively charged (delta(-)(eff)) PVdF-HFP region at the Cu|PVdF-HFP interface) and the enhanced transport of reactive hydroxide species and/or the increase in the local pH by positively charged (delta(+)(eff)) PVdF-HFP region concertedly accelerate the OER activity. The overall activity for the prototype water electrolyzer increased 10-fold with stretch-anneal treatment compared to the one without pre-treatment, highlighting the effect of tuning the catalyst-support and reactant-support interaction on improving the efficiency of the water electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1343			WOS:000783983200012	35382293

Water is the most frequent actor in the chemistry of metabolism. Our quantitation here reveals that water accounts for 99.4% of metabolites in Escherichia coli by molar concentration. Between a third and a half of known biochemical reactions involve consumption or production of water. We calculated the chemical flux of water and observed that in the life of a cell, a given water molecule frequently and repeatedly serves as a reaction substrate, intermediate, cofactor, and product. Our results show that as an E. coli cell replicates in the presence of molecular oxygen, an average in vivo water molecule is chemically transformed or is mechanistically involved in catalysis similar to 3.7 times. We conclude that, for biological water, there is no distinction between medium and chemical participant. Chemical transformations of water provide a basis for understanding not only extant biochemistry, but the origins of life. Because the chemistry of water dominates metabolism and also drives biological synthesis and degradation, it seems likely that metabolism co-evolved with biopolymers, which helps to reconcile polymer-first versus metabolism-first theories for the origins of life.									15	0	0	0	7	0	15			0022-2844	1432-1432		WOS:000607017600001	33427903

Straight-Parallel Electrodes and Variable Gap for Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution Reactions								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY				2019						5392452	10.1155/2019/5392452				AUG 1 2019	2019	The challenges to be overtaken with alkaline water electrolysis are the reduction of energy consumption, the maintenance, and the cost as well as the increase of durability, reliability, and safety. Having these challenges in mind, this work focused on the reduction of the electrical resistance of the electrolyte which directly affects energy consumption. According to the definition of electrical resistance of an object, the reduction of the space between electrodes could lower the electrical resistance but, in this process, the formation of bubbles could modify this affirmation. In this work, the performance analyses of nine different spaces between stainless steel 316L electrodes were carried out, although the spaces proposed are not the same as those from the positive electrode (anode) to the separator and from the separator to the negative electrode (cathode). The reason why this is studied is that stoichiometry of the reaction states that two moles of hydrogen and one mole of oxygen can be obtained per every two moles of water. The proposed spaces were 10.65, 9.20, 8.25, 7.25, 6.30, 6.05, 4.35, 4.15, and 3.40 millimetres. From the nine different analysed distances between electrodes, it can be said that the best performance was reached by one of the smallest distances proposed, 4.15mm. When the same distance between electrodes was compared (the same and different distance between electrodes and separator), the one that had almost twice the distance (negative compartment) presented an increase in current density of approximately 33% with respect to that where both distances (from electrodes to separator) are the same. That indicates that the stichometry of the electrolysis reaction influenced the performance.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2090-3529	2090-3537		WOS:000482067300001

Here a dramatically reduced charge overpotential (0.4 V) via a rational design of cathode architecture, which features highly uniform Pt and Pt3Co nanocrystals embedding within nitrogen-doped cobalt@graphene heterostructures is successfully achieved. Because of the improvement in the catalytic efficiency for optimizing the electrical and dynamic properties, the cathode design enables promising electrochemical performance. More importantly, the results reveal different overpotentials prompted by different structural evolution of bulk Li2O2, which largely depends on the Pt modification approach (surface-coating and bulk-doping). This dependence is found to be attributed to the influence of Pt nanocomponents and their dispersion on the formation and decomposition mechanism of Li2O2. Density functional theory calculations provide mechanistic insights into the promotional effect of Pt and Pt3Co on the reduction of the charge overpotential. Finally, an inner relationship between overpotential and electrochemical kinetics is proposed.									25	0	0	0	1	0	24			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000477779600010

Here we report the microscopic origin of the unidirec-tional charge separation, fully considering electron-hole interac-tion, electronic coupling of the pigments, and electrostatic interaction with the polarizable entire protein environments. The electronic coupling between the pair of bacteriochlorophylls is large in PbRC, forming a delocalized excited state with the lowest excitation energy (i.e., the special pair). The charge-separated state in the active branch is stabilized by uncharged polar residues in the transmembrane region and charged residues on the cyto-chrome c(2) binding surface. In contrast, the accessory chlorophyll in the D1 protein (Chl(D1)) has the lowest excitation energy in PSII. The charge-separated state involves Chl(D1)(center dot+) and is stabilized predom-inantly by charged residues near the Mn4CaO5 cluster and the pro-ceeding proton-transfer pathway. It seems likely that the acquirement of water-splitting ability makes Chl(D1) the initial elec-tron donor in PSII.									21	0	0	0	9	0	21			0027-8424			WOS:000553289400013	32601233

A typical bituminous Shenhua from northwest China was employed for demineralization in this research. The demineralized coal without catalytic interference of alkali metal salts was employed as the experimental sample. Moreover, by means of the utilization of isothermal combustion test, Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) and Raman spectrometer, the conversion ratio of nitrogen content in char to NO, as well as the evolution of char surface behavior and micro-structure in the process of O-2/H2O combustion under different conditions were determined. With the increase of reaction temperature (T-r) and O-2 concentration, more surface active sites (C-f), oxygen containing functional groups (C(O)) and small aromatic ring structures generated on char particle surface inhibiting the emission of NO during O-2/H2O combustion process. Under identical reaction conditions (Tr, O-2 and H2O concentration), the partially oxidized chars with moderate burnout degree (X-c approximate to 0.3) had the largest amount of C-f on particle surface. On the other hand, the amount of C-f and small aromatic ring structures first increased and then decreased as the H2O concentration enhanced. When the C-f amount and the value of I(Gr+VL+Vr)/I-D reached the maximum at the H2O concentration of approximately 8.5 vol%, the conversion ratio of char-N to NO reached the minimum value. Meanwhile, the increase of H2O concentration initially accelerated the NO reduction rate and this positive effects gradually diminished when the H2O concentration exceeded the critical value (8.5 vol%). Thus, the optimal combustion condition for char combustion with the lowest NO conversion ratio in this study was: 1473 K, 30% O-2 and 8.5 vol% H2O.									9	2	0	0	0	0	9			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000471841600139

The electrolyte contained sodium hypophosphite as the P source, enabling the incorporation of 6-14 at.% P. For comparative purposes, continuous films have been obtained galvanostatically on unpatterned Au surfaces. In both cases, the P content could be varied to a certain extent by adjusting the deposition potential or current density. Tunable microstructure and magnetic response was observed due to the dissimilar chemical composition, with coercivity values being larger in the macroporous films. Additionally, wettability analyses showed that these were more hydrophobic, reaching contact angle values of about 130 degrees. In spite of their hydrophobic character, the samples were catalytic toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. The macroporous Fe-P films showed faster kinetics for OER than their nonporous counterparts. Our results show that electrodeposited porous Fe-P based materials show an interesting combination of properties which make them appealing for applications including water cleaning, soft-magnetic components, or electrocatalytic production of oxygen, to name a few.

However, the sluggish water dissociation kinetics in neutral media severely limits the practical deployment of this technology. Herein, we present a simple strategy to rationally design oxophilic and nucleophilic moieties through the in situ reconstruction of a free-standing bimetallic cobalt-iron phosphate electrode. Through an electrochemical reduction step, the electrode surface undergoes self-reconstruction to generate a thin (oxy)hydroxide layer, enabling a significantly improved HER activity in both buffered electrolyte and natural seawater. Our mechanistic investigations reveal the essential role of oxophilic (oxy)hydroxide species in improving the HER activity of nucleophilic bimetallic phosphate sites. In a buffer electrolyte (pH = 7), the resultant electrocatalyst only requires overpotentials of 97 and 198 mV to deliver a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, which outperforms that of the Pt benchmark. The in situ reconstruction strategy of active sites within such electrodes brings significant opportunity in developing active electrocatalysts that are capable of direct seawater splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000752872400002	34730334

However, for applications where O-2 is not available (e.g., space and underwater), the gas has been replaced by H2O2 as a liquid oxidant. This work presents a study of various ceramic disc electrodes with K2NiO4 structure and nominal compositions La2NiO4, La2CuO4, La1.9Pr0.1CuO4, La1.9Sr0.1CuO4, La1.8Ce0.2NiO4, La1.9Pr0.1NiO4, La1.8Pr0.2NiO4 and La1.9Sr0.1NiO4 to assess their stability and activity for the hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (HPRR) in alkaline media. Stability tests conducted in 2 M NaOH show that Ni and Cu are readily dissolved, as occurs for substituting elements such as Sr, in agreement with calculated Pourbaix diagrams. Such degradation affects the surface of the materials, which is depleted of transition metals. This has consequences for the ORR and HPRR activity due to formation of a La-rich passivation layer on the surface. Only La2CuO4 and La1.8Ce0.2NiO4 display HPRR activity at around -0.25 V vs. RHE. An attempt is made to correlate the composition, chemical stability and electrochemical behaviour of these materials based on known molecular-orbital models proposed for the oxygen reduction reaction.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000439286000018	29972185

Measurements were carried out at beam energies: E(gamma) = 9.51, 9.61, 9.72, 10.00, 10.54, 10.84 and 11.14 MeV. We have begun the process of extracting complete angular distributions for the (12)C(alpha, gamma)(16)O reaction using energy bins of approximately 90 keV in order to determine the values of S(E1), S(E2) and the mixing phase phi(12). The rate of carbon formation at high temperatures (T > 3 GK) may increase due to contributions from higher lying states. We searched for such contributions including a contribution from the predicted higher lying second 2(+) state of (12)C. No significant contributions from higher lying states including the known 1(-) state at 10.84 MeV were found and specifically no evidence was found for the predicted second 2(+) state of (12)C.					4th International Conference on Nuclear Physics in Astrophysics4th International Conference on Nuclear Physics in Astrophysics	JUN 08-12, 2009JUN 08-12, 2009		Lab Nazl Frascati, Frascati, ITALYLab Nazl Frascati, Frascati, ITALY	4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1742-6588		*****************	WOS:000287821100016

The model dynamically resolves both Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) thin film and solution phase mechanisms together with the transport of O-2, Li+ and LiO2 in the electrolyte. It is supported on an extension to three dimensions of our Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) Electrochemical Variable Step Size Method (E-VSSM) recently published by our group in [M. A. Quiroga and A. A. Franco, J. Electrochem. Soc., 162, E73 (2015)]. The model allows predicting porosity evolution as a function of multiple operational, physical and geometrical parameters including the pore size and inlet/ outlet channel size, O-2 and Li+ concentration, the property of the solvent as well as the applied overpotential. The investigation of the impact of these different aspects reveals that at the mesoscale level, the overall ORR kinetics and the discharge mechanism strongly depend on a balance between the geometrical features of the pore and the transport as well as the electrochemical properties of the system.

The CuO proportion has been optimized to obtain densified electrodes with a mild thermal cycle (T-max = 1200 degrees C). One of the manufactured electrodes (97.8 mol.% of SnO2, 1.0 mol.% of Sb2O3, and 1.2 mol.% of CuO) was selected for electrochemical characterization from a physical and morphological analysis. The electrochemical behavior of the selected electrode showed that the addition of CuO as sintering aid widens the electrochemical window and increases the electrode "inactivity", with respect to an (Sn, Sb)O-2 electrode synthesized in the same conditions. In return, the (Sn,Sb,Cu)O-2 electrode presents a significantly lower electrochemical rugosity factor. Moreover, the addition of CuO does not change the oxygen evolution reaction mechanism, but it modifies the kinetic parameters, leading to a larger accumulation of hydroxyl radicals. Consequently, the addition of CuO as sintering aid significantly improves the electrochemical properties of the electrode as an electrochemical advanced oxidation process anode with respect to the (Sn,Sb)O-2 electrode, at the expense of worsening its electrochemical roughness factor. The results of the electrochemical characterization were confirmed by Norfloxacin degradation tests.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			1546-542X	1744-7402		WOS:000463236200040

Here we present an atomic-scale study of CO oxidation on a model Rh/Fe3O4(001) "single-atom" catalyst, which has a very different evolution depending on which of the two reactants, O-2 or CO, is adsorbed first. Using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) combined with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we show that O-2 destabilizes Rh atoms, leading to the formation of RhxOy clusters; these catalyze CO oxidation via a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism at temperatures as low as 200 K. If CO adsorbs first, the system is poisoned for direct interaction with O-2, and CO oxidation is dominated by a Mars-van-Krevelen pathway at 480 K.									14	0	0	0	1	0	13			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000520487300010	32103229

In this respect, a key strategy is the electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) reaction, which is typically paired with the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with sluggish kinetics, producing O-2 with little value. Here we prepared an oxide-derived Ag (OD-Ag) electrode with high activity and up to 98.2% selectivity for the ECH of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) to 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF), and such efficient conversion was achieved in a three-electrode flow cell. The excellent BHMF selectivity was maintained over a broad potential range with long-term operational stability. We then considered the oxidation of HMF to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and hydrogen (to water) as more efficient and productive alternatives to the OER. In HMF-to-BHMF paired with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl (TEMPO)-mediated HMF-to-FDCA conversion, a markedly reduced cell voltage from similar to 7.5 V to similar to 2.0 V was observed by transferring the electrolysis from the H-type cell to the flow cell, corresponding to more than four-fold increase in energy efficiency in operation at 10 mA. A combined faradaic efficiency of 163% was obtained for BHMF and FDCA. Alternatively, the anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction on platinum further reduced the cell voltage to only similar to 0.85 V at 10 mA. These paired processes show the potential for integration of renewable electricity and carbon for green and economically feasible distributed chemical manufacturing.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000653851500001

In respect of this challenge, we have synthesized high-quality platinum nanoparticles loaded nitrogen-doped graphene (Pt/NG) by using formic acid as reduction agent and commercial available nitrogen-doped graphene (N-graphene) as supporting materials. The morphology and component characterization demonstrate that high-loading Pt nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 2.5 nm were uniformly dispersed on nitrogen-doped graphene. The resulting Pt/NG exhibit higher catalytic activity toward methanol oxidation and hydrogen evolution reaction compared with commercial Pt/C or self-synthesized platinum nanoparticles-loaded graphene. The superior catalytic performance of Pt/NG are discussed, and ascribed to the well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles and abundant edge plane sites on N-graphene. The resultant Pt/NG with high catalytic properties and cost-effective may emerge as a promising high-performance catalyst for fuel cells.

From an environmental sustainability viewpoint, BDD electrodes are comprised only of earth abundant elements (carbon, boron, oxygen). However, a major drawback is the high manufacturing costs per unit surface area for BDD electrodes when fabricated using chemical vapor deposition or comparable surface deposition processes. BDD nanoparticles can provide an alternative manufacturing process that reduces costs by over 1000-fold while also improving catalytic activity. Herein, we demonstrate that nano-BDD electrodes can be fabricated by depositing BDD nanoparticles on a silicon substrate using a Nafion (R) ink-casting method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to investigate the electrode structural and morphological properties, which were compared to BDD electrodes manufactured using standard methods. Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed similar electrochemical properties for both electrodes, with a broad "electrochemical window", essential for effective production of center dot OH radicals without oxygen generation, providing an energy-efficient approach to degradation of pollutants in water. The electrocatalytic properties of the nano-BDD enabled electrodes were investigated using a [Fe (CN)(6)](3-/4-) redox probe. The sensing properties of as-prepared nano-BDD electrodes was studied using Dopamine.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000767881100017

The efficient cocatalysts (Ni-, Fe-, and Co-based) have been developed to promote the electron-hole separation and transportation but still have limited success in some cases. Herein, we studied the Ar plasma-induced etching strategy on the pristine Ta3N5 nanotubes and Co(OH)(x)-decorated Ta3N5 nanotubes. The Ar plasma can not only destroy the recombination center (TaO) in the interface between the Ta3N5 and electrolyte, resulting in a fast charge transfer, but also most importantly generate more oxygen vacancies with a high ratio of Co2+/Co3+ and produce a higher surface area in the Co(OH)(x) cocatalyst. The more active sites on Ta3N5 and abundant oxygen vacancies on cocatalyst synergetically contribute to the enhanced solar water splitting activity, which give rise to a fast water oxidation reaction in the interface. The resulting photoanode shows double the performance improvement under AM 1.5G sunlight conditions. Interface-defect engineering is proven to be an efficient and facile strategy to enhance the solar water oxidation activity of Ta3N5, which highlights the advantages of the plasma-etching strategy for establishing the highly active cocatalysts on photoanodes in terms of the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy.									41	1	0	0	2	0	40			2155-5435			WOS:000449723900070

The results of physical characterization revealed that PMoV molecules were incorporated into the Ag@Pt/MWCNTs structure. The effect of the composite catalyst on oxygen reduction was studied by electrochemical analysis. The catalytic performance of the composite catalyst changed with the change of the number of the substituted vanadium atoms in the heteropolyacid. The PMo10V2 catalyst shows the best activity and stability among the three heteropolyacid-modified catalysts evaluated. When the optimum doping ratio is 20%, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the composite catalyst is 99.69 m(2)/g(Pt), and it is increased by 49.11% compared with commercial Pt/C catalysts (65.63 m(2)/g(Pt)). The initial reduction potential of the composite catalyst is 0.968 V, which is shifted by 73 mV compared with the 20% Pt/C catalyst. Additionally, the mechanism of catalytic reaction is also investigated.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000493660500005

Iron oxide is widely used as electrode materials and electrocatalysts because of its abundant resource, low cost, and superior electrical and catalytic properties. Doping sulfur in iron oxide is an effective method to improve electrochemical and photocatalytic performance. The common synthesis method of sulfur-doped iron oxide is a three-step method of co-precipitation, hydrothermal, and calcination. This method has to be performed under high pressure and high temperature, so it needs to consume more energy. In this work, the electrochemical synthesis of sulfur-doped iron oxide was investigated under atmospheric pressure and temperature in the aqueous ferrous sulfate solution that was used as the precursors of sulfur, iron and oxygen. The influences of solution pH on the electrochemical synthesis process and the composition and morphology of deposits were investigated by the analyses of electrochemical reaction and SEM-EDS of deposits. It was found that the oxygen content in the deposit decreased as the pH value of the solution increased. There were three electrochemical reduction processes in sequence from positive to negative potential, followed by the underpotential deposition of iron on the platinum electrode, hydrogen evolution and sulfur doping. The sheet sulfur-doped iron oxide was successfully prepared by electrodeposition under a potential more negative than -1.70 V vs MSE. The kinetics of the electrochemical reaction of iron ions on the platinum electrode was investigated. The reduction process was a quasi-reversible process controlled by diffusion. The heterogeneous charge transfer rate constant k(s) and the diffusion coefficient D were obtained.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000754345500002

Thermal decomposition at single temperature of 500 degrees C for each layer (conventional method) was adopted as the standard procedure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) show the standard procedure leads to compact oxide coatings, with large grain distributing on coatings and high resistance of obtained electrodes. Both applying the lower temperatures in first three under-layers (step-method) and the programming heating in each layer can, to some extent, overcome the disadvantages of the conventional procedure, and thereby improve the electrochemical activities of electrodes. By using the modified procedures, the electrode resistance is found to decrease due to the inhibition of substrate oxidation. When using the controlled programming calcination (heating rate), the coating becomes more porous and rugged.									3	2	0	0	0	0	4			1000-6818			WOS:000240322200020

Herein, a facile hydrothermal and then selenization strategy is proposed to synthesize hierarchical nickel sulfoselenide (NiS2(1-x)Se2x) hollow/porous spheres with controllable composition for electrocatalytic water splitting in neutral media. By regulating the degree of selenization, the Se/S atomic ratio in the nickel sulfoselenides can be controlled to realize the tunable electronic structure of nickel to boost its intrinsic activity. Benefiting from their unique structural features and the anion doping effect, nickel sulfoselenides, especially with the chemical composition Ni(S0.5Se0.5)(2), are discovered to exhibit high activity and stability toward both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions under neutral conditions. When using Ni(S0.5Se0.5)(2) as a bifunctional electrode as both the anode and cathode in a neutral electrolyte, it demonstrates a durable activity for overall water splitting to drive 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of merely 1.87 V, outperforming the noble metal-based Pt/C and IrO2 couple. This study not only offers a new type of promising earth-abundant electrocatalyst towards water electrolysis under benign conditions, but also highlights that anion doping engineering or composition control can be an elegant strategy to improve the electrochemical catalytic performance.									42	3	0	0	0	0	44			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000476599900017

Constructing catalysts with a special morphological and electronic structure is still an effective strategy to further enhance their electrocatalytic performances. Herein, we report a facile, versatile, and scalable method to grow S-incorporated CoNiFe(oxy)hydroxides (CoNiFeS-OH) nanosheets on needle-like CoNi(oxy)hydroxides (CoNi-OH) nanoarrays under hydrothermal conditions. The special morphology provided more active sites and facilitated mass transfer. In particular, Fe and S incorporation modified the electronic structure of CoNi-OH, boosts its electronic conductivity, provided metals in high valent states, and created a crystalline/amorphous phase interface, thus intrinsically improving the electrocatalytic performance toward OER, UOR, and even overall water splitting/urea electrolysis. The CoNiFeS-OH nanosheets therefore showed superior OER activity with a low overpotential of 192 and 272 mV to reach a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. For UOR, the potential was measured to be as low as 1.329 and 1.373 V at a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, a quite low cell voltages of 1.571 and 1.461 V for overall water splitting and overall urea electrolysis were respectively detected to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which were superior to the benchmark Pt/C//RuO2 and other reported Ni, Co-based (oxy)hydroxides. More importantly, the voltage differences required for overall urea electrolysis and overall water splitting at a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) were 0.110 and 0.153 V. Additionally, the CoNiFeS-OH electrocatalysts also showed great stability during long-term (20 h) and cycling (1000 cycles) measurements.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000813364900001		
J	Yu, Tong; Wang, Cong; Yan, Xu; Yang, Guochun; Schwingenschlogl, Udo					yu, Tong/0000-0001-6588-3463			Anisotropic Janus SiP2 Monolayer as a Photocatalyst for Water Splitting								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS				12	9			2464	2470		10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c03841		MAR 2021		MAR 11 2021	2021	The design of materials meeting the rigorous requirements of photocatalytic water splitting is still a challenge. Anisotropic Janus 2D materials exhibit great potential due to outstandingly high photocatalytic efficiency. Unfortunately, these materials are scarce. By means of ab initio swarm-intelligence search calculations, we identify a SiP2 monolayer with Janus structure (i.e., out-of-plane asymmetry). The material turns out to be semiconducting with an indirect band gap of 2.39 eV enclosing the redox potentials of water. Notably, the oxygen and hydrogen evolution half reactions can happen simultaneously at the Si and P atoms, respectively, driven merely by the radiation-induced electrons and holes. The carrier mobility is found to be anisotropic and high, up to 10(-4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1), facilitating fast transport of the photogenerated carriers. The SiP2 monolayer shows remarkably strong optical absorption in the visible-to-ultraviolet range of the solar spectrum, ensuring efficient utilization of the solar energy.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			1948-7185			WOS:000629172200042	33661638

However, previously reported composites are of low thermostability and poor electroconductivity. Here in the article, a novel hybrid composite of PANI/CeO2-TDI was proposed to overcome those shortcomings. Firstly, cerium dioxide (CeO2) was successfully modified by toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) via the addition reaction between TDI molecules and-OH groups at the CeO2 particles' surface. The reactive-NCO groups at the surface of those modified particles further reacted with polyaniline (PANT) by graft polymerization to give the target composite, whose structure is characterized by FTIR and XRD, respectively. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to characterize the thermal stability of obtained composites, and their electrochemical performances were characterized by rotating disc electrode (RDE) method in an electrolyte solution of 150 g/L H2SO4 and 65 g/L Zn2+ at 35 degrees C. The results showed that the target composite starts decomposing at about similar to 260 degrees C which is the highest compared with control samples (pure PANI (similar to 215 degrees C) and PANI/CeO2 (similar to 226 degrees C)), has the lowest static oxygen evolution potential (1.78 V vs MSE) compared with pure PANI (1.92 V, vs MSE) and PANI/CeO2 (1.84 V, vs MSE) as well as the dynamic oxygen evolution potential as shown in the measured anodic polarization curves, possesses the largest electrode surface current density (2.9x10(-4) A.cm(-2)) compared with pure PANI (7.3x10(-5)A.cm(-2)) and PANI/CeO2 (1.2x10(-4)A.cm(-2)), and also owns the largest reaction rate constant (1.39x10(12)m.s(-1)).									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			1452-3981			WOS:000429100400009

Traditional study on atmospheric corrosion of mild steels emphasized more on on-site experiments and data collection and physical analysis. Relatively, application of electrochemical researching methods has not been frequently used in this field. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method has been highly valued by electrochemists due to its multiple advantages. However, it has been less used in study of corrosion process of mild steels after the rust has been generated. As a matter of fact, during the service life of mild steel in atmospheric environments, the rust period is much longer than naked steel period due to the low corrosion resistance of these steels. Therefore, it is more meaningful to study the corrosion behavior of steels with rusts both for development of new weathering steels and for the prediction of the service life of weathering steels. In this work, the corrosion behavior of mild steel Q235 under simulated industrial atmospheric corrosive condition was monitored and studied by EIS method, with a focus on the evolution of cathode reactions. The result showed that there existed a critical condition of electrolyte film for corrosion rate of mild steel Q235 both for the substrate and rusted surface during wet-dry cycles. Comparison and analysis showed that, two parallel reactions, the reduction of oxygen and the reduction of rust, existed at the cathode during the corrosion process. With the increase of the wet-dry cycles, the activity of oxygen reduction tended to decrease, and almost disappeared in the end; while the activity of rust deduction tended to increase and became the main cathode reaction in a short period. In each wet-dry cycle, the corrosion rate first increased then decreased with the decrease of the electrolyte layer thickness, which was caused by the two synchronous and opposite effects on the corrosion reactions.									0	3	0	0	0	0	3			0412-1961			WOS:000329953000008

In contrast, in low light the psbH-less mutant has a poor ability to recover after photoinhibition and has a reduced rate of D1 turnover as compared with WT, Since the psbO gene encodes the 33 kDa manganese-stabilizing protein associated with the water-splitting reaction, the increased sensitivity to photoinduced damage is attributed to perturbation of electron transfer processes on the donor side of photosystem II (PSII). In contrast, the absence of H protein, encoded by the psbH gene, affects the acceptor side of PSII with preferential photoinhibitory damage occurring at the Q(B) site. The apparent consequence of this is that the psbH-less mutant, unlike the psbO-less mutant, is not able to regulate the rate of turnover of the D1 protein. In all cases it was shown that chloramphenicol, which blocks protein synthesis, enhances the rate of photoinhibition as judged by a decrease in oxygen evolution but slows down the rate of degradation of D1 protein compared to that observed during normal turnover, We conclude either that a factor or enzyme that is rapidly turned over is required to allow the D1 degradation to occur at in vivo rates or that the degradation and removal of the D1 protein from damaged reaction centers is synchronized with the availability of newly synthesized D1 protein. We favor the latter on the basis of the relationship between turnover rates and message level. Our findings also support the concept that D1 turnover is in some way regulated by the state of the Q(B)-binding pocket.									120	3	1	0	111	0	123			0006-2960			WOS:A1995RL61000040	7626631

In this study, NO+NO3- was synthesized by laser heating of N2O in a diamond-anvil cell and characterized by x-ray diffraction as a function of pressure at room temperature and low temperature. The unit-cell parameters were refined up to 32.2 GPa at 300 K, resulting in a denser structure than reported previously. The pressure-volume relations for NO+NO3- at 300 K were fitted to both Birch-Murnaghan and Vinet equations of state. The analysis indicates that NO+NO3- is denser than other nitrogen-oxygen assemblages, consistent with the conclusion that formation of the ionic species is driven by density rather than entropic effects. The low-temperature x-ray-diffraction data represent the first in situ measurements for this material, revealing consistent structural information and evolutions under pressure. These observations provide additional information on the stability relations and reaction diagram of N2O and NO+NO3-.

In recent years, cobalt phosphides (CoP) have been identified as a promising catalyst for HER in acid. However, the hydrogen adsorption on CoP is strong and a considerable overpotential has to be applied to enable HER. Here, we report a strategy to weaken the hydrogen adsorption on CoP through an electron deficiency in CoP induced by Au@CoP core/shell structure. A weakened hydrogen adsorption is confirmed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Au@ CoP gave an overpotential (eta) of 160 mV at the current density of 1 mA cm(CoP)(-2), which is about 50 mV less than pure CoP. It also exhibited a turn-over frequency (TOF) value of 0.68 s(-1) per active site at eta= 150 mV, which is more than 4 times higher than CoP. The strategy reported here holds potential to be extended to other electrodes for optimizing their hydrogen adsorption for HER.									67	5	0	0	0	0	67			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000438076200031

This study examines the optimal ratios between Ni and Co in the synthesized catalyst Ni1-xCoxMnO4 for high hydrogen production in the propane reforming reaction. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by XRD, TEM, XPS, and TPD of CO, C3H8, and H2O, and TPR of H-2. In addition, the reaction mechanism of propane reforming and the behaviors of the gases adsorbed on the catalyst were investigated by NMR analysis. The results confirmed that the reduction of Ni mainly occurs before that of Co, which means that Ni acts as the main active species. In addition, gas adsorption increases over catalysts that contain both Ni and Co; the synthesized catalysts also showed improved catalytic activities. The optimum ratio of Ni:Co is 0.6:0.4, with high hydrogen evolution of >80%; complete propane conversion was obtained for the 30NiO(0.6)Co(0.4)MnO(4)/Al2O3 catalyst over 10 h. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we investigate the redox reaction of CO2 on the porous carbon surface in ionic liquid electrolyte via synchrotron-based in situ ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) technique. We used ionic liquid to facilitate CO2 capture and stabilize CRR intermediate anions owing to its strong solvation for Li+. We demonstrate that pure CO2 reduction is not electrochemically active at room temperature on porous carbon electrode and its kinetics can be remarkably improved by H2O, which could be responsible for the discrepancy on CRR kinetics in the literature. However, in the presence of H2O, the formed LiOH gradually converted to Li2CO3 leading to severe electrolyte degradation in charging reaction. With the assistance of O2 in the ionic liquid-based electrolyte, we show, for the first time, CRR yields a low-valence amorphous carbon and Li2O2/Li2O in the Li?CO2 batteries. The formed amorphous carbon, Li2O2 and Li2O exhibit higher rechargeability and faster kinetics compared with Li2CO3-oxidation. These new findings provide direct evidence of CRR mechanism and insights in resolving the discrepancy on CRR kinetics in Li?CO2 batteries.									11	4	0	0	0	0	14			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000640487600002

In this work, Pt deposited N-doped mesoporous carbon derived from Aloe Vera is developed as an efficient and robust electro catalyst for ORR. Due to its high mesoporous nature, the aloe vera derived carbon (AVC) play a very vital role in supporting Pt nanoparticles (NPs) with N-doping. After doping N into AVC, more defects are created which facilitates uniform dis-tribution of Pt NPs leading to more active sites towards ORR. Pt/N-AVC shows excellent ORR activity when compared with commercial Pt/C and showing a half wave potential (E-1/2 -0.87 V Vs. RHE) and reduction potential (E-red similar to 0.72 V Vs. RHE) towards ORR. Even after 30,000 potential cycles, Pt/N-AVC shows in its E-1/2 only similar to 5 mV negative shift and lesser agglomeration of Pt NPs is seen in the catalyst. In membrane electrode assembly (MEA) fabrication, Pt/N-AVC as a cathode catalyst in a PEMFC fixture and performance were studied. The Pt/N-AVC shows good performance, which proves the potential application of this naturally available bio derived carbon, which serves as an excellent high durable support material in PEMFC. All these features show that the Pt/N-AVC is the most stable, efficient and suitable candidate for ORR catalyst. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The reaction is the paradigm for engineering direct solar fuel production systems since it is driven by solar light and the catalyst involves inexpensive and abundant metals (calcium and manganese). Molecular models of the OEC Mn3CaO4Mn catalytic cluster are constructed by explicitly considering the perturbational influence of the surrounding protein environment according to state-of-the-art quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) hybrid methods, in conjunction with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) structure of PSII from the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus. The resulting models are validated through direct comparisons with high-resolution extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopic data. Structures of the S-3, S-4, and S-0 states include an additional mu-oxo bridge between Mn(3) and Mn(4), not present in XRD structures, found to be essential for the deprotonation of substrate water molecules. The structures of reaction intermediates suggest a detailed mechanism of dioxygen evolution based on changes in oxidization and protonation states and structural rearrangements of the oxomanganese cluster and surrounding water molecules. The catalytic reaction is consistent with substrate water molecules coordinated as terminal ligands to Mn(4) and calcium and requires the formation of an oxyl radical by deprotonation of the substrate water molecule ligated to Mn(4) and the accumulation of four oxidizing equivalents. The oxyl radical is susceptible to nucleophilic attack by a substrate water molecule initially coordinated to calcium and activated by two basic species, including CP43-R357 and the mu-oxo bridge between Mn(3) and Mn(4). The reaction is concerted with water ligand exchange, swapping the activated water by a water molecule in the second coordination shell of calcium.									293	3	3	0	113	1	296			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000253951900053	18290643

Here, the single-, double-, and triple-atomic Cu embedded graphdiyne (Cu1-3@GDY) complexes have been systematically modeled by first-principles computations to evaluate the corresponding electric structures and catalytic performance. The results revealed that these Cu-1-(3)@GDY monolayers possess high thermal stability by forming the firm Cu-C bonds. The Cu-1-(3)@GDY complexes exhibit good electrical conductivity, which could promote the charge transfer in the electroreduction process. The electronic and magnetic interactions between key species (*H, *COOH, and *OCHO) and Cu1-3@GDY complexes are responsible for the different catalytic performance of HER and CO2RR on different Cu-1-(3)@GDY sheets. The Cu-2@GDY complex could efficiently convert CO2 to CH4 with a rather low limiting potential of -0.42 V due to the spin magnetism of catalysts. The Cu-1@CDY and CuAGDY exhibit excellent HER catalytic performance, and their limiting potentials are -0.18 and -0.02 V, respectively. Our findings not only provide a valuable avenue for the design of atomic metal catalysts toward various catalytic reactions but also highlight an important role of spin magnetism in electrocatalysts.

In this study, we reported the preparation of three-dimensional (3D) porous iron-doping NiSe2 nanowrinkles supported on commercial Ni-Fe foam through a facile method of oxalic immersion and subsequent selenization, and investigated the electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst for HER, OER and overall water splitting in alkaline solutions. To drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential is merely 145 mV for HER and 135 mV for OER, and a cell voltage of only 1.58 V is required for overall water splitting in a two-electrode system using the prepared electrocatalyst as both cathode and anode. Meanwhile, the iron-doping NiSe2 catalyst has desirable stability for HER, OER and overall water splitting, and its electrocatalytic performance shows negligible degradation during the durability test. The iron-doping effect, the unique porous nanowrinkle structure, and the in-situ growth of catalyst on the Ni-Fe foam are responsible for the excellent electrochemical performance of the prepared catalyst in water splitting. This work provides new insights for the design of non-noble transition metal chalcogenide catalysts with excellent electrocatalytic performance in overall water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, biomass kapok fibers (KFs) are introduced to fabricate Mo2C@N, P co-doped carbon (Mo2C@NPC) core@shell electrocatalysts that are highly active for acidic and alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). After facile prestabilization in the presence of (NH4)(2)HPO4 and subsequent carbonization under an inert flow, naturally available kapok fibers convert to hollow carbon microtubes with N, P co-doping, which afterward serve as the self-template and support to obtain ultrafine Mo2C nanoparticles encapsulated by N, P co-doped carbon shells. Such shells not only boost the HER performance due to the optimized electronic configuration and the promoted conductivity but also protect Mo2C from corrosive electrolytes and result in satisfactory long-term durability. In 1.0 M HClO4 and 1.0 M KOH, Mo2C@NPC exhibits excellent performance among recently reported electrocatalysts free from noble metals, featured by low overpotentials of 127 and 155 mV at the current density of -10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope of 63 and 64 mV dec(-1), respectively. The long-term durability of Mo2C@NPC can be confirmed by both accelerated degeneration and chronoamperometric tests. Elucidating efficient electrocatalysis on biomass-derived nanomaterials, this work will inspire further exploration of efficient electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000854978400001

Most of the papers discussed have been published within the last two to three years. A major emphasis of most of these papers is the synthesis of unique mesoporous materials by a variety of synthetic methods. Many of these articles focus on the control of the pore sizes and shapes of mesoporous materials. Synthetic methods of various types have been used for such control of porosity including soft templating, hard templating, nano-casting, electrochemical methods, surface functionalization, and trapping of species in pores. The types of mesoporous materials range from carbon materials, metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal nitrides, carbonitriles, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), and composite materials. The vast majority of recent publications have centered around biological applications with a majority dealing with drug delivery systems. Several other bio-based articles on mesoporous systems concern biomass conversion and biofuels, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, ultrasound therapy, enzyme immobilization, antigen targeting, biodegradation of inorganic materials, applications for improved digestion, and antitumor activity. Numerous nonbiological applications of mesoporous materials have been pursued recently. Some specific examples are photocatalysis, photo-electrocatalysis, lithium ion batteries, heterogeneous catalysis, extraction of metals, extraction of lanthanide and actinide species, chiral separations and catalysis, capturing and the mode of binding of carbon dioxide (CO2), optical devices, and magneto-optical devices. Of this latter class of applications, heterogeneous catalysis is predominant. Some of the types of catalytic reactions being pursued include hydrogen generation, selective oxidations, aminolysis, Suzuki coupling and other coupling reactions, oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), oxygen evolution reactions (OER), and bifunctional catalysis. For perspective, there have been over 40,000 articles on mesoporous materials published in the last 4 years and about 1388 reviews. By no means is this personal account thorough or all inclusive. One objective has been to choose a variety of articles of different types to obtain a flavor of the breadth of diversity involved in the area of mesoporous materials.									61	4	0	0	12	0	63			1527-8999	1528-0691		WOS:000417501800002	28661074

Antimony and tungsten additions are more effective for better durability of both the electrodeposited Mn-Mo-Sn-X(X=Sb,W)-O/Ir1-x-ySnxSbyO2+0.5y/Ti anodes than that of Mn-Mo-Sn-O/Ir1-x-ySnxSbyO2+0.5y/Ti anode for long period electrolysis of acidic 0.5 M NaCl solution to produce hydrogen. The high oxygen evolution efficiency (OEE) of the quadrate or more oxides electrocatalysts (i. e., 99.7-99.9 % OEE) maintained during prolonged electrolysis and even after electrolysis for five or more months. The Mn-Mo-Sn-X(X=Sb,W)-O/Ir1-x-ySnxSbyO2+0.5y/Ti anodes showed about 99.7-99.9 % of oxygen evolution efficiency.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0304-9809			INSPEC:12898087

Thus, this work experimentally revisits chemical and electrochemical characterization techniques with the aims of establishing a comparison of the electrochemical performance of typical IrO2, RuO2, SnO2-Sb, and Boron doped diamond (BDD) electrodes toward H2O oxidation under feasible experimental conditions, and highlighting those conditions where variability cannot be removed. Tafel slopes corrected for ohmic resistance and active areas are 127, 175, 42, 48 mV dec(-1) for BDD, SnO2-Sb, IrO2 and RuO2, respectively; while in the same order, the onset potential for water oxidation is: 2.49, 2.29, 1.47, 1.38 V vs SHE, measured at a current density of 0.5 mA cm(-2). Additionally, a new interpretation is presented for the analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and its connection with the OER mechanism: in the potential zone where Tafel is applicable is possible to appreciate the dielectric properties of the substrate for non-active anodes and elucidating the variation in the rate-determining step of water oxidation. EIS results suggest the possibility to use the time-constant associated with this stage as a parameter of the active or non-active behavior of the above electrodes. The advantages and drawbacks of different trapping molecules used to detect the center dot OH generation in electrocatalysis is discussed. The photoluminescence of coumarin could be used as a fast and reliable method for the evaluation of the electrocatalyst activity toward the center dot OH production. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

Instead of using gaseous oxygen, CL-ODH utilizes lattice oxygen in transition metal oxides, which acts as an oxygen carrier or redox catalyst, to facilitate the ODH reaction. The oxygen-deprived redox catalyst is subsequently regenerated with air and releases heat. The current study investigated alkali metal (Li, Na, and/or K)-promoted LaxSr2-x,FeO4-delta (LaSrFe) as redox catalysts for CL-ODH of ethane. While unpromoted LaSrFe exhibited poor ethylene selectivity, addition of Na or K promoter achieved up to 61% ethane conversion and 68% ethylene selectivity at 700 degrees C. The promotional effect of K on LaSrFe was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), O-2-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), H-2-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and O-18(2) surface exchange. XPS and XRD showed that K incorporates into the mixed-oxide structure at low loading levels (e.g., 0.1K-LaSrFe), whereas the surface of LaSrFe was enriched with K cation at high loading levels. LEIS indicates that the outermost surface layer was covered by potassium oxide. This surface layer was characterized to be amorphous under TEM. It was further determined that the surface layer increased the resistance for O2- diffusion from the bulk and its subsequent evolution into electrophilic oxygen species on the surface. As such, nonselective oxidation of ethane is inhibited. The synergistic effect of copromoting LaSrFe with Li and K was also investigated. Li and K copromotion improved the redox catalyst performance to 86% ethylene selectivity and 60% ethane conversion while maintaining an oxygen capacity of ca. 0.65 wt %, making it a promising candidate for CL-ODH.									50	3	0	0	3	0	51			2155-5435			WOS:000426804100018

Modulating anionic activities in layered Li-rich cathode materials with inverse spinel MnFe2O4 coating								MATEC Web of Conferences				358				01051 (5 pp.)	01051 (5 pp.)		10.1051/matecconf/202235801051				2022	2022	Layered Li-rich cathode oxides can provide high specific capacity due to oxygen anion redox involving in charge compensation process during cycling, but there is a severe structural transition from layered to spinel accompanying with irreversible oxygen loss during cycling, which lead to electrochemical degradation. The current researches show that the irreversible oxygen evolution reaction of layered lithiumrich materials in the first cycle mainly comes from the surface lattice oxygen, so the surface modification by the materials with more stable structure is one of the effective ways to improve the electrochemical performance of layered lithium-rich materials. In this paper, we report a modified layered lithium-rich cathode material by surface coating of inverse spinel MnFe2O4. The inverse spinel has strong polarization effect on anion migration due to its different atoms occupying octahedral sites from layered structure and it can also modulate the Fermi level and stretching the O-O bond, thereby increasing the energy barrier for surface oxygen oxidization. Furthermore, the three-dimensional connected tunnel structure of the inverse spinel also makes the surface layer of the material have a faster lithium ion transferring rate, and a large number of lithium storable vacancies inside of it improved the Li+ intercalation efficiency, initial coulombic efficiency and rate performance. Compared with the unmodified sample, the modified material coated with 2% MnFe2O4 has superior cycle stability and outstanding rate performance. It is hoped our work would provide the knowledge for the future development of high-performance cathode materials for Li-ion batteries.					3rd International Symposium on Mechanics, Structures and Materials Science (MSMS 2022)3rd International Symposium on Mechanics, Structures and Materials Science (MSMS 2022)	23-24 April 202223-24 April 2022		Tianjin, ChinaTianjin, China	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2261-236X			INSPEC:22161722

Dislocations were observed and on heating treatment moved toward the surface over time, resulting in an alloy nanoparticle with significant increase Ni content on the surface, which was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The thermally treated Pt-Ni octahedral catalysts showed significant improvement in catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction over the as-made nanoparticles, reaching values of 1.4 A/mg(Pt) in mass activity and 4.8 mA/cm(Pt)(2) in area specific activity. Our study shows the important effect of postsynthesis treatment on the optimization of Pt and Ni atomic distribution, thus the catalytic activity and stability; and the power of in situ ETEM in understanding the structural origin of enhanced catalytic performance with atomic level of details.

We present here the first demonstration of unique iron-oxide nanobeads (FeOx-NBs) based electrocatalyst executing both OER and HER with high activity. Thin-film electrocatalytic FeOxNBs assembly is surface grown via simple spray coating (SC). The unique SC/FeOx-NBs propels OER initiating water oxidation just at 1.49 VRHE (h = 260 mV) that is the lowest observable onset potential for OER on simple Fe-oxide based catalytic films reported so far. Catalyst also reveals decently high HER activity and competent overall water splitting performance in the FeOx-NBs two-electrode system as well. Catalyst also presents stable kinetics, with promising high electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 1765 cm(2), notable Tafel slopes of just 54 mV dec(1)(OER) and 85 mV dec(1)(HER), high exchange current density of 1.10 mA cm(2)(OER), 0.58 mA cm(2)(HER) and TOF of 74.29s(1-)@1.58VRHE, 262s(1-)@1.62V(RHE) (OER) and 82.5s(1-)@-0.45V(RHE), 681s(1-)@-0.56V(RHE) (HER).

J	Rees, JF; De Wergifosse, B; Noiset, O; Dubuisson, M; Janssens, B; Thompson, EM				Rees, Jean-Francois/F-9485-2010	Rees, jean Francois/0000-0002-8171-6689			The origins of marine bioluminescence: Turning oxygen defence mechanisms into deep-sea communication tools								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				201	8			1211	1221						APR 1998	1998	Bioluminescence, the emission of ecologically functional light by living organisms, emerged independently on several occasions, yet the evolutionary origins of most bioluminescent systems remain obscure. We propose that the luminescent substrates of the luminous reactions (luciferins) are the evolutionary core of most systems, while luciferases, the enzymes catalysing the photogenic oxidation of the luciferin, serve to optimise the expression of the endogenous chemiluminescent properties of the luciferin. Coelenterazine, a luciferin occurring in many marine bioluminescent groups, has strong antioxidative properties as it is highly reactive with reactive oxygen species such as the superoxide anion or peroxides. We suggest that the primary function of coelenterazine was originally the detoxification of the deleterious oxygen derivatives. The functional shift from its antioxidative to its light-emitting function might have occurred when the strength of selection for antioxidative defence mechanisms decreased. This might have been made possible when marine organisms began colonising deeper layers of the oceans, where exposure to oxidative stress is considerably reduced because of reduced light irradiance and lower oxygen levels. A reduction in metabolic activity with increasing depth would also have decreased the endogenous production of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, in these organisms, mechanisms for harnessing the chemiluminescence of coelenterazine in specialised organs could have developed, while the beneficial antioxidative properties were maintained in other tissues. The full range of graded irradiance in the mesopelagic zone, where the majority of organisms are bioluminescent, would have provided a continuum for the selection and improvement of proto-bioluminescence. Although the requirement for oxygen or reactive oxygen species observed in bioluminescent systems reflects the high energy required to produce visible light, it may suggest that oxygen-detoxifying mechanisms provided excellent foundations for the emergence of many bioluminescent systems.									130	0	2	0	103	1	141			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000073772900015	9510532

Along with the Ru sites, it is demonstrated that the functionalization promotes the formation of functional groups on the surface of the OMHCS. In a first stage, OMHCS are functionalized with the [(eta(6)-C6H5OCH2CH2OH)RuCl2](2) (Ru-dim) and [(eta(6)-C6H4CH(CH3)(2)CH3)RuCl2](2) (Ru-cym) organometallic compounds. Afterwards, Pt nanoparticles are dispersed by the microwave-assisted polyol method over the functionalized supports obtaining the low-metal content 5 wt. % Pt/OMHCSRu-dim and Pt/OMHCSRu-cym nanocatalysts. The degree of Ru alloyed is found to be around 35%. The low-Pt content Pt/OMHCSRu-cym and Pt/OMHCSRu-dim exhibit a higher catalytic activity for the Oxygen (OER) and the Hydrogen (HER) Evolution Reactions than the Pt/C benchmark and the Pt/OMHCS nanocatalysts. The overpotential for the OER at 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(OER)) is 300 mV and 210 mV smaller at Pt/OMHCSRu-cym and Pt/OMHCSRu-dim compared to Pt/C, respectively. The corresponding values of the HER at -10 mA cm(-2) (eta(HER)) are 14 and 18 mV smaller, respectively. The high catalytic activity of Pt/OMHCSRu-cym and Pt/OMHCSRu-dim has been attributed in part to the presence of Ru-0 and RuO2 species from organometallic functionalization, and the modification of the d-valence band of Pt. Their high performance for the OER and the HER opens new lines of research for the design of nanocatalysts for alkaline electrochemical water splitting.					29th International Materials Research Congress29th International Materials Research Congress	AUG 16-20, 2020AUG 16-20, 2020		Cancun, MEXICOCancun, MEXICO	2	1	0	0	0	0	2			2059-8521			WOS:000596804500006

It is shown that the sequence of anodic processes in borate solutions is the same for pH 6.3 and 7.4, namely, the dissolution and passivation of the ferrite component, dissolution and passivation of the cementite component, and anodic oxygen evolution at the nanocomposites' passive surface. With an increase in the pH the passivation potentials decrease, which agrees with a thermodynamic model of the formation of two-layer passive film Fe3O4/gamma-Fe2O3. It is found that the chloride concentration range, in which the local activation of alpha-Fe + Fe3C is possible, narrows with an increase in the cementite content.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0033-1732			WOS:000252801000006		
J	Han, Ying; Zhang, Kemin; Lu, Qingjie; Wu, Zhao; Li, Jun								Performance and mechanism of nickel hydroxide catalyzed reduction of N-nitrosodimethylamine by iron								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				772						145550	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145550		FEB 2021		JUN 10 2021	2021	Since iron (Fe) was first proven to have a strong reduction ability, it has been successfully applied to remove pollutants from water. In this study, nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)(2), a catalyst commonly used in hydrogen evolution reactions, was added to improve the activity of Fe to remove N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). The results showed that with the increasing Ni(OH)(2) dosages, the reactions accelerated. The NDMA removal rates increased when the pH value was 6 or 7. Further, when the dissolved oxygen concentration was in the range of 0-12.0 mg.L-1, it had little effect on the Fe/Ni(OH)(2) system, and all the reactions obeyed pseudo-first-order kinetics. 1,1-dime thylhydrazine and dimethylamine were formed during NDMA degradation. The capture of active substances and electron spin resonance method confirmed that the main active species were active hydrogen atoms, which participated in the removal of NDMA. Ni(OH)(2) acting as a catalyst was confirmed using wideangle X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Ni2+ dissolution. Further, catalytic hydrogenation was proposed as the main removal mechanism as Ni(OH)(2) promotes the corrosion of Fe and dissociation of water, thereby generating more active hydrogen atoms. In addition, Ni(OH)(2) may activate both Fe and NDMA. This technique could be employed as an alternative for NDMA reduction and expand the application field of Ni(OH)(2). (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, the properties of van der Waals (vdW) heterojunctions formed by group-IV mono-chalcogenides (MXs) (M = Ge, Sn; X = S, Se, Te) and MoS2 are systematically studied by first-principles calculations, including the vdW binding energy, the direction of an internal electric field and the electronic structure. The results predict that GeS/MoS2, GeSe/MoS2 and SnS/MoS2 vdW heterojunctions are potential direct Z-scheme water-splitting photocatalysts with appropriate band alignments, a wide light absorption range and low effective charge-carrier mass. Furthermore, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of the heterojunctions as photocatalysts are predicted. The results indicate that SnS/MoS2 with the Sn vacancy has a low Gibbs free energy of the HER (0.06 eV), and MoS2 with the S edge can offer OER active sites. This study provides a theoretical basis for the further design and preparation of a new two-dimensional overall water-splitting photocatalyst, which is conducive to the development of efficient two-dimensional photocatalysts in the field of clean energy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000847701600001	36043354

Here, a simple and inexpensive metal-free catalyst was synthesised by employing the bio-waste reed as the single precursor for both carbon (C) and silicon (Si). Interestingly, after the treatment with NH3, the Si element in reed became very active for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. The degree of NH3-treatment has a big effect on its ORR performance. Impressively, the onset potential of the optimized sample reaches up to similar to 1.00 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode), the half-wave potential is 0.89 V, and it also shows longer term stability for ORR as compared to commercial Pt/C. Moreover, this reed waste derived Si-N-C metal-free catalyst exhibits excellent performance as an air cathode for a Zn-air battery device. The coexistence of Si and N is essential for the high ORR activity. DFT calculation corroborated this conclusion by indicating that the Si-N structure is essential for the high activity.

To reveal a complete ORR profile of MoS2, using first-principles calculations, we examine the stabilities of various possible zero dimensional point defects on the surface and one-dimensional edge defects and comprehensively explore the ORR activities on pristine MoS2 surface and those defects in acid/alkaline solutions. It is found that the ORRs on the pristine surface and surfaces with point defects always require large overpotentials (>1.0 V), indicating a defect-immune resistance of the planar MoS2 surface against the ORR. However, the ORR overpotentials on edge defects can reach as low as 0.66 V, corresponding to a relatively high activity close to that of the prototypical catalyst Pt (overpotential similar to 0.45 V). Such contrasting ORR behaviors of point and edge defects are also understood in depth by analyzing the underlying thermodynamic and electronic-structure mechanisms. This work not only quantitatively explains the performances of MoS2 in both galvanic corrosion and electrochemical catalysis but also provides a useful structure ORR map that can facilitate adapting the realistic MoS2 to versatile electrochemical applications.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000502689000102	31718125

Interaction of UV-B (12.9 mWm-2 nm-1 for 12 and 25 min) and Cu2+ (0.3 and 0.5 mug ml-1) significantly increased the respiration rate and caused a shift from O2-evolution to O2-consumption. PSII exhibited the highest sensitivity to UV-B and Cu. A failure to restore DCPIP photoreduction by artificial electron donors (DPC, NH2OH and MnCl2) suggested that UV-B primarily inhibits the PSII reaction centre. Cu, however, reacts at multiple sites of the electron transport chain. The reduction and blue shifting of absorption peaks, suppression of fluorescence intensity and the excitation spectra indicate the involvement of phycobiliproteins in the inhibition of PSII activity. The synergistic interaction of UV-B and Cu appears due to increased Cu uptake brought about by an altered membrane permeability as a result of peroxidation of membrane lipids in the UV-B exposed cells.									46	5	0	0	43	0	53			0098-8472			WOS:A1995RB88300007

Nitrogen-doped Co, i.e. C59N, can facilitate the ORR process and it is a promising candidate for efficient ORR electrocatalysts. The intrinsic Cat also possesses a high catalytic activity, which is different from graphene and is probably attributed to the curvature or pentagon defect of fullerene. We deduce that the curvature and pentagon defect are important factors to tune the catalytic ability. The fitted activity volcano diagram shows that the best achievable ORR activity of the heteroatom-doped fullerene, in the thermodynamic viewpoint, appears at Delta G(*OH) = 0.25 eV, which could be realized by dual or three-element-doping of C-60 cage. The estimated standard equilibrium potential values are -0.52 and 0.25 V in alkaline and acid medium, respectively. Since the catalytic activity of the doped fullerenes depends on their IP and E-gap, here we provide a simple and easy method, by measuring the IP and Egap, to roughly evaluate the catalytic ability of designed catalysts. This is vital to guide the design of new ORR catalysts with high catalytic activity and durability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Donor stars in binary systems can lose most of their hydrogen-rich envelopes through mass transfer. As a result, not only are the surface properties affected, but so is the core structure. However, most calculations of the core-collapse properties of massive stars rely on single-star models. We present a systematic study of the difference between the pre-supernova structures of single stars and stars of the same initial mass (11-21M(circle dot)) that have been stripped due to stable post-main-sequence mass transfer at solar metallicity. We present the pre-supernova core composition with novel diagrams that give an intuitive representation of the isotope distribution. As shown in previous studies, at the edge of the carbon-oxygen core, the binary-stripped star models contain an extended gradient of carbon, oxygen, and neon. This layer remains until core collapse and is more extended in mass for higher initial stellar masses. It originates from the receding of the convective helium core during core helium burning in binary-stripped stars, which does not occur in single-star models. We find that this same evolutionary phase leads to systematic differences in the final density and nuclear energy generation profiles. Binary-stripped star models have systematically higher total masses of carbon at the moment of core collapse compared to single-star models, which likely results in systematically different supernova yields. In about half of our models, the silicon-burning and oxygen-rich layers merge after core silicon burning. We discuss the implications of our findings for the "explodability", supernova observations, and nucleosynthesis of these stars. Our models are publicly available and can be readily used as input for detailed supernova simulations.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000725148100006

Changing charge transfer mode with cobalt-molybdenum bimetallic atomic pairs for enhanced nitrogen fixation								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				10	29			15595	15604		10.1039/d2ta02455a		JUN 2022		JUL 29 2022	2022	The single-atom catalyst is currently regarded as a promising electrocatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of N-2 to NH3 but its development is impeded by the sluggish kinetics of the proton-coupled electron transfer on the unitary single-atom site. To address this issue, we developed a novel type of electrocatalyst with atomically dispersed Co-Mo pairs anchored on N-doped carbon frameworks (Co-Mo-SA/NC). Remarkably, the theoretical calculations reveal that the formation of Co-Mo asymmetric bimetallic active sites not only changes the "acceptance-donation" charge transfer mode on a single active site to "donation-donation" mode but also modifies the d-band center of the corresponding single atom, leading to enhanced polarization of the N N triple bond and inhibition of the hydrogen evolution reaction. As a result, the Co-Mo-SA/NC catalyst achieves a high ammonia yield rate of 37.73 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) and a desirable faradaic efficiency of 23.18% at -0.1 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, which are twofold higher than those of the isolated single-atom Co (Co-SA/NC) or Mo (Mo-SA/NC) catalyst. This study provides a promising new strategic design of an electrocatalyst using atomically dispersed metal-pairs to enhance electrochemical nitrogen fixation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000825019500001

On one hand, the obtained HPM solution is fully symbolic in terms of the coefficients of the equation, allowing us to use the same solution for different values of the maximum reaction rate, the Michaelis constant, and the permeability of the cell membrane. On the other hand, the numerical experiments show the high accuracy of the proposed ODP solution, resulting in 3.58 x 10(-4) as the lowest absolute relative error (A.R.E.) for a set of coefficients. In addition, a novel technique is proposed to reduce the number of algebraic operations during the process of application of ODP method through the use of the Taylor series, which help to simplify the algebraic expressions used. The powerful process to obtain the solution shows that the Optimized Direct Pade and homotopy perturbation method are suitable methods to use.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1026-0226	1607-887X		WOS:000444872000001

Herein, needle-like copper-boron (CuBx) is successfully grown in situ on 3D porous polyurethane plastic (PU) via mild electroless plating to obtain the flexible CuBx@PU bifunctional self-supporting electrodes. Owing to its high intrinsic activity, fast electron transfer capacity and 3D loose porous morphology, overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline simulated seawater during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are only eta(10) = 70 mV and eta(10) = 136 mV. The robust electrode only requires 1.45 V to achieve overall water splitting and can continuously work for over 20 h at 100 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, a series of CuBx-based ternary catalysts are simply modified on a plastic surface by this universal strategy with excellent catalytic performance. Attractively, the CuBx modification layer accelerates plastic aging and breaking down into small molecules of ammonia-ester after long-term seawater electrolysis at an industrial current density (>1 A cm(-2)). This work proposes a meaningful method for theoretical and practical application of green hydrogen production coupled "white pollutant" degradation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000824698900001

Nevertheless, widespread use of intermetallics for such applications is often limited by the complex energy-intensive processes yielding larger particles with decreased surface areas. In this regard, alternative synthetic strategies are now being explored to realize intermetallics with distinct crystal structures, morphology, and chemical composition to achieve high performance and as robust electrode materials. In this perspective, we focus on the recent advances and progress of intermetallics for the reaction of electrochemical water-splitting. We first introduce fundamental principles and the evaluation parameters of water-splitting. Then, we emphasize the various synthetic methodologies adapted for intermetallics and subsequently, discuss their catalytic activities for water-splitting. In particular, importance has been paid to the chemical stability and the structural transformation of the intermetallics as well as their active structure determination under operating water-splitting conditions. Finally, we describe the challenges and future opportunities to develop novel high-performance and stable intermetallic compounds that can hold the key to more green and sustainable economy and rise beyond the horizon of water-splitting application.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000662226000001	34257861

Herein, spinel-based CuCo2S4 nanoflakes were grown vertically on carbon cloth (CC) substrate to obtain hierarchical self-supporting CuCo2S4/CC electrocatalysts through a hydrothermal process. The influence of hydrothermal time on the surface morphology and electrocatalytic properties of the CuCo2S4/CC was investigated. The rational synthetic approach can significantly reduce the diffusion path and promote the transfer of charge. As a result, the optimized CuCo2S4/CC exhibits a significantly higher electrocatalytic activity than the control single metal sulfide catalysts (CoS1.097/CC and CuS/CC) in 1.0 M KOH solution, and relatively overpotentials of 204 and 280 mV are demanded to generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. The significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity benefits from the synergetic effect of the fast charge transport and abundant catalytic active sites. Moreover, in an overall water splitting system, a two-electrode setup constructed using CuCo2S4/CC as both cathode and anode shows a low voltage of 1.58 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and high durability. This study provides a rational strategy for improving the overall water splitting performance by constructing self-supporting spinel-based catalysts.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2196-0216			WOS:000632941200014

However, to obtain well-defined SMNCs and inhibit nanoparticle aggregation, traditional approaches generally involve numerous organic reagents, complex steps, and specialized equipment, thus hindering the practical and large-scale synthesis of SMNCs. In this review, we summarize green and sustainable synthetic methodologies for the assembly of SMNCs, including low temperature pyrolysis and solid-state, surfactant- and reductant-free, and ionic liquid assisted syntheses. The conventional application of SMNCs for electrochemical hydrogen evolution and the corresponding achievements are subsequently discussed. Finally, future perspectives toward the sustainable production of SMNCs are presented. (c) 2020, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we identify the key points for the photocatalytic oxidation over Pt-loaded Rh-doped strontium titanate allowing the conversion of alcohols efficiently and selectively to aldehydes and ketones under anaerobic conditions and visible light with an apparent quantum efficiency of pure benzyl alcohol oxidation at 420 nm of <= 49.5%. Mechanistic investigations suggest that thermodynamically the controlled valence band edge position via Rh doping provides a suitable oxidation ability of photogenerated holes, avoiding the powerful hydroxyl radical intermediates prone to overoxidation resulting in high selectivity. Kinetically, oxygen vacancies induced by Rh3+ substitution in the SrTiO3 lattice not only favor the dissociative adsorption of alcohols yielding alkoxy species but also induce the weakening of the alpha-C-H bond facilitating its cleavage by the photogenerated holes. Pt nanoparticles deposited as a cocatalyst contribute to the final hydrogen evolution.									22	4	0	0	1	0	22			1948-7185			WOS:000466991300009	30973724

One strategy is the modification of a material's crystal structure, and new methods allow for the synthesis and stabilization of potential materials in a range of crystal polymorph structures. We assess the potential reactivity of four metastable oxide polymorphs of MO2 (M = Ru, Rh, Pt, Ir) transition metal oxides. In spite of the similar local geometry and coordination between atoms in the metastable polymorphic and stable rutile structure, we find that polymorph reactivities cannot be explained by strain alone and offer tunable reactivity and increased stability. Atom-projected density of states reveals that the unique reactivity of polymorphs are caused by a redistribution of energy levels of the t(2g)-states. This structure-activity relationship is induced by slight distortions to the M-O bonds in polymorphic structures and is unattainable by strain. We predict columbite IrO2 to be more active than rutile IrO2 for oxygen evolution.									29	1	0	0	1	0	29			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000364024100052	26455918

Herein, we report a high-performance electrocatalyst based on vanadium oxysulfide/cobalt-cobalt sul-fonitride (VOS/Co-CoSN) for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER). The Co-CoSN film was synthesized on a copper sheet (CS) by a facile electrodeposition method. Then, VOS was electro-chemically grown onto the Co-CoSN@CS electrode at various deposition times. At the optimal deposition time (300 s), the obtained VOS-300/Co-CoSN catalyst was studied for OER and HER in alkaline and acidic media, respectively. The binder free VOS-300/Co-CoSN@CS electrode showed significant improvement in catalytic activity towards both OER (Tafel slope of 0.201 V dec(-1) with overpotential of 0.34 V @100 A m(-2 )current density in 1.0 M KOH media) and HER (Tafel slope of 0.048 V dec -1 with overpotential of 0.18 V@10 0 A m(-2) current density in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution). Additionally, the electrocatalyst exhibited high durability and flexibility for both OER (98% stability after 24 h at 100 A m(-2)) and HER (99% stability after 12 h at 0.18 V vs.RHE) in alkaline and acidic conditions, respectively. The present work not only suggests a simple and single-step strategy for the synthesis of VOS-300/Co-CoSN nanostructure but also opens up a new avenue for the development of bendable and stable bifunctional, non-noble metal electrocatalysts towards both OER and HER through water splitting procedure.

Considering the unexplored chemistry of transition-metal carbodiimides/cyanamides for the PEC water oxidation, we investigated MnNCN as an electrocatalyst for CuWO4 under AM 1.5G illumination in potassium phosphate electrolyte (pH 7). Surface functionalization of CuWO4 photoanodes with MnNCN increased the photocurrent from 22 to 30 mu A cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs RHE. Complementary structural analysis by means of XRD and XPS revealed that MnNCN forms a core shell structure MnNCN@MnPOx in phosphate electrolyte and mimics a manganese phosphate electrocatalyst. As such, the surface chemistry of MnNCN significantly differs from previous studies on the cobalt analogue (CoNCN). A separately prepared MnNCN electrode developed a small but detectable photocurrent due to photogenerated holes inside the semiconducting carbodiimide core of the MnNCN@MnPQ(x) structure.									28	2	0	0	2	0	28			0743-7463			WOS:000429385100009	29554428

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to examine the overall structure of the nano-tubes formed under potentiostatic conditions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been used to examine the structure of the oxide layer of a sample anodised for a relatively short period (30 min) and provides a new insight into the formation of titania nano-tubes. The fluorine ions are able to nucleate sites on the titanium metal and generate a series of interconnected cavities or pores in the oxide complex formed, allowing current to flow within this film. Under specific conditions the cavities and randomly dispersed pores can align in the direction of the applied electric field and link up to generate an array of tubes, where the passage of ions and water is optimised. We also suggest that oxygen evolution at the anode may play a role in the development of the nano-tubes.									84	10	0	0	4	0	88			0022-2461			WOS:000247934700035

Here, we identify an entirely planar ScB12 monolayer with desirable properties as an HER catalyst using an unbiased structure search combined with first-principles calculations. The superior stability and outstanding electrical conductivity of the ScB12 monolayer are confirmed in detail. Most importantly, the HER catalytic activity of the ScB12 monolayer is close to desirable (0.00 eV) according to the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H)). Moreover, the earlier-adsorbed H atoms on the ScB12 monolayer can effectively boost the catalytic activity of the following catalytic sites. Therefore, all atoms of the ScB12 monolayer can contribute to HER. The theoretical Delta GH values at hydrogen coverage from 1/36 to 36/36 via the 2 x 2 ScB12 supercell are in the range of -0.09 and 0.28 eV, which can be further adjusted to -0.18 and 0.00 eV under -1% biaxial strain. Furthermore, other new two-dimensional materials, which can be constructed with proper metals and the B-12 unit by diversified topologies, are inspired to further provide extendable possibilities of metal borides monolayers for materials and chemical applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000585970300037

Here, we have developed a cost/time-efficient synthesis method for MNC electrocatalysts with highly dispersed metal sites, using the commercially available cheap ZnO as the Zn source, reducing the cost of Zn usage by over 80%. Our specially chosen solvent formamide can react with ZnO and allow the formation of nano-sized ZnFeCo-Nx complexes uniformly distributed in the formamide-derived high-N-doped carbon substrate. Further annealing the ZnFeCo-N-C precursor will produce a highly dispersed FeCo-NC target product. Electrochemical measurements show that the prepared FeCo-NC is an excellent electrocatalyst for alkaline oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), rendering superior onset and half-wave potentials of 1.05 and 0.92 V, respectively. The Al-air battery assembled using this also shows a high specific power (204.9 mW cm(-2)) and a large specific capacity (552 mA h g(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2)), exceeding those of the 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. Our method may inspire the scalable and low-cost production of highly dispersed MNC electrocatalysts and their wide range of practical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2052-1537		WOS:000722293700001

The reaction, mimicking photosynthesis II, requires the use of an electron acceptor such the Ce4+ cation. This complex reaction, involving adsorbed water at the interface of the metal cation and Ce4+, has mostly been studied in homogenous systems. To address the ambiguity regarding the gradual transformation of a homogenous system into a heterogeneous one, we prepared and studied a heterogeneous catalyst system composed of IrO2, with a mean particle size ranging from about 5 angstrom to 10 angstrom, dispersed on a TiO2 anatase support, with the objective of probing into the different parameters of the reaction, as well as the compositional changes and rates. The system was stable for many of the runs that were conducted (five consecutive runs with 0.18 M of Ce4+ showed the same reaction rate with TON > 56,000) and, equally importantly, was stable without induction periods. Extraction of the reaction rates from the set of catalysts, with an attempt to normalize them with respect to Ir loading and, therefore, to obtain turnover frequencies (TOF), was conducted. While, within reasonable deviations, the TOF numbers extracted from TPR and XPS Ir4f were close, those extracted from the particle shape (HR-STEM) were considerably larger. The difference indicates that bulk Ir atoms contribute to the electron transfer reaction, which may indicate that the reaction rate is dominated by the reorganization energy between the redox couples involved. Therefore, the normalization of reaction rates with surface atoms may lead to an overestimation of the site activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2073-4344		WOS:000699401100001

The formation of surface adsorbates and their impact on oxide electronic structure can be challenging to probe experimentally, particularly for thin films which enable the study of epitaxial strain but have low surface areas. Here we present a detailed study using ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the reduction and oxidation of strained SrFeO3-delta, induced by changes in temperature, oxygen partial pressure, and water vapor exposure. We find that in comparison to the oxidized lattice, application of tensile strain promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies at the surface, facilitating the subsequent incorporation of oxygen into the lattice in an oxygen environment. While tensile strain does promote the formation of hydroxyls from water dissociation, the kinetics of this process appear more sluggish than on less-strained surfaces, likely due to a competitive surface interaction with oxygen or bulk absorption of hydroxyl species. These findings relating strain, oxygen vacancies, and surface reactivity yield important insight into the surface functionality of oxides for energy conversion and storage applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000564734600009		
J	Denissenkov, PA; Weiss, A				Weiss, Achim/C-4870-2013				Deep diffusive mixing in globular-cluster red giants								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				308	3			773	784						APR 1996	1996	Additional mixing between the hydrogen burning shell and the base of the convective envelope in stars on their first ascent of the red giant branch is traditionally considered as a possible cause for the star-to-star abundance variations in globular clusters. In the present paper we model this deep mixing by diffusion. Nuclear kinetics equations coupled with diffusion terms are solved to follow the evolution of stellar surface abundances for isotopes taking part in reactions of the pp-chains, CNO-, NeNa- and MgAl-cycles. Our task is to reproduce the ''global anticorrelation'' of [O/Fe] versus [Na/Fe] found recently in globular cluster and halo giants by Kraft et al. (1993) and the correlation of [C/Fe] with M(V) observed in M 92 (Langer et al. 1986). It is shown that both correlations can be accounted for by deep diffusive mixing with parameters for mixing depth and rate adjusted individually for each correlation. The deep mixing in red giants with solar metallicity is demonstrated to allow the interpretation of anomalous O-17/O-16 and O-18/O-16 isotope ratios in S and C asymptotic giant branch stars. In the conclusion we propose an observational test for the discussed deep mixing.									96	0	0	0	0	0	96			0004-6361			WOS:A1996UG91400012

The photocatalytic properties of the catalysts were evaluated by photocatalytic nitrogen fixation under simulated sunlight. The results indicated that the ammonia producing rate of photocatalyst OCN-10 (treated with 10 vol% hydrogen peroxide solution) reached the maximum (3980 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1)), which was 6.24 times that of bulk g-C3N4 (BCN, 638 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1)) and 2.46 times that of non-doped catalyst (OCN-0, 1620 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1)). Obviously, secondary calcination and oxygen doping led to the enhanced photocatalytic nitrogen fixation performance of OCN-10. To be specific, secondary calcination increased the specific surface area of g-C3N4 and the porous structure provided more nitrogen adsorption sites; Oxygen doping promoted the utilization of visible light, thus leading to a great increment in photoelectrons participating in nitrogen reduction reaction. The outcome of DFT calculation revealed an augmented N-2 adsorption energy of -97.31 kJ.mol(-1) for oxygen doped g-C3N4 in contrast to an initial adsorption energy of -72.59 kJ.mol(-1) for g-C3N4. Stronger adsorption bond facilitated subsequent electron transfer and nitrogen reduction. The as-synthesized highly-efficient photocatalyst can serve as a superior option for clean nitrogen fixation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1010-6030	1873-2666		WOS:000843392300004

High-entropy alloys (HEAs) offer a vast compositional space for tuning such properties. Too vast, however, to traverse without the proper tools. Here, we report the use of Bayesian optimization on a model based on density functional theory (DFT) to predict the most active compositions for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the least possible number of sampled compositions for the two HEAs Ag-Ir-Pd-Pt-Ru and Ir-Pd-Pt-Rh-Ru. The discovered optima are then scrutinized with DFT and subjected to experimental validation where optimal catalytic activities are verified for Ag-Pd, Ir-Pt, and Pd-Ru binary alloys. This study offers insight into the number of experiments needed for optimizing the vast compositional space of multimetallic alloys which has been determined to be on the order of 50 for ORR on these HEAs.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000704184700001	34506069

In such a synthetic strategy, applying modulated potentials effectively simplifies the traditional dealloying route, which usually requires additional corrosion process to dissolve nonprecious metals. The dealloyed AuNi nanodendrites (AuNi NDs) with tunable composition and uniformly elemental distribution are well developed by the one-pot strategy. Impressively, the as-synthesized AuNi NDs exhibit a higher electrochemically active area and definite improvements in electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and borohydride oxidation reaction (BOR) compared to the commercial Pt/C. In particular, the AuNi NDs are 81 mV more positive in half-wave potential and about 3.1 times higher in specific activity (at 0.85 V) for the ORR than Pt/C, together with excellent stability and methanol tolerance. The superior BOR activity is highly promising compared to the previously reported catalysts. The unique nanodendritic structure with Au-rich surface and bimetallic electronic effect is the main factor to greatly enhance the bifunctional catalytic performance for the AuNi NDs. Furthermore, such a newly developed facile method is of great significance because it is one of the first examples to effectively engineer dealloyed bimetallic nano-structures via the practical and low-cost route for electrocatalytic applications.									37	3	0	0	1	0	38			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000403452300006

ACS applied materials & interfaces				14	41			46374	46385		10.1021/acsami.2c05181				2022-Oct-19	2022	Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered potential electrocatalysts for efficient water splitting. However, the structure-activity relationship of most MOFs is not systematically analyzed for electrocatalysis for anodes and cathodes. In this paper, we provide a strategy to modulate the electronic microstructure of iron-based bimetallic MOFs (MFe-BDC (M: Mg, Zn, Cd)) grown on the nickel foam (NF) as bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The optimal bimetallic CdFe-BDC via modulating appropriate metal cations of IIA and IIB possesses excellent OER and HER performance with the lowest overpotentials of 290 mV at 100 mA cm-2 and 148 mV at 10 mA cm-2, respectively. The overall water splitting performance of the as-prepared CdFe-BDC requires 1.68 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in the real seawater media, and it exhibits the competitive H2 and O2 production rates of 6.4 and 3.1 muL s-1, respectively, in ambient alkaline conditions, suggesting its potential practical applications. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the relationship between microstructure and electrocatalytic performance of bimetallic MFe-BDC. This work emphasizes the significance of tailoring the electronic microstructure of bimetallic MOFs for efficient overall water splitting in alkaline and seawater environment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1944-8252		MEDLINE:36195560	36195560

It is generally highly complex and often evolves under operating conditions. Electrochemistry at these nanostructurations can be imaged both operando and/or ex situ at the single nanoobject or nanoparticle (NP) level by diverse optical, electron, and local probe microscopy techniques. However, they only probe a tiny random fraction of interfaces that are by essence highly heterogeneous. Given the above background, correlative multimicroscopy strategy coupled to electrochemistry in a droplet cell provides a unique solution to gain mechanistic insights in electrocatalysis. To do so, a general machine-vision methodology is depicted enabling the automated local identification of various physical and chemical descriptors of NPs (size, composition, activity) obtained from multiple complementary operando and ex situ microscopy imaging of the electrode. These multifarious microscopically probed descriptors for each and all individual NPs are used to reconstruct the global electrochemical response. Herein the methodology unveils the competing processes involved in the electrocatalysis of hydrogen evolution reaction at nickel based NPs, showing that Ni metal activity is comparable to that of platinum.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-9608			WOS:000821482300001	35789075

Recently a lot of attention has been dedicated to HER from single atom catalysts (SACs). The activity of SACs in HER is usually rationalized or predicted using the original model proposed by Norskov where the free energy of a H atom adsorbed on an extended metal surface M (formation of an MH intermediate) is used to explain the trends in the exchange current for HER. However, SACs differ substantially from metal surfaces and can be considered analogues of coordination compounds. In coordination chemistry, at variance with metal surfaces, stable dihydride or dihydrogen complexes (HMH) can form. We show that the same can occur on SACs and that the formation of stable HMH intermediates, in addition to the MH one, may change the kinetics of the process. Extending the original kinetic model to the case of two intermediates (MH and HMH), one obtains a three-dimensional volcano plot for the HER on SACs. DFT numerical simulations on 55 models demonstrate that the new kinetic model may lead to completely different conclusions about the activity of SACs in HER. The results are validated against selected experimental cases. The work provides an example of the important analogies between the chemistry of SACs and that of coordination compounds.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000750743100048	34821146

Our electrolyzers feature a high-pH environment for the oxygen evolution reaction and a low-pH environment for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The advantages of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis can be combined with those of anion exchange membrane water electrolysis by including a water splitting bipolar interface. First, we develop a KOH-free anion exchange membrane electrolysis cell. The cell's alkaline anode serves as an integral building block on the path to a bipolar system. In a second step, we use this building block to investigate the cell operation characteristics of various cell configurations. We study the cell performance as the bipolar interface is shifted progressively toward the anode. A bipolar membrane with and without a water splitting catalyst resulted in cell current densities of 450 and 5 mA cm(-2) at cell voltages of 2.2 V, respectively. Upon moving the bipolar interface directly between the acidic membrane and the high-pH anode, we achieved current densities of 9000 mA cm(-2) at cell voltages of 2.2 V. Our study demonstrates the potential of this water electrolysis configuration, which should be adopted for further scientific studies and may show promise for future commercial water electrolysis systems.									33	2	1	0	1	0	35			2574-0962			WOS:000586710300021

Hence, it is highly beneficial to develop a simple, efficient, and low-cost synthesis method of 1T-WS2 nanosheets from commercially available bulk 2H-WS2. In this study, we reported WS2 nanosheets synthesized directly from bulk WS2 via solution based electrochemical exfoliation with bipolar electrodes and investigated their electrocatalytic performances toward hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions. We successfully synthesized WS2 nanosheets of regular hexagonal symmetry with a 2H -> IT phase transition. This represents a novel method of producing 1T-WS2 nanosheets from bulk 2H-WS2 without compromising on its electrocatalytic properties.									43	2	0	0	1	0	43			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000407540400077	28752989

In the case of transition-metal compounds, both the transition metal cation and the anion must be controlled to maximize the electrocatalytic activity. This realization has driven many efforts devoted to engineering the cation chemistry, producing many state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Motivated by the critical role the cation plays in electrocatalysis, we seek to understand whether a similar effect can be achieved with the anion. Herein, we present a study on the effect of the anion substitution on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysis on cobalt oxysulfide nanoparticles. To control the sulfur substitution, we use ammonium sulfide to introduce sulfur to the cobalt oxide nanoparticles at low temperature without inducing secondary phase formation. We find that a lightly doped oxysulfide catalyst, which has the composition CoOxS(0.18), exhibits a metastable, distorted S-substituted CoO phase and is 2-3 times more active for the HER than either end-member of the substitution series. Our first-principles calculations attribute the HER enhancement to the stronger surface H adsorption which is maximally favorable at a relatively low doping level. Our work provides a protocol for synthesizing metastable mixed-anion materials and reveals the critical role of the anion on the surface physiochemical properties and the HER electrocatalysis.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000371077300009

H2O2 generation with acidified aqueous phase occurs prior to H-2 evolution when oxygen is present. No other organic solvent than highly toxic 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) has been reported in biphasic system for H-2 or H2O2 generation. In this work, we have used trifluorotoluene (TFT) instead of carcinogenic DCE, and studied these reactions in TFT-water biphasic system. To evaluate H2 flux, scanning electrochemical microscopy potentiometric approach curves to the TFT-water interface were recorded H2O2 was detected voltametrically at a microelectrode located in the vicinity of the interface. H-2 and H2O2 are formed and both reactions occur also in the absence of a hydrophobic salt in the organic phase. Their thermodynamics was discussed on the basis of Gibbs energies determined electrochemically with droplet-modified electrodes. The results show that DCE can be replaced by a noncarcinogenic solvent and the biphasic system for H-2 and H2O2 generation can be simplified by elimination of the uncommon hydrophobic salt from the organic phase									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1932-7447			WOS:000343016800038

The photoelectrochemical water splitting performance of the fabricated photoanode is evaluated and several kinetic parameters are extracted. Unlike previous reports on NiO/alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode for photoelectrochemical water splitting, stable photocurrent is achieved. Kinetic studies reveal 24 and 180 times increase in exchange current density at NiO/alpha-Fe2O3 compared to the pristine alpha-Fe2O3 with and without illumination, respectively. Consequently, 6 times increase in oxygen evolution is achieved due to synergistic effect of alpha-Fe2O3 and NiO.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2468-0230			WOS:000459836200023

TiC) using single crystals with the 200 or 220 face was carried out at temperatures of 500-1500 degreesC and oxygen partial pressures (P-O2) of 0.02-80 kPa. The oxidation proceeded linearly with time. The preferred (200) or (220) orientation of c/t- or m-ZrO2, m-HfO2 and Ti3O5 was recognized on the oxidized surfaces of the crystals or near the reaction interface. The oxide scale consisted of inner dense dark scale (zone 1) and outer porous white/gray scale (zone 2). Zone 1 contained much carbon at around 23-25 at.%. Simultaneous TG-DTA-MS analysis of HfC powders showed that the oxidation of Hf component in HfC occurs to produce carbon at 380-600 degreesC above which remaining carbon is oxidized with evolution of CO2. From HRTEM observation at the ZrC/zone 1 interface, it was found that c-ZrO2 crystallites are formed directly on the ZrC lattice while maintaining the above preferred orientation. The interfacial reaction with the formation of carbon on oxidation of the carbides was discussed from the above results. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Dilla, Martin; Jakubowski, Alina; Ristig, Simon; Strunk, Jennifer; Schloegl, Robert				Strunk, Jennifer/AAM-1274-2021				The fate of O-2 in photocatalytic CO2 reduction on TiO2 under conditions of highest purity								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				21	29			15949	15957		10.1039/c8cp07765g				AUG 7 2019	2019	Although the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4 by using H2O as the oxidant presupposes the formation of O-2, it is often not included in the product analysis of most of the studies dealing with photocatalytic CO2 reduction or it is reported to be not formed at all. The present study aims to clarify the absence of O-2 in the photocatalytic gas phase CO2 reduction on TiO2. By modifying P25-TiO2 with IrOx co-catalysts it was possible to observe photocatalytic water splitting, i. e. the formation of gaseous O-2 and H-2 in almost stoichiometric amounts, without the use of sacrificial agents, while bare P25-TiO2 showed no activity in H-2 and O-2 formation under similar reaction conditions. Investigating the effect of improved H2O oxidation properties on the photocatalytic CO2 reduction revealed that the CH4 formation on P25 from CO2 was completely inhibited as long as the H2O splitting reaction proceeded. Furthermore, we found that a certain amount of O-2 is consumed under conditions of photocatalytic water oxidation. A quantification showed it to be in the same order of magnitude as the oxygen which is missing as a byproduct from photocatalytic CO2 conversion. A detailed interpretation of the results in the context of the general understanding of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O on TiO2 allows the hypothesis that P25-TiO2 undergoes a stoichiometric reaction, meaning that the CH4 formation is not based on a true catalytic cycle and runs only as long as TiO2 can consume oxygen.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000477705800048	31074471

In order to bring about PEMFC commercialization, especially for automobile applications, developing high-activity and -selectivity catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of critical importance. Based on the density functional theory, the catalytic activity of the conductive, two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks TM3(HITP)(2) monolayer (where HITP = hexaiminotriphenylene; TM = Ni, Co, Fe, Pd, Rh, Ru, Pt, Ir, and Os) for ORR has been investigated systematically. Furthermore, the classical volcano curves of the ORR activity, as a function of the OH binding, are found where the Ni, Pd, and Pt located at the weak binding side suffer from the sluggish *OOH formation and prefer the inefficient 2e(-) mechanism, while for other elements belonging to the strong binding side, the reactions are hindered by the poison due to ORR intermediates. Based on the free energy profiles, the corresponding overpotentials mu(ORR) exhibit the inverted volcano curve as a function of the atomic number of the 3d/4d/5d TM active center in the same period. Based on the mu ORR data, ORR activity decreases in the order of Ir > Co approximate to Rh > Ni approximate to Pd > Pt approximate to Fe > Ru > Os. Herein, the Co, Rh, and Ir central atoms exhibit enhanced catalytic activity in combination with the desirable selectivity of the O-2 reduction to H2O. This systematic work may open new avenues for the development of high-performance non-PGM catalysts for practical applications of ORR.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2296-2646			WOS:000444384700001	30258838

Herein, we used organic polyelectrolytes such as (carboxymethyl cel-lulose) CMC and polyacrylamide polymers for the growth of Co3O4 nanostructures by aqueous chemi-cal growth method. The morphology and composition studies were performed on scanning electron mi-croscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spec-troscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) techniques. The structural properties and the surface chemistry of the Co3O4 electrocatalysts were correlated to the OER perfor-mance, and the enhancement mechanism with respect to pristine Co3O4 was observed to be specifically related to the polyelectrolyte templating role.Co3O4@CMC composites displayed reduced crystallite size, producing OER overpotential as low as 290 mV at 10 mAcm(-2) in 1.0 KOH and Tafel slope of 71 mVdec(-1), suggesting fast transfer of intermediates and electrons during water electrolysis. On the other hand, the use of polyacrylamide and its different tem -plating mechanism resulted in similar crystallite size, but preferential exposed faces and larger surface vacancies content, as demonstrated by HR-TEM and XPS, respectively. Consistently, this material displays cutting-edge OER performance, such as overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mAcm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 63 mVdec(-1). The proposed strategy for the preparation of Co3O4 nanostructures in the presence of CMC and polyacrylamide is facile, mass production, thus it could equally contributed towards the realization of hydrogen energy. Therefore, these nanostructures of Co3O4 can be regarded as an alternative and promising materials for the different electrochemical applications including fuel cells, metal air batteries, overall water electrolysis and other energy storage devices.

Yunyan87. The results showed that the fast chlorophyll fluorescence induction dynamics curve (OJIP) changed under cadmium stress, and both the minimum fluorescence value(Fo) and maximum fluorescence value (Fm) significantly decreased. Under cadmium stress, the maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), oxygen evolution complex (OEC), receptor library capacity (Sm), quantum yield for electron transport (phiEo), density of reaction centers (RC/CSo) and performance index (Plebs) decreased. While the relative variable fluorescence at K-step (Vk), the relative variable fluorescence at J-step (Vv) and approximated initial slope of the fluorescence transient (Mo) significantly increased. These data indicated that cadmium stress damaged tobacco leaf' s photosynthetic integrity, altered the quantity of per PS II reaction centers and the harmfulness to donorand acceptor-side of PS II and inhibited photosynthetic electron transmission. The fluorescence kinetic curves of Cd0.05+Si and Cd0.10+Si treatments coincided with that of the control. OEC, Sm, PhiE0, RC/ CS. and PI,b= were significantly increased, while Vk, V, and M. significantly decreased. Therefore, Cd0.05+Si and Cd0.10+Si treatments stabilized the structure and function of PS R, alleviated cadmium damage to photosynthesis of tobacco leaves and was beneficial to photosynthetic electron transport.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1002-0861			INSPEC:20667699

Such an enhancement has been primarily linked to the formation of low valent metal species that increase electrode conductivity. In this work, we report new insights into the electrochemical doping using highly ordered (110)-oriented hematite nanorods directly grown on FTO. The reductive pretreatment consists in applying negative potentials for a controlled period of time. Such a pretreatment was optimized in both potentiostatic and potentiodynamic regimes. We show that the optimized pretreatment enhances electrode conductivity due to an increase in charge carrier density. However, it additionally triggers changes in the morphologic, catalytic and electronic properties that facilitate the separation and collection of the photogenerated charge carriers causing an up to 8-fold enhancement in the photocurrent for water oxidation. The reductive pretreatment can be considered as a highly controllable electrochemical n-type doping with the amount of generated Fe2+/polaron species and the change in film morphology as the main factors determining the final efficiency for water photooxidation of the resulting electrodes.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000407765900067	28783187

Several tungstates and molybdate of uranyl and alkali metals presenting different original layered structures have been synthesized and their crystal structures determined, from single crystal X-ray diffraction data, collected with Mokappaalpha radiation and a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) detector. Their structures were solved using direct methods and Fourier difference techniques and refined by a least square method on the basis of F2 for all unique reflections. All crystal structures are characterized by a nearly linear (UO2)2+ uranyl ion which is coordinated by five equatorial oxygen atoms to give a pentagonal bipyramid environment, while transition metals adopt a tetrahedral or/and square pyramidal coordination for Mo6+, and tetrahedral, octahedral or/and square pyramid coordination for W6+ For each compound, the powder sample has been synthesized by solid state reaction, and characterized by X-ray diffraction. The alkaline cation mobility in different structures has been studied by electrical measurements. The observed low conductivity values with high activation energy may be explained by the strong connection of the alkaline cations to uranyl- oxoanion layers or framework and by the high density of these cations in the structures without vacant site. Infrared spectroscopy investigated at room, showed some characteristic bands of uranyl ion and oxoanion polyhedra.									0	0	0		0	0	0			1012-0394			INSPEC:12550230

A linear correlation between the rate of dioxygen evolution and the photopotential at the interface between the two liquid phases is observed. Investigation of the dependences of photopotential and rate of dioxygen evolution on the dielectric permittivity of the nonaqueous phase has shown that with increasing dielectric permittivity, one can observe a decrease in both the reaction rate and the potential difference.

Herein, nanosheet-constructed cobalt sul-fide microspheres incorporated with nitrogen-doped graphene foam (Co1-xS/NGF), a highly efficient bi-functional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, was obtained by controlled two-step synthesis. The nitrogen-doped graphene foam (NGF) underlying the Co1-xS microspheres provides an electrically con-ducting support for the catalysts, contributes small size and homogeneous distribution of the in-situ grown Co1-xS microspheres, and affords abundant active sites for fast and sufficient transport of mass and electrons and, therefore, highly enhanced catalytic activity through the strong synergistic effect of Co1-xS microspheres and the NGF substrate. In 1 M KOH, the Co1-xS/NGF hybrid catalyst exhibits remark-able OER and HER catalytic performance, with overpotentials of 233.6 mV for the OER and 163.7 mV for the HER at 10 mA cm(-2), and the corresponding Tafel slopes of 138 and 95 mV dec(-1), respectively. The hybrid material of Co1-xS/NGF even exhibits a lower overpotential (eta(20)) to reach 20 mA cm(-2) towards OER than that of RuO2, and its performance matches the best cobalt sulfide bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. Besides, the Co1-xS/NGF is highly stable for long-term water electrolysis in the 1 M KOH.

Previous surface energy calculation faces the challenge to precisely deal with the dipole electric field in a slab. Here we propose a method that by fitting the calculated surface energies with no dipole electric field through multivariate linear regression, the separate contributions to the surface energy from the cations coordination loss terms on the surface can be obtained. The fitted results can further be used to estimate the surface energies of slabs with dipole electric field directly and accurately. Using this method, the Wulff shapes of three phases of Li2CoSiO4, a kind of materials with great potential for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts, are precisely constructed.

The synthesis of several new cubanes allows evaluation of redox potentials for the [Co4O4] cluster, which are highly sensitive to the ligand environment and span a remarkable range of 1.42 V. The [(Co4O4)-O-III](4+)/[(Co3CoO4)-Co-III-O-IV](5+) and [(Co3CoO4)-Co-III-O-IV](5+)/[(Co2Co2O4)-Co-III-O-IV](6+) redox potentials are reliably predicted by the pK(a)s of the ligands. Hydrogen bonding is also shown to significantly raise the redox potentials, by similar to 500 mV. The potential-pK(a) correlation is used to evaluate the feasibility of various proposed OER catalytic intermediates, including high-valent Co-oxo species. The synthetic methods and structure-reactivity relationships developed by these studies should better guide the design of new cubane-based OER catalysts.									34	0	0	0	5	0	34			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000402384900013	29081963

However, issues regarding anionic redox activity and capacity degradation still need to be clarified for their performance improvement. In this work, a newly designed cation-disordered Li1.25Nb0.25Fe0.50O2/C cathode is investigated. The mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (mRIXS) reveals direct evidence of reversible anionic redox during cycling for the first time and defines the voltage range. Furthermore, differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS) finds that oxygen release is involved during high voltage charging with electrolyte decomposition. A surface densified layer induced by excessive oxygen oxidation is also identified by in/ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD). In the densified layer, lithium ion diffusion is blocked due to the reduced amount of percolating 0-TM (transition metal) network. Besides, irreversible oxygen loss during cycling leads to the sustained growth of the densified layer and results in larger lattice volume variations. Therefore, the performance degradation of the material is largely due to oxygen loss, surface densification, and large volume variation upon electrochemical operation.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000519615700007

Photocatalytic activity for H-2 evolution was significantly decreased by calcination at temperatures higher than 500 degrees C, although the specific surface area showed little change. This deactivation was attributed to fast charge carrier recombination. Samples deactivated by high temperature calcination were reduced by hydrogen at 500 or 700 degrees C, increasing both the density of long-lived charge carriers and photocatalytic activity. These results suggest that density of oxygen vacancies is an important factor for photocatalytic reactivity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To date, onestep synthesis of 1T-MoSe2 is a challenge. This work presents a facile one-step synthesis of reduced graphene oxide/1T MoSe2: Cu nanosheets. The experiment results indicated that the MoSe2 prepared by simple chemical solution reaction possessed 1T structures. The reduced graphene oxide(RGO) incorporation and Cu doping did not obviously affect the phase structure but decreased the average particle size. The iT structure, together with the Cu doping and interface effect between the MoSe2 and RGO, remarkably enhanced the conduction and photoconduction of the nanostructures. Thus, Cu doping and RGO incorporation also enhanced the hydrogen evolution catalytic activity and stability, making the RGO/MoS2: Cu nanosheet a most active and stable catalyst for hydrogen evolution.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000456755600025

Herein, graphene nanoribbon@MoS2 (GNR@MoS2) hybrids with hierarchical structure have been facilely fabricated as efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Derived from longitudinally unzipping of multi-walled carbon nanotubes, GNR sheets can provide a greater surface area for the decoration of MoS2, which not only stems from the outer wall sheets, but also from the additional exfoliated inner wall space, as well as from the unique ribbon edges. Furthermore, the interconnected GNR sheets can form a conductive pathway for fast electron transportation and an open structure for convenient electrolyte permeation. As a consequence, the GNR@MoS2 hybrids exhibit excellent electrochemical activity as HER catalysts with a low onset potential of -0.11 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode and a small Tafel slope of 43.4 mV per decade. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of the GNR@MoS2 hybrids can be ascribed to their unique hierarchical architecture with numerous active sites, as well as synergistic effects between the electrocatalytic MoS2 nanosheets and conductive GNR framework, making them promising materials for future electrocatalysts in the HER.									18	0	0	0	4	0	18			2046-2069			WOS:000369639400020

However, when NiMoO4 based catalysts applied in alkaline oxidation/reduction conditions, the in-situ formed surface oxide hydroxides/hydroxyls will further simultaneously enhance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via such especial surface structural reconstruction. Here self -supported NiMoO4 is constructed by one-step hydrothermal for OER, followed by vapor deposition method, hierarchical catalyst consisting of monocrystalline P-NiMoOx nanorods decorated by CoP-Co2P nanoparticles (denoted as CoPx/P-NiMoOx) is designed for HER. During OER, surface NiMoO4 in-situ transforms into highly active NiOOH. The reconstructed NiOOH/NiMoO4 exhibits outstanding OER performance (overpotentials of 207 and 266 mV at 10 and 100 mA center dot cm &#xe213; 2). As HER proceeds, electro-reduction promotes dissolution of molybdenum, meanwhile, hydroxyls from dissociated H2O molecules coupled with exposed nickel sites form amorphous hy-droxyls layers at surface dissolution sites. The reconstructed amorphous-hydroxyls/CoPx/P-NiMoOx catalyst possesses highly efficient HER activity (overpotentials of 9 and 67 mV at 10 and 100 mA center dot cm &#xe213; 2). Additionally, the integrating water splitting system requires only 1.55 V to reach 100 mA center dot cm &#xe213; 2 with excellent stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000848218400003

In this work, ultrathin NiFe alloy layers are coated on the surface and the up-sidewalls of the Ni(Cu) nanotubes by a selective electrodeposition and used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. Having a 3D honeycomb-like structure, superlarge ECSA of Ni(Cu)/NF and NiFe alloy films simultaneously fabricated on the surface of Ni foam, the NiFe@Ni(Cu)/NF catalyst shows a Pt-like performance in hydrogen evolution reaction and efficient oxygen evolution reaction activity in alkaline medium. The fabricated NiFe@Ni(Cu)/NF electrode delivers current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of merely 36 and 209 mV for HER and OER. Furthermore, the water electrolysis cell assembled with the as-prepared catalyst requires an energy input as low as 1.525 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2). The bifunctional NiFe@Ni(Cu)/NF also presents remarkable stability in alkaline solution with negligible degradation rate in potential. This study provides a new approach for rational design of heterohierarchical structures of bifunctional electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, novel hybrid non-stoichiometric nanocomposite Co3S4/ Co0.85Se electrocatalyst materials were synthesized using a simple and one-pot eco-friendly hydrothermal method. The as-prepared samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) for structural features. Crystalline phases of Co3S4, Co0.85Se, and mixed phases in the hybrid samples were confirmed through XRD. Uniformly distributed agglomerated nanoparticles (30-80 nm) of Co3S4, clearly distinguishable nanoaggregates (20-90 nm) of Co0.85Se, and nanoflakes covered with nanoparticles (30-150 nm) of Co3S4/Co0.85Se were confirmed by FESEM. The synergistic effects of the hybrid nanocomposite due to the combination of Co3S4 (containing two different oxidation states of cobalt) and nonstoichiometric Co0.85Se, was investigated towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrocatalytic studies confirmed that the Co3S4/Co0.85Se electrocatalyst exhibited a low overpotential of 362 mV @ +30 mA. cm (-2) towards the OER in an alkaline solution in comparison with Co3S4 and Co0.85Se electrocatalysts. Furthermore, a low overpotential of 1.59 V at a high current density and a high electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of 210 cm(-2) was achieved due to the combined effects of chemical coupling between the Co3S4 and Co0.85Se. Chronoamperometric studies revealed excellent stability of the hybrid nanocomposite samples with negligible changes in the overpotential, even after 30 hours of testing. The synergetic effect of cobalt chalcogenides due to the nanoscale interaction was confirmed by the enhanced electrocatalytic activity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2468-0230			WOS:000681238000003

However, the performance of a Zn-air/M battery relies on finding a dual-functional cathode material, which can effectively serve both battery's chemistries. Here, we demonstrate the superior performance of a hybrid battery cathode based on Fe-doped Ni double hydroxide nanoflakes and activated carbon material. Fe doping transforms the disordered crystal structure of Ni hydroxide to a stable hydrotalcite-type structure with significantly enhanced redox conversion capacity, improved electric conductivity, and superior oxygen evolution reaction activity. Therefore, the hybrid battery exhibits a high total energy density, unprecedented energy conversion efficiency (87% at 4 mA/cm(2)), and superior power density (100 mW/cm(2) at 60 mA/cm(2)) that outperform reported hybrid batteries of other cathode materials. Moreover, the hybrid Zn-air/Ni1_xFex-layered double hydroxide battery is featured with the capability of high-rate charging owing to the rapid kinetics of the redox reactions and the excellent catalytic activity of the cathode materials.

Here, self-supported bimetallic cobalt-molybdenum nitride with silver nanoparticles decoration (Co-Mo-N@Ag) growth in situ on carbon paper was rationally designed and fabricated for overall water splitting in alkaline media. By virtue of the admirable compositional and structural advantages of exposed enough active sites, regulated favorable electronic structure, and engineered powerful interface synergy effect, the Co-Mo-N@Ag electrode exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance in 1 M KOH. In the details, an excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an extremely low overpotential of 234 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1), as well as a remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with a low overpotential of 90 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 73 mV dec(-1) were acquired by Co-Mo-N@Ag. As a result, it takes a low voltage of 1.56 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline overall water splitting.

Despite the fact that bivalent metal ions, such as Ni2+, Co2+ and Zn2+, have been demonstrated to play a highly specialized role in water oxidation or OER, the role of trivalent metal ions in LDH structures within these areas requires a lot of research. Hence, herein, we demonstrated that Al3+ had a positive effect on the size and the bandgap energy of the as-synthesized LDHs, which led to the improvement in electrochemical performance. According to powder X-ray diffraction and field-emission scanning electron microscopy, it was found that Al3+ ions could regulate the crystallinity and the size of Ni3AlxFe1-x-LDHs nanoparticles. Ni3AlxFe1-x-LDHs were used as electrocatalyst materials in carbon paste electrodes (CPEs) for the OER in a neutral solution. The obtained results showed that the electrocatalytic activity of Ni3Al0.25Fe0.75-LDH was much better than the other binary-component LDHs. The Tafel slope of the OER in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH = 7) at the ternary-component Ni3Al0.25Fe0.75-LDH electrocatalyst (15 mV dec(-1)) was lower than that of Ni3Fe-LDH (61 mV dec(-1)) and Ni3Al-LDH (98 mV dec(-1)); also, it exhibited a low overpotential for this process. The high electrocatalytic activity of Ni3Al0.25Fe0.75-LDH may be attributed to the co-existence of Al3+ and Fe3+ active sites and also to its decreased bandgap in comparison to that of Ni3Fe-LDH and Ni3Al-LDH.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000445827700083

We found that the most active oxides (Au << Pt < Ir < Ru << Os) are, in fact, the least stable (Au >> Pt > Ir > Ru >> Os) materials. We suggest that the relationships between stability and activity are controlled by both the nobility of oxides as well as by the density of surface defects. This functionality is governed by the nature of metal cations and the potential transformation of a stable metal cation with a valence state of n = +4 to unstable metal cation with n > +4. A practical consequence of such a close relationship between activity and stability is that the best materials for the OER should balance stability and activity in such a way that the dissolution rate is neither too fast nor too slow.									420	8	0	0	25	0	423			1948-7185			WOS:000339365000015	26277818

Over the last few decades, the development of SOC technologies in particularly SOFCs has experienced significant progress and much of the recent research have paid great efforts in understanding the processes occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. As electrochemical reactions mainly proceed at the gas, electrode and electrolyte three phase boundaries (TPBs), the microstructure and properties of the electrode/electrolyte interfaces thus play a crucial role in determining the overall cell performance and durability. Herein, we review the progress and achievements in the fundamental researches of the electrode/electrolyte (mainly oxygen-conducting) interface evolution behavior under open circuit and polarization conditions. Studies involving interfacial phenomena such as interface formation and reactions, element segregation and diffusion, micropore formation and delamination are summarized and discussed in detail. Besides, the state of the art characterization techniques that have been employed to examine the interface behavior are reviewed. Finally, the challenges and prospects of the interface research in the improvement of the performance and durability of a SOC device are discussed.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1002-0071	1745-5391		WOS:000669230900001

J	Zhang, Jiaxin; Wang, Yidan; Dong, Hao; Zhou, Xin								Theoretical investigation of loading Ni clusters on the alpha-Ga2O3 surfaces for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution								JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY				30				8	18		10.1016/j.jechem.2018.03.007				MAR 2019	2019	In the semiconductor-based photocatalysts for overall water splitting, loading proper cocatalysts play a crucial role in enhancing the photocatalytic activity. In this work, we have chosen Ni-n/alpha-Ga2O3 as a model and provided detailed density functional theory calculations to investigate the function of cocatalysts in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We have studied the formation and stability of Ni-n (n= 1-4) cluster on two stable surfaces of alpha-Ga2O3 (001) and (012). In a Ni-n/alpha-Ga2O3 system, as the Ni 3d states well overlap with O and Ga states, the excited electrons transferred from Ga to Ni may participate in HER. We theoretically predict that introduction of Ni-n cluster on (012) surface can elevate the Fermi level toward the conduction band, which is favorable for the occurrence of HER. Electrochemical computations are used to explore the mechanism of HER. It is found that, in most of Ni-n/alpha-Ga2O3 systems, the active sites of HER are on Ni-n clusters. Loading Ni-n clusters not only importantly reduces the Gibbs free energy of HER but also improves the reaction activity of surface 0 and Ga sites in HER. Our calculations reasonably explain the experimental observation on significant enhancement of activity for generating hydrogen after loading nickel oxide cocatalysts.

In this work, the catalytic properties and thermal stability of PdCu SAAs with a crown-jewel (CJ) structure are studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation method. The DFT results reveal that CJ-structured PdCu SAAs show excellent HER and ORR catalytic performance, and can be regarded as a promising alternative to Pt catalysts towards the ORR or HER. Additionally, we attempt to explain the high catalytic activity of PdCu SAAs by electronic structure analysis. In addition, MD simulation results confirm the thermal stability of CJ-structured PdCu. More importantly, we found that CJ-structured PdCu clusters undergo a structural transformation from cuboctahedral (Cubo) to icosahedral (Ico) structure by heating or after the adsorption of reaction intermediate, which indicates that Cubo is less stable than the Ico structure. Besides, Cubo-Ico transformation is size-dependent and only found in small clusters. Furthermore, the effects of size and morphology on melting properties are discussed. The melting point increases as cluster size increases, which agrees well with Pawlow's law.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000731740500001	35424490

The photocatalytic activity was remarkably improved by the introduction of a small amount of Na ion into SrTiO3 photocatalyst using rhodium and chromium mixed oxide (Rh0.7Cr1.3O3) as the co-catalyst. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity was influenced by the purity of the raw materials used for preparing Na+-SrTiO3 photocatalyst rather than the properties that originated with the preparation methods. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of overall H2O splitting was 28% under the irradiation at 365 nm over the optimal Rh0.7Cr1.3O3/Na+-SrTiO3 photocatalyst. The photocatalytic performances of Rh(2-y)CryO(3)/Na+-SrTiO3 were confirmed to be further improved by separating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) site and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) site over the surface by co-loading CoOx co-catalyst as OER sites. The states of Na+ doped SrTiO3 was investigated to make clear the key factors in the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity by the doping of aliovalent ions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Various metal-free electrocatalysts are highly considered as desirable ORR electrocatalysts due to their enhanced ORR activity and durability. Here, we report a facile, low cost and effective strategy to synthesize metal-free N, P-codoped porous carbon fibers (NPCF) via the simple pyrolysis of inexpensive polypyrrole as nitrogen source and phosphoric acid as phosphorus source. Results indicate that the NPCF-2 catalyst with large surface area (1569.3 m(2) g(-1)) and high density of graphitic N, pyridinic N and P-C bonding exhibits outstanding alkaline ORR catalytic activity, long-term durability and high methanol tolerance, which is ascribed to the homogenous distribution of nitrogen and phosphorus atoms in the carbon fibers, rich micro/mesoporous structure and the synergistic effects of nitrogen and phosphorus atoms around the adjacent carbon atoms. Especially, the active graphitic N, pyridinic N and P atoms in the carbon fibers can regulate the electronic structure of carbon atoms, making the nitrogen, phosphorus and adjacent carbon atoms as active sites to promote ORR performance. This work provides a simple scalable and low-cost approach to produce metal-free N, P-codoped porous carbon as effective alternative to Pt-based electrocatalysts.

Hydrogen is one of the promising fuels with zero pollution which can be abundantly produced by electrolysis of water. But, the challenge is to produce hydrogen with least energy consumption via renewable sources from electrolysis of water. This has led to extensive research in synthesis of novel low-cost catalysts with high performance. However, there is still a need for a robust catalyst with low cost and long-term stabilities. Herein we demonstrate an alternative approach to synthesize these catalysts in which nickel-based catalysts are synthesized by extrusion-based 3D printing (3DP). The catalyst precursor is initially 3D printed by nickel-based powder. The precursor is oxidized and further sulfurized to convert them to catalysts with remarkable performance. The oxidized 3DP nickel (3DP nickel @NiO) shows remarkable performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low overpotential of 113.56 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The sulfurized 3DP nickel (3DP nickel@NiS) can act as a bifunctional catalyst with a low overpotential of 166.17 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and 220 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Thus, this work demonstrates 3D printing as a promising way of synthesis to produce robust, binder-free catalysts in industries for mass scale application.					3rd International Conference on Progress in Additive Manufacturing (Pro-AM)3rd International Conference on Progress in Additive Manufacturing (Pro-AM)	MAY 14-17, 2018MAY 14-17, 2018		Singapore, SINGAPORESingapore, SINGAPORE	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2424-8967		*****************	WOS:000485804300102

When adding urea and MB, the anodic current density of alpha-MoO3 reach 310.98 and 403.72 mA/cm(2) at 393 mV, which is 5.2 and 7.1 times higher than that (50.08 mA/cm(2)) in KOH electrolyte solution, respectively. It is proposed that the anodic oxidations of MB and urea are easier than water oxidation, thus increasing the anodic current greatly. Most importantly, the overpotential of hydrogen evolution reaction is also decreased obviously by MB and urea. At 40 mA/cm(2), the cell voltages of urea/KOH (1.611 V) and MB/KOH (1.597 V) systems have decreased by 16.53% and 17.56%, compared with the KOH system (1.93 V), respectively. It is seen the system is energy-saving obviously. The innovative design can not only efficiently produce hydrogen but also can degrade environmental pollutants concurrently. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, a novel concept of all-in-one bipolar electrode (AIOBE) is proposed for high-efficiency and compact PEMECs with the help of 3D printing and sputtering coating. AIOBE ideally integrated catalyst layer (CL)/gas diffusion layer/bipolar plate/current distributor/gasket, which significantly reduced component quantity on the cathode side of PEMECs from 5 to 1, cut down on part weight and volume, and drastically accelerated the fabrication and maintenance processes. Moreover, AIOBE with the micro-scale flat surface and nano-scale rough CL provided an ultralow ohmic resistance (similar to 100 mOhm cm(2)) and a high catalyst utilization. Finally, AIOBE delivered a practical voltage of 1.62 V and a high energy efficiency of 91% at 1000 mA/cm(2), and its mass activity (4.48 A/mgPt) was 14 times higher than conventional PEMECs. This work provides a new route for developing highly compact electrochemical devices, such as fuel cells, electrolyzers for N-2 reduction and CO2 conversion, and many more.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000708834100005

Among all the good ORR catalysts, the partially substituted double perovskite oxide (AA'B2O5+delta) has the unique layered structure, providing a great flexibility regarding the optimization of its electronic structures and physicochemical properties. Here, it is demonstrated that the double perovskite oxide, i.e., NdBa0.75Ca0.25Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta, is a good ORR catalyst at both room and elevated temperatures. Under ambient condition, its half-wave potential of ORR in alkaline media is as low as 0.74 V versus RHE; at 650 degrees C, the cathodic polarization resistance is merely 0.0276 Omega cm(2) according to a symmetric cell measurement, whereas the solid oxide fuel cells using this cathode exhibit a maximum power density of 1982 mW cm(-2). From various materials characterizations, it is hypothesized that its excellent ORR activity is strongly correlated with the crystallographic, electronic, and defect structures of the materials.									83	5	0	0	1	0	86			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000379731500007

A series of electron microscopy characterization results suggest that the growth of 3D hierarchical flower-like TiO2 nanostructures is governed by a nucleation and nuclei growth-dissolution-recrystallization growth mechanism from time-dependent morphology evolution. The influence of the experimental parameters such as reaction species, temperature, and time on the morphology growth was systematically studied. Importantly, the prepared 3D hierarchical flower-like TiO2 nanostructures showed enhanced photocatalytic activity compared with Degussa P25 for the degradation of phenol under UV light irradiation, which is attributed to its special hierarchical porous structure, good permeability, high light-harvesting capacity and more surface active sites. Electron spin resonance (ESR) detection of active oxygen species (hydroxyl radicals) and the total organic carbon (TOC) changes are also investigated to evaluate the degradation efficacy.									233	18	0	0	18	0	242			1466-8033			WOS:000288905000026

The molecular-type energy transition and quantum confinement effects of Au NCs are fundamentally different from those of Au NPs. Because of these intriguing features, Au NCs are gaining special attention in catalysis research and are being used as model catalysts to understand catalytic properties and structures at the atomic level. Although catalysis research is a longstanding discipline, the fundamental insights into structure-property relationships at the atomic level, such as reaction mechanism/activation at the catalyst surface and identification of actives sites, remain largely unexplored. Atomically precise Au NCs can provide access to such information because of their exact molecular information, monodisperse nature, molecule-like properties, and well-resolved atomic structure from X-ray crystallography, akin to protein structures in enzyme-based catalysis. This accurate data also provides essential information for computational investigations. In this Perspective, we summarize the recent progress made using Au NCs as electrocatalytic materials for oxygen reduction, water electrocatalysis, and electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, and we discuss challenges to overcome existing limitations. We hope that our Perspective motivates more researchers to investigate different aspects of Au NCs toward a better understanding of the structure-performance correlations in catalysis.									13	0	0	0	3	0	12			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000708647800003

These preparations were incubated in the dark for 24 h in the presence of increasing reductant/photosystem II ratios, and the loss of oxygen evolution activity and of Mn(II) was determined for each incubation mixture. Monte Carlo simulations of these data yielded models that provide insight into the structure, reactivity, and oxidation states of the manganese in the oxygen-evolving complex. Specifically, the data support oxidation states of Mn(III)(2)/Mn(IV)(2) for the dark stable S-1 state of the O-2-evolving complex. Activity and Mn(II) loss data were best modeled by assuming an S-1 --> S-1 conversion of intermediate probability, a S-1 --> S-3 reaction of high probability, and subsequent step(s) of low probability. This model predicts that photosystem II Mn clusters that have undergone an initial reduction step become more reactive toward a second reduction, followed by a slower third reduction step. Analysis of the Mn(II) release parameters used to model the data suggests that the photosystern II manganese cluster consists of three Mn atoms that exhibit a facile reactivity with both reductants, and a single Mn that is reducible but sterically trapped at or near its binding site. Activity assays indicate that intact photosystem II centers reduced to S-1 can evolve oxygen upon illumination, but that these centers are inactive in preparations depleted of the extrinsic 23 and 17 kDa polypeptides. Finally, it was found that a substantial population of the tyrosine D radical is reduced by hydroxylamine, but a smaller population reacts with hydroquinone over the course of a 24 h exposure to the reductant.									33	0	1	0	16	0	34			0006-2960			WOS:000226969400039	15697239

The irreversibly adsorbed Bi showed a stable redox couple at 0.33 V whose maximum charge corresponded to the coverage of 0.33. The pristine layer of irreversibly adsorbed Bi grew from islands to large domains of the first monolayer, eventually to large domains of the monolayer with scattered protrusions of the second layer. During an electrochemical treatment from open circuit potential (similar to 0.25 V) to 0.1 V, the domains of the pristine Bi layer shrunk and the Bi in the second layer moved to the first layer to form a compressed layer of elemental Bi. When the elemental Bi was re-oxidized at 0.35 V, there was no structural change to denote that the structures of the pristine and re-oxidized layers of oxygenated Bi differ from each other. The structural evolution during the electrochemical treatments is discussed in terms of removal and reinsertion of oxygen species.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000327077000019

In this work, we demonstrate an integrated hydrogen gas production and energy storage system by implementing a self-powered water splitter with hydrogen gas batteries. Such an integrated system is achieved by the application of a multifunctional nickel-cobalt phosphate (NCP) via a facile electrodeposition method. Due to the synergistic effect between Ni, Co, and phosphate ions, the NCP shows better redox reactions for energy storage and higher electrochemical activity than its hydroxide counterpart. When acting as a cathode, the NCP exhibits a high specific capacity of 278 mAh g(-1) at 1.52 C, impressive rate performance, and outstanding cycling stability for over 12,000 cycles. Therefore, the assembled NCP-H-2 battery based on the NCP cathode and H-2 anode shows outstanding rate performance and long-term stability. Furthermore, an integrated water splitter using the NCP as bifunctional catalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions is self-powered by the NCP-H-2 battery, showing multifunctional properties of our NCP for potential energy production and storage applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000734172800005

Here, we present a joint theoretical and experimental study that reveals the importance of distribution, concentration and ordering of interstitial boron atoms in Pd-B alloy's near-surface electronic structure and catalytic performance. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the sub-surface location of interstitial boron atoms with a Pd:B atomic ratio of 2:1 is necessary to ensure an appropriate degree of interatomic s,p-d orbital hybridization, and thereby an optimal surface electronic structure for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We experimentally achieve this with highlycrystalline intermetallic Pd2B. Due to its optimal electronic structure and ordered arrangement of interstitial boron atoms, the intermetallic Pd2B exhibits Pt-like catalytic activity for HER and has excellent catalytic stability for over seven days.									14	1	0	0	0	0	13			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000663662600002

The approach is based on the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite electrode in the presence of azide ions under the conditions of electrolysis with pulse changing of the electrode polarization potential. It was found that usage of azide anions lead not only to the exfoliation of graphite but also to the simultaneous functionalization of graphene sheets by nitrogen atoms (as a result of electrochemical decomposition of azide anions with ammonia evolution). Composition, morphology, structure, and electrochemical properties of N-MLG were characterized by C,H,N analysis, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, FTIR, UV-Vis, and Raman spectroscopy, as well as cyclic voltammetry. The perspective of using N-MLG as oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst and for the electrochemical analysis of biomarkers (dopamine, ascorbic acid, and uric acid) in their mixtures was shown.									22	1	0	0	0	0	23			1556-276X			WOS:000397600200011	28279028

While there is a general understanding of the biological elements involved in this process and their interdependence within the biological PU signaling network, this system's spatio-temporal dynamics have not yet been studied in detail. Here we first present a 0D mathematical description of the PU regulatory network consisting of two cell types - keratinocytes and neutrophils- and six chemical species - TNF alpha, KC, ROS, DAMPs, O-2 and XO. We extend this regulatory network from a set of ordinary differential equations to realistic spatial domains by coupling each species' dynamic equations to reaction diffusion partial differential equations. Furthermore, we couple this model to mechanical deformation of the spatial domain by including a pressure-sensitive oxygen perfusion term. The total model provides solutions to the regulatory network dynamics at the tissue scale with spatio-temporal detail on the evolution of each species. Among other features, the model correctly predicts patterns of PU formation in response to moderate loads, as seen clinically and experimentally. In conclusion, this work extends our current PU modeling capabilities and improves our understanding of PUs by carefully analyzing the motifs of the regulatory network and by exploring the implications of coupling this system to a tissue scale model of skin mechanics and oxygen perfusion.

The time evolution of the electron density of the air plasma is determined by electromagnetic wave absorption measurements. The measurements have uncertainties of about +/- 30%, taking into account the precision of the dose measurement and also the shot to shot fluctuations of the generator. The experimental electron density is obtained by comparing the measurements of the transmitted microwave signals to the calculated ones. The calculations need the knowledge of the time evolution of the electron mean energy, which is determined by a chemical kinetic model based on a reaction scheme involving 39 species interacting following 265 reactions. During the X-ray pulse, a good agreement is obtained between time evolution of the electron density obtained from absorption measurements and calculations based on the kinetic model. The relative deviation on the maximum electron density and the corresponding plasma frequency is always lower than 10%. The maximum electron density varies from 4 x 10(11) to 3.5 x 10(13) cm(-3) between 30 mbar to atmospheric pressure, while the peak of the electron mean energy decreases from 5.64 eV to 4.27 eV in the same pressure range.

Amphoteric Membrane Loaded with a Noble Metal-Free Hollow Spherical NiCoP@rGO Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Water Electrolyzers								ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS											10.1021/acsaem.2c01149		JUN 2022			2022	For overall water splitting and simultaneous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes in alkaline media, a bifunctional electrocatalyst loaded on both surfaces of an amphoteric ion exchange membrane (AIEM) was conceptualized to improve the efficiency. Herein, we report a partially lene))-based AIEM grafted with sulfonic acid and quaternary amine functional groups. The prepared AIEM was utilized as a substrate for the loading of the electrocatalyst (hollow spherical NiCoP@rGO) to prepare a membrane electrode assembly. The morphology-dependent bifunctional performance of the NiCoP@rGO electrocatalyst was assessed for overall water splitting (HER and OER). The prepared electrocatalyst exhibited a low potential (0.297 V for the HER and 1.57 V for the OER) at 10.00 mA/cm2 current density, corresponding to 129 and 110 mV/dec Tafel slopes, respectively. Thus, the prepared MEA exhibited better overall water splitting performance in comparison to other commercialized membrane substrates and reported electrocatalysts in the literature, at 30 degrees C under 400 mA/cm2 in alkaline medium (1.0 M KOH). A stable fluorinated polymer-based AIEM and hollow spherical NiCoP@rGO electrocatalyst provide a significant improvement in water electrolysis and simultaneous H2 and O2 production via HER and OER processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000819955700001

Herein, an advanced water reduction electrocatalyst with a two-dimensional (2D) morphology based on CoP embedded on the surface of nanocarbon (CoP@C) is fabricated, which is derived from 2D Co-MOF by low-temperature phosphorization. Benefiting from the unique 2D morphology as well as more exposed (211) facet, such electrocatalyst exhibits superior catalytic activity in both alkaline and acid media in comparison to the traditional three-dimensional (3D) structure CoP@C with the overpotentials of 127 and 236 mV for HER at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Density functional theory simulations unveil that the binding energies of the adsorbed intermediate species become more appropriate on the (211) facet compared with that on the (011) facet. This could improve the dissociation of H2O and desorption of H*, and thus facilitate the electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, the 2D electrocatalyst demonstrates enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction performance compared with its 3D counterparts. When the 2D CoP@C is employed as both the anode and cathode, a potential of 1.67 V is required to achieve the 10 mA cm(-2) current density. In addition, it still exhibits good durability and even continued to work for 50 h.									6	0	0	0	0	0	5				1466-8033		WOS:000623435900008

In this paper, amorphous nickel sulfide nanoparticles anchored on N-doped graphene nanotubes (N-GNTs@NSNs) were firstly synthesized by a facile electrochemical-deposition method, which can serve as free-standing robust supercapacitor electrode materials and electrocatalysts. Stemming from the disordered structure of amorphous active materials and the synergy of novel N-GNT framework materials, the as-prepared N-GNT@NSN electrode unveils prominent capacitive behaviors, including a large specific capacity of 240 mA h g(-1) (2160 F g(-1)), decent rate capability, and outstanding cycling stability (95.8% of capacity retention after 12 000 cycles). An asymmetric supercapacitor with N-GNTs@NSNs as the positive electrode and active carbon (AC) as the negative electrode is further assembled, which shows a maximum energy density of 49.5 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 800 W kg(-1) and robust stability (96.6% capacity retention after 12 000 cycles). Moreover, the electrode also possesses high activities in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), namely it can attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 284 mV in 1 M KOH. This finding is not only important for significantly enhancing the electrochemical performances of supercapacitor electrode materials and electrocatalysts, but also lays the solid foundation for their further industrial applications in energy storage and conversion systems.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000531408100042	32048677

To examine the reaction mechanism, we have investigated the influence of the synthesis conditions on BP, and the valence of dissolved phosphorus in the solvent after the reaction. P-0 species and P3+ like species are very likely dissolved in ED as intermediates for BP production. Optimizing the reaction conditions, i.e., temperature, the charging amount of RP in ED and the particle size of RP, BP was synthesized with high yield. The synthesized BP has an extra peak at 10.2 degrees in the X-ray diffraction pattern, which was assigned to stacking faults or periodic distortion in the direction of the c axis by simulation of diffraction. The synthesized BP with a Co-P cocatalyst showed high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution from methanol aqueous solution under visible light irradiation.									17	2	0	0	2	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526936600034

Platinum-based materials may function well as fuel cell electrodes because these can be employed as catalytic materials to carry out the infamous oxygen reduction process. In this respect, a copper-based metal-organic framework (Cu-MOF-74) was first created, to which ultralow content platinum nanoparticles (Pt/Cu-MOF-74) were added, and the structure was then studied using a variety of experimental approaches. After heating the MOF to 900 degrees C, Pt and Cu nanoparticles are incorporated into it to create a homogenized hybrid functional material, which is then pyrolyzed (Pt-Cu-PC-900). Compared to the 20% Pt/C catalyst available commercially, the Pt/Cu-PC-900 hybrid has shown superior ORR performance in terms of half-wave potential and limiting current density. This study emphasizes the value of nanoparticles with low content of Pt for potential large-scale commercial fuel cell applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2162-8769	2162-8777		WOS:000861006700001

We herein report catalysts of yolk-shell Fe3O4@C mixed with PtRu nanoparticles (Fe3O4@C-PtRu) for LOBs. This catalyst used in LOB cathodes can deliver good electrochemical performance. A large reversible capacity of 7996 mAh g(-1) cycled at 200 mA g(-1) and the restricting capacities of 1000 and 500 mAh g(-1) cycled for 21 and 32 cycles at 200 mA g(-1) can be achieved, respectively. It is suggested that the improved electrochemical performance should be derived from the effect of catalysts of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and PtRu nanoparticles coupled with hollow spherical structure from carbon shell. This work reveals that the Fe3O4@C-PtRu composite is a potential cathode catalyst for LOBs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000520021200102

Two-dimensional infrared correlation spectroscopy (2D-PCIS) was used to analyze the evolution of the functional groups of lignin in the process of low-temperature deoxidization, and the deoxidized samples were pyrolyzed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The results of 2D-PCIS showed that the decomposition of lignin was accelerated from 320 degrees C, and it was dominated by the elimination reaction. Notably, the aromatization reaction was intensified at 350 degrees C, whereas the structure of the lilac aromatic ring was more stable than the guaiac aromatic. It was also found that the alcoholic hydroxyl group was significantly removed, and because of this removal, other functional groups also underwent changes during deoxidization. The results of Py-GC/MS experiments showed that deoxidization treatment at temperatures lower than 230 degrees C had an insignificant effect on the pyrolysis products. However, when the deoxidization temperature was 230 degrees C and above, the oxygen-containing compounds in the pyrolysis liquid products (mainly phenols) decreased significantly, and when the deoxidization temperature was above 290 degrees C, hydrocarbons were the main compounds in the pyrolysis liquid product.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000526414800073

In this study, a low cost NiMnFeCu high entropy alloy was successfully synthesised using the combined techniques of mechanical milling (MA) and vacuum sintering. X-ray diffraction was used to analyse the phase composition, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterise the fabricated material's microstructure and chemical homogeneity, thermal, and mechanical properties were tested using the differential scanning calorimetry method and a universal testing machine, respectively. Electrochemical workstation was used to carry out preliminary electrochemical studies such as linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry. The results showed that the as- sintered NiMnFeCu HEA possessed a single- phase FCC structure. The HEA NiMnFeCu sintered at 1050 degrees C (S4) and 1000 degrees C (S2) with a holding time of 2 h showed a yield strength of 516.3 MPa and 389.8 MPa, respectively, and the micro-hardness values were measured to be 233.45 +/- 9 HV and 198.7 +/- 8 HV, respectively. Preliminary electrochemical studies proved that the alloy sintered at 1000 degrees C (S2) with a holding time of 2 h exhibited excellent electrocatalytic properties with a measured overpotential of 322 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) at 100 cycles of CV and good stability for 10 h when compared to state-of-the-art electrocatalytic materials <mml:semantics>IrO2</mml:semantics> and Ru<mml:semantics>O2</mml:semantics>.

Herein, we dope Ni(OH)(2) with Mn, a typical dopant, and show that Mn doping reduces the onset potential of Ni hydroxide oxidation, which favors the generation of electrochemically active (NiOOH)-O-III, and increases the electrochemical reversibility of the Ni redox pair in NiMn layered double hydroxides (LDHs). In situ Raman spectroscopy analysis provides direct spectroscopic evidence that Mn promotes the production of high-valence (NiOOH)-O-III, specifically from ca. 0.4 V vs. Hg/HgO for Ni(OH)(2) to ca. 0.3 V vs. Hg/HgO for Ni0.2Mn0.8 LDHs, i.e., a negative shift of 100 mV. The Raman spectroscopy results also reveal that Mn doping elongates the Ni-O bond in NiOOH and leads to increased phase structure disorder. Consequently, the UOR performance of Ni1-xMnx LDH surpasses that of Ni(OH)(2). This study provides important information and a clear mechanistic explanation for the crucial roles of dopants in bimetallic electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000807063800001		
J	Li, Donggang; Zhao, Can; Doherty, Andrew; Yuan, Shuang; Gong, Yanlong; Wang, Qiang					Gong, Yanlong/0000-0002-1184-9144			Nucleation and growth mechanism of dendrite-free Ni-Cu catalysts by magneto-electrodeposition for the hydrogen evolution reaction								NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				46	11			5246	5255		10.1039/d1nj05967j		FEB 2022		MAR 14 2022	2022	Developing high-efficiency electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of great importance. In this paper, dendrite-free Ni-Cu catalysts were synthesised via one-step pulse electrodeposition under a weak magnetic field (0.5 T). Regardless of the direction of the magnetic field, the ions were affected by the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect, which greatly promoted the mass transfer and dispersion uniformity, and suppressed the uncontrollable agglomeration by electrodeposition. It was found that the nucleation mechanism changed from progressive nucleation under a 0 T magnetic field to instantaneous nucleation under a 0.5 T magnetic field. Large-scale (325 nm, 0 T) dendrite growth on the single-sided plane was successfully suppressed, and replaced by smaller (90 nm, 0.5 T) and uniformly distributed cluster growth around the carbon paper. In addition, the (111) plane was strengthened by the magnetic field. Electrochemical analysis showed that the Ni-Cu catalysts exposed more surface area and exhibited greatly enhanced catalytic activity, which only needed -57.3 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 99.4 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. Overall, magneto-electrodeposition, especially under weak magnetic field conditions, provides great promise for the preparation of HER catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000761764900001

Herein, hierarchical 4H/face-centered cubic (fcc) Ru nanotubes (NTs) are synthesized by a hard template-mediated method, in which 4H/fcc Au nanowires (NWs) serve as sacrificial templates which are then etched by copper ions (Cu2+) in dimethylformamide. The obtained hierarchical 4H/fcc Ru NTs contain ultrathin Ru shells (5-9 atomic layers) and tiny Ru nanorods with length of 4.2 +/- 1.1 nm and diameter of 2.2 +/- 0.5 nm vertically decorated on the surface of Ru shells. As an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media, the hierarchical 4H/fcc Ru NTs exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance, which is better than 4H/fcc Au-Ru NWs, commercial Pt/C, Ru/C, and most of the reported electrocatalysts.									62	6	0	0	1	0	62			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000439935800010	29956483	
J	Zhang, Jiaxing; Wei, Aixiang; Liu, Jun; Zhu, Jiali; He, Yuding; Liu, Zhen								3D self-supporting nickel sponge substrate derived CoFeLDH/SN as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				927						166990	10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.166990				DEC 15 2022	2022	The design and fabrication of high-efficiency and low-cost bifunctional catalysts in overall water splitting is crucial for the industrial application of green and clean hydrogen energy. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) self-supporting nickel sponge (SN) with many nickel synapses prepared by hydrothermal method was employed as the substrate. 2D CoFeLDH nanosheets were grown on nano-Ni synapses of SN by electro-deposition method. For comparison, CoFeLDH also was deposited on a nickel foam (NF) substrate using the same deposition process. The as-prepared CoFeLDH/SN exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performances with 208 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and 63 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in 1 M KOH alkaline solution, which is better than that of CoFeLDH/NF (276 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, and 173 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER). The electrolytic cell using CoFeLDH/SN as both cathode and anode achieves a voltage of 1.52 V at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is better than that of most previously reported bifunctional catalysts. Our work provides a facile and inexpensive option for the design of bifunctional catalysts in overall water splitting. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, using a simple hydrothermal and sulfidation annealing method, nanoflower-like Mn-NiS with regular morphology was grown in situ on the surface of nickel foam. Through the detailed analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results, it is found that the successful doping of Mn2+ can effectively adjust the electronic structure of NiS. As we envisioned, the prepared Mn-NiS shows only 99 mV overpotential and 64.8 mV dec(-1) Tafel slope in HER at 10 mA cm(-2) and has only 320 mV and 65.5 mV dec(-1) in OER at 50 mA cm(-2). In addition, the alkaline electrolytic cell composed of Mn-NiS double electrodes has a cell-voltage of only 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2), and maintains good stability. More importantly, the results of density functional theory calculations show that after M2+ successfully changes the electronic structure on the NiS surface, it not only promotes the HER kinetics, but also greatly increases the OER activity.

It was found that the naturally occurring calcium surface species represented highly dispersed carbonate-like forms. Before gasification, they represented aragonite-like species. However, on steam gasification, they readily underwent solid-phase polymorphic transition into a calcite-like form. The main proportion of the surface carbon atoms (68-71%) on all the chars represented sp(2)-hybridized carbons in the graphene fragments, while the remaining 29-32% accounted for as oxidized carbon species of different configurations. Mainly, sp(2)-hybridized carbon atoms were found to be sensitive to activation by a calcium catalyst. The conclusion was drawn that these were highly dispersed calcite-like surface species derived from the aragonite-like ones under steam gasification reaction, which could be responsible for the catalytic activation of sp(2)-hybridized carbon atoms and for the char gasification reactivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000462260600021

In this study, unique one-dimensional (1D) multi-node MoS2/CdS hetero-nanowires (NWs) for efficient visible-light photocatalytic H-2 evolution are synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. Flower-like sheaths are assembled from numerous defect-rich O-incorporated {0001} MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets (NSs), and {1120}-facet surrounded CdS NW stems are grown preferentially along the c-axis. Interestingly, the defects in the MoS2 NSs provide additional active S atoms on the exposed edge sites, and the incorporation of O reduces the energy barrier for H-2 evolution and increases the electric conductivity of the MoS2 NSs. Moreover, the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers is significantly inhibited by the heterojunction formed between the MoS2 NSs and CdS NWs. Therefore, in the absence of noble metals as co-catalysts, the 1D MoS2 NS/CdS NW hybrids exhibit an excellent H-2-generation rate of 10.85 mmol.g(-1).h(-1) and a quantum yield of 22.0% at. = 475 nm, which is far better than those of Pt/CdS NWs, pure MoS2 NSs, and CdS NWs as well as their physical mixtures. Our results contribute to the rational construction of highly reactive nanostructures for various catalytic applications.									83	7	0	0	7	0	84			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000398382300025

J	Yang, Haidong; Long, Yu; Zhu, Yan; Zhao, Ziming; Ma, Ping; Jin, Jun; Ma, Jiantai								Crystal lattice distortion in ultrathin Co(OH)(2) nanosheets inducing elongated Co-O-OH bonds for highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction								GREEN CHEMISTRY				19	24			5809	5817		10.1039/c7gc02543b				DEC 21 2017	2017	The exploration of highly efficient nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great importance for potential applications in sustainable energy conversion. Recently, the layered metal hydroxide (LMH) family is receiving extensive research attention owing to its unique structural properties. However, the gained electrocatalytic performance of LMH-based catalysts for the OER is still far from the state-of-the-art requirements because of its finite number and poor reactivity of exposed active sites. In response, we synthesized crystal lattice distorted ultrathin cobalt hydroxide (denoted as CLD-u-Co(OH)(2)) nanosheets with a great number of efficient catalytic active sites through the introduction of Ga into ultrathin Co(OH)(2), followed by a selective removal of Ga, denoted as the "introduction @ removal" process. As a result, the crystal lattice distortion confined inside CLD-u-Co(OH)(2) generates abundant elongated Co-O-OH bonds on exposed (1 (2) over bar0) facets serving as efficient catalytic active sites for the OER. Besides, the optimized amount of "introduction @ removal" of Ga (4 at%) allows for an exquisite balance between distortion engineering and electrical conductivity, synergistically. The asprepared CLD-u-Co(OH)(2) achieves an overpotential of 265 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), an unexpectedly small Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1), and a long-term stability (beyond 20 h) in basic media. It is mainly attributed to abundant catalytic active sites, robust reactivity per site, and good electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the green and sustainable engineering of crystal lattice distortion to improve the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of CLD-u-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets presented in this work may provide a promising strategy to design and synthesize newly highly efficient LMH-based electrocatalysts for the OER.									32	1	0	0	0	0	32			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000417756500010

While these coatings passivate surface defects, transport photogenerated holes, protect against corrosion, and aid catalysis, their optimal composition changes with operating pH, thus affecting overall performance. We use high-throughput photoelectrochemistry methods to map photoanode performance to enable the discovery of optimal composition and loading of Ce-rich sputter-deposited (Fe-Ce)O-x overlayers on undoped BiVO4 in pH 9 borate buffer electrolyte. The optimal composition is found to be 20% Fe and 80% Ce with an optimal Fe + Ce metal loading of 0.9 nmol mm(-2). Analysis of the composition and loading dependence of (i) the photocurrent transients upon illumination toggling, (ii) stabilized photocurrent densities, and (iii) photogenerated hole-transfer efficiency reveals the confluence of phenomena that gives rise to the optimal performance yielding nearly perfect transfer efficiency over a narrow composition window.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			2574-0962			WOS:000458706600072

Ru-based nanocatalysts are still the best catalytic system for the OER; however, one of the greatest challenges is their relatively poor stability for the OER. Here, we report a novel architecture of ultrathin RuRh@(RuRh)O(2)core/shell nanosheets with a core of ultrathin metallic RuRh nanosheets and a shell of RuO2/RhO(2)oxides as superb electrocatalysts toward the OER. The RuRh@(RuRh)O(2)core/shell nanosheets can achieve a high electrocatalytic activity toward the OER, with a low 245 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2)and a Tafel slope of 51.2 mV dec(-1), better than most state-of-the-art Ru-based or Ir-based electrocatalysts for the OER. Moreover, the RuO2/RhO(2)oxides shell protect the normally labile RuRh NSs core against dissolution during the OER process, revealed by detailed rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) measurements for simultaneously recording the dissolution of Ru on the ring electrode and theex situmeasurement of Ru dissolution using the galvanostatic method. Therefore, the RuRh@(RuRh)O(2)core/shell nanosheets exhibit much better OER stability in acid media compared with RuRh nanosheets and commercial RuO2. Theoretical calculations reveal that once the formation of the surface oxidation layers is achieved, the O-sites evidentially crossover the Fermi level which could guarantee the high electroactivity towards adsorbates while the RuRh core serves as an electron reservoir with high electrical conductivity. The synergistic effect between the core and shell structure leads to the superior OER performance.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000560225400028

This film generally blocks further polymerization. The objective of this study is to show that, depending on the operating conditions, polymeric films resulting from phenol oxidation present different properties and that certain films can be so porous that they allow the oxidation of phenol to continue. The deposition of polyphenol films with improved permeability could be attractive in the removal of phenol from polluted solutions. Polyphenol films were prepared in aqueous solution on a vitreous carbon anode either by cyclic voltammetry or by electro-oxidation at constant potential. The apparent permeability P (%) of the films prepared by these techniques was evaluated by monitoring changes in the electrode response towards phenol and potassium ferricyanide at 25 and 85 A degrees C and as a function of the potential applied during electropolymerization performed either in acidic (1 mol L-1 H2SO4) or in alkaline (1 mol L-1 NaOH) aqueous solution. It was shown that: (1) the polyphenol film electrosynthesized in alkaline medium was more permeable than that prepared in acidic medium, (2) the apparent permeability was higher when the polyphenol film was electrosynthesized with simultaneous oxygen evolution and (3) the use of a high temperature in the polyphenol film preparation, especially in the presence of a concomitant oxygen evolution, significantly enhanced its apparent permeability (P a parts per thousand yen 100 %). These results are interpreted in terms of a mixed-transport mechanism involving both pore and membrane diffusion. The effect of the permeability of the polymeric film on the removal of phenol from aqueous solution by electropolymerization is discussed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0021-891X			WOS:000318898300005

The stability of these clusters are confirmed by the obtained positive binding energies, the change in the free energy, and frequencies, also they can be grown on different substrates such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. They have energy gaps ranging from 2.1 to 3 eV that can be controlled by adsorption of different gases or molecules, for instance, adsorption of C2 decreases the gap in Sb18-a cluster from 2.7 eV to 0.8 eV. These clusters show also interesting adsorption properties where some gases are physically adsorbed (like, N2 and CH4) while others are chemically adsorbed (O2 and SO2). In the first case, the linear N2 molecule has a strong triple bond, from the sp-hybridization, that can't be broken through the interaction with the clusters, the same occurs also for the sp3-hybridized CH4 with the strong sigma bonds. For the sp2-hybridized O2 molecule, one of the relatively weaker double bond can be broken through the interaction to form another with the cluster. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the edges of these clusters requires lower overpotential than their surfaces due to the moderate adsorption of O by one edge atom with respect to the strong adsorption by two surface atoms. Nanoclusters and quantum dots of Sb provide the best values for the overpotential due to moderate bonding that Sb atoms form with all intermediates not only O, namely overpotentials equal 0.31 and 0.39 V for the nanocluster and the quantum dots, respectively. This significant enhancement of the OER activity makes such clusters strong applicants for water oxidation catalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000662248000009

Because of their regular porosity in microporous or mesoporous scale and periodic intra-framework functionality, three-dimensional array of high-density and well-separated active sites can be built in various MOFs; such characteristics render MOFs attractive porous supports for a range of catalytic applications. Furthermore, the electrochemically addressable thin films of such MOF materials are reasonably considered as attractive candidates for electrocatalysis and relevant applications. Although it still constitutes an emerging subfield, the use of MOFs and relevant materials for electrocatalytic applications has attracted much attention in recent years. In this review, we aim to focus on the limitations and commonly seen issues for utilizing MOFs in electrocatalysis and the strategies to overcome these challenges.

Samples of europium tellurium oxide, prepared through the employment of a Pechini sol-gel route and calcined at 400 and 900 degrees C, were characterized for selective physicochemical properties and comparatively evaluated as an electrocatalyst, photoelectrocatalyst, and photocharged electrocatalyst by employing, as a suitable case study, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. The sample calcined at 400 degrees C exhibited amorphous characteristics while the sample calcined at 900 degrees C proved to be Eu2TeO6. The evaluation was conducted in a modified electrochemical cell housing a lamp, with the material deposited onto a glassy carbon electrode support rather than on fluorine- or indium-doped tin oxide glass plates. With a band gap of 4.31 eV, Eu2TeO6 (calcined at 900 degrees C) exhibited improved OER activity upon continuous UV-light irradiation, with the unexpected result of sustained improved activity for up to 40 min subsequent to the termination of the UV irradiation. At 1.8 V (versus RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode), the photocurrent, after 150 min of irradiation, increased by 107% from 0.44 to 0.91 mA cm(-2). Surprisingly, after 150 min of irradiation, the dark current was sustained at 0.86 mA cm(-2) for 40 min (at which point measurement was terminated), which represents a sustained increase of 95% compared to the initial unirradiated sample. The phenomenon observed here could contribute toward an improved understanding of photocharging and ultimately to the exploitation of more efficient solar energy conversion and storage.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000473116600032

In this work, a simplistic one-pot fabrication of nitrogen/sulfur co-doped MoO2@C nanorods is synthesized to enhance the electrochemical HER over MoO2@C nanorods. The resultant MoO2@SN-C nanorods consist of MoO2 which is evenly distributed on the rods. Well-controlled experimental fabrication suggests that, the additive amount of sulfanilamide and fumaric acid can resourcefully ease the synthesis of the nanorods and enhanced the electrochemical performance of the fabricated MoO2@SN-C catalysts. These outstanding nitrogen/sulfur co-doped MoO2@C nanorods predicts numerous compensations for electrocatalytic applications and beyond: (1) nitrogen/sulfur co-doped can avert the aggregation of MoO2 nanorods and enhance its high electronic conductivity; (2) the well-dispersed uniformity of MoO2@C nanorods supply plentiful active sites; (3) the enriched crystallinity and active surfaces render active sites and promotes mass electron transfer. Due to these properties, nitrogen/sulfur co-doped MoO2@C nanorods pyrolyzed at the temperature of 825 degrees C delivers an excellent HER performance with a small overpotential of 83 mV and a small Tafel slope of 78 mV dec(-1) in alkaline medium. This study unlocks a novel study-point for the expansion and development of an efficient Mo-based electrocatalysts.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000582798700082		
J	Zhao, Tuo; Luo, Ergui; Li, Yang; Wang, Xian; Liu, Changpeng; Xing, Wei; Ge, Junjie								Highly dispersed L1(0)-PtZn intermetallic catalyst for efficient oxygen reduction								SCIENCE CHINA-MATERIALS				64	7			1671	1678		10.1007/s40843-020-1582-3		JAN 2021		JUL 2021	2021	Highly active and durable electrocatalysts with minimal Pt usage are desired for commercial fuel cell applications. Herein, we present a highly dispersed L1(0)-PtZn intermetallic catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), in which a Zn-rich metal-organic framework (MOF) is used as an in situ generated support to confine the growth of PtZn particles. Despite requiring high-temperature treatment, the intermetallic L1(0)-PtZn particles exhibit a small mean size of 3.95 nm, which confers the catalysts with high electrochemical active surface area (81.9 m(2) g(Pt)(-1)) and atomic utilization. The Pt electron structure and binding strength between Pt and oxygen intermediates are optimized through ligand effect and compressive strain. These advantages result in ORR mass activity and specific activity of 0.926 A mg(Pt)(-1) and 1.13 mA cm(-2), respectively, which are 5.4 and 4.0 times those of commercial Pt/C. The stable L1(0) structure provides the catalysts with superb durability; only a halfwave potential loss of 11 mV is observed after 30,000 cycles of accelerated stress tests, through which the structure evolves into a more stable PtZn-Pt core-shell structure. Therefore, the development of a Zn based MOF as a catalyst support is demonstrated, providing a synergy strategy to prepare highly dispersed intermetallic alloys with high activity and durability.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000609978900001

However, going beyond state-of-the-art catalysts remains a great challenge. Recently, nanostructured composites of conductive carbons and earth-abundant metals have emerged as promising electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a facile and practical approach for the synthesis of cobalt nanoparticles embedded into hollow nitrogen/cobalt-doped porous carbon capsules (Co@NPCC). The fabrication of this material was achieved via the thermal decomposition of sacrificial metal-organic framework nanocrystals coated with a metal-tannic acid coordination polymer shell, upon pyrolysis, which delivers zerovalent cobalt nanoparticles embedded in the walls of hollow capsules. Co@NPCC proved to be a superb catalyst for the electrochemical ORR, showing a highly positive onset potential (approximate to 1.02 V vs. RHE) and current density (approximate to 5.2 mA cm(-2)) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. These values are in excellent agreement with those reported for the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. Significantly, materials produced via this approach can be manufactured on a large scale, thereby providing access to next-generation catalysts for important electrochemical processes.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000448338700014

The oxygen-evolving complex is buried deep in the protein on the lumenal side of PSII, and water molecules need to pass through protein subunits to reach the active site-the manganese cluster. Previous studies on the elucidation of water channels in PSII were based on an analysis of the cavities in the static PSII structure determined by X-ray diffraction. In the present study, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of the water movement in the transport system of PSII.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			1063-7745	1562-689X		WOS:000348301700014

In the course of evolution, nature optimized numerous mechanisms to use glutathione as the most versatile nucleophile for the conversion of a plethora of sulfur-, oxygen- or carbon-containing electrophilic substances.Scope of review: This comprehensive review summarizes fundamental principles of glutathione catalysis and compares the structures and mechanisms of glutathione-dependent enzymes, including glutathione reductase, glutaredoxins, glutathione peroxidases, peroxiredoxins, glyoxalases 1 and 2, glutathione transferases and MAPEG. Moreover, open mechanistic questions, evolutionary aspects and the physiological relevance of glutathione catalysis are discussed for each enzyme family.Major conclusions: It is surprising how little is known about many glutathione-dependent enzymes, how often reaction geometries and acid-base catalysts are neglected, and how many mechanistic puzzles remain unsolved despite almost a century of research. On the one hand, several enzyme families with non-related protein folds recognize the glutathione moiety of their substrates. On the other hand, the thioredoxin fold is often used for glutathione catalysis. Ancient as well as recent structural changes of this fold did not only significantly alter the reaction mechanism, but also resulted in completely different protein functions.General significance: Glutathione-dependent enzymes are excellent study objects for structure-function relationships and molecular evolution. Notably, in times of systems biology, the outcome of models on glutathione metabolism and redox regulation is more than questionable as long as fundamental enzyme properties are neither studied nor understood. Furthermore, several of the presented mechanisms could have implications for drug development. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Cellular functions of glutathione.

For successful application in fuel cells (FCs), however, also high durability and longevity must be demonstrated. Currently, a limited understanding of degradation pathways, especially under operando conditions, hinders the design and synthesis of simultaneously active and stable Fe-N-C electrocatalysts. In this work, using a gas diffusion electrode half-cell coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry setup, Fe dissolution is studied under conditions close to those in FCs, that is, with a porous catalyst layer (CL) and at current densities up to -125 mA.cm(-2). Varying the rate of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), we show a remarkable linear correlation between the Faradaic charge passed through the electrode and the amount of Fe dissolved from the electrode. This finding is rationalized assuming that oxygen reduction and Fe dissolution reactions are interlinked, likely through a common intermediate formed during the Fe redox transitions in Fe species involved in the ORR, such as FeNxCy and Fe3C@N-C. Moreover, such a linear correlation allows the application of a simple metric-S-number-to report the material's stability. Hence, in the current work, a powerful tool for a more applied stability screening of different electrocatalysts is introduced, which allows on the one hand fast performance investigations under more realistic conditions, and on the other hand a more advanced mechanistic understanding of Fe-N-C degradation in CLs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000810001000001	35609284

The results showed that HT significantly increased the production of O-2(center dot-) arid H2O2 compared with CK (25 degrees C). Particularly, the oxidative damage of RNAi plants was significantly greater than that of wild type (WT) under HT + HL treatment, possibly due to the inhibition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities. HT treatment inhibited the photosystem II (PSII) activity, and the oxygen evolution complex (OEC) was the main injury site. Notably, the photosystem I (PSI) activity of WT and RNAi plants did not change significantly under HT + LL treatment compared with CK. Although the PSI activity of WT and RNAi plants decreased significantly under HT + HL treatment, there was no significant difference between WT and RNAi plants. Collectively, these findings indicate that high light increases the photoinhibition of PSII and PSI and oxidative damage under high-temperature stress. The results also revealed that 2-Cys Prx plays a crucial role in alleviating oxidative damage arid PSII photoinhibition under high-temperature stress in tobacco.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-9145	1742-9153		WOS:000839937400001

In this paper, we report the time evolution of oxygen partial pressure in a cylindrical horizontal furnace. The measurements have been carried out by means of the oxidation of nickel microparticles. The time that oxygen needs to reach the sample's position has been measured as a function of the furnace temperature and of gas flow rate. The values of time delay are shorter than expected at low flow rates due to gas interdiffusion, whereas are higher than expected at high flow rates due to partial thermalisation of gas. Gas interdiffusion has been computed by solving the mass transport equation in one dimension and selecting a suitable boundary condition at the end of the furnace. This boundary condition takes into account the abrupt reduction of section when gas flows through the exhausting hose. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Effect of Addition of Sulphide Ions on the Electrochemical Behaviour and Corrosion of Cu-Ag Alloys in Alkaline Solutions								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE				1	1			17	31						MAY 2006	2006	The electrochemical behaviour of copper-silver alloys was studied in 0.5 M NaOH containing sulphide ions using cyclic voltammetric and potentiodynamic anodic polarization techniques between the hydrogen and the oxygen evolution reactions under the effect of different variables such as reversal potential, scan rate, sulphide ion concentration, temperature and number of repeated cycles. The anodic sweep of potential was characterized by the appearance of three potential regions: sulphide attack potential region, copper dissolution potential region and silver dissolution potential region, prior to the oxygen evolution reaction. The first potential region was characterized by the appearance of three anodic peaks A(1), A(2) and A(3), which were related to the formation of Cu(x)S, Ag(2)S and sulphur on the electrode surface. The formation of CuxS and Ag(2)S was associated with the formation of pits on the electrode surface. Scanning electron microscope was used to examine the electrode surface for pitting corrosion. In the copper dissolution potential region, copper dissolved selectively that was associated with the appearance of three anodic peaks A(4), A(5) and A(6), which are related to the formation of Cu(2)O, Cu(OH)(2) and CuO, respectively. In the third potential region, silver dissolves, which was associated with the appearance of two anodic peaks A(8) and A(9), which were related to the formation of Ag(2)O and both of Ag(2)O(2) and soluble SO(4)(2-) compounds, respectively. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the existence of Ag(2)S, Cu(x)S, Ag(2)O and CuO on alloy I potentiodynamically polarized to 400 mV.

The simulation results show that a ring-type zone is formed around the cavity where the coke combustion and gasification occur with a large amount of heat released, leading to intense momentum and thermochemical exchanges in this zone. Heat fluxes contributed from radiation and reaction dominate total heat transfer during the coke combustion, while conductive heat transfer is insignificant. Then, the impacts of key operating parameters on raceway evolution are quantified. The simulation results indicate increasing the blast gas velocity from 210 m/s to 230 m/s and oxygen mass fraction from 0.17 to 0.27, the cavity depth is increased by 42.3% and 20.8%, respectively; lower inlet velocity, higher bed temperature, higher oxygen mass fraction leads to more CO production and the resulting better BF performance.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000675742600005

The remarkable synergistic therapy and excellent hypoxia releasing capabilities can remove both subcutaneous and sentinel lymph nodes metastasis tumors, and effectively suppress tumor recurrence and lung metastasis, thus greatly prolonging survival time.

Here, non-noble-metal graphene-like carbon nanosheets with trapped Fe species (Fe-N/GPC) are developed by an iron-salt thermally emitted strategy, which integrates the modulation of the electronic structure for boosted intrinsic activity with the engineering of hierarchical porosity for enriched active sites. The ORR electrocatalytic performance of Fe-N/GPC-800 achieves the half-wave potentials of 0.86 and 0.77 V with limiting current densities of 6.1 and 4.7 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH and 0.1 M PBS solutions, respectively, as well as respectable stability. Furthermore, Fe-N/GPC-800 also shows considerable ORR catalytic activity in acid media accompanied by stability superior to those of Pt/C catalysts. The as-prepared Fe-N/GPC-800, as a cathodic catalyst, is assessed in a Zn-air battery test and delivers an open-circuit voltage of 1.44 V with a power density of 134 mW cm(-2) as well as the outstanding durability after 350 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2), demonstrating appreciable promise in application of metal-air batteries.

Consecutive electrolysis using Ni electrodes showed that these modestly reduced the chemical oxygen demand (COD) from the wastewater (12.3 +/- 1.61 % and 12.7 +/- 0.88 % removal for the raw (RW) and digested (DW) wastewater, respectively). On the other hand, graphite anodes achieved degradations of 37.0 +/- 1.97 % and 25.5 +/- 2.95 % COD removal for RW and DW. The results were confirmed by fitting a pseudo-first-order model and suggest different oxidation mechanisms at the two electrodes. Meanwhile, Fourier-transform infrared spectra demonstrated that biological pretreatment affected the bioavailability of aliphatic compounds, such as saccharides, peptides, and fats, while thermogravimetric analysis reflected the degree of biological stabilization of both swine solutions. These findings indicate that SW offers high potential as an electrolyte solution to following this new electrochemical approach to the valorization of SW.									3	0	0	0	0	1	4			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000697581500005		
J	Cheng, Lanzi; Zhang, Rui; Lv, Weixin; Shao, Luyu; Wang, Zheng; Wang, Wei								Surface Phosphation of 3D NiCo2O4 Nanowires Grown on Ni Foam as an Efficient Bifunctional Catalyst for Water Splitting								NANO				15	03			111	122						2020	2020	Highly efficient, cost-effective and durable electrocatalysts for water splitting are crucial for energy conversion and storage. Transition-metal phosphides have been proven to be efficient catalysts for water splitting. In this paper, surface phosphation of 3D NiCo2O4 nanowires grown on Ni foam (P-NiCo2O4/NF) have been prepared to investigate the effect of surface phosphating on catalyst activity. XRD and XPS results demonstrate that P element has been decorated on the surface of the NiCo2O4 nanowires. The electrochemical results prove that P-NiCo2O4/NF shows better electrochemical performance than pure NiCo2O4/NF as an electrode for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of water splitting. It achieves a current density of 10 mA cm2 at an overpotential of 279 mV and 164 mV for OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. In addition, the P-NiCo2O4/NF || P-NiCo2O4/NF electrode is constructed by employing P-NiCo2O4/NF as both the anode and cathode, it only requires a low 1.68 V of cell voltage to reach the current density of 10 mA cm -2. Notably, P-NiCo2O4/NF||P-NiCo2O4/NF also exhibits excellent stability for over 30 h-long. These results indicate that surface phosphation is an effective approach to improve the electrochemical performance of NiCo2O4/NF electrode materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1793-2920			KJD:ART002566209		
J	Erakulan, E. S.; Thapa, Ranjit								Origin of pure and C doped borophene stability and its activity for OER								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				574						151613	10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151613		OCT 2021		FEB 1 2022	2022	In borophene, vacancy is a major reason for stability. However, a detailed understanding relating to vacancy and electronic property remains unexplored. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) the effect of vacancy and doping on stability, electronic and catalytic properties of borophene is addressed in this work. It is shown how vacancy increases sigma-electrons and decreases n-electrons of the neighboring boron atoms with the magnitude decreasing from 4 to 6-coordinated atoms, thereby contributing to their stability. The role of single and dual carbon doping on sigma- and n-occupancy is explored. In addition, we have shown that dual carbon doping on beta 12-borophene analogue reduces the overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We observed that the charge deficient boron atom helps in the reduction of oxygen binding and can decrease the overpotential towards OER. Overall, this work would help in fundamental understanding towards borophene stability and aid in choosing the suitable dopant for catalytic applications considering the stability.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000726809700005

Oxygen activation by high-valent transition metal ions in native and artificial systems								POLYHEDRON				66		SI		228	244		10.1016/j.poly.2013.05.001				DEC 13 2013	2013	Activation mechanisms of oxygen dianion and hydroxide by high-valent transition metal ions for the oxygen-oxygen (O-O) bond formation of water splitting reaction have been investigated on the theoretical grounds, together with experimental results. First of all, broken-symmetry MO formulations are revisited to elucidate the instability of the d pi-p pi bond in high-valent metal-oxo M(X)=O (M = Mn, Fe, Ru, etc.; X = IV, V) systems that react with hydroxide anion (or radical) or water to afford hydroperoxide anion (or peroxide). The triplet instability of these bonds entails strong or intermediate diradical characters: center dot M(X-1)=O center dot and center dot center dot M(X-2)=O center dot center dot; the broken-symmetry (BS) molecular orbitals (MO) resulted from strong electron correlation, leading to the concept of electron localizations and local spins. As a continuation of these theoretical results, the BS MO interaction diagrams, namely orbital and spin correlation diagrams, for one-electron and electron-pair transfer mechanisms for the O-O bond formation have been depicted to reveal scope and applicability of local singlet diradical (LSD) and local triplet diradical (LTD) mechanisms that have been successfully utilized for theoretical understanding of mechanisms of oxygenation reactions by p450, methane mono- oxygenase (MMO) and homolytic radical coupling mechanisms by oxygen evolving complex (OEC) of PSII. The spin alignments in high-valent M(X)=O systems are found directly corresponding to possible mechanisms of the O-O bond formation between Mn(X)=O and hydroxide (OH) anion via one-electron, electron-pair transfer and their superposed (chameleon) processes. The broken-symmetry (BS) UB3LYP calculations of the model systems have been performed to confirm these mechanisms for oxygen evolution; charge and spin densities by BS UB3LYP are utilized for elucidation and confirmation of the LSD and LTD mechanisms and orbital and spin correlation diagrams. Implications of the theoretical results are discussed in relation to three scenarios of the O-O bond formation for water oxidation: (a) HO-OH, (b) OOH and (c) O-O, and water oxidation of OEC of PSII.

Vibrating Powders: Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance Study of IrO2 and Pt/C Catalyst Layers for Voltage Reversal Tolerant Anodes in Fuel Cells								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				123	38			23361	23373		10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b05652				SEP 26 2019	2019	A fundamental understanding of the interaction between Pt and IrO2 catalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) anodes is important to mitigate degradation during cell voltage reversal events by catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) instead of carbon corrosion and Pt dissolution. The potential-dependent mass changes of untreated and different heat-treated (350, 450, and 550 degrees C) IrO2 and IrO2 + Pt/C powders were investigated in a simulated PEMFC environment by using the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) technique. During successive potential cycling the frequency changes associated with IrO2 were correlated to the potential-dependent uptake of water and formation of iridium oxyhydroxide species, confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Heat treatment of the IrO2 powders increased crystallinity, which triggered changes in the frequency response during accelerated cyclic voltammetry stress tests. During anodic polarization, the untreated IrO2 exhibited a steady increase in frequency beginning at ca. 0.6 V vs RHE, whereas the heat-treated IrO2 first revealed a frequency decrease and then leveled off before increasing. These observations were explained based on differences in potential-dependent water uptake and Ir oxyhydroxide formation as a function of IrO2 structural variations from amorphous to crystalline and Ir3+/4+ ratio. Pt/C alone when subjected to potential hold at 1.8 and 2.0 V vs RHE experienced significant mass decrease due mainly to carbon corrosion. The addition of IrO2 to Pt/C in the catalyst layer did not show any mass decrease during the same potential hold. The OER catalyzed by IrO2 protected Pt/C from degradation (i.e., carbon corrosion and Pt dissolution) at high potentials and created an ex situ voltage reversal tolerant anode.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000488334700009

Thermal denaturation of the native triple helices into single chains is initiated above 135-degrees-C and is complete in 10 min at 160-degrees-C. Both conformations can coexist in the 130-140-degrees-C temperature range. In the presence of oxygen, both forms of the biopolymer undergo severe thermal degradation. The rate of degradation was found to be independent of chain length and conformation. An activation energy of 104 kJ mol-1 was determined. The reaction was base-catalyzed. Analysis of chromatographic patterns indicate that the degradation probably occurs through an 'all-or-none' process.									30	1	0	0	20	0	31			0144-8617			WOS:A1992HA94100005

A water content of 47.2 wt.% for the dewatered sludge cake was achieved at an applied voltage of 20 V for 30 min, which was significantly lower than previously reported results. The capillary suction time (CST) and specific resistance to filtration (SRF) were decreased by 75.6% and 90.9%, respectively. Four simultaneous processes, including electrooxidation, the electro-Fenton process, molecular oxygen activation via zero valent iron (ZVI) and Fe(III) flocculation, had synergetic effects on the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to enhance sludge dewaterability. The in situ generation of ZVI on the cathode electrode facilitated the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) via activation of molecular oxygen. The sludge pH decreased spontaneously and remained acidic due to the competitive reaction of ZVI generation to hydrogen evolution as well as the Fe(III) flocculation process, which further guaranteed the high efficiency of hydroxyl radical generation. Changes in the physiochemical properties of the sludge (particle size distribution, zeta potential, viscosity and EPS characteristics) induced by the hybrid conditioning process were further explored. In addition, the economic potential of the hybrid system was preliminarily assessed (USD$ 127.6/ton dry sludge). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The obtained nanoarchitecture delivers overpotentials at 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 82.1 and 113.4 mV and 40.8 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4, and of 97.1 and 136.6 mV and 51.2 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, all of which are superior to those of the most reported non-noble-metal-based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts. This catalyst even surpasses commercial Pt/C for a much lower overpotential at high current densities, which is essential for large-scale hydrogen production. Its catalytic activity can be further optimized to become one of the best in both 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH. The outstanding catalytic activity is ascribed to the uniformly-dispersed small CoP NPs in the 3D carbon sheets and the hierarchical nanostructure with rich oriented pores. This work develops a facile, economical, and universal self-assembly strategy to fabricate uniquely nanostructured hybrids to simultaneously promote charge transfer and mass transport, and also offers an inexpensive and high-performance HER catalyst toward industry-scale water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000726526100001	34870367

Morphological and phase characterizations were performed by SEM, TEM and XRD techniques, respectively, and revealed the electrodeposition of manganese oxide in nanorod morphology with a highly crystalline nature (gamma-MnOOH). A significant enhancement of methanol oxidation has been observed at the nano-MnOOH/Pt electrodes as evident from the increase of the oxidation peak current (I-p). The enhancement factor and Ip for methanol electro-oxidation depends on the surface coverage of MnOOH indicating its essential role in the oxidation process of methanol with an optimum surface coverage of ca. 30% under the present experimental conditions. The MnOOH nanorods are believed to act as a catalytic mediator that enhances the electro-oxidation of methanol by facilitating the oxygen supply through a reversible redox system of Mn(III)/(IV) oxides.									28	2	0	0	2	1	29			1452-3981			WOS:000272246700010

With increasing frequency from 13.54 to 108.48 MHz at a constant power density of 40 W cm(-3), the space-averaged electron density is found to increase by 35% but this is accompanied by marked decrease in the sheath thickness, the maximum electron temperature, and the electric field in the sheath by 76%, 46% and four-folds, respectively. As a result, plasma species generated via reactions with low threshold electron energy (e.g. O-2*) experience more abundant production and those generated by energetic electrons (e.g. O and O*) undergo a reduction in their number densities as the driving frequency increases. These frequency dependences directly regulate power dissipation in species produced directly by electrons, ROS concentrations, and ultimately plasma chemistry. Delivery of ROS is shown to be effective only from a boundary layer immediately above a sample surface, due to severely compromised diffusion and drift at atmospheric pressure, introducing a further frequency-dependent factor. In general, the increase of the driving frequency affects energetic and low-energy electrons differently and the contrast in frequency effects of different ROS is desirable for manipulating plasma chemistry as experienced by the sample.									23	1	0	0	0	0	24			0022-3727			WOS:000325207800004

Samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and iodometric titration techniques. Results indicate that a full development of the superconducting phase only occurs after pressing sintering and annealing under oxygen of the powders treated at T-f=1253 K for 8 h. The structural evolution observed in this case involves a solid-state reaction between La1.67Sr0.33Cu2O5-delta, La(OH)3 and CuO. The existence of transient liquid phase at temperatures around 600 K generates local composition fluctations (lanthanum deficiency) where the non-superconducting ternary compound La1.67Sr0.33Cu2O5-delta develops. The selection of high heating rates (50 K min(-1)) below 773 K minimizes the deleterious effect of transient melting and, at the same time, ensures a high reproducibility in the morphology of the final material obtained.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0022-2461			WOS:A1995QT26300013

Here, we present a joint computational/experimental study that shows both structural polymorphs of earth-abundant cobalt diselenide (orthorhombic o-CoSe2 and cubic c-CoSe2) are stable against surface oxidation and catalyst leaching due to the weak O* binding to Se sites, are highly active and selective for the 2e(-) ORR, and deliver higher kinetic current densities for H2O2 production than the state-of-the-art noble metal or single-atom catalysts in acidic solution. o-CoSe2 nanowires directly grown on carbon paper electrodes allow for the steady bulk electrosynthesis of H2O2 in 0.05 M H2SO4 with a practically useful accumulated concentration of 547 ppm, the highest among the reported 2e(-) ORR catalysts in acidic solution. Such efficient and stable H2O2 electrogeneration further enables the effective electro-Fenton process for model organic pollutant degradation.									58	5	0	0	9	0	59			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000589801000017

Raman spectroscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy were used to verify that the Ni or Co substituted MoS(2)was the metallic-like 1T ' phase of the metal dichalcogenide. The 10 at.% Ni/M-MoS2(10 at.% Co/M-MoS2) electrochemical HER catalyst investigated under alkaline conditions exhibited a low onset potential of similar to-75 mV (similar to-100 mV) and overpotential of -145 mV (-160 mV) at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). Pristine M-MoS(2)exhibited both a higher onset potential of similar to-150 mV and a higher overpotential of -240 mV at 10 mA/cm(2). First-principles density functional theory analysis showed that substitution of 3d transition metals like Ni and Co in the metallic MoS(2)structure notably stabilized the distorted polytype of 1T '-MoS2, lowering the free energy for H binding and H2O dissociation, both important steps in alkaline HER, giving rise to enhanced activity towards HER.									17	0	0	0	0	0	16			2196-0216			WOS:000546035900001

Herein, a core/shell structured hybrid catalyst, which features few-layered ruthenium (Ru)-doped molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets closely sheathing around multiwalled carbon nanotube (CNT), for highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is reported. With 5 at% (atomic percent) Ru substituting for Mo in MoS2, Ru-MoS2/CNT achieves the optimum HER activity, which displays a small overpotential of 50 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. Theoretical simulations reveal that Ru substituting for Mo in coordination with six S atoms is thermodynamically stable, and the in-plane S atoms neighboring Ru dopants represent new active centers for facilitating water adsorption, dissociation, and hydrogen adsorption/desorption. This work provides a multiscale structural and electronic engineering strategy for synergistically enhancing the HER activity of transition metal dichalcogenides.									133	9	0	0	5	0	133				2198-3844		WOS:000468187200011	31131203

In this study, we employed the first-principles density functional theory calculations to predict some key parameters (such as activation energy for O-O bond breaking and free-energy evolution as a function of electrode potential) of ORR on three FeN4-type active sites with different local carbon structures. We find that the FeN4 site surrounded by eight carbon atoms and at the edge of micropores has the lowest activation energy (about 0.20 eV) for O-O bond breaking among the three FeN4-type active sites for promoting a direct four-electron ORR. Consequently, our computational results suggest that introduction of micropores in the nonprecious metal catalysts could enhance their catalytic activity for ORR through facilitating the formation of FeN4-C-8 active sites with high specific activity.									104	10	0	0	2	0	105			1932-7447			WOS:000402775200035

During water electrolysis hydrogen can be evolved under pressure at isothermal conditions, enabling highly efficient compression. However, the permeation of hydrogen through the electrolyte increases with operating pressure and leads to efficiency loss and safety hazards. In this study, we report on an innovative concept, where the hydrogen crossover is electrochemically mitigated by an additional electrode between the anode and the cathode of the electrolysis cell. Experimentally, the technique was applied to a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer operated at a hydrogen pressure that was fifty times larger than the oxygen pressure. Therewith, the hydrogen crossover was reduced and the current efficiency during partial load operation was increased. The concept is also discussed for water electrolysis that is operated at balanced pressures, where the crossover of hydrogen and oxygen is mitigated using two additional electrodes.

The pyrolysis temperature and Fe dosage exhibit an obvious effect on ORR properties of the Fe-N-C species modified CNTs. The F/N-CNT electrocatalyst obtained under the optimized conditions (900(circle)C, 0.24 wt% Fe) exhibits excellent ORR electrocatalytic performance superior to commercially available Pt/C.Novel synthesis of efficient noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for both oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) in energy conversion devices (e.g., fuel cells, metal-air batteries) is of essential significance for further sustainable development. This paper reports a facile synthesis of Fe-N-C species-modified carbon nanotubes (F/N-CNTs) for ORR application by directly pyrolyzing a fluffy hybrid precursor at a moderate temperature (similar to 900 degrees C) in Ar. The fluffy hybrid precursors consisting of nitro-hydrochloric-acid-treated CNTs, melamine and Fe3+ species are prepared via a freeze-drying method. On account of the synergistic effect of various active sites, including pyridine-N, Fe-N-x and Fe3C, and the high conductivity of the CNTs matrix, the as-obtained F/N-CNT electrocatalysts exhibit excellent ORR activities, comparable to commercial Pt/C. The addition of N heteroatoms, the dosage of Fe and the pyrolysis temperature highly influence the ORR properties of the F/N-CNT samples. The typical F/N-CNT sample obtained at the optimized parameters shows an onset potential of 1.06V and a half-wave potential of 0.91V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in an alkaline condition, more positive than those (1.01V and 0.88V versus RHE) of Pt/C. The F/N-CNT exhibits outstanding bifunctional ORR/OER activity and excellent methanol tolerance, and the F/N-CNT-based Zn-air battery (ZAB) with an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.405V presents a current density of 125mAcm-2 and a power density of 76.5mWcm-2; these electrocatalytic properties are highly superior to Pt/C. The direct pyrolysis of fluffy hybrid precursors provides a concise but robust technical platform to achieve high-performance noble-metal-free electrocatalysts with ORR/OER activities superior to Pt/C.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1793-2920	1793-7094		WOS:000636246300010

Electric and structural properties of anodic films formed on the surface of electrodes during the 'charging' and 'discharging' processes of the negative and positive electrodes in the lead-acid battery were studied in situ using structurally sensitive variables, capacitance and resistance. It was found, in comparison with the pure lead electrode, that antimony present in the alloy, catalyzes the solid phase transition of PbO to non-stoichiometric PbOn oxide (n < 2) in the anodic layer, while it inhibits the formation of electronically! conducting beta-PbO2 phase. This causes an increase in oxygen evolution potential and expands the region of discharging and capacity of the positive electrode in the lead-acid battery.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1480-2422	2292-1168		WOS:000237894600005

While the magnetic properties of small crystalline iron oxide nanoparticles are well understood, the superparamagnetic size limit constitutes a significant barrier for further size reduction. Iron (oxy)hydroxide phases, albeit very common in the natural world, are far less studied, generally due to their poor crystallinity. Templating ultrasmall nanoparticles on substrates such as graphene is a promising method to prevent aggregation, typically an issue for both material characterization and applications. We generate ultrasmall nanoparticles, directly on the carbon framework by the reaction of a graphenide potassium solution, charged graphene flakes, with iron(II) salts. After mild water oxidation, the obtained composite material consists of ultrasmall potassium ferrite nanoparticles bound to the graphene nanoflakes. Magnetic properties as evidenced by magnetometry and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, with open magnetic hysteresis loops near room temperature, are widely different from classical ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. The large value obtained for the effective magnetic anisotropy energy density Keff accounts for the presence of magnetic ordering at rather high temperatures. The synthesis of ultrasmall potassium ferrite nanoparticles under such mild conditions is remarkable given the harsh conditions used for the classical syntheses of bulk potassium ferrites. Moreover, the potassium incorporation in the crystal lattice occurs in the presence of potassium cations under mild conditions. A transfer of this method to related reactions would be of great interest, which underlines the synthetic value of this study. These findings also give another view on the previously reported electrocatalytic properties of these nanocomposite materials, especially for the sought-after oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. Finally, their longitudinal and transverse proton NMR relaxivities when dispersed in water were assessed at 37 degrees C under a magnetic field of 1.41 T, allowing potential applications in biological imaging.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000768619500066	34981916

It is characterized by extensive silicification and ferruginisation with hematite, goethite, magnetite and native gold specks. The intermetallic compound within the dolomite is composed of varying proportion of Cu-Zn-Ni-Os-Fe which has been detected by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) study. The EMPA (WDS) results of the intermetallic compounds also reveal occurrences of intermetallic compounds of Cu-Zn-Ni-Os-Fe and native Au. The occurrence of these non-separable compounds is probably because these metals were formed at very high temperatures and in reducing condition during the evolving shear with low oxygen and low sulfur fugacity. The fast cooling effect thereafter probably made the geochemical environment least conducive for reaction between Cu/Zn/Ni and sulphur or oxygen.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2347-4327	0973-774X		WOS:000541601200002

In order to develop more efficient catalysts for this oxidatively demanding reaction, it is vital to have mechanistic insight in order to understand how the catalysts operate. Herein, we report the mechanistic details associated with the two Ru catalysts 1 and 2. Insight into the mechanistic landscape of water oxidation catalyzed by the two single-site Ru catalysts was revealed by the use of a combination of experimental techniques and quantum chemical calculations. On the basis of the obtained results, detailed mechanisms for oxidation of water by complexes 1 and 2 are proposed. Although the two complexes are structurally related, two deviating mechanistic scenarios are proposed with metal-ligand cooperation being an important feature in both processes. The proposed mechanistic platforms provide insight for the activation of water or related small molecules through nontraditional and previously unexplored routes.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000443923700046	30133266

Hydroxide ions generated from the hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode induce the precipitation of inorganic compounds, which block the active sites of the catalysts, leading to high cell voltage. To mitigate inorganic scaling, herein, an optimized interface between a porous electrode and a bipolar membrane (BPM, as a separator) was suggested in zero-gap seawater electrolyzers. Despite the formation of inorganic deposits at the front side (facing bulk seawater) of the porous cathode due to the water reduction reaction, the back side facing the cation exchange layer of the BPM remained free from thick inorganic deposits. This was ascribed to the locally acidic environment generated by proton flux from water dissociation at the BPM, enabling stable hydrogen production via the proton reduction at low overpotential. This asymmetric hydrogen evolution reaction at the porous cathode led to a considerably lower cell voltage and higher stability than that achieved with the mesh electrode. Moreover, precipitation at the front side of the porous cathode was further mitigated through acidification of the seawater by introducing an open area of the BPM that was not in contact with the porous cathode, allowing free protons that were not involved in the electron transfer reaction to diffuse out into the bulk seawater. These findings may provide critical guidance for the investigation of interfacial phenomena for the complete mitigation of inorganic scaling in the direct electrolytic splitting of seawater.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000787829800001	35332704

Transition metal single-atom catalysts constitute a promising candidate considering their maximum atom efficiency and high intrinsic activity. However, the fabrication of atomically dispersed transition metal sites is highly challenging, creating a need for for new design strategies and synthesis methods. Here, a clicking confinement strategy is proposed to efficiently predisperse transitional metal atoms in a precursor directed by click chemistry and ensure successful construction of abundant single-atom sites. Concretely, cobalt-coordinated porphyrin units are covalently clicked on the substrate for the confinement of the cobalt atoms and affording a Co-N-C electrocatalyst. The Co-N-C electrocatalyst exhibits impressive bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic performances with an activity indicator Delta E of 0.79 V. This work extends the approach to prepare transition metal single-atom sites for efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis and inspires the methodology on precise synthesis of catalytic materials.									21	1	0	0	0	0	19			2375-2548			WOS:000770280500024	35294235

Here, we demonstrate that whey powder, a major by-product in the dairy industry, can be used as a sustainable precursor to produce heteroatom doped carbon electrocatalysts for ORR. Rich N and S compounds in whey powders can generate abundant catalytic active sites. However, these sites are not easily accessible by reactants of ORR. A dual-template method was used to create a hierarchically and interconnected porous structure with micropores created by ZnCl2 and large mesopores generated by fumed SiO2 particles. At the optimum mass ratio of whey power: ZnCl2 : SiO2 at 1 : 3 : 0.8, the resulting carbon material has a large specific surface area close to 2000 m(2) g(-1), containing 4.6 at.% of N with 39.7% as pyridinic N. This carbon material shows superior electrocatalytic activity for ORR, with an electron transfer number of 3.88 and a large kinetic limiting current density of 45.40 mA cm(-2). They were employed as ORR catalysts to assemble primary zinc-air batteries, which deliver a power density of 84.1 mW cm(-2) and a specific capacity of 779.5 mAh g(-1), outperforming batteries constructed using a commercial Pt/C catalyst. Our findings open new opportunities to use an abundant biomaterial, whey powder, to create high-value-added carbon electrocatalysts for emerging energy applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000532538000001	32339388

To make the H2O2 production system compact, a flow-through solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) electrolyzer, which was used for the H-2- and O-2-feeds instead of gas cylinders, was connected to the microreactor. The influence of the gas and liquid flow rates and of the reaction temperature on H2O2 production was investigated to identify the optimal operating conditions for the stacked microreactor. In the previous study [Kusakabe, K., Kawaguchi, K., Maehara, S. and Taneda, M., 2007, Direct formation of hydrogen peroxide over palladium catalyst based on water electrolysis, J Chem EngJpn, 40: 523-528], direct synthesis of H2O2 over Pd/C catalyst was performed using a slurry batch reactor with two sheets of electrode for H-2 and O-2 evolution. The maximum H2O2 concentration of 3.4 x 10(-3) mol/L was attained after a 3-h reaction. In this study, a H2O2 concentration of 8.3 x 10(-3) mol/L was obtained at 10 degrees C in a 0.1 mol/L solution of HCl at the residence time of 93s in the stacked microreactor. In addition, H2O2 was successfully produced when pure water was used as the reaction liquid with H2 and 02 in the stacked microreactor. (C) 2008 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

However, oxygen is restricted in some environments-subterranean burrow systems or habitats at high altitude or deep in the ocean-and this could exert hypoxic stresses such as oxidative damage on organisms living in these environments. In order to cope with these stresses, organisms have evolved specific strategies to adapt to hypoxia, including changes in physiology, gene expression regulation, and genetic mutations. Here, we review how mammals have adapted to the three high-altitude plateaus of the world, the limited oxygen dissolved in deep water habitats, and underground tunnels, with the aim of better understanding the adaptation of mammals to hypoxia.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			2096-5451	2576-2095		WOS:000723445300001	34977482

The urgent challenge in this field is how to prepare highly efficient electrode materials. The introduction of oxygen vacancies (OVs) into catalytic materials has been confirmed to be an effective strategy toward enhancing the performance of PEC water splitting by both theoretical calculations and experiment results. Herein, the existing strategies for introducing OVs into nanomaterials are discussed in this minireview. In addition, the effect of OVs on PEC water splitting to improve the light absorption efficiency, charges transfer efficiency, and charge injection efficiency was summarized. Finally, we propose several challenges that need to be addressed in the field of PEC water splitting in the future. This minireview could offer some important contributions to the future synthesis of nano materials with rich OVs for PEC application.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The cyclic voltammetry of heterostructured electrodes with and without In3+ doping both showed Faradic pseudo-capacitance behavior based on the oxidation and reduction processes. The largest exchange current density of 3.43 mA/cm(2) was obtained for the heterojunction-structured-Bi2Te3 thin films and Cu7Te4 nanocrystals with In3+ doping in the WO3 electrode. This implies more favorable hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics and higher electrocatalytic activity at the anode. The highest specific capacity of 90.2 mA h/g was obtained at a scan rate of 10 mV/s, with the power density reaching 1.7 kW/kg at the highest energy density value of 18.85 Wh/kg for the In3+-doped electrode. The overall results revealed the inherent properties of the new electrode materials, as well as their potential use in energy storage devices or in future electrochemical energy conversion and storage applications involving hydrogen (or oxygen) evolution reactions.

MoNi has exhibited considerably higher catalytic activity than MoNi2, MoNi3 and MoNi4 in alkaline electrolytes; however, there are no reports on the application of MoNi to the HER. Herein, we report for the first time the construction of MoNi nanoparticle decorated CoMoO3 cuboid arrays of vertical growth using Ni foam as the scaffold (MoNi/CoMoO3/NF). Owing to the high catalytic activity of MoNi nanoparticles, the interaction between different phases, the ability to increase the active sites of CoMoO3 cuboids and the synergistic effect on the whole, the MoNi/CoMoO3/NF exhibits high stability and activity with zero onset overpotential and a low Tafel slope of 35 mV dec(-1), and only 18 mV is needed to afford 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, which is even better than that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the CoMoO3 and MoNi in MoNi/CoMoO3 synergistically enhanced water splitting activity. Our findings provided a new idea to integrally construct non-noble metal catalysts with outstanding HER performance surpassing that of noble metals.									24	2	0	0	1	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000442385800013

Novel mesoporous carbon (MPC) based engineered catalyst support is doped using high-temperature pyrolysis in the presence of metal acetate(s) and 1,10-phenanthroline (nitrogen source). Three transition metals are used to prepare mate-rials with the following metal compositions: Fe, Co, CoFe, FeMn, and CoMn. Physico-chemical characterisation shows the success of doping with similar morphology and textural properties of all materials. The rotating ring-disc electrode experiments in alkaline solution show that all five catalysts exhibit good electrocatalytic activity towards the ORR, with Fe-N-MPC, CoFe-N-MPC and FeMn-N-MPC being best-performing materials with excellent stability. The HO2- yield depends on the metal composition with Fe-N-MPC and FeMn-N-MPC giving the lowest percentage. The latter two are employed in the AEMFC and reach power densities of 473 and 474 mW cm-2, respectively.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000790382400004

Segregation of Au to the pristine surface under ultrahigh vacuum annealing leads to the phase separation with pure Au at the surface and alloyed Au in the subsurface. Upon switching to an oxidizing atmosphere, oxygen adsorption drives the surface segregation of Cu along with inward migration of pure Au to the subsurface. Switching to a H-2 atmosphere results in oxygen loss from the oxygenated surface, thereby promoting Au surface segregation and reverting the surface to the pristine state with the Au termination. These measurements demonstrated the tunability of the surface composition of the binary alloy by utilizing the interplay between the tendency of segregating a more noble constituent to the surface and the tendency to segregate the more reactive one with the chemical stimuli.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000518683800021	31976989

Here, we summarize our recent efforts to deal with the chemical complexity of the tens of thousands of organic compounds in the atmosphere using the volatility-oxygen content framework (often called the 2D-Volatility Basis Set, 2D-VBS). Our current ability to measure the ambient OA concentration as a function of its volatility and oxygen to carbon (O : C) ratio is evaluated. The combination of a thermodenuder, isothermal dilution and Aerosol Mass Spectrometry (AMS) together with a mathematical aerosol dynamics model is a promising approach. The development of computational modules based on the 2D-VBS that can be used in chemical transport models (CTMs) is described. Approaches of different complexity are tested against ambient observations, showing the challenge of simulating the complex chemical evolution of atmospheric OA. The results of the simplest approach describing the net change due to functionalization and fragmentation are quite encouraging, reproducing both the observed OA levels and O : C in a variety of conditions. The same CTM coupled with source-apportionment algorithms can be used to gain insights into the travel distances and age of atmospheric OA. We estimate that the average age of OA near the ground in continental locations is 1-2 days and most of it was emitted (either as precursor vapors or particles) hundreds of kilometers away. Condensation of organic vapors on fresh particles is critical for the growth of these new particles to larger sizes and eventually to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) sizes. The semivolatile organics currently simulated by CTMs are too volatile to condense on these tiny particles with high curvature. We show that chemical aging reactions converting these semivolatile compounds to extremely low volatility compounds can explain the observed growth rates of new particles in rural environments.									24	1	0	0	5	0	24			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000329068600001	24600994

The mechanism by which the molecular oxygen interacts with the coal macromolecule is suggested to occur in several steps. These steps primarily involve O-2 diffusion to the surface where physical adsorption followed by chemical adsorption takes place. The chemical adsorption forms several types of oxides that can subsequently react to form several products, primarily CO2. It has also been suggested that some of these oxidation mechanisms might involve radical reactions. As the previous studies were conducted under conditions where significant structural changes occur it is possible that in the low temperature range (T < 100 degrees C) the oxidation mechanism is different. Several different rank (lignite-subbituminous-bituminous) coals were isothermally heated at 95 degrees C in an air atmosphere for a period of up to 6 months and samples were collected at two week intervals. The radical concentration of each sample was measured by Continuous Wave Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (CW-EPR). It is apparent that there are distinct differences between the lower rank (lignite) and the higher rank (subbituminous, bituminous) coals. The lower rank coals exhibited only carbon centered radicals with an adjacent oxygen atom and the higher rank coals exhibited only carbon centered radicals. Interestingly, the lower rank coals exhibited no change in radical concentration due to the long term oxidation treatment while the higher rank coals showed a distinct increase in the radical concentration. These findings shed new light on the complex heterogeneous low temperature oxidation reactions occurring at the coal surface.									34	4	0	0	5	0	36			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000308101100042	22886081

Accordingly, a novel electrocatalyst should exhibit low overpotential, excellent electrochemical activity and durability superior to state of the art noble metal based electro-catalysts (e.g. Pt, IrO2, RuO2). Herein, for the very first time to the best of our knowledge, exploiting first-principles theoretical calculations of the total energies and electronic structures, we have identified a reduced noble metal content fluorine doped solid solution of MnO2 and IrO2, denoted as (Mn1-xIrx)O-2: F (x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4), OER electrocatalyst system exhibiting lower overpotential and higher current density than the state of the art IrO2 and other previously reported systems for PEM water electrolysis. The doped solid solution displays an excellent electrochemical performance with a lowest reported onset potential to date of similar to 1.35 V (vs. RHE), similar to 80 mV lower than that of IrO2 (similar to 1.43 V vs. RHE) and similar to 15 fold (x similar to 0.3 and 0.4) higher electrochemical activity compared to pure IrO2. In addition, the system displays excellent long term electrochemical durability, similar to that of IrO2 in harsh acidic OER operating conditions. Our study therefore demonstrates remarkable, similar to 60-80% reduction in noble metal content along with lower overpotential and excellent electrochemical performance clearly demonstrating the potential of the (Mn1-xIrx) O-2: F system as an OER electro-catalyst for PEM water electrolysis.									34	0	0	0	1	0	34			2046-2069			WOS:000398802000046

These NTs were successfully used as electrodes for water oxidation in KOH. This method offers homogenous incor poration of a small amount of ruthenium oxide (approximate to 0.12wt%) into 25m TiO2 nanotubes without the need for complicated facilities or steps. The addition of H2O into electrolytes is a key step for the stable adhesion of long-length TiO2 NT films on a substrate. The tips of the TiO2 nanotubes prepared by this novel method are not easily dissolved by electrolyte because the walls of the nanotubes are thickened by a factor of more than two in response to the addition of KRuO4 and H2O. The longest nanotubular TiO2 with a doping of ruthenium oxide and no wall dissolution shows the largest current density in the oxygen-evolution reaction.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000349917900015

The amount of Fe incorporated into PbO2 depends on two main factors; (i) the charge of the electrode surface and (ii) the charge of Fe(III) species. Surface analysis data show substantial differences in the physicochemical properties of Fe-doped and (Fe, F)-doped PbO2 in comparison with undoped oxide. In particular, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements show a marked decrease in the signal due to adsorbed oxygen species, water and hydroxyl groups. On the basis of these results and of tritium radioactive tracer measurements, it is proposed that incorporation of the foreign species in PbO2 occurs at defect sites: F- replaces OH groups while Fe3+ can replace Pb(II) or Pb(IV) at low and high temperature, respectively.

The composite material was prepared by simple and cost effective method. Mere heating of the precursors at low temperature (200 degrees C) resulted in molecular assembly of PMA on GO in the form of clusters which behaved as active centers for efficient ORR. The electrochemical study of PMA/rGO-2 (PMA to GO weight ratio of 1:2) catalyst carried out by rotating disk electrode (RDE) method, showed considerable electrocatalytic activity with E-onset of 1.0 V vs. RHE and current density of 4.0 mA/cm(2) at 1600 rpm in alkaline condition. Additionally, as-prepared PMA/rGO-2 catalyst showed a single step similar to 4 electron transfer pathway similar to commercial Pt/C catalyst; confirmed through rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) study. Interestingly, PMA/rGO-2 electrocatalyst exhibited substantially higher stability than Pt/C catalyst even after 20K potential cycles (though the current density of former catalyst is inferior to later). Further, in a methanol cross-over test, PMA/rGO-2 was found to be inactive towards methanol oxidation reactions, which could nullify the issues due to the fuel cross-over effect, if employed as cathode in direct methanol fuel cells. The enhanced ORR activity and significant stability is attributable to the anchoring and homogenous distribution of polyoxomolybdate clusters on graphite oxide.

Here we report density functional theory calculations (GGA-PW91) that probe the relationship between particle size, intermediate structures, and energetics of CO and NO oxidation by molecular and atomic oxygen on Pt-x clusters (x = 1-5 and 10). The preferred structures, charge distributions, vibrational spectra, and energetics are systematically examined for oxygen (O-2, 2O, and O), CO, CO2, NO, and NO2, for CO/NO co-adsorbed with O-2, 2O, and O, and for CO2/NO2 co-adsorbed with O. The binding energies of oxygen, CO, NO, and of the oxidation products CO2 and NO2 are all markedly enhanced on Ptx compared to Pt(111), and they trend toward the Pt(111) levels as cluster size increases. Because of the strong interaction of both the reactants and products with the Ptx clusters, deep energy sinks develop on the potential energy surfaces of the respective oxidation processes, indicating worse reaction energetics than on Pt(111). Thus the smallest Pt clusters are less effective for catalyzing CO and NO oxidation in their original state than bulk Pt. Our results further suggests that oxidation by molecular O-2 is thermodynamically more favourable than by atomic O on Ptx. Conditions and applications in which the Ptx clusters may be effective catalysts are discussed.									43	0	0	0	2	0	42			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000259678100010	18825289

Zirconium nitride nanopowders were synthesized via a simple direct carbothermic nitridation process of internal gel derived zirconia in the presence of nano-sized carbon black. The effects of reaction temperature, dwell time and molar ratio of carbon black to Zr (C/Zr) on the phase composition, grain size and crystal parameters of products were studied. Based upon the analysis of crystallite phase evolution and microstructure characterization, it was found that zirconium oxynitride is intermediate product and then O atoms in oxynitride were extracted by oxygen getter, carbon black. Anion sites were directly replaced by N atoms to form rock-salt type nitride in carbothermic nitridation process.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2045-2322			WOS:000503175000001	31844080

In this work, O-sb is investigated with theoretical methods. Although O-sb is unstable in slab models, it becomes stabilized within a "manually" reduced OD-Cu nanocube model which was calculated by self-consistent charge density functional tight binding (SCC-DFTB). The results obtained with SCC-DFTB for the full nanocube were confirmed with subcluster models extracted from the nanocube, calculated with both density functional theory (DFT) and SCC-DFTB. The. higher stability of O-sb in the nanocube is attributed to the disordered structure and greater flexibility. The adsorption strength of CO on Cu(100) is enhanced by O-sb withdrawing electron density from the Cu atom, resulting in reduction of the sigma-repulsion. Hence, the coverage of CO may be increased, facilitating its dimerization.									69	4	0	0	8	0	70			1932-7447			WOS:000416202900014

Here, we report a strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA)-assisted fabrication of ultrafine and homogeneously distributed PtRu alloy NPs using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tetrasodium-derived carbon (EC) as a matrix. The O, N-rich EC with a hierarchically macro/meso/microporous structure and the SEA-assisted formation of the [Ru(bpy)(3)][PtCl6] complex ensure the successful generation of ultrasmall PtRu alloy NPs (2.93 nm in diameter) with high dispersion. The optimal PtRu/EC-700 delivers excellent electrocatalytic properties with an ultralow overpotential (eta(10) = 18 mV), robust durability and good long-term stability for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The ultrasmall PtRu alloy NPs with rich surface sites, the synergistic catalysis effect between Pt and Ru and the hierarchically macro/meso/microporous structure of O, N-rich EC cooperatively enhance the HER performance of PtRu/EC-700.

Herein, a facial strategy coupling gas-phase nitridation with simultaneous heterogenization has been developed to synthesize heterostructure of one-dimensional (1D) Mo3N2 nanorod decorated with ultrathin nitrogen-doped carbon layer (Mo3N2@NC NR). Thereinto, the collaborative interface of Mo3N2 and NC is conducive to accomplish rapid electron transfer for reaction kinetics and weaken the Mo-H-ads bond for boosting the intrinsic activity of catalysts. As expected, Mo3N2@NC NR delivers an excellent catalytic activity for HER with low overpotentials of 85, 129, and 162 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline, acidic, and neutral electrolytes, respectively, and favorable long-term stability over a broad pH range. As for practical application in electrocatalytic water splitting (EWS) under alkaline, Mo3N2@NC NR parallel to NiFe-LDH-based EWS also exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.55 V and favorable durability at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) , even surpassing the Pt/C parallel to RuO2 -based EWS (1.60 V). Consequently, the proposed suitable methodology here may accelerate the development of Mo-based electrocatalysts in pH-universal non-noble metal materials for energy conversion.

Herein, an interface-engineering strategy is exploited to prepare efficient transition metal chalcogenide based HER catalysts in alkaline medium. Specifically, the heterogeneous nanostructure of 1D core-shell Te@NiTe2 and 2D NiS (Te@NiTe2/NiS) has been fabricated by an easy one-step solvothermal method. The HER activity of Te@NiTe2/NiS is optimized by adjusting the ratio of raw materials and reaction time. Under the optimum conditions, the Te@NiTe2/NiS displays higher HER activity than individual Te@NiTe2 and NiS in alkaline medium and the reasons are investigated in detail. To improve the HER activity of Te@NiTe2/NiS, the Te@NiTe2/NiS is further combined with conductive acetylene black (AB) by physically mixing. The resulting Te@NiTe2/NiS/AB has a low overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2) of 101 mV, higher current density than 20% Pt/C when the overpotential is larger than 0.37 V and good long-term stability, indicating its practicability as HER electrocatalysts.

In this study, we have synthesized various Ni and Co oxide (NCO) nanomaterials via a facile coprecipitation, followed by the calcination method. The morphology of the formed NCO nanomaterials was controlled by varying the percentage of the Ni and Co precursors, leading to the formation of a template-free mesoporous spinel phase structure of NixCo3-xO4. It was found that the number of the octahedral site cations and the defect sites with lower oxygen in the spinel oxides can be tunable by taking appropriate ratios of the Ni and Co precursors. The optimized NCO nanomaterial exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity compared to the mono-metal oxides of NiO and Co3O4 with over 3 times higher current density and similar to 0.250 V lower onset potential toward ORR in a 0.1 M KOH solution. Scanning electrochemical microscopy was utilized in mapping the activity of the catalyst and monitoring the ORR products, further confirming that a four-electron transfer pathway was facilitated by the NCO nanomaterial. Moreover, the developed mesoporous NCO nanomaterial exhibits a high methanol tolerance capability and long-term stability when compared to the commercial state-of-the-art Pt/C electrocatalyst. The improvement of the catalytic activity and stability of this advanced NCO nanomaterial toward ORR. may be attributed to the facile accessible mesoporous structure, and the abundance of octahedral site cations and defective oxygen sites.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000469288300023	31013420

Atomic mapping images reveal that the Ni and Zn elements have been successfully doped in MnCO3 and thus the prepared sample is not a mixture of MnCO3, NiCO3, and ZnCO3. It is the first time that the atomic mapping images of ternary transition metal carbonates have been demonstrated so far. The scanning transmission electron microscopy - annular bright field (STEM-ABF) image successfully confirms the formation of oxygen vacancies in MnxNiyZnzCO3, which is beneficial to improve the electrical conductivity. The evolution of the microstructure from crystal to amorphization during cycling process confirmed by the fast Fourier transform patterns effectively lowers the overpotential of the conversion reaction and accelerates the conversion between Mn2+ and much higher valence of Mn element, contributing to the superior capacity of MnxNiyZnzCO3 electrode. As anode material for lithium-ion batteries, the prepared MnxNiyZnzCO3 exhibits excellent long-term cycling stability and outstanding rate performance, delivering the superior reversible discharge capacities of 1066 mA h g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) after 500 cycles and 760 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) after 1000 cycles.

Herein, NiFe@N-doped graphene microtube (NiFe-NGMT) composites have been synthesized by a facile metal organic framework (MOF) precursor route, and employed as an effective electrocatalyst for HER. The NiFe-NGMT composites, which consist of NiFe alloy particles enveloped in N-doped graphene microtubes with a diameter of 1-2 mu m, were synthesized by thermal annealing a MOF precursor of nickel nitroprussides (NiFe(CN)(5)NO center dot 2H(2)O) in nitrogen atmosphere. By adjusting the pyrolysis temperature, the diameter of the tubular graphene can be tuned to 50 -200 nm. The obtained NiFe-NGMT composites exhibit excellent catalytic activity for HER with a low overpotential (70.5 mV) and a small Tafel slope (63.4 mV per decade), which afford the materials promising application for splitting water to generate hydrogen.

Multiscale engineering fully exploits the multi-synergy among components to endow the newly designed metal-free multi-sensing air electrode (MSAE) with bifunctional oxygen reduction and evolution activities, pressure sensitivity, and photothermal and photoelectric conversion functions in a single electrode, enabling effective regulation of interface properties, electronic/ionic transport, or redox reactions in SRZAB upon various stimulations and establishing multiple working principles.

Two series of monophasic La0.5Ca0.5MnO3-delta oxygen-deficient perovskites were stabilized in the 0 <= delta <= 0.12 range, either from reduction of La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 or oxidation of La0.5Ca0.5MnO2.5 Soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that Mn oxidation states differ as a function of the synthetic pathway. Temperature dependence of the magnetization as a function of anionic vacancies concentration at constant doping level are reported together with the evolution of high-resolution O K-edge and Mn L-edge spectra. Our results show dramatic changes in the magnetic behaviour due to the stabilization of different Mn oxidation states. ((C) Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived plate-shaped CoS1.097 nanoparticles for an improved hydrogen evolution reaction								DALTON TRANSACTIONS				51	26			10272	10278		10.1039/d2dt01630c		JUN 2022		JUL 5 2022	2022	Metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived transition metal sulfides are viewed as reliable, cost-effective, and alternative hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)-efficient electrocatalysts. They have been used to replace platinum (and their alloys) for production of renewable energy carriers such as hydrogen. Progress towards development of non-precious transition-metal sulfides through different synthetic routes to obtain unique morphological nanostructures with enhanced HER activity is challenging. We introduced a transition-metal sulfide, cobalt sulfide (CoS1.097), derived from a cobalt MOF [Co-BPY-DDE] by following facile, one-step solvothermal sulfurization. By varying the sulfurization temperature (from 140 degrees C to 180 degrees C) during the solvothermal method, three cobalt-sulfide products were obtained: CoS1.097-140, CoS1.097-160, and CoS1.097-180, respectively. Temperature variation had a vital role in optimizing the HER activity of the electrocatalyst. Besides, notable plate-shaped cobalt sulfide nanoparticles (CoS1.097-160) required overpotential of 163 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a low Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1), thereby demonstrating faster reaction kinetics during the evolution of molecular hydrogen. Furthermore, 25 h of long-term stability of the electrocatalyst reflected its practical applicability in acidic media. CoS1.097-160 had uniform plate-shaped morphology and large electrochemical active surface area, which contributed to enhanced electrochemical performance through water electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000815236100001	35748602

However, the commercial utilization of this novel system is limited by the low Faradaic efficiency, poor ammonia yield and high overpotential due to the strong N N bond and the dominant competing reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a BiOCl-modified two-dimensional (2D) titanium carbide MXenes nanocomposite (BiOCl@Ti3C2Tx) is proposed as a promising electrocatalyst for ambient nitrogen (N-2) reduction reaction with excellent catalytic performance and superior long-term stability at low overpotential. In 0.1 mol/L HCl, this catalyst attains a high Faradic efficiency of 11.98% and a NH3 yield of 4.06 mu g h(-1) cm(-2) at -0.10 V (vs. RHE), benefiting from its strong interaction of Bi 6p band with the N 2p orbitals, combined with its large specific surface area and the facile electron transfer.

The high resolution spectra allow to unequivocally identify the local environment of individual carbon atoms. Upon adsorption at 110 K, ethene adsorbs in a geometry, where the two carbon atoms within the intact ethene molecule occupy nonequivalent sites, most likely hollow and on top; this new result unambiguously solves an old puzzle concerning the adsorption geometry of ethene on Ni(111). On the oxygen precovered surface a different adsorption geometry is found with both carbon atoms occupying equivalent hollow sites. Upon heating ethene on the clean surface, we can confirm the dehydrogenation to ethine (acetylene), which adsorbs in a geometry, where both carbon atoms occupy equivalent sites. On the oxygen precovered surface dehydrogenation of ethene is completely suppressed. For the identification of the adsorbed species and the quantitative analysis the vibrational fine structure of the x-ray photoelectron spectra was analyzed in detail.

The reaction may by accompanied by triplet and singlet exitation of NADH. It was shown that hematoporphyrin in aqueous solution photosensitized the reaction of NADH oxidation by ferredoxin and methylviologen to the visible region of the spectrum. Under light excitation the redox potentials of NADH and NADPH were increased up to the level exceeding the potential of hydrogen electrode. Illumination of NADH and NADPH by UV-light in the presence of bacterial hydrogenase resulted in hydrogen evolution. The reaction of hydrogen evolution could be sensitised towards the visible region of the spectrum by chlorophyll or chloroplasts.									14	0	0	0	11	0	14			0320-9725			MEDLINE:26426	26426

For comparison, neodymium-WO3 nanostructure was also prepared. The as-synthesized composites were characterized by XRD, SEM, BET, EDX, XPS, UV-vis absorption spectra and Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy. Experimental results showed that WG-7 composite (7% graphene content into WO3) had excellent photocatalytic performance (rate of H-2 evolution 288/mu molh(-1) g(-1)) towards hydrogen production when compared to pristine WO3. It was also confirmed by optical analysis that incorporation of graphene into WO3 and Nd-WO3 photo-catalysts prevented the electron-hole recombination and boosts the reduction reactions for H-2 evolution. PL emission spectra confirmed the effective charge-separation in graphene incorporated WO3 composite. It was demonstrated that photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production increases with increasing doping content of graphene upto 7 at%. However, further increase in incorporated content above optimal level has decreased the photocatalytic performance of the composite. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of WG composites could be attributed to extended visible light absorption, high surface area and efficient charge-separation due to synergistic effects between graphene and WO3. This study gives a new perspective on the fabrication of novel photocatalyst for environmental and energy applications.									79	3	0	0	6	0	81			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000434399500005

The cathodic reaction was the hydrogen evolution reaction. Active, passive and transpassive behaviours were observed only at high concentrations of H2SO4 (0.01-1-0 M) in methanol, and passivity was due to the high inherent water content in sulphuric acid. Pitting was also observed on the steel surface. The pitting potential became nobler as the concentration of H2SO4 increased. In 0. 1 and 1.0 M H2SO4, a cathodic loop, characterized by measured negative current in the anodic region, was also observed. In methanol-HCl and methanol-LiCl solutions, the steel dissolved actively and no active-passive transition was observed. The corrosion rate was significantly higher in methanol-HCI solution as compared to methanol-LiCl due to the synergistic effects of acid and chloride ion.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			0971-457X	0975-0991		WOS:000250523200006

Herein, we present the heterostructure based MoS2.ZnO (MZO) heterostructures for successful electrochemical water splitting process. For HER, the prepared MoS2.ZnO nanocomposites show the over potential as low as 239 mV at cathodic current density 10 mAcm(-2) with an exchange current density of 3.2 mu Acm(-2). A Tafel slope of about 62 mV per decade suggested to have the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for the HER process with MoS2.ZnO nano composite as the catalyst. The small Tafel slope indicates a promising electrocatalyst for HER in practical application. The strong interface formation at the MoS2.ZnO heterostructure facilitates higher catalytic activity and excellent cycling stability. The heterostructure formation based on semiconductor two dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) open up new avenues for effective manipulation of HER catalysts.

Two electrolytic media (0.1 M HClO(4)and 0.05 M Na2SO4) were evaluated for the BDD, which simultaneously produced oxygen radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) and [Fe(VI)]. The generation of [Fe(VI)] was characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the effect of different current intensity values (e.g., 7 mA cm(-2), 15 mA cm(-2), and 30 mA cm(-2)) was assessed during BBR degradation tests. The discoloration of BBR was followed by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. When the EOx process was used alone, only 78% BBR discoloration was achieved. The best electrochemical discoloration conditions were found using 0.05 M Na(2)SO(4)and 30 mA cm(-2). Using these conditions, overall BBR discoloration values up to 98%, 95%, and 87% with 12 mM, 6 mM, and 1 mM of FeSO4, respectively, were achieved. In the case of chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction, the EOx process showed only a 37% COD reduction, whereas combining [Fe(VI)] generation using 12 mM of FeSO(4)achieved an up to 61% COD reduction after 90 min. The evolution of reaction byproducts (oxalic acid) was performed using liquid chromatography analysis.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2227-9717		WOS:000557514200001

Its thermal decomposition is exothermic and the onset temperature is close to its drying temperature in industrial production. The thermal decomposition process of PAN is a self-heating type and can produce many toxic products. Thus there is a severe thermal hazard associated with its drying process. In the present study the products of thermal decomposition at various heating rates and isothermal temperatures in the presence and absence of oxygen are evaluated using simultaneous TG-MS technique to provide an insight into the mechanism of their liberation and to obtain qualitative knowledge of the associated hazards. The identified gaseous products liberate simultaneously in the temperature range 150-400 degrees C and their evolution is dependent upon the heating rate and temperature. The principal reaction at lower heating rate is dehydrocyanation. Carbon dioxide liberation is observed, in addition to other products, in the presence of an oxygen-inert mixture atmosphere.

It was composed of potassium silicate glass, alumina and quartz powders. The high temperature oxidation performance of the alloy with and without coating was evaluated in static air at both 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C. The results show that catastrophic oxidation occurs for Ti60 bare alloy. It had a mass gain of about 2 mg/cm(2) after oxidation at 800 degrees C and 17 mg/cm(2) at 900 degrees C for 100 h. On the contrary, the oxidation resistance of alloy coated with composite coating was much improved with the mass gain about 0.36 mg/cm(2) and 0.95 mg/cm(2) at 800 degrees C and at 900 degrees C, respectively. The microstructure evolution of the composite coating and the alloy was analyzed by scanning electron microscope and electron probe microanalyzer. The effect of the composite coating on the oxidation performance of the alloy is discussed especially in terms of oxygen diffusion and interfacial reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1996-1944		WOS:000594132700001	33187235

The core/shell nanostructure provides a larger heterojunction interface to substantially reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, and hydrogenation enhances solar absorption of TNTAs. In addition, the N-doped carbon film coating acts as a high catalytic active surface for oxygen evolution reaction, as well as a protective film to prevent hydrogen-treated TiO2 nanotube oxidation by electrolyte or air. As a result, the N-doped carbon film coated TNTAs displayed remarkably improved photocurrent and photostability. The TNTAs with a N-doped carbon film of similar to 1 nm produces a current density of 3.6 mA cm(-2) at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl under the illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm(-2)), which represents one of the highest values achieved with modified TNTAs. Therefore, we propose that ultrathin N-doped carbon film coating on materials is a viable approach to enhance their PEC water splitting performance.									59	5	0	0	2	0	60			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000337143900057	24816496

The current research focuses on optimizing the band structure and intrinsic charge separation efficiency of CTFs. Other influential factors, i.e., the water affinity and the interaction with the Pt co-catalyst, are rarely investigated. Herein, we provide a facile protonation strategy for significantly improving the photocatalytic performance of CTFs. The protonated CTFs (P-CTF) can exhibit a hydrogen evolution rate of 6595 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is 7.14 times that of pristine CTFs. The main contribution of protonation is to improve the interaction among the P-CTF, H2O molecules, and Pt co-catalyst, which can increase the H2O concentration around the active catalytic sites, thus facilitating the transfer of the photogenerated electron from the Pt co-catalyst to the H2O. Our results provide some insight into the role of protonation in promoting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000812182000001

Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examinations demonstrate that the films have well-defined diamond features. The window potential of BDD/Ta in 0. 5 M Na_2SO_4 solution is 4.1 V:the hydrogen and oxygen evolution potentials are 1. 8 V and +2. 3 V respectively,which are much wider than those of traditional electrodes such as Pt,IrO_2 ,RuO_2.

Experiments were performed in the presence of oxidants and oxidation promoters such as air, oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, the latter being directly added to the solution or electrogenerated by the O-2-diffusion cathode. COD and UV-visible absorbance evolution showed that tannins are removed from electrolysed solutions down to relatively low values, permitting more than 94% elimination. Partial oxidation of the mother compound generates short-chain by-products (mostly carboxylic acids) responsible for the remaining low COD values. Contaminants (tannins and non-tannins) contained in industrial wastewater were removed by combining electroprecipitation with a Fenton-assisted process; a final oxidation step, carried out on a boron-doped diamond electrode, was performed in order to decrease the COD to very low final values.

The physicochemical characterization of Co3O4(x)/lsm-TiO2 hybrids by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirm the successful incorporation of cobalt oxide nanoparticles (2-3 nm in diameter) with preservation of the highly mesoporous structure of titanium dioxide substrate. Among these mesoporous hybrids, the similar to 3.0 wt.% Co3O4/lsm-TiO2 exhibits the best performance toward both the oxygen evolution (OER) and reduction (ORR) reactions in alkaline solution. For the OER, the hybrid shows oxidation overpotential of 348 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.034 s(-1), a Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1), and mass activity of 42.0 A g(-1) at 370 mV. While for ORR, an onset potential of 0.84V vs. RHE and OER/ORR overpotential gap (Delta E) of 0.92 V are achieved which is significantly lower than that of commercial Pt/C, hexagonal mesoporous, and bulk titanium dioxide analogous. The Co3O4/lsm-TiO2 hybrid demonstrates significantly higher long-term durability than IrO2. Apparently, such catalytic activity performance originates from the synergetic effect between Co3O4 and TiO2 substrate, in addition to higher charge carrier density and the presence of disordered mesopores which provide short ions diffusion path during the electrocatalytic process.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13				2073-4344		WOS:000498266100052

Unique to Cu(111) is a redox wave for surface hydride formation coincident with anion desorption, while the reverse reaction of hydride decomposition with anion adsorption yields H-2 by recombination rather than oxidation to H3O+. Charge imbalance between the reactions accounts for the asymmetric voltammetry in SO42- , ClO4-, PO43-, and Cl- electrolytes with pH 0.68-4.5. Two-dimensional hydride formation is evidenced by the reduction wave prior to H-2 evolution and vibrational bands between 995 and 1130 cm(-1). In contrast to Cu(111), no distinct voltammetric signature of surface hydride formation is observed on Cu(110) and Cu(100). The Cu(111) hydride surface phase may serve to catalyze hydrofunctionalization reactions such as CO2 reduction to CH4 and should be broadly useful in electro-organic synthesis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1948-7185			WOS:000719783300032	34734717

Herein, we report a facile strategy to fabricate a high-performance Ru-NMCNs-T electrocatalyst (T is the annealing temperature) for HER, which consist of both Ru nanoparticles and single Ru atoms well dispersed on nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres (NMCNs). Ru-NMCNs-500 exhibited the best HER performance in the series. To achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, it only needs an overpotential of 28 mV with a small Tafel slope of 35.2 mA dec(-1), superior to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. It also exhibited exceedingly improved long-term stability than Pt/C. This study can open a new avenue for preparing Ru-based catalysts toward HER under extreme alkaline conditions.

In this paper, we finally make good on that promise. Using observational data from the Whole Earth Telescope and a new analysis method employing a genetic algorithm, we empirically determine that the central oxygen abundance in the helium-atmosphere variable white dwarf GD 358 is 84% +/- 3%. We use this value to place preliminary constraints on the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 nuclear reaction cross section. More precise constraints will be possible with additional detailed simulations. We also show that the pulsation modes of our best-fit model probe down to the inner few percent of the stellar mass. We demonstrate the feasibility of reconstructing the internal chemical profiles of white dwarfs from asteroseismological data and find an oxygen profile for GD 358 that is qualitatively similar to recent theoretical calculations.									52	0	0	0	0	0	52			0004-637X			WOS:000170704800050

Highly active CoP nanocrystals are successfully decorated on conductive CNT backbone microspheres. Decomposition of polystyrene nanobeads during spray pyrolysis forms macropores over the CoP-CNT composite microspheres, which facilitate electrolyte permeation and maximize the active site exposure. In addition, such morphology not only enhances the electron transfer along the microsphere, but also minimizes the polarization of H-2 gas during HER. Due to the synergistic effect between CoP nanocrystals and CNT backbone, along with the unique morphology, the CoP-CNT composite microspheres demonstrate outstanding HER performance in an acidic electrolyte with a low overpotential of 119mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the catalyst maintains its excellent catalytic activity over 2000 cycles. This study marks the versatility of the spray pyrolysis process for the synthesis of conductive substrate-supported electrocatalysts with a wide variety of materials and structures.

Metal-air batteries have received significant prominence due to their high energy density compared to conventional batteries and fuel cells. Particularly, lithium-air battery has garnered tremendous attention owing to its highest theoretical energy density alongside a large cell capacity. However, technical challenges pertaining to the cathode such as cell voltage drop, carbon electrode corrosion, detrimental side reactions, electrode pore clogging, etc., still persist and hinder their commercial success. So, to improve their overall performance and make them a practical success, various cathode materials are being investigated by researchers around the globe. Nanoengineering of two-dimensional materials is one such subject under extensive investigation, where MXenes have recently emerged as strong candidates with their unique properties such as high hydrophilicity, large interlayer spacing, and high mechanical stability. MXenes with high electrical conductivity and catalytic activity possess a huge potential for applications in energy storage. Over the past few years, more than 30 MXenes with different chemistries have been synthesized for various applications. Yet, titanium carbide MXene (Ti3C2Tx) remains as the most studied MXene, mainly, but not exclusively, for its high electrical conductivity, which makes it a suitable choice for electrode material. This review presents an overview of MXene, its syntheses, and an up-to-date summary from the literature focused on the potential use of TiC MXenes as cathodes in Li-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000863050200001

In this study, we have designed and synthesized a new (Fe3NiS8-delta)(-4+delta) carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid electrocatalyst and revealed that the catalyst shows a very high oxygen evolution reaction (1.55 V at 10 mA/cm(2)) and oxygen reduction reaction (E-1/2 = 0.82 V vs RHE) performances. Based on the analyses by in situ electrochemical X-ray diffraction together with structure analysis software, in situ electrochemical Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and computer simulations, such a high performance is derived from the sulfur vacancies that were formed via the self-doped d-p orbitals of Fe-III in (Fe3NiS8-delta)(-4+delta). Here, we describe an adequate explanation about the role of the iron doping in the nickel sulfides in the catalyst. Furthermore, the fabricated flexible and rechargeable Zn-air and water electrolyzer batteries using the catalyst show a low charge-discharge overpotential gap of 0.66 V and a 237 mA/cm(2) current density at 1.9 V, which is very important for the development of a rechargeable Zn-air battery and water electrolyzer with a high performance. First-principles calculations are employed to investigate the reaction mechanisms and elucidate the effect of the CNT support for the catalytic activity.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2574-0962			WOS:000595488500072

A series of Ba and Sr containing perovskites was synthesized via modified Pechini method and their crystal structure was characterized by XRD. The thermochemical reduction-oxidation steps of the redox cycle and oxygen exchange capacity of the perovskites were investigated by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The results revealed that Co-based perovskites are the most promising candidates for solar thermochemical energy storage application. The O-2 release/absorption of Co-based perovskites is completed in a reversible way when reaching a given temperature. BaCoO3 reduction occurs promptly when the temperature reaches 900 degrees C in Ar atmosphere (pO(2) = 10(-6) atm), and the oxidation proceeds completely as soon as the gas is switched from Ar to 20% O-2 at 600 degrees C. In these conditions, the amount of monatomic oxygen released captured reaches 0.47/0.49 mol per mol BaCoO3. Part substitution in A site improves the O-2 exchange capacity of Ba0.5Sr0.5FeO3-delta but not Ba0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta, while part substitution in B-site improves the O-2 exchange capacity of SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta and SrCo0.2Fe0.8O3-delta. Part substitution together in A-site and B-site of perovskites does not improve the O-2 exchange capacity of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta and Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta. The Fe-based perovskites generally exhibit continuous non-stoichiometry changes according to the temperature change suggesting continuous topotactic evolution, while the non-stoichiometry of Mn-based systems is almost not changed at the considered temperatures. Ba containing systems (BaCoO3, BaFeO3 and Ba0.5Sr0.5CoO3) show the largest oxygen release ability under inert (pO(2) = 10(-6) atm) or oxidizing atmosphere (pO(2) = 0.2 atm) up to 1050 degrees C, while only BaCoO3 can be fully re-oxidized at 600 degrees C in a 20% O-2 atmosphere, with an energy storage capacity of 292 J/g.

However, it is still a challenge to control the particle sizes of RuPx were on the supports. In this study, the Schiff-based networks with 3D rigid organic networks are successfully grown on graphene, and the obtained composite was used as a new support for the RuPx. This composite can not only provide more metal coordinating sites but also restrict the growth of RuPx. Therefore, ultra-small RuPx nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed via a subsequent phosphating and pyrolysis process. The final RuPx/JNPG catalyst exhibits low overpotentials at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (32 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, 13 mV in 1 M KOH solution, and 50 my in 1 M PBS solution). This work provides a new strategy to solve the aggregation problem of the metal phosphides on the substrate by introducing Schiff-based networks into the graphene.

Electrochemical investigations demonstrated that Mo doping made the catalytic activity of Ni2P significantly enhanced. To achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), Mo-Ni2P NWs/NF required an overpotential of 67 mV in acidic solution, 78 mV in alkaline solution and 84 mV in neutral solution. It also showed superior stability with negligible activity decay after its use in the HER under different pH conditions for 24 h. Such excellent HER activity might originate from the synergistic effect between molybdenum (Mo) and nickel (Ni) atoms. The present work provides a valuable route for the design and synthesis of inexpensive and efficient all-pH HER electrocatalysts.									153	12	0	0	5	0	156			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000414960900018	28820219

Firstly, NiFe hydroxide nanosheets have been electrodeposited on NF (NiFe/NF) as a precursor with a large surface area. Secondly, the as-prepared NiFe/NF has been subjected to a hydrothermal sulfuration process in order to prepare NiFeS/NF as an efficient electrocatalyst for the OER. The as-prepared samples have been characterized by XRD, XPS and SEM. The SEM images show that the NiFeS film was composed of needle-like nanostructures covering the surface of the NF. The corresponding OER performances in alkaline media have been systematically investigated. NiFeS/NF shows a superior overpotential of 65 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than most Ni-based electrocatalysts. The overpotential of 189 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) of NiFeS/NF suggests very promising OER activity for industrial applications. The electrochemically active surface area (251.25 cm(2)) of NiFeS/NF is obviously larger than that of NiFeS/NF (173.75 cm(2)) and NiFeS/NF (205.00 cm(2)). However, the stability of NiFeS/NF is not very good due to the intrinsic nature of metal sulfides in alkaline solution. An approach of electrodeposition of Fe hydroxide film on NiFeS/NF (NiFeS-Fe/NF) has been used to protect NiFeS/NF for better stability for the OER. The OER performances of NiFeS-Fe/NF demonstrate enhanced stability but lower activity with 101.6 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Therefore, there may be an optimal balance between activity and stability of transition metal sulfides for the OER.									204	14	0	0	8	0	210			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000382656500018

In this work, we fabricated hierarchically porous Co-Ru catalysts with excellent catalytic activity and durability in acidic media. The morphology of the Co-Ru catalysts was successfully controlled through an optimized electrochemical process. Among all Co-Ru samples prepared in this study, the Co72Ru28 catalyst exhibited the largest catalytic surface area, as well as excellent HER activity (overpotential of 26.4 mV at -10 mA cm(-2)) and durability. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements revealed the electron transfer between Co and Ru, indicating that the formation of the Co-Ru alloy improved the activity and durability of the catalyst. Furthermore, a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) prepared with the Co72Ru28 sample showed excellent performances (3.4 A cm(-2) at 2.0 V-cell), illustrating the promising potential of the present Co-Ru catalysts as cathode materials for PEMWE systems.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000749357700001

In this work, we report that the Volmer step can be facilitated by in-situ surface reconstruction on a composite between cobalt carbonate hydroxide and titanium oxide (TiO2@CoCH), and the resultant activated structure turns to be a highly efficient electrocatalyst for alkaline HER. Experimental characterization and density functional theory calculation evidence that under HER potential the smooth TiO2@CoCH surface is roughened and Co interstitial defects in TiO2 are formed, which are energetically favorable for Volmer step. The activated composite exhibits an overpotential of 99 ? 6 mV for a current density of 20 mA cm-2 and 187 ? 21 mV for 100 mA cm-2, suggesting that TiO2@CoCH is one of promising non-precious metal electrocatalysts for HER in alkaline media.									21	1	0	0	2	0	21			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000634244200003

Although studies on grain boundary have been reported for catalysis, it is still challenging to construct nanostructures with rich grain boundaries and reveal their function mechanism. Herein, we present a facile strategy to synthesize bimetallic borides Ni3B/MoB nanosheets with abundant grain boundaries and unravel the impact of grain boundaries on electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Experimental results, combined with theoretical calculations, revealed that the synthesized Ni3B/MoB featured numerous grain boundaries and optimized morphology. More importantly, the electronic states at the grain boundary were adjusted and Delta G(H*) was optimized. This resulted in highly intrinsic catalytic activities for HER in both acidic and alkaline conditions. This work sheds new light on the synthesis and regulation of transition metal borides and functional materials enriched grain boundaries for catalysis.									33	0	0	0	2	0	33			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000626507300006

The rapid recrystallization and polycondensation in microwave-assisted synthesis (MAS) led to the controlled growth of ferric-hydroxide Fe(OH)3 from the ironhydroxo complex Fe(H2O)(3)(OH)(3) formed from hydrolyzed FeCl3. Further, the dependence of a number of MAS cycles on the growth and evolution of beta-FeOOH nanorod array templated photoanode was examined by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. The formation mechanism with morphology-controlled FeOOH nanostructure was well discussed and verified. Further, high-temperature quenching (HTQ) transformed MAS akaganeite into hematite, and Sn4+ diffused from FTO substrate. Due to the synergistic impact of MAS growth and Sn4+ diffusion in the alpha-Fe2O3 nanostructure, the optimum FTO/Fe2O3-1 photoanode achieved the highest photocurrent density (0.854 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE) related with other studied samples. The charge-transfer mechanisms in microwave-assisted Sn4+-diffused alpha-Fe2O3 nanostructure photoanodes are also investigated. Additionally, the surface-modified FTO/Fe2O3-1 photoanode exhibited the 91 and 180 mu mol of oxygen and hydrogen evolution during photoelectrochemical water splitting, respectively. This work opens a sustainable and feasible strategy for designing and regulating high-efficient novel functional photoanode materials for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000800489800002

The as-fabricated RuO2 NPs/CC electrode with electro-deposition duration of 10 min demonstrates a superior electrocatalytic activity with a lower overpotential of ca. 1.05 V vs. SCE and its current density reaches up to 175 mA cm(-2) at 1.2 V vs. SCE for chlorine evolution reaction (CER) in 5.0 M NaCl aqueous solution, outperforming many of the reported counterparts. The as-revealed outstanding electrocatalytic activity should be attributed to several beneficial factors such as its typical integrated binder-free 3D architecture, higher usage efficiency of active RuO2 NPs, greatly decreased interfacial resistance, etc. This work paves a way to utilize the carbon fiber cloth decorated with active noble metal oxides for boosting electrochemical Cl-2 production.

Despite the advantages of their catalytic properties and significant reduction of Ir utilization, dissolution of alkaline and alkaline-earth elements into acid media can be a serious drawback that may confine long-term applications. By using atomic-column-resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrate the surface variations of three alkaline-earth iridates, AIrO(3) (A = Sr or Ba). Directly identifying the structural transformation into metastable nanocrystallites or an amorphous state, we elucidate that substantial surface roughening can be induced by alkaline-earth elemental leaching. In particular, similar to 20-fold increases in the active surface area in pseudocubic SrIrO3 and monoclinic BaIrO3 are notable structural features. Our findings emphasize both the impact of surface structure on the overall catalytic activity and consequently the important control of chemical leaching to attain a high surface area in iridate-based catalysts.									56	3	0	0	5	0	55			2451-9294			WOS:000502574000020		
J	Liang, Jiyuan; Wang, Yong-Zheng; Wang, Chun-Chieh; Lu, Shih-Yuan								In situ formation of NiO on Ni foam prepared with a novel leaven dough method as an outstanding electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reactions								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				4	25			9797	9806		10.1039/c6ta03729a				2016	2016	A novel leaven dough method was developed to prepare three-dimensional Ni foams, upon which a thin NiO nanostructure was grown through thermal oxidation to form NiO/Ni foams as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs). This method is simple, scalable, and carries less environmental burdens, involving no cumbersome time-consuming templating procedures and adopts a new concept of "solid solvent" instead of using a large amount of solvent. In this method, nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate served as the Ni precursor and leavening agent, with F127 acting as a "solid solvent" and fuel. Heating the ground mixture of the nitrate and F127 powders at 80 degrees C led to formation of a green dough that was calcinated at 300 degrees C to obtain the Ni foam. The NiO/Ni foam was prepared by in situ thermal oxidation of the Ni foam and applied as an electrocatalyst for OERs. The NiO/Ni electrode fabricated from the NiO/Ni composite exhibited a remarkably low onset over-potential of 268 mV and low working over-potential of 345 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The electrochemical kinetics of the electrode were outstanding with an ultra-small Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. The outstanding electrocatalytic performances of the present NiO/Ni electrode, comparable to those achieved by noble metal oxide based electrodes, can be attributed to the three-dimensionally well-connected Ni foam skeleton and the intact contact of the NiO/Ni domains, offering excellent charge transfer and transport networks. The present leaven dough method can be extended to fabricate a wide variety of metal oxide/metal foams for applications in electrochemical devices for intact functional material/current collector composite electrodes.									98	1	0	0	4	0	98			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000378716900012

The reaction is investigated by calculating initial-state-resolved reaction probabilities, cross sections, and rate constants, which are explained in terms of energy profiles and collision mechanisms. These properties reflect the large endo-thermicity of the reaction and the features of the surfaces. Indeed, at low v values we obtain large thresholds and the lower surface is more reactive than the higher one, whereas at high v the thresholds decrease or disappear and the upper surface becomes more reactive. QM and QCT results are in satisfactory agreement, except some differences at low or high collision energy and temperature. QCT rate coefficients agree also with some published results. WP snapshots and movies of QCT time evolution show clearly abstraction and insertion mechanisms depending on the initial conditions. Insertion proceeds via a reaction complex and we observe a QM Feshbach resonance for a specific initial condition. On the overall, the dynamical observables are consistent with the collision mechanisms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

The model is formulated based on a three-dimensional (3-D) setting. By considering the diffusion and reaction effects of free oxygen in a domain of solid material, a partial differential equation named as the diffusion-reaction equation is derived, which contains an oxidation damage variable representing the fraction of the oxidized metal at a local material point. The evolution equation of the oxidation damage variable can also be derived, which together with the diffusion-reaction equation formulates the governing system of the model. To show the efficiency of the model, a 1-D problem is first studied. By taking P92 steel as an example, the values of the parameters in the governing system are determined. Based on the numerical solutions to the governing system, some key features of the oxidation behavior of high-Cr steel sample are analyzed. The influences of the parameters on the oxidation process have also been discussed. The model is further implemented into the ANSYS UserMatTh subroutine. Then, some typical examples of FEM simulations are introduced. It can be seen that our current model is suitable to simulate the global oxidation behaviors of high-Cr steel specimens with different geometrical shapes and subject to different boundary conditions. Therefore, the model would be helpful for the design and residual lifetime evaluation of high-Cr steel components in practical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0030-770X	1573-4889		WOS:000536436800001

Here, we developed a series of catalysts with transition metals anchored on carbon nanotubes (denoted M-N-CNTs, where M = Co, Fe, Mn, or Ni) containing single-atom M-N moieties, to activate peroxymonosulfate for the efficient nonradical oxidation of sulfamethoxazole. The spin state of M-N-CNTs strongly determined their catalytic activity. A large effective magnetic moment with a high spin state (e.g., Co-N) favored the overlap of d orbitals with oxygen-containing adsorbates (such as peroxo species) on metal active sites and promoted electron transfer, which facilitated peroxymonosulfate adsorption and enhanced the oxidation capacity of the reactive species. These findings advance the mechanistic understanding of transition metal-mediated persulfate activation and inform the development of efficient spintronic catalysts for environmental applications.									47	0	0	0	25	0	47			2155-5435			WOS:000684035000054

(LeTID). We found that the regeneration rate of BO-LID, as well as the extent and kinetics of LeTID, were strongly influenced by peak firing temperature. These dependences can be explained by the variation of hydrogen concentration, which was modulated by peak firing temperature. Furthermore, we found that extending the duration of dark annealing pre-treatment decelerates the subsequent regeneration of BO defects. This result revealed that, under dark annealing, the evolution of LeTID was accompanied by a notable decrease in the mobile hydrogen concentration. Supported by this phenomenon, a hydrogen-related model based on reversible reaction is proposed to describe the LeTID behavior in crystalline silicon.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0927-0248	1879-3398		WOS:000640913900005

These NGPC/NCNTs hybrids have demonstrated prominent catalytic activities toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium. Compared to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst, the optimized NGPC/NCNT-900 (annealed at 900 degrees C) exhibits superior catalytic activity, durability and methanol tolerance, which makes it one of the best ORR electrocatalysts derived from MOFs. The promising properties in NGPC/NCNT-900 are mainly attributed to synergistic contributions of its unique hybrid structure, rich nitrogen doping, high graphitic degree, and large surface area. This attractive route for the preparation of NGPC/NCNTs holds promise for general use of a great number of available and yet rapidly growing MOFs in constructing high-performance carbon-based ORE. electrocatalysts.									185	11	0	0	5	0	188			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000365465600011

Unfortunately, the prereduction via the common H-2 annealing method is unstable for nanomaterials during the hydrogen evolution process. Here, using NiMoO4 nanowire arrays as the example, it is demonstrated that carbon plasma (C-plasma) treatment can greatly enhance both the catalytic activity and the long-term stability of transition metal oxides for hydrogen evolution. The C-plasma treatment has two functions at the same time: it induces partial surface reduction of the NiMoO4 nanowire to form Ni4Mo nanoclusters, and simultaneously deposits a thin graphitic carbon shell. As a result, the C-plasma treated NiMoO4 can maintain its array morphology, chemical composition, and catalytic activity during long-term intermittent hydrogen evolution process. This work may pave a new way for simultaneous activation and stabilization of transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts.									24	2	0	0	0	0	24			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000430922100030	29611895

Electron doping of SrTiO3 due to oxygen vacancies triggers the development of a highly active SrTiO3 photocatalyst; however, the photodynamic processes involved in these modifications of SrTiO3 have not been fully elucidated yet. In this work, we investigated the impact of high temperature treatment based on the dynamics of photocarriers by transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS). TAS results revealed that upon band gap excitation of SrTiO3, most of the photoexcited electrons in non-reduced SrTiO3 are deeply trapped in the intrinsic defects as evident from the strong broad absorption signals peaking at 11000 cm(-1) (909 nm, 1.36 eV) and 20000 cm(-1) (500 nm, 2.48 eV), whereas the absorption intensities in this wavenumber region largely decreased in highly reduced SrTiO3, suggesting a possible electron filling of deeply trapped states via reduction treatment (or electron doping). Interestingly, the photoexcited electrons in oxygen-deficient SrTiO3 preferably occupy the shallower electron traps. The lowest energy limit of the electron trap filled by photoexcited electrons is estimated to be at the absorption edge located at 1000 cm(-1) (similar to 0.12 eV below the conduction band), which is much shallower than that of non-reduced SrTiO3 (>0.7 eV). Furthermore, it was found that the electron population in the shallow traps in highly reduced SrTiO3 is nearly 2 orders of magnitude higher compared to that in non-reduced SrTiO3, indicating a large improvement in the electron lifetime. The findings herein offer significant insights into the crucial impact of the reduction of SrTiO(3)via induced oxygen vacancy defects to provide available photoexcited electrons that can be readily utilized for the H-2 generation reaction.									14	0	0	0	1	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000509471800042

The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, and density gradient column showed that the PAN fibers treated with high temperature and for long time have higher extent of cyclization, oxygen content, and crosslinking content. The crystallinity and crystallite size decreased with the increase of TOS time and temperature, whereas the bulk density of the stabilized fibers increased. The mechanical property results indicated that the decrease in tensile strength was inseparable from the formation of the cyclic structure and the amorphization transition of the crystal structure. The fibers have better structural stability when the extent of cyclization was 80-83%, the crystallinity was 34-45%, and the bulk density of stabilized fibers was 1.33-1.35 g/cm(3), but exceeding these ranges, a serious skin-core structure appeared.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0021-8995	1097-4628		WOS:000546300800001

However, the serious aggregation during the calcination and the poor electron conductivity are still obstacles for these electrocatalysts which need to be urgently solved. Herein, an in situ confinement pyrolysis protocol is reported to transform ZIF-67 nanocrystals on hollow carbon spheres (HCS) to cobalt and nitrogen-enriched carbon shell, resulting in the formation of hierarchical HCS@Co/NC. This is the first study of electrochemistry for HCS decorated with MOFs or MOFs derivatives. In the structure, metallic Co nanoparticles (NPs) and N species are strongly anchored and dispersed in the network of nanocarbon shell, which not only affords a boosting conductivity but also greatly alleviates the aggregation of active sites. Meanwhile, the unique structure with hollow feature provides an effective pathway for mass transport and shortens the transmission path of electrons. Thanks to the advantages of structure and composition, the HCS@Co/NC catalyst exhibits a superb performance of oxygen reduction reaction, which outperforms the commercial Pt/C benchmark.

H-2 evolution occurred over a LaMnO3/CdS composite photocatalyst under Xe lamp irradiation from water containing the solubilized sewage sludge and the amount of evolved H-2 reached more than 30 mmol/g-catalyst for a 200 h-reaction; on the other hand, no H-2 was formed in the absence of the solubilized sewage sludge. The H-2 evolution rate was comparable to that when typical Na2S-Na2SO3 sacrifice agents were used, suggesting the applicability of a biomass-derived sacrifice agent for photocatalysis. Organic compounds, such as methanol and formic acid, contained in the solubilized sewage sludge are responsible for the H-2 evolution observed. (C) 2003 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

How to efficiently oxidize H2O to 'OH in EAOP is a great challenge due to the 'OH production mechanism is ambiguous. In this study, the state-of-the-art anode, boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode, was chosen as a prototype to unveil the water oxidation and 'OH production mechanism by using density functional theory (DFT). The free energy of adsorbed oxygen intermediates (OH*, O* and HOO*) was elucidated in detail, and the max {Delta G1, G2, G3 and G4} of step oxidation reactions was used as a descriptor to understand 'OH production mechanism. The obtained results indicated that the BDD anode was thermodynamically favorable to be involved in the production of 'OH rather than O2 generation reaction. Besides, the water oxidation mechanism on various dopants (N, P, S and F elements) doped diamond (i.e., NDD, PDD, SDD and FDD) anodes were also investigated. Notably, FDD (2.69 V), SDD (2.43 V) and PDD (1.89 V) exhibited higher eta OER compared with NDD (1.24 V) and BDD (1.59 V). The F, S and P doping in diamond would enhance the Delta G2 or Delta G3 of step H2O oxidation reactions and induce the increase of the eta OER, which made the generation of O2 more difficult, thus increasing the Faradic efficiency of 'OH production. This allowed us to resolve several long-standing puzzles about the relationship between water oxidation and 'OH production mechanism on BDD electrodes, and might give inspiration on EAOP anode design for effective water treatment.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000681175900001

A novel p-n tungsten oxide homojunction was successfully synthesized by tuning oxygen vacancies and phosphorus-doping. Based on the synergies of Mxenes, a Vis-NIR light-enhanced electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution system was accomplished with a small overpotential of 44 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and a low Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1), which performed much more efficiently than in darkness and comparably to noble-metal catalysts (Pt and Pt/C). Moreover, the as-synthesized samples offered a distinct advantage of long-term stability for more than 24 h both with and without light irradiation. The design philosophy of p-n homojunctions opens a prospect of utilizing light-activated metal oxides to integrate catalysis with solar energy and electrical energy.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000482139000035

Currently, the platinum metal group shows the best catalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but the high cost and low abundance of these materials limit their wider application. Therefore, we synthesized transition-metal-based NiCoS along with carbon dots (C-dots) as a structure-directing agent by a hydrothermal method. We also synthesized sulfur-doped NiCo, where the sulfur enhances the conductivity of the catalysts. Herein, the synthesis temperatures were changed in the range from 120 to 240 degrees C. Among all, NiCoS synthesized at 150 degrees C shows the best HER performance capabilities. In more detail, NiCoS prepared at this temperature exhibits an onset potential of 96 mV and an overpotential of 232 mV. Especially, as-prepared NiCoS nanoflower subjects to long-term stability over 20 h at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), making it a promising low-cost candidate for hydrogen production.

Herein, the distribution of OPAHs and SPAHs in lignin pyrolytic tar at different temperatures is elaborated with ESI (-) FT-ICR MS and GC-MS, and the formation routes of two typical OPAH and SPAH are deeply explored via DFT. It is found that most of oxygen-containing compounds convert to phenols and their homologues such as guaiacol (a typical precursor of OPAHs) with the temperature increased. The tar prepared at high temperature contains disulfide, thiophene and thiophene homologues, which are typical precursors of SPAHs. FT-ICR-MS strongly suggests that molecular mass of OPAHs and SPAHs compounds mainly concentrates between 200 Da and 400 Da with carbon atom number from 5 to 25 and DBE from 4 to 15. Higher temperature significantly promotes deoxygenation reaction since weighted average carbon atom number and DBE of molecules increase 28.4 % and 12.9 %, while the corresponding weighted average oxygen atom number decreases from 7.21 to 5.96 with temperature rising from 500 degrees C to 900 degrees C. Incorporating with DFT calculation, the pathways of OPAHs and SPAHs during lignin pyrolysis at high temperature are concluded: Guaiacol converts to 1-methoxynaphthalene via 4 methylation reactions, and butene firstly generates thiophene and then converts to methyl-benzothiophene. Among the reactions above, benzene ring and thiophene ring generation steps possess the highest energy barriers (436.74 kJ/mol and 446.33 kJ/mol), further illustrating higher temperature promotes the formation of OPAHs and SPAHs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0165-2370	1873-250X		WOS:000663088900002

We find that H-2 and CO can possess large abundances in cold gas throughout the bulk of the globule, in spite of the enhanced photon field provided by the central star. Emission from C2H and CN will be detectable from individual globules if they are carbon-rich. The temperature in the boundary layer between a globule and the wind of the nebula's central star is estimated, and found to be too low for neutral-neutral reactions to cause most boundary-layer oxygen to be in OH and H2O.									29	0	0	0	1	0	29			0035-8711			WOS:A1994PX62200005

It is found: (i) at neutral pH, the fluorescence from Trp(241) is strongly diminished in MSP solutions, whereas it highly dominates the overall emission from the C-terminus peptide; (ii) at alkaline pH, the emission of Tyr and Trp is quenched in both, MSP and C-terminus peptide, with increasing pH but the decline curve is shifted by about two pH units towards the alkaline region in MSP; (iii) a drastically different pattern emerges in the 7:1 mixture where the Trp emission even slightly increases at high pH; (iv) the anisotropy of the fluorescence emission is wavelength-independent (310-395 nm) and indicative of one emitter type (Trp) in the C-terminus peptide and of two emitter types (Tyr, Trp) in MSP; and (v) in MSP-depleted PS H membrane fragments the oxygen evolution is restored (up to 85% of untreated control) by rebinding of MSP but not by the C-terminus peptide, however, the presence of the latter diminishes the restoration effect of MSP. A quenching mechanism of Trp fluorescence by a next neighbored tyrosinate in the peptide chain is proposed and the relevance of the C terminus of MSP briefly discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Such highly opened hierarchical nanostructures with an ordered phase and low-coordinated edge sites exhibited a substantially enhanced activity toward the ORR. Especially, the intermetallic Pd3Pb nanoflowers achieved a record-breaking mass activity (1.14 mA mu g(Pd)(-1)) in an alkaline solution at 0.9 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode among the reported Pd-based ORR electrocatalysts to date, which was 1.8, 3.9 and 11.4 times higher than those of intermetallic Pd3Pb nanocubes, Pd3Pb dendrites and commercial Pt/C, respectively. More importantly, the intermetallic Pd3Pb nanoflowers also showed a higher durability with only 23.7% loss in mass activity after 10 000 cycles compared to the commercial Pt/C (35% loss in mass activity) due to their chemically stable intermetallic structures.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000487944000013	31513211

Furthermore, the electrocatalyst possesses superior long-term stability under acidic condition. Physicochemical measurements indicate that the homogeneous nanoparticles morphology, the unique electronic structure, and the 1T-phase are responsible for its superior HER performance.

Hemin containing Fe-N-4 macrocycle is an inexpensive and readily available natural material widely present in animal blood. Herein, an efficient and environment-friendly method for preparing hemin-based carbon material is proposed based on the characteristic of the flexible interlayer space of layered double hydroxides (LDH). Hemin (Hm) was initially intercalated into the interlayer region of LDH. Subsequently, high-temperature carbonization was used to prepare Hm-LDH-700, a material with a graphene-like 2D lamellar structure with high ORR catalytic activity. Characterization results showed that the material has a two-dimensional porous network structure and a large specific surface area (1065.79 m(2) g(-1)), which provides numerous active sites in the ORR reaction. Electrochemical tests revealed that Hm-LDH-700 exhibits greater ORR catalysis than Pt/C, with a higher half-wave potential (0.86 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), a higher limiting current density (6.21 mA cm(-2)), and a lower Tafel slope (74 mV dec(-1)).

Herein, we have rationally designed three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous catalyst of hollow nickel phosphide spheres coupled with molybdenum sulfide nanosheets (Ni2P@MoS2). Benefiting from the hollow spherical structure and the coupling effects between MoS2 and Ni2P, Ni2P@MoS2 shows superior activity for hydrogen generation over a wide pH range. It displays overpotentials of 181, 269 and 535 mV in 1.0 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M PBS, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). A series of characterization techniques demonstrate that the strong coupling interaction between Ni2P and MoS2 effectively optimizes the electronic structure of the Ni2P-MoS2 3D/2D interfaces, beneficial for regulating H* adsorption energy.

Herein, we propose a novel strategy for the fabrication of molybdenum phosphide nanoparticles (MoP NPs) anchored on porous carbon cloth (MoP@PCC) as a noble metal-free electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Benefiting from the thin and uniform coating of ultrafine molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) NPs on PCC, less-aggregated MoP NPs can be formed on PCC after thermal phosphidation, resulting in an efficient performance for HER over a wide pH range. Particularly, MoP@PCC exhibited good electrocatalytic activities in alkaline and neutral solutions with low overpotentials of 122 and 160 mV at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Additionally, MoP@PCC exhibited long-term stability and durability with continuous 10,000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles and chronopotentiometric operation over 50 h, both in alkaline and neutral solutions.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000623639900003		
J	DEXTER, SC; LIN, SH								CALCULATION OF SEAWATER PH AT POLARIZED METAL-SURFACES IN THE PRESENCE OF SURFACE-FILMS								CORROSION				48	1			50	60		10.5006/1.3315918				JAN 1992	1992	A model was developed for calculating the pH at a cathodically polarized metal surface. The model accounts for the buffering capacity and ionic strength of seawater, and it is valid in the presence of uniformly distributed calcareous, biological, or corrosion-product-type surface films. The model does not yet account for hydrogen evolution, and it cannot directly handle chemical reactions or the metabolic activities of microorganisms within the film. Calculated pH values are dependent on applied current density, film thickness, and the various diffusion coefficients. A diffusion correction factor is used to modify diffusion coefficients within the film. The model predicts increasing pH with increasing applied current density and film thickness, reaching a maximum of 9.9 at the limiting diffusion current for oxygen under quiescent flow conditions with no hydrogen evolution. Direct measurements of pH by microelectrode techniques were in agreement with model predictions at an applied current of 20-mu-A/cm2. Measured pH values were higher than calculated at 100-mu-A/cm2, the difference due to hydrogen evolution.									25	3	0	0	5	0	28			0010-9312			WOS:A1992HV95800008

This review summarizes the methods used to evolve these nuclear abundances within astrophysical simulations. These methods fall into 2 categories; evolution via rate equations and via equilibria. Because the rate equations in nucleosynthetic applications involve a wide range of timescales, implicit methods have proven mandatory, leading to the need to solve matrix equations. Efforts to improve the performance of such rate equation methods are focused on efficient solution of these matrix equations, in particular by making best use of the sparseness of these matrices, and finding methods that require less frequent matrix solutions. Recent work to produce hybrid schemes which use local equilibria to reduce the computational cost of the rate equations is also discussed. Such schemes offer significant improvements in the speed of reaction networks and are accurate under circumstances where calculations which assume complete equilibrium fail. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Harstad, Kenneth; Bellan, Josette								A model of reduced kinetics for alkane oxidation using constituents and species: Proof of concept for n-heptane								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				157	8			1594	1609		10.1016/j.combustflame.2010.02.013				AUG 2010	2010	A methodology for deriving a reduced kinetic mechanism for alkane oxidation is described and applied to n-heptane. The model is based on partitioning the species of the skeletal kinetic mechanism into lights, defined as those having a carbon number smaller than 3, and heavies, which are the complement in the species ensemble. For modeling purposes, the heavy species are mathematically decomposed into constituents, which are similar but not identical to groups in the group additivity theory. From analysis of the LLNL skeletal mechanism in conjunction with CHEMKIN II, it is shown that a similarity variable can be formed such that the appropriately scaled global constituent molar density exhibits a self-similar behavior over a very wide range of equivalence ratios, initial pressures and initial temperatures that is of interest for predicting n-heptane oxidation. Furthermore, the oxygen and water molar densities are shown to display a quasi-linear behavior with respect to the similarity variable. The light species ensemble is partitioned into quasi-steady and unsteady species. The concept is tested by using tabular information from the LLNL skeletal mechanism in conjunction with CHEMKIN II. The test reveals that the similarity concept is indeed justified and that the combustion temperature is well predicted, but that the ignition time is overpredicted. To palliate this deficiency, functional modeling is incorporated into our conceptual reduction. Due to the reduction process, models are also included for the global constituent molar density, the kinetics-induced enthalpy evolution of the heavy species, the contribution to the reaction rate of the unsteady lights from the heavies, the molar density evolution of oxygen and water, the mole fractions of the quasi-steady light species and the mean molar heat capacity of the heavy species. The model is compact in that there are only nine species-related progress variables. Results are presented comparing the performance of the model for predicting the temperature and species evolution with that of the skeletal mechanism. The model reproduces the ignition time over a wide range of equivalence ratios, initial pressure and initial temperature. (C) 2010 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Z is an electron carrier between the primary chlorophyll donor and the manganese catalytic site and is essential for enzymatic function, On the other hand, D forms a stable radical with no known role in oxygen evolution, D-. and Z(.) give rise to similar, but not identical, room temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals, which can be distinguished by their decay kinetics. A third room temperature EPR signal has also been observed in site-directed mutants in which a nonredox active amino acid is substituted at the D or Z site, This four-line EPR signal has been shown to have a tyrosine origin by isotopic labeling (Boerner and Barry, 1994, J. Biol. Chem, 269:134-137), but such an EPR signal has never before been observed from a tyrosyl radical, The radical giving rise to this third unique signal has been named M(+), Here we provide kinetic evidence that this signal arises from a third redox active tyrosine, distinct from tyrosine D and Z, in the photosystem II reaction center, Isotopic labeling and EPR spectroscopy provide evidence that M is a covalently modified tyrosine.									17	0	0	0	11	0	17			0006-3495	1542-0086		WOS:A1996VK29500027	8889170

In particular, electrocatalytic performance can be dramatically enhanced by rationally modulating the surface charge distribution with a well-tuned heterostructure. Herein, a heterostructure is constructed by NiMoO(4)nanosheets grown on an interior hollow NiS@Ni(3)S(2)nanorods framework (NiS@Ni3S2/NiMoO4). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the formed heterojunction structure leads to a tailored surface charge state of NiMoO4, with oxygen as the nucleophilic region and molybdenum as the electrophilic region, which facilitates the decomposition of urea molecules and thus significantly improves hydrogen evolution. As expected, the assembled NiS@Ni3S2/NiMoO(4)system substantially expedites urea electrolysis activity with a cell voltage of 1.40 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which is 200 mV less than the voltage of an overall water splitting system.									82	3	0	0	3	0	82			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000569873400013

Surface electrochemistry of CO2 reduction and CO oxidation on Sm-doped CeO2-x: coupling between Ce3+ and carbonate adsorbates								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				17	18			12273	12281		10.1039/c5cp00114e				2015	2015	The efficient electro-reduction of CO2 to chemical fuels and the electro-oxidation of hydrocarbons for generating electricity are critical toward a carbon-neutral energy cycle. The simplest reactions involving carbon species in solid-oxide fuel cells and electrolyzer cells are CO oxidation and CO2 reduction, respectively. In catalyzing these reactions, doped ceria exhibits a mixed valence of Ce3+ and Ce4+, and has been employed as a highly active and coking-resistant electrode. Here we report an operando investigation of the surface reaction mechanism on a ceria-based electrochemical cell using ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We show that the reaction proceeds via a stable carbonate intermediate, the coverage of which is coupled to the surface Ce3+ concentration. Under CO oxidation polarization, both the carbonate and surface Ce3+ concentration decrease with overpotential. Under CO2 reduction polarization, on the other hand, the carbonate coverage saturates whereas the surface Ce3+ concentration increases with overpotential. The evolution of these reaction intermediates was analyzed using a simplified two-electron reaction scheme. We propose that the strong adsorbate-adsorbate interaction explains the coverage-dependent reaction mechanism. These new insights into the surface electrochemistry of ceria shed light on the optimization strategies for better fuel cell electrocatalysts.									67	2	0	0	2	0	68			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000353767500038	25891363

Addition of various molecules (bovine serum albumin, egg albumin, dextrane, starch and PEG-8000) in increasing concentrations up to greater than 20% by volume decreased the rate of oxygen evolution in a linear fashion, although there were some quantitative differences between the effects of various components. The rotational correlation time of the spin label TMPN in BSA and egg albumin increased considerably in both protein solutions indicating a very significant increase of the microviscosity of these media. The results are interpreted in terms of the molecular enzyme kinetic model (MEKM) predicting that apart from microviscosity, the average mass distribution and the distance of the nearest two lattice points formed by components of the medium are also inversely proportional to both the forward and backward rate constants of the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. These observations, on one hand, lend further experimental support to the MEKM and on the other one, are consistent with the membrane hypothesis of aging which explains the loss of cell functions by an age-dependent increase of intracellular density.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			0167-4943	1872-6976		WOS:A1991GL00700009	15374429

Central to this challenge is the performance of materials. Traditionally, noble metal particles or metal complexes have been used as catalysts for many reactions. Recently, 3d transition-metal single-site catalysts (3dTM-SSCs) have emerged as potentially transformational candidates for the next-generation high-performance noble-metal-free catalysts. Designing catalysts at the molecular level can lead to a more efficient utilization of metal atoms and at the same time enhance catalytic performance under harsh reaction conditions. Despite this promise, several fundamental issues remain, in particular the structural evolution of 3dTM-SSCs during the synthesis, the molecular-level insights into the structure of the active sites, catalytic mechanisms, and the long-term cycling stability. Here, the material chemistries that facilitate the 3dTM-SSCs generation through a controlled pyrolytic synthesis are discussed, with focus on elucidating the underlying performance descriptors that can tune the catalytic properties in various critical reactions in carbon and water cycles. The current challenges and possible solutions for improving these novel catalytic materials are also highlighted.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000499289400001	31782566

Herein, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, the impacts of the coordination structure of an Fe-N-C catalyst on its catalytic activity toward the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) were explored. Our results revealed that the NRR activity on the central Fe atom can be greatly improved by its coordination with a boron (B) dopant. In particular, the computed limiting potential of the NRR on Fe-B2N2 is -0.65 V, which is the lowest among all B doped Fe-N-C catalysts, suggesting its high NRR catalytic activity. Interestingly, the introduction of B coordination can effectively modulate the interaction of the single Fe atom with the N2H* species, thus improving its NRR catalytic performance. In addition, Fe-B2N2 exhibits high NRR selectivity by effectively suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) both thermodynamically and kinetically. Therefore, the single Fe catalyst with N and B dual coordination can be utilized as a promising NRR electrocatalyst, which not only highlights the significant effect of local coordination on catalytic activity and selectivity for the NRR, but also provides a new opportunity to further develop more advanced single-atom catalysts for ammonia synthesis.									53	2	0	0	0	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000609149500047

It has been shown that H2O2 destroys the function of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in some chloroplast and Photosystern (PS) II preparations causing release of manganese from the OEC. In other preparations, H2O2 did not cause or caused only insignificant release of manganese. In this work, we tested the effect of H2O2 on the photosynthetic electron transfer and the state of OEC manganese in a native system (intact cells of the cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis). According to EPR spectroscopy data, H2O2 caused an increase in the level of photooxidation of P700, the reaction centers of PS 1, and decreased the rate of their subsequent reduction in the dark by a factor larger than four. Combined effect of H2O2, CN-, and EDTA caused more than eight- to ninefold suppression of the dark reduction of P700(+). EPR spectroscopy revealed that the content of free (or loosely bound) Mn2+ in washed cyanobacterial cells was similar to20% of the total manganese pool. This content remained unchanged upon the addition of CN- and increased to 25-30% after addition of H2O2. The content of the total manganese decreased to 35% after the treatment of the cells with EDTA. The level of the H2O2-induced release of manganese increased after the treatment of the cells with EDTA. Incubation of cells with H2O2 for 2 h had no effect on the absorption spectra of the photosynthetic pigments. More prolonged incubation with H2O2 (20 h) brought about degradation of phycobilins and chlorophyll a and lysis of cells. Thus, H2O2 causes extraction of manganese from cyanobacterial cells, inhibits the OEC activity and photosynthetic electron transfer, and leads to the destruction of the photosynthetic apparatus. H2O2 is unable to serve as a physiological electron donor in photosynthesis.									25	1	1	0	21	0	26			0006-2979	1608-3040		WOS:000224314900015	15377275

Nevertheless, the oxygen redox reactions at the air cathode are highly sluggish in kinetics to induce poor energy efficiency and limited cycling lifespan. Air cathodes with asymmetric configurations significantly promote the electrocatalytic efficiency of the loaded electrocatalysts, whereas rational synthetic methodology to effectively fabricate asymmetric air cathodes remains insufficient. Herein, a strategy of asymmetric interface preconstruction is proposed to fabricate asymmetric air cathodes for high-performance rechargeable zinc-air batteries. Concretely, the asymmetric interface is preconstructed by introducing immiscible organic-water diphases within the air cathode, at which the electrocatalysts are in situ formed to achieve an asymmetric configuration. The as-fabricated asymmetric air cathodes realize high working rates of 50 mA cm(-2), long cycling stability of 3400 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2), and over 100 cycles under harsh conditions of 25 mA cm(-2) and 25 mAh cm(-2). Moreover, the asymmetric interface preconstruction strategy is universal to many electrocatalytic systems and can be easily scaled up. This work provides an effective strategy toward advanced asymmetric air cathodes with high electrocatalytic efficiency and significantly promotes the performance of rechargeable zinc-air batteries.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000751682300001	34989032

In this paper, a zero-dimensional plasma chemical reaction kinetic model in CH4/CO2 gas mixture is constructed, with an emphasis on reaction mechanism for plasma dry reforming of methane to syngas and oxygenates. Especially, the effect of the CH4 molar fraction (5%-95%) on plasma dry reforming of methane is investigated. First, the time evolution of electron temperature and density with initial methane content is presented, and the results show that both the electron temperature and electron density vary periodically with the applied triangular power density pulse, and the higher initial methane content in gas mixture is favored for a larger electron temperature and density. Subsequently, the time evolution of number densities of free radicals, ions and molecules at different CH4/CO2 molar fraction are given. The higher the initial methane content, the greater the number densities of H, H-, H-2, and CH3, leading to insufficient oxygen atoms to participate in the reaction for oxygenates synthesis. The conversions of inlet gases, the selectivities of syngas and important oxygenates are also calculated. The conversion rate of carbon dioxide increases with the increasing methane content, but the conversion rate of methane is insensitive to the variation of methane content. As methane mole fraction is increased from 5% to 95%, the selectivities of important oxygenates (CH3OH and CH2O) are relatively low (<5%), and the selectivity of H-2 gradually increases from 13.0% to 24.6%, while the selectivity of CO significantly decreases from 58.9% to 9.7%. Moreover, the dominant reaction pathways governing production and destruction of H-2, CO, CH2O and CH3OH are determined, and CH3 and OH radicals are found to be the key intermediate for the production of valuable oxygenates. Finally, a schematic overview of the transformation relationship between dominant plasma species is summarized and shown to clearly reveal intrinsic reaction mechanism of dry reforming of methane in atmospheric nonequilibrium plasma.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1000-3290			WOS:000637968800028

However, their potential application in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) remains very challenging because metal clusters tend to drive the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. In this study, we prepared Fe-cluster sites with positive valence anchored on ordered mesoporous carbon materials for use as an efficient and durable electrocatalyst in carbon dioxide electroreduction. The as-prepared catalyst exhibits high selectivity, with a CO faradaic efficiency of higher than 98% at a low overpotential of 0.37 V, and retains 98.5% of its initial selectivity after 50 h of electrolysis in 0.5 M KHCO3. In addition, the as-prepared catalyst exhibits enhanced selectivity of more than 95% from -0.5 to -0.8 V in 0.1 M KHCO3, has 98.6% CO faradaic efficiency at a low overpotential of 0.49 V, and retains 99% of its initial selectivity after 50 h of electrolysis, thus outperforming state-of-the-art Fe-N-based single-atom catalysts. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the atomic interfaces on the Fe clusters reduce the reaction barrier for the *COOH intermediate, thus contributing to the rapid transformation of CO2 molecules and resulting in excellent catalytic performance.									5	1	0	0	3	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000583614200012

However, due to the existence of scaling relations for the adsorption of reaction intermediates, there is a long established trade-off between the activity and selectivity of the catalysts, as the enhancement of catalytic activity is typically accompanied by a four-electron O-2 reduction reaction (ORR), leading to the reduced selectivity for the H2O2 production. Herein, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we reported the feasibility of several classes of important and representative experimentally achievable single-atom catalysts (SACs) toward two-electron ORR, paying attention to their stability, selectivity, and activity at the acidic medium. Starting from 210 two-dimensional (2D) SACs, we demonstrated that 31 SACs have the potential to break the metal-based scaling relations and simultaneously achieve high activity and selectivity toward H2O2 production and screened out 7 SACs with higher activity than the PtHg4 in acidic media. Especially, a noble metal-free SAC, namely, a single Zn atom centered phthalocyanine (Zn@Pc-N-4), has a remarkable activity improvement with a small overpotential of 0.15 V. Moreover, using multivariable analysis and machine-learning techniques, we provided a comprehensive understanding of the underlying origin of the selectivity and activity of SACs and unveiled the intrinsic correlations between structure and catalytic performance. This work may pave a way to the design and discovery of more promising materials for H2O2 production.									140	13	0	0	7	0	143			2155-5435			WOS:000502169900039		
J	Dunkley, Scott D.; Sharpe, Gary J.; Falle, Sam A. E. G.								Detonation shock dynamics of Type Ia supernovae								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				431	4			3429	3443		10.1093/mnras/stt422				JUN 2013	2013	The wavefront propagation of curved detonation waves in carbon-oxygen cores and helium shells of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) progenitors is determined via a detonation shock dynamics approach. A level set implementation is used to track the front, which is evolved according to intrinsic quasi-steady, quasi-one-dimensional detonation speed-curvature relationships. The effects of curvature are analysed for a number of SNIa models from the literature by comparing the results to those obtained by wavefront propagation at the local planar detonation speed. The differences can be very profound in the low-density regions where detonation models are exploited to produce intermediate-mass elements. In detonable low-density regions, the speed tends to be much lower than the planar wave analysis predicts, while the subsonic driving zone controlling the dynamics is many orders of magnitude shorter. However, the lower shock temperatures ensure that the complete reaction lengths are orders of magnitude longer when curvature effects are properly accounted. Furthermore, the material cannot be detonated in sufficiently low-density regions due to a curvature-induced extinction limit. The implications for and need to reassess the nucleosynthesis and intermediate-mass element production of SNIa detonation models is discussed.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000319479000037

In this study, low-crystallinity 2D morphology iron hydrogen phosphate material (FPO3) with thickness of 12-16 nm is obtained by an easy polyol refluxing method. Its overpotential drop-casted on nickel foam (FPO3/NF) for OER is just 309 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Through the detailed comparative analysis, its number and the intrinsic activity of active sites for OER effectively enhanced because of the two-dimensional morphology, the low crystallinity, the excellent redox activity of iron, and the more beneficial synergy between NF and FPO3. Those results also indicate that using NF as the substrate is a high-efficiency method to realize the practical application of non-self-supporting electromaterials by a simple drop-casted treatment.

We present a two-step synthesis of N-doped carbon-based ORR electrocatalysts by using an efficient thermal treatment of hydrothermally carbonized cellulose in ammonia combining devolatilization, reduction and nitrogen doping. The influence of the synthesis temperature as well as of the ammonia concentration used during the synthesis on the electrocatalytic ORR activity was analyzed using bulk- and surface-sensitive techniques. Correlation of electrocatalytic activity with structural features of the catalysts provided deeper mechanistic understanding and enabled us to optimize the synthesis conditions. The nitrogen-doped metal-free catalyst originating from the treatment in 100 % NH3 at 800 degrees C achieved a current density of -1 mA cm(-2) at 0.83 V vs. RHE positioning it among the most active noble-metal free and biomass-based ORR catalysts reported so far.									28	1	0	0	0	0	29			2196-0216			WOS:000456207200031

The intermediate products and single-phase were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD). CoTiO3 was characterized by the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum. The BET measurements indicated a small specific surface area (similar to 2 m(2) g(-1)). The microstructure, visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), showed medium grains (200-300 nm diameter), and the crystallite size (similar to 10 nm) was evaluated from the broadening of XRD peaks. The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy gave a direct optical transition at 1.88 eV, due to the crystal field splitting of Co3+ octahedrally coordinated. The electrical properties of CoTiO3 are characteristics of a semiconducting behavior with activation energy of 0.02 eV. The electrochemical characterization was undertaken to build the energy diagram of CoTiO3 which predicted the photocatalytic performance for the O-2-evolution (similar to 205 mmol h(-1)) upon visible light (27 mW cm(-2)). Indeed, the valence band (1.67 V-REH) is more anodic than the O-2 level, yielding spontaneous O-2 evolution.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000505364500002

The electrosorption of H atoms on bulk Pd appears as a reversible reaction coupled to a diffusion process which occurs within bulk Pd. The voltammetric electrodesorption of H from bulk Pd is a process under mixed control, i.e. the diffusion from the bulk and the surface oxidation of H atoms. Fast pseudocapacitive reactions are detected in the range 0.2-0.4 V associated with the adsorption of H atoms at the submonolayer level. The initial stages of Pd oxide layer formation, at ca. 0.68 V, involves two reversible stages. The Pd oxide monolayer formation is achieved at 1.25 V/RHE and is followed by the formation of a third reversible system. This system is enhanced by an excursion in the potential range of the oxygen evolution reaction. This reversible system is probably a redox system involving Pd(II)/Pd(IV) species. The voltammetric electroreduction of the Pd oxide film shows rather irreversible behaviour. Inhibition effects on the reversible adsorption of H atoms due to residual oxide species were observed as well as inhibition on loading the Pd electrode with hydrogen to form the (alpha+beta)-PdH phase. Rotating ring-disc experiments demonstrate that Pd electrodissolution in basic solutions is much smaller than in acid solutions. However, soluble palladium species are detected, especially during the formation of the fast redox systems, in the potential range related to Pd oxide layer growth.									68	1	0	0	1	1	68			0022-0728			WOS:A1995QB86500014

Here, we used a simple salt-template method to construct ultrathin graphene-like Fe/N-C nanosheets (named as Fe/GNS-1.5). During the synthesis process, NaCl crystallite serves as a rigid template of two-dimensional mesoscopic structure. Iron nitrate acts as a gas-foaming agent, which plays pivotal part in the morphology and structure of catalysts. The obtained Fe/GNS-1.5 nanosheets with a thickness of 3 nm have a large specific surface area (705 m(2) g(-1)). Benefiting from the structure advantages, Fe/GNS-1.5 exhibits a great bifunctional catalytic performance. The Fe/GNS-1.5 catalyst is employed as air cathode of zinc-air battery to examine its practical application, which presents excellent power density (156 mW cm(-2)) and favorable cyclic stability for more than 600 cycles.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-0216			WOS:000481471800020

However, the desired ORR performance in metal-air batteries is often limited by the moderate electrocatalytic activity and the lack of a method to realize good dispersion. To address these issues, herein a biomass-deriving method is reported to achieve the in situ phosphorus doping (P-doping) of carbon dots and their simultaneous decoration onto graphene matrix. The resultant product, namely P-doped carbon dot/graphene (P-CD/G) nanocomposites, can reach an ultrahigh P-doping level for carbon nanomaterials. The P-CD/G nanocomposites are found to exhibit excellent ORR activity, which is highly comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalysts. When used as the cathode materials for a primary liquid Al-air battery, the device shows an impressive power density of 157.3 mW cm(-2) (comparing to 151.5 mW cm(-2) of a similar Pt/C battery). Finally, an all-solid-state flexible Al-air battery is designed and fabricated based on our new nanocomposites. The device exhibits a stable discharge voltage of approximate to 1.2 V upon different bending states. This study introduces a unique biomass-derived material system to replace the noble metal catalysts for future portable and wearable electronic devices.									70	5	0	0	7	0	71			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000500579200001

To understand how embryonic cells are assigned either to somatic or germ line fates, we are investigating the regulation of transcripts that are abundant in only one cell type. Here we report the identity of three transcripts that are coordinately expressed at high levels in germ line cells but not in somatic cells. Surprisingly, all three transcripts encode photosynthetic chloroplast proteins (light-harvesting complex protein. oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 3, and ferredoxin-NADP(+) reductase) that are transcribed from nuclear genes. We discuss why these mRNAs might be required at high levels in germ line cells and present a hypothesis, suggested by our results, on the evolution of cell specialization in the Volvocales.									20	0	0	0	18	0	21			0172-8083			WOS:A1996VM40700012	8781179

ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations were run to investigate the chemical and structural evolution of the reacting interface between the fuel, Al, and oxidizer, CuO, between 400 and 900 K and considering interfaces with and without a pore. Results show that the initial alumina layer becomes enriched with Al and grows primarily into the Al metal at higher temperatures. The modification of alumina is driven by simultaneous Al and O migration between metallic Al and the native amorphous Al2O3 layer. However, the presence of a pore significantly affects the growth kinetics and the composition of this alumina layer at temperatures exceeding 600 K, which impacts the initiation properties of the nanothermite. In the system without a pore, where Al is in direct contact with CuO, a ternary aluminate layer, a mixture of Al, O, and Cu, is formed at 800 K, which slows Al and O diffusion, thus compromising the nanothermite reactivity in fully dense Al/CuO composites. Conversely, the presence of a pore between Al and CuO promotes Al enrichment of the alumina layer above 600 K. At that temperature, any free oxygen molecules in the pore become attached to the reactive alumina surface resulting in a rapid oxygen pressure drop in the pore. This is expected to accelerate the reduction of the adjacent CuO as observed in experiments with Al/CuO composites with porosity at the CuO-Al interfaces.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000820666000001	35699731

Production of OH center dot, evaluated as EMPO-OH adduct EPR signal, was suppressed by the enzymatic removal of hydrogen peroxide and by the addition of iron chelator desferal, whereas externally added hydrogen peroxide enhanced OH center dot production. These observations reveal that OH center dot is presumably produced by metal-mediated reduction of hydrogen peroxide in a Fenton-type reaction. Increase in pH above physiological values significantly stimulated the formation of OH center dot, whereas the presence of chloride and calcium ions had the opposite effect. Based on our results it is proposed that the formation of OH center dot is linked to the thermal disassembly of water-splitting manganese complex on PSII donor side. Singlet oxygen production, followed as the formation of nitroxyl radical TEMPO, was not affected by OH center dot scavengers. This finding indicates that the production of these two species was independent and that the production of O-1(2) is not closely linked to PSII donor side. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we conduct a thickness dependent study of sputter deposited NiO(x)films by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemistry in order to differentiate bulk oxidation from catalytic activation. We find that while catalytic activation occurs throughout the film bulk, only the upper <= 5 nm of these films are able to participate in the water oxidation reaction, a result that may be critical in the design of next generation co-catalysts to maximise performance and minimise light absorption losses.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			2398-4902			WOS:000573449300007

An efficient mass-transfer mechanism can be promoted through constructing microporous structures. In addition, introducing carbon materials as carriers to form interface interactions is beneficial for increasing electronic conductivity so as to promote the catalytic activity further. In this work, a nitrogen-doped graphene (NGO)-supported microporous nickel phosphide-nickel phosphite (Ni2P-Ni-11(HPO3)(8)(OH)(6)@NGO, Ni2P-MPH@NGO), where Ni2P nanoparticles uniformly fill the micropores of Ni-11(HPO3)(8)(OH)(6) and then are supported on two-dimensional NGO via a simple two-step method, has been studied as a novel efficient electrocatalyst for HER. Compared with carbon nanotubes and graphene as carbon-based carriers, the optimized Ni2P-MPH@NGO catalyst shows excellent HER performance with a smaller overpotential, lower Tafel slope and long-term catalytic durability under acid conditions. The results demonstrate that NGO can enhance the catalytic activity of Ni2P-MPH@NGO efficiently. The results show that the synergistic effect of the microporous structure of Ni-11(HPO3)(8)(OH)(6) and NGO effectively improves the catalytic activity of the Ni2P-MPH@NGO composite catalyst, which provides a promising strategy for the design of a new low-cost and high-efficiency HER electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000697655500001	33470984

Since metal-support interactions (MSIs) in SACs exert a substantial influence on the catalytic properties, gaining a profound understanding and recognition of catalytic reactions depends greatly on investigating MSIs both experimentally and computationally. Hence, the engineering and modulation of MSIs are regarded as one of the most efficient methods to rationally design SACs with disruptively enhanced catalytic properties. In this review, we track the recent advances in SACs from an MSI perspective. We then discuss the existing MSIs in SACs and elucidate the significant role of strong MSIs in catalytic properties and mechanisms. The challenges hindering the rational design of supported SACs with strong MSIs, which are currently still far from being completely understood and overcome, are described. In addition, the correlation between strong MSIs and electrocatalytic activities in SACs, including an outlook to increase our understanding of MSIs, is discussed. Finally, the present review provides some perspectives and an in-depth understanding of strong MSIs to advance high-performing SACs.

The ZnO nanowires played three roles: (i) ZnO acted as a template for 1D metal-organic framework (MOF) growth, (ii) in situ evaporation of Zn during pyrolysis prevented the aggregation of the carbon framework and benefited the formation of hierarchical pores, and (iii) the excess Oxygen species released from ZnO in situ reacted with metallic cobalt nanoparticles during pyrolysis, leading to the configuration of a Co@CoOx core-shell structure. The as-prepared 1D Co@CoOx/NCNTs exhibited excellent oxygen reduction reaction performance, including a high kinetic current (4.6 times better compared to 20 wt% Pt/C at 0.7 V), a low Tafel slope of 80 mV dec(-1), outstanding stability, and strong tolerance to CH3OH crossover. The assembled Zn-air batteries with Co@CoOx/NCNTs yielded high open-circuit voltage (1.52 V), superior stability (over 100 h of operation), and unprecedented rate performance that ranged from 1 to 500 mA cm(-2), while existing batteries have never achieved a galvanostatic discharge current density larger than 300 mA cm(-2). Such exceptional rate capability was ascribed to the formation of a uniform interconnected nanotube network, facilitated electron transport, and an enlarged electrochemically accessible surface area in the unique 1D porous tubular structure.									60	3	0	0	2	0	61			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000405190000011

Such etching generally uses not only metal-modified Si but also an oxidizing agent, such as hydrogen peroxide or metal ions. Pd exhibits high activity in enhancing the HF etching of Si without an oxidizing agent even under dissolved-oxygen-free and dark conditions. Electrolessly deposited Pd particles on n-type Si enhance the HF etching of Si but produce no porous layer. Patterned Pd films localize the etching under the boundary of the Pd deposited areas, and thus Pd can produce a microetch pattern on Si with a simple immersion in the HF solution. This etching reaction is explained by electron injection into the conduction band of Si due to the Pd-enhanced anodic oxidization of Si with water and the cathodic hydrogen evolution on Pd with the injected electrons.									23	0	0	0	0	0	24			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000273222700049

To date, various defect engineerings have been adopted to enhance the cohesion between graphite carbons and metallic nanocatalysts. Nevertheless, the modification of carbon basal plane has been less explored. In this work, a dual modification strategy is developed to achieve novel carbon support (denoted as NCf) incorporating both C-60 units and trace N-defects. Benefiting from the dual anchoring modes (Ru-C and Ru-N-C), ultrafine ruthenium (Ru) nanoclusters (average size: 2.26 +/- 0.38 nm) can be well-dispersed and robustly anchored on the NCf support. The optimal Ru-0.013@NCf catalyst exhibits decent catalytic activities and long-term stabilities toward both alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and aromatic nitroreduction (ANR), outperforming the individually modified counterparts. Computational studies suggest that introducing both C-60 and N-defects into carbon support leads to electron-deficient Ru nanocluster, which is critical for not only HER but also ANR. This work thus provides a new guideline for rational design of advanced carbon supported nanocatalysts for multipurpose applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-7350			WOS:000726298200001

Cyclic voltammetry, potentiostatic step, and galvanostatic discharge experiments were performed and interpreted in terms of a macroscopic model treating the simultaneous mass transfer, kinetic, and thermodynamic phenomena occurring within the cell. The side reaction, oxygen evolution, exhibited irreversible Tafel behavior, with a proton concentration-dependent exchange current density of 4.5 x 10(-9) [(c(0) - c)/c(0)] A/cm(2) on pure nickel hydroxide films, and a constant exchange current density of 4.5 x 10(-9) A/cm(2) on cobalt hydroxide-containing nickel hydroxide films. The apparent anodic transfer coefficient for the oxygen reaction is 0.49 on pure nickel hydroxide films and 0.42 on cobalt hydroxide-containing nickel hydroxide films. The intercalation reaction is described with a Butler-Volmer-type expression with a large, proton concentration-dependent exchange current density of 9.5 x 10(-2) [c(c(0) - c)](1/2) A/cm(2), and anodic and cathodic apparent transfer coefficients of 0.5 for both electrode types. Here c and c(0) have units of mol/cm(3). The proton diffusion coefficient in pure nickel hydroxide was found to depend on the proton concentration, with values ranging from 1.2 x 10(-13) to 1.9 x 10(-12) cm(2)/s with a concentration-averaged value of 3.417 x 10(-13) cm(2)/s. In cobalt hydroxide-containing nickel hydroxide, the values ranged from 2 x 10(-13) to 1.9 x 10(-12) cm(2)/s, with a concentration-averaged value of 8.402 x 10(-13) cm(2)/s.									40	2	0	0	1	0	41			0013-4651			WOS:000076620600026

Nevertheless, most reported Fe-N-C materials suffer from inefficient Fe-based nanoparticles and low-density Fe-N-x sites. Herein, a Zn/g-C3N4-mediated dual-template strategy was employed to synthesize densely populated atomic Fe-N-x center-embedded N-doped carbon nanosheets (SAs-Fe/N-CNSs) with adjustable porous structures by the simple pyrolysis of d-glucosamine/FeZn/g-C3N4 complexes. g-C3N4 works as a structure-guiding 2D template and offers abundant coordination-N trapping sites for anchoring Fe atoms, simultaneously. ZnCl2 serves as a self-sacrificial template creating a hierarchical porous structure by its volatilization as well as hinders the agglomeration of Fe atoms by spatial segregation during pyrolysis. Due to the high-density atomic Fe-N-x moieties, unique 2D structure, hierarchical porosity, and large surface area, the optimal SAs-Fe/N-CNS catalyst exhibits satisfying ORR performance including excellent activity (E-1/2 = 0.91 V) and desirable durability, surpassing the Pt/C catalyst. Additionally, the superb performance of SAs-Fe/N-CNS-based Zn-air batteries with a maximum power density of 157.03 mW cm(-2) verifies their promising application in practical electrochemical systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000714700100001

Pyrolysis was performed on four different coals of varying bituminous rank (Utah Sufco, Wyoming PRB Black Thunder, Illinois #6, and West Virginia Flying Eagle), with SGR temperatures ranging from 800 to 900 C and nominal SGR gas-phase residence times from 1 to 2.5 s. The oxygen content, aliphatic content, and molecular weight distributions of the coal tar samples were measured to indicate the changes with increasing levels of SGR, and microscopy was also used to measure changes in anisotropy formation in the resulting pitch samples. Generally, for all coals tested, increased levels of pyrolysis SGR led to decreased oxygen and aliphatic content, increased molecular weight sizes, and improved anisotropy formation. However, it was clear that the extent of these property changes depended on the chemistry and rank of the starting coal feedstock. Despite the relatively high rank of the Illinois #6 coal, its respective pitch samples performed poorly in improving anisotropy formation, due to its high sulfur content. The PRB, Sufco, and Flying Eagle coals performed better in their anisotropy formation than Illinois #6, depending on their respective coal ranks. Statistical analysis (analysis of variance, ANOVA) performed on the sample characterization data also suggests that SGR temperature is consistently the most dominant and significant effect on the resulting coal products.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0165-2370	1873-250X		WOS:000812360100007

Understanding the percolation of the produced water at the cathode catalyst layer (CL), is critical for any robust water management technique. The CL consists of a complex structure to allow reactants to pass through and reach the reaction catalyst site. The complex structure is made by a support structure (mostly carbon) that allows the transport of electrons, an ionomer that conducts protons, and voids that have the double role of oxygen breathing and exit paths for the generated water. In this work, a pseudo-Hele-Shaw experimental setup is used to investigate immiscible fluid displacement inside the CL under controlled conditions. Since water can be retained by ionomer, making it swell and caused a shift in the pore size distribution, fluorinert is used as a working fluid. The evolution of percolation pressure and the projected area of the injected fluid are recorded simultaneously.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1938-5862			INSPEC:20439282

Furthermore, the behavior mechanism of kaolin capturing alkali metal was also studied from the perspective of mineral microstructure features. The results show that the melting temperature of Zhundong high alkali coal ash have rapid rise first and then gradually decreased with the amounts of kaolin increasing. When the adding proportion of kaolin is greater than 10%, the improving efficiency on the ash melting temperature become weakened. Once kaolin was added in Zhundong high alkali coal, anorthite, anhydrite, albite, and muscovite would be generated among the temperature range from 1000 to 1200 degrees C, Na+ or K+ that easy to volatile and form eutectics have been captured by the Si-Al system, some mullite generated among the temperature range from 1200 to 1300 degrees C. Investigating the capture mechanism, it indicates that O (26) and O (22) have electrophilic reaction with Na+ and K+ easily, which would promote the rupture of aluminum oxygen bonds. The O2- of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal oxide would easily have nucleophilic reaction with Si (6) and Si (8) and prompt the rupture of bridging oxygen bonds (Si-O-Si). Kaolinite would be transformed into high melting point minerals that contain Na+ or K+ which have trend to form eutectics or evaporate into the flue gas easily, and the degree of fouling and slagging on the heating surface can be reduced based on the two easiest reaction paths.									25	4	0	0	0	0	27			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000383641000096

The low stability of molecular complexes in acids limits their industrial exploitation as anodes in water-splitting devices, where high current densities and proton conductivity are required. Herein, an existing Co(1,10-phenanthroline)(2) complex film is engineered to improve its pH-stability via extra OH substituents on the ligand, i.e. 1,10-phenanthroline4,7-diol. This novel Co(1,10-phenanthroline-4,7-diol)(2) complex film is active for water oxidation at low overpotentials and stable at low pH. Since the calculated water oxidation overpotentials of both complexes are similar, the difference in water oxidation activity is attributed to a smaller charge transfer resistance, which originates from a different anchoring style to the electrode via the OH groups of the ligand. This result is supported by electrochemical impedance measurements. The high pH-stability of the Co(1,10-phenanthroline-4,7-diol)(2) film is computationally rationalized by a high crystal formation energy observed in DFT calculations. In summary, an acid-stable and active cobalt-based metal-organic film is reported that competes well with most reported earth-abundant catalysts for water oxidation under similar conditions.

A steady-state HOR current is observed during RDE voltammetry at overpotentials >50 mV but an additional plateau is observed in the overpotential region 50-200 mV when using UMEs. The difference in voltammetric responses is attributed to higher rates of mass transport to the UMEs than to the RDE. Three models have been used to fit the experimental data. The first is a dual-pathway model, which assumes that the Tafel-Volmer and Heyrovsky-Volmer pathways are both active over the potential range of interest and no blockage of catalytic sites occurs during the reaction. The second is a dual-pathway model, which assumes that reaction intermediates block access of H-2 to catalytic sites. The third is based on the premise that underpotential-deposited hydrogen atoms ((Hupd)) can block adsorption and electrooxidation of H-2 at the Pt surface. While each model fits the polarization curves reasonably well, detailed analysis suggests that the H-upd-blocking model describes the responses better. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate the advantages of UME voltammetry over RDE voltammetry for studying electrocatalytic reactions in PILs, and the first to show that H-upd can inhibit an electrocatalytic reaction in an ionic liquid, a factor that may become important as the technological applications of these liquids increase.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1932-7447			WOS:000377239000019

In this study, we improve the standard BBN calculations taking into account new nuclear physics analyses and enlarge the nuclear network up to sodium. This is, in particular, important to evaluate the primitive value of CNO mass fraction that could affect Population III stellar evolution. For the first time we list the complete network of more than 400 reactions with references to the origin of the rates, including approximate to 270 reaction rates calculated using the TALYS code. Together with the cosmological light elements, we calculate the primordial beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen nuclei. We performed a sensitivity study to identify the important reactions for CNO, Be-9, and boron nucleosynthesis. We re-evaluated those important reaction rates using experimental data and/or theoretical evaluations. The results are compared with precedent calculations: a primordial beryllium abundance increase by a factor of four compared to its previous evaluation, but we note a stability for B/H and for the CNO/H abundance ratio that remains close to its previous value of 0.7 x 10(-15). On the other hand, the extension of the nuclear network has not changed the Li-7 value, so its abundance is still 3-4 times greater than its observed spectroscopic value.									154	4	0	0	3	0	156			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000298666400078

Zirconium containing ions including Zr+, ZrO+, ZrO2H+, ZrO3H3+, and ZrO4H5+ were clearly observed in the plasma, and ions of higher zirconium oxidation states become progressively favored at higher O-2-to-ZTB carrying Ar flow rate ratio (O-2/Ar), increased chamber pressure, and decreased microwave power. The average oxidation state calculated from the partition of ZrOxHy+ varied from 0.5 to 2.1 in the process range covering O-2/Ar of 0 to 4, pressure of 5 to 40 mTorr, and power of 150 to 700 W. Based on the QMS analyses, we proposed two main opposing reaction paths responsible for the complex gas phase reactions, i.e., serial dissociations and serial oxidations. The increase in the electron temperature and density resulted in the shift of ZrOxHy+ to lower oxidation states by enhancing the dissociation of Zr=O bond and by depleting oxygen through gas phase reactions. The repartitioning of the ZrOxHy+ species was also contributed by their different Zr=O dissociation energies. To ascertain the effect of various process variables, we monitored the time evolutions of O-2(+) and ZrOxHy+ intensities as we abruptly change a process variable: the chemical effect (O-2/Ar) led to gradual changes in their intensities, whereas physical effects (pressure and power) caused an abrupt step change in accordance with an instant response of the plasma electrons.

PCC 6803. In thylakoids isolated from such a system, the degree of loss of the 695-nm fluorescence emission maximum at 77 K compared to that at 685 nm generally was consistent with the decrease in oxygen evolution rates measured at saturating light intensity. Taking into account that in the absence of CP47 and PS I some chlorophyll remains detectable in cells, the relative 695-nm fluorescence emission and the rate of oxygen evolution also correlate with the relative amount of chlorophyll per cell and with the number of PS II reaction centers on a chlorophyll basis. Interestingly, the 77 K fluorescence excitation spectra monitoring 695-nm emission of thylakoids from the CP47 His-to-Tyr mutants in a photosystem I-less/apcE(-) background showed increases in the 413- and 531-nm absorption regions, compared to spectra of thylakoids from the background strain. These wavelengths coincide with absorption maxima of pheophytin. No increase in the 531-nm excitation band was observed in thylakoids from mutants lacking PS II or with a His-to-Asn mutation. These results are interpreted to indicate that replacement of conserved histidine residues by tyrosine in CP47 leads to the loss of Mg2+ from chlorophyll, resulting in the formation of pheophytin, or to the binding of pheophytin (rather than chlorophyll) at a particular pigment-binding site of CP47 during biogenesis and assembly of the protein. It was observed that the light-harvesting efficiency of CP47 His mutants was lower judging from the light intensity dependence of electron transport and analysis of fluorescence decay kinetics. This suggests that the presence of pheophytin in the antenna decreases antenna efficiency.									54	0	0	0	39	0	55			0006-2960			WOS:A1994NT32800044	8003503

In this contribution, we examined high-pressure/high-temperature phases of beta-FeO1-x(OH)(1+x)Cl-x with x = 0.12 (beta-FeOOH) and their catalytic activities of water oxidation, i.e., oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Under pressures above 6 GPa and temperatures of 100-700 degrees C, beta-FeOOH transformed into epsilon-FeOOH, as in the case of alpha-FeOOH. However, the established pressure-temperature phase diagram of beta-FeOOH differs from that of alpha-FeOOH, probably owing to its open framework structure and partial occupation of Cl- ions. The OER activities of epsilon-FeOOH strongly depended on the FeOOH sources, synthesis conditions, and composite electrodes. Nevertheless, one of the epsilon-FeOOH samples exhibited a low OER overpotential compared with alpha-FeOOH and its parent beta-FeOOH, which are widely used as OER catalysts. Hence, epsilon-FeOOH is a potential candidate as a next-generation earth-abundant OER catalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2046-2069		WOS:000601124900015	35516263

The present work explores the electrocatalytic performance of morphologically varied CdS NPs synthesized using different sulphur source and ionic liquids via hydrothermal treatment, in catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The hierarchical flower shaped morphology denoted as CdS-N3 outperformed other prepared electrocatalysts with a Tafel slope value of 118 mV dec(-1) and a low overpotential 344 mV @ a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). However, the outperformed CdS-N3 catalyst when blended with N doped rGO, it showed a superior activity with a low overpotential of 201 mV at 10 mA/cm(2). The catalyst disclosed a small Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1) corroborating that the catalyst contains more electroactive sites and oxygen vacancy voids for the adsorption-desorption of charge carriers generated from the heteroatom doping. The CdS/N-rGO catalyst also revealed a higher TOF value of 5.18 x 10(-3) s(-1), which further proves that catalyst is more efficient in releasing H-2 molecules and this findings affirms that CdS/N-rGO catalyst can be an efficient candidate for initiating HER kinetics with endurable stability in acidic medium for high purity hydrogen production.

Here we report a novel type of robust cobalt-nitrogen/carbon catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that is prepared by the pyrolysis of cobalt-N-4 macrocycles or cobalt/o-phenylenediamine composites and using silica colloids as a hard template. We identify the well-dispersed molecular CoNx sites on the carbon support as the active sites responsible for the HER. The CoNx/C catalyst exhibits extremely high turnover frequencies per cobalt site in acids, for example, 0.39 and 6.5 s(-1) at an overpotential of 100 and 200 mV, respectively, which are higher than those reported for other scalable non-precious metal HER catalysts. Our results suggest the great promise of developing new families of non-precious metal HER catalysts based on the controlled conversion of homogeneous metal complexes into solid-state carbon catalysts via economically scalable protocols.									484	15	1	0	45	0	484			2041-1723			WOS:000360351000002	26250525

However, metal-based catalysts suffer from high cost, low selectivity, poor durability, susceptibility to gas poisoning and have a detrimental environmental impact. In 2009, a new class of catalyst based on earth-abundant carbon materials was discovered as an efficient, low-cost, metal-free alternative to platinum for oxygen reduction in fuel cells. Since then, tremendous progress has been made, and carbon-based metal-free catalysts have been demonstrated to be effective for an increasing number of catalytic processes. This Review provides a critical overview of this rapidly developing field, including the molecular design of efficient carbon-based metal-free catalysts, with special emphasis on heteroatom-doped carbon nanotubes and graphene. We also discuss recent advances in the development of carbon-based metal-free catalysts for clean energy conversion and storage, environmental protection and important industrial production, and outline the key challenges and future opportunities in this exciting field.									899	65	1	0	56	0	906			2058-8437			WOS:000394514200004

Based on XPS and Raman data, we show that the nanolattice of W-BiVO4 and Zr-BiO4 can be controlled to achieve optimal O-2 evolution from H2O photocatalysis. A synergistic effect is found between the W- and Zr-doping level in correlation with the Vo-concentration. FSP- made W-BiVO4 show optimal photocatalytic O-2-production from H2O, up to 1020 mu mol/(g x h) for 5%W-BiVO4, while the best performing Zr-doped achieved 970 mu mol/(g x h) for 5%Zr-BiVO4. Higher W-or Zr-doping resulted in deterioration in photocatalytic O-2-production from H2O. Thus, engineering of FSP-made BiVO4 nanoparticles by precise control of the lattice and doping-level, allows significant enhancement of the photocatalytic O-2-evolution efficiency. Technology-wise, the present work demonstrates that flame spray pyrolysis as an inherently scalable technology, allows precise control of the BiVO4 nanolattice, to achieve significant improvement of its photocatalytic efficiency.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10				2079-4991		WOS:000622878200001	33669461

To learn more about the elementary steps of MoS2 production by sputtering in the presence of dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), the reactions of Mo-x(+), x = 1-3, with DMDS are studied by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and density functional theory calculations. A rich variety of products composed of molybdenum, sulfur, carbon and hydrogen was observed. MoxSy+ species are formed in the first reaction step, together with products containing carbon and hydrogen. The calculations indicate that the strong Mo-S bonds are formed preferentially, followed by Mo-C bonds. Hydrogen is exclusively bound to carbon atoms, i.e. no insertion of a molybdenum atom into a C-H bond is observed. The reactions are efficient and highly exothermic, explaining the rich chemistry observed in the experiment.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000428065700003	31258300

Herein, (Ni, Co)(3)S-4 nanosheets have been decorated on metal--organic framework (MOF)-derived straw-bundle-like CeO2 assembled by one-dimensional (1D) nanorods to form a CeO2@(Ni, Co)(3)S-4 heterostructure. Such a heterostructure shows a high specific capacitance of 1319F/g at a current density of 1 A/g and an outstanding rate performance (85.2%) when the current density is increased to 10 A/g. In addition, the CeO2@(Ni, Co)(3)S-4 is assembled into an asymmetric cell, which displays a maximum energy density of 34.2 Wh/kg at a power density of 849.2 W/kg along with excellent cycling stability (84.8% of initial capacitance is retained after 10,000 cycles). The outstanding electrochemical performance of the electrode material is ascribed to the merits of CeO2@(Ni, Co)(3)S-4 heterostructure. The MOF-derived porous 1D CeO2 nanorods can afford large accessible electroactive surface area and rapid electron transfer pathways. The strong electronic interaction between CeO2 and (Ni, Co)(3)S-4 promotes surface reaction kinetics, and the abundant oxygen vacancies increase electronic conductivity of electrode and OH-capture. The rich valence states boost the specific capacitance by complex redox reactions. Besides, the core-shelled structure ensures robust mechanic stability. The present synthesis strategy can be used to prepare various heterostructures as electrode materials for SCs and electrolysis.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000792576400002

Using a heat treatment temperature of 950degC, followed by an acid leaching and second heat treatment step, Mn-PANI-KJ catalysts are found to provide onset and half-wave potentials of ca. 0.90 and 0.77 V vs. RHE, respectively, in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. After 5,000 cycles of electrochemical durability testing, Mn-PANI-KJ demonstrates a half-wave potential loss of only ca. 20 mV, superior to the 80 mV loss for our previously developed iron (Fe)-PANI-KJ catalyst. Increased surface nitrogen concentrations and relative ratios of pyridinic to graphitic nitrogen species were observed at increased Mn-PANI-KJ preparation temperatures, along with the evolution of graphene-like and graphitic nanoshell structures.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1938-6737			INSPEC:15478646

In contrast to conventional layered oxide cathodes (LiTMO2, TM denotes transition metal), invoking oxygen redox by increasing the chemical ratio of Li/O in oxide cathode can further boost the development of new types of high-capacity cathodes which theoretically enable the realization of LIBs of above 400 Wh/kg and are even attainable for 600 Wh/kg, meeting the future demands of various application scenarios for high energy density, such as electrical aircraft. However, the revolution of high-capacity cathodes is far from the realistic elevation of cell-level energy density and their practical applications in LIBs, which involves the considerations of other indispensable metrics in terms of both materials and technologies. Therefore, in this perspective, an in-depth discussion from fundamentals to applications of oxygen-based cathode materials is provided. First, we briefly summarized the representative investigations on oxygen redox mechanisms. Moreover, intrinsic properties of materials based on oxygen redox are multidimensionally evaluated. Furthermore, cell-level gravimetric energy density, potentials for practical applications, and possible design strategies are critically analyzed.

Enormous efforts have been devoted toward the exploration of water oxidation catalysts (WOCs), including homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Recently, Cu-based WOCs have been widely developed because of their high abundance, low cost, and biological relevance. However, to the best of our knowledge, no review has been made so far on such types of catalysts. Thus, we have summarized the recent progress made in the development of homogeneous and heterogeneous Cu-based WOCs for electrochemical catalysis. Furthermore, the evaluations of catalytic activity, stability, and mechanism of these catalysts are carefully concluded and highlighted. We believe that this review can summarize the current progress in the field of Cu-based electrochemical WOCs and help in the design of more efficient and stable WOCs.									49	0	0	0	5	0	49			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000531408100053	32022815

The number of transfer electrons in ORR at the WS2/C nanocomposite electrode is 3.70, which is close to four-electron process. Besides, the current density of WS2/C nanocomposites remained at 90% after 20,000 s, indicating its superior electrochemical stability.

However, the influence of crystal structure of a photocatalyst on its photocatalytic performance has been seldom investigated so far. Herein, to probe the relationship between crystal structure and photocatalytic properties, two bismuth iodates, the centrosymmetric (CS) monoclinic Bi(IO3)(3) and noncentrosymmetric (NCS) orthorhombic BiOIO3 are employed as the models. The photocatalytic reduction and oxidation capabilities of Bi(IO3)(3) and BiOIO3 were surveyed by monitoring the CO2 reduction and oxygen activation reactions. The results revealed that BiOIO3 shows far superior photocatalytic activity than Bi(IO3)(3), which can more efficiently convert CO2 into CO and produce larger amounts of .O-2(-) and OH. The experimental characterizations and DFT calculations co-uncovered that much more efficient charge separation and migration occur in BiOIO3 in compared to Bi(IO3)(3), which are responsible for the obviously higher photoactivity of BiOIO3. This is mainly due to that the NCS crystal structure of BiOIO3 that gives rise to a large macroscopic polarization, facilitating the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The microscopic first hyperpolarizability for BiOIO3 was calculated to be 2.56 X 10(-30) esu for the dominant component at the static limit and 15.73 x 10(-30) esu at the wavelength 409.1 nm, which well verifies the strong polarization of BiOIO3. This study may furnish the perspective into designing high-performance photocatalytic materials on the basis of crystal structure engineering.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000441400000016

Herein, we successfully synthesize Co- and defect-rich carbon nanofibers (CNFs) using an efficient heat treatment approach involving the pyrolysis of electrospun fibers at 370 degrees C under air. The heat treatment process produces Co-decorated CNFs with a high Co mass ratio, enriched pyridinic N, Co-pyridinic N-x clusters, and defect-rich carbon structures. The synergistic effects from composition and structural changes in the designed material increase the number of catalytically active sites for the ORR in an alkaline solution. The prepared Co-and defect-rich CNFs exhibit excellent ORR activities with a high ORR onset potential (0.954 V vs. RHE), a large reduction current density (4.426 mA cm(-2) at 0.40 V), and a nearly four-electron pathway. The catalyst also exhibits a better long-term durability than commercial Pt/C catalysts. This study provides a novel hybrid material as an efficient ORR catalyst and important insight into the design strategy for CNF-based hybrid materials as electrochemical electrodes.

When thylakoids were heated at 2 degrees C/min from 25 to 50 degrees C, the oxygen evolving complex became inhibited between 32 and 45 degrees C, whereas the acceptor side of PS II tolerated higher temperatures. Variable Chl a fluorescence decreased more slowly than oxygen evolution, suggesting that transitions between some S-states occurred even after heat-induced inhibition of the oxygen evolving activity. 77 K emission spectroscopy reveals that heating does not cause detachment of the light-harvesting complex II from PS II, and thus the heat-induced increase in the initial F-0 fluorescence is due to loss of exciton trapping in the heated PS II centers. Redox titrations showed a heat-induced increase in the midpoint potential of the Q(A)/Q(A)(-) couple from the control value of -80 mV to +40 mV at 50 degrees C, indicating a loss of the reducing power of Q(A)(-). When its driving force thus decreased, electron transfer from Q(A)(-) to Q(B) in the PS II centers that still could reduce Q(A) became gradually inhibited, as shown by measurements of the decay of Chl a fluorescence yield after a single turnover flash. Interestingly, the heat-induced loss of variable fluorescence and inhibition of electron transfer from Q(A)(-) to Q(B) could be partially prevented by the presence of 5 mM bicarbonate during heating, suggesting that high temperatures cause release of the bicarbonate bound to PS II. We speculate that both the upshift in the redox potential of the Q(A)/Q(A)(-) couple and the release of bicarbonate may be caused by a heat-induced structural change in the transmembrane D1 or D2 proteins. This structural change may, in turn, be caused by the inhibition of the oxygen evolving complex during heating.									68	17	1	0	67	0	85			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000083831500004

Therefore, the performance of PtAu based catalysts with different elements, atomic ratio, and morphology was studied in methanol solution to further improve its electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the effects of Au have aroused the researchers' attention in Pt-based nanocatalysts. In this review, we summarize the controllable synthesis, mechanism, and catalytic performance of Au introduced Pt-based electrocatalysts such as PtAu core-shell nanostructures, PtAu dendrite, PtAu nanowires, self-supporting Au@Pt NPs, and Au@Pt star-like nanocrystals for the methanol oxidation reaction.

The observed rapid increases in pH here attributed to the extremely large surface-to-solution ratio.It has found that hydrogen liberation has significantly suppressed by silica, which implies that silica can work as a corrosion inhibitor. It has postulated that corrosion has inhibited by the thin protective layers formed through the silica coordination on iron surface and the subsequent olation reaction among ferrous/ferric ion and hydroxyl ion. The specific amount of silica required for corrosion inhibition was estimated to be 3.9 x 10(-10) mol Si/cm2 Fe.Silica also controlled hydrogen evolution or corrosion even under gamma-ray irradiation. It was found that dissolved oxygen enhanced the corrosion inhibition by silica in the presence of gamma-rays.									11	0	0	0	3	0	11			0010-9312			WOS:A1990FV66300004

In this study, a CFD simulation of lignite coal combustion in a pilot-scale oxyfuel test facility with a 29% oxygen feed are used to determine representative regions (pre-flame, flame, and post-flame) in which char particles are burned. Coal particle trajectories are analyzed to extract representative time-dependent boundary conditions to which char particles are exposed as they traverse the furnace. These realistic boundary conditions are then employed in a detailed, single particle char consumption model to evaluate the influence of the local environment and char conversion on the importance of the gasification reactions to the overall rate of char consumption, using apparent initial reaction rates of char oxidation and gasification in-line with the literature estimates. In the pre-flame region, gasification reactions are of little importance; in the flame region char gasification reactions should not be neglected; while in the post-flame regions, the impact of gasification depends on the particle's trajectory. When gasification is non-negligible, its significance depends on the particular char's physical, and especially kinetic, properties. As conversion proceeds, gasification reactions, when significant, can alter the location within the particle where char consumption occurs, further affecting the rate of char consumption. Their impact can induce structural changes that may accelerate conversion via peripheral fragmentation. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We report the controlled on-surface synthesis of stable corrole radicals on Ag(111) via site-specific dehydrogenation of a pyrrole N-H bond in the 5,10,15-tris(pentafluoro-phenyl)-corrole triggered by annealing at 330 K under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions. We reveal a thermally induced regioselective cyclization reaction mediated by a radical cascade and resolve the reaction mechanism of the pertaining cyclo-defluorination reaction at the single-molecule level. Via intramolecularly resolved probing of the radical-related Kondo signature, we achieve real space visualization of the distribution of the unpaired electron density over specific sites within the corrole radical. Annealing to 550 K initiates intermolecular coupling reactions, producing an extended pi-conjugated corrole system.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000398014900105	28212484

The pyrene-based polymer (PyP), as one of the conjugated polymers, holds a great potential for water splitting because of their suitable band structure, visible light absorption, and high surface area. However, because of the fast charge carrier recombination confined by Frenkel excitons with high exciton binding energy, PyP in its pristine form remains barely active for photoctalytic hydrogen evolution. The concise construction of heterojunction is a feasible way to accelerate the charge separation, increase the lifetime of the photogenerated e(-)/h(+) pair and decrease the activation barriers of hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, a series of transition metal sulfides as cocatalysts have been deposited on PyP to construct heterojunctions for photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction (HER). The loading techniques (immersion, in-situ and photodeposition) and the loading contents of cocatalysts have been investigated. The optimized MoS2/PyP sample exhibited a 10-fold increase in comparison with pure PyP without modification. The extended pi-conjugation, high surface area, and widely exposed 2D interface highlight the importance of PyP as effective supports for stabilizing the homogeneously dispersed MoS2, thereby resulting in an efficient photocatalytic activity. This study provides a new idea to construct low-cost, sustainable and efficient hybrid system for photocatalytic hydrogen production.									45	3	0	0	3	0	45			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000468014400011

Oxygen deficient (O-V) metal oxides stand out as one of the efficient interfaces for water oxidation, nevertheless, the influence of volume of O-V on their electrocatalytic efficiency has not been described yet. To resolve this issue, we establish a facile and low-temperature protocol for the fabrication of core-shell N-carbon@NiFe2O4 nanospheres (NC@NFO) with precisely controlled O-V to boost the kinetics of OER and HER. Here, dopamine was used to introduce the N-doped carbon and O-V defects in the NFO simultaneously. Furthermore, the ratio of O-V can be tuned by the simply varying the reaction time, thus the number of active spots and the catalytic performance has been tuned. By virtue of its unique core-shell nanostructure, larger specific surface area, abundant oxygen vacancies, and excellent synergistic effect of N-carbon and NFO, the NC@NFO-O-V-rich achieved current density of 100 mA/cm(2) at a very low overpotential of 230 and 200 mV for OER (Tafel slope 42 mV/dec) and HER (Tafel slope 59.6 mV/dec), respectively, superior than most stated noble/non-noble metal-based catalysts. Also, NC@NFO-O-V-rich exhibited an exceptional overall water splitting performance with low driving voltage of >= 1.45 V, current density of 10 mA cm(-2) has achieved at a very low cell voltage of 1.47 V in 1 M KOH with insignificant activity deterioration over 12 h, which is among topmost activities described. Present work not only provides a novel and facile technique to construct N-doped carbon decorated metal oxides with abundant O-V but also discovers their prospects as dual-functional electrocatalyst toward overall water splitting.									24	0	0	0	5	0	24			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000623294200002

Here, we designed cost-effective wide-spectrum Zn2In2S5/W18O49 composite with enhanced photocatalytic performance based on a dual-channel charge transfer pathway. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of Z-scheme heterostructure and unique LSPR effect, the interfacial charge-carriers transfer rate and light-absorbing ability of Zn2In2S5/W(18)O(49 )were enhanced significantly under visible and NIR (vis-NIR) light irradiation. More reactive oxygen species (ROS) were formed by efficient molecular oxygen activation, which were the critical factors for both Escherichia coli (E. coli) photoinactivation and tetra-cycline (TC) photodegradation. The enhancement of molecular oxygen activation (MOA) ability was verified via quantitative analyses, which evaluated the amount of ROS through degrading nitrotetrazolium blue chloride (NBT) and p-phthalic acid (TA). By combining theoretical calculations with diverse experimental results, we proposed a credible photocatalytic reaction mechanism for antibiotic degradation and bacteria inactivation. This study develops a new insight into constructing promising photocatalysts with efficient photocatalytic activity in practical wastewater treatment. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Complementary series of experiments and numerical simulations are presented, which illustrate the important role of hydrodynamic instabilities and diffusive phenomena in dictating the global reaction rate in detonations. The quantitative comparison between experiment and numerics also permits identification of the current limitations of numerical simulations in capturing these effects. Simulations are also performed for parameters corresponding to weakly unstable cellular detonations, which are used for comparison and validation. The numerical and experimental results are used to guide the formulation of a stochastic steady one-dimensional representation for such detonation waves. The numerically obtained flow fields were Favre-averaged in time and space. The resulting one-dimensional profiles for the mean values and fluctuations reveal the two important length scales, the first being associated with the chemical exothermicity and the second (the `hydrodynamic thickness') with the slower dissipation of the hydrodynamic fluctuations, which govern the location of the average sonic surface. This second length scale is found to be much longer than that predicted by one-dimensional reaction zone calculations.									119	5	1	0	1	0	123			0022-1120	1469-7645		WOS:000247055900003

Attributed to intrinsic HER activity of CoNiSe2 NRAs together with effective electron-transfer and ion-diffusion pathways of N-SSCSs, the CoNiSe2/N-SSCSs nanocomposites exhibited highly stable HER electrocatalytic performances in both alkaline electrolytes and alkaline simulated seawater.

The interaction of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability and shock-induced ignition of a stoichiometric H-2-O-2 gas mixture is investigated. Different types of ignition (deflagration and detonation) are observed at the same shock Mach number of Ma = 2.30 upon varying initial pressure. Due to the convex shape of the bubble, shock focusing leads to a spot with high pressure and temperature. Initial pressures between p(0) = 0.25-0.75 atm exhibit low pressure reactions, dominated by H, O, OH production and high pressure chemistry driven by HO2 and H2O2. Deflagration is observed for the lowest initial pressure. Increasing pressure results in smaller induction times and ignition, followed by a detonation wave. The spatial and temporal evolution of the gas bubble is highly affected by the type of ignition. The Richtmyer-Meshkov instability and the subsequent Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities develop with a high reaction sensitivity. Mixing is significantly reduced by both reaction types. The strongest effect is observed for detonation. (C) 2015 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Thus, non-precious metal (NPM) catalysts, especially, for ORR, that can be utilized instead of Pt-based catalysts, have been intensively studied. Herein, doped carbon nanostructures as NPM catalysts for ORR in an acid medium were synthesized using a template method with nontoxic, eco-friendly cysteine and iron (III) tetramethoxyphenylporphyrin (Fe-TMPP, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-21H,23H-porphyrin iron(III) chloride) used as carbon and doping sources, respectively. To obtain the doped mesoporous carbon nanostructure, mixtures of cysteine and Fe-TMPP with intended ratios (Cys(X)/Fe-Z) were heated under an N-2 atmosphere at 900 degrees C for 3 h. In particular, Cys2/Fe0.3/C synthesized with an appropriate ratio of cysteine and Fe-TMPP showed a relatively high specific surface area and fairly high portion of doped species such as pyridinic and pyrrolic N, thiophenic S, and Fe-N-x. Moreover, Cys2/Fe0.3/C exhibited significantly enhanced ORR activity and stability in 0.5 M H2SO4 and superior tolerance of methanol in 0.5 M H2SO4 in the presence of CH3OH.									31	3	0	0	3	0	31			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000443666000010

Physical and chemical characterizations of the sample-including Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, cyclic voltanunetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and polarization curves for single cells-were performed. The W-doped TiO2 support with various doping amounts (0, 5, 10, and 20 at.%) exhibited a single-phase anatase structure and a large BET surface area. Furthermore, with annealing at a reducing atmosphere, a phase change from anatase to rutile occurred, trace alpha-W was precipitated from the crystal lattice of the Ti0.8W0.2O2 sample, and the BET surface area decreased accordingly. On the other hand, the conductivities of the W-doped support exhibited an increasing trend, indicating a significant impact of the W dopant on the enhancement of the TiO2 conductivity. The voltammetric charge of 40IrO(2)/Ti0.9W0.1O2 (1754 mC (cm(2) mg)(-1)) was higher than that of unsupported IrO2, and 40IrO(2)/Ti0.9W0.1O2 exhibited enhanced electrochemical activity for the OER process. A single-cell performance of 1.79 V was achieved by using 80IrO(2)/Ti0.9W0.1O2 as an anode for the minimum charge-transfer resistance and ohmic resistance.

Herein, we have reported a facile synthesis protocol of Cu-Mo-O (CMO) nanowires and nanosheets on Cu foam (CMOW/CF and CMOS/CF) through a one-step reaction of Cu nanowires with (NH4)(6)Mo(7)O(24)solution directly under mild conditions. The final product morphology has been tuned by mechanical stirring. The as-synthesized CMOS/CF exhibits a low operating overpotential of 112 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)with a high electrochemical active area of 25.1 mF cm(-2)and excellent long-term stability in the 1 M KOH electrolyte. Moreover, by using the CMOS/CF as cathodic and anodic electocatalysts, a two-electrode electrolyzer capable of driving 10 mA cm(-2)at a cell voltage of 1.69 V was achieved, along with promising stability. The high performance of the CMOS/CF can be attributed to higher electrochemical area and more Mo catalytic sites induced by mechanical stirring. This work provides a facile method for the synthesis and catalytic site regulation through a simple method of low-dimensional nanomaterials for the HER with relatively high electrochemical active area and catalytic activity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000549153600020

Here we report the application of a stable non-carbon based oxygen electrode based on boron carbide supported ruthenium (Ru/B4C) for ambient LABs. LABs using Ru/B 4 C deliver a discharge capacity of 2689 mA h g(-1) and voltage plateaus of 2.7 V and 3.8 V for discharge and charge process, respectively at 0.1 mA cm(-2), which are comparable to those for Ru/B 4 C-based Li-O-2 battery (2796 mA h g(-1), 2.8 V and 3.7 V, respectively). Under limited capacity of 300 mA h g(-1), LAB exhibits 45 stable cycles, close to the 50 cycles for its Li-O-2 battery counterpart. The typical product for the first discharge for LAB is the mixture of Li2CO3 and Li2O2 with relative content ratio of 62:38, which cannot be detected after the first charge. The non-carbon based Ru/B4C oxygen electrode provides a promising approach for the stable operation of LABs in ambient air. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-RGO) meshes with enriched nano-pores were prepared through one-step and mild hydrothermal reaction, by using ammonium hydroxide as the nitrogen -dopant source. The N -RGO exhibited high enzyme-like catalytic activity and could catalyze the organic compounds to induce chromogenic reaction, such as 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), o-phenylenediamine (OPD) and 2,2'-azino-di(3-etliylbenzothiazoline sulfonic acid) (ABTS), etc. The N -RGO meshes were systematically characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Control experiments revealed that the catalytic oxidation of TMB by N-RGO was processed by an effective 4-electron transfer reaction involving oxygen. Catalytic performance indicated that the N-RGO meshes had stronger tolerance than horseradish peroxidase (HPR), which maintained catalytic activity in a wider range (temperature of 25 similar to 85 degrees C, pH value of 4-7, and NaCl concentration of 0 similar to 100 mmol.L-1). From the fitting calculation by using the Michaelis-Menten model, the N-RGO meshes generated in optimized GO concen- tration of 5 mg.mL(-1) possessed the lowest Michaelis constant (1(K-m approximate to 0.2 mmol.L-1) and the highest reaction velocity (v(max)approximate to 0.07 mu mol.L-1).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1001-4861			WOS:000599264100011

Here, we investigate the changes in the structure of nascent char during lignite pyrolysis and gasification in the entrained flow reactor under N-2 and CO2, respectively. Subsequently, we determine the selective consumption of small aromatic rings and rapid formation of oxygen-containing functional groups. In the initialization phase of gasification reaction, the condensation polymerization between the aromatic rings in char increases, which might result in the rapid decrease of the ratio of aromatic rings and aromatics with not less than 6 rings. The formation temperature of char is responsible for the char stability and the path of gasification reaction. The sensitivity to temperature of the nascent gasification char decreased in the process of non-isothermal gasification. Simultaneously, gasification kinetic parameters shows that the effect of popplycyclic reaction of benzene rings in nascent pyrolysis char due to the changes of chemical structure, which is more intense than that of structure changes of nascent gasification char.									80	2	0	0	2	0	82			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000453768500014

Co-NC catalysts were prepared by the pyrolysis of a mixture of cobalt chloride and chitosan pretreated with zinc chloride at 650, 750 and 850 degrees C, followed by washing with nitric acid and annealing at 900 degrees C. The results indicate that zinc chloride helps the complexing of chitosan with Co2+, which is also a chemical activator that generates pores, and annealing caused the evaporation of the spherical Zn metal nanoparticles formed by the carbothermal reduction of Zn ions, leading to a unique porous structure of the catalysts with spherical pores filled with spherical carbon nanoparticles formed by the growth of nitrogen-doped carbon as a result of the Co catalyst. The degree of graphitization is also improved by the Co catalyst. The Co-NC catalyst obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 750 degrees C shows the same four-electron (4e(-)) reduction of oxygen as a commercial Pt/C catalyst, and a significantly higher ORR catalytic activity, longer-term stability and better methanol tolerance than a commercial Pt/C catalyst. These are due to its large specific surface area, high contents of pyridinic nitrogen and graphitic nitrogen that disperse the Co species and its excellent electrical conductivity.									7	3	0	0	1	0	8			1007-8827	1872-5805		WOS:000630012900015

In situ nitriding and self-assembly was realized by hydrothermal synthesis using tripolycyanamide as a N source and as a structure-directing agent. After thorough characterization, it was found that the hydrogenation treatment did not damage the flower-like architecture but distorted the anatase crystal structure and significantly changed the band structure of NHTA owing to the increased concentration of oxygen vacancies, hydroxyl groups, and Ti3+ cations. Under AM1.5 illumination, the photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate on the black NHTA was approximately 1500 mu mol g(-1)h(-1), which was much better than the N-doped TiO2 nanoplates (approximate to 690 mu mol g(-1)h(-1)1). This improvement in the hydrogen evolution rate was attributed to a reduced bandgap, enhanced separation of the photogenerated charge carriers, and an increase in the surface-active sites.									65	1	0	0	4	0	65			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000386952000017	27552078

Herein, a solution-processed condensation polymerization using cyanuric chloride and piperazine as the monomers was proposed for the synthesis of a nitrogen-rich covalent organic polymer (COP). High contents of precisely tailored pyridinicN within the COP facilitate the formation of the Co/N coordination between Co ions and N species. As a result, the subsequent carbonization of the Co-coordinated COP led to the formation of the cobalt, nitrogen dual-doped porous carbon nanosheet-assembled flowers (Co/N-PCNF). The as obtained Co/N-PCNF catalyst with a nearly 4-electron oxygen reduction pathway exhibits an excellent ORR catalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.835 V comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalysts (0.865 V). Most impressively, the Co/N-PCNF catalyst displays a long-term stability and a much better resistance to methanol than the Pt/C catalyst because of its high surface area, well-defined porous structure, and homogeneous distributions of active sites within the carbon matrix. Therefore, this work establishes an operating rule for tailored synthesis of COP-derived nonprecious metal catalysts offering high activity for the ORR in electrochemical energy conversations.									41	3	0	0	1	0	42			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000455561200149	30539625

Measurements of the variable fluorescence induced by actinic illumination with continuous light led to the following results: (a) the synthetic binuclear complexes are more efficient than MnCl2 in establishing a PS II electron flow; (b) an almost complete restoration is achieved at concentrations df these complexes that correspond with an overall stoichiometry of two manganese per PS II; and (c) the electron flow restored by the binuclear manganese complexes closely resembles that of normal O-2-evolving PS II preparations in its resistance to addition of 50 mu M EDTA, while that supported by MnCl2 is practically completely suppressed at the same chelator concentration. The rate of O-2 evolution was used as a measure of the capability to function as manganese Source in reconstitution of the oxygen evolution capacity. It was found that (i) as in the case of PS II electron transport, the synthetic binuclear manganese complexes are significantly more efficient than MnCl2; (ii) with respect to the manganese concentration, the maximum effect is achieved with a mu-oxo bridged binuclear Mn(III) complex (symbolized by M-3) at concentrations corresponding to four manganese per PS II; and (iii) at all concentrations of binuclear manganese complex M-3 a significantly higher restoration of the O-2 evolution rate is achieved if the reconstitution assay contains in addition the extrinsic regulatory 33 kDa protein (PS II-O protein). The implications of these data are discussed in terms of electron donation and photoligation of the functional tetranuclear cluster of the water oxidase.									44	2	1	0	26	0	44			0006-2960			WOS:A1994PL35800025	7918442

The inhibitory effects of FCCP on the oxygen evolving complex appeared at much lower concentrations in isolated PS2 (approximately 10(-7) M) than observed previously in chloroplast membranes (approximately 10(-5) M) Thus the accessibility of FCCP to the donor side of PS2 was higher in isolated PS2 fractions than in whole thylakoid membranes. Ca2+ strongly stimulated the apparent inhibitory action of FCCP. This is in contrast to its usual protective effect against inhibition caused by reagents acting on the donor side of PS2. This peculiar effect is explained by the inhibition of electron donation from the H2O2 formed during the ADRY interaction of FCCP with the oxygen evolving complex.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0300-3604			WOS:A1991HR91800017

By adjusting the current density of electrodeposition, Ni-Co alloys with different surface morphologies like nanocones, leaf-like structures and flakes can be obtained. The HER catalytic activity has been greatly reinforced with decorated Ni-Co alloys. Meanwhile, the HER performance of nanocone Ni-Co alloys outperforms that of leaflike and flaky Ni-Co alloys. The nanocone Ni-Co alloys exhibit outstanding HER activity, only requiring an overpotential of 86.7 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), along with a low Tafel slope of 69.8 mV dec(-1) and 3.4 Omega charge transfer resistance. This nanocone electrode remains stable for 10 h of chronopotentiometric measurement. Such enhanced catalytic performance stems from the porosity and the high population of sharp edges, as well as surface oxidation/metallic states and synergistic effects between Ni and Co.

However, the sintering problem restrains its further improvement on redox reactivity and stability. In the present work, a core-shell-structured Fe2O3/CeO2 (labeled Fe2O3@CeO2) oxygen carrier prepared by the sol-gel method was studied in a fixed bed. The effect of the core-shell structure on the sintering resistance and redox performance was investigated with a homogenous composite sample of Fe2O3/CeO2 as a reference. The results showed that the Fe2O3@CeO2 exhibited much higher redox reactivity and stability than the Fe2O3/CeO2 with no CO or CO2 observed in the generated hydrogen, while the hydrogen yield for Fe2O3/CeO2 decreased with redox cycles due to serious sintering. The satisfactory performance of Fe2O3@CeO2 can be ascribed to its high sintering resistance, since the core-shell structure suppressed the outward migration of Fe cations from the bulk to the surface of the particles. On the other hand, the migration of Fe cations and their subsequent enrichment on the particle surface led to the serious sintering of Fe2O3/CeO2. The crystallite size evolution of Fe2O3 and CeO2 in redox cycles further demonstrated the higher sintering resistance of Fe2O3@CeO2. Further, the particle size distribution (PSD) results indicated the agglomeration of Fe2O3/CeO2 after cycles. In addition, the CeO2 shell could facilitate the transport of oxygen ions between the iron oxide nanoparticle core and the shell surface. Therefore, the coating of nanoscale Fe2O3 with a CeO2 shell did not reduce the redox reactivity and stability of Fe2O3@CeO2, but rather promoted it, though less oxygen-ionic-conductive CeFeO3 was generated.

Co particle sizes were examined by magnetic measurements (MMs), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). EXAFS shows that Co in the catalysts crystallizes in fee crystal lattice and that relatively small clusters are formed. The deduced average size is almost an order of magnitude smaller than that obtained by MMs and TEM, suggesting a complex morphology of Co particles. Study of size sensitivity in the Fischer-Tropsch reaction shows that intrinsic activity and chain growth probability first increase and then stabilize on increasing the particle size, thus providing a quantitative determination of the critical diameter separating these two zones, i.e., ca. 6 nm. Study of the surface species after reaction by TPH experiments indicates that (i) deactivation may be due to a loss of catalytically active cobalt; (ii) in the course of the reaction, neither formates nor acetates are detected in the catalyst; and (iii) four carbon-containing species are observed (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta). Species beta has been speculated to be the active phase of the reaction on the basis of its parallel variation with intrinsic activity. This intermediate, which is strongly interacting with the cobalt phase, does not contain oxygen atoms. The delta species might be associated with graphitic residue formation, whereas no specific role has been attributed to the gamma species.

This molecule is detected for the first time in young K-M dwarf members of an OB association. The targets are three low-mass stars (JW 22, JW 163, and JW 433) belonging to the Orion Nebula Cluster. The target stellar parameters were derived to be T-eff = 3650, 4250, and 4400 K and log g = 3.5, 3.4, and 3.6, with corresponding stellar masses of 0.4, 0.6, and 0.7 M-circle dot, for JW 22, JW 163, and JW 433, respectively. Fluorine, oxygen, and carbon abundances were derived from the HF(1-0) R9 line along with samples of OH and CO vibrational-rotational lines present in high-resolution infrared spectra observed with the Phoenix spectrograph on the Gemini South Telescope. The fluorine and oxygen results obtained for these targets, still in the pre-main-sequence stage of evolution, agree well with the general trend defined for the Milky Way disk, the latter being deduced from observations of more evolved giant stars. In addition, the carbon and oxygen abundances obtained for the studied stars overlap results from previous studies of the more massive OB stars and FG dwarf members of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We conclude from this agreement that the fluorine abundances derived for the Orion K-M dwarfs (when there is no conspicuous evidence of disks) can be considered a good representation of the current fluorine abundance value for the Milky Way disk.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000229532200037		
J	Vermaas, WFJ; Shen, GZ; Ohad, I								Chimaeric CP47 mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 carrying spinach sequences: Construction and function								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				48	1-2			147	162		10.1007/BF00041005				MAY 1996	1996	Chimaeric mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 have been generated carrying part or all of the spinach psbB gene, encoding CP47 (one of the chlorophyll-binding core antenna proteins in Photosystem II). The mutant in which the entire psbB gene had been replaced by the homologous gene from spinach was an obligate photoheterotroph and lacked Photosystem II complexes in its thylakoid membranes. However, this strain could be transformed with plasmids carrying selected regions of Synechocystis psbB to give rise to photoautotrophs with a chimaeric spinach/cyanobacterial CP47 protein. This process involved heterologous recombination in the cyanobacterium between psbB sequences from spinach and Synechocystis 6803, which was found to be reasonably effective in Synechocystis. Also other approaches were used that can produce a broad spectrum of chimaeric mutants in a single experiment. Functional characterization of the chimaeric photoautotrophic mutants indicated that if a decrease in the photoautotrophic growth rates was observed, this was correlated with a decrease in the number of Photosystem II reaction centers (on a chlorophyll basis) in the thylakoid membrane and with a decrease in oxygen evolution rates. Remaining Photosystem II reaction centers in these chimaeric mutants appeared to function rather normally, but thermoluminescence and chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements provided evidence for a destabilization of Q(B)(-). This illustrates the sensitivity of the functional properties of the PS II reaction center to mild perturbations in a neighboring protein.									9	0	0	0	9	0	9			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1996VP18700020	24271295

Thus, excited states species have been detected by optical emission spectroscopy. The population densities were determined in an absolute scale after calibration of the spectroscopic apparatus. Complementary information was obtained by detecting ground-state species using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy. Therefore, a beam expander was used to transform the dye laser probe beam in a thin plane section of 0.2 x 40 mm(2) dimension. Using a fast intensified charged coupled device for photon detection, three-dimensional number density mapping of ground-state species was possible. The LIF measurements have been calibrated by additional absorption measurements. As a result, a detailed picture of the time- and space evolution of the plasma plume from the target towards the substrate was acquired making in evidence the formation of diatomic reaction products as a result of interaction between the ablated material and the ambient gas. In order to outline the different reactivity of nitridation and oxidation processes, measurements have been performed during ablation of aluminium, graphite and titanium targets in either nitrogen and oxygen low-pressure atmospheres. The measured densities of atomic and molecular species were compared to those computed for local thermal equilibrium.					9th International Conference on Advanced Laser Technologies (ALT 01)9th International Conference on Advanced Laser Technologies (ALT 01)	SEP 11-14, 2001SEP 11-14, 2001	Minist Educ & Res; Natl Inst Laser, Plasma & Radiat Phys; Gen Phys Inst; SPIE Romania Chapter; Ovidius Univ Constanta; SPIE; SPIE Russian Chapter; Russian Minist Ind, Sci & Technol; Russian Fdn Basic Res; EOARDMinist Educ & Res; Natl Inst Laser, Plasma & Radiat Phys; Gen Phys Inst; SPIE Romania Chapter; Ovidius Univ Constanta; SPIE; SPIE Russian Chapter; Russian Minist Ind, Sci & Technol; Russian Fdn Basic Res; EOARD	CONSTANTA, ROMANIACONSTANTA, ROMANIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0277-786X	1996-756X	0-8194-4528-2	WOS:000178612300004

We designed earth-abundant, carbon-supported titanium tungsten carbide (TixW1-xC) nanoparticles decorated with surface Pt coatings ranging from the "single-atom'' to the two-monolayer regime. Reactivity studies demonstrated that sub-monolayer Pt coverages are optimal and could activate the exposed metal carbide sites for both HER and HOR at low overpotentials. Specifically, a 0.25 monolayer coverage of Pt improved the exchange current density of Ti0.2W0.8C by more than three orders of magnitude. This catalyst outperformed traditional Pt/C by a factor of 13 on a Pt mass basis, allowing for over a 96% reduction in Pt loadings. Deactivation was not observed after 10000 cycles between -50 and +600 mV vs. RHE in 1.0 M HClO4, and activity was maintained after 140000 catalytic turnovers. A technoeconomic analysis revealed that over the catalyst lifetime, this new architecture could reduce materials and energy costs by a factor of 6 compared to state-of-the-art earth-abundant catalysts and a factor of 12 compared to Pt/C.									115	7	0	0	5	0	116			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000386336200033

The best-fit circuit to EIS data of the coatings in the absence of the chlorine evolution reaction is R-s(R(ct)Q(dl)), and that in the potential range of chlorine evolution reaction is R-s(R(f)Q(f))(R(ct)WQ(dl)). The high-frequency region corresponds to the impedance behavior of the coating, and the low-frequency region to that of the interface between outer surface and electrolyte. Results show that the pseudo-capacitances of the oxide film and the double layer increase with increasing La content, reaching a maximum at the nominal La content of 30 mol%. This finding agrees with the CV result, suggesting that the La additive in suitable amount can improve the electrochemical activity of the RuO2 coating. The electric conductivity of the coatings, however, significantly decreases when nominal La content is larger than 30 mol% in the region of the chlorine evolution potential. A character with a Warburg impedance at low-frequency region suggests the relationship to passivation of the coating surface and specific adsorption, resulting in a dramatic decrease of electrocatalytic activity of the coatings at norminal La content of 70 mol%.									2	2	0	0	0	0	2			0567-7351			WOS:000305778100005

It is well known that the pore structure and heteroatoms of PCs are crucial to their functions and applications. In this study, nitrogen and sulfur-codoped mesoporous carbon materials (GCs) were facilely fabricated by carbonizing the complex of poly(3-cyanomethyl-1-vinyl imidazolium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)-imide) (PCMVIm-Tf2N) and graphene oxide (GO). After investigating the electrochemical performances of GC systematically, the as-obtained GCs were evaluated as the electrocatalysts in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results demonstrated that the optimal electrocatalysis activity for HER could be achieved when the weight ratio of PCMVIm-Tf2N and GO in the precursor was 7:1 (GC-7). Specifically, GC-7 presented the overpotential as low as 118.7 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4. Moreover, GC-7 maintains excellent long-term stability in both acid and alkaline conditions. Our results demonstrated that the superior HER catalytic activity was attributed to the large surface area and good ionic conductivity, as well as synergistic effect of heteroatoms. Therefore, GC materials are the promising electrocatalysts for the highly efficient HER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000740403500002

However, it suffers from lacking efficient and sustainable catalysts. Herein, a metal-organic framework/graphene oxide pyrolysis strategy was proposed to prepare nitrogen-doped porous carbon-stabilized alloys supported on reduced graphene oxide (PdCo@N-C/rGO) composite. When evaluated as an electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the as-obtained PdCo@N-C/rGO shows an excellent performance in acidic media including positive onset potential close to that of commercial Pt/C (vs. SCE), low overpotential and Tafel slope, as well as long-term durability. Also, it delivers outstanding HER activities in alkaline and neutral conditions. The excellent performance could be mainly ascribed to their synergetic effect among alloy particles, nitrogen-doped porous carbon shell, and conductive rGO substrate.[GRAPHICS].									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000659013500003

Here, we report the synthesis of ruthenium phosphide nanoparticles (NPs) confined into N/P dual-doped carbon by pyrolyzing self-prepared ruthenium-organo-phosphine complex using 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphadamantane (PTA) as the ligand and N/P sources. The achieved S-RuP2/NPC displayed excellent electrocatalytic activity (over-potentials of 19, 37, and 49 mV in alkaline, neutral, and acidic media, respectively, at 10 mA cm(-2)) toward HER at all pH ranges. The high performance of S-RuP2/NPC must be ascribed to the homogeneously distributed and P-rich RuP(2)NPs with the diameter of 3.29 nm on the NPC surface, which can considerably improve the atom utilization for HER. The present synthetic strategy not only avoids the use of additional N/P sources but also the generation of flammable and toxic PH3 gas. This synthetic strategy can be extended to prepare other traditional metal phosphides for electrocatalytic applications. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, bimetallic Fe-Ca oxides were synthesized to be used as oxygen carriers to promote the hydrogen production from the chemical looping gasification of rice straw. The effects of Fe/Ca ratio, temperature together with the cyclic performance of oxygen carrier were studies in terms of produced syngas distribution, solid structure evolution and the durability of oxygen carrier. Results found that two types of calcium ferrites (Ca2Fe2O5 and CaFe2O4) were formed with different Fe/Ca ratios, and Fe and Ca were uniformly distributed within oxygen carriers by wet impregnation method. Compared with pyrolysis or steam gasification, the hydrogen production was largely promoted during the steam chemical looping gasification process due to the iron re-oxidation by steam. When the ratio of Fe:Ca was1:1, the formed oxygen carrier (Ca2Fe2O5) produced the highest hydrogen yield (23.07 mmol/g biomass) at 800 degrees C, which benefited from one step reduction and oxidation properties of Ca2Fe2O5. A temperature of no less than 800 degrees C was needed for the completed redox of Ca2Fe2O5 during chemical looping gasification with steam. The cyclic stability test for Ca2Fe2O3 ( )showed that the continuously accumulated Si from biomass ash would destroy the bimetallic Fe-Ca structure to generate CaSiO3 and Fe2O3 after 3 times of cycle, and this led to the decreased hydrogen production during chemical looping gasification cycle. The great hydrogen selectivity of Fe:Ca = 1:1 (Ca2Fe2O5) makes it a suitable candidate of oxygen carrier, but the cyclic durability should be enhanced to enable a better application for chemical looping gasification conversion of biomass.									95	7	0	0	20	0	99			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000494799900105

Herein, the fabrication of ultrafine bimetallic PtNi nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanosheets (CNS) by means of in situ self-polymerization and annealing is reported. This bifunctional catalyst shows excellent performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol. Remarkably PtNi bimetallic catalyst with low metal loading (PtNi2@CNS-600, 0.074 wt % Pt) exhibited outstanding HER activity with an overpotential as low as 68 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a platinum loading of only 0.612 mu g(Pt) cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 35.27 mV dec(-1) in a 0.5 m aqueous solution of H2SO4, which is comparable to that of the 20 % Pt/C catalyst (31 mV dec(-1)). Moreover, it also shows superior long-term electrochemical durability for at least 30 h with negligible degradation compared with 20 % Pt/C. In addition, the material with increased loading (mPtNi(2)@CNS-600, 2.88 % Pt) showed robust catalytic activity for hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol at ambient pressure and temperature. The catalytic activity towards hydrogen splitting is a circumstantial evidence that agrees with the Volmer-Tafel reaction path in the HER.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000469028800018	30913325

A Rotating Disk Electrode Study								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				164	11			E3171	E3178		10.1149/2.0191711jes				2017	2017	We study the effect of H+ and OH- diffusion on the hydrogen evolution reaction in unbuffered aqueous electrolyte solutions of mildly acidic pH values. We demonstrate that the cathodic polarization curves measured on a Ni rotating disk electrode in these solutions can be modeled by assuming two irreversible reactions, the reduction of H+ and that of water molecules, both following Erdey-Gruz-Volmer-Butler kinetics. The reduction of H+ yields a transport-limited and thus, rotation rate-dependent current at not very negative potentials. At more cathodic potentials the polarization curves are dominated by the reduction of water and no mass transfer limitation seems to apply for this reaction. Although prima facie the two processes may seem to proceed independently, by the means of finite-element digital simulations we show that a strong coupling (due to the recombination of H+ and OH- to water molecules) exists between them. We also develop an analytical model that can well describe polarization curves at various values of pH and rotation rates. The key indication of both models is that hydroxide ions can have an infinite diffusion rate in the proximity of the electrode surface, a feature that can be explained by assuming a directed Grotthuss-like shuttling mechanism of transport. c The Author(s) 2017.

Generally, due to the weak poor conductivity and catalytic activity when used as OER electrocatalysts, MOFs are more likely to be used as precursors to obtain composite catalysts through further pyrolysis treatment, rather than directly applied as OER electrocatalysts. But heat treatment usually results in structural collapse and loss of active sites. Specially, as a kind of two-dimensional (2D) materials with rapid electron transfer, metal-organic framework nanosheets (MONs) have great application potential in various fields, especially in the field of catalysis, due to the advantages of both MOFs and 2D materials. Here, we have reported a simple top-down approach to synthesize Co-MONs which can be directly adopted as efficient OER catalysts. Ultrasonic bath (40 KHz, 100 W) was employed to control the exposing of the preponderant lattice plane, which can offer plentiful active catalytic sites and accelerate ions transport. The optimized Co-MONs attain 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 309 mV with a small Tafel slope of 75.71 mV dec(-1).									27	4	0	0	3	0	27			1350-4177	1873-2828		WOS:000488417100040	31479889

Between pH 6.5 and 4.0 there was a decrease in quantum efficiency of oxygen evolution that was not associated with a proportional closure of reaction centres, as determined by the fluorescence coefficient, q(P). This decrease in the quantum yield of Photosystem II appeared to be due to two separate mechanisms. Between pH 6.5 and 5.0, the decrease in quantum yield was not associated with any change in fluorescence yield or in the ratio of F(v)/F(m); the decrease was greater at limiting light than in saturating light and may be caused by a cyclic electron transfer that is associated with the destabilisation of the oxidised intermediates of the oxygen-evolving complex and an accelerated rate of Q(A)- oxidation. Below pH 5.0 the decrease in efficiency is correlated with a quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence. This quenching was light-dependent and required oxidising conditions; redox titrations indicated that a component with a midpoint oxidation reduction potential of +405 mV at pH 4.0 needed to be oxidised if the low pH-dependent quenching was to be observed. The relationship between these effects of low pH and the 'down-regulation' of Photosystem II observed under physiological conditions is discussed.									40	0	0	0	35	0	40			0006-3002			WOS:A1991FV35400012

Herein, we introduce a novel facile one-step in-situ strategy through pyrolysis for the synthesis of Co2P nanoparticles encapsulated Boron, Nitrogen, and Phosphorous tri-doped carbon nanotubes (Co2P/BNP-CNTs). The synergetic effect between Co2P nanoparticles and heteroatom doped CNTs contributes to the remarkable HER performance. The Co2P/BNP-CNT-900 electrocatalyst shows a low overpotential of 133 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 90 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 M KOH media. More importantly, the Co2P/BNP-CNT-900 electrocatalyst exhibits superior long-term stability in alkaline solution at -0.25 V versus Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE) for 15 h and up to 1000 cycles with negligible performance loss. Overall, our works suggest a one-pot facile synthesis strategy for rational designing high-performance electrocatalysts with enhanced HER performance.(C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In order to meet these factors, a novel FexNi1-xO/Bi2MoO6/Si nanowire hierarchical nanostructure was produced using a metal-assisted chemical-etching and hydrothermal growth process, in which Si nanowires were used as backbones, Bi2MoO6 nanosheets as coating, and FexNi1-xO nanoparticles (NPs) as surface catalysts. This integrated three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical nanostructure was applied as a photoanode in a PEC water reaction, and higher photostability and photocurrent density were gained. The excellent PEC performance was due to the 3D hierarchically structural effect, resulting in the enhancement of the surface-to-volume ratio, light harvest and high speed electron transport, and at the same time, terminal FexNi1-xO NPs played the role of the surface catalyst effectively in order to accelerate the water splitting reaction and enhance photostability. Based on such an environmentally friendly hierarchical nanostructure, the study provided an efficient route to improve water-splitting performance and it could also be a model structure for similar electrode materials.

The Diels-Alder cycloaddition is recognized as a plausible chemical approach, but few reports are known where this strategy has been used. In this study, the functionalization was performed by 1,3-butadiene generated from 3-sulfolene under heating conditions in diglyme. This simple and easily scalable method resulted in functionalized CNT with mass losses of 10-23% by thermogravimetric analysis (nitrogen atmosphere). The functionalization was also supported by acid-base titration, elemental analysis, temperature programmed desorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The high content in oxygen detected on the CNT surface was assigned to anhydride formation due to a cascade oxidation of the alkene groups generated in the cycloaddition reaction. The complete evolution of the alkene leads to a grafting density of 4.2 mmol g(-1) for the anhydride moiety. Ab-initio calculations in CNT model systems indicate that the Diels-Alder addition of butadiene is a feasible process and that subsequent oxidation reactions may result in the formation of the anhydride moiety. The presence of the anhydride group is a valuable asset for grafting a multitude of complex molecules, namely through the nucleophilic addition of amines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we demonstrate that a black phosphorene (BP) layer, inserted between the OEC and BiVO4 can improve the photoelectrochemical performance of pre-optimized OEC/BiVO4 (OEC: NiOOH, MnOx, and CoOOH) systems by 1.21.6-fold, while the OEC overlayer, in turn, can suppress BP self-oxidation to achieve a high durability. A photocurrent density of 4.48 mA.cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) is achieved by the NiOOH/BP/BiVO4 photoanode. It is found that the intrinsic p-type BP can boost hole extraction from BiVO4 and prolong holes trapping lifetime on BiVO4 surface. This work sheds light on the design of BP-based devices for application in solar to fuel conversion, and also suggests a promising nexus between semiconductor and electrocatalyst.									174	10	0	0	28	0	174				2041-1723		WOS:000466337500002	31043598

The adsorption of the terminal carboxyl group of these peptides occurred around + 0.3 V versus Ag \ AgCl, and the oxidative decomposition was observed from ca. + 1.0 V. A striking difference in the oxidation of amino acid and peptides was that the former reaction continued to proceed with increasing potential but the oxidation of peptides was rather restrained at high positive potentials. The major reason for such constraint was that the glycine or glycil-glycine generated in the anodic oxidation of peptides was in the acid form and its adsorption and following oxidation on the electrode became considerably difficult. Formation of the acid form of glycine or glycil-glycine was attributed to the lowering of pn which occurred because oxygen evolution occurs in further positive polarization. The EQCM data indicated that the adsorption of glycil-peptide occurred from ca. + 0.2 V, the adsorbed carboxyl group was decomposed oxidatively at ca. + 1.1 V and a part of the remaining adsorbents was detached simultaneously from the electrode with the evolution of oxygen in further positive polarization.

The morphology characterizations confirmed that the presence of AB could effectively prevent the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) from restacking in the solvothermal process, providing the abundant anchoring area for the MoS2 generated during the solvothermal process. For the as prepared MoS2/AB-rGO catalysts, a large number of amorphous molybdenum sulfide (a-MoS2) on the surface of rGO and low-crystallization molybdenum sulfide (1c-MoS2) on the surface of AB provide sufficient active sites for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). HER tests of MoS2/AB-rGO proved that the dual function of AB, both augmenting the active sites and elevating the conductivity, could be a well-founded account for its excellent HER activity. In contrast, MoS2/rGO synthesized without AB showed severe agglomeration and poor internal conductivity on account of interlamellar van der Waals's force. MoS2/AB-rGO(55) exhibits high HER performance including a low onset potential (-100 mV) and a large current density (10.0 mA/cm(2) at eta = 142 mV), indicating it is a promising electrocatalyst for HER.

Thus, improving their kinetics as well as understanding the mechanism is critically important. Herein, the strategy of utilizing unique ethylene glycol ligand environments was employed to circumvent the aforesaid kinetic limitations in the composites of Pt-loaded CoP linked by ethylene-glycol through proton concentration and hydrogen spillover. At a low Pt loading of 1.5 wt%, the catalytic performance was significantly improved with dramatically decreased Tafel slopes from 104.6 mV dec(-1) of CoP to 42.5 mV dec(-1). Control experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that ethylene-glycol concentrated hydrogen intermediates at Pt (>7.3 times), facilitated the hydrogen spillover from hydrogen-enriched Pt to hydrogen-deficient CoP and modulated the local electronic structures to afford thermo-neutral Pt/CoP interfacial sites, improving the catalytic kinetics ultimately. The composites with 1.5 wt% Pt loading delivered a low overpotential of 21 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) as well as record high noble-metal utilization activity, outperforming commercial Pt/C and other hydrogen spillover electrocatalysts for HER. This strategy may provide insights for the design of electrocatalysts.									123	6	0	0	7	0	123			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000477950000015

Herein, 3D RuCu nanocrystals (NCs) are successfully synthesized by a facile wet chemistry method, in which amorphous RuCu nanosheets are directly grown on crystalline Cu nanotubes (NTs). Importantly, the obtained 3D RuCu NCs only need 18 and 73 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)for HER in alkaline and neutral media, respectively. Density functional theory calculations and experiments reveal that the Ru sites on the surface of amorphous nanosheets are the highly active centers for HER. Moreover, this catalyst can expose more surface area for water splitting compared to pure nanosheets because the unique 3D structure can effectively prevent the aggregation of nanosheets. Meanwhile, the interface between amorphous nanosheets and crystalline NTs is essential to boost the HER performance because the amorphous phase with many unsaturated bonds can facilitate adsorption of reactants and crystalline Cu with superior conductivity can promote the transfer of electrons. This work provides a facile method to prepare an original 3D Ru-based electrocatalyst with highly active HER performance in wide pH values.									38	2	0	0	3	0	38			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000560598100001	32803830

Green hydrogen produced from water electrolyzers using renewable electricity is of great importance, and the development of efficient transition-metal-based materials for hydrogen production by electrolysis is highly desirable. In this report, a new approach to produce defect-rich and ultra-fine bimetallic Co-Mo sulfides/carbon composites from polyoxometalates@ZIF-67@polydopamine nanocubes via carbonization/sulfurization, which are highly active for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER), have been successfully developed. The coating of polydopamine (PDA) on the surface of the acid-sensitive ZIF-67 cubes can prevent the over-dissociation of ZIF-67 caused by the encapsulated phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) etching through PDA chelating with the PMA molecules. Meanwhile, the partially dissociated Co2+ from ZIF-67 can be captured by the coated PDA via chelation, resulting in more evenly dispersed active sites throughout the heterogeneous composite after pyrolysis. The optimized bimetallic composite CoMoS-600 exhibits a prominent improvement in HER (with an overpotential of -0.235 V vs. RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and OER performance (with an overpotential of 0.350 V vs. RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)), due to the synergistic effect of ultra-fine defect-rich Co-Mo-S nanoparticle active sites and N,S-codoped porous carbons in the composites. Moreover, this synthesis approach can be readily expanded to other acidic polyoxometalates to produce HER and OER active bimetallic Co-W sulfide/carbon composites by replacing PMA with phosphotungstic acid. This new synthesis strategy to modify acid-sensitive ZIFs with selected compounds offers an alternative approach to develop novel transition metal sulfide/carbon composites for various applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000766802200001	35266942

However, it is still ambiguous whether the high oxygen fugacity and the enrichment of chalcophile elements are inherited from magma source or obtained by magmatic processes, and the linkage between the high Sr/Y magmas and the formation of porphyry Cu deposits remains unclear. To address these issues, we performed an integrated study of zircon geochronology and oxygen fugacity, petrography, geochemical and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions for the Shanyang porphyry groups at an intra-continental setting from the South Qinling Orogen, Central China. The Shanyang porphyries can be divided into six groups in terms of their spatial distribution with the crystallization ages ranging from ca. 152 to 140 Ma. They are characterized by high Sr and Ba contents, consistent with the geochemical features of high Ba-Sr granitoids. They show a continuous evolution trend from mafic to felsic samples and mafic samples have high Mg#, Cr, and Ni contents, indicating that they were evolved from mantle-derived basaltic magmas. Most samples display homogeneous I-Sr(0.704 to 0.706), epsilon(Nd)(t) (-6 to -1.5) and zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) (-4 to +2) values, suggesting that they were derived from an enriched lithospheric mantle with minor crustal contamination. Geochemical results suggest that they were generated by low degree melting of a heterogeneous lithospheric mantle at spinel facies that had been modified by previous slab-derived fluids. These porphyry bodies were derived from multiple magma reservoirs within their distinct plumbing systems and had undergone polybaric differentiation. With magma differentiation, the Shanyang porphyry magmas changed from an oxidized state (Delta FMQ +1 to +2) to a reduced state (Delta FMQ +1 to -0.5). The high (Dy/Yb)(N) ratios indicate crystallization of garnet had cryptically occurred in the deep crust, which induced sulfide saturation at an earlier stage. This process could result in the deficiency of chalcophile elements and elevate the oxygen fugacity in the residual melts from a relatively reduced parental mafic magma. Degassing in the shallow crust would lead to a decrease in the fO(2) of the felsic magmas. Thus, some other processes, such as, re-melting of early formed sulfide and gas-brine reactions, are required to concentrate chalcophile elements in the felsic magmas. Our study implies that intra-crustal processes could play a more important role in the enrichment of chalcophile elements and that the oxygen fugacity of the magma system can change during magma evolution. The observations of the Shanyang porphyry groups are very helpful for understanding similar porphyry systems globally. We propose that porphyries worldwide formed in the thickened crust with long-lived magmatic hydrothermal systems in the shallower magma reservoirs are more prone to form porphyry Cu deposits.

It exhibits high electrocatalytic activity toward the HER in acidic media with an overpotential of 29.4 mV at the current density of 50 mA cm-2. The catalyst also displays efficient activity for the ORR in acidic media with a high onset potential of 0.97 V. To demonstrate the practical feasibility of the HER characteristics, we designed a new type of Zn-H2 hybrid battery for the simultaneous generation of hydrogen and electricity by asymmetric electrolysis with the acid catholyte and alkaline anolyte. The system displayed an open circuit voltage of 1.28 V along with good stability compared to that of the one built using the commercial Pt/C catalyst. This device could generate H2 gas with a Faradaic efficiency of 97% along with the generation of electricity. Moreover, the outstanding ORR activity of the FeHCNR could be validated by demonstrating an asymmetric-electrolyte Zn-air battery by employing the catalyst as the cathode, which provided an open-circuit voltage of 2.15 V and a power density of 69 mW cm-2 with the contribution of the electrochemical neutralization energy along with Zn oxidation. Thus, the FeHCNR could perform well toward the HER and ORR during the system-level demonstrations, and this advantage is mainly credited to the hollow nanorod structure of the catalyst, which provides better exposure of the active sites along the outer and inner walls of the system to facilitate the concerned reactions. The open-tube cavity structure of the FeHCNR is supportive for the simultaneous diffusion of the electrolyte and reactants along with more facile dissipation of the products.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000862805200001

Electrochemical HER can provide a cost-effective method for the clean production of hydrogen. In this study, a biomimetic eco-friendly approach to fabricate nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets, exhibiting a high HER performance, and using a carbonized polydopamine (C-PDA), is described. As a biopolymer, polydopamine (PDA) exhibits high biocompatibility and can be easily obtained by an environmentally benign green synthesis with dopamine. Inspired by the polymerization of dopamine, we have devised the facile synthesis of nitrogen-doped nanocarbons using a carbonized polydopamine for the HER in acidic media. The N-doped nanocarbons exhibit excellent performance for H-2 generation. The required overpotential at 5 mA/cm(2) is 130 mV, and the Tafel slope is 45 mV/decade. Experimental characterizations confirm that the excellent performance of the N-doped nanocarbons can be attributed to the multisite nitrogen doping, while theoretical computations indicate the promotion effect of tertiary/aromatic nitrogen doping in enhancing the spin density of the doped samples and consequently in forming highly electroactive sites for HER applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2073-4360		WOS:000535587700182	32326536

Pt catalyzes HER efficiently, however, its scarcity and high cost inspire researchers to explore metallic catalysts with core-shell nanostructures. Precise tailoring of Pt catalysts at atomic monolayer level would shed insights on the relationship between electronic structure and electrocatalytic properties. Herein, we report the preparation of Au-Pt core-shell nanoparticles deposited on graphene sheets with tunable Pt monolayer coverage by controlling Cu underpotential deposition (UPD)-Galvanic replacement cycles. The electrochemical results suggest that Au-Pt with monolayer Pt shows superior electrocatalytic activity toward HER. Increasing the thickness of Pt shell results in the decrease of the electrocatalytic activity, which might be attributed to the decreased electronic interactions of Au core with outmost surface Pt atoms as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic characterization. The present research would offer a design criterion for metallic nanostructures in realizing catalysts with high performance.									25	2	0	0	0	0	25			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000435619700057

In this work, we described the development of CoSe2 nanoparticles grown on the carbon nanofibers (CNFs) derived from bacterial cellulose (CNFs/CoSe2) through a facile one-step hydrothermal preparation, which not only showed a three-dimensional (3D) porous network structure, but also possessed large surface area. This rationally designed architecture realizes the uniform distribution of CoSe2 nanoparticles to provide with fully exposed active edges and the unique conductive interwoven carbon nanofibers facilitates the charge transportation in HER process, thus leading to remarkable HER activity. As expected, the CNFs/CoSe2 shows a low onset overpotential of -85 mV, low overpotential (eta(10) = 119 mV) for reaching a current density of -10 mA cm(-2) and smaller Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1) as well as good cycling stability in acidic electrolyte.

A two-step anodization process is used to transplant TNAs grown on titanium foils onto fluorine-doped SnO2 substrates (denoted as W-TNAs), after which they are electrochemically reduced for 20 and 90 s (denoted as B-TNAs-20 and 90, respectively). The as-transplanted W-TNAs exhibit low PEC activities in terms of their photocurrent, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxidations of inorganic and organic substrates (iodide and urea, respectively) under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5; 100 mW cm(-2)), primarily because of the sluggish charge transfer through the poor electrically conductive TNA framework. The quick electrochemical reduction of the W-TNAs leads to an 8-fold larger photocurrent, while significantly accelerating the OER (by three times) and iodide and urea oxidation reactions (by 2 and similar to 20 tithes, respectively). These enhanced PEC activities of the B-TNAs are attributed to the creation of Ti3+ and associated oxygen vacancies which strengthen their n-type characteristics and thereby increase their electrical conductivity. The time-resolved photoluminescence spectra further reveal that the lifetime (tau) of the photogenerated charge carriers in the B-TNAs (tau = 0.33 ns) is an order of magnitude shorter than that of the W-TNAs (tau = 3.63 ns). The disordered surface exhibits a lower Faradaic efficiency for multi-electron transfer oxidation reactions and a higher Faradaic efficiency for single-electron transfer oxidation reactions compared to the W-TNAs. The detailed surface characterization and PEC mechanism are discussed.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000425476800021		
J	Chen, Tao; Ku, Xiaoke; Lin, Jianzhong; Jin, Hanhui								Modelling the combustion of thermally thick biomass particles								POWDER TECHNOLOGY				353				110	124		10.1016/j.powtec.2019.05.011				JUL 15 2019	2019	A new combustion model is developed for thermally thick biomass particles by considering the intraparticle heat conduction, radiation, and reactions as well as the interaction of the internal and external flows of the particle. The particle temperature is solved in a continuous system with a finite element method, while the pyrolysis and char conversion are resolved in a discrete system. Furthermore, the flow fields both inside and outside the particle are modeled by a uniform multiphase CFD algorithm. The integrated model is first validated with the experimental data available in the literature. Numerical simulations not only provide the temperature and mass loss evolutions of the particle, but also reveal the flame structure, porosity evolvement, gas species distribution and streamlines inside and outside the particle which are quite difficult to be obtained in experiment. Moreover, the influences of inflow velocity, oxygen mass fraction, particle size and shape on biomass combustion behavior are also investigated. Results show that, the intraparticle heating and the char oxidation processes have a close relationship with the inflow velocity and particle size. The alteration in the oxygen mass fraction also has an important impact on the particle combustion behavior. In addition, different pyrolysis characteristics and flame structures are observed in the combustion of the square and rectangular particles. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the high cost, impractical operating conditions, and unsatisfactory efficiency and stability of conventional methods restrain their large-scale development. Seawater covers 70% of the Earth's surface and is one of the most abundant natural resources on the planet. New research is looking into the possibility of using seawater to produce hydrogen through electrolysis and will provide remarkable insight into sustainable H-2 production, if successful. Here, guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict the selectivity of gas-evolving catalysts, a seawater-splitting device equipped with affordable state-of-the-art electrocatalysts composed of earth-abundant elements (Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo) is demonstrated. This device shows excellent durability and specific selectivity toward the oxygen evolution reaction in seawater with near 100% Faradaic efficiency for the production of H-2 and O-2. Powered by a single commercial III-V triple-junction photovoltaic cell, the integrated system achieves spontaneous and efficient generation of high-purity H-2 and O-2 from seawater at neutral pH with a remarkable 17.9% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency.									110	15	0	0	8	0	112			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000431615100023	29569283

However, the performance of the available electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is far from satisfactory under large current density in alkaline electrolyte. Here we report a remarkably active and durable electrocatalyst, long and dense MoS2/Ni3S2 co-axial heterostructure nanowires on nickel foam (NF). Notably, it requires only 182 and 200 mV overpotential to achieve large current density of 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively, in alkaline solution, which are far superior to those of Pt/C-NF (281 and 444 mV) and the reported best non-noble metal catalysts (191 and 220 mV). The physical origin for this extraordinary HER performance is analyzed, which provides a useful guide for structure design of electrocatalysts to further improve their performance.

Highly efficient non-noble electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are desirable for large scale production of hydrogen by water electrolysis. Especially, exposing as many active sites as possible is a vital way to improve activities of the catalysts. Herein, a series of new hydrangea like composite catalysts of ultrathin Mo2S3 nanosheets assembled uprightly and interlacedly on N, S-dualdoped graphitic biocarbon spheres were facilely prepared. The unique structure endowed the catalysts highly exposed edge active sites and prominently high activities for HER. Especially, the optimized catalyst Mo2S3/NSCS-50 exhibited as low as 106 mV of overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 (denoted as n10). The catalyst also showed low Tafel slope of 53 mV/ dec, low electron transfer resistance of 34 U and high stability evidenced by the result that the current density only attenuated 11.7% after 10 h i-t test. The catalyst has shown broad prospect for commercial application in water electrolysis. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To maximize active sites exposure and electron transport, a general method to prepare binder-free Ni-M (M = Mo, Ge, Sn) bimetallic alloy nanosheets electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is successfully developed for the first time, via topotactic transformation of layered nickel hydroxide salts (Ni-LHS). The obtained bimetallic alloys show much improved HER performance to that of Ni. In particular, Ni4Mo alloy nanosheets exhibit HER activity with an overpotential of only 69.6 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 37 mV decade(-1) in alkaline medium, due to large electrochemical active surface area and low charge transfer resistance. Moreover, Ni4Mo alloy nanosheets also show high HER activity in both acidic and neutral electrolytes with long-term stability, demonstrating superior activity comparable to or better than state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst. This topotactic transformation method using LHS precursors provides a way to design and fabricate cost-effective and energy-efficient ultrathin 2D bimetallic alloy nanosheets for electrocatalysis, greatly broadening the scope of the currently available self-supporting metal alloy electrocatalysts.									9	2	0	0	0	0	9			2196-7350			WOS:000510778000001

The photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic activities were evaluated by the degradation of methylene blue (MB) and the oxygen reduction experiment under visible light. The results showed the photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic activities were dependent on the weight ratio of Ag and the optimum photocatalytic activity of mpg-C3N4/Ag at a weight ratio of 3% is almost 3 times as high as that of mpg-C3N4. Additionally, mpg-C3N4/Ag exhibited a significantly enhanced oxygen reduction performance under visible light. The limit current density was increased about 2 times by the modification of Ag nanoparticles, compared with that of pristine mpg-C3N4. Finally, based on the first principle, the enhancement mechanism of the photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic activities was discussed by the calculation on the band structure and density of states in the mpg-C3N4/Ag composites. The appropriate amount of Ag modification would cause the surface plasmon resonance effect, which improved the photocatalytic, photoelectrocatalytic, and oxygen reduction activities of mpg-C3N4.

Modelling the molecular composition and nuclear-spin chemistry of collapsing pre-stellar sources								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				477	4			4454	4472		10.1093/mnras/sty881				JUL 2018	2018	We study the gravitational collapse of pre-stellar sources and the associated evolution of their chemical composition. We use the University of Grenoble Alpes Astrochemical Network (UGAN), which includes reactions involving the different nuclear-spin states of H-2, H-3(+), and of the hydrides of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur, for reactions involving up to seven protons. In addition, species-to-species rate coefficients are provided for the ortho/para inter-conversion of the H-3(+) + H-2 system and isotopic variants. The composition of the medium is followed from an initial steady state through the early phase of isothermal gravitational collapse. Both the freeze-out of the molecules on to grains and the coagulation of the grains were incorporated in the model. The predicted abundances and column densities of the spin isomers of ammonia and its deuterated forms are compared with those measured recently towards the pre-stellar cores H-MM1, L16293E, and Barnard B1. We find that gas-phase processes alone account satisfactorily for the observations, without recourse to grain-surface reactions. In particular, our model reproduces both the isotopologue abundance ratios and the ortho: para ratios of NH2D and NHD2 within observational uncertainties. More accurate observations are necessary to distinguish between full scrambling processes - as assumed in our gas-phase network - and direct nucleus-or atom-exchange reactions.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000435630100013

Structural characterization results show that the obtained Ni_3(Se_xS_(1-x_)_2 nanorods belong to the trigonal phase and form an ordered array structure on nickel foams. Due to the fast carrier transfer efficiency,abundant active sites and the synergistic effect of poly-anions,Ni_3(Se_(0.3)S_(0.7))_2/NF nanorod arrays have the optimal electrocatalytic performance. In 1.0 mol/L KOH solution,Ni_3(Se_(0.3)S_(0.7))_2/NF nanoarrays have the overpotential of only 344 mV at 50 mA/cm~2,Tafel slope of 40.17 mV/dec,and excellent electrochemical stability. More importantly,the overall water splitting is carried out with Ni_3(Se_(0.3)S_(0.7))_2/NF nanorod array as the anode and the commercial Pt/C as the cathode. It is found that a battery potential of 1.49 V can provide the electrolysis current of 10 mA/cm~2, showing the good electrocatalytic effect. This work provides an efficient electrocatalyst for the field of electrolysis water technology,and also provides valuable insights for the reasonable construction of non-precious electrocatalysts in electrochemical energy technology.			通过一步溶剂热法成功合成了泡沫镍(NF)支撑的三元镍基硫属化物(Ni_3(Se_xS_(1-x))_2)纳米棒阵列。结构表征结果表明,所得三元Ni_3(Se_xS_(1-x_)_2纳米棒属于三方物相,在泡沫镍基底上形成了有序的阵列结构。由于其快速的载流子传输效率、丰富的活性位点和多阴离子的协同效应,Ni_3(Se_(0.3)S_(0.7))_2/NF纳米棒阵列具有最佳的电催化性能。在1.0 mol/L的KOH溶液中,电流密度为50 mA/cm~2时,过电势仅为344 mV,塔菲尔斜率为40.17 mV/dec,同时具有优异的电化学稳定性。更重要的是,以商用Pt/C为阴极,Ni_3(Se_(0.3)S_(0.7))_2/NF纳米棒阵列为阳极进行全分解水实验,仅需要1.49 V的电池电位即可提供10 mA/cm~2的电解电流,表现出良好的电解水效果。该研究为电解水技术领域提供了一种高效的电催化剂,也为电化学能源技术中非贵重电催化剂的合理构建提供了有价值的见解。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-0518			CSCD:7275882

The TiO2 nanotubes were formed by applying alternating positive and negative voltages. During the electrochemical formation, not only a bamboo structure is formed but the tubes are reduced in the cathodic cycle. After a rapid annealing treatment of these tubes in air at 500 degrees C for 10 s, the bamboo rings (knots) provide (001) facets preferentially located at the knot, while (101) planes prevail on the smooth part of tube between knots, as shown by TEM. The short annealing time keeps Ti3+/oxygen vacancies (V-O) as co-catalytically active centers still preserved in the TiO2 NTAs. The results of intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and open-circuit potential decay measurements (V-OC) indicate that these faceted and reduced TiO2 nanotube arrays provide an efficient separation and reaction of photo-generated charge carriers, leading to an improved photocatalytic H-2 evolution performance.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000454705900011

Although Nox catalyze the same enzymatic reaction, they acquired from a common ancestor during evolution, specificities related to their tissue expression, subcellular localization, activation mechanisms and regulation. Their functions could vary depending on the pathophysiological state of the tissues. Indeed, ROS are not only bactericidal weapons in phagocytes but also essential cellular signaling molecules and their overproduction is involved in chronic diseases and diseases of aging. The understanding of the mechanisms involved in the function of Nox and the emergence of Nox inhibitors, require a thorough knowledge of their nature and structure.

The adsorption process of Al+, Al2+, Al3+, and O+ were studied to identify possible preferential adsorption sites during thin film growth. Differences in near surface atomic displacements (e.g., adsorption-induced surface reconstructions), energies, and bonding character have been evaluated. The adsorption energies for the metallic ions showed a strong dependence on both initial charge and adsorption site. The O+ ions showed no site dependence, but adsorption energies similar to those calculated for Al+. The results indicate that the adsorption of O+ and Al3+ may favor the formation of an amorphous structure, which is consistent with experimental observations. The results are of fundamental importance for the understanding of thin film microstructure evolution.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000225695100039

Herein, we report a molten-salt method to synthesize Co-doped CaMn3O6 (CMO) nanowires (NWs) as effective electrocatalyst for HER. The as-obtained CaMn3-xCoxO6 (CMCO) exhibits a small onset overpotential of 70 mV, a required overpotential of 140 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 39 mV.dec(-1) in 0.1 M HClO4, and a satisfying long-term stability. Experimental characterizations combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the obtained HER performance can be attributed to the Co-doping which altered CMO' s surface electronic structures and properties. Considering the simplicity of synthesis route and the abundance of the pertinent elements, the synthesized CMCO shows a promising prospect as a candidate for the development of earth-abundant, metal-based, and cost-effective electrocatalyst with superior HER activity. Our results also establish a strategy of rational design and construction of novel electrocatalyst toward HER by tailoring band structures of transition metal oxides (TMOs).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000709260000004

For the first time, hydrogen and oxygen evolution (40.8 and 36.1 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) is demonstrated by a porphyrin photocatalyst without the addition of any cocatalysts. The strong oxidizing performance also presents an efficient photodegradation activity that is more than ten times higher than that of g-C3N4 for the photodegradation of phenol. The high photocatalytic reduction and oxidation activity arises from a strong built-in electric field due to molecular dipoles of electron-trapping groups and the nanocrystalline structure of the supramolecular photocatalyst. The appropriate band structure of the supramolecular photocatalyst adjusted via the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels of the porphyrin gives rise to thermodynamic driving potential for H-2 and O-2 evolution under visible light irradiation. Controlling the energy band structure of photocatalysts via the ordered assembly of structure-designed organic molecules could provide a novel approach for the design of organic photocatalysts in energy and environmental applications.									151	12	0	0	15	0	152			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000459724200020	30589130

When isolated PSII membranes were treated in darkness with 10 mM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an active form of oxygen that is generated at the acceptor side of PSII under illumination, proteins of the PSII reaction center were specifically damaged in almost the same way as observed under illumination with strong light. The D1 protein and, to a lesser extent, the D2 protein were degraded to specific fragments, and cross-linked products (the covalently linked adduct of the D1 protein and the alpha subunit of cytochrome b(559) and the heterodimer of the D1 and D2 proteins) were generated concomitantly. The site of cleavage of the D1 protein that gave rise to a major fragment of 22 kDa was located in the loop that connects membrane-spanning helixes IV and V. Treatment with H2O2 caused the same damage to proteins in isolated thylakoids and in core complexes that contained the non-heme iron at the acceptor side, but not in isolated reaction centers depleted of the iron. From these observations and the effects of reagents that are known to interact with the non-heme iron, it is suggested that the damage to proteins is caused by oxygen radicals generated by the non-heme iron in the Fe(II) state in a reaction with H2O2. It is proposed, moreover, that a similar mechanism is operative during the selective and specific degradation of the D1 protein under illumination.									101	4	2	0	96	0	105			0006-2960			WOS:A1995RN73200025	7632674	
J	Wang, Yun-feng; Wang, Yi-wei; Xu, Liang-hua; Wang, Yu								Regulating the radial structure of polyacrylonitrile fibers during pre-oxidation and its effect on the mechanical properties of the resulting carbon fibers								NEW CARBON MATERIALS				36	4			827	833		10.1016/S1872-5805(20)60516-9		AUG 2021		AUG 2021	2021	The radial structure of polyacrylonitrile fibers oxidized before carbonization and its distribution directly affect the performance of the resulting carbon fibers. Optimizing the radial distribution of the oxidized structure and establishing a relationship between this structure and the mechanical properties of the final carbon fibers will help optimize the oxidation conditions for the preparation of high-performance carbon fibers. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, optical microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and mechanical tests were used to investigate the effect of the oxidation reaction rate on the radial distribution of the structure of the oxidized fibers and the mechanical properties of the resulting carbon fibers. The oxidation reaction rates were controlled by regulating the oxidation temperature gradient. Results show that the degree of oxidation increases with both the average and initial oxidation rates. By increasing the average oxidation reaction rate, the oxidized structure penetrates deeper into the core region of the fibers, the content of oxygen-containing functional groups increases, the thermal stability of the fibers decreases, and the degree of graphitization of the final carbon fibers increases, but the density of the fibers is decreased and their mechanical properties are degraded. Compared with sample obtained with the lower initial oxidation rate, the number of oxygen-containing functional groups, thermal stability, degree of graphitization and density of the final carbon fibers of the sample with the higher initial oxidation rate are higher, and its tensile strength and modulus are respectively 4.2% and 2.2% higher. A new type of carbon fiber with high strength, medium modulus and a relatively large diameter is obtained under the optimized oxidation conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1007-8827	1872-5805		WOS:000686551900012

The element of interest reacts with the labelled O-2 in the reaction cell of the ICP-MS and is determined by measuring the intensity ratios of its monoxide ions with and without a third element in a similar way to a conventional ID method. The proposed ID method is applicable to the determination of monoisotopic elements as well as multiple stable isotopes. As an example, the approach was used for the determination of yttrium (Y). Yttrium reacted with O-16 and O-18 gas in the reaction cell to generate two yttrium-oxygen molecular ions ((YO)-Y-89-O-16 and (YO)-Y-89-O-18), and then, the signal intensity ratios of the two molecular ions with and without the third element ((10)7Ag), whose mass number was the same as that of (YO)-Y-89-O-18, were measured. The Y concentration was calculated from the intensity ratios measured at m/z = 105 and 107 and the mass abundances of O-16, O-18 and Ag-107. Yttrium was determined in certified river water and fern. The determined Y concentration agreed with the certified value and/or with that determined using external calibration.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0267-9477	1364-5544		WOS:000460564100005

The reaction of methyl E-4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamate (E-methyl ferulate) selectively gave the corresponding 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde; yields are highest in chloroform, good in methanol and very low in pyridine. Conversion was high with E-methyl ferulate, lower with methyl E-4-hydroxycinnamate, while the other phenols, methyl E-3-hydroxy-4-methoxycinnamate (E-methyl isoferulate) and methyl E-3-chloro-4-hydroxycinnamate, did not react. An EPR investigation of the reaction mixtures, performed on samples taken at different reaction times, demonstrated that the most probable mechanism involves reactions (i)-(iii).

This decomposes to aldehyde and acid. The phenol electron-donor properties promote the formation of the superoxocobalt derivative and consequently favour the formation of the phenoxy cobalt radical; a too high stability of this radical does not favour its evolution into oxidation products.									30	0	0	0	6	0	30			1472-7773			WOS:000071416300009

In anion-exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), to reach high power densities, operating at high pH is an alternative to using large volumes of noble metals catalysts at the cathode, where the oxygen-reduction reaction occurs. However, the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen-oxidation reaction (HOR) hinders upscaling despite promising catalysts. Here, the authors observe an unexpected ingress of B into Pd nanocatalysts synthesized by wet-chemistry, gaining control over this B-doping, and report on its influence on the HOR activity in alkaline conditions. They rationalize their findings using ab initio calculations of both H- and OH-adsorption on B-doped Pd. Using this "impurity engineering" approach, they thus design Pt-free catalysts as required in electrochemical energy conversion devices, for example, next generations of AEMFCs, that satisfy the economic and environmental constraints, that is, reasonable operating costs and long-term stability, to enable the "hydrogen economy."									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000805660400001	35514107

The imprint of such an epoch might be retained in the spatial distribution of planetary material, the systematic deviations of its elemental composition from that of the Sun, chemical indicators of primordial oxidation state, and variations in oxygen and other isotopic compositions. Our method of investigation is to calculate the time-dependent, two-dimensional temperature distributions within model nebulas of prescribed dynamical evolution, and to deduce the consequences of the calculated thermal histories for coagulated solid material. The models are defined by parameters which characterize nebular initial states (mass and angular momentum), mass accretion histories, and coagulation rates and efficiencies. It is demonstrated that coagulation during the cooling of the nebula from a hot state is expected to produce systematic heterogeneities which affect the chemical and isotopic compositions of planetary material. The radial thermal gradient at the midplane results in delayed coagulation of the more volatile elements. Vertical thermal gradients isolate the most refractory material and concentrate evaporated heavy elements in the gas phase. It is concluded that these effects could be responsible for the distribution of terrestrial planetary masses, the systematic depletion patterns of the moderately volatile elements in chondritic meteorites and the Earth, the range of oxygen isotopic compositions exhibited by calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) and other refractory inclusions, and some geochemical evidence for a moderately enhanced oxidation state. However, nebular fractionations on a global scale are unlikely to account for the more oxidizing conditions inferred for some CAIs and chondritic silicates, which require dust enhancements greater than a few hundred. This conclusion, along with the well-established evidence from studies of chondrules and CAIs for thermal excursions of short duration, make it likely that local environments, unrelated to nebular thermal evolution, were also important.									89	0	0	0	2	0	89			1086-9379	1945-5100		WOS:000169081300009

During longterm operation, the aging of insulating materials will lead to cable failure and threaten the safe operation of the power system. The molecular structure evolution of XLPE cable insulation materials was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric (TG) methods. The results show that the crystallinity and melting temperature of 0 year sample are the highest, which are 24% and 105.52 degrees C, respectively. The carbonyl index is small, and the proportion of TG in the first stage is small. After 15 and 30 years of operation, the crystallinity of the cable decreased by 16.7% and 25.0% respectively, the carbonyl index increased first and then slightly decreased, the melting temperature decreased first and then slightly increased, and the proportion of TG in the first stage increased. The results show that the microstructure of the 0 year old sample is relatively complete, and it has good thermal stability and oxidation resistance. After a long period of operation, the crystal region of the sample is destroyed, and the thermal-oxygen reaction takes place, resulting in thermal-oxygen cracking of macromolecules, generating more volatile small molecular groups, and reducing the insulation performance of the cable.

In the present work, a large-scale self-supported black nickel sheet composed of nickel nanorod arrays (B-Ni) was successfully fabricated via electroplating with a nanostructured Si template assisted strategy, and Ni3N coating layer was coated on the structured surface followed by a nitrogen plasma treatment with different treatment durations. The black color is due to the immensely enhanced light absorption through the surface nanostructures with high aspect ratio. The samples show promising catalytic performance when used as electrochemical catalysts for both HER and OER in alkaline electrolyte. Benefiting from the nanostructure and the Ni3N coating, B-Ni_N-2 _10 min exhibits low onset potentials of 1.560 and 0.165 V at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for OER and HER, respectively. The calculated electrochemical surface area (ECSA) for B-Ni is 10 times higher than the pristine Ni sheet (P-Ni), while after nitrogen plasma treatment, the ECSA for B-Ni_N-2 _10 min is 21 times higher than that of the P-Ni. In addition, all the catalysts show good electrochemical stabilities. All the improvements for the electrochemical performances suggest that nanostructured nickel nitride could be a promising inexpensive catalyst system for both OER and HER processes.									16	1	0	0	0	0	15				2574-0970		WOS:000595546500046

However, high overpotential is required to catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here we fabricate self-supported CoMn-LDH nanosheets with a thickness of approximately 1.9 nm on carbon fiber cloth through electrodeposition method within 50 s. The self-supported, binder-free anodes exhibit excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 258 mV at 10mAcm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH solution, remarkably lower than those of Co and Mn single counterparts, and the-state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst. Furthermore, self-supported, binder-free anodes exhibit robust stability for OER with a negligible current loss even at a high current density (>370mAcm(-2)) over 15 h. Flexible and bendable measurements indicate no obvious degradation in the OER performance of the anode even as being bended to 180 degrees. Moreover, the water electrolysis with the CoMn-LDH/CFC as anode and Pt/C/CFC as cathode only needs a cell voltage of 1.54 V to deliver the current density of lOmA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH solution. Our experimental results demonstrate that the electron interaction between Mn and Co, increased electrochemical active area and decreased charge-transfer resistance contribute to the enhancement of the optimized anode in OER performance.

The effect of time reaction on the morphology of NiCoFe-LDH was investigated using the Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy images. The results show that time reaction can affect the morphology and it also showed that the optimal time for synthesis of nano-petal NiCoFe-LDH was 60 min. Then, the effect of nano-petal NiCoFe-LDH on oxygen evaluation reaction activity was studied and compared with NiCoFe-LDH-c nano paricles. Also, in order to study the effect of Co2+ of nano-petal NiCoFe-LDH at water oxidation, the activity of NiFe-LDH synthesized in the same conditions was investigated. The results show that nano-petal NiCoFe-LDH has low onset potential (0.46 V vs. SCE), over-potential (similar to 227 mV) and Tafel slope (234 mV per decade) in comparison with other NiCoFe-LDH nanoparticles (synthesis using co-precipitation method and ultrasonication method within 30 and 120 min), and NiFe-LDH. Based on the obtained results, the nano-petal NiCoFe-LDH can be as a suitable electrocatalyst with good stability for water oxidation reaction in the present 0.1 M KOH media.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			1350-4177	1873-2828		WOS:000532044300074	32097867

This novel electrode fabrication technology exhibits the features of low-cost, no template requirement, customizable freedom design and controllable hierarchically micro-nanoporous architecture characteristics. The studies show that unique 3D geometry structure design will facilitate the enhancement of the electrochemical active surface area, wetting properties and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis performance for PA-based lattice elec-trodes. The as-prepared superwetting thiourea dioxide (TDO) type PA-based body-centred cubic with circular struts (BCCCS) lattice (1.0 mm) electrode as water splitting anode drives 1000 mA/cm(2) large-current-density at 1.55V (vs Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE)) potential, which is 280 mV lower than the potential of the commercial Ni foam-based anode. This result shows obvious energy-saving advantage in industrial water split-ting application area. Notably, the PA-based BCCCS lattice (1.0 mm) anode can stably drive 1000 mA/cm(2) current density for at least 10 h in alkali electrolyte and obtains up to 100% anode faraday efficiency. This work provides new idea for high performance energy-saving electrodes and expands the application scope of additive manufacturing technology.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-8368	1879-1069		WOS:000860783400003

The development of water splitting electrocatalysts that have low-cost, long-lifetime, and high-performance is an important area of research for the sustainable generation of hydrogen and oxygen gas. Here, we report a metal-free porphyrin-based two-dimensional crystalline covalent organic polymer obtained from the condensation of terephthaloyl chloride and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl) porphyrin which is stabilized by an extensive hydrogen bonding network. This material exhibits bifunctional electrocatalytic performance towards water splitting with onset overpotentials, eta, of 36 mV and 110 mV for HER (in 0.5 M H2SO4) and OER (in 1.0 M KOH), respectively. The as-synthesized material is also able to perform water splitting in neutral phosphate buffer saline solution, with 294 mV for HER and 520 mV for OER, respectively. Characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and chronoamperometry, the as-synthesized material also shows enhanced conductivity and stability compared to its molecular counterpart. Inserting a non-redox active zinc metal center in the porphyrin unit leads to a decrease in electrochemical activity towards both HER and OER, suggesting the four-nitrogen porphyrin core is the active site. The high performance of this metal-free material towards water splitting provides a sustainable alternative to the use of scarce and expensive metal electrocatalysts in energy conversion for industrial applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000821588600001	35974754

However, pristine LDH suffers from slow charge-carrier mobility, high rate of electron-hole recombination as well as a tendency to agglomerate, rendering them unbefitting for practical use. Due to the aforementioned bottlenecks, structural modifications such as thickness tuning, cocatalyst incorporation, semiconductor coupling, and ternary heterostructure engineering have been extensively investigated to elucidate a new lease of landscape to the burgeoning potential of LDHs toward artificial photosynthesis. This review summarizes a panorama of state-of-the-art advancements related to the synthesis and modification of LDH-based nanocomposites for enhanced physicochemical properties toward boosted photocatalysis. Particularly, their progress in versatile energy applications in photocatalytic water splitting (hydrogen and oxygen evolution), and nitrogen and carbon dioxide reduction reactions will be systematically presented. Insights into band structures, electronic properties, and charge-carrier dynamics of LDH-based nanostructures will be discussed to unravel the structure-performance relationship. Finally, this review will prospect the invigorating prospectives and opportunities in engineering next-generation LDH-based photocatalysts with augmented performances to pave new inroads at the forefront of this research.									34	2	0	0	1	0	34			2367-198X			WOS:000613265000001

CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				8	22			5782	5793		10.1039/c8cy01467a				NOV 21 2018	2018	In this study, three -Fe2O3 crystallites of regular morphology (truncated hexagonal bipyramid, quasi cubic, and hexagonal plate) were prepared in a controllable manner. Based on the (HR)TEM and SEM characterizations, the exposed crystal facets of three -Fe2O3 crystallites, namely {113}, {214}, {104}, {110}, {012}, and {001}, were carefully identified. Au nanoparticles of ca. 2.0 nm with a narrow particle size distribution were essentially monodispersed on the three -Fe2O3 substrates through a controlled deposition strategy. In such a way, the Au/-Fe2O3 interfacial structures with structurally defined oxide substrates and nearly identical Au particle size and morphology have been obtained. The systems allowed us to compare in depth the behaviors of distinct surfaces/interfaces in CO oxidation. The characterization including O-2/surface hydroxyl-TPD, CO-TPSR, and in situ FTIR clarified the role of the surface oxygen/hydroxyl species in developing crucial intermediates on distinct interfaces. The results demonstrated that the evolution of different intermediates (CO32- and HCO2-) was directly controlled by interfacial features, i.e., the weakly adsorbed oxygen and surface hydroxyl species as well as the specific Au-Fe2O3 boundary structure, which meaningfully determined CO activation and conversion to CO2. The present study provided new insights into the significance of Au/-Fe2O3 interfacial structures governing the evolution of reaction intermediates in CO oxidation.									8	2	0	0	0	0	9			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000450091300005

Evolution of relative density during SPS treatment and microstructure observations by SEM showed that oxygen and vacancy contents would enhance the densification kinetics by promoting the lattice diffusion of limiting species.

Oxidation was found to proceed by two morphologically distinct, competing mechanisms: a spatially homogeneous process with randomly distributed chemisorbed oxygen atoms leading to layer-by-layer oxide growth, and a spatially heterogeneous process with oxides nucleating on structural surface defects and growing vertically and laterally with continued exposure. Both oxidation mechanisms exhibit enhanced reactivity with increasing kinetic energy. Only trace oxidation was observed with O-2 kinetic energies below 0.7 eV; a rapid increase in the rate of oxidation from 1.0 to 1.2 eV was found with homogeneous and heterogeneous oxidation proceeding simultaneously until full surface coverage was reached. In addition, the relative rates of the two mechanisms appear to change with O-2 kinetic energy: spatially homogeneous oxidation is expected to dominate at lower kinetic energies (< 0.7 eV) while the heterogenous growth of oxide islands increasingly dominates with higher kinetic energies (>= 1.0 eV). The results obtained in this study conclusively demonstrate that a heterogenous oxidation mechanism is activated on GaAs(110) at high O-2 kinetic energies, and reveal that thin oxide layers can be achieved with higher efficiency at room temperature using molecular beams of oxygen. These results provide vital information about the morphological evolution of the surface in conjunction with the overall kinetics, and identify a controlled method of enhanced oxidation at moderate temperatures that could potentially improve abruptness at oxide interfaces and be used in the fabrication of GaAs semiconductor devices.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0039-6028	1879-2758		WOS:000502892900005

Herein, the paper described a core-shell structured MnCo2O4.5@C modified PbO2 electrode through the pyrolysis and co-electrodeposition as a promising candidate for zinc electrowinning. As a result, the obtained Pb0.2%Ag/alpha-PbO2/beta-PbO2-MnCo2O4.5@C composite electrode showed a sandwich-like structure, where Pb-0.2%Ag as a core, alpha-PbO2 as a mid-layer, and beta-PbO2-MnCo2O4.5@C served as an electrocatalytic layer. It also possessed improved OER catalytic activity, only required 680 mV to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 216.04 mV dec(-1) in an acidic solution containing 50 g L-1 Zn2+ and 150 g L-1 H2SO4. The current efficiency increased by 0.7% and the cell voltage reduced by 360 mV as compared to a conventional Pb-0.76%Ag alloy electrode, leading to a remarkable energy-consumption reduction of 283.5 kW h for producing per ton metallic zinc. Furthermore, Pb-0.2%Ag/a-PbO2/beta-PbO2-MnCo2O4.5@C exhibited a prolonged service life, which worked about 44 h under an ultra-high current density of 2 A cm(-2). Hence, this paper provides the strategy to design and construct non-precious, high-performance catalyst for electrolysis and other applications.									2	1	0	0	1	0	3			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000752467900002	35030491

The surface electron configuration, correlated to the surface elemental composition and the valence state of an electrocatalyst plays crucial roles in achieving bifunctionality and efficient electrocatalysis. In this study, we demonstrate the achievement of bifunctional Pt-Fe alloy electrocatalysts for effectively catalyzing both the MOR and ORR by tailoring their surface electron configuration via a synthetic strategy employing a Wattecs parallel autoclave system (WPAS), which allows the alteration of reaction atmospheres and operating conditions during the synthetic process, in contrast to a normal hydrothermal method. The optimal Pt-Fe alloy electrocatalyst displayed remarkably enhanced ORR electrocatalytic performance with a half-potential (E1/2) of 0.9 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), together with robust stability (3000 cycles), in the ORR in a 0.1 M HClO4 solution and exhibited excellent catalytic performance in the MOR with a mass activity of 1.82 A mg(-1), which is 7.9 times higher than that of commercial 20% Pt/C (0.23 A mg(-1)). These Pt-Fe alloy electrocatalysts also possessed long-term stability and the ability to tolerate CO intermediates and hold great significance for widespread applications in the field of renewable energy owing to their low cost and superior bifunctionality for both the MOR and ORR. The variability of the surface electron configuration that arose from the purposive modulation of the chemical composition and valence state of the surface of the Pt-Fe alloy electrocatalysts accounted for the increase in electrocatalytic performance and the achievement of bifunctional catalysis in both the MOR and ORR.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1466-8033			WOS:000417752200013

Herein, origami-like molybdenum carbide flakes with interfacially connected structures in various orientations using an easily scalable chemical vapor deposition method are synthesized. Interestingly, each individual flake of similar orientation is interconnected across different planes. The interconnected architectures are found to be highly elastic and behave in a sponge-like manner. In addition, the surface energy of each plane is calculated using the first-principle density functional theory. The molybdenum carbide shows excellent activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction, with the onset over potential occurring around -16 to -25 mV with high stability. The material is used as an electrode for supercapacitors as a second demonstration. The supercapacitor constructed with polypyrrole reaches the specific capacitance of approximate to 279 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1).									8	2	0	0	0	0	9			2196-7350			WOS:000428348800004

Despite active investigations of component development for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE), understanding of the device performance remains insufficient for the commercialization of AEMWE. The study of assembled AEMWE devices is essential to validate the activity and stability of developed catalysts and electrolyte membranes, as well as the dependence of the performance on the device operating conditions. Herein, we review the development of catalysts and membranes reported by different AEMWE companies such as ACTA S.p.A. and Proton OnSite and device operating conditions that significantly affect the AEMWE performance. For example, CuCoOx and LiCoO2 have been studied as oxygen evolution catalysts by Acta S.p.A and Proton OnSite, respectively. Anion exchange membranes based on polyethylene and polysulfone are also investigated for use as electrolyte membranes in AEMWE devices. In addition, operation factors, including temperature, electrolyte concentration and acidity, and solution feed methods, are reviewed in terms of their influence on the AEMWE performance. The reaction rate of water splitting generally increases with increase in operating temperature because of the facilitated kinetics and higher ion conductivity. The effect of solution feeding configuration on the AEMWE performance is explained, with a brief discussion on current AEMWE performance and device durability.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2093-8551			WOS:000425269800001

Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)											10.1039/d2dt02770d				2022-Nov-03	2022	Hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting suffers from high kinetic barriers in the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which limits the overall efficiency. Herein, we report a structural and electronic engineering strategy by integrating self-standing Fe-doped Ni3S2 (denoted by Fe-Ni3S2) nanosheet arrays with Ni(OH)2 subunits to form heterostructured Fe-Ni3S2/Ni(OH)2 on a Ni Foam substrate. The strong electronic interaction between the Fe-Ni3S2 and Ni(OH)2 constituents contributes abundant catalytic sites and ensures high electron transfer. Moreover, the combined experimental and theoretical study revealed that the coupling of Ni(OH)2 onto the Fe-Ni3S2 is favorable for lowering the activation energy of water oxidation for favorable OER kinetics and upshifting the Ni d-band center to facilitate the adsorption of O-containing intermediates. Consequently, the optimized Fe-Ni3S2/Ni(OH)2 hybrid catalyst exhibits excellent OER performance in alkaline electrolytes with an ultralow overpotential of 202 mV at 10 mA cm-2, a small Tafel slope of 50.6 mV dec-1, and long-term durability under high current density (0.25 A cm-2) for up to 60 h without significant deactivation. Moreover, a two-electrode Fe-Ni3S2/Ni(OH)2||Pt/C electrolyzer requires only a low voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm-2 for overall water splitting. This study emphasizes the importance of interface and surface engineering in achieving highly efficient electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1477-9234		MEDLINE:36325946	36325946

In this paper, CdS nanoparticles (NPs) were surface-modified by chemical inert Al2O3 shell. This modification could prevent nascent formed oxygen induced photo-corrosion and enhance the photo-stability of CdS during water splitting significantly. In addition, it was found that such a shell could enhance efficient separation of photo-induced charge pairs. Besides, with the assistance of artificial gill of removing nascent formed O-2 from water, Pt/CdS@Al2O3 photocatalyst can achieve overall water splitting under visible light irradiation. The rate of H-2 evolution increased 126 times over Pt/CdS@Al2O3 composite compared with pure CdS NPs, and the stability was maintained in several cycles of reaction without any decrease. The measurement of concentration of Cd2+ in solution after long cycles by ICP method confirmed this anti-photo-corrosion property of Al2O3 shell on CdS. This work provides a new potential way to design and fabricate more stable and efficient CdS-based nanocomposite photocatalysts for versatile solar energy conversion.									116	11	0	0	14	0	118			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000425476800039

Herein, we present an engineered architecture for supported iridium catalysts, which enables decreased precious metal content and improved activity and conductivity. The improvement in performance at lower precious metal loading is realized by the deposition of a conformal layer of platinum nanoparticles on titanium dioxide (TiO2) using a facile photoreduction method to prepare conductive layer coated supports (CCSs). Platinum nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed on TiO2, and the conductivity of the subsequent catalysts with 39 wt % precious group metal loadings is significantly higher than the commercial 75 wt % loaded IrO2-TiO2 catalysts. The conformal conductive layer also maintains an enhanced conductivity and electrochemical activity upon thermal annealing when compared to catalysts without the conductive layer and nonconformal heterogeneous conductive layer. The iridium mass activity from half-cell studies shows a 141% improvement for CCS supported catalysts at 42% lower loadings compared to the commercial catalysts. The conductive layer also improves the single cell electrolyzer performance at a similar catalyst loading in comparison to a commercial state-of-the-art catalyst. We correlate the physical properties of the engineered catalysts with their electrochemical performance in electrolyzers to understand structure-activity relationships, and we anticipate further performance improvements upon synthesis and materials optimizations.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900068

Colloidal CoFe2O4 NPs were loaded on low-cost and high surface area nickel foam (NF) scaffolds. The coating process was optimized for large electrode areas, ensuring a proper distribution of the NPs on the NF that allowed overcoming the electrical conductivity limitations of oxide NPs. We were able to produce CoFe2O4-coated NFs having 10 cm(2) geometric surface areas with overpotentials below 300 mV for the OER at a current density of 50 mA/cm(2). Such impressively low overpotentials suggested using CoFe2O4 NP-based electrodes within a water electrolysis device. In this prototype device, stable operating currents up to 500 mA at remarkably low cell-voltages of 1.62 and 1.53 V, at ambient and 50 degrees C electrolyte temperatures, respectively, were reached during operation periods of up to 50 h. The high electrochemical energy efficiencies reached at 50 mA/cm(2), 75% and 81% respectively, rendered these devices particularly appealing to be combined with lowcost photovoltaic systems for bias-free hydrogen production. Therefore, CoFe2O4 NP-based electrolysers were coupled to low-cost thin-film silicon solar cells with 13% efficiency to complete a system that afforded solar-tofuel efficiencies above 10%.									23	0	0	0	3	1	23			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000488308800045

Herein, one-step hydrothermal method is developed for the synthesis of a series of nickel selenides (NiSe2, NiSe, and Ni3Se2) and their multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) nanocomposites as electrocatalysts for OER Among the NiSe2, NiSe, and Ni3Se2 catalysts, NiSe shows the highest activity, exhibiting an overpotential of 389 mV to achieve 10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope of 93 mV/dec in 1 M KOH. We further report a facile preparation of nickel selenides nanocrystals (particle size of 10 nm) grown on MWCNTs. The NiSe/MWCNTs nanocomposite shows improved activity toward OER, with an overpotential of 336 mV to reach similar to 10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope of 78 mV/dec, which is close to the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst. The addition of MWCNTs during the synthesis not only introduces an abundance of nucleation sites, resulting in small particle sizes of NiSe crystals, but also improves the dispersion of NiSe nanoparticles. The small particle size and good dispersion of NiSe nanoparticles are beneficial to providing abundant active catalytic sites. In addition, the porous and conductive MWCNTs facilitate the electronic transmission and the electrolyte penetration. Furthermore, NiSe/MWCNTs nanocomposite also exhibits good long-term stability.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			1932-7447			WOS:000451101400041

In this study, a series of ternary multi-heterojunction CdS/Bi20TiO32/Bi4Ti3O12 (CdSxBTC) photocatalysts were prepared by hydrothermal deposition of CdS nanoparticles (15-25 nm) over one pot combustion synthesized Bi20TiO32/Bi4Ti3O12 (BTC) nanostructures. Comprehensive characterization of the ternary composites revealed enhanced optical absorption, high interfacial contact, fast electron channelization and a prolonged excited state life time. The CdSxBTC composite materials displayed enhanced photocatalytic activity for endosulfan degradation (k(app) value 6-12 times greater than pure semiconductors) and water splitting reaction (H-2 production rate 1890 mu molgb(-1) h(-1) and apparent conversion efficiency 19%). The cell viability -study disclosed non-cytotoxic nature of the treated endosulfan solution. A synergistic Type-I bridged coupled Z-scheme electron migration process accounted for robust radical generation ability (O-center dot(2)- and (OH)-O-center dot) and photocatalytic activity of the ternary composites.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000727786000001

The TEM observations showed a homogeneous irradiated glass structure up to the nanometer scale. Modifications of the local order around the main cations were noticed, mainly a slight decrease of the mean boron coordination number and an increase of non-bridging oxygen concentrations. At the glass medium range order, the appearance of the D2 Raman band and a modification of the Si-O-Si angle distribution were also observed after irradiation.A comparison with other irradiation conditions with Swift Heavy Ions (Kr with 74 MeV) and Gold irradiation (with energies ranging from 1 to 7 MeV) is presented. Raman spectroscopy showed a similar final structure for irradiation conditions under which the glass evolutions are controlled by electronic energy loss in the ion tracks formation regime or nuclear energy loss. Despite important differences in energy deposition regimes, the similarities observed between the final glass structures suggest that structural evolutions are controlled by the glass relaxation mechanisms during the high quenching rate step that follows the energy deposition step.

The Co@N-CNT/rGO-0.1 exhibits efficient catalytic activities for ORR and OER with a small Tafel slope. It benefits from the synergistic effect of the Co nanoparticle and N-CNT, the high conductivity of reduced graphene oxide and highly graphitizing carbon nanotubes, the great specific surface area, and suitable aperture size. Moreover, the Co@N-CNT/rGO-0.1 catalyst assembled primary zinc-air battery shows a high open-circuit voltage (1.43 V), a large peak power density (122 mW cm(-2)), and an excellent specific capacity (855 mA h g(Zn)(-1)) In addition, the Co@N-CNT/rGO-0.1 assembly rechargeable zinc-air battery also displays an excellent cycling durability of 120 h at 5 mA cm(-2). According to the above results, our work provides a cost-effective strategy to scale-up and commercialize the bifunctional electrocatalysts for zinc-air battery application.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000551544900101

It is imperative to conduct both the OER and HER in the same electrolyte, hence it is necessary to adjust the material's characteristics to be compatible for this application. Due to the Co3+ active site, Co(OH)(2) is electrochemically oxidized to CoOOH and exhibits outstanding OER kinetics. The incorporation of Mn into the cobalt hydroxide matrix increases the surface area while balancing the ratio of *OH to *O radicals to increase electrocatalytic activity. The complementary effects of the two metal hydroxides (Co and Mn) reveal a fresh perspective on the next-generation electrocatalyst. The OER and HER reactions are both optimized using an easy electrodeposition method. The best HER and OER as two-electrode electrolyzers displayed a cell voltage of 1.69 V at 10 mA/cm(2) in alkaline electrolyte. Interestingly, when the state of art material Pt deposited on nickel foam substrate used for HER and the best CoMn hydroxide used for OER exhibits a cell voltage of only 1.55 V to drive the current density of 10 mA/cm(2).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000871844400001

In the last century, it was thought that uranium isotope fractionation did not exist, so the development of uranium isotope research was very slow. However, with the development of the analytical technology, it has been found that there exists significant fractionation between ~(238)U and ~(235)U in nature, which makes uranium isotopes an ideal tracer in Earth science. Indeed, overwhelming amounts of studies of uranium isotopes as a paleo-redox proxy have been published so far, most of which use uranium isotope to track the evolution of oxygen levels of Earth's subaerial environments through time and, furthermore, the potential relationship between the several big mass extinctions and the redox conditions of the oceans. Although researches on uranium isotope have achieved progresses in the co-evolution of the hydrosphere and biosphere, some problems still remain some unsolved. For example, the effects of microcosmic pathways of biological and abiotic reduction reactions on uranium isotope fractionation, and how the ~(238)U/~(235)U can trace the source of uranium ore deposits. Here, in this paper, it provides an overview of the uranium and its isotope geochemistry over the last decades, aiming at promoting applications of uranium isotopes in the genesis of uranium polymetallic deposits and high-temperature geochemistry in the future.			铀稳定同位素(~(238)U/~(235)U,通常记为delta~(238)U)目前已经成为非传统稳定同位素领域的研究热点.20世纪人们曾经认为铀同位素不存在分馏,因而铀同位素研究发展缓慢.然而随着分析技术的发展,人们发现自然界中铀同位素~(238)U和~(235)U存在显著的分馏,可以作为良好的示踪工具.迄今为止,已经有大量铀同位素作为古氧化还原指标的研究发表,比如用铀同位素示踪地球近地表环境氧含量随时间的演化以及生物大灭绝与海洋氧化还原状态之间的潜在关系.尽管铀同位素在水圈和生物圈协同演化领域取得了丰硕的研究成果,但仍有不少问题亟待深入解决.例如,生物和非生物还原高价铀的微观反应过程对铀同位素分馏的影响,以及铀同位素如何示踪铀矿物质来源等.系统总结了铀同位素地球化学最近十年的研究进展,希望将来铀同位素在铀多金属矿床成因和高温地球化学领域能有所突破.						1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1000-2383			CSCD:7132720

Here we employ a practical and scalable liquid-feed flame-spray synthesis capable of producing highly crystalline Ni-Fe oxide (Ni1-xFexOy) nanoparticles with high specific surface areas (SA(BET) approximate to 20-75 m(2) g(-1)). The work presented herein focuses on expanding the current understanding of how Fe incorporation influences the surface electronic and local coordination structures of Ni1-xFexOy and how this impacts the electrochemical stability and OER activity. The resulting operando XANES and EXAFS analyses at the Ni and Fe K-edges permit useful insight into the nature of the valence states and the rearrangements in local structure that occur under operating conditions representative of alkaline water electrolysis. Specifically, we show that the incorporation of Fe greatly stabilizes the Ni electronic and local coordination environment under OER conditions. Combined with electrochemical measurements, we find that the incorporation of Fe leads to an overall stabilization of the initially compact and crystalline rock salt structure of Ni1-xFexOy and thereby inhibits the transformation to more layered and disordered polymorphs (e.g. /-Ni1-xFexOOH).									33	2	0	0	2	0	33			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000452482900063

Compared to oxides the arrangement of anions in the material represents a further structural degree of freedom. The bulk oxynitride LaTiO2N prefers a bonding-dominated cis nitrogen arrangement, while we have previously shown that the (001) surface prefers a non-polar trans order to compensate polarity. Here we consider, using density functional theory calculations, the polar/non-polar interface that would necessarily be present between the two anion orders. We show that the Ti-terminated surface will adopt up to two trans ordered surface layers, which has a beneficial effect on the oxygen evolution efficiency. We then consider the hypothetical case of a polar cis ordered surface layer atop a non-polar trans bulk and show that similar electronic reconstructions as in the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface can be expected when interfaces between different anion orders are engineered in one and the same oxynitride material.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000457546000018

Herein, we report a facile synthetic method for the preparation of amorphous nickel-iron oxide/carbon composite nanofibers with high electrocatalytic activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This method involves two main steps: (i)the electrospinning synthesis of Ni- and Fe-embedded polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) polymer nanofibers as the precursor and (ii)the thermal conversion of this precursor in air at 250 degrees C into nickel-iron oxide/carbon composite nanofibers. Moreover, we show that the as-obtained composite material exhibits a comparable catalytic activity and a superior catalytic stability to IrOx/C and RuOx, which are state-of-the-art noble-metal-based water oxidation electrocatalysts. In particular, the obtained amorphous nickel-iron oxide/carbon composite nanofibers with an optimal Ni/Fe molar ratio of 1:2 afford a small overpotential of 310mV at a current density of 10mAcm(-2), show high catalytic stability for >15h, and give >90% Faradaic yield toward the OER. The efficient catalytic activity of the material can be attributed to its overall conducive structural features for the OER, mainly including the amorphous phase structure of nickel-iron oxide, tunable Ni/Fe atomic ratio, and strongly coupled interaction between nickel-iron oxide and nanocarbon.									63	4	0	0	2	0	63			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000372152100018		
J	Chandler, LE; Bartsevich, VV; Pakrasi, HB								Regulation of manganese uptake in Synechocystis 6803 by RfrA, a member of a novel family of proteins containing a repeated five-residues domain								BIOCHEMISTRY				42	18			5508	5514		10.1021/bi027113a				MAY 13 2003	2003	The rfrA gene was identified in a suppressor screen of a Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strain deficient in both mntC, encoding a component of an ABC transport system for manganese, and psbO, encoding the extrinsic manganese stabilizing protein of photosystem II (PSII). A spontaneous suppressor mutant (DeltaCDeltaO rfrA-Sup) has a point mutation in rfrA, which restores photosynthetic activity to the DeltamntCDeltapsbO double mutant. Manganese transport and photosynthesis are related in that manganese is essential to the function of PSII, and the state of cellular manganese availability influences the rate of oxygen evolution mediated by PSII. Oxygen evolution experiments with the ACAO rfrA-Sup mutant revealed that the mechanism of suppression is not through a direct modification of PSII. Instead, radioactive manganese uptake experiments indicated that RfrA is a regulator of a high affinity manganese transport system different from the more thoroughly characterized manganese ABC transport system in Synechocystis 6803. RfrA was named for the repeated five-residues domain in the amino terminus of the protein. The RFR domain defines a 16-member family in Synechocystis 6803. Predicted proteins with RFR domains have also been identified in other organisms, but RfrA is the first member of this family to be linked to a physiological process.									26	0	0	0	26	0	27			0006-2960			WOS:000182726100037	12731893

The enzymes are involved in the pathogenicity, immunity and morphogenesis of organisms and in the metabolic turnover of complex organic substances such as lignin or humic matter. Owing to their high non-specific oxidation capacity, laccases are useful biocatalysts for diverse biotechnological applications. Until recently, laccases were only found in eukaryotes (fungi, higher plants, insects), but now there is strong evidence for their widespread distribution in prokaryotes and the first crystal structure of a bacterial laccase is already available. Phylogenetically, laccases are members of the multi-copper protein family including ascorbate oxidase, ceruloplasmin and bilirubin oxidase. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

A single M. acetivorans gene was heterologously expressed to produce a functional sulfopyruvate decarboxylase protein, the fourth canonical enzyme in this biosynthetic pathway. An adjacent gene, at locus MA3297, encodes one of the organism's two threonine synthase homologues. When both paralogues from this organism were expressed in an Escherichia coli threonine synthase mutant, the MA1610 gene complemented the thrC mutation, whereas the MA3297 gene did not. Both PLP (pyridoxal 5'-phosphate)-dependent proteins were heterologously expressed and purified, but only the MA1610 protein catalysed the canonical threonine synthase reaction. The MA3297 protein specifically catalysed a new beta-replacement reaction that converted L-phosphoserine and sulfite into L-cysteate and inorganic phosphate. This oxygen-independent mode of sulfonate biosynthesis exploits the facile nucleophilic addition of sulfite to an alpha,beta-unsaturated intermediate (PLP-bound dehydroalanine). An amino acid sequence comparison indicates that cysteate synthase evolved from an ancestral threonine synthase through gene duplication, and the remodelling of active site loop regions by amino acid insertion and substitutions. The cysteate product can be converted into sulfopyruvate by an aspartate aminotransferase enzyme, establishing a new convergent pathway for coenzyme M biosynthesis that appears to function in members of the orders Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales. These differences in coenzyme M biosynthesis afford the opportunity to develop methanogen inhibitors that discriminate between the classes of methanogenic archaea.									33	0	0	0	29	0	38			0264-6021	1470-8728		WOS:000273211600015	19761441

We observed that, with an identical decrease in F-V/F-M in soybean leaves caused by different high temperature treatments, chlorophyll a fluorescence differed significantly, indicating different behaviors in the photosynthetic apparatus. The quantitative analysis showed that, with an identical F-V/F-M, leaves treated at 48 degrees C showed a higher W-K, an indicator of damage to the oxygen-evolving complex along with a lower O-2 evolution rate. compared with leaves treated at 45 degrees C. This demonstrated that the donor side of PSII was damaged more severely at 48 degrees C than at 45 degrees C despite the same decrease in F-V/F-M in the two heat-treated leaves. The ratios of Q(A)- and Q(B)-reducing PSII reaction centers to total PSII reaction centers were both lower in leaves treated at 48 degrees C than in leaves treated at 45 degrees C with an identical F-V/F-M, indicating that the acceptor side of PSII was also more damaged by heat treatment at 48 degrees C than at 45 degrees C. However, when damage to the donor side of PSII was similar in leaves treated at two different temperatures, the acceptor side of PSII was damaged less severely at 48 degrees C, which accounted for higher electron transport rate at the acceptor side of PSII in leaves treated at 48 degrees C than in leaves treated at 45 degrees C.

However, in alkaline electrolyzers, the slow kinetics of water splitting leads to their poor HER activities. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of novel hierarchical nanotubes of CoS/MoS2 and Co3S4/MoS2/Ni2P which exhibit prominent and durable HER capabilities in alkaline solution. Particularly, the Co3S4/MoS2/Ni2P nanotubes present an onset overpotential of 60 mV, a Tafel slope of 98 mV dec(-1), and a high exchange current density of 0.21 mA cm(-2), which are superior to those exhibited by many noble-metal-free electrocatalysts. The enhanced HER properties of the hybrid nanotubes could be related to their open hollow structure, large surface area and active site number, as well as the synergetic cooperation between different components. The results reported here may provide new inspirations for the construction of advanced nanostructures for promising catalytic applications.									51	1	0	0	2	0	51			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000417953100031

In-depth non-LTE chemical abundance analysis								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				516						A69	10.1051/0004-6361/201014136				JUN-JUL 2010	2010	Context. The interstellar medium is enriched primarily by matter ejected from evolved low and intermediate mass stars. The outflow from these stars creates a circumstellar envelope in which a rich gas-phase chemistry takes place. Complex shock-induced non-equilibrium chemistry takes place in the inner wind envelope, dust-gas reactions and ion-molecule reactions alter the abundances in the intermediate wind zone, and the penetration of cosmic rays and ultraviolet photons dissociates the molecules in the outer wind region.Aims. Little observational information exists on the circumstellar molecular abundance stratifications of many molecules. Furthermore, our knowledge of oxygen-rich envelopes is not as profound as for the carbon-rich counterparts. The aim of this paper is therefore to study the circumstellar chemical abundance pattern of 11 molecules and isotopologs ((12)CO, (13)CO, SiS, (28)SiO, (29)SiO, (30)SiO, HCN, CN, CS, SO, SO(2)) in the oxygen-rich evolved star IK Tau.Methods. We have performed an in-depth analysis of a large number of molecular emission lines excited in the circumstellar envelope around IK Tau. The analysis is done based on a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative transfer analysis, which calculates the temperature and velocity structure in a self-consistent way. The chemical abundance pattern is coupled to theoretical outer wind model predictions including photodestruction and cosmic ray ionization. Not only the integrated line intensities, but also the line shapes are used as diagnostic tool to study the envelope structure.Results. The deduced wind acceleration is much slower than predicted from classical theories. SiO and SiS are depleted in the envelope, possibly due to the adsorption onto dust grains. For HCN and CS a clear difference with respect to inner wind non-equilibrium predictions is found, either indicating uncertainties in the inner wind theoretical modeling or the possibility that HCN and CS (or the radical CN) participate in the dust formation. The low signal-to-noise profiles of SO and CN prohibit an accurate abundance determination; the modeling of high-excitation SO2 lines is cumbersome, possibly related to line misidentifications or problems with the collisional rates. The SiO isotopic ratios ((29)SiO/(28)SiO and (30)SiO/ (28)SiO) point toward an enhancement in (28)SiO compared to results of classical stellar evolution codes. Predictions for H(2)O emission lines in the spectral range of the Herschel/HIFI mission are performed.									80	0	0	0	2	0	80			0004-6361			WOS:000280275400084

Many semiconductor materials have been investigated over the past four decades although with huge financial constraints on experimental work to many research groups hindering faster research progress. In this paper, a numerical approach characterising the transport phenomena including reaction kinetics at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface is presented to facilitate a better understanding of the reactor with the aim of minimising the associated cost implications. The input photocurrent density is empirically evaluated from the standard reference solar spectra ASTM G173-03 using hematite as the semiconductor material of interest combined with other potential photoelectrodes. Charge transport and electrochemical kinetics in the two electrolyte chambers of a 2-D photoelectrochemical reactor model are simulated using Nernst Planck's and Butler Volmer equations respectively. Pure water (pH neutral) is used as the electrolyte in the model. An ion-permeable membrane is also included in the simulations to isolate the reaction products which would otherwise result in product losses and pose danger under normal operations of the reactor. Despite the slow dissociation rate of water, progress in dissociation and the proton movement from the anolyte to the catholyte were clearly noticed. The evolution of hydrogen and oxygen from the cathode and anode surfaces respectively are also reported. Gas concentration seem to appear close to the electrode surfaces where the reactions occur with the high concentration band progressively widening with the reactor height. Results also show that the ratio of increment in hydrogen concentration doubled that of oxygen which affirms the equilibrium reaction of water splitting. Increase in the photocurrent density also results in increased gas production. These results provide an impetus for further investigations on the behaviour of the reactor to inform future research work.					7th International Conference on Energy and Sustainability7th International Conference on Energy and Sustainability	20172017	Wessex Inst; Univ Seville; WIT Transact Ecol & Environm; Int Journal Energy Prod & ManagementWessex Inst; Univ Seville; WIT Transact Ecol & Environm; Int Journal Energy Prod & Management	Seville, SPAINSeville, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1743-3541		978-1-78466-222-6; 978-1-78466-221-9	WOS:000450031900034

The (Ba1-xLax)(Ti0.8Zr0.2)O-3, Pb-free ceramics, with nominal compositions (x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03) are synthesized in oxygen annealing atmosphere at 1673 K for 11 h using solid-state reaction method. While the X-ray diffraction confirmed the single phase formation, the secondary electron images revealed inhibited grain growth at a low concentration of La-doping but intermediate 2-dimensional grain growth at higher La-doping. The Raman peak appearing at 836 cm(-1) indicates La-substitution at Ba-site and vacancies at Ti-sites. The temperature dependent dielectric permittivity exhibits a broad diffuse phase transition at T-m = 230 K with a full width at half maxima (FWHM) of 289 K for 3 atomic % La-doped sample. The combined effect of oxygen annealing and La-doping results in an extremely broad diffuse phase transition.

J	Yokokawa, H								Understanding materials compatibility								ANNUAL REVIEW OF MATERIALS RESEARCH				33				581	610		10.1146/annurev.matsci.33.022802.093856				2003	2003	The use of chemical potential diagrams to examine interface chemistry is discussed in terms of the chemical reactions among oxides and associated interdiffusion across the interface. The driving force for both processes can be determined from the chemical potential values. The geometrical features of the chemical potential diagrams can be related to the valence stability of binary oxides and the stabilization energy of double oxides from the constituent oxides. The materials compatibility in solid oxide fuel cell materials is discussed with a focus on a lanthanum manganite cathode and a yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte. Emphasis is placed on the valence numbers of manganese in the fluorite solid solution and the perovskite oxides, which have been derived by thermodynamic analysis of the magnitude of the stabilization energy/interaction parameters as a function of ionic size for respective valence numbers. The change of manganese valence on La2Zr2O7 formation and Mn dissolution in YSZ are discussed in relation with the oxygen evolution/adsorption process. Oxygen flow associated with electrochemical reactions exhibits markedly different features depending on the direction of the polarization, which can lead to drastic changes in the interface chemistry (precipitation or interdiffusion).									100	4	0	0	0	0	103			1531-7331			WOS:000185093000020

For example, Co2+ is reported to show better performance of water oxidation than Co3+ in the Co-based spinel oxide, but its adjustment degree is small due to the geometrical occupation and the uniform synthetic environment. In this work, on the basis of chemical tailoring for the Ni-doped CoFe Prussia blue precursor, we demonstrate an inverse spinel NiCoFe oxide with dominant Co2+ (NiCoII(5)Fe-ONC). Interestingly, the introduction of Ni can promote the valence modulation in depth, which suggests the superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of the well-balanced and Co2+-rich CoFe oxide. Electrochemical measurements show that NiCoII(5)Fe-ONC can afford a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a low overpotential of only 220 mV in alkali, which is much better than that of RuO2. The robust catalytic performance results from the increased active sites, facile electron transfer and favorable adsorption/ desorption of intermediate products. The synergistic effect of Ni-doping and chemical tailoring on valence configuration has been studied in detail. This work provides a potential method to develop high-efficiency electrocatalysts and expands researchers' access to the 3d transition-metal catalysts in favor of valence engineering.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000729838300002		
J	Kelesidis, Georgios A.; Pratsinis, Sotiris E.				Pratsinis, Sotiris/AAL-9678-2020				Estimating the internal and surface oxidation of soot agglomerates								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				209				493	499		10.1016/j.combustflame.2019.08.001				NOV 2019	2019	Oxidation of soot takes place inside and on the surface of its constituent primary particles at a rate that depends on temperature, T, and O-2 concentration. Even though accurate oxidation kinetics are essential in both industrial uses and environmental impact of soot, they are often derived neglecting internal particle oxidation and the structure of such soot agglomerates. Here, the detailed evolution of the fractal-like agglomerate soot mass, m, and mobility diameter, d(m), during both internal and surface oxidation is determined by a moving sectional model. The model predictions are in excellent agreement with oxidation data of mature ethylene soot d(m) for T=900-1200 K. The oxidation mode index, a, given by the ratio of the characteristic O-2 reaction and diffusion times is used to quantify the contributions of internal and surface oxidation of soot. At low T (e.g., < 1100 K), O-2 diffuses into the primary particles and reacts with bulk soot, hardly altering the d(m) and yielding a > 3. As T increases, surface oxidation becomes dominant, decreasing both d(m) and a. The common assumption that soot agglomerates are spheres underestimates their d(m) up to 50% during oxidation. Coupling this detailed moving sectional model with soot mobility size distributions can yield realistic soot oxidation rates. Accounting for soot morphology and internal oxidation shows that the classic NSC rate increasingly underestimates (by 3-7 times) the oxidation rate of soot (from ethylene and toluene flames) with decreasing temperature (900-1800 K) and/or oxygen concentration (0.2-21 vol %).

The prepared catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM-EDS, HRTEM-EDS, and XPS methods to analyse their phase constitution, morphology feature, and surface composition. The major phase of manganese oxides was Mn3O4, which is a one-dimensional structure, and its growth was induced by Ti4O7. The ORR and OER catalytic activity can be enhanced due to the preferred orientation of manganese oxides. Electrochemical measurements, namely CV, LSV and EIS, were utilized for determining the ORR and OER catalytic activity, whereas CA and ADT were used for studying the durability and stability. A Li-O-2 battery was assembled to test the electrochemical behavior and properties in practical application. MnOx/Ti4O7 calcined at 300 degrees C exhibited the best catalytic activity of 0.72 V vs. RHE half-wave potential for ORR and 0.67 V vs. RHE overpotential for OER. The proportion of Mn3+ was also highest in all the MnOx/Ti4O7 composites. The assembled Li-O-2 battery shows high performance with a voltage gap of only 0.85 V. Therefore, it can be affirmed that the inducement of Ti4O7 could strengthen the preferred orientation in manganese oxide growth and Mn3+ in MnOx/Ti4O7 plays a vital role in catalyzing ORR and OER, with both improving the ORR and OER bifunctional catalytic performance of manganese oxides.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2046-2069		WOS:000607506000030	35424097

Our studies had proved that nano-TiO2 could promote photosynthesis and greatly improve spinach growth. However, the mechanism of nano-TiO2 on promoting conversion from light energy to electron energy and from electron energy to active chemistry energy remains largely unclear. In this study, we report that the electron transfer, oxygen evolution, and photophosphorylation of chloroplast (Chl) from nanoanatase-TiO2-treated spinach were greatly increased under visible light and ultraviolet light illumination. It was demonstrated that nanoanatase TiO2 could greatly improve whole chain electron transport, photoreduction activity of photosystem II, O-2-evolving and photophosphorylation activity of spinach Chl not only under visible light, but also energy-enriched electron from nanoanatase TiO2, which entered Chl under ultraviolet light and was transferred in photosynthetic electron transport chain and made NADP(+) be reduced into NADPH, and coupled to photophosphorylation and made electron energy be transformed to ATP. Moreover, nanoanatase h(+), which photogenerated electron holes, captured an electron from water, which accelerated water photolysis and O-2 evolution.									85	3	0	0	66	0	89			0163-4984	1559-0720		WOS:000249443700009	17914221

We show that, on a stoichiometric CeO2(111) surface, H-2 dissociates and forms surface hydroxyls (OH). On the pre-reduced CeO2-x samples, both films and powders, hydroxyls and hydrides (Ce-H) are formed on the surface as well as in the bulk, accompanied by the Ce3+ <-> Ce4+ redox reaction. As the O-v concentration increases, hydroxyl is destabilized and hydride becomes more stable. Surface hydroxyl is more stable than bulk hydroxyl, whereas bulk hydride is more stable than surface hydride. The surface hydride formation is the kinetically favorable process at relatively low temperatures, and the resulting surface hydride may diffuse into the bulk region and be stabilized therein. At higher temperatures, surface hydroxyls can react to produce water and create additional oxygen vacancies, increasing its concentration, which controls the H-2/CeO2 interaction. The results demonstrate a large diversity of reaction pathways, which have to be taken into account for better understanding of reactivity of ceria-based catalysts in a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.									20	3	0	0	1	0	21			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000618977800001	33355967

Menegh, which is known to form large colonies in Antarctic habitats, is subject to severe environmental stresses due to low temperature, draught and strong sunlight in summer. A considerable light-absorption by long-wavelength chlorophylls (LWC) at around 710 nm, which seem to consist of chlorophyll a, was detected in thallus of P. crispa harvested at a terrestrial environment in Antarctica. Absorption level at 710 nm against that at 680 nm was correlated with fluorescence emission intensity at 713 nm at room temperature and the 77 K fluorescence emission band from LWC was found to be emitted at 735 nm. We demonstrated that the LWC efficiently transfer excitation energy to photosystem II (PSII) reaction center from measurements of action spectra of photosynthetic oxygen evolution and P700 photo-oxidation. The global quantum yield of PSII excitation in thallus by far-red light was shown to be as high as by orange light, and the excitation balance between PSII and PSI was almost same in the two light sources. It is thus proposed that the LWC increase the photosynthetic productivity in the lower parts of overlapping thalli and contribute to the predominance of alga in the severe environment.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0005-2728	1879-2650		WOS:000508749700011	31825812

Tremendous efforts have been made to enhance g-C3N4 performance on HER; however, it is still far below the expectations in industrial production. Herein, we report a monodisperse CoP QDs-modified ultrafine g-C3N4 fiber (CoP/CNF) via in situ electrostatic adsorption deposition followed by low-temperature phosphatization treatment. The CoP/CNF showed an HER activity of 2.42 mmol h(-1) under visible light, 34.9 times higher than that of Pt/CNF, in which hydrogen bubbles evolution was observed with an apparent quantum efficiency of 59.9% at 420 nm. This benchmark HER activity was mainly because the CoP QDs could significantly suppress photoinduced charge recombination and improve the heterointerface HER rate. This work provides a useful strategy for designing highly active catalysts for solar-to-hydrogen fuel conversion.									15	0	0	0	3	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000509471800017

JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				122	42			10353	10357		10.1021/ja0005587				OCT 25 2000	2000	Photosynthesis produces molecular oxygen from water catalyzed by an enzyme whose active site contains a tetramanganese-oxo core of incompletely established structure. The first functional mimic of this core has been synthesized containing a cubical [Mn4O4](n+) core, surrounded by six facially bridging bidentate chelates to the manganese ions ((dpp)(6)Mn4O4 (1); dpp(-) = diphenylphosphinate anion). Bond enthalpy data predict that the Mn4O46+ core is thermodynamically capable of releasing molecular O-2, but is kinetically prevented from doing so by an activation barrier. UV light absorption into a Mn-O charge-transfer excited state (but not excitation of a Mn ligand-field excited state) efficiently releases an O-2 molecule if performed in the gas phase and concomitantly releases a bridging dpp- anion and the cationic species (dpp)(5)Mn4O2+ (presumed Mn4O2-butterfly core type). All species were identified by high resolution mass spectrometry. This reaction proceeds with high quantum efficiency (>50%) and is the only observable reaction channel. The O-2 product derived exclusively from the corner ore's of the cube based on photochemistry of the O-18-isotopomer, ((dpp)(6)Mn-4(O-18)(4) Neither O-2 release nor dpp- dissociation are observed individually to occur in the excited state, indicating that O-O bond formation and O-2 release require dissociation of one of the six dpp- chelates ("Jack-in-the-Box" mechanism for O-2 formation). By contrast, neither O-2 production nor chelate photodissociation are observed in condensed phases, presumably due to either quenching of the photoexcited state or rapid recombination of dpp- and (dpp)(5)Mn4O4+ in the solvent cage. Previous results show that chemical reduction of (1) in solution using hydrogen atom donors produces the deoxygenated (dpp)(6)Mn4O2 core and releases two water molecules as the only products. Thus the [Mn4O4](n+) cubane core is an intrinsically reactive core topology that facilitates both the selective chemical reduction of two of the four oxygen atom bridges to water molecules and their photorearrangement to an O-2 molecule under the control of chelation of the manganese ions by dpp-. These results may offer insight into the possible nature of the photosynthetic O-2-evolving mechanism.									149	2	1	0	32	0	150			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000090137000011

Herein, we report a strategy of engineering band structure by noble metal alloying (AgxAu1-x). The modulated composition of AgAu alloy nanoparticles loaded on rutile TiO2 to selectively tune SPR wavelengths and d-band position. We found that SPR-induced water oxidation activity varies as a function of the ratio of Au and Ag in AgxAu1-x/TiO2 photocatalysts, exhibiting"volcano-like" relationship between the oxygen evolution production rate and the metal-composition. The Ag0.6Au0.4/TiO2 photocatalyst shows superior water oxidation performance about 3-folds of individual Ag and Au. Photoemission spectra (PES) of alloy are in correlation with density of states, revealing the sensitivity of d-band onset energies and SPR excitation wavelengths. Furthermore, surface-photovoltage (SPV) response of alloy signifies the superiority of alloy in interfacial charge separation of hot carriers. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations validate the experimental results by revealing complex AgAu alloy-semiconductor (Ti-O-Au-Ag) for oxygen evolution along with electrodynamic simulations to trace distribution of electric-field components. This work demonstrates critical role of d-band tuning across alloy composition for boosting catalytic fraction through the integrated effects of light absorption, Schottky barrier height and d-band position of the plasmonic photocatalysts.									16	1	0	0	2	0	16			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000685243900002

Recombinant OEC23s from several plant species were produced in Escherichia coli to characterize the molecular mechanism of the OEC23 function then used in reconstitution experiments. One tobacco isoform, OEC23 (2AF), had much less oxygen-evolving activity than the spinach and cucumber OEC23s when PS II activities were reconstituted in salt-washed spinach PS II particles. The fact that the OEC23s had similar binding affinities for PS II particles suggests different ion-retention capacities for the individual OEC23s: The chimeric OEC23s produced between spinach and 2AF and those produced between cucumber and 2AF show that 58 N-terminal amino acid residues are important for PS II activity. Further dissection of the sequence and site-directed mutagenesis indicated the importance of 20 N-terminal amino acid residues for activity, in particular the asparagine at the 15th position. In spinach the N15D mutation decreased PS II activity, whereas in 2AF the D15N mutation increased it. This shows the importance of the N-terninal sequence of OEC23 in ion retention during the water-splitting process. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The Astrophysical P-30(p,gamma)S-31 reaction rate is a key quantity used in nova models that predict isotopic abundances produced during nucleosynthesis leading up to the outburst. Currently, there is a large uncertainty in the rate at nova temperatures (0.1 < T < 0.4 GK) causing the predicted Si-30 abundance ratio to vary by a factor of 4. The P-30(p,gamma)S-31 reaction rate can be determined indirectly by measuring triton momenta from S-32(d,t)S-31 reactions. S-31 Resonant states measured up to 600 keV above the proton threshold of 6131 keV and within the Gamow window which contribute most significantly to the rate can then be used to re-evaluate the rate for nova temperatures and reduce the uncertainty.

Water oxidation (WO) is one of the most promising and fascinating research fields, offering environmentally friendly renewable fuel sources. However, to make this a reality, efficient WO electrocatalysts (WOEs) have to be prepared from readily available and cost-effective sources. The catalytic activity of WOEs is directly related to their structure and synthesis process. Thus, researchers have focused on preparing Ni and Co (Ni/Co) oxide WOEs through various thermal treatment processes (TTPs) owing to their simplicity, cost effectiveness, and ability to tune the physicochemical properties of the WOEs. In this review, the effect of TTPs on the catalytic activity of Ni/Co oxide-based WOEs were carefully evaluated. To do so the effect of TTPs on the structure-activity relationship (SAR), their advantages and limitations, and how these methods can be properly optimized for preparing Ni/Co oxide WOEs has been discussed based on published reports. Also, the electrochemical techniques and parameters that are most commonly utilized in determining the catalytic activity of WOEs has been discussed along with a general mechanism for WO at the Ni/Co oxide electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1364-0321	1879-0690		WOS:000663169400005

In contrast to the binding of cognate glutamine, one oxygen of the charged glutamate carboxylate group makes a direct ion-pair interaction with the strictly conserved Arg30 residue located in the first half of the dinucleotide fold domain. The nucleophilic alpha-carboxylate moiety of glutamate is mispositioned with respect to both the ATP alpha-phosphate and terminal tRNA ribose groups, suggesting that a component of amino acid discrimination resides at the catalytic step of the reaction. Further, the other side-chain carboxylate oxygen of glutamate is found in a position identical to that previously proposed to be occupied by the NH2 group of the cognate glutamine substrate. At this position, the glutamate oxygen accepts hydrogen bonds from the hydroxyl moiety of Tyr211 and a water molecule. These findings demonstrate that amino acid specificity by GlnRS cannot arise from hydrogen bonds donated by the cognate glutamine amide to these same moieties, as previously suggested. Instead, Arg30 functions as a negative determinant to drive binding of non-cognate glutamate into a non-productive orientation. The poorly differentiated cognate amino acid-binding site in GlnRS may be a consequence of the late emergence of this enzyme from the eukaryotic lineage of glutamyl-tRNA synthetases.

However, to achieve stable operation, grand challenges remain to be resolved, such as preventing electrolyte decomposition and degradation of carbon, a commonly used air electrode in Li-O-2 batteries. In this work, using in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, it is demonstrated that the application of a ZnO coating on the carbon electrode can effectively suppress side reactions occurring in the Li-O-2 battery. By probing the CO2 evolution during charging of C-13-labeled air electrodes, the major sources of parasitic reactions are precisely identified, which further reveals that the ZnO coating retards the degradation of both the carbon electrode and electrolyte. The successful suppression of the degradation results in a higher oxygen efficiency, leading to enhanced stability for more than 100 cycles. Nevertheless, the degradation of the carbon electrode is not completely prevented by the coating, because the Li2O2 discharge product gradually grows at the interface between the ZnO and carbon, which eventually results in detachment of the ZnO particles from the electrode and subsequent deterioration of the performance. This finding implies that surface protection of the carbon electrode is a viable option to enhance the stability of Li-O-2 batteries; however, fundamental studies on the growth mechanism of the discharge product on the carbon surface are required along with more effective coating strategies.									43	0	0	0	1	0	44			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000435724600003

In addition, NaBH4 not only can act as a reductant to introduce V4+ and oxygen vacancies directly, but also provided a higher pressure and stronger alkali environment during the hydrothermal process which promoted the morphology change from microspheres to ellipsoid/dumbbell shape. More importantly, the prepared samples had excellent photoelectrochemical performance which was mainly embodied in enhanced photocurrent density, smaller charge transfer resistance, longer electrons lifetime and improving separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, these were mainly attributed to the V4+ and oxygen vacancies can serve as charge carrier traps as well as adsorption sites where the charge transfer to adsorbed species inhibits the surface charge recombination. What's more, the morphology evolution mechanism and the function mechanism of the V4+-doped BiVO4 were discussed in detail simultaneously. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, this short-range effect and the huge structural differences make it a significant challenge to obtain the desired electrocatalyst with atomically thin noble metal layers. Here, we demonstrated the combinatorial strategies to fabricate the heterostructure electrocatalyst of Mo2C-coupled Pd atomic layers (AL-Pd/Mo2C) by precise control of metal-organic framework confinement and covalent interaction. Both atomic characterizations and density functional theory calculations uncovered that the strong electron effect imposed on Pd atomic layers has intensively regulated the electronic structures and d-band center and then optimized the reaction kinetics. Remarkably, AL-Pd/Mo2C showed the highest ORR electrochemical activity and stability, which delivered a mass activity of 2.055 A mg(pd)(-1) at 0.9 V, which is 22.1, 36.1, and 80.3 times higher than Pt/C, Pd/C, and Pd nanoparticles, respectively. The present work has developed a novel approach for atomically noble metal catalysts and provides new insights into interfacial electron regulation.									24	1	0	0	0	0	25			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000651748000024	33915042

Herein, we designed phthalocyanine-porphyrin-based conjugated microporous polymers as precursors for fabrication of Co, Fe, N tri-doped graphene composites towards oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER). As expected, the elements cobalt and iron are well dispersed in graphene carbon and interact with the nitrogen sites, thereby providing extra electrocatalytic active sites and enhancing its overall conductivity. Benefiting from its unique design and structure, the obtained catalyst affords a superior bifunctional catalytic activity with a positive onset potential of 0.957 V for ORR, and a low overpotential of 0.36 V for OER. More attractively, the CoFeNG is employed as an air cathode catalyst in Zn-air batteries, showing a maximum current density of 215 mA cm(-2) and good cycle stability for 20000 s. The rational design of phthalocyanine-porphyrin-based derivatives provides a feasible route for the construction of high-performance ORR/OER catalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000535056000001	32390301

However, the unsatisfied HER performance originated from the strong charge recombination of g-C3N4 severely inhibits the further large-scale application of g-C3N4. In this case, the utilization of cocatalysts is a novel frontline in the g-C3N4-based photocatalytic systems due to the positive effects of cocatalysts on supressing charge carrier recombination, reducing the HER overpotential, and improving photocatalytic activity. This review summarizes some recent advances about the high-performance cocatalysts based on g-C3N4 toward HER. Specifically, the functions, design principle, classification, modification strategies of cocatalysts, as well as their intrinsic mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic HER activity are discussed here. Finally, the pivotal challenges and future developments of cocatalysts in the field of HER are further proposed.									66	2	0	0	8	0	66			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000678059700001	34318978

Cocatalyst loading, which is an appealing strategy, has been extensively employed to improve the photocatalytic efficiency semiconductors. In view of the high cost and rare preservation of noble metal cocatalysts that significantly hinder their utilization for large-scale energy production, various cocatalysts comprising earth-abundant elements have been developed as noble-metal-free candidates using different methods to boost photocatalytic water splitting. Among these preparation strategies, photodeposition has attracted tremendous attention in the deposition of earth-abundant cocatalysts owing to its simplicity and moderate availability, improved interfacial charge separation and transfer, and abundant active sites on the surface. In this review, we first summarize the deposition principles, deposition advantages, categories of cocatalysts, roles of cocatalysts, influencing factors, modification strategies, and design considerations in the photodeposition of earth-abundant cocatalysts. The photodeposited earth-abundant cocatalysts for the photocatalytic H-2 evolution half reaction, photocatalytic O-2 evolution half reaction, and overall photocatalytic water splitting are discussed. Finally, some perspectives on the challenges and possible future directions for the photodeposition of earth-abundant cocatalysts in photocatalytic water splitting are presented.

The pyrolytic process was tracked via measurements of crystallinity, carbon defect, specific surface area, heterogeneous elemental doping and elemental distribution. The decomposition process was elucidated by TG-MS; the electrochemical characteristics of the residue were deduced from synchrotron XAFS combined with HRTEM, XRD and XPS (Ni(C26H28N3O4) -> Ni/NiOx + (CxHy, H-2, CO2 + CH3O) -> Ni/NiOx@NCs). An optimized specimen (coded S-Ni-800) provided 268 mV overpotential in OERs and 1.353 V in UORs, and was stable for 15 hours in an alkaline medium. This model study underscores the importance of thermal tracking in the design of Ni-derived carbon nanomaterial electrocatalysts that are associated with OERs/UORs at low potentials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2052-1553			WOS:000771685700001

The effects of experimental parameters including cobalt precursor, reaction times, and reaction temperatures are investigated on the structure, morphology and electrocatalytic properties of CoS2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The characterization of as-prepared catalysts is performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The HER efficiency of the catalysts is examined using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Furthermore, chronoamperometry (CA) is used for stability evaluation. The catalyst obtained from cobalt acetate precursor, within 24 h at 200 degrees C exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity with a low onset potential (139.3 mV), low overpotential (197.3 mV) at 10 mA. cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 29.9 mV dec(-1). This study is a step toward understanding the effect of experimental parameters of the hydrothermal method on HER performance and developing optimal design approaches for the synthesis of CoS2 as a common electrocatalyst.

However, most of them are partly composed by scarce and precious metals, thus hampering their large-scale utilization. In this regard, developing efficient electrocatalysts with reduced noble metals loading or without noble metals is highly desirable. In the past decade, carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-based electrocatalysts have proven to be efficient in many typical electrocatalytic reactions, and its strong structure operability and easy accessibility enable the utilization of related electrocatalysts to be sustainable. This review is aimed to summarize the research progress in CNTs-based electrocatalysts, which are widely used in various electrochemical reactions. The major structure regulation approaches toward CNTs-based electrocatalysts are highlighted. The primary functions of CNTs-based electrocatalysts in electrochemical reactions are also highlighted here, together with the discussions on the support effect related to CNTs. Synchrotron-based spectroscopies which can explore the intrinsic structure details that contribute to the performance enhancement and the electrochemical structure evolution of electrocatalysts under working conditions are also discussed. Finally, the challenges for shedding light on the very essence of the activity and the research perspectives are suggested.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000714626300001

By simply rotating the polarization of the incident light, we can switch between resonant excitation and non-resonant excitation, while keeping all other parameters of the measurement constant. With light polarized perpendicular to the lines in the grating (i.e., TE-polarization), the photocatalytic reaction rate (i.e., photocurrent) is measured as the angle of the incident laser light is tuned through the resonance with the grating. Here, hot holes photoexcited in the metal are used to drive the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), producing a measurable photocurrent. Using TE-polarized light, we observe sharp peaks in the photocurrent and sharp dips in the photoreflectance at approximately 9 degrees from normal incidence, which corresponds to the conditions under which there is good wavevector matching between the incident light and the lines in the grating. With light polarized parallel to the grating (i.e., TM), we excite the grating structure non-resonantly and there is no angular dependence in the photocurrent or photoreflectance. In order to quantify the lifetime of these hot carriers, we performed transient absorption spectroscopy of these plasmon resonant grating structures. Here, we observe one feature in the spectra corresponding to interband transitions and another feature associated with the plasmon resonant mode in the grating. Both features decay over a time scale of 1-2 ps. The spectral responses of grating structures fabricated with Ag, Al, and Cu are also presented.									12	2	0	0	0	0	12			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000474779400020	31049541

This rate process has been investigated by dynamic and isothermal DSC experiments, complemented with isothermal rate studies based on gas evolution in a vacuum apparatus, together with some product analyses. It is concluded that the overall reaction is complicated, including several concurrent contributing chemical changes, in which sulphite oxidation to sulphate is a dominant process, accompanied by some nitrate decomposition. On heating to higher temperatures (above 800 K) a second endothermic reaction was identified as the melting and breakdown of calcium nitrate. These processes occurred at temperatures somewhat less than those characteristic of the pure salt, possibly due to the presence of products from the first reaction including small amounts of Ca(NO2)(2). The dominant exothermic reaction was accompanied by fusion, at temperatures significantly below the melting point of either reactant. This may be due to the intermediate formation of Ca(NO2)(2), melting point 551 K, or the generation of liquid product following hydrolysis reactions with water evolved during dehydration of reactant CaSQ(3). 1/2H(2)O, with which the exothermic oxidation overlapped. This dehydration step was a precursor to sulphite oxidation. A detailed reaction mechanism is not proposed here due to the difficulties of separating the contributions from the several probable concurrent participating reactions. The role of the fluid reactant believed to be active in the oxidation process, and containing NO3-, NO2-, SO32- and possibly SO42-, in desulphurization processes, is discussed as a possible route towards removing the precursors to acid rain from coal combustion emissions. It is known that CaCO3 reacts with NOx to form Ca(NO3)(2), The present work identifies the liquid medium recognized in the exothermic reaction as enabling the oxidation of CaSO3 --> CaSO4 to proceed to completion at a.lower temperature than the slow and product-opposed reaction of CaSO3 with oxygen gas. Aspects of the chemistry of this complicated reaction and its potential value in pollution abatement are discussed.

Herein, we have utilized waste PET plastic to synthesize nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon functionalized zinc oxide (ZnO@NMC) nanocomposite through MOF-5 construction by low temperature solvothermal method for the first time. As per current energy needs, sustainable hydrogen production through water splitting is the modern appealing solution across the globe. The existence of carbon and nitrogen in ZnO@NMC nanocomposite were confirmed by several analytical techniques i.e. XRD, FTIR, CHN, and XPS. High specific surface area of (939 m(2)/g) and meso-porosity (pore radius similar to 25 angstrom) may offer large number of active sites and easy charge relocation for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions via electro-catalysis. The prepared ZnO@NMC nanocomposite exhibits enhanced electro-catalytic activity for HER and OER in 0.5 M KOH solution. Tafel slope and over-potential (eta(10)) of ZnO@NMC nanocomposite were found to be similar to 108 mV/dec and 0.39 mV, correspondingly, for HER in 0.5 M KOH. ZnO@NMC nanocomposite also shows efficient OER electro-activity with Tafel slope and over-potential (eta(10)) of similar to 318 mV/dec and similar to 0.57 V respectively. ZnO@NMC nanocomposite shows better electro-catalytic performance compared to the reported pure ZnO nanostructures. Moreover, the constancy test was also checked through chrono-amperometry (CA) at fixed potential. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The four CS isotopomers were detected in 20 star forming regions with galactocentric distances between 3 and 9 kpc. From a comparison of line velocities, the (CS)-S-33 J=2-1 rest frequency is similar to 250 kHz below the value given in the Lovas (1992) catalog. Taking C-12/C-13 ratios from Wilson & Rood (1994) and assuming equal (CS)-C-12-S-32 and (CS)-C-13-S-32 excitation temperatures and beam filling factors, (CS)-C-12-S-32 opacities are in the range 3 to 15; average S-32/S-34 and S-34/S-33 isotope ratios are-24.4 +/- 5.0 and 6.27 +/- 1.01, respectively. While no systematic variation in the S-34/S-33 isotope ratio is found, the S-32/S-34 ratio increases with galactocentric distance when accounting for the C-12/C-13 gradient of the galactic disk. A fit to the unweighted data yields S-32/S-34 = 3.3 +/- 0.5 (D-GC/kpc) + 4.1 +/- 3.1 with a correlation coefficient of 0.84. Since the interstellar sulfur (S) isotopes are synthesized by oxygen burning in massive stars, consequences for nucleosynthesis and models of chemical evolution are briefly discussed(1).									103	2	0	0	1	0	104			0004-6361			WOS:A1996TR76900039

RuPy2 and RuPy6 act as redox photosensitizers in the presence of the S2O82- sacrificial electron acceptor and the K2xCo(3-x)[Fe(CN)(6)](2)center dot nH(2)O, Prussian-blue-type, water-oxidation catalyst; however, their photosensitizing efficiencies were lower than that of [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) because of their lower reactivities with S2O82-, probably due to steric hindrance associated with the pyridyl groups. Interestingly, the photosensitizing efficiency of RuPy2 was significantly improved through immobilization on TiO2 nanoparticles (RuPy2@TiO2), while the efficiency of RuPy6 was hardly improved by immobilization.

Qi, H; Zhao, B		Modeling of a Single Char Particle Burning in Oxygen-enriched O-2/N-2 and O-2/CO2 Environment								CLEANER COMBUSTION AND SUSTAINABLE WORLD								614	620						2012	2012	The combustion characteristics of pulverized coal in O-2/CO2 were reported considerably different from those in conventional air combustion. Properly describing the combustion behaviors of coal particles at elevated O-2 levels in both oxy-firing and air firing is essential for the design and simulation of the advance combustion systems. The objective of the present work is to describe the rate-limit step of coal conversion, i.e., the combustion process of char particles with modeling approach. In order to understand the reasons to cause the differences when replacing N-2 with CO2 in the oxidant stream, a fundamental model has been developed to describe in detail the combustion of a single pulverized char particle at elevated O-2 mole fractions in either N-2 or CO2 balance gas. The model includes char oxidation and a kinetic scheme which is coupled with the diffusive properties within the particle and in the boundary layer. The main features of the model include: 1) The properties e.g., thermal conductivity and diffusivities, of the gaseous species in the gas mixture are modeled in detail; 2) The model considers the distributions of carbon reactivity and structure, temperature and gas concentrations within the particle and their evolutions during the conversion process; 3) Thermal annealing and its impact on the evolution of carbon reactivity are considered; 4) The model describes the intra-particle reactions and diffusion as well as the reactions, particularly CO oxidation, and diffusion outside the particle. The model is validated with the comparisons of particle surface temperature between the calculation results and the experimental data of char particle combustion reported in the literature. The oxygen concentration involved covers from normal concentration to up to 100% for both O-2/CO2 and O-2/N-2 combustion. Model results represent that coal particles burned at lower mean temperatures in O-2/CO2 than in O-2/N-2 environments at analogous oxygen mole fractions. Additionally, the model has also been applied to numerically investigate the effects of char property and combustion condition parameters on the combustion process so as to explore the applicability of model in prediction char conversion process in practice.					7th International Symposium on Coal Combustion (ISCC)7th International Symposium on Coal Combustion (ISCC)	JUL 17-20, 2011JUL 17-20, 2011	Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; China Int Culture Exchange Ctr; Tsinghua Univ; Harbin Inst Technol; Tsinghua Univ, Inst Thermal EngnNatl Nat Sci Fdn China; China Int Culture Exchange Ctr; Tsinghua Univ; Harbin Inst Technol; Tsinghua Univ, Inst Thermal Engn	Harbin Inst Technol, Combust Engn Res Inst, Harbin, PEOPLES R CHINAHarbin Inst Technol, Combust Engn Res Inst, Harbin, PEOPLES R CHINA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1					978-3-642-30444-6	WOS:000398884500128		
J	Yang, Zhen-Xing; Ye, Fang-Fang; Pan, Ding; Yan, Guang-Xu; Guo, Shao-Hui								Synthesis and evaluation of Mn-Sn modified Ru-Ir electrode for electrocatalytic treatment of high chloride acrylonitrile wastewater								ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY											10.1080/09593330.2022.2057237		MAR 2022			2022	Acrylonitrile wastewater was an organic wastewater with strong toxicity and poor biodegradability. Therefore, electro-catalytic technology became a promising acrylonitrile wastewater treatment technology because of no secondary pollution, wide application range and low water quality requirements. The optimal Mn-Sn modified Ru-Ir electrode material was synthesized by thermal method and applied in electro-catalytic treatment of acrylonitrile wastewater. The electrode materials were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS and electrochemical characterization. SEM, TEM, XRD and XPS indicated that Mn and Sn were capable of incorporating and replacing the part of Ru or Ir and could alter the microstructure of Ru-Ir and the types of Mn and Sn oxides, raising the oxygen evolution potential (OEP) and voltampere charge. When the molar ratio of Mn-Sn was 1:1, OEP, voltampere charge and exchange current density could reach 1.303 V, 1.51 C/cm2 and 6.29x10-4 A/cm2, respectively. The co-doping of Mn-Sn had significant influence on the electrocatalytic performance of Ru-Ir electrode materials. The optimum synthesis conditions of Mn-Sn modified Ru-Ir electrode were as follows: the molar ratio of Mn-Sn was 1:1, calcination time was 4.0 hours, calcination temperature was 450celcius, and solvent was water. Under certain conditions, the removal rate of acrylonitrile with Mn-Sn modified Ru-Ir electrode was 100%. Mn-Sn modified Ru-Ir electrode had high oxygen evolution potential and good removal effect of acrylonitrile, which was higher than that of ruthenium iridium electrode and RuO2 electrode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0959-3330	1479-487X		WOS:000777302000001	35316146

Kinetics of Hydrogen Oxidation and Hydrogen Evolution Reactions on Nanostructured Thin-Film Platinum Alloy Catalyst								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				160	3			F251	F261		10.1149/2.028303jes				2013	2013	Kinetics of hydrogen oxidation (HOR) and hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions on nanostructured thin-film (NSTF) ternary Pt0.68Co0.3Mn0.02 catalyst was investigated in a 50-cm(2) polymer electrolyte fuel cell operated in H-2 pump mode with super-saturated feeds, at 45-90 degrees C and 0.7-2.5 atm H-2 partial pressures. The results showed that the HOR and HER are completely reversible, and that both of these reactions can be described by the same Butler-Volmer kinetics with first-order dependence on the H-2 partial pressure. The specific exchange current density for the 2-electron HOR/HER on the NSTF ternary catalyst, derived from the measured polarization curves, is 489 mA.cm(Pt)(-2) at 80 degrees C and 1-atm H-2 partial pressure. The temperature dependence of the exchange current density is consistent with an activation energy of 38.9 kJ.mol(-1). Compared to dispersed Pt/C catalyst with an ultralow 0.003 mg.cm(-2) Pt loading, the HOR kinetics on NSTF catalyst with 0.05-0.10 mg.cm(-2) Pt loading was 60-110% faster on an area-specific basis, but it was slower on a mass basis. The measured HOR/HER kinetics is a function of the state of the catalyst in that the specific exchange current density increased by 460% when the anode catalyst was conditioned with the same protocol normally used for the cathode catalyst.

In this study, 1-Co was synthesized via solvothermal synthesis using cobalt nitrate and BPTA (BPTA = 3,5-bis(4-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazolyl). Based on 1-Co, through doping PMDA (pyromellitic dianhydride) organic ligands, Co/NC@PMDA could be obtained after calcination. The as-synthesized Co/NC@PMDA played an effective role in catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Under a low overpotential of 266 mV, the current density of Co/NC@PMDA can reach 10 mA cm(-2). Also, the Co/NC@PMDA material has a high Tafel slope (135.3 mV dec(-1)) and excellent stability. At the same time, we used cobalt nitrate, BPTA and PMDA to synthesize a Co-MOF, and the result showed that its HER performance was worse than that of Co/NC@PMDA. This study provides a feasible idea for the synthesis of HER catalysts with excellent performance in the future.									5	0	0	0	0	0	4				2052-1537		WOS:000700481900001

Here we construct an efficient photocatalytic system to evolve ROS for environmental purification. In the work, the coordinated g-C3N4 photocatalysts (Cu/C3N4) are designed by interacting N 2p lone electrons at vacancy site of tri-s-triazine polymer with 3d orbits of Cu2+, resulting in the extended pi-delocalization structure of g-C3N4. Experimental and theoretical calculations confirm that the extended pi-delocalization structure of Cu/C3N4 strengthens the light capturing capability from ultraviolet to near infrared light, favors the charge transfer from N 2p of C-3-N to the linked C, and Cu atoms. As a result, the efficient evolution of ROS including O-2(-) (13 mu mol L-1 h(-1)), and H2O2 (550 mu mol L-1 h(-1)) can be completed over Cu/C3N4 photocatalysts. Cu/C3N4 photocatalysts results in a highly efficient generation of ROS and also exhibited a sustainable removal efficiency for NO, and HCHO, which demonstrates a promising application in the field of environmental purification.									40	3	0	0	9	0	40			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000464487500028

In this study, the identity and quantity of flavor compounds were determined for extra virgin olive oil packaged in 0.5-L glass, poly(ethylene terephthalate), and poly(vinyl chloride) bottles and stored at 15, 30, and 40degreesC under fluorescent light or in the dark for 1 yr. A set of mathematical equations concerning the rates of the most fundamental oxidation reactions in the oil was prepared and numerically solved, and the reaction constants were estimated for specific temperature values. Mainly, the presence of fluorescent light, followed by elevated temperature, stimulated oxidative alterations in the olive oil. Separated and identified flavor compounds were recorded for all the olive oil samples. Based on their abundance and evolution in the oil samples, those most clearly describing oxidation were hexanal, nonanal, (E)-2-decenal, (E)-2-heptenal, and 2-pentyl furan. These compounds could be used as markers of the oxidation process to monitor and describe the quality of packaged olive oil quantitatively.									36	0	0	0	21	0	36			0003-021X			WOS:000220655400008

The structures under consideration are rather diverse and cover a wide spectrum. This Account will summarize current works on the synthetic concepts leading toward those systems and cover the application side where emphasis is set on the exploration of those systems as candidates for unusual high-performance catalysis, electrocatalysis, electrochemical energy storage, and artificial photosynthesis.These issues are motivated by the new global energy cycles and the fact that sustainable technologies should not be based on rare and expensive resources. We therefore present the strategic design of functionality in cost-effective, affordable artificial materials starting from a spectrum of simple synthetic options to end up with carbon- and nitrogen-based porous frameworks. Following the synthetic strategies, we demonstrate how the electronic structure of polymeric frameworks can be tuned and how this can modify property profiles in a very unexpected fashion. Covalent triazine-based frameworks (CTFs), for instance, showed both enormously high energy and high power density in lithium and sodium battery systems. Other C,N-based organic frameworks, such as triazine-based graphitic carbon nitride, are suggested to show promising band gaps for many (photo)electrochemical reactions. Nitrogen-rich carbonaceous frameworks, which are developed from C,N-based organic framework strategies, are highlighted in order to address their promising electrocatalytic properties, such as in the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). With careful design, those materials can be multifunctional catalysts, such as a bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalyst.Although the majority of new C,N-based materials are still not competitive with the best (usually nonsustainable candidates) for each application, the framework/N approach as such is still in its infancy and has already moved organic materials to regions where otherwise only traditional noble metals or special inorganic semiconductors are found. As one potential way to enhance the properties of polymeric frameworks, the idea of catalysts having unique active surfaces based on Mott-Schottky heterojunctions and related concepts are addressed.In order to integrate all of the above versatile subjects from synthesis to applications on C,N-based organic frameworks, we begin the discussion with synthetic concepts and strategies for these frameworks to distinguish these systems from typical covalent organic frameworks based on boron oxide rings. Next we focus on the semiconducting properties of C,N-based organic frameworks in order to show a continuous transition between CTFs and other systems, such as graphitic carbon nitrides. At the end, applications of these materials are shown by highlighting their properties in electrochemical energy storage and photo- and electro catalysis.									179	12	0	0	10	0	181			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000356754600006	26000989

Here, N,O-codoped carbon spheres with uniform mesopores and a high specific surface area were used as supports for decorating Co3O4 nanoparticles via a facile immersion route. In addition to the benefit of ions and gas mass transfer, the abundant mesopores present in the three-dimensional (3D) carbon spheres also confine and isolate the Co3O4 nanoparticles growing in it, which help to provide rich Co3O4 active sites. The resulting hybrid material exhibits superior ORR activity in terms of even-better half-wave potential and stability than that of commercial Pt/C (40 wt%) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. To verify its catalytic activity, the hybrid material was employed as the cathode catalyst in a flexible solid-state zinc-air battery, which achieves a high power density of 227 mW cm(-2); this power density is much higher than that of a Pt/C catalytic zinc-air battery (133 mW cm(2)) under identical conditions. The improvement in catalytic activity in both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes can be attributed to the abundant active sites of the entangled Co3O4 nanoparticles, as well as the novel N,O-codoped carbon structure.

To enhance nanocatalyst performance and durability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), we prepare 3.6 nm sized PtFe particles with a fully ordered intermetallic structure and entrap them in a porous carbon (PtFe@C). This nanocatalyst toward ORR exhibits 8-10 times enhancement in specific and mass activities over the commercial catalyst of Pt/C. Such a large enhancement is the highest, when compared with all other kinds of intermetallic catalysts reported in the literature. Accelerated durability testing has induced only a small change to the ordered structure and a minor loss of the activity after thousands of potential cycles under harsh electrochemical conditions. The high activity and durability are attributed to the fine-grained and ordered structure of the nanoparticle and the confining effect provided by the porous carbon. The nanoparticle, PtFe@C, represents a new strategy for performance optimization and cost reduction and promoting practical applications of fuel cells.									131	10	0	0	2	0	130			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000384921700017

In this work, a hierarchical-array structure is elaborately established, with the characteristics of each Co1-xS nanorod (NR) enwrapped by nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) and a vertically aligned MoS2 nanosheet (NS) array, and the Co1-xS NRs themselves as arrays in situ grown on carbon fibers of the substrate. Such an open array framework sufficiently guarantees rapid mass/charge diffusion/transport and a high utilization of active centers, wherein hexagonal Co1-xS NR and MoS2-NS edges separately personate as active sites for OER and HER. Furthermore, their electrocatalytic activities are intrinsically improved after being integrated as a composite. The synthesized Co1-xS(NR)gMoS(2)(NS)-NC composite exhibits an HER overpotential of merely 66 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), with a Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1) and an extremely high TOF of 1.54 s(-1) at 200 mV overpotential, and, meanwhile, sponsors an OER overpotential of 234 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and an exceptionally low Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution.

PCC6803 ceased upon expression of Rhodobacter sphaeroides chlorophyllide a reductase (COR). However, an increase in cytosolic superoxide dismutase level in the recombinant Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 completely reversed the growth cessation. This demonstrates that COR generates superoxide in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Considering the dissolved oxygen (DO) level suitable for COR, the intracellular DO of this oxygenic photosynthetic cell appears to be low enough to support COR-mediated superoxide generation. The growth arrest of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 by COR may give an insight into the evolutionary path from bacteriochlorophyll a biosynthetic pathway to chlorophyll a, which bypasses COR reaction.

Herein, we report a one-step facile synthesis of ultrasmall tungsten phosphide nanoparticles (WP NPs) embedded within a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) matrix (WP NPs@NC). The optimized catalyst, consisting of WP NPs of less than 5 nm diameter encapsulated by ultrathin carbon shells, shows excellent HER activity in strongly acidic media with a low onset overpotential (40 mV), high current density (j = 10 mA cm(-2) at h = 102 mV), small Tafel slope (58 mV dec(-1)), and superior durability (4 days). The as-prepared WP NPs@NC catalyst also offers excellent HER activity in both neutral and alkaline conditions, as well as remarkable durability. This synthesis strategy opens up a new avenue for obtaining transition metal phosphide nanoparticles as a new class of non-noble-metal electrocatalysts for water splitting and hydrogen generation.									93	5	0	0	3	0	94			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000386310600008

The annealing behavior of these radiation defects was found to be complicated in the presence of Ge. The main reaction VO + O-i -> VO2 leading to annealing of VO defects and formation Of VO2 complexes turned out to be sensitive to concentrations of Ge impurity atoms in Czochralski grown silicon. These processes are discussed in some detail. Moreover, the rates of annealing reactions associated with self-interstitials can also be enhanced in silicon materials doped with Ge.

Herein, in situ chemical H intercalation into ultrafine Pd to activate this otherwise HER-inferior material to form the ultrafine IrPdH hydride as an efficient and stable HER electrocatalyst is proposed. The formation of PdIrH depends on a new hydrogenation strategy via using ethanol as the hydrogen resource. It is demonstrated that H atoms in IrPdH originate from the -OH and -CH2- of ethanol, which fills the gap of ethanol as the hydrogen source for the preparation of Pd hydride. Thanks to the incorporation of H/Ir atoms and ultrafine structure, the IrPdH exhibits superior HER activity and stability in the whole pH range. The IrPdH delivers very low overpotentials of 14, 25 and 60 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) respectively in 0.5 m H2SO4, 1 m KOH, and 1 m PBS electrolytes, which are much better than those of commercial Pt/C and most reported noble metal electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations confirm that interstitial hydrogen availably refines the electronic density of Pd and Ir sites, which optimizes the adsorption of *H and leads to the significant enhancement of HER performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000837016400001	35934833

Comparing with the pristine Mn0.2Cd0.8S composite, the obtained ultrathin MoS2/Mn0.2Cd0.8S composites exhibited a significantly improved photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution from water with visible light response. The optimized photocatalytic activity toward MoS2/Mn0.2Cd0.8S composite is around 8 times of the pristine Mn0.2Cd0.8S composite. Moreover, the ultrathin MoS2/Mn0.2Cd0.8S composites displayed good photocatalytic stability in the course of photochemical reaction. The excellent photocatalytic activity of the ultrathin MoS2/Mn0.2Cd0.8S composites might be attributed to the formed heterojunctions in composites itself and the sufficient active edge sites in MoS2 phase. A possible photocatalytic mechanism was tentatively proposed. Considering its excellent photocatalytic activity and good photochemical stability, the obtained ultrathin MoS2/Mn0.2Cd0.8S composite has potential application in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water by using solar energy.

Reactions of chemically generated superoxide with this electrolyte show that virtually no decomposition products such as lithium formate are generated. When the electrolyte is employed in a Li-O-2 battery, a ten-fold decrease in CO2 evolution is evident on charge by comparison to DME and greatly enhanced cycling stability is observed with TiC as a cathode support. A mechanism is proposed to account for the lowered reactivity, offering new insight into the stability of organic electrolytes in Li-O-2 batteries. This approach for electrolyte design is presented here for the first time, and it can be extended to other organic systems to provide a platform for the design of advanced electrolyte systems.									167	8	0	0	9	0	168			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000347534800012

In particular, the influence of cobalt as well as the metalloids boron and silicon on the activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was studied in 1 M KOH at 298 K using cyclic voltammetric, galvanostatic and polarization techniques. The electrocatalytic activity was evaluated in the view of the overpotential. It was found that cyclic voltammetric techniques can be used to activate the melt-spun Fe-alloys strongly. Different cyclic voltammetric activation procedures are discussed and the influence of the sweep rate and the potential window on the HER activity was elucidated. The experimental data indicate that the addition of metalloids and, most importantly, of cobalt improves the HER activity of the materials. Thus, the overpotential can be reduced by 200 mV compared to polycrystalline Ni. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-delta (LSFCr-3) was studied in a 3-electrode half-cell configuration in air, pure CO2 and in a 1 : 1 CO2 : CO mixture, over a temperature range of 650-800 degrees C. A detailed analysis of the impedance (EIS) data, under both open circuit and polarized conditions, as well as the cyclic voltammetry response of LSFCr-3 has shown that it is very active in all of these environments, but with oxygen evolution being somewhat more facile that oxygen reduction, and CO2 reduction more active than CO oxidation. Evidence for a chemical capacitance, associated with the Fe3+/4+ redox process in LSFCr-3, was also obtained from the EIS and CV data in all gas environments.									36	3	0	0	0	0	39			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000364153200008	26222620

Designing high-activity and low-cost electrocatalysts for the production of high concentration FDCA is an urgent and challenging task. Here, a cactus-like NiCoP nanoplate was prepared as a robust electrocatalyst to enable 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation to FDCA at high concentration. In situ Raman spectroelectrochemical analysis investigated the dynamic structural evolution of the NiCoP surface during the electrooxidation of HMF. The substituted Co atoms make the NiOOH active species easier to form on the NiCoP surface than Ni2P at low constant voltage, which promotes the oxidation of HMF into FDCA. The total potential of coupling the cathodic H-2 reduction reaction with the anodic HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR) is only 1.464 V when NiCoP is the electrode material. The design of the flow-through mode reactor optimized the mass transfer process in the reaction, and further improved the coupling efficiency. The conversion rate of HMF and yield of FDCA reach 98.7% and 98.8%, respectively, even when the concentration of HMF is as high as 300 mM.									12	1	0	0	2	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000686254400001

Herein, the synthesis of yolk-shell-structured binary transition metal phosphide CoxFe1-xP with different Co/Fe ratios by phosphidation of a cobalt ferrite precursor is reported. The as-synthesized CoxFe1-xP catalysts were used for the OER. All yolk-shell CoxFe1-xP catalysts with different Co/Fe ratios showed much better performance than the corresponding solid catalyst. The formation of Co oxides on the catalyst surface during OER and the optimal Co/Fe ratio were found to be critical to their activity. Among the as-prepared CoxFe1-xP catalysts, that with a Co/Fe ratio of 0.47/0.53 (Co0.47Fe0.53P) exhibited the best performance. Co0.47Fe0.53P has an overpotential of 277 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 37 mV dec(-1), and superior stability in alkaline medium. The outstanding performance is partly ascribed to the transfer of valence electrons from Co to P and Fe. The Co0.47Fe0.53P matrix with excellent conductivity and Fe phosphate that is stable on the surface of the catalyst are also helpful for the OER performance. In addition, the yolk-shell structure of Co0.47Fe0.53P increases the contact area between electrolyte and catalyst. These characteristics of Co0.47Fe0.53P greatly improve its OER performance. This optimized binary transition metal phosphide provides a new approach for the design of nonprecious-metal electrocatalysts.									43	2	0	0	1	0	44			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000484855200001	31381812

PCC 6803								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				272	28			17821	17826		10.1074/jbc.272.28.17821				JUL 11 1997	1997	The gene encoding the 1a-kDa extrinsic protein of photosystem II from Synechocystis sp, PCC 6803 was cloned based on N-terminal sequence of the mature protein, This gene, named psbU, encodes a polypeptide of 131 residues, the first 36 residues of which were absent in the mature protein and thus served as a transit peptide required for its transport into the thylakoid lumen, A psbU gene deletion mutant grew photoautotrophically in normal BG11 medium at almost the same rate as that of the wild type strain, This mutant, however, grew apparently slower than the wild type did upon depletion of Ca2+ or Cl- from the growth medium, Photosystem II oxygen evolution decreased to 81% in the mutant as compared with that in the wild type, and the thermoluminescence B- and Q-bands shifted to higher temperatures accompanied by an increase in the Q-band intensity, These results indicate that the 12-kDa protein is not essential for oxygen evolution but may play a role in optimizing the ion (Ca2+ and Cl-) environment and maintaining a functional structure of the cyanobacterial oxygen-evolving complex, In addition, a double deletion mutant lacking cytochrome c-550 and the 1a-kDa protein grew photoautotrophically with a phenotype identical to that of the single deletion mutant of cytochrome c-550, This supports our previous biochemical results that the 1a-kDa protein cannot bind to photosystem II in the absence of cytochrome c-550 (Shen, J.-R., and Inoue, Y.

Experimental and kinetic model for light-off tests in excess of O-2								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				222	2			499	510		10.1016/j.jcat.2003.11.019				MAR 10 2004	2004	This article is the final part of a study on the CO/O reaction over a 2.9% Pt/Al2O3 in line with the microkinetic approach of the heterogeneous gas-solid catalysis. Mainly, the kinetic parameters of each elementary step of two kinetic models (Models M1 and M2) determined previously are used to explain the evolution of the coverage of the adsorbed CO intermediate species (a strongly adsorbed linear CO species on Pt-0, denoted by L) as well as the turnover frequency (TOF in s(-1)) during light-off tests (increase in the reaction temperature T-r) using 1% CO/x% O-2/He gas mixtures with x less than or equal to 50. Model M1 involves a L-H elementary step between L CO species and a weakly adsorbed oxygen species (O-wads). It is operative (a) whatever T-r in excess CO and (b) only at low T-r values in excess O-2. Model M2 involves a L-H elementary step between a L CO and a strongly adsorbed oxygen species: O-sads is operative at high T-r values in excess O-2. It is shown that the switch for M1 to M2, at the ignition process, during the heating stage occurs for a high CO conversion (> 60%) at a specific T-r value (denoted by T-i) depending on the oxygen partial pressure. Similar to the observations on Pt single crystals, it is shown that the ignition process is associated with a surface-phase transformation from a Pt surface mainly covered by L CO species (denoted by Pt-CO) to a Pt surface mainly covered by O-sads (denoted by Pt-O). The Pt-CO --> Pt-O transformation is due to an oxidative removal of the adsorbed L CO species into CO2 and not to a competitive chemisorption. The high CO conversion associated with the Pt-CO --> Pt-O transformation indicates that mass-transfer processes contribute to the ignition process. During a cooling stage from T-r > T-i, the switch from M2 to M1 (extinction process) is associated with the surface-phase transformation Pt-O --> Pt-CO at a reaction temperature T-e < T-i.

Here, we report an advanced composite catalyst based on 3D ordered macro-/mesoporous TiO2 embedded with Co3O4 nanoparticles (Co3O4@3DOM-TiO2) by in situ embedding Co3O4 nanoparticles Co(3)O(4)NPs) in TiO 2 framework. The asprepared Co3O4@3DOM-TiO2 possesses hierarchically porous structure combined with interconnected macropores and mesopores on TiO2 skeleton, ultrafine Co3O4 NPs embedded in TiO2 walls, and high BET surface area (83.2 m(2) g(-1)). The Co3O4@3DOM-TiO2 oxygen electrode delivers a higher full discharge specific capacity of 7635.9 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), better rate capability and cycling durability (288 cycles at 200 mA g(-1)) compared with bare Co(3)O(4 )NPs and Co(3)O(4 )NPs supported on 3DOM-TiO2 (Co3O4/3DOM-TiO2). Such excellent catalytic performances are mainly due to the synergistic effects among the various components in Co3O4@3-DOM-TiO2, including 3D ordered macropores that is in favor of rapid diffusion for reactants and ions, uniformly dispersed Co3O4 NPs providing rich active sites, and mesopores that further facilitates the accessible of reactant to active sites. Furthermore, TiO2 skeleton with Co3O4 NPs embedded in can facilitate the cycling stability because the embedded Co3O4 NPs are not easy to fall off from the TiO2 framework to cause capacity loss.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1387-1811	1873-3093		WOS:000618632300002

In the present study, the temperatures of reaction intermediates for carbon material syntheses in SP with graphite electrodes were elucidated by time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy. By comparing the emission bandshapes from C-2 and CH radicals with the simulated ones, the temporally averaged temperatures of the radicals were successfully estimated as 3,000 to 6,000 K. From the temporal evolution of the radical temperature, the temperature was almost kept in the range between 2,500 and 4,000 K, except for sudden elevations to more than 7,000 K with durations of less than 0.1 mu s. The temperatures were observed to be markedly lower than those in arc discharge plasma, which is conventionally applied to carbon nanomaterial syntheses. It is suggested that SP should provide a reaction field in which the sp(2) bonds between carbon atoms in the product nanomaterials are less dissociated than the arc discharge plasma.

The effect of different conditions and solid particles on the binding, appearance and deposition rate of the composite was researched. The optimum conditions for electrode preparations were obtained as follows: the current density 1.5 A/dm(2), electroplating time 2 h, temperature 40 degrees C, Co3O4 30 g/L and CeO2 15 g/L. On this condition, the alpha-PbO2-5.43wt% Co3O4-4.64wt%CeO2 composite coating can be obtained. SEM and linear sweep voltammeter were used for the analysis of the surface structure and oxygen evolution potential. The results showed that the doping particles can not only improve electrode surface area but also reduce the granularity of pellet. The alpha-PbO2-5.43wt%Co3O4-4.64wt%CeO2 electrode has a lower oxygen evolution potential and higher electrocatalytic activity than pure alpha-PbO2 electrode.

Using first-principles calculations, we construct cathode electrochemical interface catalytic model to simulate the structural evolution during discharging and charging processes, and the calculated ORR, OER and TOT overpotentials are used to quantitatively assess the catalytic activity of Ti3C2 MXene with and without O, F and OH functional groups. Interestingly, we find that the catalytic activity follows such a trend: Ti3C2O2 > Ti3C2F2 > Ti3C2(OH)(2)> Ti3C2, which suggests that O-terminated Ti3C2 MXene has great advantages and potentiality for catalyzing ORR and OER in Li-O-2 batteries. This is caused by Ti3C2O2 surface shows stronger oxidation capability toward O(2)(2-& nbsp;)compared to Ti3C2F2, Ti3C2(OH)(2) and Ti3C2.

We begin with a concise formulation of dissociation equilibrium at surfaces and then derive the kinetic equations for adsorption, desorption, and dissociation. For the explicit calculations we employ a lattice gas model for homonuclear molecules with both atoms and molecules present on the surface. Lateral interactions between all species are accounted for. In a series of model calculations we discuss equilibrium properties, such as heats of adsorption, and examine the role of dissociation dis-equilibrium on the time evolution of an adsorbate during temperature programmed desorption.

By dipcoating the aerophilic perfluorochemical compounds (PFC) and amphiphilic ionomers into the self-supported electrodes, (1) the high solubility of O-2 in the PFC nanoemulsions greatly increases triple-phase boundaries and facilitates the efficient supply/removal of O-2 from the electrolyte; (2) the ionomers with hydrophobic and hydrophilic functionalities enable fast gas, water, and ion transport to the triple-phase boundaries; and (3) the self-supported electrode without binder ensures fast electron transfer while the firm integration prevents catalyst shedding. By applying this strategy, the ZABs show a high power density of 115 mW cm(-2) and a narrow discharge/charge gap of 0.64 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a long-cycling durability (over 1000 h). This work provides a universal approach to promote gas-evolving reactions for electrochemical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000809984700001	35587778

Herein, we report a novel excellent porous molybdenum tungsten phosphide (Mo-W-P) hybrid nanosheet catalyst for hydrogen evolution, which is synthesized via in situ phosphidation of molybdenum tungsten oxide (Mo-W-O) hybrid nanowires grown on carbon cloth. The three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical hybrid electrocatalyst exhibits impressively high electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 138 mV required to achieve a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4, which are significantly higher than those of single MoP nanosheets and WP2 nanorods. Such an outstanding performance of the Mo-W-P hybrid electrocatalyst is attributed to the 3D conductive scaffolds, porous nanosheet structure, and strong synergistic effect of W and Mo atoms in Mo-W-P, making it a very promising catalyst for hydrogen production. Our findings demonstrate that careful control over the morphology and composition of the electrocatalyst can achieve highly efficient hybrid electrocatalysts.									352	14	0	0	13	0	354			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000374351200031

Here we report the construction of novel crystalline PtPd @ amorphous NiB core-shell heterostructures (c-PtPd@a-NiB CSHs) with crystalline PtPd mesoporous truncated octahedral nanocages (c-PtPd MTONs) as the cores and amorphous NiB (a-NiB) nanosheets as the shells via a three-step strategy. This hybridization, between c-PtPd MTONs and a-NiB nanosheets, leads to increased catalytically active sites, a modulated surface electronic structure, and enhanced hydrophilic properties. With these properties, the as-obtained c-PtPd@a-NiB CSHs exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline medium, with a small required overpotential of 31 mV (@-10 mA cm(-2)), a low Tafel slope of 40.9 mV dec(-1), and excellent long-term catalytic durability.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536095500010

The performance of the liquid antimony anode was tested under "battery mode", with the anode chamber shielded in argon throughout the test and the cathode exposed to air. Polarization curves were taken and a long term constant potential discharging test was carried out afterwards. Taking electrochemical reaction, mass transport and microstructure of the liquid Sb anode into consideration, a one dimensional mathematical model was built and then validated by the polarization curve and the constant potential discharging performance curve obtained during the test. This model analyzes the metallic Sb distribution in the anode during cell operation, explains the cell performance evolution base on the microstructural development of the liquid Sb anode and simulates how the anode microstructure affects the cell performance.

In this work, sulfur vacancies in cobalt sulfide (CoS) nanoflowers are created by Ar-plasma for NRR catalysis. In comparison with untreated CoS, a boosted NRR catalytic activity with Faradaic efficiency of 16.5 ? 1.5% and ammonia yield rate of 12.1 ? 1.4 ?gNH3 h-1 mgcat - 1 is achieved for CoS1-x electrocatalyst at a low applied potential of -0.15 V vs. RHE in acidic media. The superior NRR catalytic activity of CoS1-x is also confirmed by NMR test. The robust NRR performance is related to the sulfur vacancies in ultrathin CoS nanoflowers effectively suppressing HER catalysis due to the selective chemisorption of N2 molecules on low coordinated Co atoms resulting in higher favorability for nitrogen adsorption since the created Lewis acid sites are more preferable to form stable Co-N bond; moreover, a lower Gibbs free energy for the initial hydrogenation of nitrogen molecules, limiting step of NRR, is required for CoS1-x electrocatalyst because more Co sites with low coordination are created and the adjacent two Co sites are involved for the splitting of N2 molecules synergistically; thereby, an exceptional NRR performance is achieved for CoS1-x electrocatalyst.									26	1	0	0	3	0	26			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000643726600005

Searching for novel electrocatalysts with low onset potential, high selectivity and excellent stability is still one of the most attractive and challenging topics. Here, based on the conductor-like screening model and first-principles calculations, we systematically investigated nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) pathways occurring on iron-based phosphide monolayers. It can be found that Mo-doped Fe2P and Fe3P monolayers can efficiently promote the NRR with onset potentials of -0.30 V and -0.17 V, respectively, especially for the Mo-doped Fe3P monolayer, which has the lowest onset potential to date. Electronic analysis shows that the Mo atom doping can significantly enhance the degree of matching between the d-orbitals of transition metal atoms and the p-orbitals of the N-2 molecule, contributing to the activation of dinitrogen. Furthermore, Mo and Fe atoms provide bimetallic active sites, helping to avoid the linear relationship during the NRR pathway. Besides, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is suppressed because of larger onset potentials and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed to identify the high stabilities of the Mo-doped monolayers. This work offers useful insights into the design of high-performance electrocatalysts for the NRR and provides guidance for future experimental and theoretical investigations.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000624503000017

Herein, we developed polyaniline (PANI) coated nickel-cobalt metal phosphides nanowire arrays grown on nickel foam (NiCoP@PANI) as hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalysts. The appearance of PANI with excellent electric conductivity can accelerate H(+)in electrolyte transfer into H(2)and offer a masking layer to restrain the damage of electrode structural. Besides, the 3D porous structural of nickel foam can act as a skeleton to avoid electrode structure collapse and a channel for electron transfer. The optimized NiCoP@PANI can drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at low overpotential of 80.6 mV in 1 M KOH solution, and satisfactory electrochemical stability with unbroken structure and unchanged composition after electrochemical test.									10	0	0	0	1	0	9			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000561424100001	32693392

Aiming for, discovering potential electrocatalysts with superior activity, stability and selectivity, a series of 3 d transition metal dimers were studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The investigation reveals that most of the metal dimers have admirable stability, and partial density of states (PDOS) confirms that the unoccupied and occupied d orbitals of metal atoms are the key for effective activation of N-2. Especially, two metal dimers bonded to nitrogen-doped graphene, FeFe and CoCo, can selectively adsorb and activate N-2 for efficient conversion. Their limiting potentials are -0.44 and -0.45 V, which are superior than to most of the catalysts and they can well suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Moreover, the desorption free energy of NH3 is 0.54 and 0.57 eV respectively for FeFe and CoCo, guarantees the good durability of the catalysts. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The pyrolysis behavior and structural evolution of the precursor were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry, and thermal gravimetric analysis (DSC TG). The microstructure and composition of the pyrolysis products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), laser Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and element analysis. The results indicate that the obtained precursor for the ultra-fine ZrC could be a Zr O C chain polymer with phenol and acetylacetone as ligands. The pyrolysis products of the precursor mainly consist of intimately mixed amorphous carbon and tetragonal ZrO2 (tZrO(2)) in the temperature range of 300-1200 degrees C. When the pyrolysis temperature rises up to 1300 degrees C, the precursor starts to transform gradually into ZrC, accompanied by the formation of monoclinic ZrO2 (m-ZrO2). The carbothermal reduction reaction between ZrO2 and carbon has been substantially completed at a relatively low temperature (1500 degrees C). The obtained ultra-fine ZrC powders exhibit as well-distributed near-spherical grains with sizes ranging from 50 to 100 nm. The amount of oxygen in the ZrC powders could be further reduced by increasing the pyrolysis temperature from 1500 to 1600 degrees C but unfortunately the obvious agglomeration of the ZrC grains will be induced.

Hence, here, high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts were developed for both the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via the in situ vertical growth of thorny leaf-like (2D nanosheets supporting 1D nanowires) NiCoP on a carbon cloth (NiCoP/CC). After integrating the advantages of the synergistic effect between Ni and Co as well as the unique hierarchical structure combined with 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets and a 3D conductive carbon cloth substrate, the electrode exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity toward HER and UOR. The electrolytic cell assembled using NiCoP/CC as the anode and the cathode could provide current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.42 V (160 mV less than that for its urea-free counterpart) as well as remarkable durability over 30 h. Thus, the cost-effectiveness and high activity of the NiCoP/CC electrode pave the way to explore transition metal-based electrocatalysts for urea electrolysis.									100	2	0	0	7	0	100			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000465152700039

Traditional MoS2 has electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution inertness in alkaline environment, which is detrimental to the adsorption and dissociation of water. Composited with electrocatalyst with good electrical conductivity can enhance its HER activity. In this work, we for the first time construct a carbon-supported hollow heterostructure MoS2@Mo2C composite via two-step calcination and sulfurized process from carbonized Mo2C-Mo3C2 heteronanowires. The results show that the existence of the Mo3C2 phase is the key point to construct the effective heterostructure with hollow morphology. Due to the strong negative hydrogen binding energy for H on surface of Mo2C, the H+ reduction in the MoS2@Mo2C in the Volmer step can be enhanced. Compared with MoS2, MoS2@Mo2C has high electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution with an onset potential of 28 mV, overpotential of 129 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 78 mV dec(-1), and an excellent stability. This work will provide new insights into the design of high-efficiency HER catalysts via interfacial engineering at nanoscale for commercial water splitting.									89	3	0	0	3	0	88			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000565112000005

In particular, M-V-O compounds (M is a transition metal or main group element) with VO4 structural motifs were predicted to show a remarkably wide range of band energetics (>3 eV variation in the energy of valence band maximum) and characteristics, depending on the M and crystal structure, which is beyond the extent of electronic structured tuning observed in previously studied families of metal oxide photoanodes. While this finding guided experimental discovery of new photoanode materials, explicit experimental verification of the theoretical prediction of the tunable electronic structure of these materials has been lacking to date. In this study, we use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Kelvin probe microscopy to experimentally investigate the electronic structure of M-V-O photoanodes, enabling comparison to theory on a common absolute energy scale. The results confirm the prediction that band edge energies of ternary vanadates vary significantly with metal cations. The valence band variation of approximately 1 eV observed here is larger than that reported in any analogous class of metal oxide semiconductors and demonstrates the promise of tuning the metal oxide electronic structure to enable efficient photoelectrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction and beyond. Because midgap states can hamper realization of the high photovoltage sought by band edge tuning, we analyze the electronic contributions of oxygen vacancies for the representative photoanode V4Cr2O13 to guide future research on the development of high-efficiency metal oxide photoanodes for solar fuel technology.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000703532600009

Urea was not only employed as the nitrogen source, but also offered more reductive radicals in the gamma system. The uniform dispersion and homogeneous size distribution of PtNPs are obtained on reduced graphene oxide (rGO), which is attributed to the synergy of restriction effects of GO and crush capacity of high energy gamma rays. In addition, the method simultaneously offers PtNPs with polygonal angle structure and doping nitrogen in rGO, thus provides more surface and corner defects on PtNPs and heteroatomic defects on rGO, which synergistically improve the ORR performance of the samples. The obtained polygonal angle PtNPs modified NrGO exhibit fantabulous ORR activity in alkaline media with enhanced onset potential (906 mV), half-wave potential (783 mV) and superior limit current density (6.74 mA.cm(-2)) compared to the commercial Pt/C and those PtNPs supported on rGO composites. The results indicate that gamma irradiation assisted with in situ hydrolysis of urea can be a promising candidate method for preparation of high performance Pt-based catalysts in practical application.

We then use this assay to show that the lineshapes of the D+ and Z+ tyrosine radicals are identical in this preparation, as has been observed in photosystem II complexes from a wide variety of photosynthetic species.

The MIT transition of VO2 and the functionality of VO2 based devices can be controlled by a variety of chemical and physical stimuli. With these external stimuli, defects, such as oxygen vacancies, are often inevitably introduced. However, due to the V-O system-induced challenge to synthesize stable VO2 with different oxygen vacancy concentrations, the impact of oxygen vacancies on the resistance and transition of the VO2 is not fully understood. Oxygen vacancy, as one of the typical defects in VO2, is expected to concentrate at grain boundaries, and hence a concentration gradient of oxygen vacancies may exist between the grains interior and the boundaries, and this suggests a possibility to study the effects of oxygen vacancies on the transition of VO2 by probing local phenomena at the grain boundaries. For investigating local phenomena at the grain boundaries, Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) techniques are effective, which allows probing the structure and various properties at the nanoscale. In this work, a series of SPM techniques, including Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), conductive-AFM (c-AFM), Electrochemical Strain Microscopy (ESM), and Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM), are employed to measure variations of the surface structure, the resistance, the oxygen vacancy concentration, and the work function between the grain interior and the grain boundary. It has been demonstrated that, for most cases, both the resistance and the work function are lower at the grain boundaries as a result of the accumulation of oxygen vacancies at those positions. In addition, the resistance change induced by the electric field has been observed in the deposited VO2 thin films, which may be associated with the generation/annihilation of the oxygen vacancies, rather than charge injection. This work has demonstrated the effects of oxygen vacancies in the transition of VO2 by probing the local phenomena at grain boundaries, also provided a new insight into the resistance change of VO2 under an electric field.

J	JURSINIC, PA; STEMLER, A								HIGH-RATES OF PHOTOSYSTEM-II ELECTRON FLOW OCCUR IN MAIZE THYLAKOIDS WHEN THE HIGH-AFFINITY BINDING-SITE FOR BICARBONATE IS EMPTY OF ALL MONOVALENT ANIONS OR HAS BICARBONATE BOUND								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA				1098	3			359	367		10.1016/S0005-2728(09)91018-0				JAN 22 1992	1992	Monovalent anions, such as formate and particularly bicarbonate, can control the rate of electron flow between Photosystem I and II. There are two explanations for this effect that differ in the residency state of a high-affinity binding site for bicarbonate when normal (rapid) electron flow occurs. One explanation, the 'bound-bicarbonate' hypothesis, requires that the site be filled with bicarbonate for high rates of electron flow. A second explanation, the 'inhibitory-anion' hypothesis, requires that the site either be filled with bicarbonate or be entirely free of any inhibitory monovalent anion. Electron flow in maize thylakoids was monitored by rates of oxygen evolution with dichlorobenzoquinone as an electron acceptor. The amount of bicarbonate bound to the high-affinity site in maize thylakoids was determined by measuring, the amount of bicarbonate displaced by injection of formate. The following results were obtained. Thylakoids with high-affinity binding sites devoid of bicarbonate and other monovalent anions have high rates of electron flow. The dissocation constant for bicarbonate at the high-affinity site is 40 +/- 11-mu-M; there are 2.4 +/- 0.6 bicarbonate bound and 1.8 +/- 0.3 atrazine bound per Photosystem II reaction center active in charge separation; in maize thylakoids 94% of separated charge in Photosystem II is used in oxygen evolution. Uncharacterized respiratory processes occur in spinach and pea thylakoid preparations. It is concluded that the inhibitory-anion hypothesis is correct. Also, bicarbonate might be present for high rates of electron flow in vivo, in which case it binds to its high-affinity site and excludes other monovalent anions that are inhibitory.									19	0	0	0	17	0	19			0006-3002			WOS:A1992HD18800005

The fabrication of self-supported Cu2S-Cu3P nanowire (Cu2S-Cu3P NW) arrays on a commercial copper foam by a liquid-solid reaction and subsequent phosphatation at low temperature is reported. The corresponding scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results indicate that the Cu2S-Cu3P NW arrays have a dense nanowire (NW) structure with sulfur and phosphorous uniformly distributed on the surface of the nanowires. Interestingly, the Cu2S-Cu3P NW arrays act as a hydrogen-evolving cathode that when operated in 1.0 m KOH electrolyte only require a low overpotential of 158 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and show a small Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1). The activity decrease is negligible after holding at -500 mA cm(-2) for 75 h, which thus demonstrates excellent stability. This could be due to the structure of nanowire arrays and synergistic effects between S and P, which could increase the specific surface area, reduce the charge transfer resistance, facilitate mass diffusion and electron transfers, and increase the active sites. This work therefore provides a simple method to prepare low-cost and self-supported electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000466486200020

A two-step hydrothermal synthesis was used to synthesize TiO2 nanomaterials modified by iodic acid (HIO3) as a dopant. Detailed analysis was conducted to illustrate the intrinsic doping/reaction mechanisms of iodic acid in the modification of the TiO2 matrix. The phase and structure evolution were deduced from X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to analyze the generation of oxygen vacancies and the formation of I-O-Ti bonds in the TiO2 lattice. Multi-valences of iodine, due to the reduction of iodic acid, facilitated the generation of oxygen vacancies and 3d state Ti3+ species in the TiO2 lattice. The visible light absorption and enhanced photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 nanomaterials were attributed to existing oxygen vacancies, iodine multi-valences in I-O-Ti bonds, and 3d state Ti3+ sites in the TiO2 lattice. The photocatalytic degradation efficiency under visible light (lambda > 400 nm) followed a pseudo first-order kinetic model. Rutile nanowires using a two-step synthesis method produced the highest methylene blue (10 mg L-1) degradation rate constant, K-ap, of 7.92 x 10(-3) min(-1) compared to other synthesized nanomaterials. The K-ap value obtained was an order of magnitude greater than commercial P25 (3.87 x 10(-4) min(-1)) and pristine TiO2 nanowires (4.18 x 10(-4) min(-1)). The iodine doped TiO2 photocatalysts can be used in TiO2/light irradiation advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in water treatment using sunlight or a visible light source, rather than an ultraviolet irradiation source.									169	3	0	0	17	0	170			2046-2069			WOS:000341454000005

Considering that CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) occurs on the interface of the cathode in artificial photosynthesis, selectivity and faradaic efficiency depend on the performance of the cathode itself. Herein, we report a Nafion-coated TiO2 dark cathode to produce alcohol as a selective liquid product from CO2RR. The mechanism for selective alcohol production is investigated by in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure and in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy measurement for the intermediate CO2 radical detection. The Nafion functional layer on the TiO2 dark electrode suppresses the dimerization of monocarbon radical intermediates due to the efficient one-pot reactions of proton-coupled multiple electron transfer. As a result, the dimerization of monocarbon radical intermediates is suppressed due to decreased lifetime of the intermediate, facilitating the exclusive methanol production.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2380-8195			WOS:000475827900008

It was found that an oxidation reaction, that generated carbonyl (C=O) groups could occur at 160 degrees C which has not been reported in the literature. It is proposed that the cyclized structures in the PAN macromolecule chains are a prerequisite for the oxidation. Further investigations indicate that with more cyclized structures in the PAN macromolecule chains, the oxidation proceeds more readily, which is consistent with the proposed mechanism. The kinetic parameters for the oxidation and cyclization reactions were estimated using the Kissinger method. The activation energies for the reactions of oxidation and cyclization for PAN fibers are about 96.4 kJ/mol and 190.0 kJ/mol, respectively, which implies that the cyclization is the rate determining step during the thermal stabilization of PAN fibers.

In this study, octahedral Cu-rich PtCu alloy is seeded to fabricate near-surface composition-tunable PtCu hollow octahedral nanoparticles (HONs) with the wall thickness of similar to 2.1 nm. Due to both the alloying effects of near surface and the special hollow octahedral structure, the PtCu/C HONs exhibit significantly higher MA and durability than commercial Pt/C towards both ORR in alkaline medium and MOR in sulfuric acid electrolyte. The ORR MA of Pt44.1Cu55.9/C HONs are up to 2.60 A mg(Pt)(-1) that is 18.5-fold enhancement compared with that of Pt/C. Besides, after 10,000 voltage cycles, the MA of Pt44.1Cu55.9/C HONs remains to be 1.61 A mg(Pt)(-1), a datum 53.7 times that of Pt/C. The in situ CO polarization curves exhibit that the Pt44.1CU55.9 HONs/C own high resistance to CO poisoning. For MOR in sulfuric acid electrolyte, the optimum SA/MA of PtCu/C HONs is 5.33 mA cm(-2)/1.94 A mg(Pt)(-1), which is 10.25/5.87 times higher than that of Pt/C. This study provides effective bifunctional cathode and anode electrocatalysts for both PEMFCs and DMFCs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The optimal condition of sulfur removal is under 5. 5%O_2-N_ atmosphere at 700℃ , sulfur removal can reach about 70%. Compared with char yields under inert atmosphere,the one decreases a little. However, with the increasing of oxygen content, sulfur removal increases,while the char yields decrease much,and decreasing ratio of char yield is higher than the increasing ratio of sulfur removal. In this study, PY-MS was also used to study the sulfur transformation during pyrolysis,the evolution trends of SO_2 and CO_2 are almost the same before 500℃ under 1% O_2-He atmosphere, which suggests that oxygen selectively breaks the bonds of C-S of unstable sulfur compounds in the coal at lower temperature, and at this time the bonds of C-C are not influenced, as the intensity of CO is also very low. With the temperature increasing, CO starts to evolve, which makes the trends of SO_2 and CO_2 change a little, at last the peaks of these gases reach maximum at the same temperature. This suggests that with the temperature increasing, when oxygen breaks the bonds of C-S in the stable sulfur compounds,most bonds of C-C are also broken. Most bonds of C-C take part in reaction with the oxygen,which make the oxygen not enough to oxide the C to CO_2 ,so most of C are transferred to CO.			利用流化床反应系统对霍州原煤在氧气浓度(体积分数)分别为2.5%,5.5%和8.5%O_2-N_2混合气,热解温度分别为400℃,500℃,600℃,700℃和800℃,热解停留时间为20min的条件下进行了热解预脱硫的研究.结果表明,在氧气浓度为5.5%,热解温度为700℃时的脱硫效果最佳,脱硫率可达70%以上.而且,与惰性气氛下热解相比,半焦产率没有明显降低.当继续加大氧气浓度或升高热解温度时,虽然脱硫率有所增加,但是半焦产率却大大降低,且半焦产率的降幅要大于脱硫率的升幅.通过热解质谱(PY-MS)实验表明,在1%O_2-He气氛下,SO_2和CO_2在500℃以前的逸出趋势基本相同,这说明氧气在低温时对不稳定有机硫中的C-S键能够选择性断裂,此时煤中的C-C键不受影响;随后CO也开始逸出,使得它们的逸出趋势稍微发生了变化,最后这三个峰基本在同时达到了最大,这是由于随着温度的升高,C-S键被氧气选择性断裂的同时,C-C键也大量参与到了反应中来,使氧气由原来的过量变得相对不足,从而使得部分碳转化为CO.						3	1	0	0	0	0	4			1004-4248			CSCD:2786446

In situ analysis of furnace exhaust gasses enabled quantitative exploration of thermolysis and crystallization reactions and an ability to identify processing parameters that influence the temperature ranges over which they occur. The atmospheric analysis was instrumental in identifying heat treatments that produced optimally consolidated precursor gels that crystallized into BaTiO(3) layers with optimized structure and properties. Slow ramp rates resulted in higher porosity, larger grain size, and a dramatic drop in the capacitor yield. Fast ramp rates produced similar trends; however, the mechanisms were distinct. The effects of oxygen partial pressure were also explored. BaTiO(3) grain size increased with increasing pO(2), whereas there was no appreciable influence on density and capacitor yield. Optimal firing parameters, i.e., 20 degrees C/min ramp rate at a pO(2) Of 10(-13) atm, were identified as those that produced an overlap in the temperature ranges of thermolysis and crystallization reactions and thus a precursor gel with a density and compliance that supports crystallization and densification while tolerating the associated volume contraction. This in situ approach to analyze downstream furnace gas is shown to be a generically applicable means to understand synthesis methods that are complicated by simultaneous mechanisms of precursor decomposition, extraction of volatile components, and crystallization.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0884-2914			WOS:000275221100003

So far, most of the FTIR studies of the reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis have been performed using isolated photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) preparations, which, however, could be modified during isolation procedures. In this study, we developed a methodology to evaluate the photosynthetic activities of thylakoids using FTIR spectroscopy. FTIR difference spectra upon successive flashes using thylakoids from spinach exhibited signals typical of the S-state cycle at the Mn4CaO5 cluster and Q(B) reactions in PSII with period-four and -two oscillations, respectively. Similar measurement in the presence of an artificial quinone as an exogenous electron acceptor showed features specific to the S-state cycle. Simulations of the oscillation patterns provided the quantum efficiencies of the S-state cycle and electron transfer in PSII. Moreover, FTIR measurement under continuous illumination on thylakoids in the presence of DCMU showed signals due to QA reduction and P700 oxidation simultaneously. From the relative amplitudes of marker bands of QA(-) and P700(+), the molar ratio of photoactive PSII and PSI centers in thylakoids was estimated. FTIR analyses of the photo-reactions in thylakoids, which are more intact than isolated photosystems, will be useful in investigations of the photosynthetic mechanism especially by genetic modification of photosystem proteins.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0005-2728	1879-2650		WOS:000424308800008	29174010

The onset of nitrogen fixation is preceded by a depression in photosynthesis that establishes a sufficiently low level of dissolved oxygen in the growth medium. A several-fold reduction in the level of transcripts coding for phycocyanin (cpcBA) and the chlorophyll a binding protein of photosystem II (psbC) and psbA accompanied the depression in photosynthetic oxygen evolution. Unlike most of the other organisms examined to date, in P. boryanum, psbC and psbD do not appear to be co-transcribed. The psbC transcripts were down-regulated several fold, while the psbD transcript declined marginally during the nitrogen fixation phase. A decrease in dissolved oxygen and a dramatic increase in the level of nifH transcripts and the enzyme activity of nitrogenase were characteristic of the nitrogen fixation phase.

In particular, the latter is the result of an interplay between different degradation mechanisms. The essential high stability, demanded for real applications, requires the synthesis of advanced electrocatalysts that withstand the harsh operation conditions. In the first part of this study, the synthesis of oxygen reduction electrocatalysts consisting of Pt-Co (i.e., Pt5Co, Pt3Co, and PtCo) alloyed nanoparticles encapsulated in the mesoporous shell of hollow graphitic spheres (HGS) is reported. The mass activities of the activated catalysts depend on the initial alloy composition and an activity increase on the order of two to threefold, compared to pure Pt@HGS, is achieved. The key point of the second part is the investigation of the degradation of PtCo@HGS (showing the highest activity). Thanks to pore confinement, the impact of dissolution/dealloying and carbon corrosion can be studied without the interplay of other degradation mechanisms that would induce a substantial change in the particle size distribution. Therefore, impact of the upper potential limit and the scan rates on the dealloying and electrochemical surface area evolution can be examined in detail.									36	6	0	0	0	0	37			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000413695300016

The cathodic photocurrent and Mott-Schottky analysis indicate that the tetragonal zircon BiVO4 is a p-type semiconductor. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectrum showed that there are Bi vacancies and interstitial oxygen exist in the crystal, which are the origin of the p-type conductivity. The flat band potential of the P-BiVO4 is about 1.33 V (vs Ag/AgCl) inferred from Mott-Schottky plots. Combining with diffuse reflection spectrum and valence band X-ray photoelectron spectrum, the calculated conduction band value of the P-BiVO4 is about 0.06 V vs RHE, slightly higher than the reduction potential of hydrogen. However, the P-BiVO4 exhibit hydrogen production activity under Xe light irradiation even though its conduction band level is not negative enough. This can be attributed to the hot carrier processes in p-type semiconductors.									59	6	0	0	6	0	60			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000468014400010

The formation of an oxygen-oxygen bond is crucial in the water oxidation process. Here, we report the formation of the oxygen-oxygen bond by the N5-coordinate oxoiron species with a higher oxidation state of Fe-IV and Fe-V. This bond formation is studied through the nucleophilic addition of water molecules and the transfer of the oxygen atom from meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA). Our study reveals that the oxygen-oxygen bond formation by reacting mCPBA with Fe-V=O requires less activation barrier (13.7 kcal mol(-1)) than the other three pathways. This bond formation by the oxygen atom transfer (OAT) pathway is more favorable than that achieved by the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) pathway. In both cases, the oxygen-oxygen bond formation occurs by interacting the sigma*d(z2)-2p(z) molecular orbital of the iron-oxo intermediate with the 2p(x) orbital of the oxygen atom. From this study, we understand that the oxygen-oxygen bond formation by Fe-IV=O with the OAT process is also feasible (16 kcal mol(-1)), suggesting that Fe-V=O may not always be required for the water oxidation process by non-heme N5-oxoiron. After the oxygen-oxygen bond formation, the release of the dioxygen molecule occurs with the addition of the water molecule. The release of dioxygen requires a barrier of 7.0 kcal mol(-1). The oxygen-oxygen bond formation is found to be the rate-determining step.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000829515000001	35876181

As a probe reaction to the surface properties, it gives an insight into the relationship between the structure of active phase and catalytic performance. Noble metals alloyed with certain transition metals in the form of a nanoalloy exhibit enhanced catalytic activity for various reactions, especially when simultaneous activation of oxygen and CO is involved. This article highlights some of these insights into nanoalloy catalysts in which platinum group metal (PGM) is alloyed with a second and/or third transition metal (M/M'=Co, Fe, V, Ni, Ir, etc.), for catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide in a gas phase. Recent studies have provided important insights into how the atomic-scale structures of the nanoalloy catalysts operate synergistically in activating oxygen and maneuvering surface oxygenated species. The exploration of atomic-scale chemical/structural ordering and coordination in correlation with the catalytic oxidation properties based on findings from ex- and in-situ synchrotron X-ray techniques is emphasized; for example, high-energy X-ray diffraction coupled to atomic-pair distribution function and X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopic analysis. The understanding of the detailed active sites of the nanoalloys has significant implications for the design of low-cost, active, and durable catalysts for sustainable energy production and environmental processes.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000347697700004

Herein, a novel hexagonal BN quantum dots (BNQDs) decorated Nb2CTx-MXene (BNQDs@Nb2CTx) is explored as an efficient NRR catalyst. BNQDs@Nb2CTx presents the optimum NRR activity with an NH3 yield rate of 66.3 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) (-0.4 V) and a Faradaic efficiency of 16.7% (-0.3 V), outperforming most of the state-of-the-art NRR catalysts, together with an excellent stability. Theoretical calculations revealed that the synergistic interplay of BNQDs and Nb2CTx enabled the creation of unique interfacial B sites serving as NRR catalytic centers capable of enhancing the N-2 activation, lowering the reaction energy barrier and impeding the H-2 evolution.									47	0	0	0	2	0	47			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000694631100001	34499407

Herein, a simple molecular precursor pyrolysis strategy is proposed to fabricate Co4S3, Co9S8 nanoparticles hosted on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets (Co4S3-Co9S8/C/rGO, CSG) using a GO-supported Co-coordination polymer as a precursor for the first time. The synthetic method has the advantages of simple operation and high repeatability. Well-dispersed Co4S3-Co9S8 nanoparticles and abundant interfaces maximize the amount of catalytically active sites. The synergistic adsorption of the reaction intermediates on the interface between Co4S3 and Co9S8 is propitious to electrochemical behavior. The rGO supports with high conductivity and enriched defects speed up the reaction kinetics and effectively inhibit the aggregation of cobalt sulfides. In an alkaline environment, the optimized CSG showed the lowest overpotential (134 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) among the studied materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction. In terms of Li-ion batteries, the hybrid composite CSG exhibited a remarkable reversible capacity of 814 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.2 A g(-1) after 200 cycles. Thus, the present design and engineering strategy may offer an idea for the preparation of other metal sulfides to boost electrochemical storage property.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000540915300010

We initially observe the formation of a carbon-free surface covered with a complete monolayer of oxygen, based on the binding energies of the Ir 4f and O is core level peaks. During a rather long induction period with nearly constant oxygen coverage, the work function of the surface changes continuously as sensed by the gas phase O is signal. The sudden and rapid formation of the IrO2 rutile phase with a thickness above 3 nm, manifested by distinct binding energy changes and substantiated by quantitative XPS analysis, provides direct evidence that the oxide film is formed via an autocatalytic growth mechanism that was previously proposed for PbO and RuO2.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1948-7185			WOS:000535177500062	32302143

Compared with LSCF-SDC nano-sized composite cathode, the LCCF-SDC composite cathode shows the higher microstructure stability. There is no observable coarsening or sintering and no diffraction peaks of other impurity phase are detected for both LSCF and LCCF after being aged at 600 degrees C for 500 h, but the lattice distortion is less if La3+ ions are substituted by Ca2+ ions instead of by Sr2+ in LaCo0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LCFO) lattice. The oxygen vacancy concentration is also less in LCCF than in LSCF. The less lattice distortion and oxygen vacancy concentration prohibit the Ca2+ ions segregation on the LCCF cathode surface because of less strain in the LCCF lattice and less electrostatic interactions between the negatively charge A-site dopants (Ca'(La)) and the positively charged oxygen vacancies (V-o(..)) on LCCF surface. The greater binding energy of Ca-O maybe also hinder the enrichment of Ca2+ ions on the cathode surface. After being aged in air at 600 degrees C for 500 h, more Sr2+ ions gather on the LSCF cathode surface to form a Sr-rich inert phase, which is detrimental to the oxygen reduction reaction on the cathode surface.

Novel CoFe2O4-x with different vacancy degrees that were successfully developed via hydrogen calcination were characterized using X-ray diffraction analyzer (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), H-2 temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and dynamic light scattering. The activation of catalysts was analyzed using Bisphenol A (BPA) as pollutant, and the main active species generated during the reaction were identified by using N-2 bubbling and scavenger experiments. Possible oxidation degradation pathways of BPA were speculated using gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS) and total organic carbon (TOC) analysis. Findings indicated that the oxygen vacancies promoted electronic transfer and participated in the redox cycle from Co3+/Fe3+ to Co2+/Fe2+ to generate O-1(2) and O-2(-), O-2(-) OH center dot and SO4- generated from oxygen vacancy; moreover, PS activation could further degrade BPA to small molecules, such as benzenes and quinones. Finally, the toxicity of the reaction mixtures was evaluated and found that the acute toxicity to Daphnia magna decreased after 120 min treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The fluorescence yield characteristics of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 cells undergoing photoactivation showed that basal fluorescence, F-0, exhibited a characteristic decline when red, but not blue, measuring light was employed. This result was traced to a progressive increase in the coupling of the phycobilisome (PBS) to the PSII reaction center as determined by observing the changes in room temperature and 77 K fluorescence emission spectra that accompany photo activation. The results support the hypothesis that strong energetic coupling of the PBS to the PSII reaction center depends upon the formation of an active WOC, which presumably diminishes the likelihood of photodamage to reaction centers that have either lost an intact Mn cluster or are in the process of assembling an active WOC.									17	0	0	0	17	0	17			0006-2960			WOS:000259119000005	18717592

Herein, the NRR performances of the VN3 anchored graphene, graphane and fluorographene are systematically investigated via density functional theory calculations. Our results reveal that the VN3 embedded graphene exhibits the superior activity through an enzymatic mechanism with an onset potential of 0.28 V. The graphene hydrogenation significantly depresses the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and remarkably improves the NRR selectivity. Conversely, the graphene fluorination results into the worsening of the NRR selectivity, which rules out VN3 decorated fluorographene as the NRR electrocatalyst. Moreover, the thermodynamic decomposition potentials of the N elements are 0.20 and 0.07 V for the supports of graphene and graphane, respectively, indicating that no stability deterioration is occurred by hydrogenation. The electronic structures analysis uncovers that the substrate is the electron reservoir for the charge transfers meanwhile the VN3 moiety acts as a bridge to link the substrate and adsorbates, which provides the explanation for the influence of the substrate on the NRR performance. The finding provides a rational strategy to design functional carbon-based electrocatalysts.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000523184600115

In the present study the catalytic activities of three ferrospinels AFe(2)O(4) (A = Co, Ni, Cu) were evaluated for high temperature sulfuric acid decomposition reaction. Catalyst characterization by Mossbauer spectroscopy confirmed the occupancy of octahedral and tetrahedral sites by Fe3+ ions in all three inverse spinels. The temperature programmed reduction studies revealed that the reducibility of Fe3+ was greatly enhanced in CuFe2O4 as compared to other ferrites. Copper ferrite was found to be the most active catalyst for the reaction with similar to 78% conversion at 800 degrees C. Presence of sulfate species on the spent catalysts was revealed by an ex situ analysis of the spent catalyst samples by FTIR, SEM and evolved gas analysis (EGA). FTIR spectra of all the three spent catalyst samples exhibit four prominent peaks in the region 950-1200 cm(-1), which is an indicative of C-2v symmetry and bidentate sulfate coordination. A plausible mechanism for the sulfuric acid decomposition over spinel ferrites was proposed via the metal sulfate formation and then decomposition followed with an oxygen evolution step with the sulfate decomposition being the rate determining step at higher temperatures. EGA showed evolution of SO2 as a decomposition product from existed sulfate of spent catalysts at high temperatures, with the rate of SO2 evolution following the order: CuFe2O4 > NiFe2O4 > CoFe2O4. The enhanced rate of decomposition of the sulfates of copper ferrite can be attributed to the higher electronegativity of Cu2+ as compared to Ni2+ and Co2+, which renders the S-O bond in the mixed metal sulfate weaker than others and thus more susceptible to dissociation. The lower thermal stability of sulfate and better reducibility are responsible for the improved catalytic properties of copper ferrite among the three ferrospinels investigated for sulfuric acid decomposition.

For LaMnO3, XANES and XES show that Mn3+ is formed, but Mn4+ ions are retained, which leads to the 4e(-) reduction between 0.85 and 0.6 V. At more negative potentials, down to 0.2 V, EXAFS confirms an increase in oxygen vacancies as evidenced by changes in the Mn-O coordination distance and number, while XES shows that the Mn3+ to Mn4+ ratio increases. For CaMnO3, XANES and XES show the formation of both Mn3+ and Mn2+ as the potential is made more negative, with little retention of Mn4+ at 0.2 V. The EXAFS for CaMnO3 also indicates the formation of oxygen vacancies, but in contrast to LaMnO3, this is accompanied by loss of the perovskite structure leading to structural collapse. The results presented have implications in terms of understanding of both the pseudocapacitive response of Mn oxide electrocatalysts and the processes behind degradation of the activity of the materials.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000661125100010

Here, we investigate the solid-state reduction and oxidation of sintered nonstoichiometric ceria at elevated temperatures relevant to solar thermochemical redox cycles for splitting H2O and CO2 (1673 K <= T <= 1823 K, 3 X 10(-4) atm <= p(O2) <= 2.5 x 10(-3) atm). Relaxation experiments are performed by subjecting the sintered ceria to rapid oxygen partial pressure changes and measuring the time required to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium state. From such data, we elucidate information regarding ambipolar oxygen diffusion coefficients through comparison of experimental data to a numerical approximation of Fick's second law based on finite difference methods. In contrast to typically applied analytical approaches, where diffusion coefficients are necessarily concentration independent, such a numerical approach is capable of accounting for more realistic concentration dependent diffusion coefficients and also accounts for transient gas phase boundary conditions pertinent to dispersion and oxygen consumption/evolution. Ambipolar diffusion coefficients are obtained in the range 1.5 center dot 10(-5) cm(2) s(-1) <= (D) over bar <= 4 center dot 10(-4) cm(2) s(-1) between 1673 and 1823 K These results highlight the rapid nature of ceria reduction to help guide the design of redox materials for solar reactors, the importance of accounting for transient boundary conditions during relaxation experiments (either mass based or conductivity based), and point to the flexibility of using a numerical analysis in contrast to typical analytical approaches.									96	3	0	0	2	0	96			1932-7447			WOS:000333005700018

Oxygen evolving thylakoid membranes and fragments were isolated from seawater suspended cells of Prochloron didemni by passage of the cells through a Yeda press and subsequent differential centrifugation of the broken material. Three fractions were collected at 1000xg, 5000xg, and 30 000xg and identified bl light microscopy as cells land their fragments), thylakoids and membrane fragments, respectively. Pigment content, oxygen evolution rate and 77 K fluorescence spectra of these fractions were virtually identical. This finding indicates that the membrane fragments obtained are not enriched in photosystem II. The P680(+.) reduction kinetics of thylakoid membrane fragments were determined by monitoring flash induced absorption changes at 830 nm and analysing the time course of their decay. The multiphasic relaxation kinetics and their modification by NH(2)OH were found to he similar to those observed in cyanobacteria and plants, These findings provide an independent line of evidence for the idea of a high conservation of the basic structural and functional pattern of the water oxidising complex in all organisms that perform oxygenic photosynthesis.

J	Wu, Yanyou								Is bicarbonate directly used as substrate to participate in photosynthetic oxygen evolution								ACTA GEOCHIMICA				40	4			650	658		10.1007/s11631-021-00484-0		JUN 2021		AUG 2021	2021	If the photosynthetic organisms assimilated only CO2 in the Archean atmosphere, hydroxide ion in the Archean seawater would not increase. If plants would not consume bicarbonate as a direct substrate during photosynthesis, it is difficult to explain the evolution of Earth's environment. To date, it is generally accepted that photosynthetic O-2 evolution of plants come from water photolysis. However, it should be debated by evaluating the effect of bicarbonate in photosynthetic O-2 evolution, analyzing the role of carbonic anhydrase (CA) in photosynthetic O-2 evolution, and the relationship between thylakoid CA and photosynthetic O-2 evolution. In the paper, I propose that bicarbonate is directly used as substrate to participate in photosynthetic O-2 evolution. The rationality of bicarbonate photolysis of plants is discussed from the thermodynamics and evolution of Earth's environment. The isotopic evidence that bicarbonate is not the direct substrate of photosynthetic O-2 release is reexamined, and the new explanation of bicarbonate photolysis in photosynthetic O-2 evolution is proposed.									4	1	0	0	1	0	4			2096-0956	2365-7499		WOS:000664564100001

Herein, a novel electrode composed of Cr-doped Co2P with P vacancies nanowire arrays (denoted as CrCo2P(Vp) NWs) grown on nickel foam was fabricated via a hydrothermal and successive calcination method. The Cr doping and vacancy engineering synergistically enable the exposure of more active sites, optimize electronic structure, and accelerate the charge transport capability, thus enhancing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances. As a result, the obtained Cr0.4Co2P (Vp) NWs catalyst exhibits superior catalytic activities in 1.0 M KOH solution with low overpotentials of 37 mV at 10 mA cm (2) for HER and 253 mV at 20 mA cm (2) for OER, respectively. Furthermore, using Cr0.4Co2P(Vp) NWs as a dual-function catalyst only requires 1.54 V voltage at 10 mA cm (2) for overall water splitting. Notably, the Cr0.4Co2P(Vp) NWs catalyst displays satisfactory stability with only a small attenuation of 3.2% after 50 h in a constant current testing. This study highlights the synergistic effect between doping and anion-vacancies in the enhancement of electrocatalytic activities and provides a feasible strategy to design effective, earth-abundant, and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000858854300004

Herein, a novel hybrid composed of RuCo alloy bimodal nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon was prepared from pillar-layered chiral metal-organic frameworksviaone facile encapsulation-pyrolysis strategy. Due to the unique hybrid structure and composition, the optimized RuCo@NC-600 (prepared at a pyrolysis temperature of 600 degrees C) catalyst exhibits outstanding HER catalytic activities in alkaline, acidic, and neutral media. Remarkably, the RuCo@NC-600 achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at extremely low overpotentials of 34, 6 and 60 mV in 1.0 M KOH, 0.5 M H(2)SO(4)and 1.0 M PBS solutions, respectively, superior to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. In addition, a symmetric two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer device pairing RuCo@NC-600 as both cathode and anode displays excellent performance, along with an impressive stability without noticeable attenuation up to 120 h. This work paves the way to the rational development of efficient pH-universal HER electrocatalysts.									40	1	0	0	3	0	40			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000544719500058

Herein, we first dexterously design and synthesize a class of ternary Nb-6/CZS/g-CN photocatalysts for the removal of hexavalent chromium Cr (VI) and organic dye pollutant (MO) from wastewater under visible-light irradiation. A heterojunction Nb-6-1/CZS/g-CN loaded with 0.01 g K7HNb6O19 showed excellent photocatalytic performance, with the MO photodegradation efficiency of 94% in 1 h and the Cr (VI) (150 mg/l) photoreduction efficiency as high as 91% in 2 hr. The main active species were deemed to be O-2(.-). Additionally, the as-prepared ternary heterojunction exhibits superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate. A heterojunction Nb-6-4/CZS/g-CN loaded with 0.5 g K7HNb6O19 exhibited the highest H-2 evolution rate as high as 1777.86 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under visible-light illumination, which is increased to 5.7 and 2.7 times that of bare CZS and biphase heterojunction CZS/g-CN. These findings afford a new class of promising low-cost photocatalyst bodying for its huge potential value in sustainable energy development and wastewater treatment.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			0268-2605	1099-0739		WOS:000482781200001

Selective control of localised vs. delocalised carriers in anatase TiO2 through reaction with O2 [arXiv]								arXiv								29 pp.	29 pp.						8 Oct. 2019	2019	Two-dimensional (2D) metallic states induced by oxygen vacancies at oxide surfaces and interfaces provide new opportunities for the development of advanced applications, but the ability to control the behavior of these states is still limited. We used Angle Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy combined with density functional theory to study the reactivity of states induced by the oxygen vacancies at the (001)-(1x4) surface of anatase TiO2, where both 2D metallic and deeper lying in-gap states (IGs) are observed. Remarkably, the two states exhibit very different evolution when the surface is exposed to molecular O2: while IGs are almost completely quenched, the metallic states are only weakly affected. The energy scale analysis for the vacancy migration and recombination resulting from the DFT calculations confirms indeed that only the IGs originate from and remain localized at the surface, whereas the metallic states originate from subsurface vacancies, whose migration and recombination at the surface is energetically less favorable rendering them therefore insensitive to oxygen dosing.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						INSPEC:19444702

Howe.er, the poor transport ability and easy recombination of charge carriers limit photocatalytic water oxidation acti.ity of pure Bi.O-4. Herein, the photocatalytic acti.ity of Bi.O-4 is enhanced .ia adjusting its morphology and combination co-catalyst. First, the Cu-Bi.O-4 was synthesized by copper doping to control the growth of {110} facet of Bi.O-4, which is regarded for the separation of photo-generated charge carriers. Then the CoOx in-situ generated from K-6[SiCoII(H2O)W11O39] . 16H(2)O was photo-deposited on Cu-Bi.O-4 surface as co-catalyst to speed up reaction kinetics. Cu-Bi.O-4@CoOx hybrid catalyst shows highest photocatalytic acti.ity and best stability among all the prepared catalysts. Oxygen e.olution is about 34.6 mu mol in pH 4 acetic acid buffer under 420 nm LED irradiation, which is nearly 20 times higher than that of pure Bi.O-4. Apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) in 1 h and O-2 yield are 1.83% and 23.1%, respecti.ely. O-2 e.olution amount nearly maintains the original .alue e.en after 5 cycles.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000685933500001	34352152

Thermogravimetric analysis results showed that the uncoated and the AlF3-COated Li-0.35[Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3]O-2 powders experienced distinct Weight loss with increasing temperature, Of which the weight loss was ascribed to oxygen release from the active materials. The released oxygen amount was less for the AlF3-coated Li-0.35[Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3]O-2 than the uncoated material, probably due to the blocking of the oxygen evolution by the AlF3 coating. The weight loss was associated with the irreversible phase transformation from a rhombohedral layer (R3 (m) over bar) Structure to a cubic spinel (Fd3m) Structure, as confirmed by in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction. The reduced oxygen release brought about by the AlF3 coating delayed the phase transformation to the Cubic spinel Structure. This entailed shifts of the main exothermic reactions to higher temperatures for the active material in the presence of ail electrolyte. The AlF3 Coating remained oil the Surface of the active material to 300 degrees C. Thereafter, the layer changed to Li-Al-O with increasing temperature, as observed by the time-of-night secondary ion mass spectroscopy. The improved thermal properties of the chemically delithiated AlF3-coated Li-0.35[Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3]O-2 were ascribed to the Suppression of oxygen release from the active material, and this, ill turn, retarded the formation of the Cubic spinel phase.									96	7	0	0	2	0	110			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000275328700064

In particular, a longstanding goal has been to understand how the evolution of multicellularity conferred fitness advantages. Here we show that biofilms of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa produce structures that maximize cellular reproduction. Specifically, we develop a mathematical model of resource availability and metabolic response within colony features. This analysis accurately predicts the measured distribution of two types of electron acceptors: oxygen, which is available from the atmosphere, and phenazines, redox-active antibiotics produced by the bacterium. Using this model, we demonstrate that the geometry of colony structures is optimal with respect to growth efficiency. Because our model is based on resource dynamics, we also can anticipate shifts in feature geometry based on changes to the availability of electron acceptors, including variations in the external availability of oxygen and genetic manipulation that renders the cells incapable of phenazine production.									56	0	0	0	53	0	56			0027-8424			WOS:000329350700064	24335705

Scanning helium ion microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy are used to characterize the morphologies and phases of samples submitted to various treatments. These methods demonstrate the contrasting effects of thermal annealing and electrochemical treatment. The electrochemical performances of the corresponding electrodes under dark conditions are quantified by steady-state electrolysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A rough and amorphous Fe2O3 with phosphate incorporation is critical for the optimization of the water oxidation reaction.

In this paper, the morphological evolutions and nanomechanical property changes of Ni-Al -n LDH (n is the Ni/Al molar ratio) nanosheets during potential cycling were explored by in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy. The conversion of Ni2+ into Ni3+ and the amphoteric properties of Al3+ during potential cycling resulted in the dissolution of Ni-Al -n LDH nanosheets. The dissolution rate of Ni-Al-2 LDH nanosheets was slower than those of Ni-Al-2.5 LDH and Ni-Al-3 LDH nanosheets. Meanwhile, the Young's modulus value of the dissolved area was much larger than that of the undissolved area, and the dissolved area exhibited a harder property. It was attributed to the different microcrystalline structures of Ni-Al LDH nanosheets affected by the Ni/Al molar ratio and the rearrangement of Ni2+ and Al3+ during the reaction. The slow dissolution of Ni-Al-2 LDH nanosheets was beneficial to improving the electrochemical performance, while the fast dissolution of Ni-Al-2.5 LDH and Ni-Al-3 LDH nanosheets was not conducive to the electrochemical performance. Understanding the effect of the Ni/Al molar ratio on the morphological evolutions and nanomechanical property changes of Ni-Al LDH nanosheets during potential cycling has important guiding significance for the subtle compositional modification and structural design of Ni-Al LDHs as an electrode material.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000861743200001

It is seen that a two-step reduced chemical-kinetic mechanism involving as main species H-2, O-2, H2O, and H2O2, derived previously from a detailed mechanism by assuming all radicals to follow a steady-state approximation, suffices to describe accurately the ignition process. The strong temperature sensitivity of the corresponding overall rates enables activation-energy asymptotics to be employed for the analysis, following the ideas developed for mixing-layer ignition by Linan and Crespo in 1976 on the basis of one-step Arrhenius model chemistry. When the initial temperatures of both reactants differ by a relative amount that is of the order of or smaller than the ratio of this temperature to the effective activation temperature, the chemical reaction is seen to occur at a significant rate all across the mixing layer. The ignition time is then determined as a thermal runaway in a parabolic problem describing the evolution of the temperature increment and the H2O2 concentration, with local accumulation, chemical reaction, and transverse convection and diffusion, all being important. By way of contrast, when the air side is sufficiently hotter than the hydrogen side, as often occurs in applications, ignition occurs in a thin layer close to the air-side boundary, enabling a simplified description to be developed in which the ignition time is determined by analyzing the existence of solutions to a two-point boundary-value problem involving quasi-steady diffusion-reaction ordinary differential equations.

Here, the photocatalyst consists of a 100-nm thick Au film deposited on a corrugated silicon substrate. In this configuration, hot electrons photoexcited in the metal are injected into the solution, ultimately reversing the water oxidation reaction (O-2 + 4H(+) + 4e(-) (sic) 2H(2)O) and producing a photocurrent. In order to amplify this process, the gold electrode is patterned into a plasmon resonant grating structure with a pitch of 500 nm. The photocurrent (i.e., charge transfer rate) is measured as a function of incident angle using 633 nm wavelength light. We observe peaks in the photocurrent at incident angles of +/- 9 degrees from normal when the light is polarized parallel to the incident plane (p-polarization) and perpendicular to the lines on the grating. Based on these peaks, we estimate an overall plasmonic gain (or amplification) factor of 2.1 x in the charge transfer rate. At these same angles, we also observe sharp dips in the photoreflectance, corresponding to the condition when there is wavevector matching between the incident light and the plasmon mode in the grating. No angle dependence is observed in the photocurrent or photoreflectance when the incident light is polarized perpendicular to the incident plane (s-polarization) and parallel to the lines on the grating. Finite difference time domain simulations also predict sharp dips in the photoreflectance at +/- 9 degrees, and the electric field intensity profiles show clear excitation of a plasmon-resonant mode when illuminated at those angles with p-polarized light.

J	Kesel, Andreas J.; Day, Craig W.; Montero, Catherine M.; Schinazi, Raymond F.				Schinazi, Raymond F/B-6777-2017				A new oxygen modification cyclooctaoxygen binds to nucleic acids as sodium crown complex								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENERAL SUBJECTS				1860	4			785	794		10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.01.022				APR 2016	2016	Background: Oxygen exists in two gaseous and six solid allotropic modifications. An additional allotropic modification of oxygen, the cyclooctaoxygen, was predicted to exist in 1990.Methods: Cyclooctaoxygen sodium was synthesized in vitro from atmospheric oxygen, or catalase effect generated oxygen, under catalysis of cytosine nucleosides and either ninhydrin or eukaryotic low-molecular weight RNA. Thin-layer chromatographic mobility shift assays were applied on specific nucleic acids and the cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex.Results: We report the first synthesis and characterization of cyclooctaoxygen as its sodium crown complex, isolated in the form of three cytosine nucleoside hydrochloride complexes. The cationic cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex is shown to bind to nucleic acids (RNA and DNA), to associate with single-stranded DNA and spermine phosphate, and to be essentially non-toxic to cultured mammalian cells at 0.1-1.0 mM concentration.Conclusions: We postulate that cyclooctaoxygen is formed in most eukaryotic cells in vivo from dihydrogen peroxide in a catalase reaction catalyzed by cytidine and RNA. A molecular biological model is deduced for a first epigenetic shell of eukaryotic in vivo DNA. This model incorporates an epigenetic explanation for the interactions of the essential micronutrient selenium (as selenite) with eukaryotic in vivo DNA.General significance: Since the sperminium phosphate/cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex is calculated to cover the active regions (2.6%) of bovine lymphocyte interphase genome, and 12.4% of murine enterocyte mitotic chromatin, we propose that the sperminium phosphate/cyclooctaoxygen sodium complex coverage of nucleic acids is essential to eukaryotic gene regulation and promoted proto-eukaryotic evolution.

The structural, morphological, electrical, and thermal expansion properties as a function of varying x are systematically investigated. All samples feature rhombohedral phase, and their lattice parameters are accurately calculated by Rietveld refinement software. Volume of oxygen vacancies initially decreases and then increases with increasing x, leading to diversified electrical properties. Deteriorated electrical properties of the ceramics with excessive x are attributed to the increment of defect complexes with a large volume of oxygen vacancies. The coefficient of thermal expansion values of the ceramics that is influenced by phase evolution and structure defects under different temperature ranges are studied. The respective optimal electrical properties, that is, d(33) = 186 pC N-1 and k(p) = 27.2% are obtained at x = 0.30 mol%. This research is believed to be insightful to practical application of the lead-free multifunctional electron components.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1862-6300	1862-6319		WOS:000456684300013

However, its high over-potential and sluggish kinetics cause an additional energy loss and hinder its practical application. The cobalt spinel oxide Co3O4 exhibits a high catalytic activity for the OER in alkaline solutions. However, the activity requires further enhancement to meet the industrial demand for hydrogen production. This paper presents an electrochemical deposition method to obtain cobalt oxides with a controllable crystallinity on carbon paper (CP). Usually, cobalt oxides grown on CP have a Co3O4 spinel oxide structure. The self-supported Co3O4/CP exhibited a considerable catalytic activity for the OER. When a VS2 layer grown on the CP beforehand by a hydrothermal method was used as substrate, the deposited cobalt oxides were in an amorphous state, denoted as CoOx/VS2/CP, which exhibited a higher OER activity and better stability than those of Co3O4/CP. The enhancement in the catalytic activity was attributed to the mixture formation of different types of cobalt species, including Co3O4, CoO, Co(OH)(2), and metallic Co, because of the reduction by VS2. We also clarify the significance of the crystallinity of cobalt oxides in the improvement in the OER activity. This process can also be applied to the direct formation of other types of self-supported oxide electrodes for OER catalysis.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2046-2069		WOS:000771032200001	35424826

However, its low efficiency could limit its development. Herein, in order to improve the efficiency of PEC water spilling, the all-solid-state direct Z-scheme Ti-ZnFe2O4/Ti-Fe2O3(TZFO/Ti-Fe2O3) nanorod arrays composited with the ideal energy band structure are synthesized by modulating the Fermi level of TZFO for PEC water splitting. The photophysical methods in this work, including the Kelvin probe measurement and transient photovoltage spectroscopy(TPV) measurement, are applied to explore the migration behavior of electric charges at the enhanced interface electric field. Finally, the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism of TZFO/Ti-Fe2O3 photoanode is proved successfully. Benefiting from the desirable charge transfer at interface electric field, the TZFO/Ti-Fe2O3 exhibits the outstanding photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction(OER) performance, and the photocurrent of 60TZFO/Ti-Fe2O3 photoanode reaches 2.16 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode(RHE), which is three times higher than that of pure Ti-Fe2O3 photoanode. This work provides a facile approach of modulating interface electric field to optimize the Z-scheme charge-transfer process.									16	2	0	0	1	0	16			1005-9040	2210-3171		WOS:000602982500012

These were calculated for first and second dredge-up, and for some masses also for third dredge-up and ''hot bottom'' convective envelope burning on the AGB. We demonstrate that O-16/O-17 in red giant envelopes is primarily a function of the star's mass, while O-16/O-18 is primarily a function of the initial composition. Uncertainties in the O-17-destruction rate have no effect on the O-16/O-18 ratio for stars from 1 to 2.5 M., but do affect the ratios for higher masses: the stellar O-16/O-17 observations are consistent with the Landre et al. (1990) rates using f = 0.2 for O-17(p, gamma)F-18 and O-17(p, alpha)N-14, and with the Caughlan & Fowler (1988) rates using f almost-equal-to 1. The stellar O-16/O-18 observations require f almost-equal-to 0 in the Caughlan & Fowler O-18(p, alpha)N-15 rate.First dredge-up has the largest effect on the oxygen isotope ratios, decreasing O-16/O-17 significantly from the initial value and increasing O-16/O-18 slightly. Second and third dredge-up have only minor effects for solar metallicity stars. The absence of very low observed O-16/O-18 ratios is consistent with a major increase in the O-18(alpha, gamma)Ne-22 rate over the Caughlan & Fowler (1988) value. Hot bottom burning in stars above about 5 M. can cause a huge increase in O-16/O-18 (to greater than or similar to 10(6)), and possibly a significant decrease in O-16/O-17; these are accompanied by a huge increase in Li-7 and a value of C-12/C-13 almost-equal-to 3.The oxygen isotope ratios in the Al2O3 grains (Orgueil grain B, the Murchison 83-5 grain, and the new Bishunpur B39 grain) can be accounted for if they originated in stars that did NOT have the same initial O-16/O-18 ratio. Thus one cannot assume uniform isotope ratios, even for stars of nearly solar composition. The grains' O-16/O-17 ratios, together with the Mg-26 excesses that indicate grain formation in a Al-26-rich environment, indicate that the Orgueil grain B and Murchison 83-5 grain originated in stars of roughly 1.5 M., during third dredge-up on the AGB. The new Bishunpur B39 grain originated in a star of either 2 or of 4-7 M..									91	0	0	0	0	0	91			0004-637X			WOS:A1994NW51400020

Ti_2C,as one of the 2D-MXene, has excellent properties relating to many active sites, mechanical stability, conductivity, etc., and has become a potential HER catalyst. However, the modification of the surface of Ti_2C by terminal O will reduce the conductivity, thereby limiting the transport of electrons between the valence band and the conduction band. In this study, an electric double layer Janus-TiNbCO_2 was constructed by Nb doping. The band property, HER activity and HER reaction path of Janus-TiNbCO_2 are studied by the first-principles calculations. The results show that Nb doping increases the distance between Ti and O atoms, which increases the lattice parameters of Janus-TiNbCO_2 comparing with that of Ti_2CO_2 structure. The Janus-TiNbCO_2 structure is stable by calculating the thermodynamic stability at 500 K using AIMD method. The band gap of Ti_2CO_2 is approximate 0.9 eV. After Nb doping, the orbital hybridization between Nd-3d and O-2p affects the electronic rearrangement of Ti-3d, leading that Janus-TiNbCO_2 has the metal band structure. In Janus-TiNbCO_2, both Ti and Nb surfaces adsorb H* by O site, where the DeltaG_(H*)(@Ti) = -0.55 eV,DeltaG_(H*)(@Nb) = 0.02 eV,showing Ti and Nb surfaces have different catalytic activities. Comparing with graphenes, e.g., h-B2O,Pt, and g-C_3N_4, Janus-TiNbCO_2 has better catalytic activity. The charge distribution of Janus-TiNbCO_2 near the Fermi level was analyzed by HSE-06 function. The result reveals that O atoms on the Ti surface exhibit charge unsaturation at the Fermi level, while those on Nb surface strong saturation. Moreover, the effects of H* coverage and strains (+2% ~+4%) on the catalyst activity of Janus-TiNbCO_2 are studied. When the H* coverage is low, the optimal DeltaG_(H*) of Nb surface is approximate 0.02 eV, while Ti surface has an excellent catalytic activity at high H* coverages (theta = 7/9,DeltaG_(H*) = -0.06 eV). Under the strain action, the H* coverage on surface is not affected. However, strains will reduce the HER activity of Nb surface, and increase the HER activity of Ti surface. Furthermore, oxygen defect is a stable point defect in Janus-TiNbCO_2. Oxygen defect will increase the HER activity of Ti surface and decrease the HER activity of Nb surface. Comparing to the Tafel pathway, the Heyrovsky is a more suitable pathway for the HER, in which the migration barrier of Heyrovsky is 0.23 eV for H* on Nb surface. Janus-TiNbCO_2 can be used as a potential HER catalyst.			探寻具有高导电性和高催化活性的析氢反应(HER)催化材料一直是可持续能源发展研究中的热点。Ti2C具有表面活性位点多和优良的力学稳定性、导电性等,已成为潜在的制氢催化剂。然而,终端O修饰Ti_2C表面,会降低该材料的导电性,进而限制了电子在价带与导带间的输运。本研究通过Nb掺杂,构建双电层Janus-TiNbCO_2,并借助VASP软件研究了Janus-TiNbCO_2的能带结构、HER性能和HER反应路径过渡态。结果表明,Janus-TiNb-CO_2为导体材料,其在应力、氧空位缺陷和H*覆盖度的影响下,均表现出极优异的催化活性,计算获得的最优DeltaG_(H*)值为0.02 eV。H*在Janus-TiNbCO_2上可能以Heyrovsky路径进行反应,该路径的迁移能势垒为0.23 eV。Janus-TiNbCO_2是一种具有HER应用前景的催化材料。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1006-3471			CSCD:7091387

Intensification of rate of diffusion controlled reactions in a parallel plate electrochemical reactor stirred by a curtain of electrochemically generated gas bubbles								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY				30	10			1406	1411		10.1002/ceat.200700158				OCT 2007	2007	Rates of mass transfer were measured at a vertical plate stirred by a rising curtain of oxygen bubbles generated electrochemically at an upstream plate by measuring the limiting current of the cathodic reduction of K3Fe(CN)(6) in alkaline solution. The rate of mass transfer was found to increase over the natural convection value by a factor ranging from 2.4 to 25 compared to the previously reported range of 2-5 in the case of copper deposition from acidified solutions. The high tendency of oxygen bubbles to coalesce in alkaline solutions is believed to be responsible for the high rates of mass transfer in alkaline solutions. The rate of mass transfer at a plate stirred by a curtain of oxygen bubbles was found to decrease with increasing plate height and electrolyte concentration. Curtains of H-2 bubbles were found to be less effective in enhancing the rate of mass transfer compared to that of oxygen. Practical application of the results in designing a modified parallel plate electrochemical reactor stirred by a counterelectrode gas curtain was highlighted. The suggested design has the potential of saving part or all of the mechanical stirring energy as well as floor space since it extends vertically.									14	1	0	0	3	0	14			0930-7516			WOS:000250122500013

In this work, the effect of hydrothermal carbonization temperature and time on the structures, chemical compositions and combustion characteristics of hydrochars obtained from tobacco stalks were evaluated. The carbon content, higher heating value, and energy yield increased with accompanying decrease in hydrogen and oxygen contents with the increase of treatment temperature and time. The evolution of the H/C and O/C atomic ratios indicated dehydration and devolatilization processes occurred during hydrothermal carbonization. The weight loss, combustion range and characteristic temperatures of tobacco stalks were significantly modified after hydrothermal carbonization, resulting in higher ignition temperatures and higher energy density. The kinetics model, Coats-Redfern method revealed the activation energy of hydrochars in zone 2 and 3 were among 43.7-74.8 kJ/mol and 46.7-85.8 kJ/mol, respectively. Our results show that hydrothermal carbonization reaction can facilitate transforming tobacco stalks into energy-rich solid fuel. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The major challenge of the existed non-precious metals in place of the noble metal catalysts (Pt, Pd, Au et al.) for ORR is their low efficiency, which urgently needs special route to tackle this issue. Herein, we report a simple and convenient technique using prussian blue analogues as precursor to directly synthesize the N-doped graphene encapsulated CoFe alloy which is present in "Core-Shell" structure via calcination of Co2Fe(CN)(6) in inert condition. The encapsulation of metal alloy within graphene shell immensely promotes the electron transfer from the encapsulated metals to the graphene surface. It efficiently optimizes the electronic structure of the as-synthesized catalyst and thereby triggers high ORR activity. The surrounding activated carbon (AC) contributes to the large pore structure and further offers a commodious route for the oxygen to gain electron. Therefore, the total resistance of air cathodes is significantly reduced from 17.300 Omega to 9.5515 Omega and the electrochemical activity is greatly improved. The power performances of MFCs indicate that CoFe/C-10% presents the highest maximum power density (MPD) of 1616 mW m(-2), which is 5 times larger than that of the bare AC. It is well concluded that the graphene encapsulated CoFe alloy can be recognized as potential ORR catalyst for MFCs.									31	2	0	0	2	0	33			0956-5663	1873-4235		WOS:000442191900099	30096734

Herein, for the first time, we present a novel hybrid of ruthenium diphosphide encapsulated in P-doped porous carbon (denoted as RuP2@PC) utilizing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as templates by a multi-step strategy. Unexpectedly, benefitting from the synergistic contribution of highly dispersed ultrafine RuP2 nanoparticles, porous carbon skeleton, and P-dopant, the as-synthesized RuP2@PC exhibits exceptional catalytic activity and superior durability as pH-universal electrocatalysts for the HER. Particularly, a low overpotential of 78.9 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 36.7 mV dec(-1) can be achieved in 1.0 M KOH toward the HER. Such outstanding electrocatalytic properties exceed those of commercial Pt/C and rank the catalyst among the best HER electrocatalysts reported until now. Importantly, this work paves a new route in elaborately fabricating efficient and stable electrocatalysts based on MOFs for energy-related fields.									19	2	0	0	0	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000651069900001

Coupling FeNi catalysts with other transition metals is an effective strategy to improve the OER performance, but the electronic structure regulation of the catalytic center is challenging. Herein, heterostructures catalyst composed of MoC and FeNi alloy embedded in N-doped biochar (denoted as MoC-FeNi@NLC) was in situ synthesized by pyrolysis of lignin-metals coordination complex. MoC-FeNi@NLC displayed an overpotential of 198 mV and a long steady running time of 200 hat 10 mA.cm(-2) in alkaline media. Furthermore, MoC-FeNi@NLC has demonstrated excellent Faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 90 %. A voltage of 1.50 V was required based on the MoC- FeNi@NLC and Pt/C coupling system, which was superior to that of commercial noble metal catalysts (Pt/ C || Ir/C, 1.57 V). The density functional theory demonstrated that FeNi alloy balanced the adsorption energy of OER intermediates and regulated the orbital overlap of Mo above Fermi level. While the lignin-derived carbon layer prevented the deactivation and dissolution of catalytic center. The construction strategy of transition metal alloys and carbides heterojunction by the assistance of sustainable lignin derivatives and its structure-activity relationship toward OER electrocatalytic process provides a promising and cost-efficient pathway for the design of high-performance and stable OER catalysts.

However, conventional SPR Au chips suffers from a high background signal, narrow electrochemical window, and limited electrochemical stability. Presented in this work is a novel SPR chip composed of the Au/long-chain alkane thiol self-assembled monolayer/single-layer graphene (Au/SAM/G) sandwich architecture to address these problems. On this chip, the single-layer graphene serves as a working electrode for electrochemical measurement, and the underlying Au film serves as the SPW support for SPR monitoring; the sandwiched thiol monolayer enables the electrical separation of the graphene and Au film to protect the Au film from electrochemical polarization. Our experiment indicates that the electrochemical window of such a chip extends beyond the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction potential on Au with significantly improved electrochemical stability and suppressed background signal. Moreover, its intrinsic SPR sensitivity is completely reserved even compared to that of the conventional SPR Au chip. This Au/SAM/G chip may offer a valuable solution to the EC-SPR investigations in harsh conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1618-2642	1618-2650		WOS:000474354500026	30450508

Non-noble transition metals are the most promising candidates for replacement of conventional Pt group catalysts for the HER. However, most non-noble metals show poor HER activity due to their intrinsic electronic structures. Herein, we use a multifaceted Dual doping Single doping heteroatom doping method (nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus) to directly and continuously fine-tune the electronic structure and HER activity of non-noble metals without changing their chemical composition. As a proof-of-concept, a nitrogen and phosphorus dual-doped Ni catalyst is explored by precisely manipulating doping modes, revealing the best HER performance among all doped Ni catalysts tested. The doping-induced charge redistribution in the Ni metal significantly influences its catalytic performance for the HER in alkaline media, which is confirmed by merging theoretical calculation with synchrotron-based spectroscopy. The principle that can bridge the doping modes and HER activity of the doped catalysts is built with a volcano relationship.									200	15	0	0	14	0	201			2380-8195			WOS:000464889300001

The parasite requires specific regulation of certain proteins to maintain its physiological functions to survive in the more oxygenated condition. Our endeavor was to know how does amoeba adapt itself in a high-oxygen environment. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was found to accumulate in an increasing concentration within the stressed trophozoites in a time-dependent manner. Increased cytopathic activity was detected at 2 h in high-oxygen-exposed E. histolytica lysate compared to lysate of normal E. histolytica trophozoites by Ussing chamber assay. The differential display and semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed overexpression in the mRNA levels of thiol-dependent peroxidase (Eh29), superoxide dismutase (SOD), EhCP5, G protein, HSP70, and peptidylprolyl isomerase at different time periods of oxidative stressed trophozoites compared to normally cultured E. histolytica. Analyses of the up-regulated genes that are associated with stress response, viz., signal transduction, tissue destruction, and oxidative stress management, including enhanced expression of a 29-kDa Eh29, suggest that this organism has several protective mechanisms to deal with oxidative stress during invasion.

Herein, we propose a common approach to prepare amorphous noble metal alloy nanosheets as advanced bifunctional catalysts to drive the efficient electrochemical water splitting by rapidly annealing metal acetylacetonate (metal = Ru,Co,Fe) and alkali salts, which allows to optimize their catalytic properties by tuning the introduction of transition metals. In particular, as-prepared amorphous RuCoFe nanosheets achieve not only an extremely low overpotential of 2.04 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction under alkaline media, but also a high-performance and stable overall water electrolysis with a potential of mere 1.56 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Considering the advantages of polymetallic amorphous nanosheets electrocatalysts, our proposed synthetic strategy could be versatile and applicable toward further developing other functional polycompounds for energy generation, storage and conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000691437000003

Recent studies are mainly concerned with semiconducting materials like sulfides, selenides, and phosphides of different transition metals as electrocatalysts. Doping of the transition metals within the host matrix is a good strategy to improve the electrocatalytic activity of the host material. However, this activity largely depends on the nature of the dopant metal and its host matrix as well. To exploit this idea, here, in the present work, we have synthesized semiconducting Ag2S nanoparticles and successfully doped them with different transition metals like Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni to study their electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction from neutral water (pH = 7). Among the systems doped with these transition metals, the Ni-doped Ag2S (Ni-Ag2S) system shows a very low overpotential (50 mV) with high catalytic current in neutral water. The trend in electrocatalytic activity of different transition metals has also been explained. The Ni-Ag2S system also shows very good stability in ambient atmosphere over a long period of time and suffers no catalytic degradation in the presence of oxygen. Structural characterizations are carried out using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to establish the phase purity and morphology of the materials.									11	0	0	0	1	0	12			2470-1343			WOS:000454244600075	31458326

The special morphology of the g-C3N4/MoS2 composite heterostructure with advantages of more exposed edge, better conductivity and defect-structures remarkably improves electrochemical active sites, which leads to an outstanding electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a small Tafel slop of 55.7 mV decade(-1) and low overpotential (98.8 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) more than most MoS2-based catalysts reported. The unique g-C3N4/MoS2 composite heterostructure can be applied in the field of energy conversion and storage.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000486022200065

T. Martinez , Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2, 589 (2000)] for this system. This PES was shown to account very well for the various experimental results available for the HOCl system. It has been found that this reaction occurs following different mechanisms depending on whether the HClO, HOCl, or both wells are visited in the course of the reaction. The different scalar and vector properties are strongly dependent on the type of mechanism through which a reaction takes place. Calculations have also been carried out to determine the distribution of collision times for each of the different mechanisms, and the time evolution of the differential cross section. For both reaction chemical channels the backward scattering is delayed with respect to the appearance of forward scattering. Although this reaction has been considered traditionally as an insertion reaction, it has been found that the first stages of the close interaction between the three atoms correspond to an attachment type of mechanism.

In this paper, a new type of dimensionally stable anodes, Ti/RuO2-IrO2-Sb2O5-SnO2, was investigated for Cl-2 evolution from seawater. The physicochemical and electrochemical properties were examined, and the electrocatalytic activity for Cl-2 evolution was measured under different conditions. It was shown that the RuO2-IrO2Sb2O5-SnO2 coating was compact in microstructure. The current efficiency was 71.2-86.7%, depending on the operational conditions. The anodes were predicted to be able to work effectively for over 6 years at a current density of 1500 A m(-2) for seawater electrolysis.

But high cost and stability issues of noble metal catalysts call for research on tailoring novel metal-organic framework (MOF) based architectures which can bifunctionally catalyze O(2)reduction and evolution reactions (ORR & OER). In this work, we report a novel manganese MOF @rGO nanocomposite synthesized using a facile self-templated solvothermal method. The nanocomposite is superior to commercial Pt/C catalyst both in material resource and effectiveness in application. A more positive cathodic peak (E-pc= 0.78 Vvs.RHE), onset (E-onset= 1.09 Vvs.RHE) and half wave potentials (E-1/2= 0.98 Vvs.RHE) for the ORR and notable potential to achieve the threshold current density (E@10 mA cm(-2)= 1.84 Vvs.RHE) for OER are features promising to reduce overpotentials during ORR and OER. Small Tafel slopes, methanol tolerance and acceptable short term stability augment the electrocatalytic properties of the as-prepared nanocomposite. Remarkable electrocatalytic features are attributed to the synergistic effect from the mesoporous 3D framework and transition metal-organic composition. Template directed growth, tunable porosities, novel architecture and excellent electrocatalytic performance of the manganese MOF @rGO nanocomposite make it an excellent candidate for energy applications.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15				2046-2069		WOS:000553911800052	35516955

Molekuliarnaia biologiia				14	4			804	13						1980 Jul-Aug	1980	The hexane treatment of the freeze-dried chloroplasts from bean leaves results in complete inhibition of electron transport from water to silicomolybdate, as a specific electron acceptor from photosystem 2 insensitive to 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl-urea. The photophosphorylation coupled to this electron flow is inhibited as well. The reconstruction with the concentrated hexane extract or with the coenzyme Q results in partial reactivation of the light-induced O2 evolution, silicomolybdate reduction and coupled phosphorylation. The electron transport model of the oxidizing side of photosystem 2 is put forward, according to which plastoquinone acts as an electron carrier between the manganese water-splitting complex and the photosystem 2 reaction center. The accumulation of positive charges during four subsequent photosystem 2 excitations occurs in the form of ion-pairs of plastosemiquinone radical anion with manganese (III) cation, separated from the photochemical center by a hydrophobic barrier. The two water molecules are oxidized by interaction with an electron acceptor of moderate redox potential near 0.8 beta without formation of toxic active species such as OH-radicals as intermediates.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0026-8984			MEDLINE:7421803	7421803

Systematic photoelectrochemical characterization along with O-2 evolution measurements were carried out in order to better understand the mechanisms of both water and methanol oxidation at hematite electrodes. When both water and methanol are present in the solution, they are oxidized competitively with each other, allowing the detection and assignment of distinct surface states characteristic to each process. The measurement of different surface states for methanol and water oxidation, along with the absence of measurable surface states in an inert acetonitrile electrolyte, clearly shows that the detected surface states are chemically distinct reaction intermediates of water or methanol oxidation.									45	0	0	0	3	0	46			1944-8244			WOS:000353177000028	25804788

When the films are heated in air above 500 K, the film thickness and the areal densities of C and especially D decrease, and oxygen is incorporated in the films. The initial atomic loss rates of carbon and deuterium from the films are 2.6 x 10(17) C atoms cm(-2) h(-1) and 4.8 x 10(17) D atoms cm(-2) h(-1) at 550 K. However, after D depletion the films show a resistivity against further erosion due to annealing in air. When the films are heated under vacuum erosion starts at about 600 K and all components including D decrease proportionally to the film thickness. Thermal desorption spectroscopy of the films reveals the evolution of CxDy type hydrocarbons. Infrared analysis shows that the incorporated oxygen is chemically bonded to carbon. The thermally-activated decomposition of the soft a-C:D films is compared to that of hard a-C:D films and a reaction scheme is suggested. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the poor cycling life and shelf life of Zn-Ni battery strongly limit its practical application. Herein, a solid-state functionalized composite (FC) separator was developed through a simple strategy to steadily regulate the anode-electrolyte interface characteristics to comprehensively improve the performance of Zn-Ni battery. FC separator has interaction with anode to guide even Zn deposition during cycling. As a result, the battery assembled with FC separator achieves superb cycling life of 1435 h (848th cycle). In addition, under the function of the PAAK from FC separator, hydrogen evolution reaction can be mitigated. The water retention ability has also been improved to ensure good storage performance, in which the battery exhibits an open circuit voltage higher than 1.63 V after 618 h at a high temperature of 60 ?C. Besides, the negative effect brought by oxygen from cathodes has been reduced. Consequently, the battery keeps a high discharge capacity without breakdown for more than 800 h floating charge at 60 ?C. The results demonstrate the large potentials for use in next-generation Zn-Ni batteries.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000793208500001

At first, this paper introduces the significance of the tuning of electronic structure, where modifying the electronic structure of the electrocatalysts could generate active sites having optimal adsorption energy with OER intermediates, and that could diminish the energy barrier for OER, and that could improve the activity for OER. Later, this paper reviews the tuning of electronic structure along with catalytic performances, synthetic methodologies, chemical properties, and DFT calculations on various nanostructured earth-abundant electrocatalysts for OER in alkaline environment. Further, this review discusses the tuning of the electronic structure of the several nanostructured earth-abundant electrocatalysts including oxide, (oxy)hydroxide, layered double hydroxide, alloy, metal phosphide/phosphate, nitride, sulfide, selenide, carbon containing materials, MOF, core-shell/hetero/hollow structured materials, and materials with vacancies/defects for OER in alkaline environment (including activity: overpotential (g) of <200 mV at 10 mA cm(-2); stability: >100 h; durability: >5000 cycles). Then, this review discusses the robust stability of the electrocatalysts for OER towards practical application. Moreover, this review discusses the in situ formation of thin layer on the catalyst surface during OER. In addition, this review discusses the influence of the adsorption energy of the OER intermediates on OER performance of the catalysts. Finally, this review summarizes the various promising strategies for tuning the electronic structure of the electrocatalysts to achieve enhanced performance for OER in alkaline environment.

The novel sensor showed a high sensitivity of 6.04 mA mu M-1 cm(-2) with a lowest detection limit of 3.7 nM in a wide detection range of 100 nM-10 mM. The proposed sensor exhibited a superior selectivity without any interference from the oxygen evolution reaction during glucose sensing. We also found that this glucose sensor showed negligible interference from various interferents, such as ascorbic acid, uric acid, dopamine and sodium chloride. Additionally, a novel flexible sensor was developed by coating the NiVP/Pi over Whatman filter paper, which exhibited two linear ranges of 100 nM to 1 mu M and 100 mu M to 10 mM with an ultra-sensitivity of 1.130 mA mu M-1 cm(-2) and 0.746 mA mu M-1 cm(-2), respectively, in 0.1 M NaOH. The proposed sensor was tested with human blood serum samples demonstrating its practical application. Our findings provide a new route by fine tuning the composition of nickel and vanadium that sheds new light on better understanding the processes. This NiVP/Pi-based sensor offers a new approach towards the electrochemical detection of glucose, enabling glucose monitoring in a convenient way.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2050-750X	2050-7518		WOS:000678218200001	34319345

XRD examination of the final powders indicates that reduction of ilmenite proceeds via elemental iron and rutile which is then further reduced to sub-oxides.

After treatment the formation of oxygen containing functional groups was observed in C K-edge and O K-edge XANES spectra of MWCNTs. Moreover, the degree of oxidation made to MWCNTs can be easily controlled by changing treatment temperature. Compared to the conventional liquid HNO3 treatment, the advantages of this method should allow effective large-scale production of oxygenated MWCNTs for the applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Photosynth. Res. 125 (2015) 95]. Fe(II) also extracts Mn cations from PSII(-Ca,4Mn), but only 2Mn/RC at pH 6.5, forming a heteronuclear 2Mn/2Fe cluster [Semin and Seibert, J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 48 (2016) 227]. Here we investigated the efficiency of Mn extraction by Fe(II) at acidic pH and found that Fe(II) cations can extract only 1Mn/RC from PSII(-Ca,4Mn) membranes at pH 5.7, forming a 3Mn/1Fe cluster. Also we found that the presence of Fe cations in a heteronuclear cluster (2Mn/2Fe) increases the resistance of the remaining Mn cations to H(2)Q action, since H(2)Q can extract Mn cations from homonuclear Mn clusters of PSII(-Ca,4Mn) and PSII (-Ca,2Mn) membranes but not from the heteronuclear cluster in PSII(-Ca,2Mn,2Fe) membranes. H(2)Q also cannot extract Mn from PSII membranes obtained by incubation of PSII(-Ca,4Mn) membranes with Fe(II) cations at pH 5.7, which suggests the formation of a heteronuclear 3Mn/1Fe cluster in the OEC. Functional activity of PSII with a 3Mn/1Fe cluster was investigated. PSII preparations with a 3Mn/1Fe cluster in the OEC are able to photoreduce the exogenous electron acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, possibly due to incomplete oxidation of water molecules as is the case with PSII(-Ca,2Mn,2Fe) samples. However, in the contrast to PSII (-Ca,2Mn,2Fe) samples PSII(-Ca,3Mn,1Fe) membranes can evolve O-2 at a low rate in the presence of exogenous Ca2+ (at about 27% of the rate of O-2 evolution in native PSII membranes). The explanation for this phenomenon (either water splitting and production of molecular O-2 by the 3Mn/1Fe cluster or apparent O-2 evolution due to minor contamination of PSII(3Mn,1Fe) samples with PSII(-Ca,4Mn) membranes) is discussed.									6	0	1	0	5	0	8			1011-1344			WOS:000424727600023	29156347

There are many problems associated with this process, such as the low electrochemical efficiency and the high corrosion capacity of chloride ions present in seawater. In this work, different materials proposed as possible electrodes or electrode supports in a NaCl solution are physicochemically analyzed from a comparative point of view. Corrosion studies by salt fog testing, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, and electrochemical analysis were carried out in this medium, and the catalytic efficiencies towards the electrochemical hydrogen generation were comparatively evaluated. Thus, samples of Ti, Ni, AISI 316L stainless steel, and Cu showed important hydrogen current in the analyzed potentials range. Their results recorded by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, in addition to the Tafel plots, confirmed to be good active catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction. On the other hand, materials as Al and carbon cloth show moderate and low corrosion in this medium and can be used as catalysts supports. It is found that nickel not only has a high tolerance to chloride ions but also presents the highest electrochemical efficiency. Its current density at -1.5 V-SCE is 3.22 x 10(-2) A cm(-2), followed in order by AISI 316L stainless steel with high Ni content (1.33 x 10(-2) A cm(-2)), concluding that Ni samples constitute the appropriate material for cathodes to be used in electrolyzers working with seawater.Graphical Abstract									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000649219100001

Here, the performance of a electrocatalyst with a three-dimensional structure of InZnCu on Cu foam (CF) is presented. This electrocatalyst was fabricated by electrodeposition of In and Zn over Cu and exhibited a superior reduction of CO2 to CO at a Faradaic efficiency of 93.7% at -0.7 V and an excellently long duration of 100 h. Due to the synergy of the thin In layer, the Zn nanosheets provided a high surface-active area and strong mechanical robustness during the reaction. Additionally, a two-electrode system was constructed based on the CF-modified surface, which provided valuable guidelines on the overall CO2RR-OER system for further evolution. Furthermore, due to the facile synthesis, the bimetal-layer double hydroxide (LDH) exhibited high conductivity and high OER performance. Hence, the two-electrode system assembled excellent electrocatalysts for the CO2RR-OER (InZnCu/CF||Cu(OH)(2) NWs@NiCo-LDH/CF) with high conversions of CO2 to CO of 67% and 88% at 2 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. Notably, the CO2RR-OER system exhibited excellent stability in a 40 h CO2 conversion with a constant current density of 2 mA cm(-2) at an ultralow voltage of 1.59 V. Moreover, the calculation of the energy input converting CO per ton of CO2 resulted in a low energy input range for further development in scalability. This overall CO2RR-OER proposes development in electrochemical CO2 reduction for industrial applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000834274600001

The evolution of the surface composition and topography was studied by angle-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), derivatization of amine groups with fluorescein isothiocyanate, scanning tunelling microscopy (STM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). XPS demonstrated a continuous increase in the oxygen content over periods of weeks; this was assigned to oxidation of trapped radicals and subsequent secondary reactions. In addition, the fluorine content also changed markedly on storage; the XPS fluorine signal suggested that there was a substantial amount of fluoride in the freshly treated surfaces, and this component disappeared rapidly on storage. STM and AFM showed no changes in topography with aging but suggested surface hardening on plasma treatment. The events following treatment of FEP and PTFE in antmonia plasmas are not adequately described by a model involving plasma-induced, instantaneous chemical modification followed by surface restructuring; the surface and sub-surface compositions evolve over a period of several weeks due to the occurrence of oxidative reactions, and these chemical changes interact with the physical process of surface restructuring.									69	1	0	0	4	0	69			0169-4243			WOS:A1994NK98700002

In this study, the unique tip-half-closed N-doped carbon nanohorns (THC-N-CNHs) were firstly produced by the positive pressure-assisted arc discharge method using N-2 as the nitrogen source. Benefitting from the novel tip-half-closed structure and sufficient porosity, the specific surface area (SSA) of THC-N-CNHs is calculated to be 670 m(2) g(-1) without any further treatment, which is three times larger than that of traditional tip-closed CNHs. More importantly, the content of nitrogen can achieve similar to 1.98 at% with noticeable pyridinic-N enrichment, increasing the number of active sites for the OER. Furthermore, the three-dimensional spherical feature and the unique pore structure for THC-N-CNHs lead to the fast transportation of electrons, and facile release of the evolved O-2 bubbles during the OER process. Therefore, THC-N-CNHs exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the OER, with an overpotential of 328 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to that of most N-doped carbon material-based electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, the resulting catalyst also shows excellent durability after long-term cycling. Finally, we emphasize that THC-N-CNHs can be promising candidates as cheap, industrially scalable catalytic scaffolds for OER application.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2046-2069		WOS:000714134600001	35493191

The practical implementation of these materials is, however, hindered by unsatisfactory capacity retention, poor thermal stability, and oxygen release as a consequence of structural decomposition, which may have serious safety consequences. The undesired side reactions are often exothermic, causing complicated electro-chemo-mechanical interplay at elevated temperatures. In this work, we explore the effects of thermal exposure on chemically delithiated LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC-811) at a practical state-of-charge (50% Li content) and an overcharged state (25% Li content). A systematic study using a suite of advanced synchrotron radiation characterization tools reveals the dynamics of thermal behavior of the charged NMC-811, which involves sophisticated structural and chemical evolution; e.g. lattice phase transformation, transition metal (TM) cation migration and valence change, and lithium redistribution. These intertwined processes exhibit a complex 3D spatial heterogeneity and, collectively, form a valence state gradient throughout the particles. Our study sheds light on the response of NMC-811 to elevated temperature and highlights the importance of the cathode's thermal robustness for battery performance and safety.									22	3	0	0	2	0	24			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000537707100021

The modified BiVO4 photoanode with optimal doping amount (denoted as BiVO4-CGS) shows the improved performance of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting with a 220 mV cathodic shift in onset potential and photocurrent density of 2.5 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is 2.8 times higher than that of pristine BiVO4. The enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to the increased charge carrier density, the improved charge separation efficiency and the accelerated surface oxygen evolution reaction (OER) dynamics of photoelectrodes. It is noted that the doping method applied here demonstrates an effective approach in not only avoiding the problems of uneven distribution of multi-dopants or phase separation occurring in regular method, but also implementing in-situ multi-metal doping in a simple way.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2196-7350			WOS:000516081400001

We directly measure, for the first time, the interface carrier transport properties of a prototypical visible-light-absorbing semiconductor, alpha-Fe2O3, in contact with one of the fastest known water oxidation catalysts, Ni0.8Fe0.2Ox, by directly measuring/controlling the current and/or voltage at the Ni0.8Fe0.2Ox catalyst layer using a second working electrode. The measurements demonstrate that the majority of photogenerated holes in alpha-Fe2O3 directly transfer to the catalyst film over a wide range of conditions and that the Ni0.8Fe0.2Ox is oxidized by photoholes to an operating potential sufficient to drive water oxidation at rates that match the photocurrent generated by the alpha-Fe2O3. The Ni0.8Fe0.2Ox therefore acts as both a hole-collecting contact and a catalyst for the photoelectrochemical water oxidation process. Separate measurements show that the illuminated junction photovoltage across the alpha-Fe2O3|Ni(0.8)Fe(0.2)Ox interface is significantly decreased by the oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ and the associated increase in the Ni(0.8)Fe(0.2)Ox electrical conductivity. In sum, the results illustrate the underlying operative charge-transfer and photovoltage generation mechanisms of catalyzed photoelectrodes, thus guiding their continued improvement.									46	1	0	0	5	0	46			2374-7943	2374-7951		WOS:000411712800016	28979943

The electrocatalytic properties of the lrO2-Ta2O5 /Ti coating anodes with and without TiN interlayer, such as the open-circuit potential, oxygen evolution, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were investigated. The results show that the IrO2-Ta2O5/TiN/Ti anodes have discontinuity crack and abundant IrO2 nanocrystals on the surface, which results in better electrocatalytic properties than the normal IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti anodes. The lower the sintering temperature for coating of lrO2-Ta2O5 layer is, the better electrochemical properties the IrO2-Ta2O5/TiN/Ti anodes have. The TiN film can increase the life time of coating anodes prepared at temperature lower than 500degC.									2	7	0	0	0	0	9			1004-0609			INSPEC:11112546

Fabricating type-II heterojunctions is an effective approach to improve the photocatalytic efficiency. Based on the band edge positions and lattice parameters, we found that several kinds of monochalcogenide monolayers can be used to fabricate type-II heterojunctions with C2N monolayers. C2N/GaTe and C2N/InTe van der Waals (vdW) heterojunctions were investigated as potential photocatalysts for water splitting by means of firstprinciples computations. Both are type-II heterojunctions, and could promote the efficient spatial separation of electron-hole pairs. Their band edges straddle water redox potentials, satisfying the requirements for photocatalytic water splitting. Besides, the high carrier mobility of C2N/GaTe and C2N/InTe heterojunctions implies that the transfer of carriers to reactive sites is easy, and the recombination probability of photo-generated carriers is reduced. The Gibbs free energy calculations indicate that C2N/GaTe and C2N/InTe heterojunctions, especially C2N/InTe, exhibit high catalytic performance towards hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. Particularly, C2N/InTe exhibits a direct band gap with strong absorption in both visible and near ultraviolet regions, indicating that it is a very promising candidate for photocatalytic water splitting. This work would provide a new idea for the development of type-II heterojunctions for photocatalytic water splitting.									52	4	0	0	1	0	52			2516-0230			WOS:000479164600016	36132456

Herein, we report the facile synthesis of N-graphyne, with a novel structure, by one-step ball milling of CaC(2)and pyrazine. The accurate doping of nitrogen atoms at the controllable sites of the molecular skeleton of gamma-graphyne was achieved using the nitrogenous precursor (pyrazine) as a reactant. Various techniques were adopted for the investigation of the composition, structure, and morphology of the obtained samples. The electrochemical measurements demonstrated that N-graphyne can serve as an excellent electrode material for both electrocatalysis and supercapacitors. As an electrocatalyst, N-graphyne exhibited an overpotential of 280 mV at 100 mA cm(-2)and a Tafel slope of 122 mV dec(-1)for the oxygen evolution reaction with highly stable morphology and electrocatalytic performance. As a supercapacitor electrode, N-graphyne showed a maximum capacitance of 235 F g(-1)at 1 A g(-1), and capacitance retention of 87% after 3000 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance of N-graphyne is due to the nitrogen heteroatomic defects, large electrochemical active surface areas and fast electron migration. Our studies provide a facile synthesis of novel N-graphyne with controllable doping sites and promote its potential applications in electrocatalysis and supercapacitors.									28	0	1	0	1	0	29			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000558102100028	32725021

The higher the temperature and the duration, the more severe is the heat treatment. The present work proposes a new Heat Treatment Severity Index (HTSI) for the quantification of the heat treatment severity during the pyrolysis reaction. This metric takes into account both effects of reactor temperature and heat treatment time inside the reactor. The relevance of this HTSI is assessed through analyzing the evolution of some properties of biochars obtained after pyrolysis of 370 mu m beech wood particles in an entrained flow reactor. These biochars were characterized for their chemical composition (elemental analysis), structure (Raman spectroscopy) and reactivity towards oxygen (thermogravimetric analysis). These properties were well correlated with the HTSI following remarkable mathematical relationships. This finding demonstrates the possibility to engineer biochars with controlled properties by a careful mastering of the experimental conditions of the pyrolysis process in terms of temperature and heat treatment time.									11	1	0	0	4	0	11			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000459434500007

Decomposition of perovskite oxides under applied potential is typically linked to cation leaching and amorphization of the material. However, structural changes and phase transformations at the catalyst surface were also shown to govern the activity of several perovskite electrocatalysts under applied potential. Hence, it is crucial for the rational design of durable perovskite catalysts to understand the interplay between the formation of active surface phases and stability limitations under OER conditions. In the present study, we reveal a surface-dominated activation and deactivation mechanism of the prominent electrocatalyst La0.6Sr0.4CoO3????? under steady-state OER conditions. Using a multiscale microscopy and spectroscopy approach, we identify the evolving Co-oxyhydroxide as catalytically active surface species and La-hydroxide as inactive species involved in the transient degradation behavior of the catalyst. While the leaching of Sr results in the formation of mixed surface phases, which can be considered as a part of the active surface, the gradual depletion of Co from a self-assembled active CoO(OH) phase and the relative enrichment of passivating La(OH)3 at the electrode surface result in the failure of the perovskite catalyst under applied potential.<comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000859957100001	36130265

In this study, a series of metal-free carbon nanotube (CNT) catalysts were designed and in situ functionalized by imidazolium ionic liquids (ILs) for enhanced electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that the functionalization of CNTs with imidazolium ILs facilitated the electron transfer process and exhibited superior hydrogen adsorption, thereby enhancing the performance of the HER.

In this work, a bio-inspired copper-bipyridine catalyst of Cu(dcbpy) is decorated on the nanoporous Si photoanode (black Si, b-Si). Under AM1.5G illumination, the b-Si/Cu(dcbpy) photoanode exhibits a high photocurrent density of 6.31 mA cm(-2) at 1.5 V-RHE at pH 11.0, which is dramatically improved from the b-Si photoanode (1.03 mA cm(-2)) and f-Si photoanode (0.0087 mA cm(-2)). Mechanism studies demonstrate that b-Si/Cu(dcbpy) has improved light-harvesting, interfacial charge-transfer, and surface area for water splitting. More interestingly, b-Si/Cu(dcbpy) exhibits a pH-dependent water oxidation behaviour with a minimum Tafel slope of 241 mV/dec and the lowest overpotential of 0.19 V at pH 11.0, which is due to the monomer/dimer equilibrium of copper catalyst. At pH similar to 11, the formation of dimeric hydroxyl-complex could form O-O bond through a redox isomerization (RI) mechanism, which decreases the required potential for water oxidation. This in-depth understanding of pH-dependent water oxidation catalyst brings insights into the design of dimer water oxidation catalysts and efficient photoanodes for solar energy conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000844544200001	35848162	
J	Jiang, Min; Hu, Xiaoyue; Tan, Pengfei; Pan, Jun								Highly clean and efficient iron phosphates modified by Ru nanocrystals for water oxidation								DALTON TRANSACTIONS				51	17			6778	6786		10.1039/d2dt00546h		APR 2022		MAY 3 2022	2022	Optimizing the architecture of non-polluting, highly efficient, robust, and cost-effective electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is extremely crucial for accelerating the application of water splitting. Herein, a highly green and active OER electrocatalyst composed of Ru nanocrystal modified iron-rich phosphates is successfully developed via a hydrothermal and post-annealing approach. The eco-friendly phosphorus source of lecithin is employed to fabricate transition metal phosphates for the first time, which avoids the use of toxic and dangerous phosphorus sources. Meanwhile, it is found that Ru nanocrystals could form heterostructures with iron phosphates and induce conversion to iron-rich phosphates, which would greatly enhance the conductivity of the substrate and elevate the catalytic activity. As a result, overpotentials of only 250 mV and 290 mV are required to deliver 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) using this typical electrocatalyst. Also, the j-t curve shows no distinct variations in current over 45 h at a constant overpotential of 334 mV, indicating the outstanding activity and durability of the catalyst. Furthermore, nickel/cobalt-rich phosphates and phosphides were also acquired using similar experimental procedures, manifesting the wide applicability of Ru actuation. Hence, this work offers a convenient and scalable method for designing highly efficient, green, clean, and cost-effective electrocatalysts for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000782957200001	35420102

The present study addresses this issue by employing an innovative strategy to investigate the relationship between the H-containing structures of g-C3N4 and its water splitting properties. The exchangeable and unexchangeable protons of the H-containing groups of g-C3N4 were differentiated by selective deuteration, providing a way to distinguish the hydrophilic and relatively non-hydrophilic H-containing groups of g-C3N4. A combination of advanced solid-state NMR approaches reveals that amino group defects (CN2(NHx)) on the C-N skeleton of the photocatalyst likely serve as hydrophilic active sites for facilitating the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. Accordingly, the newly synthesized g-C3N4 sample having a high concentration of CN2(NHx) by design demonstrates an enhanced H-2 yield by a factor of 17 compared to that of pure g-C3N4.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000621407000016		
J	Xiong, Xiaohe; Yu, Shilin; Qin, Dachuan; Tan, Houzhang; Lu, Xuchao								Evolution behaviors of the nitrogen-containing species and SO2 from coal fast pyrolysis								JOURNAL OF THE ENERGY INSTITUTE				105				133	140		10.1016/j.joei.2022.08.009				DEC 2022	2022	The nitrogen-containing species and SO2 generated during coal pyrolysis lead to environmental problems. This paper investigated the evolution behaviors of four identified nitrogen-containing species including hydrogen cyanide (HCN), ammonia (NH3), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) from fast pyrolysis of four different types of coal in a fixed bed reactor in the 600-1200( ?)C temperature range. Results show that HCN yield increases as the temperature increasing while the NH3 maximum yield exists a transition tem-perature ranging from 800 to 1000 ?C that depends on coal category. The impact of pyrolysis temperature on the SO(2 )yield is not linear. To further quantify the NH3 formation source, a mathematical method was proposed to divide the NH3 evolution profile into gas-gas reaction and gas-solid reaction two categories. The gas-solid re-action predominates the NH3 formation with a ratio up to 75% in 1200( ?)C high temperature condition. In low temperature condition, which path is predominant depends on the coal category. In addition, the oxynitride including both NO and NO(2 )were observed in pyrolysis process. Moreover, enhancing temperature can boost NO(2 )yield and restrain NO yield. The NO and NO(2 )come from the combination of nitrogen and oxygen functional group which are both directly split off the parent coal. In addition, the elements liberation sequence from fast to slow is carbon > sulfur > nitrogen. To be further, the liberation sequence of pyrolysis species from fast to slow is CO > SO2 > NO > NO2 > HCN > NH3, which can supply guides to remove pollutants in industry.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1743-9671	1746-0220		WOS:000860608300003

Herein, we developed a metal-organic framework (MOF)-aided topotactic transformation strategy for the fabrication of N-doped porous Mo2C mesocrystals on carbon fiber paper (N-Mo2C/CFP). The optimized N-Mo2C/CFP requires the overpotentials of only 45, 80 and 37 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)in acidic, neutral and alkaline media, respectively. The pH-universal HER activities are competitive with those of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. This work provides the advanced metal carbide mesocrystals as noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for HER in all pH ranges.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000578872600016

The key is to synthesize earth-abundant and noble-metal-free electrocatalysts with outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and durability in wide-pH electrolytes by simple and cost-effective methods. Herein, we reported a one-step synthesis of uniform, ultrafine molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) and molybdenum nitride (Mo2N) hybrid [together as Mo-2(CN)] inserted carbon nanosheets as efficient electrocatalyst for HER. The assynthesized catalyst showed an excellent HER activity in acid medium, and even superior performance was obtained in the alkaline medium. The optimal Mo-2(CN) annealed at 750 degrees C showed an overpotential of -80 mV at 10 mAcm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1); the former strikingly outperforms commercial 20% Pt/C materials (-112 mV). Moreover, Mo-2(CN) gave an onset voltage of -33mV and overpotential of -202 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) with merely a mass loading of 0.2 mg cm(-2), which are, to date, among the best records for Mo-based catalysts in both media. The nanosheet structure providing large active area and quick charge transfer, and the synergistic effects between Mo2C and Mo2N toward HER are ascribed to the outstanding electrocatalytic activity according to the capacitive current and turnover frequency analysis. The remarkable catalytic activity and operational durability in wide pH ranges guarantee their potential for highly efficient hydrogen production. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Higher graphitization degree of NFPGNS was in favor of charge transfer and mass transfer. Moreover, higher surface areas and various pore structures of NFPGNS were found to be beneficial for the accessment of active sites. Therefore, efficient catalytic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER) with the onset overpotential of only similar to 150 mV and superior stability has been investigated on the NFPGNS electrocatalysts. Doping of F evidently promotes the catalytic activity of N containing carbon materials for the HER. Further density functional theory (DFT) calculations have revealed the heteroatoms multi-doping effect on NFPGNS that leads to a lowest Gibbs free energy and stronger strength of H adsorption, thereby favoring the HER catalytic activity.									33	1	0	0	1	0	33			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000403002700009

A novel method based on electrochemical sulfide oxidation was recently shown to be highly effective for sulfide removal from synthetic and real sewage. Here, we compare the performance of five different mixed metal oxide (MMO) coated titanium electrode materials for the electrochemical removal of sulfide from domestic wastewater. All electrode materials performed similarly in terms of sulfide removal, removing 78 +/- 5%, 77 +/- 1%, 85 +/- 4%, 84 +/- 1%, and 83 +/- 2% at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) using Ta/Ir, Au/Ir, Pt/Ir, SnO(2) and PbO(2), respectively. Elevated chloride concentrations, often observed in coastal areas, did not entail any significant difference in performance. Independent of the electrode material used, sulfide oxidation by in situ generated oxygen was the predominant reaction mechanism. Passivation of the electrode surface by deposition of elemental sulfur did not occur. However, scaling was observed in the cathode compartment. This study shows that all the MMO coated titanium electrode materials studied are suitable anodic materials for sulfide removal from wastewater. Ta/Ir and Pt/Ir coated titanium electrodes seem the most suitable electrodes since they possess the lowest overpotential for oxygen evolution, are stable at low chloride concentration and are already used in full scale applications.

The subsequent photochemical reactions generate reactive oxygen species which are considered the principal cytotoxic agents to induce cell death. This technique has become widely used in medicine to treat tumors and other nonmalignant diseases. However, there are several factors related to illumination or the photosensitizer that limit an optimal treatment outcome. The use of nanoparticles (NP) for PDT has been proposed as a solution to current shortcomings. In this way, there are NPs that act as carriers for photosensitizers, NPs that absorb the light and transfer the energy to the photosensitizer and NPs that are themselves photodynamically active.In dermatology, the use of topical photosensitizers produces a time dependent inhomogeneous distribution within the tumor, where the stratum corneum is the main barrier to the diffusion of the photosensitizer to the deeper layers of skin. This produces an insufficient photosensitizer accumulation in tumor tissues and therefore, a low therapeutic efficiency in the case of deep lesions.This work focuses in the use of NPs as photosensitizer carriers to improve the actual topical drug distribution in malignant skin tissues. We present a mathematical model of PS distribution in tumor tissue using NPs that takes into account parameters related to nanoparticles binding. Once the concentration profile of NPs into tissue is obtained, we use a photochemical model which allows us to calculate the temporal evolution of reactive oxygen species according to PS distribution calculated previously from NPs profile.

Regulating the heterointerface between two catalyst components could effectively modulate the electronic structure and tune the electrocatalytic activity. Herein, a hybrid RuO2-NiO electrocatalyst on nickel foam was preparedviaa simple and easy industrial scale-up approach, which affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at low overpotentials of 18 mV for HER and 187 mV for OER, respectively. The electrolyzer assembled by the RuO2-NiO bifunctional electrode needs a cell voltage of only 1.43 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2)for the overall water splitting. Moreover, the electrolyzer achieved an outstanding activity and stability at high current densities, which needed a cell voltage of only 1.66 V to reach 500 mA cm(-2), and could perform continuous electrolysis for 2000 hours at 1000 mA cm(-2), thereby demonstrating a great potential for practical applications. Theoretical calculations revealed that the coupling of RuO(2)and NiO could greatly accelerate water dissociation and modulate the chemisorption of hydrogen and oxygen-containing intermediates on the catalyst, and consequently enhance the intrinsic activity towards both HER and OER.									15	2	0	0	2	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000572173300036

It usually uses air-sensitive phosphorus precursors such as n-trioctylphosphine or white phosphorus. In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of a remarkably stable tetrakis(acyl)cyclotetraphosphane, P-4(MesCO)(4). We demonstrate that this compound can be used as a stoichiometric source of P(0) species in order to synthesize FeP and Fe2P nanoparticles at only 250 degrees C. This tunable process provides a route to monodisperse nanoparticles with different compositions and crystallinities. We combine X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic pair distribution function (PDF) in order to study the local order and bonding in the amorphous and crystalline materials. We show that crystalline FeP forms via an intermediate amorphous phase (obtained at a lower temperature) that presents local order similar to that of the crystalline sample. From the results of this work, a better understanding of the mechanism of the formation of amorphous and crystalline FexP NPs is provided which relies on the use of a stoichiometric and single P-source. We then explore the electrocatalytic properties of FexP nanoparticles for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic and neutral electrolytes. In both electrolytes, amorphous FeP is a more efficient catalyst than crystalline FeP, itself more efficient than crystalline Fe2P. Our study paves the way for a more systematic investigation of amorphous metal phosphide phases in electrocatalysis. It also shows the beneficial properties of PDF on the characterization of such nanomaterials, which is highly challenging.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2199-692X			WOS:000533640600001

The numerically tracked detonation cells show that the cell size always adapts to the channel height such that the cell ratio is fairly independent of the grid sizes and initial and boundary conditions. During the structural evolution in a detonation cell, even as the simulated detonation wave characteristics suggest the presence of an ordinary detonation, the evolving instantaneous detonation state indicates a mainly underdriven state. As a considerable region of the gas mixture in a cell is observed to be ignited by the incident wave and transverse wave, it is further suggested that these two said waves play an essential role in the detonation propagation.					24th International Symposium on Shock Waves24th International Symposium on Shock Waves	JUL 11-16, 2004JUL 11-16, 2004	Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mech; Nat Sci Fdn China; Chinese Soc Shock Waves; Chinese Soc Theoret & Appl Mech; Chinese Soc AerodynamChinese Acad Sci, Inst Mech; Nat Sci Fdn China; Chinese Soc Shock Waves; Chinese Soc Theoret & Appl Mech; Chinese Soc Aerodynam	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINABeijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	27	3	0	0	0	0	30			0938-1287	1432-2153		WOS:000229628900006

The prepared NSCTs (NSCT-480 and NSCT-600) were characterized and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (DRUV-vis), and X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS). The OER activity and stability were measured by linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, amperometric i-t curve, and chronopotentiometry in a 1.0 mol/L NaOH solution at normal temperature and pressure. After 500 cycles, the lower overpotential (eta = 194 mV at 1 mA/cm(2)) indicated that NSCT-600 offered adequate performance as an OER electrocatalyst. Moreover, the changes observed with cyclic voltammetry, SEM, XRD, and XPS during the OER test revealed that the redox cycle of Ni2+/Ni3+, morphology, and crystal faces of NiO and SnO2 were three critical factors. The data proved that the NiO-SnO2 ceramic is a stable OER electrocatalyst. The results of this study will provide a guide for the design and fabrication of p-n heterojunction metal-oxide ceramic electrocatalysts with a high OER performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2470-1343			WOS:000570009400070	32923825

The composite coating shows excellent wear and corrosion resistance. In order to understand the phase evolution of the quaternary alloy during cooling and interpret its good glass forming ability, the stable phases in the as-melted ingot of the same composition were studied by X-Ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Thermodynamic calculation was performed based on a database compiled from literature. The calculated results show good agreement with the microstructural observation. It was found that Fe60Cr8Nb8B24 alloy lies very close to the eutectic point of the system, which is related to its high glass forming ability. The thermodynamic calculation could provide insightful understanding and guidance for the future amorphous composition designing in Fe-Cr-Nb-B quaternary system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It is clearly observed that the 2D-1D structural transformation of 2-4 has been realized by temperature modulated hydrothermal synthesis procedures from 120-160 degrees C, suggesting the key role of temperature for constructing MOFs. In addition, obvious pi-pi interactions between anthracene rings can be observed in the architectures of 1-3, which may favorably stabilize their 2D supramolecular networks. More importantly, fluorescence behaviors of 1-4 have been investigated in water among various nitro-aromatic compounds (NACs) and the results show that all samples exhibit high selectivity and fine sensitivity to nitrobenzene (NB) with fluorescence quenching, which is confirmed to be the result of electron transfer from the excited state of ligands to that of NB by density functional theory. Furthermore, MOFs 1-4 have been directly employed as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), in which MOF 4 gives the best activity towards the OER among all as-synthesized samples with an overpotential of 398 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1).									8	0	0	0	1	0	8				2046-2069		WOS:000496137600042	35528894

Hydrogen is the perfect candidate for renewable energy; however, H-2 gas production is associated with disadvantages due to a lack of efficient and active catalysts that could be cost-effective and comparable to platinum performance. Active hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts are needed to advance the development of a cheaper generation of solar fuels. Thus, outperformance, and stable earth abundant. And inexpensive catalysts are highly demanded. That is H-2 gas production from the electrolysis of water through HER. In this work, we present different analytical techniques that characterize an efficient and highly stable catalyst based on transition metal oxide Co3O4/MoS2 nanostructures. And their composites for water splitting in harsh acidic conditions time and material chemical composition as like SEM, EDS, XRD, HRTEM & XPS. The composite material is highly best to produce HER at 10 mA cm(-2) and obtained 268 mV overpotential of nano Co3O4/MoS2 (S3) and Tafel slope of 56 mv/dec. Faraday efficiencies of the hydrogen gas production measured for the 60 min and catalyst is highly durable for the 20 h. The presented catalysts are up to the mark of platinum metal performance and superior to several transition metal oxides. This fabrication technology is a new roadmap for developing active and scalable hydrogen-evolving catalysts by over-coming the issues of fewer catalytic edges, low density, and poor conductivity.

The key to this goal is the development of a wide spectral responsive, and efficient photocatalyst. To date, engineering band gap and crystal facet, constructing semiconductor heterostructures and loading cocatalysts were adopted to expand absorbance range and improve photocatalytic avtivity of semiconductors. In this paper, we have introduced the basic principles and reviewed the research advances of photocatalytic water splitting. The paper is focused on the challenges and bottlenecks in improving the photocatalytic activity of semiconductors, and some coping strategies are also proposed based on relative group's research.									10	9	0	0	0	0	14			1001-4861			WOS:000400954000001

Herein, we report an efficient ORR catalyst of bimetallic copper and cobalt fluoride heterojunctions, which are uniformly dispersed in nitrogen-fluorine-oxygen triply doped porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) that contain hierarchical macro-meso-micro pores. The composite catalyst materials are fabricated with a facile and green method of electrospinning with water as the solvent. By using poly(tetrafluoroethylene) as the pore inducer to anchor electro-positive copper and cobalt salts in the electrospun hybrid nanofibers, bimetallic fluoride heterojunctions can be directly formed in PCNFs after calcination. The hierachical porous structures provide an effective way to transport matter, while the bimetallic fluorides expose abundant electroactive sites, both of which result in stable ORR activities with a high half-wave potential of 0.84 V. The study proposes a feasible strategy for the fabrication of nonprecious catalysts.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000634766600036	33650875

In all instances, in individuals that contained as little as 10% or less of the transcripts of untransformed plants, the corresponding protein levels were not notably altered. This indicates that the mRNA levels for components under study are not rate-limiting for protein accumulation and that severely reduced amounts of these transcripts still allow normal plant development. Overexpression of the 23-kDa polypeptide by the corresponding cDNA integrated in sense orientation resulted in both higher mRNA and protein levels without detectable enhancement of oxygen evolution. At least some of the excess protein was found in the soluble fraction and not associated with the photosystem-II reaction center. An attempt has been made to reconcile the varied responses obtained using these approaches with different expression patterns.									23	0	0	0	23	0	23			0032-0935			WOS:A1993LE38600003	7763660

To date most efforts have focused on improving cathode catalysis, despite other components such as the anode (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) also being of key importance. Here, we report that the dihydrate form of IrO2 as the anode catalyst in alkaline media can achieve onset cell potentials as low as -1.55 V with a cathode overpotential of only 0.02 V, partial current densities for CO as high as 250 mA cm(-2) (compared to similar to 130 mA cm(-2) with a Pt anode), and energy efficiencies as high as 70%. The IrO2 non-hydrate proved to be much more durable by maintaining more than 90% of its activity after cycling the anode potential over the 0 to 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl range for over 200 times, whereas the dihydrate lost most of its activity after 19 cycles. Possible causes for these differences are discussed. This work shows that improvements to the anode, so to the OER, can drastically improve the prospects of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to useful chemicals. (c) 2014 The Electrochemical Society.

In the present work co-doped carbon materials have been developed from polymeric precursors with abundant active sites to achieve bifunctional activity. A 3-dimensional microporous nitrogen-carbon (NC) and co-doped nitrogen-sulfur-carbon (NSC) and nitrogen-phosphorus-carbon (NPC) were synthesized using poly(2,5-benzimidazole) as an N containing precursor. The obtained sheet like structure shows outstanding ORR and OER performance in alkaline systems with excellent stability compared to Pt/C catalyst. The doped heteroatom in the carbon is expected to have redistributed the charge around heteroatom dopants lowering the ORR potential and modifying the oxygen chemisorption mode thereby weakening the O-O bonding and improving the ORR activity and overall catalytic performance. The bifunctional activity (Delta E=E-j=10-E-1/2) of an air electrode for NPC, NSC, NC and Pt/C is 0.82 V, 0.87 V, 1.06 V and 1.03 V respectively, and the NPC value is smaller than most of the reported metal and non-metal based electrocatalysts. The ORR (from onset potential) and OER (10 mA cm(-2)) overpotential for NPC, NSC, and NC is (290 mV, 410 mV), (310 mV, 450 mV) and (340 mV, 600 mV) respectively. In the prepared catalyst the NPC exhibited higher ORR and OER activity (NPC > NSC > NC). The doping of P in NPC is found to have a great influence on the microstructure and therefore on the ORR and OER activity.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				2046-2069		WOS:000574586100038	35517101

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is dynamically slow, which limits energy conversion efficiency during the water-splitting process and requires high-efficiency water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) to overcome the OER energy barrier. It is generally accepted that multinuclear WOCs possess superior OER performances, as demonstrated by the CaMn4O5 cluster in photosystem II (PSII), which can catalyze the OER efficiently with a very low overpotential. Inspired by the CaMn4O5 cluster in PSII, some multinuclear WOCs were synthesized that could catalyze water oxidation. In addition, some mononuclear molecular WOCs also show high water oxidation activity. However, it cannot be excluded that the high activity arises from the formation of dimeric species. Recently, some mononuclear heterogeneous WOCs showed a high water oxidation activity, which testified that mononuclear active sites with suitable coordination surroundings could also catalyze water oxidation efficiently. This Review focuses on recent progress in the development of mono-/multinuclear homo- and heterogeneous catalysts for water oxidation. The active sites and possible catalytic mechanisms for water oxidation on the mono-/multinuclear WOCs are provided.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000478633900001	31077565

The atomic vacancy defects are introduced on the 2D ReS2 to realize high-density active sites, which significantly enhance the solar-driven hydrogen evolution reaction performance of ReS2/Si photocathode. The highest photocurrent density of 18.5 mA cm(-2) (at 0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) is achieved, under a simulated sun irradiation.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2196-7350			WOS:000458309700019

Identifying the Fe/Co occupancies at the octahedral (O-h) and tetrahedral (T-d) sites in the structure is the foundation for the understanding of the role of cobalt in each site and the exploration of further improvement in the OER activity. Here, we investigate the Fe/Co distribution in Ca2FeCoO5 by means of atomic-resolution energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in scanning transmission electron microscopy and dynamical image simulations combined with systematic density functional theory calculations. Our careful microscopic study reveals the absence of long-range Fe/Co order within the transition-metal (TM) layers, but cobalt is slightly enriched at the T-d and O-h sites in the as-synthesized (1100 degrees C) and 800 degrees C annealed for a month samples, respectively. The observed Co site preferences are interpretable from the viewpoints of TM ionic size effect and ligand field effect, which are competitive around a crossover point at a certain temperature between 800 and 1100 degrees C. We also elucidate that the as-synthesized sample with Co enrichment at the T-d site shows the better OER activity, and the optimum annealing temperature for more OER active Ca2FeCoO5 should be higher than the crossover temperature.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000480371400077	31294550

In this work, self-supported three-dimensional porous CoP3 nanospheres on carbon cloth (CoP3 NSs/CC) are fabricated via topotactic phosphidation of Co3O4 NSs/CC. The synthesized CoP3 NSs/CC, as a novel non-precious-metal electrocatalyst with large specific surface area and high porosity, exhibits efficient bifunctional electrocatalytic performance in alkaline medium, with Tafel slopes of 66 mV dec(-1) and 72 mV dec(-1), and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of -121 and 291 mV for HER and OER, respectively, which are remarkably superior to those of transition metal phosphides (TMPs). In addition, it just needs a cell voltage of 1.54 V to acquire a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting. The results of our work may shed light on the direction toward highly efficient bifunctional TMPs electrocatalysts with high phosphorous component. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we report single-atom Pt immobilized in the lattice of CoP mesoporous nanosheets (MNSs) grown on carbon fiber cloth (CFC) (Pt-at-CoP MNSs/CFC) with ultralow Pt loading (0.7 wt% relative to CoP, 5.89 mu g cm(geo)(-2)) as a high-performance electrocatalyst for the HER in alkaline solution. Assisted by the strong interaction between Pt(at)and CoP, water dissociation becomes spontaneous, providing Pt-at-CoP MNSs/CFC with a low HER kinetic barrier. Accordingly, Pt-at-CoP MNSs/CFC exhibits outstanding HER performance with negligible onset potential, super high catalytic activity, and excellent durability that is even superior to the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, Pt-at-CoP MNSs/CFC exhibits excellent catalytic activity and stability toward seawater electrolysis.									24	1	0	0	1	0	25			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000541615200013

However, the design and synthesis of well-dispersed metal clusters is a great challenge owing to their ease of aggregation. Here, we develop a biomassin situconversion strategy to synthesize Fe single atomic sites (Fe-N-4) combined with ultra-small Fe(2)O(3)nanoclusters embedded in N, S codoped porous carbons (Fe-SA/FeONC/NSC) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The resultant Fe-SA/FeONC/NSC exhibits a high half-wave potential (E-1/2= 0.86 Vvs.RHE) and an outstanding kinetic current density at 0.80 V (J(k)= 32.15 mA cm(-2)), which even surpasses those of commercial Pt/C (E-1/2= 0.85 V,J(k)= 16.5 mA cm(-2)). Atomic level dispersed Fe-N(4)sites integrated with Fe(2)O(3)clusters embedded in N, S-mediated carbon are mainly responsible for the excellent ORR activity. More importantly, the assembled Zn-air battery can output a prominent power density of 179.0 mW cm(-2)and energy density of 837.4 W h kg(-1)along with robust stability, outperforming the commercial Pt/C and most non-platinum catalysts. This work opens up an avenue for biomassin situconversion into non-precious metal electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage technologies.									32	5	0	0	2	0	31			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000578872600035

However, how to realize molecular regulation of the MOF structure to achieve a remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst is still a challenge. Herein, we designed several series of special MOF materials to explore the relationship between the structure and properties as well as the related reactive mechanism. First, various metal centers, including Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, and Mg, were utilized to construct the first series of trimetallic MOF materials, namely, M-3- MOF-BDC, where BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, also known as terephthalic acid. Among of them, Fe-3-MOF-BDC shows the best OER performance and only needs an overpotential of 312 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Then, functional BDC-X ligands (X = NH2, OH, NO2, DH) with various characteristic groups were selected to construct a new series, namely, Fe-3-MOF-BDC-X, to further improve its OER electrocatalytic performance. As expected, Fe-3-MOF-BDC-NH2 exhibited a greatly enhanced OER performance with ultralow Tafel slopes of 45 mV dec(-1) and overpotentials of 280 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) when the BDC-NH2 ligand was adopted, even superior to commercial IrO2 (323 mV) and most of the reported pristine MOFs as OER electrodes. Much higher structural stability was proven. The detailed structure-property relationship and mechanism are discussed. In a word, this work provides a very important theoretical basis for the design and exploration of new MOF electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000823560200001	35772081

This method uses the polymerized complex reaction to prepare a precursor oxide (e.g., Bi3TaO7), which is subsequently calcined with BiOCl to yield a pure Bi4TaO8Cl phase with smaller particle sizes than those obtained via a conventional single-step solid-state reaction (1SSR). Furthermore, time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements revealed that the Bi4TaO8Cl sample prepared by the 2PC method at 973 K (2PC_973) achieved more than five times longer-lived charge separation than that by the 1SSR at 973 K (1SSR_973), which probably arises from lower numbers of charge-recombination centers produced in the 2PC synthesis. Thus, the synthesized Bi4TaO8Cl samples exhibited a higher rate of O-2 evolution (e.g., 20 mu mol h(-1) for 2PC_973 vs. 4 mu mol h(-1) for 1SSR_973). Overall water splitting into stoichiometric H-2 and O-2 was demonstrated by constructing a Z-scheme photocatalytic system consisting of 2PC_973, Ru-modified SrTiO3:Rh, and an Fe3+/Fe2+ shuttle redox mediator, with an external quantum efficiency of 0.9% at 420 nm, which was much higher than that using the sample derived from the optimized 1SSR method at 1173 K (0.4%). The 2PC synthesis was successfully extended to other Sillen-Aurivillius type oxychlorides, Bi4NbO8Cl, Bi6NbWO14Cl and Sr2Bi3Ta2O11Cl, all of which exhibited superior water splitting activity compared to those prepared through the 1SSR.									38	1	0	0	5	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000439389100032

However, the efficient implementation of MoP for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been hindered by the limited number of active centers and the weakening electron transferring rate resulting from poor conductivity and easy accumu-lation during preparation. Herein, we innovate the use of porous poly(ionic liquid)s (MPILs)-loaded phos-phomolybdic acid by ion exchange to achieve porous N, P-codoped carbon-encapsulated ultrafine MoP (MoP@NPC). The electronic structure of MoP can be modulated with the carbon matrix, while ultrafine average size of 3 nm nanoparticles afford highly exposed active sites, thus contributing to the boosted electrocatalytic performance of HER. Besides, N, P-codoped carbon coupling with porous structure could facilitate electron transport and shorten the ion transport distance during the electrochemical process. In alkaline media, the optimized MoP@NPC shows small overpotentials of 134 mV with Tafel slopes of 76 mV dec-1 for HER. In addition, excellent electrocatalysis stability has been acquired by MoP@NPC. The in-situ Raman and ex-situ XPS techniques are applied to confirm the superior electrocatalytic HER property of the obtained MoP@NPC. This work provides a new way to prepare a novel Mo-based electrocatalyst by ex-ploiting a special catalyst precursor for hydrogen-energy-related applications.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The O-2 evolution current efficiency was largely improved for the multi-component electrode over the Nafion-RuO2 and Nafion-Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) individuals. The redox mediation through the Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) was found to dominate over the RuO2 catalytic effect in the water oxidation mechanism. The specific surface area of the RuO2, which was prepared at different temperatures (300-700 degrees C), used in fabricating the composite electrode also played an important role in the overall water oxidation mechanism. Both the reaction and electrode parameters were optimized to get effective electrocatalytic current values in this study. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here, graphene oxide guiding nickel and iron layered double hydroxides hybrid arrays (GO-FeNi-LDH) are firstly fabricated by one-step electro-deposition method. The pretty 3D arrays with sheets vertically growing on nickel foam (NF) are highlighted by controlling the quantity of GO. Furthermore, the electron transfer from Ni, Fe to graphene is detected, making the metals and graphene in high valence and electron-rich state, respectively. The optimal GO-FeNi-LDH presents pretty morphology, defects, electron interactions and good conductivity. Therefore, to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), it requires the overpotentials of 119, 210, 285 and 303 mV for HER and OER and excellent durability. Noticeably, the optimal GO-NiFe-LDH needs a cell voltage of 1.48 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2) for the whole water splitting, which are lower than that of most of advanced electrocatalysts, endowing it in first-rank electrocatalyst.

Herein, an advanced class of ultralow Ru-doped NiCo-MOF hollow porous nanospheres (denoted as Ru@NiCo-MOF HPNs) has been reported in this work. Benefiting from the high porosity and large surface area of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and optimized electronic properties by Ru doping, the as-prepared Ru@NiCo-MOF HPNs exhibit superior performance for water oxidation with the overpotential of only 284 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte, as well as a small Tafel slope of 78.8 mV.dec(-1), outperforming the NiCo-MOF HPNs (358 mV) and commercial RuO2 catalyst (326 mV). The incorporation of Ru in NiCo-MOF HPNs enables a stable OER activity for at least 39 h. Moreover, we have probed the interaction between the content of Ru and OER performance, impressively, Ru@NiCo-MOF HPNs with 13.5 atom % Ru doping (denoted as Ru@NiCo-MOF-4) exhibited the highest OER activity with the excellent mass activity of 310 mA.mg(-1) at an overpotential of 284 mV. Besides, a two-electrode cell with Ru@NiCo-MOF-4 as the anode and commercial Pt/C catalyst as the cathode also demonstrated outstanding electrocatalytic overall water splitting performance with a cell potential of merely 1.57 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2).									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000642344900049	33797226

The Ti/PbO2-Bi-PTh electrode was characterized by XRD, SEM, AFM, LSV, CV and EIS. Results showd that the electrode has a fine and compact surface structure, higher oxygen evolution potential (OEP, 2.42 V) and low charge transfer resistance (51.00 omega). The electrode also exhibited excellent electrochemical oxidation activity on the degradation of phenol (1000 mg l(-1)) with degradation efficiency of 100% and TOC removal rate of 93.58% achieved in 60 min and 180 min, respectively. In addition, possible mechanism of phenol degradation on the electrode was proposed by analyzing the intermediate products with GC-MS. Noticeably, the Ti/PbO2-Bi-PTh electrode displayed excellent stability and high electrocatalytic performance after 10 cycles, indicating its promising application in the phenolic wastewater treatment.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000593476900001

A novel structural evolution from a hexagonal bipyramid to a bipyramidal hexagonal prism was clearly observed. This evolution was gradual and could be well reflected by the height ratio of the prism and pyramid in these polyhedral structures. It is the relative concentration of beta-CD that drives this structural evolution. Although the reaction temperature and time can also affect the height ratio to some extent, their influence can only be realized in the presence of beta-CD. In the absence of beta-CD, only hexagonal bipyramid structures were obtained. It is worth noting that Fe-MOF-1 with a bipyramidal hexagonal prism structure (prism height, similar to 130 nm) showed typical paramagnetic characteristics, and its saturation magnetization was determined to be 23.1 emu.g(-1). Furthermore, we found that Fe-MOF-1 exhibited good photocatalytic performance for different types of dyes (crystal violet with positives and methyl orange with negative charges). At the same time, a possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed to explain the difference of degradation efficiency between the two dyes. Also, we use the combination of specific surface area and zeta potential to explain the differences in the catalytic properties of a series of Fe-MOF materials. In addition, MOF-1 shows the same electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction performance as some bimetallic MOFs such as Fe-Co-MOF. For example, the overpotential of MOF-1 is 398 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) current density, while that of Fe-Co-MOF is 410 mV. We believe that the current work can contribute to the adjustment, modification, and application of MOF nanostructures.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000730558800001

Based on a concise theoretical model, we predict that the surface of a quaternary HEA of base metals, CoCrFeNi, should go from being nearly fully oxidized except for pure Ni sites when exposed to O-2 to being partially oxidized in an acidic solution under cathodic bias, and that such a partially oxidized surface should be more active for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic solutions than all the component metals. These predictions are confirmed by electrochemical and surface science experiments: the Ni in the HEA is found to be most resistant to oxidation, and when deployed in 0.5 M H2SO4, the HEA exhibits an overpotential of only 60 mV relative to Pt for the HER at a current density of 1 mA/cm(2).									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000685650400013	34476039

Through the self-assembly of dopamine, triblock copolymer F127, and metal ions, different three-dimensional atomic metal-N/S doped carbon catalysts are obtained after pyrolysis. Noble metal salts with ferrous sulfate induce the bimetallic monatomic FeM (M = Pd, Pt) N, S-doped carbon catalysts. Minute amounts of Pt or Pd single atoms in the catalysts greatly improve the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity both in acidic and alkaline conditions. Typically, the obtained Fe, Pt-N/S co-doped carbon (FePt-NSC) catalyst exhibits superior ORR performance with positive half-wave potentials (E-1/2) of 0.89 and 0.80 V in alkaline and acidic solutions, respectively. In addition, FePt-NSC displays dominant four electron catalytic process and excellent electrocatalytic stability. The high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC) test (160 degrees C) illustrates that FePt-NSC reaches 0.67 V at 400 mA/cm(2) and achieves the peak power density of 628 mW/cm(2), better than most of the catalysts reported at the similar conditions. These results indicate the atomic metal-N/S doped porous carbon catalysts to be highly promising low-Pt catalysts for HT-PEMFC. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Although previous studies have revealed that the surface properties of materials affect the catalytic reactivity, the effects of a catalytic surface on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the molecular level are still not well understood. Contrary to general belief, water molecules do not adsorb onto the surfaces of 3C-SiC nanocrystals (NCs), but rather spontaneously dissociate via a surface autocatalytic process forming a complex consisting of -H and -OH fragments. In this study, we show that ultrathin 3C-SiC NCs possess superior electrocatalytic activity in the HER. This arises from the large reduction in the activation barrier on the NC surface enabling efficient dissociation of H2O molecules. Furthermore, the ultrathin 3C-SiC NCs show enhanced HER activity in photoelectrochemical cells and are very promising to the water splitting based on the synergistic electrocatalytic and photoelectrochemical actions. This study provides a molecular-level understanding of the HER mechanism and reveals that NCs with surface autocatalytic effects can be used to split water with high efficiency thereby enabling renewable and economical production of hydrogen.									93	4	0	0	3	0	95			1530-6984			WOS:000301406800073	22385070

And then plasma-assisted-phosphorization is employed to obtain homogeneous nickel phosphide (Ni12P5) and zinc phosphide (ZnP2) heterojunction nano particles (NPs) distributed over the surface of MoS2 nanosheets (P-Ni/MoS2@Ni12P5/ZnP2). The MoS2 nano sheets growing on 3D NF framework benefits the increase of the electrochemically active specific surface, and the uniform distribution of heterojunction Ni12P5/ZnP(2 )NPs exposes more catalytic active sites. Moreover, the heterojunction Ni12P5/ZnP2 NPs obtained by plasma-assisted-phosphorization has smaller size and stronger electronic coupling than that synthesized by the conventional thermal phosphorization (C-Ni/MoS2@Ni12P5/ZnP2 ). Therefore, the as-synthesized P-Ni/MoS2@Ni12P5/ZnP2 shows an excellent bifunctionality catalytic activity for both HER and OER in alkaline solutions, which is highlighted by the overpotential at 82 mV for delivering current density of 10 mA cm(-2 )for HER and 360 mV for delivering 100 mA cm(-2 )for OER. P-Ni/MoS2@Ni12P5/ZnP(2 )exhibits higher electrocatalytic performance and better stability than most previously reported bifunctional catalysts. Furthermore, the catalytic current density of P-Ni/MoS2@Ni12P5/ZnP2 as a bifunctional catalyst assembled single two-electrode-electrolyzer rapidly exceeded 50 mA cm(-2 )at a low cell voltage of 1.62 V, surpassing the commercial RuO2-Pt/C coupled electrolyzer.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000806149300003

The HPA features a three-dimensional (3D) continuous network of 1D holey microfibers assembled from 2D nanomesh. The collaborative engineering of the D-A homojunction and 3D hierarchical open-pore nanoarchitecture in HPA causes a narrowed bandgap, improved hydrophilicity, and dramatically increased charge transfer and separation, and therefore the synthesis of sub-1 nm ultrafine Pt cocatalysts associated with countless bonding sites. It exhibits a high H-2 evolution rate of 103.79 mu mol h(-1) (12 times higher than that of the conventional g-C3N4 powder), and an excellent internal quantum yield of 29.4% at 400 nm, much higher than those of most of the aerogel-based photocatalysts reported.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000635284900051

As active sites, molecular water oxidation cocatalysts show increasing attraction and application possibility. In order to compare the advantages between molecular catalysts with non-noble and noble metals, the loading of the Fe(salen) and Ru(salen) as cocatalyst precursors on the surface of Ti-Fe2O3 was investigated Quasi-Fe(salen) and Ru(salen) improved the photocurrent density by 1.5 and 1.7 times compared to that of the original Ti-Fe2O3 photoanode, respectively. The quasi-Fe(salen) could improve the conductivity and reaction kinetics on the photoanode surface. By contrast, the notable advancements could be attributed to more reaction sites for quasi-Ru(salen) as cocatalysts. Thus, non-noble quasi-Fe(salen) is a promising cocatalyst to replace the noble metal salen, and further optimization can be expected with regard to the precise control of reaction sites.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000642320800001	33780153

Although many studies have been devoted to the synthesis of WN-based materials, the range of materials that can be made is mainly limited to the common cubic beta-WN. Herein, we developed a beta-to delta phase transformation approach by introducing a second transition-metal as a general synthetic method to prepare hexagonal delta-WN and its composites. delta-WN was successfully achieved by introducing Co, Ni or Fe from metal-organic frameworks into tungsten precursors. EXAFS and XRD results confirmed the phase transformation from beta-WN to delta-WN promoted by metallic Co. The delta-WN exhibited superior performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared to beta-WN, i.e. 23-fold increase in TOF. The incorporation of Co into delta-WN further increased its activity; for example, delta-WN/Co-2.45 only( )required 76 mV overpotential to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). XPS analysis and density functional theory calculations revealed that the enhanced activity was due to the synergistic effect between Co and delta-WN which optimized the free energy of hydrogen adsorption and therefore was beneficial to the HER process. Ni and Fe could also induce the formation of delta-NW, and the as-prepared delta-WN/Ni and delta-WN/Fe both demonstrated satisfactory catalytic activity towards the HER. More importantly, the preparation method introduced in this work may be extended to other metal nitrides or carbides which couldn't be synthesized previously for a variety of potential applications.									41	2	0	0	2	0	41			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000439389100039

The resultant anodic film contained fluoride species and was rather soluble even in de-ionized water. The heat treatment in an argon atmosphere at and above 673 K converted a poorly crystalline anodic film to a crystalline film with a (FeNi)(3)O-4 spinel phase with the nanoporous morphology remaining unchanged. The activity of the heattreated specimens for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was examined and the results were compared with the anodized iron specimens after heat treatment. The Fe-Ni alloy specimen heattreated at optimized temperature showed the improved activity in comparison with the corresponding iron specimen. Anodizing is promising to form a highly porous electrode directly on metal substrate.

Using Ti-based metallic glassy powders as Ti and Zr source, the synthesized Na-2(Ti0.85Zr0.15)(4)O-9 and H-2(Ti0.85Zr0.15)(4)O-9 nanobelts show much higher photocatalytic activity than H2Ti4O9 nanobelts under UV irradiation. According to experimental results and first-principle calculations, the effect of Zr-doping on the band structure of these semiconductors was also investigated. The results show that Zr 4d orbitals played an effective role on both the valence and the conduction bands, which contributes to the enhanced photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the H-2 evolution property is determined to be dominated by the synergetic influence of the thermodynamic driving force (band structure and H+ reduction potential) and the active reaction sites.

Thus, triplet PSs showing a strong visible-light-harvesting ability and long triplet excited state lifetimes are desired because they can enhance the above intermolecular processes. The conventional transition metal complexes (i.e., Ru(bpy)(3)X-2 or Ir(ppy)(3)) have been widely used; however, these complexes are not satisfactory due to their weak absorption of visible light and short triplet excited state lifetimes. To a large extent, the photophysical property of these complexes is due to the low-lying metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) state, the S-0 -> (MLCT)-M-1 transition is weakly allowed, and a strong heavy atom effect exists for the (MLCT)-M-3 state, which results in weak visible light absorption and a short triplet excited state lifetime, respectively. This mini review introduces the recent progress of the development of the transition metal complexes as well as the organic triplet PSs that show a strong visible-light-harvesting ability and long triplet excited state lifetimes. The application of these new triplet PSs in photocatalytic H-2 evolution and photoredox catalytic synthetic organic reactions is summarized.									11	0	0	0	1	0	10			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000750883400009

However, owing to the greater convenience of chemical energy storage, such as H-2, compared to electricity, solar fuels have been considered as one of the most promising technological concepts due to their potential higher efficiency and environmental suitability.In this context, the photocatalytic water splitting into O-2 and solar fuels (e.g. H-2) is a topic of current interest. Furthermore, the development of photocatalysts that can utilize the whole electromagnetic spectrum is preferable in order to enhance the overall water splitting efficiency. Direct photocatalytic water splitting is a challenging problem because the water oxidation (WO) reaction is thermodynamically uphill. Hence, several WO photocatalysts have been developed and assessed over the last few decades, and it has been reported that BiVO4 is one of the most active O-2 evolution photocatalysts.In this review, a first introduction regarding the solar fuel production and the water oxidation reaction is reported. Subsequently, the crystal and electronic structures as well as the optical properties that are closely related to the photoelectrochemical properties of BiVO4 are described. Finally, the monoclinic BiVO4 synthesis methods and the optimization methods to improve the performances of BiVO4 are discussed. The information gained from this analysis contributes to the better understanding of the main parameters affecting the activity and will ultimately lead to the optimized synthesis of a more efficient BiVO4 photocatalytic material.

J	Holden, P; Woolfson, MM								A theory of local formation of isotopic anomalies in meteorites								EARTH MOON AND PLANETS				69	3			201	236		10.1007/BF00643785				1995	1995	The consequences of a postulated collision between planets in the early solar system have been investigated. At least one of the planets has been taken with a D/H ratio similar to that of Venus (0.016) and the temperature of the collision interface (similar to 3 X 10(6) K) triggers chain reactions in near-surface material beginning with D-D reactions. The initial composition of the reacting material is consistent with a silicate + ices surface and a hydrogen-helium inert gas atmosphere. The reaction chain contains 284 reactions, plus reverse reactions, and 40 radioactive decay processes. When the pressure in the reacting region is sufficiently high the colliding planets are blown apart and the highly-processed material at the heart of the explosion mixes with less processed and unprocessed material from cooler parts of the system. Mixtures of materials are found to explain isotopic anomalies associated with oxygen, magnesium, neon, silicon, carbon and nitrogen. The local production of isotopic anomalies avoids the problems associated with other suggested explanations - in particular the observation of neon E, almost pure Ne-22, assumed as the product of the decay of Na-22 with a half-life of 2.6 years.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0167-9295			WOS:A1995TM68100001

Over the past century, however, the development of new agricultural practices to satisfy a growing global demand for food has drastically disrupted the nitrogen cycle. This has led to extensive eutrophication of fresh waters and coastal zones as well as increased inventories of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Microbial processes will ultimately restore balance to the nitrogen cycle, but the damage done by humans to the nitrogen economy of the planet will persist for decades, possibly centuries, if active intervention and careful management strategies are not initiated.									1334	129	0	0	828	4	1434			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000282644600032	20929768

The high cost of Pt-based catalysts is a significant limitation to large-scale H-2 generation. Strategies for the preparation of low-cost and stable electrocatalysts are essential for future H2 generation. Methods: In this study, we prepared RuO2 particles decorated on phosphate-doped reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layer for superior electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and supercapacitor performance. Composite materials are characterized using various techniques such as XRD for crystalline nature, FE-SEM and EDX, HR-TEM for morphology, elemental composition, lattice structure, XPS for elemental composition and oxidation states and BET for specific surface area. Significant findings: The RuO2-P-rGO electrocatalyst had a low overpotential and the lowest Tafel slope, sug-gesting that the HER (43 mV) and OER (194 mV) performance was excellent. The structural properties of RuO2-P-rGO contributed to its enhanced stability in long-term HER and OER analyses. The electrochemical efficiency of the RuO2-P-rGO composite was analyzed in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Enhanced electrochemical supercapacitor performance was achieved for the RuO2-P-rGO material, with a maximum specific capacitance of 606 F g(-1). RuO2-P-rGO achieved maximum capacitance higher than that of the bare electrodes, which indicates the rela-tively high active surface area of the RuO2-P-rGO electrocatalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1876-1070	1876-1089		WOS:000835190600003

Attempts to exploit these catalysts in engineered systems have been hindered by the biotechnologically inconvenient properties of the natural enzymes, including their extreme oxygen sensitivity. Directed evolution has been used to improve the characteristics of a range of natural catalysts, but has been largely unsuccessful for [FeFe] hydrogenases because of a lack of convenient screening platforms.Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we describe an in vitro screening technology for oxygen-tolerant and highly active [FeFe] hydrogenases. Despite the complexity of the protocol, we demonstrate a level of reproducibility that allows moderately improved mutants to be isolated. We have used the platform to identify a mutant of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [FeFe] hydrogenase HydA1 with a specific activity similar to 4 times that of the wild-type enzyme.Conclusions/Significance: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using the screen presented here for large-scale efforts to identify improved biocatalysts for energy applications. The system is based on our ability to activate these complex enzymes in E. coli cell extracts, which allows unhindered access to the protein maturation and assay environment.									36	0	0	0	24	0	38			1932-6203			WOS:000277467900010	20479937	
J	Marks, PB; Sarna, MJ								The chemical evolution of the secondary stars in close binaries, arising from common-envelope evolution and nova outbursts								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				301	3			699	720		10.1046/j.1365-8711.1998.02039.x				DEC 11 1998	1998	Using a Paczynski-type stellar evolution code, we have modelled the evolution of secondary stars through the common-envelope and semidetached phases of close binary evolution. Our calculations are aimed at determining the effects of the accretion of red giant envelope material during the common-envelope phase, and the accretion of novae ejecta during the semidetached phase, on the surface composition of the secondary. For the second case, we make use of the results of the calculations of Prialnik & Kovetz, Kovetz & Prialnik and Prialnik, which concern the effects of accretion on to carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with varying white dwarf mass, white dwarf central temperature and mass transfer rate (the defining characteristics of nova outburst behaviour).In this paper we present the results of our calculations of a large grid of models designed to test the effects of these two polluting processes, both individually and together. We find that both processes may significantly affect the surface composition of the secondary, and that in the case of the accretion of novae ejecta, thermohaline mixing is extremely important and cannot be neglected. Our results indicate four phases in the evolution of the surface composition of the secondary during semidetached evolution: (i) the material accreted during the common-envelope phase and that accreted from the novae ejecta are mixed by convection and thermohaline mixing and dominate the surface composition of the secondary; (ii) the material accreted during common-envelope evolution is lost through mass transfer and the surface composition of the secondary is dominated by material accreted from the novae ejecta, which is mixed with the underlying layers of the secondary by convection and thermohaline mixing; (iii) the surface convection zone of the secondary penetrates to deeper layers so that these deeper layers dominate the surface composition of the secondary and thermohaline mixing no longer operates; and (iv) for evolved Population I systems, when the secondary has lost most of its mass, its surface composition is again dominated by material accreted from novae ejecta.We make predictions concerning the abundances of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen and the values of the isotopic ratios C-12/C-13, N-14/N-15 and O-16/O-17 on the surface of the secondary throughout its evolution. With observationally determined abundances and isotopic ratios, we can in principle determine whether or not these two polluting processes operate, and can further differentiate between them.									44	0	0	0	0	0	44			0035-8711			WOS:000077716100006

We model two geometrical aspects of the Au particles, the low index facets of the Au particles, and the Au-MgO interface boundary. The precise structure of the interface boundary depends on the size of the Au particles, and different models with either small or large Au-MgO contact angles are introduced. For all Au systems, we find that the CO oxidation reaction proceeds via CO adsorption, trapping of O-2, leading to the formation of a metastable CO.O-2 reaction intermediate, which dissociates into CO2 and adsorbed atomic oxygen. The atomic oxygen reacts directly with gas phase CO. No separate O-2 molecular or dissociative adsorption is found to be favorable. Important differences were found in the reactivity of the various Au-MgO interface boundaries. This is explained in terms of two properties: the Au-Au coordination determining the local reactivity of the Au atoms and the presence of the MgO support that, besides providing excess electrons to the Au clusters, forms ionic bonds to the peroxo part of the CO.O-2 reaction intermediate. We find that the type of interface boundary likely to be predominant for medium-sized nanoparticles provides the optimal degree of low-coordinated Au atoms in the neighborhood of the MgO support. Our DFT study therefore provides a rational for why the reactivity per site may reach a maximum at a critical particle size as has been observed experimentally for similar systems.									221	4	0	0	7	1	221			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000221426800128

Herein, a novel and effective approach is developed for synthesizing ultrafine Co nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) grafted onto both sides of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (Co@N-CNTs@rGO) by direct annealing of GO-wrapped core-shell bimetallic zeolite imidazolate frameworks. Benefiting from the uniform distribution of Co nanoparticles, the in-situ-formed highly graphitic N-CNTs@rGO, the large surface area, and the abundant porosity, the as-fabricated Co@N-CNTs@rGO composites exhibit excellent electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. As demonstrated in electrochemical measurements, the composites can achieve 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotential with only 108 and 87 mV in 1 m KOH and 0.5 m H2SO4, respectively, much better than most of the reported Co-based electrocatalysts over a wide pH range. More importantly, the synthetic strategy is versatile and can be extended to prepare other binary or even ternary TMs@N-CNTs@rGO (e.g., Co-Fe@N-CNTs@rGO and Co-Ni-Cu@N-CNTs@rGO). The strategy developed here may open a new avenue toward the development of nonprecious high-performance HER catalysts.									403	25	0	0	16	0	406			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000439737700031	29888482

A two-dimensional representation delimiting boundaries of the instability region and depending on both mass flows is proposed for RF and DC polarisation of the titanium target. This diagram allows to determine operating conditions favourable to deposit oxynitride coatings with a modulated oxygen or nitrogen composition. It is also shown that the supply of one reactive gas affects consumption and behaviours of the other gas as well as its own characteristics. A critical region is then defined in which the process is trapped in reactive mode and cannot go back to elemental conditions by changing mass flow rate of only one reactive gas. Kinetics and pollution of the titanium surface is discussed from measurements of DC potential for various operating points. It is shown that comportments of oxygen and nitrogen towards metallic or poisoned target are interdependent and a surprising evolution of the time of pollution against oxygen and nitrogen introduction is observed.

ZnIn2S4 with an asymmetrical layered structure of [S-In]-[S-In-S]-[Zn-S] unit cell is a promising material offering asymmetrical crystal polarization to overcome the limitation; however, the polarization-induced internal electric field by this material remains largely unexplored. Herein, the polarization-induced internal electric field of ZnIn2S4 by engineering the polarity intensity in microscopic units is demonstrated for the first time. Specifically, ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets are employed to establish a Ni12P5/ZnIn2S4-O (NP/ZIS-O) system with powerful bulk and interface cascade electric field by the oxygen doping and ohmic junction. Enabled by such a design, the photogenerated electrons can rapidly migrate to NP active sites, suppressing the photogenerated electron-hole pair recombination on ZIS-O. To further overcome the inefficient hole transfer in oxidation half-reaction, the preferential dehydrogenation of the alpha-C-H bond in benzyl alcohol is utilized as a vehicle to facilitate hole transfer. As a result, a remarkably enhanced H-2 generation of 15.79 mmol g(-1) h(-1) is achieved on NP/ZIS-O, which is 8.16-fold higher than that of pristine ZnIn2S4. Meanwhile, as a value-added oxidation product, benzaldehyde can be produced at the rate of 17.63 mmol g(-1) h(-1). This work presents a collaborative strategy for engineering charge behavior in photocatalysts with polarization features, and provides insights into materials design toward photocatalytic hydrogen production and organic synthesis from the angle of charge kinetics.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000814403500001		
J	Fitzpatrick, B. W. N.; Davis, J. W.; Haasz, A. A.								Thermo-oxidation of laboratory-produced undoped and W-doped carbon films: A reaction product analysis								NUCLEAR MATERIALS AND ENERGY				12		SI		736	743		10.1016/j.nme.2017.04.011				AUG 2017	2017	Thermo-oxidation is a technique where O-2 gas is used to remove carbon co-deposits at elevated temperatures from plasma-facing materials of fusion devices. Following thermo-oxidation, the reaction products produced will need to be managed by a reactor's gas-handling system, including the tritium plant. Thus, it is important to know what molecular species are produced during oxidation. The reaction products of thermo-oxidation have previously been studied for undoped films indicating CO, CO2 and D2O as the reaction products. The present study directly compares the reaction product evolution of undoped films to that of films doped with tungsten.A glow discharge was used to produce sets of undoped and W-doped films on stainless steel (SS) foil substrates. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) found the W-doped films to contain an average 0.1 at.% W/(W+C). Laser thermal desorption spectroscopy (LTDS) was used to measure the areal Dconcentration. Reaction products during oxidation were measured using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). Both the undoped and W-doped specimens were oxidized in 2 Torr O-2, at 350 degrees C for 4 h, total. LTDS was then used to determine how much D had been removed during oxidation (93% and 32% of the D was removed after oxidation for the undoped and W-doped cases respectively). The reduced D loss for the W-doped specimens is attributed to a change in film structure due to the incorporation of W in the film. Oxidation reaction products for both undoped and W-doped films include CO, CO2, and D2O, with no finding of D-2 or CD4 within experimental uncertainty. Particle accounting was performed for oxygen, deuterium and carbon atoms. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2352-1791		WOS:000417293300120

Herein, N/S co-doped C encapsulated hollow NiCo2O4/NiO hexagonal rods (HNHR@N/S-C) as the electrocatalysts for OER have been successfully prepared with rational control of structure and composition. Experimental and theoretical results have highlighted that the NiCo2O4 /NiO heterojunction in the obtained electrocatalyst can provide abundant active Ni and Co sites for the OER, leading to the highly enhanced OER performance. Moreover, attributed to the hierarchical hollow structure, which can provide a large surface area, and the improved electric conductivity with a coating of the N/S co-doped carbon layer, which can facilitate charge transport during the catalytic processes, a remarkable OER activity over HNHR@N/S-C with a low overpotential (eta) of 285 mV (at j = 10 mA cm(-2)) and a Tafel slope of 53.0 mV decade(-1) has been achieved, which is comparable to that of the noble metal catalyst IrO2. Because of the protection of the N/S doped C layer coating, HNHR@N/S-C can also maintain the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for at least 12 h in alkaline media without obvious losses of activity.									15	1	0	0	1	0	16			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000526414000076	32096626

An electrochemical investigation of alpha-PbO2 deposition process on the Pb-0.3%Ag alloy substrates, using anodic polarization technique, galvanostatic polarization technique and steady state polarization technique, has been carried out. The phase composition and surface microstructures of alpha-PbO2 layers in different synthesizing times were tested by means of XRD and SEM, respectively. The experimental data have shown that the process of alpha-PbO2 formation on Pb-0.3%Ag alloy substrates have several stages. The optimized conditions can be effectively improving the formation rate of alpha-PbO2 and avoid the occurrence of oxygen evolution reaction. The alpha-PbO2 deposition layer obtained in alkaline solution possesses compact structure, and it is composed of well developed spherical grains.

Herein, we have synthesized two cobalt metal-organic frameworks (Co-MOFs) with the formulas [C6H6CoN2O4] (compound 1) and [C12H10CoN2O4] (compound 2) using pyrazine and 4,4'-bipyridine as linkers in dimethylformamide medium by a solvothermal method. Both Co-MOFs shows strong antiferromagnetic interactions with Theta(p) = -70 and -61 K for compounds 1 and 2, respectively. The in situ transformation of both compounds catalyzes the OER efficiently in alkaline medium, affording a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at overpotentials of 276 +/- 3 and 302 +/- 3 mV by compounds 1 and 2, respectively. Moreover, compound 1 shows a very high turnover frequency (15.087 s(-1)), lower Tafel slope (56 mV/dec), and greater Faradaic efficiency of 95.42% in comparison to compound 2. The transformations of the Co-MOFs have been accessed by employing powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which reveal the formation of uniform hexagonal Co(OH)(2) plates. Therefore, the as-developed Co-MOF is found to be an efficient pre-electrocatalyst for the OER in alkaline medium. These results not only reveal the preparation of OER electrocatalysts from a Co-MOF but also establish a method to derive a potentially active electrocatalyst to substitute for the traditional noble-metal-based materials.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000570979900045	32845136

XPS, XRD, TEM and anodic polarization curve techniques were used to characterize the composition, size, distribution and morphology of the catalyst. The results indicate that TiN were converted to TiO2 rutile-type phase at 350 degrees C and Ir presented as multi-value oxides. TiO2 and IrOx formed a binary solid solution in a rutile phase. A great number of Ir particles with an average crystal size of about 5-10 nm were rich on the surface of the solid solution. After annealing at 500 degrees C for 1 h, a partly sintening of the oxides could be observed and part of Ir was separated from the solid solution. The polarization curves measured in 0. 5 mol/L H2SO4 also proved the high-temperature treatment would reduce the activity but beneficial to stability. The catalyst samples annealed at 500 degrees C were achieved. The electrolytic voltage was 1. 6 V at 1 A/cm(2) and 80 degrees C with Ir loading of only 1. 2 mg/cm(2) These results suggest that this new method is an efficient wa Ito.synthesize noble metal oxides catalyst with a high activity and low cost for water electrolysis.									7	7	0	0	0	0	9			0251-0790			WOS:000246787400026

Therefore, we synthesized a novel hollow CoO/Co4S3@CoO/Co4S3 heterojunction with a core- shell structure as an excellent dual-functional catalyst. This sample is composed of an outer hollow CoO/Co(4)S(3 )cubic thin shell and an inner hollow CoO/Co4S3 sphere, and it can provide abundant catalytic active sites while effectively promoting the flow of reactants, products, and electrolytes. Meanwhile, the O-Co-S bond in the heterojunction interface can promote both the CoO active site in OER and theCo(4)S(3) active site in HER. Therefore, the overpotential of the hollow CoO/Co4S3@CoO/Co(4)S(3 )is only 190 mV (OER) and 81 mV (HER), respectively, at the current density of 10 mA cm-2. Moreover, the hollow CoO/Co4S3@CoO/Co4S3 showed the outstanding electrochemical stability in 60 h. In addition, in the two-electrode system assembled from the hollow CoO/Co4S3@CoO/Co4S3 , only the potential of 1.48 V can achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2.) Impressively, the commercial solar panel is sufficient to drive the two-electrode electrolyzer consisting of hollow CoO/Co4S3@CoO/Co4S3. This finding offers a promising nonprecious metal-based catalyst that can be applied to catalyze the electrochemical overall water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000861496700001

Here, we utilize a simple hydrothermal method to synthesize three Co3O4 catalysts with different exposed crystal facets to elucidate their catalytic mechanism at the atomic level. Co3O4 microflowers, nanotruncated octahedra and nanorods have mainly exposed {112}, {011} and {001} crystal planes, respectively, and the concentration and distribution of Co2+ and Co3+ active sites on the surface are different. Further results indicate that the {112} and {011} planes with abundant Co3+ sites exhibit catalytic activity superior to that of the {001} plane. Surface atomic configuration and EPR studies manifest that the presence of octahedral coordinated Co3+ sites optimizes the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. This work reveals the importance of regulating surface atomic configuration and catalytic active sites, and opens a new avenue for the development of solar-driven water splitting.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000518579100010

Currently, the popular strategy for fabricating S vacancies is to remove part of S atoms of MoS2. Owing to the same identity of S atoms, the removal process is usually random and does not have selectivity. Herein, we develop a defect-predesigned strategy to produce MoS2 with single-atomic S vacancies (SV-MoS2) simply by preparing Se-doped MoS2 (Se-MoS2) and subsequent removing the Se of Se-MoS2. S vacancies originates from the vaporization of the doped Se atoms, making the formation of S vacancies have a high selectivity and raising a good possibility for precisely modulating the concentration of S vacancies. The results show that the concentration of S vacancies can be controlled over the range from similar to 7.46% to 13.54%. MoS1.76 with similar to 12.10% of S vacancies exhibits outstanding HER performance: an overpotential of 100 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1), corroborating the theoretical prediction about the optimum concentration of S vacancies. Density functional theory calculation further reveals that the activation of MoS2 basal planes may intrinsically originate from the modification of S vacancies to band structure and density of state of MoS2, optimizing the hydrogen adsorption energy. This defect-predesigned strategy reduces the probability of forming the aggregates of S vacancies and will be more helpful for understanding how S vacancies affect the properties of MoS2.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2574-0970		WOS:000757975000001

Without flow seeding, the magnitude of the electrical conductivity is observed to be too small for significant magnetohydrodynamic forces to affect the conducting flow. This is consistent with past observations. With potassium seeding the electrical conductivity can be increased by 4-5 orders of magnitude, however, a critical percentage of seed particles is observed for which detonation is no longer sustainable. Therefore, there are limits to the electrical conductivity that can be achieved in burned gas mixtures. To further understand the dynamics of the physics involved a parametric study is conducted by varying the ambient pressure, the nitrogen dilution and the potassium seeding percentage. In order to reach these conclusions, a detailed kinetic mechanism of 26 species and 65 reactions has been compiled from the available literature and validated for applications of detonation and ionization chemistry. From the computed mass fractions the mixture-averaged electrical conductivity is then computed.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			0938-1287	1432-2153		WOS:000310326900009

The delay time and intensity of TaO emission are measured as a function of laser fluence, distance from the target surface and ambient O-2 pressure.

Here the authors demonstrate how the 3D lattice displacement and strain evolution depend on the crystallographic facets of Pt nanoparticles during CO oxidation reaction, providing new insights in the relationship between facet-related surface strain and chemistry.Nanostructures with specific crystallographic planes display distinctive physico-chemical properties because of their unique atomic arrangements, resulting in widespread applications in catalysis, energy conversion or sensing. Understanding strain dynamics and their relationship with crystallographic facets have been largely unexplored. Here, we reveal in situ, in three-dimensions and at the nanoscale, the volume, surface and interface strain evolution of single supported platinum nanocrystals during reaction using coherent x-ray diffractive imaging. Interestingly, identical {hkl} facets show equivalent catalytic response during non-stoichiometric cycles. Periodic strain variations are rationalised in terms of O-2 adsorption or desorption during O-2 exposure or CO oxidation under reducing conditions, respectively. During stoichiometric CO oxidation, the strain evolution is, however, no longer facet dependent. Large strain variations are observed in localised areas, in particular in the vicinity of the substrate/particle interface, suggesting a significant influence of the substrate on the reactivity.

Both components react at temperatures above 1400 degrees C where cristobalite is reduced by the carbon while increases the mullite content. At 1600 degrees C mullite tends to disappear due to the reduction reaction leading to the formation of alumina. The reaction between chamotte and active carbon in these conditions produces the reduction of silica and mullite. This process increases with the reaction time although not all the active carbon is consumed. The graphite nanodomain size of the active carbon tends to decrease with respect to the original size with both the temperature and the reaction time. The microstructures of the obtained materials present a glassy phase due to the inherent presence of impurities in chamotte, and where small particles, pores and mullite needles are also observed. The presence of this glassy phase becomes more pronounced with the treating temperature while solid particles and pores tend to disappear, moreover, the formation of the glassy phase occurs in a less extent due to the higher concentration of active carbon. The presence of the liquid glassy phase also favours the formation of the long-needle like mullite crystals. (C) 2020 SECV.

Changes of phase composition, relative density, and grain size in the ceramics sintered at different temperature were analyzed. It was shown that phase transformation in sintering ceramics was controlled by relationship between the Na2O evaporation and Li+ ions stabilization, while microstructure evolution was controlled by pore-boundary interaction. LiSBA with YSZ addition (Zr-LiSBA) showed more significant variation of beta '' phase fractions, slower grain growth and faster densification with increasing sintering temperature, which were caused by enhanced Na2O evaporation and gas transport by oxygen ion conductor ZrO2 as well as the drag effect by second phase particles of YSZ in Zr-LiSBA ceramics. Zr-LiSBA specimens sintered at optimized condition achieved higher Vickers microhardness and intermediate Na+ ion conductivity.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000460492200018

The kinetics of the signal accumulation is close to the S-shaped kinetics of oxygen accumulation. The fact of self-acceleration of the reaction is supported by the time dependence of the ratio of the intensities of the v(O-O) bands caused by CaO2 and CaO2 . 2H(2)O(2) in the Raman spectrum. The kinetics of accumulation of stabilized radical anions O-2(-.) reflects the process of accumulation of the CaO2 phase with the radical anions incorporated into defects of its crystal structure. The half-conversion times derived from the EPR spectra and from the oxygen evolution are close to each other, and their temperature dependences obey the Arrhenius law with E = (65 +/- 5) kJ/mol. The decomposition is accelerated in the presence of a large water excess, and the accumulation of both the EPR signal and oxygen is described by a first-order kinetic curve rather than by an S-shaped curve. The data obtained support the previously suggested model of the two-stage autocatalytic decomposition of CaO2 . 2H(2)O(2) with participation of water.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0036-0236			WOS:000223396300015

Porphyrin-based metal- and covalent-organic frameworks as heterogeneous nanosized photocatalysts in organic synthesis								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C				9	47			16885	16910		10.1039/d1tc04147a		NOV 2021		DEC 9 2021	2021	The porphyrin-containing metal- and covalent-organic frameworks, respectively MOFs and COFs, are quite versatile porous nanomaterials for hetero-photocatalysis. Indeed, they are capable of catalysing the photoinduced reduction of CO2 and metal, contaminant degradation, H-2 and O-2 evolutions, photodynamic therapy, and thermotherapy, and biomimicry. Concurrently, they are also efficient photocatalysts for a large variety of organic reactions. This mini-review presents a comprehensive account of the current state of the art in this area and includes several examples of CO2 transformation for the preparation of plus value chemicals such as methane and cyclic carbonates, formation of peroxides including Juglone, ascaridole and Artemisinin, ketones from benzyl alcohols and N-methylquinolinium salts, and imines from the photooxidative coupling of benzylamines and 2-aminobenzamides, selective oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides, hydroxylation of aromatic boronic acids, various cases of C-C formations from diazo compounds and stable C-H bonds and oxidative Mannich reactions, C-P bond formations from aerobic cross dehydrogenative-coupling reactions with amines, and C-X bond activations (X = H, F, Br), reduction of nitroaromatics, dehydrogenation of tetrahydroquinolines, deprotection of aromatic ketones from their corresponding aryloxathiolanes, and asymmetric Strecker reactions. It also includes pertinent details regarding the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of types I and II occurring during photoinduced electron and energy transfer processes within the porous heterogeneous nanocatalysts, which play a major role in the transformation of organic molecules.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000721913200001

However, the safe and controllable production of effective defects in the oxides is still challenging. Here, we report a facile one-pot solid lithiothermic reduction approach to generate graded oxygen defects in TiO2 nanoparticles. Various levels of lithium reduction are systematically studied, and meanwhile, a distinct phase transition from anatase TiO2 to cubic LixTiO2 is observed with the increasing lithium ratio. The structure and evolution of surface defects and bulk phase transition are investigated in detail. Afterward, we demonstrate their applications in carbon dioxide photoreduction and photothermal imaging. The slightly reduced TiO2 with effective oxygen defects affords a highly broadened solar spectrum absorption and yields significantly enhanced visible photocatalytic activity in CO2 conversion, which is further revealed by theoretical calculations. The highly reduced TiO2 with obvious phase transition shows enhanced solar absorption and achieves high photo-thermal-conversion efficacy, showing huge potential in photo-thermal-related applications. The lithiothermic reduction is a general and effective approach to produce defects and induce phase transition in oxides, which can be used in multiple applications.									16	1	0	0	3	0	17			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000512216900053	31913596

In this formulation, the vibronic coupling is the Hamiltonian matrix element between the reactant and product mixed electronic-proton vibrational wavefunctions. The magnitude of the vibronic coupling and its dependence on the proton donor-acceptor distance can significantly impact the rates and kinetic isotope effects, as well as the temperature dependences, of proton-coupled electron transfer reactions. Both of these self-exchange reactions are vibronically nonadiabatic with respect to a solvent environment at room temperature, but the proton tunneling is electronically nonadiabatic for the phenoxyl/phenol reaction and electronically adiabatic for the benzyl/toluene reaction. For the phenoxyl/phenol system, the electrons are unable to rearrange fast enough to follow the proton motion on the electronically adiabatic ground state, and the excited electronic state is involved in the reaction. For the benzyl/toluene system, the electrons can respond virtually instantaneously to the proton motion, and the proton moves on the electronically adiabatic ground state. For both systems, the vibronic coupling decreases exponentially with the proton donor-acceptor distance for the range of distances studied. When the transferring hydrogen is replaced with deuterium, the magnitude of the vibronic coupling decreases and the exponential decay with distance becomes faster. Previous studies designated the phenoxyl/phenol reaction as proton-coupled electron transfer and the benzyl/toluene reaction as hydrogen atom transfer. In addition to providing insights into the fundamental physical differences between these two types of reactions, the present analysis provides a new diagnostic for differentiating between the conventionally defined hydrogen atom transfer and proton-coupled electron transfer reactions.									118	2	0	0	21	0	118			0002-7863			WOS:000242941600070	17177415	
J	Roh, Heui-Seol								Kinetics of Polarization Mechanisms								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				160	9			H519	H528		10.1149/2.119308jes				2013	2013	Polarization is a primary application process in electrochemical reactions. We have proposed a statistical thermodynamic theory for electrochemical reactions which is essential to investigate non-equilibrium, quasi-equilibrium, and equilibrium electrochemical reaction processes. We here apply the electrochemical reaction theory to understand the detailed non-equilibrium kinetics of polarization in electrochemical reactions. The unified approach demonstrates the current density as a function of electric potential, time, and space so that the theory leads to a new paradigm for polarization in electrochemical reactions. Three variable separation constants represent particle number constants and play the major roles in exploring the distinct polarization mechanisms. The kinetic theory accounts for the four control mechanisms of activation, concentration, resistance, and film polarization. Three limiting current densities and four activation potentials are adopted as input parameters. Theoretical calculations agree with existing experimental data in a wide range of electric potential including the four control regimes of polarization. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

Various phagocytes of mammals and invertebrates produce ETs, however, the evolutionary history of this DNA-based host defence strategy is unclear. Here we report that Sentinel (S) cells of the multicellular slug stage of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum produce ETs upon stimulation with bacteria or lipopolysaccharide in a reactive oxygen species-dependent manner. The production of ETs by S cells requires a Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor domain containing protein TirA and reactive oxygen species-generating NADPH oxidases. Disruption of these genes results in decreased clearance of bacterial infections. Our results demonstrate that D. discoideum is a powerful model organism to study the evolution and conservation of mechanisms of cell-intrinsic immunity, and suggest that the origin of DNA-based ETs as an innate immune defence predates the emergence of metazoans.									207	2	2	0	171	0	213			2041-1723			WOS:000371701700001	26927887

The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution amount of ZnO samples is near to zero. The novel composite photocatalyst CoSx/OV-ZnO have high photocatalytic liveness. It is up to 256 mu mol under visible light irradiation for 5h, which is about increased 30% than CoSx/ZnO. The hydrogen production number of CoSx/OV-ZnO do not reduce obviously after 15h irradiation, it exhibits high photocatalytic stability. The morphologies, surface features and physical characteristics of catalyst are analysed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction, X-ray energy spectrum (XPS), Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET), and fluorescence spectra etc. The SEM results demonstrates amorphous CoSx is uniformly diffused on the hexagonal wurtzite OV-ZnO. The XPS shows the successful synthesis of ZnO oxygen vacancies. The CoSx/OV-ZnO has better superficial area and pore volume (BET), which is conducive to the adsorption of EY molecules. The ZnO electron transfer and the charge separation are obviously improved (fluorescence and electrochemical). Accordingly, CoSx/OV-ZnO might be a latent new photocatalyst.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000456048800025

The full reaction of catalyst monomers approaching and reacting in the Ru-V oxidation state were studied. Analysis of the solvation shell in the reactant and along the reaction coordinate revealed that the oxo itself is hydrophobic, which adds a significant driving force to form the dimer. The effect of the solvent on the reaction between the prereactive dimer and the product was small. The solvent seems to lower the barrier for the isoquinoline (isoq) complex while it is increased for pyridines. By comparing the reaction in the gas phase and solution, the proposed p-stacking interaction of the isoq ligands is found to be entirely driven by the water medium.									39	2	0	0	4	0	40			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000402523900049	28493633

Changes in both the phase and morphology of the films were studied as a function of the annealing process, time and atmosphere. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was used to study phase evolution of the films during annealing. Atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were employed to characterize microstructure and morphology of the films. XRD analyses revealed phase transformations from metallic Sn to romarchite and finally to cassiterite as a function of higher annealing temperature. Differences in the phase transformation rate from metallic tin films to tin dioxide were observed between oxygen and air atmospheres. Little variation in grain size was observed during oxidation annealing from metallic to oxide states in either air or oxygen. However, surface roughness of the films was strongly dependent on the annealing atmospheres. The films annealed under air showed that surface roughness increased linearly with time and temperature, while the surface roughness change of the tin oxide films annealed under oxygen exhibited saturation behavior. The surface morphology change of the tin oxide films processed in oxygen exhibited different behavior from those processed in air.

A rational design for developing efficient electrocatalysts by tuning the surface electronic state is regarded as a promising strategy to overcome these obstacles. Herein, we report a phosphorus-doped potassium peroxyniobate (KNb3O8, denoted as P-KNO) electrocatalyst with enriched oxygen vacancies to effectively improve N-2-to-NH3 efficiency and suppress HER. Such P-KNO electrocatalyst achieves a rate of 23.01 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) for NH3 production at -0.45 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 39.77% at -0.4 V-RHE in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, which is about twice that of the non-modified KNb3O8 (denoted as KNO, 11.35 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1), 19.60%) counterpart under the same condition. Moreover, the resultant P-KNO electrocatalyst renders steady NH3 yield amounts and selectivity in cycling tests for 10 h. It is concluded that the enhanced N-2 fixation activity and faradaic efficiency are ascribed to the phosphorus doping and formation of oxygen vacancies, which not only make the surface of the electrocatalyst highly hydrophobic but also adjust the surface electronic structure of potassium niobate, thus resulting in accelerated N-2 adsorption and activation during the NRR process. This electrocatalyst with phosphorus-doping and oxygen vacancies gives deep insights into the rational regulation of the surface electronic state of NRR electrocatalysts for efficient NH3 synthesis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000824950400001	35801527

Herein, noble-metal-free 2D CoP nanosheets were prepared by a phosphorization method using Co(OH)(2) nanosheets as precursors, and then employed as photocatalytic cocatalyst and template to make 0D TiO2 nanoparticles in-situ grow on the surface for construction of 0D/2D TiO2/CoP hybrid by a simple hydrothermal method. The TiO2/CoP hybrid with the optimal ratio of CoP cocatalyst (1 wt.%) manifested significantly improved photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of 0.604 mmol g(-1) h(-1), which is tenfold in comparison to pure TiO2 (0.06 mmol g(-1) h(-1)). The mechanism of performance enhancement was fully investigated and supposed that 2D CoP nanosheets cocatalyst can enhance the photo-absorption and provide more active sites for water reduction reaction; furthermore, 2D CoP nanosheets with smaller work function and high conductivity would form an Ohmic-junction with TiO2 nanoparticles, which can significantly accelerate the separation of photo-generated charge carriers and improve the exploitation of the photoexcited electrons in water redox reaction. This work is anticipated to impel more perspicacity into synthesizing innovative photocatalytic systems with 2D transition metal phosphides cocatalysts for attaining high photocatalytic H-2 evolving pursuit.

The activity and product selectivity of Cu surfaces roughened by plasma pretreatment in Ar, O-2, or N-2 were compared with that of electrochemically polished Cu samples. Differences in total and product current densities, the ratio of current densities for HER (the hydrogen evolution reaction) to CO2RR, and the ratio of current densities for C2+ to C-1 products depend on the electrochemically active surface and are nearly independent of plasma composition. Theoretical analysis of an electropolished and roughened Cu surface reveals a higher fraction of undercoordinated Cu sites on the roughened surface, sites that bind CO preferentially. Roughened surfaces also contain square sites similar to those on a Cu(100) surface but with neighboring step sites, which adsorb OC-COH, a precursor to C2+ products. These findings explain the increases in the formation of oxygenates and hydrocarbons relative to CO and the ratio of oxygenates to hydrocarbons observed with increasing surface roughness.									100	3	0	0	6	0	100			2380-8195			WOS:000526315900025		
J	Amin, Muhamed								Predicting the oxidation states of Mn ions in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II using supervised and unsupervised machine learning								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH											10.1007/s11120-022-00941-8		JUL 2022			2022	Serial Femtosecond Crystallography at the X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) sources enabled the imaging of the catalytic intermediates of the oxygen evolution reaction of Photosystem II (PSII). However, due to the incoherent transition of the S-states, the resolved structures are a convolution from different catalytic states. Here, we train Decision Tree Classifier and K-means clustering models on Mn compounds obtained from the Cambridge Crystallographic Database to predict the S-state of the X-ray, XFEL, and CryoEM structures by predicting the Mn's oxidation states in the oxygen-evolving complex. The model agrees mostly with the XFEL structures in the dark S-1 state. However, significant discrepancies are observed for the excited XFEL states (S-2, S-3,S- and S-0) and the dark states of the X-ray and CryoEM structures. Furthermore, there is a mismatch between the predicted S-states within the two monomers of the same dimer, mainly in the excited states. We validated our model against other metalloenzymes, the valence bond model and the Mn spin densities calculated using density functional theory for two of the mismatched predictions of PSII. The model suggests designing a more optimized sample delivery and illumiation systems are crucial to precisely resolve the geometry of the advanced S-states to overcome the noncoherent S-state transition. In addition, significant radiation damage is observed in X-ray and CryoEM structures, particularly at the dangler Mn center (Mn4). Our model represents a valuable tool for investigating the electronic structure of the catalytic metal cluster of PSII to understand the water splitting mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000830960800001	35896927

Herein, we demonstrate Fe2P as an efficient catalyst promoter in Pd/C catalyst system for formic acid electro-oxidation in fuel cells reactions. Adding Fe2P in the Pd/C catalyst system greatly increases the performances for formic acid oxidation by 3-4 times; the CO stripping technique displays two kinds of active sites formation in the Pd-Fe2P/C catalyst system coming from the interaction of Pd, Fe2P and Pd oxide species and both are more efficient for formic acid and CO-species electrooxidation. The smaller charge transfer resistance and Tafel slope for formic acid oxidation indicate the improvements in kinetics by Fe2P in the Pd-Fe2P/C system. The nanostructured hybrid units of Pd, Fe2P and carbon are evidently visible in the high resolution microscopy images and XPS technique confirmes the electronic effect in the catalyst system. The promotion effect of Fe2P in the catalyst system arising from the structure, composition and electronic effect changes is discussed with the help from multiple physical and electrochemical techniques. It is concluded that Fe2P as a significant catalyst promoter will have potential application in energy transfer related electrochemical reactions.									100	7	0	0	6	0	101			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000418463700005

TEM study of nanocomposites morphology has shown uniform distribution of highly exfoliated graphene oxide nanoplatelets in PET matrix. Investigations of oxygen permeability of amorphous films of nanocomposites showed that the nanocomposites had better oxygen barrier properties than the neat PET. The improvement of oxygen permeability for PET nanocomposite films over the neat PET is approximately factors of 2-3.3. DSC study on the nonisothermal crystallization behaviors proves that GO acts as a nucleating agent to accelerate the crystallization of PET matrix. The evolution of the lamellar nanostructure of nanocomposite and neat PET was monitored by SAXS during nonisothermal crystallization from the melt. It was found that unfilled PET and nanocomposite with the highest concentration of GO (0.5 wt%) showed almost similar values of the long period (L = 11.4 nm for neat PET and L = 11.5 nm for PET/0.5GO).									13	1	0	0	0	0	14			1687-4110	1687-4129		WOS:000364688600001

The combination of uniformly dispersed Cu sites and N-doped carbon materials has enabled Cu-N-C SACs to show outstanding performances in many catalytic fields. However, the adjustment of their coordination environment, the influence of carrier materials and their dynamic evolution in the catalytic process still remain unclear, which limits the application of Cu-N-C SACs. Thus, it is of great significance and urgent to deeply understand the reaction mechanism of Cu-N-C SACs in different catalytic fields. This review focuses on the preparation strategy, regulation mechanism of the coordination environment, catalytic performance and dynamic evolution process of Cu-N-C SACs. Combined with a series of in situ/operando characterization methods, the changes in their coordination and structure in the catalytic process is highlighted. Finally, the prospects of active machine learning, coordination structure identification and determination of real active sites are presented. This review aims to provide a reference for the rational design of Cu-N-C SACs and the exploration of their catalytic mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000864392900001		
J	Li, Mengke; He, Zhiguo; Zhong, Hui; Hu, Liang; Sun, Wei								Oxygen vacancy enhances the catalytic activity of trimetallic oxide catalysts for efficient peroxymonosulfate activation								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO				9	3			1037	1051		10.1039/d1en00976a		JAN 2022		MAR 17 2022	2022	Although transition metal oxides are widely used as catalysts during sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs), their expensive cost and low efficiency hindered their large-scale applications. In this work, a novel cost-economical and efficient catalyst composed of cobalt oxides on the surface of electrolytic manganese residue with abundant oxygen defects (v-Co3O4@EMR) was synthesized and applied to activate persulfate for the degradation of organic contaminants. The catalytic performance of the v-Co3O4@EMR trimetallic oxide catalyst was better than that of the pristine Mn/Fe bimetallic oxides. v-Co3O4 played a dominant role in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, while EMR could facilitate the redox cycle of Co redox pairs and acted as the magnetism supplier for catalyst recycling. The synergistic effects of Co, Mn and Fe promoted the production of SO4-, OH, O-2(-) and O-1(2). As a result, seven kinds of organic contaminants could be removed with high degradation efficiency. Introducing oxygen vacancies (O-V) into Co3O4 was crucial because of their contribution to enlarging Fe/Mn-O bonds in EMR, which could accelerate the electron transfer between Fe/Mn and O species. Radicals, especially SO4-, have controlled the catalytic reaction while the non-radical way played a supporting role. The low metal concentration and strong COD removal ability for actual wastewater indicated that the developed system in this work could be well used for practical applications.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2051-8153	2051-8161		WOS:000746592300001

Partial Pt coverage of Ti was obtained at flow rates <= 5 mL.min(-1), while a more-even geometrical distribution and linearly increasing Electrochemical Surface Area (ECSA) of Pt was obtained for flow rates of >5 and <20 mL.min(-1). Above 20 mL.min(-1), the morphology did not significantly change, and only a limited increase in ECSA of Pt (Pt-ECSA) was observed. Second, the performance of the Pt functionalized Ti-HFEs was evaluated at fixed potential in i) liquid phase oxidation of Fe-II to Fe-III, and ii) the hydrogen (gas) evolution reaction (HER). Generally, for the oxidation of Fe(CN)(6)(4-), a linear increase in current from 3 to approximate to 9 mA was found as a function of increasing gas flow rate. For the HER, a gas evolving reaction, initially (in the range of 0-10 mL.min(-1)) a much larger enhancement in current (from approximate to-10 to -35 mA) was observed than consecutively at higher flow rates. The effect of gas flow rate on Pt deposition, and utilization of platinized Ti HFEs, is explained on the basis of increasing fractional participation of relatively small pores at high flow rates, and generally an increasing mass transfer coefficient (k(M)) associated with localized mixing of the electrolyte near the electrode/electrolyte interface. The k(M) is roughly in the same order of magnitude as obtained in experiments using rotating disc electrodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000768902800011

Herein, we synthesize an electrocatalyst composing of two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin ternary pyrite-type cobalt phosphosulfide nanosheets and conductive carbon black (CoPS NSs/C) by the one-step phosphosulfide process. Thanks to the introduction of the C, the composite not only presents a unique three-dimensional (3D) interconnected reticulum structure but also effectively reduces the thickness of nanosheets. The as-synthesized electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable small overpotential toward HER in wide pH range. Meanwhile, the electrocatalyst owns higher charge transfer rate and excellent stability. The good performance is mainly attributed to the combination of the advantages of both 2D nanosheets and 3D interconnected reticulum structure, which offers larger surface area, sufficient active sites and more contaction with electrolytes. This work provides a new method for preparing ultrathin ternary transition-metal phosphosulfide (TMPS) nanosheets, and offers a facile mute for improving electrocatalytic activity by designing synergistic morphology of 2D and 3D.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000605191300005

We study and discuss different sources of hot oxygen and carbon atoms in the thermosphere and their changing importance with the EUV flux. The increase of the production rates due to higher densities resulting from the higher EUV flux competes against the expansion of the thermosphere and corresponding increase in collisions. We find that the escape due to photodissociation increases with increasing EUV level. However, for the escape via some other reactions, e.g., dissociative recombination of O-2(+), this is only true until the EUV level reaches 10 times the present EUV flux and then the rates start to decrease. Furthermore, our results show that Mars could not have had a dense atmosphere at the end of the Noachian epoch, since such an atmosphere would not have been able to escape until today. In the pre-Noachian era, most of the magma ocean and volcanic activity-related outgassed CO2 atmosphere could have been lost thermally until the Noachian epoch, when nonthermal loss processes such as suprathermal atom escape became dominant. Thus, early Mars could have been hot and wet during the pre-Noachian era with surface CO2 pressures larger than 1 bar during the first 300 Myr after the planet's origin.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2169-9097	2169-9100		WOS:000407049100010

Moreover, the temporal evolution of MIF-S shows increasing magnitudes between 2.7 and 2.5 Ga until the start of the Great Oxidation Event (G.O.E.) at around 2.4 Ga. The conclusion of a completely anoxic atmosphere up to the G.O.E. is in contrast to recent studies on redox-sensitive elements, which suggest slightly oxidizing conditions during continental weathering already several hundred million years prior to the G.O.E. In order to investigate this apparent inconsistency, we present multiple sulfur isotopes for 2.71 Ga pyritic black shales derived from the Kidd Creek area, Ontario, Canada. These samples display high positive Delta S-33 values up to 3.8% and the typical late Archean slope in Delta S-36/Delta S-33 of 0.9. In contrast, the time period before (32-2.73 Ga) is characterized by greatly attenuated MIF-S magnitudes and a slope in Delta S-36/Delta S-33 of 1.5. We attribute the increase in Delta S-33 magnitude as well as the contemporaneous change in the slope of Delta S-36/Delta S-33 to changes in the relative reaction rate of different MIF-S source reactions and changes in atmospheric sulfur exit channels. Both of these are dependent on atmospheric CH4:CO2 and O-2 mixing ratios. We propose a distinct change in atmospheric composition at 2.7 Ga resulting from increased fluxes of oxygen and methane as the best explanation for the observed Neoarchean MIF-S record. Our data and modeling results suggest that oxygenic photosynthesis was a major contributor to primary productivity 2.7 billion years ago. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we report a convenient strategy to synthesis Fe3O4 embedded in N doped hollow carbon sphere (NHCS) for ORR. What's interesting is that the carbon microsphere is composed of two-dimensional (2D) nanoplate that could provide more exposed active sites. The usage of solid ZnO nanowires as zinc source is crucial to obtain this structure. The Fe3O4@NHCS-2 exhibits better catalytic activity and durability than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, it further displays high-performance of Zn-air batteries as a cathode electrocatalyst with a high-power density of 133 mWcm(-2) and high specific capacity of 701 mAhg(-1). The special hollow structure composed 2D nanoplate, high surface area, as well as synergistic effect between the high active Fe3O4 nanoparticles and N-doped matrix endows this outstanding catalytic activity. The work presented here can be easily extended to prepare metal compounds decorated carbon nanomaterials with special structure for a broad range of energy storage and conversion devices.									44	11	0	0	1	0	47			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000494681100012

Utilizing electrochemical reconstruction to fabricate an OER active catalyst based on a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst enables the development of a bifunctional catalyst that possesses state-of-the-art HER and OER activity simultaneously. Here we successfully synthesized Fe-doped Ni&Ni0.2Mo0.8N (Fe-0.01-Ni&Ni0.2Mo0.8N) on Ni foam and, after rapid electrochemical reconstruction, the Fe-doped Ni&Ni0.2Mo0.8N compound was reconstructed into NiO co-doped with Fe and Mo (Fe-0.01&Mo-NiO). The Fe-0.01-Ni&Ni0.2Mo0.8N and Fe-0.01&Mo-NiO compounds were found to exhibit state-of-the-art HER and OER performance, respectively. Alkaline fresh water/seawater electrolysis was then systematically studied using the two-electrode electrolyzer Fe-0.01-Ni&Ni0.2Mo0.8N||Fe-0.01&Mo-NiO. Due to the excellent seawater HER and OER activity of the individual catalysts, the electrolyzer exhibited record-high performance for seawater electrolysis, achieving a current density of 688 mA cm(-2) at 1.7 V. Further experiments under quasi-industrial conditions (6 M KOH & seawater, 60 degrees C) showed that the electrolyzer delivers a current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) at the extremely low voltage of 1.562 V, which is only 1.49% higher than that required for fresh water under the same conditions. Stability testing of the electrolyzer showed that it exhibits good durability over 80 h under the harsh industrial conditions. Therefore, the findings in this research promote the development of bifunctional catalysts and address the small performance differences between alkaline fresh water and seawater electrolysis under industrial conditions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000837724400001

Complexity				8	1			15	19		10.1002/cplx.10046				Sept.-Oct. 2002	2002	Metabolism comprises the network of interactions that provide energy and building blocks for cells and organisms, a network sustaining the living and allowing it to grow and reproduce. For well-studied organisms, especially microbes such as Escherichia coli, considerable information about metabolic reactions has been accumulated through decades of experimental work. This information, originally scattered through thousands of articles of original literature, has increasingly found its way into larger collections including encyclopedias and online databases. With easier availability of this information, it has become feasible to map the structure of large pieces of an organism's metabolic network.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			1076-2787			INSPEC:7681007

Iron, which is the most abundant transition metal in the earth's crust, is a prospective candidate for this purpose. Herein, we report two iron complexes based on the polypyridyl ligand Py5OH (Py5OH =pyridine-2,6-diyIbis [di(pyridin-2-yl)methanoll) that can catalyse water oxidation to produce 04 in Re-induced (at pH 8, highest turnover number (TON)=26.5; turnover frequency (TOF)=2.2 s(-1)), Ce-M-induced (at pH approximate to 1.,,1,5 highest TON=16; TOF=0.75 s(-1)) and photo -induced (at pH 8, highest TON=43.5; TOF=0.6 s(-1)) reactions. A chloride ligand in one of the iron complexes is shown to affect the activity strongly, improve stability and, thereby, the performance at pH 8 but it inhibits oxygen evolution at 1.5. The observations are consistent with a change in mechanism for catalytic water oxidation with the Fe(Py5OH) complexes between acidic (Ce-IV) and near -neutral pH (Ru-III).									50	1	0	0	5	0	50			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000378635500016	27114078

However, inefficiency and instability are severe issues in state-of-the-art membranes, which need to urgently resolve with systematic membrane designs and innovative, inexpensive junctional catalysts. Here we show a shielding and in-situ formation strategy of fully-interconnected earth-abundant goethite Fe+3O(OH) catalyst, which lowers the activation energy barrier from 5.15 to 1.06eV per HO-H bond and fabricates energy-efficient, cost-effective, and durable shielded catalytic bipolar membranes. Small water dissociation voltages at limiting current density (U-LCD: 0.8V) and 100mAcm(-2) (U-100: 1.1V), outstanding cyclic stability at 637mAcm(-2), long-time electro-stability, and fast acid-base generations (H2SO4: 3.90.19 and NaOH: 4.4 +/- 0.21Mm(-2) min(-1) at 100mAcm(-2)) infer confident potential use of the novel bipolar membranes in emerging sustainable technologies. Bipolar membranes integrated water dissociation and acid-base generations have great potential in emerging sustainable technologies but remains inefficient. Here, the authors circumvent this inefficiency and instability of the membranes by developing polyaniline shielded catalytic bipolar membranes.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2041-1723			WOS:000665625900006	33397931

In this work, we report the controlled synthesis of pyrite-type bimetallic Ni-doped CoS2 nanoneedle (NN) arrays supported on stainless steel (SS) (designated as NixCo1-xS2 NN/SS, 0 <= x <= 1) and the related compositional influence on electrocatalytic efficiencies for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER/HER). Impressively, the Ni0.33Co0.67S2 NN/SS displays superior activity and faster kinetics for catalyzing OER (low overpotential of 286 mV at 50 mA cm(-2); Tafel value of 55 mV dec(-1)) and HER (low overpotential of 350 mV at 30 mA cm(-2); Tafel value of 76 mV dec(-1)) than those of counterparts with other Ni/Co ratios and also monometallic Ni- or Co-based sulfides, which is attributed to the optimized balance from the improved electron transfer capability, increased exposure of electrocatalytic active sites, and favorable dissipation of gaseous products over the nanoneedle surface. Furthermore, the conductive, flexible SS support and firmly attached in-situ integrated feature, result in the flexibility and remarkable long-term stability of as-prepared binder-free Ni0.33Co0.67S2 NN/SS electrode.

The construction of different heterostructures based on 2D materials offers great opportunities for boosting the catalytic activity in electo(photo)chemical reactions.

A hot injection of 1 yielded a pure phase and highly crystalline Cu9S5, which was then electrophoretically deposited (EPD) on a highly conducting nickel foam (NF) substrate. When assessed as an electrode for OER, the Cu9S5/NF displayed an overpotential of merely 298 +/- 3 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media. The overpotential recorded here supersedes the value obtained for the best reported Cu-based as well as the benchmark precious-metal-based RuO2 and IrO2 electrocatalysts. In addition, the choronoamperometric OER indicated the superior stability of Cu9S5/NF, rendering its suitability as the sustainable anode material for practical feasibility. The excellent catalytic activity of Cu9S5 can be attributed to the formation of a crystalline CuO overlayer on the conductive Cu9S5 that behaves as active species to facilitate OER. This study delivers a distinct molecular precursor approach to produce highly active copper-based catalysts that could be used as an efficient and durable OER electro(pre)catalysts relying on non-precious metals.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000514483200001	32011083

Depending on their linkers and binding patterns, COFs mainly exhibit microporosity, even though COFs with small mesopores have been reported using extended linkers. For some applications, especially when fast mass transport is desired, hierarchical pore structures are an ideal solution, e.g., with small micropores providing large surface areas and larger macropores providing unhindered transport to and from the materials surface. Herein, we have developed a facile strategy for the fabrication of crystalline COFs with inherent microporosity and template-induced, homogeneously distributed, yet tunable, macroporous structures. This method has been successfully applied to obtain various beta-ketoenamine-based COFs with interconnected macro-microporous structures. The as-synthesized macroporous COFs preserve high crystallinity with high specific surface area. When bipyridine moieties are introduced into the COF backbone, metals such as Co2+ can be coordinated within the hierarchical pore structure (macro-TpBpy-Co). The resulting macro-TpBpy-Co exhibits a high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, which is much improved compared to the purely microporous COF with a competitive overpotential of 380 mV at 10 mA/cm(2). This can be attributed to the improved mass diffusion properties in the hierarchically porous COF structures, together with the easily accessible active Co2+-bipyridine sites.									191	4	0	0	29	0	193			0002-7863			WOS:000466053400028	30916950

However, mild oxidative continental weathering and the development of ocean oxygen oases occurred several hundred million years before the Great Oxidation Event. The Great Oxidation Event thus represents a tipping point, whereby primary productivity and O-2 production overwhelmed the input of reduced species that consume O-2, and its timing is determined by the input of phosphate, the major limiting nutrient, and the dynamics of the solid Earth. Here, we determine the phase partitioning of phosphorus in 2.65 to 2.43 billion year old drill core samples from the Transvaal Supergroup, South Africa, to investigate the sequence of events that facilitated persistent atmospheric oxygenation. On the basis of the elevated C/P ratios found within sulfidic sediments, relative to the Redfield ratio, we suggest that, as oxidative continental weathering increased the influx of dissolved sulfate and hence dissolved sulfide in the oceans, bioavailable phosphorus became more abundant due to anoxic recycling of sedimentary phosphorus phases. Biogeochemical modelling indicates that this initiated a positive feedback on primary productivity and shows that the evolution of phosphorus recycling may have been a critical step that enabled Earth's transition to a persistently oxygenated atmosphere.Recycling of sedimentary phosphorus driven by increasing oceanic sulfide availability contributed to the persistent oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere, according to analysis of Archean drill-core samples and biogeochemical modelling									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1752-0894	1752-0908		WOS:000767886700011

Herein, a facile pathway to construct tetrataenite, an NiFe alloy of extraterrestrial origin and to address the limited electrical conductivity of metal oxides/hydroxides by directly constructing them atop graphene sheets is described. In this approach, a one-pot, bottom-up assembly of hybrid ultramicroporous materials (HUMs) was carried out, in the presence of suspended graphene (G), to homogeneously deposit the HUMs on unmodified graphene sheets, affording HUMs@G. Single metal (SIFSIX-3-Ni@G) and mixed metal (SIFSIX-3-NiFe@G) HUMs can be readily synthesized from their respective metal salts to afford a well-designed catalyst for the OER. The pyrolysis of SIFSIX-3-NiFe@G resulted in the deposition of the nanoalloy tetrataenite on G, demonstrating an exceptionally low OER onset potential of 1.44 V vs. RHE and reduced overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10) = 266 mV). The synergy between the composition of the active catalyst and the electronically conductive support was attained by designing a reaction system encoding the self-assembly of a crystalline pre-catalyst on G sheets.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000634843900001	33881028

While these applications have been traditionally seen as well-separated areas, recent examples have highlighted the possibility of coupling them. Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous production of H-2 and naphthalene removal from aqueous solutions with (unoptimized) photonic efficiencies of 0.97 and 0.33%, respectively, over Pt-TiO2 under simulated sunlight. Photocatalytic and spin-trapping experiments in the presence of a hydroxyl radical and hole scavengers evinced that only the photogenerated holes play a significant role in the oxidation of naphthalene. Isotopic labeling analyses showed that the evolved H2 isotopologues match those of the solvent and that deuterated water (but not deuterated naphthalene) decreases the reaction rate, suggesting its involvement in the rate-determining step. Moreover, the use of TiO2 does not lead to the significant formation of O-18-enriched CO2, suggesting that water is the source of the oxygen atoms. Ultimately, by considering the stable and transient reaction intermediates, we propose a plausible reaction pathway. Our work illustrates that environmental remediation can be effectively coupled to solar fuel production, providing a double purpose to photocatalytic reactions, while the mechanistic insights will be of use for the further development of this strategy.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800041

Recently, substantial advances have been achieved in PEC systems by improving light absorption and charge separation/transfer in PEC devices. However, less attention is given to the atomic design of photoelectrocatalysts to facilitate the final catalytic reactions occurring at photoelectrode surface, which largely limits the overall photo-to-energy conversion of PEC system. Fundamental catalytic mechanisms and recent progress in atomic design of PEC materials are comprehensively reviewed by engineering of defect, dopant, facet, strain, and single atom to enhance the activity and selectivity. Finally, the emerging challenges and research directions in design of PEC systems for future photo-to-energy conversions are proposed.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2198-3844		WOS:000724168200001	34850603

In this paper, a facile hydrothermal method is proposed for synthesizing the Ru decorated graphite carbon nitride/reduced graphene oxide (Ru-CN-rGO), which can be used as efficient electrocatalysts in alkaline media. The optimal Ru-CN-rGO (Ru: 4.4 wt%) exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic activity than these of Ru/C and Pt/C, which requires a low overpotential (45 mV) to derive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope (40.0 mV dec(-1)) and a large exchange current density (1.13 mA cm(-2)). More importantly, the obtained Ru-CN-rGO exhibits the long-term stability in alkaline electrolyte. The comparable results reveal that the CN can adjust the electronic structure of Ru, which is beneficial for accelerating the kinetics reaction, resulting in excellent HER performances. This work provides a new strategy for designing the efficient electrocatalyst.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-0216			WOS:000544748300001

Although Vacuum-Ultraviolet (VUV, lambda < 200 nm) is an important component of plasma environment, only few studies have focused on its effects so far. The emission from low-pressure microwave plasma in the VUV-UV regions was investigated in order to use this plasma as light sources for the study of the VUV/UV effects on various polymers (polyethylene, polymethylmelhacrylate, etc.) or high molecular weight oligomers (hexatriacontane). We have employed a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) in order to measure in situ the net mass change of the polymeric films exposed to VUV/UV radiation originating from hydrogen plasmas. Measurements were made with the specimens in vacuum, or immersed in low-pressure oxygen, directly exposed to the VUV/UV (perpendicular to the radiation flux), or only to the VUV-generated atomic oxygen, AO (parallel to the radiation flux). Following irradiation, samples were analysed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), in order to study the evolution of the oxygen content and of the various functional groups.					2nd International Symposium on Ionizing Radiation and Polymers (IRaP 96)2nd International Symposium on Ionizing Radiation and Polymers (IRaP 96)	NOV 03-08, 1996NOV 03-08, 1996	CEA Saclay, DSM DRECAM; Univ Antilles Guyane; Int Atom Energy Agcy; Inst OberflachenmodifizierungCEA Saclay, DSM DRECAM; Univ Antilles Guyane; Int Atom Energy Agcy; Inst Oberflachenmodifizierung	GUADELOUPE, FRANCEGUADELOUPE, FRANCE	70	2	0	0	1	0	72			0168-583X			WOS:A1997YC27900030

Herein, we reported the preparation of CoS2 nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped graphene (CoS2@N-GN) by one-step hydrothermal method and the enhanced electrochemical efficacy for catalyzing hydrogen and oxygen in water electrolysis. The CoS2@N-GN composites are composed of nitrogen-doped graphene and CoS2 nanocrystals with the average size of 73.5 nm. Benefitting from the improved electronic transfer and synergistic effect, the as-prepared CoS2@N-GN exhibits remarkable OER and HER performance in 1.0 M KOH, with overpotentials of 243 mV for OER and 204 mV for HER at 10 mA cm(-2), and the corresponding Tafel slopes of 51.8 and 108 mV dec(-1) respectively. Otherwise, the CoS2@N-GN hybrid also presents superior long-term catalytic durability. Moreover, an alkaline water splitting device assembled by CoS2@N-GN as both anode and cathode can achieve a low cell voltage of 1.53 V at 60 C with a high faraday efficiency of 100% for overall water splitting. The tremendously enhanced electrochemical behaviors arise from favorable factors including small sized, homogenously dispersed novel CoS2 nanocrystals and coupling interaction with the underlying conductive nitrogen-doped graphene, which would provide insight into the rational design of transition metal chalcogenides for highly efficient and durable hydrogen and oxygen-involved electrocatalysis.									19	1	0	0	2	0	19			2296-2646			WOS:000450781400001	30519558

Biophys. Acta 1232, 208-216]. The binding and functional properties of these four proteins in the red algal PSII were studied by release-reconstitution experiments. Of the four components, the 33 kDa protein binds to PSII completely by itself, and the 20 kDa protein binds to a level 61% of that in native PSII in the absence of other proteins. In contrast, cyt c(550) and the 12 kDa protein cannot bind to PSII efficiently by themselves; their effective binding requires the other three extrinsic proteins. In particular, a strong interaction was observed between cyt c(550) and the 12 kDa protein, and a weaker interaction was observed between cyt c(550) and the 20 kDa protein. While binding of the 33 kDa protein alone or cyt c(550) and the 12 kDa protein in the presence of the 33 and/or the 20 kDa protein generally enhanced oxygen evolution, binding of the 20 kDa protein did not. Oxygen evolution was strongly dependent on Ca2+ and Cl- in the absence of cyt c(550) and the 12 kDa protein, suggesting that these two proteins have functions similar to those of the 23 and 17 kDa proteins in higher plane PSII. From these results, we propose that the unique 20 kDa extrinsic protein found only in the red algal PSII functions in maintaining the proper binding of cyt c(550) and the 12 kDa protein but is not involved directly in oxygen evolution. The binding and functional properties of these four proteins were compared with those of the three extrinsic proteins found in cyanobacterial and higher plant PSII in an evolutionary point of view.									77	2	1	0	70	0	78			0006-2960			WOS:000072523600009	9485429

First, the process of photorespiration enables photosynthetic organisms to recycle phosphoglycolate formed by the oxygenase reaction catalyzed by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). Second, there are a number of carbon concentrating mechanisms that increase the CO2 concentration around Rubisco which increases the carboxylase reaction enhancing CO2 fixation. This review also presents possibilities for the beneficial modification of these processes with the goal of improving future crop yields.									50	3	0	0	41	0	54			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000326604900007	23771683

The results prove that the electrochemical generation of FeO42- could. be carried out on this kind of electrode in a 14 mol/L NaOH solution without any impact of the side reaction of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under the same experimental, condition. The results indicate that the dissoluble ion, FeO2- is one of existent formations of Fe(III) compounds, the ion is a reactant of the chemical oxidation and electrochemical oxidation, the redox couple is not FeO42-/Fe(OH)(3), but FeO42-/FeO2- in the concentratied NaOH solution. The feebly amphoteric property of Fe (III) compounds plays a considerable role in the manufacture of safety rechargeable batteries. Furthermore, the onset potential value of electro-oxidation of FeO2- (0.38 V vs. Hg/HgO, 14 mol/ L NaOH) is close to that of electro-reduction of FeO42- (0.54 V) under the same research condition. The results also indicate that the mechanism of electrochemical generation of FeO42- from FeO2- is an electro-chemical mechanism.

Here, a tri-electrolyte microfluidic zinc-air cells are developed based on structural evolution and electrolyte engineering. By strategically using acidic catholyte instead of alkalis, the device performance is largely improved and stabilized, benefiting from 0.8V higher cathodic reaction potential and prohibited carbonate contamination. Since alkalis are still preferred for the anolyte, a third bridgeelectrolyte is applied to avoid the neutralization of two electrolytes. To avoid using membranes, a microfluidic cell configuration is further integrated. Without the ion-restriction of the membranes, H2SO4 becomes applicable for catholyte and contributes to a stable operation with further improved potential of 2.18 V. Furthermore, the electrolyte mixing behavior is investigated from both experimental and simulation aspects, which demonstrates the recyclability of the electrolytes and provides guidance for the real application.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000812353600005

Development of high-performance ENRR catalysts and understanding of the activity origin of the catalyst are essential for the practical application of ENRR process. Herein, we report the size-dependent ENRR activity of monodisperse Au nanoparticles (NPs) sized ranging from 4 nm to 10 nm. 8 nm Au NPs is found to be an excellent ENRR catalyst with an ammonia production rate and Faradic efficiency of 17.49 mu g h(-1) mg(-l) Au and 5.79%, respectively. The high ENRR performance of 8 nm Au NP is rationalized with DFT studies, which indicate that an optimal proportion of the surface step sites is key to suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction and improving the catalytic activity towards ENRR. The study herein may provide guidelines for tailoring the ENRR catalysis on nanostructured metal catalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sersen, F; Kralova, K								Concentration-dependent inhibitory and stimulating effects of amphiphilic ammonium salts upon photosynthetic activity of spinach chloroplasts								GENERAL PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOPHYSICS				15	1			27	36						FEB 1996	1996	The effects of piperidinopropylesters of 2-, 3- and 4-alkoxy substituted phenylcarbamic acids (PPACs) on oxygen evolution rate (OER) in spinach chloroplasts were investigated. PPACs show concentration-dependent effects, namely OER inhibition at higher effector concentrations and OER stimulation at lower concentrations, i.e. below the inhibitory concentration range. The inhibitory efficiency of PPACs showed dependence on the alkyl chain length of the alkoxy substituent as well as on the position of this substituent on the benzene ring. Using EPR spectroscopy and fluorescence measurements it was confirmed that the site of PPAC inhibitory action is the donor side of photosystem 2, where D-1 and D-2 proteins are situated, namely the intermediates Z(+)/Y+, and the manganese cluster containing protein as well. The stimulating effects of PPACs on OER in spinach chloroplasts at relatively low effector concentrations are caused by photophosphorylation uncoupling due to protonophore properties of the effectors.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0231-5882			WOS:A1996UN00200003	8902555

To effectively prevent such disasters, we established an experimental platform to measure the spontaneous combustion characteristics of large-scale pressurized coal; thermal analysis experiments and microscopic analysis of briquettes under different axial pressures were carried out. It can be seen from the results that when the axial pressure is 4 MPa, the heating rate of the oxidative combustion of coal samples is accelerated, the crossing point temperature is lower (reduced by 71.09 degrees C), the activation energy is reduced (the second stage is decreased by 21.3 kJ/mol), and the oxidative combustion is more intense. Simultaneously, the porosity evolution process of briquettes under different axial pressures is simulated. Through calculation, it can be seen that the porosity and thermal conductivity show a linear increasing trend. The basis for the increase in the internal oxygen supply channels and increase in oxygen consumption when the axial pressure is 4 MPa is given. Through thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry analysis, it is found that the maximum mass loss rate and maximum mass growth rate of residual coal after combustion under an axial pressure of 4 MPa are low, the residual rate after combustion is large, and the flammability rate is low when reoxidized, while complete combustion oxidation releases more heat. The application of axial pressure will change the combustion characteristics of briquettes, and the promotion effect is more obvious at 4 MPa. Analyzing the laws of the coal-oxygen composite reaction under different axial pressures provides theoretical guidance for the prevention and control of multistress coupling fields in coalfield-fire areas.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2470-1343			WOS:000570009400054	32923809

In this work, La2O2CO3 encapsulated La2O3 nanopartides on a carbon black (La2O2CO3@La2O3/C) were fabricated via chemical precipitation in an aqueous solution containing different concentrations of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), followed by calcination at 750 degrees C. At a given CTAB concentration 24.8 mmol/L, the obtained lanthanum compound nanoparticles reach the smallest particle size (7.1 nm) and are well-dispersed on the carbon surface. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results demonstrate the formation of La2O2CO3 located on the surface of La2O3 nanopartides in the hybrid. The synthesized La2O2CO3@La2O3/C hybrid exhibits a significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity in electrocatalysis experiments relative to pure La2O3, La2O2CO3, and carbon in an alkaline environment, by using the R(R)DE technique. Moreover, its long-term stability also outperforms that obtained by commercial Pt/C catalysts (E-TEIC). The exact origin of the fast ORR kinetics is mainly ascribed to the La2O2CO3 layer sandwiched at the interface of carbon and La2O3, which contributes favorable surface-adsorbed hydroxide (-OHad-) substitution and promotes active oxygen adsorption at the interfaces. The unique covalent -C-O-C(=O)-O-La-O- bonds, formed at the interfaces between La2O2CO3 and carbon, can act as active sites for the improved ORR kinetics over this hybrid catalyst. Therefore, the fabrication of lanthanum compound-based hybrid material with an unique interfacial structure maybe open a new way to develop carbon-supported metal oxides as next-generation of ORR catalysts.									60	5	0	0	3	0	62			1944-8244			WOS:000366339100069	26619261

Herein, taking Bi4TaO8Cl (BTOC) as an exemplar, we demonstrated that the distribution of photogenerated electrons and holes on BTOC can be rationally modulated through surface pretreatment under different pH conditions, resulting in the selective loading of Pd nanoparticles from the top (001) facets to the side (110) facets. The spatial charge separation that occurs between the top and side facets of BTOC was verified, which enables reducing charge recombination and promotes the photocatalytic oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER) activity. It was found that Pd nanoparticles selectively loaded on the side (110) facets of BTOC significantly promote the OER activity, while Pd on the top (010) facets exhibits higher HER activity than the side facets. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for photocatalytic OER reaction on the BTOC was measured to be similar to 12.2% at 420 nm. The enhanced photocatalytic activity may be due to the synergistic effect of the spatial charge separation and accelerating interface charge transfer between BTOC and Pd nanoparticles. This work provides a beneficial approach for tuning the surface charge properties of semiconductor photocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000817757300001		
J	PETRII, OA; TSIRLINA, GA; KUZMINOVA, ZV				Tsirlina, Galina A/A-4940-2010				THE NATURE OF ANOMALOUS CATHODIC BEHAVIOR OF METALS WITH HIGH HYDROGEN OVERPOTENTIAL - THALLIUM IN ACIDIC SOLUTIONS								RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY				31	9			921	929						SEP 1995	1995	Possible reasons for distortions of the shape of cathodic polarization curves and emergence of hysteresis in them are considered for a number of mercury-like metals. These phenomena are shown to be determined by the metal nature (principally, by its chemical properties and anodic behavior). Specifically, with T1, the reasons for the distortions apparently differ from those with Cd and ph, which are chemically less active: high self-dissolution rate of T1 with oxygen depolarization, as well as possible chemical interaction with water, produce a considerable quantity of T1(+) ions in solution. The rate of their discharge at low overpotentials eta is higher than that of hydrogen evolution. The corresponding region in the polarization curve, which has a gradually increasing slope, and the Tafel region with a slope of about 135 mV at high overpotentials are characterized by a qualitatively different pH dependence, which fits the dow discharge theory only at high overpotentials. Kinetic parameters of the hydrogen evolution reaction on thallium refined in this work are inconsistent with the simplified correlation dependences for hydrogen evolution on various metals. The data obtained also show that electrochemical properties of TI-Ga and T1 differ despite a substantial near-surface segregation of T1 in the Ll-Ga alloy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1023-1935			WOS:A1995RY69700011

A reactive separation process for pre-combustion CO2 capture employing oxygen-blown coal gasifier off-gas								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				420						127694	10.1016/j.cej.2020.127694		JUN 2021		SEP 15 2021	2021	We present here an experimental study of a reactive separation system, consisting of a membrane reactor (MR) and an adsorptive reactor (AR) operating in tandem, with the MR's reject stream serving as the AR's feed. We investigate the feasibility of applying this MR-AR system for high-purity H2 production and simultaneous CO2 capture via the water gas shift (WGS) reaction in the context of Integrated Gas Combined Cycle (IGCC) power generation employing oxygen-blown gasifier syngas from biomass and coal. We previously studied this MR-AR system for the IGCC process employing air-blown gasifier syngas, for which it demonstrated good performance, attaining high conversion exceeding equilibrium, producing ultra-pure H2 for power generation, and a CO2 stream ready for sequestration. In this study, we focus on oxygen-blown gasifier off-gas that contains no N2, with composition distinctly different from the air-blown gasifier syngas which has a large N2 content. We employ a carbon molecular sieve membrane (CMSM), a commercial sour-shift WGS catalyst, and a hydrotalcite (HTC) adsorbent. We carried out experiments to determine membrane performance and to identify promising operating conditions in an IGCC-relevant environment. The CMSM proved robust during a long-term (-344 hr) experimental run under high temperature and pressure maintaining a high He/N2 selectivity (-170). Multi-cycle runs were carried out during which the MR-AR system displayed superior performance to that of a packed-bed reactor (PBR), by producing a H2 product with higher purity than that from the PBR which can be directly usable in power generation. Therefore, the findings from this study demonstrate the ability of the MR-AR system to operate stably for a broad range of gasifier off-gas compositions, and indicate its potential for integration into IGCC plants for power generation with CO2 capture.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664255000004

Here we discuss the fundamental principles of the XAS method and describe the progress in the instrumentation and data analysis approaches undertaken for deciphering X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra. Recent usages of XAS in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, with emphasis on examples concerning electrocatalysis, will be presented. The latter is a rapidly developing field with immense industrial applications but also unique challenges in terms of the experimental characterization restrictions and advanced modeling approaches required. This review will highlight the new insight that can be gained with XAS on complex real-world electrocatalysts including their working mechanisms and the dynamic processes taking place in the course of a chemical reaction. More specifically, we will discuss applications of in situ and operando XAS to probe the catalyst's interactions with the environment (support, electrolyte, ligands, adsorbates, reaction products, and intermediates) and its structural, chemical, and electronic transformations as it adapts to the reaction conditions.									135	9	0	0	5	1	138			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000613131500007	32986414

Nickel chloride, nickel nitrate and nickel acetate were used as the precursors. More Ni2+ ions intercalate into the interlayer of TNT when nickel chloride is used as the precursor. In the calcination process, the titanate transforms into anatase TiO2, and Ni2+ ions are reduced and doped partly in TiO2 and titanate. The Ni2+ ions intercalated into TNT inner can promote the phase transformation, growth of metal Ni particles and the Ni2+ doping. The formed Ni particles can be oxidized in air to form core/shell Ni@NiO structure. The Ni2+ doping promotes the formation of oxygen defects and increases the conductivity of TNT. The photocatalytic activity of Eosin Y-sensitized nickel-modified TNT for hydrogen evolution was investigated. The TNT modified with nickel chloride exhibit higher activity, which can be attributed to the higher conductivity and more effective formation of Ni@NiO structure.

J	Samuilov, VD; Fedorenko, TA								Lag phase of CO2-dependent O-2 evolution by illuminated Anabaena variabilis cells								BIOCHEMISTRY-MOSCOW				64	6			610	619						JUN 1999	1999	The steady-state rate of CO2-dependent O-2 evolution by Anabaena variabilis cells in response to illumination was established after a lag phase. The lag phase was shortened (1) in cells incubated with glucose as an oxidizable substrate and (2) upon an increase in light intensity. The lag phase was absent during electron transfer from H2O to p-benzoquinone (in combination with ferricyanide) involving Photosystem II. A lag was observed during electron transfer from H2O to methyl viologen involving Photosystems II and I, but not for electron transfer from N,N,N:N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (in combination with ascorbate) to methyl viologen involving only Photosystem I. The lag phases of the light-induced H2O -> CO2 and H2O -> methyl viologen electron transfer reactions showed the same temperature dependences at 10-30 degrees C. The lag was prevented by 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea at concentrations that caused partial inhibition of photosynthetic O-2 evolution. Retardation of cell respiration by a combination of CN- and benzylhydroxamate shortened the lag phase of the H2O -> methyl viologen electron transfer. It is concluded that the lag phase is associated with the electron transfer step between Photosystem II and Photosystem I common for the photosynthetic and respiratory chains and is due to the stimulation of cell respiration during the initial period of illumination as a consequence of an increase in the reduced plastoquinone pool and to subsequent retardation of respiration resulting from the transition of the electron transfer chain to the competitive pathway involving Photosystem I.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0006-2979			WOS:000081102500002	10395973

Two sources of endogenous hydrogen peroxide in Escherichia coli								MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY				75	6			1389	1401		10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07059.x				MAR 2010	2010	P>Mechanisms of hydrogen peroxide generation in Escherichia coli were investigated using a strain lacking scavenging enzymes. Surprisingly, the deletion of many abundant flavoenzymes that are known to autoxidize in vitro did not substantially lessen overall H2O2 formation. However, H2O2 production diminished by 25-30% when NadB turnover was eliminated. The flavin-dependent desaturating dehydrogenase, NadB uses fumarate as an electron acceptor in anaerobic cells. Experiments showed that aerobic NadB turnover depends upon its oxidation by molecular oxygen, with H2O2 as a product. This reaction appears to be mechanistically adventitious. In contrast, most desaturating dehydrogenases are associated with the respiratory chain and deliver electrons to fumarate anaerobically or oxygen aerobically without the formation of toxic by-products. Presumably, NadB can persist as an H2O2-generating enzyme because its flux is limited. The anaerobic respiratory enzyme fumarate reductase uses a flavoprotein subunit that is homologous to NadB and accordingly forms substantial H2O2 upon aeration. This tendency is substantially suppressed by cytochrome oxidase. Thus cytochrome d oxidase, which is prevalent among anaerobes, may diminish intracellular H2O2 formation by the anaerobic respiratory chain, whenever these organisms encounter oxygen. These two examples reveal biochemical and physiological arrangements through which evolution has minimized the rate of intracellular oxidant formation.									120	1	2	0	114	0	124			0950-382X	1365-2958		WOS:000275396200005	20149100
