J	Kao-Wen Mao								ECM study in a closed-cell system I. NaClO3								Journal of the Electrochemical Society				118	11			1870	6						Nov. 1971	1971	The electrode reactions involved in electrochemical machining (ECM) of mild steel in NaClO3 were studied in a closed cell system at constant current. The cathodic reaction is found to be essentially hydrogen evolution. At the anode, in addition to the metal removal, significant amounts of oxygen are produced and the total anodic current efficiency for Fe++ plus O2 formation is about 100%. Reduction of NaClO3 to NaCl during ECM is caused by the chemical reaction between NaClO3 and Fe++. The experimental results concerning the anodic process are qualitatively explained by the presence of porous anodic oxide films.									1	0	0		0	0	1			0013-4651			INSPEC:354306

Oxygen-doped carbon materials with high ORR activity and H2O2 selectivity have been considered as the promising catalysts, however, there is still a lack of direct experimental evidence to identify true active sites at the complex carbon surface. Herein, we propose a chemical titration strategy to decipher the oxygen-doped carbon nanosheet (OCNS900) catalyst for 2 e(-) ORR. The OCNS900 exhibits outstanding 2 e(-) ORR performances with onset potential of 0.825 V (vs. RHE), mass activity of 14.5 A g(-1) at 0.75 V (vs. RHE) and H2O2 production rate of 770 mmol g(-1) h(-1) in flow cell, surpassing most reported carbon catalysts. Through selective chemical titration of C=O, C-OH, and COOH groups, we found that C=O species contributed to the most electrocatalytic activity and were the most active sites for 2 e(-) ORR, which were corroborated by theoretical calculations.									52	3	0	0	5	0	52			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000662735800001	33982396

H2O adsorbed onto the surface was oxidized to form OH then O; the latter reacted with a surface bridging O to form O-2 which in turn reacted with another surface O to form O-3. The final step of the mechanisms occurs via an Eley-Rideal style interaction where surface O-2 desorbs and then attacks the surface bridging oxygen, forming O-3. A different reaction pathway via an O3H intermediate was found less favoured both thermodynamically and kinetically. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The surface morphology, purity and crystalline structure of the porous NPG-islands were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. Cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry methods were used for electrochemical studies and the electrocatalytic activity of the NPG-islands surface was investigated towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Electrochemical results revealed exceptional ORR activity of the NPG-islands evaluated by the shift of the onset potential towards less negative values compared to bare GC (0.55 V) and Au (0.25 V) electrodes, respectively, with a 3-fold increased current density in neutral PBS solution (pH 7). Rotating-disk measurements indicate a direct conversion of oxygen to water via a four-electron reduction pathway. The electrocatalytic activity was also evaluated for HER in 0.5 mol L-1 H2SO4 solution and a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2 )at a very low overpotential of -0.075 V was obtained, which is similar to bulk Pt performance. The plausible mechanism of the HER was realized from the Tafel plot and the obtained slope of 46 mV dec(-1) suggests the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism takes place in such electrochemical process. Furthermore, the durability of the catalyst was also studied and exceptional stability was observed in cyclic voltammetry (up to 2000 cycles) and chronopotentiometry (at 10 mA cm(-2) for 19 h).

Environmental friendly metal free semiconducting graphitic carbon nitride, which can be synthesized via simple pyrolysis of cheap industrial resources at low cost, with visible light photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, hydrogen peroxide production and reduction of carbon dioxide has been intensively studied in recent ten years. On the way of developing highly active photocatalysts, publications focusing on graphitic carbon nitride have been dramatically increased especially in recent five years. These researches have revealed some key issues, which includes morphology, atomic composition, basal plane structure and defects, composites and type of co-catalysts, influence photocatalytic activity of graphitic carbon nitride based materials from different aspects. These aspects include light absorption, charge separation/migration and surface reactions, which can be categorized into band structure and surface activity characters of graphitic carbon nitride based materials. This review is focusing on engineering band and surface of graphitic carbon nitride for artificial photosynthesis. Through reviewing the recent progress on graphitic carbon nitride based artificial photosynthesis researches, it may provide more comprehensive and in-depth understanding for further designing of highly activity photocatalysts based on graphitic carbon nitride.									35	3	0	0	5	0	36			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000447741800080

Benefiting from the fast water dissociation kinetics on NiCo-LDH and favorable H recombination on Ru, the resultant Ru-NiCo-LDH shows an extremely low HER overpotential of 28 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1). This superior catalytic activity can be ascribed to its high charge transfer ability and to the synergistic effect of the highly dispersed Ru and the NiCo-LDH. Moreover, we also found that the oxidized Ru incorporated in NiCo-LDH was entirely reduced to Ru-0 under hydrogen-evolution conditions, which suggests that Ru-0 is the true catalytically active phase responsible for the outstanding HER performance.									36	3	0	0	3	0	37			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000464134900005

The corresponding N-edge effect, dopant effect, and C-edge ring-closing effect are evaluated with the ORR evolution on different bonding environments, including pristine CoZnN6(OH), nanoribbon (NR) along zigzag direction, substitution of carbon/oxygen (C/O substitution), and C-edge ring-closing configurations. OH-ligand is shown to significantly improve the ORR activities for all the considered structures. Especially, C-substituted CoZnN6(OH), NR-CoZnN5O(OH) and CoZnN6(OH) with C-edge-effect exhibit obviously reduced overpotentials (eta(lim)=0.28, 0.48 and 0.41 V) of rate-determining steps among all the considered nine candidates. By plotting the relationship between the limiting potentials (U-lim) and free energies of intermediate *OH (Delta G(OH*)), two prior catalysts of pristine-CoZnN5C(OH) and defect-CoZnN6CH(OH) are located near the top of the volcano curve with higher U-lim=0.95 and 0.82 V than Pt(111) (U-lim=0.80 V), implying that C-substitution could facilitate ORR performance in pristine- and defect-CoZnN6(OH) bonding situation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000772496800001	35170167

For transition metal doped Fe-based perovskite oxides, the exsolved metal nanoparticles are usually Fe-based alloys. Herein, we in-situ exsolved single Co metal from A-site defective La0.95Fe0.8Co0.2O3 (LFCO) via a thermal reduction method above 600 degrees C. At lower temperature (500 degrees C), the species exsolved from LFCO is CoFe alloy, while the temperature rises above 600 degrees C, the composition of metal nanoparticles changes to single Co metal by cation exchange between Fe in metal nanoparticles and Co in perovskite oxide, forming Co/LFCO composite. This phenomenon could be owing to the higher co-segregation energy of Co than Fe cations, and LaFeO3 is thermodynamically more stable at high temperatures. As a result, Co/LFCO shows largely improved conductivity than CoFe/LFCO counterpart, and thereof enhanced activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our work has positive implication for designing a wide range of efficient electrocatalysts by in-situ tuning the composition of surface nanoparticles. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We have synthesized a double perovskite (A(2)BB'O-6) with different cations in A, B, and B' sites, namely, ((La15Sr0.5)-Sr-.)(A)(Ni0.5Mn0.5)(B)(Ni0.5Ru0.5)(B)O-6 (LSNMR), which displays an outstanding OER/ORR bifunctional performance. The composition and structure of the oxide has been determined by powder X-ray diffraction, powder neutron diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy to be monoclinic with the space group P2(1)/n and with cationic ordering between the ions in the B and B' sites. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy suggests that LSNMR presents a configuration of similar to Ni2+, similar to Mn4+, and similar to Ru5+. This bifunctional catalyst is endowed with high ORR and OER activities in alkaline media, with a remarkable bifunctional index value of similar to 0.83 V (the difference between the potentials measured at -1 mA cm(-2) for the ORR and +10 mA cm(-2) for the OER). The ORR onset potential (E-onset) of 0.94 V is among the best reported to date in alkaline media for ORR-active perovskites. The ORR mass activity of LSNMR is 1.1 A g(-1) at 0.9 V and 7.3 A g(-1) at 0.8 V. Furthermore, LSNMR is stable in a wide potential window down to 0.05 V. The OER potential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is 1.66 V. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the high ORR/OER activity of LSNMR is related to the presence of active Mn sites for the ORR- and Ru-active sites for the OER by virtue of the high symmetry of the respective reaction steps on those sites. In addition, the material is stable to ORR cycling and also considerably stable to OER cycling.									76	2	0	0	2	1	75			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000472683300019	31117426

Density functional theory calculations reveal that the highly unsaturated Ru sites on the high-index facets can be oxidized gradually and reduce the energy barrier of rate-determining steps. On the other hand, the Cu dopants can alter the electronic structures so as to further improve the intrinsic OER activity.									221	7	0	0	16	0	221			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000438709400026	29870585

The observations in the present work indicate, consistent with the surface film model, that the formation of a continuous PbSO4 + alpha-PbO2 film on the surface of the lead alloy in the presence of cobalt ions hinders further oxidation of the metal. The protectiveness of the film is dynamic in the steady state; the film is continuously forming and dissolving. Also studied was the potential of the oxygen evolution reaction on alpha-PbO2 and beta-PbO2 in 170 g L-1 H2SO4 with and without cobalt ions. The steady state potential for oxygen evolution on beta-PbO2 in 170 g L-1 H2SO4 at 285 A m(-2) decreased in the presence of cobalt ions and the steady state potential of beta-PbO2 was essentially the same as that of (i) the Pb-Ca-Sn alloy and (ii) alpha-PbO2. The implication is that the potential of the Pb-Ca-Sn alloy is determined by the alpha-PbO2 and/or beta-PbO2 on its surface.									14	2	0	0	1	0	16			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000254089800019

The development of highly efficient and inexpensive oxygen electrocatalysts as replacements for precious metal-based catalysts is vitally important for large-scale practical application in the future. A bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst based on FeCo nanoparticles/N-doped carbon core-shell spheres supported on N-doped graphene sheets was prepared via one-step pyrolysis of graphitic carbon nitride and acetylacetonates. The optimized product exhibited an oxygen electrode activity of 0.87 V and excellent durability. The remarkable performance is mainly attributed to the synergetic effect arising from the FeCo nanoparticles and N-doped carbon shell. This study introduces an inexpensive and simple way to develop highly active bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.									67	6	0	0	4	0	67			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000404396600012

Here, carbons in various forms are chosen as substrates for uniform dispersion of alpha-MnO2 to form air electrode catalysts to evaluate the influences of carbon types on the catalytic activities of the ORR and OER (oxygen evolution reaction).

Owing to the positive synergistic effects of 3D hierarchical NCNT networks and popcorn-like Co3O4 species, NAC@Co3O4/NCNTs/CNF shows a record outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction performance (HER; the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) is just 76 mV) and wonderful stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR; 73% retention of initial ORR activity after 70 h). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the chemical interaction between the popcorn-like Co3O4 species and NCNTs benefit the chemisorption of hydrogen and oxygen-containing intermediates, thus accelerating the performance of ORR, OER, and HER. Furthermore, we assembled NAC@Co3O4/NCNTs/CNF as a rechargeable Zn-air battery and an overall water splitting device, displaying a maximum power density of 267.58 mW cm(-2) and almost 100% faradaic efficiency, which provides a promising prospect for surpassing traditional trifunctional electrocatalysts. It is expected that this finding will offer a new concept for synthesizing highly efficient trifunctional materials and applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2052-1553			WOS:000790376100001

Many first-row transition metal complexes have been shown to be active for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Metal ions play crucial roles in these catalytic processes, but the activity dependence on the nature of metal ions has been rarely studied due to the difficulty to compare metal complexes with different coordination environments. We herein reported the synthesis of a series of metal complexes of azido-substituted porphyrin (1), in which metal ions have very similar coordination environments. By grafting 1-M (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) onto alkynefunctionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through the same covalent connection, the resulted hybrids 1-M@CNT were all active and robust for both electrocatalytic HER and OER in alkaline aqueous solutions. Among these hybrids, 1-Fe@CNT displayed the highest electrocatalytic activity for HER, while 1Co@CNT was the most active one for OER. Moreover, a two-electrode water electrolysis cell assembled with 1-Fe@CNT as the cathode and 1-Co@CNT as the anode required smaller applied bias potential by 210 mV to get 10 mA/cm(2) current density as compared to that assembled with Pt/C and Ir/C with the same amount of metal loading. This work is significant to correlate HER and OER activity with the nature of first-row transition metal ions and to highlight promising potential applications of molecular electrocatalysis in water splitting.

Although much progress has been made in recent years, developing active, stable, and cost-effective OER electrocatalysts is still challenging. The layered MoS2, based on Earth-abundant elements, is widely explored as a promising hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst but exhibits poor OER activity. Here, we report a facile strategy to improve the sluggish OER of MoS2 through co-doping MoS2 nanosheets with Fe and Co atoms. The synergistic effect obtained by adjusting the Co/Fe ratio in the Fe-Co doped MoS2 induces electronic and structural modifications and a richer active surface area morphology resulting in a relatively low OER overpotential of 380 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)). The electronic modulation upon doping was further supported by DFT calculations that show favorable interaction with the OER intermediate species, thus reducing the energy barrier for the OER. This work paves the way for future strategies for tailoring the electronic properties of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) to activate the structure for the sluggish OER with the assistance of non-noble-metal materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000870315400001	36263883

In this work, we develop a strategy using a self-supported MOF nanorod arrays, [Ni-3(BTC)(2)/NiF] as bifunctional catalyst for integrating energy-saving HER and replacement of OER by the thermodynamically more favorable electro-oxidation of sodium gluconate (ECSG) to high-value glucaric acid. The Ni-3(BTC)(2)/NiF only require a cell voltage of 1.22 V to drive 100 mA cm(-2) in KOH solution with sodium gluconate (SG), which is significantly reduced by 400 mV relative to the alkaline solution without SG. The assembled [Ni-3(BTC)(2)/NiF parallel to Ni-3(BTC)(2)/NiF] couple behaves nearly 100% Faradic efficiency for HER at the cathode and SG conversion of 100% with glucaric acid selectivity of 97.9% at the anode, and long-term durability. Such an integration of HER and oxidative biomass to high-value-added chemical provides a new way to maximize the energy conversion efficiency.

Either a bimetallic compound or a heterostructure could be developed utilizing these elements however; the widely utilized hydrothermal reaction would favor the formation of the later one. Herein, a unique triethanolamine- assisted strategy was adopted to facilitate the formation of S-doped FeMoO4 instead of an iron oxide/molybdenum sulfide heterostructure. Through electrochemical investigation revelaed that the said assistance was crucial in achieving excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity. The activity of the optimally doped FeMoO4 (especially towards oxygen evolution reaction) was superior to most of the recently reported transition-metal-based electrocatalysts. Moreover, it achieved 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting at 1.561 V, which was similar to 60 mV lower than that required for the RuO2-Pt/C couple. A very high Faradaic efficiency (95.88%) and operational robustness was associated with the overall water splitting catalyzed by S-doped FeMoO4.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Restricted by the thermodynamic limitations of the catalytic active center for OER and the reaction kinetics limitations induced by the structure of the electrocatalysts, the development of OWS catalysts requires more effort. Herein, a porous carbon-based bimetal electrocatalyst of Mo0.84Ni0.16-Mo2C@NC nanosphere is prepared by hydrothermal treatment of PMo12@PVP@Zn/Ni-ZIF which is synthesized via one-pot self-assembled hydrothermal method. Our study confirms that the Mo-Ni alloy and Mo2C nanoparticles homogeneously distribute in nitrogen-rich carbon-based materials. Furthermore, the porous structure exposes rich active sites and increases the effective specific area for redox reactions. The obtained Mo0.84Ni0.16-Mo2C@NC catalyst requires low overpotentials of 151 and 285 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) towards the water reduction and oxidation in 1 M KOH solution, respectively, and possesses good catalytic stability for one day.

H2O) is identified to be active photocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to facilitate hydrogen generation from water photolysis. It has been synthesized through a facile and cost-effective solution-based precipitation method using earth-abundant materials. Its highly porous structure and large surface areas are found to be responsible for the excellent electrochemical performance featuring a low OER onset at similar to 550 rnVscE and high current density in alkaline condition. Unlike traditional cobalt-based spinel oxides (Co3O4, NiCo2O4) and phosphate (Co Pi, Co(PO3)(2)) electrocatalysts, with proper energy band alignment for lightassisted water oxidation, cobalt potassium phosphate hydrate also exhibits robust visible-light response, generating a photocurrent density of 200 mu A cm(-2) at 0.7 VscE. This catalyst could thus be considered as a promising candidate to perform photoelectrochemical water splitting. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, the understanding of l-OR chemistry remains elusive, and a critical question is the structural effect on the stability of l-OR reactions. Herein, the coupling between l-OR and structure dimensionality is studied. We reveal that the evolution of the oxygen-lattice structure upon l-OR in Li-rich TM oxides which have a three-dimensional (3D)-disordered cation framework is relatively stable, which is in direct contrast to the clearly distorted oxygen-lattice framework in Li-rich oxides which have a two-dimensional (2D)/3D-ordered cation structure. Our results highlight the role of structure dimensionality in stabilizing the oxygen lattice in reversible l-OR, which broadens the horizon for designing high-energy-density Li-rich cathode oxides with stable l-OR chemistry.									75	3	0	0	1	0	76			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000462655400038	30710397

In the solar field test at CSIRO, the O-2-releasing step was examined, and the data obtained by the test were analyzed using an FEM simulation software (COMSOL multiphysics) in terms of concentration flux, reaction temperature, oxygen releasing reaction, and heat conductance.

Herein we report the synthesis, characterization and electrochemical evaluation of highly active nickel nanoclusters (Ni NCs) for water oxidation at low overpotential. These atomically precise and monodisperse Ni NCs are characterized by using UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, single crystal X-ray diffraction and mass spectrometry. The molecular formulae of these Ni NCs are found to be Ni-4(PET)(8) and Ni-6(PET)(12) and are highly active electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution without any pre-conditioning. Ni-4(PET)(8) are slightly better catalysts than Ni-6(PET)(12) which initiate oxygen evolution at an amazingly low overpotential of similar to 1.51 V (vs. RHE; eta approximate to 280 mV). The peak oxygen evolution current density (J) of similar to 150 mA cm(-2) at 2.0 V (vs. RHE) with a Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1) is observed using Ni-4(PET)(8). These results are comparable to the state-of-the-art RuO2 electrocatalyst, which is highly expensive and rare compared to Ni-based materials. Sustained oxygen generation for several hours with an applied current density of 20 mA cm(-2) demonstrates the long-term stability and activity of these Ni NCs towards electrocatalytic water oxidation. This unique approach provides a facile method to prepare cost-effective, nanoscale and highly efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation.									58	2	0	0	2	0	60			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000375799900029	27109550

The convex shape of the bubble leads to shock focusing, which generates spots of high pressure and temperature. Pressure and temperature levels are sufficient to ignite the stoichiometric H-2-O-2 gas mixture. Shock Mach numbers between Ma = 2.13 and Ma = 2.90 induce different reaction wave types (deflagration and detonation). Depending on the shock Mach number low-pressure reactions or high-pressure chemistry are prevalent. A deflagration wave is observed for the lowest shock Mach number. Shock Mach numbers of Ma = 2.30 or higher ignite the gas mixture after a short induction time, followed by a detonation wave. An intermediate shock strength of Ma = 2.19 induces deflagration that transitions into a detonation wave. Richtmyer-Meshkov and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability evolutions exhibit a high sensitivity to the reaction wave type, which in turn has distinct effects on the spatial and temporal evolution of the gas bubble. We observe a significant reduction in mixing for both reaction wave types, wherein detonation shows the strongest effect. Furthermore, we observe a very good agreement with experimental observations.

Herein, 3D nanosheets consisting of N-doped carbon conglutinated CoFe alloy nanoparticles grown on carbon cloth (CoFe@NC/CC) have been prepared through simple electrodeposition and subsequent thermal decomposition. The cathode showed excellent activity and stability for the bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), due to the synergic effect of the CoFe alloy and the N-doped carbon conglutinated structures. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the introduction of the N-doped carbon structures can greatly weaken the O-2 adsorption energy on the CoFe alloy nanoparticles, thus enhancing the bifunctional ORR/OER activity of the catalyst. As a binder-less self-supporting electrode, the assembled liquid ZAB showed a high open circuit voltage of 1.469 V, and it could be stably cycled for more than 400 cycles with a charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.77 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), surpassing the performance of Pt/C + RuO2/C benchmarks and other reported CoFe-based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the all-solid-state ZAB was shown to be a battery with good flexibility for wearable electronics, satisfying the requirements of next-generation sustainable active electronics.									32	4	0	0	3	0	32			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000581598800033

The electrocatalytic properties of the hydroxide coating, namely an oxygen-evolving reaction (OER) onset overpotential of 330 mV and overpotential of only 440 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), are well comparable to some of the most efficient materials used for the OER process. This electrolytic transformation process represents a facile pathway for the fabrication of electrochemically and electrocatalytically active coatings, and is potentially transferrable to several other systems. This approach is an attractive alternative to the commonly utilized, energy intensive pyrolysis, where heating the samples to temperatures above 600 degrees C is common to induce full transformation into electroactive catalysts.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000486872900001

The effect of adsorption of different water-like species on the geometry, binding energies, vibrational spectra and the electronic structure of the surface are discussed. The study shows that although the hydrogen evolution reaction requires a small amount of energy to become energetically favourable, the over potential for activating the oxygen evolution reaction is quite high. The results of our calculations provide insight as to why a high voltage is required in experiments to activate the water-splitting reaction, whereas previous studies of gallium oxide predicted very low activation energies for other energetically more favourable facets. Application of this work to studies of GaN-based chemical sensors with gallium oxide surfaces shows that it is possible to select the gate bias so that the sensors are not influenced by water-splitting reactions. It was also found that in the region where water splitting does not occur, the surface can exist in two states, that is, water or hydroxyl terminated.									10	0	0	0	0	0	9			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000434074600020	29520863

In this regard, nickel-based OER catalysts with specific properties have drawn widespread attention. Herein, we prepared core-shell structured hierarchically mesoporous NiO microspheres through the thermal decomposition of Ni(OH)(2) microspheres, which were synthesized through a one-pot hydrothermal method. The obtained NiO microspheres possess numerous mesopores, a high BET surface area, and 2D nanosheet-like shells, which largely promote mass/charge transportation and reduce ion transport pathways. By increasing the molar ratio of HMTA/Ni2+, the thickness of the outer nanosheet-like shell can be varied in the range of 0-35 nm. In particular, the NiO-300/r = 2 microspheres possess excellent properties for OER (overpotential of 360 mV to reach 10 mV cm(-2)), compared with previously-reported Ni-based materials. Furthermore, improved activity with an overpotential of 340 mV was reached by introducing Co.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			2052-1553			WOS:000432586100027

Our catalyst is prepared by the anodic electrolysis of calcium phosphate/rGO mixture loaded on indium-tin-oxide (ITO) in Co2+ aqueous solution. TEM, XPS and XRD experiments confirm that the crystal phase of calcium phosphate (CaP) is transferred into an amorphous phase of calcium oxide with phosphate (5.06 at%) after anodic electrolysis. Additionally, the main cation component of calcium is replaced by cobalt ion. The current-voltage characteristics of CoCaP/rGO showed a shoulder peak at 1.10 V vs. NHE, which originated from Co2+ to higher oxidation states (Co3+ or Co4+) and a strong wave from water oxidation higher +1.16 V vs. NHE at neutral condition (pH 7). CoCaP and CoCaP/rGO showed 4.8 and 10 mA/cm(2) at 0.47 V of overpotential, respectively. The enhanced OER catalytic activity of CoCaP/rGO arises from the synergetic interaction between the amorphous phase of CoCaP and electric conducting graphene sheets.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000688907300001

In potentiodynamic experiments the total amount of dissolved gold increases by a factor of 4.5 when the temperature is increased from 25 to 75 degrees C. Moreover, the previously reported correlation between the onset of oxide formation and the commencement of the dissolution process is found to be correct for all studied temperatures. Negative shift in the advent of oxidation is accompanied by a similar shift in the dissolution onset potential. Similarly, the dissolution rate rises significantly with temperature during potentiostatic and galvanostatic polarization steps. A correlation between the temperature-dependent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and gold dissolution is found. Arrhenius plots for the OER and gold dissolution are used to obtain information on the apparent activation energy EA for both processes. It is found that for OER and Au dissolution E-A = 57 kJ mol(-1). The later finding suggests that there is a common intermediate for both reactions, the formation of which constitutes the rate-determining step. (C) The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS.

The initial Pt concentration, reduction time and presence of additional reducing agents were varied, and as-synthesized nanocomposites were characterized thoroughly by XRD, EDX, SEM and XPS analysis and by electrochemical methods. Composites containing 14 wt% Pt showed HER with an onset potential of -75.9 mV and a current density of -10 mA cm(-2) achieved at -226 mV. The spontaneous deposition of PtNPs on MXene improved the electrocatalytic properties over using an external reducing agent to form PtNP, which was explained based on the different rates of oxidation of Ti in the initial MXene support. Furthermore, good stability of the electrode modified by the MX-Pt was achieved without any polymeric binder and the HER reaction achieved only a negligible decrease over 3 000 potentiodynamic cycles.

Herein, porous NiO/NiCo2O4 nanofibers with superior electrocatalytic performance are synthesized by a facile electrospinning strategy with precursor transition metal salts in nonstoichiometric ratio, which confers the heterostructured NiO/NiCo2O4 with abundant interface-related active sites and electronic transmission channels. Density functional calculation results reveal the chemical bonds easily form between NiO and NiCo2O4 to facilitate the charge transfer, while X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results demonstrate there are abundant Ni3+ and Co3+ species in NiO/NiCo2O4 due to the interfacial engineering. As a result, the NiO/NiCo2O4 porous nanofibers exhibit highly efficient and durable performances of OER and ORR in KOH solution, including a lower overpotential of 357 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (OER) and half-wave potential of 0.73 V (ORR) than that of the individual. What's more, the NiO/NiCo2O4-based ZA battery displays excellent specific capacities of 814.4 mA h g(-1), and good cycling stability of 175 h. Additionally, the flexible ZA battery displays a long cycling life of 14 h and decent flexibility. This work shows that construction of the heterostructure could provide a feasible method to optimize their electrocatalytic performance and make them widely used in power source devices.									44	4	0	0	2	0	45			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000535246100050	32354219

Isolated intact chloroplasts of such leaflets suspended in a medium containing NaHCO3 and glycerate 3-phosphate, on irradiation with blue (lambda 448 nm) or red (lambda 679 nm) light also produced oxidation and consumed O-18(2) from the gas phase. The two reactions were saturated at the same quantum fluence rates. Uptake of (18)oxygen was not affected by inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration (alternative pathway included), such as rotenone (5 x 10(-5) M), antimycin A (5 x 10(-6) M), KCN (10(-3) M), SHAM (10(-3) M), or propylgallate (10(-3) M). It was, however, absent, when photosynthetic (16)oxygen evolution was completely inhibited by DCMU (10(-5) M). DBMIB (10(-5) M), assumed to prevent electron flow from plastoquinone pool to the cytochrome b(6)/f-complex, suppressed photosynthetic oxygen evolution, but did not impair uptake of O-18(2). A Similar result was obtained at application of 4 x 10(-5) M antimycin A.The data are interpreted to show a drain off to molecular oxygen of light-excited electrons from the photosynthetic electron transport chain at the site of plastoquinone pool during photosynthesis. This corresponds to chlororespiration, originally described for Chlamydomonas in darkness by Bennoun (1982). It is discussed, whether O-2-uptake during photosynthesis is an additional means for providing ATP for photosynthetic CO2-reduction by increasing the proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0939-5075			WOS:000080187900011

Layered double hydroxide (LDH) with special configuration usually shows a highly electrochemical activity and become a desirable functional material for OER. In this work, carbon nanofibers embedded with Co nanoparticles have been prepared via an electrospinning and carbonization process, which can be served as a conductive support for the growth of NiFe LDH nanosheets through an electrodeposition route to produce a hierarchical 3D structure (denoted as 3D core-shell Co-C@NiFe LDH nanofibers). Owing to the high conductivity, large surface area and strong electron transfer between NiFe LDH nanosheets and Co-C nanofibers, the as-prepared 3D core-shell Co-C@NiFe LDH nanofibrous catalyst shows an excellent OER performance with an overpotential of only 249 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 57.9 mV dec? 1, demonstrating an outstanding electrocatalytic activity for water oxidation. Furthermore, the 3D core-shell Co-C@NiFe LDH nanofibers also exhibit a superior long-term stability, with no obvious decrease in current density after nearly 190 h testing. Hence, the low-cost 3D coreshell Co-C@NiFe LDH nanofibrous electrocatalyst with an outstanding OER performance offers a novel chance for practical electrochemical water splitting application.									32	2	0	0	4	0	32			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000643728400001

Coupling the HER with electro-Fenton instead of oxygen evolution is an effective method. For high-efficiency electro-Fenton, herein, the electron structure of CoP/C was optimized due to the doping of Fe to improve the carrier density of CoFeP/C and produce more hydroxyl radicals (.OH), which was confirmed by both characterization and density functional theory calculation (DFT) analysis. Meanwhile, CoP/C exhibits excellent HER activity with an overpotential of 42.1 mV (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 59 mV dec- 1 because of the favorable electron transfer vector spiny structure and the high content of P element. The electrochemical flow reactor employing CoP/C for cathodic H2 and adopting CoFeP/C for anodic electro-Fenton requires only a low constant voltage of 1.68 V. For optimal electrode adjustment, electro-Fenton can be considered as an ideal oxidation reaction to promote the energy efficiency in the rationally designed reactor. Combination HER with electro-Fenton supports that our designed reactor has high potential in the fields of sustainable energy and environmental remediation.									23	1	0	0	2	0	23			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000649695700002

Ni3FeN is always used as an excellent electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but its hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance is always negative and seldom concerned. Here, we improve the HER activity and maintain the excellent OER activity of Ni3FeN to realize the efficient overall water splitting by doping with molybdenum. The Mo-doped Ni3FeN shows a significantly improved HER activity with a low overpotential of 69 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) as well as an excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 250 mV at 20 mA cm(-2). The improved HER activity can be ascribed to the favorable absorption/desorption process of H intermediate and improved conductivity, which was verified by the density functional theory calculation results of free energy of adsorbed H (Delta G(H)*), the position of d-band center toward Fermi level and density of state near Fermi level. A two-electrode system that has Mo-doped Ni3FeN electrode as both cathode and anode requires only a low cell voltage of 1.554 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits good stability for overall water splitting. The two-electrode system can also be powered by a commercial AA battery (similar to 1.5 V), which is better than most of the bifunctional electrocatalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The two yields were measured as a function of background irradiance in the steady-state and following a transition from light to darkness. During steady-state illumination at moderate irradiance levels, Y-O2 and Phi(PS) (II) followed each other, suggesting a close coupling between the oxidation of water and QA reduction (Falkowski et al. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 933: 432-443). Following a light-to-dark transition, however, the relationship between QA reduction and the fraction of PS II reaction centers capable of evolving O-2 became temporarily uncoupled. Phi(PS) (II) recovered to the preillumination levels within 5-10 s, while the Y-O2 required up to 60 s to recover under aerobic conditions. The recovery of Y-O2 was independent of the redox state of Q(A), but was accompanied by a 30% increase in the functional absorption cross-section of PS II (sigma(PS II)) The hysteresis between Y-O2 and the reduction of Q(A) during the light-to-dark transition was dependent upon the reduction level of the plastoquinone pool and does not appear to be due to a direct radiative charge back-reaction, but rather is a consequence of a transient cyclic electron flow around PS II. The cycle is engaged in vivo only when the plastoquinone pool is reduced. Hence, the plastoquinone pool can act as a clutch that disconnects the oxygen evolution from photochemical charge separation in PS II.									130	0	0	0	111	0	130			0166-8595			WOS:A1996VM63200007	24271480

Fe is essential for the high activity, but the details of how Fe is incorporated into the Ni or Co (oxy)hydroxide structure and affects catalysis remain incompletely understood. This study concerns two different modes of Fe incorporation to form Co(Fe)OxHy, which both yield increased OER activity but result in Fe and Co species that differ in chemical reactivity and electrochemical response. Co(Fe)OxHy films that were cathodically deposited from mixed Co and Fe nitrate solution (co-deposited) result in Fe species that interact strongly with the Co species (as evidenced by an anodic shift in the Co redox wave) and are difficult to leach out under electrochemical conditions. Fe incorporated into a CoOxHy film by cycling in Fe-spiked KOH electrolyte similarly enhance activity, but do not strongly electronically interact with the majority of the Co in the film and are removed by cycling in Fe-free KOH. These results support the hypothesis that co-deposition of Co(Fe)OxHy leads to films where the Co and Fe are mixed within the nanosheet structure and cycling in Fe-spiked KOH incorporates Fe species largely at surface, edge, or defect sites, where they drive OER but do not otherwise significantly modulate the electrochemical response of the Co.									36	0	0	0	0	0	36			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000471314900025	30371020

Titanates, a family of representative two-dimensional materials with negatively charged main layers, are chemically and structurally stable under strongly basic conditions, but they have never been shown to have electrocatalytic activity for HER. Herein, we report that intercalating 3d metal cations, including Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+ ions, into the interlayer regions of titanates yields efficient and robust electrocatalysts for the alkaline HER. The intercalation of 3d metal cations in titanates is achieved by rapid cation-exchange reaction between Na+-containing titanates and 3d metal cations at room temperature. Among the 3d metal-intercalated titanates we synthesize, the Co2+-containing material is found to show the best electrocatalytic activity. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the strong electronic interaction between 3d metal cations and negatively charged main [TiO6](infinity) layers renders good catalytic activity to the outermost oxygen atoms in the [TiO6](infinity) layer, further making 3d metal-intercalated titanate an efficient electrocatalyst for the HER.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000422814400075	29227088

However, there is a lack of a strategy to guide the development of cost-effective antiperovskite nitrides with composition-sensitive function adjustability. Herein, we triggered the low-spin to high-spin transition of Fe3+ in Cu0.5NFe3.5 by partially doping Ni at the Fe sites, enabling Cu0.5NFe3Ni0.5 to significantly accelerate the oxidation of the in situ electrochemically formed amorphous FeNi (oxy)hydroxide redox couple, an initial water oxidation step, as well as subsequent water oxidation. Theoretical calculations indicated that the high-spin Fe3+ induces the formation of a paramagnetic FeNi (oxy)hydroxide catalytic layer on the ferromagnetic Cu0.5NFe3Ni0.5 core to accelerate the OER kinetics, thus Cu0.5NFe3Ni0.5 displays an overpotential of 244 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) as an outstanding OER electrocatalyst, outperforming the benchmark IrO2 catalyst. Our findings are expected to unlock the potential of designing ideal antiperovskite-based electrocatalysts with adjustable spin states for use in the energy conversion and storage fields.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000716552200001

With a careful choice of electrochemical parameters, we were able to obtain samples of La4Ni3O10+/-delta never obtained before. The oxygen stoichiometry can range between 9.78 (delta= -0.22) and 10.12 (delta= 0.12). The oxidized phase, La4Ni3O10.12, was obtained using a galvanostatic mode (I= 20 muA) and the reduced phase, La4Ni3O9.78, using potentiostatic conditions (E= 0.46 V).

Modellization of the passive film/solution (F/S) interface region is proposed on the basis of shapes of Bode plots and Mott-Schottky dependencies. Semiconductor behaviour due to the oxygen nonstoichiometry with Nernstian pH dependence is obtained over almost the whole passive potential region. Passive current densities independent of the electrolyte pH indicate that the corrosion current is determined by a pH independent electric field strength within the space-charge layer. At higher anodic potentials and higher electrolyte pH, due to the surface deprotonation reaction, there is an increased density of basic (MOH(-)) surface groups acting as surface states, and reactants in the first step of OER. Further increase in anodic potential facilitates surface oxidation of (MOH(-)) to (MOH(0)). In the OER potential region, the passivated Fe80B20 electrode acts as a classical oxygen electrode. Comparison of the data with those obtained on the pure Fe passivated under the same conditions, shows the detrimental effect of B on either the corrosion properties of the passive film in the passive potential region, or on the parameters of OER.

However, most of the electrocatalysts are noble metal-based which are very costly and unstable. To counter this, electrochemical water splitting in energy storage systems is been widely applied, using non-noble metal-based nanostructured electrocatalysts. In this work, a novel noble metal-free MoSe2-Ni(OH)(2) nanocomposite electrocatalyst is synthesized using a multi-step hydrothermal technique for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The morphology, structural, chemical composition, and functional features of the synthesized nanomaterials were characterized using different techniques that include scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman analysis. The new developed MoSe2-Ni(OH)(2) nanocomposite combines a high active surface area with a high chemical stability, generating a novel material with a synergistic effect that enhances water splitting process performance. Thus, an outstanding low Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1) is accomplished in the hydrogen evolution reaction. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we develop a self-supporting Co-Ni LDH electrode prepared by in-situ growing ZIF-L(Co)@ZIF-L(Co, Ni) on carbon paper followed by a pseudomorphic transformation. The optimized Co-Ni LDH/carbon paper electrodes (CN2/CP) exhibit excellent electrochemical activity and stability in oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and supercapacitors. The CN-2/CP electrode displays a low overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and superior stability at 40-h chronopotentiometry for OER. For supercapacitor, the CN-2/CP electrode delivers a high specific capacitance of 1346 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and maintains a capacitance of 88.5% after 7000 charge/discharge cycles at 20 A g-1. Based on the physical and chemical characterization results, the high performance originates from the in-situ electrochemical conversion of metal hydroxide, improved conductivity,									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0360-3199	1879-3487		WOS:000793522800010

Iron sulfides have recently emerged as promising candidates of the state-of-art noble metal free electrocatalysts and attracted enormous research interests for their superior catalytic efficiency and high crustal abundance. But research studies on iron sulfides were often plagued by their structure instability and low electronic conductivity. Herein, we report on a uniform carbon coated FeS2 (FeS2@C) nanochain material prepared by a magnetic-field-guided interface coassembly approach. In particular, the Fe3O4 nanospheres as precursors are assembled into chains during polymer coating process in dynamic magnetic field environment, followed by the successive carbonization and sulfidation to generate FeS2@C. The carbon layer not only protects FeS2 from decaying during electrocatalysis but also enhances the catalytic activity owing to the interfacial interaction between metal nanoparticles and nanocarbon. As a result, FeS2@C can act as highly active and stable electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It delivers a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at overpotential of 195 mV to catalyze HER and remains almost unchanged for 150 h.									16	1	0	0	2	0	16			2574-0970			WOS:000473827600063

Thus, to realize an acceptable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, a combination of non-noble metals was used to improve the architecture and conducive to a facile OER. For this purpose, a binder-free and non-noble metal-based trimetallic (Cu-Zn-Ag) composite OER a electrocatalyst was grown at the surface of fluorine-doped tin oxide by a facile one step in-situ electrodeposition method using chronoamperometry. The formation and performance of the catalyst were ensured from XRD, SEM, EDX, chronoamperometry, and linear scan voltammetry. The trimetallic composite showed good results toward OER in 1 M KOH electrolyte at pH 13 at a current density of 1 mA/cm(2)with an overpotential of 303 mV at a scan rate of 10 mV/sec. The results revealed robust electrochemical durability under alkaline conditions and the electrocatalyst holds great promise for OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000578614000001

In these systems, the reaction takes place between metals or metals and ligands to facilitate charge transfer, bond formation/breaking, substrate binding, and release of products. In this study, we present a method to detect X-ray emission signals from multiple elements simultaneously, which allows for the study of charge transfer and the sequential chemistry occurring between elements. K beta X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) probes charge and spin states of metals as well as their ligand environment. A wavelength-dispersive spectrometer based on the von Hamos geometry was used to disperse K beta signals of multiple elements onto a position detector, enabling an XES spectrum to be measured in a single-shot mode. This overcomes the scanning needs of the scanning spectrometers, providing data free from temporal and normalization errors and therefore ideal to follow sequential chemistry at multiple sites. We have applied this method to study MnOx-based bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In particular, we investigated the effects of adding a secondary element, Ni, to form MnNiOx and its impact on the chemical states and catalytic activity, by tracking the redox characteristics of each element upon sweeping the electrode potential. The detection scheme we describe here is general and can be applied to time-resolved studies of materials consisting of multiple elements, to follow the dynamics of catalytic and electron transfer reactions.									30	0	0	0	1	0	30			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000351933600043	25747045

However, Mo2N possesses a strong hydrogen binding ability and is highly sensitive to the oxygen, resulting in limited kinetics associated with deteriorated HER performances. Herein, a sulfur decoration strategy is presented to modulate the electronic structures and surface compositions, so that an optimized hydrogen adsorption free energy and protective sulfide shell can be obtained, leading to significant enhancement of performance with a small Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1) in acidic media, outperforming the vast majority of reported non-precious metal electrocatalysts for the HER. Moreover, the improvement mechanisms and composition evolution have also been investigated. And the first-principle calculation is provided to give a theoretic evidence for the modulation of corresponding electronic structures. This work verifies that the rational decoration with a second anion is a powerful and effective strategy to design highly active and durable HER electrocatalysts, further demonstrating the importance of anions for the HER.

Thin, dense layers of LSC were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering on YSZ pellets. The electrochemical behavior was studied as functions of temperature (300-530 degreesC) and oxygen partial pressure (0.21-2 X 10(-5) bar) by impedance spectroscopy. Impedance diagrams were decomposed into two elements, characteristic of the electrode polarization. The low frequency contribution can be described either as a limiting Warburg diffusion loop or as a semi-circle. These results can be interpreted in terms of a progressive evolution of the limiting process as functions of oxygen pressure and temperature, i.e. a finite diffusion process in series with dissociative sorption process. Under low oxygen pressure, at temperatures higher than 475 degreesC, gas-phase diffusion polarization becomes significant.

Herein, a novel design of intramolecular g-C3N4-based ternary homojunction is established via one step KSCN/NH4Cl-assisted ionothermal route. The integrated theoretical calculations and experimental results disclose that such a unique ternary structure not only dramatically expedite intralayer exciton splitting and interface charge transfer but also greatly reduce backward charge recombination through the arrangement of HOMO/LUMO levels and consequent internal electric field. As a result, the optimal sample exhibits remarkable enhancements in oxygen (O-2) reduction to hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), and water splitting with H-2 evolution rate (3806.5 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) about 17.8 times higher than that of unmodified melon outperforming most functionalized g-C3N4 and heterojunctions reported thus far. Our study highlights the rational design of chemical structures to modulate the excitonic features and charge-transfer properties of polymeric semiconductors for efficient solar energy utilization.									22	1	0	0	2	0	22			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000560730400002

It is shown that the rate of cathodic reduction of oxygen out of the gas phase depends on the preliminary treatment of the sample. The activation energy is equal to 110-135 kJ mol(-1) at a low polarization. After increasing the polarization, the activation energy for the cathodic reduction of oxygen equals 75-85 kJ mol(-1) and depends on the oxygen pressure as a power function with a power index of 1/4. The rate of the anodic evolution of oxygen is dependent neither on the preliminary treatment of the sample nor on the oxygen pressure in the gas phase and the polarization curve has a characteristic segment, which corresponds to a limiting overvoltage.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000232143400004

Herein, a template-assisted method is developed to reduce the crystal size of CoFe-ZIF via in-situ growing on hollow polypyrrole spheres (h-PPy). As a result, the well-dispersed ultrafine CoFe nanoalloy were obtained with N-doped hollow carbon microspheres (N-HCSs) as support. Owing to the unique alloy structure with ultrafine size, uniform dispersion of the CoFe nanoalloy on the highly conductive N-HCSs support via strong interactions, the proposed CoFe/N-HCSs afford high catalytic activity and stability toward ORR. Interestingly, the CoFe/N-HCSs also deliver a low overpotential of 292 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER in alkaline electrolyte, demonstrating their superior bifunctional catalytic performance. Moreover, the CoFe/N-HCSs can endow the liquid Zn-air batteries with better energy density (882.3 Wh kg(zn)(-1)) and cycling stability than those of Pt/C catalyst and exhibit potential feasibility in all-solid-state Zn-air batteries.									39	1	0	0	2	0	39			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000607597100002

Oxygen concentration in the process gas was set to 40 and 70% by vol. and a heating rate of 40 degrees C/min was used. Response variables included: the temperature of incipient reaction, the total exothermic heat of reaction, particle mass, morphology, and mineralogy of the reacted particles. Based on the experimental data and phase stability calculations, reaction mechanisms were proposed to represent the behavior of the particles during oxidation. The reaction mechanisms were verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of the oxidized particles, and by thermochemical and mass balance calculations to reproduce the DSC and TGA thermograms. Overall kinetic models were developed to represent the evolution of the exothermic heat of reaction for each mineral as a function of time. Experiments conducted with copper concentrate particles containing the minerals studied suggest that the reaction mechanisms for the individual minerals can be used to represent the oxidation behavior of the copper concentrate particles.

J	Wang, Huijie; Tong, Yun; Li, Kaixun; Chen, Pengzuo								Heterostructure engineering of iridium species on nickel/molybdenum nitride for highly-efficient anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer								JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				628				306	314		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.08.056				DEC 15 2022	2022	Developing highly active electrocatalysts is a pivotal issue for anion-exchange membrane water electrolyz-ers (AEMWE). However, realizing the continuous hydrogen generation at a large current density remains challenging. Herein, a novel kind of hybrid electrode is successfully developed by introducing trace iridium (Ir) species onto a hierarchical Ni/Mo5N6 heterostructure on Ni foam (Ir-Ni/Mo5N6/NF). The synergistic advantages of high conductivity, abundant active sites, and strong electronic interaction endow superior reaction kinetics, presenting a highly-active bifunctional electrocatalyst. Remarkably, the IrNi/Mo5N6/ NF exhibit extremely low overpotentials of 52 mV and 250 mV at 100 mA cm-2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By exploiting the Ir-Ni/Mo5N6 as both anode/cathode, the constructed AEMWE device delivers superior performance. The current density reaches 2.1 A cm(-2) at a volt-age of 2.0 V and 250 mA cm-2 at 1.8 V in alkaline/neutral media. This work put forward a facile and effective strategy to synthesize advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts for water electrolysis.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In this article, MnO2/carbon-nanotubes (CNTs) hybrid catalysts anchored with a metal oxide (M-MnO2/CNTs) are developed via a facile hydrothermal process toward an efficient oxygen catalytic (evolution and reduction) reactions. M-MnO2/CNTs displays better catalytic activity than MnO2/CNTs. The overpotential of Co-MnO2/CNTs is lowered to 0.803 V, very close to that of Pt/C + IrO2 (0.801 V). Moreover, Co-MnO2/CNTs exhibits faster kinetics for oxygen evolution reaction with low Tafel slope (62 mV dec(-1)) than Pt/C + IrO2. The improved performance and stability originated from (i) the novel hierarchal structure improving the mass transport, (ii) the redistribution of electrons activating the Mn catalytic sites, (iii) the coupling effect between the metal oxide and MnO2/CNTs, and (iv) an excellent conductivity building a fast electron transfer high-way. The density functional theory results reveal that the anchored metal oxide cluster directly activates neighbor Mn sites on the surface of the hybrid catalyst, and enhances the oxygen catalytic activity by decreasing the bonding with OH and OOH. Accordingly, the maximum power density of the Co-MnO2/CNTs-based Zn-air battery reaches 342.7 mW cm(-2). The Zn-air battery also exhibits good charge-discharge stability with a low voltage gap of 0.72 V for 128 h. This work provides an effective method to achieve MnO2/CNTs materials with tailored catalytic activity by anchoring different metal oxides and demonstrates great potential in the field of high specific energy batteries for electrical vehicles, portable electronics, and wearable devices.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000594115100002

In this work, we successfully fabricated a binder-free catalyst comprising Ni and V2O3 grown on Ni foam (NF) via annealing hydrothermally resultant Ni3V2O8/NF in a H-2/Ar atmosphere and applied it as a non-precious HER electrocatalyst. The as-fabricated material denoted as Ni@V2O3/NF behaves with a unique structure in form of Ni nanoparticles wrapped by V2O3, which should be attributed to the rolling up of nanosheet caused by the Ni outward diffusion from Ni3V2O8 nanosheet during the pyrolysis process. Moreover, the oxygen vacancies-rich V2O3 can donate electron to the in-situ formed Ni nanoparticles and restrict their overgrowth, which regulate the electronic structure of nanohybrid, facilitate HER kinetic process and create abundant accessible active sites. Hence, the Ni@V2O3/NF demonstrates superior HER activity delivering current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an appropriate overpotenial of 19 mV with a low Tafel slope of 48.5 mV/dec and long-term stability in alkaline solution. This work will provide inspirations to the exploration of Ni-V based electrocatalysts for various emerging energy applications.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000576953600007

With the presence of A-T and G-C pairs, sugar moieties, phosphate functional groups and the double-helical structure, it can assemble both cationic and anionic species and forms a perfect metal-DNA self-assembly. Depending upon the aspect ratio of metal-DNA self-assemblies, metal content and their morphological outcomes, they could deliver variance in the catalytic activities. Such differences can be brought out by varying the synthesis reaction parameters focusing on a specific electrocatalytic application. In this review, recent developments in DNA metallization is elaborated first highlighting the underlying interactions between DNA and cationic/anionic species of various metals following which application of metal-DNA assemblies in electrocatalytic water oxidation and reduction are discussed critically. Knowledge provided in this review thus acts as the guide to various DNA metallization strategies and their subsequent application to water electrolysis for hydrogen generation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a lower overpotential than RuO2 (0.37 V) and Pt NPs (0.60 V). The better electrocatalytic activity of the hybrid material is associated with its heterojunction structure, in which the strong electron coupling interactions between Co9S8, CoS, CoO and C give rise to a superior synergistic effect. The interconnected amorphous carbon not only anchored the active Co compounds to avoid aggregation, but also afforded conducting channels for electron transfer. Furthermore, the cobalt compounds were the active species in the sample during the OER process; they were converted into CoOOH and Co(OH)(2) in the KOH electrolyte, and the S elements in the sample entered the solution. The Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs can exhibit the best OER activity with minimum overpotential (0.028 V) to afford a stable OER current after activation in a KOH aqueous solution. The sample also showed obvious photoresponse to visible light irradiation with enhanced OER current and lowered onset potential, which was probably associated with the semiconducting characteristics of the spin-polarized CoO and the quantum confinement effect of the nanoparticles.									84	8	0	0	3	0	86			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000402387900046

However, although much attention has been paid to the composition and structure of active sites for development of heterogeneous OEC models, the cofactors, which are essential for water oxidation by the photosynthetic OEC, remain little studied. The high activity of CoO(OH) nanoparticles for electrocatalytic water oxidation is shown to be induced by a CO32- cofactor. The possibility of CO32- ions acting as proton acceptors for O-O bond formation based on the proton-concerted oxygen atom transfer mechanism is proposed. The O-O bond formation is supposed to be accelerated due to effective proton acceptance by adjacent CO32- ions coordinated on the CoIV center in the intermediate, which is consistent with Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics and the significant H/D isotope effect observed in electrocatalysis.									17	0	0	0	4	0	17			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000397006500007	27987267

Changes of photochemical activity of photosystem II, oxygen evolution, flash oxygen yields and energy distribution to photosystem II were studied in thylakoid membranes isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana plants, grown at optimal conditions (control plants) and subjected for 2 and 6 days to low temperature in presence and absence of high light illumination. Treatment of Arabidopsis thaliana only with low temperature leads to a slight decrease in their photosystem II activity. Adding high light to the action of low temperature resulted in enhanced inhibition of oxygen evolution in presence of exogenous electron acceptor as well as flash oxygen yields were considerably reduced. Determination of kinetic parameters of initial oxygen burst showed that photo system II centres situated in grana regions were more vulnerable to damaging effect of combination of low temperature and high light. The results obtained are discussed in the light of mechanisms underlying the attempt of plants to reduce excitation pressure on photosystem II at low temperature and high light intensity.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1310-1331			WOS:000428342500008

Mo-doping-assisted electrochemical transformation to generate CoFe LDH as the highly efficient electrocatalyst for overall water splitting								Journal of Alloys and Compounds				902				163738	163738		10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.163738				2022	2022	Facile preparation of efficient, low-cost, and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting remains a big challenge. Herein, we successfully synthesized Mo-doped CoFe layered double hydroxides (Mo-doped CoFe LDH/NF) nanosheets by electrochemical transformation of Mo-doped CoFe prussian blue nanocubes on nickel foam (Mo-doped CoFe PBA/NF) for highly efficient overall water splitting. The catalyst exhibits outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance after electrochemical transformation, which is due to the abundant edge defects of Mo-doped CoFe LDH/NF can expose more active sites. Meanwhile, Mo6+ has a strong electron absorption ability, which could adjust the electronic structure and stabilize the high valence active sites. It only requires a low overpotential for OER (331 mV) and HER (227 mV) to reach 100 mA cm-2 in alkaline media, respectively. Notably, when it was employed as a bifunctional electrode, Mo-doped CoFe LDH/NF displays a low potential of 1.55 V to reach 100 mA cm-2 coupled with long-term water splitting stability in an alkaline electrolyte. This work not only developed a novel method for the synthesis of efficient double-layer hydroxide catalysts, but also paved the way for the rational design of bifunctional electrocatalysts with practical application value.

In addition to steady-state investigations, the technique permits experiments with a time-resolution in the sub-second range to elucidate the solid-state kinetics of the reactions involved. Combined with mass spectrometry, the evolution of the short-range order structure of a heterogeneous catalyst, the average valence of the constituent metals, and the phase composition can be obtained.

In the present work, we proposed a facile strategy to construct ultrathin NiO nanosheets decorated with Fe-V nanoparticles on nickel foam (Fe-V@NiO/NF) for use as an OER electrocatalyst. Due to the 3D rational configuration, the Fe-V@NiO/NF with a heterostructure shows excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the OER. Interestingly, it is found that in situ oxidation by galvanostatic electrolysis in alkaline solution is beneficial to enhance the OER performance. After 10 h of electrolysis, a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) is achieved at a low overpotential of 271.1 mV. This is because during the in situ oxidation process, iron and vanadium ions insert into the NiO lattice and lead to the generation of highly active alpha-FeOOH and an amorphous (oxy)-hydroxide layer. Additionally, the charge transfer resistance dramatically reduces with the prolonging of oxidation time.									19	2	0	0	1	0	19			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000515391000023	31994577

Herein, hierarchical spinel NCO nanomaterials with different morphologies such as homogeneous NCO nanoparticles, one-dimensional NCO nanorods, heterogeneous NCO nanoflowers, and three-dimensional NCO microspheres assembled with nanoparticles are synthesized via facile coprecipitation method combined with calcination process. The effect of precipitating agents on designed formation mechanism of these NCO structures is further investigated. NCO microspheres are evaluated as supercapacitors and demonstrate excellent electrochemical performances with a high specific capacitance (225.07 C/g at 0.5 A/g) and cycling stability (86.9% at 2 A/g over 3000 cycles). Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated with NCO microspheres as the positive and graphene as the negative respectively, which exhibits a high energy density of 19.12 Wh/kg at a power density of 509.87 W/kg. As the electrocatalyst, NCO microspheres also show a superior OER electrocatalytic activity with a minimal Tafel slope of 70.32 mV dec(-1) due to more mesoporous and diffusion pathways than other NCO samples. These results provide a new strategy to develop affordable alternative OER catalysts and asymmetric supercapacitors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The obtained CoO layered nanosheet/graphene hybrid nanoarray was directly used as an OER electrode, showing a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 330 mV and a Tafel slope of 79 mV dec(-1), both of which are much lower than pristine NF and the nanosheet array without graphene, and are among the lowest reported for Co-based OER catalysts and transition metal oxide-based ones measured under the same conditions. In addition, it can retain 92.4% of the current density after 66 h of chronoamperometry testing at a potential of 1.0 V vs. SCE, and 94.3% of the current density at 1.0 V vs. SCE after 200 cyclic voltammetry cycles (0-1.0 V vs. SCE). The excellent catalytic activity and stability toward OER are ascribed to the 3-D NF supported robustly grown networked layered nanosheet array structure and the synergistic effects between CoO layered nanosheets and graphene.

Herein, we report an okra-like hollow Cu-0.15-CoP/Co3O4@CC nanotube arrays catalyst through a simple hydrothermal-phosphating method. As a noble-metal-free catalyst, it exhibits outstanding HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) catalytic activity with an overpotential of 13 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. For OER (oxygen evolution reaction), it demands 225 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). When okra-like hollow Cu-0.15-CoP/Co3O4@CC is used as both cathode and anode electrode materials, 1.487 V is required to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for OWS, better than numerous electrocatalysts that have been reported. Moreover, it displays excellent stability in a continuously 60 h i-t test, proving an enormous potential for large-scale applications. The theoretical calculation of density functional theory (DFT) further reveals that Cu doping can bring localized structure polarization and reduce the hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(H*)) on the interstitial sites, thus leading to a significant increase in catalytic activity.

Pap, Jozsef/0000-0003-1704-0925			Redox-active ligands in artificial photosynthesis: a review								ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS											10.1007/s10311-022-01448-3		APR 2022			2022	Given the rising socioeconomic issues of fossil fuels, efficient artificial photosynthesis would be an important milestone toward a sustainable world. A key step of photosynthesis is the catalytic photooxidation of water by photosystem II, which has a mean lifetime of 30 min under full sunlight. Since the efficiency of photosystem II is controlled by redox-active tyrosine-histidine pairs that regulate the light-induced flow of charges, research has recently focused on the utilization of redox-active ligands in artificial systems. Here we review the molecular catalysis of water oxidation with emphasis on redox cooperation modes between ligands and metal centers. Molecular systems involving redox-active ligands could achieve up to 100% efficiency with respect to oxygen production, overpotential of 200-300 mV and turnover frequency above 100 s(-1), which is comparable to the natural process. Nonetheless, molecular catalysts are often prone to degradation of the organic ligand. The oxidative activation of ligands can contribute to the water oxidation reactivity of a metal-ligand complex, or lead to controlled catalyst film formation. We discuss the design of functional analogs to the tyrosine-histidine pair that for the most part rely on abundant elements and exploit redox-active molecular moieties to assist the catalytic centers. We highlight analogies with the cooperation between the natural oxygen-evolving complex and the redox-active tyrosine-histidine pairs found in photosystem II.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1610-3653	1610-3661		WOS:000788408300001		
J	Shen, Zheyu; Lan, Zecheng; Wang, Yu; Xu, Lianghua								Effects of ambient pressure on structural characteristics of polyacrylonitrile pre-oxidized fibers								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE											10.1002/app.53240		OCT 2022			2022	During the pre-oxidation process, skin-core structure is easily formed in the fibers due to the competitive mechanism of oxygen capture and oxygen diffusion, which would degrade the tensile properties of the resulting carbon fibers. To prepare high-performance carbon fibers, it is vital to optimize the radial structure of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) pre-oxidized fibers. Methods commonly used to solve the skin-core structure would result in low productivity and comprehensive performance. Here, we examine the effects of pressure on the chemical structure and the evolution of radial structure in PAN pre-oxidized fibers under 225 degrees C in the air, by using C-13 Solid-state NMR analysis (C-13-NMR), Optical density test (OD), and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TG). It was found out that under the positive pressure of 30 kPa, the reaction area expands to the core of the fibers with the shell thickness increasing from 88.11% under normal pressure to 98.67%, and the radial structure homogeneity is effectively improved. As the pressure increases above 22 kPa, oxygen diffusion is accelerated, allowing for breaking the barrier of the fiber surface capture and promoting the oxygen catalytic cyclization reaction in the core. Consequently, PAN pre-oxidized fibers prepared under positive pressure have a more uniform radial structures and higher thermal stability. The carbonization yield at 800 degrees C of the fibers prepared at 30 kPa is 13.10% higher than that of the fibers prepared at atmospheric pressure.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8995	1097-4628		WOS:000863860000001

Herein, bimetallic nickel-iron phosphides nanoparticles (P-NiFe-800 NPs) with rich defects have been synthesized through gas annealing at 800 degrees C and phosphorization using uniform nickel-iron nanocubes (NiFe NCs) as precursor. At optimized calcination temperature, the obtained P-NiFe-800 NPs are composed of uniform nanoparticles with the rough surface, which suggests the larger surface area and more exposed rich active sites than other samples for OER. The introduction of P element to binary nickel-iron metals can optimize the crystalline and electronic structures of NiFe NCs and thus enhance electrocatalytic properties. Owing to the distinct morphological structure and synergistic effect between nickel-iron and phosphorus, P-NiFe-800 NPs demonstrate superior electrocatalytic activities for OER with lower overpotential of 270.1 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), smaller Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1), lower electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) value, bigger determined double-layer capacitance (C-dl) ) of 2130 uF cm(-2) and prominent stability than NiFe NCs, NiFe-600 NPs, NiFe-700 NPs, NiFe-800 NPs, NiFe-900 NPs, P-NiFe NCs, P-NiFe-600 NPs, P-NiFe-700 NPs and P-NiFe-900 NPs. The optimized phosphorization is helpful for fabricating the bimetallic phosphides as efficient catalysts for OER. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, we developed a simple nitrogen-anion decoration strategy to realize the synergistic regulation of the catalytically active sites, electronic structure, and reaction dynamics in metallic CoS2 porous nanowire (NW) arrays. Specifically, the introduction of nitrogen anion in the CoS2 system, revealed by the XPS and XANES spectra, not only modified the morphology, offering additional active sites, but also enhanced the electrical conductivity to promote rapid charge transfer for the HER process. Synergistically, density functional theory confirms that the N incorporation results in more optimal free energy of hydrogen adsorption for either S or Co active sites, benefiting the HER kinetics. As expected, the N-CoS2 NW/carbon cloth (CC) electrode showed significantly enhanced HER performance with a lower overpotential and a larger exchange current density than the pristine one. This work provides a promising idea to the rational design of advanced and highly efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production.									129	11	0	0	9	0	133			2155-5435			WOS:000414724700002

Spectroelectrochemical measurements (SE-DRS) revealed the staggered type of the band alignment for anatase and TiO2(B) composites, with higher potentials of band edges for anatase. The photoactivity of the materials and photocurrent generation have been studied. Similarly to anatase/rutile composites, a synergistic effect of the presence of two phases has been observed for TiO2(B)/anatase (2:98) material in the reaction of hydroxyl radicals generation. In the case of hydrogen generation reaction, such synergy was not noticed, likewise in the case of IPCE measurements. On the other hand, singlet oxygen generation takes place preferably at TiO2(B), despite worse oxygen adsorption at this polymorph. Our findings shed new light on the general understanding of the photocatalytic activity of TiO2(B) and its composites with anatase. Unlike suggested elsewhere, instead of facilitating hydrogen evolution reaction, TiO2(B), as a minor admixture, should rather be considered as a component of photocatalysts optimized for oxidation reactions involving hydroxyl radicals.

The synthesis of water is one necessary step in the origin and development of life. It is believed that pristine water is formed and grows on the surface of icy dust grains in dark interstellar clouds. Until now, there has been no experimental evidence whether this scenario is feasible or not on an astrophysically relevant template and by hydrogen and oxygen atom reactions.Aims. We present here the first experimental evidence of water synthesis by such a process on a realistic analogue of grain surface in dense clouds, i.e., amorphous water ice.Methods. Atomic beams of oxygen and deuterium are aimed at a porous water ice substrate (H2O) held at 10 K. Products are analyzed by the temperature-programmed desorption technique.Results. We observe the production of HDO and D2O, indicating that water is formed under conditions of the dense interstellar medium from hydrogen and oxygen atoms. This experiment opens up the field of a little explored complex chemistry that could occur on dust grains, which is believed to be the site where key processes lead to the molecular diversity and complexity observed in the Universe.									120	0	0	0	4	0	120			0004-6361			WOS:000276245500011

On the clean surface, ethanol shows a very simple dehydrogenation, producing hydrogen in the gas phase, adsorbed CO (which is desorbed by heating to 550 K) and carbon. Since in alcohol synthesis reactions it is likely that the surface will be partially oxidised, the reaction with predosed oxygen was also investigated. The reaction pathway then becomes much more complex. The main changes are (i) CH4 and H2O evolution during adsorption, and (ii) Acetate formation by oxygen insertion in the molecule. The acetate shows very unusual decomposition kinetics -a surface 'explosion' with a very narrow peak-yielding CO2 and H2 in the gas phase and adsorbed C. The acetate is always seen on Rh catalysts which are selective for alcohol synthesis from CO and H2, and it is proposed that oxidic promoters such as vanadia may act to stabilise this intermediate.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			1011-372X			WOS:A1991GE13200013

Herein, we design an Er0.4Bi1.6O3-delta (ESB) functionalized La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta (labeled as LSM/ESB) oxygen electrode via a one-step co-synthesis modified Pechini method. The unique LSM/ESB with polarization resistance of only 0.029 Omega.cm(2) at 750 degrees C enables a highly enhanced rate of oxygen reduction and evolution reaction. The single cell with the LSM/ESB electrode achieves a maximum power density of 1.747 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C, 2.6 times higher than that of the mechanically mixed LSM-ESB electrode (0.667 W cm(-2)). In the SOEC mode, it also shows the improved performance of the LSM/ESB electrode. Furthermore, the cell exhibits admirable durability of 90 h in the fuel cell mode and excellent reversibility. The better performance can be concluded as a better surface-active state and a tighter connection between the LSM and ESB particles of LSM/ESB via a co-synthesis process. This work proposes a novel strategy to advance the application of the one-step modified Pechini technology for an efficient and stable oxygen electrode.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000605187100026	33332091

The device was constructed by depositing a self-assembled BCP film atop an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate. A tungsten precursor was then selectively coordinated into the film via liquid phase infiltration, which upon UV-ozone treatment yielded WO3 surface nanolines (NLs) with excellent surface coverage. The resulting device was firstly investigated as a photoanode for OER. The onset overpotential of the WO(3)NLs-ITO electrode was determined to be 240 mV and 390 mV, with and without light illumination, respectively. Moreover, the applicability of the WO(3)NLs-ITO device for the electrochemical sensing of EP was explored using cyclic voltammetry and amperometry, exhibiting a linear response in a wide working range of 0.5-250 mu M with a sensitivity of 0.0491 mu A mu M-1 and detection limit of 0.086 mu M. The device demonstrated high durability over multiple EP measurements, as well as strong anti-interference abilities versus well-known interfering compounds. Additionally, the device was successfully applied to accurately determine EP concentrations in commercial drug samples. The results of this study attest to the significant potential of BCP templating for developing low cost, high-performance electrocatalytic devices for future nanomanufacturing strategies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000799290300001

Here, a novel and stable trimetallic NiFeCr layered double hydroxide (LDH) electrocatalyst for improving OER kinetics is rationally designed and synthesized. Electrochemical testing of a series of trimetallic NiFeCr LDH materials at similar catalyst loading and electrochemical surface area shows that the molar ratio Ni:Fe:Cr = 6:2:1 exhibits the best intrinsic OER catalytic activity compared to other NiFeCr LDH compositions. Furthermore, these nanostructures are directly grown on conductive carbon paper for a high surface area 3D electrode that can achieve a catalytic current density of 25 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential as low as 225 mV and a small Tafel slope of 69 mV dec(-1) in alkaline electrolyte. The optimized NiFeCr catalyst is stable under OER conditions and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and elemental analysis confirm the stability of trimetallic NiFeCr LDH after electrochemical testing. Due to the synergistic interactions among the metal centers, trimetallic NiFeCr LDH is significantly more active than NiFe LDH and among the most active OER catalysts to date. This work also presents general strategies to design more efficient metal oxide/hydroxide OER electrocatalysts.									374	23	0	0	28	0	380			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000434031400017

Herein, a 3-dimensional (3D) hierarchical architecture consisted of copper nitride (Cu3N) and Co-Ni carbonate hydroxides (CoNiCHs) on copper foam (CF) was synthesized, and the Cu3N@CoNiCHs@CF requires quite small overpotentials (eta s) of 182 and 155 mV to afford current density (j10) of 10 mA cm-2 for HER and OER, respectively. More importantly, it requires a comparably low potential of 1.58 V to deliver j10 upon driving overall water splitting due to an optimal integration of the 3D hierarchical configuration and the desirable interface interplay of Cu3N and CoNiCHs, outperforming those of noble metals and most of the benchmarking bifunctional electrocatalysts. This study paves an attractive way to better unraveling the interface interplay over hierarchical architectures with very promising electrocatalytic activity.									33	0	0	0	1	0	33			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663219500005		
J	Ressler, Thorsten; Wienold, Julia; Timpe, Olaf								Evolution of catalyst structure under reaction conditions from time-resolved in situ XAS investigations								PHYSICA SCRIPTA				T115				66	71						2005	2005	Time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (TR-XAS) possesses excellent capabilities to reveal quantitative phase composition and average valence together with the evolution of the local structure of a system under dynamic reaction conditions. The work discussed here focused on time-resolved in situ XAS investigations aiming, first, at understanding structural evolution under dynamic conditions and, second, at revealing properties of the system studied not available from investigations under stationary conditions. In order to demonstrate the potential of TR-XAS in heterogeneous catalysis, TR-XAS investigations combined with mass spectrometry of the structural evolution of Keggin type heteropolyoxomolybdates (HPOM) during thermal treatment in propene and in propene and oxygen in the temperature range from 300K to 773K are presented. It is concluded, that the undistorted Keggin ion in the as-prepared HPOM has to be regarded as a precursor of the active catalyst, while the formation of lacunary Keggin ions is a prerequisite for catalytic activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0031-8949	1402-4896		WOS:000204272100012

Given the increasinginterest in metallocorroles as electrocatalysts, three nickel corroleswere explored as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction(HER) in the current study. The precatalysts were fullycharacterized as square planar d8nickel(II) coordinationcompounds in which the extra negative charge is stabilized byelectron-withdrawing substituents on the corrole and a robustcountercation. This unique feature leads to an about 0.8 V shift inredox potentials and different reaction pathways compared totrivalent and hence neutral metallocorroles, as well as increasedreactivity toward weak acid relative to a neutral nickel(II)porphyrin analogue. Only singly reduced and singly oxidized reaction intermediates are shown to be involved in the catalyticcycle for the conversion of protons to hydrogen, by both experimental and computational analyses; the nickel corroles were preparedand characterized in all of the corresponding oxidation states. The nickel corrole with two sulfonamido groups on its skeletoncatalyzes the HER with an onset potential of about-1 V vs Fc+/0and thousands of turnovers per second.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000791836500007

The optimized electrocatalyst, Co-TiN@NG-2/CC, shows a low overpotential of similar to 208 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term durability in 1 M KOH. For the supercapacitor (SC), Co-TiN@NG-2/CC exhibits a capacitance of up to 189 mF cm(-2) at a current density of 0.5 mA cm(-2) and good rate capability. The capacitance can retain ca. 70% of the initial specific capacitance even after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 mA cm(-2). The enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction and supercapacitance are attributed to the synergistic effect between titanium nitride and Co nanoparticles in the N-doped carbon matrix, leading to increased active sites and electrical conductivity.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000486223200031

Herein, we report two multicomponent heterostructures as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts, Co2P/Mo2C/Mo3Co3C and Ni/Ni2P/Mo2C nanoparticles encapsulated in porous graphene shells (termed Co2P/Mo2C/Mo3Co3C@C and Ni/Ni2P/Mo2C@C). Two bimetallic MOFs (CoMo-MOF and NiMo-MOF) with ordered heterogeneity were used as precursors to synthesize Co2P/Mo2C/Mo3Co3C@C and Ni/Ni2P/Mo2C@C via a facile and versatile two-step method and a direct carbonization process followed by phosphorization. The resultant catalysts manifest superior HER performance with low overpotentials of 154 and 183 mV delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic media. More importantly, both Co2P/Mo2C/Mo3Co3C@C and Ni/Ni2P/Mo2C@C exhibit favorable HER and OER activity under alkaline conditions. Remarkably, Co2P/Mo2C/Mo3Co3C@C affords overpotentials of 182 mV and 362 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER. Moreover, the two catalysts present good stability in both acidic and basic electrolytes. The synergistic effect of the multicomponent electrochemically active species and the uniform distribution, mesoporous structures and carbon coating are beneficial for the charge transfer during the catalytic process, which results in excellent performance, comparable to many reported nonprecious electrocatalysts. Furthermore, Co2P/Mo2C/Mo3Co3C@C catalysts were exploited as both the anode and cathode in a home-made electrolyser with alkaline electrolyte, which can afford 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.74 V.									76	6	0	0	2	0	77			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431506600037

Using this approach, partial polarization curves for iron oxidation and oxygen reduction were synthesized from experimental current-potential data at different corrosion time in order to determine the kinetics parameters, corrosion potential and current density of the underlying anodic and cathodic subprocesses. The distinctive features of the polarization curves are well described in terms of the simplifying assumptions of the model. In particular, the time evolution of the corrosion current density was linked to the morphology of the corroding surface under different NaCl concentrations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

For the unicellular green alga Scenedesmus obliquus, the fluorescence yield (F), the fluorescence yield in the presence of reduced Q(A) (F-M') and the yield of respiration-corrected oxygen evolution (Phi(ox), evolution rate divided by light intensity) were determined during exposure to actinic light of various intensities (0.1-1600 mu E m(-2) s(-1)). Irrespective of the growth conditions, the parameter Phi(P) = (F-M'-F)/F-M' was found to be proportional to Phi(ox) for each algal culture. This finding is in full agreement with non-photochemical fluorescence quenching by increased thermal deactivation of excited antenna states, but is difficult to reconcile with non-photochemical quenching due to modified PS II electron transfer reactions. In particular, no indications of cyclic PS II electron flow were found.									14	2	0	0	12	1	18			1011-1344			WOS:A1996UA86600013

We characterize a photochemically deposited series of Fe-Ni (oxy)hydroxides by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and track the voltage- and composition-dependence of structural motifs. We observe a trigonal distortion in di-mu-hydroxo bridged Ni-II-Ni-II motifs that is preserved following a symmetric contraction of Ni-O bond lengths when oxidized to di-mu-oxo Ni-IV-Ni-IV. Incorporation of Fe ions into the structure generates di-mu-hydroxo Ni-II-Fe-III motifs in which Ni-Fe distances are dependent on nickel oxidation state, but Fe-O bond lengths are not. This asymmetry minimizes the trigonal distortion in di--hydroxo Ni-II-Fe-III motifs and neighboring di-mu-hydroxo Ni-II-Ni-II sites in the reduced state, but exacerbates it in the oxidized state. We attribute both the Fe-induced anodic shift in nickel-based redox peaks and the improved ability to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction to this inversion in geometric distortions. Spectroelectrochemical experiments reveal a previously unreported change in optical absorbance at ca. 1.5 V vs. RHE in Fe-containing samples. We attribute this feature to oxidation of nickel ions in di-mu-hydroxo Ni-II-Fe-III motifs, which we propose is the process relevant to catalytic oxygen evolution.									49	2	0	0	6	0	49			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000445215400014

Great effort focused on nanostructure engineering has enabled a substantial advance in cost-efficient OER catalysts. In contrast, this work reports a simple and feasible strategy to improve OER performance via integrating photo-electro activation. Herein, for the first time, we present an interesting photo-enhanced effect on electrocatalytic OER activity for layered double hydroxides (LDHs). Defect-rich ultrathin CoFe-LDH nanosheets (NSs) are demonstrated as a typical semiconducting catalyst to exhibit a nearly 3-fold increase in mass activity upon 1 sun irradiation (100 mW cm(-2)), higher than those of the most advanced OER catalysts. Photo-induced charge kinetic analyses reveal dynamic optimization in terms of photon harvesting, charge separation and transfer, and surface catalysis. This work describes the compatibility of photo-electro activation over semiconducting LDHs, opening a new avenue to improve catalytic activity with free solar energy.									24	5	0	0	1	0	25			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000508855700015

Remarkably, an adaptation strategy whereby O-2 partial pressure, P-O2 in the arterial blood is maintained within a low and narrow range of 1-3 kPa, largely independent of inspired P-O2 has also been reported in modern water-breathers. In mammalian tissues, including brain, the most frequently measured P-O2, is in the same low range. Based on the postulate that basic cellular machinery has been established since the early stages of evolution, we propose that this similarity in oxygenation status is the consequence of an early adaptation strategy which, subsequently throughout the course of evolution, maintained cellular oxygenation in the same low and primitive range independent of environmental changes. The rational for such an evolutionary theory is discussed in terms of an equilibrium between physiological and pathological reactions associated with O-2 excess vs O-2 lack and emerging concepts about the importance of cellular O-2-dependent mechanisms in the low but physiological P-O2, range.

Through a facile and one-pot solvothermal route, a thin and uniform SnO2 coating layer could be successfully introduced onto the surfaces of graphite felt fibers for the first time. The electrochemical reactivity of the SnO2 decorated graphite felt toward the redox reactions of Ce(IV)/Ce(III) could be substantially enhanced, which is ascribed to the superior electrocatalytic activity of this SnO2 catalyst. What is more, the undesirable side reaction of oxygen evolution can be suppressed by introducing the SnO2 coating layer that possesses a high oxygen evolution overpotential. The charge/discharge test with the catalyzed electrode exhibits a 41.2% and 25.1% increase in energy efficiency as compared with the pristine graphite felt and acid treated graphite felt at a high current density of 30 mA cm(-2) . Also, the long-term cycling performance confirms the outstanding stability of the as-prepared SnO2 catalyst enhanced electrode. These results suggest that the graphite felt modified by the low-cost and uniform SnO2 coating layer could serve as a highly promising electrode towards the Ce(IV)/Ce(III) redox couple for cerium-based RFB applications.									16	2	0	0	0	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000396146900034

In this study, ultrathin RhCo alloy nanosheet aggregates (RhCo-ANAs) with atomic thickness (1.3 nm) were synthesized by a high-temperature cyanogel-reduction method. Moreover, the electrocatalytic performance of RhCo-ANAs for water splitting was investigated in acidic, neutral, and alkaline solutions. RhCo-ANAs exhibited higher activity and long-term stability for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) than RuO2 nanoparticle (RuO2-NP) and Pt nanoparticle (Pt-NP) electrocatalysts. In particular, RhCo-ANAs only require the overpotential of 31 and 310 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER in a neutral solution, respectively. Furthermore, we directly grew RhCo-ANAs on carbon foam (CF) (termed as RhCo-ANAs/CF) with flexible property, which could be directly used as a cathode and an anode electrocatalyst for full water splitting in a two-electrode system. The two-electrode electrolyzer, assembled by RhCo-ANAs/CF as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, can provide the stable 10 mA cm(-2) current density at 1.54 V potential in a neutral solution. Importantly, the symmetric RhCo-ANAs/CF||RhCo-ANAs/CF electrolyzer has outstanding reversible switch ability for the HER and OER, which can complete fifty alternating operation by periodically switching the cathode and anode.									112	4	0	0	9	0	112			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000475689800035

We have attempted to separate the effect of shape, surface area, Mn3+ content and crystal facets on OER activity and stability. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements showed that NTs had the highest surface concentration of Mn3+ on the as prepared samples with average Mn oxidation state of 3.33. However, after activation an increase in the average oxidation state of all three shapes to 3.9 was confirmed by XPS. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) showed surface restructuring after testing. MnO2 NWs showed the highest OER mass activity of 60.6 A g(-1) (10 mA cm(-2) at 1.67 V (RHE)) due to the higher surface area of 72.2 m(2) g(-1). While NTs showed the highest specific activity due to highest content of 211 facet, high Mn3+ surface concentration/surface defects. Similar trend was observed in electmlyser testing with 2 mg cm(-2) loading. Poor electronic conductivity of MnO2 resulted in decrease in performance with increased loading to 4 mg cm(-2). All the studied shapes showed good stability over 36 h of electrolyser testing.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000530838000012

The photo-induced evolution of (OO)-O-18-O-16 demonstrates that bridging surface oxygens (> O-18(br) (2-)) behave as real catalytic species of the global water splitting photocatalytic reaction (2H(2)O + 4h(+) -> O-2(g)up arrow + 4H(+)). The experimental results are interpreted according to a previously developed water redox photooxidation (WRP) mechanism (Salvador, P. Prog. Surf. Sci. 2011, 86, 41-58), opening a new mechanistic pathway that involves the participation of terminal > O-br (2-) bridging oxygens as real photocatalytic species. In the primary step, one-fold coordinated -O-18(br).- radicals are generated from the direct photooxidation of > O-18(br) (2-) oxygens with valence band holes (> O-18(br) (2-)+ h(+)-> -O-18(br).-). In the second step, a couple of adjacent -O-18(br).- radicals chemically react, giving rise to peroxo species (2(18)O(br)(.-) -> O-18(2) (2-)), which are further photooxidized with photogenerated valence band holes, initially leading to O-18(2)(g) evolution according to the global photoreaction O-18(2) (2-)+ 4h(+)-> 2V[> O-18(br) (2-)] + 18O(2)(g)up arrow. Terminal oxygen vacancies (V[> O-18(br) (2-)]) become further healed via dissociative adsorption of H-2 O-16 water molecules (2V[> O-18(br) (2-)] + 2H(2) O-16. 2(> O-16(br) (2-)) + 2H(+)), in such a way that > O-18(br) (2-) bridging ions are progressively substituted by > O-16(br) (2-) and the initially evolved O-18(2)(g) is further replaced by O-16,18(2)(g) and finally by O-16(2)(g).									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000395881300013

Among these materials, NiPX3 are the most promising ones because their electronic structures, band gaps and positions of the valence and conduction bands edges fit to the potentials characteristic for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. Here, first steps of a detailed theoretical description on the adsorption of water molecules on pristine and defected (chalcogen vacancies) surfaces of NiPX3 are presented and it is shown that in all cases a physisorption takes the place with adsorption energies do not exceeding -650 meV and water dissociative adsorption is unfavorable. This work provides a general description for water molecules interaction with MPX3 and can serve as a basis for further studies on more complicated water/MPX3 reactions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2513-0390		WOS:000702963400001

As efficient catalytic materials for OER, bimetallic telluride (CoNiTe2/NF) nanosheets are prepared by the combination of hydrothermal and calcination method in this work. The physicochemical characterizations confirm that the surface of CoNiTe2/NF is covered by bimetallic telluride compounds (CoNiTe2) with 3D morphology composed of thin and defective nanosheets that are well-distributed on nickel foam (NF). Notably, it shows very low overpotential at 10 (181 mV), 500 (230 mV) and 1000 (270 mV) mA cm(-2) and low Tafel slope (44 mV dec(-1)). Besides, it also exhibits excellent durability lasting 24 h at 100, 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively, without distinct deactivation. This outstanding performance could be due to the bimetallic telluride and the strong covalency around the CoNi center caused by Te that plays a crucial role for enhancing the activity of catalyst. The unique morphology could provide large electrochemical active area and exposure higher amounts of active sites. Meanwhile, the self-supported structure, without binders, could also enhance the performance for OER. This work thus provides a promising strategy to synthesize multi-metal telluride materials as highly efficient and stable catalyst for OER at large current density. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Two concurrently occurring electrochemical reactions in water electrolysis (hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions) are sluggish in nature and therefore the employment of electrocatalysts is highly essential. Noble-metal-based electrocatalysts (Pt, RuO2, IrO2, etc.) have shown superior activity towards these reactions. However, their lower natural abundance and inferior stability make the cost to performance ratio of water electrolysis too high. Thus, huge amount of research efforts are being carried out to develop electrocatalysts consisting of earth abundant elements (transition metals, carbon etc.) as the replacement of these noble-metal-based materials. Transition metal compounds, carbonaceous and hybrid materials have shown promise as efficient electrocatalysts but there is still huge gap between the activities of these materials and the noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. Several strategies like morphology modulation, elemental doping, defect engineering etc. are being deployed to enhance the activity of these noble-metal-free electrocatalysts. This review summarizes these strategies and thoroughly discusses the reason behind the changes in activity of the electrocatalysts owing to these modifications. Finally, the remaining research gaps and future prospects in this field are also discussed in detail. (C) 2020 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

This two-stage ball milling process provided a novel processing route for the production of nanostructured/amorphous materials with a wide range of possible compositions not achievable through rapid solidification, electrodeposition, or chemical reduction techniques. The investigation of different surfactant and solvent concentrations resulted in improved nanoparticle yields whereby average particle sizes between 41 and 89 nm were obtained for crystalline and amorphous materials. Electrochemical testing showed that Ni81.3Nb6.3Y12.5 exhibited the lowest Tafel values and the fastest HER kinetics on both an electrochemically active surface area and on a mass loading basis. This investigation demonstrates their potential for use in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis.Graphical									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000492662400010

Herein, we report on the synthesis of the three-dimensional self supported nickel-oxide-coated cobalt manganese sulfide nanosheets array on carbon cloth (CoMn-S@NiO/CC), which is used as an efficient electrocatalyst for HER in alkaline media. The performance of CoMn-S@NiO/CC is significantly improved through an in situ electrochemical reduction process. The electrochemically activated CoMn-S@NiO/CC (ECA CoMn-S@NiO/CC) drives 100 and 200 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 232 and 278 mV, respectively, with long-term stability for hydrogen production in 1.0 M KOH. Such high hydrogen evolution activity for ECA CoMn-S@NiO/CC is owed to the incorporation of Co ions, increase in electrochemically active surface area, and the newly formation of amorphous regions on its surface.									83	5	0	0	5	0	83			2155-5435			WOS:000375894500008

Herein, we report an electrochemical deposition method to fabricate carbon nanotubes/N-doped cuprous sulfide (CNTs/N-Cu2S) composites using thiourea and a CuSO4 solution as the S and Cu sources, respectively. The advantages of this strategy include low cost, simple processing and the absence of templates or surfactants that can otherwise affect the electrochemical properties of the products. The N supplied by the thiourea can be used as a doping agent as a result of the in situ formation of small N-Cu2S particles, which can increase larger surface area and create more active sites to enhance OER catalytic activity, compared with that obtained with materials synthesized without adding the thiourea. The synergic interface of CNTs and N-Cu2S can improve conductivity and efficient chemical transfer in the composites electrodes by introducing CNTs. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the CNTs/N-Cu2S-5cyc composites present an excellent activity with the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low OER overpotential of 280 mV, the Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1) and a strong electrochemical stability in 1.0 M KOH solution.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000513603300001

In the present study, iron phosphate modified calcium iron oxide (CaFeOx|FePO4) modified FTO electrodes were prepared, and their electrocatalytic properties towards the oxygen evolution reaction in both synthetic and natural seawater solutions were investigated. CaFeOx|FePO4 was prepared by electrodepositing FePO4 onto CaFeOx, prepared by spin-coating and a follow-up annealing process, under a constant applied current for different durations. Mg2+-induced fouling significantly reduces the activity of CaFeOx and slows down the activation process of CaFeOx, but can be mitigated by surface-modification of CaFeOx with FePO4. In addition, the presence of additional electrodeposited iron phosphate on the surface of CaFeOx attenuates the production of corrosive hypochlorite from chloride oxidation. With these unique properties of FePO4, the activated CaFeOx|FePO4 electrode shows high activity and stability under high turnover conditions, reaching 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of similar to 710 mV, with a moderate increase in eta (similar to 70 mV), mainly due to the change in solution pH, over 10 h of electrolysis in phosphate-buffered (0.5 M, pH 7) seawater solution.									18	4	0	0	1	0	19			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000477683600014	30942208

Here, for the first time it is reported that the physically adsorbed metal ions (PAMI) in porous materials can be served as highly efficient OER electrocatalysts, which provides a universal PAMI method to develop electrocatalysts. This PAMI method can be applied to almost all porous supports, including graphene, carbon nanotubes, C3N4, CaCO3, and porous organic polymers and all the systems exhibit excellent OER performance. In particular, the as-synthesized Co0.7Fe0.3CB exhibits a small overpotential of 295 mV and 350 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, which exceeds commercial 40 wt% IrO2/CB and most reported non-noble metal-based OER catalysts. Moreover, the mass activity of Co0.7Fe0.3CB reaches 643.4 A g(-1) at the overpotential of 320 mV, which is nearly 4.7 times higher than that of 40 wt% IrO2/CB. In addition, the advanced ex situ and in situ synchrotron X-ray characterizations are carried out to unravel the PAMI synthetic process. In short, this PAMI method will break the conversional understanding, i.e., the most OER catalysts are synthesized chemically, because the new PAMI method does not require any chemical synthesis, which therefore opens a new avenue for the development of OER electrocatalysts.									24	0	0	0	1	0	24			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000510464600001

Here, we developed a facile approach for integrating two-dimensional (2D) zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) nanoarrays and CoNiAl ternary layered double hydroxide (CoNiAl-LDH) nanoplatelets onto three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam (NF) to form a 3D hierarchical ZIF-67/CoNiAl-LDH/NF electrocatalyst. Due to the unique 3D hierarchical architecture with increased electrochemical active surface area, multi-porous framework, and intimate interfacial coupling effect, the as-prepared ZIF-67/CoNiAl-LDH/NF electrocatalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity towards OER with a small overpotential of 303 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope around 88 mV dec(-1), much lower than those of the reported nickel- or cobalt-based OER catalysts. Moreover, the ZIF-67/CoNiAl-LDH/NF electrocatalyst also shows excellent electrochemical durability, and the hierarchical structure is well maintained with no detectable activity decay after continuous testing at 10 mA cm(-2) for 8 h. The present work provides a general strategy for the rational design and synthesis of multi-functional 3D hierarchical catalyst, which is expected to exhibit superior performance in a wide range of catalysis, especially in water electrolysis.

Here, we report on a facile and effective in situ strategy for the synthesis of an advanced nanocomposite material that is comprised of cobalt quantum dots (Co QDs, similar to 3.2 nm), uniformly dispersed on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst platform. This nanocomposite electrocatalyst afforded a mass activity of 1250 A g(-1) at a low overpotential (eta) of 0.37 V, a small Tafel slope of similar to 37 mV dec(-1) and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.188 s(-1) in 0.1 M KOH, comparing favorably with state-of-the-art RuO2, IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts. The synergy between abundant catalytically active sites through the fine dispersion of Co QDs, and enhanced electron transfer generated from the graphene resulted in first-rate electrocatalytic properties toward the OER. These merits coupled with the higher stability of the nanocomposite hold great promise for triggering breakthroughs in electrocatalysis for water splitting.									55	2	0	0	4	0	56			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000368040200031	26677009

RuxCo1-xOy nanotubes (0 < x < 0.77) were composed of both rutile (Ru in RuO2 is replaced with Co) and spinel (Co in Co3O4 is replaced with Ru) structures. This elemental substitution created oxygen vacancies in the rutile structure and also resulted in the incorporation of Ru3+ in the octahedral sites of the spinel structure. The as-prepared RuxCo1-xOy nanotubes were investigated for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity in 1.0 M HClO4 aqueous solution. RuxCo1-xOy nanotubes with x >= 0.47 presented an excellent OER activity comparable to pure RuO2, known to be the best OER catalyst. Even after more than half of the noble/active Ru content was replaced with cheap/less-active Co, Ru0.47Co0.53Oy showed a good OER activity and a greatly improved stability compared to RuO2 under the continuous OER. These attractive catalytic properties of RuxCo1-xOy can be attributed to the relatively large surface area of the tubular morphology and the substituted structures, presenting feasibility as a practical and economical OER catalyst.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000680884300001	34477652	
J	Ma, Liyang; Wang, Deming; Xin, Haihui; Qi, Xuyao; Dou, Guolan								The competitive reaction mechanism between oxidation and pyrolysis consumption during low-rank coal combustion at lean-oxygen conditions: A quantitative calculation based on thermogravimetric analyses								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING				96	12			2575	2585		10.1002/cjce.23176				DEC 2018	2018	The evolution of the oxidation-pyrolysis competitive mechanism during low-rank coal combustion at lean-oxygen conditions determines the development of the coalfield fires and the burning loss rate of the coal resource. In the present work, the mass increments of oxygen-chemisorption were measured and calculated firstly. An abstract shrinking core model was built for distinguishing the oxidation and pyrolysis pathways. On this basis, the consumption rates of oxidation and pyrolysis were respectively calculated with the TGA data obtained under the lean-oxygen gradient of 21-0 %. The results demonstrate that the oxidation path gradually delays in temperature while the pyrolysis exhibits great temperature stability as the oxygen concentration decreases. Besides, the significant transition of the competitive consumption mechanism exists below 9 % for the oxidation phase before ignition and 5 % for the combustion phase after ignition, respectively. Two temperature indicators of T-C1 and T-C2 for guiding the optimal fire extinguishing schemes based on the actual oxygen concentrations and temperatures are proposed. Furthermore, 1 % is identified as the limiting oxygen concentration for the development of the coalfield fires where the ignition mechanisms of both the HST and WD coal transform into the homogeneous ignition. The WD lignite, which always maintains the coke state as the burnout mechanism, holds higher reactivity but wider dispersion degrees of combustion compared with the HST sub-bituminous coal.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0008-4034	1939-019X		WOS:000450058800008

The porous structure of the Ni3FeN nanocube contributes to the adsorption of the Eosin-Y photosensitizer, while also ensuring sufficient exposed active sites. This aids in improved reaction kinetics of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. Moreover, the superior conductivity of ternary Ni3FeN promotes the transfer of charge carriers excited from Eosin-Y, which also promotes the photocatalytic performances of Ni3FeN/Eosin-Y systems. When used with Eosin-Y as a dye photosensitizer, the porous ternary Ni3FeN nanocube exhibits superior performance, which is more than 3.45, 3.83, and 1.31 times higher than that of the PBA, NiFeOx, and Prussian blue-derived Fe3N samples. The Ni3FeN catalyst exhibits an optimal H-2 production rate of 16.96 mmol g(-1) h(-1), with an apparent quantum efficiency of similar to 3.03% at 520 nm excitation wavelength.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000820160200001

Here, a flower-shaped platinum (Pt) nanocrystal with intensive high-surface area is developed as an intermediate layer for accumulating IrOx (<3 wt% Ir) with enhanced adhesion, showing a multiplier effect. The impedance of IrOx/Pt flower coated microelectrode at 1 kHz is down to approximate to 2 k omega (reduction of 94.23%). The corresponding cathodic charge storage capacity (CSCc) and charge injection capacity (CIC) are increased up to 202.75 +/- 2.18 and 6.53 +/- 0.16 mC cm(-2), respectively. IrOx layer adheres tightly to Pt nanocrystals, demonstrating robust chronic stability under continuous electrostimulation for 1 x 10(8) cycles. Besides, the as-prepared coatings show good biosafety, and exhibit promising electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.5 m sulfuric acid (H2SO4), requiring a low overpotential of approximate to 150 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2). IrOx helps in reducing the Tafel slope of Pt flower from 162.9 to 41.1 mV dec(-1) drastically, also with excellent durability after chronoamperometry test. Excellent antibacterial properties toward Escherichia coli are also observed. This coating strategy provides a functionalized flexible electrode for neural interface, water oxidation, and anti-microbial contamination, which will moreover extend to numerous applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-7350			WOS:000712104200001

Mo2N is a promising candidate in electrocatalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to its low-cost and resembled electronic properties. In this work, mesoporous Mo2N/NC composite catalysts are synthesized by polymerizing p-phenylenediamine (p-PDA) with ammonium heptamolybdate and following calcination under N-2 atmosphere. These catalysts show excellent HER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, allowing a low overpotential of 217 mV to produce H-2 at the electric current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with catalyst loading of 0.5 mg cm(-2). After 1000 cycles of acceleration degradation tests, Mo2N/ NC remains negligible overpotential losses. These stable electrochemical properties are mainly related to the strong interaction of Mo2N and NC materials, which accelerates the electron transfer further for hydrogen evolution, besides the unique mesoporous structures benefitting to the transmission of the electrolyte. This work also reveals the importance of amine's structure in synthesizing high-performance Mo2N anchored on N-doped carbon materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	TANG, XS; DINER, BA								BIOCHEMICAL AND SPECTROSCOPIC CHARACTERIZATION OF A NEW OXYGEN-EVOLVING PHOTOSYSTEM-II CORE COMPLEX FROM THE CYANOBACTERIUM SYNECHOCYSTIS PCC-6803								BIOCHEMISTRY				33	15			4594	4603		10.1021/bi00181a021				APR 19 1994	1994	We describe here a new procedure permitting rapid (12-13 h) isolation of a pure oxygen-evolving photosystem II (PSII) core complex from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803. This procedure involves dodecyl maltoside extraction of thylakoid membranes followed by single-step column chromatography using a weak anion-exchanger. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting show that the complex consists of five intrinsic membrane proteins (CP47, CP43, D1, D1, and cyt b(559)), one extrinsic protein (MSP), and one unknown protein with a molecular mass of approximately 26 kDa. A chemical and functional analysis, normalized to 2 molecules of pheophytin a, indicates that this PSII core complex contains 1 photoactive plastoquinone, Q(A), 4 manganese atoms, 38 chlorophyll a molecules, 1 cytochrome b(559), 2 plastoquinone-9, and 9-10 beta-carotenes. The complex exhibits high rates of oxygen evolution, typically 2400-2600 mu mol of O-2 (mg of Chl)(-1) h(-1) in the presence of 2,5-dichlorobenzoquinone as an artificial electron acceptor with a pH optimum of 6.5. A strong light minus dark multiline EPR signal, arising from the S-2 state of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), is observed at 10 K following illumination at 198 K. The determination of the absolute oxygen yield per saturating microsecond flash indicates that essentially all of the PSII centers contain functional oxygen-evolving complexes. This point is further supported by the absence of photoaccumulation, upon room temperature illumination, of the immediate oxidant of the OEC, redox-active tyrosine, Y-Z(.). On the basis of EPR spectra, oxidized minus reduced difference spectra, and SDS-PAGE, the preparation contains on a per mole basis with PSII only trace amounts of PSI (similar to 0.04) cytochrome b(6)/fcomplex (less than or equal to 0.01), and ATPase (less than or equal to 0.05). All of these results indicate that this PSII preparation is to date the most highly purified oxygen-evolving core complex from Synechocystis 6803 that retains all of the reaction centers active for oxygen evolution. As Synechocystis 6803 is being used extensively for site-directed mutagenesis of PSII, this preparation is particularly valuable for spectroscopic and biochemical analyses of PSII from wild-type and from site-directed mutants.									133	1	0	0	103	0	134			0006-2960			WOS:A1994NH49300021	8161515

This mutant cell line, designated HT-3, exhibited slightly above normal rates of oxygen evolution and appeared to accumulate somewhat more Photosystem II reaction centers than a control strain. A rapidly isolatable (< 7 h) oxygen-evolving Photosystem II preparation was prepared from HT-3 using dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside solubilization and Co2+ metal affinity chromatography. This histidine-tagged Photosystem II preparation stably evolved oxygen at a high rate (2440 mu mol O-2 (mg chl)(-1) h(-1)), exhibited an alpha-band absorption maximum at 674 nm, and was highly enriched in a number of Photosystem II components including cytochrome c(550). Fluorescence yield analysis using water or hydroxylamine as an electron donor to the Photosystem II preparation indicated that virtually ail of the Photosystem II reaction centers were capable of evolving oxygen. Proteins associated with Photosystem II were highly enriched in this preparation. 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine staining indicated that the histidine-tagged preparation was enriched in cytochromes c(550) and b(559) and depleted of cytochrome f: This result was confirmed by optical difference spectroscopy. This histidine-tagged Photosystem II preparation may be very useful for the isolation of Photosystem II preparations from mutants containing lesions in other Photosystem II proteins.

However, how to further increase catalytically active sites and then improve the corresponding catalytic activity is still a great challenge, which is critical for the design of an efficient OER electrocatalyst. Here, we present the in situ growth of ultrathin Ni-Fe LDH (u-Ni70Fe30 LDHs) nanosheets rich in catalytically active sites on the anodic polarized copper foil as an efficient electrocatalyst for OER through a mild electrodeposition approach (denoted as u-Ni70Fe30 LDHs/a-CF). We found that the u-Ni70Fe30 LDHs/a-CF shows a remarkable catalytic activity (the overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and superior catalytic stability (beyond 50 h) in basic media. The achieved ultrahigh catalytic performance of u-Ni70Fe30 LDHs/a-CF is primarily attributed to its ultrathin nanosheet structure, the optimized 30 at% Fe-dopant concentration, and the synergetic effect between the nanosheets and the bumps on a-CF. These reasons lead to the high density of exposed active sites and the improved mass/electron transport capability. In comparison with the other developed LDH based electrocatalysts reported to date, we provide a controllable and mild strategy for designing highly-efficient ultrathin LDH based electrocatalysts with desirable kinetics for future large-scale application in water splitting.									44	0	0	0	1	0	44			2052-1553			WOS:000405378500012

The phase and morphology evolution of the composite cathode were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The results showed that LBM had good chemical stability with SDC at 1 000 degrees C. Due to the introduction of SDC, the length of the thriple-phase boundary was extended and the thermal matching between the cathode and the electrolyte was enhanced, resulting in an improvement in the electrochemical performance of the composite cathode. The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) results indicated that the cathode polarization resistance (1?,) decreased steadily with the addition of SDC. The optimum addition of 30%(w/w) SDC in the composite cathode leads to the lowest R, of 0.186 Si"cm(2) at 700 degrees C in air, which is 74% less than the pristine LBM cathode (Rp=0.717 SZ "cm(2)). This is because an additional oxygen ion conduction path is generated after the introduction of SDC; thereby the oxygen reduction reaction is promoted. The maximum power density of the electrolyte-support single cell Ni-SDC/SDC/LBM-30% SDC reached 234 mW"cm' at 700 degrees C. The power density maintains a stable value at 230 mW"cm' throughout a test period of 90 h, indicating that LBM-30%SDC had sufficient stability during the operation.

J	Jo, Seung Geun; Kim, Chung-Soo; Kim, Sang Jun; Lee, Jung Woo								Phase-Controlled NiO Nanoparticles on Reduced Graphene Oxide as Electrocatalysts for Overall Water Splitting								NANOMATERIALS				11	12					3379	10.3390/nano11123379				DEC 2021	2021	Efficient water electrolysis is one of the key issues in realizing a clean and renewable energy society based on hydrogen fuel. However, several obstacles remain to be solved for electrochemical water splitting catalysts, which are the high cost of noble metals and the high overpotential of alternative catalysts. Herein, we suggest Ni-based alternative catalysts that have comparable performances with precious metal-based catalysts and could be applied to both cathode and anode by precise phase control of the pristine catalyst. A facile microwave-assisted procedure was used for NiO nanoparticles anchored on reduced graphene oxide (NiO NPs/rGO) with uniform size distribution in ~1.8 nm. Subsequently, the Ni-NiO dual phase of the NPs (A-NiO NPs/rGO) could be obtained via tailored partial reduction of the NiO NPs/rGO. Moreover, we demonstrate from systematic HADDF-EDS and XPS analyses that metallic Ni could be formed in a local area of the NiO NP after the reductive annealing procedure. Indeed, the synergistic catalytic performance of the Ni-NiO phase of the A-NiO NPs/rGO promoted hydrogen evolution reaction activity with an overpotential as 201 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), whereas the NiO NPs/rGO showed 353 mV. Meanwhile, the NiO NPs/rGO exhibited the most excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance among all of the Ni-based catalysts, with an overpotential of 369 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), indicating that they could be selectively utilized in the overall water splitting. Furthermore, both catalysts retained their activities over 12 h with constant voltage and 1000 cycles under cyclic redox reaction, proving their high durability. Finally, the full cell capability for the overall water electrolysis system was confirmed by observing the generation of hydrogen and oxygen on the surface of the cathode and anode.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2079-4991		WOS:000736781300001	34947728

Conversely, such reactive intermediates could also structurally modify the catalyst. A descriptor for the overall catalytic activity, the first electron and proton transfer OER intermediate from water, (M-OH*), has been associated with significant distortions of the metal-oxygen bonds upon chargetrapping. Time-resolved spectroscopy of in situ, photodriven OER on transition metal oxide surfaces has characterized M-OH* for the charge trapping and the symmetry of the lattice distortions by optical and vibrational transitions, respectively, but had yet to detect an interfacial strain field arising from a surface coverage M-OH*. Here, we utilize picosecond, coherent acoustic interferometry to detect the uniaxial strain normal to the SrTiO3/aqueous interface directly caused by Ti-OH*. The spectral analysis applies a fairly general methodology for detecting a combination of the spatial extent, magnitude, and generation time of the interfacial strain through the coherent oscillations' phase. For lightly n-doped SrTiO3, we identify the strain generation time (1.31 ps), which occurs simultaneously with Ti-OH* formation, and a tensile strain of 0.06% (upper limit 0.6%). In addition to fully characterizing this intermediate across visible, mid-infrared, and now GHz-THz probes on SrTiO3, we show that strain fields occur with the creation of some M-OH*, which modifies design strategies for tuning catalytic activity and provides insight into photo-induced degradation so prevalent for OER. To that end, the work put forth here provides a unique methodology to characterize intermediate-induced interfacial strain across OER catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000706193200011	34554748

In AORFBs, the chlorine evolution reaction should be retarded, not the hydrogen evolution reaction. To enhance the catalytic activity of the graphite felt(GF) electrode, the metal oxides were proposed to decorate on the GF surface. Among the loading oxides, significant enhancement of the mass transfer and reaction activity was obtained by the presence of LaSrO(x)nanoparticles. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle measurements revealed that the content of oxygen-containing groups and the hydrophilicity were remarkably increased. After the electrode assembled in the battery, the LaSrOx/GF electrode presented huge enhancement of the battery performance, obviously increasing in the battery capacity and efficiency. At a current of 50 Am/cm(2), the energy efficiency(EE) of the battery increased from 54.76% to 61.37% by the LaSrOx/GF electrode. Furthermore, the cyclability of the system tested that no obviously fading was observed after 100 cycles, signifying the excellent stability of the LaSrOx/GF electrode.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1005-9040	2210-3171		WOS:000541302900002

Although electrocatalytic systems based on cheap and earth-abundant copper catalysts have shown promise for water oxidation under basic conditions, only very few examples with high overpotential can be operated under acidic or neutral conditions, even though hydrogen evolution in the latter case is much easier. This work presents an efficient and robust Cu-based molecular catalyst, which self-assembles as a periodic film from its precursors under aqueous conditions on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode. This film catalyzes the OER under neutral conditions with impressively low overpotential. In controlled potential electrolysis, a stable catalytic current of 1.0 mA cm(-2)can be achieved at only 2.0 V (vs. RHE) and no significant decrease in the catalytic current is observed even after prolonged bulk electrolysis. The catalyst displays first-order kinetics and a single site mechanism for water oxidation with a TOF (k(cat)) of 0.6 s(-1). DFT calculations on of the periodic Cu(TCA)(2)(HTCA=1-mesityl-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4-carboxylic acid) film reveal that TCA defects within the film create Cu(I)active sites that provide a low overpotential route for OER, which involves Cu-I, Cu-II-OH, Cu-III=O and Cu-II-OOH intermediates and is enabled at a potential of 1.54 V (vs. RHE), requiring an overpotential of 0.31 V. This corresponds well with an overpotential of approximately 0.29 V obtained experimentally for the grown catalytic film after 100 CV cycles at pH 6. However, to reach a higher current density of 1 mA cm(-2), an overpotential of 0.72 V is required.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000557552100001	32667741

Herein, we have developed a simple hydrothermal strategy to construct a three dimensional nanoflower-like VOx nanosheets (VOx/NiS/NF) that utilizes S-modified NF as substrate. NiS/NF can provide not only high-surface area for the growth of VOx but also better conductivity and stability derived from NiS. XRD shows the formation of amorphous VOx supported on NiS/NF. XPS confirms the existence and valence state of V, Ni and S. EDX and SEM elemental mapping reveal the composition and great distribution of V, O, Ni and S. SEM and TEM show that the thin VOx nanosheets covered on the surface of NiS/NF uniformly, which implying more exposed active sites. OER measurements display that VOx/NiS/NF has the outstanding catalytic activity with the lower overpotential (330 mV, 50 mA cm(-2)), smaller tafel slope (121 mV dec(-1)) and lower value of semicircle of EIS than VOx/NF. The modification of NF may be the key for enhancement performances for OER due to reduced charge transfer resistance. The strong durability of VOx/NiS/NF may be attributed to the tighter integration between VOx and NiS/NF in alkaline electrolytes. The impressive results may provide a new strategy to design suitable substrate with good dispersion and conductivity to prepare effective electrocatalysts for OER.

J	Yan, Bo; Du, Chun; Yang, Guowei								Constructing Built-in Electric Field in Ultrathin Graphitic Carbon Nitride Nanosheets by N and O Codoping for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Activity								SMALL				16	4					1905700	10.1002/smll.201905700		DEC 2019		JAN 2020	2020	Codoping of N and O in ultrathin graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets leads to an inner electric field. This field restrains the recombination of photogenerated carriers and, thus, enhances hydrogen evolution. The layered structure of codoped g-C3N4 nanosheets (N-O-CNNS) not only provides abundant sites of contact with the reaction medium, but also decreases the distance over which the photogenerated electron-hole pairs are transported to the reaction interface. Quantum confinement in the ultrathin structure results in an increased bandgap and makes the photocatalytic reaction more favorable than bulk g-C3N4. Under visible light irradiation, N-O-CNNS with 3 wt% Pt achieves a hydrogen evolution rate of 9.2 mmol g(-1) h(-1) and a value of 46.9 mmol g(-1) h(-1) under AM1.5 with 5 wt% Pt. Thus, this work paves the way for designing efficient nanostructures with increased separation/transfer efficiency of photogenerated carriers and, hence, increased photocatalytic activities.									52	3	0	0	6	0	53			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000504699600001	31885160

The back-to-back ligation presents a novel new mononuclear manganese catalytic centre that functions as a heterogeneous catalysis for the evolution of oxygen in the presence of an exogenous oxidant. We discuss the synthesis and spectroscopic characterizations of this complex and propose a mechanism for oxygen evolution activity of the compound in the presence of oxone. The di-manganese complex also shows efficient and selective catalytic oxidation of sulfides in the presence of H2O2. Density functional theory calculations were used to assess the structural optimization of the complex and a proposed reaction pathway with oxone. The calculations show that middle benzene ring is distorted respect to both of metallic centers, and this in turn leads to negligible resonance of electrons between two sides of complex. The calculations also indicate the unpaired electron located on oxyl-ligand emphasizes the radical mechanism of water oxidation for the system.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000308889300042	22930068

Highly concentrated electrolytes expand the voltage window; however, they are limited by high cost and potential toxicity. Here, we develop a hydrogen bond-anchored electrolyte by introducing sulfolane as hydrogen bond acceptor to limit water activity. The designed electrolyte expands the voltage window to 3.4 V (1.3-4.7 V versus Li+/Li) and forms a hierarchical anode-electrolyte interphase to suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction. An aqueous Li4Ti5O12/LiMn2O4 full cell achieved 141 W h kg(-1) for 300 cycles at 1 C and 125 W h kg(-1) for 1,000 cycles at 5 C with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.5%- 99.9%. On-line electrochemical mass spectroscopy shows negligible hydrogen/oxygen gas evolution upon cycling, further confirming the stability of the designed electrolyte. This work demonstrates a rational and effective approach to suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction and achieve stable high-voltage aqueous batteries.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2590-2393	2590-2385		WOS:000741547800002

Weight loss curves suggest three kinds of reactions involved in the pyrolysis, namely, initiation reactions, reactions splitting off volatile fragments, and reactions forming stabilized structures. In TG, in both helium and air atmospheres, the active weight loss of the melamine resin was completed in two steps, and that of the urea resin was completed in one step, which, however, consisted of a few small successive steps. The isothermal heating weight losses progressed through a few stages of first-and zeroth-order reactions. Arrhenius parameters were obtained for the weight losses in TG and with isothermal heating. The residue from the melamine resin is rich in carbon and nitrogen, and poor in oxygen and hydrogen, while that from the urea resin is rich in carbon, and poor in nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen. The effects of temperature on HCN yield changed, depending on the amount of air fed. The melamine resin evolved much more HCN than the urea resin because of the more stable C-N linkages in the resin.									37	4	0	0	2	0	42			0021-8995			WOS:A1991FM75900008

The effects of oxidation temperature (200-350 degrees C), oxygen concentration (5-21 vol %) and oxidation time (30-120 min) on the degree of char oxidation are analyzed. The results obtained by thermogravimetric and elemental analysis, and Fourier Transform Infrared and X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy corroborate the incorporation of oxygenated functional groups on the surface of sewage sludge char either at low temperature (200 degrees C) using air or at higher temperature (350 degrees C) using 5% O-2 for 30 min. The oxidation of sewage sludge char hardly increases its specific surface area. The operating conditions during oxidation must be carefully controlled to avoid runaway reactions that lead to total oxidation of char. The evolution of CO and CO2 during oxidation is a good indicator of the advance of the oxidation/burn-off reactions. The ammonium adsorption capacity of sewage sludge char increases after oxidation under mild operating conditions, providing support to the idea of onsite utilization of sewage sludge as ammonium adsorbent in waste water treatment plants. This would provide a step forward towards the implementation of a circular economy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000620275100005

The development of highly efficient and low-costing electrocatalysts for the ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) associated with ammonia removal is subsequently crucial. In this study, for the first time, the authors demonstrate that a perovskite oxide LaNi0.5Cu0.5O3-delta after being annealed in Ar (LNCO55-Ar), is an excellent non-noble bifunctional catalyst towards both AOR and HER, making it suitable as a symmetric ammonia electrolyser (SAE) in alkaline medium. In contrast, the LNCO55 sample fired in air (LNCO55-Air) is inactive towards AOR and shows very poor HER activity. Through combined experimental results and theoretical calculations, it is found that the superior AOR and HER activities are attributed to the increased active sites, the introduction of oxygen vacancies, the synergistic effect of B-site cations and the different active sites in LNCO55-Ar. At 1.23 V, the assembled SAE demonstrates approximate to 100% removal efficiency in 2210 ppm ammonia solution and >70% in real landfill leachate. This work opens the door for developments towards bifunctional catalysts, and also takes a profound step towards the development of low-costing and simple device configuration for ammonia electrolysers.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2198-3844		WOS:000705033500001	34626099

The NiFeSe-4/Ni foam electrode had the best water oxidation activity of all the electrodes tested, and a relatively low overpotential of 235 mV was required to attain a current density of 100 mA/cm(2) in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, in basic solutions, this electrode exhibits outstanding catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reactions.

The synthesis of nanostructure catalysts is an effective method for improving the OER performance, but nanostructure-based catalysts are easily destroyed by mechanical force via the vigorous oxygen gas evolution process at a high current density. Herein, we present a facile strategy of N-anion and Fe-cation dual doping to construct a three-dimensional self- supported nickel selenide film-based catalyst via a one-step chemical vapor deposition process. The film exhibits outstanding OER activity with a small Tafel slope of 34.86 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential of 267 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH media. Impressively, the film-based catalyst can maintain this excellent catalytic activity over 100 h, even when operated at a high current density of 1 A cm(-2), thus exhibiting the best reported OER stability under high current density so far. Further studies reveal that anion-cation co-doping can simultaneously modulate the electronic state and phase structure of nickel selenide, thereby promoting the in situ formation and transformation of oxygen-vacancy-rich amorphous OER active species and resulting in the superior OER performance of the film-based catalyst.									17	2	0	0	4	0	17			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000488322900026	31469539

The types of reactive oxygen species participated in CO oxidation may affect the way CO react with neighboring oxygen atoms. Additionally, the negative effect of water and CO2 on the catalytic activity was also studied. Considering the remarkable reactivity towards CO, the Co3O4 catalysts were integrated onto metallic and cordierite monolithic substrates and used for CO conversion as application. SEM examinations show that the catalyst layer was coated on the substrates uniformly with few microcracks, and desirable mechanical shock and thermal shock resistance was observed. The influence of substrate materials, gas hourly space velocity, the existence of water vapor and CO2, and reaction time on the CO oxidation performance of monolithic catalysts was investigated. Metallic monolithic catalysts performed higher CO oxidation activity mainly owing to superior heat conductivity and larger surface area compared with cordierite monolithic catalysts. It is noticeable that superior activity was also achieved under high gas flow with the existence of H2O (5.6 vol.%) and CO2 (7 vol.%) at 220 degrees C, suggesting great promise for practical application.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000494893600022

However, its applications as the photoanodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting have been greatly restricted owing to the intrinsically poor charge transport and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. Herein, we demonstrated that the PEC performances of Bi2WO6 photoanodes could be remarkably enhanced by the well-crystallized construction, which could achieve the favorable conductivity for the bulk charge transport. More importantly, amorphous Co(OH)(x) nanofilms with optimized oxidation state were decorated on Bi2WO6 photoanode by a facile impregnation method, an unprecedented photocurrent density of 0.94 mA/cm(2) and a high surface charge separation efficiency of 98% at 1.23 V-RHE has been achieved, more than 58-fold enhanced OER activity compared with traditional Bi2WO6 sample. These results demonstrated that the appropriate crystal construction and cocatalyst decoration with tunable oxidation state could serve as an effective strategy toward developing high-efficiency PEC water splitting systems.

Lowering O-2 concentration (<1 mu M) suppressed PGA-dependent O-2 evolution rate. High O-2 concentration (about 250 mM) enhanced the electron fluxes in Photosystem II (PSII). Also, high O-2 concentration oxidized both Q(A) in PSII and Cyt f in thylakoid membranes. These results indicated that the MAP pathway stimulated photosynthetic electron transport. Furthermore, electrochromic shift signal was also increased at high O-2 concentration, compared to low O-2 concentration. Non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence was also enhanced at high O-2 concentration. These data support our hypothesis that the MAP pathway functioned in intact chloroplasts and accelerated PGA-dependent O-2 evolution by inducing Delta pH formation to produce and supply adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the conversion reaction of PGA to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate through 1,3-diphosphoglycerate in chloroplasts.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0038-0768			WOS:000308112500008

The catalysts have been prepared using the colloid-based reverse ldquowater-in-oilrdquo microemulsion method and characterized by BET, XRD, SEM, EDS techniques. The recombination reaction of hydrogen and oxygen has been monitored using Microscal gasflow through microcalorimeter. This technique was also applied to follow hydrogen sorption by the Pd-Pt/ MoO3 catalyst resulting in the formation of molybdenum bronzes (HXMoO3). The pattern of changes in both the heat evolution and the conversion of hydrogen clearly show much better performance of Pd-Pt/SiO2 catalyst. On Pd-Pt/ MoO3 catalyst the conversion of H2 was lower whereas the amount of evolved heat was higher because of exothermic reaction of bronzes formation. In contrast to Pd-Pt/SiO2 catalyst offering stable activity, the activity of Pd-Pt/MoO3 decreased during the catalytic test.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			2300-3561			INSPEC:15468300

Designing high-performance OER electrocatalyst is key to the high electrochemical activity. Noblemetal-free electrochemical OER electmcatalysts become the major trend. Herein, we report a facile ballmilling method to prepare red phosphorus (BP)-black phosphorus (BP)/expended graphite (EG) toward OER electrocatalysis. By virtue of the high temperature and shearing force generated in the ball-milling process, a portion of red phosphorus can be in-situ transferred into chemical active BP and formed the RP-BP heterostructure. Meantime, the EG flakes are cut and exfoliated into defect-rich graphene nanosheets and thin EG flakes, reacting with the RP-BP heterostructure through P-C and P-O-C bonds. The hybridization of RP-BP and EG improves the electroconductivity and facilitate more active electrocatalytic sites toward OER. The results demonstrate that RP-BP/EG heterostructure shows good OER performance with a low overpotential of 328 mV vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), lower than commercial IrO2 (330 mV vs. RHE, 10 mA cm(-2)). A very small Tafel slope of 58 mV.dec(-1) indicates the high electron transmission on the RP-BP/EG catalyst. The stable structure of RP-BP/EG provides the long-term durability of the RP-BP/EG catalysts in OER.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000523640600007

Herein, a Co-doped NiO/NiFe2O4 mixed oxide mesoporous nanosheet array on Ni foam with controllable composition and morphology is constructed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst by a facile solvothermal synthesis method using methanol as a solvent and a reactant, followed by annealing in air. The well-connected mesoporous nanosheet array provides a large number of catalytically active sites and buffers the large volume changes that occur during the electrochemical process. Moreover, NiFe2O4 has a catalytic active phase that plays a significant role in improving the catalytic activity, and Co2+ doping in NiO/NiFe2O4 can increase the conductivity and activate the Ni sites at lower overpotentials via charge transfer effects. As a result, the optimized Co-doped NiO/NiFe2O4 mixed oxide mesoporous nanosheet array Co6.25Fe18.75Ni75Ox exhibits excellent OER activity with a small overpotential of 186 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 38.5 mV dec(-1). It also presents outstanding HER activity, only requiring a small overpotential of 84 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2), along with a low Tafel slope of 53.6 mV dec(-1). Moreover, this Co6.25Fe18.75Ni75Ox electrode remains stable for 1000 cyclic voltammogram cycles and 12 hours of galvanostatic measurements in both OER and HER. A two-electrode electrolyzer using bifunctional Co6.25Fe18.75Ni75Ox as both the anode and cathode demonstrates active and stable overall water splitting performance with a cell voltage of only 1.583 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This study explores multimetal Ni-Fe mixed oxide as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water electrolysis.									123	8	0	0	2	0	125			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000418378600020

Herein, an NiCo2O4 nanoparticle-decorated nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheet (NiCo2O4/N-G) is synthesized as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. The ultrasmall NiCo2O4 nanoparticle with an average particle size of 4 nm can introduce plentiful reaction active sites. Furthermore, the N-G nanosheets with small dimensions of 200 nm possess an extremely large specific surface area and can effectively restrict the aggregation of NiCo2O4 nanoparticles and promote species transport. Compared with NiCo2O4 and N-G, NiCo2O4/N-G exhibits a higher ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity in alkaline electrolytes, and it demonstrates almost comparable ORR activity but superior stability to commercial Pt/C. Using the NiCo2O4/N-G catalyst, a home-built Zn-air battery demonstrates a peak power density of 108.3 mW cm(-2), an excellent discharge capacity of up to 792.6 mAh g(Zn)(-1), and a superior energy density of up to 879.9 Wh kg. Moreover, stable charge-discharge voltage gaps and an energy efficiency of similar to 63% at 10 mA cm(-2) can sustain for over 540 cycles during cycling, indicating excellent cycling stability.									8	0	0	0	0	0	7			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000692131800057

Herein, an atomically thin Ni3S2/MnO2 heterogeneous nanoarray located on Ni foam (NF-Ni3S2/MnO2) is developed for overall water splitting. The construction strategy involves a simple two-step hydrothermal conversion, and the morphology and composition of the hybrid nanoarray can be easily customized. The fabricated NF-Ni3S2/MnO2 with a certain exposed interface and active sites perfectly integrated and optimized the advantages of both several layered Ni3S2 and MnO2, realizing the desired fast kinetics and outstanding performance for overall water splitting in alkaline media. Consequently, the constructed NF-Ni3S2/MnO2 reveals a low overpotential (eta(10)) of 102 mV and 260 mV at a 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 1.0 M KOH for HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, it achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of only 1.52 V throughout the overall water splitting, which is outperforming the currently reported Pt/C-IrO2/C couple. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations evidence that the excellent total hydrolysis of NF-Ni3S2/MnO2 is attributed to the hierarchical heterointerfaces, which results in effective adsorption and cleavage of H2O molecule on the catalyst surface.									87	3	0	0	2	0	87			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000472697500033

Fluctuations of both electrode potential and electrolyte resistance, recorded under galvanostatic polarization, have been analysed in order to separate ohmic and non-ohmic contributions. The anode materials compared in this study were PbO2 and composite oxides consisting of a PbO2 matrix and variable amounts of catalytic dispersed phases (CO3O4, RuO2 and hydrous Co oxides); the composite oxide layers were generally obtained by anodic codeposition of fine particles (typically 0.1-1 mum in size) with a PbO2 matrix electrochemically grown by Pb2+ oxidation. The power spectral density (PSD) of the electrolyte resistance fluctuations is very similar for PbO2 and composite electrodes, suggesting a similar gas evolution profile. On the contrary, the potential PSD is markedly different for PbO2 and composites containing catalytic particles. In the latter case, the potential fluctuations are entirely due to ohmic effects, while non-ohmic components are clearly dominant in the case of O-2 evolution on pure PbO2, probably because of the much higher activation overpotential. Furthermore, on PbO, electrodes a plateau was obtained at intermediate frequencies (0.1-10 Hz), which was tentatively explained by bubble coalescence phenomena. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the large-scale application of this process is restricted by the high electricity consumption due to the large potential gap (>1.23 V) between the anodic oxygen evolution reaction and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a novel and efficient hydrogen production system is developed for coupling glucose-assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox with HER. The onset potential of the electrooxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) is as low as 0.7 V-RHE (vs reversible hydrogen electrode). In situ Raman spectroscopy, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculation demonstrates that glucose in the electrolyte can reduce the Cu(II) into Cu(I) instantaneously via a thermocatalysis process, thus completing the cycle of Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox. The assembled electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 0.92 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Consequently, the electricity consumption for per cubic H-2 produced in the system is 2.2 kWh, only half of the value for conventional water electrolysis (4.5 kWh). This work provides a promising strategy for the low-cost, efficient production of high-purity H-2.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000698861000001	34561909

The irradiation was carried out at normal incidence relative to the target surface with the irradiation beam being used as the analysis beam. The evolution of the overall damage during irradiation was evaluated by measuring the variation of the energy loss of the deuteron beam passing through the target. For this purpose, a solid state Si detector placed at it forward angle of 30 degrees relative to the incident beam direction was used. The NRA spectra recorded by a second Si detector located backward at 150 degrees allowed the evaluation of the carbon and the oxygen depletion. The beam spot size was circular in shape and 1 mm in diameter and the beam current wits set at 5 nA. The ion fluence was increased up to the value of 2.5 x 10(16) deuterons/cm(2). It was observed that the target energy loss decreased steadily as the fluence increased and levelled off at high fluence. The O-16(d,p(0))O-17, O-16(d,p(1))O-17(center dot) and C-12(d,p(0))C-13 reactions were used for monitoring the evolution of the oxygen and carbon content as a function of the deuteron fluence. A monotonic decrease of the oxygen content with the increase of ion fluence was observed. At the highest fluence the oxygen depletion reached a value of about 75%. For carbon, a weak depletion was observed at fluence ranging from 2.5 X 10(15) d/cm(2) to 1.0 X 10(16) d/cm(2) followed by a levelling-off with a total loss around 20%. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The composite layers have been tested as electrode materials for oxygen evolution from basic media, and found to be rather effective electrocatalysts characterized by the following features: overpotential (eta) at j = 100 mA cm(-2) ca. 475 mV, Tafel slope close to 60 mV decade(-1), linear dependence of j on [OH-]. Significant electrocatalytic activity could be achieved with a Co3O4 loading as low as 2.10(-5) g cm(-2). The electrode performance was maintained during a 14 day electrolysis carried out at room temperature with j = 100 mA cm(-2). Partial reduction of the composite layer was found to activate the composite electrodes, by decreasing eta to ca. 415 mV (at j = 100 mA cm(-2)). However this activation was not long lasting.									19	3	0	0	1	0	20			0013-4651			WOS:000071969500038

However, the poor electrical conductivity of metal-sulfide materials impedes their practical application in energy devices. Herein, firstly nano-sized crystals of cobalt-based zeolitic-imidazolate framework (Co-ZIF) arrays were fabricated on nickel-form (NF) as the sacrificial template by a facile solution method to enhance the electrical conductivity of the electrocatalyst. Then, the Co3S4/NiS@NF heterostructured arrays were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal route. The Co-ZIFs derived Co3S4 nanosheets are grown successfully on NiS nanorods during the hydrothermal sulfurization process. The bimetallic sulfide-based Co3S4/NiS@NF-12 electrocatalyst demonstrated a very low overpotential of 119 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, which is much lower than that of mono-metal sulfide NiS@NF (201 mV) and ruthenium-oxide (RuO2) on NF (440 mV) electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the Co3S4/NiS@NF-12 electrocatalyst showed high stability during cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry measurements.

It is well accepted that improving the oxygen adsorption capacity is beneficial to the catalytic activity of La1-xSrxMnO3 (LSM) perovskites. Herein, we synthesized the LSM-based composite by compositing La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 with Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (CZ) which is used as an excellent oxygen storage material by a two-step solution method. The LSM-CZ composite is revealed as a novel electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction with the direct four-electron transfer mechanism and a positive onset potential in comparison with the commercial Pt/C catalyst. And its onset potential is almost the most positive one among those of the perovskites stemmed from LaMnO3. In addition, the stability of LSMCZ is even superior to that of Pt/C, and LSM-CZ almost accumulates no intermediate product of HO2- (similar to 0.8%) after aging for 100 000 seconds. By using LSM-CZ as the ORRC, the maximum power density of the aluminum-air battery can reach 233.4 mW cm(-2).

The XRD and FESEM analyses revealed that the phase structure and morphology of NCS nanoparticles were substantially influenced by the graphene contents. The phase structure of NCS nanoparticles gradually transformed from primary NiCo2S4 to Ni0.37Co0.63S2 and the morphology and size of NCS nanoparticles were found to become more regular and homogeneous with the increase of graphene concentration. On the NCS@rGO-x nanocomposites, the NCS@rGO-2 sample demonstrated the best catalytic activity toward the OER, which delivers a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of similar to 276 mV (vs. RHE) with a Tafel slope as low as 48 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, the NCS@rGO-2 sample showed the remarkable photocatalytic activity for degradation of methylene blue (MB), which may be attributed to the increased reaction sites and high separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carries due to the electronic interaction between NCS nanoparticles and rGO. All these impressive performances indicate that the NCS@rGO-2 nanocomposite is a promising catalyst in energy and environmental fields.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000391390500019

The electrode demonstrates superior performance toward catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction (OER), affording a low overpotential of 0.23 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), high Faradaic efficiency of approximate to 98%, and stable operation for >60 h. Meanwhile, the electrode can dynamically change its color from gray silver to dark black with the OER happening, and the coloration/bleaching processes persist for at least 5000 cycles, rendering it a useful tool to monitor the catalytic process. Mechanism study reveals that the excellent structural properties of electrode such as 3D conductive framework, ultra thickness of N-NiFe LDH nanolayer (approximate to 0.8 nm), and high N-doping content (approximate to 17.8%) make significant contribution to achieving enhanced catalytic performance, while N-NiFe LDH nanolayer on electrode is the main contributor to the stimuli-responsive property with the reversible extraction/insertion of electrons from/into N-NiFe LDH leading to the coloration/bleaching processes. Potential application of this electrode has been further demonstrated by integrating it into a Zn-air battery device to identify the charging process during electrochemical cycling.									159	6	0	0	4	0	160			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000362161500012

A graphical representation of the photovoltaic current-voltage data is introduced which allows for an estimation of the maximum achievable solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of the integrated device. Furthermore, a simple yet very useful series circuit model is used to predict the photoelectrochemical performance of the integrated device in a more elaborate way when the j-V characteristics of the individual components are known. Within the model, the j-V characteristics of each component can be either modeled with parameters from the literature or measured. The photocathode, the electrolyte concentration, and the hydrogen and oxygen evolving catalysts were varied exemplarily and the impact of each component on the integrated device performance was evaluated. A maximum solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 9.5% was found using a triple junction solar cell functionalized with a Pt catalyst for the hydrogen evolution and a RuO2 catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction in a 1M KOH electrolyte. This result was confirmed experimentally and is compared to efficiencies reported in the literature. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These atmospheric reactions also played a role in determining the oxidation state of sulfur, implying that atmospheric oxygen partial pressures were Low and that the roles of oxidative weathering and of microbial oxidation and reduction of sulfur were minimal. Atmospheric fractionation processes should be considered in the use of sulfur isotopes to study the onset and consequences of microbial fractionation processes in Earth's early history.									1227	60	5	0	302	0	1285			0036-8075			WOS:000088581500034	10926533

Herein, a newly developed hybrid catalyst (denoted as CoFe@NC/KB-800) consisting of hollow CoFe alloy and nitrogen-doped Ketjen Black is synthesized by pyrolysis of a novel Fe-glucosamine coated cobalt-based metal-organic framework. By virtue of ultra-high specific surface area of 1318.8 m(2) g(-1) and micro-/meso-/macropore structure, the optimal CoFe@NC/KB-800 catalyst exhibits a low reversible oxygen overpotential (Delta E) of 0.77 V between ORR and OER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations validate that the superior catalytic activity is ascribed to synergistic CoFe@NC structure. Impressively, liquid ZAB catalyzed by CoFe@NC/KB-800 displays a high peak power density of 160 mW cm(-2)and a low voltage gap of 0.65 V after 600 cycles. Three all-solid-state ZABs in series can successfully light LED (similar to 2.2 V), displaying tremendous potentials in portable devices.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000723893500002

The aim of this research was to emulate operating conditions similar-to those usually found in moderate or intense low oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion of coal, including high temperature and low oxygen environment. The iexperimental setup decouples chemical kinetics from complex processes as aerodynamics phenomena. Additionally, it does,not require oxygen nitrogen mixture,preparation or electrical heaters. In a first stage, both simulations and experiments were-done-With natural gas, testing, several lean equivalence ratios and unburned gas velocities in the burner to obtain a hot and diluted environment. Then, in a second stage, the coal was suspended at a fixed distance-from the burner surface in, 4 and 8% v/v oxygen levels. The obtained results show quantitative evolution profiles for CO, CO2, O-2, and NO, as well as, N and C releases during the combustion of coal emulating the MILD Combustion conditions. This approach is an option for tracking combustion products and physicochemical changes of the solid fuel during reactions, such as those that take place in coal MILD combustion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000400039800121

In this study, a novel core-shell electroactive material architecture is developed by electrodepositing cobalt sulfide shell over core NiCo2O4 structure on Ni-Foam substrate, which is developed by hydrothermal process. The synergistic effect of the three-dimensional chrysanthemum-like NiCo(2)O(4 )with CoS shell exhibits superior activity towards oxygen evolution reaction with high durability and lower onset potential obtained at 1.52 V vs. RHE (over-potential 290 mV @ 10 mA/cm(2)) in alkaline solution. The electron pairs from NiCo2O4 and CoS along with increased active sites from their interfacial interaction considerably improve the charge transfer phenomena. The electrocatalytic activity in the presence of urea is also investigated, which aids in reducing the onset potential to 118.4 mV vs. RHE. A considerably higher current density of 78 mA/cm(2) is achieved at the potential of 0.5 V, which is comparatively higher than that of other electrocatalysts. Thus, the activity from sulfide/oxide core-shell architectures proves to have a high potential in efficient electrochemical reactivity producing green energy.									51	0	0	0	8	0	51			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000573512700007

However, limited knowledge of the mechanisms underlying this oxidation reaction hampers the ability to rationally design effective catalysts. Herein, using in situ spectroelectrochemical techniques, we demonstrate that the stabilization of surface-associated intermediate Mn3+ species relative to charge disproportionation is an effective strategy to lower the overpotential for water oxidation by MnO2. The formation of N-Mn bonds via the coordination of amine groups of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) to the surface Mn sites of MnO2 electrodes effectively stabilized the Mn3+ species, resulting in an similar to 500-mV negative shift of the onset potential for the O-2 evolution reaction at neutral pH.									261	10	0	0	33	1	263			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000310720900001	23088413

Transition-metal phosphides with a similar structure to the hydrogenase enzyme are emerging as promising electrocatalysts for the HER, but their catalytic activity for overall water splitting is kinetically retarded. Herein, a facile and effective strategy is provided for fabricating hierarchical porous nanorods composed of ultrathin CoP nanosheets on nickel foam (NF) by direct phosphidation of MOF-derived Co(OH)(2)nanosheets. The unique porous and ultrathin nanosheet structure endows the resulting catalyst with abundant exposed active sites and boundary defects, short ion diffusion paths, and improved conductivity, which are favorable for improving its catalytic performance. Consequently, the hierarchical CoP/NF electrode shows highly efficient electrocatalytic activity with long-term durability for the HER under universal-pH conditions. Surprisingly, the CoP/NF also displays superior OER performance in alkaline solutions. Furthermore, the practical application of CoP/NF as a bifunctional catalyst for the overall water splitting reaction yields a low cell voltage of only 1.54 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), much better than those for many reported bifunctional catalysts.									66	5	0	0	4	0	67			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000573889000006

The technique of the hanging meniscus rotating Pt single-crystal electrode (HMRE) was used. The kinetic parameters of O-2 reduction on Pt(lll), Pt(110) and Pt(100) were measured and the structural sensitivity and the influence of adsorbed species, especially adsorbed hydrogen, hydrogen sulphate ion and water, were examined. It was found that (1) the structure sensitivity of the O-2 reduction was not confirmed within the present experimental accuracy, (2) the ''overshoot'', appearing in the negative-going scan, resulted mainly from the O-2 diffusion transportation, and the adsorption of the hydrogen sulphate ion which was strongest on Pt(lll) retarded the O-2 reduction, (3) upd-H did not take part in this reaction, although the chemical H-2-O-2 reaction is rapid at Pt in gas phase, and (4) the sharp depression of the O-2 diffusion limiting current in a potential range of 0-0.1 V(RHE) was explained by a sharp decrease in the number of the vacant upd-H sites under the condition of almost full coverage. Thus, O-2 reduction is discussed as a process proceeding via adsorbed oxygen on the sites usually occupied by upd-H.									36	0	0	0	0	0	36			0022-0728			WOS:A1994PX03700046

Vacancy-rich layered materials with good electromigration properties are of great interests. Herein, we synthesized fullspectrum responsive vacancy-rich BiO2-x ultra-thin nanosheets (UTNSs). The band gap is narrowed and the edge of valence band is increased in the BiO(2-x )UTNSs, which are responsible for the enhanced light response and are confirmed by UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), electronic spin resonance (ESR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and valence measurement. Compared to BiO2-x nanosheets (NSs), BiO2-x UTNSs exhibits enhanced photocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution under full-spectrum irradiation, which can be attributed to the oxygen vacancies. The presence of oxygen vacancies in BiO2-x UTNSs promote the oxidation ability. This finding provides defect level understanding for developing highly efficient full-spectrum light responsive photocatalysts.									47	1	0	0	4	0	47			0927-0248	1879-3398		WOS:000466454600037

ZABs with neutral electrolytes can avoid or mitigate many side reactions harassing alkaline ZABs because neutral electrolyte is mild and green, which is conducive to battery life. However, the development of neutral ZABs is still in an initial stage. In this review, we would like to summarize the recent progress of neutral electrolytes and electrocatalysts, which are applied in or beyond ZABs. The working mechanism of ZABs is first introduced, especially oxygen electro-chemistry on cathode. After elucidating the disadvantages of alkaline electrolytes, several neutral and near -neutral electrolytes are then summarized on developments as well as challenges, such as inorganic/organic salt solutions, high concentration electrolytes and quasi-solid electrolytes. Next, different cathode structures and their impacts on catalysts are presented. The latest progress of different catalysts in neutral electrolytes are classified and summarized, including metal oxides, metal phosphides/sulfides, metal phosphates, single-atom catalysts, etc. Finally, we conclude with a summary and propose a brief outlook for the future developments of electrolytes and oxygen catalysts applied in neutral ZABs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000854984500002

The cathode was illuminated for 12 h each day (from 8:00 h to 20:00 h). 25 days was necessary to achieve steady state conditions. The time evolution of dissolved oxygen and cell voltage were assessed over the course of each day. As expected, the dissolved oxygen values were not constant throughout the day, reaching maximum values between 14:00 h and 20:00 h when dark phase reactions began and the algae started to consume oxygen. Cell voltage (R-ext 120 Omega) followed the same trend as the oxygen profile. The supply of CO2 in the cathode was also studied, and half an hour was enough time to get the system working properly. During the acclimation stage, power density increased up to 13.5 mW m(-2) at steady state conditions. However, impedance analysis showed that polarization resistance was higher at the cathode than at the anode. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that the studied system is a feasible method to treat wastewater in a self-sustainable way. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, a high mass loading of these catalysts is commonly needed to achieve acceptable catalytic performance, which could cause such problems as battery weight gain, mass transport blocking, and catalyst loss. We report herein the preparation of fine CoNi nanoparticles (5-6 nm) anchored inside a nitrogen-doped defective carbon nanotube network (CoNi@N-DCNT) by a transient Joule heating method. When utilized as an electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction and evolution in alkaline media, the CoNi@N-DCNT film catalyst with a very low mass loading of 0.06 mg cm(-2) showed excellent bifunctional catalytic performance. For ORR, the onset potential (E-onset) and the half-wave potential (E-1/2) were 0.92 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and 0.83 V (vs. RHE), respectively. For OER, the potential at the current density (I) of 10 mA cm(-2) (E-10) was 1.53 V, resulting in an overpotential of 300 mV much lower than that of the commercial RuO2 catalyst (320 mV). The potential gap between E-1/2 and E(10 )was as small as 0.7 V. Considering the low mass loading, the mass activity at E-10 reached at 123.2 A g(-1), much larger than that of the RuO2 catalyst and literature results of transitional metal-based bifunctional catalysts. Moreover, the CoNi@N-DCNT film catalyst showed very good long-term stability during the ORR and OER test. The excellent bifunctional catalytic performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the bimetal alloy.

Copper is known for its excellent conductivity and thermal management applications. When it comes to hydrogen evolution reaction, it is highly unstable, especially in KOH solution. In this paper, we approached a simple method to reduce corrosion and improve the performance by depositing nickel-molybdenum oxide and nickel on copper substrates and the achieved tafel slopes of 115 mV/dec and 117 mV/dec at 10 mA/cm(2). While at first, molybdenum oxide coated samples showed better performance after 100 cycles of stability tests, the onset potential rapidly changed. Cu-Ni, which was deposited using the electron gun evaporation (e-gun), has shown better performance with 0.28 V at 10 mA/cm(2) and led to stability after 100 cycles. Our results show that when copper is alloyed with nickel, it acts as a promising hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2073-4344		WOS:000746517400001

URFC is a viable energy storage system owing to its high specific packaged and theoretical energy densities of 400-1000 Wh/kg and 3660 Wh/kg, respectively. Nevertheless, during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the stability and durability of the URFC unit cell was severely affected by various degradation factors in the stacked cell. The certain issues are related to the (i) electrocatalysts (high cost, aggregation, migration, and supportive material corrosion), (ii) dissolution and cracks in the Nafion binder, (iii) physical degradation and higher cost of polymer membrane, and severe carbon corrosion in (iv) gas diffusion packing and (v) bipolar plates. Among these factors, the critical challenges are the severe carbon corrosion and durability of the membrane in the unit cell regions. The degradation occurs in the supporting material of the electrocatalyst, gas diffusion packing, and bipolar plate owing to carbon corrosion because of the high applied potential in the water electrolyzer mode. Recent developments are significantly enhancing the durability and overcoming the limitations in the URFC system. In this comprehensive review, we have pointed out the limitations, challenges, and critical developments in URFC systems. Furthermore, built on our experimental and intellectual awareness in the context of URFC system developments, new strategies have been suggested to prepare novel structured materials and composites for advanced URFC applications.

This paper will illustrate how this technique has given new information about these complex reactions and their rates, showing a strong dependence on the surface temperature, oxygen precoverage, as well as the alcohol involved. This is due to the beam technique being able to give absolute values of the sticking probability of the reactant, while simultaneously measuring product evolution. All alcohols give common products of the appropriate aldehyde (or ketone) water and hydrogen, however, the reaction shows a change in stoichiometry from 2R1R2CHOH + O(a) --> 2R1R2CO + H2 + H2O at low temperatures to R1R2CHOH + O(a) --> R1R2CO + H2O at higher temperatures, (the exact temperature depending on the alcohol involved). The preadsorbed oxygen strongly enhanced the absolute sticking probability of all the alcohols studied, but also poisons the dehydrogenation reaction at higher coverages. The oxygen coverage variation studies clearly show that the alcohol adsorption involves a precursor state. Isotopic labelling experiments have also been carried out which help to explain clearly many of the effects observed, especially pointing to the importance of the stability of the intermediate alkoxy species.					11TH EUROPEAN CONF ON SURFACE SCIENCE ( ECOSS-11 )11TH EUROPEAN CONF ON SURFACE SCIENCE ( ECOSS-11 )	OCT 01-04, 1990OCT 01-04, 1990	EUROPEAN PHYS SOC, DIV CONDENSED MATTER, INTERFACE SECT; INT UNION VACUUM SCI TECH & APPL, DIV SURFACE SCIEUROPEAN PHYS SOC, DIV CONDENSED MATTER, INTERFACE SECT; INT UNION VACUUM SCI TECH & APPL, DIV SURFACE SCI	UNIV SALAMANCA, SALAMANCA, SPAINUNIV SALAMANCA, SALAMANCA, SPAIN	3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0039-6028			WOS:A1991FY12600218

It was revealed that Ta thin films are oxidized to a crystalline TaO2 layer, which is subsequently oxidized to an amorphous tantalum pentoxide (a-Ta2O5) layer. Initial layered oxidation from Ta to TaO2 phases abruptly induces high compressive stress up to about 3.5 GPa with fast diffusion of oxygen through the Ta layer. Subsequently, it is followed by stress relaxation with the oxidation time, which is related to the slow oxidation from TaO2 to Ta2O5 phases. The initial compressive stress originates from the molar volume expansion during the layered formation of TaO2 from the Ta layer, while the relaxation of the compressive stresses is ascribed to the amorphous character of the a-Ta2O5 layer. According to Kissinger's analysis of the stress evolution during an isochronic heating process, the oxygen diffusion process through the a-Ta2O5 layer is the rate-controlling stage in the layered oxidation process of forming a a-Ta2O5/TaO2/Ta multilayer and has an activation energy of about 190.8 kJ/mol.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000278161900013		
J	Yu, Xingwen; Manthiram, Arumugam								Accessing a high-voltage nonaqueous hybrid flow battery with a sodium-methylphenothiazine chemistry and a sodium-ion solid electrolyte								ENERGY STORAGE				4	1					e281	10.1002/est2.281		SEP 2021		FEB 2022	2022	The development of redox flow batteries (RFBs) with nonaqueous electrolytes offers the possibility of accessing a high cell-operation voltage (no restrain of hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution potentials) and a low operation temperature (can be operated below the freezing point of water). Therefore, nonaqueous RFBs have recently garnered increasing attention. However, the cross-mixing of liquid electrode/electrolyte materials has been plaguing the progress of the nonaqueous RFBs. Herein, we present a crossover-free, high voltage nonaqueous hybrid flow battery (HFB) with a novel sodium-methylphenothiazine (MPT) chemistry and a single-ion solid-electrolyte separator. The Na-MPT redox couple delivers a high voltage of similar to 2.6 V when the cell was operated at a medium current density. A NASICON-type solid electrolyte membrane (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) could circumvent the crossover of the liquids between the positive and negative electrodes, and meanwhile could maintain a single-ion (Na+-ion) conduction between the two electrodes to sustain the electrochemical reactions. Under such an electrochemical mechanism, the nonaqueous Na-MPT HFB shows remarkable cycling performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2578-4862		WOS:000691620400001		
J	Wang, Peicao; Sun, Hongjuan; Peng, Tongjiang								The Evolution Rule of Three-Dimensional Structures of Graphite During Oxidation								NANO				10	1					1550014	10.1142/S1793292015500149				JAN 2015	2015	The graphite oxidation samples with different degrees of oxidation were prepared from natural flake graphite via a modified Hummers method with controlled addition of KMnO4. The evolution of oxygen-containing functional groups was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The evolution rule of three-dimensional (3D) graphite structures during oxidation has been verified via X-ray diffraction (XRD). Experimental results show that the evolution of the interplanar spacing of samples during oxidation can be approximately divided into four stages. When the dosage of KMnO4 is 0.5 g per 1 g of graphite (g/g), a graphite intercalation compound (GIC) is formed through intercalating reactions, and a slight increase is observed in the values of d(100) and d(110), suggesting that the pi-pi interactions which decrease the length of carbon-carbon bonds were partially disrupted. Adding additional KMnO4 initiates the second stage, in which GIC begins to oxidize. The insertion of oxygen-containing functional groups in the graphene basal plane leads to dramatic changes in the values of d(100) and d(110). The d(100) is greatly reduced while d(110) increases slightly. These trends are attributed to the fact that the basal plane is stretched during the oxidation process. Further addition of KMnO4 in the third stage leads to relatively small increases in the values of d(100) and d(110). This result is consistent with the evolution rule of hydroxyl groups. In this research, the evolution rule of the value of d(001) is also clearly demonstrated. When the concentration of KMnO4 is not more than 3.0 g/g, the value of products d(001) keeps gradually increasing, indicating that oxygen-containing groups continue to form bonds with carbons in the basal plane, and that additional water molecules are adsorbed between the layers of the samples. All the interplanar spacing values (d(001), d(100) and d(110)) are reduced significantly in the fourth stage, when the amount of KMnO4 added up to 4.0 g/g. FT-IR and XPS analyses demonstrate that the decrease in the values of d(100) and d(110) is due to a reduction in the content of external hydroxyl groups. The change in d(001) is attributed to the partial release of water molecules confined in the interlayer spaces between adjacent sheets are partly released.									4	3	0	0	1	0	6			1793-2920	1793-7094		WOS:000350763300015

Among the samples studied, boron doped graphene exhibits the lowest discharge and charge overpotentials, suggesting that boron-doped graphene is the best catalyst for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries. Another significant finding is that codoping of nitrogen and boron atoms does not enhance the ORR/OER in the presence of lithium atoms, indicating that the synergistic effect in the presence of protons does not appear in nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries. This behavior is attributed to the fact that the existence of lithium atoms can change the most stable adsorption sites and adsorption energies of intermediates. Finally, on the basis of our calculation results, we propose that the adsorption energy of intermediates in the rate-determining step (RDS) can be the descriptor of the overpotential, and the lower adsorption energy in RDS represents the lower overpotential. The findings reported in this work contribute to the understanding of the ORR/OER in nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries and provide useful insight into the catalyst design.									127	3	0	0	6	0	127			1932-7447			WOS:000373416500036

These metal complexes had been used as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in organic acid and aqueous medium, in which the gallium corrole was firstly used for HER. The results showed that the redox potential of central metal atom for metal-centered metal (eg. Co and Fe) corroles plays a significant role in adjusting catalytic HER activity. Gallium corrole is a ligandcentered HER catalyst, the electronic structure of corrole ligand may play a key role in controlling the electrocatalytic activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1387-7003	1879-0259		WOS:000795711600001

In this study, alpha-MnO2 (manganese oxide) nanowires were used as an active electrocatalyst synthesized by microwave hydrothermal method. Graphene oxide (GO) and alpha-MnO2 nanowires were combined to obtain free standing paper cathodes and alpha-MnO2+ GO free standing paper cathodes were produced with dispersing different amounts of alpha-MnO2 nanowires (10 wt.%, 30 wt.%, 50 wt.%, and 70 wt.%) by using vacuum filtration method. The morphologies and structures of cathodes are evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical tests were carried out at the voltage window between 1.0 and 4.5 V in ECC-Air test cell. alpha-MnO2+ GO composite paper containing 70wt.% alpha-MnO2 catalyst showed the highest specific discharge capacity value of 2900 mAh g(-1). Moreover, the experimental findings showed that dispersing of ce-MnO2 catalyst in GO structure results in remarkable improvement of the electrochemical performance of Li-air battery cathodes.

In this work, transition metal-conjugated casein-derived nanoporous heteroatom-doped carbon electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) in fuel cells are reported. The electrocatalysts are synthesized from casein (or dairy phosphoprotein) that is derived from milk past its shelf life. In the synthesis, casein is mixed with a small amount of non-noble transition metal ions (Cu2+ or Ni2+) and silica, then pyrolyzed and finally treated with basic and acidic solutions to remove the silica and metallic species in it. The metal ions in the precursor are found to be instrumental in the formation of electrocatalytically active sites in the nanoporous carbon materials (as the control material prepared without including metals in the precursor shows a much weaker electrocatalytic activity for both reactions). Interestingly, the carbon materials obtained after removal of the metals exhibit greater electrocatalytic activities for both reactions. Specifically, the one obtained after the removal of Cu from the corresponding carbonized product catalyzes both reactions with lower overpotentials and higher current densities than the other materials studied herein as well as many other notable related materials reported before. These mean, having silica and Cu2+ ions with casein creates more electrocatalytically active sites in the carbon material derived from casein via pyrolysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000626267400002

Herein, sensing and energy applications of fluorographane are reported. The results reveal that the carbon-to-fluoride ratio of fluorographane has a great impact on the electrochemical performance of the materials. Lowered oxidation potentials for ascorbic and uric acids, in addition to a catalytic effect for hydroquinone and dopamine redox processes, are obtained with a high fluoride content. Moreover, fluorographane, together with residual copper- and nickel-based doping, acted as a hybrid electrocatalyst to promote hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions with considerably lower onset potentials than those of graphane (starting material), which makes this a promising material for a broad range of applications.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000365132100025	26442653

Redox reactions which determine the redox state are an essential feature of all living beings on Earth. However, the first life forms evolved under strongly anoxic conditions of the young Earth, and the redox status probably was based on iron and sulphur compounds. Nowadays, redox reactions in cells have developed in strict connection to molecular oxygen and its derivatives i.e. reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxygen has started to accumulate on the Earth due to oxygenic photosynthesis. All aspects of aerobic life involve ROS, reactive nitrogen species (RNS), antioxidants and redox regulation. Many different redox-active compounds are involved in the complex of redox processes, including pyridine nucleotides, thioredoxins, glutaredoxins and other thiol/disulphide-containing proteins. Redox regulation is integrated with the redox-reactions in photosynthesis and respiration to achieve an overall energy balance and to maintain a reduced state necessary for the bio-synthetic pathways that are reductive in nature. It underlies the physiological and developmental flexibility in plant response to environmental signals.									20	4	1	0	18	0	25			0001-527X	1734-154X		WOS:000279416900003	20559571

The hydroxide precipitation method was used for the synthesis. The morphology, structure and specific surface area of the prepared electrocatalysts were determined by means of scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, the Brunauer Emmet Teller method and X-ray photo electron spectroscopy. The electrochemical properties were tested by thin-film technique on a rotating disk electrode and in a single-cell laboratory water electrolyzer coupled with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The OER studies indicate that substitution of Ni by Fe increases the electrocatalytic activity of the resulting material significantly. The highest activity was achieved for x = 0.1. Whereas the current density obtained using a pure nickel anode in the water electrolysis test was 54 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.85 V, in the case of the anode modified with NiCo2O4 catalyst the value was 87 mA cm(-2). Using ternary transition metal oxides in the water electrolysis test and under identical conditions, the catalyst with the highest activity displayed a current density of 115 mA cm(-2).

However, the lack of precisely engineered rich-edge S-vacancy MoS2 constitutes a major obstacle for in-depth studying of structure-activity relationship of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, based on Lewis acid-base theory, we prepared rich-edge S-vacancy MoS2 quantum dots (MoS2 QDs) via top-down strategy using lithium bis (trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide as a stripper and clipper. It is demonstrated for the first time that the rich-edge S-vacancy MoS2 QDs exhibit an extraordinary ORR/OER catalytic performance in Li-O-2 batteries system by a joint experimental and theoretical study. Importantly, the rich-edge S-vacancy MoS2 QDs can run more than 230 cycles at high current density, which was almost 9 times longer than the cycle stability of bulk MoS2. The excellent activity arises primarily due to that the MoS2 QDs facilitate conformal growth of amorphous Li2O2 film on the cathode, originating from the significant differences of adsorption energies between Li+ and O-2, which could significantly enhanced Li2O2 formation/decomposition kinetics. This work provides a novel way for controllable synthesis of rich-edge S-vacancy MoS2 QDs, establishes the underlying mechanisms for the high OER/ORR activity, and suggests high translatability to apply other TMDs.									35	1	0	0	5	0	35			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000496445600048

With the increasing demands of multifunctional electrocatalysts, a universal strategy, which can be beneficial for these catalytic processes, is of great importance. Hence, a series of spinel oxide with Cr3+ doping is designed to enhance the multifunctional reactivities of the catalysts. Attributed to the controllable doping of Cr3+ in the spinel structure with optimized electronic structure and high electronic conductivity, the CoMn2-xCrxO4 (x = 1) shows the superior multifunctional electrocatalytic performances. When utilized in Zn-air batteries, CoMn2xCrxO4 (x = 1) displays a high-power density of 140.26 mW cm(-2) and good cycling stability. Furthermore, a self driven water-splitting device using CoMn2-xCrxO4 (x = 1) as both anode and cathode electrodes is assembled, powered by two in-series CoMn2-xCrxO4 (x = 1)-based Zn-air batteries, thus demonstrating the beneficial role of Cr doping for the trifunctional electrocatalytic reactions.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000593844600003

On graphitic substrates, we find that the insertion of nitrate ion in graphene layers significantly enhances the electrodeposit-support interface, resulting in high mass loading and super hydrophilic/aerophobic properties. For the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction, the nanocrystalline cerium dioxide and amorphous nickel hydroxide co-electrodeposited on graphite exhibits low overpotential (177 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) and sustains long-term durability (over 300 h) at a large current density of 1000 mA cm(-2). In situ Raman and operando X-ray diffraction unravel that the integration of cerium promotes the formation of electrocatalytically active gamma-phase nickel oxyhydroxide with exposed (003) facets. Therefore, combining anion intercalation with cathodic electrodeposition allows building robust electrodes with high electrochemical performance.									230	13	0	0	19	0	233			2041-1723			WOS:000435453200001	29915288

Recently, the instability of carbon cathode support has been recognized to contribute significantly to the problems faced by Li-O-2 batteries. One strategy to address the challenge is to replace carbon materials with carbon-free ones. Here, we present titanium silicide nanonets (TiSi2) as such a new material platform for this purpose. Because TiSi2 exhibits no oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities, catalysts are required to promote discharge and recharge reactions at reduced overpotentials. Pd nanoparticles grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) were observed to provide the bifunctionalities of ORR and OER. Their adhesion to TiSi2 nanonets, however, was found to be poor, leading to drastic performance decay due to Pd detachments and aggregation. The problem was solved by adding another layer of Co3O4, also prepared by ALD. Together, the Pd/Co3O4/TiSi2 combination affords the desired functionalities and stability. Li-O-2 test cells that lasted more than 126 cycles were achieved. The reversible formation and decomposition of Li2O2 was verified by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ferrocenium back-titration, and gas-chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Our results provide a new material platform for detailed studies of Li-O-2 operations for better understanding of the chemistries involved, which is expected to help pave the way toward practical Li-O-2 battery realizations.									28	2	0	0	0	0	28			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000362628900042	26308102

This review compares and unifies viewpoints on water oxidation from various fields of catalysis research. The first part deals with the thermodynamic efficiency and mechanisms of electrochemical water splitting by metal oxides on electrode surfaces, explaining the recent concept of the potential-determining step. Subsequently, novel cobalt oxide-based catalysts for heterogeneous (electro)catalysis are discussed. These may share structural and functional properties with surface oxides, multinuclear molecular catalysts and the catalytic manganese-calcium complex of photosynthetic water oxidation. Recent developments in homogeneous water-oxidation catalysis are outlined with a focus on the discovery of mononuclear ruthenium (and non-ruthenium) complexes that efficiently mediate O-2 evolution from water. Water oxidation in photosynthesis is the subject of a concise presentation of structure and function of the natural paragon-the manganese-calcium complex in photosystem II-for which ideas concerning redox-potential leveling, proton removal, and O-O bond formation mechanisms are discussed. The last part highlights common themes and unifying concepts.									1272	32	0	0	131	0	1281			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000280430100003

Both have been applied during superficial ALA-PDT of normal skin and skin cancers. The interpretation of fluorescence and SOLD data is complicated by the non-uniform distribution and bleaching of PpIX and the absorption and scattering of light in the skin. The aim of the present work was to tackle these challenges using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Skin was modeled as a three-layer semi-infinite medium with uniform optical properties in each layer. The initial depth-dependent distribution of PpIX was an exponential decay and, after the delivery of each treatment fluence increment, standard photochemical reaction kinetics were used to update the distribution of sensitizer and reacted singlet oxygen. Oxygen depletion due to photochemical consumption or vascular shutdown was also incorporated in the model. The adjoint method was applied to calculate the PpIX fluorescence and 1270 nm singlet oxygen luminescence reaching the skin surface in each time increment. The time-resolved evolution of the fluorescence and cumulative SOLD signals during treatment were compared to the time-resolved volume-averaged distribution of reacted singlet oxygen in the dermis layer for typical clinical PDT conditions. Approximate linear relationships were observed over most of the treatment time.					12th World Congress of the International-Photodynamic-Association (IPA) on Photodynamic Therapy - Back to the Future12th World Congress of the International-Photodynamic-Association (IPA) on Photodynamic Therapy - Back to the Future	JUN 11-15, 2009JUN 11-15, 2009	Int Photodynam Assoc (IPA); SPIE; AF Off Sci Res; Axcan Pharma Inc; Covidien Imaging Solut; Ondine Biopharma Corp; Photocure ASA; QinetiQ N Amer; Wellman Ctr PhotoMed; Wayne State UnivInt Photodynam Assoc (IPA); SPIE; AF Off Sci Res; Axcan Pharma Inc; Covidien Imaging Solut; Ondine Biopharma Corp; Photocure ASA; QinetiQ N Amer; Wellman Ctr PhotoMed; Wayne State Univ	Seattle, WASeattle, WA	2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0277-786X	1996-756X	978-0-8194-7660-9	WOS:000313709100118

So, the state-of-the-art catalysts performing well in acidic media lose considerable catalytic performance in alkaline media. This review summarizes the recent developments to overcome the kinetics issues of alkaline HER, synthesis of materials with modified morphologies, and electronic structures to tune the active sites and their applications as efficient catalysts for HER. It first explains the fundamentals and electrochemistry of HER and then outlines the requirements for an efficient and stable catalyst in alkaline medium. The challenges with alkaline HER and limitation with the electrocatalysts along with prospective solutions are then highlighted. It further describes the synthesis methods of advanced nanostructures based on carbon, noble, and inexpensive metals and their heterogeneous structures. These heterogeneous structures provide some ideal systems for analyzing the role of structure and synergy on alkaline HER catalysis. At the end, it provides the concluding remarks and future perspectives that can be helpful for tuning the catalysts active-sites with improved electrochemical efficiencies in future.									696	27	3	0	32	0	703				2198-3844		WOS:000426200000005	29610722

In this paper, we adopted the facile cocrystallization technique to synthesize the ZIF-8/ZIF-67 and used it as support to prepare Ni/ZIF-8/ZIF-67. After being annealed at 800 degrees C, Ni/ZIF-8/ZIF-67 was successfully transformed into Ni/Zn/Co/NC electrocatalyst (NC is the abbreviation of nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon). The structures and properties of all as-synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscope (TEM). The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity was evaluated in a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell in alkaline solution (1M KOH solution). The results show that the doping of Ni and Zn has great influence on the OER activity of Co/NC electrocatalyst. Compared with Co/NC (1.63V) and Zn/Co/NC (1.58V), Ni/Zn/Co/NC exhibits the highest OER activity (1.53V). Except that, Ni/Zn/Co/NC has high stability. After 10h of continuous operation at a static potential of 1.52V for 10h, it just shows 4.0% of decay.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1380-2224	1573-4854		WOS:000463148400008

In this article, ACo(2)O(4)/NF (A = Mn, Zn, Ni) composites were synthesized via a facilely hydrothermal and calcination method and used as electrocatalytic water oxidation catalysts. The hybrid structure, chemical composition, oxidation state and surface morphology of ACo(2)O(4)/NF (A = Mn, Zn, Ni) has been confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray photoelectron (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Brunaure-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. Such self-supported NiCo2O4/NF hybrid shows a smaller overpotential of 271 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, which is comparable to most reported NiCo2O4 materials (monomer or composite) for OER. Influence on catalytic activity of doping different metal ions in ACo(2)O(4)/NF was investigated systematically for the first time. Improved electrocatalytic activity of NiCo2O4/NF is attributed to the special homogeneous urchin-like structure and porous property. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

J	Shi, Xueqiang; Zhang, Yutao; Chen, Xiaokun; Zhang, Yuanbo				Shi, Xueqiang/GPT-3547-2022				Effects of thermal boundary conditions on spontaneous combustion of coal under temperature-programmed conditions								FUEL				295						120591	10.1016/j.fuel.2021.120591		MAR 2021		JUL 1 2021	2021	Coal spontaneous combustion (CSC) is one of major disasters that threaten the safety and production of coal mines. A method to calculate the key parameters of coal oxidation reaction based on temperature-programmed tests was proposed. Moreover, a one-step global numerical model for exploring coal oxidation considering the effects of multi-component material was established. The evolution of the oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) in multiple stages of coal oxidation was investigated and the changes in temperature and reaction rate were assessed by changing thermal boundary conditions including gas temperature supplied and wall temperature. The results show that the coal oxidation can be simulated based on the obtained parameters; the process of coal oxidation can be partitioned into three stages (i.e. temperature-dominated, co-dominated by temperature and oxygen, and oxygen-dominated) as the reaction continues. Under thermal conditions involving high-temperature gas, the coal always exhibits a high temperature at the gas inlet and the dimensionless number ? of the coal selfheating temperature presents three trends including slight variation, a gradual increase, and gradual reduction. Under conditions involving the high-temperature wall of coal-storage tanks in contact with coal (briefly called the contact wall hereinafter), the dimensionless number ? of the coal self-heating temperature increases exponentially.									53	0	0	0	0	0	53			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000638032900003

In a previous study [T. Nguyen et al., Results Mater., 2020, 6, 100088, DOI: 10.1016/j.rinma.2020.100088], by means of structural, electrical, and optical characterizations, we identified key growth parameters of this unusual ALD process. Unexpectedly, the influence of molecular oxygen on the crystallography, microstructure, and morphology of the hundred-nanometer- to micrometer-thick ZnO films was significant. In this study, we present an unprecedented methodology by combining isotopic tracers with mass spectrometry to elucidate the role of the two different sources of oxygen atoms during the evolution of the growth. Notably, the use of in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) reveals new insights into the reaction mechanism for ZnO thin film growth. On the one hand, the non-negative mass change during the ZnO growth without O-2 gas is attributed to the presence of bare zinc atoms on the surface due to the reaction between monoethyl zinc and hydroxyl groups of the water precursor after the diethyl zinc pulse. On the other hand, the detection of ZnxOyC2H5- ions by Time-of-Flight SIMS (TOF-SIMS) and the mass increase during the O-2 pulse suggest a new reaction mechanism for the ZnO thin film growth in the presence of gaseous O-2 where the ethyl ligand of the zinc precursor can react with O-2 to form ethylperoxy radicals. The formations of the ethylperoxy zinc and/or zinc atoms lead to more adsorption of water to form ethylhydroperoxide during the water pulse, inducing the positive mass change. The use of an isotopic substitution allowed us to unambiguously associate the mass gain with the gradual incorporation of gaseous oxygen throughout the growth process and thereby support the chemical reaction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000635768900025

It was demonstrated to be a trifunctional catalyst that can efficiently catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It was found that the introduction of oleylamine during the preparation can adjust the catalytic sites and finally lead to ideal catalytic performances. The obtained catalyst exhibited efficient ORR catalytic performance that surpassed the commercial Pt/C catalyst, with the OER performance comparable to that of RuO2 as well as excellent HER performance. The ORR half-wave potential is 0.879 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH solution, while the OER overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is only 280 mV in 1 M KOH solution. The potential gap between the ORR and OER was only 0.700 V in 0.1 M KOH solution. This trifunctional catalyst was further evaluated in energy devices including zinc-air batteries and water electrolysis. The liquid zinc-air battery assembly achieved a power density of 169 mW cm(-2) and stably undergoes charge-discharge cycles for 210 hours. The solid-state zinc-air battery achieved a power density of 70 mW cm(-2) and stably undergoes charge-discharge cycles for 40 hours. These performances surpassed the batteries assembled with a Pt/C-RuO2 mixed catalyst. This work established a foundation of composite catalysts coupled with bimetallic phosphide and hybrid carbon substrates, which will promote the development of high-performance multifunctional catalysts and their application in energy devices.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000706160600001	34635897

Each process involves a ''spin-forbidden'' transition between states of an oxygen-organic molecule (M) encounter pair. Under certain conditions, the 1DELTAgO2 and 3chrysene deactivation rates decreased with an increase in the magnetic field strength. The data are consistent with a model in which the M-O2 charge-transfer state (M.+O2.-) imparts geminate radical ion character into lower lying states of the M-O2 encounter pair through configuration interaction. Magnetic field effects appear to derive from changes in the rate of singlet-triplet spin evolution in M-O2 states with radical ion pair character and are most pronounced (1) in solvents where the charge-transfer state is more stable, (2) when M and O2 are held in close proximity for a longer period of time, and (3) when the rate of singlet-triplet spin evolution is much slower than dissociation of the excited-state M-O2 encounter pair to regenerate solvated reactants. Furthermore, the observation of a solvent hydrogen/deuterium magnetic isotope effect on the 1DELTAgO2 lifetime is consistent with a mechanism in which hyperfine interactions influence the rate of electron spin evolution. Where magnetic field effects were observed, the data indicate that singlet-state-triplet-state mixing becomes less probable at higher field strengths.									28	0	0	0	1	0	28			0022-3654			WOS:A1993LA76600022

A nitrogen-containing carbon sphere (NCS) catalyst was synthesized using a soft template and was studied for the oxygen reduction reaction. The NCS catalyst was shown to have superior activity with an onset potential of 0.985 V (vs. RHE) and a diffusion-limited current density of 6.16 mA cm(-2). The kinetic insight from the rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) revealed an overall 4e(-) reduction by a (2 + 2) electron pathway with a rate constant of 4.6-10(-4) cm s(-1) at the onset potential. A fast screening of the localized electrochemical activity using sample generation-tip collection (SG-TC) in combination with a chronoamperometric multiple pulse technique was applied in the present study to trace the formation, evolution and conversion of intermediate species using a Pt ultramicroelectrode. The local catalytic activity of the NCS catalyst was successfully visualized by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) in highly alkaline medium.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000411739700052

The system was earlier used as the gate insulator in a photo-switchable organic field effect transistor (OFET), and the switching was attributed to the photochromic reaction taking place in the polymer matrix. The present measurements aimed at elucidating the mechanism of the switching by comparing the rate constants of the coloring and bleaching reactions with the rate constants of processes responsible for capacitance changes. The comparison of the rate constants seems to confirm the role of the photochromic process: to within experimental uncertainty the rate constants determined from the two methods are similar. Measurements of the temporal evolution of absorbance additionally reveal existence of an irreversible fatigue reaction, probably associated with admission of oxygen to some samples. The presence of oxygen is also responsible for a deterioration of performance of the OFETs under study. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Intramolecular redox reaction of caged ATP								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				10	45			6820	6828		10.1039/b806677a				2008	2008	The light-driven intramolecular redox reaction of adenosine-5'-triphosphate-[P-3-(1-(2-nitrophenyl)-ethyl)] ester (caged ATP) has been studied in frozen aqueous solution using time-resolved solid state NMR spectroscopy under continuous illumination conditions. Cleavage of the phosphate ester bond leads to 0.3, 1.36, and 6.06 ppm down field shifts of the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-phosphorus resonances of caged ATP, respectively. The observed rate of ATP formation is 2.4 +/- 0.2 h(-1) at 245 K. The proton released in the reaction binds to the triphosphate moiety of the nascent ATP, causing the up field shifts of the 31 P resonances. Analyses of the reaction kinetics indicate that bond cleavage and proton release are two sequential processes in the solid state, suggesting that the 1-hydroxy, 1-(2-nitrosophenyl)-ethyl carbocation intermediate is involved in the reaction. The b- phosphate oxygen atom of ATP is protonated first, indicating its proximity to the reaction center, possibly within hydrogen bonding distance. The residual linewidth kinetics are interpreted in terms of chemical exchange processes, hydrogen bonding of the beta-phosphate oxygen atom and evolution of the hydrolytic equilibrium at the triphosphate moiety of the nascent ATP. Photoreaction of caged ATP in situ gives an opportunity to study structural kinetics and catalysis of ATP-dependent enzymes by NMR spectroscopy in rotating solids.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000261005000010	19015786

The influencing factors on electrochemical decomposition of pollutants were evaluated and the removal of MNZ and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reached 78.09% and 21.77% after 120 min treatment under the optimal conditions with the concentration of supporting electrolyte, the initial concentration of MNZ, the pH and the current density were 0.10 mol/L, 100 mg/L, 6.4 and 10 mA/cm(2), respectively. Then, the Co doped PbO2 electrodes were prepared and used to degrade MNZ under the optimal conditions. Relatively good performance was achieved when the molar ratio of Pb and Co was 100:1. Compared to pure PbO2 electrode, the steady-state polarization curves and cyclic voltammetry analysis showed that 1.0% Co-PbO2 electrode had a higher oxygen evolution potential and greater current of reduction and oxidation peaks, which increased the electrochemical activity and decreased the energy consumption. Finally, based on the intermediate products identified by IC and GC/MS, the main degradation pathway of MNZ was proposed including ring open, denitrification and radical reactions.

To date, the highest activity MnOx catalyst reported for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) does however not belong to common MnO2 polymorphs (alpha-, beta-, delta-MnO2), but rather to nascent delta-MnO2 layer produced in situ from spinel under electrochemical conditions with unknown active site structure. Here with the stochastic surface walking (SSW) pathway sampling method, we for the first time resolve the atomic-level mechanism of spinel-to-layer Mn3O4 solid phase transition in aqueous electrolyte. We show that a transient H0.5MnO2 phase is the precursor of transition that forms at high voltage (>1 V), and it undergoes the solid-to-solid phase transition to produce a delta-MnO2 layer, which is accompanied by Mn dissolution, dislocation, layer-breaking, and insertion of water/cations between layers. This leads to the generation of a variety of possible defective structures. We demonstrate using first-principles calculations that a special edge site with neighboring Mn vacancy provides the best OER activity with an overpotential of 0.59 V, 0.19 V lower than that of pristine MnO2. The high activity of such Mn sites are attributed to its special local structure: pseudocubane with one corner missing. The presence of the Mn vacancy near the active site enhances the adsorption of OH intermediate in OER. This defective cubane structure shares the common geometrical and electronic features found in the PSII system.									60	3	0	0	5	0	62			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000424851500032	29333857

In this study, we report novel Fe2.55Sb2 alloy nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 30-40 nm incorporated in a N-doped carbon matrix (FeSb/NC) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). When employed to catalyze the ORR, FeSb/NC delivers the highest onset potential of 0.91 V vs. RHE and a half-wave potential of 0.83 V vs. RHE. When used to catalyze the OER, FeSb/NC shows an overpotential of 380 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Most importantly, it could be utilized in an aqueous rechargeable Zn-air battery as the air electrode, and the battery shows a high power density of 175 mW cm(-2), specific capacity of 751 mA h g(-1), as well as excellent rechargeability and cycling stability (nearly 900 h at 5 mA cm(-2) and over 400 h at 10 mA cm(-2)).

By using atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), a new class of [FeFe]-metallopolymers with precise molar mass, defined composition, and low polydispersity, has been prepared. The synthetic methodology introduced here allows facile variation of polymer composition to optimize the [FeFe] solubility, activity, and long-term chemical and aerobic stability. Water soluble functional metallopolymers facilitate electrocatalytic hydrogen production in neutral water with loadings as low as 2 ppm and operate at rates an order of magnitude faster than hydrogenases (2.5 x 10(5) s(-1)), and with low overpotential requirement. Furthermore, unlike the hydrogenases, these systems are insensitive to oxygen during catalysis, with turnover numbers on the order of 40000 under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions.									32	1	0	0	2	0	32			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000443675700006	30053346

Developing high-performing bifunctional catalyst to improve the ORR and OER kinetic is the key issue of the researchable zinc-air battery. In this work, ultra-thin NiCo2S4 nanosheets with reduced graphene oxide hybrid materials (NiCo2S4/RGO) have been successfully developed. The hybrid catalyst shows a unique hierarchical structure with large surface area, which provides the quick transport pathways and abundant active sites for both ORR and OER. Notably, the conversion of oxides to sulfides changes the electrons state of the metal oxides and create more oxygen defective compared with pure NiCo2O4, effectively improving the ORR/OER' activity. The strong synergistic effect between NiCo2S4 and RGO further facilitating the intrinsic oxygen reaction process. As expected, the NiCo2S4/RGO bifunctional catalysts demonstrate enhanced ORR/OER activity (Delta E: 0.91 V) and stability, along with the high battery performance (262.6 mW cm(-2) and 750 chare-discharge cycles).

Generally speaking, catalytic reactions take place on a metal oxide layer. In this study, therefore, the oxidation states of the Ni(111) surface, which were made by irradiation with a supersonic O-2 molecular beam, were analyzed by soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy with synchrotron radiation. The oxygen uptake curve and initial sticking rate were found to show remarkably strong dependence on the O-2 incident energy for energies of up to 2.3 eV. The intermediate plateau seen in the oxygen uptake curve for low incident energies was found to disappear with increasing incident energy due to a change of the dissociative adsorption mechanism from a two-dimensional island growth model to a direct activated adsorption model. Due to this activated adsorption, the formation rate of NiO and peroxide nickel increased as compared to backfilling oxidation by O-2 gas.					15th International Conference on Thin Films (ICTF)15th International Conference on Thin Films (ICTF)	NOV 08-11, 2011NOV 08-11, 2011	Int Union Vacuum Sci Tech & Applicat, Thin Film Div (IUVSTA); Vacuum Soc Japan (VSJ)Int Union Vacuum Sci Tech & Applicat, Thin Film Div (IUVSTA); Vacuum Soc Japan (VSJ)	Kyoto, JAPANKyoto, JAPAN	3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1742-6588	1742-6596	*****************	WOS:000317122000034

The co-electrodeposited Co3O4-dpa-C nanosheets on a glassy carbon electrode exhibited a low overpotential of 54 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for the HER, much lower than that of pure Co3O4 (324 mV at 10 mA cm-2). These results indicate that the molecular Co complex anchored on the surface of Co3O4 acts as the catalytic center and cooperatively promotes the hydrogen evolution reaction at the interface of the Co3O4 support under alkaline conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			INSPEC:20097912

To develop an efficient CER electrode, not only the active components but also the morphology of the electrode should be considered. In this work, the ordered spherical Ru-RuO2 electrode was prepared by hydrothermal reaction for improving the CER activity. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterizations were employed to analyze the electrode structures. Compared with RuO2 electrode prepared by Adams method, the CER activity of Ru-RuO2 electrode is obviously improved. The improvement of activity should be attributed to the change of electronic structure and the ordered structure of electrode surface. The prepared Ru-RuO2 particles are spherical and evenly distributed, thus showing an orderly morphology. Such an unified structure can be conducive to the diffusion of Cl-2. The diffraction peak of (101) crystal plane of Ru-RuO2 electrode has slightly positive shifted of 0.4 degrees. It indicates that the lattice of RuO2 on the outside surface of Ru-RuO2 has been compressed to a certain extent, which may reduce the adsorption energy of Cl and accelerate the rate of chlorine desorption process.									1	1	0	0	1	0	2			1452-3981			WOS:000495904600015

Furthermore, Cr incorporated NiFe-LDH (NiFeCr-LDH) oxygen evolution reaction (OER) co-catalyst was electrodeposited onto WO-60s/BVO. The sputtered WO3 underlayer in the WO-60s/BVO facilitated enhanced electron-hole separation and less transient time for the electron to arrive at back contact than conventional spin-coated WO3 layers. Incorporating Cr into NiFe-LDH increased the electrical conductivity of LDH, which resulted in an enhanced transfer of photogenerated charge-carrier and significant promotion of the OER kinetics. The heterojunction with sputtered WO3 underlayer and NiFeCr-LDH co-catalyst attained photocurrent density of 4.9 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE with an IPCE value greater than 56% in the 350-470 nm wavelength range. Moreover, the WO-60s/BVO-NiFeCr photoanode showed only 7% decay in photocurrent after 6 h with H-2, and O-2 evolution of 98 and 47 mmol cm(-2) h, respectively, suggesting high stability for OER.

Herein, we demonstrate the self-assembly of a new nanoforest electrocatalyst by ultrathin Ni(OH)(2)/Ni3S2 heterogeneous nanosheets (similar to 1.8 nm) using a high-temperature and large-potential electrodeposition technique. The surface atomic configuration of Ni3S2 is well-modulated by hetero-interface engineering with the Ni(OH)(2) cocatalyst, effectively accelerating the Volmer step and OH- adsorption during the HER without sacrificing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The resultant electrocatalysts exhibit superior and stable electrocatalytic activity toward the HER and OER in 1 M KOH with small overpotentials of 50 mV and 210 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Using the Ni(OH)(2)/Ni3S2 nanoforest as dual-functional electrocatalysts, an alkaline electrolyzer can render 100 mA cm(-2) at a very low cell voltage of 1.64 V while keep stable for 120 hat 1.55 V, which outperforms the best report for Ni-based electrocatalysts. This finding gives a new insight into the modulating surface atomic configuration for achieving highly active electrocatalysts for water splitting.									248	10	0	0	8	0	250			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000450135000007		
J	Rahaman, Hasimur; Barman, Koushik; Jasimuddin, Sk.; Ghosh, Sujit Kumar								Hybrid Mn3O4-NiO nanocomposites as efficient photoelectrocatalysts towards water splitting under neutral pH conditions								RSC ADVANCES				6	114			113694	113702		10.1039/c6ra22499g				2016	2016	Mimicking photosynthesis, water splitting has been adopted as the key step for solar energy conversion. As this route is thermodynamically unfavourable (H = 572 KJ mol(-1)) and is interesting from a kinetic point of view, the development of cheap and efficient catalysts is a subject of fundamental importance to overcome the clean energy demands of the modern world. In this work, dual oxide nanocomposites consisting of manganese oxide (Mn3O4) and nickel oxide (NiO) have been synthesised for electrochemical water oxidation reaction in the presence of sunlight and ultraviolet light under neutral pH conditions. Kinetic parameters of the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction have been extracted from Tafel plots and faradic efficiency calculations. Our results show that these nanocomposites could catalyse water oxidation in neutral phosphate buffer saline (pH similar to 7.0) with a current density of 2.2 mA cm(-2) and turnover frequency of 4.3 s(-1) and in the presence of UV light with 4.5 mA cm(-2) and 5.1 s(-1) at an applied overpotential of just 280 mV. The significant aspects of this approach include the use of earth-abundant nickel and manganese precursors, facile preparation of the electrocatalysts, the low overpotential and the extremely high turnover frequency for O-2 evolution in neutral aqueous media.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2046-2069		WOS:000389905300110

The iridium catalyst was found to dramatically improve the kinetics of the water oxidation reaction at both stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric aFe203, surfaces. This was found to be the case in both the dark and in the light as evidenced by cyclic voltammetry, Tafel analysis, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Oxygen evolution measurements under working conditions confirmed high Faradaic efficiencies of 69-100% and good stability over 22 h of operation for the functionalized electrodes. The resulting alpha-200-300 mV shift in onset potential for the iridiumfunctionalized sample was attributed to improved interfacial charge transfer and oxygen evolution kinetics. Mott Schottky plots revealed that there was no shift in flat-band potential or change in donor density following functionalization with the catalyst. The effect of the catalyst on thermodynamics and Fermi level pinning was also found to be negligible, as evidenced by open circuit potential measurements. Finally, transient photocurrent measurements revealed that the tethered molecular catalyst did improve charge separation and increase charge density at the surface of the photoanodes, but only at high applied biases and only for the nonstoichiometric oxygen-deficient iron oxide films. These results demonstrate how molecular catalysts can be integrated with semiconductors to yield cooperative effects for photoelectrochemical water oxidation.									27	0	0	0	3	0	27			1932-7447			WOS:000378663800009		
J	Zhang, X.; Xu, J.; Wu, L.								Hexamethylenetetramine-derived pyridinic N abundant porous carbon-supported Co/Co-Nx nanoparticles as highly efficient oxygen reduction catalyst and zinc-air battery cathode								MATERIALS TODAY SUSTAINABILITY				19						100180	10.1016/j.mtsust.2022.100180				NOV 2022	2022	Fuel cells and metal-air batteries attracted extensive research attention owing to high power density, renewability, and environmental friendliness. Hence, developing heteroatom-doped pyridinic N abun-dant porous carbon materials with large surface area have an extensive effect on oxygen reduction re-action (ORR) for fuel cell and metal-air battery. Herein, high content of pyridinic N porous carbon -supported Co/Co-Nx nanoparticles were synthesized as ORR catalysts by carbonizing complexes of hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) and Co(NO3)2$6H2O with silica template. The HMT-Co@SiO2-90 0 with high content of pyridinic N, large specific surface area, and porous structure exhibits a more positive half -wave potential (0.85 V) than 20% Pt/C and the outstanding performance oxygen evolution reaction behavior. The low Tafel slope of HMT-Co@SiO2-90 0 revealed the faster reaction kinetics during ORR. The HMT-Co@SiO2-90 0 zinc-air battery showed a high excellent cyclic stability in continuous charge/discharge cycles for 420 times at 10 mA/cm2. This research provides an efficient strategy for the preparation of pyridinic N porous electrocatalyst by the reduction of diffusion restriction and exposure of active sites.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2589-2347			WOS:000853275000003		
J	Mahmood, Asad; Lu, Guanhong; Wang, Xiao; Wang, Yan; Xie, Xiaofeng; Sun, Jing								Investigating the stability and role of defects in vertically aligned WS2/ MoS2 heterojunctions on OER activity using first principles study								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				551						232208	10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.232208				DEC 15 2022	2022	Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) based van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures are of technological importance in optical and electrical devices. In this report, using first principles calculation, we find that induced defects in vdW WS2/MoS2 heterostructures can be used to alter the electronic structure and photocatalytic properties. For instance, the band gap of WS2/MoS2 heterostructure significantly changes when S or Mo/W defects are incorporated in the form of vacancy or adatoms. Also, the existence of vacancy improves the interaction between the WS2 and MoS2 layers, which facilitates charge transfer and optical properties. Moreover, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) study suggests that the existence of defects in WS2/MoS2 heterostructures improves the overall OER process. Although S defects are thermodynamically more stable, the OER activity is boosted by incorporating the Mo defect. For example, a significant decrease in the overpotential (n = 1.48 V) is observed when one Mo vacancy is incorporated in WS2/MoS2 than that of clean WS2/MoS2 configuration (n = 2.15 V). This study explores in detail the role of various defects in the 2D WS2/MoS2 vdW heterostructures, which can be used to achieve new properties for various optical and electrical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000870015700002

Because these whiskers were formed by the vapour/solid mechanism, the controlling gas phase was of primary importance to obtain whiskers of tailored morphology and chemistry. To elucidate the effect of the gas phase composition on the reaction mechanisms of SiC and Si3N4, the oxygen partial pressure was measured during the synthesis with a ZrO2 solid electrolyte. The carbothermal reduction of SiO2, as well as evolution of gases, were accelerated by a formation of a molten fluorosilicate with an auxiliary halide bath. The oxygen partial pressure steadily increased with increasing temperature and reached a maximum level of 10(-11)-10(-12) atm in the early stage of reaction at 1623 K, then decreased again towards the end of reaction in both cases. Effects of the gas phase on the SiC and Si3N4 formations were not the same: p(CO) and p(CO2) and their ratio were important factors in the SiC formation, while the higher p(OO2) formed an oxynitride phase in the Si3N4 formation.									15	2	0	0	0	0	16			0022-2461			WOS:A1992HK02400018

MOC/25BC carbon paper (MOC consisting of alpha-MnO2 and XC-72 carbon black) and Fe0.1Ni0.9Co2O4/Ti mesh on this air electrode mainly serve as the cathode for the ORR and the anode for the OER, respectively. The morphology and physicochemical properties of Fe0.1Ni0.9Co2O4 are investigated through scanning electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction. Electrochemical studies comprise linear sweep voltammetry, rotating ring-disk electrode voltammetry, and the full-cell charge-discharge-cycling test. The discharge peak power density of the Zn-air battery with the unique air electrode reaches 88.8 mW cm(-2) at 133.6 mA cm(-2) and 0.66 V in an alkaline electrolyte under an ambient atmosphere. After 100 charge-discharge cycles at 10 mA cm(-2), an increase of 0.3 V between charge and discharge cell voltages is observed. The deep charge-discharge curve (10 h in each step) indicates that the cell voltages of discharge (1.3 V) and charge (1.97 V) remain constant throughout the process. The performance of the proposed rechargeable Zn-air battery is superior to that of most other similar batteries reported in recent studies. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we detail the synthesis, processing and performance of a cobalt oxide-based OER electrocatalyst with optimized composition, atomic arrangement and nano/microstructure. We demonstrate that doping the cobalt oxide with a higher electronegativity element such as molybdenum promotes the participation of lattice oxygen in the OER. Besides, the processing of the catalyst at moderate temperatures results in an amorphous material with extended compositional and atomic arrangement versatility. Additionally, the catalyst, which is produced through an ion etching assisted strategy using ZIF-67 as a template, displays a highly porous structure in the form of amorphous ultrathin MoCoxOy nanosheets that maximize interaction with the media and facilitate the transport of ions through the electrolyte. After optimizing the molybdenum concentration and structural parameters, the best MoCoxOy catalysts exhibited a low overpotential of 282 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a reduced Tafel slope of 60.6 mV dec(-1), and excellent stability with more than 60 h operation without significant activity decay.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000745106600001

But it cannot be sealed and maintenance-free due to the hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, we synthesized W2C nanocrystals embedded in porous graphene as catalysts for the hydrogen and oxygen recombination in the nickel-iron battery through in situ carburization of metallic W anchored on the graphene. The W2C/porous graphene nanocomposite catalyst exhibited a high performance with an average catalytic velocity of 3859 mu molh(-1)g(cat)(-1) and long catalytic life of 598,260s without decay in the catalytic performance. With the non-noble metal catalyst of W2C/porous graphene nanocomposite, a nickel-iron battery could be sealed and maintenance-free, and it also exhibited low cost; thus, the nickel-iron battery can be used for large-scale energy storage systems in rural/remote areas.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000476796200023

However, bubbles coalescence near the electrode blocks the following electrochemical reaction, seriously worsening the cycling performance of rechargeable zinc-air battery. Here we present control of oxygen bubbles movement with electromagnetic coupling, where a permanent magnet is placed near the electrode, and the strength of magnetic field at the electrode surface can be changed by means of spacing adjustment between the electrode and the magnet. The bubbles from oxygen evolution reaction can be quickly detached from the electrode surface under the condition of the electromagnetic field, achieving directional movement of oxygen bubbles. The results show that the electromagnetic field can inhibit bubbles coalescence, reducing phase transformation impedance and improving the performance of rechargeable zinc-air battery. The proposed solutions will be available for improving the morphology of metal electrodeposition as well as rechargeable metalair batteries.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000444001900020

Here, we demonstrate a NdBa0.5Ca0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta@Gd0.1Ce0.9O2-delta (NBCCF@GDC) composite oxygen electrode via a one-pot method for exhibiting strong coherency, which result in boosting the electrochemical performance of RSOCs. The NBCCF@GDC electrode yields a very low polarization resistance (0.106 Omega-cm(2) at 800 degrees C), high electrolysis current density (1.45 A cm(-2) with 70 vol % absolute humidity at 1.3 V), and high power density (similar to 1.3 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C) and shows excellent reversibility and stability. Notably, strong coherency in these NBCCF@GDC composite materials was successfully revealed by HT-XRD, XPS, STEM, and EELS. The phase contiguity and interfacial coherence between NBCCF and GDC increase the Co oxidation state and the number of active sites, which enhanced the electrocatalytic activity for perovskites. Overall, this work demonstrates a highly desirable strategy for the production of functionalized electrodes for next-generation reversible solid oxide cells.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000631434600045

Herein, three-dimensional Ni3S2@graphene@Co9S8 (Ni3S2@G@Co9S8), a sandwich-structured OER electrocatalyst, was grown in situ on nickel foam; it afforded an enhanced catalytic performance when highly conductive graphene is introduced as an intermediary for enhancing the electron transfer rate and stability.

The electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) results indicated that only a thin but unbroken reaction layer was formed on the surface of Ti3AlC2 ceramics at 1100 degrees C. It was further confirmed as aluminum oxide, while aluminum oxide fine grains were distributed separately over the surface layer along a dozen microns scale. At 1300 degrees C, a continuous and dense reaction layer which was mainly composed of aluminum oxide and titanium carbide was detected. After heat-treated at 1500 degrees C, an obvious difference in metallic luster contrast between the interior and exterior layer of cross-sections of the sample was observed. The Kirkendall effect was proposed to elucidate the above results. Titanium carbide, instead of TiO2, became the main product phase in the reaction product layer. It was attributed to the weak oxidative condition in a graphite bed and low oxygen partial pressure, which was not considered in the previous study. Besides, thermodynamic calculations result was provided to elaborate on the reaction mechanism in detail.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000863112600003

The addition of carbon black resulted in a decrease in the density and grain size of NiO/YSZ composites. The porosity of NiO/YSZ composites increased with decreasing the sintering temperature and increasing the NiO content. Additionally, highly porous Ni/YSZ cermets were fabricated by reducing the NiO/YSZ composites in (Al + 6% H-2), which was attributed to the change of NiO to Ni and then the extraction of oxygen. The carbon black used as a pore-former was highly effective for preparing porous Ni/YSZ cermets. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

However, exploring a sustainable and stable single-atom metal catalyst still faces a great challenge due to low yield and complicated synthesis. Here, we report a functional multi-wall carbon nanotubes modified with iron phthalocyanine molecules via a liquid chemical reaction and realize the performance of similar single-atom catalysis for oxygen reduction reaction. A serial of characterizations strongly imply the structure change of iron phthalocyanine molecule and its close recombination with multi-wall carbon nanotubes, which are in favor of ORR catalysis. Compared to commercial platinum-carbon catalyst, composites exhibit superior activity for oxygen reduction reaction with higher half-wave potential (0.86 V), lower Tafel slope (38 mV dec(-1)), higher limiting current density and excellent electrochemical stability. The corresponding Zinc-air battery also presents higher maximum power density and discharge stability. Therefore, these findings provide a facile route to synthesize a highly efficient non-precious metal carbon-based catalyst.									46	0	0	0	4	0	45			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000433267100029

In this study, its connection with the catalytic performance was investigated via in-situ Raman spectroscopy on nanostructured pure and Cu/Mn-doped ceria, monitoring the defect sites and surface species evolution during the reaction. The accumulation of polyene-like chains, formed through CO dissociative adsorption at the catalyst surface, was observed and their disappearance was related to the catalyst light-off temperature. Moreover, the doped samples exhibited a rise of the Raman bands associated to defects after the tests, consequence of the structural rearrangements occurring during CO oxidation. Indeed, in-situ Raman measurements during reduction (CO/N-2) and oxidation cycles at 400 degrees C evidenced the formation of oxygen vacancy clusters in reducing atmosphere, which could reorganize not only in O-2 but also upon a temperature decrease, forming isolated vacancies and then evolving in Frenkel and extrinsic oxidized dopant-containing sites when exposed to oxygen.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000527742100004

Given that cocatalysts play two important roles, in charge trapping and surface reactions, the rational material design of cocatalysts would be an effective route in pursuing their maximum contribution to the performance of photocatalysts. In this review, we aim to outline the recent progress of surface and interface design in cocatalysts for photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction. We first introduce the surface design of cocatalysts, which enables the enhancement of specific water splitting or CO2 reduction reactions through surface parameter (e. g., the composition, facets and phases) adjustments. We then present key parameters for designing the interface between photocatalyst and cocatalyst, which offer a set of versatile options for tuning the charge transfer to the cocatalyst. Taken together, the surface and interface of cocatalysts may have synergetic effects on the photocatalytic performance, which are discussed to provide guidance for simultaneously tailoring surface and interface parameters. Finally, we summarize the challenges and opportunities for the surface and interface design of cocatalysts for the efficient production of solar fuels.									142	11	0	0	9	0	144				2046-2069		WOS:000378755200093		
J	Zhao Shijie; Li Na; Sun Liping; Li Qiang; Huo Lihua; Zhao Hui								One-pot synthesis Pr6O11 decorated Pr2CuO4 composite cathode for solid oxide fuel cells								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				47	9			6227	6236		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.250				JAN 29 2022	2022	It is a big challenge to develop composite materials with high catalytic activity and stability in a fast and simple way in the field of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). In this paper, Pr2CuO4Pr6O11 composites are prepared by a novel one-pot synthesis method. The temperature dependent phase evolution of the composite material is studied, and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) properties are characterized in detail by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy combining with the distribution of relaxation time analysis. The decoration of Pr6O11 effectively inhibits the coarsening of Pr2CuO4 particles, enlarging the specific surface area and thereby promoting the oxygen adsorption capability of the composite cathode. Compared to Pr2CuO4, the polarization resistance of Pr2CuO4-20%Pr6O11 is 0.07 U cm2 at 700 degrees C, and the power (current) density reachs to 0.97 W cm-2 (1.62 A cm-2) at 0.6 V for the anode supported fuel cell. This result proves that one-pot synthesis method is an effective strategy to design cathode materials with high activity, and Pr2CuO4-20%Pr6O11 is potential cathode material for SOFC.

An electrolyte effect on catalytic performance was observed. Under purified conditions, current densities followed the trend Cs+ > K+ approximate to Na+ approximate to Li+ at current densities > 1 mA/cm(2). Under Fe-saturated conditions, current densities followed the trend K+ approximate to Na+ > Cs+ > Li+ at all current densities. Voltammetry was coupled with Raman spectroscopy for studies in LiOH and CsOH. Raman spectra were fit to Gaussian functions and analyzed quantitatively based on mean peak positions. Both purified and Fe-saturated CsOH promoted slightly lower peak positions than purified and Fe-saturated LiOH, indicating that CsOH promoted a NiOOH active-phase structure with longer Ni-O bonds. Both Fe-saturated CsOH and LiOH promoted slightly lower Raman peak positions than purified CsOH and LiOH, but only for one of the two Raman peaks. These results indicate that Fe promoted an active-phase structure with slightly longer Ni-O bonds. This study shows that the catalytic performance and active-phase structure of NiOOH can be tuned by simply varying the alkaline electrolyte and electrolyte Fe levels.									72	2	0	0	2	0	73			1932-7447			WOS:000355495600022

The N-2 plasma treatment was combined with in vacuo pre-heating to remove adsorbates and with surface shielding to reduce plasma-induced corrosion. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy revealed full nitrogenation of the surface with the presence of C-N and C=N bond structures. Anodic treatment in 0.1 M KOH in the oxygen evolution range generated nitrogen-oxygen bonds and carbon-oxygen functionalities which partially substitute the initial nitrogen-termination. The nitrogenated and electrochemically polarised diamond electrode exhibited higher catalytic activity to [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) but slower to [Ru(NH3)(6)](3+/2+) redox reactions, as compared to an identical diamond electrode with fully oxygen-terminated surface.

In this work, asymmetric thin-film LSCF membranes supported over a porous LSCF support were manufactured by inverse sequential tape casting. Moreover, surface activation was accomplished by depositing a porous LSCF activation layer in order to promote oxygen evolution reaction, i.e. O2- to O-2 oxidation, in the permeate membrane side. In this case, the porous layer allows the surface area available for oxygen activation to be enlarged. Both the manufacturing of the asymmetric thin-film membranes and the surface activation are described in detail. A thorough study of the oxygen permeation is presented for disk-shaped 30 mu m thick LSCF-supported membranes considering the following operating parameters: temperature (1000-600 degrees C), sweep flow rate (300-750 ml min(-1) argon) and oxygen partial pressure in the feed (0.21-1 atm). High permeation fluxes were achieved, e.g., 11.87 ml min(-1) cm(-2) at 1000 degrees C and 300 ml min(-1) argon sweep when using pure oxygen as feed. A change in the apparent activation energy at about 850 degrees C was related to a reversible structural change in the perovskite symmetry (cubic <-> rhombohedral), as revealed by XRD measurements. Furthermore, the application of an activation layer allowed the permeation process to be improved, especially at low temperatures, i.e. below 800 degrees C. Specifically, an improvement of up to about 300% at 600 degrees C is observed upon application of the activation layer. The activated membrane reached a flux of 13.3 ml min(-1) cm(-2) at 1000 degrees C under an O-2/Ar gradient. Additional permeation tests using CO2-rich sweep gas demonstrated the good stability and performance of these LSCF asymmetric membranes at 900 and 1000 degrees C. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, experiments and calculations reveal the redistribution of electron density due to doping and vacancy defects, and confirm the contribution of multiple active sites to the dissociation and desorption of water with favorable thermodynamics. The Co/Ni-doped defect-rich Cu-based oxides (CNC-MO) nanoarrays promote water dissociation and hydrogen desorption via bonding with *OH and *H respectively, thus accelerating hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Ni/Co-doped defect-rich Cu-based sulfides (CNC-MS) nanorods modulate the adsorption state of *OH while effectively adsorbing and isolating *H to improve the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. Asymmetric electrodes can achieve alkaline seawater electrolysis with 100 mA cm-2 at a voltage of 1.61 V. The corrosion resistance, high efficiency, and selectivity of electrodes can remain stable for 1200 h in a saline-alkali medium, and then gradually decline with sites blocking and deep corrosion. The aim of this work is to propose design strategies for the construction of high-performance electrocatalysts for seawater splitting while balancing multiple factors such as cost, efficiency, and durability.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000685257700003

Their fascinating properties, such as high surface area, tunable metallocenters and functional groups, are highly notable. The incorporation of MOFs into the polymeric fibers is considered to be an important finding in various research fields. An electrospinning technique is considered to be the most reliable way to synthesize one-dimensional nanofibers. In this study, we have synthesized a bimetallic zeolite imidazolate framework (ZIF) material, and the synthesized material is incorporated with a suitable polymer for the formation of nanofibers. The polymeric property of the obtained CoNi-ZIF-RT has been tested by annealing at 500 degrees C in nitrogen (N-2) and air atmospheric conditions, which were assessed for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH. Because of its high polymeric nature along with its virtuous intrinsic activity, CoNi-ZIF-RT had shown high electrocatalytic OER activity with facile electron transfer and extraordinary stability. CoNi-ZIF nanofibers have been synthesized via an electrospinning approach and are denoted as CoNi-ZIF-RT, CoNi-ZIF-500-N-2, and CoNi-ZIF-500-Air as per their synthesis procedure. Interestingly, CoNi-ZIF-RT showed better OER activity in an alkaline medium compared to the other materials.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			2574-0970			WOS:000537534900030

In this work, a gentle ligand-competition amorphization is used to shape the amorphous aMIL-53(Al) nanosheets enriched oxygen vacancies. The Co-LDH nanoplate is pregnant from Co-ZIF. Thus, the layered 2D/2D aMIL-53(Al)/Co-LDH p-n junction (aMC-x) has been optionally designed. The charge redistribution across the p-n junction has made Co-LDH positive and aMIL-53(Al) negative in the space-charge region. Benefiting from compositional heterogeneity with band bending and oxygen vacancies, the aMC-1 has yielded excellent electrochemical merits for oxygen evolution and capacitive performance. A high specific capacitance of 773.2 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) is achieved, about 2.23 and 44.8 folds higher than those of original Co-LDH and aMIL-53(Al), respectively. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) could provide a maximum power density of 7978.8 W kg(-1) at a current density of 9.8 Wh kg(-1) and good durability. Moreover, the aMIL-53(Al)/Co-LDH heterojunction achieves a lower overpotential of 278 mV and smaller Tafel slope of 51.1 mV dec(-1) in OER. As expected, the synergistic effect in the p-n junction based on amorphous MOF is a potential strategy to regulate the electronic structure and promote the electrochemical activities.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000848145000002

In this work, we present a double thin-layer strategy for finding unique and solid evidence for the role of Fe in the OER mechanism. A thin-layer catalyst of a few nanometers of thickness was deposited on a Ni substrate and a thin-layer electrolyte of 0.1 mm thickness was created using a thin-layer spectroelectrochemical cell. The OER activity, the catalyst composition, and the electrolyte species were investigated together as a function of the Fe deposition time. The results show that trace Fe incorporation favors the formation of beta-NiOOH in the thin-layer catalyst and effectively suppresses the dissolution of NiOOH into the electrolyte. The results of double-potential step chronoabsorptometry and cyclic voltabsorptometry demonstrate the potential-dependent formation of a Ni3+ intermediate in the electrolyte and, more importantly, the dissolution suppression effect due to Fe incorporation. These findings link the role of Fe in OER catalysis to the increased insolubility of Ni3+ active sites and highlight the importance of paying close attention to the active-site stability of an electrocatalyst impaired by the electrolyte at a reaction potential.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0743-7463			WOS:000537150900006	32336103

However, clarifying the growth pathway and surface dynamics of active products regulated by water at the nanoscale is still at a preliminary stage. Here, the interfacial evolution of cathode processes mediated by water in Li-O-2 batteries is successfully revealed by using in situ atomic force microscopy. Under the regulation of additive water, the morphology of discharge product Li2O2 is changed from a toroidal shape to a lamellar one with water content increasing, by contrast, the latter one shows a lower decomposition potential with faster dynamics upon charging. Moreover, real-time visualization directly shows that inducing water into the DMSO-based electrolyte can switch the pathway of Li2O2 nucleation from a surface-mediated mechanism to solution-mediated mechanism, which in turn affects product distribution and battery performance. Furthermore, it is found that the applied current density and additive water can antagonistically impact the interfacial behavior. The insights into the effect of water on the nucleation modes and evolution processes of Li2O2 provides a deeper understanding of the interfacial reactions in Li-O-2 batteries.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000583754400001

Herein, a hierarchical Co3O4-decorated CuO-Cu2O nanorod core-shell structure was in situ grown on a Cu foam (denoted as CuOx@Co3O4 NRs/CF) and investigated as a bifunctional catalyst for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. Benefiting from its large electrochemical surface area and the synergetic effects between the CuOx core and Co3O4 shell, CuOx@Co3O4 NRs/CF exhibited considerable catalytic activity, which resulted in a small overpotential of 240 mV for the OER and 242 mV for the HER at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), along with low Tafel slopes of 46 and 61 mV dec(-1), respectively. Remarkably, CuOx@Co3O4 NRs/CF could continuously produce O-2 or H-2 for at least 24 h with negligible decline in catalytic activity, and it gave rise to high faradaic efficiencies of 99.7% and 96.4% for the OER and HER, respectively. The electrochemical performance of CuOx@Co3O4 NRs/CF was dramatically improved as compared to those of its CuOx NRs/CF counterpart and also most reported Cu-based water splitting electrocatalysts.									90	2	0	0	3	0	90			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000443116700047

Herein, a highly active and stable catalyst for HER has been developed on the basis of molybdenum-carbide-modified N-doped carbon vesicle encapsulating Ni nanoparticles (MoxC-Ni@NCV). This MoxC-Ni@NCV material was synthesized simply by the solid-state thermolysis of melamine-related composites of oxalate and molybdate with uniform Ni ions doping (Ni@MOM-com). Notably, the prepared MoxC-Ni@NCV was almost the most efficient NPMCs for HER in acidic electrolyte to date. Besides good long-term stability, MoxC-Ni@NCV exhibited a quiet low overpotential that was comparable to Pt/C. Thus, this work opens a new avenue toward the development of highly efficient, inexpensive HER catalysts.									353	25	1	0	15	0	356			0002-7863			WOS:000367562800033	26623664

In this work, taking the advantage of the remarkable features of nickel foam, a holey branch-like structure of NiCoS deposition supported on nickel foam (NF) was obtained via altering the current density in the whole electrolytic process for gradient electrodeposition. Benefiting from the three-dimension porous structure of nickel foam skeleton connected by spherical particles of irregular size and the strong synergistic effect among Ni, Co and S elements, NiCoS/NF only needed overpotential of 287 mV, Tafel slope of 64.74 mV dec(-1) and an excellent stability of 25 h in 1.0 M KOH at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2). Importantly, originated from the interconnected nanoparticles, this branchlike structure and the Co-doping optimized electronic structure are responsible for the rapidly enlarged ECSA value 19,650 cm(-2) of deposition and the TOF value 2.2704 s(-1).

However, at 1200 s we could identify a new steady state that is significantly different from the original one-dimensional model. There is considerable overshooting at both the top and bottom boundaries of the convection zone. Beyond the boundaries, the convective velocity falls off exponentially, with excitation of internal modes. The resulting mixing greatly affects the evolution of the simulations. Connections with other works of simulation of convection, in which such behavior is found in a different context, are discussed.									51	0	0	0	0	0	51			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000166018300042

Density functional theory calculations are used here to explore the elementary kinetics of nitrogen reduction and hydrogen evolution on W(110). All proton-electron transfer barriers are calculated at-0.7 V vs. SHE, where the cathodic potential is explicitly modelled using a solvation bilayer of water with hydronium ions. The protonation of adsorbed NH is determined to be rate-limiting for nitrogen reduction, with a barrier of 0.65 eV. The same reaction step is potential-limiting based on the thermochemistry of adsorbed intermediates only, showing that thermochemical calculations suffice to predict catalytic trends for nitrogen reduction. The largest barrier found for hydrogen evolution at high hydrogen coverage is 0.36 eV. Thus, hydrogen evolution is expected to dominate over nitrogen reduction on W(110) at negative potentials.

The hierarchical 3D architectured Ag NW@NiMn-LDH catalysts exhibit superb OER/ORR activities in alkaline conditions. The outstanding bifunctional activities of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs are essentially attributed to increasing both site activity and site populations. The synergistic contributions from the hierarchical 3D open-pore structure of the LDH shells, improved electrical conductivity, and small thickness of the LDHs shells are associated with more accessible site populations. Moreover, the charge transfer between Ag cores and metals of LDH shells and the formation of defective and distorted sites (less coordinated Ni and Mn sites) strongly enhance the site activity. Thus, Ag NW@NiMn-LDH hybrids exhibit a 0.75 V overvoltage difference between ORR and OER with excellent durability for 30 h, demonstrating the distinguished bifunctional electrocatalyst reported to date. Interestingly, the homemade rechargeable Zn-air battery using the hybrid Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs (1:2) catalyst as the air electrode exhibits a charge-discharge voltage gap of similar to 0.77 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and shows excellent cycling stability. Thus, the concept of the hierarchical 3D architecture of Ag NW@NiMn-LDHs considerably advances the practice of LDHs toward metal-air batteries and oxygen electrocatalysts.									87	1	0	0	6	0	85			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000518024700047	32003975

Damage evolution and annealing of Au-irradiated samarium titanate pyrochlore								Radiation Effects and Ion-Beam Processing of Materials Symposium (Mater. Res. Soc. Symposium Proceedings Vol.792)								69	74						2003	2003	Damage evolution and thermal recovery of 1 MeV Au2+ irradiated samarium titanate pyrochlore (Sm2Ti2O7) single crystals were studied by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and nuclear reaction analysis. The damage accumulation follows a nonlinear dependence on dose that is well described by a disorder accumulation model, which indicates a predominant role of defect-stimulated amorphization processes. The critical dose for amorphization at 170 and 300 K is ~0.14 dpa, and a higher dose of ~0.22 dpa is observed for irradiation at 700 K, which agrees with previous in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data for polycrystalline Sm2Ti2O7. Annealing in an 18O environment reveals a damage recovery stage at ~850 K that coincides with a significant increase in 18O exchange due to oxygen vacancy mobility. This thermal recovery stage is also consistent with the critical temperature for amorphization measured by in-situ TEM in polycrystalline samples.

The high-resolution TEM image of pea pod-shaped nanowires revealed a weak crystalline structure. Some regions were amorphous and some regions showed well-resolved lattice fringe. Because flower-like Co9S8 microballs possessed the more catalytic active sites of the weak crystalline character and the fast electron transfer along the nanowires, they would be promising catalysts for reduction of I-3(-) in DSSCs and electrochemical water splitting. As the counter electrode catalysts for I-3(-) reduction, DSSCs based on the Co9S8 microballs got a high photoelectrical conversion efficiency of 7.0%, which was comparable with DSSCs based on standard platinum (7.48%). As the electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction, the Co9S8 microball electrode possessed an overpotential of 173.8 and 191.3 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acid and alkaline solution, respectively. Also, it displayed a superior catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction. The stability tests indicated that this microball could possess the high catalytic activity with long time. This kind of Co9S8 microballs assembled with weak crystalline pea pod-shaped nanowires paved a new way to low-cost catalyst for I-3(-) reduction and water splitting.

Herein, oxygen and potassium dual-heteroatom incorporated polymeric carbon nitride (O/K-CN) is rationally designed for H2O2 generation with an ultrahigh rate of 309.44 mu M h(-1) mg(-1), which surpasses that of other C3N4-based photocatalysts. The enhanced performance can be ascribed to the effective light absorption, fast charge transfer/separation, strong oxygen adsorption, and highly selective two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Density functional theory calculations further confirm that the obtained O/K-CN is more favorable than others for electrons migrating from beta spin-orbital to pi* orbitals of O-2 molecule, thus optimizing O-2 molecule activation to promote the formation of intermediate species *OOH and decrease the energy barrier of H2O2 production. This work not only provides in-depth insights for the photocatalytic H2O2 generation mechanism, but also lays the foundation for further development of highly active photocatalysts for environmental remediation and energy conversion.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000823431400001

We report a systematic theoretical study of the successive oxidation reactions of the Mo27SxOy nanoparticles and the reaction network, along with the electronic structure changes caused by the oxygen substitution. The replacement of surface sulfur by oxygen atoms is thermodynamically favorable. Our results indicate that the oxidation on the S edge with 100% and 50% coverage is more favored than on the Mo edge. Meanwhile, it is found that the oxidation on the S edge with 100% coverage has similar replacement ability by oxygen as on the S edge with 50% coverage. Thus, sulfur coverage does not play an important role in the oxidation on the S edge. Further comparison shows that the oxidation on corner sites is more favorable than on edge sites. In addition, the replacement of the bulky sulfur on the Mo edge is equally as favored as those of sulfur on the S edge. This work provides important information on the thermodynamics of the Mo27SxOy nanoparticles, and gives new insights into the mechanism of the oxidation of MoS2 and the sulfidation of MoO3.									15	1	0	0	1	0	15			2046-2069			WOS:000393761600017

Thus it is expected to play a vital role in the future clean energy economy. Crucial to enabling this ideal vision is the development of high-performance and cost-effective electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a representative non-precious HER catalyst. A panoramic view of its researches and developments clearly shows that leading theoretical perspectives, logical material design, novel synthesis methods and advanced characterization technologies are the key components of a successful electrocatalyst implementation. At the same time, it also reflects the current research mode and points out the development directions of the electrocatalysts. This review covers a sequence of key discoveries and achievements that mark the development of MoS2 as a HER electrocatalyst, with special focuses on the implementation, effect and mechanism of the modification strategies including increasing the number of active edge sites, improvement of electrical conductivity and activation of inert basal planes. Finally, we briefly discuss the enlightenment from the studies of MoS2 electrocatalyst and look forward to the future trends of this appealing electrocatalytic material.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1005-281X			WOS:000700373200002

In particular, the effects of Nb substitution on phase evolution, thermal expansion behavior and electrochemical performance were systematically investigated. The average thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of BSFNx decreases from 13.3 x 10(-6) K-1 at x = 0.05 to 12.6 X 10(-6) K-1 at x = 0.15 within a temperature range of 50800 degrees C. Among the BSFNx materials, Bi0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Nb0.1O3-delta (BSFN0.10) oxide shows the best electrochemical performance. The polarization resistances (R-p) of BSFN0.10 cathode on CGO electrolyte are 0.038, 0.075 and 0.156 Omega cm(2) at 700, 650 and 600 degrees C, respectively. Meanwhile the maximum power densities of the anode-supported single cells are 1.28, 1.54 and 1.34 W cm(-2) at 700 degrees C for BSFNx cathodes with x = 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15, respectively. Furthermore, the relationship study of oxygen partial pressure dependence on R-p indicates that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) rate-limiting step is the oxygen adsorption-dissociation on the electrode surface. The desirable electrochemical performance demonstrates that BSFNx oxides are potential cathode materials for IT-SOFCs.									39	2	0	0	0	0	39			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000416188600011

The structure and morphology of the hybrid are investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) tests. XRD tests reveal that the Cr2O3 with hexagonal structure is obtained. SEM and TEM tests show that the nano-Cr2O3 is supported by rGO sheet. The cyclic voltammetry, tafel, linear scanning voltammetry and current-time chronoamperometric tests prove that the obtained Cr2O3/rGO hybrid has a remarkable catalytic activity and good stability for oxygen reduction. Both the rotating disc electrode and rotating ring disc electrode tests approve that the ORR major happens through 4-electron reaction style. The Cr2O3/rGO hybrid is a promising low cost and high performances catalyst for ORR of alkaline electrolyte. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, the CoFe(OH)x/GO composites with accordion-like CoFe(OH)x nanosheets clusters dispersed on graphene oxide (GO) sheets are prepared via a template-assisted route. It is found that the OER performance of the CoFe(OH)x/GO composites strongly depends on the content of GO and the mole ratio of Co/Fe. The optimized CoFe(OH)x/GO composites exhibit remarkably enhanced OER electrocatalytic activity in 1 M KOH with a low overpotential of 294 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 63.4 mV dec-1, which are far superior to the corresponding Co(OH)2/GO and bare CoFe(OH)x. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the regulated electronic structure surrounding the active metal sites by introducing Fe, the improved conductivity by GO for faster charge transfer, and the accordion-like hierarchical structure with increased accessible active sites. This work demonstrates a comprehensive strategy to improve the electrocatalytic performance of transition metal hydroxide based OER catalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000741300200005

We report the synthesis of nickel sulfide (NiS) nanoflakes by aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) on Ni foam. Upon electrochemical measurements, NiS nanoflake films exhibit excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability in basic solutions, advancing an attractive alternative to precious metals and other transition-metal catalysts that have been extensively investigated. The NiS@Ni-Foam prepared at 350 degrees C offered a high current density of 1100 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 450 mV with a Tafel slope of 81.3 mV/dec. Furthermore, it remained durable at a constant current for >15 h in 1 M KOH solution. The high OER activity of NiS@Ni-Foam prepared at 350 degrees C is due to the nanoflake-like morphology and crystalline structure, as observed under scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Likewise, NiS@Ni-Foam prepared at 350 degrees C provided a high specific surface area for facile ion transport, charge transfer, and enormous electrochemical active sites. Hence, it collectively resulted in enhanced water splitting oxygen evolution reaction (OER).									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000707030800059

In addition to using the new greatly improved data published by Edvardsson et al. and the oxygen abundance distribution function of G dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood as improved by Sommer-Larsen, we take into account new survey data on metal-deficient stars which show that the thick-disc population extends to arbitrarily low metallicities, meaning that a significant proportion of stars previously classified as belonging to the halo, on grounds of low metallicity, actually belong to the disc and should be modelled as such, without bringing in any prior phase associated with the halo. Comparison with theoretical yields from Type II and Type Ia supernovae shows good agreement, as has previously been found by Tsujimoto et al. using a different approach.									151	1	0	0	0	0	151			0035-8711			WOS:A1995RV94000016

A self-prepared TiO2 was utilized during the photocatalytic investigations in a bare and a platinized form. The synthesized pure anatase phase TiO2 had a 10 nm grain size and a BET surface area of ca. 121 m(2) g(-1) with relatively higher photocatalytic activity compared to the commercially available TiO2 photocatalyst UV100. Complete photocatalytic degradation of oxalic acid was observed within 60 min of illumination under aerobic condition with no by-product been detected. In the absence of molecular oxygen, a perceptible amount of formic acid was formed in the liquid phase, as determined quantitatively by means of ion chromatography. The formation of formic acid suggests that a photo-Kolbe reaction tacks place under oxygen-free conditions. The formation of formic acid was also noticed when platinized TiO2 (0.25 wt.%) was employed, together with an enhancement of the reactions photonic efficiency to the quadruple. A hydrogen evolution could only observe under oxygen-free condition with, again, a higher formation rate over the platinized material. However, upon complete photoreforming of oxalic acid the overall amount of the photocatalytically evolved hydrogen using Pt-0.25%/TiO2 represented only 60% of the theoretical amount. Therefore, it is suggested that the source of H atoms could be the (HCO4-)-O-2 species rather than molecular oxalic acid. A detailed mechanism for the photocatalytic degradation of aqueous oxalic acid at different photocatalytic conditions is proposed and discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This Perspective describes reaction mechanisms in such systems and details the use of in situ scanning probe microscopy to investigate reactions of gas-phase radicals with self-assembled alkanethiolate monolayers on gold surfaces. For both atomic hydrogen and atomic chlorine reagents, the presence of defects in the alkanethiolate surface order has a substantial influence on what reactions can occur and the speed at which they do so. Data acquired from a series of images were modeled using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, and a surface radical reaction model was developed to explain the observed evolution of surface structure as the reactions proceed.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1948-7185			WOS:000328101000016

This compression wave is induced by the thermal pressure of the cloud outer envelope heated by UV photons. Gas-phase and grain-surface chemical reactions to produce simple molecules of the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen families are shown to be most active precisely in the wave region. The formation of molecules is most effective in the inner part of the compression wave, while its outer part is dominated by the evaporation of icy grain mantles. The chemical coupling between gas and dust causes a local increase in the number densities of chemically active radicals, such as C, N, O, NH, and OH, and hydrogen-saturated CH4, NH3, and H2O molecules. It has been found that the chemical evolution in the compression-wave region can account for the observed abundance of water and ammonia in interstellar clouds.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1063-7729			WOS:000083056700003

After the OFGs were removed, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in 0.1 M HClO4 decreased. The greatest decrease was observed between 300 degrees C and 500 degrees C annealed samples, with onset potential shifting from approximately 0.86 V-0.82 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), indicating paired carboxyl groups contribute to the formation of active sites. The overall nitrogen content, FeNx content, and electron transfer number all followed the same pattern. These findings support the importance of carboxyl groups in nitrogen doping and the formation of FeNx structure in DMWNTs. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

An one-pot method to synthesize boron-doped RhFe alloy with excellent catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution is reported in the present work. Rhodium-Iron (RhFe) alloy nanoparticles, with diameter ranging from 1 to 5 nm, are distributed uniformly on the carbon support. The corresponding physicochemical and electrochemical results display that the sample of Rh:Fe = 2:1 post-treated at 200 degrees C (BRF21) shows the best performance for hydrogen evolution in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution; it exhibits good catalytic activity at a near zero onset potential. The required overpotential is found to be of about 25 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is 4 mV less than that of commercial Pt/C (29 mV); the Tafel slope is also comparable (32 mV dec(-1)) with Pt/C (30 mV dec(-1)). This work may provide a facile and environmentally friendly method to prepare B-doped catalysts with high electrochemical hydrogen evolution efficiency.									92	2	0	0	4	0	93			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000429500100007

Therefore, finding highly active electrocatalysts and clarifying the mechanism of water dissociation are challenging but important. In this study, we report an integrated nanoporous nickel (np-Ni) catalyst with high alkaline HER performance and the origin of the corresponding enhanced catalytic activity. In 1 mol L-1 KOH solution, this np-Ni electrode shows an HER overpotential of 20 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), along with fast water dissociation kinetics. The excellent performance is not only attributed to the large surface area provided by the three-dimensional interconnected conductive network but also from the enhanced intrinsic activity induced by the unique surface properties. Further studies reveal that the types of oxygen species that naturally form on the Ni surface play a key role in water dissociation. Remarkably, when the lattice oxygen almost disappears, the Ni surface terminates with adsorbed oxygen (O-ads), exhibiting the fastest water dissociation kinetics. Density functional theory calculation suggests that when O-ads acts as the surface termination of Ni metal, the orientation and configuration of polar water molecules are strongly affected by O-ads. Finally, the H-OH bond of interfacial water molecules is effectively activated in a manner similar to hydrogen bonding. This work not only identifies a high-performance and low-cost electrocatalyst but also provides new insights into the chemical processes underlying water dissociation, thus benefiting the rational design of electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000766101200002

Revista de medicina de la Universidad de Navarra				40	3			31	40						1996 Jul-Sep	1996	The reactions which involve oxidants and free radicals species have played an essential role at the beginning of aerobic life, and they are an intrinsic part in the regulation of the cellular processes. However, as a result of the derived toxic effects of these oxidative processes, antioxidants molecules appeared in the very early stages of the evolution and they are able to control the production of these reactants and their dangerous effects. Oxidants and antioxidants have a clear function in the cellular physiology. When this delicate balance change many biochemical and cellular reactions are altered, and that may cause different pathologic diseases. In addition, free radicals of oxygen are thought to play a growing role in the biological process of ageing (1). It is not unusual to find papers about these reactants in every topic of the biomedicine. The main oxidants and free radicals in the organisms are oxygen-related agents, which are globally called reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI). These unavoidable, useful and dangerous biological oxidants are well characterized, although the recent implications they received in some pathologies deserve, in our opinion, a general review.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0556-6177			MEDLINE:9499824	9499824

The as-prepared hierarchical core-shell NiCo2S4@CoNi-LDH nanoarrays were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and EDS mapping technologies. Electrochemical measurements showed that the OER catalytic activity of as-obtained NiCo2S4@CoNi-LDH catalyst could be tuned by the molar ratio of Co/Ni in CoNi-LDH. Experiments uncovered that NiCo2S4@Co1Ni4-LDH catalyst prepared at the Co/Ni molar ratio of 1:4 exhibited the strongest OER electrocatalytic activity. To deliver the current densities of 100 mA cm(-2), the as-obtained NiCo2S4@Co1Ni4-LDH catalyst required the overpotential of 337 mV in 1.0 M KOH solution. After continuously catalyzing for 40 h, the voltage curve hardly waved, presenting excellent long-term stability. The present work is a useful attempt for constructing highly active and cost-effective OER catalyst. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This self-standing 3D core-shell nanohybrid design with unique materials chemistry and excellent interface engineering enhances the mass transport and stimulates the production of active sites during the oxygen evolution reaction. Serving as the anode catalysts, the resulting self-standing Co-Fe-Bi/NiCo2O4/NF nanohybrid electrocatalysts show a better electrocatalytic activity with an overpotential of 227 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), a Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1), excellent durability over 40 h, and the ability to deliver a current density of 200 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of similar to 410 mV in an alkaline medium. Thus, the excellent electrocatalytic performance of the Co-Fe-Bi/NiCo2O4/NF nanohybrid demonstrates the importance of design and development of core-shell nanohybrids for large-scale practical applications in a multitude of energy conversion devices.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2574-0962			WOS:000537656400033

However, there are still some problems with the electrocatalytic OER, for example, high overpotential and sluggish kinetics. Herein, we prepare 15 nm-thick two-dimensional (2D) composite nanosheets containing Co9S8 and NiS on nickel foam. In the electrocatalytic OER, the overpotential at 50 mA cm(-2) of the composite nanosheets is 253 mV, with a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec(-1). The electrocatalytic efficiency of the composite nanosheets is much better, as compared with the pure Co9S8, pure NiS, and conventional IrO2 catalysts. The 2D composite nanosheets are flexible for electron transfer to trigger water splitting, thus enhancing the efficiency of the composite nanosheets in the electrocatalytic OER Besides, theoretical calculations imply that the Co9S8-NiS interface on the composite nanosheets is the active site for the adsorption and splitting of the water molecules and promotes the transfer of the electrons from both Co9S8 and NiS to the water molecule. This also favors for improving the efficiency of the composite nanosheets in the electrocatalytic OER. The results of the present work are beneficial for developing efficient noble metal-free catalysts for electrocatalysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0888-5885			WOS:000505632500029

Nanostructured hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) is one of the most attractive materials for a highly efficient charge carrier generation and collection due to its large specific surface area and the short minority carrier diffusion length. In the present work, the PEC water splitting performance of nanostructured alpha-Fe2O3 is investigated which was prepared by anodization followed by annealing in a low oxygen ambient (0.03 % O-2 in Ar). It was found that low oxygen annealing can activate a significant PEC response of alpha-Fe2O3 even at a low temperature of 400 degrees C and provide an excellent PEC performance compared with classic air annealing. The photocurrent of the alpha-Fe2O3 annealed in the low oxygen at 1.5 V vs. RHE results as 0.5 mA cm(-2), being 20 times higher than that of annealing in air. The obtained results show that the alpha-Fe2O3 annealed in low oxygen contains beneficial defects and promotes the transport of holes; it can be attributed to the improvement of conductivity due to the introduction of suitable oxygen vacancies in the alpha-Fe2O3. Additionally, we demonstrate the photocurrent of alpha-Fe2O3 annealed in low oxygen ambient can be further enhanced by Zn-Co LDH, which is a co-catalyst of oxygen evolution reaction. This indicates low oxygen annealing generates a promising method to obtain an excellent PEC water splitting performance from alpha-Fe2O3 photoanodes.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000512441800001	31788871

Herein, we present an economical approach for the synthesis of a bifunctional electrocatalyst consisting of cobalt chromium nanostructures entrapped in a graphene tube doped with nitrogen (CoCr@NGT). The graphene tube is of a large size (cross-sectional diameter similar to 100 nm) with a wall thickness of more than 10 graphene layers. The Cr alloying with the entrapped Co in the NGT drastically enhanced both the HER and OER performance with a low overpotential (eta) and better current density along with long-term durability. Hence, CoCr@NGT can be used as a total alkaline water electrolyzer as both an anode and cathode catalyst delivering a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at around 1.58 V for a long period of time competing with the state-of-the-art combination of Pt-C and RuO2. The electrochemical performance strongly depends on the Cr due to its corrosion resistance capability and improved catalytic sites, which leads to long-term stability and very high activity, respectively.									29	0	0	0	2	0	29			2574-0962			WOS:000458705200026

In this paper, for the first time we report an in situ growth of iron nickel nitride nanostructures on surface-redox-etching Ni foam (FeNi3N/NF) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. This method does not require a specially added nickel precursor nor an oxidizing agent, but achieves well-dispersed iron nickel nitride nanostructures that are grown directly on the nickel foam surface. The commercial Ni foam in this work not only acts as a substrate but also serves as a slow-releasing nickel precursor that is induced by redox-etching of Fe3+. FeCl2 is a more preferable iron precursor than FeCl3 for no matter quality of FeNi3N growth or its electrocatalytic behaviors. The obtained FeNi3N/NF exhibits extraordinarily high activities for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with low overpotentials of 202 and 75 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slopes of 40 and 98 mV dec(-1), respectively. In addition, the presented FeNi3N/NF catalyst has an extremely good durability, reflecting in more than 400 h of consistent galvanostatic electrolysis without any visible voltage elevation.									375	22	0	0	9	0	381			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000385336500017

To further improve their electrocatalytic performance, it is critical to maximize the density of active sites on the surface while maintaining a high structural order level of the NiOOH host. In this work a unique photochemical-electrochemical strategy is reported to fabricate an active Fe-doped Ni oxyhydroxide electrocatalyst on a three-dimensional carbon cloth scaffold (Fe-NiOOH@CC). Raman depth profiling suggests abundant Fe-containing active sites on the surface of the NiOOH matrix, and NiOOH itself remains highly crystalline with a low structural disorder level in the as-synthesized Fe-NiOOH@CC. Due to this compelling property, it exhibits higher OER catalytic activity than RuO2 and other NiFe analogues and maintains its activity for at least 55 h at similar to 150 mA cm(-2). This photochemical-electrochemical method is applicable to other transition metals and substrates, thus offering a unique while universal strategy for synthesis of OER electrocatalysts.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000621407000039

In this aim, we have prepared a novel series of electrocatalysts Nd1-xFeO3 (x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) by sol-gel method. The effect of the deficiency in the A-site on the structure, morphology, surface and electrocatalytic activity of these perovskites were studied by means of XRD, XPS, MEB, LSV, EIS and chronopotentiometric measurements. Among all the samples, Nd0.9FeO3 (denoted NF10) exhibits the higher catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 370 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 79 mV dec(-1) and a good electrochemical stability in 1 M KOH solution. The OER performance of NF10 can be effectively enhanced by optimizing iron valence and highly oxidative oxygen species (O-2(2-)/O-) based on the surface of catalyst.

We have done the Monte Carlo simulation to follow the chemical processes occurring on the grain surfaces. We consider H, O, CO as the accreting species from the gas phase and allow 10 chemical reactions among them on grains. We found that the Monte Carlo results deviate significantly from the Rate equation method. We incorporate our correction term in the Rate equation and found an excellent agreement between these two methods.					1st International Conference on Chemical Evolution of Star Forming Region and Origin of Life (Astrochem)1st International Conference on Chemical Evolution of Star Forming Region and Origin of Life (Astrochem)	JUL 10-13, 2012JUL 10-13, 2012	Govt India, Council Sci & Ind ResGovt India, Council Sci & Ind Res	S N Bose Natl Ctr Basic Sci, Kolkata, INDIAS N Bose Natl Ctr Basic Sci, Kolkata, INDIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0094-243X		978-0-7354-1167-8	WOS:000323886500021

Considering their good elasticity, high conductivity, and superior thermal and chemical stability, carbon nanotubes have been widely used as a catalyst support in various electrocatalysts, while oxide or metal nanoparticles have been frequently deposited on the carbon nanotube substrate to perform as the active materials. Considering the poor contact between active materials and carbon nanotubes may introduce a challenge for long-term operating stability, in particular in flexible devices, pure carbon electrocatalyst is highly appreciated. Herein, a free-standing air electrode with cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated N-codoped carbon nanotube arrays uniformly grown on the surface of carbon fiber cloth is developed by a two-step in situ growth method. Such a carbon-based electrode shows outstanding activity for both ORR and OER. The flexible ZAB with such air electrode shows superior flexibility and stability working under extreme bending conditions. Moreover, the polarization and round-trip efficiency for the flexible battery is 0.67V and 64.4% at 2mA/cm(2), respectively, even after being operated for 30hours. This study provides a feasible way to design all carbon-based free-standing and flexible electrode and enlightens the electrode design for flexible energy conversion/storage devices.									31	3	0	0	3	0	33				2637-9368		WOS:000669749200010

Although an extensive search for OER catalysts has been performed in the past decades, cost-effective catalysts remain elusive. Herein, an amorphous cobalt phyllosilicate (ACP) with layered crystalline motif prepared by a room-temperature precipitation is introduced as a new OER catalyst; this material exhibits a remarkably low overpotential (eta approximate to 367 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)). A structural investigation using X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that the amorphous structure contains layered motifs similar to the structure of CoOOH, which is demonstrated to be responsible for the OER catalysis based on density functional theory calculations. However, the calculations also reveal that the local environment of the active site in the layered crystalline motif in the ACP is significantly modulated by the silicate, leading to a substantial reduction of. of the OER compared with that of CoOOH. This work proposes amorphous phyllosilicates as a new group of efficient OER catalysts and suggests that tuning of the catalytic activity by introducing redox-inert groups may be a new unexplored avenue for the design of novel high-performance catalysts.									70	2	0	0	3	0	71			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000402518900026	28370464

The high overpotential and low energy-conversion efficiency caused by the slow kinetics of the four-electron transfer oxygen-evolution reaction (OER), however, hamper its competitiveness. Herein, a highly stable, efficient OER catalyst was developed, taking the effects of both composition and nanostructure into account for the catalyst design. N-doped carbon-armored mixed metal phosphide nanoparticles confined in N-doped porous carbon nanoboxes, a particle-in-box nanostructure, were synthesized from monodisperse Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2)center dot H2O nanocubes through sequential conformal polydopamine coating, ammonia etching, and thermal phosphorization. The product exhibited outstanding catalytic abilities for the OER in 1.0 M KOH, delivering 10, 100, and 250 mA/cm(2) at ultrasmall overpotentials of 203, 242, and 254 mV, respectively, with an ultrasmall Tafel slope of 38 mV/dec, outperforming most recently reported top-notch iron-group-based OER catalysts. The long-term stability was also excellent, showing a small chronopotentiometric decay of 2.5% over a 24 h operation at 50 mA/cm(2). The enhanced catalytic efficiency and stability may be attributable to the unique particle-in-box structure as a nanoreactor offering a local, fast reaction environment, the conductive N-doped porous carbon shell for fast charge and mass transport, the synergistic effect between multicomponent metal phosphides for enhanced intrinsic activities, and the carbon protection layer to prevent/delay the catalyst core from being deactivated. This combined particle-in-box and chainmail design concept for electrocatalysts is unique and advantageous and may be readily applied to the general field of heterogeneous reactions.									31	1	0	0	2	0	32			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000514256400034	31913590

Recent researches have shown that layered double hydroxides (LDH) are promising candidates towards OER, but further improvement is still highly demanded for its large-scale practical application in water splitting. Herein, we report a 3D P-doped MoO3/FeCo LDH/NF (P-MoO3/FeCo LDH/NF) ultrathin nanosheet heterostructure electrocatalyst with an extremely low overpotentials of 225 mV for delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and a great durability for at least 80 h by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. Extraordinarily, the P-MoO3/FeCo LDH catalyst achieves a high current density of 300 mA cm(-2) and even 350 mA cm(-2) at an extremely low overpotential of 297 mV and 302 mV, respectively, which is crucial for the water electrolysis industry. The remarkable performance may be attributed to that the heterostructure between P-MoO3 and FeCo LDH not only optimizes electronic structure, thus inducing electron transfer from P-MoO3 to FeCo LDH and then realizing fast electron transfer rates, but also produces more catalytic active sites. Moreover, the synergetic effect between MoO3 and FeCo LDH also plays an essential role for enhancing the catalytic performances. This work explores the effect of phosphomolybdic acid on the structure, composition and performances of FeCo LDH catalysts, and also provides a simple and cost-effective way to prepare high-efficiency and low-cost layered double hydroxide electrocatalysts for OER.

New catalysts based on Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles (nNb-TiO2) and Nb-doped TiO2 nanotubes (nNb-TNTs), with n in the range 3 -10 at % (Nb Ti), were synthesized. The specific surface areas of nNb-TNTs were 250-300 m(2)g(-1), about three times higher than those of nNb-TiO2. X-ray diffraction showed the Nb incorporation into the TiO2 lattice with its consequent lattice expansion. The X-ray photoelectron spectra of Pt deposited onto Nb-doped titania revealed a negative charge accumulation on Pt, thus denoting strong metal-support interaction. The electrochemical characterization in acidic media showed that Pt supported on nNb-TiO2 and nNb-TNTs presented better activity toward the HER than that of Pt deposited onto the un-doped supports and commercial Pt on carbon. The best performance was obtained with a small Nb doping of 3 at %. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, in comparison with the commercial Pt catalyst, the development of high efficiency and low cost NPM catalysts for ORR still remains a big challenge. Here, a simple but efficient way to fabricate porous N-doped graphene immobilized molybdenum nitride (MoN) nanoparticles is reported, and simultaneously, the introduction of H2O2 plays a key role in modulating the particle size of MoN and the microstructure of the composite to achieve different configuration. As results, it is shown that the as-prepared material owns outstanding ORR activity and excellent stability in an alkaline medium. To the best knowledge, this catalyst possesses the best performance among the same class catalysts as reported. It is believed that the H2O2-assisted strategy can provide new insights in synthesis of high efficient metal nitride/carbon hybrid materials toward advanced energy conversion and storage.									46	7	0	0	5	0	50			2196-7350			WOS:000403281600012

The results obtained, combined with those of the reaction of oxygen with methane, ethane, ethene, and carbon monoxide in an empty reactor, allow us to suggest a reaction scheme for the catalytic process. The experimental results have shown that a fraction of the carbon oxides formed comes from the secondary reactions of C2, but with PrO(x) the major part of the carbon oxides results from a reaction parallel to C2 formation. The two catalysts were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). TGA experiments in various atmospheres including methane-oxygen mixtures have shown that the oxidation state of praseodymium oxide increases with oxygen partial pressure in methane as it does in an inert gas. The TGA studies indicate carbonate formation on the Li/PrO(x) surface. These carbonates are associated with lithium since none were formed on PrO(x), but the TGA experiments indicate that gaseous oxygen is necessary for their formation. XPS measurements of PrO(x) and Li/PrO(x) samples variously oxidized have confirmed the evolution in the oxidation state of praseodymium oxide and the carbonate formation on Li/PrO(x). The XPS results suggest that the addition of lithium on praseodymium oxide leads to the formation of a mixed carbonate layer and that these carbonates stabilize the Pr3+ oxidation state and suppress the Pr4+ ions which are associated with the labile oxygens responsible for surface total oxidation of methane and C2.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0166-9834			WOS:A1991FG30000008

Herein, for the first time, we report a unique lateral heterostructure of ultrathin Ni3S2 nanosheets (NSs) edged with MoS2 as an efficient and durable bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting in alkaline media. Benefiting from maximizing functional Mo-S-Ni interfaces that favor the chemisorption of hydrogen and oxygen-containing intermediates, the resultant Ni3S2/MoS2 (NiMoS) catalyst exhibits respectively low overpotentials of 78 and 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, superior to the commercial benchmarks (IrO2 and Pt/C), ranking among the best records reported to date. In particular, the NiMoS catalyst renders an attractive light-enhanced effect on both HER and OER activities due to photogenerated charge transfer at Mo-S-Ni interface towards redox kinetic acceleration. An assembled two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer using NiMoS as bifunctional catalysts can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low cell voltage of 1.53 V (1.50 V under 1 sun irradiation) with remarkable stability for over 100 h, demonstrating the robust overall water splitting with accessible solar integration.									74	2	0	0	5	0	73			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000521513300069

Herein, the assembly of TiO2 ultrathin nanosheets was fabricated from the titanate sheets using a gas-assisted liquid exfoliation method combined with hydrogenation treatment strategy. The hydrogenation treatment can introduce more surface point defects such as oxygen vacancies without damaging the ultrathin two-dimensional structure. The ultrathin two-dimensional assembly has high percentages of low-coordinated surface atoms and large specific surface areas (340 m(2)/g), which could increase the absorption of photon and accelerate the photocatalytic reaction process. Meanwhile, homogeneous oxygen vacancies and large fraction of low-coordinated surface atoms in TiO2 nanosheets can cause surface lattice distortion, which leads to a reduction in band gap and an upshift of conduction band minimum. The assembly possesses strong solar-light absorption, efficient charge transfer, and more surface reactive sites for photocatalytic reactions. As a result, the assembly exhibits fast photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 540.7 mu mol h(-1) (30 mg catalyst) and good cycling stability under simulated solar irradiation. This work may provide perspectives for designing two-dimensional semiconductor materials besides TiO2 ultrathin nanosheets as photocatalysts.									53	4	0	0	4	0	53			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000446283800034

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and MOF-based electrocatalysts have drawn considerable attention for the replacement of noble-metal electrocatalysts. Here, the rational design and synthesis of bimetallic CoNi-MOF nanosheets/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrid electrocatalysts is reported. The CoNi-MOF nanosheets were in situ grown onto rGO assisted by the surfactant modulation. The newly developed CoNi-MOF/rGO hybrids, consisting of homogeneously distributed nanosheets encapsulated by rGO, display excellent electrocatalytic activities toward OER and ORR. The much improved bifunctional catalytic performance is ascribed to the synergy among the CoNi-MOF nanosheets and rGO, the abundant exposed active sites, and the enhanced electron conductivity. Moreover, the rechargeable Zn-air batteries with CoNi-MOF/rGO-based air electrodes display high energy density and cycling stability, demonstrating the great potential as advanced bifunctional electrocatalysis in electronic devices.									74	11	0	0	1	0	76			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000466988800052	30964638

Herein, we report a facile strategy for crafting wrinkled MoS2/N-doped carbon core/shell nanospheres interfaced with single Fe atoms (denoted MoS2@Fe-N-C) as superior ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts for robust wearable ZABs with a high capacity and outstanding cycling stability. Specifically, the highly crumpled MoS2 nanosphere core is wrapped with a layer of single-Fe-atom-impregnated, N-doped carbon shell (i.e., Fe-N-C shell with well-dispersed FeN4 sites). Intriguingly, MoS2@Fe-N-C nanospheres manifest an ORR half-wave potential of 0.84 V and an OER overpotential of 360 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2). More importantly, density functional theory calculations reveal the lowered energy barriers for both ORR and OER, accounting for marked enhanced catalytic performance of MoS2@Fe-N-C nanospheres. Remarkably, wearable ZABs assembled by capitalizing on MoS2@Fe-N-C nanospheres as an air electrode with an ultralow area loading (i.e., 0.25 mg.cm(-2)) display excellent stability against deformation, high special capacity (i.e., 442 mAh.g(Zn)(-1)), excellent power density (i.e., 78 mW.cm(-2)) and attractive cycling stability (e.g., 50 cycles at current density of 5 mA.cm(-2)). This study provides a platform to rationally design single-atom-interfaced core/shell bifunctional electrocatalysts for efficient metal-air batteries.									38	0	0	0	3	0	38			0027-8424			WOS:000710708300006	34588309

However, the current use of expensive Pt-based electrocatalysts for ORR and IrO2 and RuO2 for OER is still a major drawback for the economic viability of these clean energy technologies. Thus, there is an incessant search for low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts (ECs). Hence, herein, we report the preparation, characterization (Raman, XPS, and SEM), and application of four composites based on doped-carbon materials (CM) and cobalt phosphotungstate (MWCNT_N8_Co4, GF_N8_Co4, GF_ND8_Co4, and GF_NS8_Co4) as ORR and OER electrocatalysts in alkaline medium (pH = 13). Structural characterization confirmed the successful carbon materials doping with N and/or N, S, and the incorporation of the cobalt phosphotungstate. Overall, all composites showed good ORR performance with onset potentials ranging from 0.83 to 0.85 V vs. RHE, excellent tolerance to methanol crossover with current retentions between 88 and 90%, and good stability after 20,000 s at E = 0.55 V vs. RHE (73% to 82% of initial current). In addition, the number of electrons transferred per O-2 molecule was close to four, suggesting selectivity to the direct process. Moreover, these composites also presented excellent OER performance with GF_N8_Co4 showing an overpotential of 0.34 V vs. RHE (for j = 10 mA cm(-2)) and j(max) close to 70 mA cm(-2). More importantly, this electrocatalyst outperformed state-of-the-art IrO2 electrocatalyst. Thus, this work represents a step forward toward bifunctional electrocatalysts using less expensive materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000786993500001

A notably low cell voltage of 1.6 and 1.84 V was required at 200 mA cm(-2) for urea and water electrolysis, respectively along with a remarkably stable performance for 4 days. Additionally, A 1.45-fold increase in H-2 production rate was observed for urea electrolysis [26.6 mu mol min(-1)] when compared with water electrolysis [18 mu mol min(-1)] decreasing the power consumption by 37 %. Real human urine electrolysis was conducted with excellent performance requiring a cell voltage of only 1.9 V at 200 mA cm(-2), attributed to the synergistic intermediate-active site interaction, improved charge transfer capability, and slow surface transformation-induced activation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000697232500001

Upon immobilization of the G/Co3O4 upon Screen-Printed macro-Electrodes (G/Co3O4-SPEs) the G/Co3O4-SPEs were found to exhibit remarkable electro-catalytic properties towards the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (OER). A detailed investigation has been carried out on the influence that the graphitization of the citric acid has, during the course of preparation of Co3O4, upon the ability of the G/Co3O4 to catalyse the OER within alkaline conditions (1.0 M KOH). The graphitization of citric acid ensures the uni-form distribution of Co3O4 and enhanced conductivity with maximal exposure of active sites, which are the key parameters to delivering enhanced electrochemical activity. The G/Co3O4-SPEs exhibits an overpotential of 304 mV (recorded at 10 mA cm(-2)), a Tafel slope of 110 mV dec(-1) and remain stable in its signal output (achievable current density) at varying temperatures (5-50 degrees C), and after 10 h of chronoamperometry in 1.0 M KOH. The G/Co3O4 SPE's OER activity was found to be superior to that of bulk and nano Co3O4. The results exhibited within this study will enable production of high-performance and environmentally benign electrocatalysts towards the OER for use within water splitting devices.

Compared with other transition metal oxides, CuO exhibits poor oxygen evolution reaction performance, leading to high Faraday efficiency for HMF oxidation. However, the weak adsorption and activation ability of CuO to OH- species restricts its further development. Herein, the CuO-PdO heterogeneous interface is successfully constructed, resulting in an advanced onset-potential of the HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR), a higher current density than CuO. The results of open-circuit potential, in situ infrared spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations indicate that the introduction of PdO enhances the adsorption capacity of the organic molecule. Meanwhile, the CuO-PdO heterogeneous interface promotes the adsorption and activation of OH- species, as demonstrated by zeta potential and electrochemical measurements. This work elucidates the adsorption enhancement mechanism of heterogeneous interfaces and provides constructive guidance for designing efficient multicomponent electrocatalysts in organic electrocatalytic reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000854896400001	36036562

J	Terwilliger, NB; Ryan, MC; Towle, D								Evolution of novel functions: cryptocyanin helps build new exoskeleton in Cancer magister								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				208	13			2467	2474		10.1242/jeb.01667				JUL 2005	2005	Hemocyanin, the blue blood protein of many arthropods and molluscs, reversibly binds oxygen at its highly conserved copper-oxygen-binding sites and supplies tissues with oxygen. Cryptocyanin, closely related structurally and phylogenetically to arthropod hemocyanin, lacks several of the six critical copper-binding histidines, however, and has lost the ability to bind oxygen. Despite this loss of function, cryptocyanin continues to be synthesized, an indication that it has been exploited to carry out new functions. Here, we show that cryptocyanin is present in extremely high concentrations in the hemolymph of the crab during the premolt portion of the molt cycle. Both proteins are specifically expressed in the same type of cell in the hepatopancreas and secreted into the hemolymph, but cryptocyanin plays a major role in forming the new exoskeleton, while hemocyanin functions in oxygen transport. A cessation in cryptocyanin, but not hemocyanin, synthesis after eyestalk ablation supports our hypothesis that cryptocyanin is closely regulated by molting hormones. The contrasts between the two gene products illustrate how a gene duplication of a copper-oxygen protein and its subsequent mutation may work in concert with the evolution of new regulatory mechanisms, leading to the assumption of new functions.									41	0	0	0	41	0	42			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000231055500010	15961732

Herein, we demonstrate a simple preparation of carbon-supported nanoporous Pd with surface coated Pt (CS-PdPt) by a simple galvanic replacement reaction (GRR). The phase purity and porosity have been confirmed by XRD, HRTEM, and N-2 sorption techniques. As HER electrocatalyst, CS-PdPt showed a low overpotential of 26 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is lower than the commercial Pt/C electrode. The CS-PdPt catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 46 mV in 1 M KOH, and 50 mV in neutral buffer (1 M PBS) at 10 mA cm(-2). The CS-PdPt furnished with small Tafel values of 33, 88, and 107 mV dec(-1) in acidic, alkaline, and neutral medium, respectively. Accelerated durability test at 100 mV s(-1) for 1000 cycles demonstrated a negligible change in HER activity. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, a poor catalytic activity has been theoretically predicted for the conventional metalloporphyrin-like catalytic moieties, symmetric Ni-N-4. This has led to extensive debate regarding the nature of the actual catalytic site. In this study, we prepare five MeNC catalysts (Me = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, or Ni) with predominant Me-N-4 moieties and measure their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities. A linear correlation is identified between the HER activity and the theoretically predicted hydrogen binding energy (HBE) of all the symmetric Me-N-4 models, except for Ni-N-4. Thus, various coordination structures are further considered as catalytic Ni sites. Based on the combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we conclude that coordinately unsaturated Ni sites can be present, which are responsible for the considerable electrocatalytic activity of the NiNC.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000863312700002

We report the synthesis of microporous iron-anchored cobalt phosphonate materials, i.e., FeCoPIm-6, FeCoPIm-12, FeCoPIm-24, and FeCoPIm-48, using iminodi(methylphosphonic acid) as a ligand, by varying the reaction time under hydrothermal condition and post-grafting synthetic pathway. The FeCoPIm-12 catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), acquiring low overpotentials of 117 and 249 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively, at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with outstanding long-term durability up to 100 h in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution. Also, the bifunctionalized electrocatalyst FeCoPIm-12 requires a cell voltage of 1.53 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting in an alkaline medium and displays long-term stability. The superior electrochemical performance of the FeCoPIm-12 catalyst over the as-synthesized catalyst is due to its higher surface area with microporous channel throughout the catalyst and the synergistic effect of the highly active metal oxyhydroxide (FeOOH and CoOOH) components on the pore wall.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000813031600001

The prepared Pt66Ni34 NFs exhibited enhanced catalytic properties towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both acidic and alkaline media. Specifically, the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of Pt66Ni34 NFs (43 mV, 33 mV dec(-1)) were similar to commercial Pt/C (20 wt%, 40 mV, 31 mV dec(-1)) in 0.5 M H2SO4. Moreover, Pt66Ni34 NFs displayed the smaller overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (50 mV) and Tafel slope (57 mV dec(-1)) as compared with Pt/C (63 mV, 69 mV dec(-1)) in 0.5 M KOH. And the catalyst exhibited superior durability for HER relative to Pt/C in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes.

The built graphene/nanotube networks show highly accessible 3D open aisles and peculiar microstructures, which not only facilitated mass and electron transport but also increased the active site density. In alkaline solution, the prepared NiCo@N-C-900 exhibits a positive half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.88 V for the oxygen reduction reaction and a low overpotential (E-eta) of 0.28 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction, superior to the benchmark Pt/C (E-1/2 = 0.84 V) and IrO2 (E-eta = 0.32 V) catalysts as well as the best Ni-Co electrocatalysts reported in the literature (E-1/2 = 0.87 V, E-eta = 0.31 V). In acidic solution, the activity of the ORR on NiCo@N-C-900 is comparative to that on Pt/C and significantly higher than that of all reported Ni-Co electrocatalysts. The primary zinc-air batteries using NiCo@N-C-900 as the advanced air electrode exhibited higher open-circuit potentials (OCPs), peak power density and rechargeability than the Pt/C-based counterpart.

The synthesized N-rich (4.7%) carbon materials are employed as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and exhibit incredible catalytic performance as well as promising electrochemical durability, which are mainly attributed to the large amount of exposed active sites, high graphitization degree and the rich nitrogen elements, especially pyridine-N and graphitic-N. Typically, the silk-derived nanosheets carbon fibers activated by KCI afford a low onset potential of -63 mV (vs. RHE), a low overpotential of 137 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 132 mV dec(-1).

The high activity of amorphous materials and the great stability as well as the good conductivity of crystalline materials were successfully integrated. The nickel cobalt phosphate was recognized as the active component, while the nickel phosphide was of crucial importance and showed a substrate enhancement effect on the elevated catalytic activity, including the amplification of active surface area and constructing a channel between the electrode and the active sites. Notably, the nanohybrid system can drive the cathodic/anodic current density to be 10 mA cm(-2) with the overpotentials of only 73 mV in HER test and 234 mV in OER test, which outperformed most of the cobalt-based nanocatalysts so far.

It is impossible to decrease the CO2 emissions by suppression of the economic activity. Global CO2 recycling can solve this problem. The global CO2 recycling consists of three district: The electricity is generated by solar cells on deserts. At desert coasts, the electricity is used for H-2 production by seawater electrolysis and H-2 is used for CH4 production by the reaction with CO2 CH4 which is the main component of liquefied natural gas is liquefied and transported to energy consuming districts where CO2 is recovered, liquefied and transported to the desert coasts. A CO2 recycling plant for substantiation of our idea has been built on the roof of the Institute for Materials Research in 1996. Key materials necessary for the global CO2 recycling are the anode and cathode for seawater electrolysis and the catalyst for CO2 conversion. All or them have been tailored by us. They have very high activity and selectivity for necessary reactions in addition to excellent durability.

Such a MnO2-NWRs/CNTs 350 material is induced by the strong coupling and synergistic effect between MnO2-NWRs and CNTs, as well as the coexistence of NRs/NWs and the existence of favorable crystal planes, which enable the multifunctional high-performance in zinc-air batteries (ZABs), magnesium-air batteries (MABs), SCs and also their flexible devices. The MnO2-NWRs/CNTs 350 catalyst exhibits high electrochemical activity (SE: 0.98 V), decent capacitance (1183 F g(-1)) and excellent battery performance (specifically, 640 mW cm(-2) for MABs). In MnO2-NWRs/CNTs 350, the (110) and (101) crystal planes of MnO2 NWRs are advantageous for both ORR and OER processes. Additionally, the structural changes of MnO2-NWRs/CNTs 350 (the coexistent NRs and NWs) improve the capacitance of the material. Even more encouraging, the interweaving structure endows the flexible rechargeable MABs, ZABs, and SCs with excellent electrochemical performance in terms of both activity and stability.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000523640000023

Herein, non-precious NiCoP-based cocatalysts were synthesized by a facile solid-state phosphorization reaction, and coupled with metal-free graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) for photocatalytic reactions. It was revealed that NiCoP-based nanoparticles exhibited a core/shell structure, where the NiCoP core was surrounded by amorphous-like nickel cobalt phosphate (NiCo-Pi) shell. The detailed spectroscopic and electrochemical studies demonstrated that NiCoP cores behaved as the active sites for the photocatalytic reductive half-reaction, and NiCo-Pi shells could serve as the active sites for the photocatalytic oxidative half-reaction. As a consequence, the improved surface reaction rate through the bifunctional NiCoP-based cocatalyst, as well as the enhanced charge separation efficiency, cooperatively boosted the separate photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen generation in the presence of appropriate sacrificial reagents. The apparent quantum efficiency for hydrogen generation over the NiCoP@NiCo-Pi/g-C3N4 photocatalyst can reach 9.4% at 420 nm, which is one of the best values for noble-metal-free g-C3N4-based photocatalysts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the NiCoP-based cocatalyst to promote both photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen generation, which is expected to pave a new way to exploit efficient bifunctional cocatalysts for overall water splitting.									127	14	0	0	12	0	131			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000411232100012

The results showed that the nature of the precursor influenced the roughness factor as well as the electrocatalytic activity of the oxide films for O-2-evolution greatly. The ratio of molar concentrations of precursors (i.e. x = [CoSO4]/[LiOH]) also strongly influenced the electrocatalytic properties of the catalyst. The electrocatalytic activity in 1 M KOH was observed to be maximum for the catalytic film obtained at 0.67 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 1.33. The Tafel slope and the reaction order found on the active catalytic films were 50-56 mV decade(-1) and 1.1-1.5, respectively. The activation energy of the reaction was observed to be approximately constant (47.8 +/- 0.6 kJ mol(-1)) at low potentials (0.58 and 0.60 V) only. This electrode has shown a good performance up to the observed current density of 1.0 A cm(-2) in 30 wt% KOH even at 70degreesC. (C) 2002 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

Although it is agreed that the implementation of high activity, the co-existence of Ni and Fe is essential, the identification of active sites and the mechanism of water splitting in NiFe-based compounds have long been controversial. This review focuses on the catalytic centers of NiFe-based oxides/(oxy)hydroxides and related mechanism in alkaline water oxidation process from the perspective of thermodynamics and kinetics. Furthermore, NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) are introduced separately, emphasizing the necessity of LDH phase formation during water splitting. The review highlights the roles of Fe3+ and the third transition metal Co in NiFe-based catalysts. Finally, a brief perspective on NiFe-based catalysts is proposed. This review will be a good complement to the existing literatures and will contribute to a better study of NiFe-based catalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, a novel catalyst, cobalt iron carbide nanoparticles encapsulated by nitrogen doped graphene nanosheets, is successfully synthesized through a simple refluxing strategy followed by a post annealing process. It is found that the catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline medium. The oxygen reduction reaction kinetics of the catalyst mainly follow a 4-electron transferred pathway along with good diffusion limit current density, highly positive onset potential (-0.04 V) and half-wave potential (-0.11 V). In addition to catalytic activity, the catalyst demonstrates advanced superior stability, and excellent methanol tolerance in comparison with commercial platinum catalyst. The impressive catalytic performance of the catalyst is attributed to the unique mesoporous metal-core/graphene-shell architecture in which high interactions between two transition metals and transition metal-carbon synergistically provide enhanced catalytically active sites, accelerate interfacial charge transfer, and optimize oxygen adsorption energy. The results demonstrate that such catalyst can be an alternative low-cost and efficient catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction in energy conversion applications. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Structural characterization, including TEM, HAADF-STEM, SEM, and XPS indicated that the NSGA catalyst exhibits an interconnected macroporous framework of graphene sheets and tunable contents of N and S. The as-prepared NSGAs show an excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction, including a highly positive onset potential, high kinetic limiting current density, and fuel tolerance.

Uniform Co distribution and the modulation of Zn, and their catalytic properties are carefully investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The surface contents of pyridinic N for the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) and the surface contents of Co-N-x and high valence Co for the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) can be significantly modulated by Zn content in precursors and the sintering temperature. Furthermore, the catalyst also contains high specific surface areas, high porosity, and high electrochemical active surfaces. Therefore, the ZnCo-NC based catalyst exhibits outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for ORR with a high E-onset (1.02 V) and E-1/2 (0.91 V) and OER with low E-j=10 (1.56 V), better than Pt/C and RuO2. Importantly, the ZnCo-NC based Zn-H2O2 batteries achieve the superior power density of 442 mW cm(-2), much higher than 238 and 198 mW cm(-2) of Zn-air batteries with ZnCo-NC based catalyst and Pt/C respectively. More importantly, the high-power Zn-H2O2 batteries can work well in underwater conditions while Zn-air batteries are out of work.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000747307700001	35084096

Herein, six late-transition metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, and Pt) anchored on gamma-GY and graphitic N doped gamma-GY substrates are screened as electrocatalysts for the OER and ORR via density functional theory, and the effects of electronic regulation due to the presence of graphitic N on the thermodynamics and kinetics of electrocatalysis are investigated in detail. Among the six gamma-GY@TM candidates, only gamma-GY@Rh exhibits excellent OER activity, with an overpotential of 0.42 V. Furthermore, graphitic N doped graN-gamma-GY@Rh shows outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic activity, with overpotentials of 0.27 V for the OER and 0.33 V for the ORR, which are remarkably superior to the values of 0.43 V for RuO2 and 0.45 V for noble-metal Pt electrocatalysts. The present results present some of the lowest overpotentials for OER/ORR electrocatalysts given by theoretical studies to date. From a kinetics point of view, N-doping also remarkably reduces the activation energy barriers of the catalytic rate-limiting steps of the OER and ORR, accelerating the reaction processes and significantly improving the conductivity. Our work provides a theoretical strategy for designing high-efficiency bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalysts based on gamma-GY materials.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000632611200014	33710226

BaTaO2N (BTON) is a promising 600 nm-class photocatalyst because of its absorption of visible light up to 660 nm, small band gap (E-g = 1.9 eV), appropriate valence band-edge position for oxygen evolution, good stability under light irradiation in concentrated alkaline solutions, and nontoxicity. Although the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water-splitting efficiencies of BaTaO2N have been progressively improved, it is still far from the requirements set for practical applications. Here, we employ a 5% B site-selective doping of aliovalent metal cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Mg2+, and Zr4+) to enhance sacrificial visible light-induced photocatalytic H-2 and O-2 evolution over BaTaO2N. The results of physicochemical characterizations reveal that no significant change in crystal structure, crystal morphology, and optical absorption edge is observed upon cation doping. Therefore, the difference observed in O-2 and H-2 evolution during the photocatalytic reactions over pristine and doped BaTaO2N photocatalysts is explained by examining optical, electronic, and surface properties. Also, molecular dynamics (MD) is used to gain insights into the respective effect of cation doping on adsorption energy of water molecules and formed intermediates (H* for H-2 evolution and HO*, O*, and HOO* for O-2 evolution) on the BaTaO2N surfaces terminated with TaO6, TaN6, and TaO4N2 octahedra. Finally, the experimental reaction rates for H-2 and O-2 evolution are correlated well using a linear energy-performance relationship, elucidating the doping and surface-termination trends observed in the BaTaO2N photocatalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000743212300001

Through XRD, H-2-TPR, and pyridine adsorption followed by FTIR spectroscopy, the reducibility and Lewis acidity of the catalysts are assessed. In-situ FTIR spectroscopy is used to monitor the methane activation on catalyst surfaces. Complex IR features of methane-derived surface species are observed and are attributed to the formation of surface alkyl/alkoxy, aldehyde, formate/carbonate, and aromatic species. A data analysis algorithm is developed to evaluate the evolution of different surface species over time. The formation of formate and carbonate species is driven by adsorbed surface oxygen, while less reactive oxygen species associated with NiO allow for the production of aromatics and alkoxy intermediates. By tuning the reducibility and Lewis acidity of the catalyst, the selectivity to alkoxy intermediates can be improved. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Though metal-free catalysts have been reported a lot, fewer catalysts show high activity toward ORR and OER, especially for biomass waste materials. This paper introduces a top-down strategy to fabricate a series of bifunctional metal-free catalysts derived from the plant residue. Among them, the catalyst BRC(AC)850(2) shows an excellent electrocatalytic performance toward both ORR and OER (E-1/2 = 0.85 V, E-i=10 = 1.68 V vs RHE). A zinc-air battery equipped by catalyst BRC(AC)850(2) even displays a superior performance to that of Pt/C-RuO2. The excellent ORR and OER performances are mainly attributed to 3D hierarchical structures and rich active sites of the catalyst, including N functional groups, oxygen vacancies, and carbon defects. The strategy of preparing plant residues into the outstanding bifunctional catalyst demonstrated in this study may enlighten to the design of various other functional catalysts.									41	2	0	0	4	0	41			2168-0485			WOS:000492117200014

The development of high-activity cheap electrocatalysts toward GOR yet faces a daunting challenge. Herein, we experimentally prepare a new range of high entropy alloy (HEA) self-supported electrodes with uniform HEA nanoparticles grown on carbon cloth. The systematic electrochemical studies verify that the HEA-CoNiCuMnMo electrode exhibits attractive performance for GOR electrocatalysis with low overpotential and high selectivity toward formate products. The surface atomic configurations of HEA-CoNiCuMnMo are studied by a self-developed machine learning-based Monte Carlo simulation, which points out the catalytic active center to be Mo sites coordinated by Mn, Mo, and Ni. We further develop a hybrid alkali/acid flow electrolytic cell by pairing alkaline GOR with acidic hydrogen evolution reaction using the HEA-CoNiCuMnMo and the commercial RhIr/Ti as the anode and the cathode, respectively, which only requires an applied voltage of 0.55 V to reach an electrolytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and maintains long-term electrolysis stability over 12 days continuous running at 50 mA cm(-2) with Faraday efficiencies of over 99% for H-2 in the cathode and 92% for formate production in the anode.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000799141600025	35404594

However, their poor electronic conductivity, small surface area, and sluggish activity seriously hinder their catalytic performance. Herein, S-modulated FeNi nanoalloys supported by hierarchically porous carbon (S-FeNi/PC) are synthesized through the thermal treatment of metal-organic precursors for efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysis. S decoration endows S-FeNi/PC with a superior OER performance while maintaining an ORR performance that is comparable to that of Pt/C. Hence, S-FeNi/PC exhibits excellent bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity, outperforming the noble-metal-based composite catalysts of Pt/C and RuO2. Notably, the ZABs assembled with S-FeNi/PC exhibit high specific capacity (792 mA h g(-1)), high peak power density (123.5 mW cm(-2)), and remarkable durability for 700 charge/discharge cycles at 10 mA cm(-2), which surpasses the performance of commercially available Pt/C-RuO2 and other catalysts in previously reported studies. This study will provide not only new bifunctional oxygen electrodes for efficient ZAB devices but also new insights into the design of FeNi-based materials for a wide range of catalytic applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000815449600002

Herein, it is discovered that organic small molecule (hexabromobenzene, HBB) can activate commercial transition metal (Ni, Fe, and NiFe) foam by directly evolving metal nanomeshes embedded in graphene-like films (M-NM@G) through a facile Br-induced solid-phase migration process. Systematic investigations indicate that HBB can conformally generate graphene-like network on bulk metal foam substrate via the cleavage of C-Br bonds and the formation of C(sic)C linkage. Simultaneously, the cleaved C-Br fragments can efficiently extract metal atoms from bulk substrate, in situ producing transition metal nanomeshes embedded in the graphene-like films. As a result, such functional nanostructure can serve as an efficient OER electrocatalyst with a low overpotential and excellent long-term stability. Specifically, the overpotential at 100 mA cm(-2) is only 208 mV for NiFe-NM@G, ranking the top-tier OER electrocatalysts. This work demonstrates an intriguing general strategy for directly transforming bulk transition metals into nanostructured functional electrocatalysts via the interaction with organic small molecules, opening up opportunities for bridging the application of organic small molecules in energy technologies.									38	2	0	0	0	0	38			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000511237100001	32027058

Owing to their favorable structures and desirable bi-functional oxygen reduction and evolution activities, the resulting MFe2O4/CNT (M = Co, Ni) composites as electrocatalysts for the cathodes deliver better electrochemical performance during the discharge and charge processes compared with that of the pure carbon of ketjen black (KB). The good performance can be attributed to the excellent catalytic activity of highly dispersed MFe2O4 (M = Co, Ni) nanoparticles and facile electron transport by supporting CNTs. This preliminary result manifests that the ternary spinel MFe2O4/CNT (M = Co, Ni) composites are promising cathode electrocatalysts for nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries.									55	6	0	0	2	0	59			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000337856900043

The defect changes the switching domination between electron transport and oxygen-vacancy migration.

Here, surface limited redox replacement (SLRR) is used to provide precise layer-by-layer growth of Pt monolayers on graphene. We find that after a few iterations of SLRR, fully wetted 4-5 monolayer Pt films can be grown on graphene. Incorporating graphene at the Pt-Au interface modifies the growth mechanism, charge transfers, equilibrium interatomic distances, and associated strain of the synthesized Pt monolayers. We find that a single layer of sandwiched graphene is able to induce a 3.5% compressive strain on the Pt adlayer grown on it, and as a result, catalytic activity is increased due to a greater areal density of the Pt layers beyond face-centered-cubic close packing. At the same time, the sandwiched,graphene does not obstruct vicinity effects of near-surface electron exchange between the substrate Au and adlayers Pt. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and extended Xray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) techniques are used to examine charge mediation across the,Pt-graphene-Au junction and the local atomic arrangement as a function of the Pt adlayer dimension. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are used as probes to examine the electrochemically active area of Pt monolayers and catalyst activity, respectively. Results show that the inserted graphene monolayer results in increased activity for the Pt due to a graphene-induced,compressive strain) as well as a higher resistance against loss of the catalytically active Pt surface.									33	0	0	0	1	0	33			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000351972400023	25730297

Herein, we report an efficient and durable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst Ru-MC (mesoporous carbon) synthesized by a special method, in which Ru3+ is added after the formation of spherical MC, leading to only a small amount of Ru being embedded and the vast majority being evenly distributed on the MC surface. The dispersed Ru nanoparticles not only prevent them from aggregation to greatly improve their stability (both over 160 hours in acidic and alkaline solutions), but also provide outstanding intrinsic catalytic activity because oxygen regulates the electronic structure of Ru nanoparticles. The as-synthesized catalyst only needs an overpotential of 27 and 40 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4. The present work provides guidance for the design of efficient and stable Ru-based HER electrocatalysts used in a wide pH range.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000747395000020

The above conditions were the most favorable for O-2/H-2-evolution under which the PPy and/or the nano-Ni constituents were not degraded. The industry benchmark catalyst, bare Pt, generated 0.15 mA/cm(2) for O-2-evolution and 2.2 mA/cm(2) for H-2-evolution under the above conditions. However, when the Pt was coated with PPy containing nano-Ni, and rGO in optimum molar ratios, it generated catalytic current densities that were 670 % larger for O-2-generation (0.97-1.0 mA/cm(2), including a photocurrent of 0.48 mA/cm(2)) and 18 % larger for H-2-generation (2.38-2.60 mA/cm(2), including a photocurrent of 0.20-0.40 mA/cm(2)), over periods of up to 50 h. EIS and Tafel plots indicated that these remarkable synergic amplifications derived from the combination of a high density of catalytic sites with the least-resistive conduction pathways, on average, within the coating. As catalytic accelerations of this type have previously only been observed with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), these results indicate that the principles of synergistic amplification also apply to other conducting polymer supports.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2468-8231			WOS:000541664600011

Here, we highlight the key achievements in the development of new materials for efficient hydrogen and oxygen production in electrolysers and, in reverse, their use in fuel cells. A key issue addressed here is the degree to which the fundamental understanding of the synergy between covalent and non-covalent interactions can form the basis for any predictive ability in tailor-making real-world catalysts. Common descriptors such as the substrate-hydroxide binding energy and the interactions in the double layer between hydroxide-oxides and H---OH are found to control individual parts of the hydrogen and oxygen electrochemistry that govern the efficiency of water-based energy conversion and storage systems. Links between aqueous- and organic-based environments are also established, encouraging the 'fuel cell' and 'battery' communities to move forward together.									1073	43	0	0	66	1	1079			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000391343300014	27994237

Iodanil, bromanil and chloranil but not fluoranil induced a rapid oxidation of Q(A)(-) and doubled the area over the fluorescence induction curve, indicating dark oxidation of Q(400). Analyses of these two THBQ-induced reactions and inhibition of the accelerated Q(A)(-) oxidation by DCMU yielded binding constants of the quinones comparable to those determined from measurements of oxygen evolution. Generally, THBQs bound tightly to the Q(B) site. However, the binding affinity varied in a wide range with THBQs. The Q(B) site bound iodanil with an extremely high affinity but fluoranil relatively weakly. The hydroquinone forms of the THBQs also bound to the Q(B) site and inhibited Q(A)(-) oxidation by Q(B). The concentrations of the hydroquinones required for 50% inhibition of Q(A)(-) oxidation suggest that the Q(B) site binds the hydroquinones more weakly than the corresponding quinones except for fluoranil, which binds to the Q(B) site more tightly in its reduced form than in oxidized one. The abilities of THBQs to function as electron accepters or inhibitors of oxygen evolution, and as oxidants of Q(400) in the dark, are discussed in relation to the binding affinities of the quinones to the Q(B) site.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0032-0781			WOS:A1994NH73600016

Given a large amount of energy consumed in Cu EW process, anodes with controlled oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and a lower OER overpotential are advantageous for reducing the energy consumption. To date, magnesium (Mg) has never been studied as an alloying element for EW anodes. As-cast PbCaSn anodes with the addition of Mg were examined herein, revealing an improved performance compared to that of the industrial standard PbCaSn anode. The alloy performances in the early stages of anode life and passivation were established from electrochemical studies which were designed to simulate industrial Cu EW process. The 24-hour polarization testing revealed that the Mg alloying depolarizes the anode potential up to 80 mV; thus, resulting in a higher Cu EW efficiency. In addition, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the alteration of the alloy microstructure and the corresponding interfacial reactions contribute to the changes of the anode electrochemical performances. The present study reveals for the first time the potency of Mg alloying in reducing the overpotential of PbCaSn anode.

The morphology of prepared oxide was examined by scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical propel-ties of the prepared Ti/RuO2 anodes, involving their cyclic voltammetric behavior in H2SO4 and NaCl solutions, activity in the chlorine and oxygen evolution reaction, impedance behavior in H2SO4, and stability during electrolysis in dilute chloride solutions, were investigated. The performances of the anodes are compared to those of a Ti/RuO2 anode prepared by the sol-gel procedure from an oxide sol obtained by the forced hydrolysis of ruthenium chloride in acid solution. The anodes prepared via the alkoxide route showed a higher capacitance and activity for the chlorine evolution reaction than the anode prepared by the inorganic sol-gel procedure. The results of the stability test showed that the utilization of the coating active material is better when the anodes were prepared via the alkoxide route than via the inorganic sol-gel procedure, particularly for anodes with a smaller mass of coating. The different rates of loss of activity indicate a degradation mechanism for the anodes prepared via the alkoxide route in which electrochemical dissolution of RuO2 from the coating surface prevails over the growth of an insulating TiO2 layer in the coating/Ti substrate interphase. The effect of RuO2 dissolution from the coating surface increases with increasing coating mass.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0352-5139			WOS:000243619400006

Our earlier work has demonstrated the various features of the early UCG cavity shape and rate of growth through lab-scale experiments on coal combustion, wherein the feed gas is oxygen. In this paper, we study the feasibility of in situ gasification of coal in a similar laboratory scale reactor set-up, under conditions relevant for field practice of UCG, using an oxygen-steam mixture as the feed gas. By performing the gasification reaction in a cyclic manner, we have been able to obtain a product gas with hydrogen concentrations as high as 39% and a calorific value of 178 kJ/mol. The effect of various operating parameters such as feed temperature, feed steam to oxygen ratio, initial combustion time and so on, on the product gas composition is studied and the optimum operating conditions in order to achieve desired conversion to syngas, are determined. We also study the effect of various design and operating parameters on the evolution of the gasification cavity. Empirical correlations are proposed for the change in cavity volume and its dimensions in various directions. The results of the previous study on the combustion cavity evolution are compared with this gasification study. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, Jinhu; Li, Zenghua; Yang, Yongliang; Niu, Junhao; Meng, Qingxia								Room temperature oxidation of active sites in coal under multi-factor conditions and corresponding reaction mechanism								FUEL				256						115901	10.1016/j.fuel.2019.115901				NOV 15 2019	2019	The thermal decomposition of oxygen-containing functional groups can produce active sites that accelerate coal spontaneous combustion. To investigate the room temperature oxidation of the active sites in coal by varying multiple experimental conditions (e.g., pyrolysis temperature, pyrolysis duration, oxygen concentration, and pyrolysis-oxidation times), pyrolysis-room temperature oxidation experiments and corresponding infrared spectroscopy experiments were carried out. First, by analysing the evolution of gas generation and the coal core temperature as a function of time during the room temperature oxidation of coal samples, it is found that the active sites oxidize more intensely under the conditions of higher the pyrolysis temperature, longer the pyrolysis duration and higher oxygen concentration. Then, the continuous pyrolysis-room temperature oxidation experiment and the changes in the chemical structure prove that the oxygen-containing functional groups can be converted into the active sites and vice versa. In addition, the concentration of the gaseous products evolved in each room temperature experiment shows that the amount of CO2 produced is higher than that of CO, and the molar ratio of CO2 to CO is approximately 3.3:1, which was found by using a statistical method and indicated that the two gas products are derived from different reaction pathways of the identical substance. Finally, a possible microscopic reaction mechanism of the room temperature oxidation of the active sites is proposed. The research results are of great value not only for revealing the coal spontaneous combustion mechanism, but also for preventing the spontaneous combustion of heat-invaded coal in the subsequent mining process.									36	1	0	0	2	0	37			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000482184800081

The polymerizations can be conducted in aqueous medium or using organic/water mixtures as solvent, with low concentration of copper, near room temperature. In the absence of any external deoxygenation, several well-defined homopolymers and block copolymers were obtained (<SIC> < 1.3). The evolution of the oxygen concentration during the polymerizations was monitored with an optical oxygen sensor. The consumption of oxygen prior polymerization in ethanol/water mixtures was attributed to the combined presence of Na2S2O4 and alkyl halide initiator, which led to a lower initiation efficiency (I-eff). This could be overcome by decreasing the headspace volume of the reaction. The system reported exhibited the potential to be scalable, which is very relevant from an industrial standpoint.

In this work, we synthesize a flexible air electrode consisting of 3D nanoporous N-doped graphene with trimodal shells and Ni particles through repeated chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and acidic etching processes. Our results indicate that such trimodal graphene morphology significantly enhances the active N-dopant sites and graphene-coated Ni surface, which consequentially boosts both the ORR and OER activities, as well as catalytic durability. First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the synergetic effects between the Ni and the N-doped graphene; namely, the Ni nanoparticles boost the bifunctional activities of the coated N-doped graphene, and in turn the graphene-covering layers enhance the stability of Ni. Thanks to the better protection from the triple graphene shells, our trimodal N-doped graphene/Ni-based Zn-air battery can be stably discharged/recharged beyond 2500 h with low overpotentials. It is reasonable to expect that such freestanding trimodal graphene/Ni would be promising in many flexible energy conversion/storage devices.

XRD and XPS results verified that the prepared Fe2Cu5Ni mainly consisted of Fe2O3, metallic Cu and Ni with a small amount of CuO and NiO. When the depositing time was 90 s, the current was 50 mA and the Fe/Cu molar ratio was 2: 5, the catalyst Fe2Cu5Ni had the best catalytic activity with a smaller overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a lower Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1) as well as an excellent stability. The improved performance could be due to the excellent eletrocatalytic activity from the three metal oxides, the good electronic conductivity from metallic Cu and Ni, the 3D porous structure of Ni foam and the flower-like nanosheets of Fe2O3 or Cu. In conclusion, this work reveals that Fe2Cu5Ni could be an efficient catalyst for electrochemical water splitting devices blessed with its simple preparation, low cost, high catalytic performance and stability.

In the fuel reactor of in situ gasification CLC (iG-CLC), the pyrolysis and gasification products of coal are oxidized by lattice oxygen in the O-2-free environment. Therefore, the characteristics of sulfur species evolution and distribution in the coal pyrolysis products are significantly different from those in the conventional combustion, gasification, and pyrolysis processes. In this study, a two-stage fluidized bed reactor was utilized to investigate the reaction between the oxygen carrier and in situ coal pyrolysis products, in which the coal and oxygen carrier particles are separately loaded in two reactors. In this way, the influence of oxygen carrier on the coal pyrolysis process could be eliminated. As obtained from the experiment, the distribution of sulfur species in coal pyrolysis products changed significantly after being oxidized by the oxygen carrier. To be more specific, the sulfur species were 70.1% H2S, 0.2% SO2, 0.8% COS, and 13.1% CS2, respectively, during the coal pyrolysis process in the blank experiment loaded with silica sand, whereas the concentrations of the sulfur species (in the same order) changed to 26.0%, 68.2%, 0%, and 0%, respectively, once the pyrolysis products went through the Fe2O3/Al2O3 oxygen carrier. The result indicates that most of the H2S, COS, and CS2 contents could be oxidized by the oxygen carrier to generate SO2 in the CLC environment. The sulfurous gas conversion rate at the CLC experiment was higher than that at blank experiment due to the fast evolution of sulfur in tar, which was also converted by oxygen carrier to enhance the sulfur conversion at the CLC experiment. Most of the H2S could be oxidized by the oxygen carrier to generate SO2 via the reaction H2S(g) + 9Fe(2)O(3) = 6Fe(3)O(4) + H2O(g) + SO2(g), and this has been confirmed by both experiment and HSC simulation. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy results indicated that no metallic sulfide was formed on the surface of reduced oxygen carrier.					6th Sino-Australian Symposium on Advanced Coal and Biomass Utilisation Technologies6th Sino-Australian Symposium on Advanced Coal and Biomass Utilisation Technologies	DEC 04-08, 2017DEC 04-08, 2017		Perth, AUSTRALIAPerth, AUSTRALIA	28	4	0	0	5	0	31			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000430783300045

The V2O3 was firstly reduced at 873 K in Ar atmosphere via magnesiothermic reduction reaction to get the mixture of V and MgO, and then the products were further nitrided at 1473 K in N-2 atmosphere. Finally, the as-prepared samples were acid-leached to obtain pure VN powders. X-ray diffractometry and field-emission scanning electron microscopy were used to analyze the phase transition and morphological evolution of the samples. The results reveal that the overall morphology of the obtained VN powder retains the morphology of the initial V2O3 powders. After removing MgO by acidic leaching, the porous VN particles can be obtained, with the oxygen content of 0.178 wt.%. Compared with the traditional methods, high purity VN powders with a small amount of oxygen and no carbon can be obtained.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000486409400022

It is a challenge to develop earth-abundant electrodes with high current density at a low potential. Here, we developed a novel strategy for synthesizing sulfur-doped copper phosphorus nanorods (Cu3P vertical bar S NR) for efficient HER catalysis in acidic water electrolyzers. Cu3P vertical bar S exhibits better activity than both Cu2S and Cu3P. The as-prepared electrocatalyst requires an overpotential of 223 mV to achieve a benchmark of 10 mA cm(-2) and has a very large exchange current density and high turnover frequency (TOF) in acid media.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2053-1591			WOS:000463213200001

Herein, we developed a facile route for large-scale crafting of ultrafine Ru nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on the ketonic C=O groups of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (9.6 g in one batch). From both experimental results and theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that C=O (rather than C-O) groups can be exploited to engineer the heterointerface of CNTs and Ru NPs. In fact, the electronic structure of Ru becomes considerably improved because the high polarity of C=O facilitates the interface electron transfer of Ru/CNTs. Consequently, the obtained Ru-O-CNTs hybrids with low Ru loading of 1.5 wt% display a small overpotential of 25 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and with fast kinetics as deduced from a small Tafel slope of 20.4 mV dec(-1) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M KOH. Impressively, at 70 mV overpotential, the hybrids exhibit a record mass activity of 20.4 mA mu g(Ru)(-1) , which is more than 50-fold of that for commercial Pt/C. Therefore, for the first time, we identified the vital role of C=O groups for engineering metal/carbon heterointerfaces towards robust and efficient electrocatalysis.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000564113100009

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have shown great potential in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, with unique geometric and electronic structures that help to boost mass and charge transfer during photocatalytic processes. Herein, recent advances of SACs in photocatalytic water splitting are focused upon. To decrease aggregation and realize sufficient utilization of metal atoms, different synthesis strategies for SACs are documented. For photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, the catalytic performances, active sites, and structure-property relationships of SACs including Al, Co, Ni, Pd, Ag, and Pt single sites are highlighted.

The carbon nitride aerogel can catalyze hydrogen evolution at a rate of nearly 4.2 mmol h(-1) g(-1) and oxidize benzyl alcohols with a high conversion efficiency and selectivity under milder conditions. Note that the activity of carbon nitride aerogel for photochemical alcohol oxidation shows outstanding performance compared with carbon nitride based photocatalysts. Both density functional theory and experimental results demonstrate that the introduction of nitrogen vacancies within the carbon nitride aerogel contributes to the formation of a crooked structure and enhanced adsorption of oxygen compared with a bulk sample.									18	2	0	0	0	0	18			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000488322900037	31476855

However, the rational design of electrocatalysts with suitably high efficiencies and stabilities in strongly acidic electrolytes remains a significant challenge. Here, we show the demonstration of sub-10 nm, composition-tunable Rh-Ir alloy nanoparticles (NPs) prepared using a scalable microwave-assisted method as superior acidic OER catalysts. The OER activities showed a volcano-shaped dependence on Ir composition, with Ir-rich NPs (Ir >= 51%) achieving better OER performance than pure Ir NPs, as reflected by lower overpotentials and higher mass activities. Most significantly, Rh22Ir78 NPs achieved a maximum mass activity of 1.17 A mg(Ir)(-1) at a 300 mV overpotential in 0.5 M H2SO4, which corresponds to a 3-fold enhancement relative to pure Ir NPs, making it one of the most active reported OER catalysts under acidic conditions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that owing to the synergy of ensemble and electronic effects by alloying a small amount of Rh with Ir, the binding energy difference of the O and OOH intermediates is reduced, leading to faster kinetics and enhanced OER activity. Furthermore, Rh-Ir alloy NPs demonstrated excellent durability in strongly acidic electrolyte. This work not only provides fundamental understandings relating to composition-electrochemical performance relationships but also represents the rational design of highly efficient OER electrocatalysts for applications in acidic media.									71	1	0	0	6	0	72			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000500650000095	31668069

However, most of them show low current density, low mass activity and unsatisfactory stability under strong acidic and oxidative conditions. Herein, an indium-induced-synthesis InxRuyO2 nanoribbon electrocatalyst (named In0.17Ru0.83O2-350) was prepared, which achieves an overpotential of 177 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 mol L-1 sulfuric acid. The mass activity is up to 1094.90 A g(Ru)(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV, which is among the highest for ruthenium dioxide-based catalysts. Moreover, the catalyst displays a current density up to 400 mA cm(-2), which is the highest current density in a small electrode system reported so far. It is found that indium doping can shift down the d-band center of Ru and reduce its work function, which can boost the electron transfer capacity between the catalyst surface and the reactants. Finite-element method simulations further demonstrate that the nanoribbon structure can not only expose more active sites to improve the mass activity of ruthenium and reaction current density, but also enhance the surface electric field intensity to boost the adsorption capacity of water molecules and the capacity of electron transfer, thereby accelerating the dynamics of OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000746593100001

The oxidized species have been fabricated directly over glassy carbon and nickel substrates in a single step with the concomitant formation of a poly-glycerol porous structure integrating the metallic oxides. Remarkably, the resulting composite (polymer + oxides) can be exploited as a multifunctional heterogeneous catalyst. On one hand, our composite material is an excellent and readily preparable electrode for the non-enzymatic amperometric detection and quantification of glucose. On the other hand, the composites reported herein are also efficient catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions, displaying their maximum activity after the dissolution of the polymer and subsequent liberation of the oxidized cobalt species.

Herein, a tellurium nanowire (NW)-derived ternary TePtFe nanotube (NT) electrocatalyst has been prepared by the Kirkendall effect. The TePtFe NT formed consists of small single-crystal nanoparticles and voids with an open-end and hollow structure. The TePtFe NT electrocatalyst presents an impressive catalytic activity and stability for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Its ORR specific activity and mass activity are 8.5 and 2.4 times, respectively, improved relative to those of commercial platinum catalysts. It is also impressive that, for the HER, a very low overpotential of 28.1 mV at 10 mAcm(-2) can be achieved; this is lower than that of platinum (51.8 mV) catalysts in 0.1 m HClO4, and the activity is improved, even after 5000 cycles.

In the synthetic process, bacterial cells containing biodeposited CdS nanocrystals, graphene oxide (GO), and Ni2+ ions are assembled into a sandwich-type hybrid precursor. The nanosized sulfur source drives in situ sulfidation during pyrolysis, which induces the uniform formation and growth of Ni/Ni3S2 composite nanoparticles (NPs) on the graphene substrate. Benefiting from the high specific surface area and uniform distribution of NPs, the catalyst has a large number of exposed active sites and exhibits rapid mass transfer. In addition, the skeleton composed of a conductive carbon matrix and metallic Ni-Ni network ensures the excellent electron transfer during the OER, and the synergistic effect of Ni-0 and Ni3S2 further optimizes the electronic structure and accelerates the OER kinetics. The dominant catalytic sites at the nanointerface between Ni-0 and Ni3S2 provide favorable thermodynamic conditions for the adsorption of OER intermediates. As a result, BG@Ni/Ni3S2 exhibits efficient catalytic performance for the OER: the overpotential and Tafel slope are only 320 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and 41 mV dec(-1), respectively. This work provides a novel understanding of the intrinsic activity of transition metal sulfide composites and a biologicalbased design for OER catalysts.									8	2	0	0	1	0	9			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000599505200027	33231421

Here, combining solvothermal and calcination strategies, oxygen vacancy-abundant amorphous MoO3 and non-crystal MoO2 were implanted into amorphous N,P-doped carbon as MoOx/NPC to hybridize sub-10 nm crystalline ruthenium dots (Ru-MoOx/NPC). Amorphous NPC bridges MoOx with Ru crystal to avoid the direct contact of MoOx and Ru, thus weakening the lattice strain influence. The electrochemical measurement results show that Ru-MoOx/NPC exhibits excellent catalytical capacity towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which only needs overpotentials of 30 mV and 27 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and acid electrolytes, respectively, outperforming numerous recent-reported catalysts. Such superior HER activity can be attributed to structural advantages of abundant oxygen deficiency, small-sized Ru dots, conductive amorphous NPC, and weakened lattice-strain for the maximum protection of key components. This study not only presents a well-defined nanostructure with high HER activity but also offers insight into the weakening of lattice-strain effects to support the catalytical property.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000712542400001

To optimize the performance and reduce the usage of noble metal Pt, both the mass and surface contribution should be considered, which requires Pt-Co alloy nanocrystals (NCs) to possess large surface area and expose specific facets. Unfortunately, these requirements can hardly be met simultaneously for the NCs with normal convex polyhedral shapes. In this work, a simple cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-assisted method is proposed to controllably synthesize Pt-Co alloy NCs with a unique excavated octahedral shape. The excavated octahedral Pt-Co alloy NCs is intrinsically built with mutually perpendicular interlaced ultrathin PtCo nanosheets bound with {100} facets that are not the thermodynamically most stable for face-centered cubic metals. The electrochemically surface area of the unique excavated octahedral PtCo alloy NCs is determined to be 23.3 m(2) g(-1) Pt, which is significantly larger than that of the normal octahedral Pt2Co alloy NCs with the same size (11.4 m(2) g(-1) Pt). Owing to the combination of large surface area and high active {100} facets, the excavated octahedral PtCo NCs display extraordinary catalytic activity and durability towards hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline environment. Strikingly, the overpotential of excavated PtCo NCs at the current density of 20 mA cm(-2) is as low as 76.2 mV, which is much lower than that for the {111} faceted Pt2Co NCs (83.9 mV) and the commercial Pt/C (107 mV), respectively. Besides, the excavated octahedral PtCo NCs also show significantly enhanced electrocatalytic performances towards methanol oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction when both considering the mass and surface contribution.									106	8	0	0	5	0	107			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000408878200063

As an important step toward this goal, for the first time, we report the development of CeO2 nanoparticles modified NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays (NWAs) grown on the carbon textiles as a new carbon-free and binder-free cathode system. In this study, the Li-O-2 battery with the CeO2@NiCo2O4 NWAs has exhibited much reduced overpotentials, a high discharge capacity, an improved cycling stability, outperforming the Li-O-2 battery with NiCo2O4 NWAs. These improvements can be attributed to both the tailored morphology of discharge product and improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity after CeO2 NPs deposition. To a considerable extent, this idea of cathode construction including structure design and composition optimization can provide guidance for further researches in developing more powerful cathode for Li-O-2 battery.									22	5	0	0	0	0	22			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000417935600007

Although NiFe oxides are considered as potentially applicable catalysts in the alkaline media, there are still a limited numbers of researches working on membrane electrode assembly(MEA) fed with pure water due to their poor electrical conductivity. In this work, antimony doped tin oxide(ATO) has been employed as conductive supports where NiFe layered double hydroxide uniformly dispersed[named NiFe-LDH(layered double hydroxide)/ATO]. The catalysts have been synthesized by a one-step co-precipitation method, and then NiFe-LDH/ATO-air plasma was obtained through mild air plasma treatment. According to XPS analysis, binding energies of Ni-2p and Fe-2p were shifted negatively. Moreover, a new signal of low oxygen coordination appeared on O-1s spectrum after air plasma treatment. These XPS results indicated that oxygen vacancies(O-v) were generated after air plasma treatment. Electrochemical mea-surement indicated that the vacancy-rich NiFe-LDH/ATO-air plasma exhibited better performance than NiFe-LDH/ATO not only in 1 mol/L KOH solutions but also in an alkaline polymer electrolyte water electrolyzer(APEWE) fed with deionized water. This work provides a feasible way to design practical catalysts used in electrochemical energy conversion systems by choosing corrosion resistance supports and defect engineering.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1005-9040	2210-3171		WOS:000630987000001

Comparing with the tradition solvothermal method with reaction time of 3 days under 120 degrees C, the newly developed reaction milling method significantly shorten the reaction time of the synthesis to 3 h under room temperature as well as bypassing the usage for hazardous solvents. The space-time yield of the developed reaction milling method for synthesis of the bifunctional electrocatalytic precursor reaches 189 kg m(-3) day(-1). Significantly, the optimal products followed by further carbonization (RM-COP-PA-900) demonstrated excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for an efficient ORR performance with similar commercialized Pt/C half-potential of 841 mV vs RHE as well as an IrO2-like OER activity with a potential of 1.69 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, which is better than most metal-free bifunctional catalysts. Moreover, the obtained RM-COP-PA-900 exhibits much better durability and resistance to crossover effect even than the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalysts. Therefore, this work will open up a rapid, solvent-free and scalable approach for, but not limit to, highly efficient electrocatalysts.									33	2	0	0	6	0	34			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000450105700042

Transition metal-based phosphides as a kind of highly efficient oxygen reaction (OER) catalyst is considered as a judicious select for renewable energy conversion and storage. In this work, CoFeP nanocube-arrays (NCAs) composite is successfully fabricated on a 3D porous conductive substrate (nickel foam), namely as CoFeP/NF. The CoFeP/NF material exhibits exciting electrocatalytic performance with extremely low overpotentials of 253 and 290 mV at the current density of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, respectively. Especially, remarkable durability for 100 h can be observed, which is a key parameter for practical application. CoFeP/NF parallel to Pt/C/NF as a two-electrode system is applied into overall water splitting. A series of outstanding electrocatalytic results are obtained, including a very low voltage of 1.54 V for achieving the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with remarkable stability in 1 M KOH. These performances have far superior to commercial noble metal of IrO2/NF parallel to Pt/C/NF. Therefore, this work not only provides some practical electrocatalyst materials, more importantly, it opens a feasible and universal strategy for constructing well-defined nanocube-array electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000763374500001

Favourable conditions for rapid Bi-2223 phase formation and stability were achieved with an oxygen partial pressure around 0.08 atm, regardless of precursor type or filament count. In general, the rate of the Bi-2223 formation reaction increased and the width of the temperature window for rapid kinetics became broader as the filament count increased. The most rapid kinetics and the broadest heat treatment window were observed for the 361-filament metallic powder composite. These trends in Bi-2223 formation rate and stability are believed to be associated with the increased proximity of powder to silver as the filament count increases and the filament transverse dimensions become smaller For each conductor type (in terms of precursor form and filament type) there was an optimum processing temperature in ca 0.08 atm O-2 that produced a well-developed Bi-2223 grain colony microstructure with the least amount of second-phase. This optimum temperature was near the peak of the reaction rate Versus temperature profile.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0953-2048			WOS:000081102200003

To reduce the global temperature rise, i.e., < 2 degrees C, it requires 20 billion tons of CO2 removal, annually. Oceanic plants, i.e., phytoplankton, are responsible for generating similar to 80% of O-2 in Earth's atmosphere, but, stock-flow of CO2 is affecting the distribution of these plants, and destabilizing the marine ecosystems, thereby making a self-sustained cycle of accelerated climate change. Recently, researchers have started exploring nanoclusters (NCs), which can potentially fulfill energy demand with higher efficiency by photocatalytic oxidation of water (H2O) by producing oxygen, hydrogen, and other solar fuels like methanol. NCs can be used in plants to improve photocatalytic efficiency, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells, artificial photosynthesis machines, efficiency improvement in dye-sensitized solar cells to space travel. In this sense, the present review discusses various nanocluster materials, their synthesis methods, resulting properties, and recent advancements for efficient artificial and biohybrid photosynthetic systems.									14	0	0	0	5	0	14			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000507465200104

However, their monofunctionality in addition to their exorbitant cost has stimulated the quest for economically viable bifunctional electrocatalysts for use in next generation electrochemical energy devices. Here, we report Fe-Fe3C encapsulated in Fe-Nx enriched spheres of N-doped carbon nanotubes (FCMR,M = 3, 10, 25, 40 represents the ramping rate of temperature during synthesis) as a potentially enduring, cost effective, highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for total oxygen electrochemistry (ORR and OER) and a comprehensive study to elucidate the role of various Fe moieties. In addition to the improved OER/ORR activities as evident from the better onset potential, lower Tafel slopes and high current densities over commercially available RuO2/Pt-C electrocatalysts and several recently reported state-of-the-art bi-functional electrocatalysts, FC10R shows a current retention value of similar to 93 and similar to 98% after the accelerated cyclic stability test for the OER and ORR, respectively. The preferable 4e (-) pathways and suppressed peroxide generation in the ORR by FC10R further ensure maximum electrochemical energy harvesting. Remarkably, the complete oxygen electrochemistry of FC10R in alkaline medium as evaluated from Delta E (= E-j(OER) = 10 - E-1/2(ORR) = 0.758 V) is significantly lower than that of commercially available/ recently reported electrocatalysts and advocates the minimum cyclic loss. The overall study elucidates the synergistic effect of Fe-Nx coordination and Fe3C moieties on oxygen electrochemistry, and FC10R has shown its potential to serve as a non-precious metal based bifunctional electrocatalyst for next generation electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices. Finally, a prototype Al-air battery arrangement using FC10R as an air- cathode for powering a green light emitting diode has been demonstrated.									29	0	0	0	2	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000434624800045

However, the sluggish O-2 evolution reaction usually requires high overpotential and may yield reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can degrade the electrolyzer membrane and hence shorten the device lifetime. In addition, the potential gas crossover may result in an explosive H-2/O-2 mixture and hence safety risks. To address these issues, we herein report a general electrolysis strategy for the simultaneous H-2 production and alcohol oxidative upgrading (e.g., benzyl alcohol, 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol, 4-methylbenzyl alcohol, ethanol, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural), in which the thermodynamics of the latter is much easier than that of water oxidation. A facile and environmentally friendly template-free electrodeposition was used to obtain a 3D hierarchically porous nickel-based electrocatalyst (hp-Ni) for such an integrated electrolysis, requiring a voltage of similar to 220 mV smaller than that of water splitting to achieve 50 mA cm(-2) together with robust stability, high Faradaic efficiencies, and no formation of ROS, as well as production of valuable products at both the cathode (H-2) and anode (alcohol oxidation products). More importantly, we demonstrated that these diverse alcohol oxidations over hp-Ni exhibited similar onset potentials which were largely determined by the desirable oxidation potential of hp-Ni, irrespective of the different intrinsic thermodynamics of these alcohol oxidation reactions. This result provides a new direction for the rational design of heterogeneous transition-metal-based electrocatalysts with lower oxidation potential for more highly efficient electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation.									186	7	0	0	8	0	189			2155-5435			WOS:000405360800044

The process associates both remote plasma and fluidized bed technologies. Two applications are described. The first one, for increasing the hydrophilic character of PE, only requires a single plasma treatment. The second application involves FCRN plasma polymerization of 1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane mixed with oxygen to obtain a hydrophobic film on the powder surface. The wettability evolution of the PE powder was followed by contact angle measurements (Washburn method) versus different experimental parameters. The surface modifications induced by the treatments were studied by XPS.

However, the synthesis of hierarchical mixed transition-metal oxides-based nanosheets-assembled nanotubes for highly efficient photocatalytic oxygen evolution is rarely reported. Herein, a simple and versatile approach was developed to synthesize hierarchical nanosheets-constructed MCo2O4 (M = Ni, Cu, Zn) nanotubes. Core-shell polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/M-cobalt hydroxide ultrathin nanosheet composite nanofibers were first synthesized by hydroxylation reaction between PAN/M-cobalt acetate hydroxide precursors and NaBH4. After calcination, these nanofibers as precursors were easily transformed into the cor responding hierarchical nanosheets-constructed MCo2O4 nanotubes. By applying a photocatalyst, the resultant MCo2O4 nanotubes, particularly the CuCo2O4 nanotubes, exhibited high photocatalytic activity and cycle stability toward water oxidation reaction with O-2 generation rates of 51.1 mmol g(-1) h(-1) under visible light irradiation, which is higher than most reported catalysts. This approach is very versatile and can be applied to synthesize other hierarchical multi-element oxides-based nanosheets-constructed nanotubes for advanced applications.									21	1	0	0	2	0	21			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000426148500034	29417974

One interesting material for ALD synthesis is MnOx, a promising earth-abundant catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It has previously been shown that catalysts beginning as MnO synthesized using ALD on smooth glassy carbon (s-GC) electrodes and Mn2O3 obtained upon annealing MnO on s-GC are active OER catalysts. Here, we use ALD to deposit MnO on high surface area GC (HSA-GC) substrates, forming an active catalyst on a geometric surface area basis. We then characterize three types of catalysts, HSA-GC MnO, s-GC MnO, and annealed MnO (Mn2O3), using cyclic voltammetry (CV), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). We show that under OER conditions, all three catalysts oxidize to similar surface states with a mixture of Mn3+/Mn4+ and that MnOx surface area effects can account for the observed differences in the catalytic activity. We also demonstrate the need for a high surface area support for high OER activity on a geometric basis.									36	1	0	0	1	0	36			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000354946200025	25946998

However, the weak light utilization and sluggish kinetics in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process substantially retard the photocatalytic efficiency. In this context, modification of the semiconductors to overcome these limits has been the effective strategy for obtaining highly-efficient photocatalytic water oxidation. Here, plasmonic Au has been loaded onto BiVO4 inverse opal (IO) for photocatalytic water oxidation. It is discovered that the IO structure provides higher specific surface area and favors light absorption on BiVO4. In the meantime, the plasmonic Au can simultaneously enhance the light-utilization capability and photogenerated charge carrier utilization ability of the BiVO4 IO. As a result, a high photocurrent density and long photogenerated charge carrier lifetime can be achieved on the optimized Au-BiVO4 IO, thereby obtaining a superior photocatalytic activity with an oxygen production rate of 9.56 mu mol g(-1) h(-1).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000623512700038	35423374

Herein, we developed a facile method to prepare nitrogen and iron doped nickel(II) hydroxide nanosheets on self-supported conductive nickel foam (denoted as Fe,N-Ni(OH)(2)/NF) through ammonia hydrothermal and impregnation methods. Owing to the optimization of the electronic structure by nitrogen doping and the strong synergistic effect between Fe and Ni(OH)(2), the three-dimensional (3D) Fe,N-Ni(OH)(2)/NF nanosheets delivered superior electrocatalytic OER performances in basic solution with low potentials of 1.57 V and 1.59 V under 500 mA/cm(2) and 1000 mA/cm(2) respectively and robust operation for 10 h with ignored activity decay, comparing well with the potentials of previously reported NiFe based electrocatalysts as well as the benchmark commercial Ir/C/NF. In-situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that the main active species were NiOOH during the OER process. The present results are expected to provide new insights into the study of OER process towards ultra-high current densities.

Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) is a highly promising photoanode material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, but its severe bulk and surface charge recombination, sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and narrow visible light harvesting are still bottlenecks. Here, an excellent CQDs/FeOOH/BiVO4 photoanode was designed by co-modification of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and ultrathin beta-FeOOH layers (< 10 nm) on BiVO4 to tackle the above issues. The CQDs/FeOOH/BiVO4 shows dramatically enhanced photocurrent, which is 10.7 and 2.98 times higher than BiVO4 and FeOOH/BiVO4 at 0.8 V vs. RHE (VRHE), with negatively shifted onset potential of 448 and 255 mV, respectively. The maximum incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of CQDs/FeOOH/BiVO4 is 6.7 and 1.86 times higher than that of BiVO4 and FeOOH/BiVO4, respectively. Additionally, the surface hole injection efficiency (eta(surface)) of CQDs/FeOOH/BiVO4 is 7.1 and 2.1 times higher than that of BiVO4 and FeOOH/BiVO4 at 0.8 VRHE, respectively. The results can be attributed to three effects: (i) Synergetic catalysis of CQDs and FeOOH sharply improves the OER kinetics due to the introduction of high-density oxygen vacancies (Ov); (ii) The CQDs/BiVO4 heterojunction efficiently suppresses the bulk charge recombination; (iii) CQDs significantly boost the light harvesting both in the ultraviolet and visible regions.									37	4	0	0	6	0	38			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000579752500075

In this work, LiF-Li2O melts containing CO2 were electrolyzed using a Ni cathode and Pt anode at 850 degrees C. Carbon materials with different morphologies were deposited on the cathode and oxygen evolution was detected in anode gas. The products were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and gas chromatography. The results demonstrated that CO2 was firstly captured and converted into the carbonate in LiF-Li2O melts, and subsequently electrolyzed. The morphologies of the carbon material obtained on the cathode were dependent on the electrolysis potentials.

Herein, a facile two-step method including the high-pressure microwave and the hydrothermal sulfurization is adopted to prepare the WSx/Ni9S8 hetero-catalyst on nickel foam (WSx/Ni9S8/NF). Firstly, WO3 polyhedrons homogeneously cover the surface of NF through the high-pressure microwave hydrothermal process. Secondly, WSx/Ni9S8 nanoparticles on the surface of NF can be synthesized after a hydrothermal sulfurization, which has been confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) elemental mapping and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The amorphous WSx and Ni9S8 phase may provide the dual active sites for OER. The electrochemical measurements show that WSx/Ni9S8/NF has superior OER activity with a low overpotential of 320 mV at the current density of 100 mA.cm(-2), better than those of other samples. The enhanced OER performance may be due to the synergistic catalysis from Ni9S8 phase and high valence of W. Owing to the stable structure of Ni9S8, the long-term stability of WSx/Ni9S8/NF for at least 10 h can be obtained. This work may provide a new approach for the doped nickel sulfides crystal phase through high-pressure microwave hydrothermal assistance for OER.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000623792800001

This study focused on the influence of the deteriorated bentonite sediments on the corrosion behavior of NiCu low alloy steel in the top supernatant and bottom slurry formed by Gaomiaozi bentonite and 0.05 M NaHCO3 + 0.1 M NaCl + 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. In the top supernatant, the cathodic process of the steel corrosion was transformed from the reduction in oxygen to the reduction in ferric corrosion products with time as same as that in the blank solution. While in the bottom bentonite slurry, the cathodic process always maintained as the hydrogen evolution reaction due to the coverage of more bentonite sediments. Meanwhile, the corrosion rate of NiCu steel was obviously decreased. In addition, the localized corrosion tendency of the steel could also be reduced by the large amount of deteriorated bentonite sediments.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1006-7191	2194-1289		WOS:000676046800001

However, Sr readily accumulates on their surface, and makes them inert toward the OER. Herein, we propose a simple but versatile electrochemical reduction method to reconstruct the active surface of Co-based perovskites within a few seconds. By this method, Sr rapidly precipitates from Co-based perovskites, accompanied by the introduction of Sr and oxygen vacancies. After reconstruction, the electrochemical active surface areas of Co-based perovskites greatly increase, and the OER overpotential of the optimized SrNb0.1Co0.7Fe0.2O3-delta (ER-SNCF-20s) reaches 278 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). This can be explained by the decrease of overpotentials at the rate-determining step. Using ER-SNCF-20s, the splitting voltage of alkaline natural seawater can reach 1.56 V at 10 mA cm(-2), and remains steady for 300 h. This effort offers a feasible method for reconstructing the active surface of Co-based perovskites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000821206400001	35792617

Ni-catalyzed chemical vapor deposition is employed to obtain vertically-aligned SiC NWs, and electrodeposition is used to functionalize the nanowires with hierarchical Co3O4 nano-clusters and a thin Co3O4 layer on the top side and the side-walls of the NWs, respectively. By using the Co3O4-functionalized SiC NW electrode for OER, the overpotential required to drive an anodic current density (J(anodic)) of 10 mA cm(-2) is 0.22 V, a value much lower than those of Co3O4 nano-clusters (0.42 V), of bare SiC NWs (1.27 V) electrodes and of Pt foil (0.56 V). The overpotential value of 0.22 V is among the most active for the noble metal-free electro-catalytic electrode to produce J(anodic) of 10 mA cm(-2). The deposition of Co3O4 on the SiC NW substrate produces an extremely hydrophilic surface, which improves the charge transfer characteristics at the interface between the electrode and the aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, the vertically-aligned SiC NWs provide a directional charge transport route along the nanowire length, as seen from a lower charge transfer resistance (R-ct) in the Co3O4-functionalized SiC NW electrode compared to the Co3O4-functionalized SiC electrode under the same OER operating conditions. Finally, the Co3O4-functionalized SiC NW electrode maintains stable performance in an alkaline electrolyte (i.e., 1 M KOH aqueous solution) during continuous electrolysis testing over 16 h. The outstanding electro-catalytic performance and stability make the Co3O4-functionalized SiC NW electrode a promising noble metal-free electro-catalytic electrode for the OER and other renewable energy applications.

However, a catalytic descriptor is not established due to the difficult characterization of the charge transfer between Li2O2 and the catalyst. Here, we employ first-principles thermodynamic calculations to study the electrocatalytic mechanism of 4d transition metals. We found that charge acceptation and donation capacities of catalysts, defined as surface electron affinity (V-SEA) and surface ionic potential (V-SIP), take cooperative responsibilities for the activation of Li-O-2 bonds and the reduction of desorption barriers of Li+ and O-2, respectively. Therefore, we define surface electronegativity V-SE (V-SE (V-SEA + V-SIP)/2), which exhibits a volcano curve with a reduced charge overpotential, as the catalytic descriptor. We identified those catalysts with surface electronegativities of 1.7-2.2 V to have highly catalytic activities in the reduction of the charge overpotential, which are well verified by previous experimental data. The present study opens a wide avenue in the development of high-activity catalysts for interfacial electrocatalysts by an effective descriptor.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000542925300038	32441914

It is still a huge challenge to enhance the intrinsically catalytic performance of non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts. Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have been recognized as the effective HER catalysts. However, TMPs nanosheets suffer from low activity for water dissociation, which prohibits the HER properties of electrocatalyst in alkaline solution. Herein, a structure that decorates CoP3/CoMoP nanosheets on the black TiO2-x nanotube arrays substrate has been designed. The oxygen vacancy in the black TiO2-x substrate is expected to play an important role in the water dissociation and therefore enhance the initial Volmer step during HER. What's more, the nanotube structure of black TiO2-x substrate provides a larger surface area for CoP3/ CoMoP nano sheets decoration, the number of active sites enhanced during the reaction, resulting in higher HER performance. Experimental results demonstrate that CoP3/CoMoP/TiO2-x@Ti possesses much improved HER properties with a low overpotential of 143 mV at 10 mA(-2) and a Tafel slope of 61 mV dec(-1), it also provides long-term durability without significant degradation for 48 h. This work develops a low-cost and valuable approach to enhance the HER activity of transition metal phosphides in alkaline electrolytes. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, the slow half-reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), restricts the widespread application of the water electrolysis method in industrial settings. The OER requires a four electron transfer process, which is the dominant reason limiting the efficiency of water electrolysis. A highly efficient OER electrocatalyst can improve the hydrogen production efficiency of water electrolysis. Here, we report a facile method to synthesize an electrospun CoFe2O4CoFex/C nanofiber electrocatalyst. The electrocatalyst displays a high activity and high stability for the OER. Preparation of the electrocatalyst incorporates (1) the electrospinning synthesis of iron and cobalt-doped polyvinylpyrrolidone nanofibers as a precursor and (2) heat-treatment under a nitrogen atmosphere with carbon to thermally converting the precursor into a CoFe2O4-CoFex/C nanofiber. The optimal calcination temperature for the CoFe2O4-CoFex/C nanofibers is 800 degrees C, and the optimal iron: cobalt molar ratio is 1:1. The overpotential required for the samples to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) is only 350 mV. After using the electrocatalyst for chronopotentiometry for more than 10 h, the overpotential only increases to approximately 20 mV, which proves the high durability of the electrocatalyst.

In this work, we report the self-templated fabrication of hierarchical manganese-cobalt phosphide (Mn-Co phosphide) yolk-shell spheres using highly uniform cobalt glycerate spheres as sacrificial templates. Through a simple exchange reaction with the manganese precursor solution at room temperature, these cobalt glycerate spheres are readily converted to hierarchical MnCo LDH yolk-shell spheres, which can be further phosphidized at 350 degrees C under inert atmosphere to generate hierarchical Mn-Co phosphide with distinct yolk-shell morphology. When tested as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the hierarchical Mn-Co phosphide yolk-shell spheres exhibit an overpotential of 330 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 59.0 mV dec(-1), which are higher than those of Mn-Co oxide yolk-shell spheres (480 mV and 113 mV dec(-1)) and hierarchical cobalt phosphide spheres (410 mV and 61.3 mV dec(-1)). Post-OER analysis by XPS reveals that the high activity of the hierarchical Mn-Co phosphide yolk-shell catalyst originates from the existence of Mn4+/Mn3+ and Co2+/Co3+ redox couples and the formation of active metal oxyhydroxide species on its surface. The proposed self-sacrificial templating strategy will provide useful guidance for future construction of hollow inorganic metal nanostructures with yolk-shell morphology for energy storage and conversion applications.									87	4	0	0	7	1	87			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000621234200003

The oxygen evolution rate of the obtained defect-engineered 3DOM WO3 (W270-400) is 40.1 mu mol h(-1), which is much higher than that of the untreated 3DOM WO3 and the defect-engineered WO3 nanoparticles. The enhanced performance is due to the good light harvesting and excellent charge transportion properties. The results show that the slow photon effect and bulk oxygen vacancy (V-O) induced narrowed band gap greatly improve the light harvesting efficiency, while abundant surface V-O can lower the valence band to increase the driving force for water oxidation, and thus significantly promote electron-hole separation. Our work can guide further design and preparation of high-efficiency defect-engineered 3DOM semiconductors for solar energy conversion.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000616679700047

In this study, an electrocatalyst FeNiOxHy with a hierarchical structure is synthesized on nickel foam by a simple fabrication method through anion exchange from a metal phosphate to a metal hydroxide. The as-fabricated FeNiOxHy electrode requires overpotentials of 206 and 234 mV to deliver current densities of 10 and 50 mAcm(-2), respectively. The catalytic performance of FeNiOxHy is superior to that of most previously reported FeNi-based catalysts, including NiFe layered double hydroxide. The catalyst also shows good long-term durability at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) over 50 h with no activity decay under 1 m KOH. By comparison to the directly electrodeposited FeNi hydroxide in morphology and electrochemical properties, the improved activity of the catalyst could be mainly attributed to an enhancement of its intrinsic activity, which was caused by the anion exchange of phosphate to (oxy)hydroxide. Further studies by cyclic voltammetry indicated a stronger interaction between Ni and Fe from the negative shift of the oxidation peak of Ni2+/Ni3+ in comparison with reported FeNiOxHy, which promoted the generation of active Ni3+ species more easily. This work may provide a new approach to the simple preparation of effective and robust OER catalysts by anion exchange.									19	2	0	0	3	0	19			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000434961400005	29660805

Herein, foamed carbon-supported nickel-iron oxides interspersed with bamboo-like carbon nanotubes are prepared as bi-functional electrocatalysts for this battery type. During high temperature synthesis, edges of carbon sheets comprising the foamed carbon structure become involuted to form short carbon nanotubes. The composite of carbon nanotubes and network carbon confer high specific surface area and high electrical conductivity on the newly prepared materials. The supported NiFe2O4 phase improves the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity by fixing more N atoms, and high-valent Ni oxide (Ni2O3) promotes the formation of O-O bonds, which is conducive to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The optimized material exhibits excellent bi-functional electrocatalytic activity toward both ORR and OER, and its use in the assembled zinc-air battery cell results in a high power density of 150 mW cm(-2) with long discharge stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000859077000001	36161700

Reportedly, there is no clear definition to define "self-supporting" materials, and also, no such comprehensive reviews have fully discussed the self-supporting materials in gas-involved electrochemical applications. Therefore, it is necessary to provide timely updates in this potential field. In this review, for the first time, a reasonable definition of self-supporting materials and comprehensively review the recent research progress of related electrodes in gas-involved electrocatalytic applications is given. Firstly, it is discussed their synthetic methodologies, including design principles, different types of substrates- and substrate-free structures.

AbstractThe development of efficient earth-abundant electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution reactions (ORR, OER, and HER) is important for future energy conversion and energy storage devices, for which both rechargeable Zn-air batteries and water splitting have raised great expectations. Herein, we report a single-phase bimetallic nickel cobalt sulfide ((Ni,Co)S-2) as an efficient electrocatalyst for both OER and ORR. Owing to the synergistic combination of Ni and Co, the (Ni,Co)S-2 exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for ORR, OER, and HER in an alkaline electrolyte, and the first principle calculation results indicate that the reaction of an adsorbed O atom with a H2O molecule to form a *OOH is the potential limiting step in the OER. Importantly, it could be utilized as an advanced air electrode material in Zn-air batteries, which shows an enhanced charge-discharge performance (charging voltage of 1.71V and discharge voltage of 1.26V at 2mAcm(-2)), large specific capacity (842mAhg-1 at 5mAcm(-2)), and excellent cycling stability (480h). Interestingly, the (Ni,Co)S-2-based Zn-air battery can efficiently power an electrochemical water-splitting unit with (Ni,Co)S-2 serving as both the electrodes. This reveals that the prepared (Ni,Co)S-2 has promising applications in future energy conversion and energy storage devices.									153	9	0	0	4	0	152			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000455352300001

Specifically, at the atomic scale, the ultrathin CoOx layers effectively accelerate electron conduction and provide abundant active sites. X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that the metallic Co/N-doped graphene substrate contributes to electron transfer toward the ultrathin CoOx layer, which is beneficial for the electrocatalytic process. The as-obtained electrocatalyst exhibits ultrahigh electrochemical activity with a positive half-wave potential of 0.896 V for ORR and a low overpotential of 370 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER. The flexible Zn-air battery built with this catalyst exhibits an ultrahigh specific power of 300 W g(cat)(-1), which is essential for portable devices. This work provides a new design pathway for electrocatalysts for high-performance rechargeable metal-air battery systems.									173	7	0	0	7	0	173			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000468033400014	30785222

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) possessing the metal ions centers and organic ligands are one of promising precursors for fabricating metal-containing carbon based OER electrocatalysts via a simple carbonization process. Here, a series of MOFs derived CoM (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) bimetallic nanoparticles decorated N-doped 1D carbon nanotubes/3D porous carbon have been synthesized as high performance and robust electrocatalysts for OER. All of the binary metal doped electrocatalysts not only show smaller overpotential for OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a lower Tafel slope, but also exhibit a remarkable long-term durability in alkaline aqueous solution. It is discovered that in-situ incorporation of Fe, Ni, Cu into MOFs derived carbon materials can modulate the electronic structure of the electrocatalysts, forming more catalytically active sites, increasing electrochemically-active areas (ECSA) and facilitating electron mass transport and electron transfer during the OER process. Moreover, the 3D porous structure can also promote the exposure of active sites, provide a larger surface area for electrocatalysts to contact the electrolyte and construct a favorable catalytic interface, thus advancing the electrocatalytic performance. This work develops a general approach to preparing the efficient and robust carbon based electrocatalyts derived from MOFs precursors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

At present, investigations on anodes of air batteries are usually focused on various metals such as Li, Zn, Al. In contrast, the semiconductor anodes like Si and Ge are less investigated. Si-air battery possesses a high theoretical energy density and Ge-air battery has a high actual power density and ideal safety. Besides anodes, air cathodes where oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are also the key components in air batteries. To further promote the discharging performance and facilitate energy conversion/storage, semiconductor materials have been introduced in electrochemical cells like Li-O-2 and Zn-air batteries. This review briefly summarizes semiconductor materials utilized in various air batteries, including the progress of Si-air and Ge-air batteries and recent advances in semiconductor cathodes catalysts. Finally, the remaining challenges and further perspective are discussed.

Herein, NiFe layered double hydroxide was in situ grown hydrothermally on a 3D graphite felt (NiFe LDH/GF) as a high-efficiency catalyst in facilitating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In 1.0 M KOH, NiFe LDH/GF requires a low overpotential of 214 mV to deliver a geometric current density of 50 mA cm(-2) (eta(50 mA cm-2) = 214 mV), surpassing that NiFe LDH supported on a 2D graphite paper (NiFe LDH/GP; eta(50 mA cm-2) = 301 mV). More importantly, NiFe LDH/GF shows good durability at 50 mA cm(-2) within 50 h of OER catalysis testing and delivers a faradaic efficiency of nearly 100% in the electrocatalysis of OER.									61	2	0	0	3	0	61			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000695585400013	34357774

However, few can meet the industrially mandated overpotential of 0.30 V at 500 mA/cm(2) and cell voltage of 1.60 V, let alone be applied to electrolysis of seawater. We synthesized a nickel foam (NF)-supported NiFe-LDH whose OER overpotential is only 0.257 V at 500 mA/cm(2) in an alkaline saline solution and requires a cell voltage of 1.54 V for the same current density when coupled with a MoNi4/MoO2/NF cathode for electrolyzing alkalized seawater. The NiFe-LDH catalyst comprises numerous nanometer-sized crystalline facets surrounded by an amorphous phase, in contrast to its highly crystalline counterpart. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the boundaries separating crystalline facets and amorphous phase contain more Ni3+ than other areas. Anion chromatographic analysis indicates that OH- adsorbs preferentially over Cl- onto the sites of Ni3+ of both partially and highly crystalline NiFe-LDHs, whereas Cl- adsorbs more extensively onto the crystalline planes or facets. These adsorption behaviors and the resultant different catalytic activities at high current densities can be readily rationalized by the Pearson's hard-soft acid-base principle. Because more boundaries exist in the partially crystalline NiFe-LDH, the partially crystalline NiFe-LDH catalyst is not only more catalytically efficient than its highly crystalline counterpart and other catalysts reported up to the present, but it is also stable in alkalized seawater and unaffected by Cl- adsorption.									23	0	0	0	1	0	22			2574-0962			WOS:000656119600038

Herein, we deliberately conceive and successfully synthesize a donutlike architecture of RuCu bimetallic nanoalloy with well- defined nanoscale shell by a facile "galvanic replacement" strategy to boost Ru- based electrocatalysts with prominent water oxidation performance in an acid condition. The as-prepared donutlike RuCu nanostructures with an ultrathin shell of nm thickness could catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under a small overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) with excellent long-term stability and ultrahigh mass activity of similar to 1000 A.g(Ru)(-1), two-orders of magnitude larger than Ru and commercial RuO2 nanoparticles. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the well-dispersed Cu element plays a key role in the architectural engineering and catalytic activity improvement of donutlike RuCu nanoalloy catalysts via dual regulation of coordination environment and electron structure of Ru active sites. Especially, by the merits of ultrathin shell structure, the strong surface electron transfer via robust Ru-Cu bonds could effectively promote the appearance of active and stable Ru2+ throughout donutlike RuCu nanoalloy, resulting in much more thermodynamically favor for H2O adsorption and *OOH formation during OER process compared with metallic Ru nanoparticle. Undoubtedly, this approach may open a new avenue for strategically designing highly active and performance-oriented electrocatalytic materials for tremendous energy applications.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			2574-0962			WOS:000502688800058

Fundamental research on mixed Ni-Fe OER catalysts has largely focused on high pH, while the OER activity near neutral pH has remained poorly studied.Here we review the activity of an amorphous mixed Ni-Fe oxyhydroxide catalyst supported on carbon (NiFeOx/C) in 0.1 M KOH pH 13, in 0.1 M borate buffer (B-i) pH 9.2, and in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (P-i) pH 7.0. The OER catalytic performance was found to decrease in the order of pH 13 > pH 9.2 > pH 7. In contrast to pH 13 and 9.2, the catalyst cycled in pH 7 showed an instantaneous decrease in OER activity and a simultaneous loss of the Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox peak. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) showed the formation of crystalline areas upon CV cycling, which appeared more Ni enriched after cycling in pH 7. Deactivated electrodes cycled in pH 13 recovered the OER activity along with a partial reappearance of the Ni redox peak when subsequently cycled in pH 13. SEM-EDX spectroscopy confirmed compositional changes in the bulk during cycling at different pH, with an extensive leaching of Ni in pH 7. Our study provides new insight into the OER activity upon exposure to different electrolyte conditions, which unveils a highly dynamic Ni-Fe oxide framework.

New battery chemistries based on LiOH, rather than Li2O2, have been recently reported in systems with added water, one using a soluble additive LiI and the other using solid Ru catalysts. Here, the focus is on the mechanism of Ru-catalyzed LiOH chemistry. Using nuclear magnetic resonance, operando electrochemical pressure measurements, and mass spectrometry, it is shown that on discharging LiOH forms via a 4e(-) oxygen reduction reaction, the H in LiOH coming solely from added H2O and the O from both O-2 and H2O. On charging, quantitative LiOH oxidation occurs at 3.1V, with O being trapped in a form of dimethyl sulfone in the electrolyte. Compared to Li2O2, LiOH formation over Ru incurs few side reactions, a critical advantage for developing a long-lived battery. An optimized metal-catalyst-electrolyte couple needs to be sought that aids LiOH oxidation and is stable towards attack by hydroxyl radicals.									53	2	0	0	2	0	53			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000417200600048	29058366

The development of an electrode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at reduced overpotential is thus essential. Here, we suggest a binder- free electrode based on Co nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanofibers (Co-CNFs), which simultaneously reduces the charge and discharge polarization and extends cycling stability. Co-CNF gives rise to a lower discharge polarization because of an enhanced oxygen reduction reaction activity compared to Co-free CNF. Although the embedment of Co does not enhance the OER activity, it significantly reduces charge overvoltage by forming easily decomposable amorphous Li2O2. A mechanism for the formation of amorphous Li2O2 is suggested in terms of charge localization induced by the Co NPs. The findings suggest a new electrode design strategy of combining inexpensive metals and carbon materials for modulating the phase of the discharge product.									22	1	0	0	3	0	22			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000360092400008	26178625

The diameter and thickness of the C shell are 100 nm and 5-10 nm, respectively, and numerous holes of different sizes exist on the C shell. Meanwhile, numerous C shells stack together to form macropores, thereby forming a hierarchical porous structure in the material. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis reveals that the specific surface area and pore volume of the Co-Ru@C shell are 631.57 m(2) g(-1) and 2.20 cc g(-1), respectively, which can result in many three-phase interfaces and provide more space for the deposition of discharge products. Compared with Co@C shell and C shell electrodes, the obtained Co-Ru@C shell-based electrodes exhibit the highest discharge capacity, the lowest oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction overpotential and the best cycle stability, indicating the excellent catalytic ability of the Co-Ru@C shell.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2046-2069			WOS:000437475600054	35540248

More than 95% of electron-rich pollutants are degraded in the Mn-OMS/PMS system after 30 min reaction time, but oxidative decomposition of electron-poor pollutants takes at least 150 min. This difference in reaction rate is proved to be pollutant-dependent. We then combine multiple methods to cross-validate the PMS activation mechanism, including the quenching test, EPR characterization, solvent-exchange experiment, PMS decomposition rate test, and electrochemical analysis. Catalyst-mediated electron transfer is determined as the main activation mechanism for electron-rich pollutants degradation, while removal of electron-poor pollutants relies on singlet oxygen (O-1(2) ) and/or radicals. Additionally, the PMS activation mechanism depends on whether H2O or pollutants or low-valence Mn ions preferentially transfer electrons to the adsorbed PMS. This work provides mechanistic insights into the effect of pollutants type on PMS activation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000860609000005

A series of observations was made that is consistent with a significantly higher degree of adsorption of sulfate than triflate at the oxide surface. In TFMSA, the reaction rates for the OER are significantly higher than in H2SO4, and the flatband potential in TFMSA is higher than in sulfuric acid. In solutions of Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4-) and sulfuric acid, the reduction currents associated with the redox couple were much smaller than the oxidation currents. The same cathodic "blocking" was observed in TFMSA and Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4-). However, in the presence of small amounts of chloride ions (10 ppm) in TFMSA, the AIROF electrode showed no such cathodic blocking of the faradaic current and the electrode behaves similarly to a metal electrode. The chloride ions do not affect the redox behavior with sulfuric acid as the electrolyte. The absence of cathodic blocking in TFMSA with chloride ions is also suggested to be due to the lesser degree of electrolyte adsorption than in sulfuric acid; the oxide and substrate being more open to chloride hindering reoxidation of oxide cracks.

To settle such issue, herein, self-assembled porous coral-like architecture constructed by cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) nanocrystals and nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) nanoplatelets network is fabricated for the first time by a facile electroless deposition approach. The porous coral-like CoHCF/NC hybrid exhibits an excellent OER electrocatalytic activity in alkaline medium with an ultra-low onset overpotential of 165 mV (vs. RHE) and a small Tafel slope of 73.97 mV dec(-1), which are much lower than that of bare CoHCF (onset overpotential of 296 mV and Tafel slope of 113.25 mV dec(-1)); it also exhibits a lower overpotential of 357 mV (vs. RHE) at current density of 10 mA cm(-1) and superior durability even after 16 h. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of CoHCF/NC hybrid can be assigned to its unique coral-like architecture self-assembled by CoHCF nanocrystals and NC nanoplatelets network, which significantly increases the electrochemical active surface area and remarkably facilitates the electron and ion transfer. This work offers rational design and facile synthesis strategy for transition metal hexacyanoferrate-based nonprecious electrocatalysts with unique nano-architecture and excellent electrocatalytic efficiency towards OER.

A platinum microdisc electrode was selected as the tip electrode, which functioned as a pH sensor with transient response capability. The pH value of the solution near the Ni electrode surface varied while the Ni substrate oxidation reaction occurred, and the pH variation could be detected by the tip faradic current. The cyclic voltammogram results showed that two types of hydroxides: i.e. alpha-Ni(OH)(2) and beta-Ni(OH)(2) were formed during Ni oxidation in the lower potential region. In the proceedings of alpha-Ni(OH)(2) -> gamma-NiOOH and beta-Ni(OH)(2) -> beta-NiOOH, the process of OH- concentration decrease in the solution was ahead and behind of electron transfer in the solid phase, respectively. These results indicate that the OH- adsorption process occurs as an elementary step in the former reaction and the H+ diffusion process from the inner to the outer layer of the solid phase occurs as a subsequent step in the latter reaction. The results also revealed that the oxide film on the Ni surface has a two-layer structure. The real potential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the Ni surface with different cycles is also analyzed in the paper.

Second, to provide experimental evidence, Mn-doped CoS2 nanowires are prepared by a hydrothermal and postsulfuration method. The optimized sample shows a low overpotential of 43 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), a Tafel slope of only 34 mV/dec, and long-time stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

But, the weak interaction between the oxygen intermediates and reaction sites leads to sluggish catalytic kinetics. Herein, to trigger the exceptional catalytic activity of CMO, we propose a thermal-induced MnO6 octahedral distortion strategy to advance the absorption capability of intermediate reactants. Refined structural analysis and theoretical calculation reveal that the strong Jahn-Teller distortion of MnO6 is capable of optimizing the surface electron redistribution and accelerating the electron transfer between the oxygen and Mn sites, which significantly boosts the intrinsic oxygen catalytic activities of the distorted CMO (D-CMO). Notably, the D-CMO functions as excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts and enables a high-performance solid-state Zn-air battery with satisfactory mechanical strength. Specifically, the as-assembled battery displays a remarkable open circuit voltage of 1.46 V and high peak power density of 149 mW cm-2, even outstripping noble-metal-based counterparts. Modulating the octahedral units to ignite the intrinsic oxygen catalytic activity provides enlightening clues to design perovskitetype air cathodes.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000663443700002

EFFECT OF SILVER CONTENT IN Pb-Ag ANODES ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ANODES DURING ZINC ELECTROWINNING								CANADIAN METALLURGICAL QUARTERLY				48	4			327	336						OCT 2009	2009	The efficiency of the electrowinning process of zinc depends on the performance of oxygen evolution reaction, anode quality and corrosion resistance of lead anodes. The original surfaces of rolled commercial lead-silver anodes were examined using conventional polarization methods in acid zinc sulfate electrolyte with MnSO(4) at 38 degrees C. The self-discharge method (potential decay) following 5 hours of polarization at 50 mA.cm(-2) was considered to evaluate electrochemical activity, oxygen overpotential and anode stability. The influence of silver content is compared to that of the microstructure, the fabrication process and the composition of the corrosion products. Polished anode samples have also been examined for microstructural and corrosion performance studies. The experiments show that the duration of the plateau at 1600 mV/SHE, the potential level (active corrosion state/corrosion potential region) and the rate Delta E(corr)/Delta t during the decay could be a good indicator to compare the corrosion rates of the anodes in industrial zinc electrolytes.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			0008-4433			WOS:000272546300001

However, their development is suppressed by the poor catalytic properties of the air-electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Hence, the exploration of highly efficient electrocatalysts for neutral ZABs is critical. Herein, we designed an economical heterostructure of Pt nanoparticle-modified Zn nanoplates (Pt/Zn NPs). Compared with commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst, our Pt/Zn heterostructure exhibits comparable catalytic properties and ultrahigh stability in neutral media. The heterostructure can reduce the dosage of Pt and offer sufficient active sites, resulting in enhanced catalytic properties for ORR/OER in neutral media. When applied to neutral ZABs as air cathode, our heterostructure exhibits a high power density of 45 mW cm(-2) and excellent stability of more than 850 cycles with negligible decay, making it the most efficient and robust one in neutral electrolyte. This approach opens a new avenue to strategically design catalysts with high activity for neutral ZABs, rendering them potential in portable and wearable electronic devices.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000625912300001

Less attention has been paid to effects of different cathodic reactions on tribocorrosion behaviors. In this study, linear reciprocating sliding wear test of AISI 430 was carried out in distilled water and 0.5 mol/L sulfuric acid media, respectively. The results revealed that oxygen reduction reaction is in favor of oxide films forming on the surface, which increased subsurface hardness of the wear track. However, hydrogen evolution reaction restrained the formation of oxide films and induced hydrogen embrittlement, thus worsened the tribocorrosion properties and increased material removal. Interaction between wear and corrosion contributed most mass loss in the material deterioration, which was related to the reciprocating frequency.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000743881100002

Herein, we demonstrated a novel catalyst system of NiSe2-CoSe2 consisting of nanorods and nanoparticles for the efficient OER in the alkaline electrolyte. This catalyst system can be easily fabricated via a low-temperature selenization of the solvothermal synthesized NiCo(OH)(x) precursor and the unique morphology of hybrid nanorods and nanoparticles was found by the electron microscopy analysis. The high valence state of the metal species was indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study and a strong electronic effect was found in the NiSe2-CoSe2 catalyst system compared to their counterparts. As a result, NiSe2-CoSe2 exhibited high catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 250 mV to reach 10 mA.cm(-2) for OER in the alkaline solution. Furthermore, high catalytic stability and catalytic kinetics were also observed. The superior performance can be attributed to the high valence states of Ni and Co and their strong synergetic coupling effect between the nanorods and nanoparticles, which could accelerate the charge transfer and offer abundant electrocatalytic active sites. The current work offers an efficient hetero-structure catalyst system for OER, and the results are helpful for the catalysis understanding.									7	4	0	0	1	0	10			0254-5861			WOS:000781731100004

Herein, for the first time, a novel copper molybdenum oxynitride anchored nitrogen-doped graphene (CuMo2ON@NG) is synthesized by a simple, scalable, and cost-effective pyrolysis method. The rational design of CuMo2ON encased in NC shells anchored onto the NG matrix to enhance the electroactive sites and boost the electron-transport behaviors for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The optimal CuMo2ON@NG reveals tremendous trifunctional activities, outperform benchmark Pt/C and IrO2. First-principles calculations demonstrate that the excellent catalytic activity of CuMo2ON@NG is owing to the synergistic electron transfer between the active CuMo2ON nanoparticles, doped N species, and graphitic carbon. Formation of the O* intermediates on CuMo2ON lattice in the core-shell CuMo2ON@NG nanohybrid is an energetic rate-determining step to attain ORR and OER activities. The CuMo2ON@NG air-cathode based rechargeable quasi solid-state zinc-air battery delivers an ultra-high specific capacity of 736 mAh gzn(-1), an exceptional energy density of 800.75 Wh kg(-1), a record power density of 176.3 mW cm(-2), and excellent reversibility (330 h at 10 mA cm(-2)). Furthermore, the CuMo2ON@NG-based water splitting device achieves a cell voltage of 1.49 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent reversibility of 120 h at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2), outperforming the benchmark Pt/C parallel to IrO2 (similar to 1.53 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) and reported state-of-the-art catalysts.									34	1	0	0	2	0	34			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000663442200001

Interestingly, vdWH materials are also readily available from the Earth's lithosphere. Franckeite is a naturally-occurring misfit-layered vdWH, composed of Pb, Sn, Sb, Fe, and S. Teallite differs from franckeite by not containing Sb. Herein, naturally occurring sulfosalt materials, franckeite and teallite, undergo liquid-phase shear exfoliation, being examined for their structural and chemical properties. Subsequently, these exfoliated materials and their bulk counterparts are applied in electrocatalytic energy reactions. The results show the shear exfoliated teallite is the optimum sulfosalt for the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions. Finally, the shear-exfoliated franckeite shows improved hydrogen evolution performance in a wide pH range when compared to the remaining materials. This work demonstrates the promising potential of misfit-layered vdWH and layered sulfosalts as electrocatalysts for energy related applications.									15	0	0	0	4	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000444698200034

In this work, a series of high-entropy catalysts are synthesized by a chemical dealloying method and find the increased entropy effect and non-noble metal contents would facilitate the formation of complete oxides with low crystallinity. Importantly, an optimal eight-component high-entropy oxide (HEO, Al-Ni-Co-Ru-Mo-Cr-Fe-Ti) is identified, which exhibits further enhanced catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as compared to the previously reported quinary AlNiCoRuMo and the widely-used commercial RuO2 catalysts, and at the same time similar catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as the commercial Pt/C with a half-wave potential of 0.87 V. Such high-performance bi-functional catalysts, however, only require a half loading amount of Ru as compared to the quinary AlNiCoRuMo, due to the underlying Cr-Fe synergistic effects on tuning the electronic structures at active surface sites, as revealed by the first-principles density functional theory calculations of the authors. The eight-component HEO also demonstrates excellent stability under continuous electrochemical working conditions, suitable for a wide range of applications such as metal-air batteries.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000748269900001	35092348

Transition-metal oxides (TMOs) are cost-effective replacements to conventional noble metal catalysts for driving these electrochemical systems. Strain is known to greatly affect the electronic structure of TMO surfaces, leading to significant changes in their electrocatalytic activities. In this study, we explore the influence of strain on the OER and ORR mechanisms on the LaNiO3(001) surface using density functional theory (DFT). Through a comparison of the overpotential and the largest change in Gibbs free energy (DG) in the reaction pathway, we determined that the OER activity on the LaNiO3 surface is directly related to the desorption of-H from the surface, which can be tuned as a function of strain. Moreover, tensile strain shuts off the reaction pathway to forming the-O2H intermediate state, due to the dissociation of -O2H into -O-2 and-H. This is largely a consequence of the strong binding of H to the surface O, leading to a significant increase in the largest DG for the ORR on the tensile-strained surfaces by promoting an alternative reaction pathway. Overall, our results show that tensile strain on LaNiO3(001) leads to a decrease in both OER and ORR activities. Interestingly, in both cases, we find that the reaction is driven by the interactions with surface O ions, thus calling for a reinterpretation of the role that Ni eg orbital polarization plays in defining the OER and ORR catalytic activity on the TMO surfaces. Here, it is an indirect measure of changes in Ni-O hybridization, which controls the binding of-H species to the surface. As such, these results highlight the importance of surface O ions; particularly as it relates to defining molecule-surface interactions that ultimately tune and enhance the electrocatalytic efficiency of perovskite materials through the modulation of strains.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000461722700062	30335103

Cobalt nitride nanoflakes, high-performance bifunctional catalysts supported on nickel foam (Co-5.47 N NF/NF), were synthesized by hydrothermal and calcination method. The morphology and composition of the catalyst were studied by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, HRTEM and elemental analysis. In order to conduct electrochemical performance and stability, a two-electrode electrolyzer composed of Co-5.47 N NF/NF as both anode and cathode materials is constructed (Co-5.47 N NF/NF parallel to Co-5.47 N NF/NF). Only a voltage of 1.687 V is needed to complete 100 mA.cm(-2). It is much lower than the voltage of Pt/C parallel to IrO2 (1.816 V), because of which it is believed that this work provides a valuable route for the design of inexpensive and efficient urea electrolysis-assisted hydrogen generation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1793-2920	1793-7094		WOS:000505160900007

As a source of iron, K2FeO4 is employed, which is soluble under alkaline conditions in contrast to many other Fe salts. Immediately after reacting with the Pd foil, [FeO4](2-) causes a significant increase in OER and changes in the electrochemistry of Pd. In the absence of this Fe source and under OER, Pd(IV) is stable, and hole accumulation occurs, while in the presence of Fe this accumulation of stored charges can be used for OER. A Density Functional Theory (DFT) based thermodynamic model suggests an oxygen bridge vacancy as an active site on the surface of PdO2 and an OER overpotential of 0.42 V. A substitution of Pd with Fe at this active site reduces the calculated OER overpotential to 0.35 V. The 70 mV decrease in overpotential is in good agreement with the experimentally measured decrease of 60 mV in the onset potential. In the presence of small amounts of Fe salt, our results point toward the Fe doping of PdO2 rather than extra framework FeOx (Fe(OH)(3), FeO(OH), and KFeO2) species on top of PdO2 as the active OER sites.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000642344900029	33826338

The 3d transition metals, particularly, Ni and Co show better OER activity than others in alkaline medium. Ni and Co based oxygen-evolving catalysts (OECs) experience an enormous enhancement in the OER activity either by incidental or intentional Fe doping/incorporation. To account for this, different roles of Fe that it exerts when incorporated into these OECs are reported to be responsible. Unfortunately, the conclusions drawn in many related studies are often contradictory to one another. Important contradictory conclusions are: 1) a few studies claim Fe is the active site and Ni/Co are inactive while other studies claim Ni/Co and Fe act together in OER, 2) a few studies claim Fe3+ stays unoxidized while a few shows evidence for the existence of Fe4+, and 3) a few studies suggest Fe3+ is the faster site in Ni/Co OEC matrices for OER but fail to explain similar effects observed with other OER matrices. Many critical experimental and theoretical investigations have been made recently to reveal this magical Fe effect and the results of those studies are coherently presented here with critical discussion. This review is presented as it is inevitable to know the critical roles of Fe effect in Ni/Co based OECs to succeed in energy efficient hydrogen generation in alkaline medium.									185	6	0	0	6	0	186			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000618005500001

Here, 3D printed Ni (3DPNi) electrodes with highly controlled, periodic structures are reported that suppress gas bubble coalescence, jamming, and trapping and, hence, result in rapid bubble release. The 3DPNi electrodes decorated with carbon-doped NiO achieve a high current density of 1000 mA cm(-2)in 1.0mKOH electrolyte at hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction overpotentials of 245 and 425 mV, respectively. This work demonstrates a new approach to the deterministic design of 3D electrodes to facilitate rapid bubble transport and release to enhance the total electrode catalytic activity at commercially relevant current densities.									45	0	0	0	0	0	45			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000579137800001

The aim of the current work is to understand the active sites and stability of Ni12P5 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Activity and stability of the reaction sites on different low-index surfaces of Ni12P5, namely (001), (100), (110), (101), and (111) planes with different terminations, are studied using density functional theory calculations. The results show that the top P sites with a coordination number of 5 or 7 and some coplanar-bridged NiNi sites are favorable for HER, whereas hollow NiNiNi sites are not suitable. Among these active sites, the active Ni sites with higher coordination number are stable, whereas the active Ni atom with lower coordination number is unstable. This study supports the idea that catalytically active and chemically stable sites are not mutually exclusive. This finding has broadened the understanding of the root causes of electrocatalytic activity and stability of phosphides. Ideally, the (101) surface of Ni12P5 with P-rich termination should be prepared in the experiment for stable and active HERs.									7	1	0	0	1	0	7			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000474269800024

Herein, we report a novel hybrid nanomaterial of platinum-nickel hydroxide-nanotubes (Pt/Ni(OH)(2)/CNTs) for improving electrocatalytic performance in alkaline environments. Ni(OH)(2) was directly grown on functionalized nanotubes and then, Pt nanoparticles were in situ immobilized by the microwave synthesis method. Due to electronic and synergistic effects, 10:2-Pt/Ni(OH)(2)/N-CNT catalyst exhibited 2.77 times specific activity and 6.27 times mass activity toward methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), which were higher than those of commercial Pt/C in alkaline solution. The CO-stripping experiments and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) further demonstrated that Ni(OH)(2) could promote oxidation removal of carbonaceous poison for MOR via accelerating water dissociation: (i) Ni(OH)(2) acted on an H2O molecule, leading to the formation of OHad; (ii) OHad oxidized the intermediate COad to CO2. Furthermore, the 10:2-Pt/Ni(OH)(2)/N-CNT catalyst also exhibited 2.07 times specific activity and 1.67 times mass activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which were higher than those of commercial Pt/C in alkaline solution and Pt/N-CNT catalysts. Thus, the preparation of this hybrid nanomaterial provides a new direction for catalyst performance optimization towards next-generation fuel cells in alkaline environments.									23	2	0	0	1	0	23			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000435659400016	29863208	
J	Ahn, Sung Hoon; Manthiram, Arumugam				Manthiram, Arumugam/AAO-3331-2020				Cobalt Phosphide Coupled with Heteroatom-Doped Nanocarbon Hybrid Electroctalysts for Efficient, Long-Life Rechargeable Zinc-Air Batteries								SMALL				13	40					1702068	10.1002/smll.201702068				OCT 25 2017	2017	Metal phosphides and heteroatom-doped carbons have been regarded as promising candidates as bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, both have suffered from stability issues during repeated ORR and OER operations in zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, this study reports a versatile cobalt-based hybrid catalyst with a 1D structure by integrating the metal-organic framework-derived conversion approach and an in situ crosslinking method. Among them, the 1D hybrid catalyst composed of ultrasmall cobalt phosphide nanoparticles supported by nitrogen-, sulfur-, phosphorus-doped carbon matrix shows remarkable bifunctional activity close to that of the benchmark precious-metal catalysts along with an excellent durability in the full potential range covering both the OER and ORR. The overall overpotential of the rechargeable ZABs can be greatly reduced with this bifunctional hybrid catalyst as an air-electrode, and the cycling stability outperforms the commercial Pt/C catalyst. It is revealed that the cobalt phosphide nanoparticles are in situ converted to cobalt oxide under the accelerated conditions during OER (and/or ORR) of the ZABs and reduces the anodic current applied to the carbon. This contributes to the stability of the carbon material and in maintaining the high initial catalytic properties of the hybrid catalyst.									70	7	0	0	1	0	70			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000413416400016	28861942

The results were analyzed by several characterization means such as X-ray powder diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and nitrogen adsorption and desorption tests. The results indicated that the reasonable introduction of both Fe and S resulted in Fe3C/Fe-SAS@SNC catalysts with obvious graded porous structure and specific surface area of 673 m(2)/g, which exhibited excellent catalytic performance for oxygen reduction in both acid and alkaline electrolytes. In 0.1 mol/L KOH, the half-wave potential of the Fe3C/Fe-SAS@SNC was 0.880 V(vs. RHE), which is higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts, and exhibited better stability than commercial Pt/C. In addition, the Fe3C/Fe-SAS@SNC electrocatalytic oxygen reduction performance in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 is similarly comparable to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0251-0790			WOS:000862778500010

In contrast, the cathode has no storage material but catalyzes the conversion of oxygen to hydroxide and vice versa. Because the composition of the anode varies with the state of charge, the potential of the battery reflects the composition of the materials in the anode. H-2 evolution, corrosion, and zincate/ZnO formation occur at the anode during battery operation and have a negative effect on battery performance. Consequently, reducing these adverse reactions by manipulating one of the reaction parameters, such as the concentration of OH-, can improve performance. In addition, the influence of KOH concentrations ranging from 2.0 to 8.0 M on these reactions is studied. We found that 4.0 M KOH is the optimum concentration for both redox reactions (Zn2+/Zn) and suppression of the anode corrosion rate. However, the higher conductivity obtained with 6.0 M KOH is appropriate when a faster reaction is needed, including suppression of negative effects. In particular, suppression of ZnO formation is advantageous, decreasing both resistance and H-2 evolution in the cell.

Herein, we report novel CoCu-based bimetallic metal-organic framework nanoboxes (CoCu-MOF NBs) as promising catalysts toward efficient electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER), fabricated via a successive cation and ligand exchange strategy. With the highly exposed bimetal centers and the well-designed architecture, the CoCu-MOF NBs show excellent OER activity and stability, with a small overpotential of 271 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a high turnover frequency value of 0.326 s(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV. In combination of quasi in situ X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density-functional theory calculations, the post-formed CoCu-based oxyhydroxide analogue during OER is believed to account for the high OER activity of CoCu-MOF NBs, where the electronic synergy between Co and neighbouring Cu atoms promotes the O-O bond coupling toward fast OER kinetics.									28	1	0	0	1	0	28			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000714103600001	34661372

The electrocatalytic activity of the prepared 3DOM LSC perovskites was examined for both the oxygen reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using various electrochemical techniques in both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolyte solutions. The discharge capacity and cycle performance were also investigated with a lithium-air battery fabricated with the 3DOM LSC perovskite catalysts. It was found that the electrochemical study in both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolyte solutions and the performance measurement in the lithium-air battery exhibit a similar electrocatalytic activity in the order of Centrifuge LSC1000 > Pellet LSC1000 > Powder LSC1000. The best performance of a lithium-air battery is observed from Centrifuge LSC1000. The enhanced catalytic performance of the 3DOM structures could be reasonably attributed to the formation of porous structures with increased surface area and catalytic activity, which facilitate the fast reversible formation and decomposition of Li2O2 as well as quick transportation of lithium ions and oxygen in the lithium air cell.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15				2046-2069		WOS:000373685500076

Herein, a highly efficient method for CL preparation via fast current-driven synthesis followed by pyrolysis is proposed. Compared with previously reported fabrication procedures of zeolite imidazolate frameworks (ZIF)-based CLs, this method directly deposits the ZIF precursor onto the conductive substrate in a very short time (<= 15 min). The self-supporting CL, converted from ZIF membrane by simple single-step pyrolysis, is assembled with the gas diffusion layer to obtain cathode. Electrochemical tests exhibit a small potential gap (0.83 V) between the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, as well as high performance and excellent stability for Zn-air battery (241 mW cm(-2) at 390 mA cm(-2)), due to the unique design of a bi-continuous framework (interconnected pores and long carbon nanotubes) and Co-based active sites. This work may provide new directions for the fast fabrication of non-platinum group metal CLs for metal-air batteries or fuel cell applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000835891700001	35927031

Here, a fast and simple process is proposed for the fabrication of Mo2C-based electrocatalysts on a carbon cloth substrate by photonic flash synthesis (PFS) from MoO3/graphene precursor under an ambient atmosphere. SEM, XRD, and XPS results demonstrated the successful thermal decomposition of molybdenum oxides into a porous nanostructure of beta-Mo2C after exposing the precursor material to a 575 V lamp flash for four successive pulses. As a result, the as-prepared Mo2C@575 V-4p demonstrates a Tafel slope of 63 mV.dec(-1) and a low overpotential of similar to 160 and similar to 230 mV to drive 10 and 50 mA.cm(-2) in acidic media, respectively.

The exposed Pd (100) facet is considered to be the most selective of all other facets for the formation of ethylene, but it is unstable and the fine structure needs to be revealed during the reaction. Herein, the evolution of the surface structure of cubic Pd nanoparticles, which are all bound with (100) facets, was studied by transmission electron microscopy in the partial hydrogenation of acetylene. Furthermore, the relation between the varying surface structure and the activity/selectivity was correlated. The (100) facets of Pd were transformed into stepped facets during the reaction, derived by adsorption/desorption of the reactants and energy compensation, which was the main reason for the decrease in the selectivity towards ethylene.									8	2	0	0	0	0	9			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000411499300001

Herein, we report on the fine-tuning of water oxidation performance using solvothermal fabricated hierarchical nanostructured Co3O4 catalysts obtained from three different cobalt precursors. The prepared hierarchical Co3O4 nanostructured catalysts were intensively analyzed for their textural properties and surface chemistry, such as shape, size, phase and surface area. The water oxidation performance of all three catalysts through the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been investigated. In alkaline 1 M KOH aqueous solution, the ultrathin hierarchical Co3O4-S nanosheet array catalyst exhibits significantly higher activity during water oxidation, with a low overpotential of 330 mV vs. RHE at a benchmarking current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER in comparison with Co3O4-Ac and Co3O4-N, which outperforms a commercial RuO2 electrocatalyst, and it remains stable for many hours. Benefiting from its unique ultrathin architecture, hierarchical and nanostructured Co3O4-S is endowed with a large number of active sites and a rapid charge transfer process, resulting in better water oxidation performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000620730300020

The Raman spectrum proves that both Ce(OH)(3) and Ce doping exist in Ce-modified Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles. The heterostructure possesses an open nanosheet structure, with a good interaction between Ni-MOF and Ce-m-Ni(OH)(2), which enables efficient mass/charge transfer and the synergetic effect between Ni and Ce, leading to a high-performance electrocatalyst. Specifically, Ce-m-Ni(OH)(2)@Ni-MOF achieves current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 219 and 272 mV, respectively, and retains high activity for at least 30 h.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000839633200001	35960017

The calculated binding energy of a Ru-13 nanoparticle on a single vacancy graphene is as high as -7.41 eV, owing to the hybridization between the dsp states of the Ru particles with the sp(2) dangling bonds at the defect sites. Doping the defective graphene with boron would further increase the binding energy to -7.52 eV. The strong interaction results in the averaged d-band center of the deposited Ru nanoparticle being upshifted toward the Fermi level from -1.41 eV to -1.10 eV. Further study reveals that the performance of the nanocomposites against hydrogen, oxygen and carbon monoxide adsorption is correlated to the shift of the d-band center of the nanoparticle. Thus, Ru nanoparticles deposited on defective graphene are expected to exhibit both high stability against sintering and superior catalytic performance in hydrogenation, oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction.									57	3	0	0	1	0	57			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000299054200026	22134739

Herein, we developed a series of electrocatalysts with a formal composition of V1-xCoxB2 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2) and employed them in an oxygen-evolving reaction. The incorporation of Co into the VB2 structure caused a dramatic transformation in the morphology, resulting in a super low overpotential of 200 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for V0.9Co0.1B2 and displaying much greater performance compared to the noble-metal catalyst RuO2 (290 mV). The longevity of the best-performing sample was assessed through the exposure to the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), showing relative durability after 12 h under 1 M KOH conditions. The Faradaic efficiency tests corroborated the initiation of OER at 1.45 V (vs RHE) and suggested a potential region of 1.50-1.55 V (vs RHE) as the practical OER region. The facile electron transfer between metal(s)metalloid, high specific surface area, and availability of active oxy-hydroxy species on the surface were identified as the major contributors to this superior OER performance.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000753447800097	34855373

Among them, transition metal oxyhydroxides show excellent performance in oxygen evolution reactions (OER), but there are certain difficulties in direct preparation. Recently, Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as precatalysts or precursors have shown promising catalytic performance in OER and can be decomposed under alkaline conditions. Therefore, using a mild and controllable way to convert MOFs into oxyhydroxides and retaining the original structural advantages is crucial for improving the catalytic activity. Herein, a rapid electrochemical strategy is used to activate well-mixed MOFs to prepare Co/Ni oxyhydroxide nanosheets for efficient OER catalysts, and the structural transformation in this process was investigated in detail by using scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical methods. It is discovered that electrochemical activation can promote ligand substitution of well-mixed MOFs to form porous oxyhydroxide nanosheets and tune the electronic structure of the metal (Co and Ni), which can lead to more active site exposure and accelerate charge transfer. In addition, the change of structure also improves hydrophilicity, as well as benefiting from the strong synergistic effect between multiple species, the optimal a-MCoNi-MOF/NF has excellent OER performance and long-term stability. More obviously, the porous CoNiOOH nanosheets are formed in situ during electrochemical activation process through structural transformation and acts as the active centers. This work provides new insights for mild synthesis of MOFs derivatives and also provides ideas for the preparation of highly efficient catalysts.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The efficiency and viability of these technologies heavily rely on active and stable electrocatalysts. Basic research to develop superior electrocatalysts is commonly performed in conventional electrochemical setups such as a rotating disk electrode (RDE) configuration or H-type electrochemical cells. These experiments are easy to set up; however, there is a large gap to real electrochemical conversion devices such as fuel cells or electrolyzers. To close this gap, gas diffusion electrode (GDE) setups were recently presented as a straightforward technique for testing fuel cell catalysts under more realistic conditions. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a GDE setup for measuring the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of catalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). Using a commercially available benchmark IrO2 catalyst deposited on a carbon gas diffusion layer (GDL), it is shown that key parameters such as the OER mass activity, the activation energy, and even reasonable estimates of the exchange current density can be extracted in a realistic range of catalyst loadings for PEMWEs. It is furthermore shown that the carbon-based GDL is not only suitable for activity determination but also short-term stability testing. Alternatively, the GDL can be replaced by Ti-based porous transport layers (PTLs) typically used in commercial PEMWEs. Here a simple preparation is shown involving the hot-pressing of a Nafion membrane onto a drop-cast glycerol-based ink on a Ti-PTL.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17				2691-3704		WOS:000651113200002	34467289

To achieve this, nanoliter ink volumes containing Ni and Fe chlorides as catalyst precursors are rapidly printed on large-scale carbon nanotube-coated glassy carbon electrodes and exposed to millisecond-long high intensity light pulses from a Xenon flash lamp. The carbon nanotube coating acts as light-to-heat absorber generating surface peak temperatures of several hundred degrees. The light-induced reduction of the Ni and Fe precursors into chloride-free mixed metal composites is facilitated by alcohols that act as sacrificial electron donors in the printed precursor films. Besides the merging of large-scale electrode production and nanoparticle synthesis into a single robust and rapid process, the adjustability of the precursor ratios using parallel printheads, the operation under ambient conditions, the absence of capping agents as well as surfactants, and the up-scalability to industrial levels are the major advantages of this new electrode fabrication method. Furthermore, the process is superior to standard lab-scale electrocatalyst deposition methods, such as drop casting, and is more flexible to control compared to hydro- and solvothermal syntheses. The electrochemical characterization of the Ni- and NiFe-based nanoelectrocatalysts by voltammetric cycling leads to onset potentials as low as 240 mV (at 0.1 mA.cm(-2)), overpotentials of 334 mV (at 10 mA.cm(-2)), Tafel slopes of 41 mV.dec(-1), and high turnover frequencies of up to 6.5 s(-1) for the oxygen evolution reaction.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2574-0962			WOS:000487770000026

Herein, we report the synthesis of two types of two-dimensional monometallic cobalt hydroxide nanoplates in aqueous solution for OER: alpha-Co(OH)(2) with both Co-Td(2+) and Co-Oh(2+) Oh sites and beta-Co(OH)(2) with Co-Oh(2+) sites. Electrochemical characterization reveals that alpha-Co(OH)(2) is more active than beta-Co(OH)(2) towards OER. The better activity can be attributed to the presence of Co-Td(2+) sites in alpha-Co(OH)(2), which are more active than Co-Oh(2+) sites. Our finding clarifies the contribution of the two catalytic sites and helps future rational design of high-performance OER electrocatalysts.									47	0	0	0	0	0	47			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000408696500003	28530739

However, the complexity of iridium oxide's electronic structure makes it particularly difficult to experimentally determine the chemical state of the active surface species. To achieve an accurate understanding of the electronic structure of iridium oxide surfaces, we have combined synchrotron-based X-ray photoemission and absorption spectroscopies with ab initio calculations. Our investigation reveals a pre-edge feature in the O K-edge of highly catalytically active X-ray amorphous iridium oxides that we have identified as O 2p hole states forming in conjunction with Ir-III. These electronic defects in the near-surface region of the anionic and cationic framework are likely critical for the enhanced activity of amorphous iridium oxides relative to their crystalline counterparts.									216	3	0	0	18	0	216			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000369506000002	26700139

A NiOx buffer layer and a first annealing in a reducing environment were adopted to control the interdiffusion and oxidation of the substrates. It was found that a second annealing in oxygen using a rapid thermal annealing furnace would strongly affect the electrical properties of the BTO thin films, especially the leakage current density. The leakage current density with the optimized annealing condition can be reduced by about two orders of magnitude. The correlation between the second annealing conditions and leakage current densities was established. Mechanisms of the leakage and impacts from the oxygen vacancies and interface evolution have been discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) is oxidized in a linear four-step photocatalytic cycle in which chloride is required for the OEC to advance beyond the S-2 state. Here, using density functional theory, we compare the energetics and spin configuration of two different states of the Mn4CaO5 cluster in the S-2 state: state A with Mn1(3+) and B with Mn4(3+) with and without chloride. The calculations suggest that model B with an S = 5/2 ground state occurs in the chloride -depleted PSII, which may explain the presence of the EPR signal at g = 4.1. Moreover, we use multiconformer continuum electrostatics to study the effect of chloride depletion on the redox potential associated with the S-1/S-2, and S-2/S-3 transitions.									21	0	0	0	10	0	21			1520-6106			WOS:000375968900006	27077688

The structure and reaction mechanism of IspH have been actively investigated in Escherichia coli but little is known in plants. Compared with the bacterial IspH, cyanobacterial and plant HDRs all contain an extra N-terminal conserved domain (NCD) that is essential for their function. Tyr72 in the NCD and several plant-specific residues around the central active site are critical for Arabidopsis HDR function. These results suggest that the structure and reaction mechanism of HDR/IspH may be different between plants and bacteria. The E. coli IspH is an iron-sulfur protein that is sensitive to oxygen. It is possible that the cyanobacterial HDR may independently evolve from the common ancestor of prokaryotes to obtain the NCD, which may protect the enzyme from high concentration of oxygen during photosynthesis.									8	1	0	0	7	0	9			1559-2316	1559-2324		WOS:000372112300014	25723575

To reduce the use of precious metal and modulate the local environment by oxygen vacancies, Pd-Co nanoalloys supported on TiO2 with oxygen vacancies (Vo) are prepared through a facile pyrolysis approach. The superior ORR performance is obtained comparing to the commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) catalysts in alkaline solution. Moreover, the catalyst has amazing catalytic activity for NRR. The synergistic effect of Pd-Co alloys and the Vo greatly improves the yield of NH3 (4.11 mu g/(h.cm2)) and the Faradaic efficiency (2.83%). The performance of small molecular reduction is enhanced by the strong metalsupport interactions (SMSI), which agree with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations results. It is anticipated that the established nanoalloy electrocatalysts with modulation of metal-support interactions provide guidance for designing heterogeneous electrocatalysts with high efficiency.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000691175400003

For safety management of tritiated water storage, it is essential to be able to predict pressure increase resulting from this phenomenon. The present study aims to identify the mechanisms that take place in self-radiolysis of chemically pure liquid tritiated water. The evolution of the concentration of hydrogen and oxygen in the gas phase of closed vessels containing tritiated water has been followed experimentally. Simulation of pure water radiolysis has been carried out using data from the literature. In order to fit experimental results, simulation should take into account gas phase recombination reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. A simplified system has been extracted from the complete chemical system used to simulate radiolysis. This system allows identifying the basic mechanisms that are responsible for tritiated water self-radiolysis.					7th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology7th International Conference on Tritium Science and Technology	SEP 12-17, 2004SEP 12-17, 2004		Baden Baden, GERMANYBaden Baden, GERMANY	15	0	1	0	1	0	16			1536-1055			WOS:000230433300148

Here, we report a highly active and stable Pt nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) carbon layers derived from the ultrathin 2D metal-organic framework precursor (ZIF-67). Electrochemical tests reveal that our approach not only stabilized Pt NPs successfully but also boosted Pt activities toward ORR and HER We found that our Pt catalysts encapsulated in ultrathin 2D carbon layers exhibited an ORR activity of 5.9 and 12 times greater than those of the commercial Pt/C and Pt/RGO without 2D carbon layer protection. Our encapsulated Pt catalysts also show more than nine times higher stability than those of Pt/C catalysts. In addition to ORR, our novel encapsulated Pt catalysts display an extraordinary stability and activity toward HER, with a lower overpotential (14.3 mV in acidic media and 37.2 mV in alkaline media) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) than Pt/C catalysts (23.1 mV in acidic media and 92.1 mV in alkaline media). The enhanced electrochemical activities and stability of our encapsulated Pt catalysts are attributed to the synergistic effect of Pt-based NPs and ultrathin 2D carbon layers derived from ZIF-67 with enriched active sites Co-N-x. First-principles simulations reveal that the synergistic catalysis of Pt-based NPs and Co-N-x derived from ZIF-67 improves the activity for ORR and HER.									27	0	0	0	2	0	27			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000518702300028	32019299

Cellulose, as the main component of biomass-based solid waste, was evaluated in the CLG process with NiO/Ca2Fe2O5 prepared by the impregnation method. Reaction mechanism and morphology evolution of the OC as well as the influence of key reaction parameters were investigated by fixed-bed reactor and thermogravimetric analysis experiments coupled with various characterization techniques. The results indicated that the addition of Ni not only improved the oxygen release performance of Ca2Fe2O5 but also helped tar cracking and carbon conversion. On the other hand, the excellent activity in the solid-solid reaction of Ca2Fe2O5 promoted the performance of the Ni-based OC. The test results revealed that Ca2Fe2O5 was a better base than CaFe2O4, and the carbon conversion efficiency reached 98% with the OC sample at 850 degrees C. NiO markedly improved the reactivity of Ca2Fe2O5 after 10 cyclic reactions. The temperature notably affected activity below temperatures of 850 degrees C and slightly above. Due to the limited reduction of Ca2Fe2O5 below 800 degrees C and the redox behavior improvement being minor above 850 degrees C, the temperature of 850 degrees C was marked as the optimum for the studied process Addition of water inhibited OC inactivation in cyclic reactions, which was mainly attributed to the crystal separation and agglomeration of OC particles. However, water inhibited the deep reduction of metal on the surface, which reduced the activity on tar cracking and carbon conversion to a certain extent.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000862854800004

Amorphous materials have short-range atomic ordering while their crystalline counterparts have both short and long-range ordering. Traditional synthesis of amorphous materials, involving quenching from high temperatures is unsuitable as it results in less porosity and surface area. In this context, room-temperature syntheses of high surface area amorphous materials with high activity are desirable. Here, we contrast two electrochemical synthesis procedures for generating high surface area amorphous Co3O4 at room temperature via electrochemical ion intercalation/deintercalation and surface oxidation/reduction cycles and evaluate their performance for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In the first approach, Li-ion is used for the intercalation/deintercalation (Li/D-Li) cycles in Co3O4, which leads to expansion and contraction of structure, inducing amorphization of Co3O4 by the pulverization of crystal structure in non-aqueous medium. In the second approach, rapid electrochemical surface oxidation/reduction (Ox/Red) of Co3O4 in the aqueous medium leads to the formation of a metastable amorphous structure. The OER specific activity (activity per unit electrochemical surface area) for Li/D-Li-Co3O4 is similar to 3.5 times and Ox/Red- Co3O4 induced amorphization is similar to 2.5 times higher than their crystalline Co3O4. The superior OER metrics of both the room-temperature amorphization techniques are rationalized via the increase in the ratio of Co2+/Co3+ obtained from the Co-2p XPS spectra. Further, the decrease in overall polarization resistance per site for the OER reaction for both amorphous samples were analyzed from the Tafel plot and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In Li/D-Li-Co3O4, the Li-ion intercalation in bulk Co3O4 structure generates higher bulk-oxygen vacancies leading to higher conductivity and reduction in overall charge-transport resistance for electrocatalyst. On the other hand, Ox/Red- induced amorphization is restricted to the surface or near-surface only with the formation of a small amount of metallic Co which hampers the OER.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2196-0216			WOS:000481471800023

WATER RESEARCH				128				393	401		10.1016/j.watres.2017.10.018				JAN 1 2018	2018	The combination of persulfates (peroxydisulfate (PDS) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS)) and electrolysis using boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode is a promising green advanced oxidation process. In comparison with electrolysis alone, electrochemical activation of persulfates at BDD anode considerably enhanced the degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ). The experimental results indicate that the surface adsorbed hydroxyl radical (HO.) played the dominant role. The generally proposed nonradical oxidation mechanism ignored hydroxyl radical (HO.) oxidation because low concentration of radical scavenger (<10 M methanol or 5 M tertbutanol) could not effectively scavenge the surface-adsorbed HO'. The quasi steady-state concentration of HO center dot was estimated to be about 5.0-9.1 x 10(-12) M for electrolysis with BDD anode, and it was increased to 1.1-1.6 x 10(-11) M and 3.2-5.0 x 10(-11) M for addition of 5 mM PDS and PMS, respectively. The results of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry as well as evolution of dissolved oxygen (DO) reveal that the electrochemically activated persulfates molecule (PDS*/PMS*) promoted the production of HO center dot via water dissociation at BDD anode and enhanced the direct electron transfer (DET) reaction, which otherwise inhibited the oxygen evolution side reaction. Therefore, higher current efficiency was achieved in electrochemical activation of persulfates process compared with electrolysis process. Additionally, the transformation products of CBZ were also investigated and their formation pathways were proposed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, the influence of substrate-induced strain on the electrocatalytic properties of nickel oxide (NiO) films toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is studied. Using pulsed laser deposition, NiO thin films were deposited on strontium titanate, lanthanum aluminate, and sapphire substrates to examine how the substrate-film lattice mismatch influences the electrochemical properties. It was observed that the electrocatalytic activities of the NiO thin films exhibited strong sensitivity to strain; the NiO film with the smallest strain recorded the lowest overpotential for the HER. The NiO films were further explored to estimate the charge storage capacity and surface roughness. This work shows the use of simple thin-film synthesis as a way to evaluate the strain effect in electmcatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0921-5107	1873-4944		WOS:000819940600006

J	Zhang, Xiaoshuang; Su, Hui; Du, Xiaoqiang								A nickel molybdenum oxide nanoarray as an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for overall water splitting								NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				44	20			8176	8182		10.1039/d0nj01232g				MAY 28 2020	2020	Water splitting has been recognized as an important and promising solution for generating sustainable energy by electricity to mitigate environmental pollution and energy crisis, but the water splitting reaction is greatly hindered by the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is very important to develop efficient and stable catalysts in order to solve the problem of instability and poor activity of electrodes. Therefore, NiMoO4 nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies were prepared by the reduction of sodium borohydride to explore the relationship between the existence of oxygen defects and water splitting activity. Experimental characterization and density functional theory suggest that the NiMoO4 nanosheets with more oxygen vacancies (b-NiMoO4/NF) show superior water splitting activity and stability owing to smaller resistance, higher electrochemical surface area, higher adsorption energy of H2O molecules and smaller Gibbs free energy for hydrogen. Moreover, the b-NiMoO4/NF nanosheets electrode shows an enhanced water splitting performance with a low cell voltage of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which is smaller than that for untreated NiMoO4/NF(1.65 V) (a-NiMoO4/NF). This work revealed the relationship between the existence of oxygen defects and water splitting activity, providing new concepts for the development of efficient and robust catalysts.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000537294300002

This system displayed strong metal-support interactions, high concentration of oxygen vacancies, and PdPt NP were similar to 2 nm in size. By optimizing the loading of PdPt, both the photo- and electrocatalytic activities were improved compared to commercial materials. Interestingly, a volcano plot was obtained from the activity and the PdPt composition, and the Pd0.22P0.78-TiO2/C sample afforded the optimal performance. For instance, the amount of hydrogen produced from water splitting was 11.6 mmol/g(catalyst). For the ORR, the activity was similar to a commercial Pt catalyst, but a lower E-onset (0.87 V-RHE vs w 0.95 V-RHE) was detected. The variations in the activities with the composition correlated well with the variations in the electronic effects and the concentration of oxygen vacancies.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000552015900021

The non-free radical pathway is preferable because it is less affected by the wastewater environment, yet little is known about its origin. Here, we exploit Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) layered perovskite oxides as an excellent platform for investigating the structure-property relationship for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation in AOPs. The atomic-level interaction of the perovskite and rock salt layers in RP oxides stabilizes the transition metals at low valences, causing the formation of abundant lattice oxygen/interstitial oxygen species. Unlike oxygen vacancies in conventional perovskites, which promote free-radical generation, these reactive oxygen species in RP perovskites have high activity and mobility and facilitate the formation of non-free radical singlet oxygen. This singlet oxygen reaction pathway is optimized by tailoring the oxygen species, leading to the discovery of LaSrCo0.8Fe0.2O4 with exceptionally efficient PMS activation.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2168-0485			WOS:000746653800001

However, many challenges remain in obtaining high-purity H-2 and making large-scale production cost-effective. This study provides a strategy for integrating a two-cell water electrolysis system with solar energy storage. In our proposed system, CuO-Cu(OH)(2)/Cu2O was used as a redox mediator between oxygen and hydrogen evolution components. The system not only overcame the gas-mixing issue but also showed high gas generation performance. The redox reaction (charge/discharge) of CuO-Cu(OH)(2)/Cu2O led to a significant increase (51%) in the initial rate of H-2 production from 111.7 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2) in the dark to 168.9 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2) under solar irradiation. The effects of light on the redox reaction of CuO-Cu(OH)(2)/Cu2O during water electrolysis were investigated by in situ X-ray absorption and photoemission spectroscopy. These results suggest that surface oxygen vacancies are created under irradiation and play an important role in increased capacitance and gas generation. These findings provide a new path to direct storage of abundant solar energy and low-cost sustainable hydrogen production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2470-1343			WOS:000697781900032	34368552	
J	Niu, Xin; Shen, Laihong								Evolution of carbon and nitrogen during chemical looping gasification of rapeseed cake with Ca-Fe oxygen carrier								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				431						134232	10.1016/j.cej.2021.134232				MAR 1 2022	2022	Rapeseed cake (RC) is an attractive fuel for its high caloricity, but the high-nitrogen content seriously hinders its utilization. Meanwhile, chemical looping gasification (CLG) is a promising technology for the production of N2 free high-quality syngas. Inspired by using RC as a source of C for syngas production, it also can be a possible source of N and H for the sustainable production of NH3. Hence, recycling N and H from RC via CLG was proposed for NH3 production. This paper evaluates the effects of oxygen carrier (CaFe2O5 (CaFe) and 60% Fe2O3/Al2O3 (FeAl)) on kinetic parameters, as well as the evolutions of carbon and nitrogen during CLG of rapeseed cake using TG-FTIR. Results show that the gasification behavior is remarkably influenced by oxygen carrier at both devolatilization and char reaction stages. CaFe shows a remarkably higher reduction activity compared to FeAl, especially at char reaction stage. The superior activity of CaFe can be also reflected in the lower activation energy compared to FeAl. As regards to nitrogen emission, NH3 and HCN are the dominant nitrogen species, whereas HNCO is minor. Meanwhile, the migration of nitrogen includes catalytic pyrolysis and oxidation by lattice oxygen (O*). It is feasible to control the migration path of nitrogen by adjusting the operating conditions. Thus, CLG is an attractive pathway for efficiently utilizing rapeseed cake, which can not only produce tunable syngas, but also possibly make the most use of nitrogen as valuable chemicals.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000784267300006

To this end, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism for the water oxidation reaction is vital. Herein, a surfactant, nonafluoro-1-butanesulfonate (FBS), was introduced into Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-FBS/CFP) via electrochemical deposition on the surface of a carbon fiber paper (CFP) substrate. The as-prepared NiFe-FBS/CFP electrode exhibited excellent catalytic activities for OER compared to the Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide based electrode (NiFe-LDH/CFP), an excellent stability of 15 h, and an ultralow Tafel slope of 25.8 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, by combining the results of pH-dependent kinetics investigations, chemical probing, proton inventory studies, and isotopic and atom-protontransfer measurements, it was observed that a proton-transfer process controls the reaction rates of both the NiFe-LDH and NiFe-FBS catalysts, and the residual sulfonate groups serve as proton transfer mediator to accelerate the proton transfer rate.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000734145500002

Because of the benefits of using of pre-oxidized ilmenite and the activation of the ilmenite during the redox cycles, the reactivity of both the pre-oxidized and activated ilmenite was analyzed. The experimental tests were carried out in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), using H-2, CO or CH4 as reducing gases, and O-2 for the oxidation step. Thus, the reactivity with the main reacting gases was analyzed when natural gas, syngas or coal are used as fuels in a CLC system. The changing grain size model (CGSM) was used to predict the evolution with time of the solid conversion and to determine the kinetic parameters. In most cases, the reaction was controlled by chemical reaction in the grain boundary. In addition, to predict the behaviour of the oxidation during the first redox cycle of pre-oxidized ilmenite, a mixed resistance between chemical reaction and diffusion in the solid product was needed. The kinetic parameters of both reduction and oxidation reactions of the pre-oxidized and activated ilmenite were established. The reaction order for the main part of the reduction reactions of pre-oxidized and activated ilmenite with H-2, CO, CH4 and O-2 was n=1, being different (n=0.8) for the reaction of activated ilmenite with CO. Activation energies from 109 to 165 kJ mol(-1) for pre-oxidized ilmenite and from 65 to 135 kJ mol(-1) for activated ilmenite were found for the different reactions with H-2, CO and CH4. For the oxidation reaction activation energies found were lower, 11 kJ mol(-1) for pre-oxidized and 25 kJ mol(-1) for activated ilmenite.Finally, simplified models of the fuel and air reactors were used to do an assessment of the use of ilmenite as an oxygen carrier in a CLC system. The reactor models use the reaction model in the particle and the kinetic parameters obtained in this work. Taking in to account for its oxygen transport capacity, the moderated solids inventory and the low cost of the material, ilmenite presents a competitive performance against synthetic oxygen carriers when coal or syngas are used as fuel.

The adsorbates, quinone molecules, can achieve a well-defined surface coverage on a range of carbon substrates through one step of soaking. Upon electrochemical reduction, the adsorbates can function as surface-confined reductants to reduce metal cations for uniform anchorage of metal nanoparticles on carbon, which is not easily achievable via other electrochemical deposition. We apply the method to deposition of Ag and Pt and show the close correspondence between the coverage of the adsorbate and the amount of deposition as well as the dependence of the deposit structures on the quinone molecular structures. We further demonstrate the stability and the catalytic activity of the deposited Pt for catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000557375200051

However, high-performance oxide-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution are quite limited, and the mechanism still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate the strong correlations between the electronic structure and hydrogen electrocatalytic activity within a single oxide system Ti2O3. Taking advantage of the epitaxial stabilization, the polymorphism of Ti2O3 is extended by stabilizing bulk-absent polymorphs in the film-form. Electronic reconstructions are realized in the bulk-absent Ti2O3 polymorphs, which are further correlated to their electrocatalytic activity. We identify that smaller charge-transfer energy leads to a substantial enhancement in the electrocatalytic efficiency with stronger hybridization of Ti 3d and O 2p orbitals.

Ni-Fe coatings on nickel foam were prepared by direct current (DC) and pulse current (PC) electrodeposition. The influence of different plating conditions and composition of the electrolyte on the morphology of the samples was studied. It was found that under DC electrodeposition, iron is dominant in the coating. Under PC plating conditions, Ni is the dominant element in Ni-Fe coatings. Ni-Fe coatings prepared under DC electrodeposition provide an effective catalyst in zero-gap electrolysis. Increasing Fe content in the coatings improves the catalytic activity of Ni-Fe catalyst. The study of convenient parameters of PC electrodeposition seems to be complex to reach a highly active surface area.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000779611400001

Here, a multi-layered NF/NiCo2O4/Co3S4 nanocomposite was prepared on 3D porous nickel foam by hydrothermal and annealing processes. The electrode is a multi-layered, highly conductive and high specific surface area network without a binder, which facilitates electron transport and exposure of active sites, enhances full contact of the electrolyte/electrode interface, and accelerates H-2 and O-2 diffusion during water electrolysis. As expected, NF/NiCo2O4/Co3S4 exhibits surprising electrocatalytic activity, and only required 71 and 170 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively, and exhibited stability up to 36 h. This strategy provides an efficient, durable, and low-cost bifunctional catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000850519500001	36069325

Herein, we report that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of Co3S4 under neutral conditions can be enhanced by exposed octahedral planes and self-adapted spin states in atomically thin nanosheets. A HAADF image clearly confirmed that the active octahedra with Jahn-Teller distortions were exposed exclusively. Most importantly, in the atomically thin nanosheets, the spin states of Co3+ in the octahedral self-adapt from low-spin to high-spin states. As a result, the synergistic effect endow the Co3S4 nanosheets with superior OER performance, with exceptional low onset over-potentials of circa 0.31 V in neutral solutions, which is state-of-the- art among inorganic non-noble metal compounds.									233	16	0	0	12	0	236			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000363389400045	26235387

The lowest energy transition in the previously unilluminated zeolite is a charge transfer which excites an oxygen lone-pair electron to the silver species coordinated by the zeolite and initiates the oxidation of water. Investigation of the spectral sensitivity shows that self-sensitization takes place: as the reaction proceeds, the sensitivity ''tends initially from the near-UV-visible wavelengths to the red range. We have developed a technique for the preparation of monograin zeolite layers and have been able to demonstrate the self-sensitization of photo-oxygen evolution on these samples. The self-sensitization is a quantum size effect in which, during the photoreaction, new chromophores are produced with bathochromically shifted absorption. The total amount of zeolite irradiated was 70 mug, coated as a thin layer on a quartz window. This is 10(3) times less than in earlier investigations. Therefore a new experimental technique was developed based on a very small reaction volume.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			1010-6030			WOS:A1992KD11500010

Herein, we focus on the potential of the two-dimensional (2D) ternary chalcogenide Ni2SbTe2 monolayer as a high-performance electrocatalyst for the ORR using density function theory. Our computed results reveal that there are an obvious hybridization and electron transfer between the O 2p and Te 5p orbitals, which can activate the adsorbed oxygen and trigger the whole ORR process, with an overpotential as low as 0.33 V. In addition, the adsorption capacity of the monolayer surface for oxygen molecules can be effectively enhanced by doping with Fe or Co atoms. The Ni2SbTe2 monolayers doped with Fe or Co atoms not only maintain their original excellent ORR catalytic activity but also improve selectivity toward the four-electron (4e) reduction pathway. We highly anticipate that this work can provide excellent candidates and new ideas for designing low-cost and high-performance ORR catalysts to replace noble metal Pt-based catalysts in fuel cells.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000745899800001	35044752

The X-ray absorption near edge and extended X-ray absorption fine structure studies of the metal K-edge, characterize the metal oxidation state, metal-oxygen bond distance, metal-metal distance, and degree of disorder of the catalysts. These properties guide the coordination environment of the transition metal oxide radical that localizes surface holes and is required to oxidize water. The catalysts are investigated both as-prepared, in their native state, and under reaction conditions, while transition metal oxide radicals are generated. The findings of many experiments are summarized in tables.

The mechanism of MnO reduction has been investigated. Noncontact metallization of MnO was carried out in vacuo under high argon pressure with metals having different melting points and sublimation pressures, such as Mg, Ti, Zr, and Al. Under these conditions, the reduction of MnO proceeded by a dissociative mechanism. The application of an oxygen-probe method permitted the study of the change in oxygen content of the gas phase during the reduction in the presence of gaseous products of the carbothermal metallization of MnO. The effect of some kinetic factors on the evolution of oxygen from MnO in the gas phase was established. Reduction during contact and noncontact metallization of MnO was found to proceed by a dissociative mechanism. This confirms the results obtained from slightly metallized PbO, Cu2O, CuO and iron oxides.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0324-1130			INSPEC:1808857

In this line, electrochemical water splitting that involves hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER, respectively) is considered to be the greener and most effective hydrogen-generating procedure with only water as a by-product. However, in the process of successful OER/HER, it is extremely demanding for electrocatalysts with high activity, stability and cost-effectiveness for the water splitting process. Herein, the review proposed promising electrocatalysts such as conductive polymers (CPs) with enhanced catalytic effect with the polymer encapsulation of catalytic material that provides an increase in charge transfer kinetics both in OER/HER. Also, the review highlights the OER and HER mechanism of conducting polymers and their effect on the synergism was discussed in detail. Also, the review detailed the reduced overpotentials, importance and enhancement of catalytic efficiency with various polymers reported in both OER and HER. Here, the choice of polymers can matrix with the inorganic active sites to prevent them from aggregation and the water splitting carried out over the electrode surface results in good conductivity to charge transfer from the electrode to the active sites. In addition, the review discussed the polymers induces the photon effect with photoelectrocatalytic water splitting. Thus, the combing effect with conducting polymers and the materials with catalytic active centers open up a new kind of electrocatalyst for synthesis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000864009400001

FEXSI ELECTROCHEMICAL KINETICS AND CORROSION BEHAVIOR								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				138	4			941	951		10.1149/1.2085751				APR 1991	1991	The corrosion and passivation behavior of ferrosilicide (Fe(x)Si) alloys has been studied in borate and phthalate buffers, as a function of alloy composition (0-30 mass percent (m/o) Si) using voltammetry and a (scraped) ratating ring-disk electrode (RRDE). In the previous paper, preferential oxidation of the silicon component of the alloy was predicted thermodynamically to produce an (amorphous) SiO2 surface phase at potentials more negative than required for oxidation of iron. At higher potentials the formation of Fe2SiO4 from elemental iron and SiO2/Si(IV) species was predicted, though kinetic experiments reported here showed no evidence for its existence, indicating that the separate oxidation of the iron and silicon components was preferred. For 0-15.8 m/o Si ferrosilicon alloy compositions, passivation was shown to be due to a thin silica-rich Fe(III) oxide film, characterization of which is reported in the subsequent paper. The presence of this film did not significantly affect the rate of hydrogen evolution, but it did greatly decrease the rate of anodic dissolution and open-circuit corrosion. Oxygen reduction occurred under transport control at low mass transport rates and involved 2 rather than 4 mol e- per mol O2; at higher transport rates/oxygen concentrations, the reaction occurred under mixed control, probably due to the presence of the oxide film, even at -0.9V. A Pt ring -Fe3Si disk electrode was used to detect Fe(II) species either directly at high potentials by oxidation of Fe2+/FeOH+ ions, or indirectly at low potentials by monitoring the hydrogen evolution current changes resulting from local modulation of the pH due to the disk electrode reaction.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			0013-4651			WOS:A1991FF27000011

Density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicated that strong dispersion from the hybridized In 5s and 5p orbitals at the bottom of the conduction band (CB) was considered to contribute to the high activity of photocatalyst Sm2InNbO7.

The mechanism is unclear on the sequence of proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) in photocatalytic water dissociation catalyzed by organic material. Here, the water splitting catalyzed by zinc porphyrin with boron dipyrrin (ZnPP-BDP) is systematically investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The H2O/ZnPP in valence state based on the electron transfer pulls the trigger on the water splitting process. For the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) step on ZnPP, the processes for the two H ions dissociate from water are exothermic with the -1.06 and -0.95 eV energies respectively, and the O/ZnPP system is formed. The second H2O molecule on O/ZnPP system can provide the extra oxygen atom to produce the free O-2 with 1.22 eV energy barrier. For the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) step on BDP, the H ions dissociated from OER process can be captured by BDP to form free H-2 with 2.24 eV/molecule energy released. In this attractive clean cyclic process, the ZnPP-BDP can continuously catalyze the H2O dissociated into free H-2 and O-2 by the shifting potential barrier. Besides, the proton coupled electron sequent transfer possess an essential role in photocatalytic water dissociation. It is very instructive to design sustainable photodecomposition catalysts for both OER and HER, and to design extraordinary biomimetic photosynthesizers for clean energy.

Recently, incorporating Co atoms in NiFe laminates has been recognized as an effective way to enhance the OER activity, but their roles have been rarely studied. Herein, density functional theory plus U (DFT + U) calculations are employed to evaluate the OER thermodynamics after introducing bivalent Co2+ or trivalent Co3+ and consequent sites sensitivity in NiFe-LDH catalyst. Generally, based on computational results, incorporation of Co2+/Co3+ into NiFe-LDH could modulate the electronic structure of metal sites and thus reducing their OER overpotential. Moreover, Co3+-doped NiFe-LDH has the lowest overpotential of eta = 0.413 eV among the above proposed structure. This point was fully demonstrated by Co2+ and Co3+-incorporated NiFe-LDH nanosheets made by a co-precipitation method, by showing OER onset overpotential of 249 mV for Co3+-doped NiFe-LDH, 264 mV for Co2+-doped NiFe-LDH, which are 33 mV and 18 mV lower than that of pristine NiFe-LDH (282 mV), respectively. Such improved OER activity were attributed to the lowered overpotential at the *OOH formation step for Co2+-doped NiFe-LDH and the deprotonation step for Co3+-doped NiFe-LDH, which was the potential limiting step for their OER process. This work should be inspiring for future designing of more efficient NiFe-based oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The synergistic effects among Fe, S and Co enable superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity in basic environments. Impressively, this hybrid material can achieve further enhanced OER catalytic performance with surface self-assembly through in-situ electrochemical oxidation activation in both gentle alkaline (GA: 1.0 M KOH at 298 K) and industrial alkaline (IA: 30 wt.% KOH at 353 K) water electrolysis conditions. The transition processes are revealed in detail regarding the chemical, structural, and catalytic properties of the catalysts served in the GA and IA conditions. The pristine quasi-amorphous Co-Fe-S is found to partially transform into crystallized Co(Fe)OOH in the GA condition, while it remains amorphous nature in the IA condition. The enhanced OER activity is attributed to the formation of active Co(Fe)OOH species with massively proliferated specific surface area, optimized electronic structure, and accelerated kinetics. The activated Co-Fe-S NFs@MS/NF exhibits excellent OER activity, achieving 10 and 500 mA cm(-2) at ultralow potentials of 1.453 (iR corrected) and 1.517 V with outstanding durability in the GA and IA conditions, respectively. For full water splitting, the assembled two-electrode system based on the Co-Fe-S NFs@MS/NF anode and a Co-S based cathode affords voltages of only 1.518 and 1.685 V to robustly deliver 10 and 500 mA cm(-2) in GA and IA conditions over 200 h, respectively.

Herein, by means of comprehensive densty functional theory (DFT) computations, we explored the potential of the heteroatom doping (N and P) to activate the basal plane of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayer for ORR in acidic medium. Our computations revealed that substituting S in MoS2 monolayer with N or P atom can introduce high spin density into MoS2 basal plane, leading to its improved chemical reactivity for the O-2 activation, and the subsequent ORR steps prefer to proceed though a more efficient 4e pathway. Especially, N-doped MoS2 monolayer exhibits outstanding ORR catalytic performance in terms of its small overpotential (0.67 V) and low energy barrier (0.25 eV), which is comparable (even lower) to those of Pt-based electrocatalysts. In contrast, the catalytic activity of P-doped MoS2 monolayer is considerably poor due to its very strong interaction with O-* and OOH* species in the subsequent reactions. Therefore, we expect that N-doped MoS2 monolayer is a quite promising single-atom-catalyst with high efficiency for ORR in fuel cells. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), we find that exposure to an ORR-relevant potential of 0.7 V vs RHE produces a disordered (Mn3O4)-O-II,III,III phase with negligible contributions from other phases. After the potential is increased to a highly anodic value of 1.8 V vs RHE, relevant to the OER, we observe an oxidation of approximately 80% of the catalytic thin film to form a mixed Mn-III,Mn-IV oxide, while the remaining 20% of the film consists of a less oxidized phase, likely corresponding to unchanged (Mn3O4)-O-II,III,III. XAS and electrochemical characterization of two thin film catalysts with different MnOx thicknesses reveals no significant influence of thickness on the measured oxidation states, at either ORR or OER potentials, but demonstrates that the OER activity scales with film thickness. This result suggests that the films have porous structure, which does not restrict electrocatalysis to the top geometric layer of the film. As the portion of the catalyst film that is most likely to be oxidized at the high potentials necessary for the OER is that which is closest to the electrolyte interface, we hypothesize that the Mn-III,Mn-IV oxide, rather than (Mn3O4)-O-II,III,III,is the phase pertinent to the observed OER activity.									410	9	0	0	32	0	413			0002-7863			WOS:000320483900022	23758050

The gas products are mainly transported in the form of bubbles, the evolution and dynamic behaviors of bubbles affect the heat and mass transfer and chemical reaction rate of the system. In this paper, an experimental system for visualizing the dynamic behaviors of oxygen bubbles during photoelectrochemical water splitting was built. The bubble evolution on the horizontal photoelectrode surface was studied, and the bubble growth mechanism controlled by surface chemical reaction was discussed. Furthermore, a method to regulate the dynamic behaviors of bubbles by external chopping was proposed. It was found that the rhythmic chopping caused the bubbles to bounce on the horizontal surface, and the dynamic characteristics of the bouncing bubbles were obtained. The bouncing characteristics of bubbles were regulated by adjusting the electronic shutter switch time, the variation of the number of bubble returns and growth time under different chopping modes were obtained.			光电催化分解水制氢技术是目前最有前景的清洁利用太阳能的技术之一,其气体产物主要以气泡的形式输运,气泡的演化规律和动态行为特性影响着系统的传热传质及化学反应速率。本文通过搭建光电催化分解水气泡动态行为可视化实验平台,研究了气泡在水平电极表面的演化规律,探讨了气泡在表面化学反应控制下的生长机理;进一步提出了一种通过外部斩光调控气泡动态行为的方法,发现节律性斩光可使气泡在水平电极表面发生弹跳,并得到了弹跳气泡的动力学特性;通过控制电子快门开关时间调节气泡弹跳特性,得到了气泡返回次数和生长时间在不同斩光模式下的变化规律.						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0253-231X			CSCD:6757410

Here, a Fe-doped Ni phosphides/Ni sulfide p-p heterojunction (NiFe-PS) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is constructed on nickel foam. It is shown that the built-in electric field at the interface of Fe-doped Ni phosphides/Ni sulfide facilitates the charge transfer and modifies the electronic properties of the catalyst, thereby enhancing its conductivity and catalytic activity. Profiting from the rational electronic structure modulation, the designed NiFe-PS electrode possesses excellent OER performance among phosphides with low overpotentials of 204 and 256 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Meanwhile, the prepared catalyst displays high stability in the long-term chronopotentiometric test (125 h @ 100 mA cm(-2)). Structural characterizations confirm that the outer phosphide layer can withstand long-term surface oxidation and operate as a robust shield to prevent oxidation of the inner sulfide, ensuring rapid electron transport within the catalyst throughout the OER process.

Improving both the activity and the stability of the catalyst remains a key challenge. In this Communication, we describe a two-step reaction for preparing three-dimensional electrodes composed of CoSe2 nanoparticles grown on carbon fiber paper. The electrode exhibits excellent catalytic activity for a hydrogen evolution reaction in an acidic electrolyte (100 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of similar to 180 mV). Stability tests though long-term potential cycles and extended electrolysis confirm the exceptional durability of the catalyst.

Several highly OER active Co-based perovskites have been known to show extraordinary activities and stabilities when the B-site is partially occupied by Fe. At the current stage, the role of Fe in enhancing the OER activity and stability is still unclear. In order to elucidate the roles of Co and Fe in the OER mechanism of cubic perovskites, two prospective perovskite oxides, La0.2Sr0.8Co1-xFexO3-delta and Ba0.5Sr0.3Co1-xFexO3-delta with x = 0 and 0.2, were prepared by flame spray synthesis as nanoparticles. This study highlights the importance of Fe in order to achieve high OER activity and stability by drawing relations between their physicochemical and electrochemical properties. Ex situ and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was used to study the local electronic and geometric structure under oxygen evolving conditions. In parallel, density function theory computational studies were conducted to provide theoretical insights into our findings. Our findings show that the incorporation of Fe into Co-based perovskite oxides alters intrinsic properties rendering efficient OER activity and prolonged stability.									163	13	0	0	13	0	170			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000463843700027	30860837

A series of MEAs consisting of Nafion 117 polymer electrolyte and magnetron sputtered Pt, IrOx, and composite IrOx/Pt/IrOx catalysts with varying catalytic loadings were investigated. The partial electrode reactions proceeding in the real PEM EHEC, namely hydrogen oxidation (HOR), hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen reduction (ORR), and oxygen evolution (OER), are simulated and studied in a recently developed test cell with a unitized gas compartment. The EasyTest Cell design gives possibilities for strict control of the experimental conditions by avoiding the usage of any auxilliary gas conditioning equipment. By varying the thickness of the sputtered Pt film, the catalyst loading is remarkably reduced (from 0.5 to 0.06 mg cm(-2) or about 8 times) for both HOR and HER without any sacrifice of the electrode performance. The electrode with 0.2 mg cm(-2) sputtered IrOx shows the best OER performance. The composite IrOx/Pt/IrOx electrode demonstrated a bi-functional catalytic activity toward both OER and ORR, as well as improved gas diffusion properties toward ORR compared to the single Pt layer with the same catalytic loading.A phenomenological criterion for evaluating the gas diffusion properties of the electrodes is proposed. The applied testing approach is validated via comparison of the results obtained in the EasyTest Cell and the common laboratory PEM electrolytic cell. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The unique synthesis technique allows easy control of the metal composition over a wide range on various substrates. A series of unary and binary metal oxyhydroxides of 30 compositions are synthesized by PMND on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate as water oxidation electrocatalysts. The activity of the metal oxyhydroxide films is represented by a volcano plot as a function of a single experimental descriptor, i.e., the fraction of hydroxide in the surface oxygen species. The optimum compositions for binary metal oxyhydroxide (NiFe, NiCo, and CoFe) are determined on conductive substrates of FTO, nickel foam (NF), nickel mesh (NM), and carbon felt (CF), and the best NiFe (2:8) electrocatalyst on NF exhibits a water oxidation current density of 100 mA/cm(2) with only 280 mV of overvoltage, which outperforms conventional noble metal catalysts like IrOx and RuOx in an alkaline medium. Finally, we demonstrate a tandem PV-electrolysis system by using a c-Si PV module with a power conversion efficiency of 13.71% and an electrochemical cell composed of NiFe (2:8)/NF anode and a bare NF cathode with a conversion efficiency of 71.8%, which records a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 9.84%.									30	0	0	0	4	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000489204000090

Characterization of the photosynthetic apparatus in leaves of horse bean plants grown hydroponically on ZnCl2 solutions								Biophysics				46	2			298	304						March-April 2001	2001	Leaves of horse bean plants grown hydroponically on aqueous ZnCl2 (10-7-10-3 M) were studied for their chlorophyll content and the oxygen evolution rate. Other parameters studied included the FM/FT ratio of slow fluorescence induction, where FM and FT are the maximum and the steady-state intensities of fluorescence emitted at 685 nm; and the ESR1 signal ratio P/P0, where P and P0 are the steady-state signals from oxidized reaction centers of photosystem I recorded upon illumination of leaves with white light and far-red light, respectively. In plants grown at low ZnCl2 concentrations, leaves contained less chlorophyll (per mg wet leaf weight) and released oxygen at a higher rate (per mg chlorophyll). At high ZnCl2 concentrations, plant growth and oxygen evolution were significantly inhibited. The FM/FT ratio of slow fluorescence induction and the ESR1 signal ratio P/P0 varied with ZnCl2 concentration. Changes in both biophysical parameters were correlated with the changes in the photosynthetic activity normalized to the chlorophyll content. The data are discussed in terms of functional and structural adaptation of the plant photosynthetic apparatus to the growth conditions.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0006-3509			INSPEC:7039439

Based on this consideration, herein, for the first time, multi-metal oxides MoO2/Co2Mo3O8/Fe2Mo3O8 (MCF) compactly anchored N, P-doped car bon matrix (CNT and amorphous carbon derived from cobalt hexacyanoferrate) (MCF/NPCCNT) is fabricated by simply pyrolyzing composite precursor consisted of phosphomolybdic acid, cobalt hexacyanoferrate and CNT under the nitrogen atmospheres. The as-prepared MCF/NPCCNT-40 hybrid catalyst delivers a high OER electrochemical activity with a smaller overpotential of 292 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) anda lower Tafel slope of 45.9 mV dec(-1), as well as favorable cycle stability in 1.0 M KOH solution, markedly improving the charge transfer efficiency in catalytic processes and preventing the corrosion of the metallic compounds. In addition, the MCF/NPCCNT-40 hybrid catalyst exhibits large mass density of 323.2 A g(-1) at a fixed potential of 1.7 V, which is the highest mass activity towards OER process compared to the other reference samples. The design idea and synthetic strategy of this work can be expanded to design and fabricate other novel, highly effective and low-cost multi-metal oxide anchored N, P-doped carbon matrix based electrocatalysts with greatly improved OER performance.

Re-investigation of Sabatier's Principle by the Free Energy Diagram in Electrocatalysis								ACS CATALYSIS				9	6			5320	5329		10.1021/acscatal.9b00732				JUN 2019	2019	The computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) approach has spurred ab initio investigations in the field of electrocatalysis, since the underlying concept enables to quantify free energy changes, Delta G (thermodynamics), for the formation of reaction intermediates on an electrocatalyst surface. The connection between thermodynamics and kinetics (activity) is achieved by Sabatier's principle: the optimum situation to realize an active electrocatalyst is ascribed to reaction intermediates that are thermoneutrally bound (Delta G = 0 eV) at zero overpotential. In order to validate the linkage between thermodynamics and kinetics at zero overpotential for two-electron processes, free energy diagrams as a function of the applied electrode potential are compiled. Herein, the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) over RuO2(110), one of the best understood model systems in electrocatalysis, is used as a starting point for this investigation. It turns out that the connection between thermodynamics and kinetics at zero overpotential does not reproduce activity trends correctly if the Tafel slope is overpotential dependent. Therefore, it appears expedient to include the applied overpotential into the thermodynamic framework: for electrocatalysts with a change in the Tafel slope, it is suggested to employ the absolute free energy change for the formation of a reaction intermediate at respective overpotential eta, vertical bar Delta G(eta)vertical bar, as thermodynamic descriptor for the kinetics of two-electron processes, which may aid the construction of overpotential-dependent Volcano plots for improved material screening.									56	0	0	0	5	0	56			2155-5435			WOS:000471212600059

It is found that the mild sulfurized FeCo-LDH nano sheets using Na2S converted a portion of their surface metal-hydroxide bonds to metalsulfur (-hydrosulfide) bonds without significantly altering their crystal structure. The sulfidation degree is controlled by Na2S concentration for obtaining a moderately surface electronic configurations. Benefits from the regulated electronic configurations, the sulfurized FeCo-LDH nanosheets only require an overpotential of 281 mV to produce oxygen at 10 mA cm(-2) and their Tafel slope is 51.8 mV dec(-1), which are both lower than the 348 mV and 72.7 mV dec(-1) of pristine FeCo-LDH nanosheets. The sulfurized catalysts have sustained 12 h of operation without notable activity loss. This work can provide new insights into understanding the roles of metal-sulfur bonds for OER and offer an attractive strategy to design low cost but efficient OER catalysts.

Through rational design of a hierarchical multiheterogeneous three-dimensionally (3D) ordered macroporous Mo2C-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon with ultrafine Ru nanoclusters anchored on its surface (OMS Mo2C/NC-Ru), we realize both electronic and morphologic engineering of the catalyst to maximize the electrocatalysis performance. The formed Ru-NC heterostructure shows regulative electronic states and optimized adsorption energy with the intermediate H*, and the Mo2C-NC heterostructure accelerates the Volmer reaction due to the strong water dissociation ability as confirmed by theoretical calculations. Consequently, superior HER activity in alkaline solution with an extremely low overpotential of 15.5 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with the mass activity more than 17 times higher than that of the benchmark Pt/C, an ultrasmall Tafel slope of 22.7 mV dec(-1), and excellent electrocatalytic durability were achieved, attributing to the enhanced mass transport and favorable gas release process endowed from the unique OMS Mo2C/NC-Ru structure. By oxidizing OMS Mo2C/NC-Ru into OMS MoO3-RuO2 catalyst, it can also be applied as efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalyst, enabling the construction of a quasi-symmetric electrolyzer for overall water splitting. Such a device's performance surpassed the state-of-the-art Pt/C || RuO2 electrolyzer. This study provides instructive guidance for designing 3D-ordered macroporous multicomponent catalysts for efficient catalytic applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2637-9368		WOS:000803756900001

The implication that the kinetics of O-clustering at low temperatures are anomalous coincides with the assumption that thermal donors consist of different numbers of clustered O-atoms. Attribution of the implied fast evolution of a series of clusters to rapid dimer diffusion does not appear to be consistent with observations relating to the defects subsequently detected. Even if aspects of this evolution suggest the involvement of self-interstitials ejected during clustering, no reasonable way has been found that these defects might account for the serial evolution of large O-clusters. A natural explanation of growth of a series of relatively large clusters is that a barrier to dimerization exists and that the rate of O-i-O-i interaction is much greater than that of [O(i)l-loss. The assumption of a dilute solution seems to be questionable.					19th International Conference on Defects in Semiconductors (ICDS-19)19th International Conference on Defects in Semiconductors (ICDS-19)	JUL, 1997JUL, 1997	European Union DG XII Sci Res & Dev; Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian; Junta Nacl Investigacio Cient & Tecnol; USA Res Off; Trans Tech Publicat Ltd; USN Off Naval Res GrantEuropean Union DG XII Sci Res & Dev; Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian; Junta Nacl Investigacio Cient & Tecnol; USA Res Off; Trans Tech Publicat Ltd; USN Off Naval Res Grant	AVEIRO, PORTUGALAVEIRO, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0255-5476		0-87849-786-2	WOS:000072749500056

Here, a facile strategy was proposed to prepare a hollow dodecahedron constructed by vacancy-rich spinel Co3S4 nanoparticles in a self-generated H2S atmosphere of thiourea. The morphology, composition, and electronic structure, especially the sulfur vacancy, of the cobalt sulfides can be regulated by the dose of thiourea. Benefitting from the H2S atmosphere, the anion exchange process and vacancy introduction can be accomplished simultaneously. The resulting catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity for the OER with a low overpotential of 270 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 59 mV dec-1. Combined with various characterizations and electrochemical tests, the as-proposed defect engineering method could delocalize cobalt neighboring electrons and expose more Co2+ sites in spinel Co3S4, which lowers the charge transfer resistance and facilitates the formation of Co3+ active sites during the preactivation process. This work paves a new way for the rational design of vacancy-enriched transition metal-based catalysts toward an efficient OER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2470-1343			WOS:000812752700001	35449953

After plasma treatment, NNGF owns both the bulk layer of graphite inherited from GFL and surface layer of nanoarray-structured defect-rich N doped carbon. Nanometer-sized NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDH), as an example, are electrodeposited onto NNGF for direct utilization as an OER electrode. Due to the remained graphite layer, the composite electrode is highly conductive; owing to the strong interaction between N dopants and LDH sheets, the charge transfer is dramatically enhanced; meanwhile the diffusion of liquid reactants and gas products during electrocatalysis is also facilitated by the nanoarray structure. As expected, this hybrid NiFe LDH/NNGF electrode exhibits a low overpotential of 0.191 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Such nanoarray-structured carbon material is promising to be a universal support for other active species (e.g. NiCo LDH).									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000543866400016

Hence, in this study, the synergetic level was taken as an indicator, and the effects of illumination, current intensity, aeration intensity and initial pH on the synergistic effects of hybrid photo-electrocatalytic degradation of 3,4-dimethylaniline (3,4-DMA) were determined. Furthermore, photo-assisted electrocatalytic, electro-assisted photocatalytic and hydroxyl radicals detection experiments were carried out to explore the degradation mechanism. The results indicated that the synergistic effects occurred in the hybrid photoelectrocatalysis system, and the synergetic level was affected by external conditions. The reasons for the synergetic effects were ascribed to the following items. The applied electric fields promoted the yield of hydroxyl radicals. The ultraviolet radiation improved the utilization of active oxides such as hydroxyl radicals by stimulating 3,4-DMA and its intermediates. The oxygen evolution side reaction in electrocatalysis provided electron acceptors for photocatalysis, which could enhance the degradation efficiency of the whole treatment system. This research provided a new method for further study and regulation of the synergetic effects.			高级催化氧化法的复合水处理工艺经常出现协同效应,但对于协同效应的产生机理仍不清楚。因此,针对光电耦合催化氧化体系,采用协同度为量化指标,研究了不同光照、电流密度、曝气强度、初始pH等条件对光电耦合催化体系降解3, 4-二甲基苯胺(3,4-DMA)的协同效应的影响;并通过光助电催化实验、电助光催化实验和羟基自由基检测实验,探讨了协同效应存在的原因。结果表明,光电耦合催化氧化系统存在协同效应,且协同度受外部条件的影响。协同效应产生的原因主要包括:外加电场促进体系产生了更多的羟基自由基;紫外光照使得3,4-DMA及其降解中间产物受到激发而提高了对羟基自由基等活性氧物种的利用率;电催化过程中的析氧副反应为光催化提供了电子受体,从而提高了系统的总体降解效率。这为深入研究和人为调控协同效应提供了新的方法。						0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1673-9108			CSCD:6559992

The TOF of Ru-II(bda)(pic)(2) confined in the nanocage increased from 1.2 to 8.7 s(-1) by simply increasing the number of Ru-II(bda)(pic)(2) molecules from one to seven in each nanocage, which is direct evidence for the "cooperative activation" mechanism involved in a binuclear reaction pathway for water oxidation reactions. The TOF of Ru-II(bda)(pic)(2) confined in the nanocage can be as high as two times that of the homogeneous Ru-II(bda)(pic)(2) due to the enhanced "cooperative activation" in the limited space of nanocages. Moreover, preliminary kinetic studies suggest that the stability of the molecular catalysts can be greatly improved after confinement in the nanocage. This strategy not only provides a new strategy for the preparation of highly efficient solid-hosted catalysts for water oxidation, but also gives direct evidence for the oxygen evolution mechanism.									48	2	0	0	3	0	48			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000306571800017

Zn cations migrate from the ZnO grains during oxygen vacancies formation process and diffuse into the MnO2 particles leading to an interphase region with an intermediate valence Mn+3-O-Mn+4. Large amounts of desorbed Zn cations promote the formation of ZnMn2O4 Structure, in addition to the intermediate valence state. The system evolves towards complete formation of the spinel phase at higher thermal treatment times. The reactivity of the ZnO plays an important role in the formation of this interphase. Low-reactivity ZnO powder, in which the oxygen vacancies are previously produced, shows a stabilization of the intermediate valence state with very limited formation of the spinel phase. A clear correlation between the amount of the intermediate state interphase and the magnetic properties has been established. Crown Copyright (c) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, because of the difficulty in precise construction, facet engineering of two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (2D MOFs) is rarely reported. Herein, we propose a new and facile coordination modulation method to realize the controllable synthesis of 2D NiFe-MOFs with a highly exposed (001) crystal facet. Specifically, acetate ions, which possess the same coordination groups with the participated terephthalic ligand, have been adopted into the MOF construction as the morphology and facet regulator. Through competitive coordination effect and ion-induced self-assembly, the fabricated NiFe-MOFs reveal a hierarchical microsphere architecture consisting of ultrathin nanosheets with thickness similar to 5 nm. Further benefiting from the structural advantages, e.g., abundant active sites, highly exposed catalytic facet, and enhanced mass/charge transport, the hierarchical NiFe- MOF nanosheets exhibit an attractive overpotential of 240 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 73.44 mV dec(-1), and satisfactory stability for 16 h toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Besides, the increased exposure of the (001) facet will increase the proportion of high-valent nickel oxyhydroxides during OER, which will enhance the electrocatalytic performance. The universality of the modulation method is further verified by the successful synthesis of a series of 2D MOFs (Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, and corresponding bimetal MOFs). This method may serve as an important inspiration for the preparation and crystal facet engineering of 2D MOFs.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2168-0485			WOS:000687050400022

Fuel cells have attracted much attention because of their high energy density and low pollutant emission. However, the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics of the cathode are slow, and many platinum -based catalysts are needed to drive the reaction. The high platinum price and scarce reserves limit the application of fuel cells. It is therefore urgent to develop cheaper and more efficient non-noble-metal catalysts to drive the ORR. One promising approach is to develop transition-metal-oxide catalysts with high ORR catalytic perfor-mance. Here, the structure of CoO was modified, and the surface of partially reduced CoO(111) catalyst [Co-CoO (111)] was simulated via density functional theory (DFT). The catalytic ORR on two kinds of Co (Co-2, Co-3) on the Co-CoO(111) surface were simulated and free-energy diagrams were created. When Co-2 was used as the active site, the Co-CoO(111) catalyst had a low overpotential of 0.34 eV. Besides, when Co-3 site was covered with O and Co-2(*)-Co-3(O*) is used as ORR reaction site, it still had good catalytic performance of ORR. The electronic structure of Co-CoO(111) was used to explain the high level of the ORR.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2468-8231			WOS:000843465500007

While this reconstruction strongly influences their performance, it is frequently over-looked. Herein, we analyze the role of the oxidized anions, which is particularly neglected in most previous works. We introduce a range of different anionic groups (Cl-, CH3COO-, NO3-, SO42-) on the surface of an amor-phous ZnCoxNiyOz catalyst by a facile proton etching and ion exchange method from a ZIF-8 self-sacrificial template. The structural and chemical properties of the obtained set of materials are thoroughly analysed and correlated with their electrocatalytic performance to study the effect of surface anionic groups, phase transition, metal leaching and defect generation on OER activity. Exploiting the control possibilities provided by the syn-thesis method here described and employing the uncovered property-performance correlations, the electro-catalyst is optimized. As a result, we produce ZnCo1.25Ni0.73Ox-SO4 catalysts with outstanding OER performances, including a low overpotential of 252 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 41.6 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, this catalyst exhibits remarkable stability with negligible overpotential variation for 100 h. The excellent catalytic properties are rationalized using density functional theory calculations, showing that the surface-adsorbed anions, particularly SO42-, can stabilize the OOH* intermediate, thus enhancing the OER ac-tivity. This work offers new insight into the roles of metal leaching and surface-adsorbed anions in the OER progress and facilitates the rational design of highly-efficient electrocatalysts for OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000866676800001

This model differs from the conventional condensation model in which aggregates of condensate grains form different kinds of CAIs depending on the relative populations of different kinds of grains. In our model the pyroxene forms nearly isochemically by reaction of perovskite with melilite under highly reducing conditions. Anorthite requires the addition of silica from the gas, and originally forms as veins and reaction rims on gehlenitic melilite within Fluffy Type As. Later partial re-melting of these assemblages results in the formation of poikilitic pyroxene and anorthite that enclose rounded (partially melted) tablets of melilite. Oxygen isotopes in four of the CAIs support the formation of Ti-rich 16O-depleted pyroxene from 16O-depleted perovskite, but not in the fifth CAI. An alternative possibility is that Ti-rich 16O-depleted pyroxene is the result of later solid-state exchange that preferentially affects the most Ti-rich pyroxene. Regardless of the origin of the 16O-depleted pyroxene, we give a model for nebular reservoir evolution based on sporadic FU-Orionis flare-ups in which the 16O-rich region near the proto-Sun fluctuated in size depending on whether the protoSun was in flare-up stage or quiescent.

Herein, we demonstrate a fabrication technique of an organic-inorganic hybrid polypyrrole (ppy)/AgVO3, and its surface was further modified by porphrin (porphy) to boost its catalytic performances. The C,N-based ppy/AgVO3/porphy nanocatalyst acts as a charge transport highway to accelerate the sluggish OER/ORR kinetics and results in its impressive bifunctional performances. It exhibits an outstanding four-electron ORR activity with higher onset potential (1.03 V) and remarkable OER catalytic performance carrying a lowest overpotential (eta(10)) of 220 mV, largely outperforming AgVO3 and ppy/AgVO3. Initially the very low ORR/OER activities of AgVO3 nanorods come from poor O-2 and OH- adsorption on V5+ sites due to its extremely low electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and poor electrical conductivity. The ppy loading has improved its catalytic performances by providing new active sites due to the presence of pyrrolic-N. Finally, the active site density was greatly enhanced after porphy loading over ppy/AgVO3, as porphy offers additional pyridinic-N along with pyrrolic-N atom. Furthermore, developed mesoporous surface after porpy incorporation provides high electrical conductivity, large surface area, enhanced charge-mass transport, dose electrolyte-catalyst contact, and improved stability. Considering its bifunctional activity, NComp has been further evaluated by integrating it into a prototype zinc-air battery (ZAB), where a low discharge-charge voltage gap (0.71 V at 10 mA.cm(-2)) and a large peak power density (301 mW.cm(-2)) were achieved. Moreover, the NComp-based rechargeable ZAB (RZAB) is efficient enough to be operated evenly for 100 discharge-charge cycles. Most importantly, our findings may offer a powerful yet easy fabrication method of corrosion resistant high-performance catalyst through regulating active sites for investigating catalysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0970			WOS:000529206200078

Metal oxide model TinRumO2 has been established with pure TiO2 and RuO2 on the basis set of Double Numerical plus polarization (DNP), in which the proportion of min was 3:1,1:1, or 1:3. Analysis on the reaction activity in the electrochemical reaction and the electrochemical desorption reaction was based on Frontier molecular orbital theory. The results show that the TinRumO2 with a ratio of Ti:Ru at 3:1 is best facilitates the electrochemical reaction and electrochemical desorption reaction to produce M-Cl-ads intermediate and precipitate Cl-2. In addition, the adsorption energy of Cl on the surface of Ti3Ru1O2 possesses the minimum value of -2.514 eV, and thus electrochemical desorption reaction could occur most easily.

Herein, a hierarchical mesporous/macroporous perovskite La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-x (HPN-LSC) nanotube is developed to promote its application in Li-O-2 batteries. The HPN-LSC nanotubes were synthesized via electrospinning technique followed by postannealing. The as-prepared HPN-LSC catalyst exhibits outstanding intrinsic ORR and OER catalytic activity. The HPN-LSC/KB electrode displays excellent performance toward both discharge and charge processes for Li-O-2 batteries, which enhances the reversibility, the round-trip efficiency, and the capacity of resultant batteries. The synergy of high catalytic activity and hierarchical mesoporous/macroporous nanotubular structure results in the Li-O-2 batteries with good rate capability and excellent cycle stability of sustaining 50 cycles at a current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2) with an upper-limit capacity of 500 mAh g(-1). The results will benefit for the future development of high-performance Li-O-2 batteries using hierarchical mesoporous/macroporous nanostructured perovskite-type catalysts.									112	9	0	0	4	0	115			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000363001500044	26418118

As one typical kind of single-atom catalysts, Pt-based single-atom alloys (SAAs) have generated significant interest due to their application in several heterogeneous catalytic reactions. However, almost all of the reported Pt-based SAAs are on Cu surface. In addition, it is still great challenge to apply Pt single-atom alloys in electrocatalytic reactions. Herein, we demonstrated a fabrication of Pt/Pd SAA catalysts on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes by atomic layer deposition. The as-prepared octahedral Pt/Pd SAA catalysts exhibited greatly improved activity compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts for electrochemical catalytic reactions. According to the X-ray adsorption spectrum, the Pt atoms in Pt/Pd SAA catalysts exhibited higher unoccupied 5d character density of states and a lower Pt-Pt coordination number, compared to those in core-shell structures. In addition, we used density functional theory calculation results to explain the enhanced mechanism of Pt/Pd SAA catalysts for electrochemical reactions. This study opens up an avenue of developing different types of Pt-based catalysts for electrocatalytic reactions and brings insight understanding about catalytic performances of SAA catalysts.									60	3	0	0	2	0	60			2155-5435			WOS:000489204000060

There is an urgent need to identify the most important parameters that determine the catalytic performance and so enable the development of design strategies for catalysts. In the past decades, several descriptors have been developed to unravel structure-performance relationships. This Minireview summarizes reactivity descriptors in electrocatalysis including adsorption energy descriptors involving reaction intermediates, electronic descriptors represented by a d-band center, structural descriptors, and universal descriptors, and discusses their merits/limitations. Understanding the trends in electrocatalytic performance and predicting promising catalytic materials using reactivity descriptors should enable the rational construction of catalysts. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have also been adopted to discover new and advanced descriptors. Finally, linear scaling relationships are analyzed and several strategies proposed to circumvent the established scaling relationships and overcome the constraints imposed on the catalytic performance.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000711811100001	34587345

Here, based on the excellent conductivity and stability of ordered mesoporous carbons, and the best ORR and OER activity of Co3O4, the composite Co3O4/N-HNMK-3 was designed and manufactured by means of a solvothermal method, using ordered N-doped mesoporous carbon (N-HNMK-3) as substrate, and then the bifunctional electrocatalytic performance corresponding to ORR, OER in alkaline media was carefully investigated. The results showed that Co3O4/N-HNMK-3 composite, a non-precious metal centered electrocatalyst, displayed excellent ORR performance (activity, selectivity, and stability) close to that of commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C and a promising OER activity near 20 wt.% RuO2/C.

These compounds in the molecular capsules accelerated the O-2 reduction reaction, indicating that O-2 molecules can easily pass through the gaps in the capsule. Further, upon encapsulation, the overpotential of the hydrogen evolution reaction of Fephthalocyanines was improved by applying a potential in alkaline solution. This molecular capsule extends the electrochemistry of water-insoluble metal complexes in aqueous electrolyte solutions and acts as an electrochemical nanoreactor.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000821674000008

The hydrothermal treatment remarkably enhances the strength of the resulting pyrolyzed carbon materials, enabling the facile fabrication of robust monolithic nitrogen-doped porous carbon with the yield of 44.33%. This nitrogendoped porous carbon exhibits 3-dimensional porous structure which is mainly mesoporous and high surface area. The thin and 3-dimensional self-supported working electrode is made from the synthesized nitrogen-doped porous carbon without using any other current collector or polymeric binder. The hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalytic activity in 0.5MH(2)SO(4) reveals the achievement of the low overpotential of similar to 220 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of similar to 77 mV dec(-1), a nearly 100% Faradaic yield, an excellent stability, and a low charge transfer resistance. The self-supported electrode exhibits higher electrocatalytic activity than the powder-state supported on graphite felt electrode. Its hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalytic activity is better than that of the reported non-metal heteroatom-doped carbon catalysts and comparable to that of some metal catalysts in acidic media. The use of flour enables the cheap and facile fabrication of carbon electrode with tunable pore sizes and surface areas, making flour-based carbon electrodes highly promising. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, the introduction of [Cr(C2O(4))(3)](3-)into NiFe LDHs by intercalation engineering to promote surface reconstruction achieves an advanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. In view of the weak electronegativity of Cr3+ in [Cr(C2O(4))(3)](3)-, the intercalation of [Cr(C2O(4))(3)](3- )is expected to result in an electron-rich structure of Fe sites in NiFe LDHs, and higher valence state of Ni can be formed with the charge transfer between Fe and Ni. The optimized electronic structure of NiFe-[Cr(C2O(4))(3)](3-)-LDHs with more active Ni3+ species and the expedited dynamic generation of Ni3+(Fe)OOH phase during the OER process contributed to its excellent catalytic property, revealed by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and quasi-in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. With the modulated electronic structure of metal sites, NiFe-[Cr(C2O(4))(3)](3-)-LDHs exhibited promoted OER property with a lower overpotential of 236 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work illustrates the intercalation of conjugated anion to dynamically construct desired Ni(3+ )sites with the optimal electronic environment for improved OER electrocatalysis.

The photoelectrocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 was improved by Bi doping and GO loading as a cocatalyst on the surface of photoanode through the efficient charge cascade to increase an effective charge separation and reduce activation barriers for oxygen evolution reaction. The current-potential curve of Bi@g-C3N4/GO displayed about five and two times more photocurrent density (0.3 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs RHE) with respect to those of g-C3N4 and Bi@g-C3N4, following with a 110 and 80 mV cathodically shifted onset potential, respectively. The conduction band edge was calculated using the flat band potential of the photocatalysts which was estimated by Butler-Gartner model. GO loading leads to yield the photo-voltage of 176 mV compared with 81 and 113 mV for g-C3N4 and Bi@g-C3N4, respectively. The optimum of thickness of GO cocatalyst was 0.9 mu m. If the thickness exceeds this optimum value, the recombination centers increase and active sites of photocatalytic layer are blocked. The charge separation and injection efficiency for Bi@g-C3N4/GO photoanode were determined by using H2O2 as an effective hole scavenger. Among fabricated electrodes, Bi@g-C3N4/GO electrode represented the lowest charge transfer resistance. The results showed that much improvement in photoelectrocatalytic per-formance was achieved by GO loading on the surface of photoanode with respect to Bi doping in the structure of photocatalyst.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000737218800011

In order to improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, information about the atomic surface structure of the active state of the electrode is required. Here, we present environmental transmission electron microscopy studies of Ca-birnessite (K0.20Ca0.21MnO2.21.1.4H(2)O) electrodes under conditions close to those of the OER. Remarkably, in H2O vapor, a highly dynamic state of the surface and subsurface develops with a thickness of the formed dynamic layer of up to 0.6 nm, which is absent in O-2 and inert gases. Electron beam-induced effects are carefully studied, showing high stability of the material against radiation damage in high vacuum until a dose rate of 42,000 e(-)/(angstrom(2) s). In contrast, in H2O, the dynamic surface layer develops and forms a stationary state even at low dose rates, down to 5000 e(-)/(angstrom(2) s). Electron energy-loss spectroscopy reveals an increase in the Mn oxidation state in H2O and in O-2 ambient. Our results are interpreted as the formation of a few-angstrom-thick, dynamic, and hydrated surface layer of birnessite in H2O, with an increased Mn valence state. Such a dynamic surface layer with a flexible Mn coordination and valence state might be optimal for oxygen evolution due to the higher effective interaction volume beyond the surface area and a flexible bond coordination of partially hydrated Mn species.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000629169900013

This study elucidates the mechanistic origin of the oxygen reduction reaction catalyzed by delta-MnO2 monolayers and maps the conditions for Li2O2 growth using a combination of first principles calculations and mesoscale modeling. The MnO2 monolayer, in the absence of an applied potential, preferentially reacts with a Li atom instead of an O-2 molecule to initiate the formation of LiO2. The oxygen reduction products (LiO2, Li2O2, and Li2O molecules) strongly interact with the MnO2 monolayer via the stabilization of Li-O chemical bonds with lattice oxygen atoms. As compared to the disproportionation reaction, direct lithiation reactions are the primary contributors to the stabilization of Li2O2 on the MnO2 monolayer. The energy profiles of (Li2O2)(2) and (Li2O)(2) nucleation on delta-MnO2 monolayer during the discharge process demonstrate that Li2O2 is the predominant discharge product and that further reduction to Li2O is inhibited by the high overpotential of 1.21 V. Interface structures have been examined to study the interaction between the Li2O2 and MnO2 layers. This study demonstrates that a Li2O2 film can be homogeneously deposited onto delta-MnO2 and that the Li2O2/MnO2 interface acts as an electrical conductor. A mesoscale model, developed based on findings from the first-principles calculations, further shows that Li2O2 is the primary product of electrochemical reactions when the applied potential is smaller than 2.4 V.									37	1	0	0	2	0	37			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000382902800034	27532334

The currently available synthesis processes for high-efficiency bifunctional bimetallic sulfide electrodes typically require high-temperature hydrothermal or chemical vapor deposition, which is undesirable in terms of the complexity in experimental procedure and the damage of flexibility in the resultant electrode. Herein, a scalable fabrication process is reported by combining electrospinning with in situ sulfurization at room temperature to successfully obtain CuCo2S4 nanosheets@N-doped carbon nanofiber (CuCo2S4 NSs@N-CNFs) films, which show remarkable bifunctional catalytic performance (E-j (= 10) (OER) - E-1/2 (ORR) = 0.751 V) with excellent mechanical flexibility. Furthermore, the CuCo2S4 NSs@N-CNFs cathode delivers a high open-circuit potential of 1.46 V, an outstanding specific capacity of 896 mA h g(-1), when assembled into a quasi-solid-state flexible ZAB together with Zn NSs@carbon nanotubes (CNTs) film (electrodeposited Zn nanosheets on CNTs film) as the anode. The ZAB also shows a good flexibility and capacity stability with 93.62% capacity retention (bending 1000 cycles from 0 degrees to 180 degrees), making it an excellent power source for portable and wearable electronic devices.									84	6	0	0	2	0	85				2198-3844		WOS:000474217900001	31508279

Thus, it is of critical importance to develop Mn-based superstructures and study their catalytic details for water-splitting-based renewable energy research. Herein, we report a manganese(ii) phosphate nanosheet assembly with asymmetric out-of-plane Mn centers from the transformation of amine-intercalated nanoplates for efficient electrocatalytic water oxidation in neutral aqueous solutions. From structural and computational studies, it is found that the native out-of-plane Mn centers with terminal water ligands are accessible and preferential oxidation sites to form active intermediates for water oxidation. In addition, the asymmetry can stabilize the key Mn-III intermediate, as demonstrated by electrochemical and spectrometric studies.

Through controlling heat treatment in air, O-doping and Zn, S vacancies were simultaneously introduced in Zn10In16S34 nanosheets with adjusted phase, morphology, chemical compositions, and energy level distribution. The surface defect states are passivated by depositing ultrathin Al2O3 film by atomic layer deposition technology. The performance of Zn10In16S34 photoanodes is largely improved, with 4.7 times higher current density and reduced onset potential. The experimental results and density functional theory calculations indicate that the enhancement is attributed to the fast photoexcited electron-hole pair separation, decreased surface transfer impedance, prolonged carrier lifetime, and reduced overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction.									76	2	0	0	9	0	76			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000453348900054	30371007

The post-calcination treatment at 400degC was performed for all TiO2 thin films to induce their crystallinity. The TiO2 structure on the film properties were studied by material characterizations. The photoelectrochemical characteristics of the TiO2 films were investigated using a potentiostat. Under UV-light irradiation, a highest net photocurrent of 0.747 mA was observed for the NR-TiO2 thin film. To demonstrate the photoactivity of the prepared TiO2 thin films, water-splitting reactions were conducted. The yields of hydrogen and oxygen were 35.8 and 17.2 mumole, respectively after 8 hr. of UV-light irradiation on NR-TiO2.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			1793-821X			INSPEC:14078768

This paper describes the dimensional construction of nickel sulfide (NiS) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with heterogeneous structures for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The morphologies of MoS2/NiS can be finely tuned to aggregations, nanowires and nanocuboids by controlled addition of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (AOT) and hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as surfactants. MoS2/NiS nanosheet coupled nanocuboids (MoS2/NiS NCs) exhibit the best and most stable electrocatalytic activity with 92 and 271 mV overpotentials at 10 and 15 mA cm(-2) for the HER and the OER. MoS2/NiS NCs as an electrolyzer in alkaline media at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can deliver a cell voltage of 1.61 V with remarkable 45 h durability, making them an ideal catalyst towards practical application for water splitting.									79	4	0	0	3	0	80			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000434241800006

According to MXene's high surface area and structure characterization, a novel Ti/ carbon black (CB) @MXene anode was prepared for the first time for electrochemical oxidation degradation of 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazoline-3-one (CMIT) in reverse osmosis brine, even though MXene was studied more widely in sulfate radical based AOP and photocatalysis. This anode showed slippy surface and high oxygen evolution potential (2.84 V), suggesting it is hard to be fouled and eliminated the side reaction effect. According to the anode fabrication parameters optimization, the best mass ratio of Ti3C2Tx and CB was 1:1, showing the highest oxygen evolution potential. The reaction parameters including current density and plate spacing were optimized as 5.625 mA/cm(2) and 1.0 cm, where the best CMIT degradation efficiency was 89.86 %. This performance was better than DSA and similar with BDD anode, however its stability needs to be improved. The indirect oxidation dominated CMIT degradation as 99.69 % and center dot OH formation rate was 13.81 L.mol(-1).s(-1), which was approximately 5.04 fold higher than that of traditional Ti anode. Three possible degradation pathways of CMIT were proposed, as below: electron rich sulfur in S-N bond was oxidized to form sulfoxide structure, chlorine was replaced by center dot OH, olefin double bond was attacked by center dot OH. The formed intermediates showed less ecotoxicity. The Ti/CB@MXene anode showed better potential in electrochemical oxidation treatment of reverse osmosis brine.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000855185600002

The degree of photoinhibition of apo-WOC-PS II preparations was estimated by the loss of the capability of exogenous electron donor (sodium ascorbate) to restore the amplitude of light-induced changes of chlorophyll fluorescence yield (F). It was found that Ect-OH (i) stimulates the oxygen-evolving activity of PS II, (ii) accelerates the electron transfer from exogenous electron donors (K-4[Fe(CN)(6)], DPC, TMPD, Fe2+, and Mn2+) to the reaction center of apo-WOC-PS II, (iii) enhances the protective effect of exogenous electron donors against donor-side photoinhibition of apo-WOC-PS II preparations. It is assumed that Ect-OH can serve as an artificial electron donor for apo-WOC-PS II, which does not directly interact with either the donor or acceptor side of the reaction center. We suggest that the protein conformation in the presence of Ect-OH, which affects the extent of hydration, becomes favorable for accepting electrons from exogenous donors. To our knowledge, this is the first study dealing with redox activity of Ect-OH towards photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes.									5	0	1	0	3	0	6			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000478675500004	30701483

Herein, Ni/Ni3C core/shell hierarchical nanospheres have been in situ synthesized via an ionic liquid-assisted hydrothermal method at relatively low temperature. Ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate has played multiple roles in the whole synthesis process. Benefiting from the high electrical conductivity, more exposed active sites and the core/shell interface effect, the obtained Ni/Ni3C core/shell hierarchical nanospheres exhibit an outstanding OER performance with lower overpotential, small Tafel slope, and excellent stability. This fundamental method and insights with in situ coupling high conductivity metal support and metal carbide in a core/shell nanoarchitecture by an ionic liquid-assisted hydrothermal method would open up a new pathway to achieve high-performance electrocatalysts toward the OER.									38	1	0	0	1	0	38			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000434101200032	29726676

Herein, an in situ strategy to introduce sulfate (SO42-) anions and controlled bulk sulfur vacancies (S-v) into a ZnIn2S4 photoanode is developed, and its PEC performance is remarkably enhanced, achieving a photocurrent density of 3.52 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (V-RHE) and negatively shifted onset potential of 0.01 V-RHE in phosphate buffer without a sacrificial agent under AM 1.5G illumination. The experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that the SO42- groups enhance the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics, while bulk S-v improves the bulk carrier separation. The remarkable bulk carrier separation efficiency of 75.01% and surface carrier injection efficiency of 79.69% are achieved at 1.23 V-RHE. This work provides a new route to design efficient photoanodes by the simultaneous manipulation of metal-free anions and sulfur vacancies.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000655685300001

This article highlights the performance enhancement parameter of energy storage devices such as a symmetric supercapacitor and energy conversion such as methanol oxidation and water splitting studies for the generation of efficient oxygen and hydrogen. We have prepared a dense cerium molybdate microspherical architecture by the hydrothermal route, and further physical characterization has been performed to evaluate the structural parameters. Charge storage contributions, external surface charge, and internal surface-accumulated charge are calculated by Dunn's and Trassati's approaches. A solid-state symmetric supercapacitor device has been assembled, which exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance with a device capacity of 198 C g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), a large electrochemical potential window of 2.2 V, an enormous cyclic retention of 89.5% after 10,000 cycles, a maximum specific energy of 60.5 W h kg(-1), and a maximum specific power of 10.6 kW kg(-1). Furthermore, the prepared microspherical architectures were evaluated for oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions and methanol oxidation. The prepared electrode exhibits excellent oxygen evolution performance, while keeping the lowest overpotential as 316 mV, and for hydrogen evolution reaction, the overpotential was obtained as 178 mV. The microspherical architecture electrode also exhibits attractive catalytic performance for methanol oxidation and exhibits a maximum current density of 157 mA cm(-2), while having an onset potential of 1.314 V (versus RHE). Thus, the prepared nanocluster-aggregated microspherical architecture of Ce-2(MoO4)(3) can efficiently serve as the next-generation multifunction materials for energy storage and energy conversion applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000823428000001

However, OER with four-electron transfer requires electrocatalysts to speed up its sluggish kinetics in alkaline solutions. Herein, amorphous CoV phosphate (denoted as CoV-Pi) nanosheets synthesized by a straightforward one-step hydrothermal approach is reported, which provide a low overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope down to 48.8 mV dec(-1) and long-term durability over 80 h. The efficient activity is ascribed to the amorphous nanosheets structure, high electrochemically active surface area, enhanced surface wettability and the synergistic effect of the active metal atoms. This study significantly indicates that CoV-Pi is a promising alternative to replace expensive noble metal-based catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000778037300001	35293701

Resistance switching of amorphous TiO2 was investigated by sweeping in a continuous voltage scan and pulse bias voltage. The bipolar switching was observed without the need of a forming process. Switching of the Ti/amorphous-TiO2/Pt based structure showed good endurance. The switching mechanism and current-voltage characteristics were investigated from combinatorial analysis of the conducting filaments' evolution and the space-charge limited current conduction. The oxygen-vacancies migration involved redox processes, which is responsible for the recovery and rupture of sub-TiOx based conducting filaments inside the amorphous TiO2 layer.

The novel composite catalyst, namely, MnOx-Pi-rGO, is electrodeposited from a suspension of graphene oxide (GO) in a neutral phosphate buffer solution containing KMnO4. The manganese oxide incorporates phosphate ions and deposits on the rGO sheet, which in turn is formed on the substrate electrode by electrochemical reduction of GO in the suspension. The OER is studied with the MnOx-Pi-rGO catalyst in a neutral phosphate electrolyte by linear sweep voltammetry. The results indicate a positive influence of rGO in the catalyst. By varying the ratio of KMnO4 and GO in the deposition medium and performing linear sweep voltammetry for the OER, the optimum composition of the deposition medium is obtained as 20 mM KMnO4 + 6.5% GO in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution of pH 7. Under identical conditions, the MnOx-Pi-rGO catalyst exhibits 6.2 mA cm(-2) OER current against 2.9 mA cm(-2) by MnOx-Pi catalyst at 2.05 V in neutral phosphate solution. The Tafel slopes measured for OER at MnOx-Pi and MnOx-Pi-rGO are similar in magnitude at about 0.180 V decade(-1). The high Tafel slopes are attributed to partial dissolution of the catalyst during oxygen evolution. The O-2 evolved at the catalyst is measured by the water displacement method and the positive role of rGO on catalytic activity of MnOx-Pi is demonstrated.									12	2	0	0	0	0	12			2046-2069			WOS:000373061600076

In the present work, combining surface science experiments and density functional theory calculations, we construct a submonolayer MnOHx film on a Pt(111) substrate with different OH coverages (denoted as theta(OH)) and reveal its impact on reaction pathways under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and a CO atmosphere. OH directly desorbs in the form of H2O under UHV, while its evolution under a CO atmosphere can be divided into three stages with decreasing theta(OH): (i) CO + 2OH -> CO2 + H2O (85% <= theta(OH) <= 94%); (ii) CO + 2OH -> CO2 + H-2 + O-L (O-L, lattice O; 50% <= theta(OH) <= 85%); and (iii) 2CO + 2OH -> 2CO(2) + H-2 (26% <= theta(OH) <= 50%). In nature, surface OH and CO can form carboxyl intermediates, which promote the H2O generation and the O-H to Mn-H diffusion compared to the processes without CO assistance. Furthermore, as theta(OH) decreases and V-O increases, H binding on MnOHx/Pt(111) is weakened while OH binding is strengthened, which favors the generation of H-2 instead of H2O. These results provide inspiration to understand the mechanism for H- or OH-involved CO conversion reactions and to modulate a reaction selectivity via tailoring OH and V-O densities.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000861807200001

However, the use of electrocatalytic devices based on expensive noble metal catalysts limits commercial applications. In recent years, to improve performance and reduce cost, electrocatalysts based on cheaper copper or nickel materials have been investigated for the non-enzymatic glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, we demonstrate a facile and easy electrochemical method of forming a cheap nickel copper double hydroxide (NiCu-DH) electrocatalyst deposited onto a three-dimensional (3D) CuNi current collector, which can effectively handle two different reactions due to its high activity for both the GOR and the HER. The as-prepared electrode has a structure comprising abundant 3D-interconnected porous dendritic walls for easy access of the electrolyte ions and highly conductive networks for fast electron transfer; additionally, it provides numerous electroactive sites. The synergistic combination of the dendritic 3D-CuNi with its abundant active sites and the self-made NiCu-DH with its excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of glucose and HER enables use of the catalyst for both reactions. The as-prepared electrode as a glucose sensor exhibits an outstanding glucose detection limit value (0.4 mu M) and a wide detection range (from 0.4 mu M to 1.4 mM) with an excellent sensitivity of 1452.5 mu A/cm2/mM. The electrode is independent of the oxygen content and free from chloride poisoning. Furthermore, the as-prepared electrode also requires a low overpotential of -180 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode to yield a current density of 10 mA/cm2 with a Tafel slope of 73 mV/dec for the HER. Based on this performance, this work introduces a new paradigm for exploring cost-effective bi-functional catalysts for the GOR and HER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000830650000001	35839325

Herein, engineering vacancy-atom ensembles via injecting oxygen vacancy (V-O) into single facet-exposed TiO2-Pd catalyst to form V-O-Pd ensemble is proposed and implemented. The outstanding activity of as-prepared catalyst, 1.5-PdTVO, toward water dissociation is established with a turnover frequency of 240 min(-1) in ammonia borane hydrolysis at 298 K. Density functional theory simulation suggests that the V-O-Pd ensemble is responsible for the high intrinsic catalytic activity. Water molecules tend to be dissociated on V-O sites and ammonia borane molecules on Pd atoms. Those H atoms from water dissociation on V-O combine with H atoms from ammonia borane on Pd atoms to generate H-2. This insights into engineering vacancy-atom ensembles catalysis provide a new avenue to design catalytic materials for important energy chemical reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2575-0356		WOS:000786406000001

Especially, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires high overpotentials (eta) to overcome the high thermodynamic energy barrier toward water splitting. Herein, both Mo and Ce with large ionic radius are incorporated into RuO2 to redistribute electronic structures around Ru_O bonds, promoting the activity and stability of RuO2. The representative Ru3MoCeOx exhibits superior activity with an overpotential of 164 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and excellent stability of 100 h (100 mA cm-2) in acidic media. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and micro characterizations reveal that introduction of Mo and Ce into RuO2 effectively tune Ru-O bonds covalency, modulate electron correlations and reduce energy barrier of the intermediates from 0.78 to 0.60 eV. The outstanding activity and long-term stability indicate that Ru3MoCeOx could be acted as efficient anode catalyst in PEM electrolyzers for water splitting.									15	1	0	0	2	0	16			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000702150200003

The electrocatalytic properties of the material was investigated by recording cyclic voltammogram (CV) and anodic polarization curve in 1 M KOH at 25 degrees C. The experiments have been performed in a three-electrode single compartment glass cell in which the synthesized oxide was taken as anode in the form of film electrode. Auxiliary and reference electrodes were Pt-foil (area similar to 2 cm(2)) and Hg/HgO/1M KOH, respectively. The CV recorded in the potential region 0.0 - 0.7 V, exhibited an anodic (Ep(a) = 495 +/- 14 mV) and corresponding cathodic peaks (Ep(c) = 353 +/- 38 mV) prior to onset of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Anodic polarization study indicates that substitution of Sr in the base oxide (LaCoO3) enhanced the electrocatalytic properties of the material. The activity was found to be highest with 0.8 Sr-substitution. At E = 800 mV, it produced current density j = 261.8 mA cm(-2), which is about 65 times higher than the base oxide. Values of Tafel slope and reaction order as given in Table 2, describe that each oxide electrode has different mechanistic path towards OER. Thermodynamic parameters, such as standard entropy of activation (Delta S degrees(#)), standard enthalpy of activation (Delta H degrees(#)) and standard electrochemical energy of activation (Delta H-cl degrees(#)) have been estimated for each oxide electrode. Materials have also been analysed for their perovskite phase and morphology by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques, respectively.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1452-3981			WOS:000502341900056

In this work, we report a highly efficient Cu-doped RuO2 OER electrocatalyst (Cu-RuO2) synthesized via one-step calcination of amorphous RuCu sample in air atmosphere. Results show that the catalytic performances of Cu-RuO2 catalysts toward OER are strongly dependent on the calcination temperature. Among the series of Cu-RuO2 catalysts, Cu-RuO2 prepared at the calcination temperature of 300 degrees C (Cu-RuO2-300) exhibits the highest activity for OER. At the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), Cu-RuO2-300 shows an extremely low OER overpotential of 201 mV, which is much lower than the benchmark commercial RuO2 (233 mV) and most noble metal/non-noble metal catalysts reported in literature. The Tafel slope is as low as 55 mV dec(-1), which is also lower than that on RuO2 catalyst (76 mV dec(-1)), suggesting a faster OER kinetics. In addition, Cu-RuO2-300 can maintain excellent durability in H2SO4 electrolyte. During the chronopotentiometric (CP) test, the potential of Cu-RuO2-300 catalyst shows very small attenuation (65 mV) at the time of 24 h whereas that of the reference RuO2 catalyst exhibits a 127 mV of change only within 4 h of test. Large electrochemical surface area and abundant exposed high-index facets are responsible for the high catalytic performances of the Cu-RuO2-300 catalyst. This work is instructive for the design and preparation of highly efficient and stable noble metal-based OER catalysts in acidic media. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The synthesized Co2TiO4 octahedral nanocrystals of size 50 to 210 nm showed excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in 0.5 M H2SO4, which was comparable to IrO2 and better than spinel Co3O4 when examined under identical experimental conditions. Overpotential of just 513 mV was sufficient enough to drive a kinetic current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is a significant figure of merit as far as acidic water oxidation electrocatalysis is concerned.									28	0	0	0	1	0	28			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000474475800038	31185540

However, their poor durability (mostly < 100 h) and controversial reconstruction mechanism restrict their practical applications. Herein, a new-type polyoxomolybdate-organic complex (POMo) via wet-chemistry synthesis with fixed coordination between metal centers (Ni2+ and [Mo8O26](4-)) and 2-Methylimidazole ligand is introduced. After introducing iron, a series of Fe-doped Ni-POMo with porous and amorphous structures are fabricated. These features accelerate the diffusion-leaching processes of ligands and anions, resulting in rapid and complete phase reconstruction during alkaline OER. As a result, nickel-iron (oxy)hydroxides with rich vacancies and poly-/low-crystalline features are in situ generated through dissolution-redeposition, and serve as the OER-active species. The optimized Fe0.052Ni-POMo array pre-catalyst has excellent activity and sustains ultrastable catalysis for 545 h. The complete reconstruction of POMo enables high catalytic durability (230 h) and stable active phase under realistic conditions (30 wt% KOH, 60.9 degrees C). Accordingly, the completely reconstructed catalysts with unique structures and ultrastable catalysis have the potential to be applied in industry.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000655923400001

Here, we designed and prepared iron-doped nickel metal-organic framework (Fe-doped Ni-MOF) by employing different initial iron sources (Fe2+, Fe3+). Specifically, Fe-doped Ni-MOF with divalent iron ions as initial iron sources exhibits superior performance with respect to trivalent iron ions, showing excellent electrocatalytic performance toward OER with an overpotential (294 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), low Tafel slope (47.45 mV dec(-1)) and large electrochemically active surface area in alkaline electrolytes. Furthermore, there is no obvious decay after long-term operation up to 25 h. To inspect the origin of OER activity enhancement, we resorted to XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS and N-2 adsorption-desorption techniques and various electrochemical methods to analyze them in detail. These studies provide a new vision into understanding Fe-doped Ni-MOF for OER, shedding light on designing novel and highly efficient MOF materials for electrocatalysis.[GRAPHICS].									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2585-7290	1336-9075		WOS:000517003400001

The seamless growth of an electrocatalyst directly from an alloy substrate would provide excellent mechanical behavior and lower interface resistance. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) intertwined Ni0.86Fe2.14O4 hexagonal plate electrocatalyst as the active site for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was successfully prepared by seamless growth and direct synthesis on Ni-Fe foam (NFF) via a hydrothermal route. Ni0.86Fe2.14O4/NFF exhibited excellent OER electrochemical properties, achieving a low overpotential of 286 mV to reach a current density of 200 mA cm(-2) and prominent electrochemical durability. The synergistic effect between Ni and Fe in Ni0.86Fe2.14O4 and the seamless connection between Ni0.86Fe2.14O4 and the substrate make main contribution to excellent OER activity for the electrode system. This synthesis strategy provides a route for the synthesis of binary metal-oxide electrocatalysts from alloys, which can be extended to other binary electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2365-6549			WOS:000510247300046

The Co3O4 QDs with a mean size of 5 nm were synthesized by reacting cobalt acetate with benzyl alcohol in the presence of ammonia under reflux conditions. The as-synthesized Co3O4 QDs show extraordinary water oxidation activity with onset overpotential as low as 398 mV and mass activity as high as 567 A/g (at 1.75 V vs RHE) in a 0.2 M phosphate buffer electrolyte (pH similar to 7), which are among the most efficient Earth-abundant OER catalysts at neutral pH reported in the literature, reaching a stable current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of similar to 490 mV with a Tafel slope of 80 mV/decade. Through in-depth investigations by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the high spin Co2+ and Co3+ cations on the surface of Co3O4 QDs were found to be important to promote the OER kinetics at neutral pH.									20	1	0	0	2	0	20			0888-5885			WOS:000424851800012

Defect engineering is an effective strategy to improve the intrinsic ability of electrocatalysts by tailoring their electronic structure. Herein, we have successfully synthesized IrO2/Ir heterophase with compressive strain and metal vacancies via a simple substitution-etching method. In virtue of the solubility of Cr in strong alkali, metal vacancies could be formed at surface after etching Cr-doped IrO2/Ir in alkali, which leaded to modulated electronic structure. Meanwhile, the substitution of Cr with smaller atom radius would induce the formation of compressive strain and the relocated atoms made the d-band center shifted. With the regulated electronic structure and tuned d-band center, the obtained electrocatalyst only needed 285 mV to reach 10 mA.cm(-2) in 0.1 M HCIO4. Reaction kinetic has been rapidly accelerated as indicated by the smaller Tafel slope and charge transfer resistance. Theoretical calculations revealed that the d-band center and charge density distribution have been regulated with the introduction of defects in IrO2/Ir, which significantly decreased the free energy barrier of rate determining step. This work provides a valuable reference to design effective and defects-rich electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000849173500002

In this paper, we report the preparation of hierarchical hollow NiFe hydroxide nanospheres assembled from ultrathin nanosheets as the OER electrocatalyst via a simple and gentle self-templating strategy, which includes two steps: the synthesis of Ni(OH)(2) nanospheres precursor and its further transformation to the final hollow-spheres after the introduction of Fe3+ via a mild hydrothermal method. The hollow NiFe hydroxide nanospheres were proven to be composed of ultrathin nanosheets which formed porous walls. This unique structure achieved numerous mass transfer channels for electrolytes, ideal pathways for ions and electrons, and a high specific surface area, leading to the improved performance for the product during the electrocatalytic reaction. In addition, the charge transfer rate and structural stability of the architecture have been greatly improved after the addition of Fe3+, which guaranteed high electrochemical performance toward OER.

Herein we report an in-situ cobalt and nitrogen co-doped mesoporous graphitic carbon catalysts by directly pyrolyzing hyperbranched cobalt phthalocyanine (H-CoPc), which can efficiently catalyze HER in acidic, alkaline or neutral electrolytes. With only 0.62 at% of cobalt dopants, the outstanding Co@NG-800 catalyst exhibits excellent durability and HER activities with the overpotential as low as 286 mV in acid, 290 mV in alkaline and 480mV in neutral, achieved at 10 mA cm(-2) current density. These activities indicate that the Co@NG-800 catalyst can couple with the best available oxygen-evolving catalysts in the overall water-splitting. Meanwhile, the mesoporous structure derived from H-CoPc provides more active sites than un-hyperbranched precursor. This work may provide a novel organic metal complexes and simple route in designing highly active and durable transition metal and nitride co-doped carbonaceous electrocatalysts for HER.

In this catalyst, the cubic structure of KNiFe(CN)(6) grows on the surface of the nickel foam (NF) to form a three-dimensional network structure. The formation of KNiFe(CN)(6) is based on the substitution of K+ by Ni2+ in K-3 [Fe(CN)(6)]. During this substitution process, some K+ vacancies will be formed in KNiFe(CN)(6), so that the catalytic activity can be improved.

An effective mitigation strategy is to involve oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts into the anode to facilitate water electrolysis against carbon corrosion. As such, this paper aims to study the influence of relative humidity (RH) on the performance and durability of reversal-tolerant-anodes (RTAs) during hydrogen starvation. An advanced segmented technique is employed to examine the coupling reactions by simultaneously measuring current density, RH and temperature in a fuel cell with a large active area. It is found that the inlet of RTAs undergoes degradation earlier than the outlet and the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with a RTA has an optimal humidity during cell reversal. Results also show that the failure of the RTA MEA is due to a loss of electron conduction medium rather than the deactivation of the OER catalyst. In addition, this work highlights the importance of plate flow field design and the OER catalyst gradient design of the RTA MEA.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000510947000051

However, their sluggish kinetics on the cathode side is considered the main barrier to high performance. The rational design of electrode catalysts with high activity is therefore an important challenge. To solve this issue, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to analyze the adsorption behavior of the LiO2 molecule, which is considered to be a key intermediate in both the Li-oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the evolution reaction (OER). Specifically, to use the activity descriptor approach, the LiO2 adsorption energy, which has previously been demonstrated to be a reliable descriptor of the cathode reaction in Li-air batteries, was calculated on LaB1-xB'xO3(001) (B, B' = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, x = 0.0, 0.5). Our fast screening results showed that LaMnO3, LaMn0.5Fe0.5O3, or LaFeO3 would be good candidate catalysts. We believe that our results will provide a way to more efficiently develop new cathode materials for Li-air batteries.									3	2	0	0	0	0	4			1229-7801			KJD:ART002112020

Ultrathin MFe-LDH nanoplatelets (200-300 nm in lateral length; 8-12 nm in thickness) perpendicular to the substrate surface are directly prepared within hundreds of seconds (<300 s) under cathodic potential. The as-obtained NiFe-LDH nanoplatelet arrays display promising behavior in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), giving rise to a rather low overpotential (0.224 V) at 10.0 mA cm(-2) with largely enhanced stability, much superior to previously reported electro-oxidation catalysts as well as the state-of-the-art Ir/C catalyst. Furthermore, the MFe-LDH nanoplatelet arrays can also efficiently catalyze several other fuel molecules' oxidation (e.g., hydrazine, methanol and ethanol), delivering a satisfactory electrocatalytic activity and a high operation stability. In particular, this preparation method of Fe-containing LDHs is amenable to fast, effective and large-scale production, and shows promising applications in water splitting, fuel cells and other clean energy devices.									316	30	0	0	16	1	326			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000362977000074	29435211

However, the challenges facing this complicated battery system still limit their practical applications. These challenges mainly consist of inefficient product evolution and low-activity catalysts. In present work, a cation occupying, modified 3D-architecture NiFeO cubic spinel is constructed via superassembly strategy to achieve a high rate, stable electrocatalyst for LOBs. The octahedron predominant spinel provides a stable polycrystal structure and optimized electronic structure, which dominates the discharge/charge products evolution with multiformation kinetics of crystal Li2O2 and Li2-xO2 at low and high rate conditions and energetically favors the mass transport between the electrode/electrolyte interface. Simultaneously, the porous NiFeO framework provides adequate spaces for Li2O2 accommodation and complex channels for sufficient electrolyte, oxygen, and ion transportation, which dramatically alter the cathode catalysis for an unprecedented performance. As a consequence, a large specific capacity of 23413 mAh g(-1) and an excellent cyclability of 193 cycles at a high current of 1000 mA g(-1), and 300 cycles at a current of 500 mA g(-1), are achieved. The present work provides intrinsic insights into designing high-performance metal oxide electrocatalysts for Li-O-2 batteries with fine-tuned electronic and frame structure.									40	2	0	0	1	0	40			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000539283600006

Herein, self-supported and hollow porous MoO3/NiF2 heterogeneous nanowires for excellent OER catalytst have been designed via an advanced top-down strategy. Fluorinating the precursor nanowires of NiMoO4 successfully activates the Ni sites in the material and constructs porous MoO3/NiF2 heterogeneous nanowires. The hollow nanowires with abundant porous structure provide large specific surface area, while the heterogeneous interfaces cause rich electro-active sites to facilitate the electron transfer, which contribute to the significant improvement in the OER performance of the material in alkaline solution. Consequently, the catalysts of hollow porous MoO3/NiF2 nanowires grown on Ni foam deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) with the overpotential of 272 mV in OER and exhibit a good durability of 50 h at high current density of 100 mA cm(-2). This study further proves that the reasonable micro-morphology construction and interface engineering design can boost up the electrocatalytic activities. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a tert-butyl substituted copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) ultrathin layer is introduced at the interface of a BiVO4 film and a NiCo-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) OEC layer as a hole transport highway to promote the extraction and transport of photoinduced holes and inhibit the charge recombination for improving the PEC water splitting performance of the BiVO4 photoanode. Under simulated sunlight (AM1.5G) illumination, the designed NiCo-LDH/CuPc/BiVO4 photoanode delivers a high applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of 1.28% at a low bias of 0.67 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and the photocurrent density increases to 2.36 mA cm(-2) (at 0.67 V vs. RHE) and 4.03 mA cm(-2) (at 1.23 V vs. RHE), which is 7.8 and 3.4 times higher than that of the single BiVO4 photoanode, respectively. The significantly improved PEC performance in the low bias range mirrors that the decorated NiCo-LDH/CuPc layers on BiVO4 film can effectively reduce the energy barrier for the water oxidation. This research provides a promising strategy for improving solar-driven water oxidation by introducing an efficient hole transport layer (HTL) at the semiconductor/OEC interface and expands the design idea of PEC water splitting devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000841685600001

Here, the interaction of a well-established, nanocrystalline and mesoporous Ca-birnessite catalyst material (initial composition K0.2Ca0.21MnO2.21 center dot 1.4H(2)O, initial Mn-oxidation state similar to+3.8) with an aqueous potassium phosphate buffer electrolyte at pH 7 was studied mainly by using various electron microscopy and X-ray spectroscopy techniques. In comparison to electrolyte solutions not containing phosphate, the investigated Ca-birnessite electrodes show especially high and stable oxygen evolution activity in phosphate buffer. During electrolysis, partial ion substitutions of Ca2+ by K+ and OH-/O2- by HnPO4(3-n)- were observed, leading to the formation of a stable, partially disordered Ca-K-Mn-HnPO4-H2O layer on the outer and the pore surfaces of the active electrocatalyst material. In this surface layer, Mn3+ ions are stabilized, which are often assumed to be of key importance for oxygen evolution catalysis. Furthermore, evidence for the formation of [Ca/PO4/H2O](-) complexes located between the [MnO6] layers of the birnessite was found using the soft Ca 2p and Ca L-edge X-ray spectroscopy. A possible way to interpret the observed, obviously very favorable "special relationship" between (hydrogen)phosphates and Ca-birnessites in electrocatalytic water oxidation would be that HnPO4(3-n)- anions are incorporated into the catalyst material where they act as stabilizing units for Mn3+ highly active centers and also as "internal bases" for the protons released during the water-oxidation reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000702489700001

These promising applications call for a fundamental understanding of the catalyst/electrolyte interaction, which is challenging to investigate during operation conditions. This work reports an operando structure-reactivity analysis of NiFe LDH as the electrocatalyst for the OER in alkaline and alkalinized NaCl electrolytes, by combining operando wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and electrochemical characterization. The operando results showed that higher pH values lead to a higher percentage of the OER active gamma-NiFe LDH in the composition of the catalyst layer, larger Ni redox peaks, and higher OER activity. The addition of 0.5 M NaCl to moderate alkaline electrolytes (0.1-0.5 M KOH) also leads to larger Ni redox features and higher activity but appears to limit the percentage of gamma-NiFe LDH during the OER in comparison to the corresponding NaCl-free electrolytes. Interestingly, a higher KOH concentration (1.0 M KOH, pH 14) could compensate this structural effect aligning the percentage of OER-active gamma-NiFe LDH in both NaCl-free and NaCl-containing electrolytes. Additional scan rate investigations showed a strong correlation of the electrochemical accessibility of NiFe LDH with its history, scan rate, and NaCl addition. In particular, the faster and more effective break-in process induced by NaCl addition is proposed as the origin of the enhanced activity at low pH, despite the lower gamma-phase percentage.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000664333800006

Several catalysts have been shown to promote the formation of LiOH during discharge. However, LiOH has been difficult to reoxidize to form oxygen on charging. Here, we report that, in the presence of water, Co3O4 promotes the formation of LiOH on discharge via a 4 e(-)/O-2 process with few side reactions, forming large (001) facet-exposed LiOH flakes. Hydroperoxide LiOOH was detected as a potential discharge intermediate. During charge, O-2 evolution was detected along with LiOH decomposition up to 3.9 V; at higher voltages, products from parasitic reactions can be detected. This work provides new insights into the role of solid catalysts in LiOH chemistry in LOBs, and will help promote the development of reversible and long-lasting LiOH-based LOBs.									19	2	0	0	0	0	19			2380-8195			WOS:000599605500004

Herein, the effects of operating temperature, gas atmosphere, applied current density and electrolysis time on the gas-liquid interfacial corrosion behaviors of nickel anodes in molten Li2CO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3 were systematically investigated. It was found that the gas-liquid interfacial corrosion of nickel anodes was accelerated with decreasing temperature and increasing CO2 content of gas atmosphere. Three distinct corrosion regions of nickel anodes can be identified: (I) the thin salt film region, (II) the meniscus region, and (III) the full immersion region. It was revealed that the formation of negative basicity gradient in the meniscus induced the dissolution/re-precipitation of NiO scale, thereby accelerating the gas-liquid interfacial corrosion of nickel anodes. Furthermore, an Al2O3 sheath was applied to shield the gas-liquid part of nickel electrodes to prevent gas-liquid interfacial corrosion, thus making Ni a stable oxygen-evolution inert anode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000766362000001

We previously demonstrated that by adding sodium acetate (NaOAc) in the electrolyte, the life span of SLFBs can be significantly extended. Here, we aim to elucidate the effect of acetate additive on SLFBs. We find that the mechanical strength of the PbO2 layer plated by acetate-assisted electrolyte is materially enhanced. Through electron back-scattering diffraction, certain preferred orientations of deposited PbO2 are observed when plated without acetate additive, while random orientations are better preserved when plated with acetate additive. Via Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurements, we find that porosity and surface area are both comparatively smaller in the acetate-assisted PbO2 deposits, while the rate of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is shown to be drastically reduced on PbO2 plated with NaOAc-assisted electrolyte. We further propose that the OER pathway is suppressed by the additive due to acetate-ion adsorption at superficial PbO2 sites, and in turn facilitates PbO2 plating. These further discoveries are of critical value for further extending cycle life and enabling SLFB technology.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000586710300014

The multiple efforts have been concentrated on bifunctional electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Only a few works reach desirable durability and performance levels. Here, Co!VN heterostructure with rational porous structure is formed in response to the sensible cobalt and vanadium ratio. Owing to synergistic interaction of holey interconnected structure with large surface area of 57 m(2) g(-1) and abundant interfaces between Co and VN phases, CoNN@NC presents superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performance towards both HER and ORR. Co/VN@NC drives the reaction with low overpotential eta(10) of 96 mV and Tafel slope of 82 mV dec(-1) along with outstanding stability for HER. Furthermore, Co/VN@NC obtains an onset potential (0.954 V) and half-wave potential (0.796 V) with superior methanol tolerance and durability for ORR. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Reaction characteristics of the purified desulphurized slag OC with the selected lignite as well as release of the different gaseous sulfur species from the CaSO_4 side reactions were investigated on in a lab-scale fixed bed reactor. Several main influencing factors,including reaction temperature,OC excess number Phi and the cycle numbers,were focused. The experimental results indicated that the purified CaSO_4 OC was of high reactivity and promising to be applied in the coal-fueled chemical looping combustion process as OC. Furthermore,according to the pros and cons of the three influencing factors on the carbon conversion versus the gaseous sulfur release,the optimized reaction conditions were determined as 900 ℃ and the OC excess number around 1.0. Finally,under this optimized reaction condition,the effect of the cycle numbers was evaluated and found that the continuous release of gaseous sulfur from the CaSO_4 side reactions deteriorated the reactivity of the purified CaSO_4 OC and its reaction stability was diminished with the five cycles.			基于电厂烟气脱硫渣,采用多步酸洗工艺加以提纯并制备获得CaSO_4载氧体。在高温固定床反应器上研究了还原反应温度、载氧体过量系数Phi、多次还原氧化循环等因素对提纯脱硫渣载氧体与煤化学链燃烧特性和气相硫演化规律的影响。结果表明,提纯脱硫渣载氧体有较高的反应活性,能够促进煤的充分转化;综合考虑碳的转化以及气相硫释放的抑制,最优反应工况中还原反应温度确定为900 ℃、载氧体过量系数Phi= 1.0为最佳。经过五次还原氧化循环实验发现,随着循环次数的增加,CaSO_4副反应的进行及气相硫的不断释放,导致提纯脱硫渣载氧体循环反应活性略有降低,反应稳定性受到了一定的影响。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0253-2409			CSCD:6809307

The efficiency of the instability increases for the flame propagating in the layers of lower density in comparison with the flame in the central part of the white dwarf. The instability is also more efficient for the flame supported by oxygen thermonuclear reactions in comparison with the flame supported by carbon reactions. This is because the reaction time in the flame becomes more sensitive to the temperature variation with the decrease of initial density and with the decrease of initial carbon fraction of the fuel. The average velocity of the flame front propagating in the pulsating regime is smaller than the velocity of a steady flame. The flame velocity is reduced as a result of pulsations by 3% for the flames supported by carbon reactions and by 25% for the flames supported by oxygen reactions.									19	0	1	0	0	0	20			0004-637X			WOS:A1995RV62600028

Notable crystalline distortion was induced by manganese insertion into Co(3)O(4 )lattice, resulting in smaller crystallite size, more abundant Co2+ and considerable oxygen vacancies. All these properties were regarded as the crucial origins for electrocatalytic activity elevation. The catalyst annealed at 450 degrees C (denoted as Mn/Co-450) exhibited the optimal catalytic activity with an ultra-low potential gap (0.83 V). Using Mn/Co-450 as an air cathode, the zinc-air battery delivered high power density (115.5 mW cm(-2)), competitive specific capacity (783.4 mAh g(-1)) and good cycling stability. The theoretical overpotentials of ORR and OER were respectively decreased by 0.18 V and 0.05 V by DFT calculation due to the weakened interaction between Co and OH group and the strengthened Co-OOH interaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000861078900001

Autoxidation is a double-edged sword: it could in-situ generate high-catalytic activity sites to accelerate OER, but it also results in the attenuation of conductivity and the dissolution of active components. In this work, we propose a new strategy to relieve the negative impacts of autoxidation on OER through designing three-dimensional (3D) iron-nickel sulfide nanosheets/reduced graphene oxide (FeNiS2 NS/rGO) nanohybrids via a one-pot colloidal method, which enabled the well dispersion and strong coupling of FeNiS2 NS on the rGO. Such an interconnected 3D architecture could facilitate excellent electron transport, provide large amounts of active sites and prevent the dissolution of active components. The FeNiS2 NS/rGO delivered extremely low overpotentials of 270 mV and 200 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and rapid kinetics with Tafe slope of 38 mV dec(-1) and 40 mV dec(-1) for OER in 0.1 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Moreover, they could retain a great stability without activity loss over long-term continuous electrolysis and long-ageing time under air conditions. This work provides an efficient approach to resolve the autoxidation problem of FeNiS2 NS in the OER process and develops a promising earth-abundant OER electrocatalyst towards practical applications.									56	4	0	0	4	0	56			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000419832100036

However, the development of a convenient and scalable method for the synthesis of such multi-compositionally complex hollow structures remains a big challenge. Herein, we report an efficient and universal strategy to fabricate a variety of porous hollow oxide nanocomposites (Co3O4/SiO2, Co3O4/TiO2, ZnO/SiO2, and ZnO/TiO2) composed of nanosized subunits, which involves a sol-gel process to form a shell onto the dodecahedral zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) template and a subsequent thermolysis-induced transformation of the template at appropriate temperatures. Such a multi-compositional hollow structure with a large surface area endows the materials with exceptional properties and performances. As an example, we demonstrated that these complex hollow oxide composites, especially the Co3O4/SiO2 hollow dodecahedra, exhibit a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance as oxygen evolution photocatalysts.									48	1	0	0	2	0	48			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000347373500017	25463049

A superior catalytic activity was obtained for PBC, which was much higher than that of the most popular Co3O4 nanocatalyst. More importantly, a detailed mechanism of PMS activation on the MIEC perovskite was proposed. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and radical competitive reactions suggested that both sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-) and hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) participated in and played important roles in the catalytic oxidation processes. Oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O-2-TPD) demonstrated that the PBC perovskite oxide is capable of facilitating an easier valence-state change of the B-site cation (cobalt ions) to mediate a redox process. Additionally, the oxygen vacancies could facilitate the bonding with PMS molecules and promote the reactivity of cobalt ions for PMS activation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also performed to evidence charge transfer and surface reaction rates of the PBC catalyst that are much faster than those of Co3O4. Additionally, suppressed cobalt leaching was also achieved through tailoring the pH value of the reaction solution. This study provides insight into MIEC perovskites in catalytic reactions and applications.									191	6	0	0	73	0	192			2155-5435			WOS:000391783200046		
J	Li, Xialiang; Lei, Haitao; Xie, Lisi; Wang, Ni; Zhang, Wei; Cao, Rui								Metalloporphyrins as Catalytic Models for Studying Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution and Oxygen Reduction Reactions								ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH				55	6			878	892		10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00753				MAR 15 2022	2022	CONSPECTUS: The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are involved in biological and artificial energy conversions. H-H and O-O bond formation/cleavage are essential steps in these reactions. In nature, intermediates involved in the H-H and O-O bond formation/cleavage are highly reactive and short-lived, making their identification and investigation difficult. In artificial catalysis, the realization of these reactions at considerable rates and close to their thermodynamic reaction equilibria remains a challenge. Therefore, the elucidation of the reaction mechanisms and structure-function relationships is of fundamental significance to understand these reactions and to develop catalysts.This Account describes our recent investigations on catalytic HER, OER, and ORR with metalloporphyrins and derivatives. Metalloporphyrins are used in nature for light harvesting, energy conversion, electron transfer, O-2 activation, and peroxide degradation. Synthetic metal porphyrin complexes are shown to be active for these reactions. We focused on exploring metalloporphyrins to study reaction mechanisms and structure-function relationships because they have stable and tunable structures and characteristic spectroscopic properties.For HER, we identified three H-H bond formation mechanisms and established the correlation between these processes and metal hydride electronic structures. Importantly, we provided direct experimental evidence for the bimetallic homolytic H-H bond formation mechanism by using sterically bulky porphyrins. Homolytic HER has been long proposed but rarely verified because the coupling of active hydride intermediates occurs spontaneously and quickly, making their detection challenging. By blocking the bimolecular mechanism through steric effects, we stabilized and characterized the NiIII-H intermediate and verified homolytic HER by comparing the reaction behaviors of Ni porphyrins with and without steric effects. We therefore provided an unprecedented example to control homolytic versus heterolytic HER mechanisms through tuning steric effects of molecular catalysts.For the OER, the water nucleophilic attack (WNA) on high-valent terminal Mn-oxo has been proposed for the O-O bond formation in natural and artificial water oxidation. By using Mn tris(pentafluorophenyl)corrole, we identified MnV(O) and MnIV-peroxo intermediates in chemical and electrochemical OER and provided direct experimental evidence for the Mn-based WNA mechanism. Moreover, we demonstrated several catalyst design strategies to enhance the WNA rate, including the pioneering use of protective axial ligands. By studying Cu porphyrins, we proposed a bimolecular coupling mechanism between two metal-hydroxide radicals to form O-O bonds. Note that late-transition metals do not likely form terminal metal-oxo/oxyl.For the ORR, we presented several strategies to improve activity and selectivity, including providing rapid electron transfer, using electron-donating axial ligands, introducing hydrogen-bonding interactions, constructing dinuclear cooperation, and employing porphyrin-support domino catalysis. Importantly, we used Co porphyrin atropisomers to realize both two-electron and four-electron ORR, representing an unparalleled example to control ORR selectivity by tuning only steric effects without modifying molecular and/or electronic structures.Lastly, we developed several strategies to graft metalloporphyrins on various electrode materials through different covalent bonds. The molecular-engineered materials exhibit boosted electrocatalytic performance, highlighting promising applications of molecular electrocatalysis. Taken together, this Account demonstrates the benefits of exploring metalloporphyrins for the HER, OER, and ORR. The knowledge learned herein is valuable for the development of porphyrin-based catalysts and also other molecular and material catalysts for small molecule activation reactions.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000771914800008	35192330

In view of this, herein, a one-dimensional bifunctional heterogeneous nanocatalyst consisting of SnO2 capped Pt nanorods (Pt-SnOx NRs) is developed via the formic acid reduction method (FAM), showing high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. The performance of the as-prepared Pt-SnOx NRs was 1.4-fold higher than that of the commercial J.M.-Pt/C catalyst with an outstanding mass activity (MA) of 160 mA mg(Pt)(-1) at 0.85 V vs. SHE towards the ORR in acidic medium. Of special relevance, these Pt-SnOx NRs exhibit notable stability and retained 87% of their initial MA when operated up to 5k cycles in an accelerated durability test (ADT) in the ORR. Moreover, the Pt-SnOx NRs achieved a remarkably lower overpotential (eta) of 48 mV (at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and a Tafel slope of 33 mV dec (-1) in the HER, significantly lower than those of the commercial J.M.-Pt/C catalyst (eta = 60 mV and Tafel slope = 38 mV dec(-1)). Besides, such a material maintained its 100% HER activity in a chronoamperometric (CA) stability test up to 6 h. By cross-referencing the results of structural and electrochemical inspections, such a high bifunctional performance of Pt-SnOx NRs is attributed to the synergistic collaboration between the SnO2 modifier and Pt atoms. The SnO2 accelerates the HO-H bond cleavage during the HER and simultaneously promotes the desorption of oxygen species on the Pt surface in the ORR, which later triggers the reduction reaction performance. Meanwhile, SnO2 provides a shielding effect to Pt under harsh reduction conditions and thus high stability of Pt-SnOx NRs is achieved.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2398-4902			WOS:000651770000001

Herein, a novel and convenient tactic is developed to design and fabricate the tetrazole-functionalized COF materials with abundant nitrogen atoms, which can provide active sites, facilitating the incorporation of COFs with metal ions. In particular, a beta-ketoenamine-linked COF named COF-TpDb is selected as precursor for postsynthetic modification to introduce the tetrazole moieties to coordinate with metal ions cobalt (Co2+) and palladium (Pd2+), giving two functional metal-coordinated COFs complexes COF-TpDb-TZ-Co and COF-TpDb-TZ-Pd. The resultant COF-TpDb-TZ-Co displays a higher oxygen evolution reaction activity with a lower overpotential of 390 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is much enhanced compared with COF-TpDb-TZ. The tactic for the fabrication of tetrazole-functionalized COFs with abundant nitrogen atoms implements rational design for the construction of functional COFs and expands the promising application of metal coordinated COF materials in electrocatalysis.

However, high cost and limited catalytic performance of Ir hamper its large-scale industrial application. Here, based on a modified galvanic replacement, we introduce Cu nanoparticles as a template to prepare single-crystalline Cu-Ir polyhedral nanocages (NCs). Alloying Ir with 3d transition metal Cu not only significantly reduces the loading of Ir but also remarkably enhances its catalytic activity by forming a unique NC structure and tuning the d-band structure of Ir. The as-prepared single-crystalline Cu1.11Ir NCs exhibit enhanced catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.05M H2SO4, with a smaller overpotential (286 mV) required for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 43.8 mV per decade. The mass activity can reach 73 mA mg(Ir)(-1) at an overpotential of 0.28 V for Cu1.11Ir NCs. Hence, the obtained Cu1.11Ir NCs would be a promising electrocatalyst for practical electrocatalytic water splitting systems.									83	3	0	0	3	0	84			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000362041300005

In this work, we report a facile and scalable method for syntheizing threedimensional (3D) macroporous Co-embedded N-doped carbon interconnecting with in situ growth carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The as-synthesized material exhibits great electrocatalytic performance for ORR. with an onset potential of 0.901 V vs RHE as well as a high limited current density of 4.83 mA/cm(2) in an alkaline electrolyte under a rotation speed of 1600 rpm at 5 mV/s. Furthermore, this 3D porous carbon also shows good electrocatalytic performance for OER in an alkaline electrolyte. This high electrocatalytic performance is mainly attributed to its large specific surface area and highly conductive CNTs and the synergistic effect between Co-active species and the carbon framework. The result of a two-electrode Zn air battery based on this carbon material achieves a peak density of 163 mW/cm(2) at a voltage of 0.63 V, indicating the great potential of the catalyst for battery application.									19	0	0	0	3	0	19			0743-7463			WOS:000424730500019	29268021

It is shown that the three ignition limits can be theoretically obtained by considering only the linear system involving at most only one radical in each reaction, while the influences of the nonlinear reactions, each involving two radicals, together with thermal feedback, introduce higher-order corrections, particularly for the third ignition limit. It is also demonstrated that the high diffusivity of H-2 promotes ignition at the third limit. On the other hand, the high diffusivity of the H atom suppresses ignition at the first limit, while the assumption of unity Lewis number for H yields remarkably good results for the other two limits. Furthermore, by solving the time evolution of the crucial H and HO2 radicals, simplified formulations of the three individual limits and the two quadratic double limits are obtained analytically, in analogy with results for the homogeneous explosion problem.

High-valent transition-metal sites have been considered as OER active sites; however, the rational design and construction of these sites remain a big challenge. Here, we report a trimetallic NiFeCu oxyhydroxide electrocatalyst, in which high-valent Ni sites are promoted and stabilized by the atomically embedded Cu, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Through compositional optimization, Ni6Fe1Cu1 catalysts achieved an overpotential of 385 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 164 mV dec(-1), and a stability of 100 h at pH = 7.2. Density function theory calculations demonstrated that the Cu-doping facilitates the formation of high-valent Ni and thus promotes OER electrocatalysis through modulating the d-band center of Ni and reducing the adsorption energy of oxygenated intermediates on the surface of the catalyst. This work paves a promising avenue for the construction of desired high-valent metal OER catalysts by embedding redox inactive metals.									49	8	0	0	0	0	49			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700007

Herein, the 2D bimetal Co-TCPP(Fe) metal-organic framework (MOF) is synthesized and then adopted as the precursor to prepare a 2D composite electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). After carbonization and phosphorization, the 2D MOF is transformed into a composite nanoplate formed by Fe-doped CoP nanoparticles and a carbon matrix (Fe-CoP/C). This Fe-CoP/C composite exhibits a favorable OER performance in 1 M KOH with a low overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is better than that of counterparts without Fe and 2D morphology. The in situ formed metal (oxy)hydroxide is considered to be the main active species for the OER. The improved OER performance of Fe-CoP/C could be attributed to the Fe-doping in Co (oxy)hydroxide as well as the high electrochemical surface area induced by the 2D nanoplate morphology and conductive carbon network.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000781534700001

Herein, mesoporous Fe-doped Co-Ni oxide (CoNiFeOx) nanosheets grown on nickel foam are synthesized by a facile two-step strategy (a combination of hydrothermal and post-annealing). Benefiting from the mesoporous nanosheet structure, endowing the catalysts with a high specific surface area (222.6 m(2) g(-1)) and more active sites, and the optimized electronic structure due to the incorporation of Fe, the as-synthesized mesoporous CoNiFeOx nanosheets as a binder-free electrode exhibits remarkable OER activity with an overpotential of only 221 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 43.8 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. Besides, it displays excellent stability for over 250 h and no obvious activity decline is measured after the long-term stability test.

Herein, defectrich heterogeneous crystalline (Ni, Fe, Co)S-2/amorphous NiFeCo(OH) y nanotubes/nanobelts (nNFCS NTs/NBs) are fabricated mainly by a facile cyclic voltammetry electrodeposition. By enriching exposing active sites and optimizing coordination environment via the construction of crystalline sulfide/amorphous hydroxide heterostructures, incorporation of Fe, Co, Ni, rich surface defects, and one-dimensional NTs/NBs structure, the nNFCS catalyst presents a fascinating OER electrocatalytic activity. Ultralow overpotentials of 193 and 225 mV at 10 and 150 mA cm(-2) , respectively, are achieved with a small Tafel slop of 36.9 mV dec(-1 ), which excels most reported sulfide, hydroxide catalysts and IrO2.

However, this protein is not absolutely required for water-splitting and its precise role remains to be clarified. We have used flash-induced thermoluminescence and oxygen evolution measurements to characterize the process of water oxidation in the IC2 mutant of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 from which the psbO gene had been deleted by Mayes et al. (Mayes, S.R., Cook, K.M., Self, S.J., Zhang, Z. and Barber, J. (1991) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1060, 1-12). The thermoluminescence results show that the extent of charge stabilization in the S2Q(A)-and S2Q(B)- states is reduced in the IC2 mutant to about 25-30% of that observed in the wild-type, suggesting that functional oxygen evolution occurs in a proportion of the psbO-less mutant cells. The stability of the S2Q(A)-, but not that of the S2Q(B)-, charge pair is markedly increased in the mutant. This points to a structural change of the PS II reaction center complex in the absence of the psbO gene product which affects the redox properties of the Q(A) and Q(B) acceptors to a different extent. The flash-induced oscillation of the B thermoluminescence band, arising from the S2Q(B)- and S3Q(B)- charge recombinations, is largely dampened in the mutant. This indicates that the ability of the water-oxidizing complex to reach its higher oxidation states, S3 and S4, is limited when the psbO gene product is absent. In agreement with the thermoluminescence results, flash-induced oxygen evolution shows a decreased yield and largely dampened oscillation pattern in the mutant. These results indicate that although the psbO gene product is not an absolute requirement for water oxidation its absence disturbs the redox cycling of the water-oxidizing complex and retards the formation of its higher S states. The rapid loss of thermoluminescence intensity during strong illumination of the mutated organism confirms its high susceptibility to photoinhibition. This effect is most likely the consequence of the limited rate of electron donation from the psbO-less water-oxidizing complex to the PS II reaction centre where the accumulation of highly oxidizing species may damage their pigment and protein surroundings.									62	1	0	0	59	0	64			0006-3002			WOS:A1992JQ99400005

However, the expensive prices of Ir and Ru severely hamper their wide use in OER. In this work, we show an efficient method for the one-pot synthesis of Ir0.4Cu0.6 microspheres. Electrochemical tests showed that the Ir-Cu microspheres as-synthesized delivered a prominent electrocatalytic activity toward OER in an acidic electrolyte with low overpotential (255 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and a small Tafel slope of 53.3 mV decade(-1). They were much better than those of commercial Ir/C (331 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 100 mV decade(-1)). Moreover, the Ir0.4Cu0.6 as-synthesized also exhibited good stability for OER under acidic conditions, that is, after 30,000 s, the change of its potential was quite small in the chronopotentiometry test. The high catalytic performance could originate from the synergistic electronic interaction between iridium and copper atoms, which could modify the d-band center of iridium.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000563095800075

Herein, we report the characteristics of Nickel-Iron nitrides, alloy heterogeneous nanostructures (Ni2Fe2N, Ni2Fe2N/Ni3Fe, Ni3Fe/Ni2Fe2N), and amorphous N-doped carbon shells differing only in nitridation temperature. Heterogeneous Nickel-Iron nitrides and alloy with amorphous N-doped carbon shells showed superior OER performance such as a low overpotential value of 251 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm2, Tafel slope of 35.0 mV/dec, and great stability even after 24 h. Additionally, this study accurately identified that the heterogeneous nanostructure and amorphous N-doped carbon shell improve the catalytic properties and durability of the Nickel-Iron nitrides and alloy nanoparticles. The morphological control strategy used to produce the heterogeneous nanostructure and amorphous N-doped carbon shell can be applied to improve electrochemical properties or encapsulation in strong alkaline solution.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000692110900004

Fabricating light-absorbers on textured substrates offers alternative routes for optimizing their PEC performance. Textured substrates would greatly enhance both light absorption and surface reactions of photoanodes and thus reduce the total amount of light absorbers needed. Herein, we report the fabrication of ultrathin BiVO4 photoanode film on textured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates by using a modified water-assisted transfer printing method. Significantly, a pristine BiVO4 photoanode of only 80 nm thick shows a photocurrent density of 1.37 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V-RHE on patterned PDMS substrates, which is further increased to similar to 2.0 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V-RHE when FeOOH oxygen evolution catalyst is added. We believe that our transfer printing method can be broadly applied to integrate photoelectrodes and other thin-film optoelectronic devices (e.g., solar cells and electronics) onto diverse textured substrates to enhance their performance.									54	3	0	0	2	0	54			2380-8195			WOS:000389617700013

(1998) Biochemistry 37: 2787]. In order to identify functional domains of the 12 kDa protein, we prepared the 12 kDa protein lacking N-terminal peptides or C-terminal peptides or both by limited proteolysis and directed mutagenesis. The resulting 12 kDa protein fragments were examined for their binding and functional properties by reconstitution experiments. (1) A peptide fragment from Gly-6 to C-terminus of the 12 kDa protein was prepared by V8 protease. This fragment rebound to PSII completely, and it reactivated oxygen evolution partially in the absence of Cl- and Ca2+ ions but significantly in the presence of Cl- ion. (2) A peptide from Leu-10 to Phe-83 was obtained by chymotrypsin treatment. This peptide rebound to PSII effectively, but the rebinding did not restore oxygen evolution in both the absence and presence of Cl- and Ca2+ ions. (3) Two mutant proteins, one lacking five residues and the other lacking nine residues of the N-terminus, were able to bind to PSII effectively. Recovery of oxygen evolution by their binding was almost the same as that reconstituted with the V8 protease-treated peptide. (4) Three mutant proteins lacking ten, seven or three residues of the C-terminus effectively rebound to PSII, but their binding did not result in recovery of the oxygen evolution. In contrast, reconstitution with a mutant protein lacking one residue of the C-terminus showed the same high restoration of oxygen evolution as reconstitution with the full-length 12 kDa protein. (5) These results indicate that two residues from lysine of the C-terminus of the 12 kDa protein constitute an important domain for minimizing the chloride and calcium requirement of oxygen evolution. In addition, the N-terminus of the protein, at least five residues, has a secondary function for the chloride requirement.									16	0	0	0	16	0	16			0032-0781			WOS:000172903500005	11773525

The loading of Zn2+ on the P surface raises the electron density, which is favorable for capturing protons in the water during the reaction, accelerating the electron transport rate, and accelerating the OER process. At the same time, we evaluated the optimal Zn2+ content ratio. When the Zn2+ to Fe3+ molar ratio is 0.5, the NiFeZnP-0.5/NF exhibits the best OER performance. The catalyst displays an overpotential of similar to 136 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), similar to 201 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope of 35 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution, and remains stable over 6 h. The C-dl of the NiFeZnP-0.5/NF electrode is 4.3 mF cm(-2), which increased by 5 times than the NiFeZn-LDHs/NF. Electrocatalysts' high performance is due to their superior electrical conductivity and synergy with the substrate.

The development and design of highly active, noble-metal free and low cost electrocatalysts is of great importance for the realization of renewable energy. Herein, a carbon cloth (CC) supported iron doped cobalt phosphide, layered-with a nickel phosphide film (Fe0.45Co0.55P/NiP@CC) was synthesized with a simple two step electrochemical deposition technique at room temperature. This free-standing Fe0.45Co0.55P/NiP@CC heterostructure presents superior OER performance in an alkaline media, with a strikingly low onset potential of 1.26 V and achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 247 mV vs. RHE in 1 M KOH, outperforming the state of the art RuO2 electrocatalyst. A Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1) and excellent long-term stability was achieved. Purposefully using NiP as a scaffold to in situ generate an active oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) OER catalyst on the surface of the electrode and interface coupling between the two layers provides numerous active sites and a synergistic effect to bring forth the profoundly enhanced performance of Fe0.45Co0.55P/NiP@CC electrode.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2398-4902			WOS:000526855200029

The ratio of boron and nitrogen for the uniform and agglomeration-free Pt loading is optimized. Among the prepared electrocatalysts, Pt-loaded CNFs with an equal amount of B and N (Pt/HCNF-III) exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction, methanol oxidation, and hydrogen evolution reactions. Pt/HCNF-III provides a significant ECSA (62.57 m(2)/gm). The Pt/HCNF-III being an efficient ORR electrocatalyst follows a 4-electron pathway and renders high half-wave potential. Moreover, Pt/HCNF-III displays relatively high mass activities of 324.77 and 6.17 A g(-1) during MOR and HER, respectively. Pt/HCNF-III also demands a minimal overpotential (54 mV) and Tafel slope (33 mV dec(-1)) during HER. Thus, a unique phenomenon of dopant-induced metal support interaction has enhanced the eletrocatalytic activity, stability, and selectivity of the prepared electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0921-5107	1873-4944		WOS:000858811600007

When compared to monometallic MOFs, it's demonstrated that bimetallic MOFs have higher activity and stability. However, the coupling effect of the two metallic ions in bimetallic MOFs is unclear. To clarify the mechanism, bimetallic CoZn-MOFs with OER-inert Zn species are coated on BiVO(4 )photoanodes. Results show that the oxidation state of Co is improved through the addition of Zn. Combining with borate-irradiation treatment, the CoZnMOF/B-BVO achieves a photocurrent density of 4.27 mA/cm(2), which is 3.16 times that of the BVO electrode. Furthermore, the onset potential is negatively shifted by 253 mV, the surface charge injection efficiency is 91% (vs 43.5%, BVO), and the bulk charge separation efficiency reaches 88.2% (vs 51.3%, BVO). The photocurrent of CoZnMOF/B-BVO retains 90% after 10 h test. Oxidation state modulation of MOFs with the second metal is an effective strategy to improve MOFs' activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000804594100004

In recent years, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have become an excellent electrocatalyst due to its characteristics. NiFeCr-MOFs were synthesized and prepared in one step by simple solvothermal method, which improved the OER performance compared with NiFe-MOFs. When the doping dosage of Cr3+ is 0.3 mmol, the performance of ternary MOFs is optimal, requiring only 333 mV over potential to provide a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), and the slope of Tafel is only 66 mV dec(-1). In this paper, the role of Cr3+ in the catalyst and the reason and mechanism for the improvement of OER performance were studied from the aspects of electrochemical surface area (ESCA), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electronic structure of the catalyst. Experiments have proved that the preparation of ternary MOFs by co-doping with an appropriate amount of Ni, Fe, and Cr has practical significance for improving the performance of OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000765935800001

Among many OER catalysts, transition metal layered double hydroxides (LDH) have attracted much attention due to their high activity and good stability. Here, an effective CoFe-LDH grown in-situ on Fe Foam (FF) has been prepared by corrosion technique with the assistance of NH4F. CFL-200 (CoFe-LDH synthesized with 200 mM NH4F) exhibits an excellent OER activity with an overpotential of 266 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 35 mV dec(-1). It also shows good stability over 100 hat 50 mA cm(-2). The outstanding performance of CFL-200 can be attributed to the formation of nanosheet structure and the appropriate Co/Fe molar ratio which can be adjusted indirectly by NH4F.

Herein, we reported a three-dimensional (3D) flower-like Co-N-codoped carbon material derived from ZIF-67, which was deposited on cobalt-nanoparticle-embellished flexible carbon cloth (CoNC/Co@CC), directly acting as a high-activity bifunctional electrode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and supercapacitors. The overpotential of CoNC/Co@CC is 360 mV with a modest Tafel slope of 76.9 mV dec(-1) and exhibits high stability for the OER in 1 M KOH electrolyte when the current density is 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, the specific capacitance of CoNC/Co@CC reaches 192.0 F g(-1) at 0.25 A g(-1). CoNC/Co@CC exhibits a capacitance retention of 90.6% at 2 A g(-1) after 3000 cycles.

The effects of SSC ionomer content in CL for oxygen evolution reaction were studied in half cell with cyclic voltammetry and steady state linear sweep. In a single cell test the MEA with SSC-PFSA Aquivionreg ionomer exhibited better thermal stability than the one with LSC-PFSA Nafionreg ionomer at 90 degC. The cell voltage at a current density of 1 A cm-2 was 1.63 V at 90 degC using the SSC-PFSA Aquivionreg ionomer binder, Nafionreg 117 membrane, and without back pressurizing. In a continuous operation the cell voltage degradation rate of the MEA using Aquivionreg ionomer binder was only about 0.82 mV h-1.

Herein, we developed a novel self-supported amorphous IrOx catalyst (IrOx/Ti) encapsulated with a small number of crystalline nanoparticles for efficient acidic OER. The resulting IrOx-50-AC/Ti electrode exhibits a superior OER performance with an overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 50.4 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 M HClO4. High contents of Ir-III species and surface hydroxide groups, hierarchically porous structure and high defective density contribute to boost the OER activity. Importantly, the amorphous IrOx-50-AC/Ti also demonstrates a super long-term durability for 190 h due to the strong interaction between IrOx film and Ti. The unique amorphous-crystalline structure also enhances the stability and the activity by promoting the synergy between amorphous phase and crystalline phase. This work provides some valuable insights on developing efficient Ir-based catalysts for acidic water splitting. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhao, Chenxing; E, Yifeng; Fan, Louzhen								Enhanced electrochemical evolution of oxygen by using nanoflowers made from a gold and iridium oxide composite								MICROCHIMICA ACTA				178	1-2			107	114		10.1007/s00604-012-0818-1				JUL 2012	2012	We report on the synthesis of a composite made from iridium oxide and gold that has a flower-like morphology. The ratio of iridium oxide to gold can be controlled by altering the concentrations of the metal precursors or the pH of the solution containing the reductant citrate. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and laser confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy were applied to characterize the structures of the nanoflowers, and a mechanism of their formation was deduced. The nanoflowers display an electrocatalytic activity in an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that is significantly enhanced compared to bare iridium oxide nanoparticles. The highest turnover frequency for the OER of the new nanoflowers is 10.9 s(-1), which is almost one order of magnitude better than that of the respective nanoparticles. These attractive features are attributed to the high oxidation states of iridium in the nanoflowers which is caused by the transfer of electronic charge from metal oxides to gold, and also to the flower fractal structure which is thought to provide a much more accessible surface than suspensions of the respective nanoparticle.									23	3	0	0	0	0	23			0026-3672	1436-5073		WOS:000305524800012

Metal-MOF-coupled heterostructures serve as good OER electrocatalysts due to their endowed MOF frameworks and numerous transition metal active sites at the interface. In this study, a simple ultrasonic impregnation strategy was used to prepare CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300 heterostructures via the impregnation of Co and Ni ions into UiO-66 followed by roasting in air at 300 degrees C to obtain heterostructures with UiO-66-retained frameworks as revealed by SEM. The electrochemical results show that the respective impregnation successfully modulated the electronic charge at the interface of the heterostructures, leading to rapid electron transfer that enhanced the OER activity. CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300 heterostructures showed good oxygen evolution reaction activities of 283 mV and 291.6 mV, respectively, due to the retained UiO-66 framework, while CoOx/UiO-66-550 and NiO/UiO-66-550 heterostructures calcined at 550 degrees C showed a decrease in OER activities of 332.6 mV and 346.6 mV, respectively, due to the collapsed UiO-66 framework. This work gives insight into the development of heterostructures of MOF-retained frameworks for energy applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000680393600001

Structure and Reactivity of IrOx Nanoparticles for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Electrocatalysis: An Electronic Structure Theory Study								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				125	8	SI		4379	4390		10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c10092		FEB 2021		MAR 4 2021	2021	In this work, we employ electronic structure methods to investigate the structure and reactivity of IrOx nanoparticle models as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Based on the explicit inclusion of the potential and pH in a constant potential framework, a computational approach is applied to investigate the thermodynamics of the proton and electron transfer process of IrOx cluster models. We address structural changes of the clusters under electrochemical conditions by constructing potential-pH diagrams from our computational results. Comparison of two IrOx cluster structures suggests that the charge transport to the clusters strongly depends on the pH. As a result, structures with a maximum number of on-top hydroxyl (OH mu 1) species are stable at low potentials and deprotonation becomes favorable with increasing potential. An assessment of the Ir oxidation states in our models shows that mixed oxidation states, i.e., Ir-IV and Ir-V, occur around the OER onset potential and increase to higher oxidation states (Ir-VI) in the high potential regime. Furthermore, an investigation of the water adsorption mechanism is carried out at different potentials.The results suggest that the potential controls the energetics of intermediates as well as transition states during the OER.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000626769100008

Nevertheless, traditional synthetic approaches for these promising catalysts usually involve tedious pretreatment procedures and a subsequent time-consuming exfoliation process, and the obtained products possess a wide dispersion of thickness and limited production yield. Here, a sequence of ultrathin NiFe-LDH nanosheets with tunable components were prepared on a large scale via a rapid room-temperature method under ambient conditions, and were further used as a desired material model for studying the influence of Ni/Fe ratio modulation on the OER performance. Due to the synergetic effect of more exposed active sites, efficient electron transport and optimized OER kinetics, the resulting LDH samples manifest outstanding electrocatalytic performance toward water oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000721374400001	35496396

Here, we report a highly durable and low-cost AEM-based electrolysis cell with active spinel ferrite catalysts for hydrogen production. Ce-substituted MnFe2O4 was synthesized by a combustion method and investigated as the electro catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Substitution of Ce in the cubic lattice of MnFe2O4 increases the conductivity of CexMnFe(2-x)O4, which results in a negative shift in the OER onset potential. At 25 degrees C, the single cell with Ce0.2MnFe1.8O4 exhibited a current density of 300 mA cm(-2) at 1.8 V.

However, the dependence of high potential in electro-chemical self-reconstruction, as well as the sluggish dynamics of water oxidation reaction are the main obstacles to real catalytic origins exploration and large-scale hydrogen fuel production. Herein, for the first time, sulfur and nickel dual-doped cobalt phosphide nanowire arrays (CoP3NiS NAs) are rationally designed as pre-catalysts, in which the S anions accelerate the surface reconstruction of the CoP3 while the Ni cations enhance the activity and selectivity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The converted products (CoP3NiS-R NAs) exhibit the over -potential of only 260 mV at 100 mA cm-2 for OER, much superior to the CoP3-R NAs and the benchmark IrO2. In addition, the two-electrode electrolyser (CoP3NiS@CoP3NiS-R) presents an ultra-low cell voltage of 1.47 V at 10 mA cm-2 and extraordinary durability over 120 h. This work elucidates the rational design of bifunctional materials in energy devices, and demonstrates that the electrochemical self-reconstruction engineering of cobalt -based phosphides is a promising strategy to design highly-efficient OER electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000869112200002

Operando infrared (IR) spectroscopy is one of the key methods to provide intuitive insights for hydrogen/oxygen-based intermediates to accelerate the screening process of catalysts. Unfortunately, the application of operando IR spectroscopy in the liquid-solid catalytic system is strongly impeded by the dramatic absorption of water and weak signals of photo/electrochemical reaction intermediates. In this review, we scrutinize the system-level strategies of operando IR measurement for (photo)electrolytic liquid-solid interfaces, including the light sources, optical pathway and reaction cell design. Particularly, operando synchrotron radiation IR measurement recently developed in our group is emphasized for its ability to study diluted catalytic site systems, such as metal-organic framework (MOF) and single-atom catalysts. A series of in-depth investigations of transient M-O-O, M-O-O-H and M-O bonds in OER and ORR processes is presented as the vital contributions of operando IR measurement to monitor the evolution of intermediate structures.									28	3	0	0	0	0	28			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000581738300034

During electrochemical measurements in neutral aqueous buffer, nearly all of the MnOx/C electrodes show significant oxidation currents at potentials relevant for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, by combining electrolysis with product detection by using mass spectrometry, it was found that these currents were only strictly linked to water oxidation if MnOx was deposited on graphitic carbon materials (faradaic O-2 yields > 90%). On the contrary, supports containing sp(3)-C were found to be unsuitable as the OER is accompanied by carbon corrosion to CO2. Thus, choosing the "right" carbon material is crucial for the preparation of stable and efficient MnOx/C anodes for water oxidation catalysis. For MnOx on graphitic substrates, current densities of > 1 mAcm(-2) at eta = 540 mV could be maintained for at least 16 h of continuous operation at pH 7 (very good values for electrodes containing only abundant elements such as C, O, and Mn) and post-operando measurements proved the integrity of both the catalyst coating and the underlying carbon at OER conditions.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000416158500025	28869720

Herein a unique hetero-nanostructured Ni/NiFe-layered double oxide (Ni/NiFe-LDO) on Ni foam (NF) has been successfully constructed through phase-transition and controlled in-situ reduction process. Because the two-dimensional (2D) morphology of NiFe-LDO nanosheets can stabilize uniform in-situ formed nano-Ni sites, the prepared Ni/NiFe-LDO on NF displays a high catalytic activity for HER in 1.0 M KOH solution, which requires an extremely low overpotential of 29 mV to afford a current density at 10 mA cm(-2), achieves a Tafel slope of 82 mV dec(-1) and maintains an excellent stability of electrolysis for at least 24 h. Detail characterizations reveal that the synergistic effect between nano-Ni and NiFe-LDO nanosheets contributes to the prominent HER activity. In NiFe-LDO, Fe2O3 facilitates the adsorption of H2O on the interface region of Ni-Fe2O3, which is beneficial for water activation, then NiO offers the active sites for hydroxyl adsorption (*OH), meanwhile nano-Ni sites are active to adsorb hydrogen intermediates (H*). All of the above accelerates the water dissociation in Volmer-step reaction.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729144900005

In order to reveal the specific role of each metal for OER in trimetallic electrocatalysts based on Fe, Co, and Ni and further improve their OER activity, a series of electrocatalysts containing unitary, binary and ternary metal boride oxides of Fe, Co, and Ni with different permutations and combinations immobilized on polypyrrole/reduced graphene oxide (PPy/rGO) nanosheets have been synthesized by one-step reduction. Regardless of which two metals are combined, the OER activities of the bimetallic electrocatalysts are generally higher than those of the monometallic electrocatalysts; also, the trimetallic FeCoNiBOx/PPy/rGO nanocomposites exhibit optimal OER activity due to the synergistic effects of each component, where Fe can significantly accelerate the OER kinetics by decreasing the Tafel slope and Co can effectively reduce the overpotential, while Ni can further simultaneously and significantly improve the electrocatalytic performance of both Fe and Co for OER. Additionally, PPy/rGO not only provides a large specific surface area for the immobilization of FeCoNiBOx, but also efficiently improves the OER activity of the obtained electrocatalysts due to its good conductivity. This work may provide some insights into the design and synthesis of multicomponent materials with compelling performance for electrochemical water splitting in further practical applications.									30	2	0	0	3	0	32			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000511170800023

In this study, we investigated the effect of a surface area and a d-band oxidation state on the activity and the stability of RuOx electrocatalysts for OER. We synthesized RuOx thin film on glassy carbon electrode by the radio frequency magnetic sputtering and controlled the deposition temperature to vary the surface morphology and the electronic structure. In particular, we obtained a precise d-band valence structure by using the synchrotron beam. A higher surface area and a more stable Ru4+ state were obtained at a lower deposition temperature owing to a smaller grain size and a lower oxidation state, respectively. As a result, the order of activity and stability is clearly consistent with that of surface area and stable Ru4+ state (RuOx > RuO(x)200 > RuO(x)400 > RuO(x)600). Hence, we suggest that the surface area and the Ru d-band oxidation state should be carefully controlled in the synthesis process in order to enhance the activity and the stability of RuOx electrocatalysts for OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0253-2964	1229-5949		WOS:000357430700025

Herein, we report an in situ grown zinc doped cobalt-iron layered double hydroxide (ZnFeCo LDH) with a unique needle-like nanostructure and partial amorphous phase for highly efficient OER catalysts. Benefitting from the nanoneedle arrays structure, partial amorphous phase, tunable zinc doping, and surface trivalent cobalt ions, partly amorphous Zn doped FeCo LDH 1D nanoneedle arrays (PA-ZnFeCo LDH) exhibited superior electrocatalytic OER activity, with a small Tafel slope of 58.73 mV per decade, an exceptional overpotential of 221, 276, and 294 mV to drive 10, 100, and 300 mA cm(-2), respectively, and long-term electrochemical stability of 100 000 s. This work offers insights into the rational design and synthesis of unique 1D non-noble metal hydroxide with partial amorphous phase as highly efficient OER electrocatalysis.									49	2	0	0	2	0	50			2168-0485			WOS:000480370500052

From the results, two electrochemical domains can be defined. At low overpotential (<1.55 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode), electrochemical performances are rather similar for all orientations. At higher overpotential (>1.55 V), the ranking is NiO(110) > NiO(111) > NiO(100). The observed differences were attributed to the fact that NiO(111) and NiO(100) produce an hydroxide phase with the same electrocatalytic properties, but the NiO(100) sample is covered less by the hydroxide and thus produces less active sites. Moreover, NiO(110) forms the more stable and catalytically most active hydroxide phase. We attribute the observed differences to the formation of the beta-NiOOH phase on the NiO(110) orientation, being more active than gamma-NiOOH, which is supposedly produced during the OER on the NiO(111) surface and, to a lesser extent, on the NiO(100) surface orientation.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			1932-7447			WOS:000446926400004

Herein, a superior OER catalyst of Fe substituted alpha-Co(OH)(2) (alpha-Co1-mFem(OH)(2)) has been synthesized by taking advantage of the large layered structure and good conductivity of alpha-Co(OH)(2), in conjunction with the rich redox properties and abundance of Fe. The atomically layered alpha-Co4Fe(OH)(x) (Co/Fe=4) nanoplates could effectively catalyze water oxidation at the onset potential of 0.26 V and its turnover frequency (TOF) was 11 and 5 times higher than those of aCo( OH)(2) and IrO2, respectively. The increased activity could be attributed to strong electronic interactions between Co and Fe. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations also demonstrated that the theoretical overpotential of alpha-Co1-mFem(OH)(2) is obviously lower than that of alpha-Co(OH)(2) and thus Fe doped alpha-Co(OH)(2) displays a better activity. Moreover, the correlation between the Fe content and activity could be plotted as a volcano curve.									171	10	0	0	7	0	173			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000394430800027

In this work, Co/MO2 (M = Ti, Zr, and Ce) catalysts were synthesized without using any harsh steps such as pyrolization, annealing, calcination, and carbonization. Cobalt nanoparticles with similar to 2.6 nm particle size were loaded on metal oxides by simple impregnation and reduction method. Considering the low onset and overpotential values, low Tafel slopes, high exchange current densities, high TOF values, as well as high Faradaic efficiency, Co/CeO2, Co/ZrO2, and Co/TiO2 nanocatalysts show the remarkable electrocatalytic performance in 1 M KOH for OER. Moreover, no noticeable change in the performance of Co/MO2 (M = Ti, Zr, and Ce) catalysts were observed after the stability test at 10 mA.cm(-2). This work will also shed light on other studies, in the preparation of inexpensive, earth abundant, and highly active OER electrocatalysts via changing impregnated metals or metal oxides supports.

Both experimental and density functional theory results support that the synergistic interaction of Fe and Co atom promotes FCC@CNOs having lower OER kinetic barrier and surface Co sites are activated for improved performance, not a conventional additive effect of bimetallic Co and Fe atoms.

Cobalt Selenide (CoSe2) is believed to be one of the promising candidates for OER based on Yang Shao-Horn's principle. However, owing to low exposure of active sites and/or low efficiency of electron transfer, the electrocatalytic activity of CoSe2 is far less than expected. In this work, a novel carbon nanotubes (CNT) grafted 3D core-shell structured CoSe2@C-CNT nanohybrid is developed by a general hydrothermal-calcination strategy. Zeolite imidazole frameworks (ZIF) was used as the precursor to synthesis of the materials. It is found that both the calcination temperature and the selenium content can significantly regulate the catalytic performance of the hybrids. The obtained best catalysts requires the overpotential of only 306 mV and 345 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and 50 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 MKOH medium, respectively. It also exhibits a small Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1) and excellent durability, which is superior to most of recently reported CoSe2-based and Co-based materials. These superior performances can be ascribed to synergistic effects of the highly active CoSe2 nanostructure, defect carbon species and the carbon nanotubes exist in the catalyst. Besides, the unique morphology leads to large electrochemical surface area of the catalyst, which is in favor of the exposure of active sites for OER. Due to high efficiency, low cost and excellent durability for OER, the prepared catalysts showed can be potentially used to substitute noble metals utilized in related energy storage and conversion devices.

Initially motivated as a strategy to protect the underlying semiconductor photoabsorber from harsh operating conditions, the thickness of the insulator layer in MIS systems has recently been shown to be a critical design parameter which can be tuned to optimize the photovoltage. This study analyzes the underlying mechanism by which the thickness of the insulator layer impacts the performance of MIS photo-electrocatalysts. A concrete example of an Ir/HfO2/n-Si MIS system is investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction. The results of combined experiments and modeling suggest that the insulator thickness affects the photovoltage i) favorably by controlling the flux of charge carriers from the semiconductor to the metal electrocatalyst and ii) adversely by introducing nonidealities such as surface defect states which limit the generated photovoltage. It is important to quantify these different mechanisms and suggest avenues for addressing these nonidealities to enable the rational design of MIS systems that can approach the fundamental photovoltage limits. The analysis described in this contribution as well as the strategy toward optimizing the photovoltage are generalizable to other MIS systems.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000512010700001

Herein, a facile strategy to construct abundant oxygen vacancies with heterogeneous structures of oxygen-vacancies CoFe2O4/oxygen-vacancies cobalt oxides/nickel foam (Ov-CoFe2O4/CoOx/NF) is developed using gas-phase cation exchange. Benefiting from abundant oxygen vacancies, the strong interfacial coupling effects between oxygen-vacancies CoFe2O4 (Ov-CoFe2O4) and oxygen-vacancies cobalt oxides (Ov-CoOx), a nanorod structure and the highly conductive nickel foam support, Ov-CoFe2O4/CoOx/NF exhibits a low overpotential of 59 mV and achieved a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a 1 M KOH solution. Ov-CoFe2O4/CoOx/NF//Ov-CoFe2O4/CoOx/NF exhibits a low water splitting voltage of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory calculations suggest that oxygen vacancy and interfacial coupling effects can both improve conductivity of electrocatalysts. This study provides a facile design for simultaneous realization of oxygen vacancy modification and heterostructure, which may become a simple strategy to use oxides to improve HER performance.

Herein, taking the Si-based photoanodes (n(+)p-Si/SiOx/Fe/FeOx/MOOH, M = Fe, Co, Ni) as a model system, we investigate the effect of the transition-metal electrocatalysts on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among the photoanodes with the three different electrocatalysts, the best OER activity, with a low-onset potential of similar to 1.01 V-RHE, a high photocurrent density of 24.10 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE,V- and a remarkable saturation photocurrent density of 38.82 mA cm(-2), was obtained with the NiOOH overlayer under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight (100 mW cm(-2)) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The optimal interfacial engineering for electrocatalysts plays a key role for achieving high performance because it promotes interfacial charge transport, provides a larger number of surface active sites, and results in higher OER activity, compared to other electrocatalysts. This study provides insights into how electrocatalysts function in water-splitting devices to guide future studies of solar energy conversion.

Although it is considered that the co-existence of Ni and Fe is essential for the high catalytic activity, the identification of active sites and the mechanism of OER in NiFe alloy catalysts have been controversial for a long time. This review focuses on the catalytic centers of NiFe alloys and the related mechanism in the alkaline water oxidation process from the perspective of crystal structure/composition modulation and structural design. Briefly, amorphous structures, metastable phases, heteroatom doping and in situ formation of oxyhydroxides are encouraged to optimize the chemical configurations of active sites toward intrinsically boosted OER kinetics. Furthermore, the construction of dual-metal single atoms, specific nanostructures, carbon material supports and composite structures are introduced to increase the abundance of active sites and promote mass transportation. Finally, a perspective on the future development of NiFe alloy electrocatalysts is offered. The overall aim of this review is to shed light on the exploration of novel electrocatalysts in the field of energy.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000632580200002	34163652

Here, we discover a reactive intermediate population with states in the middle of a semiconductor's bandgap that reveal the dynamics of two parallel transition state pathways for their decay. After phototriggering the water oxidation reaction from the n-SrTiO3 surface, the microsecond decay of the intermediates affirms transition state theory through two distinct time constants, the primary kinetic salt and H/D kinetic isotope effects, realistic activation barrier heights and transition state theory pre-factors. Furthermore, we show that the reaction conditions can be adjusted to allow selection between the two pathways, one characterized by a labile intermediate facing the electrolyte (the oxyl), and the other by a lattice oxygen (the bridge). In summary, we experimentally isolate an important activation barrier in multi-electron transfer water oxidation and, in doing so, identify competing mechanisms for O-2 evolution at surfaces.									27	0	0	0	3	0	27			2520-1158			WOS:000486144700014

Herein, we rationally designed a metallic nanostructured nickel sulfide/phosphide hybrid (NiSxPy) as an efficient precatalyst for OER, with one-dimensional (1D) nanowires grown on 1D nanorods. The resulting metallic hybrid NiSxPy catalyst can accelerate the electron transfer process and expose abundant in situ-generated NiOOH species during OER (NiSxPy-O). Therefore, NiSxPy-O exhibits a low overpotential of 192 mV (with 100% iR compensation; this value should be 200 mV without compensation) to achieve an O-2 partial current density (j(O2)) of 10 mA cm(-2) and a robust stability over 135 h without obvious degradation. Moreover, a j(O2) of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 315 mV (with 100% iR compensation; this value should be 365 mV without compensation) is attained in near-neutral conditions.

Herein, we constructed a RuO2/LFRO composite by the exsolution of a low Ru-substituted A-site deficient perovskite, La0.9Fe0.92Ru0.08-xO3 (LFRO). In this process, pure Ru NPs are in situ exsolved from LFRO via a relatively low temperature heat treatment in 5% H-2/Ar. Then the exsolved Ru NPs were oxidized to RuO2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) applications. The RuO2/LFRO composite achieved a high OER performance compared with the pristine LFRO, which is mainly originated from the generation of electrochemically active RuO2 NPs and the improvement of conductivity. In addition, the exsolution is a reversible process that the exsolved Ru NPs can disappear into the perovskite lattice at 550 degrees C in air. Our work thereof demonstrates an effective strategy to minimize the dosage of precious metals for catalytic applications in different fields.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			2168-0485			WOS:000443924100098

In a real battery system, many kinds of additives and impurities exist in the electrolyte, and therefore, molecular adsorptions on the Li2O2 surface are unavoidable; nevertheless, their influences on the OER of Li2O2 are rarely understood. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed to simulate the OER of Li2O2 surface adsorbed with a single H2O molecule. Simulation results indicate that the H2O molecule can spontaneously adsorb on the Li2O2 surface during the whole OER process. Consequently, the energy barriers of OER on Li2O2 surface are decreased and thus the intrinsic overpotential of the Li-O-2 battery is reduced. Our findings suggest that the OER process in a Li-O-2 battery can be modified by controlling the electrolyte additives, providing a new strategy for the development of improved Li-O-2 batteries.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447			WOS:000376417500015

This approach is thought to be able to eventually solve the main energy problem that society will face more dramatically in the near future. The water oxidation reaction is widely considered a major barrier for utilizing solar energy in artificial photosynthesis. Due to the relatively high overpotential and slow kinetics of the reaction, numerous efforts are made on the development of non-noble metal oxygen evolution catalysts such as transition metal oxides. Among them, cobalt-oxide-based materials have shown decent activity and thus present themselves as a promising candidate. In this perspective, we summarize the state of the art in synthesis of cobalt-oxide-based materials and application as water oxidation catalysts through electrochemical, photochemical, and photoelectrochemical approaches. Additionally, we state the future challenges that are critical to overcome to push the catalyst performance one step further.									390	7	2	0	19	0	393			2155-5435			WOS:000345735200044

In particular, cobalt phosphide electrocatalysts play an important part in the oxygen evolution reaction. Here, two kinds of CoP with different nanostructures, CoP-MA and CoP-GC (MA = methylamine and GC = guanidine carbonate), were successfully prepared by a two-step method, including calcination of the corresponding Co-based metal formate frameworks, [Amine][Co(HCOO)(3)] (Amine = CH3NH3 and C(NH2)(3)), in air and the subsequent low temperature phosphating process. As OER catalysts, the CoP nanostructures show strong electrochemical structure-dependent properties. Electrochemical tests show that nanoparticle based CoP-MA micro-cubes required an overpotential of 340 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), while nanosheet based CoP-GC micro-cubes only required an overpotential of 310 mV at the same current density. Importantly, the two CoP micro-cubes have a similar morphology but different structures, providing a direct side-by-side evaluation of their OER activities. The comparisons of the same metal phosphide OER catalysts with the same morphology but different structures are of great significance in identifying the key material characteristics that lead to high activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1466-8033		WOS:000848128900001

The good dispersion and morphology of hollow spheres are important to provide high active sites. It is a big challenge to control the morphology and distribution of the active materials during synthesis. Serious deformation and uneven distribution of the spheres were usually obtained due to inappropriate templates. A facile one-step hydrothermal method using micelles of triblock copolymer surfactant P123 was adopted to in-situ grow Ni3S2/MoS2 porous hollow spheres on Ni foam with uniform distribution. The as-produced Ni3S2/MoS2 porous hollow spheres have been demonstrated to have excellent oxygen evolution reaction catalytic performance as integrated electrodes. Low overpotentials of 314 mV and 337 mV have been achieved at current densities of 50 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1) and an excellent long-term stability, which is better than other Ni-base material.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000823702200001

Due to their excellent OER performance, transition metal layered doubled hydroxides (LDHs) attract increasing interest. Herein, a systematic study of superfast single-step synthesis for a series of carbon-free, binder-free self-supported bimetallic hydroxides on Ni foam (NF) and their associated performance towards OER in alkaline electrolytes is presented. Transition metal hydroxides are directly deposited on NF by a superfast electrodeposition technique. The resultant bimetallic hydroxides are uniformly distributed over NF in short-range order crystalline or amorphous structures. All six electrodes demonstrate significantly greater OER activities than ruthenium oxide (RuO2). The interaction between transition metal LDHs and NF determines OER performance. Applying optimum conditions, the highest activities are accomplished. Overall, results show excellent OER performance. The fast electrodeposition technique provides a systematic and cost-effective way to achieve durable self-supported transition metal LDH structures showing excellent OER performance.

Herein, Ni-metalloid (B, Si, P, As, Te) alloys are reported as an emergent class of highly promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and insight is offered into the origin of activity enhancement on the premise of the surface electronic structure, the OER activation energy, influence of the guest metalloid elements on the lattice structure of the host metal (Ni), and surface-oxidized metalloid oxoanions. The metalloids modify the lattice structure of Ni, causing changes in the nearest Ni-Ni interatomic distance (d(Ni-Ni)). The activation energy E-a scales with d(Ni-Ni) indicating an apparent dependence of the OER activity on lattice properties. During the OER, surface Ni atoms are oxidized to nickel oxyhydroxide, which is the active state of the catalyst, meanwhile, the surface metalloids are oxidized to the corresponding oxoanions that affect the interfacial electrode/electrolyte properties and hence the adsorption/desorption interaction energies of the reacting species.									60	4	0	0	3	0	60			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000477779200011

Here, we showed that on RuO2(110) in alkaline solutions, OER activity is cation-dependent, being largest in 0.1 M KOH compared to LiOH and NaOH. Using crystal truncation rod analysis, -O is detected on the coordinatively unsaturated site at 1.5 V-RHE in 0.1 M KOH, suggesting that the rate-determining step is -O + OH- -> -OOH + e(-), which is different from that in acid involving the final deprotonation of -OOH. The ordering of interfacial water in base was found to decrease with increasing potential and independent of cations. Using surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy, the density of isolated water molecules (zero H-bonds) was found to increase, and the density of icelike water molecules (four H-bonds) decreases from Li+ to K+ at OER potentials. The higher activity of more isolated interfacial OH - ions in the case of K+ and the lesser stabilization of -O intermediates by hydration water of K+ compared to Na+ and Li+ can result in higher OER activity for KOH. This work provides molecular details of the interface as a function of potential and electrolyte and enables the design of more active electrochemical interfaces.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000644438400018

In addition to the identification of primary peroxygenases, different classes of enzymes were shown to display promiscuous peroxygenase activity. Even though enzymes with peroxygenase activity are promising industrial biocatalysts, further optimization of their properties is required for their effective use in industrial applications. Here we give a comprehensive overview of enzymes with peroxygenase activity and review diverse strategies, including directed evolution, rational approaches and the assistance of small functional molecules to improve the expression, catalytic activity, substrate scope or selectivity of these promising enzymes. Furthermore, we discuss the exploration of modified or unnatural cofactors to design artificial peroxygenases for desired reactions. The rapidly expanding field of hydrogen peroxide-utilizing enzymes bears a great potential to provide biocatalysts for selective oxyfunctionalization chemistry, contributing to the development of environmentally friendly and sustainable oxidation processes.Peroxygenases are promising enzymes to contribute to more environmentally friendly and sustainable oxidation reactions in industry.

In this study, we prepared a composite material with nanofusiform-like structures as an efficient earth-abundant oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst, its morphology was confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and the calculated average particle size of the Co/Mn@CNDs-MOF was 10.5 nm. Electrochemical methods were performed to examine the catalytic OER of the Co/Mn@CNDs-MOF electrode. The MOF composite revealed high current densities of 50 and 100 mA/cm2 at 280 and 320 mV overpotentials, respectively, with a low Tafel slope of 140 mV dec-1 in a 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte toward OER. Here, the incorporation of CNDs into a bimetallic MOF increases the surface area, active sites, and moreover the electrocatalytic activity of the composite, revealing almost equal properties when compared to a commercial catalyst, ruthenium oxide (RuO2). This research provides an outstanding avenue to realize multifunctional electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000813390400001

Herein, Ni3Fe1-xVx/Ni3Fe1-xVxN heterojunctions were elaborately constructed to demonstrate that the coupling of variable-valence metal doping and nanoalloy/nitride heterointerfaces could optimize the OER performance of antiperovskite nitrides. The spectroscopic results suggested that during OER electrochemical surface reconstruction occurred to form an assembly of a crystalline Ni3Fe1-xVx/Ni3Fe1-xVxN heterojunction core and amorphous NiFeOOH shell (Ni3Fe1-xVx/Ni3Fe1-xVxN@NiFeOOH). The electron transfer from the OER intermediates via the amorphous NiFeOOH shell was efficiently accelerated by the variable-valence V3+/4+ electron acceptor at the core@shell interface and the heterojunction effect in the Ni3Fe1-xVx/Ni3Fe1-xVxN core. As a result, the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions can occur at low overpotentials of 260 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and 113 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, affording a low cell voltage of 1.66 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for water splitting in alkaline electrolyte (1.0 M KOH). Our results provide a new attempt at improving water splitting kinetics via the variable-valence ion coupling heterojunction effect.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000757518500001

The XPS analysis revealed that fluorine atoms were covalently attached to CNTs and about 5.1 at.% fluorine was successfully doped into CNTs. The transmission electron microscope images showed that the outer surface of thinner CNTs becomes rough after fluorine incorporation with a similar tube diameter as that of undoped CNTs. The electrochemical testing for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media shows that the F-doped CNTs are better OER electrocatalysts than their undoped counterpart and noble metal iridium supported carbon electrocatalyst i.e. Ir/C (20 wt% Ir) under identical conditions. The F-doped CNTs exhibited 25 mV and 60 mV lower OER overpotentials than noble metal iridium supported electrocatalyst and undoped CNTs respectively. The better OER performance of F-doped CNTs is attributed to the surface modification of inert sp(2) hybridized carbon layers by more electronegative fluorine atoms which create semi ionic C-F and covalent C-F active sites for efficient OER activity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000679291500001

Both the activity and stability of Ir-based catalysts are critically dependent on the ratio of stable rutile IrO2 and unstable amorphous Ir oxide (a-IrOx), as well as the spatial relationship between them. Here, we report that the domain size in hollow ternary Ir alloy nanocages can be fine-tuned by the introduction of dopant elements during the growth of parent core-shell nanoparticles, Cu@Culr After electrochemical oxidation under OER conditions, Ir alloy nanocages possessing multiple crystallites in their structure are transformed into hollow aggregates of loosely knit crystalline IrO2@a-IrOx domains, whereas single-crystalline Ir alloy nanocages are transformed to hollow Ir oxides with a random mixture of a-IrOx and IrO2. The loosely knit IrO2@a-IrOx structure achieves high OER activity and long-term stability, which is not feasible with the random mixture of a-IrOx and IrO2.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10				2666-3864		WOS:000658758300004

Herein, we report a series of ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) carbon-free Fe3O4-decorated ss-Co(OH)2 nanosheets (Fe3O4/Co(OH)2 NSs) as OER electrocatalysts with different Co/Fe mole ratios from 1 to 31. It is found that the different amounts of iron incorporation into Co(OH)2 NSs affects the structure of Fe3O4/Co(OH)2 NSs, while the optimized incorporation boosts the electrocatalytic activity of Co(OH)2 NSs for OER, i.e. the Fe3O4/Co(OH)2 NSs with a Co/Fe molar ratio of 15 demonstrate superior catalytic properties with respect to the lowest overpotential and smallest Tafel slope in alkaline media. First principles calculations used for exploring mechanisms show that Fe3+ from Fe3O4/Co(OH)2 NSs adsorbs water molecules more energetically favorably on the surface and would offer far more improvement of the catalytic activity compared with Fe2+. Combined with structure analysis and calculation results, the better catalytic activity is attributed to the ultrathin structure, high active site exposure, lower adsorption energy towards water molecules and the increased positive charge of adsorbed water molecules. This research paves a way to develop highly active and durable substitutes for noble metal OER electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488			INSPEC:17582985

This energy is used to extract electrons from water, during which process oxygen is evolved. Owing to its extreme fragility and the large number of polypeptides (>20) it is composed of the complex has so far proven recalcitrant to high-resolution structural studies. Cryo-electron crystallography of 2-D crystals (a=15.4 nm, b=23.1 nm, gamma=97.2 degrees, p1) comprising in situ PSII revealed the first projection structure of the native complex. The unit cell contains one monomeric complex in which three central domains straddle an elongated intramolecular cavity. In conjunction with earlier data, these central domains were assigned to the reaction centre core subunits of PSII consisting of CP43, CP47, the reaction centre heterodimer D1/D2 and cytochrome b-559. The data are discussed in view of the evolution of reaction centres from anoxygenic to oxygenic photosynthesis. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Here, we constructed the ZnSe/graphene vdW heterojunction and investigated its structural, electronic, optical, transportable, and catalytic properties by using density functional theory (DFT). The results show that ZnSe is a direct semiconductor with a bandgap of 3.24 eV. The electron mobility of ZnSe is seven times higher than that of the hole, which is beneficial for the photogenerated hole-electron separation. Besides, the n-type Schottky to Ohmic contact transformation can be realized by applying an external electric field of 0.2 V/angstrom, and the underlying mechanism is discussed. Finally, the potential ability of photo/electrocatalysis for graphene/ZnSe heterostructure and electrocatalysis for ZnSe monolayer is also explored. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can spontaneously activate in acid (PH = 1,2) and alkaline (PH > 9) media under light irradiation. The overpotential of oxygen reduction reaction reaches 0.42 eV, which indicates graphene/ZnSe heterostructure would be a potential electrocatalyst. For the HER process of ZnSe monolayer, the overpotential is significantly decreased to 0.23 eV by doping 3d transition metal atom. Consequently, we hope our work can provide useful guidance for designing practical ZnSe-based applications.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000723845900002

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is energy consuming, and O-2 is of low value and has security issues while directly contacting with organic molecules. Herein, by replacing OER with 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR), we report paired electrolysis of AN and HMF for simultaneous generation of ADN and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). On the anode side, the electrodeposited amorphous NiMoP film-covered nickel foam efficiently boosted HMFOR activity by enlarging the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) via in situ selective removal of Mo and P on the surface. On the cathode side, addition of dimethylformamide (DMF) as a cosolvent enhanced the reaction efficiency of ANEHD by forming a single-phase electrolyte that offers better interaction between AN and the electrode. The ANEHD-HMFOR paired system shows excellent generation rates of FDCA (0.018 g(FDCA)center dot h(-1)center dot cm(-2)) and ADN (0.017 g(ADN)center dot h(-1)center dot cm(-2)) at a high cell current (160 mA).

In this work, the intensified contribution of a kinetic pathway at large current to the water oxidation process on manganese catalyst was revealed. This pathway was proposed and verified by the observation of the periodic electrochemical self-oscillation, which can be modulated by external electrical pulse with different amplitude and frequency. At an external pulse with an average current of 0.08 A/cm(2) and a frequency of 130 Hz, the intrinsic self-oscillation can result in similar to 14.6% reduction of power consumption. The kinetic role of peroxide and Mn(III) intermediates in this pathway was also analyzed, in order to provide both a mechanism insight and possible energy-saving strategies for industrial process.

However, for transition metal based serpentine materials, the influence of transition metal elements, Ge, and Si on energy bands and subsequently the electrocatalytic OER behavior is not concern yet. Herein, serpentine CoxNi3-xGe2O5(OH)(4) nanosheets with tuned energy bands are designed for catalyzing OER. DFT calculations reveal that CoxNi3-xGe2O5(OH)(4) produce intensified density of states around Fermi level in energy bands, bringing feasible absorption of OER intermediates. In experiment, optimized CoxNi3-xGe2O5(OH)(4) shows low OER overpotential and favorable stability in KOH solution and phosphatic buffer saline, which is superior to commercial RuO2 and most Co and Ni based compounds. Electrochemical impedance spectra reveal that CoxNi3-xGe2O5(OH)(4) possesses minimized adsorptive resistance of surface intermediates, which consistent with results of DFT calculations. The serpentine catalysts with tuned energy bands are promising as efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting in wide-pH environments.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000496894300039

In the present work, we developed a method for immobilizing 1.5 nm Ir nanoparticles on a conductive indium tin oxide support. In addition to having a low Ir content of 4.1 wt %, the obtained Ir-NP-ITO material is very active and stable in water oxidation, reaching a current of 10 A(glr)(-1) at 1.470 V vs RHE. Our electrode design allows for convenient analysis of the catalyst after the electrochemical tests. Employing high resolution electron microscopy, we show that under the OER conditions, the core of iridium particles stays metallic, while amorphous layer forms on the particle surface, which we attribute to Ir-oxo-hydroxide based on our X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies. The surface Ir-oxo-hydroxide layer is responsible for the high OER efficiency of the supported catalyst.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2574-0962			WOS:000458706900026

A variety of non-destructive techniques including synchrotron NEXAFS, XPS and ATR-FTIR for both non-grounded and grounded spent catalyst and its combustion residues were employed to reveal the speciation, spatial distribution of coke within the catalyst matrix, as well as its evolution upon rapid heart-up and combustion. As have been confirmed, the coke species is highly broad in speciation, covering aliphatic and aromatic compounds as well as graphite that are both physically deposited and chemically adsorbed on acid sites on the catalyst's exterior surface. The majority of aliphatic hydrocarbons were also embedded deeply within the catalyst matrix, which were presumably caused by the penetration of precursor molecules that are small in size. Irrespective of the combustion mode, upon the initial rapid heat-up, the embedded light hydrocarbons were rapidly volatilised, and diffused outward toward the exterior surface, where it either underwent C-O-2/C-CO2 reactions, or simply further recondensed into graphite in the case that oxygen is lean in the air-firing mode. In contrast, in the oxy-firing mode, the coke was confirmed highly reactive for reverse Boudouard reaction and methane drying reaction which were even triggered during the initial particle heat-up stage. Consequently, the initial graphitisation extent of light vapor was mitigated, and the micro-pores of catalysts were opened up to enable a continuous elution of the hydrocarbon vapors to boost the overall coke burn-off. Regarding the competition of the overall C-O-2 and C-CO2 reactions on catalyst exterior surface, the former reaction is superior in the case where oxygen is lean (e.g. 3%). In contrast, when the oxygen content is higher (e.g. 10%), the latter one was intensified due to the strong heat feedback from the exothermic C-O-2 reactions. As a result, the overall coke including other two species, graphite and aliphatic hydrocarbons were consumed quickly in the O-2/CO2 case.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000722323200007

However, BiVO4 photoanode has some disadvantages, such as severe electron-hole recombination, poor kinetics of the surface reaction, and poor stability. Among known reports, this work is the first to doped Nd into the interior of BiVO4 photo -anode to improve its photoelectrochemical water splitting performance. Furthermore, we chose NiFe2O4 as the oxygen evolution reaction co-catalyst to further modify the Nd-doped BiVO4 photoanode. The photo -current density of the as-prepared NiFe2O4-Nd-BiVO4 photoanode reaches 1.93 mA cm(-2), three times that of the bare BiVO(4 )photoanode, and the onset potential also exhibits a significant negative shift. More importantly, the stability of the NiFe2O4-Nd-BiVO4 photoanode is also significantly improved. Detailed characterization and analysis show that Nd doping induces lattice distortion, increases the charge carrier density of BiVO4, reduces impedance, and effectively suppresses electron-hole recombination. For NiFe2O4, as an oxygen evolution reaction co-catalyst, dramatically accelerates the electron-hole transfer rate kinetically and significantly improves the stability of BiVO4.

The CoS2@NS-C cubes were synthesized by coprecipitation between a cobalt salt and 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and subsequent thermal sulfidation. TCNQ acted as the coordination polymer for a cube shape and as the nitrogen source for nitrogen-dopants. The CoS2@NS-C cubes comprise uniformly distributed CoS2 nanoparticles in a nitrogen/sulfur dual-doped carbon matrix, providing fast catalytic activity for oxygen reduction/ evolution reactions. The CoS2@NS-C cubes exhibited a high-rate performance of 5000 mA g(-1) as well as longterm performance of > 100 cycles with a current density of 2000 mA g(-1).

J	Salvador, Pedro								Mechanisms of water photooxidation at n-TiO2 rutile single crystal oriented electrodes under UV illumination in competition with photocorrosion								PROGRESS IN SURFACE SCIENCE				86	1-2			41	58		10.1016/j.progsurf.2010.10.002				JAN-FEB 2011	2011	Photoetching is known to compete with water photooxidation at nTiO(2) rutile electrodes in contact with aqueous H2SO4 solutions under UV illumination and anodic bias. A mechanism based on the generation of bridging hydroxyl species from the adsorption of water molecules at photoinduced bridging oxygen vacancies is proposed in order to explain the competition between both photo-reactions. This mechanism, designated as Redox Photooxidation (RP) Mechanism, correlates the atomic arrangement of the TiO2 surface with its photocatalytic activity, considering that the first step for water photooxidation is the photogeneration of bridging oxygen/hydroxyl radicals associated with intrinsic bandgap surface states, via inelastic transfer of free valence band holes to bridging oxygen/hydroxyl groups, depending on the electrolyte pH. The critical distance between adjacent bridging oxygen/hydroxyl radicals allows their covalent bonding with generation of surface-bound peroxide species, which are further photooxidized leading to oxygen evolution. The RP mechanism allows to explain literature experimental results concerning surface modifications of n-TiO2 rutile during photoetching in competition with water photooxidation, as well as their dependence on crystal orientation. The photogeneration of chemisorbed peroxo species, intermediates of the oxygen evolution reaction, detected by MIRIR spectroscopy, as well as experimental results obtained from PL and DEMS experiments are also interpreted in the light of the RP mechanism. A comparative analysis with the nucleophilic attack (NA) Mechanism, an alternative model proposed recently to explain photoelectrochemical water oxidation at n-TiO2 rutile, is presented.

Herein, we highlight a plasma-treated Bi-0.1(Ba0.5Sr0.5)(0.9)Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta perovskite (denoted as P-Bi0.1BSCF) as a promising catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. H-2/Ar plasma engraving could significantly increase electrochemically active O-2(2-)/O- concentration and tune the electronic structure of Co ions efficiently, and consequently tailor the intrinsic electrocatalytic ability for OER. Of note, P-Bi0.1BSCF, with unique crystalline core/amorphous shell structure, exhibits an enhanced intrinsic OER activity and higher stability than the noble metal IrO2 catalyst, which outperforms most of the reported perovskite catalysts. The present work provides new insights into exploring efficient catalysts for OER, and it suggests that, in addition to the extensively applied for surface treatment of various catalysts such as carbons and metal oxides, the plasma engraved perovskite materials also exhibits great potential as precious metal-free catalysts.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2045-2322			WOS:000460922200046	30862881

The activity of PTFE bonded bifunctional oxygen electrodes made by the perovskite-type catalyst dispersed on active carbon was investigated using steady polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method. The impedance spectra of both cathodic and anodic polarization were analyzed. The electrochemical parameters of the oxygen reduction reaction were obtained by fitting the experimental impedance data to an equivalent circuit containing two Nernstian diffusion terms. The results show that the oxygen reduction activity was improved by doping Fe3+ ions on site B of LaNiO3 oxides. But doping Sr2+ ions on site A could impair the effect because the ordering level of oxygen vacancy and electrode resistance were increased. The decomposition reaction rate of H2O2 catalyzed by perovskite catalysts was examined. The data showed that the catalytic activity of Ni ion was higher than that of Fe ion and when doped with Sr ion the catalytic activity of decomposition reaction rate of H2O2 was increased. The results of CV multi-cycle examination showed that LaNi0.8Fe0.2O3 had a good electrochemical stability.									10	10	0	0	1	0	14			0567-7351			WOS:000227653400004

In the present work, the electronic structure and related properties of two-dimensional (2D) van de Waals (vdW) GeS/WX2 (X = O, S, Se, Te) heterojunction are systematically investigated by first-principles calculations. Our results demonstrate that, the GeS/WS2 heterojunction could form a direct Z-scheme system for photocatalytic water splitting, whereas the GeS/WX2 (X = O, Se, Te) can't, because of their respective unsuitable electronic structures. For the GeS/WS2 heterojunction, the GeS and WS2 monolayers serve as photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reactionand oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. The internal electric field induced by the electron transfer at the interface can promote the separation of photo-generated charge carriers and formation of the interface Z-scheme electron transfer. Remarkably, the designed GeS/WS2 heterojunction not only enhances the hydrogen production activity of GeS and the oxygen production ability of WS2 but also improves the light absorption of the two monolayers by reducing the band gaps. Moreover, it is found that narrowing the interlayer distance could enhance the internal electric field, improving the photocatalytic ability of the vdW heterojunction. This work provides fundamental insights for further design and preparation of emergent metal dichalcogenide catalysts, beneficial for the development in clean energy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we describe the in situ design of embedded NiFe nanoparticles into the N-doped bamboo-like carbon nanotube (NBCNT) with high catalytic performance and stability. The obtained NiFe@NBCNT hybrid exhibits a high electrochemical activity and stability with an unexpectedly low overpotential of similar to 195 mV for OER at 10 mA cm(-2) and an onset potential at 1.03 V for ORR, superior to the state-of-the-art Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. Additionally, compared to the mixture of Pt/C and RuO2 cathodes, the ZAB based on the NiFe@NBCNT cathode displays a lower overpotential (0.80 V), higher stable round-trip efficiency (58.3%), and improved power density for 200 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2). Apparently, the obtained results indicate that the NiFe@NBCNT hybrid is proven to be one of the best nonnoble metal catalysts for achieving commercial implementation of rechargeable ZABs.									74	3	0	0	1	0	75			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000441477800038	29943982

The primary advantage of AEM electrolyzers is replacing the noble metal catalysts with low-cost platinum group metal (PGM)-free catalysts. Despite some astonishing demonstrations of high-performance AEM electrolyzers [1-4], most of them suffer from lower energy efficiency due to the poor catalytic activity of PGM-free catalysts. Herein, to improve the performance of AEM electrolyzers, we developed a CeO2/CoFeCe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) heterostructure as the OER catalyst. The Ce doping modulates the electronic structures of CoFe-LDH while creating a CeO2/CoFeCe LDH interface, which dramatically improves the OER activity. The Ce doping synergizes with the CeO2/CoFeCe LDH interface to enable a high-performance AEM electrolyzer, achieving an exceptional current density of 2.7 A/cm(2) at 1.8 V-cell. This work validates that AEM electrolyzers equipped with PGM-free OER catalysts can achieve comparable energy efficiency with proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEM electrolyzers).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000862849100004

However, few studies concerning E-a measurements are reported to support theoretical predictions. Herein, we prepared nickel foam (NF) supported beta-NiFeOOH, beta-NiOOH, gamma-NiFeOOH, and gamma-NiOOH and compared their OER performances. beta-NiFeOOH exhibits an exceptionally high activity, with an overpotential (eta) of 196, 245 and 257 mV to yield a current density of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. We measured E-a of the OER on different catalysts and established the E(a)vs. eta relationship. The activation energy at zero-overpotential and the overpotential at zero-activation-energy on beta-NiFeOOH/NF are the lowest (89 kJ mol(-1) and 350 mV), revealing the key origin of its high activity. This work provides the first experimental evidence for the high OER activity of Fe-doped NiOOH catalysts from the aspect of electrochemical activation energy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000855751300001

To our knowledge, this is the first time that the NiO and CuO heterostructure, which was obtained by a very simple preparation method, has been used in OER. The excellent catalytic performance can be attributed to electron interactions between NiO and CuO, thus modifying the adsorption energy of nickel oxide to intermediate species. Moreover, we found that the heterostructured nanosheet was composed of many very small NiO and CuO nanocrystals with abundant defects and more exposed active sites, thus improving the catalytic activity and accelerating the kinetic processes of OER.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000683810700018

In addition, analyses of the anodic weight loss, metal ion concentration, phase analysis, and scanning electron microscopy images of the oxide layer and substrate were also conducted. The results show that the diaphragm electrolysis cell completely prevented the metal ions in the anode chamber from penetrating into the cathode chamber. The Co2+ in the solution was gradually oxidized to Co3+ during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which facilitated the reduction of the potential of the OER, decreased the time for the potential of the Pb-Ag (0.6 wt%) anode and Pb anode to stabilize, and improved the corrosion resistance of the Pb-Ag (0.6 wt%) anode and Pb anode by weakening the oxidation of the anodic metal substrate during the OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0304-386X	1879-1158		WOS:000549135400043

After removal of the space holders, highly porous layers of polycrystalline Ni and of a nanocrystalline Ni-Fe alloy were obtained on a metallic substrate. Both porosity and thickness of the electrocatalytic layers can be controlled by the space holder volume content and the sintering process conditions, for example, the applied pressure and temperature. The active surface of the electrode can be increased significantly by a roughness factor of up to 1,120 determined by double layer charging. The porous layers are efficient towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereas activity is greatly influenced by the chemical composition. The porous Ni-Fe electrodes exhibit an extremely low OER-overpotential of 230 mV at 0.3 A cm(-2) in highly concentrated KOH (29.9 wt.-%) at 333 K. Beside the high surface area, the efficiency of the porous Ni-Fe layer is characterized by a high intrinsic activity resulting in a low Tafel slope of around 23 mV dec(-1) at low and 50 mV dec(-1) at high current densities as well as a high turnover frequency (TOF) of approximately 3.4 s(-1) at 0.3 V. The porous Ni electrodes have a lower intrinsic activity with higher Tafel slopes and lower TOF. Moreover, an excellent stability and activity under realistic operating conditions of intermittent electrolysis (up to 1 A cm(-2)) for 100 h was proven for the porous Ni-Fe electrode.

Polyhedrons prepared in the Mn-Si contact area were identified to be chemical composition gradient functionally graded materials which were verified by analyzing atomic ratio of Mn/Si from top to bottom. Evolution of morphology greatly depended on the stacking shape correlated distance from precursor to the substrate, resulting in distinctive growth mechanisms. Main structures on the substrate have been verified to be Mn5Si3 and Mn4Si7 with different Mn stacking in bumps comparing to sole Mn4Si7 with flat surface.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1687-4110	1687-4129		WOS:000423585700001

Although several authors have suggested that the electrodeposition technique is the best alternative to Pb-Co film deposition, the process is complex. In many cases, the use of complexing agents facilitates the electrodeposition of multi-element coatings; but this performance has not been reported in the literature for Pb-Co electrodeposition. In this work, the effect of three different complexing agents (tartaric acid, sodium citrate, and ascorbic acid) on Pb-Co electrodeposition was studied. Speciation diagrams and polarization curves have been used to determine the reduction potentials of Pb2+ and Co2+ ions in the different systems studied. Speciation diagram predictions were incapable of revealing all species present in solution and for an accurate prediction of the actual electrochemical functioning of the system; the information given by the speciation diagrams and polarization curves must be considered together. Additionally, electrodeposition of Pb-Co films was achieved without complexing agent and using the three complexing agents. Morphological and chemical properties of these coatings are shown and discussed in terms of the electrochemical functioning of each system. Finally, the electrocatalytic ability of the Pb-Co films was investigated by means of polarization curves.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000390125500036

This material demonstrates stable hydrogen and oxygen evolution activity in 1.0 m KOH with a small overpotential of 153mV@-10mAcm(-2) and 236mV@100mAcm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, an efficient and stable water electrolyzer with NiSe@Ni1-xFexSe2/nickel foam as both anode and cathode is fabricated, which requires a low overpotential of 1.60V to deliver a current density of 10mAcm(-2).

Particularly, perovskite and pyrochlore oxides have been intensively investigated as bifunctional electrocatalysts because of their superior catalytic activities during the oxygen-reduction and -evolution reactions. However, the origin of the outstanding catalytic activities and structural changes of the materials are not clear, in part due to the difficulty in identification during electrocatalysis.

CuO is chemically deposited on the porous carbon material obtained from the dehydration of common sugar. The morphology of CuO on the porous carbon material is plate-like and monoclinic crystalline phase is confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction. The OER activity of CuO nanostructures is investigated in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. To date, the proposed electrocatalyst has the lowest possible potential of 1.49 V versus RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) to achieve a current density of 20 mA/cm₂ among the CuO based electrocatalysts and has Tafel slope of 115 mV dec-1. The electrocatalyst exhibits an excellent long-term stability for 6 hours along with significant durability. The enhanced catalytic active centers of CuO on the carbon material are due to the porous structure of carbon as well as strong coupling between CuO-C. The functionalization of metal oxides or other related nanostructured materials on porous carbon obtained from common sugar provides an opportunity for the development of efficient energy conversion and energy storage systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1533-4899		MEDLINE:33500083	33500083

Herein, we report a facile microwave synthetic strategy to prepare ultrathin nickel hydroxide nanosheets with thickness <1 nm. In addition, varying the iron incorporation into the parent nickel hydroxide nanosheets allows us to synthesize a series of Ni1-xFex(OH)(2) nanosheets without sacrificing the atomic thickness. Electrochemical studies demonstrate that Fe0.22Ni0.78(OH)(2) nanosheets exhibit the best OER activity, requiring an overpotential of only 315 mV to achieve 10 mA/cm(2) plus strong robustness in 1.0 M KOH. The enhanced OER performance could be mainly attributed to the intrinsically more active sites in Fe0.22Ni0.78(OH)(2). Overall, our work presents a novel and facile approach to obtain ultrathin nanosheets of nickel/iron hydroxides as competent OER electrocatalysts. The microwave synthetic approach could be readily extended to prepare many other ultrathin oxides/hydroxides for various applications.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2574-0962			WOS:000462944700043

The ammonia in the basic solution was oxidizedmainly to nitrogen gas through a direct electrolytic reaction accompanying adsorption at the electrode where theoxygen evolution hardly occurred. The ammonium ion in the neutral and acid solution could be partly decomposed tonitrogen by the OH radicals generated in the condition of oxygen evolution, not by the direct electrode reaction. However,the decomposition rate in the neutral or acid solution was much lower than that in the basic condition. Thehypochlorite ion generated from chloride ion by the electrode was very effective for the decomposition of ammonia andammonium ion to nitrogen. The ammonium ion by hypochlorite in neutral condition was partly changed to NOx gas aswell as to nitrogen gas.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0304-128X			KJD:ART001101743

Herein, a binderfree film composed of nickel ferrite is prepared by the anodic oxidation of a nickel alloy in molten salts. Merits of the electrochemical oxidation in molten salts are highlighted by the generation of the spinel NiFe2O4 film over the Ni-Fe-Cu substrate with full exposure of OER-active Fe species, absence of OERinert CuO species and good adhesion with the substrate. The prepared film electrode therefore exhibits higher electrocatalytic activity than the commercial IrO2/Ta2O5-Ti electrode towards the OER in an alkaline electrolyte. The overpotential to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for the as-prepared electrode is only 326 mV, 27 mV less than that for the IrO2/Ta2O5-Ti electrode. Besides, the prepared nickel ferrite film also exhibits a low Tafel slope of 35.9 mV dec-1, an excellent turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.85 s-1 at an overpotential of 300 mV and high stability after electrolysis at 50 mA cm-2 for 60 h in 1.0 M KOH. The present study highlights the potential for utilization of electrochemical oxidation of metallic substrates in molten salts for the fast preparation of high-quality oxide films with promising functionalities.									29	4	0	0	2	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472183200038

However, its photoelectrochemical (PEC) efficiency is largely constrained by its sluggish oxygen evolution reaction. In this work, the photoelectrochemical performance of hematite was investigated in electrolytes containing different sacrificial agent. The photocurrent densities, onset potential, charge transfer resistance, Helmholtz capacitance at semiconductor liquid junctions (SCLJs), and their correlations were systematically studied. It was found that the onset potential is around the CH peak potential and is related to the photovoltage. The surface states pinning the Fermi levels of the hematite photoanode are related to the adsorbed water molecules regardless of the sacrificial agents in the electrolyte.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			1001-604X	1614-7065		WOS:000383365400005

However, practical electrolysers may use elevated temperatures. There is currently a lack of fundamental understanding of the effect of temperature on the CO2RR. Here, we performed temperature-dependent studies on the CO2RR on a relatively simple electrode material, namely gold, to obtain insights into how temperature influences this reaction and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. A rotating ring disk electrode setup was used to show that the CO2RR activity and selectivity increased with temperature, and to obtain kinetic parameters such as the apparent activation energy and transfer coefficient. The magnitude of the temperature effect and the activation energy was affected by both the cation identity and concentration in the electrolyte. Moreover, the positive effect of temperature on the kinetics of the CO2RR was counteracted by the lower CO2 solubility, making efficient mass transport even more important at higher temperatures.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000811245100001

The deposited PtOx species with an effective Pt oxidation state between +4 and +2 have an oxygen-made environment and include single ion centers {PtOn} and polyatomic ensembles {PtnOm} connected to a TiO2 surface with Pt-O-Ti bonds. The resulting PtOx/TiO2 materials were tested as photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from a water ethanol mixture and have shown uniquely high activity with the rate of H-2 evolution achieving 11 mol h(-1) per gram of Pt, which is the highest result for such materials reported to date. A combination of spectral methods shows that, under HER conditions, reduction of the supported PtOx species leads to the formation of well-dispersed nanoparticles of metallic platinum attached on the surface of TiO2 by Ti-O-Pt bonds. The high activity of the PtOx/TiO2 materials is believed to result from a combination of uniform distribution of small platinum nanoparticles over the titania surface and their close interaction with TiO2.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000586868400038	33064000

By using cyclic voltammetry and constant potential electrolysis, the cathodic reduction reactions were determined and the promoting effect of oxygen concentration in the electrolyte on the process was proved. A rapid electro-reduction of vanadium sesquioxide was achieved under a constant voltage of 4 V at 850 degrees C, the vanadium metal with an oxygen content of 0.3 mass% was obtained. The corresponding current efficiency was around 60%. The reaction kinetic pathway was systematically investigated by analyzing the phase transformations and microstructure evolutions of the products prepared at different electrolysis durations. The reduction mechanism was concluded to start by the direct electro-reduction of V2O3 accompanied with the implantation of aluminium ions to form AlV2O4 intermediate, which was then reduced to vanadium directly through aluminothermic reduction, with aluminium reductant being generated from the electrodeposition reaction. Additionally, by using the low-temperature fluoride salts as the electrolyte, the formed AlV2O4 showed a porous structure composed of small and uniform intermediate particles, which was obviously different from the observations in traditional molten Na3AlF6 salt. This structure could provide more active sites for the reduction reaction and shorten the diffusion path for O2- ion in the solid phase. The possible microstructure transformation mechanisms were also discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000524987200014

The determination of electrochemical stability of TMCs is important to identify their potential use in electrochemical and photoelectrochemical applications. Various TMC thin films were synthesized and characterized with Xray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy. Chronopotentiometrictitration measurements were used to map the stability regions of the TMC thin films over a wide pH range. The stability of the TMC thin films was correlated to the oxygen binding energy of the parent metal.

Here, we report that the OER activities of the (101), (001), and (111) RuO2 surfaces increased, whereas the potential of a pseudocapacitive feature just before OER shifted to lower potentials ("super-Nernstian'' shift) as pH increased on the reversible hydrogen electrode scale. This behavior contrasts with that of the (100) and (110) surfaces, which showed pH-independent Ru redox and OER activity. The link between catalytic and pseudocapacitive behavior illustrates the importance of this redox feature in generating active sites, thus building new mechanistic understanding of the OER.									103	6	0	0	6	0	102			2451-9294			WOS:000408621100013

TEM and Fe-XAS reveal the presence of FeNx moieties and Fe3C particles in the fresh catalyst. NEXAFS reveals the presence of two groups of (Fe)NxCy ensembles, namely (Fe)N-x-pyridinic and (Fe)N-x-pyrrolic. The architecture of the FeNxCy ensembles and their evolution during the ORR has been analysed by XAS, NEXAFS, and identical locations TEM. NxCy, FeNxCy and Fe3C species are partially removed during the ORR, resulting in the formation of Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 particles with different morphologies. The process is more severe in acid electrolyte than in alkaline one. (Fe)N-x-pyrrolic moieties are the main ones in the fresh catalysts, but (Fe) N-x-pyridinic groups are more stable after the ORR. The correlation between the evolution of the ORR activity and that of the FeNxCy ensembles indicates that FeNx-pyridinic ensembles are responsible for the ORR activity.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000621173000004

The physicochemical properties of the modified beta-PbO2 electrodes were analyzed by spectral methods and electrochemical measurements. The results showed that the surface morphology of the fluoride-doped electrodes held the characteristics of crystal grain of beta-PbO2. The beta-PbO2 electrode doped by 40mM F- ion had longer service life, higher potentials for the oxygen evolution reaction and more generation of hydroxyl radical(OH). Furthermore, the acid orange II (AOII) decay on the electrodes were analyzed, and results illustrated that using 40 mM F- ion was much superior to prepare beta-PbO2 electrode for its higher electrocatalytic activity and mineralization ability.									3	1	0	0	1	1	5			1452-3981			WOS:000366307100068

Of particular significance in the analysis is that the combustion mechanism dependence of the CO and CO(2) profiles were taken into account. Catalysts were laboratory coked at temperatures ranging from 200 to 600 degrees C under otherwise identical conditions. Two types of coke are identified, with the quantity of saturated coke decreasing and polyaromatic coke increasing as the coking temperature is raised. Trends, which are observed in the combustion rate-determining steps, indicate increased stability of the polyaromatic coke. Major differences in the TPO profiles of an industrial spent cracking catalyst, when compared with the laboratory-coked samples, suggest differences in the propensity for oxide formation. Reaction orders with respect to oxygen partial pressures indicate that the intrinsic rate of carbon monoxide evolution is independent of oxygen while carbon dioxide formation shows a more complicated dependence. It follows from the isokinetic temperature for the evolution of carbon dioxide from all substrates that the characteristic vibrational frequency is 674 +/- 31 cm(-1), which corresponds to the bending motion of CO(2).									23	1	0	0	0	0	24			0887-0624			WOS:000081614400015

Due to its high durability and catalytic activity, platinum is widely used to catalyse the oxygen reduction and hydrogen oxidation reactions essential to the operation of these cells. Core@shell nanoparticles with thin layers of platinum deposited on cores composed of cheaper materials have offered an attractive route towards the reduction of overall loading of platinum, with the retention of active catalyst surface area. This review surveys approaches taken to prepare idealised active and durable core@shell nanocatalysts by tweaking core compositions. A critical reflection on the current status of the field, as well as predictions as to likely directions for future developments, are discussed as a conclusion to the review.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1745-8080	1745-8099		WOS:000454332600001

However, most of the reported PBAs only undergo surface reconstruction and the PBAs cannot be fully converted to active species, resulting in unsatisfactory activity. In this work, taking NiFe PBA nanocubes as an example, a chemical-physical synergistic etching strategy is developed to enable the deep reconstruction of NiFe PBA nanocubes, thus promoting the OER activity. After etching, the NiFe PBA nanocubes are converted to NiFe PBA nanoboxes with hollow structure and dual vacancies (Ni vacancy and CN vacancy), facilitating the deep reconstruction of NiFe PBAs to NiOOH/FeOOH nanoboxes. Benefiting from the structural and compositional merits, the NiOOH/FeOOH nanoboxes exhibit a low overpotential of 216 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, the assembled Zn-air battery based on NiOOH/FeOOH nanoboxes delivers high peak power density (185 mW cm(-2)) and superb cycling stability (over 2000 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2)), outperforming the commercial RuO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000865267100001

Herein, a tunable photodeposition method was utilized for the construction of Ru@FeCoP with rich Ru/FeCoP heterointerfaces. Strikingly, the eta(100) value of Ru@FeCoP was only 0.0741 V for the HER and 0.314 V for OER, which was reduced by 63.8% and 55.2% compared to Pt/C and RuO2 benchmarks, respectively. The mechanism investigation revealed that Ru at the Ru/FeCoP heterointerfaces not only offers highly active sites for HER but also pulls electrons from FeCoP, which facilitates the generation of Fe and Co with high valency, thereby increasing the OER activity. This work overcomes the problem of low water-splitting efficiency of precious metals by constructing a metal/phosphide heterostructure to drive a dual-active site mechanism and provides an effective route for the preparation of high-performance water-dissociation electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000826544400001

The solvothermal decomposition of the complex in two different solvents, viz. 1-dodecanethiol (DT) and octadecyl amine (ODA), yielded two different nickel sulfides, viz.Ni-DT and Ni-ODA, respectively. These sulfides have been characterized by PXRD and SEM. Rietveld refinement analyses of Ni-DT revealed that it comprises two phases of nickel sulfide, viz. NiS and Ni3S3, while Ni-ODA possesses only a single phase of Ni2S3. The newly synthesized materials have been used as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution half-cell reaction of water splitting. The electrochemical studies suggest that Ni-DT/Ni-ODA has a good electrocatalytic activity towards the OER at a low overpotential of similar to 200 mV with eta(1) being 342 mV and 243 mV for Ni-DT and Ni-ODA, respectively, at a scan rate of 1 mV s(-1).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000796037400001

In order to make water electrolysis efficient, the limiting oxygen evolution reaction (OER) needs to be optimized. Therefore, C-based composite materials containing earth-abundant Fe and Mn were synthesized, characterized and tested in the OER. For pyrolysis temperatures above 700 degrees C N-rich multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are obtained. Inside the tubes Fe3C particles are formed, Fe and Mn oxides are incorporated in the carbon matrix and metal spinel nanoparticles cover the outer surface. The best catalyst prepared at 800 degrees C achieves a low overpotential of 389 mV (at 10 mA/cm(2)) and high stability (22.6 h). From electrochemical measurements and characterization it can be concluded that the high activity is mainly provided by MWCNT, Fe3C and the metal oxides in the conductive carbon matrix. The metal spinel nanoparticles in contrast protect the MWCNT from oxidation and thereby contribute to the high stability.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000572180000001

Herein, we demonstrate the low-temperature and rapid synthesis of hollow CuS0.55 nanoparticles on a Cu foam as highly active OER electrocatalysts through an anodic oxidation electrodeposition technique. The large electrochemically active surface area and strong adsorption ability of Cu sites to targeted OOH* intermediates are beneficial for enhancing catalytic properties. As a consequence, the hollow CuS0.55 nanoparticles exhibit an ultralow overpotential of 386 mV to achieve a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media with a very small Tafel slope of 33 mV dec(-1), which is among the best reported for Cu-based electrocatalysts. The turnover frequency (TOF) is approximately 6 times higher than those of the corresponding CuS0.57 and CuO catalysts. This work provides a simple and feasible approach that can be scaled up easily to construct low-cost and efficient Cu-based OER electrocatalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

LiNi0.8Fe0.2O2 exhibits OER activity that is better than that of LiNiO2 and other Fe substituted LiNiO2 catalysts, while Li1.2Ni0.8Fe0.2O2 shows OER activity that is much higher than that of LiNi0.8Fe0.2O2 and Li0.8Ni0.8Fe0.2O2 . The best OER activity is achieved on Li1.2Ni0.8Fe0.2O2 with a Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1) and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 302 mV, better than that for the benchmark IrO2 catalyst. Combined with the density functional theory calculations, the enhanced OER activity is mainly attributed to the unique electronic structure derived from the interaction of Li, Ni, and Fe in the materials and the layered structure which plays an important role in stabilizing the high valence states of Ni and Fe during the OER.									29	2	0	0	1	0	31			2380-8195			WOS:000405979900024

However, due to the intrinsically sluggish six-electron transfer process, the efficiency of UOR is still not satisfied. In response, we synthesized a bimetallic NiFe-MIL-53-NH2 with superior activity toward UOR, which only needs a low potential of 1.398 V vs. RHE to obtain 50 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea, much lower than that in 1.0 M KOH (1.721 V vs. RHE). Furthermore, NiFe-MIL-53-NH2 presents significantly more excellent UOR activity compared to its monometallic counterparts. The TOF value in NiFe-MIL-53-NH2 (0.16 s(-1)) at 1.4 V vs. RHE is about 133- and 246-folds higher than that Ni-MIL-53-NH2 (1.2 x 10(-3) s(-1)) and Fe-MIL-53-NH2 (6.5 x 10(-)(4) s(-1)), respectively. XPS characterization discloses that the incorporation of Fe into Ni-MIL-53-NH2 framework optimizes the local charge distribution of metal nodes, leading to the formation of electrophilic Ni3+ and nucleophilic Fe3+ species, which can absorb electron-donating -NH2 and electron-withdrawing C = O groups in urea, respectively, and therefore result in excellent UOR. This simple strategy of regulating local charge distribution of active species by fabricating bimetallic MOFs provides a new strategy and direction to explore other highly efficient UOR electrocatalysts.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000784267200002

Dual-atomic-site catalysts (DASCs), as an extension of single-atom catalysts (SACs), have recently drawn surging attention. The DASCs possess higher metal loading, more sophisticated and flexible active sites, offering more chance for achieving better catalytic performance, compared with SACs. In this review, recent advances on how to design new DASCs for enhancing energy catalysis will be highlighted. It will start with the classification of marriage of two kinds of single-atom active sites, homonuclear DASCs and heteronuclear DASCs according to the configuration of active sites. Then, the state-of-the-art characterization techniques for DASCs will be discussed. Different synthetic methods and catalytic applications of the DASCs in various reactions, including oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, carbon monoxide oxidation reaction, and others will be followed. Finally, the major challenges and perspectives of DASCs will be provided.									69	2	0	0	5	0	68			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000676117600001	34296795

Herein, our theoretical calculation shows that Fe will be more energetically favorable in the tetrahedral site than Ni and Co, which can further regulate their electronic structure of binary NiCo spinel oxides for optimal adsorption energies of OER intermediates and improved electronic conductivity and hence boost their OER performance. X-ray absorption spectroscopy study on the as synthesized NiCoFe oxide catalysts indicates that Fe preferentially dopes into tetrahedral sites of the lattice, which induces high proportions of Ni3+ and Co2+ on the octahedral sites (the active sites in OER). Consequently, this material exhibits a significantly enhanced OER performance with an ultralow overpotential of 201 mV cm(-2) at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1), which are much superior to state-of-the-art Ni-Co based catalysts.									117	8	0	0	10	0	118			0002-7863			WOS:000469292300023	31017412

As a proof of concept, we have studied the simplest oxygenate, methanol, which is photoelectrochemically oxidized at thin film tungsten oxide (WO3) photoelectrodes. When the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is coupled with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), this process is known as methanol electrolysis. We demonstrate that catalytic modification of the WO3 surface by the electrodeposition of Pt particles can greatly increase MOR activity at the photoanode, resulting in a significant increase in H-2 production rates from methanol electrolysis. This improvement is greatest at low overpotentials and high Pt loadings, with the demonstrated MOR current density of Pt-WO3 being nearly four times that of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on WO3 at a potential of 0.8 V vs. the Reversible Hydrogen Electrode. We also illustrate how the increase in WO3 photocurrent and the decrease in the oxidation onset potential, compared to the OER, make it possible to use WO3-based photoelectrodes in a simple tandem cell configuration whereby a common PV component such as a-Si can provide the remaining voltage to achieve unassisted methanol electrolysis. Results from methanol electrolysis reveal the potential to utilize a similar approach for larger biomass-derived oxygenates, which could be a promising pathway to H-2 production from renewable feedstock using photo-driven electrolysis.

J	Du, Xiaoqiang; Fu, Jianpeng; Zhang, Xiaoshuang								Construction of a MnCo2O4@NiyMx (S and P) crosslinked network for efficient electrocatalytic water splitting								CRYSTENGCOMM				21	47			7293	7302		10.1039/c9ce01594a				DEC 21 2019	2019	The preparation of stable, efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts is a very good strategy for the production of hydrogen and oxygen by water splitting. A precursor material based on MnCo is directly grown on 3-dimensional hollow nickel foam through a simple hydrothermal synthesis method. The MnCo oxide presents a flake-like graded material with controllable morphology by varying the reaction time. Combined with the good catalytic performance of Ni3S2, the two components MnCo2O4 and Ni3S2 can produce synergistic effects in the water splitting process and improve the activity of the electrocatalysts. MnCo2O4@Ni3S2 presents superior catalytic activity and in order to achieve a current density of 40 mA cm(-2), an external voltage of 200 mV is required in 1 M KOH solution for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) test. For the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) test, an external voltage of only 110 mV is required in order to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). MnCo2O4@Ni3S2 is used as a fully hydrolyzed cathode and anode, and a cell voltage of 1.60 V is required in order to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium. Moreover, the material also exhibits good electrochemical stability; it does not decay when the current density is maintained for 15 h.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1466-8033			WOS:000507597200011

Surface modification with an electrocatalyst on the photoelectrode is effective for maximizing the water splitting efficiency of the PEC cell. Herein, we investigate the effects of surface modification of Ta3N5 photoanodes with electrocatalysts consisting of Ni, Fe, and Co oxides, and their mixture, on the PEC oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Among the investigated samples, NiFeOx-modified Ta3N5 (NiFeOx/Ta3N5) photoanodes showed the lowest onset potential for OER. A PEC cell with a parallel configuration consisting of a NiFeOx/Ta3N5 photoanode and an Al-doped La5Ti2Cu0.9Ag0.1S5O7 (LTCA:Al) photocathode exhibited stoichiometric hydrogen and oxygen generation from water splitting, without any external bias voltage. The solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency (STH) of this cell for water splitting was found to be 0.2% at 1 min after the start of the reaction. In addition, water splitting by a PEC cell with a tandem configuration incorporating a NiFeOx/Ta3N5 transparent photoanode prepared on a quartz insulating substrate as a front-side electrode and a LTCA:Al photocathode as a back side electrode was demonstrated, and the STH was found to be 0.04% at the initial stage of the reaction.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				2073-4344		WOS:000653655700001

However, the poor morphology controllability and limited surface areas have severely limited their applications. We present a generalizable synthesis strategy to fabricate a library of one-dimensional (1D) inorganic perovskite nanomeshes via pyrolysis of metal salt-polymer fibers. Within the evaluated pemvskite nanomeshes, La0.5Ba0.5Co0.8Ni0.2O3 delivers the most remarkable performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Combined X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that introduction of additional metals endows more flexible electronic structures to realize the electron transfer in 1D pemvskite nanomeshes. This work demonstrates a scalable and retrosynthetic route to easily synthesize the inorganic pemvskite nanomaterials with tunable compositions.									6	0	0	0	1	0	5			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000702576900005		
J	Koc, R								Kinetics and phase evolution during carbothermal synthesis of titanium carbide from ultrafine titania/carbon mixture								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				33	4			1049	1055		10.1023/A:1004332416351				FEB 15 1998	1998	The kinetics and phase evolution of the TiC formation process by carbothermal reduction of ultrafine titania/carbon mixture were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and oxygen analysis. Titania (TiO2) first lowered its oxidation state to Ti3O5 via an unidentified phase (possibly one of the Magneli phases). Then Ti3O5 was further reduced to Ti2O3, followed by the formation of titanium oxycarbide (TiCxOy) phase and its purification toward high purity TiC thereafter. Ti2O3 was the oxide phase with the lowest oxidation state before forming TiCxOy phase. In the isothermal TGA trace, the formation of Ti3O5 showed a diffusion-controlled process; possibly carbon diffusion limited the solid state reaction. The formation of Ti2O3 and TiCxOy was interpreted to be associated with CO gas-assisted reduction reaction, based on constant reaction rate for each process. The activation energy for the formation of Ti2O3 (from Ti3O5) and TiCxOy (from Ti2O3) phase were calculated to be 415.6 and 264.3 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The TiC powder synthesized at 1550 degrees C for 4 h in flowing argon atmosphere showed fine particle size (0.3-0.6 mu m) with oxygen content of 0.7 wt% and lattice parameter of 0.4328 nm while interparticle agglomeration was moderate.

Evolution of Heterogeneity and Chemical Functionality during the Oxidation of Graphite								COLLOIDS AND INTERFACES				6	3					44	10.3390/colloids6030044				SEP 2022	2022	A kinetic study of graphite oxidation provided several insights into the mechanism of graphite oxide (GO) synthesis. The oxidation was observed to occur in two distinct stages, with the first stage lasting for 20 to 30 min and including a rapid disruption of the graphene sp(2) network, the introduction of oxygen functional groups, and an increase in the spacing between the sheets. The second stage saw a marked decrease in the rate of change in spacing, a significant increase in the homogeneity of the GO, little to no further disruption of the sp(2) network, and continuing evolution of the oxygen functionality. The study was based on the analysis by Raman spectroscopy, XRD, FTIR, SEM, and TGA of material taken at various times from a modified Hummers oxidation reaction following work up.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2504-5377		WOS:000856336400001

The first type was prepared by a galvanostatic deposition using 40 mA cm-2 current density and varying deposition time from 1 to 60 min. A porous layer was obtained which exhibited passive behaviour during potentiodynamic polarization at positive potentials before commencement of the oxygen evolution reaction. This layer has been electrochemically activated to a second type of electrode by square wave pulses between -0.2 and + 0.85 V vs. SCE. The complete reduction of the oxide is a necessary condition for the activation process. A potentiostatic electrodeposition and a galvanostatic electrodeposition using low current density and short deposition time produced electrodes whose voltammetric behaviour was similar to a bulk ruthenium electrode in acid solution.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0011-1643	1334-417X		WOS:A1991GQ51700017

The rise of group functionalized g-C3N4 based on defect engineering has set off a new wave of research in recent years, especially in photocatalysis. In this review, the recent process in functional group defect strategies to design high-efficiency g-C3N4-based photocatalysts, including cyanamide/cyano moiety, urea group, oxygen-containing groups (-OH, -COOH), and aromatic motifs, has been strictly analyzed so as to inspire critical thinking about the efficient methodology for the rational design of polymeric photocatalysts. The applications of the group functionalized g-C3N4 in photocatalytic water splitting, CO2 reduction, H-2 evolution, ammonia synthesis, H2O2 production, and disinfection are summarized. The current challenges and future promising applications of the group functionalized g-C3N4 materials for advanced catalysts are also discussed.									8	1	0	0	1	0	8			2166-532X			WOS:000595886100001

Under simulated solar light, AgTa0.7Nb0.3O3 could split water into hydrogen and oxygen in a stoichiometric ratio, and enhancement of the reaction rate owing to the cocatalyst deposition was observed. In particular, co-loading of Pt and Co-Pi considerably enhanced the photocatalytic activity, whereas the enhancement was moderate when either was loaded alone. A possible mechanism for the enhancement is explained based on the band position of AgTa0.7Nb0.3O3 against redox potentials for hydrogen and oxygen evolution.

The rational design of heterostructures and anchoring single-atom catalysts (SAC) are the two successful strategies to lower these overpotentials, but realization of such advanced nanostructures with adequate electronic control is challenging. Here, the heterostructure of edge-oriented molybdenum selenide (MoSe2) and nickel-cobalt-selenide (NiCo2Se4) realized through selenization of mixed metal oxide/hydroxide is presented. The as-developed sheet-on-sheet heterostructure shows excellent HER performance, requiring an overpotential of 89 mV to get a current density 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1). Further, resultant MoSe2@NiCo2Se4 is photochemically decorated with single-atom iridium, which on electrochemical surface reconstruction displays outstanding OER activity, requiring only 200 and 313 mV overpotentials for 10 and 500 mA cm(-2) current densities, respectively. A full cell electrolyzer comprising of MoSe2@NiCo2Se4 as cathode and its SAC-Ir decorated counterpart as anode requires only 1.51 V to attain 10 mA cm(-2) current density. Density functional theory calculation reveals the importance of rational heterostructure design and synergistic electronic coupling of single atom iridium in HER and OER processes, respectively.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000780102200001	35403815

Of course, these reactions are inherently very favorable, and they occur rapidly with the release of a great deal of energy at high temperature. Nature has been able to tap this sequestered reservoir of energy with great spatial and temporal selectivity at ambient temperatures through the evolution of oxidase and oxygenase enzymes. One mechanism used by these enzymes for O-2 activation has been studied in detail for the soluble form of the enzyme methane monooxygenase. These studies have revealed the step-by-step process of O-2 activation and insertion into the ultimately stable C-H bond of methane. Additionally, an elegant regulatory mechanism has been defined that enlists size selection and quantum tunneling to allow methane oxidation to occur specifically in the presence of more easily oxidized substrates.									69	0	1	0	36	0	69			0066-4154	1545-4509	978-0-8243-0888-9	WOS:000472818600017	30633550

This article demonstrates this ability with a ternary nanoalloy of platinum with vanadium and cobalt for oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells. The strategy is to enable nanoscale alloying and structural perfection through oxidative-reductive thermochemical treatments. The structural manipulation is shown to produce a significant enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity of the ternary nanoalloy catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction. Mass activities as high as 1 A/mg of Pt have been achieved by this strategy based on direct measurements of the kinetic currents from rotating disk electrode data. Using a synchrotron high-energy X-ray diffraction technique coupled with atomic pair function analysis and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the atomic-scale structural and chemical ordering in nanoalloy catalysts prepared by the oxidative-reductive thermochemical treatments were examined. A phase transition has been observed, showing an fcc-type structure of the as-prepared and the lower-temperature-treated particles into an fct-type structure for the particles treated at the higher temperature. The results reveal a thermochemically driven evolution of the nanoalloys from a chemically disordered state into chemically ordered state with an enhanced degree of alloying. The increase in the chemical ordering and shrinking of interatomic distances as a result of thermochemical treatment at increased temperature is shown to increase the catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction, exhibiting an optimal activity at 600 degrees C. It is the alloying and structural perfection that allows the optimization of the catalytic performance in a controllable way, highlighting the significant role of atomic-scale structural and chemical ordering in the design of nanoalloy catalysts.									43	2	0	0	0	0	43			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000313769300003

A detailed analysis of the optical and redox properties has been carried out by comparing their optical spectroscopy, electrochemistry and spectroelectrochemistry to trends predicted in a series of DFT and TD-DFT calculations. The results demonstrate that Co(III)corroles are highly effective catalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs). Moreover, there is a marked enhancement in their homogenous catalytic ability when halogen atoms are introduced at the B position, which demonstrates that facile modifying the meso-aryl rings is a effective strategy for developing new HER catalysts. The electrochemical results demonstrate that an unusual two step modulation of HER reactions can be achieved by using singly and doubly electrochemical reduced cobalt triarylcorroles anions.

Herein, a novel method is described to achieve high-performance perovskite ORR catalyst via combining nano architecture designs, internal structures engineering, and Ag nanoparticles (NPs) in situ exsolution. The as-synthesized Ag-(PrBa)(0.95)Mn2O5+delta catalyst exhibits favorable ORR activity with durability superior to the state-of-the-art Pt/C in alkaline solution. Several characterization techniques were applied alongside density functional theory calculations to understand the possible active sites and the synergistic coupling effects that contributed to the high ORR performance. The strong interfacial anchoring of Ag NPs on the ordered oxygen deficient perovskites leads to significant ligand effect and facilitates electron transfer and ion migration within the oxygen reduction reaction. The systematic engineering of perovskites described here represents a brand new approach to developing highly active and stable catalyst for energy conversion and storage.									45	1	0	0	3	0	45			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000405202800046

We observe the hydroxyl OH, the atomic oxygen O, and the hydroperoxyl HO2 radicals, as well as the oxygen O-2 and hydrogen peroxide H2O2 molecules in irradiated porous amorphous solid water (p-ASW) and crystalline (I-cryst) ice films. The evolution of their concentrations with the temperature indicates that HO2, O-2, and H2O2 result from a simple step reaction fuelled by OH, where O-2 is a product of HO2 and HO2 a product of H2O2. The local order of ice is also modified, whatever the initial structure is. The crystalline ice I-cryst becomes amorphous. The high-density amorphous phase (I(a)h) of ice is observed after irradiation of the p-ASW film, whose initial structure is the normal low-density form of the amorphous ice (I(a)l). The phase I(a)h is thus peculiar to irradiated ice and does not exist in the as-deposited ice films. A new "very high density" amorphous phase-we call I(a)vh-is obtained after warming at 50 K the irradiated p-ASW ice.

Here, a fast phosphating strategy to establish a Pt/Pt5P2 porous nanocage with numerous heterointerfaces and defects is presented. It exhibits extraordinary activity and stability for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a small overpotential of 29 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) with a high mass activity of 1.37 A mg(Pt)(-1) at peak values, surpassing Pt/C. Microstructural analyzes show that many stacking faults are induced around heterointerfaces, while rich vacancies and atomic steps are created by the phosphorus-induced thermal migration of Pt atoms, serving as highly active low-coordination sites. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that introducing P atoms can modify the electronic configuration of Pt, thus optimizing H2O/H* binding strength and lowering water dissociation energy to accelerate HER, while decreasing the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step (*CHO to *HCOOH) to facilitate MOR.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000836882300001

The studies of SEM, TEM, XRD, XRF and XPS certified the strong coupling between NiFeOx nanosheets and Bi2WO6 nanosheets. Significantly, the electrochemical test results revealed that the NiFeOx/Bi2WO6 with good activity and stability for OER under alkaline conditions. The increased performance was attributed to the synergistic effect of the NiFeOx Ns which grown uniformly on the Bi2WO6 Ns, the abundant Bi-O-Fe, W-O-Fe, W-O-Ni and Bi-O-Ni species act as strong bonds between NiFeOx Ns and Bi2WO6 Ns and the Fe-ion and oxygen vacancies presence in NiFeOx Ns, which can significantly increase the ECSA and active sites, enhanced the electron transfer capacity, decreased charge-transfer resistance, stabilizes Ni2+ and improved conductivity in the process of electrochemistry.

Precious-metal-based RuOx and IrOx are expensive and degrade in the presence of electrolyte; thus, the development of low-cost and eco-friendly OER electrocatalysts is needed. This review summarizes the recent status of the nonprecious manganese metal-oxide-based electrocatalysts with reference to nanostructure, defect engineering, hybrid composite formation, and core-shell formation to achieve efficient OER performance. In particular, we focus on the strategies used to lower the onset potential and the Tafel slope of the water oxidation process.

Here, we report a noble metal-free NiS-based electrocatalyst suitable for acidic OER media through a facile one-step pyrolysis approach. The prepared NiS particles display high crystallinity and are coupled on a sulfur-doped carbon nitrogen support. Synchrotron X-ray spectroscopies demonstrate that the strong hybridization of Ni and S not only provides a favorable electronic structure for the adsorption and dissociation of water but also offers high stability against the corrosive acidic media.

Herein, uniformly dispersed and size-controllable iridium (Ir) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared using a nitrogen-functionalized carbon as the support (Ir/CN). We found that nitrogen functionalization can simultaneously modulate the size of Ir NPs to substantially enhance the catalytically active sites and adjust the electronic structure of Ir, thereby promoting electrocatalytic activity for water splitting. Consequently, the as-synthesized Ir/CN shows excellent electrocatalytic performance with overpotentials of 12 and 265 mV for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in basic medium, respectively. These findings may pave the way for designing and synthesizing other similar materials as efficient catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.									28	0	0	0	1	0	28			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000438179000062	29900740

Under the background of "carbon peak" and "carbon neutral", the development of hydrogen energy has become the strategic deployment of all countries in the world. Renewable energy is converted into electric energy, and hydrogen production from water electrolysis is further realized through electric energy, which is currently considered as one of the safe and green way of hydrogen production. However, in the actual process of hydrogen production by electrolysis of water, there are problems such as high reaction overpotential and low energy conversion efficiency, which seriously restrict the cost of hydrogen production. During water electrolysis, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occur at negative and positive electrodes respectively. Compared with the HER process of the two-electron reaction, the four-electron OER process requires a higher overpotential. Therefore, the four-electron OER process becomes the decisive step of the reaction. In order to achieve high efficiency and low energy consumption of hydrogen production process, it is urgent to use cheap, efficient and stable OER catalyst. At present, the search for efficient and low-cost OER catalyst is still the "holy grail" of water splitting. Among many non-noble metal catalysts, NiFe-layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs) are considered as an ideal OER electrocatalyst in alkaline conditions due to their low raw material cost and adjustable structure. However, for NiFe-LDHs laminates, it is generally believed that the edge metal sites have higher catalytic activity than the internal metal sites, which leads to the insufficient utilization of the metal sites inside the laminates and reduces the catalytic activity of the OER reaction.In order to solve the above problems, based on the microstructural regulation of NiFe-LDHs, some methods have been used to improve its catalytic activity and stability in the OER process. Heterogeneous element doping is considered to be an effective method to regulate the electronic structure and electrochemical activity of catalysts. Metal ion doping (Cr, Cu, V, etc.) can optimize the electronic structure of nickel metal active site, reduce reaction overpotential, and improve catalytic efficiency. However, the high biotoxicity of traditional transition metals (Cr, V, Cu, etc.) limits their industrial application. Mn (Mn2+(sic)Mn3+(sic)Mn4+) with rich variation characteristics has a potential role in regulating lamellar charge characteristics.Herein, in order to fully improve the utilization of NiFe-LDHs laminates, this study introduces manganese ions with variable valence characteristics into NiFe-LDHs laminates (Mn-NiFe-LDHs), and utilizes the variable valence characteristics of manganese ions to fully enhance the carrier mobility and promote electron transfer in the laminate. At the same time, due to the electronegativity characteristics of manganese ions, part of the electrons will be transferred from the vicinity of the nickel site to the vicinity of the manganese site, causing the nickel site to exhibit electron-deficient characteristics, which enhance the overall capture of the electron-rich oxygen-containing functional groups of the laminate, thereby effectively enhancing the OER catalytic activity. According to the results of the catalytic reaction, the Mn-NiFeLDHs electrode exhibits an overpotential of only 332 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), which is lower than the initial NiFe-LDHs of 384 mV. The reasonable doping of manganese ions can effectively adjust the Ni2+ site activity and enhance its electrocatalytic activity. And to further clarify the effect of doping on the activity of LDHs laminates to provide experimental facts support.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0023-074X	2095-9419		WOS:000836799000012

In this study, we report an approach to synthesize cobalt/nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (Co-NCNTs) for high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity by cobalt catalyzed carbonization of biomass chitosan. It is found that the existence of cobalt results in the transition of graphene-like carbon nanosheets to tubular graphitic carbons. Moreover, a strong chemical bonding of cobalt with nitrogen and carbon in Co-NCNTs is found, which is important for enhancing the ORR activity. The Co-NCNT catalyst under optimized synthetic conditions displays attractive ORR activity superior to those of commercial Pt/C catalysts. Furthermore, the mechanism behind the enhanced ORR activity has also been studied. This study provides a feasible synthesis approach for the scalable production of biomass derived high performance carbon based ORR catalysts.									87	5	0	0	8	0	87			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431506600031

However, the MoS2 prepared by traditional hydrothermal method is usually 2H (hexagonal) semiconducting state with limited active sites and unsatisfied conductivity, hindering the improvement of hydrogen evolution efficiency. Herein, the MoS2 nanoflowers are in-situ grown successfully on graphite felt (GF) by hydrothermal method, and a simple and effective electrochemical activation is proposed to enhance the hydrogen evolution activity of the composite. The electrical activation in acidic medium guides the intercalation of protons between MoS2 and GF, and the increased interlayer spacing between MoS2 is conducive to the adsorption and release of hydrogen. The synergistic effect between MoS2 and GF is enhanced, resulting in accelerated electron transfer through S sites in MoS2 and oxygen-containing functional group in GF. The experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) computations demonstrate that the electrical activated catalyst possesses excellent electrocatalytic activity and long-term operation stability (Tafel slope is 48 mV dec(-1), the overpotential is 82 mV at current density of -10 mA cm(-2)). Our research confirms the electrochemical activation is a simple technique for enhancing the hydrogen evolution efficiency of MoS2/GF composite as well as other transition metal chalcogenides and carbon materials.

However, it remains a grand challenge to address the best candidates from thousands of possible COFs. Here, we report a methodology for the design of the best candidate screened from 100 virtual M-NxOy) (M = 3d transition metal)-based model catalysts via density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML). The intrinsic descriptors of OER activity of M-NxYy, were addressed by the machine learning and used for predicting the best structure with OER performances. One of the predicted structures with a Ni-N2O2 unit is subsequently employed to synthesize the corresponding Ni-COF. X-ray absorption spectra characterizations, including XANES and EXAFS, validate the successful synthesis of the Ni-N2O2 coordination environment. The studies of electrocatalytic activities confirm that Ni-COF is comparable with the best reported COF-based OER catalysts. The current density reaches 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 335 mV. Furthermore, Ni- COF is stable for over 65 h during electrochemical testing. This work provides an accelerating strategy for the design of new porous crystalline-material-based electrocatalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2691-3704		WOS:000703333000019	34604858

The residual carbon ratios after annealing at various temperatures from 250 to 1000 degrees C increase progressively from 44.3 to 84.8%. The oxygen containing functional groups are intensively removed at higher annealing temperature. The thermally stable phenols, ethers, and carbonyls become the major components in 1000 degrees C annealed TRG. Though the starting material G250 owns a high specific capacitance of 170.5 F/g, the value decreases to only 47.5 F/g when the annealing temperature is increased to 1000 degrees C. The oxygen containing functional groups can enhance the capacitance performance of TRGs by introducing abundant pseudocapacitance active sites through reversible Faradic redox reactions. The correlation between the structural evolution and electrochemical performance of TRGs provides new insight for designing graphene based electrodes with controllable properties for advanced supercapacitors.

However, current research is insufficient to account for their complex reaction mechanism and application. Here, the structural evolution of lithium-manganese-rich layered oxides at different temperatures during electrochemical cycling has been investigated thoroughly, and their structural stability has been designed. The results indicated structure conversion from the two structures into a core-shell structure with a single distorted-monoclinic LiTMO2 structure core and disordered-spinel/rock salt structure shell, along with lattice oxygen extraction and lattice densification, transition- metal migration, and aggregation on the crystal surface. The structural conversion behavior was found to be seriously temperature sensitive, accelerated with higher temperature, and can be effectively adjusted by structural design. This study clarifies the structural evolution mechanism of these lithium-rich layered oxides and opens the door to the design of similar high-energy materials with better cycle stability.									109	14	0	0	6	0	112			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000451100600023	30347983

The scaling relationship between the binding energies of OER intermediates (HOO* versus HO*) is found to follow essentially the same trend as for undoped oxides. Our theoretical analysis shows a lower overpotential associated with OER on the doped M-TiO2(110) than on the undoped TiO2(110).

The open-circuit potential for these electrodes in 0.5 mol L-1 H2SO4 presented quite stable similar values. X-ray diffraction analyses showed the thermal-electrochemical oxide to be a mixture of ort-PbO, tetr-PbO and ort-PbO2. On the other hand, the electrodes obtained by electrodeposition were in the tetr-PbO2 form. Analyses by scanning electron microscopy showed that the basic morphology of the thermal-electrochemical PbO2 is determined in the thermal step, being quite distinct from that of the electrodeposited electrodes. Polarization curves in 0.5 mol L-1 H2SO4 showed that in the case of the thermal-electrochemical PbO2 electrodes the OER was shifted to more positive potentials. However, the values of the Tafel slopes, quite high, indicate that passivating films were possibly formed on the Ti substrates, which could eventually explain the somewhat low current values for OER.					11th Brazilian Symposium on Electrochemistry and Electroanalysis11th Brazilian Symposium on Electrochemistry and Electroanalysis	APR 05-09, 1999APR 05-09, 1999		MARAGOGI, BRAZILMARAGOGI, BRAZIL	12	0	0	0	4	2	12			0103-5053			WOS:000089337600018

The transition metal oxides hold promise as catalysts for the replacement of noble-metal catalysts with high activity for OER. One of the challenges is how to finely design and tune the micro-structure of the kind of catalysts with enhanced electrochemical activities. Herein, we report on the tuned synthesis of ultrathin nanosheets made of amorphous cobalt manganese oxide (A-CoMnO) with an average thickness of ca. 0.69 nm, and the unique superiority and potential in the OER has also been demonstrated. The results indicate that it is the Co ion-intercalation effects that help to tailor the structure of the amorphous ultrathin A-CoMnO nanosheets at the atomic-and nano-scale, resulting in an enhanced activity for OER due to the active sites that are highly exposed and easily accessible to electrolyte ions. Benefiting from these combined characteristics, the A-CoMnO nanosheets catalyst exhibits highly catalytic activity and stability in water oxidation, outperforming the corresponding noble-metal and highcrystalline catalysts under similar conditions, which is capable of delivering a current density of ca. 498 mA cm(2) at overpotential of 500 mV with a catalyst loading of 0.2 mg cm(-2).									13	1	0	0	0	0	14			2405-8297			WOS:000418533600031

Herein, an excellent highly dispersed Co nanoparticle decorated N-doped defective carbon nano-framework (Co-N-C) derived from a ZnCo bimetal organic framework (bi-MOF) is reported. A high specific surface area originating from zinc evaporation facilitates the adsorption and desorption of oxygen, which promotes the accessibility of catalytic sites. The abundant Co-N-C species act as strong bridging bonds between Co nanoparticles and carbon materials which facilitate interfacial electron transfer. Co-N-C-0.5 (0.5 represents the molar ratio of Zn in the initial ZIF-67) exhibits a low overpotential gap of 0.94 V due to the number of active sites (e.g. N-doped defective carbon and the CoNx/Co composite) and fast interfacial electron transfer. In addition, a hybrid Na-air battery with the Co-N-C-0.5 material displays a low voltage gap of 0.31 V and a high round-trip efficiency of 90.0% at a current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2). More importantly, the hybrid Na-air battery shows fantastic cyclability for charging and discharging due to its stable structure. Our results confirm Co-N-C materials derived from a bi-MOF as alternatives to high-cost Pt/C catalysts for ORR and OER activities in metal-air batteries.									32	3	0	0	1	0	34			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000514861300012	31960854

Herein, a hierarchical electrode material comprising nickel foam (NF) and W, Ru co-doped ultrathin NiP2 nanosheets are fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method and followed by further phosphating treatment. The W, Ru co-doped NiP2 ultrathin nanosheets exhibits an ultralow overpotentials of 17.8 mV to achieve 10 mA.cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, which is the best Ru-doped hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts so far. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the unique ultrathin nanosheets structure, synergistic effect of the W and Ru elements, and the amorphous carbon layer of the W-Ru/NiP2. More importantly, this design provides a particularly efficient and metal-doped transition metal phosphide with advanced HER performance.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000516818700143

Nowadays, oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions (OER/HER) in water (H2O) electrolysis is important to cost-efficient formation of pure hydrogen (H2) fuel, while oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells are experiencing a sluggish reaction kinetics still when load more quantity of precious metals, like benchmark Pt. Therefore, this study is motivated by a requirement to substitute rare precious metal catalysts by nonprecious metals catalysts (NPMCs) two-dimensional materials (2DMs). The 2DMs have a broad significance due to their nanoand atomic-level applications and some of them with prominent electrical properties, which plays very important role in electrocatalytic applications. The NPMCs 2DMs are more efficient than the conventional precious metals based electrocatalysts, as they present flexible electrode configuration, excellent catalytic activity, and high stability, especially in their composite form. In this review we will explain in detail about the 2D based electrocatalysts; those demonstrate high efficiency, selectivity and sustainability for ORR, OER, and HER. The most important point related to electrocatalytic applications of the 2DMs efficiency enhancement is newly introduced confinement effect, and we will mainly concentrate on 2DMs based confinement effect. The diverse ways for modifying electronic states of the 2D confinement electrocatalysts are emphasized and prospects on confinement catalysis by using 2DMs to energy conversion are given. The perspectives on the relevant areas about further enhancement in their properties will also propos and address. Finally, we will discuss in detail about recent progresses made till now and future predictions about the 2DMs in energy producing devices.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0079-6786	1873-1643		WOS:000621439900001

Furthermore, model experiments have shown that abiogenic flavin conjugated with a polyamino acid matrix, a pigment that photocatalyzes the phosphorylation of ADP to form ATP, could have been present in the prebiotic environment. Indeed, excited flavin molecules play key roles in many photoenzymes and regulatory photoreceptors, and the substantial structural differences between photoreceptor families indicate that evolution has repeatedly used flavins as chromophores for photoreceptor proteins. Some of these photoreceptors are equipped with a light-harvesting antenna, which transfers excitation energy to chemically reactive flavins in the reaction center. The sum of the available data suggests that evolution could have led to the formation of a flavin-based biological converter to convert light energy into energy in the form of ATP.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6				1422-0067		WOS:000314048800037	23271372

The optimally annealed film at 200 degrees C demonstrates substantially better electrocatalytic properties, which can be ascribed to the enhanced electrochemical active surface area and electrical conductivity obtained by improving the intergranular connectivity. In addition, the annealed nanotube film demonstrates highly competitive performance to that of many outstanding electrocatalysts for overall splitting of alkaline water to generate hydrogen as green fuel with the oxygen evolution reaction overpotential of 0.37 V (without iR- compensation) for the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm (-2).

In this paper, the influence of the current density, the type of oxidizer (pure oxygen or air), and a solvent in the electrolyte (DMSO or tetraglyme) on the electrocatalytic properties of PtM/CNT systems (M = Ru, Co, Cr) used as a positive electrode is investigated. It is shown that at a current density of 500 mA/g, more pronounced catalytic effects are observed during the LOB operation than that at 200 mA/g. The obtained results may be explained by the reduced adverse impact of surface passivation with lithium peroxide in the presence of catalysts compared to a similar effect when using unmodified carbon nanotubes (CNT). It is established that the influence of the current density on the catalytic properties continues upon the transition from oxygen to air as an oxidizer. When studying the effect of electrolytes on the catalytic properties of materials subjected to long-term LOB cycling, it is shown that the catalytic effects are most prominent when charged in a tetraglyme medium. Although using a catalyst has practically no effect on the number of cycles for both electrolytes, LOB having tetraglyme exceeds the cyclability of LOB having DMSO.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2313-0105		WOS:000846369300001

Solid discharge products increase the contact resistance and block the electrochemically active electrodes. The resulting high oxidative potentials and formation of Li2CO3 due to electrolyte and carbon electrode decomposition at the positive electrode lead to irreversible deactivation of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) sites. Here we demonstrate a facile strategy for the scalable production of a new electrode structure constituted of vertically aligned carbon nanosheets and metal hydroxide (M(OH)(x)@CNS) hybrid arrays, integrating both favorable ORR and OER active materials to construct bifunctional catalysts for LOBs. Excellent lithium-oxygen battery properties with high specific capacity of 5403 mAh g(-1) and 12123 mAh g(-1) referenced to the carbon and M(OH)(x) weight, respectively, long cyclability, and low charge potentials are achieved in the resulting M(OH)(x)@CNS cathode architecture. The properties are explained by improved O-2/ion transport properties and spatially limited precipitation of Li2O2 nanoparticles inside interstitial cavities resulting in high reversibility. The strategy of creating ORR and OER bifunctional catalysts in a single conductive hybrid component may pave the way to new cathode architectures for Metal air batteries.									25	1	0	0	0	0	25			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000384951800046	27603003

It has an initial discharge capacity of ca. 775 mAh g(-1) with high reversible capacity at a current density of 0.13 mA cm(-2). The Au-Pd NP-supported mesoporous beta-MnO2 cathode catalyst, which enhances the kinetic of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OERs), thereby improves energy and coulombic efficiency of the Li-Air cell.

The resulting N-FWCNTs exhibited a remarkable electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), despite significantly lower nitrogen content than previously reported in literature. The N-FWCNTs performed on par or better than Pt-C in the cathode of an alkaline direct methanol fuel cell, corroborating the ORR activity observed in the electrochemical cell and exhibiting a higher methanol tolerance. Interestingly, N-FWCNTs showed a high activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction and for the hydrogen peroxide decomposition, suggesting that the active sites involved in ORR can simultaneously catalyze other reactions. This unprecedentedly high activity for such a low N-content can be explained by the exceptional accessibility for the catalytic sites located in open and porous N-doped layer surrounding the FWCNT core, along with the minimization of inactive inner volume and mass compared to larger nitrogen doped multiwalled tubes.

A phase change from orthorhombic (x = 0.6) to tetragonal (x = 1.0) in bulk Sm2-xSrxNiO4-delta is confirmed by Rietveld (XRD) analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). To alter the active sites, we fabricated thin films for x = 0.6 and x = 1.0 using a pulsed laser deposition technique. The electrocatalytic behaviour has been studied in an environmentally friendly medium, i.e., a neutral medium (pH = 7), for both bulk and thin films, and parameters such as transient response, electrochemical reversibility and oxygen evolution reactivity are measured. The cyclic voltammetry curves suggest that electrochemical reversibility for thin films is governed by adsorption as opposed to the diffusion observed for bulk samples. Our investigation further suggests that moderate electroactivity can be achieved with an increase in active sites on miniaturization with the phase change.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000758359900001	35188501

In this design, impinging light must pass through the catalyst layer before reaching the photoabsorber(s), and thus optical transmission is an important function of the OER catalyst layer. Many oxide catalysts, such as those containing elements Ni and Co, form oxide or oxyhydroxide phases in alkaline solution at operational potentials that differ from the phases observed in ambient conditions. To characterize the transparency of such catalysts during OER operation, 1031 unique compositions containing the elements Ni, Co, Ce, La, and Fe were prepared by a high throughput inkjet printing technique. The catalytic current of each composition was recorded at an OER overpotential of 0.33 V with simultaneous measurement of the spectral transmission. By combining the optical and catalytic properties, the combined catalyst efficiency was calculated to identify the optimal catalysts for solar fuel applications within the material library. The measurements required development of a new high throughput instrument with integrated electrochemistry and spectroscopy measurements, which enables various spectroelectrochemistry experiments.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000349976100013

Here, we report an efficient electrocatalyst, with NiO/Co3O4 nanoparticles decorated on nitrogen -doped carbon (NiO/Co3O4@ NC). Abundant high -valence Ni3+ and Co3+ species were observed on the surface of the hybrid due to the strong NC-metal oxide and NiO-Co3O4 interactions. This unique structure leads to excellent OER performance, delivering a very low overpotential of 240 mV(&10 mA"cm(-2) on glassy carbon and 200 mV(&10 mA"cm(-2) on Ni foam in KOH and having a turnover frequency (@350 mV overpotential) 6 and 16 times higher than that of IrO, and RuO2, respectively.									167	5	0	0	6	0	166			2380-8195			WOS:000410600500033

However, the slow kinetics of OER seriously limits the overall performance and commercialization. Here, we rationally design a metallic Ni2P/Fe2P interface, which can be in situ oxidized to a Ni2P(O)/Fe2P(O) interface to enhance OER efficiency, with active doped oxyhydroxides and phosphates on the surface and conductive phosphide in the bulk. The resulting catalysts require a low overpotential of 179 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) (without iR compensation) and can continuously drive OER for 120 h without any obvious degradation, which rivals most reported OER catalysts. These results suggest that we are able to design multicomponent metallic precatalysts to construct most active surface layers and conductive bulks, further boosting OER performance for real-world electrolysis utilization.									131	5	0	0	6	0	131			2380-8195			WOS:000415914200009

Combined high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirmed the presence of coordination environments such as Co2+ in disordered prisms and Co4+/Mn4+ in face-shared octahedra. The influence of cobalt and manganese coordination on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and oxide stability in alkaline solution was studied. Under cycling, the surface of perovskites that consists of Co2+ in prisms was amorphized and the activity was similar to that of LaCoO3, which has a stable surface composed of Co3+ in octahedral coordination. These findings highlight the critical role of the electronic structure of transition metal oxides on the OER activity and stability.									88	2	0	0	9	0	89			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000328529800007

In particular, lithium nitrate (LiNO3) was noted as a promising salt for Li-O-2 batteries because of its catalytic effect during the charge process. Nevertheless, the effect of LiNO3 concentration on the capability and electrochemical response of the cathode in Li-O-2 batteries is not entirely understood. Here, the correlation between the performance of the batteries and the concentration of LiNO3 in electrolytes is studied, including the formation of Li2O2 and the decomposition of electrolytes in the discharge and charge processes. We show that a high concentration of LiNO3 leads to a lower overpotential due to the catalytic effect of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the charging process, which suppresses the decomposition of electrolytes. Using the XANES and SEM observation, we also found that the growth of Li2O2 during the discharge process is related to the concentration of LiNO3. This result indicated that highly concentrated LiNO3 salt in an electrolyte not only boosts the cell performance of Li-O-2 batteries but also possibly the safety and performance of the Li-O-2 cell.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000479056700009

ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				797	2					83	10.1088/0004-637X/797/2/83				DEC 20 2014	2014	In the ONeMg cores of 8.8-9.5M(circle dot) stars, neon and oxygen burning is ignited off-center. Whether or not the neon-oxygen flame propagates to the center is critical for determining whether these stars undergo Fe core collapse or electron-capture-induced ONeMg core collapse. We present more details of stars that ignite neon and oxygen burning off-center. The neon flame is established in a manner similar to the carbon flame of super-AGB stars, albeit with a narrower flame width. The criteria for establishing a flame can be met if the strict Schwarzschild criterion for convective instability is adopted. Mixing across the interface of the convective shell disrupts the conditions for the propagation of the burning front, and instead the shell burns as a series of inward-moving flashes. While this may not directly affect whether or not the burning will reach the center (as in super-AGB stars), the core is allowed to contract between each shell flash. Reduction of the electron fraction in the shell reduces the Chandrasekhar mass and the center reaches the threshold density for the URCA process to activate and steer the remaining evolution of the core. This highlights the importance of a more accurate treatment of mixing in the stellar interior for yet another important question in stellar astrophysics-determining the properties of stellar evolution and supernova progenitors at the boundary between electron capture supernova and iron core-collapse supernova.									37	0	0	0	0	0	37			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000346291600011

However, the mechanism behind its catalytic performance and how to improve its activity are still under debate. In the work, we propose that strain engineering is an effective and simple way to achieve the purpose. Based on density functional theory (DFT), we investigate the effects of strain engineering on the electronic structure and catalytic performance of two-dimensional (2D) CoOOH and the underlying mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We find that strain engineering is effective to tailor the electronic configuration of Co3+ ions in CoOOH, which can be transferred from low spin (LS: t6) to high spin (HS: t4) at a tension of 9%. Importantly, we show that LS CoOOH is a poor OER catalyst, because it is ineffective for O2 release with a large energy (1.35 eV). However, HS CoOOH is much more active in the OER because of smaller O2 release energy (0.03 eV) and more effective O-O bond coupling (1.21 eV) in the intramolecular oxygen coupling mechanism. The overpotential for LS CoOOH is 0.66 V according to the hydroxide ion attack mechanism, while the direct intramolecular coupling is hard to occur. HS CoOOH shows low overpotentials, 0.32 and 0.5 V, for the intramolecular coupling and hydroxide ion attack, respectively, which are comparable to those of the best OER catalysts (0.25 to 0.4 V). Our work demonstrates that the spin state transition of Co3+ ions tuned by strain engineering is an effective way to improve the OER activity of 2D CoOOH.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000674754800001

Herein, we develop a novel hollow urchin-like CoSe2 using urchin-like Co(OH)(2) as template. The as-prepared CoSe2 was treated at 300 C. It displays low overpotential of 285 mV at the 10 mA.cm(-2) current density, which is much lower than that of the treated flake CoSe2 and untreated hollow urchin-like CoSe2. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves clearly demonstrated that the lager electrochemical active surface area of the CoSe2 is attribute to the hollow urchin-like structure and the increase of the active site by heat treatment. Moreover, the heat treatment increases the number of antibonding orbitals of Co-Se, which is close to the ideal filling for OER. Therefore, the synergistic effect of the increased electrochemical active surface area and optimized electronic configuration enhances electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst. These results demonstrate the potential of hollow urchin-like CoSe2 in the field of energy conversion and storage technologies, and open up a novel avenue to design of high surface area catalysts with excellent performance and durability as alternatives to the noble metal oxides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1387-7003	1879-0259		WOS:000861039200001

Herein, a Co(II) ion-driven self-assembly strategy is described for the synthesis of cobalt-based nanostructured transition metal compounds (Co-NTMCs) embedded in nitrogen and sulfur codoped hierarchical porous carbon submicrospheres (Co-NTMCs@NSC), where condensation of thiourea-ethylenediamine-formaldehyde resin (TEFR) is induced by Co(II) ions which is simultaneously assembled with polydopamine to form a multifunctional precursor through coordinated interaction. The resulting Co-NTMCs@NSC sample comprises abundant hierarchical porous textures, a high content of active cobalt species including the nanoparticles of Co, Co3O4 and amorphous CoSx, and a considerable amount of defective structures. These characteristics lead to remarkable oxygen electrocatalytic activities, with a half-wave potential of +0.833 V vs. RHE, which is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and a lower overpotential of 284 mV than RuO2 at 10 mA.cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Furthermore, its operational stability is also much higher than that of commercial RuO2 and Pt/C catalysts. When used as a breathing air electrode for Zn-air batteries, Co-NTMCs@NSC shows a higher open-circuit voltage (1.509 V), higher discharge power density (262 mW cm(-2)) and better charge-discharge reversibility than commercial Pt/C. The results from the present work suggest that controlled assembly of functional polymers may be exploited for the preparation of doped carbon/metal nanoparticle nanocomposites as viable, high-performance catalysts for electrochemical energy technologies.									24	2	0	0	0	0	25			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000503282100023	31670323

In the current work, we report a simple conjugation of BiOX with manganese because of their excellent electrical and optical properties. Mn-BiOX displays an average specific capacity of 220.8 mA h g(-1) (2291.35 F g(-1)) in 2 M KOH electrolyte solution at current densities of 0.4-2.4 mA cm(-2); additionally, it facilitates an efficient oxygen evolution reaction at an overpotential of 160 mV attributed to the synergistic effects, high surface accessibility, and excellent electronic conductivity. A capacitance retention of 86% is observed over 10 000 charging-discharging cycles at a current density of 2.4 mA cm(-2), demonstrating the exceptional stability of the synthesized material. The enhanced electrocatalytic activities are due to superior surface roughness paving the way for the intercalation of ions on the electrode surface, which is proven via atomic force microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. These activities hold the merits of delivering high capacitance and catalytic performance suitable for advanced high energy storage applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2052-1553			WOS:000587892200009

Previous work demonstrated that alteration of an arginine residue occurring at position 305 to serine produced a strain (R305S) with altered PSII activity (Knoepfle, N., Bricker, T. M., and Putnam-Evans, C. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 1582-1588). This strain grew at wild-type rates in complete BG-11 media (480 muM chloride) and evolved oxygen at rates that were 60-70% of the observed wildtype rates. The R305S strain assembled approximately 70-80% of the functional PSII centers contained in the control strain, and these PSII centers were very sensitive to photoinactivation at high light intensities. We recently observed that the R305S mutant exhibited a pronounced chloride effect. When this mutant was grown in media depleted of chloride (30 muM chloride), it exhibited a severely reduced photoautotrophic growth rate. The effect of chloride depletion on the growth rate of the mutant was reversed by the addition of 480 muM bromide to the chloride-depleted BG-11 media. Oxygen evolution rates for the mutant were further depressed to about 22% of that observed in control cells under chloride-limiting conditions. Addition of bromide restored these rates to those observed under chloride-sufficient conditions. The mutant exhibited a significantly lower relative quantum yield for oxygen evolution than did the control strain, and this was exacerbated under chloride-limiting conditions. Fluorescence yield measurements indicated that both the mutant and the control strains assembled fewer PSII reaction centers under chloride-limiting conditions. The reaction centers assembled by the mutant exhibited an enhanced sensitivity to photoinactivation under chloride-limiting conditions, with a t(1/2) of photoinactivation of 2.6 min under chloride-limiting conditions as compared to a t(1/2) of 4.7 min under normal growth conditions. The mutant also exhibited an enhanced stability of its S-2 state and increased number of centers in the S, state following dark incubation. These results indicate that the mutant R305S exhibits a defect in its ability to utilize chloride in support of efficient oxygen evolution in PSII. This is the first mutant of this type described in the CP43 protein.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			0006-2960			WOS:000180171800031	12501203

A molecular iron-nitrogen coordinated carbon nanofiber is developed, which is supported on an electrochemically exfoliated graphene (FeN4/NF/EG) electrocatalyst through carbonizing the precursor composed of iron ions absorbed on polyaniline-electrodeposited EG. Benefitting from the unique 3D structure, the FeN4/NF/EG hybrid exhibits a low overpotential of approximate to 294 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER in acidic electrolyte, which is much lower than that of commercial Ir/C catalysts (320 mV) as well as all previously reported acid transitional metal-derived OER electrocatalysts. X-ray absorption spectroscopy coupled with a designed poisoning experiment reveals that the molecular Fe-N-4 species are identified as active centers for the OER in acid. The first-principles-based calculations verify that the Fe-N-4-doped carbon structure is capable of reducing the potential barriers and boosting the electrocatalytic OER activity in acid.									172	16	0	0	9	0	173			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000444537800028

The as-prepared frameworks exhibited boosted electrocatalytic activity, improved stability and enhanced tolerance toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) in alkaline media in contrast with commercial Pt black catalyst. The developed method provides novel strategy for preparing other shape-controlled nanocatalysts with superior catalytic activity and durability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Here, a facile interface engineering strategy is reported to fabricate electron-rich NiFe layer double hydroxide (LDH) by interfacing with conductive polyaniline (PANI) for significantly improving the OER activity. Experimental and theoretical investigations unveil that the unique electron-rich states of active metal sites in NiFe LDH via the strong interfacial coupling effect can optimize the adsorption free energy of reactive oxygenated intermediates. Remarkably, the electron-rich NiFe LDH electrocatalysts exhibit outstanding OER performance with a low overpotential of 220 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, a small Tafel slope of 44 mV dec-1, and good stability.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000697269300003

The intercalated nanosized iron oxide was Fe2O3, which exhibited a high electron deficiency. Unlike in a previous report, Fe2O3-intercalated layered compounds did not produce hydrogen from an aqueous methanol solution in a photocatalytic manner under visible light. Instead, the material produced a stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen and oxygen photocatalytically under UV irradiation and produced oxygen from an aqueous AgNO3 solution photocatalytically under visible light.

These were applied to thylakoid membranes of the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, Used were five non-ionic detergents with one ionic and one zwitterionic for comparison. To compare the suitability and efficiency of the detergents the following properties of the extracts were examined: maximum rate of oxygen evolution with various electron accepters, the relative variable fluorescence (F-V/F-M), the contamination of the extract with photosystem (PS) 1, and the status of the electron acceptor side of PS2 reaction centre, None of the detergents yielded a highly selective extraction of the PS2 complexes (negligible contamination with PS1) which would simultaneously display a high photochemical activity and high structural intactness. Heptylthioglucoside and dodecylmaltoside yielded the nearest approximation to the optimum result. Kinetic fluorometry was applied here for the first time to characterize the functional and structural properties of PS2 particles from cyanobacteria.					2nd Regional Photosynthesis Workshop on Chlorophyll Fluorescence - Emotions and Reason2nd Regional Photosynthesis Workshop on Chlorophyll Fluorescence - Emotions and Reason	JAN 31-FEB 03, 1999JAN 31-FEB 03, 1999	Natl Res Ctr Photosynthesis & Global Climate Change; Inst Microbiol; Acad Sci Czech Republ; TrebonNatl Res Ctr Photosynthesis & Global Climate Change; Inst Microbiol; Acad Sci Czech Republ; Trebon	LIPNO, CZECH REPUBLICLIPNO, CZECH REPUBLIC	14	0	0	0	11	0	14			0300-3604			WOS:000085348900003

However, achieving full water splitting catalysis in acidic electrolytes is still an urgent task due to the lack of efficient, abundant and acid-stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. This rationally designed MoSe2 nanosheet/MoO2 nanobelt/carbon nanotube membrane (MoSe2 NS/MoO2 NB/CNT-M) is composed of highly conductive CNTs and hierarchical MoSe2 nanosheets on MoO2 nanobelts, and due to its flexible three-dimensional (3D) electrodes, possesses an open architecture for rapid ion/electron diffusion, maximising the exposure of its active sites. The MoSe2 NS/MoO2 NB/CNT-M achieved remarkable electrocatalytic performance for the HER, providing a geometrical current density of 1 mA cm(-2) at an onset potential of -23 mV vs. RHE, a small Tafel slope (69.4 mV dec(-1)) and excellent long-cycle stability in 0.5 M H2SO4. More importantly, the obtained multifunctional electrodes delivered excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the OER under acidic conditions, with a very small onset potential (approximate to 1.43 V vs. RHE) and enhanced long-cycle durability. The two-electrode electrolyzer, composed of a MoSe2 NS/MoO2 NB/CNT-M both as an anode and a cathode, required a small voltage of 1.63 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and improved electrocatalytic durability, which was better than that of an electrolyzer composed of RuO2//20 wt% Pt/C. This work highlights the potential for active and abundant non-precious catalysts for full water splitting in acidic electrolytes.									44	0	0	0	0	0	44			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000437007700038	29736512

Kharkats and Volkov [Yu.I. Kharkats, A.G. Volkov, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 891 (1987) 56] were the first to present proof that cytochrome c oxidase reduces molecular oxygen by synchronous multielectron mechanism without O-2(-) intermediate formation. After this pioneering observation, it became clear that the first step of oxygen reduction is two-electron concerted process. The energy for the W-pump of cytochrome oxidase is liberated when the third and fourth electrons are added in the last two steps of water formation independent of the reaction pathway. Electrochemical principles govern many biological properties of organisms, such as the generation of electric fields, and the conduction of fast excitation waves. These properties are supported by the function of a variety of natural nanodevices. Ionic channels, as natural nanodevices, control the plasma membrane potential, and the movement of ions across membranes; thereby, regulating various biological functions. Some voltage-gated ion channels work as plasma membrane nanopotentiostats. In plants, excitation waves are possible mechanisms for intercellular and intracellular communication in response to environmental changes. The role of electrified nanointerface of the plasma membrane in signal transduction is discussed as well. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report a facile hydrothermal synthesis of flower-like nanostructured molybdenum sulphide and its incorporation on to graphene as a potential oxygen reduction reaction catalyst in alkaline medium. The phase purity and morphological evolution of MoS2 is systematically studied through X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopic techniques. The electronic states of metal and non-metallic species are deeply studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The effect of annealing temperatures and TMC concentrations are also investigated by electrochemical techniques such as cyclic and linear sweep voltammograms. The optimised electrocatalyst (MoS2/G-500) delivers significant ORR activity with onset and half-wave potentials of 0.91 and 0.80 V (vs. RHE), respectively. Superior durability compared to state-of-art Pt/C catalyst is ascertained by repeating potential cycles for about 5000 times and also by chronoamperometric technique. Finally, the hybrid catalyst is evaluated in AEMFC as cathode catalyst which delivers peak power density of about 29 mW cm(-2) under ambient temperature and pressure.

In this work, LaCo0.6Ni0.4O3-delta (LCN) is employed as the contact material and the electrode for the symmetrical SOC and exhibits good catalytic activities towards the four typical reactions, i.e., oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The LCN-GDC electrode has the low activation energies of 1.18 and 0.55 eV as the cathode and anode of SOFC, respectively. High peak power densities (PPDs) of 1.896 and 0.562 W cm(-2) are obtained at 800 degrees C for the Ni-YSZ (8 mol.% Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2) anode-supported and YSZ (200 mu m)-supported symmetrical SOFCs, respectively. An electrolysis current density (ECD) of 2.316 A cm(-2) is obtained at 800 degrees C and 2.0 V and a robust operation for over 120 h with a degradation rate of about 0.5 mV h(-1) is achieved with LCN as the current collector in air side at 750 degrees C for the symmetrical SOECs. Such a multi-functional material shows attractive competitiveness and successfully achieves fivefold applications in SOCs.

Herein, a novel FeS-decorated three-dimensional hierarchical porous N, S co-doped carbon catalyst is derived from silica based ionogel, of which 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([EMIm][TfO]) acts as source of N and S, and porous silica framework, in suit originated from silicane by sol-gel process, acts as a template to get a large specific surface area (987.5m(2) g(-1)). The obtained catalyst shows excellent ORR activity in 0.1M KOH (positively shifted half-wave potential of 0.87 V), high selectivity (electron-transfer number of 3.99), remarkable stability (only 3mV negative shift of half-wave potential after 5000 potential cycles) and perfect methanol-tolerance effect. The remarkable electrochemical performance of the obtained catalyst is mainly attributed to the well-controlled hierarchical porous structure and homogeneous distribution of highly active sites (N, S-dual-doped carbon, Fe-Nx and/or FeS).

Despite that great progress has been achieved, biomimetic synthesis of metal phosphates@nanocarbon core shell nanohybrids remains a challenge, and their use for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has not been explored. In this paper, novel nanohybrids composed of coralloid Co2P2O7 nanocrystal cores and thin porous, nano carbon shells are synthesized by combination of the structural merits of supramolecular polymer gels and a controllable thermal conversion technique, i.e., temperature programmable annealing of presynthesized supramolecular polymer gels that contain cobalt salt and phytic acid under a proper gas atmosphere. Electrocatalytic tests in alkaline solution show that such nanohybrids exhibit greatly enhanced electrocatalytic OER performance compared with that of Co2P2O7 nanostructure. At a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), their overpotential is 0.397 V, which is much lower than that of Co2P2O7 nanostructures, amorphous Co-Pi nanomaterials, Co(PO3)(2) nanosheets, Pt/C, and some reported OER catalysts, and close to that of commercial IrO2. Most importantly, both of their current density at the overpotential over 0.40 V and durability are superior to those of IrO2 catalyst. As revealed by a series of spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses, their enhanced electrocatalytic performance results from the presence of thin porous nanocarbon shells, which not only improve interfacial electron penetration or transfer dynamics but also vary the coordination environment and increase the number of active 5-coordinated Co2+ sites in Co2P2O7 cores.									69	2	0	0	1	0	69			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000382514100084	27500553

In this study, sulfur-incorporated cobalt-iron (oxy)hydroxide (S-(Co,Fe)OOH) nanosheets were directly grown on commercial iron foam via galvanic corrosion and hydrothermal methods. The incorporation of sulfur into (Co,Fe)OOH results in superior catalytic performance and high stability in both the HER and OER conducted in 1 M KOH. The incorporation of sulfur enhanced the electrocatalytic activity by modifying the electronic structure and chemical states of (Co,Fe)OOH. An alkaline water electrolyzer for overall water splitting was fabricated using a two-electrode configuration utilizing the S-(Co,Fe)OOH bifunctional electrocatalyst in both the HER and OER. The fabricated electrolyzer outperformed a precious metal-based electrolyzer using Pt/C as the HER electrocatalyst and IrO2 as the OER electrocatalyst, which are the benchmark catalysts. This electrolyzer provides a lower potential of 1.641 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and maintains 98.4% of its performance after 50 h of durability testing. In addition, the S-(Co,Fe)OOH-based electrolyzer successfully generated hydrogen under natural illumination upon its combination with a commercial silicon solar cell and exhibited a solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiency of up to 13.0%. This study shows that S-(Co,Fe)OOH is a promising candidate for application in the future renewable energy industry due to its high cost-effectiveness, activity, and stability during overall water splitting. In addition, the combination of a commercial silicon solar cell with an alkaline water electrolyzer has great potential for the production of hydrogen.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2516-0230			WOS:000703039000001	36133497

Herein, a highly porous Ni-P (HP Ni-P) electrode, prepared by an ultrafast electrodeposition within only ten seconds, is presented with superior electrocatalytic activity towards both HER and OER in alkaline media: overpotentials of 96 and 323 mV are required to reach a current density level of 100 mA cm(-2)for HER and OER, respectively, with corresponding Tafel slopes of 32.9 and 44.0 mV dec(-1). Experimental analyses and theoretical calculations show that charge transfer occurs from Ni to P and the HER kinetics is accelerated by the increased hydrogen coverage, enhanced water dissociation ability, and optimized hydrogen adsorption energy on the HP Ni-P. Under OER conditions, surface P is oxidized into PO43-, promoting oxidation of Ni to OER-active NiOOH and exposing abundant OER-active sites on the HP Ni-P surface. An alkaline electrolysis cell was constructed with HP Ni-P as the cathode and anode (Ni-P||Ni-P) and outperformed the Pt/C||IrO(2)cell at cell voltages exceeding 1.68 V. This work provides a practically applicable method to prepare HER and OER electrodes for use in industrial water electrolyzers, with insight into the activities of the catalysts.									33	2	0	0	2	0	34			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000542473000014

The nucleation and decomposition processes of Li2O2 are elucidated. Both of the charge transfer and electronic hybridization between TM 3d and O-2p orbitals influence the adsorption energies of key intermediates LixOy on the TM-N-4 doped graphene surface. A greater adsorption energy usually corresponds to a greater TM atomic number. The adsorption energies of LiO2, Li3O4 and Li4O4 are the linear functions of the adsorption energy of Li2O2. The initial ORR processes on the Mn-N4, Fe-N4, Co-N4 doped graphene surfaces follow the two-electron reaction pathway, while the initial ORR processes on the Ni-N4 and Cu-N-4 doped graphene surfaces might follow both of the two-electron and four-electron reaction pathways. The Co-N-4 doped graphene possesses the overpotentials of 0.69 V for ORR and 0.92 V for OER, showing the optimal catalytic activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000805429700002

However, the mechanisms for ORR are generally poorly understood. Here, we report an extensive experimental and first-principles theoretical study of the ORR at nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NrGO). We synthesize three distinct NrGO catalysts and investigate their chemical and structural properties in detail via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared and Raman spectroscopies, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and thin-film electrical conductivity. ORR experiments include the pH dependences of 2e(-) versus 4e(-) ORR selectivity, ORR onset potentials, Tafel slopes, and H/D kinetic isotope effects. These experiments show very different ORR behavior for the three catalysts, in terms of both selectivity and the underlying mechanism, which proceeds either via coupled proton-electron transfers (CPETs) or non-CPETs. Reasonable structural models developed from density functional theory rationalize this behavior. The key determinant between CPET vs non-CPET mechanisms is the electron density at the Fermi level under operating ORR conditions. Regardless of the reaction mechanism or electrolyte pH, however, we identify the ORR active sites as sp(2) carbons that are located next to oxide regions. This assignment highlights the importance of oxygen functional groups, while details of (modest) N-doping may still affect the overall catalytic activity, and likely also the selectivity, by modifying the general chemical environment around the active site.									94	7	0	0	4	1	96			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100093

In this work, Co-Pi was electrochemically deposited onto CuWO4 nanoflakes (NFs) via a cyclic voltammetry (CV) method to enhance the photocatalytic performance of CuWO4 toward PEC water splitting. The results demonstrated that the photocurrent density as well as the charge-transfer efficiency was improved within the entire potential range. Besides, the CuWO4/Co-Pi exhibited an enhanced stability over the bare CuWO4 in the phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) and an extremely high Faradaic efficiency (ca. 96%). Our work reveals that combination of CuWO4 with Co-Pi is a feasible way to further enhance the performance of CuWO4 photoanode toward PEC OER.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1452-3981			WOS:000483307100054		
J	Machado, SAS; Gallani, SC								Development and characterisation of coatings of Ni-Co and their mixed oxides for oxygen production by alkaline water electrolysis.								QUIMICA NOVA				20	6			621	626						NOV-DEC 1997	1997	This paper describes the development and characterisation of Ni-Co coatings to be used as anodes in water electrolysis. Chemical oxidation of the surface was performed through thermal treatment at 400 degrees C for 10 h. The resulting surfaces were analysed by X-ray diffraction, EDX, SEM, cyclic voltammetry and constant current electrolysis. The electrochemical oxidation occurring on bare surfaces during electrolysis promotes the formation of thick oxide layers resulting in loss of activity. In oxidised surfaces the chemical Ni-Co oxide grown during the thermal treatment prevents further oxidation thus retaining their activity towards oxygen evolution. An optimum condition for the growth of mixed oxide with high activity was found for the bath containing 50 g L-1 CoSO4.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0100-4042			WOS:A1997YH80900008

Herein, we use a 1D/2D hybrid strategy to synthesize a Co, Ncodoped carbon nanotube (CNT)/graphene heterostructure bifunctional catalyst (Co/NCNT/NG). The Co/NCNT/NG heterostructure catalyst shows not only a positive half-wave potential of 0.85 V (versus RHE) and long-term stability for the ORR, but also a low overpotential of 123 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and ultrahigh stability in 0.5 M H2SO4 for the HER. The superior performance of the Co/NCNT/NG catalyst is attributed to the inimitable 1D/2D CNT/graphene heterostructure, in which 1D and 2D structures provide different catalytically active sites (including metallic Co, CoN2 and N-C) for the HER and ORR, respectively. Moreover, the catalyst also exhibits similar discharge performance and robust durability as an air electrode in Zn-air batteries to the Pt-based one. This work provides a new approach for the in situ synthesis of bifunctional and multifunctional catalysts by integrating 1D/2D/3D materials with different catalytically active sites into one heterostructure.									106	5	0	0	3	0	107			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000426704100014

Fabrication of oxygen vacancies (OVs) is effective to improve the photocatalytic activity of Bi4O5Br2 . However, OVs are instable and easy to deactivate during continuous photocatalytic process. In this paper, Bi(4)O(5)Br(2 )modified by metal Bi and OVs (Bi-OVs-Bi4O5Br2) have been prepared to improve the stability of OVs and the photocatalytic activity in H2 evolution. Bi-OVs-Bi(4)O(5)Br(2 )exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity with a H2 evolution rate of 67.9 mu molmiddotg-1middoth-1, which was 2.1 times higher than that of pure Bi4O5Br2. The enhancement may be attributed to the narrowed band gap, facilitated separation of photogenerated charge carriers, increased adsorption sites for H2O and reduced H2 adsorption energy on the surface of Bi4O5Br2. Notably, the metal Bi could act as reactive sites to activate H2O, so as to avoid OVs to be filled with H2O. As a result, Bi-OVs-Bi(4)O(5)Br(2 )exhibited high photocatalytic stability in continuous test. Results from this study clarified the intrinsic functionality of metal Bi and OVs in Bi(4)O(5)Br(2 )and provided new insights into rational design of highly-efficient Bi-based photocatalyst.

Herein, we adopted microwave-assisted synthesis to design a multifunctional graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) decorated BiVO4/Ag2CO3 (BVG@C) hierarchical ternary nanocomposite for sensing and water splitting applications. The morphological, structural and elemental characterizations demonstrate the successful decoration of carbon nitride on the composite surface. The electrochemical activity of BVG@C modified glassy carbon electrode reveals excellent redox behaviour towards simultaneous detection of 4-Nitrophenol (4-NP) and 4-Nitroaniline (PNA). The modified electrode shows rapid amperometric current response with high sensitivity of 2.368 mu A mM cm(-2) and 1.534 mA mM cm(-2) and low detection limit of 0.012 mu mol L-1 and 0.028 mu mol L-1, respectively for 4-NP and PNA. Moreover, the modified electrode was further investigated for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions and the electrocatalytic results show admirable activity and good stability for oxygen evolution with very low overpotential of 136 mV in alkaline medium. It is worthwhile to mention that the excellent activity of electrocatalyst can be ascribed to the decoration and electronic interaction of g-C3N4 with the BiVO4/Ag2CO3 nanocomposite, increasing its surface area, active sites, charge transfer and decreasing resistance.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0039-9140	1873-3573		WOS:000759239600006	35114490

The method of choice was linear sweep voltammetry (measurement of the anodic peak current) for the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple and steady-state polarization (determination of the exchange current) for the O-2 and Cl-2 evolution reactions. The results have shown that the effectiveness factor depends strongly on the kinetics of the investigated redox reaction. For the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple, effectiveness factors close to zero (max 4%) have been obtained contrary to the O-2 evolution reaction where effectiveness factors close to 100% can be achieved, all being independent of IrO2 loading. For the Cl-2 evolution reaction, intermediate values of the effectiveness factor have been found and they decrease strongly, from 100% down to about 60%, with increasing loading.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			0021-891X			WOS:000271766000022

Here, we report an effective strategy to design a novel type of callistemon-like Zn and S codoped CoP nanorod clusters by introducing both Zn and S into cobalt phosphide, thereby creating electrocatalysts for highly efficient and stable neutral water splitting. The best Zn and S codoped CoP nanorod clusters on carbon paper (Zn,S-CoP NRCs/CP) require overpotential values of 67 and 391 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M phosphate-buffered solution, respectively. Remarkably, this enables a neutral electrolyzer to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.70 V, which is superior to those afforded by the Pt/C/CP||IrO2/CP couple and most of the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Impressively, this electrolyzer can be powered by an AA battery (similar to 1.5 V). Density functional theory computations and systematic experiments have verified that the improved HER and OER activities originate from the optimized electronic structures that can facilitate the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen intermediates after introducing Zn and S and accelerating the formation of oxygenated intermediates on CoOOH, respectively. This work provides a new strategy to boost the performance of transition metal phosphides for neutral water or seawater splitting.									48	4	0	0	5	0	48			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000489727600029

They also provide an entertaining and educational means to experimentally verify nonlinear acoustical theory as described by the Earnshaw solution to the lossless Burgers equation and weak-shock theory. This article describes the theory, the demonstration, and the results of a propagation experiment carried out to provide typical results. Data analysis shows that an acetylene-oxygen balloon produces an acoustic shock whose evolution agrees well with weak-shock theory. On the other hand, the pressure wave generated by a hydrogen-oxygen balloon also propagates nonlinearly, but does not approach N-wave-like, weak-shock formation over the propagation distance.

By exploring the effects of oxygen (O2) and pH on the photocatalytic activity of the Zscheme photocatalytic system, it was found that O2 and alkalinity are necessary for photocatalytic HCHO degradation and H2 production. O2 can boost the oxidation conversion of HCHO into formic acid (HCOOH) and restrain the HCHO polymerization reaction, therefore accelerate the formation of H2 in the reaction system. With the increase of pH value from 4 to 13, the reducibility of HCHO and the electronegativity of catalyst increase, which makes the activity of catalyst system increase. The results provide a new route for the optimization of reaction conditions for simultaneous photocatalytic H2 production and HCHO degradation. Under the optimal conditions (80% of O2, 13 of pH and 1.5 mol center dot L-1 of HCHO initial concentration), the best H2 production activity and HCHO degradation activity are 2724.89 mu mol center dot h-1 and 17.00 mmol center dot h-1, respectively. On this basis, the possible pathway and mechanism of photocatalytic H2 production and simultaneous HCHO degradation were proposed, which shed lights on elucidating the reaction path and underlying mechanism for photocatalytic H2 production and pollutant degradation.									28	1	0	0	5	0	28			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000683030600002

A drop tube furnace was explored. Besides, the effect of the oxygen-containing functional group on the generation characteristics of NO emission was also investigated. The results showed that CH2/CH3 is highly influenced by the process and atmosphere of coal combustion. The burning of coal increases the contents of aromatic hydrogen and aromaticity on the surface of coal char particles, and it decreases the content of lipid hydrogen. The oxygen concentration exhibits a significant effect on the oxygen-containing functional groups in coal char, which promotes the reduction reaction of NO. There is an optimum oxygen concentration of 30% that creates the best NO reduction effect caused by the oxygen-containing functional groups.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1932-2135	1932-2143		WOS:000430461500006

The oxidation of Mn(II) to Mn(III/IV) oxides has been primarily attributed to biological processes, due in part to the faster rates of bacterial Mn(II) oxidation compared to observed mineral-induced and other abiotic rates. Here we explore the reactivity of biogenic Mn oxides formed by a common marine bacterium (Roseobacter sp. AzwK-3b), which has been previously shown to oxidize Mn(II) via the production of extracellular superoxide. Oxidation of Mn(II) by superoxide results in the formation of highly reactive colloidal birnessite with hexagonal symmetry. The colloidal oxides induce the rapid oxidation of Mn(II), with dramatically accelerated rates in the presence of organics, presumably due to mineral surface-catalyzed organic radical generation. Mn(II) oxidation by the colloids is further accelerated in presence of both organics and light, implicating reactive oxygen species in aiding abiotic oxidation. Indeed, the enhancement of Mn(II) oxidation is negated when the colloids are reacted with Mn(II) in the presence of superoxide dismutase, an enzyme that scavenges the reactive oxygen species (ROS) superoxide. The reactivity of the colloidal phase is short-lived due to the rapid evolution of the birnessite from hexagonal to pseudo-orthogonal symmetry. The secondary particulate triclinic birnessite phase exhibits a distinct lack of Mn(II) oxidation and subsequent Mn oxide formation. Thus, the evolution of initial reactive hexagonal birnessite to non-reactive triclinic birnessite imposes the need for continuous production of new colloidal hexagonal particles for Mn(II) oxidation to be sustained, illustrating an intimate dependency of enzymatic and mineral-based reactions in Mn(II) oxidation. Further, the coupled enzymatic and mineral-induced pathways are linked such that enzymatic formation of Mn oxide is requisite for the mineral-induced pathway to occur. Here, we show that Mn(II) oxidation involves a complex network of abiotic and biotic processes, including enzymatically produced superoxide, mineral catalysis, organic reactions with mineral surfaces, and likely photo-production of ROS. The complexity of coupled reactions involved in Mn(II) oxidation here highlights the need for further investigations of microbially-mediated Mn oxide formation, including identifying the role of Mn oxide surfaces, organics, reactive oxygen species, and light in Mn(II) oxidation and Mn oxide phase evolution.

Water splitting, which can achieve sustainable hydrogen production, is a favorable strategy due to the abundance of water resources. Splitting of water includes two half reactions integral to its operation: hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, its practical application is mainly impeded by the sluggish anode reaction. Simultaneously, noble metal oxides (IrO2 and RuO2) and Pt-based catalysts have been recognized as typical OER catalysts; however, the scarcity of noble metals greatly limits their development. Hence, designing an alternative electrocatalyst plays a vital role in the development of OER. However, exploring a highly active electrocatalyst for OER is still difficult. Herein, a miraculous construction of a tree-like array of NiS/Ni3S2 heterostructure, which is directly grown on Ni foam substrate, is synthesized via one-step hydrothermal process. Since NiS and Ni3S2 have shown great OER performance in previous investigations, this novel NiS-Ni3S2/Nikel foam (NF) heterostructure array has tremendous potential as a practical OER catalyst. Upon application in OER, the NiS-Ni3S2/NF heterostructure array catalyst exhibits excellent activity and stability. More specifically, this novel tree-like NiS-Ni3S2 heterostructure array shows extremely low overpotential (269 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mAcm(-2)) and small Tafel slope for OER. It also shows extraordinary stability in alkaline electrolytes. Compared with the Ni3S2 nanorods array, the NiS-Ni3S2 heterostructure array has a synergistic effect that can improve the OER performance. Due to the secondary structure (Ni3S2 nanosheets), the tree-like NiS-Ni3S2 array provides more active sites could have higher specific surface area. The greater activity of the NiS/Ni3S2 heterostructure may also stem from the tight conjunction between tree-like NiS/Ni3S2 and the Ni foam substrate, which is beneficial for electronic transmission. Hydroxy groups can accumulate in large amounts on the surface of the tree-like array, and it also generates some Ni-based oxides that are favorable to OER. Moreover, the synergistic effect of such heterostructure can intrinsically improve the OER activity. The unique tree-like NiS-Ni3S2 heterostructure array has great potential as an alternative OER electrocatalyst.									13	6	0	0	1	0	15			1000-6818			WOS:000439164300015

Herein, a convenient and efficient cation-exchange strategy was developed to prepare flexible and robust Co/V-incorporated bimetallic COF electrocatalysts (namely, CoxV1-x@COF-SO3) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As expected, in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, the optimized bimetallic Co0.5V0.5@COF-SO3 showed high turnover frequency (TOF) (0.098 s(-1)) at the overpotential of 300 mV, which was superior to that of most of the recently reported excellent Co-based OER electrocatalysts, exhibiting high atom utilization efficiency. Most importantly, the flexible nature of Co0.5V0.5@COF-SO3 was also observed. After treatment with hydrochloric acid, the reformation of the catalysis-inert phase of COF-SO3H was observed. This unique transformation from the catalysis-active phase of Co0.5V0.5@COF-SO3 to the catalysis-inert phase of COF-SO3H can be repeated, suggesting reversible switching of OER activity, which are almost impossible to achieve in conventional catalysts. This work provides a new concept for the fundamental design of catalysts with reversible switching properties to improve the atom utilization efficiency and simplify the procedures of catalyst regeneration.									29	3	0	0	0	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526703800008

Replacing noble metal-based electrocatalysts with highly efficient and inexpensive non-noble metal-based oxygen electrocatalysts is critical for the practical applications of these technologies. Here we report a general approach for the synthesis of hollow frameworks of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes derived from metal-organic frameworks, which exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity and stability for oxygen reduction and evolution than commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts. The remarkable electrochemical properties are mainly attributed to the synergistic effect from chemical compositions and the robust hollow structure composed of interconnected crystalline nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes. The presented strategy for controlled design and synthesis of metal-organic framework-derived functional nanomaterials offers prospects in developing highly active electrocatalysts in electrochemical energy devices.									1704	115	0	0	98	0	1720			2058-7546			WOS:000394094100006

The unique NiFe-LDH@Co3O4 core-shell structure was prepared by using NiFe-LDH as metal source, Co3O4 as support matrix and urea-doped nitrogen in LDH. XRD, FTIR, SEM and EDS showed that LDH was successfully grown on the surface of Co3O4, and had typical LDH nanostructure. The voltage output of NiFe-LDH@Co3O4 MFC was maintained at about 0.43 V, with insignificant variations over 8 d, which indicated that NiFeLDH@Co3O4 catalyst has remarkable stability and durability. Moreover, the maximum power density was 467.35 + 8.27 mW/m(2), which was produced by NiFe-LDH@Co3O4. The results implied that the improvement of ORR activity of NiFe-LDH@Co3O4 was due to its high conductivity and abundant active sites, and therefore, the power generation capacity of MFC was improved. The electrode prepared by NiFe-LDH@Co3O4 modified air cathode was a promising material for fuel cell.									41	1	0	0	13	0	42			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000523641800033

The resulting Ni@EGO catalyst was tested for OER in base, where it produced high stability and superior performances. Electron microscopy indicated that Ni@EGO had a uniform morphology, which together with the excellent electronic conductivity of the EGO support, must have contributed to the outstanding OER performance of the catalyst. The Ni@EGO catalyst showed superior OER activity with very low overpotential of 250 mV, which gave rise to the substantial current density of 750 A g(-1) at 1.6 V. Upon performing long term exhaustive galvanostatic stability tests at 10 mA cm(-2), the Ni@EGO was highly stable and it improved over the course of the polarization. During performance studies, significant morphological changes of the material occur within the material as judged by electron microscopy. We believe the notable enhancement of the catalytic activity observed for the system during durability testing could be attributed to electrochemical cleaning of the surface from catalytically inactive nickel aggregates and due to chemical modification of the EGO material by NiOOH species.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000644389300001

Herein, PtMo-CeOx hybrids with interesting ultrathin and ultralong nanowire assemblies (NAs) structure are synthesized by a one-pot solvothermal method without templates. The PtMo-CeOx-NAs catalyst exhibits 5.2-fold, 6.9-fold and 2.4-fold higher mass activity than commercial Pt/C towards the MOR, ORR and HOR simultaneously and shows excellent durability and CO poisoning tolerance. Detailed experiments reveal that the enhancement should be due to strain and ligand effects. Most impressively, when PtMo-CeOx-NAs membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) fabricated by a catalyst-coated method are used both as the anode and cathode in PEMFCs, the performance of fuel cells is dramatically boosted compared to those with Pt/C.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000723019600004

By doping heteroatoms such as Cu, the nanosheets' morphology and dimension can be well-tuned. The prepared heteroatom-doped cobalt hydroxide nano-sheets exhibit excellent catalytic activity and durability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In particular, Cu-doped cobalt hydroxide (Cu-Co(OH)(2)) shows an electrocatalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a mass activity of 46 A g(-1) at the overpotential of 300 mV, and a TafeI slope of 47 mV dec(-1), which are markedly higher than those of the state-of-the-art IrO2. Importantly, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggests the modulated electronic structure by the heteroatom doping, which implies that Co ions are more positively charged than the normal 2+ and is thus in favor of the OER performance. This work presents a green and facile strategy for the synthesis of heteroatom in situ doped uItrathin hydroxides which show excellent performance for the OER. A possible OER mechanism of this heteroatom doped Co(OH)(2) material has also been proposed.									77	3	0	0	1	0	78			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000414605900017

Herein, a fast reduction strategy is developed for synthesis of strongly coupled crystalline alpha-Ni(OH)(2) with amorphous reduced FeOOH (r-FeOOH) heterostructure grown on Ni foam (r-FeOOH/alpha-Ni(OH)(2)/NF). The obtained r-FeOOH/alpha-Ni(OH)(2) with particle sizes around similar to 10 nm is coated orderly on the 3D NF surface in this hybrid. Benefitting from the strong coupling effects between r-FeOOH and alpha-Ni(OH)(2), low potentials of 1.62 and 1.66 Vat ultra-high current densities of 1,000 and 1,500 mA cm(-2), as well as a robust stability over 10 hat 1,500 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte are achieved in 3D r-FeOOH/alpha-Ni(OH)(2)/NF. Such a high OER performance is almost the best among all previously reported Fe-Ni-based OER electrocatalysts. Experimental results revealed that the NiOOH species is the real OER active phase in the 3D r-FeOOH/ alpha-Ni(OH)(2)/NF. Further, bifunctional 3D r-FeOOH/alpha-Ni(OH)(2) in alkaline electrolyzer delivers low cell voltages of 2.32 and 2.78 V to attain 500 and 1,000 mA cm(-2) toward the overall-water-splitting, surpassing the benchmark Pt/C-Ir/C/NF system.

Recently, H2S precursor is being used in the CVD technique to synthesize 2D MoS2. Although several studies have been carried out to examine the mechanism of MoS2 growth in the presence of sulfur and MoO3 precursors, the growth of MoS2 in the presence of H2S precursor has largely remained unknown. In this study, we present a Reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulation to investigate the reaction mechanism of MoS2 from MoO3 and H2S precursors. The intermediate molecules formation, the reason behind those formations, and the surface compositions of MoOxSyHz during the initial steps of CVD have all been quantified. Surprisingly, a sudden separation of sulfur atoms from the surface was observed in the H2S precursor system due to the substantial oxygen evolution after 1660 K. The sulfur detachments and oxygen evolution from the surface were found to have a linear relationship. In addition, the intermediate molecules and surface bonds of MoS2 synthesized by MoO3 and H2S precursors were compared to those of a system using S-2 and MoO3 precursors. The most stable subsidiary formation from the H2S precursor was found to be H2O, whereas in case of S-2 precursor it was SO. These results provide a valuable insight in the formation of large-scale and high-quality 2D MoS2 by the CVD technique.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000860850600018	36167969

However, lacking a molecular-scale control on the layer sequence hinders enhancement of electrochemical activity. Herein, we conducted electrostatic layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly, employing oxide nanosheets (e.g., MnO2, RuO2.1, reduced graphene oxide (rGO)) and layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets (e.g., NiFe-based LDH) to explore a series of mono- and bilayer films with various combinations of nanosheets and sequences toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The highest OER activity was attained in bilayer films of electrically conductive RuO2.1 nanosheets underlying catalytically active NiFe LDH nanosheets with mixed octahedral/tetrahedral coordination (NiFe LDHTd/Oh). At an overpotential of 300 mV, the RuO2.1/NiFe LDHTd/Oh film exhibited an electrochemical surface area (ECSA) normalized current density of 2.51 mA cm(ECSA )(-2)and a mass activity of 3610 A g(-1), which was, respectively, 2 and 5 times higher than that of flocculated RuO2.1/NiFe LDHTd/Oh aggregates with a random appearance of a surface layer. First-principles density functional theory calculations and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations further revealed that the improved catalytic performance was ascribed to a substantial electronic coupling effect in the heterostructure, in which electrons are transferred from exposed NiFe LDHTd/Oh nanosheets to underneath RuO2.1. The study provides insight into the rational control and manipulation of redox-active surface layers and conductive underlying layers in heteroassembled nanosheet films at molecular-scale precision for efficient electrocatalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000780214300053	35188374

However, critical debates remain on the use of the O-K pre-edge variations upon electrochemical cycling as evidences of oxygen redox reactions, which has been a popular practice in the battery field. This study presents an investigation of the O-K pre-edge of 55 oxides covering all 3d TMs with different elements, structures, and electrochemical states through combined experimental and theoretical analyses. It is shown unambiguously that the O-K pre-edge variation in battery cathodes is dominated by changing TM-d states. Furthermore, the pre-edge enables a unique opportunity to project the lowest unoccupied TM-d states onto one common energy window, leading to a summary map of the relative energy positions of the low-lying TM states, with higher TM oxidation states at lower energies, corresponding to higher electrochemical potentials. The results naturally clarify some unusual redox reactions, such as Cr3+/6+. This work provides a critical clarification on O-K pre-edge interpretation and more importantly a benchmark database of O-K pre-edge for characterizing redox reactions in batteries and other energy materials.									33	3	0	0	0	0	33				2575-0356		WOS:000603465100001

Simultaneously with the adsorption of the material on the electrode, the evolution of dioxygen is detected and modifications of the catalyst structure are observed. XPS and XAS studies reveal that the species present at the electrode interface is best described as a partly oxidized molecular species rather than the formation of large aggregates of iridium oxide. These findings are in line with the unique kinetic profile of the parent complex in the water oxidation reaction.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000374786300032	27040354

The imine functionalities on the surface of silica react via unique reaction pathways to yield tautomers of I-ERSG as confirmed through spectroscopic analysis (Fourier transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance). FE-SEM images reveal densely packed discrete spherical particles of IERSG, supported by N-2 sorption isotherms. The presence of multiple conjugations (C.C and C.N+) in I-ERSG is confirmed by UV-vis spectra, which is reaffirmed by a red shift with higher absorbance in the corresponding diffused reflectance spectra. Also, the cross-linking of resorcinol on the surface of IMSG follows covalent interactions as confirmed by time-evolution UV-vis spectra. The electrocatalytic behavior of I-ERSG toward ORR in a nonaqueous electrolyte follows the unusual 2(e-) reduction, and the activity is relatively superior (onset potential: -0.59 V vs Ag/Ag+; current density: 2.5 mA/cm(2)) and reversible than their pristine counterparts. Here, the hydroxyl groups present in I-ERSG act as the proton source in transforming the 1(e-) to 2(e-) oxygen reductive pathways with the formation of O-2- and HO2 as the intermediates.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000688250200038

An Examination of Nitric Oxide Kinetics in a Plasma Afterglow with Significant Vibrational Loading								52nd AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting								16 pp.	16 pp.						2013	2013	Laser-induced fluorescence measurements (LIF) of nitric oxide and two photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence (TALIF) of oxygen and nitrogen atoms are performed in a diffuse plasma filament with significant vibrational loading. The results are compared with kinetic modeling calculations. The experimental data shows that significant NO concentrations are achieved within a few microseconds after the pulse, after which the NO evolution is controlled by the reverse Zel'dovich reactions. The modeling calculation results show that the dominant formation channel is through collisions of oxygen atoms with multiple electronically-excited nitrogen states. Aside from acting as an energy reservoir, the large concentration of vibrationally-excited nitrogen in the ground electronic state seems to have no effect on NO formation. The present experimental results are accurately reproduced by incorporating all electronically excited N*2 levels.					52nd AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting52nd AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting	13-17 Jan. 201413-17 Jan. 2014		National Harbor, MD, USANational Harbor, MD, USA	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-1-62410-256-1	INSPEC:14129512

In models, the assumed speed of this flame influences whether this process leads to an explosion or to the formation of a neutron star. We calculate the laminar flame speeds in degenerate oxygen-neon mixtures with compositions motivated by detailed stellar evolution models. These mixtures include trace amounts of carbon and have a lower electron fraction than those considered in previous work. We find that trace carbon has little effect on the flame speeds, but that material with electron fraction Y-e approximate to 0.48 - 0.49 has laminar flame speeds that are approximate to 2 times faster than those at Y-e = 0.5. We provide tabulated flame speeds and a corresponding fitting function so that the impact of this difference can be assessed via full star hydrodynamical simulations of the collapse process.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000537772900005

Here, hetero-structured MoS2/ZnIn2S4 nanosheets have been prepared to capture visible light and the generated charge carriers are utilized for promoting both the oxygen reduction reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction. With the light illumination in the discharge process, the abundant photo-inspired electrons serve as the reaction sites to promote the reduction of O-2 into LiO2 which is finally deposited as Li2O2. On the contrary, the generated holes in the valence band can contribute to the low oxidization potential of Li2O2 during the charge process. It delivers a low charge potential of 3.29 V, with an excellent resulting energy efficiency of 96.7%, much superior to that of 69.2% in the dark condition. It is noted that the involvement of photoelectrons has influenced the growth of Li2O2 films on the MoS2/ZnIn2S4 nanosheets through the surface-adsorption pathway. The insights from the theoretical calculation confirm that the photoelectrons favor the absorption of LiO2 and the formation of the Li2O2 film through the surface route. Therefore, this paper provides a deeper understanding of the mechanism of photo-inspired charge carriers in LOBs and will enable further exploration of photo-involved energy storage systems.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5				2637-9368		WOS:000803847500001

Although the severity of the historical glaciations is debated, theoretical "hard Snowball" conditions are associated with the nearly complete shutdown of the hydrological cycle. We show here that, during such long and severe glacial intervals, a weak hydrological cycle coupled with photochemical reactions involving water vapor would give rise to the sustained production of hydrogen peroxide. The photochemical production of hydrogen peroxide has been proposed previously as the primary mechanism for oxidizing the surface of Mars. During a Snowball, hydrogen peroxide could be stored in the ice; it would then be released directly into the ocean and the atmosphere upon melting and could mediate global oxidation events in the aftermath of the Snowball, such as that recorded in the Fe and Mn oxides of the Kalahari Manganese Field, deposited after the Paleoproterozoic low-latitude Makganyene glaciation. Low levels of peroxides and molecular oxygen generated during Archean and earliest Proterozoic non-Snowball glacial intervals could have driven the evolution of oxygen-mediating and -using enzymes and thereby paved the way for the eventual appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis.									80	1	0	0	41	1	82			0027-8424			WOS:000242884200006	17138669

Here we study the systematics of a presupernova core's "compactness" as a function of the mass of the star and the physics used in its calculation. Fine-meshed surveys of presupernova evolution are calculated for stars from 15 to 65 M-circle dot. The metallicity and the efficiency of semiconvection and overshoot mixing are both varied and bare carbon-oxygen cores are explored as well as full hydrogenic stars. Two different codes, KEPLER and MESA, are used for the study. A complex interplay of carbon and oxygen burning, especially in shells, can cause rapid variations in the compactness for stars of very nearly the same mass. On larger scales, the distribution of compactness with main sequence mass is found to be robustly non-monotonic, implying islands of "explodabilty," particularly around 8-20 M-circle dot and 25-30 M-circle dot. The carbon-oxygen (CO) core mass of a presupernova star is a better, (though still ambiguous) discriminant of its core structure than the main sequence mass.									161	0	0	0	1	0	161			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000334919600010

While Fe nanoparticles are typically employed as catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, a competing reaction against CO2RR), herein, efficient CO2 electroreduction is achieved through tuning their chemical microenvironment. Porous carbon layers were deposited on these Fe nanoparticles, which creates a hydrophobic environment to enrich local CO2 concentration and suppress water penetration and thus HER in the micropores. This strategy successfully turns Fe nanoparticles into an excellent CO2RR catalyst with over 90% CO Faradaic efficiency. Due to the unique local chemical environment created above, high CO selectivity could be maintained even in acidic electrolytes, which provides a promising approach to address the notorious issue of carbonate precipitation in widely used alkaline solutions for CO2 electrolyzers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000818804800001

Over the past century, fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas have provided a strong energy support for the modernization of the world. However, the limited fossil fuels cannot satisfy the continuously increasing power requirement in the future any more. Meanwhile. severe environmental pollution caused by massive combustion of carbon-based fuels also brings great danger to human's life. Therefore, it is urgent to develop renewable and clean energy to achieve sustainable development of the society. Renewable energy represented by hydropower, solar energy and wind power has attracted much attention and been widely utilized owing to its environmental friendliness and inexhaustible supply, while the uneven geographical distribution and fluctuation determine that it is unable to output electricity steadily and may lead to a waste of power. A key approach to this problem lies in converting the fluctuated renewable energy into stable chemical energy via electrochemical methods. and storing it as the chemical fuel. As a potential candidate, hydrogen works as an ideal carrier for power storage and supply due to its high energy density, free carbon emission and abundant reserve.Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis driven by renewable energy is considered as a promising strategy for producing green hydrogen, by virtue of high operating current density, low ohmic loss, and flexible loading range. In comparison to the cathodic hydrogen production, the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode remains to be the bottleneck and retards the overall performance. Besides. the harsh acid environment on the membrane and high anode potential present severe challenges to the stability of the anode materials. Therefore, tremendous efforts have been devoted to developing active and durable anode catalysts for promoting the practical PEM-based OER proceeding under a strong acidic media during electrolysis.This review gives an overview on recent progress in the design and synthesis of robust electrocatalysts for acidic water oxidation, emphasizing the strategies for achieving high electrocatalytic activity without compromise in durability. Firstly, the mechanisms of electrocatalytic OER in acidic media, which include adsorbate evolution mechanism and lattice oxygen mediated mechanism, are discussed in detail to obtain the theoretical guideline on catalyst design. Subsequently, kinds of acidic OER catalysts are introduced and categorized to summarize the effective strategies for performance optimization. It was found that the OER performance can be enhanced by exposing more catalytic active sites as well as enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activity of the active sites. To reduce or even replace the noble metals and develop the cost-effective anode catalysts, the non-precious metal catalysts represented by Co, Mn and Sb-based materials, which are tolerant to acidic environments, are discussed. Then, the concerned stability of acidic OER and corresponding optimization methods are summarized. In addition, anode catalyst supports with high electrical conductivity, large specific surface area and good stability are squarely concluded, which also play a key role in water oxidation. At last, the various strategies to elevate OER performance are outlined, together with the perspectives of future-generation electrocatalysts for durable and cost-effective PEM water electrolysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0023-074X	2095-9419		WOS:000868464500007

Transition metal oxides have shown promising behaviour as catalysts and supercapacitors. Recently, liquid exfoliation of bulk metal oxides appears to be an effective route which provides access to two-dimensional (2D) nano-flakes, the size of which can be easily selected. These 2D materials exhibit excellent electrochemical charge storage and catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. In this study, various sized selected cobalt hydroxide nano-flake materials are fabricated by this time efficient and highly reproducible process. Subsquently, the electrochemical properties of the standard size Co(OH)(2) nanoflakes were investigated. The oxide modified electrodes were prepared by spraying the metal oxide flake suspension onto a porous conductive support electrode foam, either glassy carbon or nickel. The cobalt hydroxide/nickel foam system was found to have an overpotential value at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M NaOH as low as 280mV and an associated redox capacitance exhibiting numerical values up to 1500 Fg(-1),thereby making it a viable dual use electrode.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000408168400001	28696333

However, accurately tuning heterostructures' interface during operation remains a challenge. Herein, we fabricated the needled-like heterostructure Co1-xS/Co(OH)F supported on flexible carbon fiber cloth via an atomic substitution strategy, in which sulfur atoms are simultaneously grafted into F vacancies after the partial removal of F atoms from Co(OH)F during the electrodeposition, thus achieving the growth of cobalt sulfide on the interface of Co(OH)F. This electrocatalyst with such design exhibits the following advantages: (1) The lattice distortion caused by atomic substitution leads to the increase of active sites; (2) Co1-xS constructed on the surface of Co(OH)F by the atomic replacement strategy optimizes the adsorption (OH-) and desorption (O-2) energy in the OER process; (3) the needle-like structure possesses the tip-enhanced local electric field effect. As a result, the Co1-xS/Co(OH)F/CC catalyst exhibits very high OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 269 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 71 mV dec(-1). The asymmetric electrode shows superior catalytic activity and stability in overall water splitting. The catalytic mechanism of these highly efficient Co1-xS/Co(OH)F/CC catalysts was investigated via DFT theoretical calculations and ex situ characterizations. This atomic substitution strategy displays universality for other transition metal sulfides (metal = Ni, Mn, Cu).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000874964200001	36094898

Herein, we adopt a facile one-pot strategy to embed Cu nanoparticles onto N-doped carbon-graphene (Cu@NC-700). The Cu@NC-700 exhibits robust and efficient ORR catalysis with positive half-wave potential (similar to 0.86 V vs. RHE) and low Tafel slope (33.9 mV center dot dec(-1)) in 0.1 M KOH solution. Meanwhile, it manifests remarkable electrochemical stability, and strong tolerance to methanol crossover and carbon monoxide poisoning. The synergistic effect between Cu-N-C sites, Cu nanoparticles, and N-doped carbon support speeds up ORR electrocatalysis.									23	3	0	0	0	0	23			1001-604X	1614-7065		WOS:000535033300001

Coating failure and corresponding rapid oxidation of coating and substrate occurred at 1300-1400 degrees C. It was mainly caused by the thickness decrease of the outer dense Cr2O3 scale, the Zr-Cr eutectic reaction, the Zr-Cr interdiffusion, and the precipitation of ZrO2 along unoxidized Cr grain boundaries. The phase transformation of tetragonal ZrO2-x to cubic ZrO2-y increased the oxidation rate of the Zircaloy-4 substrate at similar to 1500 degrees C through the higher oxygen diffusion coefficient in the cubic phase.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000700927800003

In particular, the overpotential of the OER is relatively higher than the HER, and thus, it is considered that one of the important methods to enhance the performance of the electrocatalyst is to reduce the overpotential of the OER. In this work, we present a simple synthetic route for triple perovskite Nd1.5Ba1.5CoFeMnOx with high performance OER and HER activity. This triple perovskite structure which shows high crystallinity through combustion method shows superior bifunctional catalytic performance in alkaline media. We believe that the prepared triple provskite with high performance OER and HER activity can give further feasibility for the commercialization of a water splitting system.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1225-1429	2234-5078		WOS:000537723800004

We herein report an ingenious strategy to develop highly selective and competitive precious metal-free ORR electrocatalyst Co/CoO/SnO encapsulated in N-rich mesoporous carbon (CCS@NPC) nanocubes, via a simple one-step introduction of all functional components. Atomically mixed composites with significantly enhanced catalytic activity were obtained by adopting amorphous meso-porous ternary metal oxides CoSnO3 nanocubes as precursor and template. The synergistic effect of the triphase nanohybrids (Co, CoO & SnO) anchored in nitrogen-doped meso-porous carbon nanocubes promoted the catalytic reactions, owning to the anisotropic morphology, great heterojunction interfaces, and structural stability. The large-scale pre-pared CCS@NPC exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity toward ORR with an admirable onset potential (1.01 V) and diffusion-limited current density (5.88 mA cm(-2)). The CCS@NPC showed stronger stability (20 h) and higher methanol tolerance with the con-centration up to 8.0 M, compared to that of commercial Pt/C. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

J	Wang, Yao; Wang, Dingsheng; Li, Yadong								A fundamental comprehension and recent progress in advanced Pt-based ORR nanocatalysts								SMARTMAT				2	1			56	75		10.1002/smm2.1023				MAR 2021	2021	Today, Pt/C catalysts are widely used in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The practical applications of PEMFCs still face many limitations in the preparation of advanced Pt-based catalysts, including high cost, limited life-time, and insufficient power density. A kinetically sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is primarily responsible for these issues. The development of advanced Pt-based catalysts is crucial for solving these problems when the large-scale application of PEMFCs is to be realized. Herein, we demonstrate the design principle of advanced Pt-based catalysts with an emphasis on theoretical understandings to practical applications. Generally, three main strategies (including strain effect, electronic effect, and ensemble effect) that governing the initial activity of Pt-based electrocatalysts are elaborated in detail in this review. Recent advanced Pt-based ORR catalysts are summarized and we present representative achievements to further reveal the relationship of excellent ORR performance based on theoretical mechanisms. Then we focus on the preparation standards of membrane electrode assembles and testing protocols in practice. Finally, we predict the remaining challenges and present our perspectives with regards to design strategies for improving ORR performance of Pt-based catalysts in the future.									34	10	0	0	0	0	36			2766-8525	2688-819X		WOS:000854098300006

And Vp-Ni2P-Pt/CC is synthesized as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and selective methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) at methanol-water co-electrolysis. The loading of Pt is only 12.97 mu g cm-2, and the synergistic effect with the substrate material Ni2P enables efficient MOR at low potential (0.6 V vs RHE), and the mass activity of Pt can reach 9.16 A mg-1Pt. Compared with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the water electrolysis, the MOR potential is negatively shifted by 931 mV during coelectrolysis, and the energy consumption of hydrogen production is saved by 40-55%. Moreover, value-added chemicals formate is simultaneously co-generated while without CO2 emission.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000863343700003

It was found that the CPO surface contained active type c water, which was generally adsorbed on the oxygen vacancy. The test of oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O-2-TPD) showed that the surface of CPO was rich in oxygen vacancy. Through the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) detection, a pair of Co valence redox peaks were detected from the CV curves, and the results of XPS test showed the replacement of octahedral Co3+ with Fe3 + in the Co3O4 during preparation of CPO. The enriched oxygen vacancy could be used as active sites for ozone adsorption and improve the charge transfer capacity. The number of hydroxyl radicals was detected by electron spin resonance (EPR) and it indicated that CPO contained more hydroxyl radicals, so it had higher effect in catalytic ozonation for organic pollutant degradation. In this paper, the relationship between oxygen vacancy and reactive center in the microstructure of the catalysts was established to discuss their working mechanism. The influence of the initial pH value, catalyst dosage, and ozone concentration on the removal of NaTSA was investigated by response surface design, and the optimal experimental conditions were predicted and verified.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000752775700008	35137313

Herein, novel three-dimensional (3D) bimetallic metal-organic frameworks containing Ni and V with adjustable stoichiometry were synthesized on nickel foam successfully. Notably, Ni2V-MOFs@NF only require rather low overpotentials of 244 and 89 mV for the OER and HER, respectively, and expedites overall water splitting with 1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with robust durability during the 80 h test. The high efficiency of the novel obtained electrocatalysts should be attributed to the particular morphological design of the two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin nanosheets self-assembling into a 3D nanoflower and the electronic structure regulation resulting from the synergetic interaction between nickel and vanadium. Subsequent theoretical calculations reveal the following conclusions: (I) the exceptional electronic conductivity of Ni2V-MOFs shows enhanced optimization as a result of electronic structure reconstruction, (II) the energy barrier reduction of the rate-limiting step is responsible for the enhanced dynamics of Ni2V-MOFs for the OER, and (III) the facilitation of the adsorption of H+ and H2O plays a key role in progressing the HER catalytic activity of Ni2V-MOFs.									24	0	0	0	1	0	24			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000586868400025	33050703

Modeling Gasification of Carbon Fiber Preform in Oxygen Rich Environments								47th AIAA Thermophysics Conference								10 pp.	10 pp.						2017	2017	In order to better understand the role of surface reactions in carbon fibers based Thermal Protection System materials, the oxidation of a simple geometry was studied. A porous carbon fiber-based plug was subjected to a How of oxygen at various temperatures and pressures. Although the microscopic geometry of these materials is extremely complicated, a homogenized model was used. In this model, the properties of the material only vary only along the direction of the How. It can be shown that the governing equations for the unidirectional How along the porous plug depend only on two parameters, which characterize the materials microscopic structure: the porosity and the interfacial area of solid carbon exposed to the gaseous phase. Furthermore, the How evolution can be considered quasisteady based on comparison between the much shorter residence time through the porous material and the total gasification time. The characteristic time of the surface reactions relative to the residence time through the plug is quantified with Damkohler numbers. The regime of small Damkohler numbers compared to unity, usually called volumetric ablation in the literature, is characterized by slow surface reactions distributed through the whole volume of the plug. At the opposite limit, the regime of Damkohler numbers large compared to unity, usually called surface ablation, is characterized by fast surface reaction that exhausted the oxygen right at the front face of the plug.					47th AIAA Thermophysics Conference47th AIAA Thermophysics Conference	5-9 June 20175-9 June 2017		Denver, CO, USADenver, CO, USA	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-1-62410-499-2	INSPEC:17169168

Herein, a novel robust binder-free Fe-Ni hydroxide-loaded NF electrode is prepared by simple corrosion of NF in a home-made piranha solution with an Fe3+ precursor. The roughened NF surface observed after the sample treatment indicates the formation of active species associated with amorphous Fe-hydroxide and/or FeNi-hydroxide particles. The piranha solution-corroded NF electrode generates more hydroxide groups compared to the water-corroded NF electrode, and exhibits remarkable electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction activity in alkaline medium with a low overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). It also maintains low working potential below 267 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) over 500 h operation without any sign of degradation, indicating excellent long-term stability, which can be attributed to the robust binder-free electrode and the cooperative synergistic interaction between Fe-hydroxides and Ni-hydroxides in the FeNi hybrid composite of individually incompetent OER components, generated over the NF. The role of Fe doped in Ni(OH)(2) is theoretically studied by DFT calculations, and it is found that the adsorption free energies of OH* and OOH* are significantly reduced by the addition of Fe into Ni(OH)(2), accelerating the OER compared to bare Ni(OH)(2). Furthermore, when the active electrode is equipped with a solar cell, a high current density of 23-24 mA cm(-2) is observed for 10 h under AM 1.5G 1 sun irradiation, suggesting high possibility for the production of green hydrogen from renewable solar energy.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2398-4902			WOS:000593581500036

In this regard, we attempted to prepare the heteropolyacid (HPA)-encapsulated TiHY zeolite a new photocatalyst mimicking the plant photosynthetic system. This photocatalyst (0.3 g/40 ml) was observed to generate hydrogen (4.08 +/- 0.7 mul/h) and oxygen (6.86 +/- 0.7 mul/h) from the aqueous solutions upon illumination by two photon reactions (UV and visible lights), which is quite analogous to the "Z-scheme" mechanism for plant photosynthetic systems. The turnover number of the photocatalyst was determined to be 11 with the quantum yield of the water splitting about 27 +/- 6% at 352 nm. Thus, this inorganic material must be very useful as a reaction center mimicking the plant photosynthetic system without electrical energy. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The major obstacles to realising this technology include the slow kinetics of oxygen reduction and evolution on the cathode (air electrode) upon battery discharging and charging, respectively. Here, we report non-precious metal oxide catalysts based on spinel-type manganese-cobalt oxide nanofibres fabricated by an electrospinning technique. The spinel oxide nanofibres exhibit high catalytic activity towards both oxygen reduction and evolution in an alkaline electrolyte. When incorporated as cathode catalysts in Zn-air batteries, the fibrous spinel oxides considerably reduce the discharge-charge voltage gaps (improve the round-trip efficiency) in comparison to the catalyst-free cathode. Moreover, the nanofibre catalysts remain stable over the course of repeated discharge-charge cycling; however, carbon corrosion in the catalyst/carbon composite cathode degrades the cycling performance of the batteries.									83	2	0	0	4	0	85			2045-2322			WOS:000347796900016	25563733

By a thermal treatment process, the formation of the pi conjunction in the PVA structure enhanced the PEC performance of MoS2/TNAs, exhibiting linear sweeps in an anodic direction with the current density over 65 mu A/cm(2) at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Besides, the photoresponse ability of MoS2/TNAs is approximately 6-fold more significant than that of individual TNAs. Moreover, a Tafel slope of 140.6 mV/decade has been obtained for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of MoS2/TNAs materials.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2073-4344		WOS:000676673900001

Accordingly, open-mouth N-doped carbon nanoboxes embedded with mixed metal phosphide nanoparticles are fabricated from monodisperse Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2)center dot H2O nanocubes through conformal Ni-3[Co(CN)6](2)center dot 12H(2)O layer coating, ammonia etching, and thermal phosphorization, sequentially. The product catalyst exhibits highly efficient electrocatalytic performances, achieving low overpotentials of 204 and 129 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively, and a small working voltage of 1.57 V for the overall water splitting, all at 10 mA cm(-2). Its long-term electrocatalytic stability is also outstanding, experiencing only minor chronopotentiometric decay after a 24 h operation at 10 mA cm(-2). The enhanced electrocatalytic performance may be attributed to the synergistic effects between the mixed metal phosphides, the protective function offered by the chainmail catalyst design, and the fast mass transport channels for the electrolyte and gaseous products afforded by the large openings on the nanobox shell, as well as the easy access of the inner active sites of the nanobox. The ingenious open-mouth nanobox structure together with embedded mixed metal phosphide nanoparticles is a unique design for improving the quantity and activity of catalytic sites of the catalyst for high efficiency electrolytic water splitting. The present design concept can be readily applied to the fabrication of other heterogeneous catalysts.									22	1	0	0	4	0	22			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000520487300049	32065202

The Mo-doped NiCu electrode was fabricated as a HER catalyst via a one-step electrodeposition process. The structure and the chemical state of the deposited catalysts were characterized by X-ray power diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. This Mo-doped NiCu electrode (8 at% Mo-content in solvent) exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity for the HER in an alkaline electrolyte as compared to bimetallic NiMo and NiCu catalysts, with a small overpotential of 95 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent electrochemistry stability.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000471940800038

However, AEMFCs involve slow hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) on the anode. Catalysts to improve the HOR were developed by control of ruthenium nanoparticle size, alloying ruthenium with iridium, and surface modification of metal nanoparticles, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity by optimizing hydrogen binding energy and bifunctionality of the catalyst surface. Here, the recent development of anode catalysts for AEMFCs is reviewed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1346-8804	1349-273X		WOS:000668434200002

The temperature range 450-600 degrees C was explored for the composition 30 mol% RhOx . Samples were characterized by means of SEM, XPS, cyclic voltammetry and polarization curves. Their electrocatalytic properties were tested for the H-2 evolution reaction. The following experimental parameters were scrutinized: voltammetric charge, Tafel slope, reaction order (H+), electrical resistance of electrocatalysts. The electrocatalytic properties were evaluated at constant potential as a function of temperature as well as of composition.

These parameters are usually evaluated separately for the anodic and cathodic half-cell reactions in a three-electrode system or by measuring the overall cell voltage between the anode and cathode as a function of current or time. Here, we demonstrate how bipolar electrochemistry can be exploited to evaluate the efficiency of electrocatalysts for full electrochemical water splitting while simultaneously and independently monitoring the individual performance and stability of the half-cell electrocatalysts. Using a closed bipolar electrochemistry setup, all important parameters such as overvoltage, half-cell potential, and catalyst stability can be derived from a single galvanostatic experiment. In the proposed experiment, none of the half-reactions is limiting on the other, making it possible to precisely monitor the contribution of the individual half-cell reactions on the durability of the cell performance. The proposed approach was successfully employed to investigate the long-term performance of a bifunctional water splitting catalyst, specifically amorphous cobalt boride (Co2B), and the durability of the electrocatalyst at the anode and cathode during water electrolysis. Additionally, by periodically alternating the polarization applied to the bipolar electrode (BE) modified with a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, it was possible to explicitly follow the contributions of the oxygen reduction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution (OER) half-reactions on the overall long-term durability of the bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalyst.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000382805900068	27469162	
J	Fustier, Patrick; St-Germain, Francois; Lamarche, Francois; Mondor, Martin								Non-enzymatic browning and ascorbic acid degradation of orange juice subjected to electroreduction and electro-oxidation treatments								INNOVATIVE FOOD SCIENCE & EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES				12	4			491	498		10.1016/j.ifset.2011.07.014				OCT 2011	2011	Orange juice was submitted to electroreduction and electro-oxidation treatments prior to pasteurization and compared to a control juice for oxido-reduction potential (ORP), dissolved oxygen and ascorbic acid contents. Evolution of non-enzymatic browning reactions and ascorbic acid degradation was evaluated at 4, 21 and 37 degrees C storage temperatures. Electroreduction treatment of the juice at 6 V (cell length of 1.58 cm) created a substantial reducing reservoir as ORP decreased from + 161 to -406 mV and it decreased dissolved oxygen by more than 90% of its initial content while the ascorbic acid content was not altered. In contrast, the electro-oxidation treatment raised the final ORP of the juice by 15 to 20 my, increased substantially the dissolved oxygen content and decreased significantly the ascorbic acid retention. Electro-oxidation treatment resulted in an increase of non-enzymatic browning reactions during storage. Both the control and electroreduced juice showed very similar trends in ascorbic acid degradation over the 3 months storage period whereas the anions, cations and amino acids profiles of the juice remain unchanged. Contrary to the control and electroreduced juices, the electro-oxidation process decreased severely the orange flavor intensity and character being characterized as musty with sour-bitter aftertaste.Industrial relevance of electrolytic treatment to modulate the oxidation-reduction potential of comestible food systems: The limitation of shelf life imposed on comestible beverage systems (juice, beer, milk, wine, etc.) is an important and common issue for food manufactures and consumers. The shelf life is shortened by the time-dependent development of off-flavors, browning, change of colors, and deterioration of nutrients, caused by the oxidative reactions of chemical and nutrient components in the food systems. Consequently, the food is becoming unattractive to consumers. The electrochemical technique by means of an electrochemical cell has the potential in inhibiting or accelerating these deterioration reactions through reduction or oxidation of organic and inorganic compounds inherent to the products, as well as effectively controlling the oxygen content in the products. This technique can be used as an alternative to the deliberate addition of chemical compounds (sulfite and others reducing substances) to inhibit the deterioration reactions (electroreduction) as well as to accelerate the aging process of the comestible products via accelerated oxidation process (electro-oxidation).

The catalyst was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, surface area, particle size analyzer, and Raman spectroscopy. The catalytic performance of IL-NiO center dot Fe2O3 to OER was evaluated by electrochemical linear sweep voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that ionic liquid [EMIm]NO3 can refine the particles of IL-NiO center dot Fe2O3 to decrease its particle size and increase the specific surface area and pore volume. IL-NiO center dot Fe2O3 also has a smaller charge transfer resistance and reaction resistance in electrocatalytic process to OER, which is beneficial to enhance the performance of catalyst. By the catalysis of IL-NiO center dot Fe2O3, OER can work at a greater current density and a lower overpotential.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000395018100028

The electrocatalytic reactivity in oxygen evolution was evaluated with the use of the rotating disk electrode. It was found that the electrocatalytic activity is substantially enhanced for the cobalt-doped material, while iron and nickel doping have no, or even, negative effect on K-OMS-2. The structure of the material bulk is preserved in all cases, but the formation of additional birnessite phases can be evidenced for the iron and cobalt dopants. It is discussed that the reactivity enhancement of Co/K-OMS-2 can be related not only to the formation of cobalt-doped heterophases (cobaltane, birnessite) but also to the changes of the properties of pristine cryptomelane.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000446982300013

Nevertheless, the low energy conversion efficiency and output power density hinder the practical application of all-solid-state flexible ZABs due to the lacks of bifunctional oxygen catalysts with high catalytic activity and flexible solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity. Herein, we report an active and cost-effective oxygen catalyst of manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanowires supported on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (MnO2/NRGO.(Urea)) synthesized by a facile one-pot process. Along with superior stability, MnO2/NRGO-(Urea) shows the prominent activities for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), and lowest potential difference between ORR and OER among most of the manganese dioxides reported recently. Importantly, the polyacrylamide (PAM) based alkaline gel electrolyte (AGE) which shows much higher hydroxide-ion conductivity (215.6 mS cm(-2)) than the state-of-the-art polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based AGEs is employed in the all-solid-state flexible ZAB. Thanks to the MnO2/NRGO.(Urea) catalyst and PAM-based AGE, the maximum power density (P-max) of the as -fabricated all-solid-state flexible ZAB reaches 105.0 mW cm(-2) with extraordinary mechanical flexibility and robustness. Our work offers a cost-effective strategy for all-solid-state flexible ZABs with high power density and excellent energy conversion efficiency.									61	3	0	0	2	0	62			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000517663800053

Three-dimensional materials possess the most attractive dimensional characteristics different from the bulk properties of the material. In the same way, ID materials also have their own fascinating physicochemical properties. The combination of these dimensional aspects ought to be highly desirable owing to their aforementioned advantages. Here, we successfully achieved the incorporation of 3D nickel vanadate (Ni3V2O8) nanocubes inside ID nanofibers using a well-established and most reliable electrospinning (ES) method. As-synthesized nanofibrous materials were assessed for electro-catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the alkaline medium for the very first time.

Ruthenium-based HER catalysts are considered good alternatives to commercial platinum-based ones, because they have similar hydrogen bonding energy, lower water decomposition barrier and considerably lower price. Recently, emerging Ru single-atom catalysts (SACs) have shown greater advantage for HER than Ru nanoparticles, owing to their high atomic utilization efficiency, catalytic activity and selectivity. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the recent development of Ru SACs for HER applications. An overview of synthesis strategies, atomically resolved characterization methods and electrocatalytic studies with different support materials is provided. Finally, the unresolved challenges in the development of Ru SACs for industrial HER applications are discussed, and future research priorities are proposed. This review is expected to guide the rational design, appropriate fabrication, and performance optimization of advanced Ru SACs toward HER applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000824662500001

The dominant electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) and the diminished electron-withdrawing resonance effect (-R effect) in the alpha-NO2 isomer noticeably diminishes the rate of oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) on the catalytic Co-center. In their beta-counterpart, the cumulative -I and -R effects noticeably enhance the OER and ORR kinetics on the same catalytic Co-center. Therefore, the regioisomerism of the -NO2 functionality amplifies the kinetics of ORR/OER without influencing their mechanistic pathways. When isomeric electrocatalysts are integrated to aid the charge chemistry of a Zn-air battery, the overpotential could be decreased by similar to 250mV with beta-NO2 isomer leading to a round-trip efficiency as high as 60%. This work contributes to the design of novel molecular platforms to target the overall round-trip efficiency of energy storage and conversion devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2589-0042		WOS:000869488900007	36238901

Gas interaction with the surface was activated by heating of In2O3 monocrystalline film at temperatures of 160 or 250 degrees C. The study of complex structure of C 1 s line and evolution of its fine components allowed to establish their nature and to propose possible surface adsorbed species and reactions, including a direct chemisorption and dissociation,of CO molecules. Reduction or oxidation of the surface determines whether the first (chemisorption) or the second (dissociation) process takes place.

However, the electrocatalytic performance of materials, especially the metal materials, toward the CO2RR is still limited due to the complex reaction processes and broad product distribution. Very recently, surface modification of metal materials has emerged as an effective way to boost their electrocatalytic CO2RR performance. Herein, recent advances in the surface modification of metal materials, which includes surface molecular functionalization, surface elemental doping, and surface plasma treatment, for CO2RR are presented. The surface modification-induced variations of surface states and electrocatalytic performances of metal materials, together with the underlying mechanisms, are highlighted. It is believed that the development of surface modification could promote the rational design and preparation of advanced CO2RR electrocatalysts toward practical applications.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2590-2393	2590-2385		WOS:000632647700013

Ultrafine surfactant free kesterite nanoparticles, CZTS, (similar to 4 nm) having an optimum band gap of 1.75 eV and electrical resistivity of 0.6 Omega m were used for various applications. The as-synthesized CZTS NPs showed promising electrocatalytic activity for the HER as well as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a lower Tafel slope and excellent recyclable catalytic efficiency. Rhodamine B, methyl red and methylene blue dyes were degraded rapidly and efficiently in a photocatalytic pathway by the as-synthesized CZTS nanoparticles with only 5% activity loss in degradation after the 10th cycle. Similarly, a higher rate constant and activity parameter were observed for the photocatalytic reduction of hexavalent chromium ions. The high catalytic performance of the present CZTS NPs over other catalysts under indoor light conditions in the absence of any expensive noble metals and harsh reducing/oxidizing agents have been attributed to the size, surface charge and electronic effect of the nanoparticles.									109	3	0	0	18	0	111			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000352441100053

MoS2 and graphene show great promise for the electrocatalysis of many reactions. Given that both graphene and MoS2 are highly anisotropic in nature, with edge planes that are several orders of magnitude more catalytically active than basal planes, a new hybrid material with maximized edge-plane density to provide efficient electron transfer, high catalytic activity, and conductive cores was engineered. The hybrid material consists of radial MoS2 nanosheets with a high density of edge planes and unsaturated active sulfur atoms as well as interspersed with conductive graphene nanoplatelets. This hybrid material exhibits excellent activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction and the detection of DNA nucleobases. Such a nanoengineered, nanostructured hybrid material may play a major role in future electrocatalytic devices.									13	1	0	0	0	0	14			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000374542900026	26968591

Herein, Cu1-xCo2+xO4 oxy-spinel nanoflakes are fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method with the oxidation of ammonia water. In the same condition, Cu1-x-Co2+xS4 thio-spinel nanospheres are formed without oxidation. In OER process, the as-obtained Cu1-xCo2+xO4 nanoflakes and Cu1-xCo2+xS4 nanospheres possess the anodic overpotential of 267 and 297 mV in alkaline media to drive the current density of 10 mA/cm(2), respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art noble metal catalyst of RuO2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis exhibits the higher ratio value of Co(III)/Co(II) in Cu1-xCo2+xO4 than that in Cu1-xCo2+xS4, suggesting that the strongly-electronegative oxygen efficiently predominates in regulating valence states of Co active sites in spinel structures. Remarkably, density functional theory simulation further reveals that the increased valence state of Co could accelerate the electron exchange between catalysts and oxygen adsorbates during electrocatalysis, thus contributing to the higher OER activity of Cu1-xCo2+xO4 catalysts. This work provides deep insight regarding the significance of non-metal element (O and S) in CuCo spinel structure catalysts, as well as presents a promising approach to exploit higher performance and grasp the mechanism of various non-noble-metal spinel catalysts for water oxidation.									13	1	0	0	1	0	13			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000587954200002

NiFe double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) bifunctional group catalyst is applied to OER/HER under alkaline conditions. The good chemical contact between LDH nanosheets grown in situ (NiFe-LDH) on nickel foam (NF) and nickel foam substrate improves the electrons and ions transportation in the reaction process, which is beneficial to promote the OER/HER. The results show only 464.6/219.4 mV overpotential (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) at 100/10 mA cm(-2) for OER/HER, respectively. The stability of D-0 (stands for NiFe-LDH/NF) was measured at 10 mA cm(-2) worked continuously for 24 h, and it is found that D-0 exhibits excellent stable catalytic performance. This work opens up a simple way to design and prepare the efficient, low-cost, and easily synthetic earth-rich electrocatalysts.

The hybrid composite showed an excellent catalytic activity toward HER in an acidic electrolyte. The overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was only 154 mV in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, which was lower than most of the non-precious metal and metal-free catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results suggested that the synergistic effect between Fe3C nanorods and N dopants could effectively tune the H adsorption energy on carbon resulting in an enhanced HER activity.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000426955500018

Using the data concerning the isotopic and element abundances of the surface of the secondary star, we show how the ratios of C-12/C-13, N-14/N-15 and O-16/(17O) and the abundances of C and N are affected by reaccretion of ejecta material. We suggest observational tests which, when compared with our results, will allow us to make predictions concerning the evolutionary state of the systems observed.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0035-8711			WOS:A1997XZ16700011

Herein, the rational design of vanadium element doped cobalt phosphide (V-doped CoP) nanoparticles has been investigated through a facile gaseous phosphorization using cobalt vanadium oxide or hydroxide (Co-V hydr(oxy)oxide) as precursor. The physical characterization shows that the homogeneous dispersion of V element on V-doped CoP nanoparticles have obtained, which may imply the enhanced electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrochemical measurements of the prepared V-doped CoP in alkaline electrolyte demonstrate the superior electrocatalytic activity for both HER (overpotential of 235 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) and OER (overpotential of 340 mV @10 mA cm(-2)). Further, V-doped CoP nanoparticles used as anode and cathode simultaneously in a cell require only 370 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The outstanding electrocatalytic activity may be ascribed to the improved conductivity and intrinsic activity owing to phosphating and the doping of V element. In addition, the long-term stability of V-doped CoP has been obtained. Therefore, metal doping into transition metal-based phosphides may be a promising strategy for the remarkable bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting.

Here, we capture dynamic reconstruction, including the geometric/phase structure, of hydrate molybdates at oxidized potentials. Etching-reconstruction engineering endows the formed NiOOH with a sub-5-nm particle-interconnected structure, as revealed by multi-angle electron tomography. The key to complete reconstruction is the multicomponent co-leaching-induced loose reconstruction layer, conductive to solution penetration and mass transport. This unique structure avoids particle agglomeration in catalysis and promotes complete exploitation of the catalyst with 1,350 h of durability to meet industrial requirements. Upon addition of iron during reconstruction, mainstream Fe-NiOOH with a retained structure forms. Coupled with MoO2-Ni arrays in a membrane-free and two-electrode cell, it achieves stable electrolysis in industrial-concentration KOH for 260 h. This work highlights the reconstruction chemistry of hydrate oxygen-evolving systems and their performance evaluation under industrial conditions.									60	4	0	0	4	0	61				2666-3864		WOS:000658756600009

Pre-test and post-test PLD SrIrO3 thin films were prepared for cross-section TEM characterization using a conventional method. Analysis of the surface structure is being carried out, the results showing that the structure is consistent with a more disordered perovskite SrIrO3, viewed from other zone axis directions.

In vacuum radiolysis, protection operating through energy and charge-transfer processes, as observed in the model alkane liquids previously reported, results in the reduction of H-2 evolution, in proportion to the number of benzene rings in the additive, and retardation of the film deterioration. Under oxygen atmosphere, G-values of more than 50 for oxygen uptake were measured in pure PP, which is attributable to a chain reaction. Although the uptake was significantly reduced by the addition of additives, the uptake recovered quickly after the consumption of additives at higher doses. In addition, it was found that the reduction of H-2 evolution in the presence of additives decreases to nil under severe oxidation. The mechanism of the degradation of PP and the protection by additives is discussed by comparison with the results previously obtained in the model experiment by using liquid alkanes.									28	0	0	0	1	1	29			0141-3910			WOS:A1995TL60100011

Here, we show that highly p-conducting zinc cobaltite spinel Zn1.2Co1.8O3.5 offers an enhanced electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution. We refer to previous studies on sputtered Zn-Co spinels with optimized conductivity for implementation as (p-type) transparent conducting oxides. Based on that, we manufacture off-stoichiometric conducting p-spinel catalytic anodes on tetragonal Ti, Au-Ti and hexagonal Al-doped ZnO carriers and report the evolution of O-2 at Tafel slopes between 40.5 and 48 mV dec(-1) and at overpotentials between 0.35 and 0.43 V (at 10 mA cm(-2)). The anodic stability, i.e., 50 h of continuous O-2 electrolysis in 1 M KOH, suggests that increasing the conductivity is advantageous for electrolysis, particularly for reducing the ohmic losses and ensuring activity across the entire surface. We conclude by pointing out the merits of improving p-doping in Zn-Co spinels by optimized growth on a tetragonal Ti-carrier and their application as dimension-stable 3d-metal anodes.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1				2633-5409		WOS:000680422700001	34458848

Here, we prepared a bifunctional nickel foam supported NiFe2O4 spinel catalyst (i.e. NiFe2O4/NF) that is capable of facilitating the coupling of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with selective methanol oxidation reaction (SMOR) in seawater to produce formate via a CO-free pathway. At a cell potential of 2.0 V, the NiFe2O4/NF||NiFe2O4/NF catalyzed HER-SMOR system produces remarkably high current density (>800 mA cm-2) with high Faradaic efficiencies (FE) at both electrodes (>96 % for HER and >95 % for SMOR to formate). The NiFe2O4/NF||NiFe2O4/NF HER-SMOR system also exhibits excellent stability over 48 h of continuous operation. With H2 being the only gaseous product, the HER-SMOR electrolysis system could operate in the absence of a membrane. Furthermore, the NiFe2O4/NF||NiFe2O4/NF electrodes are sufficiently robust for continuously catalyzing HER-SMOR in seawater electrolysis, showing no sign of deactivation or chlorine oxidation reactions over 6 h of continuous operation at a high current density of 700 mA cm-2. Mechanistic investigation and DFT calculations reveal that SMOR proceeds via a CO-free pathway, with Ni and Fe as the active sites for methanol and OH activation, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000871021500002

At low potential, the process was slow but energy-efficient, providing partial COD removal. It produced lignin at the anode with the exclusion of oxygen evolution. Hydrogen was produced at the cathode as a value-added product. At high interelectrode potential, the nascent oxygen produced at the anode led to oxidation of the organics. With prolonged electrolysis, complete removal of COD was possible, with a solution of sodium carbonate remaining. Low-potential electrolysis required about 2000 J of electricity per gram of COD removed, producing 180-190 mL hydrogen and approximately 0.55 g lignin. Electricity requirement per gram of COD removed in high-potential electrolysis varied from approximately 17,700 J at 1.5 V to approximately 149,000 J at 12 V. Approximately 1365 mL of hydrogen was produced for every gram of COD removed.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0734-1415			WOS:000272269300002

In contrast to conventional hydrothermal approach, microwave irradiation accelerates the synthesis of MoS2/Ni3S2/Ni foam from time of >20 h -2 h. The characterization of CoS-MoS2/Ni(3)S2/NF by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) indicate that a whole scale of ID the Ni3S2 nanorods were hierarchically integrated with MoS2 and CoS nanosheets. The as-synthesized CoS-MoS2/Ni3S2/NF hybrid not only endows the ease transport of electrons along Ni3S2 nanorods to Ni foam, but also accommodates maximal exposure of active edge sites to the reactants through hierarchically porous CoS doped MoS2 nanosheets, accomplishing the promoted kinetics and activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By electrochemical measurements such as linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscope (EIS), we find that the CoS-MoS2/Ni3S2/NF hybrid shows markedly enhanced electrochemical performance for both HER and OER. Specifically, the optimal CoS-MoS2/Ni3S2/NF-8C possesses the low overpotentials (eta(10)) of 85 and 225 mV at current density (|j|) of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH and the small 62.3 and 46.1 mV dec(-1) Tafel slope for HER and OER, respectively, outperforming those of most of the current noble metal-free electrocatalysts. These results highlight the fact that CoS-MoS2/Ni3S2/NF is a high-performance, noble-metal-free electro-catalyst, and provide a potential avenue toward achieving an enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards both in HER and OER. Yet the duration of the as prepared catalyst in OER still need to be improved. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, we used high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate the OER performance of thirty kinds of isolated transition metal atoms-doped ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets (M-UMONs). The results showed that the OER activity could be a function of the decorated transition metal-sulfur (M-S) bond orders with a volcanic-shaped correlation, and a strong correlation could be found when the difference of the M-S bond orders and corresponding metal-oxygen (M-O) bond orders were taken into consideration, implying that the difference in M-S and M-O bond orders could be a predictive descriptor of OER activity for M-UMON system. This successful result also implies this calculation-based method for the exploring of descriptors would also provide a new promising avenue for the discovery of high-performance OER catalysts.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13				2589-0042		WOS:000493388000036	31655059

When used as a 3D electrode for hydrogen evolution electrocatalysis, the resulting CoMoS4 NTA/CC demonstrates superior catalytic activity and strong long-term electrochemical durability in 1.0 M phosphate buffer solution (pH=7). It shows small onset overpotential of 21 mV and requires low overpotentials of 104 and 179 mV to drive geometrical current densities of 10 and 50 mAcm(-2), respectively.

Herein, bimetallic nickel-copper (NiCu) nanoalloys confined in mesoporous nickel-copper nitride (NiCuN) nanowires array encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) framework (NC-NiCu-NiCuN) is constructed by carbonization-/nitridation-induced in situ growth strategies. The in situ coupling of NiCu nanoalloys, NiCuN, and carbon layers through dual modulation of electrical behavior and electron transfer is not only beneficial to continuous electron transfer throughout the whole system, but also promotes the enhancement of electrical conductivity and the accessibility of active sites. Owing to strong synergetic coupling effect, such NC-NiCu-NiCuN electrocatalyst exhibits the best hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 93 mV for HER and 232 mV for OER, respectively. As expected, a two-electrode cell using NC-NiCu-NiCuN is constructed to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) water-splitting current at low cell voltage of 1.56 V with remarkable durability over 50 h. This work serves as a promising platform to explore the design and synthesis of robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.									72	6	0	0	4	0	72			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000444072800021

Tuning the electrocatalytic properties of materials by controlling the electronic structure of active sites is a promising but challenging approach. Structural and compositional flexibilities of nonstochiometric mixed metal oxides present unique opportunities toward this goal, as the reactivity of their metal cationic centers can be modified via ligand and charge transfer modes. Herein, theoretical calculations combined with experiments demonstrate that highly catalytically active 4d/5d transition metal cations for oxygen reduction can be generated by tuning the distinct intrinsic oxophilicity of 3d and 4d/5d metal cations within a perovskite structure. Tailoring the perovskite composition is shown to switch catalytically poor Rh in supported catalysts to highly catalytic active Rh cationic centers within a perovskite framework (LaNi1-xRhxO3, x = 0.01). These findings open up opportunities for extrapolating the function of such catalytic systems to other targeted chemistries.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2380-8195			WOS:000629230800026

As one of the most promising renewable energy production methods for the future, electrocatalytic water splitting is an ideal chemical reaction in which plasmonic NPs can be utilized for direct solar-to-fuel conversion. Due to the rapid carrier recombination on plasmonic NPs, hybrid photocatalysts integrating metals and semiconductors are usually employed to separate the hot electrons and holes. However, an understanding of the catalytic mechanism, which is critical for rational design of plasmonic electrocatalysts, including the interfacial charge transfer pathway and real reactive sites, has been lacking. Herein, we report on the combination of plasmonic Au NPs and semiconductors (Ni and/or Co hydroxides) for plasmon-promoted electrocatalytic water splitting. By using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), we find a strong spontaneous interfacial charge transfer between Au and NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH), which facilitates both the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. The real catalytic sites on the hybrid material are confirmed by selective blocking of the metal surface with a thiol molecular monolayer. It is found that the plasmon-promoted oxygen evolution occurs on the LDH semiconductor but surprisingly, the hydrogen evolution sites are mainly located on the Au NP surface. This work demonstrates the critical role of interfacial charge transfer in hot electron-driven water splitting and paves the way for rational design of high-performance plasmonic electrocatalysts.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000492396300021	32055334

Here, we demonstrate the use of caffeine as a "double-layer dopant" to enhance both the HER and HOR of Pt electrodes in base. HER/HOR rates increase by 5-fold on Pt(111) and are accelerated on Pt(110), Pt(pc), and Pt/C as well. FTIR spectroscopy confirms that caffeine is adsorbed at the Pt surface, forming a self-limiting film through electrochemical deposition. Caffeine films are stable up to 1.0 V vs RHE and are readily regenerated through caffeine deposition during load/potential cycling. The findings presented here both identify a potential catalyst additive that can mitigate high Pt loadings in alkaline fuel cells and electrolyzers while opening the door to molecular engineering of solid/liquid interfaces for energy storage and conversion.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800023

Here, we developed a new and facile method to introduce the oxygen vacancies (O-vacancies) to the surface of iron-nickel layered double hydroxide deposited on Ni foam (FeNi-LDH/NF) via the control of the NaCl contents in the initial FeNi precursor solution. O-vacancies are created by the intercalation and removal of Na+ cations in the FeNi-LDH crystalline structure, achieving the FeNi-LDH/NF electrodes with O-vacancy ratios of 1.3%, 4.2%, 6.8%, 14.2% and 27.4%. O-vacancies enhance the electronic conductivity, surface wettability and H2O adsorption/activation ability of the FeNi-LDH/NF electrodes. Most important, the results show a distinguished volcano-type dependence of the electrocatalytic activity of FeNi-LDH/NF on the O-vacancy ratios for OER. The best performance is obtained on FeNi-LDH/NF electrodes with 6.8% O-vacancies, achieving an overpotential of 177 mV to reach OER 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability at a high current density of 400 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution for over 60 h. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicates that excess O-vacancy defects on the surface of FeNi-LDH/NF catalysts would lead to too many delocalized electrons, which in turn deters the adsorption of the water molecule and thus reduces the activity for OER, while low O-vacancies would result in limited active sites for the H2O adsorption for OER. The results demonstrate the intrinsic relationship between the O-vacancy defects and electrocatalytic activity of FeNi-LDH catalysts for OER. The facile and controllable method to introduce O-vacancy defects in FeNi-LDH structure can also be utilized for other catalysts applications. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of oxygen volume fraction on the morphological evolution and microstructural changes during mechanical alloying was studied by various analytical techniques including optical and electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, laser particle size analysis, apparent density measurement, and microhardness test. The reactive mechanical alloying resulted in the formation of amorphous Al- and Al-Mg-Si-Fe oxides with a size range of 40-100 nm and volume fraction up to similar to 2.6 vol.% dependent on the oxygen partial pressure. Electron microscopy studies revealed formation of equiaxed grains with a wide size distribution ranging from 60 to 260 nm. Meanwhile, finer particles with narrower size distribution were achieved at a shorter milling time when the in situ solid-gas reaction was employed. Results of compression test and hardness measurement on the hot extruded powders at 450 degrees C with an extrusion ratio of 14:1 revealed a significant improvement in the mechanical properties caused by the nanometric ceramic particles as well as the ultrafine grain structure of the matrix.

Here, the decoration of isolated Ru atoms into an edge-rich carbon matrix is reported for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. The developed catalyst displays high catalytic performance with low overpotentials of 63 and 102 mV for achieving the current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. Its mass activity is about 9.6 times higher than that of the commercial Pt/C-20% catalyst at an overpotential of 100 mV. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations suggest that the edges in the carbon matrix enhance the local electric field at the Ru site and accelerate the reaction kinetics for the hydrogen evolution. The present work may provide insights into electrocatalytic behavior and guide the design of advanced electrocatalysts.									87	6	0	0	6	0	87			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000530393100001

Here we show that engineering the electronic structure of atomically dispersed Ru-1 on metal supports via compressive strain boosts the kinetically sluggish electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and mitigates the degradation of Ru-based electrocatalysts in an acidic electrolyte. We construct a series of alloy-supported Ru-1 using different PtCu alloys through sequential acid etching and electrochemical leaching, and find a volcano relation between OER activity and the lattice constant of the PtCu alloys. Our best catalyst, Ru-1-Pt3Cu, delivers 90 mV lower overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and an order of magnitude longer lifetime over that of commercial RuO2. Density functional theory investigations reveal that the compressive strain of the Ptskin shell engineers the electronic structure of the Ru-1, allowing optimized binding of oxygen species and better resistance to over-oxidation and dissolution.									443	35	0	0	29	1	449			2520-1158			WOS:000464248600010

Earlier proposals that bicarbonate may serve as substrate or catalytic intermediate are almost forgotten, though not rigorously disproved. These latter proposals imply that CO2 is an intermediate product of oxygen production in addition to O-2. In this work, we investigated this possible role of exchangeable HCO3- in oxygen evolution in two independent ways. (1) We studied a possible product inhibition of the electron transfer into the catalytic Mn4Ca complex during the oxygen-evolving reaction by greatly increasing the pressure of CO2. This was monitored by absorption transients in the near UV. We found that a 3,000-fold increase of the CO2 pressure over ambient conditions did not affect the UV transient, whereas the S-3 -> S-4 -> S-0 transition was half-inhibited by raising the O-2 pressure only 10-fold over ambient, as previously established. (2) The flash-induced O-2 and CO2 production by photosystem II was followed simultaneously with membrane inlet mass spectrometry under approximately 15% H-2 O-18 enrichment. Light flashes that revealed the known oscillatory O-2 release failed to produce any oscillatory CO2 signal. Both types of results exclude that exchangeable bicarbonate is the substrate for (and CO2 an intermediate product of) oxygen evolution by photosynthesis. The possibility that a tightly bound carbonate or bicarbonate is a cofactor of photosynthetic water oxidation has remained.									42	1	0	0	36	0	44			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000233240900030	16244147

Herein, conceptually-new, noble-metal-free, porous, atomically-thick sheets are first put forward as an excellent platform to promote the oxygen evolution activity through affording abundant catalytically active sites and enhanced two-dimensional conductivity. As an example, the synthetic porous Co3O4 atomically-thick sheets with a thickness of 0.43 nm and about 30% pore occupancy afford low-coordinated Co3+ atoms to serve as the catalytically active sites, while the obviously increased density of states at the valence band and conduction band edge facilitate fast electron transport along their two-dimensional conducting paths. As a result, the porous, atomically-thick Co3O4 sheets exhibit an electrocatalytic current up to 341.7 mA cm(-2), roughly 50-times larger than that of the bulk counterpart and even more strikingly higher than that of most existing reports under similar conditions. This work holds great promise for triggering breakthroughs in the field of electrocatalysis.									291	20	0	0	16	0	298			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000341195100037

The as-synthesized nanoarchitecture is composed of relatively thin Ni3Se2 nanosheets shell and NiSe nanowire arrays core (NiSe NWAs). Thanks to the favorable electric conductivity, high theoretical capacitance and the distinct micro-morphologies of the Ni-based selenide, it can present excellent capacitive performances. More importantly, an ASC constructed utilizing the as-fabricated NiSe@Ni3Se2/NF hybrids as positive electrode and active carbon (AC) as negative electrode can exhibit a large energy density of 45.5 Wh kg(-1) at 1.600 kW kg (1). Moreover, it can also show outstanding ultra-long durability with a capacitance retention of-96.1% after 12,000 cycles. In addition, the as-obtained NiSe@Ni3Se2 catalyst can present favorable electrocatalytic performances for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a small overpotential of 281 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Thus, this strategy not only provides an efficient channel to design high-performance electrode materials and electrocatalyst, but also promotes the practical applications of the newly emerged metal selenides nanoarchitectures in energy storage and conversion systems.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1044-5803	1873-4189		WOS:000620431000006

Herein, the ternary metal sulfides MoCoNiS supported on nickel foam (MoCoNiS/NF) are successfully prepared using Mo doping Co-based metal-organic framework (Co-MOF) as precursor, which may be helpful for the good dispersion of different metal element. The uniform elements distribution of Mo, Co and Ni on MoCoNiS/NF is determined by all kinds of physical characterization. Mo doping may regulate the electronic environment around Co and Ni, suggesting the potential synergistic effects between different heteroatoms. Electrochemical test shows that MoCoNiS/NF exhibits the excellent OER activity than other single metal or binary metal sulfides as comparison samples, needing only 151 and 226 mV overpotential to achieve current density of 10 (eta(10) = 151 mV) and 100 mA cm(-2) (eta(100) = 226 mV), respectively. The excellent stability of MoCoNiS/NF has been achieved. The remarkable OER performance of MoCoNiS/NF may due to the synergistic effects and good electrical conductivity as well as the three-dimensional structure of NF as substrate. Therefore, the rational design of MOF derived multi transition metal-based electrocatalysts will be an effective way for increasing OER performance. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Therefore, the properties of the interfaces between the various components of the electrode (semiconductor/semiconductor, semiconductor/catalyst, or photoelectrode/electrolyte) affect the PEC performance of the composite material. Notably, surface trap states may hinder charge transfer and transport properties, and also cause Fermi pinning, affecting the quasi-Fermi level and onset potential under illumination, which may in turn influence the PEC performance of the corresponding tandem cells. In this study, plate-like WO3 array films prepared by an aqueous chemical growth method were employed to highlight the effect of interfacial properties on the performance of a WO3-based photoanode. The Mott Schottky and linear sweep voltammetry experiments prove the existence of surface trap states and Fermi pinning for pristine WO3, which are alleviated after an "etching" treatment and disappeared after surface passivation by a Ga2O3 layer. Both etching and passivation increase the oxygen evolution activity and the Faradaic efficiency for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). After loading a permeable catalyst (FeOOH), the photocurrent is further increased, and there is a synergistic effect between loading of the electrocatalyst with etching or passivation. The onset potentials of the samples follow the trends: etch-WO3/FeOOH < WO3/FeOOH <= WO3/Ga2O3/FeOOH < etch-WO3 < WO3 < WO3/Ga2O3, indicating that the interfacial properties have a significant effect on the PEC performance.

Among the various water electrolysis systems reported to date, systems employing a solid polymer electrolyte membrane are known to display both improved safety and efficiency as a result of enhanced separation of products: hydrogen and oxygen. Conducting water electrolysis in an alkaline medium lowers the system cost by allowing non-platinum group metals to be used as catalysts for the complex multi-electron transfer reactions involved in water electrolysis, namely the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER, respectively). We briefly review the anion exchange membranes (AEMs) and electrocatalysts developed and applied thus far in alkaline AEM water electrolysis (AEMWE) devices. Testing the developed components in AEMWE cells is a key step in maximizing the device performance since cell performance depends strongly on the structure of the electrodes containing the HER and OER catalysts and the polymer membrane under specific cell operating conditions. In this review, we discuss the properties of reported AEMs that have been used to fabricate membrane-electrode assemblies for AEMWE cells, including membranes based on polysulfone, poly(2,6-dimethyl-p-phylene) oxide, polybenzimidazole, and inorganic composite materials. The activities and stabilities of tertiary metal oxides, metal carbon composites, and ultra-low Pt-loading electrodes toward OER and HER in AEMWE cells are also described.									27	0	0	0	1	0	29			2093-8551			WOS:000422628600002

Herein, we report one-pot synthesized microstructured SrMoO4 decorated on SrMoO4@rGO-MWCNT micro-nanocomposite as a capable catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an acidic environment. Different compositions (20 wt%, 40 wt%, 60 wt%, and 80 wt%) of the micro-nanostructures were engineering and evaluated electrochemically for HER catalysis. Among the compositions, 40 wt% SrMoO4@rGO-MWCNT was found to be the best with and overpotential value of - 193 mV for attaining a current density of - 10 mA/cm(2). The intrinsic activity of the electrocatalyst was evaluated based on the turnover frequency and chronoamperometric measurement. The synergistic effect of the optimal composition resulted in superior performance and has outperformed all the other combinations. The study has opened a new gateway for exploring the coupling of oxide materials with carbon nanostructures.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000539476700001

In this paper, the enhancement of the OER by first-row transition-metal (TM) doping of the abundant semiconductor ZnO was studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations on a substantial number of possible structures and bonding geometries. The calculated overpotential for undoped ZnO was 1.0 V. For TM dopants in the 3d series from Mn to Ni, the overpotentials decreased from 0.9 V for Mn and 0.6 V for Fe down to 0.4 V for Co, and rose again to 0.5 V for Ni and 0.8 V for Cu. The overpotentials were analyzed in terms of the binding to the surface of the species involved in the four reaction steps of the OER. The Gibbs free energies associated with the adsorption of these intermediate species increased in the series from Mn to Zn, but the difference between OH and OOH adsorption (the species involved in the first, respectively the third reaction step) was always in the range 3.0-3.3 eV, despite a considerable variation in possible bonding geometries. The bonding of the O intermediate species (involved in the second reaction step), which is optimal for Co, and to a somewhat lesser extend for Ni, then ultimately determined the overpotential. These results implied that both Co and Ni are promising dopants for increasing the activity of ZnO-based anodes for the OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000661289900001	34037325

In such systems oxygen reduction on carbon-based positive electrodes proceeds through a complicated mechanism that comprises several chemical and electrochemical steps involving, either dissolved or adsorbed species, and as well side reactions with carbon itself Here, cyclic voltammetry was used to reveal the effects of imperfections in the planar sp(2) surface structure of carbon on the Li oxygen reduction reaction (Li-ORR) mechanism by means of different model carbon electrodes (highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), glassy carbon, basal, and edge planes of pyrolytic graphite), in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-based electrolyte. We show that the first electron transfer step O-2 + e(-) reversible arrow O-2 (followed by ion-coupling Li+ + O-2(-) reversible arrow LiO2) does not involve oxygen chemisorption on carbon as evidenced by the independence of its rate on the carbon electrode surface morphology. The second electron transfer leading to Li2O2 (Li+ + LiO2 + e(-) reversible arrow Li2O2) is strongly affected by the electrode surface even in highly solvating DMSO. Formation of Li2O2 via the electrochemical reaction could be observed only on the nearly ideal basal plane of graphite. In contrast, for more disordered electrode surfaces, (and/or bulk) the only reduction peak revealed on cyclic voltammograms corresponds to LiO2 formation, supporting that solution-mediated mechanism for Li2O2 growth is more favorable in that case. We also show that increased defect concentrations on the carbon electrode surface promote the formation of Li2CO3 during ORR, albeit relatively slower than Li2O2 formation.									63	3	0	0	2	0	65			1932-7447			WOS:000393008900024

In the Haber-Bosch process, a metallic iron catalyst and high temperatures (400 degrees C) and pressures (200 atm) are necessary to activate and cleave NN bonds, motivating the search for alternative catalysts that can transform N-2 to NH3 under far milder reaction conditions. Here, the successful hydrothermal synthesis of ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets with an abundance of oxygen vacancies and intrinsic compressive strain, achieved through a facile copper-doping strategy, is reported. These defect-rich ultrathin anatase nanosheets exhibit remarkable and stable performance for photocatalytic reduction of N-2 to NH3 in water, exhibiting photoactivity up to 700 nm. The oxygen vacancies and strain effect allow strong chemisorption and activation of molecular N-2 and water, resulting in unusually high rates of NH3 evolution under visible-light irradiation. Therefore, this study offers a promising and sustainable route for the fixation of atmospheric N-2 using solar energy.									504	40	0	0	43	0	509			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000468005400003	30828882

Hydrazine removed dissolved oxygen and reduced CuO and Cu2O as well. The stable phase was changed from CuO to Cu2O or Cu depending on hydrazine concentration. Hydrazine concentration of 500 ppm could convert all CuO corrosion by-products to Cu2O. In a tightly sealed acryl tube filled with aqueous solution of 500 ppm hydrazine, octahedral Cu2O particles were formed while plate-like structures with high concentration of Cu, O, N and C were formed near a corrosion pit. The inside structure of a corrosion pit was not altered by hydrazine aqueous solution. Uniform corrosion of copper was almost completely stopped in aqueous solution of 500 ppm hydrazine. Corrosion potential of a copper plate was linearly dependent on log (hydrazine concentration). The concept of stopping pitting corrosion reaction by suppressing oxygen reduction reaction could be verified by applying this method to a reasonable number of real sprinkler systems before full-scale application.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1598-6462	2288-6524		WOS:000422620000004

The FeOOH@Co3O4 heterostructure not only retains the nanoneedle structure with open frameworks, but also improves the specific surface area and expedites the charge transfer.

Benefiting from the collective effects of special morphological and structural design and electronic structure engineering, the NixCo2-xP@NC NA/NF electrodes exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance for water splitting with an excellent stability in a wide pH range. The optimal NiCoP@NC NA/NF electrode exhibits the best hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in acidic solution so far, attaining a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 34 mV. Moreover, the electrode manifests remarkable performances toward both HER and oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline medium with only small overpotentials of 37 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 305 mV at 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. Most importantly, when coupling with the NiCoP@NC NA/NF electrode for overall water splitting, an alkali electrolyzer delivers a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at a very low cell voltage of approximate to 1.56 V. In addition, the NiCoP@NC NA/NF electrode has outstanding long-term durability at j = 10 mA cm(-2) with a negligible degradation in current density over 22 h in both acidic and alkaline media.									75	5	0	0	7	0	75			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000484604300001

In this paper, we demonstrate that the ORR-active/OER-inert single function catalyst Fe-N can be made as the OER/ORR-active bifunctional catalyst Co-Fe-N by controlled substitution of Fe with Co. To obtain atomic insights of the Co-enhanced OER catalysis, we develop a new exfoliation method to prepare atomically thin (1.1 nm) nanosheets (NSs) of CoxFe1-xN0.5 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2). Our studies show that both electronic structure and local binding environment of Fe are modified by Co substitution and the Co-Fe-N NSs show a volcano-like OER catalysis with Co0.15Fe0.85N0.5 NSs being the most efficient OER catalyst, showing the lowest overpotential of 266 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of similar to 30 mV dec(-1), and excellent stability in the 1.0 M KOH OER condition. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the Co-Fe sites in the Co0.15Fe0.85N0.5 structure are optimized to promote OH* to O* conversion, O*-O* coupling and O-2 formation. The Co0.15Fe0.85N0.5 NSs are a class of new noble-metal-free catalyst for OER.									64	5	0	0	3	0	64			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000458419000068

The samples were characterized by CO2 chemisorption at 250 degrees C and NO chemisorption at 60 degrees C. The catalytic effect of potassium in NO reduction was evaluated at atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed now reactor. Two types of experiments were performed: (i) temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) in a NO/He mixture; and (ii) isothermal reaction at 300-600 degrees C. Both TPR and temperature-programmed desorption experiments were also conducted subsequent to NO chemisorption. The reaction products were monitored in all cases, thus allowing detailed oxygen and nitrogen balances to be determined. Three characteristic reactivity regions were found in the TPR profiles: (a) high catalytic activity at low temperatures due to dissociative NO chemisorption, accompanied by N-2 and N2O evolution and oxygen accumulation on the catalyst surface; (b) severe catalyst deactivation at intermediate temperatures as the catalyst becomes fully oxidized; (c) recovery of high catalytic activity at high temperatures as the catalyst is reduced by the carbon, accompanied by the evolution of CO2 and CO. An increase in potassium loading was found to affect only the first region, extending the period of high activity. A good correlation was found between steady-state isothermal catalytic activity and the amount of oxygen accumulated on the surface upon NO chemisorption at 60 degrees C, especially for NO reduction at low temperatures (e.g., 300 degrees C). Therefore, dissociative NO chemisorption seems to be a promising technique for titrating the active sites in potassium-catalyzed NO reduction by carbon.									57	3	0	0	2	0	60			0887-0624			WOS:A1995QD28100016

Although there are well-established strategies for synthesizing porous metal oxides (e.g., by annealing the corresponding metal hydroxides), facile and scalable routes to porous metal hydroxides and metal chalcogenides are lacking. Here, we report a simple and general strategy to synthesize porous nanosheets of metal hydroxides by selectively etching layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoplate precursors that contain amphoteric metal and to further convert them into porous metal chalcogenides by a solution method. Using NiGa LDH as an example, we show that the thin nanoplates with high surface accessibility facilitate the topotactic conversion of NiGa LDH to beta-Ni(OH), and further to NiSe, with porous texture while preserving the sheet-like morphology. The converted beta-Ni(OH), and NiSe2 are highly active for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, which demonstrates the applications of such high surface area porous nanostructures with rich edge sites. Particularly, the porous NiSe2 nanosheets exhibited excellent catalytic activity toward HER with low onset overpotential, small Tafel slope, and good stability under both acidic and alkaline conditions. Overall electrochemical water splitting experiments using these porous beta-Ni(OH)(2) and NiSe, nanosheets were further demonstrated. Our work presents a new strategy to prepare porous nanomaterials and to further enhance their catalytic and other applications.									239	8	0	0	11	0	240			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000360323700031

The Pt-loaded vis-TiO2 thin films clearly showed high potential for the decomposition of water into H-2 and O-2 by the evolution of H-2 from methanol/water as well as O-2 from a silver nitrate/water system under both UV and visible light irradiation (lambda >= 420 nm). These thin films were found to decompose pure water into H-2 and O-2 stoichiometrically under light irradiation of wavelengths longer than 390 nm. Next, a novel TiO2 thin film photocatalyst was prepared on various metal substrates such as Al, Fe, Pd, Pt, Ti and Zr, while nanoparticles of Pt were deposited on the other side of these substrates. The reaction rate was revealed to increase with a decrease in the work function (phi) of the substrate. Moreover, the separate evolution of H-2 and O-2 could be successfully achieved under solar light irradiation by applying these thin film photocatalysts in an H-type glass container consisting of two water phases separated by a TiO2 thin film and proton-exchange membrane.

Using a high X-ray energy and a divergent beam setup, it becomes possible to examine the impact of the local as-grown point defect configuration on the formation of bulk micro defects in a crystal of macroscopic dimensions. As a salient feature the transition from vacancy- to interstitial-dominated regions in a 12 crystal can be identified, and its influence on the precipitation kinetics is quantified through effective oxygen diffusion constant. It appears enhanced by up to a factor of six in vacancy-rich regions as compared to crystal volumes which are identified as point-defect free where it agrees well with the literature value.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1862-6300	1862-6319		WOS:000344461800002

Here, N element doped NiSe2 nanosheets in-situ grown on the carbon cloth were prepared via facial hydrothermal synthesis of nickel hydroxide followed by selenization and nitrogen doping treatment. Such self-supported N-doped NiSe2 nanoarrays (N-NiSe2/CC) exhibits superior bifunctional catalytic activity and high durability compared with the pristine NiSe2/CC, which are ascribed to the unique structure after nitrogen doping. Nitrogen doping can provide more electrocatalytical active sites and improve the electronic transport for fast reaction kinetics, which is preferably corroborated with density functional theory calculations and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. As a proof of concept, the solid-state zinc-air batteries assembled by the N-NiSe2/CC directly as the air cathode present a low overpotential of 0.75 V, remarkable cyclic stability of 30 h with 90 circles, and robust flexibility. Therefore, the N-NiSe2/CC system proves to be a highly active and reliable electrode for the developing of metal-air batteries, opening up a promising opportunity for high-performance portable electronics.									26	1	0	0	2	0	26			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000569325100005

However, a lack of fundamental understanding of oxide surfaces impedes rational catalyst design for improved activity and stability. We couple electrochemical studies of epitaxial La1-xSrxCoO3-delta films with in situ and operando ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to investigate the surface stoichiometry, adsorbates, and electronic structure. In situ investigations spanning electrode compositions in a humid environment indicate that hydroxyl and carbonate affinity increase with Sr content, leading to an increase in binding energy of metal core levels and the valence band edge from the formation of a surface dipole. The maximum in hydroxylation at 40% Sr is commensurate with the highest OER activity, where activity scales with greater hole carrier concentration and mobility. Operando measurements of the 20% Sr-doped oxide in alkaline electrolyte indicate that the surface stoichiometry remains constant during OER, supporting the idea that the oxide electrocatalyst is stable and behaves as a metal, with the voltage drop confined to the electrolyte. Furthermore, hydroxyl and carbonate species are present on the electrode surface even under oxidizing conditions, and may impact the availability of active sites or the binding strength of adsorbed intermediates via adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. For covalent oxides with facile charge transfer kinetics, the accumulation of hydroxyl species with oxidative potentials suggests the rate of reaction could be limited by proton transfer kinetics. This operando insight will help guide modeling of self-consistent oxide electrocatalysts, and highlights the potential importance of carbonates in oxygen electrocatalysis.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000451652600013

The process is shown to result in the appearance of a composite coating with a substantial content of titanium oxides. The composite obtained is an n-type semiconductor, the flat-band potentials of which and the number of charge carriers depend on the preparation conditions. It is proposed to use the reduction peak of oxygen-containing platinum compounds on the stripping voltammogram as a correlation parameter for predicting the electrocatalytic activity of heat-treated Ti/Pt composite electrodes with respect to the oxygen evolution reaction.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2070-2051	2070-206X		WOS:000324396700009

From unique molecular structure of iminodiacetonitrile (IDAN), herein we design and build a novel organometallic coordination polymer (OCP) for the synthesis of hierarchical N-doped carbon nanosheets anchored PdNi/Ni hybrids (PdNi/Ni@N-C). The cyano ligands in IDAN can form a low spin planar tetragonal complex with M2+ (M=Pd and Ni) by dsp(2) hybridization, while the amino ligands tend to form a high spin tetrahedral complex with M2+ by sp(3) hybridization, which not only induce the formation of 2D carbon nanosheets, but also strengthen metal-carbon interaction after the pyrolysis. The optimized PdNi/Ni@N-C can function as an outstanding bifunctional electrocatalyst, presenting a positive half-wave potential of 0.89 V towards ORR and a low overpotential of 360 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) towards OER, out-performing commercial precious-metal benchmarks. Theoretical calculations are performed to analyze the alloying effects of PdNi and identify the potential active sites for ORR/OER. Furthermore, the PdNi/Ni@N-C as an air-cathode can enable rechargeable liquid and flexible all-solid-state Zn-air batteries to achieve higher power density and longer cycle life than costly Pd/C+RuO2-driven batteries. This work offers a potential molecular design strategy for the development of efficient electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.									37	1	0	0	2	0	37			2405-8297	2405-8289		WOS:000702774100001

Herein we report a facial ionic liquid (IL)-assisted [IL: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazohum tetrafluoroborate (BMIM-BF4)] hydrothermal approach for tuning both crystallographic phase and nanostructure morphology of MnO2, enabling the excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an overpotential of 394 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1). The roles of IL in the crystallographic and morphological transformation from beta-MnO2 nanorods to alpha-MnO2 nanowires and in the OER are carefully scrutinized. TEM, EDX, FTIR, XPS characterizations all reveal the capping of IL cations on the surface of alpha-MnO2, where the amphiphilic nature, the electrostatic interaction, the steric hindrance, and the pi-pi stacking of IL cations collectively serve as entropic drivers for the templated growth of 2 X 2 tunnel structure incorporating K+ ions. This structure has been particularly beneficial for OER, owing to a concerted synergy from the nanostructured morphology, suitable tunnel structure with rich di-mu-oxo bridges, alkali-metal incorporation, as well as higher content of trivalent Mn3+. "What's more, our investigation indicates the surface-immobilized IL plays a crucial role toward efficient OER by facilitating the formation and stabilization of oxygen vacancies on the surface of alpha-MnO2 nanowires.									69	5	0	0	0	0	71			2155-5435			WOS:000449723900025

A simple approach is reported to prepare a phosphorus and yttrium codoped cobalt hydroxyfluoride (YP-Co(OH)F) nanoarray on nickel foam, which displays high-performance for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution. The codoping of yttrium and phosphorus into Co(OH)F leads to a tuned electronic environment and favorable electron transfer, thus resulting in superior water splitting activity. The YP-Co(OH)F electrode only requires an overpotential of 238 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)), much smaller than RuO2 (302 mV). Moreover, it displays an overpotential of 55 mV at eta(10) for HER, similar to that of Pt/C. When YP-Co(OH)F is used as both anode and cathode in a two-electrode configuration, it only demands a cell potential of 1.54 V at eta(10), lower than the IrO2||Pt/C couple (1.6 V) as well as other recently reported electrocatalysts. It even maintains stable water splitting for 300 h. Such a two-electrode device can be easily driven by a 1.5 V silicon solar cell in sunlight, proving the potential of the promising catalyst for large-scale electrolytic water splitting.									29	1	0	0	0	0	29			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000484132000001	31469509

To compare the electrochemical performance of the Graphene/Ruthenium/alpha-MnO2 cathodes, bare rGO and rGO/Ru free-standing cathodes were also manufactured. rGO cathodes with well-dispersed alpha-MnO2 nanowires and ruthenium nanoparticles were successfully synthesized and shown to dramatically increase (decrease) oxygen reduction (evolution) reactions. The enhancement on the electrochemical performance of the synthesized cathodes was attributed not only to catalysis effect of rutheniumand alpha-MnO2 but also well-stacked morphology of the nanocomposite architecture which enables increased oxygen flow between the layers and, hence boosted reaction kinetics.Physical characterization of the cathodes was carried out using FESEM, EDS, TEM, XRD, XPS and Raman spectroscopy. The discharge product of the cathodes was also evaluated using TEM and XPS. Electrochemical performances of the cathodes were evaluated by means of CV, EIS, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical cycling tests. Thanks to the synergetic effect of Ruthenium and alpha-MnO2 catalysts, our ternary rGO/Ru/alpha-MnO2 cathodes were shown to serve full discharge capacity of 2225 mAh/g while rGO/Ru can deliver only 1670 mAh/g. Besides, the cycling stability of the ternary rGO/Ru/alpha-MnO2 cathodes was shown for 50 cycles at 650 mAh/g capacity limited tests in assembled LieO(2) batteries.

In this work, a novel type of bifunctional catalyst (CoPx/Co-N-x-C@CNT) simultaneously effective for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was prepared via a simplified all-in-one phosphorization-carbonization synthesis, which is distinctively different from the previously reported carbonization and postphosphorization route. With the integration of efficient catalytic factors such as Co-N-x-C-coordinated moieties, cobalt phosphide, graphitic carbon shells, as well as a supportive and conductive matrix, the as-prepared CoPx/Co-N-x-C@CNT exhibits high catalytic activity for ORR and OER in 0.1 M KOH, with an output positive onset potential of 0.92 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for ORR and a low potential of 1.69 V vs RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER. Remarkably, the assembled liquid and all-solid-state ZAB based on the as-prepared CoPx/Co-N-x-C@CNT showed superior cycling performance than the results of its Pt/C-based counterparts and some recently reported cobalt phosphide-based ZABs. The good flexibility and reversibility of the all-solid-state ZAB also verified its feasibility in applications such as wearable electronics.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			2542-5293			WOS:000492832200010

Thus, the search for oxygen evolution reaction catalysts is a hot topic of research. Reaction of the N5-tripodal amidate ligand, N-{2-[(bis(pyridine-2-ylmethyl)amino)methyl]phenyl}picolinamide (Htrip) with (MX2)-X-II (X = Cl-, Br-, I-), in anhydrous ethyl alcohol, and C2H5ONa yields the complexes [Mn-II(trip)Cl] (1), [Mn-II(trip)Br] (2), and [Mn-II(trip)I] (3). Single crystal X-ray structure analysis of 1-3 revealed that the manganese(II) atom in the three manganese compounds occupies the center of a distorted octahedral coordination sphere consisting of two pyridine, one picoline and one amino nitrogen atoms on the equatorial plane, while the axial positions are occupied by one amido nitrogen atom and the halogen anion. The three manganese(II) complexes 1- 3 constitute the first examples of mononuclear {Mn-II(N5(trip))X} species to be reported. Magnetic susceptibility measurements showed that these complexes are high-spin d(5) systems. Cyclic voltametric study of 1-3 revealed an unexpected two electron, electrochemically reversible redox process, assigned to the oxidation of Mn-II to Mn-IV. The electrochemical properties for oxygen evolution reaction of complexes 1-3 showed that the oxidized trip-ligand is responsible for the electrocatalytic oxidation of water to dioxygen.

Here we compare the kinematics, kinetics, and energetics of bipedal and quadrupedal walking and running in a sample of five captive chimpanzees. Kinematics were recorded using sagittal-plane digital high-speed video of treadmill trials. Kinetics were recorded via a forceplate. Metabolic energy cost was measured via steady-state oxygen consumption during treadmill trials. Consistent with previous work on chimpanzees and other hominoids, we found that the spatiotemporal characteristics, joint angles, ground reaction forces, and metabolic cost of bipedal and quadrupedal locomotion are similar in chimpanzees. Notable differences include hip and trunk angles, which reflected a more orthograde trunk posture during bipedalism, and mediolateral ground reaction forces, which were larger during bipedal walking. Stride frequencies were also higher (and step lengths shorter) during bipedal trials. Bipedal and quadrupedal walking among chimpanzees was similar to that reported for bonobos, gibbons, and other primates. The similarity in cost between bipedal and quadrupedal trials suggests that the adoption of bipedal walking would have had no effect on walking costs for early ape-like hominins. However, habitual bipedalism may have favored modifications of the hip to allow a more orthograde posture, and of the hind limb abductor mechanisms to efficiently exert mediolateral ground forces.

However, the detailed mechanism of the orientation of 2D materials with TiO2 has not been explored. Herein, different combinations of edge-on MoS2 or basal-on MoS2 with TiO2 are investigated systematically. The adsorption energy, the activation energy barrier, as well as the charge distribution reveal that edge-on heterostructures have better efficiency in the separation of photoelectron-hole pairs and can enhance the efficiency of hydrogen evolution reaction. This work studies the differences in mechanisms of edge-on and basal-on heterostructures in hydrogen evolution reactions.

Herein, the Ru decorated Co nanoparticles supported by N-doped carbon sheets (Ru/Co@NC) are prepared by galvanic exchange reaction and display a remarkable performance for HER. In the 1.0 M KOH, 0.01 M PBS and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively, Ru/Co@NC shows low overpotentials of 10, 283 and 50 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), comparable to benchmark Pt/C (23, 289 and 37 mV). Furthermore, deep experimental researches and DFT calculations indicate that the RuCo heterostructure shows more suitable energy of H2O* dissociation and H* adsorption compared to Ru and Co, which can significantly improve the HER activity. Besides excellent activity, in a wide pH range, the Ru/Co@NC also exhibits good stability with negligible current loss after a long-time HER test (30 h).

To overcome this limitation, OER can be replaced by a less demanding oxidation reaction, which in the ideal scenario could be even used to generate additional valuable chemicals. Herein, we focus on the electrochemical reforming of ethanol in alkaline media to generate hydrogen at a Pt cathode and acetate as a co-product at a Ni1-xCoxSe2 anode. We first detail the solution synthesis of a series of Ni1-xCoxSe2 electrocatalysts. By adjusting the Ni/Co ratio, the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for the production of acetate from ethanol are optimized. Best performances are obtained at low substitutions of Ni by Co in the cubic NiSe2 phase. Density function theory reveals that the Co substitution can effectively enhance the ethanol adsorption and decrease the energy barrier for its first step dehydrogenation during its conversion to acetate. However, we experimentally observe that too large amounts of Co decrease the ethanol-to-acetate Faradaic efficiency from values above 90% to just 50 %. At the optimized composition, the Ni0.75Co0.25Se2 electrode delivers a stable chronoamperometry current density of up to 45 mA cm(-2), corresponding to 1.2 A g(-1), in a 1 M KOH + 1 M ethanol solution, with a high ethanol-to-acetate Faradaic efficiency of 82.2% at a relatively low potential, 1.50 V vs. RHE, and with an acetate production rate of 0.34 mmol cm(-2) h(-1).									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000783190500001		
J	Ahanjan, Kimia; Shamsipur, Mojtaba; Taherpour, Avat(Arman); Pashabadi, Afshin								Catalytic synergism in Mn-heterostructured molybdenum oxysulfide hybridized with transition metal phosphides: A robust amorphous water oxidation catalyst								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				433						141249	10.1016/j.electacta.2022.141249				NOV 20 2022	2022	This work aimed to improve the catalytic behavior of semi-conductive amorphous molybdenum oxysulfide (aMoOxSy) as a weak oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. A simple galvanostatic procedure is employed to hybridize Nickel foam (NF)/Mn-doped aMoOxSy with some amorphous transition metal phosphides (TMPs). Mn-heterostructuring causes an impressive improvement in both morphological properties and OER activity by more than 300% compared with NF/MoOxSy. The hybridization with TMPs (Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) gives a trimetallic composite with strong interfacial interaction, long-term stability, and pronounced OER activity. Further consideration unveils how Mn-doping endows a dramatic synergism upon hybridization of MoOxSy with CoP and NiP (with current boosting >= 600%). While no synergism was observed after multiple examinations of CuP and FeP. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to theoretically address the role of Mn on the electronic features of the hybridized MoOS and the included transition metals. The defined theoretical synergism coefficient (TSC, tau) adhered to the observed trends in the electrochemical measurements. Two independent suggested schemes demonstrate the interfacial coordination pathway of MoOS-based composite. Finally, the NF/ Mn-MoOxSy/petals-like 2D NiP nanosheets are recommended as a robust and cost-effective electrocatalyst for OER. It requires overpotentials as low as 191, 299 and 366 mV at the current densities of 10, 100 and 500 mA cm-2, respectively, which are much superior to the benchmark NF/IrO2 catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000870474300003

In addition, one-component catalyst cannot achieve the efficient catalysis of oxygen reduction reaction(ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction( OER). At the same time, this paper reports a bifunctional catalyst with a bimetallic three-dimensional porous structure using silicon spheres as a hard template and ZIF as a carbon substrate. The inherent porosity of pie-shaped ZIF, the use of silica templates to generate an ordered macroporous structure, and the synergy between metal activity sites, which together promote the mass transfer and electrocatalytic activity of the battery. The synthesized catalyst showed excellent electrocatalytic activity toward ORR and OER including a half-wave potential (E1/2 =0.80 V) which is 20 mv less than Pt/C, and its overpotential (0.321 V) and voltage gap (& UDelta;E=0.751 V) sur-passes commercial Pt/C+RuO2 catalyst (0.368 V, & UDelta;E=0.778 V). Moreover, primary and rechargeable Zn-air battery is assembled based on this catalyst delivered preferable performance, including a high power density (98.7 mw cm-2),batter charge/discharge cycling stability (220 h) exceeds commercial Pt/C+RuO2 catalyst (160 h). Given its unique pore structure and good electrical conductivity, this derived material has scope for expansion in bifunctional catalysis and other energy technologies for rechargeable Zn-air bat-teries.(C) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000861024700004

Recently, high durability and catalytic activity of effective electrodes are necessary to enlarge clean and sustainable energy sources. However, overcoming the overpotential and to improve HER and OER performance is still one of the complicated tasks. Hence, in this present work, gadolinium (Gd) doped cerium oxide (CeO2) was successfully synthesized through a facile co-precipitation method. High intense peak at 28.5 degrees clearly indicated CeO2 cubic structure formation identified by using X-Ray diffraction. The optical phonon mode of F-2g and oxygen vacancies mode was detected by using Raman spectra. The optical properties of CeO2 were detected with help of photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed Ce-O vibration of CeO2 crystal existence. Surface morphology of CeO2 was thoroughly studied by using SEM images. HER and OER activity of pristine and Gd doped CeO2 was thoroughly investigated with the help of linear sweep voltammetry. Compared to pristine CeO2, high content of Gd doped CeO2 exhibited excellent HER and OER activity with low overpotential (99 mV for HER and 369 mV for OER) and small Tafel slope (211 mV/dec for HER and 183 mV/dec for OER). Addition of rare earth metal influenced the structural and catalytic properties of optimized metal oxide. Hence, the incorporation of Gadolinium in CeO2 plays a crucial role to enhance both HER and OER performance and it is one of the good candidates for energy conversion applications.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000717770300005

In this work, novel electrocatalytically active hybrid materials comprising Fe0.5Co0.4Ni0.1 alloy nanoparticles-embedded N-doped carbon nanotubes, named CNTs@(Fe,Co,Ni)PP-T (where T denotes the pyrolysis temperature employed to prepare them), are developed by pyrolyzing the mixture of hyperbranched tri-metal (Fe, Co, Ni)-coordinated polyporphyrin-encapsulated carboxylic acid-functionalized carbon nanotubes and melamine. The materials are demonstrated to act as effective bifunctional oxygen electrode catalysts. Especially, the one generated at 800 degrees C, termed as CNTs@(Fe,Co,Ni)PP-800, has larger specific surface area, larger active surface area and better electrical conductivity than other as-obtained contrast materials. Undoubtedly, this material displays superior reactive activity for O-2-associated electrochemical reactions in alkaline media, delivering more positive onset (0.988 V vs. RHE) and half-wave (0.837 V vs. RHE) potentials for the reduction of oxygen and a smaller overpotential (355 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) for the evolution of oxygen than its counterparts. In practical application, the CNTs@(Fe,Co,Ni)PP-800 based zinc-air battery (ZAB) achieves a small initial charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.69 V at 2 mA cm(-2) and an outstanding cycling durability in 300 cycles of charge-discharge (in over 50 h), superior to the benchmark Pt/C+RuO2 based ZAB under the identical testing conditions.

Nano-crystalline Ni-Mo alloy coatings were deposited in the current density (c.d.) range of 1.0-4.0 A dm(-2) on a copper substrate, and were investigated for their deposit characters, and their electrocatalytic behaviours in 1.0 M KOH solution. The electrocatalytic behaviour of the coatings, in terms of their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), were evaluated by electrochemical methods, like cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry (CP). Experimental results revealed that Ni-Mo alloy electrodeposited at 1.0 A dm(-2) (38.3 wt% Mo) and 4.0 A dm(-2) (33.2 wt% Mo) shows the highest electrocatalytic tendency for HER and OER, respectively. The corrosion behaviour of Ni-Mo alloy coated at 4.0 A dm(-2) is found to be the most corrosion resistant in the same alkaline medium, compared to other coatings. The highest electrocatalytic activity of Ni-Mo alloy deposit for both HER and OER, depending on deposition c.d. was attributed to their composition (in terms of Ni and Mo content), structure and surface morphology; supported by EDXA, XRD, SEM and AFM analyses. The experimental study demonstrated that Ni-Mo alloy coatings follow Volmer-Tafel type of mechanism for HER, testified by Tafel slope analyses.									38	3	0	0	1	1	41			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000405047300008

Notably, the process is simply performed via pyrolysis of a solid carbon source of filter paper with adsorbed moderate cobalt chloride and thiourea. Benefiting from the high conductivity and porosity of N-, O-, and S-tridoped three-dimensional porous carbon, the high stability of carbon-protected nanomaterials and the strong interactions between Co and CoOx, the resulting Co/CoOx encapsulated in N-, O-, and S-tridoped three-dimensional porous carbon material (synthesized at 900 degrees C) can yield the current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 61 mV and show a low Tafel slope of 78 mV dec(-1) as well as a considerable stability in alkaline medium (1.0 M KOH solution) for hydrogen evolution reaction. Compared with other referential catalysts, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of Co/CoOx encapsulated in N-, O-, and S-tridoped three-dimensional porous carbon material (synthesized at 900 degrees C) further reveals a favorable kinetics during electrolysis. Moreover, these findings may inspire the exploration of low-cost, efficient, and high-yield three-dimensional porous electrodes for practical hydrogen production.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2574-0962			WOS:000458706700055

Herein, a facile synthesis strategy for preparing self-supported nickel-cobalt phosphides using terephthalic acid (H2BDC) as metal-organic framework (MOF) precursor is reported. The incorporation of the MOF precursors modulated the electronic structures and improved the performance of the bimetallic transition metal phosphides with the as-prepared electrocatalyst requiring low overpotentials of 170 mV and 323 mV to reach 50 mAcm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, the electrocatalyst is employed in an alkaline water electrolyzer and requires 1.57 V to attain a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) with long-term stability, surpassing many reported MOF-derived bimetallic transition metal phosphide (TMPs) electrocatalysts.

Electrochemical maps are correlated directly with structural data from electron backscatter diffraction applied to the same regions of the surface, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to rationalize the data. Preliminary data on droplet stability with SECCM point measurements indicated that there was a significant spreading of the meniscus cell with an air atmosphere, attributed to changes in pH during the oxygen reduction reaction, compromising the lateral resolution of the SECCM measurement. Experiments with an argon atmosphere, as well as the application of a hydrophobic n-dodecane oil layer on the Zn interface, prevented spreading. Electrochemical maps of polycrystalline Zn surface under an Ar atmosphere indicated that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and Zn electrodissolution on individual low-index grains decreased in the order ((1) over bar2 (1) over bar0) >= (01 (1) over bar0) > (0001). DFT calculations revealed a correlation between experimental values of current associated with HER and Zn dissolution reactions and the predicted hydrogen adsorption and Zn dissolution energies on individual facets, respectively. This work further advances SECCM as a technique for probing electrified interfaces and demonstrates its applicability to reactive metals. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

The starting polymers were mainly methyl trichlorosilane with a small amount of dimethyl dichlorosilane. NMR showed that the polymers had a silicon-oxygen backbone with branching and ring units. When the polymer was heated in hydrogen, toluene and isopropyl alcohol, used in production of the polymer, were given off in the temperature range 150-degrees-C to 500-degrees-C. Substantial decomposition of the polymer itself began only above about 700-degrees by evolution of methane. The network of silicon-oxygen bonds and silicon-carbon bonds did not react and was preserved; the silicon-carbon bonds were linked into the silicon-oxygen network. The silicon oxycarbide was stable above 1000-degrees-C, showing no dimensional changes above this temperature. The interior of the silicon oxycarbide was at very low effective oxygen pressure because oxygen diffused slowly in it. There was also a protective layer of silicon dioxide on the surface of the silicon oxycarbide.									191	1	0	0	1	2	221			0884-2914			WOS:A1991GU33900026

Manganese oxides are the current favorite, but their native activity needs to be substantially improved before they can be considered as the substitute of noble metals. We discovered phosphate modification as an effective strategy to increase the bifunctional oxygen activity of MnO2 in ORR and OER. Specifically, the half-wave potential of phosphate-promoted alpha-MnO2 (PMO) for ORR is 0.85 V vs. RHE, similar to 70mV more positive than alpha-MnO2 and the same as the benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. The OER potential to maintain 10 mAcm(-2) of current density is 1.63 V, similar to 40 mV more negative than alpha MnO2 and about the same as the benchmark 20 wt% Ir/C catalyst (1.60 V). The potential difference between ORR (at -3mAcm(-2)) and OER (at 10mA cm(-2)) is 0.79 V, a standard measure of bifunctional oxygen activity, notably surpasses the performance of a-MnO2 (0.91 V) and the noble metals (0.95 V for Pt/C and 0.93 V for Ir/C). Additional electrochemical measurements and density functional theory calculations suggest that the promoted bifunctional activity of PMO is due to the dual-affinity of phosphate for O and OH groups, which assists O-2/OH adsorption in ORR/OER.

We have performed density-functional theory calculations to investigate the surface segregation behaviors of Ni3M (M = Mo, Co, Fe) alloys in the presence of chemisorbed atomic oxygen. The calculated results show that the segregation trend at a Ni3M(111) surface can be substantially modified by reactive gaseous environments. At an oxygen coverage of 1/4 ML, both the Ni-segregated and M-segregated surfaces are still less stable than the nonsegregated one for Ni3Fe alloy, while an M-segregated surface is more stable than the nonsegregated one for Ni3M (M = Mo, Co) alloys. Furthermore, the analysis of oxygen adsorption trends and surface electronic structures explains that the surface segregation trend is directly correlated to the surface-adsorbate binding strength. The present study provides valuable insight for exploring practical applications of Ni-based alloys as hydrogenevolution electrodes. (C) 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Herein, we report a simple method to obtain multi-metal (Fe, Ni, Zn) embedded in N-doped carbon sheets entan-gled with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as superior oxygen electrocatalysts (FeNi-NCS-2). The resultant FeNi-NCS-2 exhibits an impressive electrochemical performance, providing a reversible oxygen overpotential as low as 0.758 V. The ZAB with FeNi-NCS-2 as the air cathode shows a promising capacity of 639.71 mAh g(-1) at 20 mA cm(-2), a power density of 109.8 mW cm(-2) and cycling stability of over 130 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2) with an energy efficiency of about 55%, superior to the ZAB based on Pt/C-IrO2. The satisfactory electrocatalytic per-formance is mainly due to the Fe, Ni-based nanoparticles protected by graphitic carbon layers, hierarchical porous lamellar structures that promote the accessibility between the active centers and the electrolyte as well as self-growing tangled carbon nanotubes that provide fast transmission channels.

Introducing oxygen vacancies (OVs) with proper concentrations into the photocatalysts has been proven as an effective strategy to boost the catalytic performances. However, the currently used treatment method under high temperature at reducing atmosphere inevitably introduces a large number of OVs at the interior of the catalyst and serving as the recombination centers of carriers. To address this issue, here we develop a facile solvothermal process to prepare ultrathin BiOBr nanosheets with rich surface OVs. This method effectively decreases the bulk of the material and the ratio of interior OVs, rendering most of the OVs exposed on the surfaces which act as exposed catalytic sites and enhance the separation of carriers, therefore significantly elevates the photocatalytic performances. For the photo-oxidation reaction of secondary amines, under the conditions of visible light, ambient temperature and atmosphere, the BiOBr nanosheets featuring rich surface OVs deliver a doubled conversion compared to those with low OV concentrations, and a high selectivity of 99%, a high stability as the performance shows no reduction after 5 times of circular reaction.									63	6	0	0	9	0	63			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000473174000014		
J	Muller, S; Holzer, F; Arai, H; Haas, O								A study of carbon-catalyst interaction in bifunctional air electrodes for zinc-air batteries								JOURNAL OF NEW MATERIALS FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS				2	4			227	232						OCT 1999	1999	The activity of bifunctional air electrodes in alkaline electrolyte was investigated as a function of the carbon black and graphite materials used as catalyst supports. The perovskite La(0.6)Ca(0.4)CoO(3) was used as the bifunctional catalyst for all air electrodes tested in this work. The carbon substrates were Vulcan XC 72 (as received), graphitized Vulcan XC 72. Ketjenblack K-600, and two different Timcal graphites (HS-100 and HS-300). Ketjenblack and Vulcan XC 72 provide high surface areas of ca. 1200 m(2).g(-1) and 250 m(2).g(-1), respectively, but the surface area of the graphitized Vulcan is only 70 m(2).g(-1). Graphitizing the amorphous Vulcan carbon at 2700 degrees C in inert atmosphere improved the crystallinity and corrosion resistance of the material, buy its activity for oxygen reduction decreased because of the smaller surface area. Reheating the material to 600 degrees C in air improved its activity for oxygen reduction. The graphite HS-100 available commercially provides a surface area of 100 m(2).g(-1) and a service life under continuous cycling comparable with that of Vulcan XC 72 that had been graphitized and activated. The stability of the high-surface-area air electrodes containing Ketjenblack is low when they are exposed to positive oxygen evolution potentials. The service life of these electrodes could be markedly improved by increasing their catalyst loading. With air electrodes containing Ketjenblack and Vulcan XC 72, AC impedance measurements were carried out in order to gather information on the kinetics, diffusion, and adsorption features of the electrode processes involved.									42	0	0	0	0	0	43			1480-2422			WOS:000085281200004

However, pure Co3O4, despite having high activity in anodic water oxidation, remains inactive toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a Ni-doped Co3O4 (Co3-xNixO4) prepared by a simple method exhibits favorable HER activity and stability (>300 h, whether in 1 M KOH or the realistic 30 wt % KOH solution) after in situ electrochemical activation, outperforming almost all of the oxide-based electrocatalysts. More importantly, using the combination of in situ Raman spectroscopy and multiple high-resolution electron microscopy techniques, it is identified that the surface of Co3-xNixO4 crystals is reduced into intertwined CoyNi1-yO nanoparticles with highly exposed {110} reactive planes. Density functional theory calculations further prove that the Ni- doped CoO component in CoyNi1-yO plays a major role during the alkaline HER, because the introduction of Ni atoms into Co-O octahedra can optimize the electrical conductivity and tailor the adsorption/desorption free energies of H-ad and OHad intermediates.									18	2	0	0	2	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000670659900047

Herein, we report a hierarchical multi-component nanosheet arrays grown on Ni foam composed of abundant NiCo/MoNi4 heterostructure interfaces on the amorphous MoOx substrate (denoted as NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF), which can simultaneously achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a low working potential of -30 mV (vs. RHE) for HzOR and a small overpotential of 68 mV for HER. Importantly, the post-catalysis characterizations further disclose that the partial formation of transition metal hydroxide species probably endow favorable absorption for hydroxyl intermediates, leading to the high performance and durability. Moreover, a two-electrode system based on NiCo-MoNi4 HMNAs/NF can reach the current density of 250 mA cm-2 with a cell voltage of 0.63 V for overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) system.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000641316100005

Transition metal phosphides as catalysts for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have attracted considerable attention due to their high performance. However, the catalyst with excellent properties still remains a significant challenge. Herein, the nanoporous NiFeMoP(np-NiFeMoP) ribbon was prepared by quenching and dealloying method. It was found that np-NiFeMoP showed excellent HER and OER performance in 1 M KOH. The overpotential of OER is as low as 197 mV at a current density of 20 mA.cm(-2). When the current density is 10 mA.cm(-2), the overpotential of HER is 223 mV. Moreover, np-NiFeMoP only needs a cell voltage of 1.41 V when current density is 10 mA.cm(-2) for water splitting. Our current work may provide some new insights on rationally constructing nanoporous structure with rich active sites to boost the catalytic performances for overall water splitting.

Net H-2 evolution rates result from the contributions of the individual rates of water oxidation, oxygenate oxidation, and the back-reaction of H-2 and O-2 to water. The latter reaction is suppressed by a RhCrOx cocatalyst or by high concentrations of oxygenates in the case of Rh cocatalyst, whereas the rates of organic oxidation depend on their molecular structure. In the absence of the back-reaction to water, the H-2 evolution rates are independent of the oxygenate type and concentration because the rates of water splitting compensate the variations in the rates of oxygenate conversion. Under such conditions of suppressed back reaction, the selectivities to water and oxygenate oxidation, both occurring with the same quantum efficiencies, depend on the oxygenate type and concentration. The dominant pathways for organic transformations are ascribed to the action of intermediates generated at the semiconductor during water oxidation and O-2 evolution. On a semiconductor without cocatalyst, the O-2 produced during overall water splitting is reductively activated to participate in oxidation of organics without consuming evolved H-2.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000430154100037

The cheap alternatives of precious-metal electrocatalysts with high activity and robust stability is essential for the high-scale application of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Recently, carbon-based electrocatalysts derived from biomass have attracted more and more attentions with thanks to their characteristics as low-cost, renewable, abundantly distributed and environmentally friendly. In this work, the original carbon material derived from biomass and the one doped with N and/or S as HER electrocatalysts are intensively overviewed regarding to the electrochemical performance and hydrogen yield. The overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) is generally greater than 100 mV, which is far inferior to Pt-based catalysts. Consequently, biomass-based carbon materials decorated by transition metal and/or trace amount precious metal were introduced for improving the HER performance. The synergistic effect between metals and heteroatoms can significantly enhance the electrocatalytic activity, and the smallest value of eta(10) is 10 mV. The limitations and challenges in this area were also addressed as (1) the in-depth investigation of conversion and electrocatalytic mechanism, (2) metal modification via in-situ growth, (3) the reproducibility for biomass transformation, and (4) the catalyst assembly with renewable energy equipment.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000640515600057

Herein, in situ growth of heterostructured MoC/Mo2C nanoribbons and nanoflowers on copper foam (MoxC/Cu), copper foil, and nickel foam (MxC/Ni) are prepared via a two-step method: hydrothermal preparation of molybdenum precursors followed by pyrolysis at controlled temperatures. The MoxC/Cu hybrids are found to exhibit an excellent catalytic activity, as compared to the MoxC/Ni and Cu foil counterparts, and the sample prepared at 750 degrees C stands out as the best among the series with a low overpotential of 169 mV to reach the current density of 200 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, and 194 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, and the corresponding Tafel slopes of 98 and 74 mV dec(-1) , respectively. The electrocatalytic activity is also found to vary with the Mo2+/Mo3+ and N contents in the samples that impact the electrical conductivity and electron-transfer kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction. Results suggest that MoC/Mo2C heterostructured materials supported on copper foam may be a viable candidate to catalyze hydrogen evolution reaction in a wide range of pH.									37	2	0	0	0	0	36			2168-0485			WOS:000467351200050

The hybrids containing Co3S4@MoS2 components demonstrate excellent electrocatalytic activity of HER. However, the more sustainable photocatalytic HER of two-dimensional (2D) Co3S4@MoS2-based materials remain scarce. In this study, Cu0.9Co2.1S4@MoS2 composites were easily synthesized in situ by using bimetallic (Cu/Co) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursors through hydrothermal reaction; without extra precious metal and semiconductor as co-catalyst, the MoS2-content-optimized Cu0.9Co2.1S4@MoS2 efficiently catalyzed hydrogen production at a rate of 40156 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) (with a TON of 109) in aqueous solution containing eosin Y under visible light. The developed strategy of homogeneously alloyed MOFs as precursors caused adequate hybridization of the object material with homogeneous Cu-doping in Co3S4 lattice, resulting in abundant interfaces and active sites as well as the low resistance of electron transfer, which thus considerably enhances photcatalytic HER performance, compared with undoped Co3S4@MoS2. HER mechanism was further elucidated by fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetime test, impedance spectra, and photocurrent response measurements as well as control experiments.									32	2	0	0	2	0	33			2574-0962			WOS:000459948900025

However, it is still a great challenge to develop a cost-effective, ultrastable and efficent single-atom cobalt catalyst for ORR, requiring efficient fabrication strategies and robust support to stabilize the single cobalt atom. Here, we prepared a highly active and stable atomically isolated cobalt catalyst via covalent triazine framework (CTF) support with Ketjen Black (KB) hybridization in scale. The prepared single Co catalyst (Co-CTF/KB) possesses high metal loading over 4 wt% and shows superior ORR performance with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.830 V and a limiting current density of 6.14 mA cm(-2) as well as high tolerance of methanol in an alkaline medium, which outperforms commercial Pt/C and most non precious metal catalysts reported to date. Benefiting from strong stabilization of Co atoms on CTF, Co CTF/KB shows outstanding stability with only 5 mV negative shifts after 10,000 cycles. Moreover, it also displays high catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), suggesting it is an efficient ORR/OER bifunctional catalyst. The present work provides a facile strategy for preparing single atom catalysts in bulk quantity and contributes to development of catalysts for electrochemical conversion and storage devices.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000633770100002

In this work, we successfully synthesized Fe-doped (Ni,Mn)Co2O4 nanorod arrays on nickel foam (labeled as FNMCO/NF) via a anion-exchange route with sub-sequent annealing process. Experiments showed that the initial concentration of [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) anions could affect the electrocatalytic activity of the as-synthesized FNMCO/NF integral electrode. The FNMCO-6/NF prepared from 6 mM of K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] solution presented the strongest OER electrocatalytic activity. Only overpotential of 242 mV or 449 mV was required to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution or 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Also, after continuously catalyzing for 155 h at 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution or 150 h at 20 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M PBS, the overpotential of the as-obtained FNMCO-6/NF electrode rarely varied, implying its superb durability.

The oxygen exchange needs to be carried out in the presence of palladium. However, the presence of Pd on Al2O3 slightly enhances (CO2)-O-18 exchange according to the number of exchanged atoms in the gas phase In this case, the calculation of intial rate for (CO2)-O-18 exchange is not adequate to evaluate oxygen mobility; information on the number of exchange atoms and on the evolution of the concentrations of the different isotopomers is also needed. The enhancement of oxygen exchange is due to carbonate formation on the catalytic surface as evidenced by in situ FTIR spectroscopic measurements. A five-step mechanism is suggested to explain these findings. according to the number of exchanged atoms in the gas									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000277932900010

Herein, Co9S8 nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in nitrogen/sulfur dual-doped porous carbon nanofibers had been designed and synthesized by an electrospinning method with subsequent thermal annealing and denoted as Co9S8/NSC nanofibers. The as-prepared Co9S8/NSC nanofibers with high intrinsic activity and electrical conductivity exhibited excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity, with a half-wave potential of 0.84 V (vs. RHE) for the ORR and a potential of 1.56 V (vs. RHE) for the OER at 10 mA cm(-2) current density. When Co9S8/NSC nanofibers were employed as an air electrode catalyst for rechargeable Zn-air batteries, a high energy density (997 W h kg(-1)), a low charge/discharge voltage gap, and an impressive long-term cycle stability (over 1000 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2)) were achieved.									15	2	0	0	0	0	15			2398-4902			WOS:000518690900011

The three-dimensional (3D) Co-rich C/CoSi composite is synthesized using the renewable bamboo leaves as raw materials and silicon suppliers undergoing the calcination, hydrothermal and adsorption processes. The decoration of Co can greatly improve the OER performance of carbon/cobalt silicate (C/CoSi). The overpotential of Co-rich C/CoSi is 349 mV at 10 mA.cm(2) and Tafel slope is 77 mV.dec(-1), which are lower than those of C/CoSi (448 mV and 84 mV.dec(-1)). The values are even superior to many reported transition metal-based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the Co-rich C/CoSi shows large electroactive surface area and long stability (98.7% OER capacity retention after 15 h).

J	De Koninck, Mathieu; Poirier, Simon-Claude; Marsan, Benoit								CuxCo3-xO4 used as bifunctional electrocatalyst - Physicochemical properties and electrochemical characterization for the oxygen evolution reaction								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				153	11			A2103	A2110		10.1149/1.2338631				2006	2006	CuxCo3-xO4 (x = 0 and 1) powders were prepared by a sol-gel method which favors high oxide specific surface areas with a larger value for Co3O4, ascribed to a larger powder mesopore volume. X-ray diffraction measurements reveal that CuCo2O4 particles are less crystalline than Co3O4 with crystallite size 10 times smaller. The sol-gel method allows formation of spinel oxide particles that do not contain any resistive CuO phase. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses have shown that Co3O4 contains Co2+ and Co3+ species at the surface, tetrahedral Co2+ cations being predominant. In the case of CuCo2O4, Cu+, Cu2+, and possibly Cu3+ cations are also detected, octahedral Cu2+ showing the highest concentration among the copper species. Composite film electrodes, based on mechanically mixed Co3O4 or CuCo2O4 particles, carbon black Vulcan XC-72R, and poly(vinylidene fluoride-cohexafluoropropylene) , were formed on a glassy carbon disk surface. The highest intrinsic electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction is obtained for the CuCo2O4 composite electrode containing the larger amount of oxide particles. Cyclic voltammetry experiments suggest that the surface Co2+/Co3+ ratio is decreased when the electrodes are immersed into the KOH electrolyte, which may be associated to the formation of a superficial CoOOH layer.

Hence, discovering facile routes to fabricate the earth-abundant OER catalysts with high activity and durability is of great importance to realize commercial water splitting. Herein, a modified molten-salt-protected pyrolysis (MSPP) approach was proposed, which leads to simultaneous fabrication of cobalt-iron spinel oxide nanoassembly and borate modification on the surface of the catalyst. Physical characterizations indicated that both the MSPP method and the surface borates could optimize the electronic structure of CoFe spinel oxide, leading to the enrichment of local high-valence metal species with enhanced electropositivity and thus resulting in improved intrinsic activity toward OER catalysis. Besides, due to multiple structural merits including a large surface area, enriched high-valence metal sites, improved intrinsic activity, and facilitated charge transfer behavior, the borate-modified CoFe spinel oxide catalyst synthesized via the MSPP route exhibits outstanding OER activity with low overpotential, large current density, and small Tafel slope. In addition, the activation process was confirmed during long-term catalysis, resulting in a remarkable 140% performance enhancement with high operational stability even for 72 h. This work proposed a modified molten-salt synthesis strategy to achieve synergistic enrichment of catalytically active species and surface modification, and the as-fabricated borate-modified CoFe spinel oxide could act as an efficient and durable OER catalyst for robust water electrolysis.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2168-0485			WOS:000715216700028

In this report, we present an analytical method to characterize the crystal structure of LDHs using Rietveld refinement, XPS, and XANES. Using this analytical method, we found that ZnCo LDH nanoplates prepared by a new facile synthetic route had a Zn3.1Co1.9Cl2(OH)(8)center dot H2O structure and contained a large portion of divalent Co cations, unlike the previously reported ZnCo LDHs. Thanks to this accurate crystal structure analysis, we found that the cause of the enhanced electrochemical properties of the ZnCo LDH nanoplates toward the oxygen evolution reaction was the large portion of divalent Co cations.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000533422400052

The liquid phase reduction PtAg nanoparticles were directly embedded in the c-PANI on a Pt sheet (c-PANI@PtAg/Pt) by in situ polymerization. c-PANI@ PtAg/Pt demonstrated excellent electrocatalysis for formate oxidation reaction (FOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The ordered structure of c-PANI showed a peak-separation effect and therefore significantly enhanced the catalytic path selectivity of c-PANI@PtAg/Pt for FOR Meanwhile the current holding ratio after 1000 circles of voltamogram scanning reaches 91.4%. Research on the electrocatalysis of cPANI@PtlAg0.5/Pt for HER indicated the overpotentials at 1.0 mA cm(-2) in both acid and alkaline solutions were more positive than that of pure Pt. Moreover, c-PANI@PtAg/Pt exhibits a much lower overpotential of 68 mV than that of 115 mV of Pt and a smaller Tafel slope of 27 mV dec(-1) than that of 46 mV dec(-1) of Pt.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2574-0970			WOS:000529206200066

The bridging S-2(2-) has been considered as the major active site for HER. However, to realize more efficient electrocatalysts, newer architectures based on molybdenum sulfide are required to allow more active S sites beyond the endemic structural limits. Hence, the facile aging approach is used to maximize the bridging S-2(2-) in amorphous molybdenum sulfide by adding (NH4)(2)S-x, leading to the highest proportion of bridging S-2(2-) (up to 67%). Additionally, the effect of S configuration on HER activity in molybdenum sulfide is systematically studied by controlling of the amount of bridging S-2(2-). The bridging S-rich electrocatalysts exhibits an excellent HER activity with low onset potential of -96 mV and Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1), and stability for 1000 cycles.									30	2	0	0	1	0	30			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000487570000053

According to theoretical prediction, the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of hematite can be 16.8% and the water splitting photocurrent can be 12.6 mA cm(2). However, the practical performance of hematite for solar water splitting is far from the ideal case which has been limited by several factors such as poor conductivity, short lifetime of the excited-state carrier (10-12s), poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, short hole diffusion length (2-4nm), and improper band position for unassisted water splitting. In our recent work, enormous efforts have been focused on improving the performance of hematite nanostructure photoelectrode. Different methods such as morphology control, elemental doping, and improvement of the charge transport of hematite have been developed to improve the performance of hematite photoelectrode in solar water splitting.					14th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO)14th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO)	AUG 14-21, 2014AUG 14-21, 2014	IEEEIEEE	Toronto, CANADAToronto, CANADA	4	0	0	0	0	0	4					978-1-4799-5622-7	WOS:000365620600017

The aim of this research is to produce high-quality energy materials by utilizing hazardous waster as precursors. A novel inorganic-organic composite flocculant was first manufactured and used as an efficient binary-coagulant for enhanced dyes removal and Fe-containing textile sludge (TS-Fe) production from dyeing wastewater. Then, three-dimensional interconnected hierarchical porous iron-nitrogen doped carbon materials (TS-Fe-N-C) were fabricated by pyrolysis of TS-Fe to realize the resource recovery. Upon accurate control the composition of TS-FeN-C, the optimal TS-Fe-N-C-0.23 has excellent performance for oxygen reduction reaction (half-wave potential of 0.837 V), oxygen evolution reaction (overpotential of 0.328 V at 10 mA cm-2), and hydrogen evolution reaction (overpotential of 0.144 V at 10 mA cm-2). Moreover, Zn-air battery and water splitting device based on TS-Fe-NC-0.23 electrodes displayed satisfactory energy density (770.0 mAh g-1), power density (120.5 mW cm-2), and low water splitting voltage (1.70 V @ 10 mA cm-2). This study suggests that rational design of flocs by conventional wastewater treatment technologies is an effective strategy for optimizing the composition of sludge and boosting the additional value to the sludge-derived biochar product.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000729016800004

However, the development of a low-cost and high-performance bifunctional electrocatalyst toward HER and UOR is still a challenge. In this work, oxygen-incorporated nickel molybdenum phosphide nanotube arrays are synthesized on nickel foam (O-NiMoP/NF) via electrodeposition accompanied with in-situ template etching. Benefiting from the modulated electronic structure and the nanotube array architecture of O-NiMoP, the self-supporting O-NiMoP/NF electrodes demonstrate highly efficient bifunctional catalytic activity toward HER and UOR. Particularly, in the HER and UOR (HER||UOR) coupled system for H-2 production, a significantly reduced cell voltage of 1.55 V is obtained at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2), which is about 300 mV lower than that of the conventional water electrolysis. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the remarkable HER and UOR activities originated from the Ni sites with the modulated electronic environment induced by Mo, P and O atoms, which facilitate the water dissociation during HER and balance the adsorption/desorption of the intermediates during UOR. The development of Ni-based phosphides nanotube arrays as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in HER||OER system provides a new approach enabling energy-saving H-2 production.									64	1	0	0	7	0	64			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000678691200001

In this work, Fe-doped Ni3S2 nanowires with diameters of ca. 17 nm and lengths of 1.4 similar to 2 mu m are synthesized on Ni foam through a one-step solvothermal route for alkaline water splitting, which display notable active and excellent durability for both OER and HER under high current densities. The optimal Fe-13.7%-Ni3S2 nanowires electrode can attain 200 mA cm(-2) at a fairly low overpotential of 223 mV, and 500 mA cm(-2) at 245 mV toward OER. Furthermore, it yields a considerable low overpotential of 109 mV to garner 10 mA cm(-2), and 246 mV for 500 mA cm(-2) toward HER. The incorporation of iron simultaneously modifies the electronic structure and morphology of Ni3S2, which not only enhances the conductivity but also generates abundant active edge sites. The slight surface-restricted oxidation of nanowires in a strongly basic electrolyte in situ generates a large number of interfaces, which enables the reactivity and durability for both OER and HER. Accordingly, an alkaline water electrolyzer with two Fe-13.7%-Ni3S2 electrodes only requires a low cell voltage of 1.53 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), and 1.95 V to 500 mA cm(-2) with striking stability. The as-prepared Fe-doped Ni3S2 nanowires can be potentially utilized for actual water electrolysis under high current densities.									30	2	0	0	2	0	30			2196-0216			WOS:000485947800026

However, the main problem of common perovskite-type oxygen carriers is their relatively low oxygen desorption capacity at atmospheric pressure. Therefore, it is important to develop new oxygen carriers and enhance the reaction pressure to achieve high desorption capacity. In this study, a series of A/beta site substitution Ba1-xSrxCo1-y,FeyO3-delta(x = 0, 0.5, 1; y = 0, 0.2, 1) perovskites were synthesized by solgel method, and the oxygen desorption performance of them was investigated in pressurized fixed bed. The perovskite samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. The effect of reaction pressure, temperature and flow rate on the oxygen desorption performance were investigated in details. The results indicated that all of the Ba1-xSrxCo1-y,FeyO3-delta perovskites showed an obvious improvement on oxygen desorption capacity at pressurized conditions. Besides, BaCo03_8 showed the best oxygen desorption performance among theBa(1-x)Sr(x)Co(1-y),FeyO3-delta(x = 0, 0.5, 1; y = 0, 0.2, 1) perovskites. Oxygen desorption amounts of BaCoO3-delta increased by 57.2% and 62.7% under 2 MPa and 3 MPa conditions respectively, comparing to that of it under atmospheric pressure at 850 degrees C. The optimal temperature and WHSV for BaCoO3-delta are 850 degrees C and 176.78 h(-1). XRF and XRD results showed that the elemental contents of perovskites remained after reactions and the crystal structure of perovskites could recover after cyclic process under high pressure calcination. XPS results showed the evolution of oxygen species during oxygen desorption process. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000402343300036

Such a specific nanostructure of the as-prepared ZCONS provided an efficient charge transfer process, as well as an efficient mass transport process. Therefore, in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) test, ZCONS shows good electrocatalytic ability. Additionally, because of the ultrathin nanosheets possess enough extra free space for alleviating, so that endow long-term cycling stability, make the catalyst possesses superior durability and excellent methanol tolerance ability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1750-0443		WOS:000474868300017

As previously proposed, anion incorporation in promising earth-abundant transition metal-based electrocatalysts could be a reasonable and competitive approach to regulate the electronic structure with optimized atomic hydrogen adsorption and desorption for enhanced intrinsic electrocatalytic performance during the HER. Herein, we present the rational design and fabrication of O-incorporated CoP (expressed as O-CoP) nanorods with a controllable component and electronic structure. As demonstrated, when the lattice-incorporated O is at an appropriate concentration, the engineered O-CoP nanocatalysts have more active sites exposed with an increased number of electrochemically active areas and better electron/ion conductivity, leading to boosted HER activity and running stability. Typically, the obtained O-CoP nanorods with an optimal oxygen content exhibit excellent HER activity with an overpotential of 116 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)and a small Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1)in alkaline media. This anion doping strategy may make a widespread contribution to the efficient engineering of electrocatalysts for energy conversion devices.									15	1	0	0	1	0	16			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000549588900034	32618988

Transition metal oxides (TMOs) seem to be a promising and appealing solution to the challenge because of the diversity of their d-orbital states. We chose IrO2 as a model because it is universally accepted as a current state-of-the-art OER catalyst. In this study, copper-doped IrO2, particularly Cu0.3Ir0.7O delta, is shown to significantly improve the OER activity in acidic, neutral and basic solutions compared to un-doped IrO2. The substituted amount of Cu in IrO2 has a limit described by the Cu0.3Ir0.7O delta composition. We determined that the performance of Cu0.3Ir0.7O delta is due primarily to an increase in the Jahn-Teller effect in the CuO6 octahedra, and partially to oxygen defects in the lattice induced by the IrO6 octahedral geometric structure distortions, which enhance the lift degeneracy of the t(2g) and e(g) orbitals, making the d(z)(2) orbital partially occupied. This phenomenon efficiently reduces the difference between Delta G2 and Delta G3 in the free energy from the density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations and can yield a lower theoretical overpotential comparable to that of IrO2. The proposed method of doping with foreign elements to tune the electron occupation between the t(2g) and e(g) orbital states of Ir creates an opportunity for designing effective OER catalysts using the TMO groups.									143	4	0	0	11	0	143			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000357931700075	30155005

This work, using two different electrode materials (a polyacrylonitrile-based carbon felt and a rayon-based graphite felt), elucidates the redox reactions at the anode as performance-limiting ones through various sophisticated physical and electrochemical analyses as well as the VRFB testings with/without homogeneous catalyst in the electrolytes and different electrode combinations. The electrode material with the properties of higher hydrophilicity arising from abundant surface oxygen functionalities and electrical conductivity exhibit higher VRFB performance, particularly due to improved reaction kinetics at the anode. Moreover, the incorporation of catalyst, especially for the V3+/V2+ couple, results in a significant improvement of VRFB performance by accelerating the kinetics of V3+/V2+ redox reactions as well as mitigating the harmful effects of hydrogen evolution reactions and temperature-related effects.

Monometallic phosphides such as Ni2P have been shown to be active toward water splitting. Our theoretical analysis has suggested that their performance can be further enhanced by substitution with extrinsic metals, though very little work has been conducted in this area. Here we present for the first time a novel PH3 plasma-assisted approach to convert NiCo hydroxides into ternary NiCoP. The obtained NiCoP nanostructure supported on Ni foam shows superior catalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low overpotential of 32 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media. Moreover, it is also capable of catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with high efficiency though the real active sites are surface oxides in situ formed during the catalysis. Specifically, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved at overpotential of 280 mV. These overpotentials are among the best reported values for non-noble metal catalysts. Most importantly, when used as both the cathode and anode for overall water splitting, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved at a cell voltage as low as 1.58 V, making NiCoP among the most efficient earth-abundant catalysts for water splitting. Moreover, our new synthetic approach can serve as a versatile route to synthesize various bimetallic or even more complex phosphides for various applications.									863	45	0	0	36	0	870			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000389963200060	27960455

Herein, corrosion engineering is applied to synthesize NiFe-LDH incorporating noble metals on a 3D porous Ni foam at room temperature to afford the NF-Na-Fe-Pt electrocatalyst. The optimized balance adsorption of hydroxyl ions and atomic hydrogen that are manifested by the synergism between NiFe-LDH and trifle noble metals endow the nanomaterial with an excellent electrocatalytic performance and long-term durability for mediating the water-splitting process in 1 M KOH. Only 31 and 261 mV are required to drive 10 mA cm-2 of the prepared NF-Na-Fe-Pt electrocatalyst for HER and OER, respectively. DFT calculations demonstrate that Pt and NiFe-LDH synergistically accelerate the Volmer reaction and adsorption/desorption of atomic H to enhance alkaline HER. Moreover, the NF-Na-Fe-Pt electrocatalyst also exhibit remarkable catalytic activity for water splitting.									58	0	1	0	4	0	58			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000697777700001

Ni3S2 (NS) is considered a good performing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, but exhibits unsatisfactory hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. In this study, Fe5Ni4S8 (FNS) material was incorporated into an NS nanoarray, generating a low-cost, efficient, and stable bifunctional FNS/NS heterostructure for electrolyzed water catalysts. The hydrophilicity of pretreated FNS was quite high, whereas the stepped rod -shaped NS structure had a large number of radial active sites. Additionally, the high-conductivity of FNS and nickel foam (NF) provided a double-channel structure for rapid internal charge transfer. The interconnecting a network of FNS, rod-shaped NS nanoarray, and NF substrate enabled one to accomplish a synergistic effect of enhanced kinetics and activity of OER, HER, and overall water splitting. To achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution, only overpotentials of 248 and 94 mV were required. Moreover, the voltage of the constructed FNS/NS||FNS/NS double-electrode battery system was only 1.64 V@10 mA cm(-2), but the battery could have run for at least 120 h at an industrial current density of 500 mA cm(-2). Therefore, this study offers a rational design of heterostructures as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000850154700004

However, as an electrocatalyst, pure 2D materials cannot meet HER needs caused by their monotonous performance. Therefore, some nanoparticles are used to load and tune the 2D materials to develop efficient and inexpensive catalysts. Herein, we conduct a thorough analysis for materials based on heteroatoms, especially transition metal atoms and non-metal atoms (N, P, S, etc.) doped with graphene, TMDCs, MXenes, LDHs, BP and h-BN. It can be found that doping or coupling between 2D materials will affect the electronic structure, energy band, active area, conductivity and stability of the catalyst, which will induct a huge change in the catalytic performance. This review reveals the relationship between active centers, H2O adsorption and chemical reaction processes. It also analyzes and summarizes the design principles and performance improvement mechanisms of hybrid catalysts. These discussions can provide references for other researchers to develop derivatives of related catalysts.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Many non-noble metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) present unsatisfactory water-splitting catalytic performance because of their intrinsic electronic structures. Here, through the density functional theory calculations, a nitrogen atom doping strategy is applied to directly tune the electronic structure of the SAC and boost their catalytic activities towards both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By precisely manipulating N doping modes in graphyne supported single Co atom catalyst (Co@GY), the stability, electronic properties, and HER, as well as OER catalytic activities of these N-doped Co@GY catalysts are investigated. It is found that the N-induced charge redistribution on the surface of the N-doped Co@GY catalysts greatly affects their HER and OER performances. The N-induced charge density not only increases the number of active sites of Co@N-1-GY and enhances its catalytic activity for HER, but also weakens the chemisorption of oxygenated species and decreases distinctly the over-potential for OER, making Co@N-1-GY a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting. This work offers a feasible strategy for experimental groups to properly tune the electronic structures of catalysts and improve catalytic activity.									34	3	0	0	0	0	34			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000498639000061

The structural and thermal stability of the MBenes was estimated with the cohesive energy, the phonon dispersion curves and the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation calculations. The effects of functionalized groups on the structure of MBenes were also discussed. The magnetic configuration at ground state of both MBenes and their precursors was studied with a sample model. All stable MBenes exhibit metallic transport performance. The valence electrons are generally localized around B-B chains in the unit cell of MBenes, which results in the good stability of MBenes. The free energy of hydrogen adsorption of Mn2B2 is 2 meV for the coverage of 1/8, implying that this 2D boride is a promising candidate for HER application.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000571196500011

In recent years, constructing single-atomic catalysts (SACs) has been demonstrated to be an efficacious way to boost the catalytic activity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts, although most of them are based on noble metals. Very recently, great advances have been achieved in noble metal-free SACs by design of compatible material systems and implementation of novel synthetic strategies, which are determinative for the amount and pattern of metallic single atoms to be anchored on the supports and consequently the electronic states and coordination environment of the atoms. This progress report summarizes perspectives of compositions of the SACs with appropriate synthetic methods, and their relationships with the HER catalytic performance. In addition, some state-of-the-art technologies, for example, in situ techniques, high throughput techniques, and machine learning, are suggested to help the design, preparation, and characterization of SACs.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			2366-7486			WOS:000565387300001		
J	Khairil; Kamihashira, D; Nakayama, K; Naruse, I				Khairil, Khairil/GPW-9755-2022				Fundamental reaction characteristics of pulverized coal at high temperature								ISIJ INTERNATIONAL				41	2			136	141						2001	2001	In order to enhance the overall thermal efficiency in blast furnace system as well as coal gasifiers, it is necessary to elucidate fundamental reaction characteristics of pulverized coal at high temperature. The experiments were carried out using a horizontal pulverized coal reactor with a pre-combustor to produce vitiated air at high temperature and high-oxygen concentration. The reaction behavior of coal during combustion and/or gasification are elucidated by means of sampling and analyzing both reacting particles and reaction gases as well as optical measurement of the instantaneous particle temperature. Evolution rate of the volatile matter for various types of coal at high temperature is obtained from the Arrhenius plots.As a result, the volatile matter is rapidly evolved as soon as coal particles are introduced into the furnace since temperature of the vitiated air increases sufficiently. Result shows that the evolution rate of volatile matter does not depend on coal types. Activation energy and frequency factor of the evolution rate of volatile matter for various types of coal remain almost constant in the particle temperature range of 2200 to 2700 K, even when other experimental conditions were varied. In the char combustion region, char structure was found to affect the reaction rate of fixed carbon. It is observed that coal, which forms a network-type of char, indicated reaction rate of fixed carbon which did not always increase even when the vitiated air temperature was high enough. For a balloon-type char, on the other hand, the reaction rate of fixed carbon decreased with an increase of the vitiated air temperature.									13	3	0	0	0	0	14			0915-1559	1347-5460		WOS:000167015400006

While most of these demonstrations have involved the use of 3D-printing to fabricate structural components of electrochemical devices, this manuscript describes the design, manufacture and performance of 3D-printed porous flow-through electrodes employed in an electrolyzer that is itself made almost entirely by 3D-printing. These electrodes were 3D-printed using fused deposition modeling (FDM) from a composite of conductive carbon and polylactic acid (PLA), followed by electrodeposition of nickel (Ni) electrocatalyst. The stability and performance of these Ni-PLA electrodes were evaluated for water electrolysis in 1.0 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH). After characterizing the performance of a single electrode pair for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), three pairs of electrodes were incorporated into a simple and scalable 3D-printed membraneless electrolyzer by "clicking" them into a monolithic lid containing manifolding for collection of the O-2 and H-2 product gases. The device utilizes a membraneless architecture capable of operating in a stagnant electrolyte through buoyancy-driven separation of product gases, and allowing for easy regeneration of electrodes by electrodeposition. Device operation was evaluated through a combination of electroanalytical measurements, in situ high-speed video imaging, and finite element modeling. Although the efficiency and cross-over rates of these membraneless electrolyzers fall below what is required for commercial applications, additive manufacturing of electrodes offers an exciting new design space to improve performance and enable robust operation for applications where membrane-based electrolyzers are inherently unstable.									27	2	0	0	2	0	27			2398-4902			WOS:000503876500017

Cobalt-based transition metal compounds, especially sulfide, are the most efficient and stable electrocatalysts of them. In this work, we report a CoS nanoparticles array on beryllium copper needles as a high potency electrocatalyst in basic electrolyte. Owing to the excellent electron transfer capability of beryllium copper needles, the as -prepared catalyst is effective in catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with the overpotential of 73 mV, to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and can maintain excellent performance. Correspondingly, the Tafel slope of the electrode reaction is 76 mV dec(-1). In addition, the electrode also shows good durability and stability, which is reflected in a small decrease in activity after 5000 CV (Cyclic Voltammetry) cycles and almost no decay after 30 h of electrolysis. This work demonstrates its potential for practical applications in efficient hydrogen production. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In situ XAFS and DRIFTS were used to study the dynamic evolution of the metal active sites in bimetallic AgxAu25-x nanoclusters supported on ITQ2 zeolite during CO catalytic oxidation. The activity of the bimetallic nanocluster catalyst in this reaction was significantly higher than those of supported monometallic Ag25 and Au25 nanoclusters. These results were explained by the formation of AgAu alloyed nanoparticles, which favoured reactant adsorption and reaction. Furthermore, the initial activity depended on the catalyst pretreatment, obtaining better conversion, at lower temperatures, with the catalyst pretreated with hydrogen than with the catalyst pretreated with oxygen. This was also associated with an easier formation of a AgAu alloy under hydrogen pretreatment at 150 degC. However, the alloying process seemed to be completed after reaction in both cases, i.e. for the catalyst pretreated with oxygen and with hydrogen, obtaining the same catalytic performance with both catalysts upon reuse. The activity is constant in successive reaction runs, indicating high stability of the active species formed under reaction conditions. The results have shown that the combination of catalytic studies with in situ characterization techniques provides insight into the structural dynamics of the catalysts during activation and reaction.

It results from the cooperative effect of hydroxide ions trapped through inorganic precipitation at the cathode and proton flux from water dissociation in a bipolar membrane (BPM; used as a separator). The acidification of the catholyte in the proposed BPM-DSE substantially mitigates cathode passivation, eliminates the requirement of additional processes for treatment of inorganic precipitates dispersed in the catholyte, and reduces the cathode potential (Ec) required for the HER to enable long-term DSE. The BPM in this system plays a critical role in maintaining the electrolyte concentration, suppressing the chlorine evolution reaction (ClER), and maximizing the oxygen evolution reaction. These findings are expected to suggest a breakthrough toward large-scale operation of DSE that successfully overcomes challenges such as energy consumption, inorganic precipitation, ClER, and corrosion.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729144300003

For methanol oxidation reaction, NiCo2O4/rGO catalyst displayed the maximum current density of 9.6 and 16.2 mA cm(-2) at 290 and 310 K, respectively in alkaline media. For hydrogen evolution, the Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1) and 61 mV dec(-1) and onset overpotential of 69 mV and 120 mV were obtained for NiCo2O4/rGO and NiCo2O4, respectively. The volume of evolved hydrogen obtained about 4 ml and 9 ml for NiCo2O4 and NiCo2O4/rGO, respectively, which are consistent with the polarization curves. The presence of rGO as a conductive material and the synergistic effect between Ni2+ and Co3+ ions are effective for electrocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst. The excellent performance of catalysts suggests their potentials for energy production. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here we present an interface engineering strategy to construct efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst based on (Ni, Fe)S-2@MoS2 heterostructrues for water-splitting process. The as-prepared (Ni, Fe)S-2@MoS2 catalyst gives remarkable electrochemical activity and durability under alkaline environments, with a low overpotential of 130 mV for HER and 270 mV for OER to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. In combination with in-situ Raman spectra, we demonstrate that the constructed interfacial active sites are favorable to the formation of S-H-ads, which synergistically lower the chemisorption energy of the intermediates of HER and OER, thereby facilitating the electrocatalytic overall water splitting. Furthermore, we regulate the interface of (Ni, Fe)S-2@MoS2 and electrolyte through changing the composition of electrolyte to achieve much longer electrochemical stability of this hybrid sulfide electrocatalyst.									265	18	0	0	11	0	268			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000460715100010

Thanks to this ingenious strategy, the aggregation of Mo2C that usually occurs at high calcination temperature was effectively suppressed. This well-defined nanohybrid exhibits an excellent activity and high stability in hydrogen evolution reactions both in acidic and basic media due to the synergistic effects of the heteroatoms doped, accessibility of active sites, and conductivity of the two-dimensional (2D) structure. The obtained Mo2C-N,P-rGO requires only small overpotentials of 71 and 95 mV to drive 10 mAcm(-2) in alkaline and acidic solution, respectively. Benefiting from the protective effect of the coated carbon layers on the Mo2C surface, no obvious degradation was detected after 20 h of operation. This facile strategy may provide new opportunities for the precise design of functional 2D materials with unique properties.									22	3	0	0	3	0	24			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000434071100021

The binary alloy catalyst was deposited on a graphitic substrate covered with carbon nanofibers previously treated in oxygen plasma. This support system provides a high surface area for the alloy particles, improving considerably the catalytic activity. A simultaneous reduction reaction of Pt and Ni was performed by strictly controlling the metals ratios in the solution and by choosing suitable deposition parameters. A pulsed current technique was applied. Varying the Pt: Ni ratio in the electrolyte and adjusting the deposition main parameters lead to a homogeneous distribution of the catalyst. A comparison with pure platinum nano-scaled supported electrodes is also presented, regarding hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction. Although a significant decrease of platinum amount was achieved by alloying, a higher activity of the catalyst was obtained. Morphology, structure, and chemical composition of the catalysts was investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction was used to identify the alloy phase composition. The amount of deposited alloy determined using thermogravimetric measurements correlated with the cyclic voltammetry performed in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution to estimate the electrochemical surface area offered important information regarding the catalytic activity.					7th International Conference on Advanced Materials and Structures - AMS 20187th International Conference on Advanced Materials and Structures - AMS 2018	28-31 March 201828-31 March 2018		Timisoara, RomaniaTimisoara, Romania	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1757-8981			INSPEC:18241512

These problems can be alleviated by a redox mediator, which usually catalyses either the formation or decomposition of solid Li2O2. However, few redox mediators have dual functions and catalyse both discharge and charge processes. Here, we propose MoCl5 as a dual-function redox mediator for Li-O-2 batteries. In the discharge process, with MoCl5, Li2O2 is initially formed in the solution and then deposited on the cathode surface in toroidal morphology, leading to a discharge capacity 2.6 times that without MoCl5. In the charge process, MoCl5 could help oxidize Li2O2 effectively, resulting in an extremely high coulombic efficiency and long cycling lifespan. Therefore, both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions could be promoted greatly for Li-O-2 batteries with MoCl5 as the dual-function redox mediator.									15	3	0	0	0	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472566400039

The most important feature is a very strong increase of the general absorption versus the halogen content. It is attributed to the increase of the carrier concentration related to the insertion of the halogen in the YBaCuO structure, which provokes the shielding of the infrared beam by the free carriers. These results are discussed by comparison with the evolution of the infrared spectra of YBa2Cu3Ox versus the oxygen stoechiometry.

By fine confining of oxygen vacancies (OVs) in atomic layered molybdenum oxide (MoO2), we herein reported a sustainable strategy to tackle the rigorous requirements, thereby figuring out the deep-seated mechanism underlying the increment mechanism. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) results primarily indicated that vast majority of OVs with different concentrations distributed well on layered MoO2. Based on the combined results of chemical N-2 adsorption isotherm and DFT calculation, we revealed that OVs favoured chemical adsorption for N-2 molecular via electron donation on defective Mo, providing the prerequisite for following activation. Remarkably, the energy change calculation unveiled that suitable confined OVs on MoO2 NRR followed an novel distal/alternating hybrid path, whereby the energy barrier was effectively lowered after directly protonation of N2H2* to HN2H2* (Delta G = 0.36 eV), so that OVs-MoO2 catalyst exhibited a high activity and selectivity with NH3 yield rate of similar to 12.20 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) and a Faradaic efficiency of 8.2% at a low potential of - 0.15 V.									130	12	0	0	5	0	131			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000463032200002

In this work, a series of structure-making/breaking cations in the electrolyte were investigated as spectator cations in hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) in the pH range of 1 to 14, whose kinetics was found to be altered by up to 2 orders of magnitude by these cations. The exchange current density of HER/HOR was shown to increase with greater structure-making tendency of cations in the order of Cs+ < Rb+ < K+ < Na+ < Li+, which was accompanied by decreasing reorganization energy from the Marcus-Hush-Chidsey formalism and increasing reaction entropy. Invoking the Born model of reorganization energy and reaction entropy, the static dielectric constant of the electrolyte at the electrified interface was found to be significantly lower than that of bulk, decreasing with the structure-making tendency of cations at the negatively charged Pt surface. The physical origin of cation-dependent HER/HOR kinetics can be rationalized by an increase in concentration of cations on the negatively charged Pt surface, altering the interfacial water structure and the H-bonding network, which is supported by classical molecular dynamics simulation and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy. This work highlights immense opportunities to control the reaction rates by tuning interfacial structures of cation and solvents.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25				2691-3704		WOS:000711198900016	34723270

Among many semiconductor photocatalysts, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has received tremendous attention due to its two-dimensional structure, appropriate band gap and decent photocatalytic activity. However, it suffers severe charge recombination problems, affecting its practical performance. In this work, we demonstrated that dual heteroatoms (C and O) doped g-C(3)N(4 )can exhibit about 3 times higher catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution than that of the normal g-C(3)N(4 )with a hydrogen evolution rate reaching 2595.4 umol g(-1)h(-1) and an apparent quantum efficiency at 420 nm of 16.6%. The heteroatoms (C and O) doped g-C(3)N(4 )photocatalyst also exhibited superior removal performance when removing Rhodamine B (RhB). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy reveal that the carbon and oxygen dopants replace the sp(2) nitrogen and bridging N atom, respectively. DFT calculations demonstrate the codoping of carbon and oxygen- induced the generation of mid-gap state, leading to the improvement of light harvesting and charge separation. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Here, a synergistic effort between theoretical calculations at the atomic level and experiments to predict and validate a promising oxide catalyst for the glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) are reported, providing a good example of designing novel, cost-effective, and highly efficient electrocatalysts for producing value-added products at the anode and high-purity hydrogen at the cathode. The predicted CoMoO4 catalyst is experimentally validated as a suitable catalyst for GOR and found to perform best among the investigated metal (Mn, Co, Ni) molybdate counterparts. The potential required to reach 10 mA cm(-2) is 1.105 V at 60 degrees C in an electrolyte of 1.0 m KOH with 0.1 m glycerol, which is 314 mV lower than for oxygen evolution. The GOR reaction pathway and mechanism based on this CoMoO4 catalyst are revealed by high-performance liquid chromatography and in situ Raman analysis. The coupled quantitative analysis indicates that the CoMoO4 catalyst is highly active toward C-C cleavage, thus presenting a high selectivity (92%) and Faradaic efficiency (90%) for formate production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000761234600001

Herein we report a bifunctional nanotube-array electrode for water splitting in alkaline electrolyte. The electrode requires the overpotentials of 58 mV and 184 mV for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions respectively, meanwhile maintaining remarkable long-term durability. The prominent performance is due to the systematic optimization of chemical composition and geometric structure principally-that is, abundant electrocatalytic active sites, excellent conductivity of metallic 1T' MoS2, synergistic effects among iron, cobalt, nickel ions, and the superaerophobicity of electrode surface for fast mass transfer. The electrode is also demonstrated to function as anode and cathode, simultaneously, delivering 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.429 V. Our results demonstrate substantial improvement in the design of high-efficiency electrodes for water electrolysis.									321	20	0	0	18	0	322			2041-1723			WOS:000436049500005	29934572

Here, we prepare the carbonaceous microspheres (CMSs) by a facile hydrothermal treatment of glucose precursor and then dope the CMSs with La2O3, resulting in a high performance bifunctional electrocatalyst of La2O3@CMSs. In alkaline solution, the La2O3@CMSs catalyzes oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) with an onset potential of 0.80 V versus RHE and an overpotential only of 600 mV to achieve a current density of 1.3 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at La2O3@CMSs electrode occurs at an onset potential of 1.60 V versus RHE and the overpotential is only 370 mV. Also, the as-prepared La2O3@CMSs exhibits high Faraday efficiency and long-term stability toward ORR and OER Significantly, we demonstrate that La2O3@CMSs possesses surprisingly high mass activity, which is calculated to be 78.4 A g(-1) for ORR and 831.5 A g(-1) for OER, respectively. A potential window for ORR and OER at the modified electrode is estimated to be 0.80 V, implying a promising bifunctional electrocatalytical performance of La2O3@CMSs. The improvement of the bifunctional electrocatalytical activity may be due to the generation of active component of La-O and C-O at the surface and its synergistic interact with the La2O3@CMSs. This work not only provides a facile strategy for preparing highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst, but also offers an insight into the design of metal-oxides doped carbon materials for energy storage and conversion applications.									35	1	0	0	0	0	36			1932-7447			WOS:000341337700020

Here we report a facile two-step approach to fabricate trimetallic Fe/Co/Cu-based phosphides embedded onto nitrogen-doped carbon-graphene (FeCoCuP@NC). The FeCoCuP@NC exhibits excellent electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with low overpotential and durable long-term stability in both acidic and alkaline conditions. To reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), FeCoCuP@NC requires overpotential of 80 and 169 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. The superior HER performance of FeCoCuP@NC could be attributed to the formation of heterojunctions between different phosphides and the synergetic action between active phosphides and N-doped carbon-graphene matrix. This work affords a feasible strategy to fabricate trimetallic transition metal phosphides embedded onto carbonaceous materials using metal-organic frameworks as precursors for energy and environmental applications.

In this study, we report a novel bifunctional catalyst developed by simultaneous engineering of single nickel atoms (Ni-SA) and nickel phosphate clusters (Ni-Pi) to synergistically trigger surface-functionalized MoS2 nanosheets (NSs) resulting in high reactivities for both HER and OER. The Ni-SA-Ni-Pi/MoS2 NSs material exhibits a fairly Pt-like HER behavior with an overpotential of 94.0 mV and a small OER overpotential of 314.0 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in freshwater containing 1.0 M KOH. Experimental results of the catalyst are well supported by theoretical study, which reveals the significant modulation of electronic structure and enrichment of electroactive site number/types with their reasonably adjusted free adsorption energy. For evaluating practicability, the Ni-SA-Ni-Pi/MoS2 NSs-based electrolyzer delivers effective operation voltage of 1.62, 1.52, and 1.66 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and superior long-term stability as compared to Pt/C//RuO2 system in freshwater, mimic seawater, and natural seawater, respectively. The present study indicates that the catalyst is a promising candidate for the practical production of green hydrogen via water electrolysis.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4				2575-0356		WOS:000823302100001

In this work, a super-hydrophilic non-noble metal electrocatalyst, Ni3P/MnOOH, was prepared by electrochemical tuning on Ni3P/Mn precursor that was grown firstly on 3D porous conductive nickel foam substrate by electrodeposition. The Ni3P/MnOOH hybrid catalyst displays high electrocatalytic activity that requires a low overpotential of 268 mV and 341 mV at 1000 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in simulated industrial environment, respectively. Remarkably, an alkaline electrolyzer constucted by Ni3P/MnOOH hybrid electrode as the anode and cathode only require a cell voltage of 1.53 Vat 10 mA cm(-2) with prominent stability under above half-reaction condition.

Different from heteroatoms doping and conductivity improvement, to address this issues, the electronic structure of active edge sites Se in MoSe2 were modulated by electron injection from ruthenium deposited on MoSe2 nanosheets. The Rh-MoSe2 nanocomposite exhibits great performance enhancement with a low onset potential of 3 mV and quite low overpotential of 31 mV (vs RHE), which is superior to almost all Rh-based and MoSe2-based electrocatalysts. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that the performance improvement stems from the modulated electronic structure of Se atoms at the edge sites by electron transfer from metal Rh to MoSe2 support, which leads to a moderate Delta G(H)* value of 0.09 eV compared to 0.83 eV for MoSe2 and -0.26 eV for Rh.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			2168-0485			WOS:000444924500117

This is because the other half reaction of water splitting, i.e., oxygen evolution reaction, often needs to be implemented in alkaline environment. Here we demonstrate a universal strategy that may be used to significantly improve the HER catalysis of MoS2 in all kinds of environments from acidic to alkaline, proton intercalation. Protons may be enabled to intercalate between monolayer MoS2 and underlying substrates or in the interlayer space of thicker MoS2 by two processes: electrochemically polarizing MoS2 at negative potentials (vs RHE) in acidic media or immersing MoS2 into certain acid solutions like TFSI. The improvement in catalytic performance is due to the activity enhancement of the active sites in MoS2 by the intercalated protons, which might be related with the effect of the intercalated protons on electrical conductance and the adsorption energy of hydrogen atoms. The enhancement in catalytic activity by the intercalated proton is very stable even in neutral and alkaline electrolytes.									130	4	0	0	9	1	131			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000415785900033	29068681

The precursor cobalt solution reacted with GR during the initial hydrolysis step to form intermediates. A subsequent hydrothermal reaction promoted Co(3)O(4)crystallinity with a crystalline size of 73 nm, resulting in octahedral particles of 100-300 nm in size. Scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the successful formation of the Co3O4/GR composite. This catalyst composite was sprayed onto a carbon cloth to form a cathode for the hybrid electrolyte lithium-air battery (HELAB). This catalyst demonstrated improved oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution capabilities. The HELAB containing this catalyst showed a higher discharge voltage and stable charge voltage, resulting in a 34% reduction in overall over-potential compared to that without the Co3O4/GR composite. The use of saturated LiOH in 11.6 M LiCl aqueous electrolyte at the cathode further reduced the over-potential by 0.5 V. It is proposed that the suppressed dissociation of LiOH expedites the charging reaction from un-dissociated LiOH. This Co3O4/GR composite is a promising bi-functional catalyst, suitable as a cathode material for a HELAB operating in high relative humidity and highly alkaline environment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000550883900001	32517232

The structural evolution of Ce[Fe(CN)6] Prussian blue analogue (Ce-Fe PBA) was firstly controlled by adjusting reaction conditions at room temperature. Moreover, 3D porous Fe-CeO2 with rich oxygen vacancies were obtained by the pyrolysis of Ce-Fe PBA, which showed high performance for supercapacitor. In 1 M KOH, The as-prepared Fe-CeO2-500 electrode with the highest content of oxygen vacancies generated a high specific capacity (148 C/g at 0.5 A/g). In particular, an asymmetric supercapacitor of Fe-CeO2-500//activated carbon achieved an excellent energy storage density of 22.7 Wh/kg at a power density of 640 W/kg and excellent cycling stability with 74.5% of the capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A/g. This exciting work not only offers a method to control the structural evolution of Ce-Fe PBA with uniform size, but also develops a porous material for high-performance supercapacitors.									22	1	0	0	2	0	22			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000663740500002

Herein, a novel Co nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-rich carbonitride (Co@Co-N-C) electrocatalyst was fabricated via a facile approach of melamine polymerization and Co2+ in situ deposition and reduction. The optimized Co@Co-N-C catalyst demonstrates outstanding catalytic activity for HER in a wide range pH values. In particular, it shows ultralow onset potentials of 62 mV and 46 mV and overpotentials of 178 mV and 157 mV to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. Moreover, it presents outstanding electrochemical durability without degradation at all pH values. Such highly efficient electrocatalytic performance is mainly attributed to the maximum of synergistic effects between uniform dispersed Co nanoparticles and N-rich carbonitride nanotubes.

Herein, we report a new methodology for facile fabrication of robust electrocatalysts consisting of N, P-codoped carbon (NPC)-encapsulated RuP2 nanoparticles around carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which shows unprecedented HER activity and high durability in all-pH range. The method involves the conformal coating of the imidazolium-based ionic polymer (ImIP) on CNTs surface, anion metathesis and subsequent phosphorization, the multistep synthetic protocol allows for deliberate modulation of the electrocatalysts. ImIP effectively inhibits the aggregation of RuP2 during phosphorization to form small-sized RuP2 nanoparticles, while NPC significantly increases the conductivity, intrinsic activity and stability of RuP2. The remarkably low overpotentials of 12, 15 and 13 mV are required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, 1.0 M PBS and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively.

RuO2 can circumvent the thermodynamic bottleneck resulting from the scaling relations observed on metallic electrocatalyst, by utilizing an alternate pathway through oxygen coordinated intermediates. Employing density functional theory based computational electrocatalysis models we show adsorbate-adsorbate interaction effects for adsorbates and reaction intermediates on the RuO2(110) surface are large and impactful to the reaction thermodynamics. We studied binding energy amendment due to adsorbate interaction (steric and electronic) with varying coverage of CO* spectators on the catalyst surface. Implications on the reaction pathways help us rationalize differences in experimentally observed carbonaceous product mix and suppression of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We show that a moderate CO* coverage (similar to 50%) is necessary for obtaining methanol as a product and that higher CO* coverages leads to very low overpotential for formic acid evolution. Our analysis also clarifies the importance of the reaction condition for CO2 reduction to liquid fuels utilizing RuO2-based electrocatalysts.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1932-7447			WOS:000409395700003

These low energy reactions generally take place in nuclei with an atomic weight that is lower or equal to that of iron (Fe). The experimental evidence, obtained from repeatable measurements of neutron emissions, can be also recognized considering the anomalous chemical balances of the major events that have affected the Earth's crust, oceans and atmosphere, over the last four billion years. These anomalies include: (i) the abrupt variations in the most abundant elements in correspondence to the formation of tectonic plates; (ii) the Great Oxidation Event (2.7 to 2.4 billion years ago), with a sharp increase in atmospheric oxygen and the subsequent origin of life; (iii) the increase of carbon and nytrogen concentrations in the primordial atmosphere.Natural piezonuclear reactions are induced by fault sliding and plate subduction phenomena.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1029-9599	1990-5424		WOS:000318605500004

Here, we demonstrate that low-temperature annealing of RuO2 nanoparticles (similar to 1.7 nm) supported on Nb-doped TiO2 leads to the formation of durable active sites with superior activity and product selectivity toward active chlorine generation (10 mA cm(-2) at 22 mV overpotential with a Faradaic efficiency of 97.3% in 0.6 M NaCl, which is much better than that of commercial DSA). The Nb doping not only enhances the electronic conductivity of TiO2 support, but also enables thermal diffusion of Ti atoms into the RuO2 lattice at only 200 degrees C, forming ultrafine solid-solution nanoparticles with ultrathin TiO2 surface as a protective layer. This work provides a cost-effective fabrication strategy of stable RuO2 electrocatalysts for anodic reactions, as well as additional insights into the design principle of DSA.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000709692900003
