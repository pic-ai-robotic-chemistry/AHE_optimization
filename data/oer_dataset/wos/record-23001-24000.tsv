However, a uniform and large amount of doping in BP remains a challenge. Herein, the synthesis of tellurium-doped black phosphorus (Te-doped BP) single crystals with high crystalline quality is achieved by the chemical vapor transport reaction method. The synthetic route enables a uniform and relatively large amount (up to 0.5% atomic ratio) of Te-doping in BP single crystals. The electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties of few-layer Te-doped BP nanosheets prepared by liquid exfoliation were also investigated for the first time. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the OER onset potential of undoped and Te-doped BP nanosheets was 1.63 and 1.49 V, respectively. The result implies that doping provides an effective route to enhance the electrochemical OER performance of BP.									38	4	0	0	2	0	40			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000429283200065	29561597

The resulting core-shell microfibers (Co-MF) with a catalytic shell exhibit a turnover frequency and a current density that are much higher than those of a conventional Co-OEC on a flat SS foil (Co-F) at neutral pH. The onset potential of the catalytic wave of Co-MF is also appreciably lower than that of Co-F owing to a combination of the higher surface activity of the Co-OEC and the enhanced local electric field in the 3D network of the metal microfibers. This study suggests that cost-effective, stable, and earth-abundant SS microfibers can be a promising substrate to enhance the surface activity of water-oxidation electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000413563000002

The results indicate that pH affects the interfacial structure as a consequence of the formation of a stable hydrogen network and the impact of the electric field on the interfacial Gibbs energy. Focusing on the potential region of the oxygen evolution reaction (1.23 V vs a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) + overpotential), variations in pH were found to change both the formal Ru valency and the structure of the primary water layer by altering the work function of the interfacial structure. We hypothesize that the effects of pH on the hydrogen bond network and formal valency observed in this work also apply to other transition-metal oxides.									34	0	0	0	5	0	34			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000374811100021

The nanostructured design of the catalyst allows the core and corona to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), respectively. These materials displayed exemplary OER and ORR activity through half-cell testing, comparable to state of the art commercial lanthanum nickelate (LaNiO3) and carbon-supported platinum (Pt/C), with added bifunctional capabilities allowing metal-air battery rechargeability. LaNiO3 and Pt/C are currently the most accepted benchmark electrocatalyst materials for the OER and ORR, respectively; thus with comparable activity toward both of these reactions, CCBC are presented as a novel, inexpensive catalyst component for the cathode of rechargeable metal-air batteries. Moreover, after full-range degradation testing (FDT) CCBC: retained excellent activity, retaining 3 and 13 times greater ORR and OER current upon comparison to state of the art Pt/C. Zinc-air battery performances of CCBC is in good agreement with the half-cell experiments with this bifunctional electrocatalyst displaying high activity and stability during battery discharge, charge, and cycling processes. Owing to its outstanding performance toward both the OER and ORR, comparable with the highest performing commercial catalysts to date for each of the respective reaction, coupled with high stability and rechargeability, CCBC is presented as a novel class of bifunctional catalyst material that is very applicable to future generation rechargeable metal-air batteries.									339	15	0	0	15	0	343			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000302524600035	22372510

Objective comparison between OER catalysts has been blurred by the use of different supports and methods to evaluate performance. Here, we selected nine highly active transition-metal-based catalysts and described their synthesis, using a porous nickel foam and a new Ni-based dendritic material as the supports. We designed a standardized protocol to characterize and compare the catalysts in terms of structure, activity, density of active sites, and stability NiFeSe- and CoFeSe-derived oxides showed the highest activities on our dendritic support, with low overpotentials of eta(100 )approximate to 247 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. Stability evaluation showed no surface leaching for 8 h of electrolysis. This work highlights the most active anode materials and provides an easy way to increase the geometric current density of a catalyst by tuning the porosity of its support.									26	0	0	0	2	0	26			2542-4351			WOS:000654225600020

By examining the time evolution of dark capacitance after 1.2 eV photoexcitation, we are able to estimate the free energy barrier (>= 0.8 eV) for the release of electrons into the conduction band. Such a large thermal barrier, for a defect whose optical threshold is centered (similar to 1.35 eV) so close to the band-gap (1.5 eV), indicates significant configurational relaxation once the oxygen impurity state is occupied with photoexcited electrons.

Compared with the original POMs and GDY, the composite cluster Co-4(PW9)(2)@GDY demonstrates superior performance and stable electrochemical OER. The core-shell composite cluster exhibited high performance for OER with low potentials and a small Tafel slope. Moreover, high catalytic activity of the cluster was achieved at a high current density. Co-4(PW9)(2)@GDY has excellent catalytic performance and long stability due to its strong electron-transfer ability in the system, higher conductivity, and the structural advantage of pores in GDY. We also tested the OER synergism mechanism between POM and GDY. This would open access and guide us to synthesize novel clusters based on polyoxometalates and graphdiyne.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000802572100001

However, it has low efficiency because of poor conductivity in the bulk and sluggish oxygen evolution (OER) kinetics on the surface. In this study, a Co-doped alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode was prepared by the hydrothermal method. It had increased charge separation efficiency and accelerated surface reaction kinetics simultaneously. At the optimal Co content, the photocurrent density of the Co-doped alpha-Fe2O3 increased by 23 times to 0.54 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V-RHE in 1 M NaOH electrolyte; this increase was attributed to the improvement in carrier density and charge transfer behavior. Moreover, the cathodic shift of onset potential for Co-doped alpha-Fe2O3 reached 290 mV owing to the accelerated OER kinetics. This work reveals the key roles of Co doping and provides a suitable photoanode for solar hydrogen technology.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000729865600001

The phase composition as well as the surface morphology and catalyst evolution were studied before and after carrying out the reaction using different instrumental methods as XRD, XPS and TPR. Different hydrocarbons (methane, n-hexane and toluene) were tested in reaction of complete oxidation. Considering the case of toluene the kinetics calculations for both catalysts showed as most probable the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanisms, which include adsorption of the reagents (toluene and oxygen) on different types of sites and dissociative adsorption of oxygen. With YFeO3 the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism cannot yet be excluded. The presence of small size A-type cation like Upsilon in the perovskite structure leads to structure deformation and makes it relatively unstable and does not permit an intensive transformation of Fe ions into higher or lower oxidation state. On the contrary - the structure of LaFeO3 is very stable and can easily accommodate certain amount of cation and anion defects without structural changes, which promotes more intensive fluctuation between the oxidation states of Fe ions and provides more active sites on the catalyst surface for interaction between hydrocarbon and oxygen molecules.

Herein, the strain effect and surface composition of PdAu hollow nanospheres (PdAu HSs) can be tuned by Pd-to-Au ratio. The optimal ORR performance can deliver the half-wave potential of 0.866 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) even superior to commercial Pt/C, which can be attributed to sufficient strain effect, local micro-electric field and the adsorption strength of oxygen-containing species in moderation. In addition, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performances further supported the variation trend of surface composition. The enhancement factor (EF) of Au HSs can reach 3.8 x 10(5), further indicating its great potential as efficient SERS substrates for analysis and detection applications.									43	3	0	0	4	0	43			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000501613700013

Oxygen-terminated Ti2C (Ti2CO2), as one of the typical MXenes, shows good HER Gibbs free energy (Delta G(H)) at low hydrogen coverage, whereas the large band gap of approximately 1.0 eV limits its conductivity capability. By doping phosphor (P) or sulfur (S) to partially substitute the surficial O, the average free energy (Delta G(H)(a)) at various hydrogen coverages has been draggd to approach zero, and the conductivity is also significantly improved by narrowing the band gap to lower than 0.3 eV. Partial charge analysis indicates that doping P or S on the surface induces the diffusion of electrons on oxygen from O 2p(x) to O 2p(z), resulting in O 2p(z) reaction with H 1s. The facial overlapping of H 1s with O 2p(z) will strengthen the binding strength, hence lowering Delta G(H). The energy shift toward Fermi level of Ti 3d after P or S doping contributes to the reduced band gap and high conductivity. Surficial O or P vacancies are created to evaluate the vacancy effect on HER performance, which not only improves Delta G(H)(a) and conductivity but also leads to a low reaction barrier of H2O splitting (<0.2 eV). The armchair nanoribbon (ANR) displays improved HER activity by P-doping at 50% ratio. Our research shows that modification of end-group in MXenes can effectively improve HER catalytic activity and conductivity, which is expected to promote their potential applications in electrocatalysis and energy conversion.									13	3	0	0	0	0	14			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000453765300009	30335229

Codoping carbons with heteroatoms can achieve unique electronic structures and show tailored electrocatalytic capabilities by rationally regulating their dopants. Sulfur is one of the most important dopants from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. In this work, a novel, highly efficient and environmentally benign method for sulfur incorporation into carbon framework has been developed facilely on the basis of graphene oxide-polydopamine (GD) hybrids to derive the N, S-codoped mesoporous carbon nanosheets. 16.7 at% S can be conjugated to the GD hybrids associated with the S doping efficiency up to 6.1% after 800 degrees C pyrolysis, which is higher than most previous S doping approaches. The resultant N, S-codoped mesoporous carbon nanosheets exhibit superior performance with favorable kinetics and excellent durability as a bifunctional ORR and OER catalyst, which is much better than that of most reported metal-free doped carbon, even transition metal and noble metal catalysts. The high concentrations of multiple dopants, abundant porous architecture and good electron transfer ability are believed to significantly expedite the ORR and OER catalytic processes. In the light of physicochemical versatility and structural tunability of polydopamine (PDA), this work provides a universal platform towards further development of PDA-based carbon materials with heteroatom dopants as the highly efficient electrocatalysts.

The electrocatalytic behavior of coatings deposited at different current densities (c.d.'s) for water-splitting applications, in terms of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), has been researched. The experimental results showed that the electrocatalytic activity of Sn-Ni coatings has a close relationship with its composition, surface morphology, and phase structure depending on the c.d. used, supported by scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. Cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry techniques have demonstrated that Sn-Ni alloy deposited at 4.0 A dm(-2) (having 37.6 wt pct Ni) and 1.0 A dm(-2) (having 19.6 wt pct Ni) exhibit, respectively, the highest electrocatalytic behavior for HER and OER in 1.0-M KOH solution. Sn-Ni alloy coatings were found to be stable under working conditions of electrolysis, confirmed by electrochemical corrosion tests. High electrocatalytic activity of Sn-Ni alloy coatings for both HER and OER is specific to their composition, surface morphology, and active surface area.

We report the fabrication of novel g-C3N4/Ag3PO4/Ag2MoO4 ternary composite materials and the exploration of heterostructure materials for water oxidation under LED illumination. The hybridization of three semiconductors has been confirmed by microscopic study, chemical and structural analyses. Enhanced oxygen-producing activity over the obtained ternary composite photocatalysts was observed. The reasons responsible for the enhanced oxygen-evolving performance can be ascribed to the improved light absorption toward visible light, faster charge separation and charge transportation, as well as more powerful water oxidation capability originating from the in-situ construction of dual Z-scheme-type channels under visible light irradiation. The key role of in-situ formed metallic Ag as the electron mediator is suggested based on the theoretical and experimental results. The successful synthesis of fascinating ternary water oxidation photocatalysts provides new insights into the development of novel all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic systems for energy and environmental applications.									161	10	0	0	18	0	163			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000441281300042

In this paper, we report a simple and efficient sol-gel method to synthesizeY(2)Ru(1.9)Mn(0.1)O(7-delta) and Y2Ru1.9Fe0.1O7-delta to promote oxygen evolution. It was found that the introduction of Mn/Fe into YRO enhanced the catalytic activity. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis of oxygen vacancies by means of XPS and TG, a mass of oxygen vacancies wasintroducedin the pyrochlore structure due to exotic Mn and Fe, which act as active sites to promote catalytic performance. Subsequent stability tests found that the doped Fe ions significantly increased the stability of the structure while Mn ions are inverse. To further investigate the activity of Y2Ru(1.9)Mn(0.1)O(7-delta) and Y2Ru1.9Fe0.1O7-delta, the first principles calculation was used. It indicates that the lower the oxygen vacancy formation energy, the better the catalytic activity. In light of the improvement of Y2Ru1.9Fe0.1O7-delta stabilty, the first-principles calculation results show that it is due to the Fe ion presence increased the surface dissolution energy and strengthen the covalence between Ru-O of the matrix, which effectively inhibiting the exsolution of Ru.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000700860100012

However, the mechanism of formation of oxide nanopores is still controversial. Anodic TiO2 nanotubes are usually obtained in an electrolyte containing fluoride ions, so a field-assisted dissolution reaction involving fluoride ions is considered to be the main reason for the formation of nanopores. In this paper, titanium was anodized at high current in a silver nitrate solution without fluoride, and a porous titanium oxide structure was obtained, which proves that a field-assisted dissolution reaction involving fluoride ions is not essential for the formation of nanopores. The electronic current leads to oxygen evolution, and the oxygen bubble mold effect is the real reason for the formation of nanopores. These interesting results show that the mechanism of formation of anodized TiO2 nanotubes is the same as that of porous oxide structures. Moreover, the growth rate of nanotubes in an aqueous solution of silver nitrate was much higher than that in a glycol solution of ammonium fluoride at the same voltage.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000649674700002

The properties of the obtained anodes were compared to those obtained by the thermal decomposition of appropriate chloride salts. The morphology of the anode coatings was examined by scanning tunneling microscopy. The electrochemical behaviour was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and by polarization measurements. An accelerated stability test was used for the examination of the stability of the anodes under simultaneous oxygen and chlorine evolution reaction.

However, the nature of this process at the solid-liquid interface has been little studied at the atomic level. In this work, we use ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and umbrella sampling (US), giving us an accurate description of the dynamic processes associated with the solid-liquid environment. Based on this method, the free energy barriers were calculated at the H2O/Pt(111) interface, and a multistep mechanism has been proposed. We find that proton transfer is dictated by the strength of the solid-liquid interaction and the configuration of water molecules above the reaction site. In particular, we show that the surface adsorbed cations, which are confined to the interface above the top site position, act as vessels for enhanced hydrogen transfer to and from the surface. Our results could lead to significant mechanistic consequences for the HER, water splitting and solid-liquid reactions in general.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000462659300005	30801597

An exploration of the potential energy surfaces associated with the four competitive reactive channels of the 32CA reaction between C-phenyl-N-methyl nitrone and acrolein indicates that the cycloaddition reaction takes place through a one-step mechanism. This cycloaddition reaction presents a moderate meta regioselectivity and a complete endo stereoselectivity, which is diminished in dichloromethane. Analysis of the DFT reactivity indices of the reagents allows an explanation of the participation of nucleophilic nitrones in zw-type 32CA reactions towards ED ethylenes. A bonding evolution theory (BET) study of the two endo regioisomeric reactive channels allows establishing the molecular mechanism of these relevant 32CA reactions. Both regioisomeric channels topologically take place along eight differentiated phases. While the formation of the C-C single bond follows Domingo's recently proposed model, the formation of the C-C single bond takes place at the short distance of 1.6 angstrom through the donation of some electron density of the oxygen lone pairs of the nitrone to the beta-conjugated carbon atom of acrolein. BET supports the non-concerted nature of these zw-type 32CA reactions and makes it possible to reject the pericyclic mechanism proposed for them.									40	0	0	0	2	0	40				2046-2069		WOS:000357798400037

The search for highly active and cost-effective bifunctional catalysts to reduce the consumption of noble metals is necessary for efficient electrochemical water splitting. Using noble metal quantum dots has drawn increasing attention. Herein, we developed flower-like Pt-alphaFe2O3 thin film nanosheets on Ni foam (NF) as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in alkaline electrolyte. X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques were used to characterize the electrocatalyst. The unique design of Pt (111) quantum dot decorated flower-like alphaFe2O3 (104) thin film nanosheets exhibited a quantum size effect and possessed many active sites. Pt-alphaFe2O3/NF electrodes which were loaded with a small amount of Pt quantum dots exhibited low overpotentials for the OER (304 mV@50 mA cm-2) and HER (90 mV@10 mA cm-2), and a low voltage of 1.51 V for overall water splitting in 1 M KOH. Moreover, excellent stability was observed. Therefore, the flower-like nanosheet Pt-alphaFe2O3/NF electrode is a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst with the quantum size effect for overall water splitting in alkaline solution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488			INSPEC:19577947

In this study, Ce-species (Ce2O2S/CeO2)/N, S dual-doped carbon (Ce-species/NSC) catalysts with promising oxygen storage/release capacities are prepared at different temperatures (800-1000 degrees C) to enhance the ORR efficiency. Mechanisms for the effects of temperature on crystalline phase transition between CeO2 and Ce2O2S and structure evolution of Ce-species/NSCs are inferred to better understand their catalytic activity. Porous Ce2O2S/NSC (950 degrees C) catalyst as the air-breathing cathode exhibits a maximum power density of 1087.2 mW m(-2), which is higher than those of other Ce-species/NSCs and commercial Pt/C (989.13 mW m(-2)) in microbial fuel cells. The decline of the power density of Ce2O2S/NSC (950 degrees C) cathode is 8.7% after 80 days of operation, which is far lower than that of Pt/C (36.7%). Ce2O2S/NSC (950 degrees C) has a four-electron selectivity toward the ORR and a low charge-transfer resistance (5.49 Omega), contributing to high ORR activity and durability. The promising ORR catalytic activity of Ce2O2S/NSC (950 degrees C) is attributed to its high specific surface area (338.9 m(2) g(-1)), varied active sites, high, electrical conductivity, and sufficient oxygen vacancies in the Ce2O2S skeleton. The high content of Ce3+ in Ce2O2S/NSC (950 degrees C) facilitates the formation of more oxygen-deficient Ce3+ sites that generate more oxygen vacancies to release/store more oxygen to stabilize the available oxygen for the ORR Thus, this study provides a new perspective for preparation and application of this new type of the ORR catalyst.									49	2	0	0	3	0	49			1944-8244			WOS:000405764700045	28627180

In later generations of massive stars, hydrogen burning occurs predominantly through the CNO cycles, but without the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen to catalyze the reaction sequence, first stars would have to rely on the inefficient pp chains for their energy production. Observations of second and third generation stars show pronounced abundances of carbon and oxygen isotopes, which suggests a rapid conversion of the primordial abundances to heavier elements. While the triple-alpha-process primarily facilitates this conversion, there are alternative reaction sequences, such as H-2(alpha, gamma)Li-6(alpha, gamma)B-10(alpha, n)N-13, that may play a significant role. To study such alternate reaction pathways for production of carbon and heavier nuclei, a number of new measurements are needed. In this work, new measurements are reported for the B-10(alpha, n)N-13 reaction, extending the cross section down to 575 keV incident alpha-particle energy. The measurements were made using a state-of-the-art deuterated liquid scintillator and a spectrum unfolding technique. An R-matrix analysis was performed in order to facilitate a comparison of the underlying nuclear structure with the reaction measurements. An unexpected upturn is observed in the low-energy S factor that indicates the presence of a new low-energy resonance. A revised reaction rate is determined that takes into account the present data as well as other previous measurements from the literature that were previously neglected.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000517221400003

Herein, we developed a simple and effective method to explore a new pillared-layered MOF with syringic acid as a promising OER electrocatalyst. The isostructural mono-, heterobimetallic MOF and N,S co-doped MOF by mixing thiourea were quickly synthesized in a high yield under solvothermal condition. Moreover, the optimized N,S co-doped MOF exhibits the lowest overpotential of 254 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) on a glass carbon electrode and a small Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1), especially, this catalyst also possesses long-term electrochemical durability for at least 16 h. According to the characterization, the incorporation of N and S atoms into this heterobimetallic CoFe-based MOF could modify its pore structure, tune the electronic structure, accordingly, improve the mass and electron transportation, and facilitate the formation of active species, as a consequence, the improved activity of this new N,S co-doped MOF for OER should be mainly be ascribed to higher electrochemical activation toward the active species via in situ surface modification during the OER process.									16	1	0	0	1	0	15			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000527669700001	32196953

For scaled production of hydrogen and oxygen, highly active, robust, and cost-effective PEC electrodes are required. However, most of the available semiconductors as a PEC electrodes have poor light absorption, material degradation, charge separation, and transportability, which result in very low efficiency for photo-water splitting. Generally, a promising photoelectrode is obtained when the surface of the semiconductor is modified/decorated with a suitable co-catalyst because it increases the light absorbance spectrum and prevents electron-hole recombination during photoelectrode reactions. In this regard, numerous p- and d-block elements, single atoms, and graphene-based PEC electrodes have been widely used as semiconductor/co-catalyst junctions to boost the performances of PEC overall water splitting. This review enumerates the recent progress and applications of p- and d-block elements, single atoms, and graphene-based PEC electrodes for water splitting. The focus is placed on fundamental mechanism, efficiency, cells design, and various aspects that contribute to the large-scale prototype device. Finally, future perspectives, summary, challenges, and outlook for improving the activity of PEC photoelectrodes toward whole-cell water splitting are addressed.									42	4	0	0	5	0	42			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000530375700001

Bilayer arrays of Au@Pt nanoparticles with platinum loadings of 0.50, 1.04, 1.44, and 1.75 mu g cm(-2) (corresponding to 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 atomic layer coverage of platinum on nominally 5 nm gold core) were subjected to RF argon plasma treatment for various durations and their electrical conductivity, morphological evolution, and electrocatalytic activity characterized. Samples with monolayer and above platinum coverages exhibit maximum electrochemically active surface areas values of similar to 100 m(2)/g(pt) and specific activities that are similar to 4x to 6x of a reference platinum nanoparticle bilayer array. The underlying gold core influences the structural evolution of the samples upon RF plasma treatment and leads to the formation of highly active Pt(110) facets on the surface at an optimal plasma treatment duration, which also corresponds to the onset of a sharp decline in lateral sheet resistance. The sample having a two atom thick platinum coating has the highest total mass activity of 48 +/- 3 m(2)/g((pt+au)), corresponding to 44% Pt atom utilization, while also exhibiting enhanced CO tolerance as well as high methanol oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000378309300010	27302373

The results showed that the PbO2-I electrode is smooth and compact with an orientation of [3(110), uniform crystal size, and many edges. The accelerated lifetime and stable performance period of the PbO2-I electrode are 168.8 h and 101.2 h, respectively.

The first contact of the catalyst with the electrolyte is critical for the evolution of the catalytically active surface structure, yet still insufficiently understood. Counter to chemical intuition, we find that voltammetric activation protocols in both pH 1 and pH 13 electrolytes result in similarly Ni-depleted surfaces with similar near-surface Ni/Pt ratios to a 2.5 nm depth, yet vastly different ORR reactivities. On the basis of our combined voltammetric, scanning transmission electron microscopy with the spectroscopic mapping by energy dispersive X-ray (STEM-EDX) microscopic and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, we conclude that oxygen-saturated alkaline electrolytes causes a strong surface segregation of the more oxophilic Ni component toward the particles surface, however in distinctly different ways depending on the pretreatment pH. Data suggest a controlling role of the initial thickness of the Ni-depleted Pt shell for the catalysis-driven segregation process. We analyze and discuss how such subtle differences in initial surface composition can unfold such dramatic subsequent variations in ORR activity as a function of pH. Our findings have practical bearing for the design of active Pt bimetallic ORR catalysts for alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells. If the non-noble oxophilic Pt alloy component is insoluble in the alkaline electrolyte, our results call for an imperative acid pretreatment to avoid surface blocking by oxygen-induced segregation. If the non-noble oxophilic Pt alloy component is soluble in an alkaline electrolyte, acid or alkaline, even nonpretreated Pt alloy catalyst may be employed.									27	0	0	0	0	1	27			2155-5435			WOS:000410005700092

Heterostructure formed by combining ferroelectric materials with semiconductor can further strengthen the photocatalytic property. In this work, ferroelectric material Bi2TiO4F2 has been successfully grown on the BiOBr {001} facet by a facial one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. Benefiting from both the internal electric field derived from the ferroelectric spontaneous polarization of Bi2TiO4F2, and the high-quality heterojunction interface, the O-2 production rate of BiOBr/ Bi2TiO4F2 heterojunction reaches 875 mu mol g(-1)h(-1). The possible formation process and reaction mechanism has also been discussed. This research may provide us with some new hints to design new heterostructure photocatalytic materials with both ferroelectricity and active exposure surfaces. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Results demonstrate that this technique increases the hydrogen content and molecular weight of bio-oil. The alcohol carbon content and polyhydric alcohol selectivity in oil dramatically increases after processing. Moreover, low-energy electrocatalytic hydrogenation possesses a higher electrochemical efficiency in comparison with the oxygen evolution reaction based system, suggesting that the Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox couple is promising for energy consumption reduction and electrocatalytic hydrogenation performance improvement. Meanwhile, the novel electrocatalyst demonstrates a better ability for electrocatalytic hydrogenation of bio-oil in contrast with electrocatalysts prepared with conventional incipient wetness impregnation. Additionlly, the feasibility of oxidative depolymerization of lignin by Fe(III) is also explored, and it is found that Fe(III) oxidation can give rise to effective degradation of lignin to produce high-value-added chemicals.									11	2	0	0	2	0	12			2574-0962			WOS:000458706800013

In this paper, cathodic plasma bombardment (CPB) has been employed to modify the surface of 304 stainless steel by creating a nanoscale three dimensional structure with a large specific surface area, which could significantly improve the electrocatalytic OER performance of 304 stainless steel. The influence of CPB conditions on the electrocatalytic performance of 304 stainless steel was systematically investigated. The results indicate that the electrode prepared under the optimal CPB conditions only requires an overpotential of 323 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1) in the 1 M KOH alkaline electrolyte. The work provides a new methodology for the development of highly active and low-cost stainless steel-based electrocatalytic electrodes.

Significant progress has been made in alkaline conditions. In contrast, it remains a challenge to develop stable OER electrocatalysts in acidic conditions. Herein, we report a new strategy to stabilize RuO2 by introducing interstitial carbon (C-RRuO2-RuSe), where the optimized C-RuO2-RuSe-5 exhibits a low overpotential of 212, 259, and 294 mV to reach a current density of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. More importantly, C-RuO2 RuSe-10 has long-term stability of up to 50 h, representing one of the most stable OER electrocatalysts. X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that the Ru-O bonds have been elongated due to the formation of interstitial C. Theoretical calculations show that the elongated Ru-O bonds in RuO2 enhance its stability and reduce energy barriers for OER. This work provides a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient Ru-based electrocatalysts for water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2451-9294			WOS:000814058100013

Herein, a rapid melting synthesis of surface covalent sulfur engineered Ni3S2 nanoparticles has been demonstrated by using nickel foam, in which the content of surface covalent sulfur is conveniently adjusted by varying the melting temperature. It is found that the surface covalent sulfur content shows a significant positive correlation with the increase of catalytically active Ni3+ during the OER, indicating that the moderate surface covalent sulfur can maximize the Ni3+ content of Ni3S2 to effectively promote OER activities. Consequently, Ni3S2-200 shows the highest ECSA-normalized current density of 0.85 mA cm(-2) at 320 mV and the lowest overpotential of 290 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) among other samples as well as commercial benchmarks. The protocol simplifies the synthesis of highly efficient and stable non-noble electrocatalysts to display enormous potential for water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000618236500034

However, this process relies heavily upon lengthy reduction (800-1,200 K) in hydrogen-rich environments to facilitate the electron transfer from hydrogen to oxides, making this process costly. Here, we show that, in addition to thermal driving forces, photo-illumination can drive electron donation and facilitate the electron harvesting on perovskite directly. This results in segregation of NPs at room temperature with the assistance of trialkyl amine as a hole acceptor. A proton-coupled electron transfer catalytic cycle is suggested to explain this unusual electron transfer pathway, which is redox neutral and an intrinsically closed cycle. The practicality of this process is demonstrated by the improved performance in a trial electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. This work suggests a promising design principle for perovskite functionalization.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				2666-3864		WOS:000658756600011

Herein, a novel strategy is developed to increase gas bubble escape rate for water splitting by using nonwoven stainless steel fabrics (NWSSFs) as the conductive substrate decorated with flakelike iron nickel-layered double hydroxide (FeNi LDH) nanostructures. The as-prepared FeNi LDH@NWSSF electrode shows a much faster escape rate of gas bubbles as compared to that of other commonly used three-dimensional porous catalytic electrodes, and the maximum dragging force for a bubble releasing 300 between NWSSF channels is only one-seventh of the dragging force within nickel foam channels. As a result, it exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with low overpotentials of 210 and 110 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH for OER and HER, respectively. There is almost no current drop after a long-time durability test. In addition, its performance for full water splitting is superior to that of the previously reported catalysts, with a voltage of 1.56 V at current density of 10 mA cm(-2).									38	1	0	0	3	0	38			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000416614600045	29098849

The electro-chemical mechanism is very complex and involves several steps with adsorbed species and radicals.The electrolysis at fixed potential leads to peroxodiphosphate species formation in solution.The complexity of electrochemical mechanism is confirmed by EIS study.

It is shown that the first p(13) N resonance determines the S factor and contributions of the M1 and E2 transitions are negligible at energies E < 1 MeV, but are significant at high energies. The S factor strongly depends on the 3S1 resonance parameters. The influence of the width of the S-3(1) resonance on the S factor is demonstrated. The reaction rate is calculated and an analytical approximation for the reaction rate is proposed. A comparison of our calculation with existing data is addressed. Results of our calculations for the N-13(p, gamma)O-14 reaction rate provide the contribution to the steadily improving reaction-rate database libraries. Our calculations of the N-13(p, gamma )O-14 reaction rate along with results for the rates of the N-14(p, gamma)O-15 and C-12(p, gamma)N-13 processes provide the temperature range 0.13 < T-9 < 0.97 for the conversion of the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle to the hot CNO cycle. Our results demonstrate that, at the early stages of a nova explosion at temperatures of about 0.1T(9) and at late stages of evolution of supermassive stars at temperatures of about 1.0T9, the ignition of the hot CNO cycle could occur at much lower densities of a stellar medium.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000579097700004

Herein, we report the synthesis of faceted CuMn2O4 (f-CMO) nanoparticles via polyol-mediated annealing, in which ethylene glycol plays a crucial role in the formation of phase-pure and faceted CMO. We found that f-CMO has many facets, oxygen vacancies, and high electrical conductivity. Hence, its electrocatalytic water splitting activity was investigated to elucidate the impact of facet formation. Significantly, the f-CMO electrode exhibited superior hydrogen evolution reaction activity (overpotential: 116 mV and Tafel slope: 115 mV/dec) than non-f-CMO (239 mV and 163 mV/dec) at -10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. Furthermore, it outperforms the reported spinel oxides at high current densities. Our results demonstrated that controlling the facet formation and particle size is essential for the development of efficient electrocatalysts for use in water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000840962800001

Here we report the fabrication of Zn-doped NiFeOxHy (Zn;NiFeOxHy) that has advanced electrocatalytic activity and stability in comparison to pure NiFeOxHy in the OER via simple chemical bath deposition and electrochemical activation. The improvement with Zn;NiFeOxHy is due to the Zn2+ dopant, a strong Lewis acid that modulates its electronic property for better intermediate binding for the electrochemical process, resulting in the stabilization of the OER-active phase. This work opens up an opportunity to elucidate the detailed mechanism of NiFeOxHy-based electrocatalysts and improves our understanding of redox tuning through inductive effects, thereby leading to advanced OER catalyst developments.									54	2	0	0	3	0	54			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100028

In this work, an Fe bis(salicylaldehyde)ethylenediimine (Salen) compound Fe(Salen) encapsulated cobalt-porphyrin framework PIZA-1 (Fe(Salen)@PIZA-1) thin film with different surface compositions was successfully developed by using a modified epitaxial layer-by-layer approach. After calcination, this composite Fe(Salen)@PIZA-1 derived thin film is first developed as oxygen evolution catalyst which attained precise control on the surface composition. The electrochemical results showed that this unique surface modified material has a good catalytic activity for OER (eta = 340 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and long-term stability.

Here we report that BSCF82 can quickly undergo amorphization of its surface at OER potentials, which is accompanied by reduced surface concentrations of Ba2+ and Sr2+ ions as well as increased pseudocapacitive and OER currents. Such quick amorphization during OER was also observed for perovskite catalysts with similar OER activities such as Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.4Fe0.6O3-delta and SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta. In contrast, perovskite oxides with lower OER activities than BSCF82 did not undergo this transformation when subjected to identical electrochemical conditions. These findings demonstrate that the active chemistry and structure of oxide catalysts during OER can significantly differ from those of the as-synthesized material and that understanding how the oxide surface may change and impact the OER activity is critical to the design of highly active and stable OER catalysts.									457	16	0	0	42	0	462			1948-7185			WOS:000313770400004

Thus, in the present paper, the group of bio-inspired conjugated materials based on the alloxazine core is synthetized using two efficient novel synthetic approaches providing relatively high reaction yields. The comprehensive characterization of the materials, in order to evaluate the properties and application potential, has shown that the modification of the initial alloxazine core with aromatic substituents allows fine tuning of the optical bandgap, position of electronic orbitals, absorption and emission properties. Interestingly, the compounds possess multichromophoric behavior, which is assumed to be the results of an intramolecular proton transfer.									14	0	0	0	4	0	13				1420-3049		WOS:000447365100182	30189689

Here, we study how cobalt (Co) and iron (Fe) doping and CoFe codoping determine the OER activity of NiOOH via experiments and theoretical calculations. The results show that both Co and Fe, with enhanced density of states near the Fermi level, decrease the overpotential by increasing the binding energy of O* and consequently exhibit higher activities than nickel. In particular, Fe, with nearly optimal O* binding energy, exhibits the lowest overpotential of 181 mV to reach 50 mA cm(-2) In the case of CoFe codoping, Co alters the electronic states of Fe, which weakens the Fe-OOH bond and slightly increases the overpotential. Based on the calculated activities, an overpotential contour plot is constructed, providing guidance for catalyst design via modulating electronic structures and intermediate binding energies.									27	4	0	0	1	0	27				2666-3864		WOS:000658745900015		
J	Hoschek, Anna; Schmid, Andreas; Buehler, Bruno								In Situ O-2 Generation for Biocatalytic Oxyfunctionalization Reactions								CHEMCATCHEM				10	23			5366	5371		10.1002/cctc.201801262				DEC 7 2018	2018	O-2-dependent whole-cell bioprocesses, such as C-H oxyfunctionalizations, are constrained by technically limited O-2 mass transfer and biocatalyst-inherent O-2 respiration. In large-scale bioprocesses, this restricts the maximum achievable productivity to 5.6 g(product) L(-1)h(-1) assuming a resting cell concentration of 9.4 g(CDW) L-1. This concept paper discusses strategies to enhance the O-2 availability for biocatalytic oxyfunctionalizations with a focus on the insitu generation of O-2 from water. This promising approach was addressed recently by the exploitation of microbial photosynthesis for light-driven C-H oxyfunctionalization. Via intracellular O-2 evolution, phototrophic biocatalysts increase the maximum achievable productivity well beyond technical boundaries. This fundamental advantage over O-2-respiring biocatalysts now awaits scale-up evaluations, combining established cultivation technologies for phototrophic organisms with bioprocessing techniques for heterotrophic organisms.									13	0	0	0	7	0	13			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000457345400002

Especially, those oxides and devices, which can be used for photolysis of water (hydrogen and oxygen evolution) and for water purification, are of interest. So far, semiconducting oxides such as TiO(2), Fe(2)O(3), WO(3), SrTiO(3), tantalates and niobates are the only class of materials which have shown high stability as photoelectrodes towards corrosion in the rate limiting step in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under illumination at the electrode/electrolyte interface during photolysis of water. Oxides have to be developed to be highly conductive and have a bandgap, which can be achieved by tailoring the defect chemistry of the oxides or by formation of a suited mixed oxide phase. Of special interest is the preparation of highly conductive p- and n-type TiO(2) and WO(3) as well as their alloys as corrosion stable and photoelectrocatalytically active electrodes. Bandgap reduction of pure TiO(2) involved the formations of solid solutions of TiO(2)-FeO and TiO(2)-Fe(2)O(3), which were reported to have a bandgap of similar to 2.2 eV.(1) Besides TiO(2), WO(3) also has a superior stability as a photoelectrode material in the OER. Alloying with FeO also leads to lowering of the bandgap. Alternatively, ternary oxides of the systems Ni-Co-O and Ni-Fe-O are known for their high catalytic activity in the OER. They are considered as potential cocatalysts in the process of water oxidation. The materials can also be used in hybrid photoelectrodes consisting of a photovoltaic structure to absorb the sunlight with a corrosion stable and catalytically active window layer, which is in contact with the electrolyte.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			1743-6753			WOS:000298761400006

Therefore, in this study, ultrathin and amorphous cobalt-nickel-phosphate (CoNiPOx) nanosheet arrays are deposited over vanadium (V)-doped cobalt-nitride (V-3%-Co4N) crystalline core nanowires to obtain amorphous-shell@crystalline-core mesoporous 3D-heterostructures (CoNiPOx@V-Co4N/NF) as bifunctional electrocatalysts. The optimized electrocatalyst shows extremely low HER and OER overpotentials of 53 and 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The CoNiPOx@V-3%-Co4N/NF (+/-) electrolyzer utilizing the electrocatalyst as both anode and cathode demonstrates remarkable overall water-splitting activity, requiring a cell potential of only 1.52 V at 10 mA cm(-2), 30 mV lower than that of the RuO2/NF (+)/20%-Pt/C/NF (-) electrolyzer. Such impressive bifunctional activities can be attributed to abundant active sites, adjusted electronic structure, lower charge-transfer resistance, enhanced electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), and surface- and volume-confined electrocatalysis resulting from the synergistic effects of the crystalline V-3%-Co4N core and amorphous CoNiPOx shells boosting water splitting in alkaline media.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2198-3844		WOS:000806254200001	35666047

In this study, Cu-doped CoFe/Co encapsulated by N-doped carbon (Cu-CoFe/Co/NC) is synthesized via chemical precipitation followed by carbonization method, in which the electronic structure and d-band center of Cu-CoFe/Co/NC are regulated by metal doping and hetero-engineering. The as-synthesized Cu-CoFe/ Co/NC exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity for ORR (E-1/2 = 0.87 V), HzOR (eta(10) = 281 mV), and HER (eta(-10) = 217 mV) in alkaline seawater. Inspiringly, the self-assembled direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) are used to power overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) for proof of concept, demonstrating the great potential of Cu-CoFe/Co/NC as trifunctional electrocatalyst toward energy storage and conversion devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000860289100002

Current/potential curves for the reduction process in solutions with constant chloride concentration of 1.0 mol dm(-3) and varying H+ concentration have been obtained with the use of the rotating disk electrode technique (RDE). It was found that the chlorine reduction rate is highly inhibited in solutions with high H+ concentrations and that it can be satisfactorily described by the Erenburg mechanism, previously suggested for the chlorine evolution on RuO2 and RTO. The expression of the kinetic current as a function of chlorine and H+ concentration was obtained by solving the elementary rate equations of the kinetic mechanism. The kinetic constants obtained from the correlation of the kinetic current expression to the experimental data were used to simulate the dependence of the surface coverages and elementary reaction rates on overpotential.

Herein, a geometrically optimized three-dimensional hierarchically architectural single atomic Fe-N-C catalyst with fast mass transport and electron transfer is rationally developed by post-molecule pyrolysis assisted with silicon template and reconstructs by ammonia treating. The ammonia-assisted secondary pyrolysis not only compensates for the volatilization of nitrogen species contained in organic precursors but also optimizes the surface structure of Fe-N-C catalyst, thus increasing the content of pyridinic nitrogen and boosting the density of active sites (Fe-N-x) in Fe-N-C samples. In addition, the pyridinic nitrogen adjusts the electronic distribution in Fe 3d active center and promotes the catalytic performances. Therefore, this hollow spherical atomically dispersed Fe-N-C catalyst delivers outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in pH-universal electrolyte and surpasses the most reported values.

According to this concept, in the prebiosphere period, a shell structure was formed, the global convection occurred in the form of tectonics of small plates, and the absence of continents excluded the involvement of water in the oxidation of igneous rocks. In the biosphere period, photosynthetic organisms began to supply free oxygen and organic matter (OM) to the environment. Oxygen began to take part in the geochemical processes of ore conversion, the formation of the nitrogen-oxygen composition of the atmosphere, and the generation of granitoids from volcanic rock. Global systems for the generation of granitoids of the continental crust and hydrocarbons (HCs), which are formed during subduction-collision absorption of the oceanic crust, have been identified for the first time. On the transit route to the Benioff zone, granites are melted out from oxygen-enriched halmyrolysis products and the thermal metamorphism of OM yields solid allotropic carbon compounds, oil, and combustible and other gases and is accompanied by the release of OM decomposition energy. This is one of the ways to convert biosphere solar energy into the endodynamic processes of the evolution of the Earth. The average annual precipitation of the primary OM in the ocean is 785.5 Mt, and 1.7 km(3) of the continental crust are generated. Over the biosphere period, the World Ocean became shallower by 904.5 million km(2). Geodynamic and geophysical processes, primarily global convection, in conjunction with biosphere factors, have resulted in the current state of the Earth's shells and the existence of HCs and continental-crust generation systems in them.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0001-4338	1555-628X		WOS:000454419000006

Herein, catalyst function in compact micro-reactor electrodes is designed by nanostructural tailoring of carbonized wood for efficient water splitting. Specifically, NiFe rod tipped, N-doped graphitic carbon nanocapsule arrays are self-assembled in hierarchical wood, and the benefit of this unique presentation and its promotive effect on accessibility of the catalyst surfaces is apparent. This report also comprises the first wood based micro-reactor electrodes for electrocatalytic water oxidation demonstrating excellent performance. The overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction was as low as 180 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) current density and TOFredox was high at a level of 5.8 s(-1) (at 370 mV overpotential). This hierarchical electrode can also work as bifunctional catalyst (both as anodic and as cathodic electrode) for total water splitting with a cell potential of 1.49 V for 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution, suggestive of their potential also in other electrochemical applications.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000515195200055

However, a major problem associated with SR is gaps in the results (missing results) when more mathematical operations are introduced. We applied deep symbolic regression (DSR) to a dense space of overpotential formulas to reveal the scaling relations of the Gibbs free energies of the key intermediate adsorbates during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on FeNi surfaces in alkaline media. The highest-ranked empirical equation f(x) generated from 40 000 000 hidden equations by DSR predicted an optimized electrocatalyst ratio of Fe-8.7 : Ni-91.3, which resulted in a minimum overpotential of 0.368 V in the water-splitting process.

However, their poor stability at high current density in corrosive seawater is the main bottleneck in the seawater electrolysis for H-2 production. Herein, a g-C3N4-supported Ni-Fe oxide nanocluster (NiOx-FeOx@g-C3N4) as an efficient and durable anode for alkaline seawater oxidation is reported. The experimental findings demonstrate that the NiOx-FeOx@g-C3N4 anode is more anticorrosive than pristine NiOx-FeOx NCs. The synergistic effect of the heterostructure enhances the corrosion resistance, structural integrity, and accelerates the gas release ability, resulting in outstanding sustainability over 100 h of continuous electrolysis at high current density without noticeable degradation and hypochlorite formation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2168-0485			WOS:000819356900001

The formation of p-n heterojunctions could form built-in field, which favors spatial charge separation. The resultant NH2-MIL53(Al)/CdS p-n heterojunctions with narrowed band gap extend the photoresponse, and have a high specific surface area of 417.7 m2 g-1, and a narrow pore size of 8.8 nm. Under visible light irradiation, the photocatalytic efficiency for reduction of Cr(VI) and removal of refractory pesticide trichlorophenol is up to 99.23 and 98.85 %, respectively. The photocatalytic oxygen evolution is also as high as 563.6 mu mol g-1 h-1. The excellent photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the efficient p-n heterojunctions accelerating charge transfer and favoring spatial charge separation, and the special mesoporous structure supplying adequate surface-active sites and facilitating mass transfer. This facile strategy opens up new insights for fabricating other p-n heterojunctions photocatalysts with efficient solar energy conversion.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663282300003

Hereby, a simple precursor-mediated strategy for synthesis of interconnected ultrathin NiFe-layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs) nanosheets is first proposed, taking the "pre-synthesized" Ni-Fe alkoxides as precursors. The electrochemical studies illustrate that Ni2Fe1-LDHs catalyst with the optimum Ni/Fe ratio shows excellent low overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1) , superior to commercial IrO2 and most reported the Ni, Fe based LDH OER electrocatalysts previously, indicating its enormous potential as a low-cost and efficient electrocatalyst for OER. We anticipated that the precursor-mediated synthetic strategy would open a new avenue to offer ultrathin LDHs based electrocatalysts for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-577X	1873-4979		WOS:000736652600006

The face-centered cubic structure of Co3O4 was confirmed through X-ray diffraction pattern. A well-defined Raman active mode of vibrations (E-g + F-2g + A(1g)) revealed the cubic Co3O4 formation. The morphology of Ag-doped Co3O4 nanorods was revealed from scanning electron microscopy images. High specific capacitance of 584 F/g at scan rate of 5 mV/s was obtained for the product synthesized at 150 degrees C. The improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for the synthesized materials was observed using linear sweep voltammogram, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and chronoamperometry. The obtained Ag-Co3O4 nanomaterials have more possibility to be adapted as OER catalyst for water splitting application. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The paper describes some catalytic properties of these hydroxides. The hydroxide-based catalysts for the water oxidation can be obtained in three modifications: bulky (individual and binary), supported on the ion exchange resins or conventional oxide supports (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, zeolites), and colloidal catalysts stabilized by starch. The possible mechanism of the catalytic reaction, including the stage of the formation of peroxocomplexes as intermediates is under discussion. Some similarities are drawn between the catalytic properties of hydroxide catalysts and those of the manganese-based oxygen evolving complex of the Photosystem II of green planes.

After preliminary tests for two kinds of sodium titanate samples with different ratio of sodium to titanium (Na2Ti6O13 and Na2Ti3O7), several sodium hexatitanate (Na2Ti6O13) photocatalysts were further prepared in the flux method by changing the various parameters such as the flux, the loading amount of the Ag cocatalyst, and the loading method of the Ag cocatalyst. As a result, a Ag/Na2Ti6O13 sample prepared in a sodium chloride flux, with 1.0 wt% of Ag cocatalyst loaded by a photodeposition method, exhibited the highest production rate (4.6 mu mol h(-1)) and the highest selectivity (74%) to carbon monoxide among the examined samples, which are more than 29 times higher production rate and 2.7 times higher selectivity to carbon monoxide than those in our previous report. Furthermore, although required oxygen production rate equivalent to the formation rates of the reduced products was not observed in our previous study, it was found that the developed AB/Na2Ti6O13(NaCl) photocatalyst produced enough amount of oxygen after a long induction period of 50 h in the present condition. The reasons for the insufficient oxygen formation in the initial period were also investigated and clarified, i.e., the chloride residues and the photoadsorption of O-2 on the surface are responsible for the insufficient O-2 evolution at the initial period.									39	1	0	0	3	0	39			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000453616800006

In fact, there is always a controversy about the main active sites in Fe-involved OER elelctrocatalysts. Herein, we demonstrate a highly active mono-Fe-based OER electrocatalyst with a very low overpotential of 283 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 41.4 mV dec(-1). Systematic characterization reveals that the OER performance stems from Na dissolution during the electrocatalytic oxidation process, enabling the electrocatalyst reconstruction to form highly defective oxyhydroxides as highly active catalytic sites. Notably, the electrocatalytic activity can be significantly promoted through the introduction of a heterotransition metal. This work provides insights for active sites in OER catalysis, along with a facile route to tune the intrinsic activity.									76	3	0	0	9	0	76			2380-8195			WOS:000430369600016

The feasibility of transmission Mossbauer spectra acquisition for the adsorbed species in the presence of dissolved forms (e.g. in situ) is based on the principle that the latter give no Mossbauer effect at room temperature owing to their diffusional mobility, while the former, being fixed at the adsorbent surface, have been shown to exhibit a sufficient resonant absorption. The effects of adsorption and adsorbent surface state on the co-ordination of ferric hydroxo complexes as well as its hydrolytic destruction in water have been noted. Some questions connected with anodic oxygen evolution electrocatalysis by iron species involved in the anodic process at the nickel hydroxide electrode are also discussed.

The significant effect of the N precursor chemical composition on the ORR activity in 0.1 M KOH and 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte solutions has been demonstrated. The half-wave potential values increased in the following order: C(SiC) < Fe + Urea/C < Fe + EDTA/C < Fe + DIPO/ C <= Fe + Phen/C <= Fe + Bipyr/C in both electrolyte solutions studied. Molar ratio of Fe:N precursor and Fe content change in the Fe + Bipyr/C catalyst was found to be negligible. Noticeable change in ORR activity has been observed after acid treatment step of Fe + Bipyr/C. The 150-h durability tests demonstrated that in terms of the activity/stability ratio the Fe + Phen/C is the best ORR catalyst.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000443664700072

At potentials located in the OER range, a fast redox electrochemical system as well as electrodichroism can be detected. These responses can be explained through anion injection and extraction coupled to changes of the water content in the anodic layer taking place during the oxidation-reduction cycles. The species formed at high positive potentials can be related to possible intermediates taking part in the OER. The voltammetric electroreduction of anodically formed Pd oxide layers exhibits several distinguishable processes within certain well-defined potential ranges, principally the electroreduction of the oxide layer, including phase changes. the formation of soluble Pd(II) species and finally Pd. The electroreduction process is influenced by the electrolyte composition.									35	0	0	0	0	0	35			0022-0728			WOS:A1992HP48000018

Here, for the first time, using silica template, a mesoporous cobalt-cobalt phosphide (Meso-Co/Co2P) electrocatalyst was produced. For investigating its structure, composition, and morphology, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were accomplished. Chronoamperometry, cyclic and linear sweep voltammetry studies exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity. It needed only an overpotential of 57 mV to produce a 10 mA cm(-2) of anodic current density. A water electrolyzer with Meso-Co/Co2P as both anode and cathode in an alkaline medium generated a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the potential of 1.57 V. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

La(Ta,Nb)O2N photoanodes were fabricated by electrophoretic deposition of La(Ta,Nb)O2N suspension in acetone onto ITO substrate. The La(Ta,Nb)O2N photoanodes were found to exhibit photoelectrochemical activity for water oxidation reaction in alkaline solution. Subsequently, a cobalt-phosphate based oxygen evolution catalyst (CoPi-OEC) was photodeposited onto the surface of the La(Ta,Nb)O2N catalyst to improve the photoelectrochemical performance. In the presence of CoPi catalyst, the photocurrent-voltage characteristics of the La(Ta,Nb)O2N electrodes were enhanced with its effect more pronounced at lower potentials. A stable photocurrent density of 20 mA/cm(2) at 1.2 V vs SCE was achieved under the illumination using alkaline phosphate solution with pH 13. Relative to the La(Ta,Nb)O2N photoanodes, nearly three times higher photocurrent density was observed at 1.2 V vs SCE for a CoPi/La(Ta,Nb)O2N photoelectrode. Perovsldte-based oxide-nitrides modified with suitable cocatalyst of CoPi, have been shown as a new pathway towards substantial photoelectrochemical current gain during the PEC water splitting reaction.

However, the stable metal-oxygen (M-O) bond forms a large energy barrier inhibiting ion diffusion. Therefore, seeking efficient and facile approaches to accelerate oxygen kinetics has become a significant issue. Here, the interaction (interfacial charge transfer and cooperative bonding) between noble metal (Pt, Ag) and perovskites oxide (SrCoO3-delta) is employed to weaken the (M-O) bond and decrease the energy barrier of oxygen migration. Noble metal layers serving as oxygen pumps can continuously extract oxygen from oxide films to the atmosphere. The temperature of the topotactic phase transition from perovskite (SrCoO3) to brownmillerite (SrCoO2.5) is remarkably lowered from approximate to 200 degrees C to room temperature. Furthermore, this approach can also be applied to SrFeO3 for similar topotactic phase reduction by moderate thermal activation. The finding of this study paves a promising and general pathway to achieve fast oxygen migration in perovskite oxides, with important application prospects in low-temperature electrodes and high-activity catalysis interface.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000694958500001

To mitigate the harm on the environment, lithium-oxygen batteries (LOBs) with a high theoretical energy density (3458 Wh kg(-1) Li2O2) compared to that of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) have been considered as an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. For this purpose, porous carbon materials have been utilized as promising air cathodes owing to their low cost, lightness, easy fabrication process, and high performance. However, the challenge thus far lies in the uncontrollable formation of Li2CO3 at the interface between carbon and Li2O2, which is detrimental to the stable electrochemical performance of carbon-based cathodes in LOBs. In this work, we successfully protected the surface of the free-standing carbon nanofibers (CNFs) by coating it with a layer of iridium metal through direct sputtering (CNFs@Ir), which significantly improved the lifespan of LOBs. Moreover, the Jr would play a secondary role as an electrochemical catalyst. This all-in-one cathode was evaluated for the formation and decomposition of Li2O2 during (dis)charging processes. Compared with bare CNFs, the CNFsgIr cathode showed two times longer lifespan with 0.2 V, lower overpotentials for the oxygen evolution reaction. We quantitatively calculated the contents of CO32- in Li2CO3 formed on the different surfaces of the bare CNFs (63% reduced) and the protected CNFsgIr (78% reduced) cathodes after charging. The protective effects and the reaction mechanism were elucidated by ex situ analyses, including scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.									13	2	0	0	0	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000600202300020	33237745

Generally, the promotion of catalytic activity of LiCoO2-based materials is mainly due to the ultra-thin layer structure with thickness of several atomic layers. Herein, a series of nanosheets are obtained from layered LiCoO2 material treated by nitric acid. More unexpectedly, although the specific surface area of the samples increases dramatically due to ultrathin nanosheets, the catalytic activities almost are not improved compared with that of bulk LiCoO2 material. After annealing process, these samples exhibit superior catalytic performance in alkaline solutions. Based on X-ray diffraction spectra, raman spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and O-2 temperature-programmed desorption analysis, the results indicate that metastable Li1-x-yHyCoO2 nanosheets are obtained from bulk LiCoO2 material treated by acid. They transform into main phase of spinel-type Li1-xCoO2-delta material with more oxygen vacancies after annealing process. The great difference in electrochemical performances between the two-type materials is attributed to the crystal structures, the exposure of Co-O octahedral sites in the plane of spinel-type Li1-xCoO2-delta, the coexistence of valence state of Con+ and oxygen vacancy.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000589936000002

The development of the ruthenium-terpyridine-bipyridine (bpyRutpy) complexes used as efficient homogeneous water oxidation catalysts is one of the currently hot research fields. All catalytic active sites of the homogeneous molecular catalyst are fully utilized, and show a high catalytic efficiency. However, the homogeneous molecular catalyst has some intrinsic shortages such as difficulty on separation, recovery and regeneration, and high cost. In view of this, we synthesized the multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-based heterogeneous catalyst, MWCNT-bpyRutpy, by covalently bonding the ruthenium-based complex onto the carbon nanotubes, in order to achieve the maximum molecular catalytic efficiency of the complex. The synthesized catalyst is fully characterized by mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and thermogravimetry. The formation of the nanocatalyst via fusing Ruthenium complexes to MWCNTs promotes the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, enhances intrinsic activity, and increases the specific surface area of electrochemical activity, and achieve excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 436 mV at 10mAcm(2), a low Tafel slope of 77.2 mV, and a relatively high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.5833 s(-1) at an overpotential of 400 mV.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000615924700003

Herein, we report selective synthesis of chi-Fe5C2 catalysts by interfering surface reactions during thermal treatment. In-situ analyses provided insight into the mechanism of the structure evolution of iron-based catalysts under varied thermal treatment atmospheres and conditions. The atmosphere of 64 %H-2/32 %CO/4 %Ar yields a compromise among the competitive oxygen removal, carbon permeation, hydrogenation and carbon deposition reactions, thus selectively forming high-purity chi-Fe5C2. Such catalyst shows high CO conversion of 96 %, selectivity to C5+ hydrocarbons of 40 % and light olefins of 30 %, and good stability under mild conditions (250 degrees C, 2.0 MPa). A plausible catalyst structure-performance relation is finally established by combining kinetics analysis with multiple characterization techniques.

Here, earth-abundant tungsten was used as a structural metal to dilute the noble metal iridium content while maintaining high activity and stability in acid. Mixed-metal oxide catalysts were synthesized using rapid plasma oxidation in which the non-equilibrium reaction environment permitted better formation of a homogenous W1-xIrxO3-delta phase. With an Ir metal content as low as 1%, a competitive and durable overpotential for oxygen evolution was achieved. Relative to high Ir content, low Ir compositions consisted of a more highly crystalline, phase-pure iridium polytungstate which was more catalytically active per Ir content. Moreover, the plasma-synthesized material had a sharp electrocatalytic improvement over an equivalent composition synthesized via standard thermal oxidation, demonstrating the value of non-equilibrium synthesis to find new catalysts.									84	3	0	0	6	0	85			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000414774500016

Success in developing a quasi-amorphous metallic nickel (QAMN) nanopowder catalyst using a two-step chemical route for efficient and durable HER in alkaline solution is reported. It is found that the QAMN electrocatalyst exhibits essentially zero overpotential at the cathodic onset while delivering 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of only 240 mV; both performances are far better than what was reported previously using prior metallic nickel catalysts. Taking into account increased surface area, further enhanced activity is attributed to the superior intrinsic activity. Meanwhile, the QAMN catalyst shows excellent stability in accelerated and interrupted polarization in alkaline solution for tens of hours. This study provides a new chemical means to prepare amorphous metallic materials for more efficient catalysis.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22				2198-3844		WOS:000453685900020	30581712

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared anodes demonstrate the layers doped on Ti plates exist in tetragonal phase of IrO2 and beta-PbO2 crystals with dendritic and pyramid shapes, respectively, benefiting to increasing anode area in water electrolysis. The electrochemical measurements including cyclic voltammetry (CV), polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) performed in Na2SO4 solution indicate the IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti anode possesses higher oxygen evolution activity compared with those of Pt and beta-PbO2/Ti ones; this is because of its excellent abilities in enlarging electrode area, decreasing oxygen evolution potential (OEP) and increasing oxidation kinetics for water decomposition, which effectively enhances the CO2 reduction. The faradic and energy efficiencies of IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti anode are 40.2% and 27.4%, raising by ratios of 7.2%, 81.1% and 12.8%, 242.5% to those of Pt and beta-PbO2/Ti, respectively, at applied current of 0.3 A and reaction time of 24 h during formate production. Moreover, the power consumption lowered to 13.0 kW h/kg formate on IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti anode was achieved and it is much less than those on other two anodes, offsetting about 53.8% of the input energy if prices of the formate and electricity are overall taken into account. Therefore, anode materials highly affect the reductive kinetics and employment of anodes with lower OEP is a cost-effective strategy for electrochemical CO2 reduction.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2212-9820	2212-9839		WOS:000439069700042

In particular, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media, which plays a key role in proton exchange membrane electrolyzers for fast hydrogen fuel generation, seriously suffers from rapid degradation of catalysts as a result of the harsh acidic and oxidative conditions. Here, we report a rational design strategy for the fabrication of a heterostructured OER electrocatalyst (Ru@IrOx) that has unique physicochemical properties and in which a strong charge redistribution exists between a highly strained ruthenium core and a partially oxidized iridium shell across the metal-metal oxide heterojunction. The increased valence of the iridium shell and the decreased valence of the ruthenium core activate a synergistic electronic and structural interaction, which results in the enhanced activity and stability of the catalyst compared with the majority of the state-of-the-art ruthenium- and iridium-based materials.									211	11	0	0	10	0	215			2451-9294			WOS:000458660100017

Electro-catalytic degradation of acetamiprid was evaluated using an Er doped Ti/SnO2-Sb electrode prepared by the Pechini method. The acetamiprid degradation obeys first order reaction kinetics and is controlled by mass transport and oxygen evolution. TOC removal efficiency and UV scan curves revealed that some intermediate products were produced by the Er doped Ti/SnO2-Sb electrode. Through electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry, the ion mass-to-charge ratio of intermediate products was determined. Combining the experimental results, a degradation pathway was proposed for the electro-catalytic degradation of acetamiprid. Electrodes were mainly characterized by linear sweep voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry. The acetamiprid and TOC concentrations were reduced to 87.45% and 69.31%, respectively, after 180 min of electrolysis at 10 mA cm(-2).									7	1	0	0	2	0	8				2046-2069		WOS:000359568400058

In this study, porous Mn-doped FeP/Co-3(PO4)(2) (PMFCP) nanosheets on carbon cloth are utilized as a highly efficient 3D self-supported binder-free integrated electrode for the oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER) over a wide pH range. Specifically, overpotentials of 27, 117, 85mV are required for the PMFCP nanosheets to attain 10mAcm(-2) for HER in 0.5m H2SO4, 1.0m phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), and 1.0m KOH, respectively. In addition to the excellent performance for HER electrocatalysis, PMFCP nanosheets were also efficient electrocatalysts for the OER. Thus, the PMFCP nanosheets can serve as anodes and cathodes for overall water splitting (OWS). The OWS working voltages to attain 10mAcm(-2) are found to be 1.75, 1.82, and 1.61V in acid, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Chronopotentiometric tests show that the PMFCP electrode can maintain its excellent pH-universal OWS activity for more than 30000s. This work also provides new insights into developing high-performance electrocatalysts for water splitting over a wide pH range. The improvement in electrochemical performance by introduction of Mn dopant and nano-holes offers new opportunities in the development of effective electrodes for other energy-related applications.									62	7	0	0	1	0	63			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000467235500006	30672152

However, the formed Fe-O bonds are not conducive to the dissociation of water molecule, which thus inhibit oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a facial on-site activation strategy is proposed to improve the OER activity of FeOOH by P doping. By optimizing the electronic structure, the obtained electrode exhibits an overpotential of 203 and 263 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Systematic experiments and theoretical analysis suggest that P doping can optimize the adsorption energy of OER intermediates by forming P-O bonds. Therefore, it enables P-FeOOH as a low-cost and efficient electrocatalyst and provides a strategy for designing new highly active and cost-effective catalysts for OER. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The nature of active sites, however, remains unclear. Here, we study whether S could promote the OER activity of FeCoOOH and try to identify the catalytically active centers. Density functional theory suggests that two coordinating S could work synergistically with one adjacent Fe to optimize the electronic states of Co, resulting in decreased binding energy of OH* (Delta E-OH) while little changed Delta O-E, and thus significantly lowering the catalytic overpotential. Further experimental studies validate the synergistic effect between S and Fe on tuning the electronic structure and the greatly improved catalytic activity with a small overpotential of 225.3 mV to drive 20 mA cm(-2). This study reveals the origin of the high catalytic activity of transition metal sulfides and provides insights into the design of efficient OER electrocatalysts.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6				2666-3864		WOS:000658762100015

The pyrolysis reaction mechanisms from the organic PCS to ceramic SiC were investigated by the analysis of gases evolved during heat treatment. There were two steps in the major reaction: the first step was at 800-1200 K where H-2 and CH4 evolved by scission of Si-CH3 and Si-H and by rearrangement reactions, and the second step was at 1000-1700 K where H-2 evolved by reactions related to C atoms in the PCS main chain.

The reaction kinetics have been studied as a function of time and temperature for composites with whiskers preoxidized for different times. The evolution of the microstructure has been investigated by optical, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Possible reaction mechanisms have been discussed. A model compatible with our observations on Al2O3-ZrO2-SiC and the results reported in the literature for Al2O3-SiC whisker composites is proposed: The oxidation occurs at an internal reaction front. Oxygen diffuses along dislocations and grain boundaries through the mullite scale to react at this front with silicon carbide, thereby forming amorphous silica and graphite. Silica penetrates grain boundaries and further reacts with alumina and zirconia to form mullite and zircon, while the second reaction product, graphite, is oxidized into carbon monoxide when the reaction front moves deeper into the sample.

Here, we prepared metal-nitrogen doped carbon shield (Me-NC) NiFe nanoparticles (NiFe-NC/Me-NC) by simple template nano-casting, and then selectively removed metal species on the surface or destroyed the core-shell structure to investigate whether the metal core or the metal doped surface are responsible for the activity enhancement. We show that, for the first time, a synergistic effect together with the electron penetration from metal doped NC shell to metal core is responsible for the enhancement of surface catalytic reaction. The core/shell structure insulates the metal core from electrolyte and the metal core act as electron receptor to modify the surface electronic structure. The electrochemical evaluations show that the as-synthesized NiFe-NC/Me-NC exhibits high electrocatalytic activity, which affords the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 231 mV and 271 mV for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions as well as excellent stability in alkaline medium. While both the NiFe-NC/Me-NC sample after ball-milled with the core-shell structure destroyed and the sample after acid leached with surface metal NPs removed show a remarkably decreased activity, confirming the synergistic effect between NPs core and Me-NC-sheet for efficient catalytic performance.

In order to acquire large-scale hydrogen production, low-cost and robust bifunctional catalysts are needed to catalyze hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Herein, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT) arrays are successfully constructed on the carbon cloth (CC) as bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting via a facile strategy. Structural analyses indicate that the Ni and MoC nanoparticles are encapsulated in the NCNTs. Experimental results imply that the synergistic effect between Ni and MoC, high electrical conductivity, and binder-free electrode configuration endow the self-supported electrode to have excellent activities with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), at low overpotentials of 70 and 219 mV for HER and OER, respectively. When applied as two-electrode electrolyzer, the self-supported electrodes only need a cell voltage of 1.535 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), superior to the benchmark Pt/C and IrO2 couple. Furthermore, the electrolyzer exhibits remarkable stability even at a current density beyond 100 mA cm(-2) over 30 h. This strategy will open a facile method to the expansion of high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts for commercial water splitting.									52	3	0	0	3	0	52			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000600990500005

The passive behavior, oxide formation and the structure of the near-surface region are characterized by means of cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and XPS studies. Electrochemical measurements and complementary surface analytical studies reveal the formation of a nearsurface region which can be described as amorphous non-stoichiometric SiOx, SiOxCy. After polarization at 1500 mV(SCE) the thickness of this oxidized region is in the range of 4-5 nanometers. The formation reaction of SiC to SiOx is explained by a 4-electron mechanism under the formation of carbon. Additionally, anodic oxygen evolution must be assumed to 20 %-30 % efficiency at this potential.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000557898600029

Blended oxides of Ir and Ru are superior for water oxidation whereas mixtures of Pt and Ir perform better when both oxidation of water and reduction of oxygen are required on the same electrode. A strategy for rationing these elements is explored by the formation of a thin film using a dry, flame process. IrxPt1-xO2-y and IrxRu1-xO2-y were both deposited from the vapor phase, as thin films, onto substrates of glassy carbon, polypropylene, and quartz. Elemental analysis of the Ir-Pt electrode suggests a stoichiometry of Ir0.56Pt0.44O2-y. Bulk diffraction of the film shows two separate phases consisting of Pt metal and IrO2. The sample showed signs of spallation after 10 cycles when scanned between 1.2 and 1.7 V. A weak oxygen evolution current of 0.8-0.4 mA/mg was measured at 1.6 V. Elemental analysis of the Ru-Ir film suggests a ratio of Ru0.41Ir0.59O2-y. Phases of a homogeneous solid-solution of IrO2 and RuO2 and to a lesser extent Ru metal are shown by bulk X-ray diffraction. An exceptional oxygen evolution current of 25-40 mA/cm(2) was observed for the Ru0.41Ir0.59O2-y sample corresponding to a normalized mass activity of 400 mA/mg, (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

AHMPD, a compound practically inert towards the attack of singlet molecular oxygen (O-2((1)Delta(g))), quenches excited singlet and triplet states of Rf with rate constants of 2.7 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) and 2.7 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1), respectively. In the presence of AHMPD, the photodecomposition of Rf, which occurs from the excited triplet state of the pigment, depends on the concentration of the fungicide: at greater than or equal to40-50 mM a limited photochemistry occurs due to the quenching of excited singlet Rf, while at ca. 5-10 mM triplet Rf is largely photogenerated and subsequently quenched either by oxygen, giving rise to O-2((1)Delta(g)), or by AHMPD, yielding semireduced Rf through an electron transfer process. Flash photolysis experiments and indirect auxiliary tests confirm the presence of superoxide anion generated by the reaction of Rf anion radical with the dissolved oxygen. The neat result of this intricate scheme of competitive reactions is the photodegradation of both AHMPD and Rf, mainly through a superoxide anion-mediated oxidation, although some contribution of O-2((1)Delta(g))-mediated photooxidations cannot be disregarded.									30	1	0	0	18	0	31			0008-4042			WOS:000173701000007

H2O2 is oxidized and reduced into two different, but interrelated electron transfer processes. As the potential increases, the reduction of H2O2 switches rapidly to its oxidation at -E>0.9 V. The whole process exhibits a marked hysteresis in the mixed charge transfer-diffusion controlled potential region, together with current overshoots at E>0.85 V and E<0.27 V in quiescent solutions. At high potentials, Pt(111) oxides and O-2 evolution explain the current-potential characteristics, while at low potentials, hydrogen adsorption is at the origin of the current response.

Polyaniline (PANI) and nickel (Ni) are sequentially electro-deposited on the surface of CC, which are then transformed into NPC and Ni2P by an in-situ carbonization-phosphorization combined process. The electrode surface is distributed with large amounts of uniform macropores, which could expose more active sites and enhance the interfacial exchange with the electrolyte. The Ni2P@NPC@CC electrode delivers early overpotentials of 92 and 280 mV vs. Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline condition, respectively. The electrolytic cell with Ni2P@NPC@CC electrode both as anode and cathode can achieve 10 mA cm(-2) at a small bias of 1.54 V for the overall water splitting. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicates that combination with Ni2P and NPC can decrease Gibbs free energy for H* adsorption (Delta G(H).) and increase charge density on the interface, thus could lead to the enhanced activity for water splitting. The free-standing and noblemetal free Ni2P@NPC@CC electrode is stable, highly active and cost effective, thus have great potential for the hydrogen production. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

J	Li, Guang-Lan; Cao, Shuo; Lu, Zhong-Fa; Wang, Xin; Yan, Yang; Hao, Ce								FePc nanoclusters modified NiCo layered double hydroxides in parallel with Ti3C2 MXene as a highly efficient and durable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for zinc-air batteries								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				591						153142	10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.153142				JUL 30 2022	2022	Boosting the bifunctional oxygen activity of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) is a frontier but challenging issue for metal-air batteries. Herein, an iron phthalocyanine (FePc) nanocluster modified NiCo LDH in parallel with Ti3C2 (FePc-NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2) two-dimensional multilayer structured bifunctional oxygen catalyst is engineered by growing NiCo-LDH in parallel with Ti3C2 followed with adsorbing FePc via electrostatic interaction approach. Thanks to the abundant retained Fe-N-x active sites, the FePc-NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2 catalyzes the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 80 mV positive compared to Pt/C. Besides, the current density only drops 5% after 33,000 s of chronoamperometry test, confirming the robust ORR stability. On the other hand, there are electronic interactions formed between FePc nanocluster and NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2 which boosts the OER activity as demonstrated by the negatively shifted potential of 89 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) versus RuO2. The overall ORR/OER activity makes FePc-NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2 ranking top among the most active analogous samples. The Zn-air battery (ZAB) assembled with FePc-NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2 as air electrode exhibits a peak power density of 148 mW cm(-2) and can be charge-discharged continuously for 80 h. This direct engineering ORR/OER active center strategy offers a unique facile direction for the fabrication of oxygen electrode catalysts for renewable clean energy devices.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000793197600001

Herein, we report a facile bottom-up strategy for the preparation of high performance supported electrocatalysts for overall water-splitting reaction via a rationally designed defect covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) support. Specifically, defect CTFs are obtained via binary-precursor polymerization, followed by loading Ru nanoparticles (Ru/D-CTFs-90 0) with high HER performance at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The overpotential is only 17 mV. Calcination of the resultant Ru-RuO2/D-CTFs-30 0 in air, produces excellent OER performance with 190 mV overpotential (at 10 mA cm(-2)). Furthermore, overall water splitting measurements reveal the potential of 1.47 V, which is better than the majority of the reported Ru-based catalysts. Moreover, density functional theory calculation results show that excellent electrocatalytic properties are attributed to the synergistic effect of Ru nanoparticles and carbon support.

The TRPL analysis reveals that the concentrations of weak oxygen bonding and NOV defects with lifetimes of 12 - 16 ns in as-implanted SiO2:Si+ are 3-4 x 10(17) cm(-3), agreeing well with those determined using C-V analysis. The NOV and weak oxygen-bonding defects reach their maximum densities and the shortest emission lifetimes of 7.0 x 10(18) cm(-3) and 3.6 - 7.2 ns, respectively, after annealing for 1.5 - 3 h. These results support the dissociation of SiO2 matrix during a Si-implanting process with a reaction of O-3 equivalent to Si-O-Si equivalent to O-3 -> O-3 equivalent to Si-Si equivalent to O-3 + O-interstitial -> NOV + (1/2) O-O, which is the origin of the strong blue-green CWPL observed in the SiO2:Si+. The regrowth of SiO2 matrix after long-term annealing is also confirmed by the significant reduction of NOV and weak oxygen bonding defects. In contrast, the concentration of the E-delta' center reveals a slowly increasing trend due to the less pronounced precipitation of nanocrystallite Si in SiO2:Si+ during the annealing process.

J	Hundelt, M; Hays, AMA; Debus, RJ; Junge, W								Oxygenic photosystem II: The mutation D1-D61N in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 retards S-state transitions without affecting electron transfer from Y-Z to P-680(+)								BIOCHEMISTRY				37	41			14450	14456		10.1021/bi981164j				OCT 13 1998	1998	Photosynthetic oxygen evolution is powered by photosystem II (PSII), in particular by the oxidized chl a-aggregate P-680(+), and catalyzed by the oxygen-evolving complex (Mn4X-entity) as well as a tyrosine residue (Yz). The role of particular amino acids as cofactors of electron and proton transfer or as modulators of the activity is still ill-defined. The effects of single-site mutations at the donor side of PSII on the partial reactions of water oxidation have been primarily studied in whale cells. Because of better signal-to-noise in oxygen-evolving core preparations more detailed information on the electronic, protonic, and electrostatic events is expected from studies with such material. We investigated cells and oxygen-evolving core preparations from the wildtype of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and point-mutants of D1-D61. In cells, oxygen-release was slowed drastically in D61A (8-fold) and D61N (10-fold) compared to WT, whereas it remained unchanged in D61E within the time resolution of the measurements. In core preparations, the S-1 double right arrow S-2 and S-2 double right arrow S-3 transitions were slowed approximately 2-fold in D61N compared to WT. However, the nanosecond components of electron transfer from Y-Z to P-680(+) were unchanged in the same mutant, We conclude that substitution of a neutral residue for D1-D61 selectively affects electron-transfer events on the donor side of Y-2.									72	0	0	0	56	0	72			0006-2960			WOS:000076485000013	9772171

N-2 gas was exposed to a clean Si(100) surface at 800 degrees C and this surface was subsequently reacted with O-2 gas at 700 degrees C. Scanning tunneling microscope measurement of surface morphology showed that silicon nanodots with an average size of 5 nm were formed as a result of selective oxygen etching of the silicon surface. Silicon nitride islands of a few nanometers acted successfully as masks against oxygen etching at high temperatures. The number density of silicon nanodots is estimated to be 1 x 10(12)/cm(2). The lowering of nitridation temperature to 700 degrees C resulted in similar silicon nanodots with a little bit smaller sizes, indicating that silicon nitride islands formed even at this temperature can be successfully used as masks for oxygen exposure. Owing to the relatively low thermal mobility of nitrogen species, Si nanodots with uniform sizes could be obtained on the Si(100) substrate. (C) 2000 American Vacuum Society.

However, it suffers from low quantum efficiency caused by the fast combination of photogenerated electrons and holes. In this work, we investigate the electronic and photocatalytic properties of three newly proposed g-C3N4/SiP-GaS-alpha, -beta and -gamma heterojunctionsviafirst principles predictions. Theoretical results demonstrate that the three g-C3N4/SiP-GaS heterojunctions exhibit direct bandgaps of similar to 2.2 eV, and have a type-II band alignment with the valence band maximum (VBM) located at the g-C(3)N(4)layer and the conduction band minimum (CBM) at the SiP-GaS layer. Furthermore, their band edges straddle the redox potential of water in a wide range of biaxial strain. Their absorption coefficients are several times larger than that of most previously discovered 2D heterojunctions. Moreover, the in-built electric field adds a driving force to separate photogenerated electrons and holes. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) successfully take place on the g-C(3)N(4)and SiP-GaS layers, respectively. Briefly, separated charge carriers, suitable band edges and strong visible-light absorbance, successful OER and HER enable the three g-C3N4/SiP-GaS heterojunctions to be promising water-splitting photocatalysts.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000549894000048	32618305

Three temperatures, i.e., 500 degrees C, 600 degrees C, and 700 degrees C were chosen to perform the CO2 thermal treatment, resulting into BSCF-500, BSCF-600, and BSCF-700 samples. The OER was enhanced in the order of BSCF-500 < BSCF-700 < BSCF-600. BSCF-600 showed the best OER performance, i.e., a low overpotential of 0.36 V required to attain 10 mA cm(-2) current density as well as a mass activity of 74.14 Ag-cat(-1) and a specific activity of 5.04 mA cm(cat)(-2) at an overpotential of 0.4 V. The OER performance durability of BSCF-600 was highlighted by its ability to maintain a stable potential of around 1.61 V vs. RHE (RHE: reversible hydrogen electrode) when charged at a constant current density of 10 mA cm(-2) through out the 800 min continuous chronopotentiometry test. The enhanced OER performance for BSCF-600 relative to the original BSCF is attributed to three factors: (i) higher electrochemically active surface area; (ii) faster charge transfer rate and higher electrical conductivity; and (iii) modified oxidation state of cobalt ions. The formation of thin carbonate layer in BSCF-600 appears to suppress the durability issue observed in BSCF.

The durability of anode was significantly extended by determining factors influencing the lifetime in preparation of the electrocatalysts and by improving the intermediate layer preventing oxidation of the titanium substrate in the anode. The electrocatalysts for durable anode should not be too thin and too thick. The specific resistance of deposit affected the thickness of electrocatalysts deposited anodically. Mo6+ increases the specific resistance while W6+ and Sn4+ decrease it. The best composition of the electrolyte for preparation of Mn1-x-yMoxSnyO2+x electrocatalyst was determined on the basis of the roles of additive elements. The lifetime was significantly extended by repetitive deposition for 30 min three times with washing and drying of the anode and renewing of the electrolyte at every intermission. The intermediate layer consisting of Sn1-x-yIrxSbyO2+0.5x instead of IrO2 prevented effectively oxidation of titanium.

The electrodes are prepared by electrochemical deposition of 1.8-3.5 nm thick Cr2O3 films on Rh and Pt plates and are evaluated as model systems of Rh/Cr2O3 and Pt/Cr2O3 core/shell particulates, which have previously been applied effectively as cocatalysts for hydrogen evolution in this system. Proton adsorption/desorption and H-2 evolution currents are observed for both the Cr2O3-coated and the bare electrodes, and the infrared absorption band due to Pt-H stretching (2039 cm(-1)) is apparent for both the coated and the bare electrodes. These observations indicate that the Cr2O3 layer does not interfere with proton reduction or hydrogen evolution and that proton reduction takes place at the Cr2O3/Pt interface. However, the reduction of oxygen to water is suppressed only in the Cr2O3-coated samples. The Cr2O3 layer is thus permeable to protons and the evolved hydrogen molecules, but not to oxygen. Cocatalyst modification by thin films with this type of functionality thus appears to be a useful strategy for improving the efficiency of photocatalytic overall water splitting.									174	6	0	0	10	0	176			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000266679500027

Gas phase or liquid phase species may adsorb and react with individual surface atoms altering the solid-gas and solid-liquid electronic and chemical properties of the interface. A comprehensive understanding of chemical and electrochemical interfaces with respect to their responses to external stimuli is still missing. The evolution of the structure and composition of shape-selected octahedral PtNi nanoparticles (NPs) in response to chemical (gas-phase) and electrochemical (liquid-phase) environments was studied, and contrasted to that of pure Pt and spherical PtNi NPs. The NPs were exposed to thermal annealing in hydrogen, oxygen, and vacuum, and the resulting NP surface composition was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In gaseous environments, the presence of O-2 during annealing (300 degrees C) lead to a strong segregation of Ni species to the NP surface, the formation of NiO, and a Pt-rich NP core, while a similar treatment in H-2 lead to a more homogenous Pt-Ni alloy core, and a thinner NiO shell. Further, the initial presence of NiO species on the as-prepared samples was found to influence the atomic segregation trends upon low temperature annealing (300 degrees C). This is due to the fact that at this temperature nickel is only partially reduced, and NiO favors surface segregation. The effect of electrochemical cycling in acid and alkaline electrolytes on the structure and composition of the octahedral PtNi NPs was monitored using image-corrected high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM). Sample pretreatments in surface active oxygenates, such as oxygen and hydroxide anions, resulted in oxygen-enriched Ni surfaces (Ni oxides and/or hydroxides). Acid treatments were found to strongly reduce the content of Ni species on the NP surface, via its dissolution in the electrolyte, leading to a Pt-skeleton structure, with a thick Pt shell and a Pt-Ni core. The presence of Ni hydroxides on the NP surface was shown to improve the kinetics of the electrooxidation of CO and the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions. The affinity to water and the oxophilicity of Ni hydroxides are proposed as likely origin of the observed effects.									76	4	0	0	4	0	77			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000321591000006	24015578

After calcination, CoG@F127/GO is transformed into one derivative, Co nanoparticles coated with a trace amount of carbon (Co-C) on GO (Co-C/GO). The Co nanoparticles consist of an atypical core-shell structure, in which the core and the shell are both Co. Co-C anchored on GO can avoid the nanoparticles aggregation and expose more active sites for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to significantly improve the catalyst activity of HER. CoG@F127/GO is phosphatized to form the other derivate, cobalt pyrophosphate coated with a small amount of carbon (Co2P2O7-C) on GO (Co2P2O7-C/GO). Co2P2O7-C/GO composite owns a large electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and fast rate towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Furthermore, the two derivatives of CoG@F127/GO, i.e. Co-C/GO and Co2P2O7-C/GO as twin flowers, are assembled into an overall water splitting electrolytic cell with a cell voltage of 1.56 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(2).

Benefitting from the surface-exposed Ir-SAs, Ir-1/Ni1.6Mn1.4O4 reveals boosted oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, achieving overpotentials of 330 and 350 mV at current densities of 100 and 200 mA cm(-2) in alkaline seawater. Moreover, only a cell voltage of 1.50 V is required to reach 500 mA cm(-2) with assembled Ir-1/Ni1.6Mn1.4O4||Pt/C electrode pair under the industrial operating condition. The experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations highlight the effect of Ir-SAs on improving the intrinsic OER activity and facilitating surface charge transfer kinetics, and evidence the energetically stabilized *OOH and the destabilized chloride ion adsorption in Ir-1/Ni1.6Mn1.4O4. This work demonstrates an effective method to produce efficient alkaline seawater electrocatalyst massively.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2198-3844		WOS:000773408900001	35343099

Herein, a novel Fe-Ni5P4/Fe-Ni2P (H-FeNiP) heterojunction electrocatalyst is developed by simultaneously taking advantage of the heterojunction effect and the doping effect. It shows excellent activity for both the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in alkaline solution, which only require overpotentials of 231 +/- 3 mV and 86 +/- 8 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the heterojunction structure can induce charge transfer from the underlying layer to the surface, which is effective in reducing the activation energy barrier for the HER and OER intermediates. This favorable activity enables the H-FeNiP couple to exhibit an impressive solar-to-hydrogen performance when connected with an organic solar cell (PTB7-Th/PC71BM/CO(i)8DFIC), the power conversion ratio of which (73.10%) is even higher than that of the commercial Pt||RuO2 couple (69.98%). Overall, this study conceptually provides an alternative avenue for cost-effective hydrogen generation in an environmentally friendly manner for the future.									12	2	0	0	0	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000609149500045

Herein, we developed a facile template-free method to fabricate a new type of non-noble metal-based hybrid catalyst which consists of binary FeNi alloy/nitride nanocrystals with graphitic-shell and biomass-derived N-doped carbon (NC) (FexNiyN@C/NC). This novel nanostructure exhibits superior performance for ORR/OER, which can be attributed to the strong interactions between the graphitic-shell encapsulated FeNi alloy/nitride nanocrystals and the N-doped porous carbon substrate. The X-ray absorption spectroscopy technique was employed to reveal the underlying mechanisms for the excellent performance. The assembled Zn-air battery device exhibits outstanding charging/discharging performance and cycling stability, indicating the great potential of this type of novel catalysts.									41	8	0	0	2	0	41				2637-9368		WOS:000669753200010

Lithium nitrate was recently proposed as a promising salt for LOB because of its capability to stabilize the lithium anode by the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase, its low level of dissociation in aprotic solvents, and its catalytic effect toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in rechargeable LOB. Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of the influence of nitrate on the stability and electrochemical response of the cathode in LOB is yet to be realized. Additionally, it is well accepted that carbon instability toward oxidation therefore, it is essential to investigate the effect of electrolyte components on this side of the battery. In the present work, we show that nitrate leads to interfacial changes, which result in the formation of a surface protection domain on the carbon scaffold of LOB cathode, which helps in suppressing the oxidative damage of the carbon. This effect is conjugated with an additional electrocatalytic effect of the nitrate ion on the OER Using in operando online electrochemical mass spectroscopy, we herein deconvolute these two positive effects and show how they are dependent on nitrate concentration and the potential of cell operation. We show that a low amount of nitrate can exhibit the catalytic behavior; however, in order to harness its ability to suppress the oxidative damage and passivate the carbon surface, an excess of LiNO3 is required.									27	2	0	0	0	0	27			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000444355700043	30094988	
J	Vonrueti, Nathalie; Aschauer, Ulrich								Catalysis on oxidized ferroelectric surfaces-Epitaxially strained LaTiO2N and BaTiO3 for photocatalytic water splitting								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				152	2					024701	10.1063/1.5135751				JAN 14 2020	2020	Surface properties of ferroelectrics are promising for catalysis due to the spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by an applied electric field. While several theoretical studies show different catalytic activities for differently polarized ferroelectric surfaces at zero electric potential, little work was devoted to catalysis on ferroelectric surfaces at higher electric potentials. Under these conditions that are relevant for photocatalytic experiments and applications, surfaces are usually oxidized. Using density functional theory calculations, we show for LaTiO2N and BaTiO3 that this oxidation heavily impacts and even determines the electronic properties of the catalyst surface and therefore leads to similar reaction free energies for the catalytic steps of the oxygen evolution reaction, irrespective of the bulk polarization. This is opposed to experimental studies, which found different activities for differently polarized catalyst surface domains under oxidizing conditions. We therefore conclude that the experimentally observed activity difference does not originate from the surface polarization following the bulk polarization, but rather from different bulk polarization directions leading to different adsorbate coverages or even surface reconstructions.

Ni(OH)(2)@Ni2P/E-NF exhibits superior activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction with an overpotential of only 43 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and a good durability during the long-term operation in an alkaline medium. The excellent performance of Ni(OH)(2)@Ni2P/E-NF is likely ascribed to the strong interfacial coupling of Ni(OH)(2) and Ni2P, which promotes the dissociation of water and concomitantly converts hydrogen intermediates (Had) to H-2.									24	6	0	0	0	0	26			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000434467700003

Amorphous mixed-metal hydroxide nanostructures for advanced water oxidation catalysts								NANOSCALE				8	9			5015	5023		10.1039/c5nr08989a				2016	2016	The design of highly efficient, durable, and earth-abundant catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial in order to promote energy conversion and storage processes. Here, we synthesize amorphous mixed-metal (Ni-Fe) hydroxide nanostructures with a homogeneous distribution of Ni/Fe as well as a tunable Ni/Fe ratio by a simple, facile, green and low-cost electrochemical technique, and we demonstrate that the synthesized amorphous nanomaterials possess ultrahigh activity and super long-term cycle stability in the OER process. The amorphous Ni0.71Fe0.29(OH)(x) nanostructure affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of a mere 0.296 V and a small Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1), while no deactivation is detected in the CV testing even up to 30 000 cycles, which suggests the promising application of these amorphous nanomaterials in electrochemical oxidation. Meanwhile, the distinct catalytic activities among these amorphous Ni-Fe hydroxide nanostructures prompts us to take notice of the composition of the alloy hydroxides/oxides when studying their catalytic properties, which opens an avenue for the rational design and controllable preparation of such amorphous nanomaterials as advanced OER electrocatalysts.									47	1	0	0	3	0	47			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000371479000025	26864279

Herein, a novel self-supporting hierarchically porous NixFe-S/NiFe2O4 heterostructure as bifunctional electrocatalyst was constructed based on porous Ni-Fe electrodeposition on three-dimensional (3D) carbon fiber cloth, in situ oxidation, and chemical sulfuration. Results showed that the NixFe-S/NiFe2O4 heterostructure with a large specific surface area exhibits good bifunctional activity and stability for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) because of the abundance of active sites, synergistic effect of the heterostructure, superhydrophilic surface, and stable, self-supporting structure. The results further confirmed that the NixFe-S phase in the heterostructure is transformed into metal oxides/hydroxides and Ni3S2 during OER. Compared with the commercial 20wt% Pt/C parallel to IrO2-Ta2O5 electrolyzer, the self-supporting Ni1/5Fe-S/NiFe2O4 parallel to Ni1/2Fe-S/NiFe2O4 electrolyzer exhibits better stability and lower cell voltage in the fluctuating current density range of 10-500 mA/cm(2). Particularly, the cell voltage of Ni1/5Fe-S/NiFe2O4 parallel to Ni1/2Fe-S/NiFe2O4 is only approximately 3.91 V at an industrial current density of 500 mA/cm(2), which is lower than that of the 20wt% Pt/C parallel to IrO2-Ta2O5 electrolyzer (i.e., approximately 4.79 V). This work provides a promising strategy to develop excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts for fluctuating overall water splitting.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1674-4799	1869-103X		WOS:000787300900017

We recently demonstrated that directly-excited solid state N-15 NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the determination of such positions in N-doped carbon at natural N-15 isotope abundance. Here we report a green chemistry approach for the synthesis of N-doped carbon using cellulose as a precursor, and a study of the catalytic properties and atomic structures of the related catalyst. N-doped carbon (NH3) was obtained by the oxidation of cellulose with HNO3 followed by ammonolysis at 800 degrees C. It had a N content of 6.5 wt% and a surface area of 557 m(2) g(-1), and N-15 ssNMR spectroscopy provided evidence for graphitic nitrogen besides regular pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogen. This structural determination allowed probing the role of graphitic nitrogen in electrocatalytic reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and nitrite reduction reaction. The N-doped carbon catalyst (NH3) showed higher electrocatalytic activities in the OER and HER under alkaline conditions and higher activity for nitrite reduction, as compared with a catalyst prepared by the carbonization of HNO3-treated cellulose in N-2. The electrocatalytic selectivity for nitrite reduction of the N-doped carbon catalyst (NH3) was directly related to the graphitic nitrogen functions. Complementary structural analyses by means of C-13 and H-1 ssNMR, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and low-temperature N-2 adsorption were performed and provided support to the findings. The results show that directly-excited N-15 ssNMR spectroscopy at natural N-15 abundance is generally capable of providing information on N-doped carbon materials if relaxation properties are favorable. It is expected that this approach can be applied to a wide range of solids with an intermediate concentration of N atoms.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000645108200001	33912887

Owing to the high conductivity and ion transport capacity of its unique nitrogen carbon structure, and synergistic effect of dual-metal active sites on modulating electronic structure, Nb/Ta-NOC catalyst exhibited an excellent catalytic performance and a remarkable electrochemical stability in triiodide reduction reaction (IRR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Nb/Ta-NOC catalyst achieved an ideal conversion efficiency of 8.45% for IRR in solar cells, which was higher than that of Pt electrode (7.63%). Furthermore, Nb/Ta-NOC catalyst exhibited a small overpotential of 145 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 77 mV dec(-1) for HER.

Here we report for the first time the synthesis of NiO/carbon hollow fibres (NiO-HF) by the Solution Blow Spinning (SBS) technique, and a study of their catalytic activity towards the OER in alkaline medium. The hollow fibres were obtained with ca. 300 nm in diameter consisting of agglomerated NiO nanoparticles with an average size of 50 nm which is close to the tubular wall thickness. The formation mechanism of the hollow structure was discussed. It was revealed that the carbon from polyenic branch of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) resists the firing treatment and acts as an agglomerating agent, thus ensuring a conductive and percolating path between NiO nanoparticles along the fibres. A battery of electrochemical tests of NiO-HF supported by commercial Ni foam reveals excellent electrochemical activity for OER in 1 M KOH, in comparison with reference NiO nanoparticles (NiO-NP, diameter ca. 23 nm). NiO-HF attains an overpotential of 340 mV vs. RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is amongst the lowest values reported in the literature for undoped NiO. Chronopotentiometry reveals stable NiO-HF electrodes over 15 h under an electrolysis current of 25 mA cm(-2). Microscopic analysis shows that the fibrillar morphology is completely preserved after the electrolysis test. The remarkable performance of the NiO-HF catalyst is ascribed to the enhanced electronic conductivity resulting from the interpenetrating NiO-HF/carbon microstructure.

Firstly, binary Ni0.5Fe0.5Se2 hydroxide nanosheets have been electrodeposited on CFC. Secondly, a solvothermal selenization process has been used to convert Nio.sFeo.s/CFC into Ni0.5Fe0.5Se2/CFC. XRD shows that Ni0.5Fe0.5Se2 on CFC has the typically octahedral crystalline. XPS proves the existence and valence of Ni, Fe and Se. SEM images show that Ni0.5Fe0.5Se2 has novel pyrite-type octahedral morphology with uniform size and good dispersion on the surface of CFC. SEM elemental mapping images confirm the good distribution of Ni, Fe, Se element on CFC. TEM and SAED provide the clear diffraction rings of octahedral Ni0.5Fe0.5Se2, which is consistent with the results of XRD. Furtherly, the effect of different ratio of Ni/Fe (NixFe1-xSe2 x=0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1) on OER performances has been systematically investigated. The electrochemical measurements results show that Ni0.5Fe0.5Se2/CFC (x=0.5) possesses the better electrocatalytic activity with the lower overpotential, Tafel slope and long-term stability than other samples. The enhanced activity of Ni0.5Fe0.5Se2/CFC may be attributed to the intrinsic activity of binary NiasFeo.sSez and faster electron transfer rate derived from CFC support. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, CdS/NiCo LDH catalyst with S-scheme heterogeneous is successfully prepared by the method of electrostatic self-assembly. Compared with CdS, the hydrogen evolution performance over the appropriate CdS/NiCo LDH is increased by 3.6 times. This is because the tight coupling of the contact interface between CdS and NiCo LDH and the matching of the band gap structure improve the transmission efficiency of photogenerated electrons. Ultraviolet-visible and photoluminescence experiments have proved that the separation efficiency of electrons and holes, the light absorption intensity and the charge lifetime of the composite catalyst have been greatly improved.

Half cell fabrication was achieved with usage of binder free in situ grown SnS/Ni foam working electrode in alkaline medium for supercapacitor and water oxidation. Higher specific capacitance of 686F/g at 10 mV/s and 145F/g at 5 A/g was achieved for SnS/Ni foam electrode from cyclic voltammogram (CV) and galvanostatic charging discharging (GCD) profiles. The higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of 419 mA/g with 286 mV overpotential was attained from linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) study with very low charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 12.9 Omega. Excellent and robust OER stability of 99% was achieved over 10 h of sustainable water oxidation. This result would give an appreciable impact on in situ growth of metal chalcogenides for electrochemical energy applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

To date, it is still a challenge to achieve a high efficiency based on direct Z-scheme photocatalysts for overall water splitting, because suitable band gaps and overpotentials for both half-reactions and spatially separated catalytic sites should be fulfilled simultaneously in a photocatalytic system. These challenges can be solved by taking advantage of the intrinsic dipole effect for polarized materials. Here, we propose a new strategy to achieve this goal by constructing van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures based on two-dimensional (2D) polarized materials. Using density functional theory calculations, we predict a promising photocatalyst In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure, with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) taking place separately on the SnP3 and In2Se3 layers. It is found that the intrinsic dipole of the In2Se3 monolayer effectively enhances the redox abilities for both the HER and OER. Moreover, the intrinsic dipole can promote the spatial separation of photogenerated carriers, and also contributes to a high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 19.26%, which is quite promising for commercial applications. This work opens up an avenue for the design of highly efficient Z-scheme photocatalysts for overall water splitting.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000662268600001

However, detailed structural evolution in the close proximity of the topotactic phase transition in multivalent oxides has not been much studied. In this work, we used strontium cobaltites (SrCoOx) epitaxially grown by pulsed laser epitaxy (PLE) as a model system to study the oxidation-driven evolution of the structure, electronic, and magnetic properties. We grew coherently strained SrCoO2.5 thin films and performed post-annealing at various temperatures for topotactic conversion into the perovskite phase (SrCoO3-delta). We clearly observed significant changes in electronic transport, magnetism, and microstructure near the critical temperature for the topotactic transformation from the brownmillerite to the perovskite phase. Nevertheless, the overall crystallinity was well maintained without much structural degradation, indicating that topotactic phase control can be a useful tool to control the physical properties repeatedly via redox reactions.

Ni-NKU-101 contains two types of cages based on trinuclear and octa-nuclear nickel-clusters that are connected with each other by the 4-connected ligands, to form a 3D framework with a new topology. A mixed-metal strategy was used to synthesize isostructural bimetallic MOFs of MxNi1-x-NKU-101 (M=Mn, Co, Cu, Zn). The electrocatalytic studies showed that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of CuxNi1-x-NKU-101 is much higher than that of other MxNi1-x-NKU-101 catalysts in acidic aqueous solution, owing to the synergistic effect of the bimetallic centers. The optimized Cu0.19Ni0.81-NKU-101 has an overpotential of 324 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 131 mV dec(-1). The mechanism of HER activity over these bimetallic MOF-based electrocatalysts are discussed in detail.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000777968900001	35289449

Herein, we report a novel approach for the synthesis of bifunctional electrocatalysts, where Fe0.5Co0.5 and Fe0.5Co0.4Ni0.1 alloys are encapsulated in the nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes-grafted porous polyhedron-derived hybrid fibers (FeCo/FeCoNi@NCNTs-HF). Benefiting from its hierarchically porous structure and strong synergetic coupling among FeCo, FeCoNi alloys, and N-doped carbon species. The obtained electrocatalyst exhibits a positive half-wave potential of 0.850 V for ORR and a low potential of 1.608 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, as well as superior stability in alkaline media. As a demonstration, FeCo/FeCoNi@NCNTs-HF is employed as the electrocatalysts in the air cathode of a Zn-air battery, which shows superior discharge and charge performance, large power density, high specific capacity, and outstanding cycling stability of 240 h (360 cycles). More impressively, excellent cyclabilitiy with a lifetime of 670 h (1005 cycles) is also achieved by the Zn-air battery with FeCo/FeCoNi@NCNTs-HF as the self-supported air electrode. This work will open a novel avenue to develop advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts for the next generation of metal-air batteries.									122	9	0	0	6	0	123			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000472697500004

However, current methods employed to evaluate oxygen-evolving catalysts are not standardized, making it difficult to compare the activity and stability of these materials. We report a protocol for evaluating the activity, stability, and Faradaic efficiency of electro-deposited oxygen-evolving electrocatalysts. In particular, we focus on methods for determining electrochemically active surface area and measuring electrocatalytic activity and stability under conditions relevant to an integrated solar water-splitting device. Our primary figure of merit is the overpotential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) per geometric area, approximately the current density expected for a 10% efficient solar-to-fuels conversion device. Utilizing the aforementioned surface area measurements, one can determine electrocatalyst turnover frequencies. The reported protocol was used to examine the oxygen-evolution activity of the following systems in acidic and alkaline solutions: CoOx, CoPi, CoFeOx, NiOx, NiCeOx, NiCoOx, NiCuOx, NiFeOx, and NiLaOx. The oxygen-evolving activity of an electrodeposited IrOx catalyst was also investigated for comparison. Two general observations are made from comparing the catalytic performance of the OER catalysts investigated: (1) in alkaline solution, every non-noble metal system achieved 10 mA cm(-2) current densities at similar operating overpotentials between 0.35 and 0.43 V, and (2) every system but IrOx was unstable under oxidative conditions in acidic solutions.									4038	120	0	0	226	0	4056			0002-7863			WOS:000327103600040	24171402

In this study, we synthesized Co:FeS2/CoS2 nano-heterostructure with superior hydrogen evolution performance by a typical one-step hydrothermal method. When the temperature of HER solution was raised from 0 degrees C to 60 degrees C, the over-potential for Co:FeS2/CoS2 nano-heterostructure at 10 cm(-2) was reduced from 115 to 75 mV and its Tafel slope did not change significantly. Moreover, the overpotential for Co:FeS2/CoS2 nano-heterostructure increased by only 6 mV after 1000 cycles of CV at 60 degrees C. This work provides a strategy for preparing and improving the performance of non-precious metal electrocatalysts to replace precious metal electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2158-5849	2158-5857		WOS:000502566300012

Herein, atomic Cu species loaded on hierarchical flower-like CoFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) superlattice (denoted as Cu-x/CoFe LDHs) were firstly fabricated by a facile co-precipitation method followed by a room temperature treatment to load the atomic Cu species from alkaline copper salt solution. The superlattice structure was proved by the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Remarkably, benefiting from high level long ordering associated with vacant cation sites and defects, the unique superlattice structural features and the atomic Cu % loading onto the LDHs matrix, the obtained Cu-x/CoFe LDHs electrocatalyst exhibited superior activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The loaded atomic Cu species improves the electronic structure and provides more exposed active sites due to synergetic electron coupling between Copper and the LDHs. These atomic species have outstanding potentials for achieving high selectivity and reactivity in electrocatalysis and heterocatalysis. Importantly, the efficient resulted Cu-4.76/CoFe LDHs electrode in which the atomic Cu % loading ratio is 4.76% showed the best electrocatalytic activity which only required the much lower overpotential of 253 mV to reach 10 mA/cm(2) and a small Tafel slope of 63mV/decade in 1 M KOH. This electrocatalyst possessed unique superior features tomany other state-of-the-art earth-abundant electrocatalysts. This work paves a facile and novel method for enhancing the catalytic activity of CoFe LDHs based electrocatalyst, which may be extended to the synthesis of future electrocatalysts having highly active OER performance.

Developing sustainable recycling strategies for the cathode of spent LIB can bring about promising environmental and economic benefits. In this work, we present an ultrafast high temperature shock process for regenerating typical LiCoO2 (LCO) spent cathodes into the carbon layer/Co3O4 composite (C/CO). The nanosized Co3O4 provides large active sties exposure, while the graphitized carbon layer can potentially enhance the electronic conductivity towards oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction (OER and ORR) catalysis. Benefiting from the enhanced active sties exposure, electronic conductivity, and the synergistic effect between the two domains, the C/CO composite shows efficient bifunctional (OER and ORR) electrocatalytic properties. The OER overpotential (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and ORR on-set potential reach 245 mV and 0.90 V, respectively. Moreover, the aqueous rechargeable Zn-air batteries using C/CO composite as air cathodes display high specific capacity (698 mAh g(-1)), power density (131 mW cm(-2)), and as well as cycling stability. This work provides a waste to treasure way that is eco-friendly, low-cost, and ultrafast for regenerating the spent LIB for further applications in energy storage systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000753965000013

The electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is one of the promising alternatives to OER, owing to its low thermodynamic potential. However, owing to the sluggish UOR kinetics, its potential in practical use has not been unlocked. Herein, we developed a tungsten-doped nickel catalyst (Ni-WOx) with superior activity towards UOR. The Ni-WOx catalyst exhibited record fast reaction kinetics (440 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode) and a high turnover frequency of 0.11 s(-1), which is 4.8 times higher than that without W dopants. In further experiments, we found that the W dopant regulated the local charge distribution of Ni atoms, leading to the formation of Ni3+ sites with superior activity and thus accelerating the interfacial catalytic reaction. Moreover, when we integrated Ni-WOx into a CO2 flow electrolyzer, the cell voltage is reduced to 2.16 V accompanying with approximate to 98 % Faradaic efficiency towards carbon monoxide.									71	1	0	0	6	0	71			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000634682000001	33629447

The OCP values in the active state show a different dependence on solution pH in acidic and alkaline pH. The results obtained from cathodic polarization experiments and the information suggested by the Pourbaix diagrams of cobalt and chromium together with mixed potential theory are used to interpret the electrochemical behavior of CoCrMo alloy in the active state. At acidic pH cobalt and chromium oxidize giving the bivalent aqueous ions Co(II) and Cr(II) as primary oxidation products, while the cathodic partial reaction is the hydrogen evolution reaction. At alkaline pH cobalt and chromium originate the oxide species CoO and CrO while the oxygen electronation reaction supplies the oxidation current. The repassivation rate is estimated by monitoring the OCP increase 30 s after the passive film is mechanically destroyed. The percentage increase in the OCP is referred to the steady-state open-circuit values 1 h after mechanical disruption of the oxide film. The repassivation rate decreases with increasing pH because the coprecipitation of unstable cobalt oxide species hinders the formation of the chromium oxide passive film.

In this study, we demonstrate that excellent HER activity is achieved with core-shell Co3O4@CoS2 nanoneedle arrays synthesized by an instantaneous thermal treatment of nanoneedle precursor in H2S atmosphere. The Co3O4@CoS2 structures thus obtained exhibit the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a remarkably small overpotential of 210 mV with a small Tafel slope of 45.8 mV decade(-1) in an acidic medium. The outstanding HER performance is achieved particularly from the unique core-shell nanostructure which offers enough electric conductivity and abundant active sites at the grain boundaries and stacking misalignments between two neighbouring cobalt nanostructures. This instantaneous thermal treatment strategy is compatible with the traditional long time sulfur vapor to prepare transition metal chalcogenides with significant hydrogen evolution reaction activities.

Strain SG2 was resistant to 1,000 jig of atrazine per nil but showed relatively low resistance to diuron [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea]. Analyses of 16S ribosomal DNA indicated that strain SG2 falls into the Synechocystis/Pleurocapsa/Microcystis group. Photosynthetically driven oxygen evolution in strain SG2 was only slightly inhibited (about 10%) by 2,000 mug of atrazine per ml, whereas in the control strain Synechocystis 6803, oxygen evolution was inhibited 90% by 1,000 mug of atrazine per ml. No atrazine accretion, mineralization, or metabolites were detected when strain SG2 was grown with [C-14] atrazine. Strain SG2 contained three copies of the psbA gene, which encodes the D-1 protein of the photosystem II reaction center. Nucleotide sequence analyses indicated that the psbA2 and psbA3 genes encoded predicted proteins with the same amino acid sequence. However, the psbA1 gene product contained five extra amino acids, which were not found in PsbA proteins from five other cyanobacteria. Moreover, the PsbA1 protein from strain SG2 had an additional 13 amino acid changes compared to the PsbA2/PsbA3 proteins and contained 10 amino acid alterations compared to conserved residues found in other cyanobacteria. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis indicated that the psbA1 gene and the psbA2/pshbA3 gene(s) were expressed in photosynthetically grown cells in the presence of atrazine. These results suggest that strong selection pressure conferred by the continual input of atrazine has contributed to the evolution of a herbicide-resistant, yet photosynthetically efficient, psbA gene in a cyanobacterium.									14	0	0	0	16	0	16			0099-2240			WOS:000174206200044	11872488

Sol-gel derived MgCr2O4 nanoparticles for aqueous supercapacitor and alkaline OER and HER bi-functional electrocatalyst applications								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				858						157679	10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.157679		JAN 2021		MAR 25 2021	2021	Metal oxides with spinel structure exhibit interesting electrochemical properties, arising from their unique crystal structure and presence of multiple redox centers. In this investigation, MgCr2O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by a chemical sol-gel reaction process to explore its improved aqueous supercapacitor and alkaline electrocatalyst applications. We obtain a polycrystalline sample with spherical morphology, with an average particle size of 12-20 nm. These nanoparticles of MgCr2O4 are suitable for electrochemical operations. The hollow and porous microstructure of these MgCr2O4 nanoparticles enabled efficient ionic diffusion and electrons' movement during electrochemical measurements. In the presence of aqueous 1 M Li2SO4 electrolyte system, we observed the value of capacitance of about 17 F/g (at 0.25 A/g), an energy density of about 11 Wh/kg, and a power density of about 275 W/kg. On the other hand, in presence of aqueous 1 M NaClO4 electrolyte systems, approximately C = 21 F/g (at 0.5 A/g), E = 14 Wh/kg and P = 550 W/kg, were found. Capacitance retention of more than 84% after undergoing 1000 charge-discharge cycles was observed in both cases, indicating long term cyclic stability performance of the system. These qualities make MgCr2O4 nanoparticles a suitable electrode material for future aqueous energy storage devices. MgCr2O4 also showed promising performance as alkaline water splitting electrocatalyst. As an Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) catalyst, it showed an overpotential of 1.174 V, and a Tafel slope of about 349 mV/dec was recorded. As a Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) electrocatalyst, an overpotential of 631 mV was observed, and a Tafel slope of about 169 mV/dec was recorded. Our analysis clearly showed that the chemically synthesized MgCr2O4 nanoparticles are very promising for aqueous supercapacitor and alkaline OER and HER bi-functional electrocatalyst applications.

Herein, a facile strategy is adopted to synthesize monodispersed Ir nanoparticles on g-C3N4/NG layers. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between different components of the catalyst, the optimal Ir/g-C3N4/NG catalyst with a low content of Ir (5.9 wt %) exhibits highly active for electrochemical water splitting in acidic electrolyte. Specifically, as a hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst, the optimal Ir/g-C3N4/NG exhibits a Tafel slope of 22 mV.dec(-1). The optimal catalyst requires an overpotential of 22 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), the value of which is superior to Ir/NG (32 mV) and 20 wt % Pt/C (28 mV) catalysts; as an oxygen evolution reaction catalyst, it also achieve the Tafel slope of only 72.8 mV.dec(-1). At the overpotential of 300 mV, the mass activity of the optimal Ir/g-C3N4/NG catalyst is 2.8 times as large as that of 5.7 wt % Ir/NG catalyst. More significantly, as a bifunctional catalyst, the optimal Ir/g-C3N4/NG achieves a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) with a potential of only 1.56 V and displays good stability for overall water splitting. This work provides a new strategy to design highly efficient acidic catalysts for electrochemical overall water splitting.									46	1	0	0	5	0	46			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000451100500057	30338972

These advanced glycation end-products accumulate in patients with diabetes mellitus and cause major complications, including arteriosclerosis and cardiac insufficiency. In the glycolytic pathway, the equilibration reactions between dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) have recently been shown to generate MG as a by-product. Because plants produce vast amounts of sugars and support the same reaction in the Calvin cycle, we hypothesized that MG also accumulates in chloroplasts. Incubating isolated chloroplasts with excess 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) as the GAP precursor drove the equilibration reaction toward MG production. The rate of oxygen (O-2) evolution was used as an index of 3-PGA-mediated photosynthesis. The 3-PGA- and time-dependent accumulation of MG in chloroplasts was confirmed by HPLC. In addition, MG production increased with an increase in light intensity. We also observed a positive linear relationship between the rates of MG production and O-2 evolution (R = 0.88; P< 0.0001). These data provide evidence that MG is produced by the Calvin cycle and that sugar-derived RC production is inevitable during photosynthesis. Furthermore, we found that MG production is enhanced under high-CO2 conditions in illuminated wheat leaves.									38	0	0	0	33	0	40			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000331400900010	24406631

A great deal of attention has been attracted toward LDHs due to their electrical power and they are potentially applied in the field of electrocatalysts. The present paper reports synthesis of the Ni-Fe-Molybdate and Ni-Fe-Vanadate layered double hydroxides (LDHs) using a simple co-precipitation method. Powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectra, Transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy spectrum provide successful intercalation of the Vanadate and Molybdate anions. Compared to the bare glassy carbon electrode, in alkaline media, the as-obtained Ni-Fe-MoO4-LDH represents superior electrocatalytic activity toward water oxidation with the overpotential of 491 mV at10 mA/cm(2 )and a low Tafel slope of 23 mV/ dec. Ni-Fe-MoO4-LDH exhibits good OER activity, which is stated as low onset overpotential, small Tafel slope, and large exchange current density. The current density of the Ni-Fe-MoO4-LDH nanosheets is about 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 0.491 (V vs SCE). This value is much larger than that of the Ni-Fe-NO3-LDH and Ni-Fe-VO3-LDH nanoparticles. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The activities of 1 and 2 towards H2O oxidation were assessed by monitoring the in situ O-2 concentration versus time in the reaction medium by utilizing a Clark-type oxygen electrode under photochemical conditions. The oxygen evolution rate (R-O2) was 24.3 mu mols(-1) g(-1) for 1 and 48.8 mu mol s(-1) g(-1) for 2 at pH 8.0. Photocatalytic reaction studies show that 1 and 2 exhibit enhanced activities toward the oxidation of water compared to commercial nanosized Co3O4. In scaled-up photoreactions, the pH value of the reaction medium decreased from 8.0 to around 7.0 after 20 min and the O-2 production ceased. Based on the amounts of the sacrificial oxidant (K2S2O delta) used, the yield of O-2 produced is 49.6% for 2 and 29.8% for 1. However, the catalyst can be recycled without a significant loss of catalytic activity. Spectroscopic studies suggest that the structure and composition of recycled 1 and 2 are maintained. In isotope-labeling (H2O)-O-18 (97% enriched) experiments, the distribution of (OO)-O-16-O-16/(OO)-O-16-O-18/(OO)-O-18-O-18 detected was 0:7.55:92.45, which is comparable to the theoretical values of 0.09:5.82:94.09. This work not only provides new catalysts that resemble ligand-protected cobalt oxide materials but also establishes the significance of the existence of OH (or H2O) binding sites at the metal center in WOCs.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000378635500013	27098180

In this paper, an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, carbon nanotubes with N doping and sublayer Co4N encapsulating (N-CNTs@Co4N) supported on Ni foam (NF), was designed and prepared through a complementary electronic structure principle. The as-prepared N-CNTs@Co4N@NF catalyst shows outstanding hydrogen evolution activity in 1.0 M KOH solution. DFT calculation indicated that carbon nanotubes wall of N-CNTs@Co4N@NF catalyst provided more competitive catalytic active sites for hydrogen evolution reaction than N doped CNTs and Co4N singly. The greatly improved catalytic ability was owing to the redistribution of electron density for N-CNTs after Co4N embeds in, leading to a moderate absorption energy of H. This study demonstrated the successful rational design and experimental verification on developing a novel non-noble metal catalyst.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000524298500001

Here, a murdochite-type Ni6MnO8 electrocatalyst for water oxidation is reported. Murdochite-type Ni6MnO8 with hollow sphere (NMO-HS) and microflower (NMO-MF) structures has been controllably synthesized. After an in-situ activation process, the NMO-MF affords a superior activity for oxygen evolution reaction in 0.1 M KOH. A low overpotential of 370 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) is obtained, and the mass activity of activated NMO-MF is 1.96 times that of commercial IrO2/C. As revealed by in-situ Raman spectra, Ni species in activated NMO-MF act as intrinsic active sites, and the in-situ formed NiOOH on the surface during the activation process is identified to contribute to the significantly enhanced catalytic activity. The Zn-air battery assembled with a NMO-MF cathode showed an exceptional power density (0.228 W cm(-2)) and long-term cycling stability (148 h).									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000569268800037	32805897	
J	Yao, Yi-Fan; Wang, Gui-Chang								Mechanism Insights into the Aerobic Oxidation of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-Furandicarboxylic Acid over MnO2 Catalysts								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				125	7			3818	3826		10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c09545		FEB 2021		FEB 25 2021	2021	5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and its derivatives, especially 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), as important renewable energy sources which can be an excellent substitute for terephthalic acid in the field of polymers such as polyamides and polyesters, have received a lot of attention recently. Notably, a simple nonprecious-metal catalyst system based on MnO2 to convert HMF into FDCA by aerobic oxidation with O-2 as a sole oxidant (2C(6)H(6)O(3) + 3O(2) -> 2C(6)H(4)O(5) + 2H(2)O) has been reported and receiving much attention very recently. However, the mechanism of HMF oxidation catalyzed by MnO2 is uncertain. Herein, we proposed the reaction mechanism, through two oxidative dehydrogenations via lattice oxygen (O-bri) to generate -CHO and HObri groups first; then, the H involved in the -CHO group was further oxidized by O-bri to form -CO and -HObri, followed by the -HObri group inserting into the -CO group to form a carboxyl group (-COOH); the excess -HObri then releases the H by an O-2-assisted mechanism, and at last, the consumed lattice oxygen was recovered by O-2. Furthermore, we explored the structure-activity relationship of MnO2, finding that the active sites on the beta-MnO2 surface are all frustrated Lewis pairs, which promote the activation of C-H and O-H and facilitate the progress of the catalytic reaction. Besides, the reaction activity of the lattice oxygen on the catalyst surface is critical to the catalytic performance: the better the lattice oxygen activity, the better the catalytic performance; oxygen vacancy (O-vac) formation energy can be a good descriptor for reaction activity. At last, the microkinetic modeling results show that the catalytic activity is optimal when the adsorption energy of FFCA is between -0.7 and -0.4 eV and the O-vac formation energy is between 0.1 and 0.5 eV. Hopefully, this may act as a favorable guidance for the filtrate of catalysts in the experiment.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000624451700018

The formation mechanism can be explained by the nanoscale Kirkendall-effect-induced hollowing process of the galvanic replacement reaction. The electrochemical tests suggest that the amorphous CuPt alloy exhibits better MOR activity and stability than the crystalline CuPt and commercial Pt/C catalysts, which can be ascribed to the enhanced CO tolerance ability of amorphous alloy. XPS measurements demonstrate that the enhanced anti-CO poison characteristic of amorphous CuPt alloy originates from the strong interaction between Pt and Cu atoms as a result of a unique crystallization state. This research not only provides a facile approach to synthesize amorphous alloy but also opens up an interesting way for amorphous Pt-based alloy to apply to the MOR.									97	5	0	0	2	0	99			2155-5435			WOS:000379457300009

In this work, an integrated electrolysis system of replacing the anodic OER with a thermodynamically favorable ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) has been developed by using PdSbBi/C as an electrocatalyst. To maximize the EOR performance, the composition of PdSbBi nanoparticles is tuned by varying the ratio of Sb and Bi precursors. Ternary PdSbBi-based electrocatalysts exhibit enhanced activity and stability toward EOR compared to commercial PVC and binary catalysts. In particular, the Pd76Sb17Bi7/C catalyst delivers a very high specific activity up to 52.4 mA cm(-2) and mass activity of 2.66 A mg(pd)(-1). Besides, this EOR process is demonstrated to have high selectivity with acetic acid as the oxidation product in the electrolyte. When coupled with a cathodic platinum mash, the two-electrode electrolyzer cell requires a voltage input of merely 0.61 V to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the presence of Sb and Bi can promote the adsorption of hydroxide ions and facilitate the removal of reaction intermediates in the EOR pathway. This work provides a novel catalyst for the energy-efficient coproduction of acetic acid and hydrogen fuel.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000861487200001	36150124

In general such reactions are slower than diffusion-controlled because of the radical spins. The rate constant is corrected by a multiplicative spin statistical factor, which represents the probability that the radicals encounter one another in a reactive state. However, this method does not account for the possibility that the reactivity of a pair may recover following an unreactive encounter, for example by spin relaxation or by a coherent evolution of the spin function. In this paper we show how the spin statistical factor can be corrected for the recovery of reactivity. The new theory covers a large range of mechanisms for the recovery of reactivity, and gives simple analytical results.

These devices are mainly limited by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Ir-based nanoparticles are both reasonably active and stable for the OER in acidic media. The electrolyte composition and the pH may play a crucial role in electrocatalysis, yet they have been widely overlooked for the OER. Herein, we present a study on the effects of the composition and concentration of the electrolyte on commercial Ir black nanoparticles using concentrations of 0.05M, 0.1M and 0.5M of both sulphuric and perchloric acid. The results show an important effect of the electrolyte composition on the catalytic performance of the Ir nanoparticles. The concentration of H2SO4 interferes on the oxidation of Ir and decreases the catalytic performance of the catalyst. HClO4 does not show strong interferences in the electrochemistry of Ir. Higher catalytic performances are observed in HClO4 electrolytes in comparison to H2SO4 with little effect of the concentration of HClO4.									28	0	0	0	5	0	28			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000495784300001	31626374

CoFe2O4 is also prepared using flavorless gelatin for the sake of comparison. The as-prepared powders are calcined at 1073 K and characterized by XRD, FESEM, MOssbauer spectroscopy (MS), and DC magnetometry. Electrodes made of CoFe2O4 powders were also investigated as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a reaction of high importance to produce pure H-2 through water splitting. The material obtained with agar-agar showed a particle size of 176 nm and effective magnetocrystalline anisotropy of 5.8 x 10(7) erg/cm(3) (against 74 nm and 5.7 x 10(7) erg/cm(3) for the gelatin-based sample). Magnetic assessment at 5 K showed a ferrimagnetic behavior for both samples. As an OER electrocatalyst, CoFe2O4 obtained with agar-agar attains an overpotential of 360 mV vs. RHE to generate 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 69.2 mV dec(-1) and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 8.8 x 10(-2)s(-1) (against 435 mV vs. RHE, 126.3 mV dec(-1) and 1.9 x 10(-3) s(-1) for the gelatin-based sample). The electrocatalytic performance towards OER can be explained by differences in mass and charge carrier transport processes influenced by microstructural features. The performance assessment of the cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) powders herein synthesized by sol-gel green methods shows their potential for using in energy conversion applications.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000489066200025

Iron-containing nitrogen-doped graphene (Fe/N-G) that contains Fe-N-x coordination sites is prepared by pyrolyzing the complex of iron ion and PANI sheets intercalated with the unique layer gaps of H-montmorillonite nanoreactors. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirm that there are no crystalline materials, such as iron lattice, iron carbide, or iron nitride. The as-prepared Fe/N-G show a high electrocatalytic activity in ORR with a 4e(-) transfer process and the half-wave potential of Fe/N-G (0.877 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode-RHE), which is better than that of Pt/C in oxygen saturated 0.1 m KOH solution. In an acid electrolyte, the Fe/N-G possesses a half-wave potential similar to that of 20 wt% Pt/C. For OER, the Fe/N-G exhibits the overpotential of 400 mV versus RHE at 10 mA cm(-2). However, the Fe/N-G as the air-cathode of the homemade rechargeable ZABs exhibits a high power density (156.8 mW cm(-2)) and an excellent long discharge-charge cycling stability (787 cycles) at 20 mA cm(-2). This work provides an inspiring guideline to prepare a high-performance bifunctional air-cathode for a rechargeable ZAB.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000474269800012

Here we report the synthesis of CoP nanoparticles encapsulated in ultrathin nitrogen-doped porous carbon (CoP@NC) through a metal organic framework (MOE) route. This hybrid exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward the HER in both acidic and alkaline media, with good stability. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the carbon atoms adjacent to N dopants on the shells of CoP@NC are active sites for hydrogen evolution and that CoP and N dopants synergistically optimize the binding free energy of H* on the active sites, which results in a higher electrocatalytic activity in comparison to its counterparts without nitrogen doping and/or CoP encapsulation.									332	20	0	0	15	0	332			2155-5435			WOS:000402851600011

However, it is still a serious challenge to rationally construct a single-atom catalyst with satisfactory electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability. Here, we simultaneously realize the atomic-level dispersion of cobalt and the construction of carbon nanotube (CNT)-linked N-doped porous carbon nanofibers (NCFs) via an electrospinning strategy. In this hierarchical structure, the Co-N-4 sites provide efficient oxygen reduction/evolution electrocatalytic activity, the porous architectures of NCFs guarantee the active site's accessibility, and the interior CNTs enhance the flexibility and mechanical strength of porous fibers. As a binder-free air cathode, the as-prepared catalysts deliver superdurability of 600 h at 10 mA cm(-2) for aqueous ZABs and considerable flexibility and a small voltage gap for all-solid-state ZABs. This work provides an effective single-atom design/nanoengineering for superdurable zinc-air batteries.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000795036100043	35266721

Past decades have witnessed the rapid development of carbon fibers and their applications in electrocatalytic reactions. To explore the advance of this interesting field, we herein organize a systematic review by focusing on the syntheses, modifications, and properties of fiber materials and their applications in electrocatalytic reactions. This review is started by providing a discussion about the synthesis strategy of carbon fibers and fiber-based materials. Subsequently, a deep discussion about the crucial role of carbon fibers played in driving electrocatalytic reactions is also added, hoping to provide a better understanding on the role of carbon fibers in the application of electrocatalytic reactions. Finally, the challenges and prospects of fiber materials in electrocatalysis applications are proposed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000839567500001

Moreover, combining the biomass oxidation with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) increased the energy conversion efficiency of an electrolyzer and also generated value-added products at both electrodes. Here, the reaction pathway on the surface of a carbon-coupled nickel nitride nanosheet (Ni3N@C) electrode was evaluated by surface-selective vibrational spectroscopy using sum frequency generation (SFG) during the electrochemical oxidation. The Ni3N@C electrode shows catalytic activities for HMF oxidation and the HER. As the first in situ SFG study on transition-metal nitride for the electrooxidation upgrade of HMF, this work not only demonstrates that the reaction pathway of electrochemical oxidation but also provides an opportunity for nonprecious metal nitrides to simultaneously upgrade biomass and produce H-2 under ambient conditions.									173	10	1	0	9	0	173			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000486810500001	31452306

This may allow for more intimate contact between the nitride substrate and metal-modifier to promote synergistic effects. In this work, tungsten nitride (WN) and niobium nitride (NbN) thin films were synthesized and evaluated for their stability across a wide range of potential-pH values. Low loadings of Pt were deposited on the nitride thin films and were evaluated for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in acid and alkaline electrolytes. The observed activity trends correlate well with the hydrogen binding energies obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Pseudo-Pourbaix diagrams were generated for WN and NbN to aid in catalyst selection for other electrocatalytic reactions. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To accelerate the sluggish OER kinetics by a self-adaptive surface reconfiguration approach, herein, we have purposely designed a strongly coupled core@shell nanostructured precatalyst consisting of an in-grown Ni3N/Ni heterostructured core and an ultrathin Ni3N shell (Ni3N/Ni@Ni3N) via a step-by-step thermal nitridation route. The Ni3N/Ni@Ni3N thus-obtained delivers an ultralow overpotential (eta) of 229 mV at 10 cm(geo)(-2) , with the remarkable 17-, 37and 20-fold enhancements in catalytic current density per active surface area at eta = 270 mV, compared favorably to the invidivual Ni3N and Ni alone as well as the commercial RuO2, respectively, together with a much reduced Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1). In reponse to the change in applied potential to the Ni3N/ Ni@Ni3N precatalyst during the OER process, a self-adaptive surface reconfiguration into NiOOH species takes place, which is responsible for the high catalytic activity observed. It is also evidenced by both the in-situ Raman spectrometry and ex-situ electron microscopy studies. To further support the experimental observation, density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the interfacial electron transfer from NiOOH to Ni3N produces positive-charged Ni cations as the highly active sites to substantially lower the energy barriers for adsoprtion/desportion of the OER intermediates.									72	6	0	0	3	0	73			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000595912700002

Herein, for the first time we show that the anion exchange properties of sebacate anion intercalated NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH Seb) can be taken advantage of to make NiFe LDHs a highly efficient OER catalyst for the pH-near-neutral potassium borate electrolyte (K-B-i, pH = 9.2). The NiFe LDH Seb nanosphere delivered a 1 mA cm(-2) current density with an overpotential of 376 mV on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode in 0.1 M K-B-i (pH = 9.2) which is lower than that of RuO2 (393 mV) and all other reported earth-abundant OER catalysts on FTO electrodes. More importantly, a chronoamperometry test showed that for 24 hours, NiFe LDH Seb did not show any decay in its performance as an OER catalyst and always outperformed RuO2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that anyone has reported a better performance of an earth-abundant OER catalyst than that of precious RuO2 in K-B-i (pH = 9.2). Besides, it also showed good OER performance under alkaline conditions. The excellent OER performance of NiFe LDH Seb was attributed to its large electrochemically active surface area and the in situ anion exchange induced large-scale exposure of Ni in the interior layers to the borate anions, which facilitates the activation of more Ni sites in the LDH. This work opens up a new path to develop LDH type OER catalysts for pH-neutral or pH-near-neutral electrolytes.									30	2	0	0	1	0	31			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463814800039

Each polymorph contains a H2O molecule, but differs dramatically in its bonding to the framework, which in turn affects the crystal structure and electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Both experimental and computational studies find that 2D CTGU-5 which has coordinates water and more open access to the cobalt site has higher electrocatalytic activity than CTGU-6 with the lattice water. The integration with co-catalysts, such as acetylene black (AB) leads to a composite material, AB&CTGU-5 (1:4) with very efficient HER catalytic properties among reported MOFs. It exhibits superior HER properties including a very positive onset potential of 18mV, low Tafel slope of 45mVdec(-1), higher exchange current density of 8.6x10(-4)Acm(-2), and long-term stability.									283	11	0	0	8	0	284			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000412189700036	28763581

The strong coordination between Pt atoms in cisplatin and N atoms in pyrrole contributes to the robust embedding of Pt NP into the N-doped carbon nanosheets after annealing. Such a unique partially-embedding structure facilitates the active site exposure while stabilizing the ultrasmall Pt NPs, leading to the comparable electrochemical activities for hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions, and substantially improves durability performance compared to that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C (20 wt%).									10	6	0	0	0	0	10			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000450218200006

The mesoporous nature of the prepared nanocomposites was observed from electron microscopy and surface area measurements. The electrochemical measurements show the bifunctional nature of mesoporous alpha-Fe2O3@g-C3N4-NCs in electrolysis of water for oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions (OER/ORR) using 0.5 M KOH. Higher current density of mesoporous alpha-Fe2O3@g-C3N4-NCs reveals the enhanced electrochemical performance compared to pure Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs). The onset potential, over-potential and Tafel slopes of mesoporous alpha-Fe2O3@g-C3N4-NCs were found lower than that of pure alpha-Fe2O3-NPs. Rotating disc electrode experiments followed by the K-L equation were used to investigate 4e(-) redox system. Therefore, the mesoporous alpha-Fe2O3@g-C3N4-NCs bifunctional electro-catalysts can be considered as potential future low-cost alternatives for Pt/C catalysts, which are currently used in fuel cells.									35	1	0	0	4	0	35			2045-2322			WOS:000488481500002	31578464

Recently, a new type of two-dimensional material MoSi2N4 was successfully synthesized and received considerable attention because of novel properties and potential applications. Herein, by means of first principles calculation, the OER/ORR activities of 3d transition metal (TM) atoms embedded MoSi2N4 (TM@MSN) were investigated. The calculated results indicate that TM atoms on MoSi2N4 exhibit good electrochemical stability. On TM sites, Ti@MSN shows the highest OER activity with an overpotential of 0.48 V, whereas Cr@MSN is the most active ORR catalyst with an overpotential of 0.48 V. The Si site (Si-N1-Cu) of Cu@MSN follows the dual-site mechanism, exhibiting the same OER/ORR overpotential as that of N site (0.55/0.65 V). Interestingly, the outer N site (Zn-N1) of Zn@MSN achieves the lowest OER overpotential of 0.38 V, better than that of the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst. We demonstrate that 3d TM atoms not only serve as active sites themselves but also activate the host atoms to improve OER/ORR performance of MoSi2N4. Our work opens new windows of opportunity for developing novel catalysts beyond the precious metal-based electrocatalysts for efficient energy conversion and storage.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000736681800003

The amorphous catalysts were synthesized by a remarkably facile and quick electroless deposition process newly developed in this study (process time <5 min). An electrode substrate (glassy carbon, carbon cloth) was sequentially dipped for 10 s into two separate solutions of a reducing agent (sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2)) and Pd ions to deposit amorphous Pd nanoparticles containing phosphorus (Pd-P). By repeating the deposition cycles, the specific and mass activities of the Pd nanoparticles can be actively tuned. Owing to the nanoscale amorphous nature, the obtained Pd-P nanoparticle electrocatalysts exhibited superior specific and mass activities compared with crystalline Pd nanoparticles synthesized by another reducing agent (N2H4) and commercial Pt-loaded carbon (Pt/C) and Pd-loaded carbon (Pd/C). The specific and mass activities of the amorphous Pd-P nanoparticles were over 4.5 times and 2.6 times higher than previously reported values of Pd and Pt catalysts.									104	7	0	0	5	0	106			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000334572200010	24661048

In this work, a high-performance and long-lasting electrocatalyst of CoWO4/WS2@C-N nanocomposite with the unique hierarchical flowerlike superstructure is achieved by sulfuration of porous polyoxometalate@ZIF-67 precursor, in which the polyoxometalate acts as both template and acidic etching agent. The introduction of polyoxometalate also plays a key role in forming the binary CoWO4/WS2 active center during the sulfuration process. CoWO4/WS2@C-N electrocatalyst shows higher electrocatalytic activity than commercial noble-metal catalysts under the same conditions. DFT calculations indicate that both the high adsorption energy for the OH- group and low adsorption energy for O-2 on the surface of CoWO4/WS2 sites result in high OER and ORR activity. When CoWO4/WS2@C-N is assembled in a lab-made Zn-air battery as cathode material, the battery shows a higher discharge plateau voltage of 1.46 V and a specific capacity of 664 mA h g(Zn)(-1), the behavior of which is comparable to the reported non-noble-metal materials. The synthetic strategy presented in this work not only opens a polyoxometalate-etching-ZIF way to constructing a nanosized heterojunction catalyst but also provides a cost-effective and robust electrocatalyst potentially used in practical Zn-air batteries.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2574-0962			WOS:000678382900054

J	Harmon, PA; Biffar, S; Pitzenberger, SM; Reed, RA								Mechanism of the solution oxidation of rofecoxib under alkaline conditions								PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH				22	10			1716	1726		10.1007/s11095-005-6947-z				OCT 2005	2005	Purpose. The rapid oxidation of rofecoxib under alkaline conditions has been previously reported. The oxidation was reported to involve gamma-lactone ring opening to an alcohol, which further oxidized to a dicarboxyclic acid. The oxidation was suspected to be mediated by peroxy radicals. This work further investigates the mechanism of oxidation under the alkaline solution conditions.Methods. The pH dependence of the oxidation reaction was determined in 50% acetonitrile/50% aqueous phosphate buffer (pH 9-12). The oxidation reaction products were also examined at early timepoints (from 40 s to several minutes) with only 5% water content. The evolution of hydrogen peroxide by the oxidation reaction was quantitatively followed by reaction with triphenylphosphine (TPP) and high-pressure liquid chromatography determination of the resultant triphenylphosphine oxideformed. Rofecoxib was exposed to the alkaline pH conditions in the presence of formaldehyde, and the primary reaction product was isolated and characterized by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and proton 1D, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), gradient heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (gHMBC), and carbon 1D nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Transient reaction products were examined for hydroperoxide groups by reaction with TPP.Results. The oxidation reaction occurs only near pH 11 and above. In the presence of excess formaldehyde, oxidation products are no longer observed but a new product is observed in which two formaldehyde molecules have added to the methylene carbon atom of the gamma-lactone ring. The evolution of hydrogen peroxide corresponds quantitatively to the molar amount of the (minor) aldehyde oxidation product formed. It is demonstrated that the rofecoxib anhydride species is actually the primary product of the oxidation reaction. The existence of a transient hydroperoxide species is shown by reaction with TPP and concomitant conversion to a previously identified alcohol.Conclusions. The oxidation of rofecoxib under these high pH conditions is mediated by rofecoxib enolate ion formation. The enolate ion reacts with either formaldehyde or dissolved oxygen at the C-5 position. In the case of oxygen, a transient hydroperoxide species is formed. The major and minor products of the oxidation derive from competitive routes of decomposition of this hydroperoxide. The major route involves a second enolate ion formation, which decomposes with heterolytic cleavage of the RO-OH bond to give the rofeocoxib anhydride and hydroxide ion. The anhydride is rapidly hydrolyzed under the alkaline conditions to give the observed rofecoxib dicarboxylate product. The minor hydroxy-furanone product is formed from hydroxide ion attack on the hydroperoxide intermediate.									10	0	0	0	8	0	10			0724-8741			WOS:000232057100017	16180130

Herein, hollow spherical Fe-M/G/H catalyst was synthesized through a polycondensation/pyrolysis method without template. Polycondensation of melamine, d-glucose, and hexamethylenetetramine was accomplished to obtain carbon spheres with high nitrogen content. Hollow microspheres containing Fe-N-x and Fe3C were fabricated by subsequent pyrolysis with Fe catalysts. Hollow microsphere structures not only expose more active sites (doped-N, Fe-N-x, and Fe3C), but also promote the mass transfer of O-2. Fe-M/G/H possesses superior ORR performance in alkaline media with high limiting current density (5.09 mA cm(-2)) and half-wave potential (0.80 V). The OER activity of Fe-M/G/H is superior to commercial Pt/C. Fe-M/G/H assembled zinc-air battery exhibits high peak power density (90.27 mW cm(-2)) and long stability. This research provides a new approach to design hollow carbon catalysts with homo-dispersed Fe-N-x/Fe3C active sites and high doped-N concentration.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-6549			WOS:000824678600012

Through electrochemical analysis, the obtained metal-free catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance in oxygen (O-2) saturated 0.1M KOH solution with an onset potential of 0.92V (vs. reverible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and half-wave potential of 0.81V. In addition, the long-time durability and methanol resistance of obtained catalyst are much better than that of commercial Pt-C catalysts, desirable for practical applications in fuel cells. Carbonization temperature has a significant effect on the forms of nitrogen (N) species in carbon materials, which is highly related to the electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). It is experimentally deduced that graphitic-N holds the key to electrocatalytic activity, and the graphitic N-dominated carbon catalyst is a promising alternative for commercial Pt-C catalysts, deserving further investigation.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000447736300029

Here we show that this reaction occurs readily when CO2 ions scatter from solid surfaces in a two-step sequential collision process at hyperthermal incidence energies. The produced O-2 is preferentially ionized by charge transfer from the surface over the predominant atomic oxygen product, leading to direct detection of both O-2+ and O-2- . First-principles simulations of the collisional dynamics reveal that O-2 production proceeds via strongly-bent CO2 configurations, without visiting other intermediates. Bent CO2 provides dynamic access to the symmetric dissociation of CO2 to C+O-2 with a calculated yield of 1 to 2% depending on molecular orientation. This unexpected collision-induced transformation of individual CO2 molecules provides an accessible pathway for generating O-2 in astrophysical environments and may inspire plasmadriven electro- and photo-catalytic strategies for terrestrial CO2 reduction.									14	2	0	0	3	1	15			2041-1723			WOS:000468857900001	31127109

Here we report an approach to reuse one kind of HPP as carbon and sulfur sources in synthesizing nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped honeycomb-like porous carbon catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction. Briefly, poly(phenylene sulfide sulfone) with S atoms in polymer chain as sulfur source, dicyandiamide as nitrogen source and SiO2 nanoparticles as hard-template are pyrolyzed in designed temperatures under argon atmosphere. Then N, S dual-doped carbon catalysts (N, S@C) are obtained after subjected etching treatment. By adjusting moderate amount of SiO2, the optimized catalyst (denoted as N, S@C-M-1000) pyrolyzed at 1000 degrees C, shows best ORR electrocatalytic activity in alkaline environment. Impressively, when N, S@C-M-1000 is used as a cathode catalyst, the corresponding assembled zinc-air batteries exhibit a maximum power density of 90 mW cm(-2) with long-term durability and high rate capacity. Therefore, this work provides a feasible way to resolve and reuse the unrenewable HPP for synthesizing heteroatom doped carbon-based catalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Extrinsic chemical defects in the support can affect the performances and this topic is much investigated in recent electrocatalyst research. In this work, nitrogen functional groups are introduced into the outermost layers of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) by ion implantation with a beam energy of 100 eV. Palladium nanoparticies (Pd NPs) are then electrochemically deposited onto both pure and nitrogen doped HOPG (N-HOPG). Pd2+ species located at the interface between the NPs and the nitrogen-rich surface were observed in the latter case. The supported Pd NPs on N-HOPG show the same electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as compared with those supported on pure HOPG. However, the stability of Pd NPs on N-HOPG towards potential cycling decreases strongly due to the existence of Pd2+ at the interface, which can accelerate the dissolution of Pd atoms. This result is contradictory to results on supported Pt NPs from the literature where the merit of the N-doping was outlined. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, the oxygen reduction reaction performance of a group of MXene-like carbide two-dimensional materials, including CrC2, MnC2, FeC2, TcC2, HfC2, and WC2, was investigated through first-principles calculations. In these systems, transition metals are sandwiched between C2 dimers at the top and those at the bottom of a MC2 structure. Among the investigated systems, WC2 exhibits the low overpotential of 0.42 V compared with the other systems. The overpotential values of CrC2, MnC2, FeC2, TcC2, and HfC2 are 1.04, 1.16, 1.56, 1.39, and 1.69 V, respectively. In addition, two different catalytic mechanisms based on single and double active sites were compared to each other for TcC2 and WC2, revealing that the mechanism based on dual-active-sites is more favorable than the mechanism based on a single-active-site for these two systems. Our study suggests that a WC2 monolayer can be a potential electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000860710100001

Measurements have been run in a flow reactor, allowing the amount of oxygen evolved to be evaluated and, in particular, the initial rate of WO reaction to be measured. The latter has been studied as a function of chemical composition, and some kinetic features have been established. Competitive reactions occur extensively, causing the oxidation of the Ru complex to the detriment of oxygen production. The initial rate of WO increases with the amount of catalyst until turbidity of the suspension sets in. A reaction order close to -1 with respect to persulfate was found, which indicates the occurrence of surface processes involving Co centers at the outer layer of Co-APO-5 particles (accessed by the bulky [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) species, at variance with Co species in the core), for the adsorption onto which competition takes place between the Ru complex and persulfate species. A less pronounced negative order (ca. -0.4) for the sensitizer was also observed, for which an interpretation is proposed.									18	0	0	0	4	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000320298800021

The Mn4Ca cluster of photosystem II cycles through five redox states termed S-0-S-4, after which oxygen is evolved. Critically, the timing of O-O bond formation within the Kok cycle remains unknown. By combining recent crystallographic, spectroscopic, and DFT results, we demonstrate an atomistic S-3 state model with the possibility of a low barrier to O-O bond formation prior to the final oxidation step. Furthermore, the associated one electron oxidized S-4 state does not provide more advantages in terms of spin alignment or the energy of O-O bond formation. We propose that a high energy peroxide isoform of the S-3 state can preferentially be oxidized by Tyr(z)(ox) in the course of final electron transfer leading to O-2 evolution. Such a mechanism may explain the peculiar kinetic behavior of O-2 evolution as well as serve as an evolutionary adaptation to avoid release of the harmful peroxides.									40	0	0	0	8	0	40			1948-7185			WOS:000436382400055	29863871

A suitable oxide support can alleviate the problem of carbon corrosion and platinum dissolution in Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, it can increase the activity of platinum if the interaction between the support and the metal is optimal. We found that both the activity and the stability depend on the number of platinum layers and, as expected, both converge toward platinum bulk values if the number of layers is increased. With use of a simple volcano curve for activity estimation, we found that the supported platinum layers could be active for the oxygen reduction reaction, with a few candidates possibly having an activity even greater than that of platinum. Furthermore, we established a correlation between stability and activity for supported platinum monolayers, which suggests that activity can be increased at the expense of stability and vice versa. Finally, the performance of the systems was evaluated against Pt(111) skins on Pt3X (X=Ni, Co, Fe, Ti, Sc and Y) alloys, which are the best catalysts known to date for the reaction.									43	2	0	0	2	0	44			1867-3880			WOS:000299616800013

However, predictions of the exact nature of the amorphous phase and its effect on material properties are still elusive. Thorough structure-property investigations of well-known model systems are thus necessary before predictive control of useful material properties is obtained. In this work, we fabricate a series of photodeposited nickel (oxy)hydroxide (NiOx) thin films and anneal them at temperatures of up to 1000 degrees C. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are used to determine the local structure, allowing us to correlate it to measured electrochemical properties. We find an amorphous Ni(OH)(2)-like local structure for annealing conducted below 250 degrees C, followed by an amorphous-to-amorphous phase transition to a NiO-like structure by 300 degrees C, thus supplying evidence for different amorphous polymorphs in this Ni-O system. Above 400 degrees C, a cubic NiO XRD diffraction pattern is detected. Electrochemical characterization was performed in an Fe-free environment to avoid catalyst contamination and we find a stepwise increase of the onset overpotential at this transition, indicating a change in the potential-determining step and possibly oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism. The Tafel slope decreases linearly with annealing temperature, which we attribute to a change in (Ni)OOH affinity, supported by in operando UV-vis electrochromism. Furthermore, we find that the (Ni)OOH coordination is increasingly strained with annealing temperature, which manifests in higher electrochromic coloring rates and lower binding energies. We identify this as the root cause of the lowered intermediary coverage. Thus, nanocrystalline NiO should kinetically be a superior catalyst to amorphous Ni(OH)(2). However, at our benchmarking value of 10 mA cm(-2), the amorphous material exhibits lower overpotential, due to a combination of lower onset potential, a large chemically active surface area, and mass transport effects under our conditions.Y									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000618839200096

The product of water oxidation is molecular oxygen. The water splitting complex is located on the lumenal side of the PSII reaction center and contains manganese, calcium, and chloride. Four sequential photooxidation reactions are required to generate oxygen from water; the five sequentially oxidized forms of the water splitting complex are known as the S-n states, where n refers to the number of oxidizing equivalents stored. Calcium plays a role in water oxidation; removal of calcium is associated with an inhibition of the S state cycle. Although calcium can be replaced by other cations in vitro, only strontium maintains activity, and the steady-state rate of oxygen evolution is decreased in strontium-reconstituted PSII. In this article, we study the role of calcium in PSII that is limited in water content. We report that strontium substitution or (OH2)-O-18 exchange causes conformational changes in the calcium ligation shell. The conformational change is detected because of a perturbation to calcium ligation during the S-1 to S-2 and S-2 to S-3 transition under water-limited conditions.									16	1	0	0	14	0	16			0006-3495	1542-0086		WOS:000230114500042	15985425

It remains a big challenge to fabricate non-precious OER electrocatalysts with both excellent activity and high stability. Herein, we demonstrate that excellent OER performance can be achieved by applying structural and electronic engineering simultaneously. As a proof of concept, 1D vertically aligned Ni3S2 nanorods (without any entangled or inter-crossed nanostructure on the top) are firstly synthesized to provide both conducting highways and rich active sites with significantly facilitated gas release during the OER. A highly active Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanofilm is then prepared on the Ni3S2 nanorod to form a core@shell structure. The strong interfacial coupling between the in situ grown Ni-Fe LDH and Ni3S2 creates abundant oxygen vacancies to effectively lower the adsorption energy of OH-. Consequently, Ni3S2@Ni-Fe LDH exhibits superior OER activity and outstanding stability. The overpotential of Ni3S2@Ni-Fe LDH prepared on nickel foam is only 190 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope is as low as 38 mV dec(-1). The OER performance remains constant after 40 hours of water electrolysis. Our material is among the best non-precious OER catalysts reported so far. The methodology of enhancing the catalytic performance reported here can be extended to other materials for the design and fabrication of low cost OER catalysts with excellent activity.									46	3	0	0	3	0	47			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000437106300012

Nowadays, exploiting low-costing, high-performance, and robust catalysts for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential to improve the overall efficiency of water splitting. Herein, the synthesis, structural characterization, and electrocatalytic OER performance of NiO-NiFe2O4 nanoparticles anchored on reduced graphite oxide frameworks (NiO-NiFe2O4/rGO) were investigated. Facile thermal annealing of the NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) precursor led to the formation of highly dispersible NiO-NiFe2O4 nanoparticles (20-30 nm in size) across the rGO substrate with a NiO/NiFe2O4 molar ratio up to 4.42. In contrast to the nanostructured NiFe-LDH/rGO catalyst, the NiO-NiFe2O4/rGO nanohybrid exhibits a lower OER onset potential (E-onset=1.436 V vs. RHE), affords a smaller overpotential of 296 mV, and achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of about 43 mV dec(-1); these values are comparable to those of the benchmark IrO2 catalyst. The synergy between the abundant catalytically active sites through good dispersion of NiO-NiFe2O4 across the rGO substrate and fluent electron transport arising from the rGO and NiFe2O4 components results in the outstanding electrocatalytic activity. The extremely high catalytic activity, facile synthesis, and low-cost of the NiO-NiFe2O4/rGO nanohybrid make it a very promising catalyst for the OER.									50	1	0	0	0	0	50			2196-0216			WOS:000388382300027

This study prepares nickel-ruthenium layered double hydroxide (NiRu-LDHs) nanosheets subjected to decoration with conductive silver nanoparticles (Ag NP/NiRu-LDHs), which interestingly induce their multivacancies associated with catalytic site activity and populations. The as prepared Ag NP/NiRu-LDH shows excellent catalytic activity toward both OER and ORR features with low onset overpotentials of 0.21 V and -0.27 V, respectively, with a 0.76 V potential gap between OER potential at 10 mA cm(-2) and ORR potential at -3 mA cm(-2), demonstrating that it is the preeminent bifunctional electrocatalyst reported to date. Compared with pristine NiRu-LDHs, the resulting Ag NP/NiRuLDHs nanosheets require only an overpotential of 0.31 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) with excellent durability. The superb bifunctional performance of Ag NP/NiRu-LDH is ascribed to the formation of multivacancies, mutual benefits of synergistic effect between metal LDHs and silver nanoparticles, and increased accessible active sites together with site activity are the key to the perceived performance. This work provides a new strategy to decorate LDHs and to engineer multivacancies to enhance site activity and populations simultaneously as ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts.									81	1	0	0	5	0	81			2155-5435			WOS:000455286600013

Modifications of cellulose films were studied in respect to topography effects by means of atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Chemical effects of plasma treatment were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry. Results show that the topographical evolution of the surfaces to rougher ones is not at all gradual. Local maxima of fractionation and the surface size regularity were investigated using surface fractal analysis and Wenzel roughness factors, respectively. It was shown, that plasma treatments decompose the cellulose material by formation of highly functionalized molecules. Such plasma-initiated and supported reactions taking place on the sample surface. The bulk phase and in particular, the crystalline domains are not influenced by plasma treatments. The studies provide useful information to understand the plasma reaction on amorphous and crystalline regions of cellulose surfaces and allow to predict effects of the plasma treatment on physical and chemical properties of much more complex cellulose systems such as cotton fibres and fabrics.									41	1	0	0	9	0	42			0969-0239	1572-882X		WOS:000290274200027

An alternative method is the reduction of graphene oxide, a material that shares the same atomically thin structural framework as graphene, but bears oxygen-containing functional groups. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the atomistic structure of progressively reduced graphene oxide. The chemical changes of oxygen-containing functional groups on the annealing of graphene oxide are elucidated and the simulations reveal the formation of highly stable carbonyl and ether groups that hinder its complete reduction to graphene. The calculations are supported by infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Finally, more effective reduction treatments to improve the reduction of graphene oxide are proposed.									1392	45	1	0	157	0	1415			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000280078200021	20571578

The studies have revealed that various surface processes and properties, such as the flat-band potential (U-fb), the spectrum and intensity of the PL from a precursor of the oxygen photoevolution reaction, and photoinduced surface roughening, have all strong dependences on the atomic-level structure of the TiO2 surface. Importantly, all the results have been explained on the basis of our recently proposed new mechanism that the oxygen photoevolution reaction is initiated by a nucleophilic attack of an H2O molecule to a surface-trapped hole, thus giving confirmative evidence to it. The molecular mechanisms for photoinduced primary processes at the TiO2 surface, clarified in the present work, will provide a typical model for photoreactions on metal oxides in contact with aqueous solutions.									176	4	0	0	14	1	177			0002-7863			WOS:000231928800054	16159292

A biphasic kinetic model developed in a previous work has been improved considering the evolution of four different reactions with time: (1) the oxidation of formic acid to performic acid, occurring in aqueous phase; (2) the epoxidation reaction, occurring in oil phase; (3) the ring-opening reaction, mainly occurring at the liquid-liquid interface; and (4) the performic acid decomposition, occurring in aqueous phase. The kinetics of reactions 1, 3, and 4 have been studied in an independent way, and the best kinetic parameters found and published elsewhere have been used for interpreting the experimental results obtained in performing reaction 2. A kinetic law for this reaction has been proposed, and the related best-fitting parameters have been determined.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0888-5885			WOS:000600204000008

In this study, polymorphic thin films of MnS2, gamma-MnS, and alpha-MnS were prepared from manganese carbonate through anion exchange and controlled reaction kinetics via a hydrothermal method. At the same mass ratio (1 : 1) of manganese carbonate to the S precursor, the hydrothermal anion-exchange kinetics were used to determine the phases (MnS2, gamma-MnS, and alpha-MnS) of manganese sulfide. The alpha-MnS phase was obtained at a high S precursor content, specifically at a mass ratio of 1 : 5, even at 363 K. The different prepared phases (MnS2, gamma-MnS, and alpha-MnS) exhibited superior O-2 evolution reaction activities (overpotential: 301, 342, and 292 mV, respectively) compared with pristine manganese carbonate (overpotential: 480 mV) in a 1 M KOH electrolyte to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Among all the polymorphs, alpha-MnS exhibited the lowest overpotential because it had the lowest charge-transfer resistance (8.9 omega cm(-2)), edge sharing MnS6 octahedra with more active sites and highest electrochemical active surface area (360 cm(-2)). This study provides a new approach to control the phase of transition-metal chalcogenides for improved electrochemical reactions.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521346600037

This short-time preparation at room temperature is beneficial to avoid the rapid growth of the generated primary nanocrystallites and cause intimate interactions between Fe, Co, and Ni atoms.

To address this challenge, the atomically dispersed Pt is anchored on two Mo-based supports with similar morphology and particle size, that is, face-centered cubic-structured alpha-MoC and MoN. Spectroscopic and computational investigations demonstrate that the Pt atoms are coordinated with N atoms in Pt/MoN but with Mo atoms in Pt/alpha-MoC, leading to an entirely different catalytic performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The Pt mass activity for Pt/MoN reaches 0.71 A/mg(Pt), at 0.9 V [vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)], which is 15 times higher Pt mass activity than that of Pt/alpha-MoC. Density functional theory calculations correlate the better ORR performance of Pt/MoN with the weaker adsorption of OH* because of the modulation of electronic properties of Pt by the coordination with N atoms. This study highlights the importance of controlling the coordination environment of metal atoms in heterogeneous (electro)catalysis and suggests that tuning the coordination environment could be an effective strategy in catalyst development.									71	5	0	0	2	0	72			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100098

Herein, we report bimetallic zeolitic imidazole frameworks (BMZIF)derived hierarchical N-doped carbon spheres anchored with graphene-encapsulated Co nanocrystals (Co@C) and spatially isolated single Co atoms (Co SAs) (denoted as Co-NCS) for highly efficient ORR. An ultrasonic strategy has been developed to uniformly anchor BMZIF on resin microspheres. The ultrasonic method significantly shortens the synthesis time and contributes to the homogeneous distribution of BMZIF. The inner resin spheres act as ideal support to anchor Zn/Co ions and prevent the aggregation of BMZIF nanocrystals, and the derived products provide adequate structural support and high conductivity after carbonization. Meanwhile, the outer BMZIF-derived porous carbon framework provides large specific surface area, promoted electron transport, and abundant exposed active sites. The co-existence of Co SAs and Co@C plays a vital role in the ORR process. The resultant catalyst demonstrates superior ORR performance with a half-wave potential (J1/2) of 0.90 V, outperforming the commercial Pt/C. This work opens a new path to construct efficient Co-N-C based catalysts.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000685363900002

The presence of unique mesopores with a combination of core/shell nanoparticles in the nanosheets showed superior electrochemical performances as a negative electrode for a Li-ion battery (LIB) and an electrocatalyst in Li-O-2 battery applications. A high discharge capacity of similar to 968 mAh g(-1) is noted after 60 cycles with excellent cycling stability when evaluated as an anode for a LIB. On the other hand, the first discharge capacity of similar to 5917 mAh g(-1) is observed with a high reversibility of 95.72% for the Li-O-2 battery point of view. This exceptional electrochemical performance in both applications is mainly attributed to the presence of mesoporous with core/shell 2D nanostructure, which translates more catalytic bifunctional (oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction) active sites for Li-O-2 and sustains the volume variations that occur in a three-dimensional manner upon the charge-discharge process for LIB applications. Ex situ studies, such as transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and impedance spectroscopy studies, are also conducted to validate the reaction mechanisms.									114	2	0	0	5	0	114			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000360323700034

The use of rational design and optimized architectures are effective ways to produce numerous catalytic active sites, fast electron/ion movement, and better adsorption capabilities towards reactants. Here, we report a hierarchical multiporous honeycomb carbon network derived from naturally nitrogen enriched broccoli stem biomass and we have extended its application to a flexible wire supercapacitor as well as an efficient OER and HER electrocatalyst. We have achieved the lowest overpotential of 184 mV (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) for the HER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and 301 mV (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) for the OER, comparatively much better than metal-doped carbon electrocatalysts. The flexible wire supercapacitor achieved an energy density of 3 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 450 W kg(-1) and a gravimetric specific capacitance of 106 F g(-1) at a current rate of 0.5 A g(-1).									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000476913200025

Elemental doping is an essential strategy to improve catalyst activity. Recent studies have shown that appropriate anion-cation-dual doping could greatly promote performance enhancement of OER electrocatalyst due to the synergistic effect of different dopants. Herein, tremella-like N/Fe dual doping nickel phosphides (N/Fe-Ni2P/ Ni12P5) are fabricated for the first time. The N-anion and Fe-cation co-doping synergistically modulate the electronic structure, surface states and microtopography of the sample. The electrochemical surface area and electronic conductivity of the N/Fe-Ni2P/Ni12P5 are thus greatly enhanced. In addition, the computational simulations demonstrate that anion-cation co-doping optimizes adsorption free energy towards oxygencontaining intermediates and thus enhances intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. Consequently, the as-prepared N/Fe-Ni2P/Ni12P5 exhibits splendid OER performances with a low overpotential of 217 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 and an ultra-long durability for over 120 h at high current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH. This work proposes an effective strategy to prepare dual-doped-type phosphide OER electrocatalyst with the promising application potential for large-scale water splitting.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707473100001

However, a facile but efficient method to promote its slow kinetics is still highly demanding. This work demonstrates that Clsurface modification drastically enhances photocatalytic water oxidation over BiVO4 as well as WO3. The optimal modified BiVO4 achieves a photocatalytic activity of 4.2 orders enhancement relative to the pristine BiVO4, giving up to an excellent apparent quantum efficiency of 34.6% at 420 nm. Cl--modified 30-facet BiVO4 with 2.6 times enhancement confirms that the surface reaction involved with photogenerated holes can be dramatically accelerated by Clmodification in addition to enhanced charge carrier separation. Our results highlight the impact of Clmodification on the reaction kinetics and pathway during the photocatalytic water oxidation process, which has been mostly overlooked. Systematic studies (DFT simulations, kinetic experiments) reveal that Clmodification remarkably reduces the photocatalytic water oxidation energy barrier and alters reaction pathway, which is also manifested in facilitated H2O molecule activation in synchronous illumination XPS (SI-XPS) study. The EXAFS and angle-resolved XPS (AR-XPS) results show that Cl bonds to Bi and mainly concentrates on the surface of modified BiVO4. Our findings provide an effective and facile approach to exploring efficient O-2 evolution semiconductors for photocatalytic water splitting.									24	1	0	0	4	0	25			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000620328100001

Herein, a dual-phase spinel MnCo2O4 with nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide hybrid (dp-MnCo2O4/N-rGO) employed in a hybrid Na-air battery system was demonstrated simultaneous electrocatalytic characteristic toward both ORR and OER, which showed comparable ORR and superior OER catalytic performance over commercial Pt/C. The fabricated dual-phase cobalt manganese spinel nanoparticles, the introduced dopants (nitrogen atoms), and the electrical and chemical coupling between the oxide nanoparticles and nanocarbon backbones significantly contribute to the high catalytic performance of dp-MnCo2O4/N-rGO. The proposed catalyst exhibited a slightly higher discharge voltage of 2.75 V and lower charge voltage of 3.14 V compared to that of a commercial Pt/C (2.73 and 3.35 V, respectively). The hybrid battery showed a low overpotential of 039 V and improved round-trip energy efficiency. The battery exhibited excellent discharge stability and no significant degradation was observed during the 25 cycles due to the moderate particle size of dp-MnCo2O4 and large active N-doped surface area. Therefore, dp-MnCo2O4/N-rGO could be a promising bifunctional catalyst for enhancing the electrochemical performance of hybrid Na-air batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Suzuki, T.								Theoretical proposal of a revolutionary water-splitting photocatalyst: The monolayer of boron phosphide								Applied Surface Science				598				153844	153844		10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.153844				2022	2022	Recently, hydrogen generation by water-splitting photocatalysts is attracting attention as a sustainable and clean energy resource. Photocatalytic hydrogen-generation systems are much simpler, cheaper, and easier to scale up than the coupled systems of electrolysis and solar cells, wind-power generation, etc. However, photocatalytic hydrogen generation is currently inefficient. This paper proposes the monolayer of boron phosphide as a stable highly-efficient water-splitting photocatalyst by high-precision density-functional theory calculations using a HSE06 functional with a solvent effect. The monolayer of boron phosphide has a direct allowed energy gap of about 1.4 eV, and functions as a one-step excitation photocatalyst. It absorbs sunlight with wavelengths below about 890 nm (ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light) and produces both hydrogen gas and oxygen gas from water at a suitable pH condition. By calculating the overpotentials of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, its photocatalytic effectiveness was confirmed. The monolayers of boron phosphide will realize green hydrogen revolution.

The photochemical reactions underpinning this process in plants take place in the chloroplast. Chloroplasts evolved similar to 1.2 billion years ago from an engulfed primordial diazotrophic cyanobacterium, and chlororibosomes are responsible for synthesis of the core proteins driving photochemical reactions. Chlororibosomal activity is spatiotemporally coupled to the synthesis and incorporation of functionally essential co-factors, implying the presence of chloroplast-specific regulatory mechanisms and structural adaptation of the chlororibosome(1,2). Despite recent structural information(3-6), some of these aspects remained elusive. To provide new insights into the structural specialities and evolution, we report a comprehensive analysis of the 2.9-3.1 angstrom resolution electron cryo-microscopy structure of the spinach chlororibosome in complex with its recycling factor and hibernation-promoting factor. The model reveals a prominent channel extending from the exit tunnel to the chlororibosome exterior, structural re-arrangements that lead to increased surface area for translocon binding, and experimental evidence for parallel and convergent evolution of chloro- and mitoribosomes.									40	1	0	0	35	0	40			2055-026X	2055-0278		WOS:000430648300011	29610536

In this paper, three metal-containing nanoparticles, namely FeCoNi, were encapsulated into carbonaceous matrixes by simple stirring and calcination. The morphology of as-obtained FeCoNi particles was controlled and investigated by adjusting the amount of melamine as carbon (and nitrogen) source. FeCoNi@NC/CNTs-6 showed the best ORR activity among all of the catalysts. The half-wave potential of the FeCoNi@NC/CNTs-6 is 0.83 V vs. RHE, and its limiting current density is up to 5.16 mA cm(-2). It was found that the unique 3D carbon-based matrix may be the main reason for this enhanced ORR activity. Additionally, higher content of pyridine N and Fe(Co/Ni)N-x group in FeCoNi@NC/CNTs-6 catalyst may be another reason. Finally, FeCoNi@NC/CNTs-6 was also used as a cathode to assemble the zinc-air battery. The results showed that it had better battery performance than the reference Pt/C catalyst. These results could provide theoretical and practical support for the enlarged applicability of similar catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-6549			WOS:000753976900028

Here we adopt a simple method in which ultrathin Co3O4 nanomeshes (2.6 nm) are synthesized to increase the oxygen release under high temperature, allowing a phase transition for the two cobalt oxide types. With the introduction of S atoms in the conversion process, the exposed crystal plane of CoO changes from (0 (1) over bar1) to ((1) over bar 11) owing to the restrictive effect of in-situ formed CoS thin film, which is the first time to reveal the restructuring of substrate under strong interface interactions of heterostructure. By creating abundant interfaces with subtle lattice distortion in CoS/CoO heterostructure, these special interfaces can be deemed as dominant active sites to accelerate the ORR/OER reaction. The CoS/CoO shows a considerable OER performance with an only 20 mV higher potential than IrO2 at 10 mA cm(-2) and decent ORR performances, which realizes a half-wave potential of 0.82 V and high durability. This work may open up a promising way to rationally design hybrid catalysts for efficient and durable application of electro-catalytic devices.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000724183700001

However, rational design of configuration-optimized SMAs with high activity from the perspectives of fundamental electron spin is highly challenging. Herein, N-coordinated Fe single atoms are successfully distributed over axial carbon micropores to form dangling-FeN4 centers (d-FeN4). This unique d-FeN4 demonstrates much higher intrinsic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in HClO4 than FeN4 without micropore underneath and commercial Pt/C. Both theoretical calculation and electronic structure characterization imply that d-FeN4 endows central Fe with medium spin (t(2g)(4) e(g)(1)), which provides a spin channel for electron transition compared with FeN4 with low spin. This leads to the facile formation of the singlet state of oxygen-containing species from triplet oxygen during the ORR, thus showing faster kinetics than FeN4. This work provides an in-depth understanding of spin tuning on SMAs for advanced energy catalysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2666-6758			WOS:000825347700003	35789959

Here we report that a hierarchical nanoporous copper-titanium bimetallic electrocatalyst is able to produce hydrogen from water under a mild overpotential at more than twice the rate of state-of-the-art carbon-supported platinum catalyst. Although both copper and titanium are known to be poor hydrogen evolution catalysts, the combination of these two elements creates unique copper-copper-titanium hollow sites, which have a hydrogen-binding energy very similar to that of platinum, resulting in an exceptional hydrogen evolution activity. In addition, the hierarchical porosity of the nanoporous copper-titanium catalyst also contributes to its high hydrogen evolution activity, because it provides a large-surface area for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, and improves the mass transport properties. Moreover, the catalyst is self-supported, eliminating the overpotential associated with the catalyst/support interface.									384	17	0	0	24	1	390			2041-1723			WOS:000352720700002	25910892

Herein, a hierarchical nanostructure consisting of one-dimension (1D) hollow CoP nanotubes wrapped by nitrogen-doped carbon layer (CoP-HNTs@NCL) is designed through a simple hydrothermal-phosphorization-annealing strategy. Morphology of CoP-HNTs@NCL-0.4 (mass ratio of GO to CoP is 0.4) shows that the exterior surface of hollow CoP-HNTs is firmly coated by NCL with a layer thickness of 5-8 nm. & UDelta;E (E-j10(1.58 V, OER)-E1/2(0.91 V, ORR)) of CoPHNTs@NCL-0.4 is as low as 0.67 V for ORR/OER, which outperforms commercial Pt/C and RuO2 and ranks the top of nonprecious-metal catalysts. Excellent activity and stability of CoP-HNTs@NCL-0.4 for ORR/OER benefit from synergistic effects between CoP and NCL, enhanced mass transfer via 1D hollow structure, and abundant active sites exposed on the interior/exterior surfaces of nanotube wall. Density functional theory calculations confirm that strong coupling interactions lead to interfacial charge polarization to remarkably promote the ORR/OER activities. This study highlights the functions of 1D hollow structure and interface effects in oxygen electrocatalysis, and opens a new avenue for interface construction by synergistically integrating favorable thermodynamics with efficient kinetics through modification of electronic structure.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000772826700005

The experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations results also show that Co3O4 coupled with VO2 in Co3O4/VO2/CC can optimize hydrogen adsorption energy and facilitate electron transport, thereby accelerating the catalytic kinetics for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

Here we show that toroidal Li2O2 particles formed upon discharge gradually convert into flake-like LiOH particles upon prolonged exposure to a DMSO-based electrolyte, and the amount of LiOH detectable increases with increasing rest time in the electrolyte. Such time-dependent electrode changes upon and after discharge are not typically monitored and can explain vastly different amounts of Li2O2 and LiOH reported in oxygen cathodes discharged in DMSO-based electrolytes. The formation of LiOH is attributable to the chemical reactivity of DMSO with Li2O2 and superoxide-like species, which is supported by our findings that commercial Li2O2 powder can decompose DMSO to DMSO2, and that the presence of KO2 accelerates both DMSO decomposition and conversion of Li2O2 into LiOH.									178	8	0	0	13	0	181			1948-7185			WOS:000340807100014	26278088

Studies have shown that heteroatom-doped carbonaceous nanomaterials are effective metal-free electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we design a facile and scalable catalyst doping scheme to manufacture S-doped carbon nitride (S-C3N4). Surprisingly, this metal-free catalyst exhibits excellent OER and ORR electrocatalytic activities in alkaline electrolytes, being comparable to those of commercial Pt/C. For the first time, it is proved by experiments that S doping can not only effectively increase the lattice defects of C3N4 but also promote the conversion of pyrrolic nitrogen to pyridine nitrogen, thereby enhancing the bifunctional catalytic activity (OER and ORR). When the catalyst is used as an air electrode for rechargeable ZABs, its performance is obviously better than that provided by commercial Pt/C. Our findings and material design strategies are expected to provide new ideas for the synthesis of various high-performance carbon-based electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000835699900001	35867903

Herein, ultra-dispersed Co loaded on nitrogen-doped carbon (Co-NC 900) was made up via a sacrificial template pyrolysis method, in which g-C3N4 was employed as a directional two-dimensional (2-D) template, and triethylenediamine and benzimidazole were served as the ligands. The Co-NC-900 has a unique crumpled layer structure and exhibits higher electrocatalytic performance for ORR with a positive half-wave potential of 0.838 V in alkaline solution, which is superior to that of Pt/C (0.808 V vs RHE). Moreover, the Zn-air battery assembled with the Co-NC-900 displayed an ultrahigh specific power of 160 mW cm(-2) and can stably operate for a long term. It also displayed robust charging-discharging cycling performance after 45 h, which was better than commercial Pt/C electrode. This work not only provides a simple and low-cost approach for the preparation of layered porous materials but also opens a new way to improve the electrocatalytic performance of nonprecious-metal materials.

This special issue is dedicated to Professor Tomas Lindahl, co-winner of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his seminal discoveries in the area repair of oxidatively damaged DNA. In the past several years it has become abundantly clear that DNA oxidation is a major consequence of life in an oxygen-rich environment. Concomitantly, survival in the presence of oxygen, with the constant threat of deleterious DNA mutations and deletions, has largely been made possible through the evolution of a vast array of DNA repair enzymes. The articles in this Oxidatively Damaged DNA & Repair special issue detail the reactions by which intracellular DNA is oxidatively damaged, and the enzymatic reactions and pathways by which living organisms survive such assaults by repair processes.									156	5	1	0	124	1	163			0891-5849	1873-4596		WOS:000402552600002	28363603	
J	Li, Yusheng; Feng, Yun; Li, Li; Wu, Keyan; Bo, Xiangjie; Jia, Jianbo; Zhu, Liande								PBA@PPy derived N-doped mesoporous carbon nanocages embedded with FeCo alloy nanoparticles for enhanced performance of oxygen reduction reaction								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				823						153892	10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.153892				MAY 15 2020	2020	Due to the obstacle of sluggish kinetics on cathode of fuel cells and metal-air batteries, developing low-cost and durable electrocatalysts to replace the platinum-based catalysts still remains a grand challenge. Here, we describe a simple self-template approach to synthesize N-doped mesoporous carbon nanocages (FeCo@NC) embedded with FeCo alloy nanoparticles as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst. The resulting heterostructure is derived from corresponding PBA@PPy composites, which are preprepared by polymerization of polypyrrole (PPy) layer on Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocubes. The FeCo alloy nanoparticles with an average particle size of similar to 10 nm are well dispersed and confined within the shell of carbon nanocages. Benefiting from the mesoporous structure and the synergetic interaction of binary metals, the optimized FeCo@NC-3-800 electrocatalyst exhibits comparable ORR performances (0.83 V for half-wave potential (E-1/2), 5.323 mA cm(-2) for limiting current density (J(k))), superior durability and excellent methanol tolerance to the commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). This work provides an appropriate strategy for general, efficient and practical synthesis of more promising non-precious metal electrocatalyst with high ORR activity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, an aMOF-dominated nanocomposite (aMOF-NC) with both structural and compositional complexity has been synthesized using a facile approach. A ligand-competition amorphization mechanism is proposed based on experimental and density functional theory calculation results. The aMOF-NC possesses a core-shell nanorod@nanosheet architecture, including a Fe-rich Fe-Co-aMOF core and a Co-rich Fe-Co-aMOF shell in the core-shell structured nanorod, and amorphous Co(OH)(2) nanosheets as the outer layer. Benefiting from the structural and compositional heterogeneity, the aMOF-NC demonstrates an excellent oxygen evolution reaction activity with a low overpotential of 249 mV at 10.0 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 39.5 mV dec(-1).									91	2	0	0	7	0	91			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000506239900001	31788950

The Co3O4/N-p-MCNTs demonstrates good catalytic performance with the ORR half-wave potential of 0.760 V (vs RHE). Additionally, the Co3O4/N-p-MCNTs exhibits superior limiting current density with higher stability than Pt/C in alkaline solutions. The catalyst obtains a low operating potential (E-j10) of 1.62 V (vs RHE) to achieve a 10 mA cm(-2) current density for OER. The potential difference (Delta E) between E-j10 of OER and ORR half-wave potential is 0.86 V, which is smaller than that of many highly active bifunctional catalysts reported recently. Moreover, a Zn-air battery utilizing Co3O4/N-p-MCNTs as the catalyst in cathode could successfully generate a specific capacity of 768 mAh g(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2), and there is no voltage loss after a continuous discharge of 135 h. The fabricated solid-state rechargeable Zn-air battery displays a high power density and superior long-term cycling stability. Furthermore, first-principles density functional theory simulations were conducted to explore the interfacial properties of the hybrid catalyst, hinting that the N-p-MCNTs could significantly enhance the electrical conductivity of Co3O4 nanoparticles. The free energy diagrams generated from our simulations suggest that the N-p-MCNTs influence the superior ORR performance, while cobalt oxide affects the favored performance of OER The obtained results confirm that the Co3O4/N-p-MCNTs catalyst would have a broad impact and could be used for renewable energy conversion devices.									35	7	0	0	1	0	37			2574-0962			WOS:000473116600057		
J	BARAFFE, I; TAKAHASHI, K								CONTRIBUTION TO THE HEAVY-ELEMENT ABUNDANCES IN THE GALACTIC HALO FROM S-PROCESS NUCLEOSYNTHESIS IN MASSIVE STARS								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				280	2			476	485						DEC 1993	1993	A quantitative estimate is made for heavy-elements enrichment in the early Galaxy that are due to the s-process nucleosynthesis in massive stars. It is based on a realistic calculation of s-process yields from massive stars with varied initial composition, and a simple one-zone model of chemical evolution of the Galactic halo. In particular, we compare the predicted time-variations of Cu, Sr, Y and Zr abundances with those implied from observation. Unlike the others, the present work does not attempt to fit the observational data by parametrized models for various nucleosynthesis processes. Instead, we intend to set the limit to the contributions just from the s-process in massive stars by utilizing results of realistic nucleosynthesis calculation. We bring explicitly the remaining theoretical uncertainties to light, particularly those stemming from the initial O/Fe ratios and in at least one of the key nuclear reaction rates. Using oxygen as our theoretical reference element, we could minimize the effects of the chemical evolution model parameter values. The present results substantiate the idea that the abundance distribution patterns in metal-poor stars could hardly be accounted for by the s-process in massive stars. Finally, we strongly urge observers to clarify the uncertainties in their analyses of heavy elements (Sr, for one) in metal-poor stars.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0004-6361			WOS:A1993ML25300015		
J	Cardona, Tanai					Cardona, Tanai/0000-0003-2076-4115			Thinking twice about the evolution of photosynthesis								OPEN BIOLOGY				9	3					180246	10.1098/rsob.180246				MAR 20 2019	2019	Sam Granick opened his seminal 1957 paper titled 'Speculations on the origins and evolution of photosynthesis' with the assertion that there is a constant urge in human beings to seek beginnings (I concur). This urge has led to an incessant stream of speculative ideas and debates on the evolution of photosynthesis that started in the first half of the twentieth century and shows no signs of abating. Some of these speculative ideas have become commonplace, are taken as fact, but find little support. Here, I review and scrutinize three widely accepted ideas that underpin the current study of the evolution of photosynthesis: first, that the photochemical reaction centres used in anoxygenic photosynthesis are more primitive than those in oxygenic photosynthesis; second, that the probability of acquiring photosynthesis via horizontal gene transfer is greater than the probability of losing photosynthesis; and third, and most important, that the origin of anoxygenic photosynthesis pre-dates the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis. I shall attempt to demonstrate that these three ideas are often grounded in incorrect assumptions built on more assumptions with no experimental or observational support. I hope that this brief review will not only serve as a cautionary tale but also that it will open new avenues of research aimed at disentangling the complex evolution of photosynthesis and its impact on the early history of life and the planet.									26	3	0	0	21	0	28				2046-2441		WOS:000790322600003	30890026	
J	Jiameng Liu; Changbao Wang; Yingpan Song; Shuai Zhang; Zhihong Zhang; Linghao He; Miao Du								Two-dimensional triazine-based porous framework as a novel metal-free bifunctional electrocatalyst for zinc-air battery								Journal of Colloid and Interface Science				591				253	63		10.1016/j.jcis.2021.02.007				June 2021	2021	A metal-free carbon catalyst, melem-cyanuric acid complex (MCAC), was prepared by hydrogen bonding assembly and further explored as a novel bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The proposed MCAC network presented nanosheet-like structure, nitrogen-rich, and large specific surface area, which are close to the natures of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO), but giving much more defect active sites and regular framework structure. Compared with the g-C3N4, N-rGO and other reported carbon-nitride electrocatalysts, the MCAC nanosheets exhibited a lower overpotential of 1.45 V at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for OER, along with a higher half-potential of 0.8 V and larger limit current density of -6.0 mA cm-2 for ORR. Density functional theory calculation revealed that the melem N atoms bonded with cyanurate greatly enhanced the OER activity by increasing the interaction between catalysts and intermediates. Furthermore, as a metal-free electrocatalyst, MCAC displayed superior reversible oxygen electrocatalytic activity, giving a small overpotential difference (0.76 V). The rechargeable zinc-air battery with MCAC as the air electrode in a two-electrode configuration showed a high open-circuit potential of 1.383 V and a specific capacity of 613.5 mA h gZn-1 at 10 mA cm-2. This work opens up a new avenue to develop advanced porous solids as metal-free electrocatalysts for the energy storage and conversion applications.

By adding tungsten carbide, melamine and SiO2 into the early-stage phenolic resin ageing, we prepared the integrated porous catalyst precursors. The chemical state and interaction of key elements in non-Pt catalysts were regulated by high-temperature carbonization, template removal and secondary calcination. Finally, excellent non-Pt oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts were prepared. The catalyst prepared at 850 degrees C formed a core-shell (WC@C) structure, and had good catalyst performance after 4 h of secondary calcination. The ORR activity reached 1.027 V under alkaline media, which is higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. The high ORR activity and stability of the WC@C/N/CA catalysts were explained via X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurement. The specific surface area was improved because of the porous structures, resulting in the enhancement on the density of active sites.

The delocalization effect of metalloporphyrins on the ORR and OER activities had been investigated experimentally and theoretically by using transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni) tetra(4-thiophenephenyl) porphyrin (M-TThP), M tetra(thienyl)porphyrin (M-TTP) and M tetra(phenyl)porphyrin (M-TPP). The results showed that Co complexes with S-doped large-conjugated framework was beneficial for 4e(-) ORR and exhibited better OER performance. Furthermore, the oxygen electrocatalytic activity differences in prepared metalloporphyrins had been rationalized by the pi-pi interactions between the metalloporphyrin and carbon black. This work demonstrates the delocalization of meso-substituents in metalloporphyrins plays a vital role in both oxygen electrocatalysis for these materials and the well-designed metalloporphyrin molecular catalysts are promising candidates for energy storage technology.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000716126700001

Here, an effective integrated design of urchin-like core-shell TiO2/alpha-MnO2 nanostructure is constructed to develop an efficient catalyst electrode for Li-O-2 batteries. For this purpose, TiO2 nanoparticles are biosynthesized by an eco-friendly process using flower extract of Matricaria chamomilla as both reducing and stabilizing agents. Then, MnO2 nanocrystals are grown on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles under different reaction times to observe their evolution in terms of morphology and crystalline structure of MnO2. The electrochemical behavior of the as-prepared core-shell TiO2/alpha-MnO2 nanostructures is evaluated in Li-O-2 cells. The TiO2/alpha-MnO2 electrode is exhibited a lower overpotential and higher specific capacity than the bare TiO2 electrode. This could have resulted from the bifunctional catalytic activity of TiO2 and alpha-MnO2 coupled with urchin-like MnO2 nanostructures. Furthermore, the internal resistance of the cell is recorded using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique, and reactions of the Li' and O-2 on the cathode surface are investigated by cyclic voltammetry.

Herein, highly dispersed ultrathin carbon-coated nickel oxide nanoparticles settled on carbon cloth (NiO@C/CC) as efficient catalysts for alkaline fuels oxidation are synthesized via an air-assisted transient thermal shock strategy. This NiO@C/CC catalyst induces an outstanding catalytic activity (up to 119.1 mA cm(-2)) and durability (a little current decay during tests) in electrooxidation for ethanol, even for methanol and ethylene glycol, which outperforms most of the reported non-noble metal catalysts. The excellent catalytic performance of NiO@C/CC is essentially attributed to the oxygen vacancies, high concentration, high-valence-state Ni, and carbon layers of NiO@C NPs, which contribute to regulate the surface properties and electronic structure, enhance charge transfer, and provide abundant active sites, promoting adsorption capacity of reactant molecules on its surface. The facile and promising air-assisted transient thermal shock strategy can be extended to guide rational design and rapid synthesis of transition metal compounds as advanced catalysts for alkaline direct alcohol fuel cells.									43	2	0	0	1	0	42			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000575422400001

The remarkable energy content of the oxygen cathode, the replacement of the lithium metal anode by a nanostructured stable lithium-alloying composite, and the concomitant use of nonflammable ionic liquid-based electrolyte result in a new and intrinsically safer energy storage system. The lithium-ion/oxygen battery delivers a stable capacity of 500 mAh g(-1) at a working voltage of 2.4 V with a low charge-discharge polarization. However, further characterization of this new system by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveals the progressive decrease of the battery working voltage, because of the crossover of oxygen through the electrolyte and its direct reaction with the LixSn-C anode.									39	4	0	0	1	0	40			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000363001500062	26389522

In this work, the Fe-Ce@GSL catalysts have developed by first constructing the MOF/LDH/GO templates with multi-stage mixed growth method followed by calcining the template at high temperature. Fe-Ni-LDH (hydrotalcite) plays the role of linking the metal organic frameworks (Fe-Ce-MOF) and graphene oxides (GO), avoiding the separation of MOFs derivatives and GO sheets during pyrolysis process. Rare-earth metal oxide (CeO2) featuring with abundant oxygen vacancies dispersed on the surface of transition-metal oxide can efficiently improve the stability of catalysts. The optimal Fe-7-Ce-1@GSL-800 catalysts exhibit excellent ORR/OER performances with the potential gap between ORR (E-1/2 = 0.87 V) and OER (E-J=10 = 1.59 V) of 0.720 V.

Herein, a series of nickel-based bimetallic selenide, Ni1-xMxSe2 (M = Fe, Co, Cu), nanowires (NWs) grown on carbon fiber paper (CFP) were first synthesized by a general approach, selenizing the corresponding bimetallic oxide NW precursor on CFP, and utilized as anodes for the ammonia-borane (AB) electrooxidation reaction (AOR) in 0.1 M KOH. These nominal Ni1-xMxSe2 anodes exhibit dramatically M-dependent catalytic activities towards the AOR and the electrocatalytic activity follows the order Ni1-xCuxSe2 > Ni1-xFexSe2 > Ni1-xCoxSe2. In particular, the catalytic activity of the Ni1-xCuxSe2 is exceptionally high, surpassing most of the previously reported ECs for the AOR. The follow-up investigations unveil that the Ni1-xMxSe2 NWs on CFP have been converted into ultrathin, porous Ni1-xMxSe2-y-OOH nanosheets (NSs) after the AOR, which presents a unique electrochemical strategy for the synthesis of novel ultrathin bimetallic selenide-oxyhydroxide NSs. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the Ni1-xMxSe2-y-OOH NS anodes exhibit much higher catalytic activities toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than the pristine Ni1-xMxSe2 NW anodes because of the advanced architectures rendering larger electrochemical accessible surface areas (ECSAs) and a modified electronic structure. This work provides a new perspective for design and exploration of highly efficient and durable nonprecious-metal-based ECs for clean energy conversion devices.									14	1	0	0	1	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000475689800029

Here, we report the synthesis of 3D porous carbon-based electrocatalyst by self-assembling Co-metal organic frameworks (MOF) building blocks on graphene via a layer-by-layer technique. Precise control of the structure and morphology is achieved by varying the MOF layer to tune the electrocatalytic properties. The as-produced electrocatalyst exhibits an excellent catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction in 0.1 mol L-1 KOH, showing a high onset potential of 0.963 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a low tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1), compared to Pt/C (0.934 V and 52 mV dec(-1), respectively). Additionally, it shows a slightly lower potential vs. RHE (1.72 V) than RuO2 (1.75 V) at 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline electrolyte. A rechargeable Zn-air battery based on the as-produced 3D porous catalyst demonstrates a high peak power density of 119 mW cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 0.578 V while retaining an excellent stability over 250 charge-discharge cycles.

Building highly ordered porous structures while maintaining their overall crystalline orderliness is highly desirable, but remains an arduous challenge. Here, we have synthesized bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on highly ordered three-dimensional (3D) polystyrene templates by controlling the nucleation process. The ordered macro pores with 190 nm diameters were uniformly distributed on the as-prepared ZnCo zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZnCo-ZIF). Afterwards, 3D ordered micro-meso-macroporous Co-N-doped carbon polyhedrons (3DOM Co-NCPs) was developed by calcination. With the synergy of the highly dispersed Co-N-C catalytic sites and the distinct porous structure, the synthesized 3DOM Co-NCPs exhibit impressive bifunctional activity. Additionally, the 3DOM Co-NCPs-900 for Zn-air battery exhibits extraordinary power density, high energy density, and acceptable stability. This approach offers a useful strategy for the fabrication of highly efficient electrocatalysts with 3D ordered porous. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

It was found that desorption of both species occurs via CO evolution, especially when the starting metal has an excess of carbon. Desorption of carbon and oxygen in liquid niobium are second-order processes with a first-order dependence on C and O concentrations, indicating that the overall reaction rate is controlled by the substep of recombination of C and O. The rate equations for C and O desorption are found to be (dO/dt)(des) = (dC/dt)(des) = 3.80 . 10(4) (A/V) exp (-47,500/T) (C(e) O(e) - CO), where C and O are the carbon and oxygen concentrations in atomic percent, respectively, A is the surface area of the sample in square centimeters, V is the volume in cubed centimeters, and the subscript e denotes the equilibrium concentration.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1073-5615			WOS:000077777800019		
J	Popov, N. A.				Popov, Nikolay/AAU-2062-2020				Effect of singlet oxygen O-2(a 1 Delta(g)) molecules produced in a gas discharge plasma on the ignition of hydrogen-oxygen mixtures								PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				20	4					045002	10.1088/0963-0252/20/4/045002				AUG 2011	2011	A kinetic model describing the impact of singlet delta oxygen O-2(a (1)Delta(g)) produced in a gas discharge plasma on the evolution of hydrogen-oxygen mixture composition is developed. In the framework of this model the possibility of describing all the main experimental data on the dynamics of O2(a (1)Delta(g)) quenching in H-2 : O-2 gas mixtures in the temperature range T-0 = 300-1050K is shown. Most of the collisions between singlet oxygen molecules and atomic hydrogen, O-2(a (1)Delta(g)) + H, lead to quenching of O-2(a (1)Delta(g)). The efficiency of this interaction channel is more than 80% and the fraction of the reaction H + O-2(a (1)Delta(g)) -> OH + O(P-3) is only 10-20%. The impact of singlet oxygen O-2(a (1)Delta(g)) admixture on the ignition of H-2 : O-2 mixtures is investigated. The dominant process determining the degree of O-2(a (1)Delta(g)) impact is its deactivation by HO2 molecules. As a result, in H-2 : O-2 mixtures of high pressure, where the number density of the produced HO2 molecules can be sufficiently high, the impact of singlet oxygen on the ignition delay time of these mixtures turns out to be relatively weak. This effect becomes even less noticeable if admixtures of atomic oxygen are present in the mixture. Oxygen atoms produced by the discharge are more efficient in the ignition of hydrogen-oxygen and hydrogen-air mixtures than O-2(a (1)Delta(g)) molecules. Thus, to reduce the ignition delay time and to decrease the temperature threshold of combustive mixtures, the use of gas discharge systems providing the efficient production of atomic particles is recommended.									37	0	2	0	1	0	39			0963-0252	1361-6595		WOS:000295829800004

The trimetallic nanostructured materials are synthesized and designed in different architectures for energy conversion electrocatalysis. The as-synthesized trimetallic nanostructures have found unique physiochemical properties due to the synergistic combination of the three different metals in their structures. A vast array of approaches such as hydrothermal, solvothermal, seed growth, galvanic replacement reaction, biological, and other methods are employed to synthesize the trimetallic nanostructures. Noteworthy, the trimetallic nanostructures showed better performance and durability in the electrocatalytic fuel cells. In the present review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent strategies employed for synthesizing trimetallic nanostructures and their energy-related applications.

Pristine gC(3)N(4), however, suffers from inadequate light absorption profile, limited surface area and significant recombination of photo-induced electron-hole pairs, thus requiring reformative strategies. Herein, this work has employed elemental doping of oxygen to gC(3)N(4) (O-gC(3)N(4)) and uncovered the evolution of properties that arises in conjunction with increasing doping level. These intrusive changes in properties by increasing oxygen doping levels are then evaluated based on the trends observed from photocatalytic hydrogen (H-2) evolution. It is revealed that oxygen doping had a competing dual effect to the photocatalytic activity. On one hand, oxygen doping introduced more porosity and added sub-gap impurity states in its electronic band structure, which resulted in enhanced light harvesting capabilities. On the other hand, impurity levels from high density oxygen groups behave detrimentally as potent electron-holes recombination centers. This became the governing factor for higher doping levels O-gC(3)N(4), which thereby resulted in a weakened photoactivity compared to pristine gC(3)N(4). In overall, it is hoped that the findings of this study can provide a new understanding of the rational design and oxygen-doping strategy for gC(3)N(4) for its photocatalytic enhancement.									39	1	0	0	6	0	39			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000502040600175

In this work, we reported for the first time that 2-methylimidazole (2-MIM) can effectively regulate the loading of transition metals nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe) on nitrogen-doped graphene hollow spheres (NGHS) entangled with N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs). The introduction of 2-MIM not only effectively controls the size of loaded metal nanoparticles (NPs), but also plays a significant role in the formation of the metal alloy. In addition, the introduction of Ni is the key factor for the self-growth of NCNTs, and the introduction of Fe serves a key role in promoting the formation of metal nitrides and improving the bifunctional performance of the electrode materials. The NiFe3@NGHS-NCNTs obtained after optimization of the preparation parameters exhibit excellent ORR/OER bifunctional electroactivity and long-term durability, which has obvious advantages over commercial 20% Pt/C + RuO2 catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrated that the NiFe3 alloy is strongly coupled with N-doped carbon (NC), endowing the C active site with moderate positive charge and valence state, thus improving the ORR and OER performance of the NiFe3@NGHS-NCNTs. More importantly, a rechargeable liquid electrolyte Zn-air battery (ZAB) with NiFe3@NGHS-NCNTs as the air cathode delivers a comparatively small charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.737 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and displays maximum power density of 126.54 mW cm(-2), which is higher than that of the commercial 20% Pt/C + RuO2 catalyst (102.63 mW cm(-2)). The fabricated flexible all-solid-state (ASS) rechargeable ZAB with NiFe3@NGHS-NCNTs exhibits a higher open-circuit voltage (OCV) (1.44 V) and peak power density (102.82 mW cm(-2)) than ASS-ZABs based on 20% Pt/C + RuO2 (1.42 V, 35.35 mW cm(-2)).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000803004300001

Here, the amorphous nickel oxide NiOx supported on carbon nanosheets was prepared by the photochemical metal organic deposition method. The evolution of the crystalline structure, microstructure, and 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR) activity in 0.1 M KOH was systematically investigated. The results reveal that the amorphous NiOx is highly efficient and selective toward 2e-ORR with an onset potential of 0.76 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), 91% selectivity, and an electron transfer number of similar to 2.2 over a wide potential range of 0.15-0.60 V versus RHE, which is outstanding among the metal oxide-based catalysts for 2e-ORR. Such a performance is closely associated with the mesoporous structure of the carbon nanosheets. Furthermore, the appropriate bonding strength of Ni-OH derived from the amorphous nature is crucial for the high selectivity. The theoretical calculation reveals that the *OOH intermediate prefers to adsorb on the amorphous NiOx-C by the end-on mode, facilitating the 2e-ORR process. The present amorphous NiOx loaded on carbon nanosheets can be promising electrocatalysts for synthesizing H2O2 after the stability issues are well addressed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000821321400001

For this purpose and maximize the utilization of noble Pt, we present here a facile, yet scalable strategy for the high-precise synthesis of 1-nm-thick Pt3Ni bimetallic alloy nanowires (Pt3Ni BANWs). The seed-mediated growth mechanism of Pt3Ni BANWs was identified subsequently. As expected, the Pt3Ni BANWs delivered enhanced mass activity (0.546 A mg(pt)(-1), exceeding the 2020 target of DOE) in comparison to Pt nanowires assembly (Pt NWA, 0.098 A mg(pt)(-1)) and Pt/C (Pt, 0.135 A mg(pt)(-1)), because of the rational integration of multiple compositional and structural advantages. Moreover, the Pt3Ni BANWs displayed enhanced durability (37% MA retention) than Pt NWA and Pt after 50 000 potential cycles. All these results indicate that the ultrathin Pt3Ni BANWs are potential candidates for catalyzing ORR with acceptable activity and durability. The present work could not only provide a facile strategy but also a general guidance for the design of superb performance Pt-based nanowire catalysts for ORR.									91	10	0	0	1	0	92			2155-5435			WOS:000467335600072

In this study, we re-investigated the role of N-terminal region of PsbP on the basis of its three-dimensional structure. In previous paper [Ifuku and Sato (2002) Plant Cell Physiol 43: 1244-1249], a truncated PsbP lacking 19 N-terminal residues (Delta 19) was found to bind to NaCl-washed PS II lacking PsbP and PsbQ without activation of oxygen evolution at all. Three-dimensional (3D) structure of PsbP suggests that deletion of 19 N-terminal residues would destabilize its protein structure, as indicated by the high sensitivity of Delta 19 to trypsin digestion. Thus, a truncated PsbP lacking 15 N-terminal residues (Delta 15), which retained core PsbP structure, was produced. Whereas Delta 15 was resistant to trypsin digestion and bound to NaCl-washed PS II membranes, it did not show the activation of oxygen evolution. This result indicated that the interaction of 15-residue N-terminal flexible region of PsbP with PS II was important for Ca2+ and Cl- retention in PS II, although the N-15-terminal residues were not essential for the binding of PsbP to PS II. The possible N-terminal residues of PsbP that would be involved in this interaction are discussed.

The Rh@Co@Pt-skin NDs exhibited remarkable increase in the catalytic characters such as the more positive onset potential (E-onset) and the greater mass activity (MA) towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than commercial Pt/C, homemade PtCo nano-particles (NPs), CoRh nanoflowers (NEs) and PtRh NDs.

Both copper-cobalt and cobalt spinel nanoparticles were synthesized using a silica-template method. Hybrid materials consisting of an activated carbon (AC), cobalt oxide (Co3O4), and copper-doped cobalt oxide (CuCo2O4) nanoparticles, were obtained by dry mixing technique and evaluated as electrocatalysts in alkaline media for hydrogen evolution reaction. Physical mixtures containing 5, 10, and 20 wt.% of Co3O4 or CuCo2O4 with a highly microporous activated carbon were prepared and characterized by XRD, TEM, XPS, physical adsorption of gases, and electrochemical techniques. The electrochemical tests revealed that the electrodes containing copper as the dopant cation result in a lower overpotential and higher current density for the hydrogen evolution reaction.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10				1996-1944		WOS:000467767400108	31010022

The surface reconstruction from the CoO6 octahedrons to the CoO4 tetrahedrons is revealed at CoO (111) surface, which enhances the OER activity and the stability of VO at the surface of CoO (111). The existence of VO changes the electron accumulation around the Co atoms and the bonding state between Co and O atoms, and thus, affects the adsorption of OH and deprotonation process. By analyzing the electron structure, the nature of the activity changes at Co sites due to the surface reconstruction and the introduction of VO is revealed. Our investigation provides a theoretical basis for the design and application of Co-based OER catalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0039-6028	1879-2758		WOS:000658755800001

By using the computational screening method based on the density functional theory (DFT), we have systematically studied a wide range of transition metal (TM) atoms doped a defective BC3 monolayer (B atom vacancy V-B and C atom vacancy V-C), denoted as TM@V-B and TM@V-C (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir and Pt), as efficient single atom catalysts for OER and ORR. The calculated results show that all the considered TM atoms can tightly bind with the defective BC3 monolayers to prevent the atomically dispersed atoms from clustering. The interaction strength between intermediates (HO*, O* and HOO*) and catalyst govern the catalytic activities of OER and ORR, which has a direct correlation with the d-band center (epsilon(d)) of the TM active site that can be tuned by adjusting TM atoms with various d electron numbers. For TM@V-B catalysts, it was found that the best catalyst for OER is Co@V-B with an overpotential eta(OER) of 0.43 V, followed by Rh@V-B (eta(OER) = 0.49 V), while for ORR, Rh@V-B exhibits the lowest overpotential eta(ORR) of 0.40 V, followed by Pd@V-B (eta(ORR) = 0.45 V). For TM@V-C catalysts, the best catalyst for OER is Ni@V-C (eta(OER) = 0.47 V), followed by Pt@V-C (eta(OER) = 0.53 V), and for ORR, Pd@V-C exhibits the highest activity with eta(ORR) of 0.45 V. The results suggest that the high activity of the newly predicted well dispersed Rh@V-B SAC is comparable to that of noble metal oxide benchmark catalysts for both OER and ORR. Importantly, Rh@V-B may remain stable against dissolution at pH = 0 condition. The high energy barrier prevents the isolated Rh atom from clustering and ab initio molecule dynamic simulation (AIMD) result suggests that Rh@V-B can remain stable under 300 K, indicating its kinetic stability. Our findings highlight a novel family of efficient and stable SAC based on carbon material, which offer a useful guideline to screen the metal active site for catalyst designation.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000610368100075	33410443

In this paper, we demonstrate a convenient strategy to reduce the PGM loading in electrolysis by using ultra-low Pd loaded electrocatalysts supported on 3D architectures of titania (TiO2) nanotubes. This manuscript focuses on the following aspects: (1) a comprehensive analysis of the synthesis of the TiO2 support using water-based electrolytes; (2) the deposition of Pd catalyst to the support by either physical vapour deposition or dropcast and (3) functional characterisation of the obtained materials for hydrogen and oxygen evolution in both acidic and alkaline environments. A new strategy is developed to obtain short low aspect ratio 3D titania nanotubes arrays (TNTA) and we demonstrate that an extremely low quantity of Pd (81 mu g cm(-2)) is sufficient to obtain significant activity improvement in an Anion Exchange Membrane (AEM) water electrolyser.

Single-phase Ru1-xMnxO2/C, Ru1-x-yMnxCoyO2/C and Ru1-xCoxO2/C catalysts significantly boosted ORR kinetics in al-kaline media. Moreover, they were H-2 and methanol tolerant, and exhibited long term stability due to their single-phase structure. Ru0.85Mn0.15O2/C stood out as the most active catalyst among them. A volcano re-lationship of the ORR activity of these binary and ternary metal oxide catalysts vs. the O adsorption energy was found, with the maximum activity observed for the Ru1-xMnxO2/C, Ru1-x-yMnxCoyO2/C and Ru1-xCoxO2/C catalysts due to their optimal O binding energy. These materials have potential applications as highly active ORR catalysts in alkaline fuel cells and metal-air batteries.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000552015900013

We have established a bipolar electrodeposition system assisted by a constant magnetic field to fabricate a Co/Fe/Ni phytate catalyst with good electrocatalytic activity for overall water splitting. The effects of magnetic and electric fields on the catalytic properties of the material were studied. The catalyst prepared with an N-pole magnetic field (NPMF) exhibited good overall water splitting performance. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the Co/Fe/Ni-phytate and the advantages of the N-pole magnetic field the NPMF electrode has a continuous 25 hours high-efficiency hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in1.0 M KOH compared with commercial RuO2 and Pt/C. Bipolar electrodeposition with a constant magnetic field is thus an efficient means to fabricate electrocatalytic water splitting catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2192-6506			WOS:000612786800021	33481358

The roughness factor of platinum of 31 was achieved. Within the potential region of both hydrogen and oxygen underpotential deposition, in both acidic and alkaline solutions, the composite Pt/Ta2O5 electrode displayed an excellent electrochemical response characteristic of smooth polycrystalline platinum. The preparation method applied in this work presents an easy way to obtain an electrode surface combining the behaviour of smooth polycrystalline platinum with the behaviour of microdisc arrays. Its electrocatalytic effectiveness was demonstrated for an oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline solutions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In D1-R323D and D1-R323L mutants, the replacement of arginine by aspartate or leucine, respectively, resulted in the disruption of electron transport at the donor side of photosystem II. The rate of oxygen evolution in D1-R323D decreased twice as compared to the pseudo-wild type (pWT), and in D1-R323L no oxygen evolution was detected. The latter mutant was not capable of photoautotrophical growth. The dynamics of changes in oxygen content, the reduction of photosystem II active reaction centers (Delta F/F'(m)), and hydrogen production rate in pWT were found to be similar to the wild type if cultivated under sulfur deprivation in a closed bioreactor. The observed gradual decrease in the Delta F/F'(m) value turned to a sharp drop almost to zero followed by a partial recovery during which the production of hydrogen set in. The transition to the anaerobic phase in D1-R323D cultured in a sulfur-deprived medium occurred earlier than it happened in pWt under the same conditions. However, the partial recovery of photosystem II activity and hydrogen production started at a later time, and the rate of hydrogen production was low. The D1-R323L mutant incapable of oxygen evolution entered the rapidly anaerobiosis but produced no hydrogen. The kinetics of photoinduced redox transitions in P700 was similar in all investigated strains and was not affected by diuron addition. This implies that the mutants had a pool of reducers, which could donate electrons through the quinone pool or cytochrome to photosystem I. However, in D1-R323L mutant lacking the active photosystem II, this condition was not sufficient to support hydrogenase activity.									2	0	1	0	2	0	3			0006-3029	0006-3509		WOS:000233860400014	16358786

In this work, we demonstrate a novel heterostructure with easily depositing CeO2 nanoparticles on the surface of the metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived Co0.4Ni1.6P nanowire arrays. Such an interface engineering strategy triggers the formation of abundant oxygen vacancies and provides more electrocatalytically active sites. Besides, the synergistic effect in this composite can regulate the electronic structure, and lead to an enhanced charge-transfer ability. Benefiting from the above superiorities, this heterostructure exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic performance towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH electrolyte, requiring overpotentials (eta) of 268 and 343 mV to yield current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, accompanied by a low Tafel slope of 79.3 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, the electrocatalytic performance of this heterostructure for the OER in simulated alkaline seawater (1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl) was also studied, and it achieved low eta values of 345 and 394 mV to drive 100 and 200 mA cm(-2), respectively. This work presents a simple approach to fabricate heterostructural electrocatalysts with CeO2 nanoparticles for high-performance water/seawater electrolysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000749156700001	35103730

To harness the predictive ability of such descriptors, structural and chemical evolutions of the material when exposed to operating conditions, such as oxidizing environments and high temperatures, need to be considered. These evolutions occur at length scales not easily observable, leading to averaging over short-range variations and thus misinterpretation of the property in question. Here, we investigate perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.5CoO3-delta as a prototypical mixed ionic-electronic conductor that exhibits promising catalytic properties toward the oxygen evolution reaction in electrochemical cells, which have been characterized by such descriptors. We employ spatially resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy and find a Cahn-Hilliard-type decomposition process at sub-micrometer length scales after mere hours at operating or processing conditions. The observation is in contrast to the thermodynamic stability of the Pr0.5Ba0.5CoO3-delta bulk, suggesting the decomposition to be confined to the surface. Our results showcase a considerable lateral inhomogeneity of the surface electronic structure, emphasizing that descriptors derived through spatially averaging techniques have to be heavily scrutinized.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000651787500047

Inspired by the experimental realization of monolayer beta-phase GeSe which has a moderate bandgap and excellent transport properties, based on the first-principles calculations, we identify a new class of compelling two-dimensional (2D) materials, beta-MX (GeS, GeSe, SnS and SnSe), which not only exhibit good feasibility for experimental exfoliation and excellent chemical stability, but also satisfy the bandgap and band edge requirements of the redox potential of water splitting. Excitingly, monolayer beta-GeSe and beta-SnSe exhibit remarkable optical absorption ability in the visible region, strongly anisotropic transport properties and a relatively small exciton binding energy of 0.50 eV (beta-GeSe) and 0.55 eV (beta-SnSe), favorable for the separation of photogenerated carriers (electrons and holes). The low overpotential in the oxygen evolution reaction and high overpotential in the hydrogen evolution reaction for monolayer beta-SnSe are attributed to the relatively large exciton binding energies, indicating that it can make a directional adjustment to the effective separation of photoexcited carriers for monolayer beta-SnSe. Therefore, we can expect a high photocatalytic activity for solar-energy harvesting and water splitting for beta-GeSe and beta-SnSe monolayers.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000573889000040

ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				10	30			25422	25428		10.1021/acsami.8b06948				AUG 1 2018	2018	Hydrogen (H-2) is presently one of the most promising clean and renewable energy sources, but the conventional hydrogen production by electrochemical water-splitting, though of great potential and extensively studied, is seriously obstructed especially by the anodic oxygen evolution reaction because of its sluggish kinetics. Herein, we report the efficient hydrogen production from methanol solution using facile-synthesized ultrathin 2D bi-metal-organic framework nanosheets (UMOFNs) as a precious metal-free anodic catalyst. The prepared UMOFNs showed a much lowered anodic potential of 1.365 (V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) at 10 mA cm(-2), which was markedly 232 mV lower than that in conventional water splitting, and moreover, the average turnover frequency reached 19.62 s(-1). Benefiting from nearly 100% Faraday efficiency of H-2 production on the counter graphite carbon electrodes without additional electrocatalysts, high-purity hydrogen was produced with enhanced efficiency. More importantly, the anodic electro-reaction mechanism has been evidenced experimentally: the electrocatalytic hydrogen production from the methanol solution is a methanol-assisted water splitting, rather than a methanol-reforming process as claimed in a number of literature studies, in which methanol is oxidized as a sacrificing agent in place of water oxidization in pure water.									60	2	0	0	4	0	60			1944-8244			WOS:000440956000052	29987922

Herein, we report a facile two-step method to synthesize three-dimensional hierarchically porous urchin-like Ni2P microsphere superstructures anchored on nickel foam (Ni2P/Ni/NF) as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. The Ni2P/Ni/NF catalysts were prepared by template-free electro-deposition of porous nickel microspheres on nickel foam followed by phosphidation. The hierarchically macroporous E (V) superstructures with 3D configuration can reduce ion transport resistance and facilitate the diffusion of gaseous products (H-2 and O-2). The optimal Ni2P/Ni/NF exhibited remarkable catalytic performance and outstanding stability for both the HER and OER in alkaline electrolyte (1.0 M KOH). For the HER, Ni2P/Ni/NF afforded a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of only -98 mV. When it served as an OER electrocatalyst, Ni2P/Ni/NF was partially oxidized to nickel oxides/hydroxides/oxyhydroxides (mainly NiO) on the catalyst surface and exhibited excellent OER activity with small overpotentials of 200 and 268 mV to reach 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, when Ni2P/Ni/NF was employed as the electrocatalyst for both the cathode and anode, a water splitting electrolyzer was able to reach 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH at cell voltages of 1.49 and 1.68 V, respectively, together with robust durability. Various characterization techniques and controlled experiments indicated that the superior activity and strong stability of Ni2P/Ni/NF for overall water splitting originated from its electrochemically active constituents, 3D interconnected porosity, and high conductivity.									599	33	0	0	18	0	610			2155-5435			WOS:000369774900028

Herein, an ultrafast (30 s) interfacial reaction strategy is developed to construct the NiCo-LDH@FeOOH hetero-interface structure integrated on carbon fiber paper (NiCo-LDH@FeOOH/CFP) by a wet chemical etching method, which is involved in the Fe3+-triggered Hthorn ions formation and etching as well as the Fe3+ ions hydrolysis. The as-made NiCo-LDH@FeOOH/CFP features enriched interfacial active sites and finely modulated electron structure, thus realizing the remarkable electrocatalytic activity and durability for water oxidation with an ultralow overpotential of only 224 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, this ultrafast interfacial reaction strategy can be expanded to construct other Ni-containing hydroxide@FeOOH hetero-interface structure, which will shed a new light on the further construction of bi/multi component hetero-structure materials in electrocatalysis and energy-related fields.									37	3	0	0	3	0	38			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000513814400064

The parameters of an Arrhenius-like equation describing the temperature dependence of induction period have been obtained. A new method for evaluation of the parameters from nonisothermal differential scanning calorimetry measurements, based on the dependence of onset temperature of the oxidation peak on heating rate, is presented. It has been shown that the method gives parameters not affected by systematic errors. These can be used in modeling the oxidation process where the effects of oxygen diffusion, heat transfer, and evolution of reaction heat are explicitly involved. The results obtained by differential scanning calorimetry are compared with the Oxidograph measurements. The discrepancies between the results obtained by the two methods are accounted for by oxygen diffusion within the samples.									64	1	0	0	24	1	65			0003-021X			WOS:000087758300012

The catalyst precursor was prepared by potentiostatic reverse-pulse coelectrodeposition from an acetonitrile solution on graphite. Accelerated aging was obtained by quasi-in-situ voltammetric cycling in an acidic electrolyte. Using photoelectron imaging and microspectroscopy of single Co/PPy grains at a resolution of 100 nm, we tracked the ORR-induced changes in the morphology and chemical state of the pristine material, consisting of uniformly distributed similar to 20 nm nanoparticles, initially consisting of a mixture of Co(II) and Co(III) oxidation states in almost equal amounts. The evolution of the Co 2p, O 1s, and N 1s spectra revealed that the main effects of aging are a gradual loss of the Co present at the surface and the reduction of Co(III) to Co(II), accompanied by the emergence and growth of a N 1s signal, corresponding to electrocatalytically active C-N sites.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000345721400024	25369153

The lifetimes of these stars in different phases of stellar evolution are significantly extended, namely, in the pre-main sequence, main sequence, and red giant phases. In particular, intermediate-mass stars in the red giant phase experience significant changes in their luminosity and chemical composition. The annihilations of dark matter particles affect the interior of the star in such a way that the 3 alpha reaction becomes less efficient in the production of carbon and oxygen. This dark matter effect contradicts the excess of carbon and other metals observed today in stars of low mass and low metallicity. Hence, we can impose an upper limit on the dark matter halo density, and therefore on the redshift, at which the first generation of low-metallicity stars formed.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000335810700025

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is more favourable on the type II rather than type I electrodes due to its higher hydration degree. There are a likely three Pd(IV) oxycations formed on the type I electrode, which are revealed by a combination of changing electrolyte's pH values and adding ethanol in the solutions. The peak potential of palladous oxide reduction shifts to a less positive value with decreasing its hydration degree.

Herein, we propose how to overcome this limitation by integrating noble metal atoms into the lattice of transition metal oxides to create a new type of hybrid structure. This study shows that iridium single atoms can be accommodated into the cationic sites of cobalt spinel oxide with short-range order and an identical spatial correlation as the host lattice. The resultant Ir0.06Co2.94O4 catalyst exhibits much higher electrocatalytic activity than the parent oxide by 2 orders of magnitude toward the challenging oxygen evolution reaction under acidic conditions. Because of the strong interaction between iridium and cobalt oxide support, the Ir0.06Co2.94O4 catalyst shows significantly improved corrosion resistance under acidic conditions and oxidative potentials. This work eliminates the "close-packing" limitation of noble metals and offers promising opportunity to create analogues with desired topologies for various catalytic applications.									109	7	0	0	6	0	110			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000639019400040	33764061

A total of 25% of the acrolein that binds to the surface is converted to products. Notably, carbon-carbon coupling occurs with 86% selectivity for formation of C-6 products: C6H8, identified as 1,3-cyclohexadiene, in a peak at 500 K and benzene immediately thereafter at 530 K. Acrolein is evolved from the surface in three peaks: a peak independent of coverage at 495 K, attributed to decomposition of an intermediate that is partly converted to C6H8; a coverage-dependent peak that shifts from 370 K (low coverage) to 260 K (high coverage), which is attributed to adsorption at 5-fold coordinated Ti sites; and a multilayer state at 160 K. Water and acrolein compete for 5-fold coordinated titanium sites when dosed sequentially. The addition of water also opens a new reaction pathway, leading to the hydrogenation of acrolein to form propanal. Water has no effect on the yield of 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Exposure of the surface to oxygen prior to acrolein dosing quenches the evolution of acrolein at 495 K and concurrently eliminates the coupling. From these results, we propose that reduced subsurface defects such as titanium ion interstitials play a role in the reactions observed here. The notion that subsurface defects may contribute to the reactivity of organic molecules over reducible oxide substrates may prove to be general. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, the influence of thermal effects on the polymerization behavior are investigated. The effects of up-conversion particles content and NIR laser intensity on the polymerization rate and surface oxygen inhibition were systematically investigated, and the temperature evolution and complex viscosity changes in the polymerization system during the polymerization process were also monitored. In addition, polymerization experiments conducted on a controlled temperature platform were used to study the effect of NIR heating on the polymerization behavior. The results show that the near-infrared thermal effect promotes the polymerization reaction, but also causes severe oxygen inhibition which has an adverse effect on polymerization. Finally, NIR curing materials with enhanced mechanical properties than those of conventional UV curing materials were obtained.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000714534400001	34643984

Benzene proved to be the stronger adsorbate on copper, leading to a poisoning of the catalyst. Phenol, water, and deep combustion products could be detected. The evolution of the benzene radical cation was observed in situ, while benzene and oxygen were adsorbed on the sample either simultaneously or alternatingly. At the same time, the total spin density of the sample and thus the oxidation state of copper were monitored. A new reaction path based on the interplay of the zeolitic hydroxyl groups and the exchanged copper ions was proposed. The benzene resides inside the zeolites channel intersections, but due to benzene molecules blocking the channels, the products are hardly able to diffuse out and thus have to be extracted.									29	3	0	0	1	0	31			1932-7447			WOS:000287833200024

In particular, we focus the attention on non-metal doped graphene systems, which were reported to present excellent performances as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathodic electrode of fuel cells and are, thus, considered promising substitutes of platinum or platinum alloys electrodes. The methodology, originally proposed by NOrskov et al. (J. Phys. Chem. B 2004, 108, 17886) for electrochemical processes at metal electrodes, is revisited and applied specifically to doped graphene. Finite molecular models of graphene are found to perform as well as periodic models for localized properties or reactions. Therefore, the sophisticated molecular quantum mechanics methodologies can be safely used to compute reliable Gibbs free energies of reaction in an aqueous environment for the various steps of reduction (at the cathode) or of oxidation (at the anode). Details of the reaction mechanisms and accurate cell onset- or over-potentials can be derived from the Gibbs free energy diagrams. The latter are computational quantities which can be directly compared to experimentally obtained cell overpotentials. Modeling electrocatalysis at fuel cells is, thus, an extremely powerful and convenient tool to improve our understanding of how fuel cells work and to design novel potentially active electrocatalytic materials. In this work, we present two specific applications of B-doped graphene, as electrocatalysts for the ORR at a half-cell cathode and for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) at a half-cell anode.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			0020-7608	1097-461X		WOS:000385574800002

It is then used to model reacting airflows for velocities 2-3 km/s, with the primary focus on the flow evolution inside the boundary layer. The feasibility of using the reflected shock configuration for the evaluation of vibrational energy accommodation, as well as the gas-phase recombination reaction rate constants, is studied. Finally, low- and high- fidelity real gas effect models are used to assess the model impact on gas macroparameters under nonequilibrium conditions.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0887-8722	1533-6808		WOS:000658537100015

After treatment, the integral procedure decomposition temperature and the activation energy of Lyocell fibers are significantly increased by various concentration factors. These phenomena were indicated by the dehydration, rearrangement, formation of carbonyl groups, the evolution of carbon monoxide and dioxide, and carbonaceous residue formation. These effects were indicating the slow pathway of flame retardancy for the Lyocell fibers and are attributed to the two different flame-retardant agent treatments.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1976-4251	2233-4998		WOS:000486190200011

Here, an electrocatalyst of metallic iridium anchored on mesopomus carbon nanofibers (Ir-mCNFs) is reported. After optimized the nanostructure (pore-forming agent content) of Ir-mCNFs, at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential reaches 28 and 39 mV in alkaline and acid medium. Moreover, the content of Ir in this catalyst is just around 6 wt%.

Tuning the interfacial structure of catalyst has emerged as an effective strategy to optimize the intrinsic catalytic activity. In this study, we demonstrated the deposition of Ru nanoparticles by freshly prepared strong reductive Ti(III) oxide, resulting in Ru/reduced TiO2 interface with oxygen vacancies. The as-prepared Ru/r-TiO2 exhibited a superior HER performance over commercial Pt/C in alkaline media, with only a small overpotential of 15 mV required to deliver the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a high turnover frequency of 8.74 s(-1) achieved at an overpotential of 100 mV. Density functional theory calculation indicates that high electrocatalytic activity of Ru/r-TiO2 is originated from the promotion of water dissociation and weakening OH adsorption by reduced TiO2 , which facilitate the conversion of water to H-2. This work provides an efficient strategy for the design of high-performance HER catalysts.									16	0	0	0	2	0	15			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000702599200001

The flames are established on a porous flat flame burner with equivalence ratio equal to 2 and a maximum name temperature of 1800 and 1870 X. Detailed size distributions are obtained by the burner-stabilized stagnation (BSS) flame sampling approach using a,scanning mobility particle sizer. The flame temperature profiles fire determined for each separation distance between the burner surface and stapation surface/probe oririce, It is shown that the flames can be modeled closely using in opposed jet flame code without having to estimate the effect of probe perturbation, The measured and simulated temperature profiles, show good agreement. The evolution of lie soot size distributions for n-dodecane flames are similar to those observed in ethylene flames, The size distributions are characteristically bimodal, indicating strong, persistent nucleation over a large range of residence times in the flame. Under similar conditions, the nucleation mode in the n dodecane flames is stronger than that in comparable ethylene flames.									28	2	0	0	0	0	29			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000270671500010

This process occurs at high temperatures and pressures (300 degrees C, 200 atm) and often gives small amount of acetic acid as a final product. In this work, we demonstrate using acetic acid as a model compound that organic molecules can be activated electrochemically such that they react at room temperature with oxygen, resulting in mineralization of even acetic acid present in 1 M HClO4 supporting electrolyte. This electrochemically induced activation occurs during anodic polarization of boron-doped diamond electrodes (BDD) in air/oxygen-saturated solutions. The direct evidence for this process was found during electro-oxidation of acetic acid saturated with isotopically labelled O-18(2) resulting in evolution of (CO2)-O-18 and (COO)-O-16-O-18. We suggest that the mechanism of activation on BDD is initiated by hydroxyl radicals formed on the electrode surface. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Here, high-entropy perovskite oxides with composition Ba-x(FeCoNiZrY)(0.2)O3-delta (B-x(FCNZY)(0.2) (x = 0.9, 1) are reported as eNRR catalysts. The eNRR activity of high-entropy perovskite oxide is enhanced by changing the nonstoichiometric metal elements at the A-site, thus generating additional oxygen vacancies. The NH3 yield and Faraday efficiency for B-0.9(FCNZY)(0.2) are 1.51 and 1.95 times higher than those for B(FCNZY)(0.2), respectively. The d-band center theory is used to theoretically predict the catalytically active center at the B-site, and as a result, nickel was identified as the catalytic site. The free energy values of the intermediate states in the optimal distal pathway show that the third protonation step (*NNH2 -> *NNH3) is the rate-determining step and that the increase in oxygen vacancies in the high-entropy perovskite contributes to nitrogen adsorption and reduction. This work provides a framework for applying high-entropy structures with active site diversity for electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000794096700002

The results show that nitrogen is incorporated into the structure of the carbon nanotubes (N-CNT), and the MnCo2O4 nanoparticles are well-dispersed on the surfaces of CNTs uniformly. The ORR performance of the as-synthesized MnCo2O4/N-CNTs composite is measured by electrochemical tests. The results reveal that after the introduction of conductive carbon material into the MnCo2O4 nanoparticles, the MnCo2O4/N-CNTs hybrid exhibits high electrocatalytic activity, long-term stability, and excellent poisoning resistance under neutral conditions, which is due to the strong coupling effect between the MnCo2O4 nanoparticles and the N-doped carbon nanotubes. Meanwhile, the incorporation of Mn into the spinel structure of Co3O4 also has a positive impact, outperforming Co3O4/N-CNTs in terms of the redox potential.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000368411300003

As such, hypoxia and concomitant nutrient scarcity affect large gene expression programmes, signalling pathways, diverse metabolic reactions and various stress responses.

CeO2 reacts with F2 gas from 130-degrees-C and converts into CeF3 with a characteristic weight decrease above 270-degrees-C. The reaction rate was found to be determined by fluorine gas diffusion described by a modified Jander equation, and the activation energy is estimated to be 80 to 90 kJ/mol. Fluorine is incorporated into the crystal lattice of CeO2 without change of structure or oxidation state of Ce(IV) below 270-degrees-C. To convert into CeF3, the valency Ce(IV) drastically changes to Ce(III) with evolution of oxygen at 270 to 290-degrees-C.									20	0	0	0	0	2	22			0022-1139			WOS:A1992JM83300015

Plasma luminescence that interferes with the fluorescence from H and O atoms was observed to decay completely within 15 ns, which is the minimum delay required for imaging measurements with respect to the discharge occurrence. During discharge, H atoms in the excited state rather than the ground state, produced by electron-impact dissociation processes, are detected at the flame front. It was found that the temporal evolution of H and O fluorescence intensity during a cycle of 100 mu s between two discharge pulses remains constant. Finally, the decay time of O-atoms produced by the discharge in the fresh methane-air mixture was about 2 mu s, which suggests a faster reaction between O-atoms and methane than in air.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000643540200001

However, there is still a lack of sufficient research on rational reconstruction of catalyst, especially in the field of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation. This work successfully reconstituted Ni MOF/Ag via surface-electrochemical activation, revealing that Ni3+/Ag+ is the main active species for HMF oxidation. This unique evolution not only acquired high-valence active species, but also stably anchored Ag species to the catalyst surface through the generated NiOOH. Importantly, the initial-potential of activated Ni MOF/Ag for HMF oxidation is much smaller than oxygen evolution reaction (OER), so HMF oxidation is more favorable than OER. Meanwhile, open-circuit potential vs. time experiments well illustrated that Ni3+/Ag+ species exhibited the superior self-healing ability during the conversion of HMF -> 2, 5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Nearly 100% HMF conversion and 98.6% Faraday efficiency of FDCA were obtained at 1.623 V vs. RHE. Therefore, a struc-ture-activity relationship between the reconstructed Ni3+/Ag+ species and HMF oxidation was deeply dissected for efficient production of FDCA.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000875315100002

Here, we report the preparation of well-ordered ultrathin film (UTF) electrodes based on layered double hydroxide nanosheets (LDH NSs) and iron porphyrin (Fe-PP) through an electrostatic layer-by-layer (LBL) technique, which show excellent OER performance. By virtue of the high catalytic activity of LDH NSs and good electron-transfer ability of Fe-PP, the resulting CoNi-LDH NS/Fe-PP UTF exhibits a remarkably low overpotential (264 mV) to attain an OER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a substantially decreased Tafel slope of 37.6 mV dec(-1), much superior to that of the IrO2 catalyst. Moreover, this method can be extended to the preparation of other UTFs based on LDHs and Fe-PP (e.g., CoMn-LDH NS/Fe-PP, CoFe-LDH NS/Fe-PP and ZnCo-LDH NS/Fe-PP) with significantly enhanced OER performance relative to pristine LDH NSs. To illustrate the advantage of these UTFs in practical water splitting, a prototype electrolyzer cell is also fabricated by using the (CoNi-LDH/Fe-PP)(30) UTF as the anode and Pt wire as the cathode, which achieves the production of both oxygen and hydrogen by using a 1.5 V AA battery as the power source.									84	5	0	0	1	0	84			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000379965800041

The mixed Ni-Co-oxides were found more Electrocatalytically active compared to their respective oxides and showed lowest Tafel slope of 160 mV/decade compared to 305 and 233 mV/decade for Ni-oxide and Co-oxide respectively. At measured applied potential of 1.00 V/SCE the mixed Ni-Co oxide anode generated a current density of 127 mA cm(-2) compared to similar to 30.0 mA cm(-2) for OER at their individual oxide surfaces. These current densities corresponded to O-2 evolution rates of 1.18 mMol cm(-2) h(-1) at Ni-Co oxide anode and similar to 0.28 mMol O-2 cm(-2) h(-1) at both Ni-oxide and Co-oxide anodes. These results indicate over four-fold increase in OER rate at the mixed Ni-Co oxide anode due to synergetic effect of both oxides compared to their individual oxide surfaces.

Seeking a suitable organic oxidation reaction with a lower redox potential to replace the OER is a promising method to boost the overall efficiency of the CO2ER. Here, we propose a method of substituting the OER with a glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) for the CO2ER to achieve the coproduction of formate at both the cathode and anode. A two-electrode GOR-assisted CO2ER system is successfully established with a Ni foam-supported surface-sulfurized nickel-cobalt hydroxide nanoneedle catalytic anode (Ni0.33Co0.67(OH)(2)@HOS/NF) and a BiOI cathode. The simultaneous formation of formate from the anodic GOR and cathodic CO2ER with faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of 90% and 92%, respectively, is obtained at a cell voltage of 1.9 V (22.4 mA cm(-2)). More significantly, an overall electricity-to-formate energy conversion efficiency of 110% is obtained in our GOR-assisted CO2ER system. This work not only proposes an energy- and atom-efficient method for the CO2ER but also provides new insights for developing highly active non-noble metal catalysts for the GOR.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000731717100001

However, to date, a full understanding of the electro-catalytic properties of CNs is still lacking. Herein, by using density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the catalytic performances in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), N-2 reduction reaction (NRR), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) of monolayer graphitic carbon nitrides (C1-xNx), C3N (x = 1/4), C2N (x = 1/3), and g-C3N4 (x = 4/7). We also evaluated the NRR activity of B doped C1-xNx, and the CO2RR activity of Cu and Pd modified C1-xNx. The cohesive energy and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) results show that C3N, C2N, and g-C3N4 are stable at room temperature. The C3N-C1 site is predicted to deliver the best HER catalytic performance with a reaction Gibbs free energy (Delta G(H*)) of -0.03 eV (close to the ideal value (0 eV)). Among the studied C1-xNx materials, the C3N-C2 site is predicted to possess a favorable eta(OER) of 0.82 V for OER. Pure C3N, C2N, and g-C3N4 are not suitable for NRR and CO2RR. Due to the strong hybridization between the N 2p orbital and the B 2p orbital, the NRR performances of B doped B-N-C2N, B-N-C3N, and B-N-g-C3N4 are greatly enhanced, with corresponding overpotential eta(NRR) of 0.57 V, 0.70 V, and 0.72 V, respectively. The transition metals Cu and Pd can enhance the CO2RR activity of C3N, C2N, and g-C3N4. The limiting potentials U-L of pure C3N, C2N, and g-C3N4 are 0.96 V, 0.86 V, and 2.37 V, respectively, while these values are 0.63 V, 0.68 V, and 0.77 V with Cu or Pd modification. This work provides deep understanding of the catalytic properties of monolayer C1-xNx and guidance for synthesizing higher activity catalysts in the future.									7	2	0	0	0	0	7			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000526715200024	32175552

Taking inspiration from this, we developed a novel bifunctional electrode consisting of two monolayer thick manganese dioxide (delta-MnO2) nanosheet arrays on a nickel foam, using a novel in-situ method. The bifunctional electrode exposes numerous active sites for electrocatalytic rections and displays excellent electrical conductivity, resulting in strong performance for both HER and OER. Based on detailed structure analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the remarkably OER and HER activity of the bifunctional electrode can be attributed to the ultrathin d-MnO2 nanosheets containing abundant oxygen vacancies lead to the formation od Mn3+ active sites, which give rise to halfmetallicity properties and strong H2O adsorption. This synthetic strategy introduced here represents a new method for the development of non-precious metal Mn-based electrocatalysts for eddicient energy conversion.									559	34	0	0	25	0	562			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000411182500031

Nitrogen-containing compounds in the tar bring threatens to the environment and heavy components in the tar contributes to undesired coke formation. In current study, the evolution of heavy tar, especially the nitrogen-rich components, during SPBG is revealed for the first time. It was found that heavy components were mainly distributed in the mass range of 150-450 Da, where aromatics consisted of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen atoms were the most abundant. Deamination (-NH3) and the combination of quinoline accompanied with the generation of the heavy components. Organics from sludge could react with biomass to form heavier oxygen-containing molecules. Meanwhile, steam from sludge promoted heavy components to crack by tar reforming reactions and consumed radicals in bio-char to inhibit the catalytic cracking of tar. Under the combination of above reactions, more heavy molecules were generated at low sludge volatile/biomass ratio and the aromatic content in the heavy tar decreased at high sludge volatile/biomass ratio.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0048-9697	1879-1026		WOS:000861079200002	36055490

This work reviews the current status of 'membraneless' water electrolysis cells that safely avoid need for such a separator membrane. Three different approaches have been used to realize such cells. In the first approach, laminar flow within a microfluidic reaction chamber has been used to entrain the hydrogen and oxygen gas bubbles in separate, parallel streams that do not mix. In the second approach, closely-spaced porous electrodes have had liquid electrolyte divergently pumped through them to sweep the produced hydrogen and oxygen bubbles to different locations. In the most recent, promising approach, gas diffusion electrodes have been used to directly extract gas as it is produced, thereby avoiding discernible bubble formation and eliminating the need for a separator membrane to keep the gases separate.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2451-9103			WOS:000788053500023

Introducing mesopores into substrate carbon materials would help expose more active sites and improve mass/charge transfer in the microenvironments near active sites, thus accelerating ORR. Nonetheless, it is still challenging to construct atomically dispersed metal-nitrogen-carbon with mesoporous structures. Herein, we propose a facile strategy to synthesize atomically dispersed Fe-Nx sites doped mesoporedominated carbon nanodisks catalysts (Fe-N/CNDs) using functionalized zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIF-D). The Fe-N/CNDs-900 catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity (Eo = 1.03 V, E1/2 = 850 mV), as well as excellent long-term durability and methanol tolerance, ascribed to synergistic effect of the Fe-Nx active sites and the surrounding mesoporous structures. This work presents a promising method to develop highly efficient metal-nitrogen-carbon ORR catalysts using functionalized MOFs. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we use nano impact electrochemistry as an additive-free method to overcome this problem. Due to the efficient mass transport at individual catalyst nanoparticles, high current densities can be realized. High-resolution bright-field transmission electron microscopy and selected area diffraction studies of the catalyst particles before and after the experiments provide valuable insights in the transformation of the nanomaterials during harsh oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions. We demonstrate this for 4 nm sized CoFe2O4 spinel nanoparticles. It is revealed that these particles retain their size and crystal structure even after OER at current densities as high as several kA.m-(2). The steady-state current scales with the particle size distribution and is limited by the diffusion of produced oxygen away from the particle. This versatilely applicable method provides new insights into intrinsic nanocatalyst activities, which is key to the efficient development of improved and precious metal-free catalysts for renewable energy technologies.									57	1	0	0	3	0	55			0002-7863			WOS:000475540800016	31145608

Here, stable platinum-group metal clusters (Pt, Pd and Au) trapped by structure defects within carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were fabricated with a simple and scalable in situ electrochemical strategy. The Pt clusters demonstrated superior electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with 100-fold increase over the mass activity of the benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C and a much lower overpotential. It was suggested that vacancy defective structures (di- and mono-vacancies) stabilized the Pt cluster from migration and oxidation and optimized the electronic densities of state, hence activating the Pt species for efficient HER with high stability. These results provide new insights into the effects of structural defects on active phases and afford a facile but competitive strategy to synthesize stable and desired catalysts.									37	4	0	0	0	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000473054500040

Cerium ammonium nitrate (CAN) is the most commonly used sacrificial oxidant to explore the potentiality of WOCs. It is usually assumed that CAN has the unique role to oxidatively energize WOCs, making them capable to offer a low-energy reaction pathway to transform H2O to O-2. Herein, we show that CAN might have a much more relevant and direct role in WO, mainly related to the capture and liberation of O-O-containing molecular moieties.									48	1	0	0	4	0	48			2155-5435			WOS:000379457300060

The dual electrolyte, made of polyvinyl alcohol and Xanthan gum, has a different water content, lower at the anodic interface, where parasitic reactions involving hydrogen production play a crucial role in hindering metal re-deposition, and higher at the cathode side, where water, depending on the pH, allows an efficient reduction of oxygen during discharge or the oxygen evolution during cell charging. The galvanostatic cycles show in the first discharge and charge cycles, the characteristic plateau trends of secondary batteries. By electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis effected after each discharge/charge phase and by measuring anode and cathode potentials during cycling, it is demonstrated that, during the first cycles, the re-deposition of aluminum is possible by adopting adequate water management in the electrolyte, while the cell malfunctioning in the subsequent cycles is mainly due to the damage of the cathode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000753354100001

The goal is to identify possible beneficial synergistic catalytic effects between the two oxides and to investigate the role of alkali-metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+ and Cs+) for promotion of electrocatalytic activity and durability. The combination of the two, structurally different, oxides, improves the bifunctional activity compared to the individual oxide components, as shown by either lower apparent Tafel slopes or higher exchange current densities for ORR and OER in 6 M KOH. Insertion of potassium ion in the oxide structure either by longer-term exposure to 6 M KOH or by an accelerated potential driven intercalation method, lowers further both the OER and ORR overpotentials. At constant current density of 5 mA cm(-2) (or 5 A g(-1) catalyst) for two hours, the OER overpotential is lowered by 110 mV and 152 mV due to potential driven potassium ion insertion in MnO2-LaCoO3 and MnO2-Nd3IrO7, respectively. For ORR, at -2 mA cm(-2) (or -2 A g(-1) catalyst) the overpotential on MnO2-LaCoO3 is decreased by 75 mV. In addition, the stability of the potassium ion activated catalysts is also improved. The ORR activity promotion effect is specific to potassium compared to all other investigated alkali metal hydroxides (LiOH, NaOH, CsOH), whereas for OER, cesium ion also has a beneficial effect. The electrode kinetic results are supported by surface analysis showing the presence of potassium in the catalyst. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society.

Electronic and magnetic properties of alpha-MnO2 from ab initio calculations								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				88	14					144428	10.1103/PhysRevB.88.144428				OCT 31 2013	2013	alpha-MnO2, an active catalyst for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, has been investigated using ab initio calculations with different exchange-correlation functionals: the generalized-gradient approximation in the version of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE), PBE + U, and hybrid functionals. Both hybrid functionals and PBE + U (U >= 2.0 eV) fail to capture the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state found experimentally, and a ferromagnetic configuration has the lowest energy. An AFM ground state is then recovered when using PBE or PBE + U (U <= 1.6 eV). Interestingly, a reduction of the gap is observed at increasing values of the U parameter. We offer a qualitative explanation for the change in the calculated ground state employing the results for the electronic structure and physical arguments similar to those exposed in the Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson rules. It is argued that the p(z) orbital of oxygen atoms with sp(2) hybridization plays a fundamental role in the superexchange AFM interaction and in the reduction of the gap.									31	0	0	0	4	0	31			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000326389400003

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a slow reaction that provides low-cost electrons for water reduction reactions. Thus, finding an efficient, low-cost, stable, and environmentally friendly OER catalyst is critical for water splitting. Here, sodium cobalticarborane (1) is introduced as a promising precatalyst for forming an OER cobalt-based catalyst. The cobalt-based catalyst was characterized by several methods and is suggested to be Co(III) (hydr)oxide. Using fluorine-doped tin oxide, glassy carbon, platinum, and gold electrodes, the OER activity of the cobalt-based precatalyst was investigated. The overpotential for the onset of OER in the presence of 1 is 315 mV using fluorine-doped tin oxide electrodes. The onsets of OERs in the presence of 1 using gold, platinum, and glassy carbon electrodes in KOH solutions (1.0 M) turned out to be 275, 284, and 330 mV, respectively. The nanoparticles on the gold electrodes exhibit significant OER activity with a Tafel slope of 63.8 mV/decade and an overpotential at 541 mV for 50 mA/cm(2). In the case of the glassy carbon electrodes, a Tafel slope of 109.9 mV/decade and an overpotential of 548 mV for 10 mA/cm(2) is recorded for the catalyst. This paper outlines an interesting approach to synthesize cobalt oxide for OER through a slow decomposition of a precatalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000736853700001	34951771

However, for gas-related electrocatalytic reaction, sluggish gas transport has inhibited significantly the promotion of electrocatalytic performances. Herein, hierarchical monolithic material 3DPC-650 and 3DPC-650@Ni/Ni(OH)(2) were prepared by 3D printing polyethyleneimine cross-linking oxygenated carbon nanotube and following nickel electrodeposition. 3DPC-650 and 3DPC-650@Ni/Ni(OH)(2) have regular pore structure in consistence with 3D printing design and uniform dispersed elements. Amide bonds and carbon defects are presented on the surface of 3DPC-650 and 3DPC-650@Ni/Ni(OH)(2) as well as uniformly distributed beta-Ni(OH)(2) on 3DPC-650@Ni/Ni(OH)(2). 3DPC-650 and 3DPC-650@Ni/Ni(OH)(2) present lower overpotentials of 322 and 160 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction in 1.0 M KOH at 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. The ordered channel, high turnover frequency and electrochemically active surface area, hydrophilic and aerophobic properties result in the higher performance of 3DPC-650 and 3DPC-650@Ni/Ni(OH)(2) than traditional supports (carbon paper, carbon cloth, and nickel foam) and electrocatalysts. This work provides an efficient pathway for design and preparation of the monolithic electrocatalyst and electrode used for electrochemical reactions where gas is involved.

Density functional theory calculations predict an increased inter-facial charge transfer between interstratified LDH and TMD nanosheets, which would lead to enhanced electrocatalytic activity. The electrostatically driven self-assembly of oppositely charged 2D building blocks, i.e., exfoliated Ni-Al-LDH/Ni-Fe-LDH and MoS, nanosheets, yields mesoporous heterolayered Ni-Al-LDH-MoS2/Ni-Fe-LDH-MoS2 superlattices. The synthesized superlattices show improved electro-catalytic activity with enhanced durability for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions and water splitting. The interstratification improves the chemical stability of LDH in acidic media, thus expanding its possible applications. The high electrocatalytic activity of the superlattices may be attributed to an enhanced affinity for OH-/H+, improved electrical conduction and charge transfer, and the increase of active sites. This study indicates that the formation of superlattices via self-assembly of 2D nanosheets provides useful methodology to explore high-performance electrocatalysts with improved stability.									99	6	0	0	3	0	99			2380-8195			WOS:000430369600027

However, no systematic study of their bifunctional catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) has yet been published. More significantly, the reported catalytic capabilities of Pt SACs have almost been exclusively measured using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) with a three-electrode configuration, which does not accurately reflect the catalysts' performance during operation within single-cell devices. Herein, we demonstrate the immobilization of isolated Pt atoms on a carbon nanosheet support doped with ultrahigh N content (12.1 at%; Pt/NCS) to create a bifunctional HER/HOR catalyst. Compared with commercial Pt/C, the developed Pt/NCS catalyst delivered high utilization as well as excellent mass activity enhancement and stability for both reactions. As a final test, a rigorous catalyst evaluation was conducted in both a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer and a PEM fuel cell. As expected, with only half the Pt loading of commercial Pt/C, Pt/NCS-based electrodes in the electrolyzer and the fuel cell still exhibited slightly better performance than those based on Pt/C. This work constitutes a huge step from the academic study of Pt-based SCAs to their industrial application, and it focuses more attention on the harsh evaluation and optimization of SACs within commercial-scale devices.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2398-4902			WOS:000611818900021

In this work, a novel free-standing Co3S4/CoMo2S4 heterostructure on nickel foam by a facial hydrothermal method is demonstrated to be an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting (OWS). The synthesized Co3S4/CoMo2S4 electrocatalyst achieves ultralow overpotentials of 143 mV@10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 221 mV@25 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, in 1 M KOH. Moreover, it presents a greatly improved durability and stability under operando electrochemical conditions. When used as catalysts for OWS, the Co3S4/CoMo2S4-3//Co3S4/CoMo2S4-3 electrodes just need 1.514 V to make it to the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). It is supposed that the introduction of heterogeneous interface between Co3S4 and CoMo2S4 could give rise to plentiful active sites and enhanced conductivity, and thus boost excellent catalytic performances. Moreover, the porous feature of free-standing nanosheets on nickel foam could benefits catalytic performances by accelerating charge transport and releasing bubbles rapidly. This work proposes a bifunctional catalyst system with the heterogeneous interface, which could be used in a sustainable green energy system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000686336900001	34343978

It is observed that above 70 degrees C, below an anode current density of 100 Am-2 and below a concentration of 20 g/L hydrochloric acid, the deposition of manganese dioxide takes place preferentially. Among the probable electrochemical reactions EMD deposition, oxygen evolution and chlorine evolution occur under the present experimental conditions. The data collected employing an all-glass apparatus also confirm the results.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0376-4710			WOS:A1997XZ19700009

However, Cr(VI) removal and environmental variable evolution of in-situ reactive zones using XG-nZVI/rGO as a remediation agent are not well understood. In this study, in-situ remediation of Cr(VI)-contaminated aquifer using XG-nZVI/rGO in three-dimensional sandbox was investigated. Results showed that XG-nZVI/rGO could form an in-situ reaction zone in the aquifer and effectively remove Cr (VI) downstream of the injection for 108 h. The injection of XG-nZVI/rGO could change the aquifer conditions from oxidizing into reducing environment by significantly reducing dissolved oxygen and oxidation-reduction potential of the reaction zone, which would provide favorable conditions for Cr(VI) removal. Meanwhile, solution pH of the aquifer did not fluctuate before and after XG-nZVI/rGO injection, indicating that remediation would not significantly change the acid-alkaline system. The process did not produce a great quantity of Fe2+, which was toxic to environmental microorganisms.									7	0	0	0	4	0	7			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000615213900006

In contrast with an unmodified RuO2-TiO2/Ti electrode, the LaCoO3-RuO2-TiO2/Ti electrode displays a more uniform layer with smaller microparticles. This electrode also displays higher OER performance with lower overpotential (289 mV vs. 348 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and lower Tafel slope (87 mV dec(-1) vs. 104 mV dec(-1)) than the unmodified RuO2-TiO2/Ti electrode. The modified LaCoO3-RuO2-TiO2/Ti electrode possesses larger current density, higher specific voltammetric charge, and lower charge transfer resistance (R-ct) than the unmodified RuO2-TiO2/Ti electrode does in a KOH solution, according to CV and EIS studies. The LaCoO3-RuO2-TiO2/Ti electrode is very stable.

Diisopropyl-substituted silanediols of the general formula HO(i-Pr)(2)Si[OSi(i-Pr)(2)](n)OH (n = 0,1) have been successfully functionalized by using 2-methylallylsilanes or 2-methylallylgermanes in the presence of scandium trifluoromethanesulfonate to yield new linear tri- and tetrasiloxanes or germasiloxanes under mild conditions. The reaction can be readily extended to the synthesis of high molecular weight polysiloxanes by using di(methylallyl)silane as a metalating agent.

In the current work, we demonstrate that the long term stability of ZnO photoanode with the introduction of proton transfer media. Proton transferable polymer such as nafion allows favorable transport of the generated H+ ions from the surface of ZnO photoanode to electrolyte and results in an enhanced its stability. Nafion polymer film was coated on the surface of ZnO thin film photoanode with each selectively exposed (002), (100) and (101) facet. Especially, nafion film with (002) crystal facet ZnO photoanode showed 3.9 mA/cm(2) of the high photocurrent density and 0.3-0.6 mu mol/cm(2) of high oxygen and hydrogen gas evolution for 2 h.

Such well-designed hetero-structural hybrids of MoS2/exfoliated MoS2 and MoS2/exfoliated WS2 exhibit dramatically promoted electrochemical activity and high stability. The as-grown MoS2 nanoflakes hybridized on exfoliated MoS2 and WS2 generate abundant active edge sites (rich in basal defects) and unsaturated sulfur atoms, resulting in highly enhanced electrocatalytic performance.

Herein, porous Ni0.85Se nanospheres anchored on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) (Ni0.85Se/RGO) were synthesizedviaa one-step hydrothermal method. Following explorations of the hydrothermal temperature and reaction time, the optimized Ni0.85Se/RGO exhibited extraordinary oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in 1.0 M KOH solution, providing an overpotential as small as 320 mV at a current density of 30 mA cm(-2)and a low Tafel slope of 91 mV dec(-1)for the OER, and an overpotential of 169 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)and a low Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1)for the HER. A current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at 1.64 V and high stability can be obtained upon using Ni0.85Se/RGO as both the cathode and anode for overall water splitting under alkaline conditions; this was attributed to the merits of both the porous structure of Ni0.85Se and the high conductivity of RGO. This work provides a meaningful exploration of the synthesis of 3d-transition-metal-chalcogenide- and carbon-based composite electrocatalystsviaa hydrothermal reaction for water splitting, and provides a general method.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000580644700016

We introduce a convenient anion exchange method for the synthesis of metal sulfide nanoboxes (NBs) from Co, Co-Fe, and Ni-Fe Prussian blue (PB) nanocubes (referred to as Co-PB, Co-Fe-PB, and Ni-Fe-PB NCs) as templates. Analytical characterizations show that anionic exchange processes between S2- and CN- lead to the formation of metal sulfide nanobox heterostructures (referred to as Co-S@PB, Co-Fe-S@PB, and Ni-Fe-S@PB NBs). The Co-Fe-S@PB NBs were characterized in detail with a wide range of analytical techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Furthermore, postcatalytic XAS and XPS studies indicated that the in situ formation of Co-Fe oxides/hydroxides during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) provided active species of the Co-Fe-S@PB NBs, while Fe(CN)(6)(3-) did not play a role in the catalytic activity. Together with their advanced morphology, this resulted in a superior OER performance of the as-prepared Co-Fe-S@PB NBs in comparison with RuO2 and other standards. Co-Fe-S@PB NBs excelled through a low overpotential of 286 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), a small Tafel slope value of 37.84 mV dec(-1), and high durability over the operational period of 33 h at 10 mA/cm(2). Moreover, we applied our strategy to produce new double-layered (Co, Fe)(9)S-8@MoS2 nanoboxes (referred to as Co-Fe-Mo-S NBs). The fine-tuned heterostructured nanoboxes are promising for hybrid electrodes due to their high dual OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity throughout the pH range.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000517351300003

Typical low-cost catalysts only have function for either the ORR (e.g. MnO2) or the OER (e.g. NiCo2O4). To overcome this issue, either a bifunctional catalyst or a bifunctional GDE is needed. Herein, we focus on the development of such a bifunctional GDE. One key is the use of a carefully tuned binder which allows optimal wetting of the GDE. The combination of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) can replace conventional binders such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Using this binder system, two different approaches to combine the two catalysts gamma-MnO2 and NiCo2O4 in one cathode are employed. The first is to mix the ORR catalyst gamma-MnO2 and the OER catalyst NiCo2O4 for integration in the same reactive layer. The second is to build a GDE with two reactive layers which are screen printed on top of each other. The reactive layer facing the air side consists of the ORR catalyst gamma-MnO2 and the binders CMC/SBR. The second reactive layer, facing the electrolyte, consists of the hydrophilic binder CMC and the OER catalyst NiCo2O4. This double-layer design with two different catalyst species results in a better cycling behavior. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their electrocatalytic efficiencies are greatly limited by the weak water dissociation process and unsatisfactory adsorption ability toward reaction intermediates. Herein, novel Mn-doped CoP/Ni(PO3)(2) heterostructure array electrocatalysts which are composed of highly dispersed Ni(PO3)(2) nanoclusters that are tightly wrapped on Mn-doped CoP nanowire arrays are designed. An electrocatalytic performance test suggested that the heterostructure arrays exhibited competitive electrocatalytic performance toward both HER and OER, which needed overpotentials of 116 and 245 mV to drive a current of 10 mA/cm(2), respectively. Encouragingly, a symmetric two electrode water splitting system constructed by the heterostructure arrays required an ultralow cell voltage, suggesting the potential in overall water splitting. First-principles calculations combined with experimental characterization were further performed to clarify the electrocatalytic mechanism. On the one hand, effective doping of Mn atoms could optimize the surface electronic structure of CoP and promote the intrinsic activity. On the other hand, the compact and abundant heterogeneous interface between Ni(PO3)(2) and CoP not only made more active sites exposed but also promoted the effective adsorption of intermediate reaction species on the catalyst surface. This work provides a new strategy to improve electrocatalytic performance of Co-based phosphides through the synergistic coupling of metal-doping and phosphate surface decoration, which will greatly promote the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000848400100001	36007160

A highly efficient route to significantly reduce the cell voltage of electrolytic water splitting is to replace OER with hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) so as to assist hydrogen generation effectively. Here, we report the fabrication of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) embedded with palladium cobalt (PdCo) alloy nanoparticles, via an electrospinning followed by a carbonization treatment. The as-synthesized PdCo-CNFs catalyst displays a superior electro-catalytic activity toward HzOR with a working potential of 258 mV (vs. RHE) to drive a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline solution with 0.2 M hydrazine. Furthermore, the favorable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of this catalyst enables it highly efficient electrolytic hydrogen production, and the two-electrode system using PdCo-CNFs as both the cathode and anode for overall hydrazine splitting is capable of delivering a cell voltage of 0.440 V to attain 10 mA cm(-2), which is 1.496 V less than that for pure water splitting using the same electrodes and even 0.459 V less than the overall hydrazine splitting device using Pt/C//RuO2 as electrocatalysts. This work provides a reliable way for the fabrication of promising bifunctional electrocatalysts to promote energy-saving hydrogen production for practical applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We employed a surface science approach based on advanced spectroscopy and imaging techniques to investigate the evolution of surface stoichiometry and chemical intermediates at each reaction step. During oxygen exposure at increasing temperatures, we observed progressive and subsequent intercalation of oxygen, and selective etching of graphene accompanied by the oxidation of boron.Additionally, by exploiting the O2 etching selectivity towards graphene at 250 degrees C and repeating growth cycles, we obtained in-plane h-BNG layers with controllable compositions and vertically stacked h-BN/Gr heterostructures without the use of consecutive transfer procedures. The growth using a single precursor molecule can be beneficial for the development of versatile atomically thin layers for electronic devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000848346700001

A reaction mechanism in which oxygen and,chlorate formation share an intermediate is proposed. Several compounds were tested for catalytic effects, The addition of chloride salts of cobalt and iridium showed catalytic effects on oxygen formation.

Program and Abstracts								108	108						1980	1980	The electron beam controlled discharge in a rare gas- oxygen-iodine mixture at atmospheric pressure is proposed as a possible means of pumping the O2(1Sigmag)-atomic iodine energy transfer laser. The electron collision rates are calculated with a Boltzmann code which includes superelastic collisions and excitation processes of O2(1Deltag). The time evolution of the species is obtained with a kinetics code (66 reactions). It is shown that population inversion of the I2P1/2-I2P3/2 transition is hardly reached at room temperature.

Here, we reconstruct the origin and evolution of water oxidation at an unprecedented level of detail by studying the phylogeny of all D1 subunits, the main protein coordinating the water oxidizing cluster (Mn4CaO5) of Photosystem II. We show that D1 exists in several forms making well-defined clades, some of which could have evolved before the origin of water oxidation and presenting many atypical characteristics. The most ancient form is found in the genome of Gloeobacter kilaueensis JS-1 and this has a C-terminus with a higher sequence identity to D2 than to any other D1. Two other groups of early evolving D1 correspond to those expressed under prolonged far-red illumination and in darkness. These atypical D1 forms are characterized by a dramatically different Mn4CaO5 binding site and a Photosystem II containing such a site may assemble an unconventional metal cluster. The first D1 forms with a full set of ligands to the Mn4CaO5 cluster are grouped with D1 proteins expressed only under low oxygen concentrations and the latest evolving form is the dominant type of D1 found in all cyanobacteria and plastids. In addition, we show that the plastid ancestor had a D1 more similar to those in early branching Synechococcus. We suggest each one of these forms of D1 originated from transitional forms at different stages toward the innovation and optimization of water oxidation before the last common ancestor of all known cyanobacteria.									66	0	0	0	61	0	67			0737-4038	1537-1719		WOS:000355318400017	25657330

It was found that the propagating reduction/oxidation fronts destroy the lateral homogeneity of the Au adlayer resulting in the development of a "patterned" interface consisting of Au-depleted and Au-enriched areas. The evolution of this reaction-induced morphologically complex interface was examined by varying the reaction conditions, in order to verify the mechanism of the observed Au mass transfer processes. The Au-patterned surface is preserved in oxidation ambient but is rapidly destroyed during reduction. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Some of these mechanistic understandings are inapplicable for more active nanostructured electrocatalysts. Herein, considering the simplest and most typical electrocatalytic process, the hydrogen evolution reaction, an alternative reaction mechanism is proposed for nanomaterials based on the identification of a new intermediate, which differs from those commonly known for the bulk counterparts. In-situ Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical thermal/kinetic measurements were conducted on a series of nanomaterials under different conditions. In high-pH electrolytes with negligible hydronium (H3O+) concentration in bulk phase, massive H3O+ intermediates are found generating on the catalytic surface during water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption processes. These H3O+ intermediates create a unique acid-like local reaction environment on nanostructured catalytic surfaces and cut the energy barrier of the overall reaction. Such phenomena on nanostructured electrocatalysts explain their widely observed anomalously high activity under high-pH conditions.									95	3	0	0	9	0	95			2041-1723			WOS:000492835100014	31653845

Amino acid sequence information obtained from the purified 22 kDa protein was used to construct a probe that was employed to isolate a full-length cDNA clone encoding the 274-residue precursor of the 22 kDa protein. Hydropathy plot analysis predicts the existence of four membrane-spanning helices in the mature protein. The two halves of the approximately 200-residue mature protein show high sequence similarity to each other, suggesting that the psbS gene arose from an internal gene duplication. The 22 kDa protein has some sequence similarity to chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins.									80	1	0	0	72	0	83			0014-5793			WOS:A1992KB08100018	1451805

Herein, we report a facile hydrothermal method to construct a direct Z-scheme CdS/WO3 binary composite for photocatalytic coupling redox reaction, simultaneously producing H-2 and selectively converting aromatic alcohols into aromatic aldehydes in one pot. Compared with bare CdS and WO3, the CdS/WO3 binary composite exhibits significantly enhanced performance for this photocatalytic coupled redox reaction, which is ascribed to the extended light harvesting range, efficient charge carrier separation rate and optimized redox capability of CdS/WO3 composite. Furthermore, the feasibility of converting various aromatic alcohols to corresponding aldehydes coupled with H-2 evolution on the CdS/WO3 photocatalyst is proved and a reasonable reaction mechanism is proposed. It is hoped that this work can provide a new insight into the construction of direct Z-scheme photocatalysts to effectively utilize the photogenerated electrons and holes for photocatalytic coupled redox reaction.

Jason								Effects of PbO2/Pb3O4 ratio alteration for enhanced electrochemical advanced oxidation performance								JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY				301						122277	10.1016/j.jssc.2021.122277		JUN 2021		SEP 2021	2021	PbO2, PbO2/Pb3O4 composite, and Pb3O4 were synthesized respectively via the simple hydrothermal method under different reaction durations (3-48 h). All the prepared samples were used as anode materials to decontaminate methyl orange (MO) to explore the corresponding electrochemical advanced oxidation performance. The detailed experimental designs suggested that the combination of PbO2 and Pb3O4 offered enhanced electrochemical advanced oxidation performance, which was due to possible synergistic effects. XPS results suggest that the content of adsorbed oxygen species (Oads) is obviously higher in PbO2/Pb3O4 composite. It is very likely due to more oxygen vacancies in the crystal structure of PbO2/Pb3O4 composite, which will adsorb more oxygen species, promote charge transfer and provide more electrochemical active surface area to generate oxidizing agents. Besides, the presence of Pb3O4 can suppress the oxygen evolution and improve the accelerated life. Meanwhile, the effects of current density, catalyst loading amount and initial MO concentration on electro-catalysis degradation of MO were explored. Experimental results suggested that MO removal efficiency was 94.3%, the reaction kinetic constant could reach 2.08. 10(-2) min(-1), and COD removal efficiency was 34.2% after 150 min of reaction under optimized conditions: current density was 5 mA cm(-2), catalyst loading amount was 1 mg cm(-2) and initial MO concentration was 50 mg L-1. Furthermore, possible degradation mechanisms of MO was proposed according to the analyzed results obtained from UV -Vis and HPLC-MS.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000684543700002

ABO(3-delta) perovskite oxides have been observed to be potential replacement materials for the high-performing, but low ionic conducting and economically unfavourable Pt and IrO2 water splitting catalysts. In this work increased addition of Sr2+ aliovalent dopant ions into the crystal lattice of Pr1-xSrxFeO3-delta perovskites via A site substitution was seen to drastically improve the electrocatalytic activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline environments. The undoped PrFeO3-delta catalyst was not catalytically active up to 1.70 V against the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), whilst an onset potential of 1.62 V was observed for x = 0.5. Increased strontium content in Pr1-xSrxFeO3-delta was found to cause a reduction in the lattice parameters and crystal volume whilst retaining the orthorhombic Pbnm space group throughout all dopant levels, analysed using the Rietveld method. However, it was noted that the orthorhombic distortion was reduced as more Sr2+ replaced Pr3+. The mechanism for the increased electrocatalytic activity with increased strontium is due to the increasing concentration of oxygen vacancy (delta), leading to increased catalyst site availability, and the increased average oxidation state of Fe cations, consistent with the iodometric titration results. This results in shifting the average d shell eg electron filling further towards unity. X-ray photoelectron spectrum of the O 1s core level also shows the presence of lattice oxide and surface hydroxide/carbonate. This work shows promise in that using the more abundant and more economically friendly material of strontium allows for improved OER catalytic activity in otherwise inactive perovskite catalyst oxides.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2398-4902			WOS:000607305300012

A conductive oxide scale consisting of NiO-rich inner layer and LiFeO2-rich outer layer is formed on the alloy surface after anodic polarization at 0.25V (vs. Ag2SO4/Ag reference electrode) for 40 h. Further prolonging the polarization time leads to a three layered film with layered LiFeO2, NiO and Cu, respectively. The octahedral LiFeO2 and NiO in a size of several microns build a dense outermost layer, providing high stability and excellent catalytic activity for oxygen evolution. Behind the layer, NiO and Cu-rich layers contribute enough high electronic conductivity and good adhesion of the scale. The electrode shows a lower onset potential for O-2 evolution than Pt and much better catalytic activity for O-2 evolution reaction (OER) than SnO2 anode in the melt. To prove the effectiveness of the anode, cobalt powder with high purity was produced using the electrochemically pre-oxidized Ni11Fe10Cu anode in the ternary carbonate eutectic at 650 degrees C.

J	Du, Xiaoqiang; Li, Jiaxin; Zhang, Xiaoshuang								Fe and Cu dual-doped Ni3S4 nanoarrays with less low-valence Ni species for boosting water oxidation reaction								DALTON TRANSACTIONS				51	4			1594	1602		10.1039/d1dt03902d		DEC 2021		JAN 25 2022	2022	Transition metal materials with high efficiency and durable electrocatalytic water splitting activity have attracted widespread attention among scientists. In this work, two cation co-doped Ni3S4 nanoarrays grown on a Ni foam support were firstly synthesized through a typical two step hydrothermal process. Cu and Fe co-doping can regulate the internal electron configuration of the material, thus reducing the activation energy of the active species. Moreover, density functional theory calculations demonstrate that a low Ni2+ amount improves the adsorption energy of H2O, which facilitates the formation and reaction of intermediate species in the water splitting process. The experimental results indicate that the Cu and Fe co-doped Ni3S4 material has superior electrochemical activity for water oxidation reaction to pure Ni3S4, Fe doped Ni3S4 and Cu doped Ni3S4. The Fe-Cu-Ni3S4 material displays a significantly enhanced electrocatalytic performance with low overpotentials of 230 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and 260 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction under alkaline conditions. It's worth noting that when Fe-Cu-Ni3S4 was used as the anode and cathode, a small cell voltage of 1.59 V at 10 mA cm(-2) was obtained to achieve stable overall water splitting. Our work will afford a novel view and guidance for the preparation and application of efficient and environmentally friendly water splitting catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000739861800001	34994364

Here, we address this challenge by employing two nanoengineered electrodes. The 02 electrode consists of a La0.6Sro,Co03_6 (LSC) and Gd,Pr-co-doped CeO2 (CGPO) nanocomposite coating deposited on a Gd-doped CeO2 (CGO) scaffold, and the H2 electrode comprises a Ni/yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrode modified with a nanogranular CGO coating. The resulting cell with an active area of 4 x 4 cm2 exhibits a current density exceeding 1.2 A cm-2 at 1.3 V and 750 C for steam electrolysis while also offering excellent long-term durability at 1 A cm-2 with a high steam-to-hydrogen conversion of-66%. We further unravel the degradation mechanism of the most commonly used Ni/YSZ electrode under these conditions and describe the mitigation of the discussed mechanism on our nanoengineered electrode. Our findings demonstrate the potential of designing robust SOECs by nanoengineering electrodes through infiltration and have significant implications for the practical integration of SOEC technology in the future sustainable energy system.									40	1	0	0	1	0	41			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000477787200038	31242388

Herein, we report an A-site lanthanum doped oxygen excess ruthenate (predominantly Ru5+-ions) double perovskite system, CaLaScRuO6+delta (CLSR), as an excellent photocatalyst for water splitting. The well characterized polycrystalline compound shows canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) behavior due to the existence of disordered Ru-ions at the B-site. Based on density functional theory + U (Hubbard U) calculations, we have estimated various magnetic exchange interactions and found that the ground state is antiferromagnetic in nature which is in perfect agreement with our experimental results. Detailed analysis of the electronic structure further reveals that the present system belongs to the family of charge transfer semiconductors with an energy gap of similar to 0.45 eV. Finally, the material is found to proficiently work for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via visible-light driven water splitting at neutral pH in an ecofriendly manner.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000754008400001	35147154

Nowhere is this versatility more apparent than in the mammalian liver, where P450 monooxygenases catalyze the metabolic clearance of innumerate drugs and other environmental chemicals. In addition to the aromatic and aliphatic hydroxylations, N- and O-dealkylations, and heteroatorn oxidations that are common in drug metabolism, many more unusual reactions catalyzed by P450s have been discovered, including reductions, group transfers and other biotransformations not typically associated with monooxygenases. A research area that shows great potential for development over the next few decades is the directed evolution of P450s as biocatalysts. Mammalian xenobiotic-metabolizing P450s are especially well suited to such protein engineering due to their ability to interact with relatively wide ranges of substrates with marked differences in structure and physicochernical properties. Typical characteristics, such as the low turnover rates and poor coupling seen during the metabolism of xenobiotics, as well as the enzyme specificity towards particular substrates and reactions, can be improved by directed evolution. This mini-review will cover the fundamental enabling technologies required to successfully engineer P450s, examine the work done to date on the directed evolution of mammalian forms, and provide a perspective on what will be required for the successful implementation of engineered enzymes.

The obtained Co3O4/PPy hybrid material shows improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances, specifically, a larger discharge/charge capacity of 3585/2784 mAh g(-1), respectively, at a current density of 100 mA g(-1), and lower recharge overpotential, as well as better rate capability compared to pristine PPy cathode. Rotating disk electrode measurements and electrocatalytic testing, as well as characterization after cycling, shows that the pristine PPy can act as a good support and good ORR catalyst, but only as a poor OER catalyst, with Li2O2 and Li2CO3 as its main discharge products, while the nanofibrous Co3O4/PPy hybrid can catalyze reversible Li2O2 formation and decomposition in Li-O-2 batteries. The improved performance is attributed to the synergistic effects from the PPy matrix with its highly conductive 3D nanoweb structure and the Co3O4 nanoparticles with intrinsically high catalytic activity.									30	5	0	0	0	0	32			2196-7350			WOS:000380054400009

However, the efficiency of Li-air batteries is limited by the large cathodic overpotential for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This article demonstrates that a binary hydroxide catalyst composed of iron (Fe) and cobalt (Co) supported on mesoporous carbon material such as CMK-3 can address this problem with a non-aqueous electrolyte of 1M LiTFSI in TEGDME. The mesoporous Co(OH)(2)-Fe(OH)(2)/CMK-3 catalyst showed remarkable overpotential reduction and achieved a fairly stable cyclability for 20 cycles at 0.2 mA/g compared with the carbon black support. Moreover, the physical analysis confirms that the feature of mesoporous structure is beneficial to the diffusion of oxygen during the discharge process and the decomposition of discharge products during the charge process.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1452-3981			WOS:000366177700015

FeCo2S4/N-S-rGO was prepared by in situ homogeneous growth of bimetallic sulfide FeCo2S4 on N, S-doped reduced graphene oxide. FeCo2S4/N-S-rGO exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.89 V for ORR and an overpotential of 0.26 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, showing significantly bifunctional activity superior to Pt/C (0.85 V) and RuO2 (0.41 V). Moreover, the FeCo2S4/N-S-rGO assembled ZAB shows a superior specific capacity and a power density of 259.13 mW cm(-2). It is demonstrated that the interfacial electron redistribution between FeCo2S4 nanoparticles and heteroatom-doped rGO matrix can efficiently improve the electrochemical performance of the catalyst. The results provide new insights into the preparation of high-capability composite catalysts combining transition metal sulfides with carbon materials for applications in ZABs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000856289400001

To achieve high round-trip efficiency, highly efficient and durable air electrode materials are needed to minimize energy loss associated with oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here we report a bifunctional air electrode material, PrBa0.9Co1.96Nb0.04O5+delta, demonstrating outstanding electrochemical performance (e.g., achieving peak power densities of over 1.5 and 1 W cm-2, respectively, for Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 and BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3-delta based fuel cells at 600 degrees C) while maintaining excellent stability (e.g., having a degradation rate of 40 mV per 1,000 h for H2O electrolysis cells). The excellent property of the new electrode is attributed to the improved stability from Nb doping and the enhanced electrocatalytic activity from tuning Ba deficiency, as confirmed by experimental results and computational analysis.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000701949000004

Formation of this hierarchical structure is dependent on the reaction duration. Interestingly, different hierarchical structures show different catalytic activities. After a 12 hour reaction, tertiary structures of Pt are formed, which can act as outstanding catalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The onset potential of this dendrite-like Pt catalyst for the HER in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution is 15 mV, which outperforms that of commercial Pt/C (30 mV). Moreover, it shows significantly improved stability for HER as the polarization curve after 10 000 cycles retains a similar performance as in the initial test; this results in a loss of only 2.6% of its initial current density at an overpotential of 0.05 V. The distinct hierarchical dendrite-like structures are maintained after cycling and current-time tests, which can be responsible for the excellent performance of this catalyst.									35	0	0	0	2	0	35			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431621700084

Here, we report the design and synthesis of nanocomposite based on carbon quantum dots (CQDs), SnO2 and CO3O4 (CQDs/SnO2-Co3O4) as the electrocatalyst for highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In alkaline media, the complex exhibited high electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability, which was better than either pristine Co3O4 or SnO2-Co3O4 composite. Moreover, the CQDs/SnO2-Co3O4 with a molar ratio of Sn:Co at 1:3 revealed the highest catalytic activity toward OER among different molar ratios of CQDs/SnO2-Co3O4 composites. Experimental results indicated that the Co atoms were considered as the active centre, the nano-sized SnO2 enhanced electronic conductivity and the insoluble CQDs layer on the surface effectively protected the catalyst, thus the composite structure resulted in the excellent electrocatalytic activity and high stability.

The penta-coordinated Fe-N-C with an augmented activity toward the oxygen reduction has been regarded as one of the promising candidates to replace platinum-based ORR catalysts. However, the lack of pertinent fundamental understanding hinders further optimizing the catalytic activity of such catalysts. Herein, through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically investigated the catalytic activity and ligand/metal coordination effects of 17 penta-coordinated Fe-N-C catalysts (labeled as FeNC-Xs, X denotes axial ligand). Our results not only show the theoretical overpotential of FeNC-Xs is lower than that of conventional tetra-coordinated Fe-N-C catalysts (labeled as FeNC), verifying the preeminent performance of FeNC-Xs, but also further indicate that the axial coordination effect of X ligands can decrease the orbital hybridization of Fe active center with ORR-relevant intermediates, sequentially accelerating the ORR. More importantly, we reveal that the catalytic activity of FeNC-Xs increases with a decreased electronegativity of X ligands, which can be utilized to describe the axial coordination effect for FeNC-Xs. These findings can deeply advance the understanding of penta-coordinated iron-nitrogen-carbon catalysts, which provide timely guidelines for designing optimum Fe-N-C based catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000790699500004		
J	Wang, Peicao; Sun, Hongjuan; Peng, Tongjiang								The Evolution Rule of Three-Dimensional Structures of Graphite During Oxidation								NANO				10	1			126	133						2015	2015	The graphite oxidation samples with dierent degrees of oxidation were prepared from natural flake graphite via a modified Hummers method with controlled addition of KMnO4. The evolution of oxygen-containing functional groups was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The evolution rule of threedimensional (3D) graphite structures during oxidation has been verified via X-ray diffraction (XRD). Experimental results show that the evolution of the interplanar spacing of samples during oxidation can be approximately divided into four stages. When the dosage of KMnO4 is 0.5 g per 1 g of graphite (g/g), a graphite intercalation compound (GIC) is formed through intercalating reactions, and a slight increase is observed in the values of d100 and d110, suggesting that the π-π interactions which decrease the length of carbon–carbon bonds were partially disrupted. Adding additional KMnO4 initiates the second stage, in which GIC begins to oxidize. The insertion of oxygen-containing functional groups in the graphene basal plane leads to dramatic changes in the values of d100 and d110. The d100 is greatly reduced while d110 increases slightly. These trends are attributed to the fact that the basal plane is stretched during the oxidation process. Further addition of KMnO4 in the third stage leads to relatively small increases in the values of d100 and d110. This result is consistent with the evolution rule of hydroxyl groups. In this research, the evolution rule of the value of d001 is also clearly demonstrated. When the concentration of KMnO4 is not more than 3.0 g/g, the value of products d001 keeps gradually increasing, indicating that oxygen-containing groups continue to form bonds with carbons in the basal plane, and that additional water molecules are adsorbed between the layers of the samples. All the interplanar spacing values (d001, d100 and d110) are reduced significantly in the fourth stage, when the amount of KMnO4 added up to 4.0 g/g. FT-IR and XPS analyses demonstrate that the decrease in the values of d100 and d110 is due to a reduction in the content of external hydroxyl groups. The change in d001 is attributed to the partial release of water molecules confined in the interlayer spaces between adjacent sheets are partly released.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1793-2920			KJD:ART001965851

VMnGa(0.1) oxide sample exhibits the highest CO conversion and olefins space-time yield, while the other ternary metal oxides show poor CO conversion or low selectivity. The introduction of suitable amount of V into MnGa oxide formed Mn2VO4 spinel structure. VMnGa(0.1) pos-sesses high amounts of desorbed CO, which is due to the formation of more oxygen vacancies on metal oxide surface. The structure evolution of VMnGa(0.1) in pretreatment atmosphere of H2 and syngas (H2/CO=2:1) was studied and the catalytic performance for STO was compared; moreover, the structure-activity and reaction intermediate during the reaction were revealed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000870690200002

However, it requires an electrocatalyst with high bifunctionalactivity in seawater. In this work, a carbon electrocatalyst is obtained via one-steppyrolysis of the shell waste of cranberry beans. During the oxygen reduction reaction(ORR) in seawater electrolyte, the cranberry bean shell-derived carbon catalystexhibits an ORR onset potential of 0.69 V vs RHE and an ORR saturating currentdensity of 2.93 mA cm-2, which are promising compared to the ORR performanceof Pt/C in seawater electrolyte (0.78 V vs RHE and 3.15 mA cm-2). During OER(oxygen evolution reaction) in seawater electrolyte, the carbon catalyst shows anoverpotential of 582 mV at 5 mA cm-2, 35 mV smaller than the commercial Ir/Ccatalyst (617 mV). Furthermore, when the catalyst is applied to the zinc-air batterywith seawater electrolyte, the cell is able to exhibit discharge and charge voltages of0.93 and 2.2 V, respectively, which are stable for more than 120 cycles of the cyclingtest.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and scanning Auger microscopy revealed that metallic silver (Ag) and cobalt (oxy)hydroxide (CoOx(OH)(y)) particles were selectively deposited onto the {010} and {110} facets, respectively, regardless of the cocatalyst amount. By contrast, the nickel (oxy)hydroxide (NiOx(OH)(y)) photodeposition depends on the nickel precursor amount with an unprecedented selectivity for 0.1 wt % NiOx(OH)(y)/BiVO4 with a preferential deposition onto the {010} facets and the edges between the {110} facets. Moreover, these noble metal-free heterostructures led to remarkable photocatalytic properties for rhodamine B photodecomposition and sacrificial water oxidation reactions. For instance, 0.2 wt % CoOx(OH)(y)/BiVO4 led to one of the highest oxygen evolution rates, i.e., 1538 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), ever described which is ten times higher than that found for bare BiVO4. The selective deposition of cobalt (oxy)hydroxide species onto the more electron-deficient facet of truncated bipyramidal monoclinic BiVO4 particles favors photogenerated charge carrier separation and therefore plays a key role for efficient photochemical oxygen evolution.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000596876400033	33207876

However, little information is available regarding the existence of rhythmic behaviors in prokaryotes other than cyanobacteria. Here we report biological rhythms of gene expression in a purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides by using a luciferase reporter gene system. Self-bioluminescent strains of Rb. sphaeroides were constructed, which produced a bacterial luciferase and its substrate, a long chain fatty aldehyde, to sustain the luminescence reaction. After being subjected to a temperature or light entrainment regime, the reporter strains with the luciferase genes driven by an upstream endogenous promoter expressed self-sustained rhythmicity in the constant free-running period. The rhythms were controlled by oxygen and exhibited a circadian period of 20.5 h under aerobic conditions and an ultradian period of 10.6-12.7 h under anaerobic conditions. The data suggest a novel endogenous oscillation mechanism in purple photosynthetic bacteria. Elucidation of the clock-like behavior in purple bacteria has implications in understanding the origin and evolution of circadian rhythms. (C) 2005 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

The uniform RuO2-coating layer and ordered mesopores ensure high electrical conductivity and facilitate ion diffusion, respectively, which provide enough active sites for the ORR/OER; the macro-sized void spaces between carbon nanofibers not only play the role of a buffer in the reactions, but also facilitate oxygen transfer; the uniform RuO2-coating layer ensures catalytic activity and selectivity for catalyzing reactions (ORR and OER), especially the OER. As a result, this Zn-air battery exhibits much improved electrochemical performance, including relatively low overpotentials, long cycle life and superior rate capability.									53	3	0	0	0	0	55			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000374862600007

Each step exhibits a positive impact on catalyst activity. In acid media, etching of the silica template is the major contributor to the enhancement of the half-wave potential, as the ORR active sites formed during the first pyrolysis become more accessible. Further processing steps result even in higher accessibility and utilization of the 4e - transfer sites. In alkaline media, the second pyrolysis is a critical step that favors the complete reduction of oxygen to water, as the peroxide production is significantly diminished. The large heterogeneity in the porosity at each synthesis step indicates that this parameter needs to be further studied to attain better control of the morphology of the PGM-free catalyst, as it is an important factor that contributes to the active site utilization. The acid etching and second pyrolysis increase the meso- and macroporosity. Understanding the effects of each of the synthesis steps on the chemical composition, morphology and ORR activity of the PGM-free catalyst provides the necessary feedback for the design of synthetic schemes that increase the catalysts' performance.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			2574-0962			WOS:000483434700010		
J	Thiere, Alexandra; Bombach, Hartmut; Stelter, Michael								The Behavior of Ruthenium in Copper Electrowinning								METALS				12	8					1260	10.3390/met12081260				AUG 2022	2022	The recycling of material containing precious metals can lead to the entry of ruthenium into the copper electrowinning process, by so far unknown effects. There, ruthenium is oxidized to highly volatile ruthenium tetroxide. In order to avoid ruthenium losses during electrolysis, the oxidation behavior of ruthenium in copper electrowinning was investigated by testing different oxygen overvoltages using lead alloy and diamond anodes. Furthermore, the temperature and the current density were varied to investigate a possible chemical or electrochemical reaction. The results of the study show that ruthenium is not directly electrochemically oxidized to ruthenium tetroxide at the anode. Especially at anodes with high oxygen overvoltage, the formation of other oxidants occurs parallel to the oxygen evolution in the electrolyte. These oxidants oxidize ruthenium compounds to highly volatile ruthenium tetroxide by chemical reactions. These reactions depend mainly on temperature; the formation of the active oxidants depends on the anodic potential. To avoid ruthenium losses in the copper electrowinning process, anodes with a low anodic potential should be used at low electrolyte temperatures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2075-4701		WOS:000846626400001

The purpose of this study is to set up new and reproducible accelerated red wine ageing tests and identify chemical oxidation or ageing molecular markers. Three accelerated and reproducible ageing tests were developed: a heat test (60 degrees C); an enzymatic test (laccase test; a chemical test (hydrogen peroxide test). Depending on the test, oxygen consumption was significantly different. For a young wine (2018), the oxygen consumption rate moved from 2.40 ppm center dot h(-1)for the heat test to 3.33 ppm center dot h(-1)for the enzymatic test and 2.86 ppm center dot h(-1)for the chemical test. Once applied to two other vintages (2010 and 2014) from the same winery, the tests revealed different comportments corresponding to wine natural evolution. High resolution UPLC-MS was performed on forced ageing samples and compared to naturally aged red wines. Specific oxidation or ageing ion markers were found with significant differences between tests, revealing the specificity of each test and different possible molecular pathways involved. The hydrogen peroxide test seems to be closer to natural oxidation with an important decrease in absorbance at 520 nm and similar molecular ion variations for [M+H](+)= 291, 331, 347, 493, 535, 581, 639 Da.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5				2076-3921		WOS:000564840600001	32722307

In photosystem II (PSII), the Mn4CaO5 cluster adopts a distorted coordination geometry and every two octahedra are linked by di-mu-oxo (edge-shared) or mono-mu-oxo (corner-shared) bridges, which is recognized as a critical structure motif for catalytic water oxidation. These structural features provide guidance on the design and synthesis of new water oxidation catalysts. Herein we synthesized a new layered organic cobalt phosphonate crystal, Co-3(O3PCH2-NC4H7-CO2)(2)center dot 4H(2)O (1) and demonstrate it as a heterogeneous catalyst for water oxidation. Its catalytic activity was compared to those of cobalt phosphonates with different structures (2-4) in terms of O-2 evolution rate and O-2 yield under the same reaction conditions. The compound with both mono-and di-m-oxo bridged octahedral cobalt displays superior catalytic activity. In contrast, the presence of only mono-m-oxo bridged cobalt in the structure results in lower O-2 yield and O-2 evolution rate. Further structural analysis reveals that the presence of a longer Co-N bond induces a distorted dissymmetry coordination geometry, and consequently facilitates water oxidation. These results provide important insight into the design of water oxidation catalysts.									69	5	0	0	1	0	70			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000349616900009

In this study, hexagonal Co3O4 nanoplatelets coated with MnO2 were synthesized as bifunctional catalysts for Li-O-2 batteries. The oxygen reduction reaction catalyst (MnO2) was closely integrated on the surface of the oxygen evolution reaction catalyst (hexagonal Co3O4) so that this hetero-structured catalyst (HSC) hybrid would show bifunctional catalytic activity in Li-O-2 batteries. A facile synthesis route was developed to form a unique HSC structure, with {111} facet-exposed Co3O4 decorated with perpendicularly arranged MnO2 flakes. The catalytic activity of the HSCs was controlled by tuning the ratio of Co to Mn (the ratio of OER to ORB. catalysts) in the hybrids. With the optimized Co3O4-to-MnO2 ratio of 5:3, a Li-O-2 cell containing the HSC showed remarkably enhanced electrochemical performance, including discharge capacity, energy efficiency, and especially cycle performance, compared to cells with a monofunctional catalyst and a powder mixture of Co3O4 and MnO2. The results demonstrate the feasibility of reversible Li-O-2 batteries with bifunctional catalyst hybrids.									47	4	0	0	1	0	48			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000418990700030

This work confirms that in pure water, hydrogen peroxide is only produced in the presence of molecular oxygen. Mechanistic schemes explain these findings and confirm earlier statements that recombination of hydroxyl radicals is kinetically disfavoured. In agreement with other recent publications, this work confirms that enhanced hydrogen peroxide production takes place upon VUV irradiation of aqueous solutions of organic compounds. For these investigations, methanol was chosen as an organic model compound. During photolyses, hydrogen peroxide, dissolved molecular oxygen, pH-value of the reaction system, methanol and its products of oxidative degradation were analyzed, and kinetic studies were undertaken to explain the evolution of the concentrations of these components.									20	0	0	0	9	0	20			1474-905X	1474-9092		WOS:000304412100026	22430846

However, useful voltammetric waves can be obtained at noble metal electrodes modified by thin films of electrodeposited, bismuth(V)-doped lead dioxide (Bi-PbO2). Voltammetric data for anodic deposition with cathodic stripping of Bi-PbO2 films are examined for gold rotated disk electrodes in 1.0 M HClO4 containing Pb2+ with Bi3+. Evidence is shown that ultra-thin films (< ca. 1-mu-m) of a reduced oxide, designated "Bi-PbO", remain on the Au substrate when thick Bi-PbO2 films (> ca. 10-mu-m) are voltammetrically stripped under rapid potential scan. The ultra-thin films possess a larger atomic ratio of Bi/Pb than the original thicker films and, following reoxidation to Bi-PbO2, they display greater catalytic activity. The effect is interpreted on the basis of mediation of the oxygen-transfer step.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			0003-2670			WOS:A1991FY56600008

The results demonstrate that Fe2O3 is reduced to FeO, Fe3O4, and a limited amount of Fe after the Fe-based oxygen carrier (OC) reacted with the coal tar. The gas products mainly consisted of H-2 and CO, and transmission electron microscopy shows that the particle sizes of CB were in decent agreement with the simulation and the size of a single carbon sphere was approximately 40 nm. There were regular changes of the OC particle sizes during the redox process, and the OC particle size was reducing when the oxygen was releasing and was increasing when the oxygen was gaining. Therefore, the OC particle size variation contributes a suitable method to characterize the evolution of the oxygen carrying capacity. The simulations reveal the mechanisms of the chemical looping pyrolysis of coal tar with the reaction models.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000445711700108

This enzyme is present in all domains of life in different forms (III, II, and I) and its origin goes back to 3500 Myr, when the atmosphere was anoxygenic. However, the RuBisCO active site also catalyzes oxygenation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, therefore, the development of oxygenic photosynthesis and the subsequent oxygen-rich atmosphere promoted the appearance of CO2 concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) and/or the evolution of a more CO2-specific RuBisCO enzyme. The wide variability in RuBisCO kinetic traits of extant organisms reveals a history of adaptation to the prevailing CO2/O-2 concentrations and the thermal environment throughout evolution. Notable differences in the kinetic parameters are found among the different forms of RuBisCO, but the differences are also associated with the presence and type of CCMs within each form, indicative of co-evolution of RuBisCO and CCMs. Trade-offs between RuBisCO kinetic traits vary among the RuBisCO forms and also among phylogenetic groups within the same form. These results suggest that different biochemical and structural constraints have operated on each type of RuBisCO during evolution, probably reflecting different environmental selective pressures. In a similar way, variations in carbon isotopic fractionation of the enzyme point to significant differences in its relationship to the CO2 specificity among different RuBisCO forms. A deeper knowledge of the natural variability of RuBisCO catalytic traits and the chemical mechanism of RuBisCO carboxylation and oxygenation reactions raises the possibility of finding unrevealed landscapes in RuBisCO evolution.									41	0	0	0	31	0	41			0960-7412	1365-313X		WOS:000505090400001	31820505

The 3 wt% RGO/WO3 heterojunctions display significantly the increase of O-2 production, which is 3.9 and 7.3 times higher than those of WO3 nanoplates with preferential (0 0 2) facets and commercial WO3. The strategy could provide an efficient approach for the fabrication of graphene-based metal oxide hybrids with exposed facets towards high photocatalytic performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Practical realization of solar-driven synthesis of hydrogen and oxygen integrating light absorption and electrolysis of water has been challenging because of (1) the limited stability of good photovoltaic materials under the required electrochemical conditions, and (2) photovoltaic efficiency losses due to light absorption by catalysts, the electrolyte, and generated bubbles, or reflection at their various interfaces. Herein, we evaluate a novel integrated solar water splitting architecture using efficient silicon heterojunction photovoltaic cells that avoids such losses and exhibits a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency in excess of 10%. Series-connected silicon Heterojunction with Intrinsic Thin layer (HIT) cells generate sufficient photovoltage for unassisted water splitting, with one of the cells acting as the photocathode. Platinum is deposited on the back (dark) junction of this HIT cell as the catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The photocathode is protected from corrosion by a TiO2 layer deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) interposed between the HIT cell and the Pt, enabling stable operation for >120 hours. Combined with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts deposited on a porous metal dark anode, these PEC's achieve stable water splitting with a record high STH efficiency for an integrated silicon photosynthesis device.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			INSPEC:20267887

In this study, we have prepared supported Pd on SiO2, in which conductive carbon was used by coprecipitation method Pd/SiO2@C or physically mixed Pd/SiO2.Pd/SiO2@C (10 wt%) owned more outstanding catalytic activity, preferable durability, and stronger methanol tolerance capability in alkaline solution for ORR, which compared with commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) and Pd/C catalysts. We analyzed the morphology and electronic properties of the catalyst by SEM, TEM, XRD and XPS. It was found that the introduction of SiO2 changed the electronic structure of palladium, resulting in the production of electron-rich Pd NPs, which was further confirmed by density functional theory calculations. Therefore, the introducing a small amount of SiO2 plays a vital role in facilitating the ORR activity of Pd-based catalysts, which may be a new strategy to design new ORR catalysts and replace Pt-based catalysts in fuel.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000459333500019

Here, an absorption-reaction method is used to prepare a zeolitic imidazolate framework coated commercial carbon, and the pyrolysis of such material brings about impressive ORR activities and stabilities with large diffusion-limited current density, half-wave potential, and no obvious decay after 10 000 cyclic voltammetry cycles, which is even better than that of the commercial Pt/C catalysts. The absorption-reaction method is realized by simply soaking the commercial carbon black sequentially in Co(NO3)(2) and 2-methylimidazole solutions at ambient conditions. The detailed analysis on such carbon materials reveals that both Co and N are essential to activities, even the amount of N and Co species is very low. The reduction of raw materials and simplified handling procedures result in well-controlled costs in applications.									81	9	0	0	3	0	82			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000405410700032	28470970

The release characteristic and evolution behavior of gaseous products and bio-char in different conditions were analyzed to evaluate the effects of CLG and microwave pretreatment. The results indicated that the gas production of CLG was higher than that of SiO2:Chlorella, and it would be higher after microwave pretreatment.

But more CO, CO2, and CH4 were produced. Microwave pretreatment was helpful for reducing the degrees of hydrogen-rich, aliphatic structure, aromatization, and oxygen-rich in char. Moreover, microwave pretreatment promoted the reduction of C-O, CO, and CC compounds. However, CO increased by 55.63%, and CO2 decreased by 2.31% in this condition. Therefore, microwave pretreatment was beneficial to CLG reaction.									8	1	0	0	2	0	9			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000459744200024

Photocatalysts were prepared with various amounts of RGO (0-30 wt.% with respect to CdS) by a hydrothermal method. A photocatalyst containing 20 wt.% RGO (CdS-G2) showed maximum activity, and the amount of H2O2 produced (128 mu M) was almost five times higher than that produced by CdS nanoparticles (27 mu M) after 12 h sunlight irradiation. The results clearly revealed that the photocatalytic reaction mainly proceeds by two electron reduction of oxygen rather than water oxidation on the catalyst surface. The effects of reaction temperature and pH on the production of H2O2 were also investigated. We found that the production of H2O2 was enhanced at lower temperature and pH. The concentration of H2O2 reached to 164 and 156 mu M with CdS-G2 at 10 degrees C and 2, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The electro-deoxygenation (EDO) cell achieves O-2 removal by leveraging the high overpotential of oxygen evolution on activated carbon and its propensity to oxidize under anodic polarization in aqueous solution: oxygen is reduced at the cathode while water is oxidized and incorporated into surface oxide functional groups at the anode, effectively sequestering dissolved oxygen. Polarized electrodes promote the two-step reduction of DO resulting in some residual hydrogen peroxide in the effluent, which may be beneficial for certain applications. A subsequent cell is modified with Ni cathodes downstream to reduce all H2O2 to water for particularly sensitive applications; in this cell >99% of incoming DO could be removed to lower than 10 ppb. EDO cells, which currently employ sacrificial anodes, can deaerate 30 L g(anode)(-1) of water at an energy consumption of 1 kWh per 10,000 L; carbon anode replacement can recharge the cell.

In this work, Co9S8 nanoparticles embedded in N/S dual-doped hollow and porous carbon nanofibers (Co9S8-NSHPCNF) are prepared via the continuous coaxial electrospinning technology followed by pre-oxidation and carbonization treatment. Attributed to synergistic effects between the Co9S8 nanoparticles and NSHPCNF, higher specific surface area, hollow and porous structure, the doping of N and S and better electrical conductivity, the Co9S8-NSHPCNF bifunctional catalysts exhibit preferable performance toward ORR (E-1/2 = 0.82 V) and OER (E-j - 10 ma(-2) = 1.58 V) compared to precious metal-based catalysts. In addition, when being used as a cathode catalyst in liquid zinc-air battery, Co9S8-NSHPCNF displays excellent durability. An all solid-state zinc-air battery with Co9S8-NSHPCNF is also fabricated and presents superb charge and discharge cycling performance.									80	4	0	0	2	0	80			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000521513300071

In a solution-phase synthesis of PtNi nanoparticles, we show that a mixture of surfactants results in surface functionalization, which in turn controls the morphological evolution of nanoparticles. The nanoparticles exhibited complex chemical growth zoning, rich in Pt geometric topologies, which varied as a function of surfactant mixture. Compositional mapping, using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), highlights core-shell structures (similar to 1 nm Pt coating thickness) with edge-vertex Pt-enrichment and Ni-rich faces. These core-shell Ni-Pt nanoparticles demonstrated enhanced activities toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to commercial Pt/C, even after extended potential cycles (5000). Our synthetic approach, which utilizes the surfactants' array of distinct functional groups, offers new avenues toward the formation of concentric core-shell structures with multifaceted topologies. These materials show considerable promise as electrocatalysts.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2574-0970			WOS:000545689000080

Ozone concentration is determined by means of direct UV spectroscopy and the effects of Joule heating and ozone decomposition on the electrodes are analysed for different discharge gaps. The numerical model combines the physical processes in the corona discharge with the chemistry of ozone formation and destruction. The chemical kinetics model and the electrical model are coupled through Poisson's equation, and the current-voltage (CV) characteristic measured in experiments is used as input data to the numerical simulation. The numerical model is able to predict the radial distributions of electrons, ions, atoms and molecules for each applied voltage of the CV characteristic. In particular, the evolution of ozone density inside the discharge cell has been investigated as a function of current intensity and applied voltage.									26	3	0	0	4	0	28			0022-3727			WOS:000259441800045

However, the exploration to tailor these structures is still insufficient for two-dimensional (2D) catalysts. Herein, a facile phosphine (PH3) and hydrogen (H-2) vapor-assisted phase engineering strategy is proposed to successfully achieve the controllable conversion of 2D MoO2 nanosheet precursor into 2D porous MoP/MoO2 heterojunction nanosheets for HER. The holey lamellar properties and plentiful interfaces between 2D MoP and MoO2 domains are intuitively confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images. The porous MoP/MoO2 nanosheets exhibit outstanding HER activity with low overpotentials of 90 +/- 1 and 79 +/- 1 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that both P and Mo sites located on the wall of the nanopores at the interface region optimize the hydrogen binding energy, thereby accelerating the HER kinetics.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000725013900006

Here, we develop an adsorption-low temperature pyrolysis method for facilely preparing uniformly dispersed Ru nanoparticles on carbon (Ru/C) with an outstanding catalytic property toward hydrogen generation from both electrochemical water splitting and AB hydrolysis. The experimental results indicate that the Ru/C synthesized by calcination at 300 degrees C (Ru/C-300) exhibits the highest catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in basic solution, which requires an overpotential of only 14 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Additionally, this catalyst also displays high activity and reusability toward hydrogen evolution through AB hydrolysis, leading to a high turnover frequency of 643 mol H-2 (min mol(Ru))(-1). Moreover, the Ru/C-300 shows excellent stability and reusability for both reactions. The adsorption-low temperature calcination strategy ensures that the small Ru nanoparticles are confined onto the carbon matrix, which can provide abundant highly reactive surface sites. It is discovered that the excellent catalytic activity of Ru/C depends largely on the size and dispersion of Ru nanoparticles as well as on their chemical states. This work may provide a facile and environmentally friendly strategy for preparing uniformly distributed metal nanocatalysts with high catalytic efficiencies for HER and AB hydrolysis.									73	4	0	0	0	0	73			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000443116700041

Characterizing Electrocatalysts with Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy								INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH				57	22			7431	7440		10.1021/acs.iecr.8b00922				JUN 6 2018	2018	Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is a "non-contact" scanning probe technique capable of providing chemical and/or topographic information about surfaces immersed in a solution. It is a powerful in situ and operando tool for obtaining insights into electrocatalytic rates and mechanisms. Herein, examples are given on how SECM can be used to characterize (1) hydrogen oxidation reaction electrocatalysts for fuel-cell applications, (2) oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts for water splitting applications, and (3) electrochemical CO2-reducing catalysts. We also report a new operando method of SECM in which we can separate electrochemical reduction or cO(2) to in aqueous media from parasitic hydrogen evolution as a function or applied potential. Understanding hydrogen evolution suppression is a major challenge in the intelligent design of CO2-reducing electrocatalysts. Via this multireactional SECM technique, we observed the optimal potential window for electrochemically reducing CO2 to CO with high selectivity. At potentials lower than this optimal window, CO2 reduction rates were small, but at potentials higher than this optimal window, water reduction to H-2 dominated the electrochemical conversions. This observation is something that traditional voltammetry alone is not able to resolve. We anticipate that a wider adoption of SECM by the catalysis community will allow for the operando characterization of many types of catalysts, and holds the potential to provide unprecedented insights into the composition/activity and structure/activity relationships.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			0888-5885			WOS:000434895300012

An efficient Ti/SnO2-Sb2O5-IrO2-RuO2 electrode was prepared by Pechini method and employed as the anode for electrochemical degradation of selected pharmaceuticals (i.e., ibuprofen, atenolol, and carbamazepine). Compared its counterparts, Ti/SnO2-Sb2O5-IrO2-RuO2 exhibited higher oxygen evolution potential, lower chlorine evolution potential, larger active area, and higher stability. Unlike the negligible effect of solution pH from 4.0 to 10.0, increasing current density favored the target pollutants and COD removal. The removal of IBU was mainly attributed to the reaction with OH, the contribution of which to IBU removal was enhanced with increasing current density. In contrast to IBU, the removal of ATEN and CBZ was mainly ascribed to the reaction with selective radical chlorine species (RCS) mainly in the form of Cl, which was produced from direct oxidation of Cl- or indirect oxidation by OH. It was found that the removal of ATEN and CBZ was less affected by dissolved organic matter (DOM) than that of IBU in municipal effluent. This study demonstrates that Ti/SnO2-Sb-RuO2-IrO2 is an attractive electrode for the destruction of pharmaceutical contaminants.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000589640900001

Herein, the well-defined bimetallic oxyhalide PbBiO2Br atomic layers with tunable oxygen vacancies (OVs) concentrations have been synthesized and investigated to reveal the role of OVs for photocatalytic CO2 conversion. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed that the rich oxygen vacancies (ROV) in PbBiO2Br atomic layers facilitated the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the internal structure to surface and prolonged their lifetime on the surface OVs. PbBiO2Br atomic layers with ROV demonstrated superior CO2 reduction performance with enhanced CO evolution rate of 4.58 mu mol g h(-1) in water under visible light irradiation, which was 2.05 and 10.90 times higher than that of deficient oxygen vacancies (DOV) PbBiO2Br atomic layers and bulk PbBiO2Br, respectively. Intermediate products of CO2 conversion were investigated by in-situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and the corresponding reaction mechanism was proposed.									53	3	0	0	6	0	54			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000552015900017

The longest life was realized by preparation of intermediate layer with uniform thickness by brush-coating of H(2)IrCl(6)-SnCl(4) butanol solution and subsequent calcination. The anode with the intermediate layer prepared from 0.04 M H(2)IrCl(6)-0.06 M SnCl(4) butanol solution showed the best performance, that is, the oxygen evolution efficiency higher than 99.8% for more than 4300 h in the electrolysis of 0.5 M NaCl solution of pH 1 at the current density of 1000 Am(-2). An increase in SnCl(4) concentration decreased the viscosity of the coating solution with a consequent enhancement of uniformity of the intermediate layer but decreased the thickness of the intermediate layer acting as a barrier to prevent oxidation of titanium. Thus, the best performance was attained at an intermediate SnCl(4) concentration. The growth of an oxide layer on titanium during electrolysis occurred and was found by the potential increase.

Systematic parameter variations are evaluated to disentangle the dependencies of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) signatures in H-2/H-2 mode. We introduce a new CO recovery protocol for both electrodes that enables to accurately characterize the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics. Then, we demonstrate that a compact Tafel kinetics law captures the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics for a full factorial grid of conditions, covering a wide range of relative humidities (rH), temperatures, oxygen partial pressures and current densities. This yields the characteristic activation energy and effective reaction order, and we reconcile models that make different assumptions regarding the rH dependency. Moreover, we analyze O-2 transport contributions by steady-state and transient limiting current techniques and heliox measurements. Although the rising uncertainty of loss corrections at high current densities makes it impossible to unambiguously identify an intrinsic potential-dependent change of the Tafel slope, our data support that such effect needs not be considered for steady-state cathodic half-cell potentials above 0.8 V.

The instability of these ecosystems greatly depends on the nutrients availability and on the meteorological and climatic conditions. The variation of these factors can produce fast evolution of dystrophic phenomena into anoxis crises: that is the depletion of oxygen in the water column that, Starting from localized areas, can interest all the basin. Due to these modifications, great changes can be observed in the composition of the biotic community. These processes may be described by a reaction-diffusion system based on the following biological hypotheses:(i) the primary production is assumed to be constant (in particular of macrophytes),(ii) the model consists of the balance equations of some chemical species, in the water column and in the sediment at the bottom of the water,(iii) a simplified formalization of reaction kinetics.The model presented can be used to evaluate the influence of environmental factors, such as temperature, wind, and lighting on the level of oxygen, and it is described by a system of semilinear partial differential equations of parabolic type.A numerical study, based on the semidiscrete Galerkin Method with finite elements, is proposed. The present approach uses an iterative process of successive approximations which splits the system in three independent systems of linear equations. Finally, some results of numerical simulation of oxygen consumption, with reference to the lagoon of Orbetello (Tuscany, Italy), are presented and discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Herein, a straightforward method for production of N-doped porous carbon (Co3O4-x@N-C) decorated by hollow Co3O4-x nanoparticles with oxygen vacancies has been studied by one-step pyrolysis of Co-doped quinone-amine polymer in gas mixture of NH3 and Ar. The nanosized CoO/Co3O4 heterostructure can boost the electron transport, while the hollow structure can ensure the structural and chemical stability of the catalyst, and the oxygen vacancy can change the surface electron structure and lower the activation energy barrier for oxygen reduction. Consequently, the as-prepared catalyst Co3O4-x@N-C exhibits excellent ORR catalytic performance (E-1/2 = 0.845 V vs. RHE), exceeding that of Pt/C and most recently reported ORR catalysts. The Zn-air batteries assembled with Co3O4-x@N-C present a high open circuit potential (1.524 V), a large peak power density (105.2 mW cm(-2)) and great discharge-charge cycling performance, superior to the Zn-air batteries assembled with Pt/C.

In this work, we have successfully synthesized Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite Sr2TiO4 as photocatalysts for H-2 evolution reaction. Importantly, we adopted a facile and effective strategy of Ag doping and reducing pretreatment to tailor the properties of Sr2TiO4 photocatalysts. The synergistic effect of Ag doping and moderate reducing pretreatment confers Sr2TiO4 photocatalyst with improved morphological characteristics, increased specific surface area, optimized light absorption capability, and bandgap, suppressed charge carrier recombination, as well as an increased amount of surface oxygen vacancies. Benefiting from these merits, r-Ag0.05Sr1.95TiO4 with a suitable amount of Ag doping and moderate reducing pretreatment displays an excellent photocatalytic performance for H-2 generation, which presents average H-2 production rates of 1695 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) and 541 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under full-range light irradiation (lambda >= 250 nm) and visible light irradiation (lambda >= 400 nm), respectively.

Characterization of the graphene reveals a large surface area, the presence of nanoscale domains and open edges, atomic-level stacking, and high electrical conductivity, which are favorable features for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs). The numerous boundaries and open edges accelerate the gas diffusion process and enlarge the effective reactive surface area for gas evolution, which is responsible for a significant improvement of HER performance and stability compared to a commercial graphene film. The hydrogen adhesion behavior in investigated for both bare Ni foil/foam and graphene grown on Ni foil/foam samples. The hydrogen gas bubbles adhere to the polycrystalline graphene for a long period of time before detaching, in contrast to their behavior on the pristine Ni foil surface. Post treatment of the graphene film using plasma treatment increases the desorption rate of hydrogen bubbles from the surface. The results indicate a wide range of possibilities for use of graphene-based catalysts in electrocatalytic gas evolution reactions. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, the deficiency of intrinsic active sites within the carbon host materials substantially gives rise to an inferior HER performance. In this work, atomically dispersed ruthenium active sites are deliberately introduced into the carbon host structure by controlled pyrolysis of Ru-doped ZIF-8. With atomic Ru sites on a unique whisker-like secondary microstructure and a favorable porous texture, the optimal product exhibits a high intrinsic activity as well as robust durability, which especially outperforms the Pt/C benchmarking in alkaline media. A combination of control experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrates that atomically dispersed Ru sites within the carbon host matrix serve as the dominant catalytically active sites, and remarkably optimize the free energy of water molecule dissociation during the Volmer step, thus boosting the HER performance.									15	2	0	0	2	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521938400025

Herein, inspired by the neural network, we construct a novel artificial neural network-like molybdenum phosphide composite (denoted as MoP@NC-MF), using three-dimensional (3D) melamine resin foams as the scaffold. The neural network-like MoP@NC-MF composite consists of carbon-wrapped MoP nanoparticles of abundant active sites as the "neurons" and N-doped carbon as the "axons". The MoP@NC-MF composite exhibits high electrocatalytic activity and stability for HER with a low overpotential of 125 mV required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 53.0 mV dec-1 under acidic conditions, which is one of the best HER electrocatalysts among the reported single molybdenum phosphide materials. Such a superior performance of the MoP@NC-MF composite is attributed to the unique neural network structure with both abundant MoP active sites to speed the surface reactions and the interconnected carbon "axons" to promptly transfer electrons. Additionally, the 3D network structure facilitates the liquid reactants/gaseous products transporting to/escaping from the reaction centers. Our findings demonstrate that elaborated design of the morphology and the structure can achieve highly efficient electrocatalysts.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			2574-0962			WOS:000458706600037

In this work, low-ruthenium-content NiRu alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon (NiRu@N-C) have been prepared through doping ruthenium species into nickel-based metal-organic frameworks followed by pyrolysis treatment. Benefiting from their unique structural advantages and synergic effect of the components, the as-obtained NiRu@N-C nanohybrids exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity and good stability towards the HER in acidic, neutral, and alkaline solutions.									134	2	0	0	9	0	135			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000423466100005

Different morphologies of IrO2 NPs were formed by tuning the concentration ratio of DNA to iridium salt solution. The probable growth mechanisms of the IrO2 NPs on DNA were elaborated. The potentiality of the DNA@IrO2 NPs was tested in two important applications, one as a catalyst for the oxidation of 2-propanol to acetone and the other as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The catalysis study revealed that the reaction completed in a short time with a higher product yield. The self-assembled, chain-like IrO2 NPs were screened as a potential electrocatalyst for the OER study that required an overpotential of 312 mV, to produce anodic current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) (0.1 M NaOH) with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 7.88 s(-1). This is one among the lowest oxygen overpotentials reported for IrO2 alone. The presence of phosphorous on the DNA-phosphate backbone on the IrO2 NP surface is the key factor for the enhancement of OER activity. Though the conductivity of DNA@IrO2 NPs modified GC is lower than that of bare GC, the synergism assisted enhancement by PO43- from DNA in the overall OER activity makes it worthier still. The overall processes are simple, less time consuming, reproducible, occur at room temperature and can be extended to the synthesis of other important nano-catalysts at a short time scale for their applications in different interdisciplinary fields like organic catalysis and electrocatalysis.									108	1	0	0	2	0	108			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000366163000035

When the reaction is performed in a common reactor with co -feeding of the reactant and oxygen, reactive oxygen species are present on the catalyst surface whereby non-selective oxidation reactions occur. In this work, we studied the possibility to decouple the redox mechanism meaning to separate the reactant oxidation step and the catalyst re-oxidation step for the selective oxidation of isobutane (IBAN) to MAC and MAA. For this purpose, two reactor configurations were employed: a periodic reactor and a two-zone fluidized bed reactor (TZFBR). Whereas the periodic reactor allows the temporal sepa-ration of the two steps, the TZFBR enables the spatial separation. A Cs-based Keggin type heteropolycompound was employed as catalyst and characterized before and after reaction by XRD, Raman and XPS to better understand the structural and chemical changes during the periodic operation. The effect of the oxygen/IBAN concentration on the performance was studied. For the periodic reactor it was found that the conversion of isobutane and the formation of products decreased with the consumption of available oxygen species in the catalyst during a period. For the whole periodic tests, low concentration of ox-ygen injected into the reoxidation part of the cycles led to a high selectivity to the desired products (MAC+MAA).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000844594800002

The challenge for efficient hydrogen generation is the sluggish kinetics at the anodes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, a novel catalyst with remarkably enhanced OER activity was prepared by coupling FeOOH and NiCoP/C. The enhanced OER activity of the hybrid catalyst should be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the individual components. First, NiCoP/C derived from ZIF-67 with a hollow rhombic dodecahedral architecture not only allows exposure of numerous active sites but also provides high conductivity. Second, the re-localization of electrons at the coupling interface optimizes the adsorption/desorption nature of intermediate oxygenated species and imparts a high OER activity. The hybrid NiCoP/C@FeOOH catalyst exhibits very high OER activity with a low overpotential of 271 mV for producing a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH aqueous solution, markedly surpassing the individual counterparts of pure NiCoP/C nanocages and bare FeOOH. This work represents a universal strategy for boosting the OER kinetics of catalysts and pushing boundaries for high-efficiency water oxidation.									26	2	0	0	1	0	27			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000498838100030	31603162

This 3D needle branch-like array nanostructured PANI/CoNiP-NF electrode can not only expose more activity sites but also effectively capture protons from hydrated ions to form protonated amino groups due to abundant lone pair electrons in the nitrogen of PANI. The as-synthesized nanostructured PANI/CoNiP-NF electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic activity, achieving 10 mA cm(-2) current density at a lower overpotential of 61 mV. Density functional theory calculation shows that the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H)*) of PANI/CoNiP is lower than that of CoNiP, further proving theoretically that polyaniline (PANI) can accelerate the hydrogen evolution reaction kinetic process and improve the catalytic activity, which is consistent with the experimental results. Especially, the Ni site of PANI/CoNiP has the lowest Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H)*) of -0.059 eV, close to 0, providing a basis for designing and preparing materials, that is, to expose the crystal planes with more Ni active sites as much as possible, thus improving the catalytic performance of the PANI/CoNiP materials.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2574-0962			WOS:000636714000048

This concise review summarizes recent experimental efforts aimed at tailoring selectivity and activity, and deriving progressive guidelines for catalyst design. First, the current exploration and development of synthetic methodologies of diverse C-SACs for the ORR are briefly outlined. Then we present a key overview of structure-dependent catalytic selectivity and activity properties, in particular emphasizing the microenvironment modulation of single-atom active sites from the aspects of regulating the central metal atoms, coordination environment and support properties. Besides, the dual active site enabled synergistic catalysis for breaking the conventional scaling relation is also highlighted. Finally, the current remaining challenges in C-SACs for the ORR and related perspectives are proposed to shed some light on the further developments toward industrialization in the future.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000714703700001

Evidence from older and more recent studies is presented showing that inhibition of Al corrosion is derived from both inhibition of oxygen reduction and inhibition of metal dissolution reactions mainly due to a delay in the onset of pitting. Inhibition of corrosion by chromates appears to be closely linked to their ability to irreversibly adsorb on to metal and oxide surfaces. With respect to chromate conversion coatings (CCCs), the evolution of modern coating formulations is presented with a focus on key advances that led to process simplification and improved coating performance. The current understanding of CCC formation, protection, and aging is presented. In the last section of the paper, processing and properties of selected chromatefree conversion coating chemistries is discussed. This discussion focuses on coatings that offer particularly attractive attributes such as self-healing and excellent adhesion.									359	16	4	0	6	0	378			0010-9312	1938-159X		WOS:000182766700001

However, its high price due to the use of platinum group metals (PGMs) as catalyst materials generally makes the technology cost-restrictive. Herein we present the performance evaluation of cobalt oxide in PEM electrolysis as cathode catalyst where hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) takes place. Performance comparison of non-PGM catalysts (CoO, Co3O4 and MoS2) revealed that better performance was attained with Co3O4 and it was further improved by mixing with an electrically conducting carbon material (Vulcan). An optimum amount of the carbon additive was found, and the best performance was recorded at 47 wt% Co3O4 over the total amount. At 2.05 V, 47 wt% Co3O4-based catalyst (0.55 A/cm(2)) outperformed 47 wt% MoS2-based one (0.51 A/cm(2)). More importantly, the performance of the former at 2.3 V (1.12 A/cm(2)) surpassed even that of Pt-black (1.11 A/cm(2)). In situ XAS study of the Co3O4-based material under PEM electrolysis conditions revealed dynamic interchange of Co3+ and Co2+ fractions, which was attributed to ultimately boost the HER performance.					6th International Congress on Operando Spectroscopy6th International Congress on Operando Spectroscopy	APR, 2019APR, 2019	Univ Malaga; Ayuntamiento Estepona; US Army Res Off; VS Particle; Avantes; Iberfluid; Renishaw; Timegate; B & W Tek; Hiden Analyt; PID Eng & Tech; Bruker; SECAT; Catalysts; Metrohm DropSens; Lamar EventosUniv Malaga; Ayuntamiento Estepona; US Army Res Off; VS Particle; Avantes; Iberfluid; Renishaw; Timegate; B & W Tek; Hiden Analyt; PID Eng & Tech; Bruker; SECAT; Catalysts; Metrohm DropSens; Lamar Eventos	Estepona, SPAINEstepona, SPAIN	10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000480433000019

The high PEC performance is attributed to the p-p junction for accelerating charge separation and the two dimensional (2D) light trapping effect for enhanced light absorption. Herein, we report a novel photoanode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) which is composed of an n-type pyramid-pattern Si substrate and p-ReS2 NSs. Compared to planar ReS2/p-Si, the p-n junction of ReS2/n-PSi can achieve a much higher photocurrent due to more upward band bending, while more light absorption comes from the 3D anti-reflection structure. By avoiding near-surface downward band bending and enhancing charge transportation, the earth-abundant co-catalyst, NiCo-layered double hydroxides (NiCo-LDH), was finally deposited to boost the photocurrent of the NiCo-LDH/ReS2/n-PSi photoanode into the competitive mA cm(-2) range (1.74 mA cm(-2)). The NiCo-LDH cover layer can also improve the stability of the photoanode by acting as a protective layer. Thus, it is a new concept for ReS2/Si to work as a high-performance photoanode for the OER through Fermi level control and a split-new solution to deal with the energy barrier caused by the work function of different surface materials in a dual photoelectrode system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000755752000001

The present article reports a novel 3D composite structure weaving 1D carbon nanotubes (CNT) and 2D MoS2 nanosheets. The MoS2-CNT composite exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline environment. Measurements show better methanol immunity and higher durability than Pt/C, which is considered the state-of-the-art catalyst for ORR. Experimental results suggest that the hybridization of 1D functionalized multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) and exfoliated 2D MoS2 nanosheet results significant synergistic effect, which greatly promotes the ORR activity. This work presents a new avenue to rationally design a 3D porous composite out of 1D and 2D interlaced components and demonstrate appreciable electrochemical performance of the materials towards ORR activity for fuel cells as well as metal-air batteries.									35	1	0	0	2	0	35			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000444225600015	29858561

Herein, we demonstrate a general approach to porous carbons decorated with boron centers and atomically dispersed Fe-N-x species (denoted as FeBNC). The as-prepared FeBNC can serve as efficient electrocatalysts for ORR in an alkaline medium with a half-wave potential of 0.838 V vs RHE, comparable to that of the state-of-the-art porous carbon catalysts and the benchmark system Pt/C. Theoretical calculation reveals that incorporation of boron dopant into traditional Fe-N-x species-enriched porous carbons significantly lowers the energy barrier for oxygen reduction and therefore boosts the overall performance. This work not only provides an easy method to synthesize B-doped Fe-N-x centers-enriched porous carbons as highly efficient electrocatalysts for ORR and Zn-air batteries but also proves the origin of the catalytic performance from both B dopants and Fe-N-x sites.									192	8	0	0	8	0	193			2380-8195			WOS:000422814500036

Herein, duck blood containing heme (a type of ferriporphyrin) is carbonized and activated to obtain Fe, N doped carbon. The activated carbonized blood (a-CB) exhibits an extremely high specific surface area of 2655 m(2) g(-)(1). Then, Co(3)O(4)nanoparticles are loaded on the efficient substrate via hydrothermal method. The as obtained Co3O4/a-CB composite exhibits good catalytic performance for ORR. The onset and half-wave potentials are 0.95 and 0.77 V vs. RHE, respectively. These values are comparable to those of commercial Pt/C (20 wt.-%) catalyst. What's more, Co3O4/a-CB shows better durability and methanol tolerance than commercial Pt/C, making it a promising electrocatalyst for ORR. Compared to artificial porous heteroatom doped carbon materials, this work seeks raw materials from natural biomass waste to obtain efficient carbon substrate with both high porosity and Fe, N self-doping feature for catalyst applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000564525800001

Therefore, great efforts are being undertaken to design and prepare low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts to boost the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This is because traditional transition-metal electrocatalysts and corresponding hybrids with nonmetal atoms rely mainly on the interaction of metal-H bonds for the HER, which inevitably suffers from corrosion in extreme acidic and alkaline solutions. And as a result of all this effort, novel nanostructured electrocatalysts, such as carbon-encapsulated precious metals and non-precious metals including single metals or their alloys, transition-metal carbides, phosphides, oxides, sulfides, and selenides have all been recently reported to exhibit good catalytic activities and stabilities for hydrogen evolution. Here, the catalytic activity is thought to originate from the electron penetration effect of the inner metals to the surface carbon, which can alter the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption on the surface of materials. In this review, recent progresses of carbon-encapsulated materials for the HER are summarized, with a focus on the unique effects of carbon shells. In addition, perspectives on the future development of carbon-coated electrocatalysts for the HER are provided.									101	5	0	0	2	0	102			2520-8489	2520-8136		WOS:000606751900003		
J	Ma, Yanxia; Wang, Miaomiao; Zhou, Xin								First-principles investigation of beta-Ge3N4 loaded with RuO2 cocatalyst for photocatalytic overall water splitting								JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY				44				24	32		10.1016/j.jechem.2019.09.013				MAY 2020	2020	beta-Ge3N4 loaded with nanoparticulate RuO2 as a cocatalyst is the first successful non-oxide photocatalyst for overall water splitting. To get an insight into the working mechanism of this particular photocatalytic system, we have calculated geometrical structures of low-index surfaces for beta-Ge3N4. Analysis of surface energies indicates that the most preferentially exposed surface is (100). The band gap of surface is narrower than that of bulk due to the dangling bonds. Dissociative water adsorption on (100) surface is thermodynamically favorable. The adsorption behavior of (RuO2)(n) (n = 2, 3, and 4) clusters on the beta-Ge3N4(100) surface has been explored. It is found that all the clusters bind to (100) surface strongly by forming interfacial bonds so that the adsorptions are exothermic processes. The calculation on density of states for beta-Ge3N4(100) surface loaded with (RuO 2) n clusters reveals that photo-induced electrons tend to accumulate on (RuO2) n clusters and holes tend to stay in beta-Ge3N4. Based on the theoretical indication of Type-II staggered band alignment, we have proposed that in photocatalytic water splitting reaction, oxygen evolution reaction is inclined to occur on the surface of beta-Ge3N4 while hydrogen evolution reaction is apt to occur on (RuO2) n clusters. In a word, loading RuO 2 nanoparticles as a reduction cocatalyst benefits the charge separation in beta-Ge3N4. Furthermore, attaching (RuO2)(n) clusters onto beta-Ge3N4(100) surface results in the redshift of absorption edge and the increase of absorption intensity. Our calculations have reasonably explained the experimental observation on the decomposition of water into H-2 and O-2 after loading RuO 2 cocatalyst in beta-Ge3N4 photocatalyst.

The reaction is initiated by the creation of circular voids which expose the underlying silicon substrate. Growth kinetics of the voids is scrutinized via time-lapse STM movies. It is verified that the void perimeters grow linearly with time before coalescence and the reaction occurs peripherally around the void perimeters. It is also demonstrated that the decomposition rate varies concomitantly with the local environment near the reaction fronts. The observed low-high-low rate evolution is qualitatively explained. Increased reaction activation energy is found in the final decomposition stage and the origin of the increase is proposed to be due to the local morphological evolution.									22	1	0	0	1	0	23			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000250725600029

Here, we designed a Cu/ceria catalyst with high selectivity of methane production at single-atomic Cu active sites. Using this, we report favorable design concepts that push the product selectivity of methane formation by combining detailed structural analysis, density functional theory (DFT), in situ Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemical measurements. We demonstrate that a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface, resulting from more available Cu+ sites, enables high selectivity for methane formation during CO2RR and can be controlled by the calcination temperature. The DFT calculation and in situ Raman studies indicate that pH controls the surface termination; a more alkaline pH generates hydroxylated surface motifs with more active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction. These findings provide insights into designing an efficient metal oxide electrocatalyst by controlling the atomic structure via the reaction environment and synthesis conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000848076900001

Hence, enabling charge compensation in sodium layered oxides is a fascinating task for extending the cycle life of sodium-ion batteries. Herein a Ti/Mg co-doping strategy for a model P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 cathode material is put forward to activate charge compensation through highly hybridized O-2(p)-TM3d covalent bonds. In this way, the interlayer O-O electrostatic repulsion is weakened upon deeply charging, which strongly affects the systematic total energy that transforms the striking P2-O2 interlayer contraction into a moderate solid-solution-type evolution. Accordingly, the cycling stability of the codoped cathode material is improved superiorly over the pristine sample. This study starts a perspective way of optimizing the sodium layered cathodes by rational structural design coupling electrochemical reactions, which can be extended to widespread battery researches.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2198-3844		WOS:000773768100001	35347886

Unmodified TiO2 shows some issues, particularly with respect to its photoelectrochemical performance. In this paper, we present a strategy for the controlled deposition of controlled amounts of GaOxNy cocatalysts on TiO2 1D nanowires (TiO2@GaOxNy core-shell) using atomic layer deposition. We show that this modification significantly enhances the photoelectrochemical performance compared to pure TiO2 NW photoanodes. For our most active TiO2@GaOxNy core-shell nanowires with a GaOxNy thickness of 20 nm, a photocurrent density up to 1.10 mA cm(-2) (at 1.23 V vs. RHE) under AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm(-2)) has been achieved, which is 14 times higher than that of unmodified TiO2 NWs. Furthermore, the band gap matching with TiO2 enhances the absorption of visible light over unmodified TiO2 and the facile oxygen vacancy formation after the deposition of GaOxNy also provides active sites for water activation. Density functional theory studies of model systems of GaOxNy-modified TiO2 confirm the band gap reduction, high reducibility and ability to activate water. The highly efficient and stable systems of TiO2@GaOxNy core-shell nanowires with ALD deposited GaOxNy demonstrate a good strategy for the fabrication of core-shell structures that enhance the photoelectrochemical performance of readily available photoanodes.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000524947900023	32193525

Effectively, Platinum alone cannot afford the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to several worries such as unaffordable cost, stability, scarcity and intermediate tolerance etc. that would hurdle the development of fuel cell technology. In order to demonstrate similar efforts, we discuss a synthesis of boron carbon nitride (BCN) nanosheets and its composite by thermal and solvothermal method respectively. The BCN nanosheets also show the formation of a homonuclear B-B bond, which are important for enhancing oxygen affinity. Since the chemistry of B-B bond involves higher bond energy, more reactivity or unusual gas adsorption behavior, thus making such sites promising towards stronger electrophilic interactions such as oxygen adsorption followed by its reduction. As synthesized BCN exhibits an interesting onset potential of similar to 0.94 V in electroreduction of oxygen. More importantly, upon composite formation with carbon black, BCN shows further enhancement in the ORR kinetics with an onset potential of 1.01 V and a current density of 5 mA/cm(2), which is very much comparable with Pt/C. An interesting phenomenon of activating O-2 reduction using BCN has been systematically studied to unravel noble metal-free electrocatalysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies show that enhancing the adsorption and activation of N-2 on the catalyst is the key to improving the NRR performance, and the introduction of oxygen vacancies on the surface of metal oxides is an effective way to design high-performance catalysts. Here, TiO2 with different thicknesses was deposited on conductive carbon cloth by atomic layer deposition, and then oxygen vacancies were introduced on the catalyst surface by an annealing process. The abundant oxygen vacancies on TiO2 surface are found to be beneficial for enhancing the NRR activity of the catalysts. Moreover, the NRR activity is significantly influenced by the thickness of the deposited TiO2 layer, and an over-thick TiO2 layer leads to a decrease in the conductivity of the catalysts and hinders the charge transfer process. With the optimum thickness, the atomic-layer-deposited oxygen-deficient TiO2 catalysts can achieve a Faradaic efficiency of 31.6 % and a yield of 3.4 mu g h(-1) cm(-2) for ammonia production in 0.5 M LiOH aqueous electrolyte at 0 vs. RHE. It is anticipated that ultrathin semiconducting oxide catalysts synthesized by atomic layer deposition will have broad and promising applications for efficient electrochemical NRR.

Herein, an electrochemically exfoliated graphite (EG) foil supported bimetallic selenide encased in N-doped carbon (EG/(Co, Ni)Se-2-NC) hybrid is developed and synthesized by a vapor-phase hydrothermal strategy and subsequent selenization process. The as-prepared EG/(Co, Ni)Se-2-NC hybrid exhibits a core-shell structure where the particle diameter of (Co, Ni)Se-2 core is about 70 nm and the thickness of N-doped carbon shell is approximately 5 nm. Benefitting from the synergistic effects between the combination of highly active Co species and improved electron transfer from Ni species, and N-doped carbon, the EG/(Co, Ni)Se-2-NC hybrid shows remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward OER with a comparatively low overpotential of 258 mV at an current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 73.3 mV dec(-1). The excellent OER catalysis performance of EG/(Co, Ni)Se-2-NC hybrid is much better than that of commercial Ir/C (343 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 98.1 mV dec(-1)), and even almost the best among all previously reported binary CoNi selenide-based OER electrocatalysts. Furthermore, in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy combined with ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicates that the superb OER catalysis activity can be attributed to the highly active Co-OOH species and modified electron transfer process from Ni element.									45	8	0	0	1	0	46			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000479206500001	34138006

In this review, we summarize three efficient strategies-defect engineering, heterostructure formation, and heteroatom doping-for improving the HER performance of 2D catalysts. The d-band theory, density of states, and Fermi energy level are discussed to provide guidance for the design and construction of novel 2D materials. The challenges and prospects of 2D materials in the HER are also considered. (C) 2021, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier B.V.

These ideas are put within an historical context of processes that may have led up to eukaryotization and those that seem to have resulted from this process. Our starting point for considering the emergence and development of life as an organized system of chemical reactions should in the first place be in accordance with thermodynamic principles and hence should, as far as possible, be derived from these principles. One trend to be observed is the ever-increasing complexity resulting in several layers of compartmentalization of the reaction system, either spatial (of which the eukaryotic cell is an example), or functional (as in the gradually deepening distinction between metabolic, enzymatic and information-storing functions within the cell). One of the causes of this complexification of living systems will have been the changes in environmental conditions, particularly the geochemical impoverishment of the biosphere during geological history, partly brought about by living systems themselves, and partly by the trend towards increasing efficiency and specificity of the reactions that occur.									15	0	3	0	9	0	18			0001-5342	1572-8358		WOS:000224158100003	15456987

Cytoglobin is expressed ubiquitously in mammalian tissues; however, its physiological functions are yet unclear. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the cytoglobin gene is highly conserved in vertebrate clades, from fish to reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals. Most proposed roles for cytoglobin require the maintenance of a pool of reduced cytoglobin (Fe-II). We have shown previously that the human cytochrome b(5)/cytochrome b(5) reductase system, considered a quintessential hemoglobin/myoglobin reductant, can reduce human and zebrafish cytoglobins <= 250-fold faster than human hemoglobin or myoglobin. It was unclear whether this reduction of zebrafish cytoglobins by mammalian proteins indicates a conserved pathway through vertebrate evolution. Here, we report the reduction of zebrafish cytoglobins 1 and 2 by the zebrafish cytochrome b(5) reductase and the two zebrafish cytochrome b(5) isoforms. In addition, the reducing system also supports reduction of Globin X, a conserved globin in fish and amphibians. Indeed, the zebrafish reducing system can maintain a fully reduced pool for both cytoglobins, and both cytochrome b(5) isoforms can support this process. We determined the P-50 for oxygen to be 0.5 Torr for cytoglobin 1 and 4.4 Torr for cytoglobin 2 at 25 degrees C. Thus, even at low oxygen tensions, the reduced cytoglobins may exist in a predominant oxygen-bound form.

Solar-powered light-to-heat conversion of photothermal materials enabling desirable surface heat localization satisfies the integration of in situ heating to supply an additional energy source to promote electrocatalytic reactions. Based on these concepts, we herein report a robust photothermal-electrocatalytic water splitting system based on broadband solar harvesting nickel phosphide (Ni2P) within a heat-insulating quasi-Ni-BDC-MOF. Benefiting from the controllable thermal treatment for partial deligandation and synchronous phosphorization, the highly dispersed ultrafine Ni2P nanoparticles are spatially confined within quasi-Ni-BDC-MOF nanosheets, ensuring the effective utilization of local heat assisted by heat-insulating quasi-Ni-BDC-MOF to suppress heat loss. The resulting black Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC exhibits an ultrasensitive and stable light-to-heat response under simulated solar light illumination. By coupling with this excellent photothermal performance, Ni2P@quasi-Ni-BDC under full spectrum light illumination demonstrates the ultralow overpotentials of 246 and 218 mV to deliver 100 mA cm(-2) current density for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions and shows negligible degradation over operating for 50 h and excellent recyclability under several repeated on-off cycles. This performance compares favorably with those of previously reported electrocatalysts working at large currents and outperforms those of most of the photothermal electrocatalysts for water splitting.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000674765600001

Catalytically active nano-scale particles of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-delta (LNF) were impregnated into the porous scaffolds. In order to quantatively determine the resistances of the oxygen reduction or evolution reactions against oxygen permeation, an additional dense YSZ layer was introduced inside the dense YSZ-LSCF permeation layer. Electro-chemical measurements on the resulting five-layered solid oxide fuel cells showed a large reduction in the interfacial polarization resistances at the presence of these LNF catalysts, with the lowest values observed at the LNF loadings of 12wt%. In particular, the cathodic and anodic polarization resistances were 0.26 and 0.08 Omega.cm(2) at 800 degrees C, respectively. The oxygen permeation flux under the air/CH4 gradient was 7.6 mL/(cm.min), which was 14 times higher than the measured value for the blank YSZ-LSCF membrane. Further impedance analysis indicated that the charge transfer step during oxygen reduction may limit the overall oxygen permeation process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-324X			WOS:000425504900003

Supported iridium-based nanoparticles (NPs) are the state-of-the-art OER catalysts for PEM-WE, but the nonhomogeneous dispersion of these NPs on the support together with their nonuniform sizes usually leads to catalyst migration and agglomeration under strongly corrosive and oxidative OER conditions, eventually causing the loss of active surface area and/or catalytic species and thereby the degradation of OER performance. Here, we design a catalyst comprising surface atomic-step enriched ruthenium-iridium (RuIr) nanocrystals homogeneously dispersed on a metal organic framework (MOF) derived carbon support (RuIr@CoNC), which shows outstanding catalytic performance for OER with high mass activities of 2041, 970 and 205 A g(RuIr)(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV and can sustain continuous OER electrolysis up to 40, 45, and 90 h at 10 mA cm(-2) with minimal degradation in 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH = 0.3), 0.05 M H2SO4 (pH = 1), and PBS (pH = 7.2) electrolytes, respectively. Comprehensive experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the good performance of RuIr@CoNC can be attributed, on one hand, to the presence of abundant atomic steps that maximize the exposure of catalytically active sites and lower the limiting potential of the rate-determining step of OER and, on the other hand, to the strong interaction between RuIr nanocrystals and the CoNC support that endows homogeneous dispersion and firm immobilization of RuIr catalysts on CoNC. The RuIr@CoNC catalysts also show outstanding performance in a single-cell PEM electrolyzer, and their large-quantity synthesis is demonstrated.									29	1	0	0	1	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000631434600020

We report a substantial enhancement by a factor of 3 in photocatalytic efficiency for the. oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by adding trace amounts (similar to 0.05 wt %) of noble metals (Rh and Ru) to a 2 wt % cobalt oxide modified Ta3N5 photocatalyst particulate. The optimized system exhibited high quantum efficiencies (QEs) of up to 28 and 8.4% at 500 and 600 nm in 0.1 M Na2S2O8 at pH 14. By isolation of the electrochemical components to generate doped cobalt oxide electrodes, the electrocatalytic activity of cobalt oxide on doping with Ru or Rh was improved in comparison with cobalt oxide, as evidenced by the onset shift for electrochemical OER Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the effect of a second metal addition is to perturb the electronic structure and redox properties in such a way that both hole transfer kinetics and electrocatalytic rates improve. Time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy (TRTS) measurement provides evidence of long-lived electron populations (>1 ns; with mobilities mu(e) approximate to 0.1-3 cm(2) s(-1)), which are not perturbed by the addition of CoOx-related phases. Furthermore, we find that Ta3N5 phases alone suffer ultrafast hole trapping (within 10 ps); the CoOx and M/CoOx decorations most likely induce a kinetic competition between hole transfer toward the CoOx-related phases and trapping in the Ta3N5 phase, which is consistent with the improved OER rates. The present work not only provides a novel way to improve electrocatalytic and photocatalytic performance but also gives additional tools and insight into understand the characteristics of photocatalysts that can be used in a suspension system.									36	1	0	0	1	0	36			2155-5435			WOS:000379457300008

Their electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and corrosion resistance were evaluated using potentiodynamic polarisation and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. The EIS data were approved by Kramers-Kroning transformation (KKT). Also the corrosion resistance of virgin (virgin anodes are made of freshly mined ore which cast from more than 60 ton molten alloy) pure lead anode was compared with recovery pure lead anode by their Tafel diagrams in acidic zinc sulphate electrolyte. Microstructures of the anode alloys were observed using scanning electron microscopy. The results point to that anode Pb-0.4Ag (wt-%) alloy had the lowest corrosion current among the three examined anodes followed by Pb and Pb-0.1Ag-0.07Ca (wt-%), alloys. Also, corrosion resistance the virgin Pb anode is more than recovery one.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			0267-0844	1743-2944		WOS:000342916600005

The electrochemical oxygen pump (concentrator) with a solid polymer electrolyte representing an electrolyzer with air cathode depolarization is a very promising device, which provides the portable, safe, and efficient in situ production of highly pure oxygen at a twice lower energy consumption as compared to the water electrolyzer with a solid polymer electrolyte. The effect produced by the hydrophobization of a nanostructured oxygen reduction catalyst on the oxygen pump characteristics and the endurance of a cathode catalytic layer to flooding has been considered. The modification of a carbon support with polytetrafluoroethylene particles improves the removal of excessive water from the catalytic layer and increases the limiting current characterizing the appearance of transport limitations. The operational parameters (air temperature, flow rate, and pressure) also have an essential effect on the oxygen pump performance and must be optimized to improve water transport in catalytic layers, increase the operating current densities, and reduce the energy consumption in oxygen production.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1995-0780	1995-0799		WOS:000647627900016	33972829

With this setup, the active particles were brought into close contact with a plane platinum cathode by (ultra)centrifugation, resulting in a fast response to any photosynthetic oxygen emission. The situation could be simply modelled and the experimental curves analyzed in terms of two independently adjustable parameters, the diffusion time and the oxygen release time. It was consistently found that the pulse kinetics is nearly diffusion-limited, and confirmed that the photosynthetic oxygen release time was in the millisecond or sub-millisecond range.									30	0	0	0	27	0	30			0006-3002			WOS:A1992JE42100004

Si powders with various sizes were prepared by controlling the high-energy milling duration of the starting Si powder, where the median Si size varied from 3.97 to 0.62 mu m, corresponding to an oxygen content of 034 to 2.57 wt %. The thermal conductivity increased gradually up to the 4 h milling (D-50 = 1.10 mu m or 1.60 wt % oxygen) owing to a gain in the relative density, but decreased by 25% for the 12 h milling (D-50 = 0.62 mu m or 2.57 wt % oxygen). On the other hand, the flexural strength showed almost no change until the 4 h milling, but increased by 20% for 12 h milling. This opposite tendency was elucidated by the difference in grain size distribution and thickness of intergranular grain boundary phase (IGP); Clear bimodal size distribution of grains contributed to high strength, and the nearly doubled thickness of IGP was observed for SRBSN from the finest Si powder (D-50 = 0.62 mu m or 2.57 wt % oxygen). In order to meet the required thermal properties for the substrate usages by sintering at 1900 degrees C, the size of silicon powder of D-50 = 1.10 PM (1.60 wt % oxygen) is allowed for 6h sintering, but that of D 50 = 0.62 mu m (2.57 wt % oxygen) needs prolonged sintering time over 6 h (12 h in the current experiment) to reach required grain growth.

Here, a facile and scalable approach for the fabrication of hierarchically porous air electrode consisting of cobalt nanoparticles embedded in bamboo-like nitrogen-rich carbon nanotubes (Co/N@CNTs), which are in situ grown onto the surface of carbon nanotube macrofilm (CNMF) through a catalytic growth of crosslinked carbon nanotubes is reported. The resulting hybrid macrofilm (Co/N@CNTs@CNMF) can be directly used as a freestanding air electrode without adding any binder or addivities. More importantly, when incorporated in a zinc-air battery (ZAB), the Co/N@CNTs@CNMF electrode demonstrates drastically enhanced ORR and OER activity while maintaining excellent durability during cycling. Further, when it is used to assemble an all-solid-state ZAB, the cell also displays excellent mechanical flexibility, implying promising perspectives as power sources for wearable electronics.									67	3	0	0	3	0	67			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000544215700001

The aim is to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of F doped (Sn,Ir)O-2 solid solution electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane (PEM) based water electrolysis by generating (Sn0.8Ir0.2)O-2:10F nanotubes (NTs). The 1D vertical channels and the high electrochemically active surface area (ECSA similar to 38.46 m(2)g(-1)) provide for facile electron transport. This results in low surface charge transfer resistance (4.2 Omega cm(2)), low Tafel slope (58.8 mV dec(-1)) and excellent electrochemical OER performance with similar to 2.3 and similar to 2.6 fold higher electrocatalytic activity than 2D thin films of (Sn0.8Ir0.2)O-2:10F and benchmark IrO2 electrocatalysts, respectively. Furthermore, (Sn0.8Ir0.2)O-2:10F NTs exhibit excellent mass activity (21.67 A g(-1)), specific activity (0.0056 mAcm(-2)) and TOF (0.016 s(-1)), which is similar to 2-2.6 fold higher than thin film electrocatalysts at an overpotential of 270 mV, with a total mass loading of 0.3 mg cm(-2). In addition, (Sn0.8Ir0.2)O-2:10F NTs demonstrate remarkable electrochemical durability - comparable to thin films of (Sn0.8Ir0.2)O-2:10F and pure IrO2, operated under identical testing conditions in PEM water electrolysis. These results therefore indicate promise of (Sn0.8Ir0.2)O-2:10F NTs as OER electrocatalysts for efficient and sustainable hydrogen production.									22	1	0	0	0	0	23			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000435055500016

The solvothermal decomposition method was opted for tuning the crystalline characteristics of prepared material. The optimized mixed oxide was well characterized, active sites centres were identified and explained by X-ray diffraction, high resolution tunnelling electron micro-scopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray and X-ray photon spectroscopy analysis. The structural and electronic characteristics of material was done by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and the electrochemical behaviour of the prepared material was evaluated by using Tafel plot, electrochemical impedance analysis, linear sweep voltammetry, open circuit analysis and chronoamperometry measurements. The results show the enhanced catalytic activity of Ni-Co-P than pure Ni-P plate, due to synergic effect. Moreover, the prepared mixed oxide incorporated Ni-Co-P plate has a high activity towards HER with low over potential of 101 mV, low Tafel slope of 36 mVdec(-1), high exchange current density of 9.90 x 10(-2) Acm(-2).

Herein, we report the development of ultralow-amount Pt-decorated Ni-P catalysts on nickel foam substrates (Pt/Ni-P/NF) via a facile electroless deposition of Ni-P alloys subsequently decorated with a very small amount of Pt nanoparticles through a dip-coating procedure. Benefiting from the 3D porous backbone of the NF substrate and from the synergistic effect between Ni-P and Pt, the present Pt/Ni-P/NF catalyst demonstrates superior HER activity compared to most of the state-of-the-art Pt-based electrocatalysts, with a very low overpotential (22 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (30 mV dec(-1)) and a high turnover frequency (1.78 s(-1)) at eta = 50 mV. Furthermore, a full alkaline electrolyzer is constructed using Pt/Ni-P/NF as the cathode and undecorated Ni-P as the anode, which can drive overall water splitting with a low potential of 1.64 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This work engenders novel possibilities toward the design of advanced ultralow-content Pt electrocatalysts fulfilling both excellent HER performance and low-cost requirements.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000758021400001

Herein, ultrathin carbon nanoribbons (CNRibs), with a thickness of 2-6 nm and length over 100 nm, have been strategically fabricated via a one-step pyrolysis of one-dimensional (1D) metal-organic framework nanorods (MOF NRods). Manipulating the diameters of MOF NRods will result in the formation of porous carbon nanostructures in 1D or 2D morphologies. Functional CNRibs with N doping or metal active site immobilization have also been studied. The CNRibs decorated with iron nanoclusters and single atoms have been used as excellent catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction under both alkaline and acidic conditions, as well as zinc-air batteries. This work gives deep insights into the structural evolution from 1D to 2D morphology, providing an efficient approach to fabricate low-dimensional nanomaterials with controllable morphologies and functionalities for electrochemical applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2096-5745		WOS:000794257100016

Unlike conventional ORR catalysts, connected Pt-Fe catalysts comprise a beaded network structure formed by the connection of Pt-Fe nanoparticles. The refined structural analyses reveal that the connected Pt-Fe network comprises a polycrystalline structure, whereas the commercial Pt nanoparticle on carbon is formed by a single crystal. In addition, a Pt-rich thin layer made of three-to-four platinum atomic layers with high-index stepped facets was observed on the catalyst surface in the connected Pt-Fe catalyst after electrochemical treatment in an acid electrolyte. Lattice spacing analysis showed that the Pt-Pt bond distance in the Pt-rich surface layer is longer than that inside the network of Pt-Fe alloys. Such surface structures play a beneficial role in enhancing ORR activities. The obtained results provide guidelines for catalyst structural designs that can improve ORR activity.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2574-0962			WOS:000458705100016		
J	Hogan, Craig J.								Nuclear astrophysics of worlds in the string landscape								PHYSICAL REVIEW D				74	12					123514	10.1103/PhysRevD.74.123514				DEC 2006	2006	Motivated by landscape models in string theory, cosmic nuclear evolution is analyzed allowing the standard model Higgs expectation value w to take values different from that in our world (w equivalent to 1), while holding the Yukawa couplings fixed. Thresholds are estimated, and astrophysical consequences are described, for several sensitive dependences of nuclear behavior on w. The dependence of the neutron-proton mass difference on w is estimated based on recent calculations of strong isospin symmetry breaking, and is used to derive the threshold of neutron-stable worlds, w approximate to 0.6 +/- 0.2. The effect of a stable neutron on nuclear evolution in the big bang and stars is shown to lead to radical differences from our world, such as a predominance of heavy r-process and s-process nuclei and a lack of normal galaxies, stars, and planets. Rough estimates are reviewed of w thresholds for deuteron stability and the pp and pep reactions dominant in many stars. A simple model of nuclear resonances is used to estimate the w dependence of overall carbon and oxygen production during normal stellar nucleosynthesis; carbon production is estimated to change by a fraction approximate to 15(1-w). Radical changes in astrophysical behavior seem to require changes in w of more than a few percent, even for the most sensitive phenomena.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			1550-7998	1550-2368		WOS:000243171800035

Pyrite cobalt selenide (CoSe2) is considered an excellent non-noble metal compound HER catalyst due to its low price and excellent electrical conductivity. However, the HER catalytic activity of CoSe2 is still not ideal because of the weak adsorption of hydrogen on its active Co site. The anion introduction can improve the electronic structure of the catalyst and thereby enhance the performance of HER. Here, we report that B-doped CoSe2 nanomaterials on carbon cloth (B-CoSe2/CC) were successfully synthesized. Compared with CoSe2, B-CoSe2 exhibits better HER performance in 1 M KOH. The overpotential of B-CoSe2 catalyst is only 153 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Tafel slope of B-CoSe2/CC sample is only 85 mV dec(-1). In addition, B-CoSe2/CC exhibits perfect long-term durability and cycle stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that the doping of B improves the intrinsic conductivity of CoSe2 and optimizes the hydrogen adsorption free energy (delta G(H)*) of Se and Co sites. This work not only proposes a new anion doping strategy to improve the electronic structure of cobalt-based selenides for improved HER performance, but also provides a reference for the screening and design of other transition metal compound HER electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000796623700005

In particular, MOFs were widely used in electroanalysis and water splitting for their electrical conductivity and rich redox electrochemical activities. Prussian blue analogue (PBA), which owns hollow nanostructured MOFs with large surface area and unique structural features, offers great advantages for constructing advanced electrodes. Meanwhile, compared with platinum-based catalysts, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is increasingly becoming a research focus as an affordable alternative obtaining electrochemical hydrogen production from water. Here we synthesized the nano materials, MoS2-Co nanoboxes, using the facile hydrothermal method between cobalt Prussian blue analogue (Co PBA) nanocubes and ammonium thiomolybdate ((NH4)(2)MoS4). In acid and alkaline media, the MoS2-Co nanoboxes exhibit favorable catalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, for researching the relationship of structural changes of MoS2 supported on Co PBA nanocubes and HER catalytic performance, we use the Raman spectroscopy to monitor nanostructured MoS2 which can promote the exposure of the most active sites. This new method applied in this study can be widely adopted for characterization of transition metal dichalcogenides with various compositions for a wide range of applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A combination of operando x-ray absorption spectroscopy and potentiometric control under aqueous conditions revealed the trends in reactivity yielded by these electrodes, which are directly associated with the cross-and overpotentials as well as the occupancy of the 3d orbitals. It was found that under anodic polarization the materials electrodeposited on gold suffer from a lack of stability, while under cathodic polarization they exhibit stable behavior. The observed activity is strongly related to the lack of stability shown by these composites under anodic polarization revealing a dynamic process ruled by corrosion. By operando x-ray absorption, we established that the overall enhancement of the activity for the oxygen evolution reaction is directly attributable to the cross-potential and corrosion process of the electrodeposited materials. It is associated with the high potential deposition, which is the origin of the incipient oxidation-corrosion resistance of the lattice. We conclude that the observed trends in the total current are directly associated with the loss of oxygen in the metal-oxide lattice and the subsequent dissolution of metallic ions in the electrolyte under anodic polarization.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000390335600002

Previous studies of these catalysts have reported conflicting results on the influence of noble metal supports on the OER activity of the transition metal oxides. Our study aims to clarify the interactions between a transition metal oxide catalyst and its metal support in turning over this reaction. To achieve this goal, we examine a catalytic system comprising nanoparticulate Au, a common electrocatalytic support, and MnOx, a promising OER catalyst. We conclusively demonstrate that adding Au to MnOx significantly enhances OER activity relative to MnOx in the absence of Au, producing an order of magnitude higher turnover frequency (TOF) than the TOP of the best pure MnOx catalysts reported to date. We also provide evidence that it is a local rather than bulk interaction between Au and MnOx that leads to the observed enhancement in the OER activity. Engineering improvements in nonprecious metal-based catalysts by the addition of Au or other noble metals could still represent a scalable catalyst as even trace amounts of Au are shown to lead a significant enhancement in the OER activity of MnOx.									180	4	0	0	14	2	181			0002-7863			WOS:000333947900031	24661269

Metal organic frameworks have been emerging catalyst of higher crystalline, large surface area, has delivering greater potential for efficient OER electrocatalytic activity. Bimetallic metal organic framework (MOFs) is an excellent catalyst for energy storage and energy conversion system. In this work, we report the synthesis of bimetallic MOF by single step solvothermal method using Ni, Cu as metal sources and BDC as a linker. FE-SEM images indicated NiCu-MOF a narrow crystal formation. The electrocatalyst study of the synthesized catalyst was systematically investigated by linear sweep voltammetery, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Chronoamprometry under OER condition. The result demonstrated that NiCu-MOF exhibited better catalytic activity towards OER at onset potential and overpotential of 1.48 V and 250 mV with lower tafel slope of 169 mV/dec, indicating that 25% lower energy required for OER. Hence the proposed NiCu-MOF catalyst is an efficient catalyst for sustainable oxygen evolution reaction.& nbsp; (C)& nbsp;2021 The Author(s).

In order to explore a cheap, abundant, active, and durable catalyst for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), two-dimensional (2D) ceria nanosheets are produced through a thermal decomposition exfoliation method from CeCO3OH with a layer-stacked structure. The additional cobalt dopant promotes formation of oxygen vacancies in ceria nanosheets and, in turn, optimizes hydrogen binding/water dissociation and increases the active sites. As a result, the 2D Co-doped CeO2 nanosheets exhibit an excellent catalytic performance in alkaline HER such that the overpotential is as low as 132 and 215 mV to deliver a high current density of 100 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively, outperforming Pt. Such 2D Co-doped CeO2 nanosheets are also durable HER electrocatalysts, as the activity loss during an extended period of operation is nearly negligible.									95	3	0	0	7	0	97			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000526394200003	32202784

The first concerns the reduction of the tyrosyl radical that occurs in every S-state transition. The two leading models, hydrogen atom transfer and electron transfer, have been investigated. In the present study, hydrogen atom transfer has the lower barrier. The second topic addressed is O-O bond formation in the S-3 to S-0 transition, where a Mn-3 complex including calcium and chloride cofactors was used as a model. The reaction is suggested to proceed from a bridging oxyl group to a radical hydroxyl, which combines to form the O-O bond with a hydroxide ligand of the Mn complex.									12	0	0	0	6	0	12			0026-8976	1362-3028		WOS:000180293100035

Oxygen vacancy (V-O) has attracted increasing attention in tailoring photoelectrodes in the following three aspects: light harvest, charge separation and transfer, and surface reaction kinetics. Even though the V-O may increase the recombination as a kind of defects in metal oxide based photoelectrode, a number of recent researches have revealed the beneficial feature of V-O in PEC, which is controversial to the former understanding. Thus, a comprehensive analysis about the oxygen vacancy in the metal oxide photoelectrodes will be important for applying V-O in achieving high PEC performance. Herein, we contribute a critical review on the role of oxygen vacancy including its formation mechanism, characterization methods, and the influence on the semiconductor and surface catalytic properties. The knowledge will help to clarify the effect of V-O in terms of the structure-performance relationship in the PEC process.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13				2567-3173		WOS:000682527600006

A versatile and scalable solution-processing method to prepare such a catalytic electrode with high flexibility and conductivity is introduced. This preparation method is applicable for a wide variety of metal species and takes graphene sheets as metal carriers and film-forming agents, resulting in 100% utilization of raw materials.

The assembled two-electrode configuration can be used in a practical full water splitting system, requiring a cell voltage of 1.58 or 1.50 V at 30 or 70 degrees C to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2); it also exhibits a long-term durability over 200 h, superior to most of the reported systems for the same purpose.

In an effort to optimize MMO morphology, aniline was used as a capping agent to produce high-surface-area Ni-Fe-Co films on Raney nickel supports. This catalyst exhibits enhanced mass activity in comparison to the Ni-Fe OER electrocatalysts reported to date. Cyclic voltammetry shows changes in the potential of the Ni2+/(3+) transitions in Fe- or Co-containing MMO films. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis confirms that Fe acts to stabilize Ni in the 2+ oxidation state, while Co facilitates oxidation to the 3+ state. The results of this study support the recent claims that Fe (not Ni) is the OER active site. The OER enhancement of the ternary Ni-Fe-Co catalyst results from two effects: (1) the charge-transfer effects of Co result in the formation of the conductive (NiOOH)-O-II phase at lower overpotential, thus activating the Fe sites which are otherwise inaccessible to electron transfer in the nonconductive Ni-II(OH)(2) host lattice, and (2) XAS analysis shows that the presence of Co effectively "shrinks" the Ni and Fe local geometry, likely resulting in an optimized Fe-OH/OOH bond strength. In addition, analysis of heat-treatment effects indicates that calcination at 400 degrees C improves the OER activity of Ni-Fe-Co but deactivates Ni-Fe. Annealing studies under argon show that MMO surfaces with a hydrated Ni(OH)(2) phase and a crystalline NiO phase exhibit nearly identical OER activities. Finally, the morphology of the MMO catalyst film on Raney Ni support provides excellent catalyst dispersion and should result in high active-site utilization for use in technologically relevant gas-diffusion electrodes.									332	17	0	0	20	0	335			2155-5435			WOS:000367706800018

Since the electrocatalytic OER is a four-electron transfer reaction with a very sluggish kinetic process, there is great interest in the development of inexpensive, durable, and high-efficiency OER catalysts. Herein, trimetallic Co-Ni-Ru sulfoselenide and bimetallic sulfoselenide nanosheets were designed by regulating their composition and morphology for efficient and durable OER electrocatalysis. The sheet structure has a large specific surface area to promote contact between the catalyst and electrolyte. Compared with bimetallic Co-Ni, Co-Ru, Ni-Ru, Co-Cd, and Co-Au sulfoselenide nanosheets, trimetallic Co-Ni-Ru sulfoselenide nanosheets show superior OER performance. By modulating the composition ratio of metal atoms in the Co-Ni-Ru-S-Se nanosheets (1:1:0.5:1:1), the nanosheets showed a significant OER overpotential of eta = 261 mV (1.491 V versus RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 52.2 mV dec(-1) and outstanding stability after 48 h of continuous testing. For comparison, Co-Ni, Co-Ru, Ni-Ru, Co-Cd, and Co-Au bimetallic sulfoselenide nanosheets (denoted as Co-Ni-S-Se, Co-Ru-S-Se, Ni-Ru-S-Se, Co-Au-S-Se, Co-Cd-S-Se) were also tested. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that appropriately doping Ru and Ni simultaneously (Co-Ni-Ru-S-Se) can increase the density of the states at the Fermi level, resulting in excellent charge density and low intermediate adsorption energy. These findings present a practical route to design 2D polymetallic nanosheets to optimize catalytic OER performance.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1884-4049	1884-4057		WOS:000770314600001

The structure and the surface morphologies of the electrodes were characterized by XRD, SEM, and the electrochemical properties were investigated by linear scan voltammetry. The results showed that in NaCl solution and Na2SO4 solution, with increasing the Ir content, the potential gap of electrochemical oxidation (Delta E) between chlorine evolution and oxygen evolution decreased. The electrode containing 30% Ir (by mol%) had the highest chlorine evolution efficiency. Using Ti/Sn0.7Ir0.3O2 electrode as anode, a simulated wastewater with p-chlorophenol as pollutant was degraded by constant current electrolysis. The degradation rate of p-chlorophenol in presence of NaCl was faster than in presence of Na2SO4.

Herein, an interfacial engineering strategy to fabricate Co-doped 1T-MoS2 coupling with V2C MXene was reported to improve the HER kinetics of MoS2. DFT calculations predict that the construction of heterogeneous interfaces between V2C MXene and Co-doped 1T-MoS2 can effectively reduce the energy barrier of water dissociation and optimize the free energy of hydrogen adsorption. As a result, the synthesized Co-MoS2/V2C@CC nanohybrid exhibits excellent HER performance with small overpotentials of 70.1, 263.2 and 296 mV to achieve current densities of 10, 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively, and outstanding stability for 50 h HER test without degradation. Additionally, the overall hydrazine-assisted water splitting (OHzS) system catalyzed by Co-MoS2/V2C@CC in both anode and cathode requires only 0.33 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with significant long-term durability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000853065400003

Morphological tuning was performed by a complexation-precipitation approach employing one-pot hydrothermal synthesis and the obtained material was characterized using XRD, FT-IR and XPS. A peculiar bird-feather (BF) like morphology was obtained by optimizing the structure directing agent (SDA) concentration, reaction temperature and time. Its ORR reactivity was studied by performing macro and micro-electrochemical analysis suggesting a prominent (2 + 2) e(-) pathway having an onset potential of 0.99 V (vs. RHE). Furthermore, the role of the SDA in generating electrocatalytically active sites was mapped by performing comparative scanning electrochemical microscopy imaging (SECM) in the redox-competition (RC) mode. The obtained surface plots correlated well with the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurements in response to distinct sample (MnWO4) potentials ranging from kinetic-limited to mass-transfer limited domains. The morphologically optimized MnWO4 was further found to be an efficient electrocatalytic competitor against Pt/C (20%), an expensive and limited noble-metal catalyst.									27	1	0	0	2	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000424466300029

This typical nanoarchitecture possesses many characteristic compensations, (i) incorporation of OV in MFO to moderate the electronic arrangement for enhancing the electrons mobility and offering additional space for electrocatalysis and rapid absorption/diffusion of ions, (ii) homogeneously dispersed MFO nanospheres with great number of active sites and excellent catalytic activity, (iii) robust interaction between NSC and MFO ensuring the longstanding electrochemical stability, which are favorable to enhancing the kinetics of urea electrocatalysis. Electrochemical measurements proved NSC-MFO possesses outstanding UOR activity that shows a low potential of 1.42 V to attain 50 mA/cm(2), too NSC-MFO contributes to excellent HER activity with low overpotential of 0.192 V to attain 50 mA/cm(2). The excellent UOR performance of NSC-MFO authenticates could be wonderful applicant to replace OER to lower the cell potential thus decrease consumption of electrical energy for hydrogen-gas generation. As a proof of concept, overall urea splitting has been done with NSC-MFO as both cathode and anode, as-fabricated urea electrolytic cell offered 10 mA/cm(2) at the cell voltage of 1.43 V with good durability for 15 h, displaying its potential practicability for energy-saving hydrogen making.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000636270600007

The formation of paramagnetic centers has been identified. It was observed that the evolution of various paramagnetic defects reveals several macroscopic flow processes that take place in the system. Some of these processes are the destruction of primary durable nanoparticle ZnO aggregates, the crushing of individual nanoparticles (250-14 nm), the development of accumulative thermal processes in the sample, the interaction of carbon atoms with oxygen from the treatment chamber and from the surface of the ZnO nanoparticles, the formation of reducing atmosphere in the grinding chamber, and the occurrence of the forming conditions of the phase transition ZnOW -> ZnOS on the surface layers of ZnOW nanoparticles.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000355016300004

Its electrochemical properties as the cathode catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries are investigated. Compared to un-doped, nitrogen or iodine single doped porous graphene, nitrogen and iodine co-doped porous graphene shows much higher activity for oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. As oxygen cathode for Li-O-2 batteries, nitrogen and iodine co-doped porous graphene exhibits an outstanding specific reversible capacity up to 14000 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1), a superior high-rate capability (5000 mAh g(-1) at 1000 mA g(-1)), and an excellent cycling stability enduring over 225 cycles with a limited capacity of 1000 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 500 mA g(-1). The fantastic cycling performance can be attributed to a combination of porous structure and dual-doping, which not only provides a large number of channels for oxygen diffusion and electrolyte infiltration, but also supplies abundant active catalytic sites to affect the formation and decomposition of the discharge products with various morphologies. This study provides an effective approach to develop highly-efficient carbon-based catalysts with optimized pore structure and tunable surface chemistry.

Previous approaches based on the MPT are computationally less challenging than other simulation models and are typically suitable for galvanic corrosion. In this work, an approach closer to reality is proposed by considering uniform corrosion aspects. Therefore, the metal surface is characterized by oxygen-deficient and oxygen-rich areas to model the anodic and cathodic reactions, respectively. Polarization curves are measured in 5 wt% NaCl electrolyte and are then used during finite element methods (FEM) simulation as respective boundary conditions on the metal surface, leading to a multiple microelectrode system. By randomly defining the microelectrodes as cathodes or anodes, that is, assigning polarization data from the oxygen-rich or oxygen-deficient electrolyte, the uniform corrosion is modeled. The independence of the corrosion rates from the arbitrary model parameters and surface width (up to 1 mm) is confirmed. The results from this FEM simulation for zinc and a low-alloy steel are compared to the normed neutral salt spray (NSS) test and show good qualitative agreement. Further on, the galvanic corrosion of a zinc-steel couple is modeled and the expected result for varying cathode-anode surface ratio is reproduced.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0947-5117	1521-4176		WOS:000452197200004

The single-atom Co-N4OH structure was confirmed experimentally and theoretically and was verified to enhance optical absorption and charge separation and work as the active site for the OER. Co-PCN exhibits the highest OER rate of 37.3 mu mol h(-1) under visible light irradiation, similar to 28-fold higher than that of common PCN/CoOx, with the highest apparent quantum yields reaching 4.69, 2.06, and 0.46% at 400, 420, and 500 nm, respectively, and is among the best OER photocatalysts reported so far.

In the present work graphene oxide incorporated, MnO2-NiO composite metal oxide nanoflakes were synthesized on the stainless steel substrate using efficient electrodeposition route in alkaline media and drop casting method with further annealing treatment at 400 degrees C for 4 h. Initially MnO2-NiO nanoflakes were deposited using different cyclic sweep rates, later graphene oxide suspension was drop casted on the MnO2-NiO nanoflakes and subsequently subjected to annealing at 200 degrees C for 2 h. The prepared electrode material is denoted as GO/MnO2-NiO/SS and used as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution. Field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Energy dispersive electron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy were used to study the crystalline nature and morphologies of the deposited films. The electrochemical properties of the electrode material were investigated using cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry. The electrode exhibits low overpotential and small Tafel slope of 379 mV and 47.84 mVdec(-1) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline (KOH) medium. In addition, the electrode shows a long time stability of 28800 s. Hence, the present study suggests that the GO incorporated Mn-Ni bimetal oxide modified electrode is suitable electrode material for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), owing to its facile preparation, inexpensive, easy handling and high active nature.

Powered and clocked by quanta of light the centre accumulates four oxidising equivalents before oxygen is released. The first three oxidising equivalents are stored on the Mn4Ca-cluster, raising its formal oxidation state from S-0 to S-3 and the third on Y-Z, producing S-3 Y-Z(ox). From there on water oxidation proceeds in what appears as a single reaction step (S3YZox(H2O)(2) reversible arrow O-2 + 4H(+) + S-0. Intermediate oxidation products of bound water had not been detected, until our recent report on the stabilisation of such an intermediate by high oxygen pressure (NATURE 430, 2004, 480-483). Based on the oxygen titration (half-point 2.3 bar) the standard free-energy profile of a reaction sequence with a single intermediate was calculated. It revealed a rather small difference (-3 kJ mol(-1)) between the starting state [S3YZox(H2O)(2) and the product state S0YZ + O-2 + 4H(+). Here we describe the tests for side effects of exposing core particles to high oxygen pressure. We found the reduction of P-680(+center dot) in ns and the reduction/dismutation of quinones at the acceptor side of PSII both unaffected, and the inhibition of the oxygen evolving reaction by exposure to high O-2-pressure was fully reversible by decompression to atmospheric conditions.

Here, the surface species of Li2CO3, widely identified together with Li2O2 at the end of discharge, is investigated to understand its implication for the oxidation of Li2O2. In situ doping Li2O2 with various amounts of Li2CO3 has been obtained by reacting with CO2 gas in a controlled way, and the electrochemical oxidation of the doped Li2O2 is studied with a quantitative differential electrochemical mass spectrometer (DEMS). Instead of a single charging potential plateau and one O-2 gas evolution stage for the pristine Li2O2, Li2CO3-doped Li2O2 exhibits two O-2/CO2 gas evolution stages and three charging plateaus characterized with the larger overpotential for the initial and final stages. The conductivity of Li2CO3 dopant is invoked to explain the different oxidation behaviors of Li2CO3-doped Li2O2. The DEMS study of the electrochemical oxidation of isotope-labeled (Li2CO3)-C-13 is also conducted to identify the origins of O-2 and CO2 evolution during the oxidation of Li2CO3-doped Li2O2. The results reported here provide an improved understanding of the Li2O2 oxidation in the presence of parasitic Li2CO3 species and will contribute to the future development of Li-O-2 batteries.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000512216900150	31922718

In this study, as a novel MoS2-based heterostructure electro-catalyst for OER, namely NiSe2@MoS2 nano-heterostructure, was constructed on a carbon fiber paper (CFP) substrate by a simple approach, which includes electrochemical deposition of NiSe2 film and hydrothermal processing of MoS2 film. In addition to a series of observations on the material structure, electrocatalytic OER performance of NiSe2@MoS2 was fully evaluated and further compared with other MoS2-based OER electro-catalysts. It exhibits an outstanding catalytic performance with an overpotential eta(10) of 267 mV and a Tafel slope of 85 mV dec(-1). Only 6% loss of current density before and after 10 h indicates its excellent durability. The results indicate that the obtained NiSe2@MoS2 is an excellent OER electro-catalyst and worth exploring as a substitute for noble metal-based materials.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2046-2069		WOS:000683150000050	35479997

The most distinguishing feature of this technology is that it takes advantage of reversible conversion reactions of O-2 or other air components (such as N-2 or CO2) at the cathode. To promote these reactions, catalysts are often needed. A large number of materials have been studied for this purpose. In the present paper, we discuss the roles played by catalysts in metal-air battery systems. In particular, we choose to focus the discussions on the Li-O-2 batteries as they are most intensely studied in the literature. Within this context, catalysts are often shown effective to facilitate the oxygen (O-2) reduction reactions and/or O-2 evolution reactions. The overall cell performance as measured by the round-trip efficiencies and charge/discharge rates can be significantly improved by the incorporation of catalysts. However, the presence of catalysts is also found to complicate the chemical reactions as they often exhibit activities toward parasitic chemical reactions such as electrolyte and electrode decompositions. The issue is especially acute in aprotic Li-O-2 batteries, where organic electrolytes and reactive O-2 species are mixed. In addition to heterogeneous catalysts, we also discuss the roles played by homogeneous catalysts as redox mediators, which are effective to promote redox reactions that are critical to energy storage applications.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2159-6859	2159-6867		WOS:000437442100018

In this communication, we report our recent finding that the generation of amorphous Co-borate layer on Co3O4 nanowire arrays supported on Ti mesh (Co3O4@Co-Bi NA/TM) leads to significantly boosted OER activity. The as-prepared Co3O4@Co-Bi NA/TM demands overpotential of 304 mV to drive a geometrical current density of 20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, which is 109 mV less than that for Co3O4 NA/TM, with its catalytic activity being preserved for at least 20 h. It suggests that the existence of amorphous Co-Bi layer promotes more CoOx(OH)(y) generation on Co3O4 surface.									28	2	0	0	1	0	28			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000414633200007	28925516

In this paper, we introduce the fundamental principles and applications of Mg-air batteries. Recent progress in Mg or Mg alloys as anode materials and typical classes of air cathode catalysts for Mg-air batteries are reviewed. In the meantime, different compositions of the electrolyte are also compared. The design of electrode materials both for anodes and cathodes of Mg-air batteries is discussed for further performance improvement. It is noted that in the development of rechargeable Mg-air batteries, bi-functional catalysts with reversible oxygen reduction and evolution reactions are facing challenges and it is worthwhile devoting much effort to this.									264	22	0	0	5	0	271			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000348073000004

Ultrafine PtRu alloy nanoparticles (1.0 +/- 0.2 nm in diameter) are synthesized by using a chemical polyol method and used for electro/photo-catalyses. Integration of PtRu nanoparticles with carbon and Al-doped SrTiO3 powders via liquid-phase adsorption and successive two-step air and H-2 annealing ensures uniform deposition of PtRu alloy nanoparticles (<2 nm) with a solid-solution structure. The PtRu alloy nanoparticles exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction than monometallic Pt counterparts. Modifying Al-doped SrTiO3 with PtRu alloy nanoparticles results in efficient photocatalytic overall water-splitting activity with an apparent quantum yield of 65% at 365 nm and a solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of 0.45%, which are the highest values among SrTiO3-based photocatalytic water splitting systems with Rh-free cocatalysts. Transient diffuse reflectance spectroscopy reveals that the PtRu nanoparticles have a superior electron-capturing ability than the Pt counterparts, probably due to the decreased work function of Pt by alloying with Ru. This work establishes a framework to elucidate catalytic trends and provides rational design guidance toward the development of bimetallic solid-solution nanoparticles as cost-effective and highly active cocatalysts for overall water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000797562500001

Replacing OER with the more thermodynamically favorable carbohydrate oxidation reaction (COR) offers a viable strategy for energy-saving hydrogen production. Herein, we design and fabricate the carbon-coated loose nickel-cobalt nitride nanoflakes (NiCoNx@C) on deliberately coarsened nickel foam (Ni/NF) support through a successive electrodeposition and annealing process, the thus obtained NiCoNx@C/Ni/NF electrocatalyst with hierarchical porous architecture exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance toward both the acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the representative alkaline COR. The NiCoNx@C/Ni/NF achieves an ultralow working potential of 1.26 V at 50 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH with 0.5 M fructose for COR and a small over potential of 78 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 for HER. We further design an asymmetric-electrolyte electrolyzer, using the bifunctional NiCoNx@C/Ni/NF as both the cathode and anode, which can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for electrolytic hydrogen production with a rather low applied voltage of 0.67 V and faradaic efficiency approaching 100%, showing great potential to use waste carbohydrates to producing hydrogen energy efficiently.

J	AYRE, CR; MADIX, RJ								C-C AND C-H BOND ACTIVATION OF 1,2-PROPANEDIOXY BY ATOMIC OXYGEN ON AG(110) - EFFECTS OF COADSORBED OXYGEN ON REACTION-MECHANISM								SURFACE SCIENCE				303	3			297	311		10.1016/0039-6028(94)90777-3				FEB 20 1994	1994	The stability of adsorbed 1,2-propanedioxy OCH(CH3)CH2O, generated via 0-H bond activation of 1,2-propanediol by oxygen adatoms on Ag(110), has been shown to be sensitive to the relative concentrations of 1,2-propanedioxy and O(a). When the concentration of O(a) is sufficiently large, OCH(CH3)CH2O(a) is formed via 0-H bond activation upon the adsorption of 1,2-propanediol at 175 K. C-H bond activation, nucleophilic attack by O(a) and C-C bond scission subsequently occur to yield formaldehyde, water, formate and acetate by 275 K. Acetol CH3C(=O)CH2OH evolves at 335 K, driven from the surface either by the onset of the conversion of CH3COO(a) to HCOO(a) and CO2(g) or by through-surface interactions. CO2(g), H2O(g), acetol, lactaldehyde CH3CH(OH)CH=O and 1,2-propanediol evolve at 360 K. Production of pyruvaldehyde CH3C(=O)CH=O, acetol, and lactaldehyde occurs at 415 K and is accompanied by the evolution of additional CO2(g) and H2O(g) due to formate decomposition in the presence of O(a)(OH(a)). No H-2(g) evolves. Residual acetate decomposes to yield CO2(g), CH3COOH(g), and CH2=C=O(g) in the absence of O(a) near 580-620 K. The evolution of H2CO(g) and H2O(g) at 275 K and the production of acetol at 335 K suggest that initial C-H bond activation occurs preferentially at the central carbon of 1,2-propanedioxy. The production of lactaldehyde at both 360 and 415 K and pyruvaldehyde at 415 K indicates that with heating subsequent C-H bond activation occurs at carbon-1. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that 0-H and C-H bond activation and C-C bond scission are characteristic oxidation mechanisms for diols on oxygen-activated Ag(110).									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0039-6028			WOS:A1994NA60600006

The following experiments were performed: 1) directly testing the effect of exogenous H2O2; 2) testing the effect of intracellular H2O2 generated with the use of methyl viologen (MV); 3) testing the effect of inhibiting intracellular H2O2 decomposition by salicylic acid (SA) and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT). H2O2 inhibited photosynthetic O-2 evolution and light-induced reduction of p-benzoquinone (BQ) + ferricyanide (FeCy) in the Hill reaction. The I-50 value for H2O2 was similar to0.75 mM. Photosynthetic electron transfer in the cells treated with H2O2 was not maintained by H2O2, NH2OH, 1,5-diphenylcarbazide, tetraphenylboron, or butylated hydroxytoluene added as artificial electron donors for Photosystem (PS) II. The H2O --> CO2, H2O --> MV (involving PSII and PSI) and H2O --> BQ + FeCy (chiefly dependent on PSII) electron transfer reactions were inhibited upon incubation of the cells with MV, SA, or AT. The N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine --> MV (chiefly dependent on PSI) electron transfer was inhibited by SA and AT but was resistant to MV. The results show that H2O2 inhibits photosynthetic electron transfer. It is unlikely that H2O2 could be a physiological electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis.									22	2	0	0	20	0	24			0006-2979	0320-9725		WOS:000169938900008	11421813

The simulations are rigorously validated against the existing experimental data. The unsteady temperature and species concentration fields are calculated in the course of transient burning process and the subsequent diffusion of the combustion products into the surrounding gases. These numerical results are further post processed to reveal the temporal rates of unsteady entropy generation by chemical and transport mechanisms in the gaseous phase of the reactive system. The spatio-temporal evolutions of the temperature, major chemical species including CO, CO2, O-2, H-2 and H2O, and also the local entropy generations are presented. It is shown that the homogenous combustion of the products of devolatilisation process dominates the temperature and chemical species fields at low concentrations of oxygen. Yet, by oxygen enriching of the atmosphere the post-ignition heterogeneous reactions become increasingly more influential. Analysis of the total entropy generation shows that the chemical entropy is the most significant source of irreversibility and is generated chiefly by the ignition of volatiles. However, thermal entropy continues to be produced well after termination of the particle life time through diffusion of the hot gases. It also indicates that increasing the molar concentration of oxygen above 21% results in considerable increase in the chemical and thermal entropy generation. Nonetheless, further oxygen enrichment has only modest effects upon the thermodynamic irreversibilities of the system. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This requires the development of methodologies allowing, simultaneously, the unraveling of the NPs geometry and the screening of their reactivity. Herein, nanoimpact electrochemistry (NIE) allows for quantifying the transformation and measuring the electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of >100 Ni(OH)(2) NPs of a wide range of size (NP radii from 25 to 100 nm). This is achieved by scanning electrochemical microscopy in a generation/collection-like mode, with one electrode being used to electrogenerate by local precipitation colloidal Ni(OH)(2) NPs and the second one being used to collect them by NIE. It allows (i) quantifying the reductive and oxidative conversion of the Ni(OH)(2) NPs and (ii) separating the electrochemical conversion and the OER electrocatalysis, leading to the evaluation of a structure-activity relationship.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1948-7185			WOS:000817939800001	35687372

The obtained catalysts were characterised by X-ray diffraction and electrochemistry. Increasing the amount of Ni in the precursor complexes leads to materials with lower overpotential for the OER at low current densities, and lower Tafel slopes. Co nanoparticles, which are only formed in materials with low Ni content, increase the intrinsic material conductivity and reduce the OER overpotential at high current densities.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000402220600010

The BF air electrodes exhibited encouraging performance and cycle-ability. Under the test condition of room temperature (20-22 degrees C), 6 M KOH and 50 mA/cm(2), the obtained oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential was around 0.67 V and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) potential was around - 0.20 V vs. Hg/HgO reference electrode. Number of cycle of 2 h (approximately) duration reached over 180 cycles at 20 mA/cm(2) using a copper exmet as negative Zn electrode substrate. The Zn air battery prototype showed coulmbic efficiency and energy efficiency around 95-98% and 50-52%, respectively. It was found that using Ni-foam reinforced BF air electrode structure further improved the stability of the electrode, especially for the OER. Performance degradation of approximately 1.5% and 15% were observed for the OER and the ORR, respectively over a test period of 300 h. The electrode performance degradation was explained due to KOH wetting-through the backing layer causing electrode flooding. Active SSC material de-binding and carbon support oxidation were also observed in this study.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2352-152X			WOS:000451147100050

Herein, a high-valence-state two-dimension (2D) NiFe phosphonate-based (NiFeP) nanoribbons catalyst has been constructed through a one-step solvothermal process. The NiFeP nanoribbons exhibit highly active in both photocatalytic and electrocatalytic water oxidation due to the 2D nanoribbons and high-valence Ni3+ sites. The 2D nanoribbons not only provide more reactive sites for OER but also shorten bulk diffusion distance with better photoexcited carrier transport from the interior to the surface. Meanwhile, the existence of high-valence Ni3+ could be acted as an efficient redox site to reduce the overpotential and facilitate the catalytic reaction. In consequence, the NiFeP nanoribbons catalyst demonstrates a superior O-2 yield of 65.7% and O-2 production rate of 25.97 umol s(-1) g(-1), which are comparable or even much higher than those other reported transition metal oxide photocatalysts. At last, the possible proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism is also proposed. This study not only demonstrates the potential of a low-cost metal phosphonate OER catalyst but also provides a referential system for the fabrication of high activity and stability catalysts toward replacing noble metals for energy storage and conversion.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000604811500001

Herein, a hierarchical porous double-shelled (Mg,Co)(3)O-4 electrocatalyst with controllable Mg substitution is synthesized via a proposed in situ coordinating process. The hierarchical porosity optimizes the availability of active sites and broadens diffusion channels for oxygen species. Meanwhile, Mg substitution greatly increases electrical conductivity and realizes novel insight of tailoring lattice alkalinity. Specifically, Mg substitution positively influences oxygen electrocatalysis by inducing lattice buffer zones that promote hydroxyl detachment from nearby catalytic sites. As a result, the final hybrid of (Mg,Co)(3)O-4 encapsulated in N-doped graphitized carbon affords superior bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activities, outperforming state-of-the-art noble-metal benchmarks. When serving as an air electrode in Zn-air batteries, a low charge-discharge gap and long-term cyclability for over 200 h are realized in ambient air.									66	2	0	0	4	0	67			2380-8195			WOS:000417888400010

Efficient interface engineering between MXene and highly active electrocatalytic species (CoS2) is, herein, achieved by an in situ hydrothermal growth and facile sulfurization process. The CoS2@MXene electrocatalyst is composed by one-dimensional CoS2 nanowires and two-dimensional MXene nanosheets, which lead to a hierarchical structure (large specific surface area and abundant active sites), a spatial electron redistribution (high intrinsic activity), and high anchoring strength (superior performance stability). Therefore, the electrocatalyst achieves enhanced catalytic activity and long-time stability for ORR (a half-wave potential of 0.80 V), OER (an overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), i.e., eta(10) = 270 mV) and HER (eta(10) = 175 mV). Furthermore, the asymmetry water splitting system based on the CoS2@MXene composites delivers a low overall voltage of 1.63 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The solid-state zinc-air batteries using CoS2@MXene as the air cathode display a small charge-discharge voltage gap (0.53 V at 1 mA cm(-2)) and superior stability (60 circles and 20-h continuous test). The energy interconversion between the chemical energy and electricity can be achieved by a self-powered system via integrating the water splitting system and quasi-solid-state zinc-air batteries. Supported by in situ Raman analyses, the formation of cobalt oxyhydroxide species provides the active sites for water oxidation. This study paves a promising avenue for the design and application of multifunctional nanocatalysts.									18	2	0	0	0	0	18			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000634325700008

The CoS2 core with a high work function (similar to 5.5 eV) tends to capture electrons from the NGC layer (4.5-5.2 eV) to induce an electron-poor NGC shell with a significant downshift of the carbon Fermi level, facilitating the adsorption of O-containing intermediates and affording decreased activation energy during the OER process. As a result, the three-dimensional NGC encapsulated CoS2 array assembly exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER activity with a low overpotential of 243 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 71 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH. Our findings may suggest that manipulating the interface energetics by the work function difference is a potential route to the design of high-performance OER electrocatalysts.									46	3	0	0	3	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526953200034

The selective synthesis of H2O2 from water and oxygen is considered to be a secure and energy-efficient production method, yet the design of ideal electrocatalysts with the desired activity, selectivity and stability remains challenging. Recent progress in the development of highly selective and active carbon-based catalysts is summarized, including the design principles for active catalysts, tailoring active sites on the catalyst surface, and catalyst structure engineering. Fundamental principles of oxygen reduction reaction mechanisms are presented. Novel strategies, including heteroatom doping, surface/interface engineering, and supported single metal atoms, are highlighted. We believe that by appropriately changing the components and engineering the microenvironment of the active sites, the rational design of efficient catalysts with long-term stability can be achieved, bridging the gap between theoretical prediction and experimental observation. Finally, prospects for future research are provided.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1007-8827	1872-5805		WOS:000780149400011		
J	Godinez-Salomon, Jose Fernando; Ospina-Acevedo, Francisco; Albiter, Luis A.; Bailey, Kathleen O.; Naymik, Zachary G.; Mendoza-Cruz, Ruben; Balbuena, Perla B.; Rhodes, Christopher P.								Titanium Substitution Effects on the Structure, Activity, and Stability of Nanoscale Ruthenium Oxide Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts: Experimental and Computational Study								ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS				5	8			11752	11775		10.1021/acsanm.2c02760		JUL 2022		AUG 26 2022	2022	Proton-exchange membrane water electrolyzers produce hydrogen from water and electricity and can be powered using renewable energy; however, the high overpotential, high cost, and limited supply of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst are key factors that hinder wide-scale adoption. Ruthenium oxide (RuO2) has a lower overpotential, lower cost, and higher global supply compared with iridium oxide (IrO2), but RuO2 is less stable than IrO2. As an approach to improve the catalytic stability, we report the effect of titanium substitution at different concentrations within nanoscale RuO2, Ru1-xTixO2 (x = 0-50 at. %), on the structure, OER activity, and stability using combined experiments and theory. Titanium substitution within rutile RuO2 affects the electronic structure, resulting in regions of electron accumulation and electron depletion at the surface, and shifts the d -band and O 2p band centers to higher binding energies. Calculations show that the effects of Ti on the electronic structure are highly dependent on not only the concentration but also the specific dopant location. From electrochemical testing and analysis of the electrolyte and simulations, titanium substitution at low concentrations (12.5 and 20 at. %) improves catalyst stability and lowers Ru dissolution. Experiments of OER activity agree with the theory that Ti substitution results in a higher overpotential when averaging over all adsorption sites. Theoretical analysis shows that specific sites predominately act as catalytic sites for the OER, while metal dissolution occurs at different sites. Specifically, OER has the lowest barriers at penta-coordinated Ru sites, while hexa-coordinated Ru sites have the lowest energetic barriers for dissolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2574-0970		WOS:000835262800001

Herein, we develop a general strategy to boost the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) performance of TMCs by designing monolith electrocatalyst architectures. The monoliths comprises of TMCs integrated on carbon fiber cloth core-shell (CFC@EC) structure. The CFC@EC allows the creation of numerous lattice distortions and strong electronic interactions between CFC@EC and metal cations of the TMCs. Such lattice distortions exposes more active sites in CFC@EC/TMCs compared to the pristine CFC coated TMCs (CFC/TMC). Cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanowires and NiFe-LDH coated on CFC@EC exhibits the optimized HER and OER activities. Overall water splitting device assembled based on the optimized HER and OER electrodes also achieve low overall potential of 1.53 V at 10 mA cm-2. More importantly, we further experimentally verify that the integration of Ni3N and Ni3S2, CoS2, NiCo-LDH, NiMn-LDH with CFC@EC also reveal similar improved performance, providing a general and valuable strategy into the design of other selfsupporting electrocatalysts for water splitting and beyond.									88	2	0	0	10	0	88			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000684284500002

Herein, a general and straightforward method is developed to prepare 3D hierarchical nanoporous V2O3 nanosheets anchored with different alloy nanoparticles by adopting metal-ion-doped zinc-vanadium (oxy)hydroxides as precursors. To demonstrate this concept, we produced nanoporous V2O3 nanosheets dotted with NiFe alloy nanoparticles through high-temperature reduction and free corrosion. Due to the increased number of active sites, accelerated mass transfer originating from the designed nanoporous architecture, and the metallic property of the V2O3 matrix, the NiFe@V2O3 hybrid exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performances for both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. When adopting the NiFe@V2O3 as a bifunctional electrode for overall water splitting, it only requires a cell voltage of 1.56 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2). This work provides a general and practical way to prepare high-efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000492802100040	31560204

The morphology of the electrode was investigated according to the composition of solution, and the electrocatalytic properties were characterized. The usage of GO highly enhanced the electrochemical surface area of the electrode (by similar to 6 times).

Initially, NiFe2O4 nanotubes (NiFe2O4 NTs) with charming properties could act as catalytically promoted sensing platform. This NiFe2O4 NTs based platform could trigger an intense ECL emission of DBAE for the reason that NiFe2O4 NTs not only achieved the high loading of Envision-Ab(1) complex but effectively catalyzed the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to yield oxygen. Moreover, the Envision complex, a polymeric material containing enrich horseradish peroxidase (HRP) could further accelerate the H2O2 decomposition to generate superoxide (O-2(center dot-)) for the enhancement of the ECL emission process of two luminophors. It's noteworthy that hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (h-BN) as the nanolabels, was first illustrated to be capable of immobilizing a large quantity of lucigenin and retaining intense and stable ECL emission of lucigenin in the alkaline condition. Benefiting from the above merits, a new ECL ratiometric sensing mode was established for the sensitive determination of HE4 in a range from 10 fg/mL to 10 ng/mL with the detection limit of 3.3 fg/mL. The strategy exhibited broad prospect in early ovarian cancer diagnosis and blazed a new path for other tumors screening.									27	1	0	0	8	0	28			0925-4005			WOS:000462468000011

The formation of the meso-MoS2/CoMo2S4 heterostructures is based on the sophisticated coassembly of dithiooxamide and metal precursors (i.e., Co2+, PMo12), which are subsequently annealed in nitrogen atmosphere to generate the mesoporous material. Decomposing the polymer leaves behind mesopores throughout the spherical MoS2/CoMo2S4 hybrid particles, generating numerous electrochemical active sites in a network of pores that enable faster charge transfer and mass/gas diffusion that enhance the electrocatalytic performance of MoS2/CoMo2S4. Doping the spherical meso-MoS2/CoMo2S4 heterostructures with iron improves the electronic properties of the hybrid meso-Fe-MoS2/CoMo2S4 material and consequently results in its superior electrochemical activities for both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction.									96	3	0	0	4	0	98			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000529895500036	32191030

The current study investigates a Li-promoted LaxSr2-xFeO4-delta (LaSrFe) redox catalyst for CL-ODH reactions. While LaSrFe without Li promoter exhibits low ethylene selectivity, addition of Li leads to high selectivity/yield and good regenerability. Up to 61% ethane conversion and 90% ethylene selectivity are achieved with Li-promoted LaSrFe. Further characterization indicates that the Li-promoted LaSrFe redox catalyst consists of LiFeO2 (disordered rock salt) and LaSrFe (Ruddlesden-Popper) phases. Moreover, the surface of the redox catalysts is enriched with Li cations. It is also determined the LaSrFe phase contributes to oxygen storage and donation, whereas the activity and selectivity of the redox catalysts are modified by the Li promoter: while oxygen for the CL-ODH reaction is supplied from the lattice of the LaSrFe phase, the enrichment of Li cations on the surface increases the resistance for O2- diffusion from the bulk and its subsequent evolution into electrophilic oxygen species on the surface. The nonselective nature of the surface oxygen species and the inhibition effects of Li promoter on O2- diffusion are further confirmed by pulse experiments. On the basis of such findings, it is concluded that Li-promoted LaxSr2-xFeO4-delta is an effective redox catalyst for ethane ODH in the absence of gaseous oxygen. Moreover, the selectivity of the redox catalysts can be enhanced by the alkali metal oxide promoters.									67	3	0	0	3	0	69			2155-5435			WOS:000387306100004

However, its widespread applications are significantly prohibited by the low reductivity and high cost of support. To overcome these shortcomings, a porous carbon (PC) is herein developed as a promising matrix for the electroless deposition of metal NPs. Benefiting from abundant oxygen-based surface functional groups, the PC shows stronger reducibility (low redox potential) than conventional carbon substrate such as carbon nanotubes or graphene oxide, enabling a facile electroless deposition of Ir, Rh, and Ru NPs on its surface. These SMNPs exhibit an impressive electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). For example, the Rh NP/PC can deliver an HER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small overpotential of 21 mV in 0.5 m H2SO4, while the Ru NP/PC exhibits excellent HOR activity in 0.1 m KOH in terms of high mass and surface specific exchange current density of 263 A g(Ru)(-1) and 0.227 mA cm(Ru)(-2). The present strategy may open up opportunities for mass production of efficient supported NPs for diverse applications.									73	5	0	0	7	0	74			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000495097700001	31701640

Maintaining low power consumption while increasing the number of oxidation intermediates is deserving of exploring. Herein, Ti/SnO2-Sb/Zr0.3Ir0.7O2 was prepared by Zr doped into IrO2 and used for Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation. The addition of Zr significantly increased the electrochemically active area and facilitated the catalyst to degrade SMX dramatically at a lower overpotential. The extremely outstanding lifetime of catalysts can reach 800 h during the accelerated life test, which showed excellent stability and developmental prospects. The overpotential at 10 mA.cm(-2) is about 329 mV, indicating that this electrode has a high oxygen evolution reaction activity. Furthermore, the electrical efficiency per log order for the electrode is only 8.50 kW h m(-3) at 4 V.

The pursuit of high-performance carbons demand for high-level doping, large surface area and high graphitization, but the improvement of the former two aspects would inevitably impair the third one, which seems a contradictive proposition. Herein, by a facile "mix-and-pyrolyze" method, natural DNA was first developed to synthesize N, P, S-tridoped carbons (NPSC) with porous sheet structures, high graphitization, large surface areas and abundant high-quality dopants simultaneously. Thus, the newly-prepared NPSC displays superior alkaline ORR performance comparable to Pt/C together with excellent acidic activity and better stability. Meanwhile, NPSC is one of most active acidic HER catalysts and the best alkaline HER catalyst among carbon counterparts. Density function theory computation reveled the origins of superior performance are attributed to positively charged C sites neighboring to S for ORR and P sites for HER because of DNA-derived advantaged structural features. The as-fabricated rechargeable zinc-air battery based on current tridoped carbon has closed peak power density and specific capacity but much better charge-discharge stability compared with Pt/C.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000728401400004

In this work, we explore several Ru-based pyrochlores (A(2)Ru(2)O(7), A = Y, Nd, Gd, Bi) as OER catalysts and demonstrate improved activity and stability of catalytic Ru sites relative to RuO2. Furthermore, we combine complementary experimental and theoretical analysis to understand how the A-site element impacts activity and stability under acidic OER conditions. Among the A(2)Ru(2)O(7) studied herein, we find that a longer Ru-O bond and a weaker interaction of the Ru 4d and O 2p orbitals compared with RuO2 results in enhanced initial activity. We observe that the OER activity of the catalysts changes over time and is accompanied by both A-site and Ru dissolution at different relative rates depending on the identity of the A-site. Pourbaix diagrams constructed using density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a driving force for this experimentally observed dissolution, indicating that all compositions studied herein are thermodynamically unstable in acidic OER conditions. Theoretical activity predictions show consistent trends between A-site cation leaching and OER activity. These trends coupled with Bader charge analysis suggest that dissolution exposes highly oxidized Ru sites that exhibit enhanced activity. Overall, using the stability number (mol(O2 evolved)/mol(Ru dissolved)) as a comparative metric, the A(2)Ru(2)O(7) materials studied in this work show substantially greater stability than a standard RuO2 and commensurate stability to some Ir mixed metal oxides. The insights described herein provide a pathway to enhanced Ru catalyst activity and durability, ultimately improving the efficiency of water electrolyzers.									38	1	0	0	2	0	38			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200044

Mathematical models of hypoxia based on reaction-diffusion equations provide seemingly incomplete descriptions as they fail to predict the measured oxygen concentrations in the tumour microenvironment. In an attempt to explain the discrepancies, we consider both the inhomogeneous distribution of oxygen-consuming cells in solid tumours and the dynamics of blood flow in the tumour microcirculation. We find that the low-frequency oscillations play an important role in the establishment of tumour hypoxia. The oscillations interact with consumption to inhibit oxygen diffusion in the microenvironment. This suggests that alpha-blockers-a class of drugs used to treat hypertension and stress disorders, and known to lower or even abolish low-frequency oscillations of arterial blood flow -may act as adjuvant drugs in the radiotherapy of solid tumours by enhancing the oxygen effect.									14	0	0	0	11	0	14			2045-2322			WOS:000391148500001	28045083

Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a half reaction of water splitting, is crucial to the low-cost production of pure H2 fuels but necessitates the use of electrocatalysts to expedite reaction kinetics. Owing to the availability of low-cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for the counter electrode in alkaline media and the lack of low-cost OER catalysts in acidic media, researchers have focused on developing HER catalysts in alkaline media with high activity and stability. Nickel is well-known as an HER catalyst and continuous efforts have been undertaken to improve Ni-based catalysts as alkaline electrolyzers. In this review, we summarize earlier studies of HER activity and mechanism on Ni surfaces, along with recent progress in the optimization of the Ni-based catalysts using various modern techniques. Recently developed Ni-based HER catalysts are categorized according to their chemical nature, and the advantages as well as limitations of each category are discussed. Among all Ni-based catalysts, Ni-based alloys and Ni-based hetero-structure exhibit the most promising electrocatalytic activity and stability owing to the fine-tuning of their surface adsorption properties via a synergistic nearby element or domain. Finally, selected applications of the developed Ni-based HER catalysts are highlighted, such as water splitting, the chloralkali process, and microbial electrolysis cell.									537	39	0	0	24	1	543			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000371797800003

In the H-type reactor, hydrogen and oxygen could be evolved separately. Different kinds of materials were deposited on the bottom cell to prevent corrosion. These materials include silver, platinum, and iron oxide layers which were prepared via an electron beam-induced deposition (EBID) method. Under visible-light irradiation, hydrogen production was achieved by using the MJSC; however, only a small amount of oxygen was evolved. The photogenerated holes may oxidize the photoelectrode instead of water, meaning that Ge subcell or the deposited thin film was oxidized during the photoreaction. The thin films ranked from highest hydrogen evolution to lowest are: Pt > bare Ge > Fe3O4 > Ag. The photoelectrode deposited with metal thin film showed better activity due to its higher conductivity, except Ag. The poor performance of photoelectrode with silver thin film was due to the formation of silver oxide during photoreaction which may trap electrons, lowering the amount of electrons available to carry out water reduction. The chemical bias for H-type reactor system was eliminated by using sodium sulfate as the electrolyte. The ratio of evolved hydrogen to oxygen was near 2:1, suggesting that real water-splitting reaction can be achieved by using the MJSC incorporated H-type reactor system without chemical bias.

J	Junge, Wolfgang								Oxygenic photosynthesis: history, status and perspective								QUARTERLY REVIEWS OF BIOPHYSICS				52						e1	10.1017/S0033583518000112				JAN 23 2019	2019	Cyanobacteria and plants carry out oxygenic photosynthesis. They use water to generate the atmospheric oxygen we breathe and carbon dioxide to produce the biomass serving as food, feed, fibre and fuel. This paper scans the emergence of structural and mechanistic understanding of oxygen evolution over the past 50 years. It reviews speculative concepts and the stepped insight provided by novel experimental and theoretical techniques. Driven by sunlight photosystem II oxidizes the catalyst of water oxidation, a hetero-metallic Mn4CaO5(H2O)(4) cluster. Mn3Ca are arranged in cubanoid and one Mn dangles out. By accumulation of four oxidizing equivalents before initiating dioxygen formation it matches the four-electron chemistry from water to dioxygen to the one-electron chemistry of the photo-sensitizer. Potentially harmful intermediates are thereby occluded in space and time. Kinetic signatures of the catalytic cluster and its partners in the photo-reaction centre have been resolved, in the frequency domain ranging from acoustic waves via infra-red to X-ray radiation, and in the time domain from nano- to milli-seconds. X-ray structures to a resolution of 1.9 angstrom are available. Even time resolved X-ray structures have been obtained by clocking the reaction cycle by flashes of light and diffraction with femtosecond X-ray pulses. The terminal reaction cascade from two molecules of water to dioxygen involves the transfer of four electrons, two protons, one dioxygen and one water. A rigorous mechanistic analysis is challenging because of the kinetic enslaving at millisecond duration of six partial reactions (4e(-), 1H(+), 1O(2)). For the time being a peroxide-intermediate in the reaction cascade to dioxygen has been in focus, both experimentally and by quantum chemistry. Homo sapiens has relied on burning the products of oxygenic photosynthesis, recent and fossil. Mankind's total energy consumption amounts to almost one-fourth of the global photosynthetic productivity. If the average power consumption equalled one of those nations with the highest consumption per capita it was four times greater and matched the total productivity. It is obvious that biomass should be harvested for food, feed, fibre and platform chemicals rather than for fuel.									38	2	1	0	20	0	39			0033-5835	1469-8994		WOS:000458566400001	30670110

The one-dimensional of carbon nanofibers with tubular structure can effectively promote the electrocatalytic activity, which facilitates electron transport.

Long-term ORR testing indicated that the durability of this catalyst was superior to that of commercial Pt/C in alkaline electrolyte. According to RRDE test, the ORR reaction process of Pt-Fe/CNFs-900 was close to fourelectron transfer routes. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a direct Z-scheme g-C3N4/MoO3 photocatalytic composite with oxygen vacancies is successfully fabricated via a facile in situ method of a one-pot pyrolysis strategy. The as-prepared g-C3N4/MoO3 possesses a porous architecture with increased specific surface area. The existence of an oxygen vacancy in MoO3 is verified by XPS, UV-DRS analysis and electrochemical measurements. The g-C3N4/MoO3 exhibits superior visible-light photocatalytic performance for water splitting, as evidenced by an about 17-fold (20.52 mu mol h(-1)) increase in the rate of H-2 evolution relative to pristine C3N4 (1.23 mu mol h(-1) ). According to the characterization results and boosted photocatalytic performance, the migration and separation of photoinduced charge carriers in g-C3N4/MoO3 follows a possible mechanism based on a Z-scheme photocatalytic system constructed by the oxygen vacancies. The O-vacancy functions as the recombination and storage center for fast charge transfer through two components. The combined effect of defective MoO3 and a Z-scheme interfacial heterojunction has achieved greatly enhanced photocatalytic performance. This work demonstrates the facilitation effect of an effective Z-scheme system involving oxygen vacancies on the charge transfer to enhance the photocatalytic activity for water splitting.									16	0	0	0	3	0	16			2052-1553			WOS:000627404600004

Characterization of Ir-based catalysts using SEM, TEM, XRD, CO chemisorption and XPS, and reaction studies on various Ir-based catalysts have proved that the formation of a relatively large Ir metal particle with 40-60 nm of nanocrystal size carried on inert supports has been a prerequisite for the evolution of high activities in the NOx reduction rather than the formation of Lr metal state on the catalyst. Furthermore, in inert gas conditions in a high temperature range of 850-950 degrees C, Ir metal was easily formed by using the support such as TiO2 and ZrO2 that drastically decreased its specific sui;face area in the temperature range.

Analysis of pulsed excimer laser ablation of PZT, Pb and Ti in an oxygen ambient using energy dispersive mass spectrometry								Ferroelectric Thin Films V. Symposium								225	30						1995	1995	A number of factors have been identified as affecting the gas phase oxidation of cations during pulsed laser ablation of lead zirconate titanate (PZT), by using energy dispersive mass spectrometry (EDMS). These phenomena are known to be critical to the deposition of high quality thin films of PZT. However, to isolate the role of each cation species and the influence of its gas phase properties, we have also looked beyond the ablation of the PZT ceramic. In this paper, we detail our observations during pulsed laser ablation of electroceramic and metallic targets, specifically PZT, Pb and Ti. We have observed the evolution and transport of molecular species during gas phase expansion over a wide range of oxygen pressures (10-7-10-1 mbar) and laser fluences (0.3-10 Jcm-2). The yields of the molecular ion species are strongly dependent upon the number density of the background gas. We propose an interpretation of the relative yields of the species based upon their respective gas phase binding energies and their ease of formation based upon the reaction thermodynamics and reaction cross-section of each species.

After a short introduction into the state of the art about 35 years ago, results are reviewed that led to identification of the essential cofactors of this process and the kinetics of their reactions. Special emphasis is paid on the flash induced oxygen measurements performed by Pierre Joliot ( in Paris, France) and Bessel Kok ( Baltimore, MD) and their coworkers that led to the scheme, known as the Kok-cycle. These findings not only unraveled the reaction pattern of oxidation steps leading from water to molecular oxygen but also provided the essential fingerprint as prerequisite for studying individual redox reactions. Starting with the S. Singer and G. Nicolson model of membrane organization, attempts were made to gain information on the structure of the Photsystem II complex that eventually led to the current stage of knowledge based on the recently published X-ray crystal structure of 3.8 Angstrom resolution in Berlin (Germany). With respect to the mechanism of water oxidation, the impact of Gerald T. Babcock's hydrogen abstractor model and all the considerations of electron/proton transfer coupling are outlined. According to my own model cosiderations, the protein matrix is not only a 'cofactor holder' but actively participates by fine tuning via hydrogen bond networks, playing most likely an essential role in water substrate coordination and in oxygen-oxygen bond formation as the key step of the overall process.									24	0	0	0	13	0	24			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000184422000026	16228587

A porous silicon and nitrogen co-doped carbon (SiNC) nanomaterial by a facile pyrolyzation was developed as a metal-free bifunctional electrocatalyst. CO2-to-CO and oxygen evolution (OER) partial current density under neutral conditions were enhanced by two orders of magnitude in the Tafel regime on SiNC relative to single-doped comparisons beyond their specific area gap. The photovoltaic-driven CO2 splitting device with SiNC electrodes imitating photosynthesis yielded an overall solar-to-chemical efficiency of advanced 12.5% (by multiplying energy efficiency of CO2 splitting cell and photovoltaic device) at only 650mV overpotential. Mechanism studies suggested the elastic electron structure of -Si(O)-C-N- unit in SiNC as the highly active site for CDRR and OER simultaneously by lowering the free energy of CDRR and OER intermediates adsorption.									49	9	0	0	5	0	50			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000445445700022	30126074

When applied for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the onset potential and half-wave potential are 0.96 V and 0.86 V in 0.1 M KOH, comparable to that of the commercial 10 wt% Pt/C. Moreover, the hybrids possess higher stability and better methanol tolerance. Additionally, the Tafel slope of N-CNTs/E-NNPs is 76 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 M KOH, lower than 83 mV dec(-1) of the commercial 10 wt% Pt/C, demonstrating a good kinetic process. The remarkable features are mainly ascribed to synergistic enhancement effect from N-rich doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) and embedded Ni-based nanoparticles on the top, promoting mass and electrons transport, enhancing the activity of active sites and making it a promising highly efficient non-precious metal ORR catalyst.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000486857700001

In this work, copper oxide (CuO/Cu2O) nanoparticles are integrated with cobalt-manganese layered double hydroxide (CoMn-LDH) to enhance their performance towards OER. The catalyst is synthesized by growing CoMn-LDH nanosheets in the presence of CuO/Cu2O nanoparticles that were obtained by the calcination of the copper containing metal-organic framework (HKUST-1). The synthesized CoMn-LDH@CuO/Cu2O electrocatalyst shows excellent activity towards OER with an overpotential of 297 mV at a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and have a Tafel slope value of 89 mV dec(-1). Moreover, a slight decrease in the performance parameters is observed until the 15 h of continuous operation. We propose that the conductive strength of CuO/Cu2O and its synergistic effect with the CoMn-LDH are responsible for the improved OER performance of the desired electrocatalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000870372200001	36320723

Although Fe is much more abundant and cheaper, full-Fe or Fe-rich catalysts suffer from insufficient activity. Herein, we discover that Se-doping can drastically promote OER on FeOOH and develop a facile on-site electrochemical activation strategy for achieving such a Se-doped FeOOH electrode via an FeSe precatalyst. Theoretical analysis and systematic experiments prove that Se-doping enables FeOOH as an efficient and low-cost OER electrocatalyst. By optimizing the electrode structure, an industrial-level OER current output of 500 mA cm(-2) is secured at a low overpotential of 348 mV. The application of such an Fe-rich OER electrode in a practical solar-driven water splitting system demonstrates a high and stable solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 18.55%, making the strategy promising for exploring new cost-effective and highly active electrocatalysts for clean hydrogen production.									294	20	0	0	8	0	297			0002-7863			WOS:000466987900032	30933480

Several first-row (3d) transition metal-based catalysts have been developed for the OER; however, these catalysts still require operating voltages that lie well above the fundamental thermodynamic potential. Here, we report high-valence metal molybdenum (Mo6+) modulated 3d metal (oxy) hydroxides. The obtained multimetal FeCoMo based OER catalysts require an overpotential of 277 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) on the glassy carbon electrode, and there was no evidence of degradation for about 40 hours of stability testing. The catalysts stay in their amorphous phases, potentially with atomically homogenous metal distribution. The in situ X-ray adsorption analysis unambiguously reveals the tuned electronic structures of the 3d metals owing to Mo6+, further demonstrating the modification effect of a high-valence metal for designing highly-efficient OER catalysts.									89	2	0	0	7	0	89			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000400553000021	28507721

The diamond thin film electrodes with different B-doped mass concentrations were deposited on the tantalum substrate by the hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) system. The surface morphology of the thin films was analyzed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) , and the electrochemical properties of the electrodes were studied by cyclic voltammetry. The results show that the film electrode has the best quality, the largest grain size, and the potential window of 3.99 V when the B-doped mass concentration is 2 g/L. With the increase of the B-doped mass concentration, the particle size decreases, the film quality becomes worse, and the potential window decreases gradually. The oxygen evolution potential of the BDD electrode in acid, salt and alkaline solutions are 2.11, 1.82 and 0.86 V, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1671-4776			INSPEC:17228315

We present a model showing that such an electrical field may form as a result of the different diffusion rates of the positive and negative charge carriers through a growing mixed-ionic-electronic-conducting oxide shell. Simulations of the evolution of the electric charge carriers and temporal potential distribution reveal that three key parameters affect the voltage formation. The ratio of the characteristic oxygen ion diffusion rate within the particle to the maximum oxygen transport rate to the particle surface affects the formation of a diffusion layer and the carrier distributions inside the oxide shell. The ratio between the thickness of an exterior oxide layer, formed before the reaction has started, and the Debye screening length has a strong impact on the amplitude and temporal evolution of the voltage. The thinner this initial oxide shell is, the larger is the voltage amplitude. The ratio between the diffusion coefficients of the positive and negative charge carriers determines the sign of the excess electrical charge on the surface.

Most catalysts suffer from severe structural corrosion that becomes even more pronounced at fluctuating potentials. Herein, MnCo based cubic particles were prepared via a hydrothermal approach, in which the edge length of the micron-sized particles can be controlled by changing the pH value of the precursor solution. The cubes are composed of varying amounts of MnCo2O4, CoCO3 and a mixed (Mn/Co)CO3 phase. Structure-activity relationships were deduced revealing a volcano-type behavior for the intrinsic OER activity and fraction of spinel oxide phase. A low overpotential of 0.37 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a stability of more than 25 h was achieved in 1.0 M KOH using a rotating disc electrode (RDE) setup. The best performing catalyst material was successfully tested under dynamic process conditions for 9.5 h and shows a superior catalytic activity as anode for the overall water splitting in an electrolyser setup in 1.0 M KOH at 333 K compared to a reference NiCo-spinel catalyst.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000704747400001

By controllably calcining the metal (M = Co2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, or Cu2+) ammonium phosphates (NH4MPO4 center dot H2O), the corresponding nitrogen-doped metal (M = Co2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, or Cu2+) phosphate (N-MPO) were obtained. The nitrogen content of these materials can be controlled by varying the calcination temperature. Interestingly, the obtained amorphous nitrogen-doped cobalt phosphate (A-NCoPO) with a porous structure showed extraordinary and lasting properties for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). At 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential was 181 mV, and the Tafel slope was 94 mV dec(-1). The effect of calcination temperature on the various materials was compared and analyzed. The experimental results demonstrated that the nitrogen-doped cobalt phosphate calcined at 400 degrees C can promote catalytic activity by increasing the electronic conductivity and OH- adsorption strength owing to the disordered crystal structure and nitrogen doping. Using a simple synthesis strategy, A-NCoPO retains the structural advantages of transition metal phosphate and shows a fascinating potential as an OER catalyst with favorable stability.									11	3	0	0	1	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000624638900002

It usually lies in interface modification for improving intrinsic activity of active sites, and structural optimization for facilitating mass transport. Herein, we rationally design a series of carbon-based hierarchical architectures as bifunctional electrocatalysts through control pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks coated layered double hydroxide nanoplatelets. Three kinds of catalysts with hierarchical structures are produced, nanoparticles dispersed on carbonized metal oxide nanosheets, carbon nanotubes vertically grown on carbonized metal oxide nanosheets, and carbon nanosheets vertically grown on carbonized metal oxide nanosheets. Among them, the carbon nanotubes vertically grown on carbonized metal oxide nanosheets electrocatalyst possesses the highest electrochemical surface area, lowest charge-transfer resistance, and the fast mass transfer rate, owing to its unique hierarchical porous structure. These properties lead to excellent catalytic activities for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions in terms of half-wave potential (835 mV) and low overpotential (280 mV), which make it a significant electrocatalyst for zinc-air batteries with respectable discharge-charge performance, peak power density (235 mW cm(-2)), specific capacitance (875 mAh g(-1)) and better stability than precious metal catalysts.									34	1	0	0	2	0	35			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000490030800042

The synthesis of water oxidation electrocatalysts which are low-cost, earth-abundant and highly efficient is an important prerequisite for the release of hydrogen from water under mild conditions for practical applications. In this article, we have designed and investigated a 3D hybrid Co3O4@Ni3S2/NF composite via successive hydrothermal and calcination methods for the first time, in which Ni3S2 nanosheets coated on Co3O4 nanoneedle arrays with unique hierarchically porous morphology were directly grown on nickel foam. Due to the positive synergistic effect of the 1D Co3O4 nanoneedles and the 2D Ni3S2 nanosheets, the hybrid Co3O4@Ni3S2/NF composite can be considered to be an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst with an overpotential of 260 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. The combination of Co3O4 and in situ formed -Ni(OH)(2) on the surface of Ni3S2 nanosheets during the OER resulted in dramatic electrocatalyst performance and excellent stability, providing a novel approach for the design of an effective and efficient OER electrode.									88	2	0	0	0	0	88			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000428089500019

Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) exhibit promising electrocatalytic performance for the OER. However, their electrical conductivity and active sites should be increased for the preparation of more effective OER electrocatalysts based on LDHs for large-scale applications. Herein, we demonstrate a facile and practical pathway for the hierarchical fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) porous sulphur incorporated NiCoFe LDH nanosheets (S-NiCoFe LDH) on carbon cloth (CC). The as-obtained hierarchically structured S-NiCoFe LDH electrode shows superb electrocatalytic activity and stability for the OER, requiring overpotentials as low as 206 mV and 258 mV to achieve current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution, respectively, making S-NiCoFe LDH one of the most efficient low-cost electrocatalysts for the OER. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance is attributed to the unique 3D hierarchical nanostructure and sulphur doping, which endow the self-supported S-NiCoFe LDH electrode with abundant active sites and superb electrical conductivity. The strategy expands the possibilities for boosting the catalytic activity of LDH-based OER electrocatalysts.									135	7	0	0	2	0	136			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000425302700041

Herein, an effective strategy of tailoring IrO2@TiN1+x nano-heterojunctions by defects is reported, aiming at enhancing the intrinsic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of IrO2 at a low Ir amount. A remarkable OER activity in an acidic solution is achieved for IrO2@TiN1+x with 7.3 times of mass activity and 1.8 times of specific activity relative to IrO2. As the anode electrode in a PEM single cell, IrO2@TiN1+x also reveals the optimal activity with 1.916 V at 2 A cm(-2), which is 57 mV and 130 mV lower than that of IrO2@TiN and IrO2, respectively. Meantime, the IrO2@TiN1+x electrode manifests good stability at 1 A cm(-2) for 100 h. Electrochemical characterization analysis and DFT calculation results indicate that the increase in the number of active sites and the modulating electronic interaction between IrO2 and TiN1+x could multiply the active sites and accelerate the OER kinetics of IrO2. Thus, the IrO2@TiN1+x nano-heterostructure reveals superior electrocatalytic performance and good stability at a low Ir content.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2052-1537		WOS:000708143300001

Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia is of great interest from the points of environmental protection and energy saving. However, the development of this technology is hindered by the lack of efficient nitrate-to-ammonia electrocatalysts and the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction at the anode. Herein, a novel self-template conversion method was developed for the synthesis of Co3O4@NiO hierarchical nanotubes (Co3O4@NiO HNTs) with NiO porous nanosheets assembled on Co(3)O(4)nanotubes. The as-obtained Co3O4@NiO HNTs exhibited an outstanding performance for both the cathodic nitrate electroreduction to ammonia reaction and the anodic tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) semi-dehydrogenation to dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs). Importantly, a two-electrode system of Co3O4@NiO HNTs parallel to Co3O4@NiO HNTs was constructed for the simultaneous synthesis of ammonia and DHIQs with high selectivity and robust stability.									27	0	0	0	3	0	27			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000545907700002

The growth rate and the rate of photoinhibition were compared using intermittent and equivalent continuous light regimes in small-size (30 ml) bioreactors. The CO2 dependent photosynthetic oxygen evolution rates in the intermittent and continuous light regimes were compared for different light/dark ratios and different mean irradiances. The kinetics of the electron transfer reactions were investigated using a double-modulation fluorometer. The rates of photosynthetic oxygen evolution normalized to equal mean irradiance were lower or equal in the intermittent light compared to the maximum rate found in the equivalent optimal continuous light regime. In contrast, the growth rates in the intermittent light can be higher than the growth rate in the equivalent continuous light. Photoinhibition is presented as an example of a physiological process affecting the growth rate that occurs at different rates in the intermittent and equivalent continuous lights. The difference in the dynamics of the redox state of the plastoquinone pool is proposed to be responsible for the low photoinhibition rates observed in the intermittent light.									102	2	1	0	76	0	105			0921-8971			WOS:A1996WP39700008

Herein, a novel FeCo composite composed of alloy nanoparticles embedded in an N, S dual-doped carbon matrix (FeCo/NSC) was prepared via one-step carbonization of amphiphilic dodecanethiol-metal salts wrapped in carbon nitride (C3N4). The compact combination of dual metal-alloys and dual-doped carbon endowed the composite with the active sites for the ORR and OER, achieving efficient electrical transmission and highly efficient bifunctional catalytic performance. The obtained FeCo-1/NSC catalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.82 V (vs. RHE) for the ORR and a low overpotential of 0.325 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER. The liquid Zn-air battery with FeCo-1/NSC as an air electrode displayed excellent charge-discharge performance, high power density, and robust charge-discharge stability for 150 h compared to the 20% Pt/C + RuO2 counterpart. Furthermore, the FeCo-1/NSC-based flexible solid-state Zn-air battery exhibited a higher power density and good charge-discharge stability over 10 h of operation. Thus, a promising strategy for bifunctional electrocatalyst development as part of rechargeable and wearable Zn-air batteries was provided.

Here we report ultrathin amorphous CoFeP nanosheets derived from CoFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as bifunctional electrocatalysts with a simple phosphorization method. The partial phosphating induced by sodium hypophosphite can greatly reduce the thickness of nanosheets and promote the polycrystalline nature of the materials, leading to more active sites exposed and faster electronic transport. The optimal levels of phosphating agents are 1.8 g for OER and 2.4 g for HER, respectively, etched by which the resultant CoFeP materials can exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performances toward OER, HER and overall water splitting in alkaline media. At the current densities of 100 and 20 mA cm(-2), ultralow overpotentials of 242 and 80 mV are achieved for OER and HER, individually, which are 128 mV lower than RuO2 and 6 mV slightly lower than Pt, respectively. In a cell voltage of 1.62 V, the CoFeP materials reacted with 1.8 and 2.4 g phosphating agents and used as the anode and the cathode, respectively, can achieve 100 mA cm(-2) current density and exhibit extraordinary durability for 30 h in overall water splitting. These superior electrocatalytic properties of ultrathin amorphous CoFeP nanosheets are comparable to those of state-ofthe-art noble metal and other reported catalysts for OER, HER and overall water splitting. This work proposes a promising strategy for excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts by tailoring the morphology and crystallinity degree based on LDHs through a facile partial phosphating method.

Pioneered by Adam Heller, miniaturized enzymatic biofuel cells (mBCs) convert blood sugars into electrical energy by employing for example glucose oxidase (GOx) on the anode and bilirubin oxidase on the cathode. To match application demands it is crucial to increase lifetime and power output of mBCs. The power output has been limited by the performance of GOx on the anode. We developed a glucose oxidase detection assay (GODA) as medium-throughput screening system for improving GOx properties by directed protein evolution. GODA is a reaction product detection assay based on coupled enzymatic reactions leading to NADPH formation which is recorded at 340 nm. The main advantage of the assay is that it detects the production Of D-gluconolactone instead of the side-product hydrogen peroxide and enables to improve bioelectrochemical properties of GOx. For validating the screening system, a mutagenic library of GOx from Aspergillus niger (EC 1.1.3.4) was generated and screened for improved activity using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as host. Directed evolution resulted in a GOx mutant 1115V with 1.4-1.5-fold improved activity for beta-D-glucose (V-max from 7.94 to 10.81 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1); K-m similar to 19-21 mM) and oxygen consumption kinetics correlate well [V-max (O-2) from 5.94 to 8.34 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1); Km (O-2) from 700 to 474 mu M]. The developed mutagenic protocol and GODA represent a proof-of-principle that GOx can be evolved by directed evolution in S. cerevisiae for putative use in biofuel cells. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In this system, the anode typically using Ni and Ni alloys is degraded during the fluctuation of electricity from renewable energy. This degradation is related to the surface hydrous oxide layer which contains Ni(II) and Ni(III). During potential cycling, the hydrous oxide layer grows and increases the electronic resistance due to the redox of Ni(II)/Ni(III) and Ni(III)/Ni(IV). In order to improve the durability and catalytic activity by stabilization of the surface using an electroconductive oxide, a Li (x) Ni2-x O-2/Ni has been developed. The surface oxide was prepared by the oxidation of Ni with a LiOH melt. The Li-doped amount for the surface oxide prepared at 1000 A degrees C was homogeneous with a cubic crystalline structure. On the other hand, the crystalline structure prepared at 800 A degrees C was a mixture of the trigonal and cubic Li-doped NiO phases, which has a high and low Li content, respectively. The oxide layer conductivity increased with the Li-doped amount. The excess Li-doped amount increased not only the conductivity of the oxide layer but also the deactivation of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity. The durability of the Li (x) Ni2-x O-2/Ni under potential cycling was higher than that of Ni for both the OER activity and redox change of Ni(II)/Ni(III) and Ni(III)/Ni(IV).									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000407574700003

Oxygen could be evolved over Cd2SnO4 under the irradiation of Xe-lamp or even visible light (lambda > 420 nm), while the others could only work in the UV-light range. Raman showed the cation distribution in Cd2SnO4 is ordered, while that in the others is disordered. The cations distribution was proposed to be the cause of the difference in photocatalytic O-2-evolution activities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The NixZnyFez-LDHs were then used as the efficient electrocatalyst materials to fabricate the modified carbon paste electrodes (CPEs) for water oxidation in neutral media. The effect of Zn2+ ions on the electrocatalytic activity of the ternary-component NixZnyFez-LDHs modified CPE was studied under suggested optimum condition. In this condition, the ternary-component Ni2Zn0.5Fe-LDH modified CPE displayed improved electrocatalytic activity in comparison with other ternary-component LDHs, and also binary-component LDHs, Ni2Fe-LDH and ZnFe-LDH modified CPEs due to high crystallinity and low band gap energy which enhanced the conductivity of the synthesized LDH. Furthermore, the ternary-component Ni2Zn0.5Fe-LDH modified CPE had good structural stability with no significant deactivation of the electrocatalytic properties in neutral media after 13 h oxygen evolution reaction at room temperature.

Such a process could significantly reduce the cost of generating hydrogen by 1) a low voltage (low energy) anodic oxidation process and 2) generation of value-added chemicals that can be sold. To date, the electrochemical oxidation of large organic molecules like lignin has mainly been investigated on either expensive metals like platinum or on bulk metal electrodes (i.e., large, flat electrodes). Nanoparticle electrocatalysts, though, enhance the surface area available for electrochemical reactions and may lead to improved mass transport of reactants and products through the electrocatalyst layer. In addition, nanoparticle electrocatalysts allow for unique alloying and synergistic effects between different metals. We report here on non-precious metal nanoparticle electrocatalysts for the oxidation of lignin in alkaline media, and show that lignin oxidation occurs at lower voltages than oxygen evolution. Such results are a first step toward demonstrating that lignin oxidation at lower overpotentials than required for oxygen evolution could lead to efficient generation of hydrogen.

The growth mechanisms of these MnO2 nanostructures have been discussed. At 140 degrees C, slim solid alpha-MnO2 nanorods are obtained. At 160 degrees C, the crystal phase begins to transform from alpha-MnO2 to beta-MnO2. And at 180 degrees C, uniformly hollow beta-MnO2 nanorods are formed. The electrocatalytic properties for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of these as-prepared MnO2 samples have been systematically studied in alkaline media. It is obvious that the structure-function relationship of MnO2 samples for OER activity is dependent on the crystallographic structure and morphology, following the order alpha-MnO2 > alpha-MnO2/beta-MnO2 > broken beta-MnO2 > beta-MnO2. The best OER electrocatalyst is alpha-MnO2, with an overpotential of 0.45 V (at j = 10 mA cm(-2)). The enhanced OER activity is owing to not only the highest BET surface area (45.6 m(2) g(-1)), but also the largest electrochemical active surface area (C-dl = 3225.0 mu F cm(-2)). In addition, the intrinsic activity of each Mn atom in alpha-MnO2 (TOF = 0.0056 s(-1) at eta = 0.45 V) is larger than that of beta-MnO2 (TOF = 0.0003 s(-1) at eta = 0.45 V).

In this paper, we synthesized ultrafine Co6Mo6C nanocrystals on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) support (Co6Mo6C/RGO). The Co6Mo6C/RGO shows Pt-like HER performance, which exhibits almost zero onset overpotential, and very small overpotential of 64 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, the Co6Mo6C/RGO has a very small Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1) and a high exchange current density of 0.402 mA cm(-2), suggesting fast reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the Co6Mo6C/RGO demonstrates superior durability in acid electrolyte. The distinguished HER performance makes Co6Mo6C/RGO the promising candidate as non-precious metal catalyst for HER in acid electrolyte. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, the activation process of the key active component Li2MnO3 in Li-rich materials is kinetically slow, and the complex phase transformation with electrode/electrolyte side reactions causes fast capacity/voltage fading. Herein, a simple thermal treatment strategy is reported to simultaneously tackle these challenges. The introduction of a urea thermal treatment on Li-rich material Li1.87Mn0.94Ni0.19O3 leads to oxygen deficiencies and partially reduced Mn ions on the oxide surface for activating the Li-rich phase. In situ synchrotron study confirms that the urea-treated cathode shows much faster Li extraction from both Li and transition metal layers with less oxygen evolution upon charging than that of untreated counterparts. Moreover, the decomposition products of urea during thermal treatment subsequently deposit on the surface of cathode material, leading to a unique passivation layer against side reactions between electrode and electrolyte. Soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals the structural evolution mechanism with a significantly suppressed dissolution of Mn species over cycling measurement. The urea-treated Li1.87Mn0.94Ni0.19O3 shows accelerated activation kinetics to reach high capacity of 270 mA h g(-1) and demonstrates excellent capacity retention of 98.49% over 300 cycles with slower voltage decay.									73	4	0	0	2	0	73			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000512960200001

An important parameter of these anodes is their lifetime under harsh anodic conditions. In this work, the incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles into a thermally prepared IrO2 anode as a way of improving its service lifetime was investigated. The results show that incorporation of up to 25 wt% TiO2 nanoparticles into the coating formed crack-free structure during the thermal decomposition process and thus enhances the service lifetime of modified electrode dramatically by up to 10x compared to the pure IrO2 anode. Importantly, these nanoparticle additions have minimal effect of the anodes performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction. Further addition of TiO2 nanoparticles reduced the lifetime of the anode due to uneven distribution of the active coating over the substrate leading to electrolyte penetration to, and passivation of, the underlying titanium substrate. It is proposed that adding the right quantity of nanoparticles into the IrO2 layer improved the anodes lifetime by minimising electrolyte penetration to the substrate while increasing the mechanical strength of the layer.

Hybrid structures consisting of a polycrystalline hybrid crystal structure and an amorphous structure, and hybrid constituents including at least Cu, Cu2O, CuO, CoO, CuCoO2, and Cu2CoO3 were identified and characterized by using SEM, HR-TEM, XPS as well as electrochemical analysis. Interestingly, no information of the doped Mo appeared in the XRD patterns. The reasonable deduction is that Mo might be confined in the amorphous area. The highly developed interface, enhanced conductivity, larger active surface area, abundant oxygen vacancies, and redistribution of electrons among these elements resulted in the significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity. The optimized Mo-doped hybrid Cu/Co oxide exhibited catalytic activity with an overpotential of 88 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte with scarce loss of the initial catalyst activity for 28h and over 5000 cycles. This work may provide a channel to enhance the performance in the HER.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2196-0216			WOS:000463752300016

It was discovered that the plasma treatment could allow for the simultaneous N doping and Cu2O oxidation to yield the N-doped Cu2O@CuO heterostructure so as to boost the separation and transferring of photogenerated carriers of photocatalysis. More interestingly, the photocatalytic performances of the N-doped Cu2O@CuO could controllably depend on the plasma treatment time, with the highest H2O2 production rate (about 14 mu Mg(-1)min(-1)) at the 10-min plasma treatment, which is over three and eight folds higher than that of Cu2O and CuO, respectively. Also, high photochemical stability of the photocatalyst could be expected for photocatalytic cycles. A two-step single electron transfer pathway was demonstrated for the photocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions of H2O2 evolution through the formation of dominated %O-2(-) radicals. This one-step plasma treatment route may provide a facile and efficient construction of photocatalytic heterostructures, promising for the large-scale applications for designing various efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 productions under visible light.									20	1	0	0	3	0	21			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000564202400001

Structural and morphological characterizations of the powder are investigated using X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). XRD analysis shows that there is a synergic effect to obtain RuO2 nanoparticles when 6% v/v H2O2 is added followed by a calcination of the powder, due to reactive oxygen intermediates (O-1(2), HO2-, HO2 center dot, (OH)-O-center dot) generated in the first stage. TEM and SEM images of as-synthesized material exhibit an uniform particle distribution (PSD) of RuO2 nanoparticles with averaged diameter of ca. 38 nm, and its indexing indicates the RuO2 stoichiometry with high degree of crystallinity. The preliminary electrocatalytic performance of RuO2 nanoparticles coated on Ti is investigated using voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), towards the oxygen (OER) and chlorine evolution reaction (CER) in 1 mol L-1 H2SO4 and 0.1 mol L-1 NaCl, respectively. Cyclic voltammograms of RuO2 display typical behaviors for OER and CER at 1.25 and 1.1 V vs Ag/AgCl, respectively. A Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1) corrected for ohmic drop was obtained in sulfate media which confirmed the OER mechanism in the absence of chlorides; while this parameter is around 25 mV dec(-1) in NaCl (CER), strongly depending on the chloride concentration and the extent of OER input. In NaCl media, the energy barriers represented by the charge transfer resistances for CER are overcome at more positive potentials than for OER, and a greater activity of the O-2 evolution is observed as the potential became more positive.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			2365-6549			WOS:000452260800028

Their activity and stability can be superior to those of the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalysts, although the exact nature of this phenomenon is not yet understood. In the current work, a Ir0.7Sn0.3O2-x thin-film electrode is taken as a representative example for a thorough evaluation of OER activity of the non-stoichiometric oxides. Complementary activity and stability analysis of Ir0.7Sn0.3O2-x electrodes is achieved using a setup based on an electrochemical scanning flow cell and ICP-MS. The obtained ICP-MS data presents an unambiguous proof of the preferential dissolution of the less noble Sn from the mixed oxide during OER. While less than a monolayer of Ir is dissolved after a prolonged electrolysis of 1400 min during which its dissolution rate drops to near zero, the amount of Sn lost is ten monolayers. The latter finding is confirmed by XPS analysis, which besides showing Ir surface enrichment also indicates a gradual transformation of Ir-0 to Ir-III species. This transition is beneficial for electrode activity, as the overpotential for OER at j = 5 mA cm(-2) was decreasing up to 300 mV. The increase in electrode activity is attributed to several mechanisms including generation of Ir-III active sites and overall surface area increase. A generalized description of OER catalysis by Ir-based materials is given, including data from the current work as well as from other Ir-based mixed oxides, such as Ir-Ru-O and Ir-Ni-O.									14	1	0	0	2	0	15			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000426955500002

After anodic electrodeposition onto Au(111) from a Co2+-containing electrolyte, the chemical environment of Co can be identified to be almost identical to CoOOH. With increasing potentials, a subtle increase of the Co oxidation state is observed, indicating a non-stoichiometric composition of the working OER catalyst containing a small fraction of Co4+ sites. In order to confirm this interpretation, we used density functional theory with a Hubbard-U correction approach to compute X-ray absorption spectra of model compounds, which agree well with the experimental spectra. In situ monitoring of catalyst local structure and bonding is essential in the development of structure-activity relationships that can guide the discovery of efficient and earth abundant water splitting catalysts.									74	0	0	0	12	0	75			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000325398500051	24026021

The activity was quantitatively characterized by the double-layer capacitance, C-dl. The results showed that in comporison with that in H2SO4 electrolyte the electrode activity in Na2SO4 solution with the same concentration declines dramatically. The active surface area of the electrodes was also found to decrease in the presence of these small organic moleculars. It was found that the electrooxidation of organic compounds can take place in a wide potential region, but with a slow reaction rate. The organic oxidation is facilitated by the oxygen evolution on this type of electrode.									3	2	0	0	0	0	3			1000-6818			WOS:000222794400015

The incorporation of Fe3(PO4)2 in the nanoshell of the composite endowed a fast electron and mass transport activity with the resultant catalyst. As a result, H-PZS-Fe-850 exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for both the oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions, coupled with excellent selectivity and durability, compared to the commercial benchmark catalyst (i. e. Pt/C and IrO2). Meanwhile, H-PZS-Fe-850 also presented acceptable ORR performance in the acidic and neutral media. It could be translated to a high-performance rechargeable Zn-air battery (ZAB), as evidenced by the prominent charge/discharge performance with long time charging-discharging cycles (>320 h), high specific energy density (827 Wh gxfffd; 1 Zn ) and superior discharge power density (211 mW cm-2), exceeding those of Pt/C-IrO2 catalyzed battery. This work provides an attractive guide for the rational preparation of highly performance oxygen electrocatalysts with controlled composition and morphology, accelerating the real applications of ZABs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000793828600004

This catalyst is unique in that it shows >99% selectivity toward H2O2, the highest mass activity to date, and essentially zero overpotential in base. Furthermore, the mrGO catalytically active site is unambiguously identified and presents a unique opportunity to investigate mechanisms of carbon-based catalysis in atomistic detail. A wide range of experiments at varying pH are reported: ORR onset potential, Tafel slopes, H/D kinetic isotope effects, and O-2 reaction order. With DFT reaction energies and known thermodynamic parameters, we calculate the potential and pH-dependent free energies of all possible intermediates in this ORR and propose simple kinetic models that give semiquantitative agreement with all experiments. Our results show that mrGO is semiconducting and cannot support the conventional mechanism of coherently coupled proton-electron transfers. The conducting P50 provides electrons for initiating the ORR via outer sphere electron transfer to O-2(aq), while the semiconducting mrGO provides the active catalytic sites for adsorption of O-2(-)(aq) or HO2(aq), depending upon electrolyte pH. Due to this unique synergistic effect, we describe the mrGO/P50 as a co-catalyst. This concept implies departure from the traditional picture of predicting catalytic activity trends based on a single descriptor, and the co-catalyst design strategy may generally enable other semiconductors to function as electrocatalysts as well.									33	1	0	0	0	0	32			2155-5435			WOS:000453491100097

Various reaction parameters like substrate concentration, alpha-Fe2O3 content, amount of oxygen present, type of iron oxide, pH of the solution, temperature, and contribution of the dark reaction were investigated. By the use of several experimental techniques like H-1-NMR studies, CO2 evolution, total organic carbon spectrophotometry, and high-pressure liquid chromatography, the more relevant features of the degradation mechanism observed in aminophenols were established. alpha-Fe2O3 appears to react only with aminophenols having electron-donating character through the formation of a surface complex. No similar degradation was observed when phenol, nitrophenol, or chlorophenol was used as a substrate. The reaction proceeds in the dark and under light and is favored by the amount of oxygen present. The rates of photooxidation were found to vary by about 2 orders of magnitude with different iron oxides.

To elucidate the crystalline structure effect on the ORR, herein, we designed a facile method to obtain alpha-MnO2 and gamma-MnO2 via adjusting the acid under hydrothermal conditions using the same starting materials and reagents. The prepared alpha-MnO2 and gamma-MnO2 have a similar morphology composed of 3D microscopic spheres made up of numerous nanorods. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature programmed desorption of oxygen characterization and conductivity measurements demonstrate that the alpha-MnO2 material has a relatively higher ratio of surface oxygen species, higher oxygen mobility and higher electrical conductivity. When compared with gamma-MnO2, alpha-MnO2 displays superior ORR activity with a higher electron transfer number and lower yield of peroxide species in alkaline solutions. The obtained results shed new light on the crystalline structure-dependent ORR activity of MnO2.									21	1	0	0	1	0	21				1466-8033		WOS:000384235800017

A modified Adams fusion method was developed to produce these oxides. The RuxSn1 - xO2 powder catalysts were investigated with XRD, SEM, TEM, CV, and EIS. XRD showed a nano-crystalline rutile structure results over the whole composition range. The particle sizes determined by TEM were between 5 and 20 nm. With an increase in the Sn content in RuxSn1 - xO2 (x-value was decreased), the catalytic performance increased initially and then decreased dramatically. The catalyst Ru0.6Sn0.4O2 demonstrated the best performance in general, which may be due to its smaller particle size and greater ratio of outer active surface area. Repetitive cyclic voltammograms demonstrated that the Ru0.6Sn0.4O2 catalyst had better stability than pure RuO2. Both the mass normalized current density and chronocoulometry at 1.4 V indicated that Ru0.6Sn0.4O2 and RuO2 had better performance at 70 degrees C than at 25 degrees C.

Having a suitable band gap for light absorption, being chemically stable and based on earth abundant elements, hematite is a promising candidate for the fabrication of devices able to split water using sunlight. What limits its performance is the high rate of bulk recombination following the optical excitation, so that few charge carriers are able to reach the surface to perform the redox reactions. In an effort to better understand the light absorption properties of hematite, in this work we perform a theoretical first-principles investigation of its band structure and optical absorption properties. We use state-of-the-art many-body perturbation theory, including the effects of electron-hole interaction by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Our approach provides good agreement with the available photoemission and absorption measurements and shows that the onset of light absorption is mostly due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer excitations, giving rise to fairly localized excitons. This is at variance with the previously accepted view that these excitations are due to Fe d-d transitions.									48	1	0	0	2	0	49			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000459584900010	30687864

However, the HER and OER kinetics are sluggish and require highly efficient electrocatalysts for enhancing the reaction rate. Currently, precious metals such as Pt and RuO2 have shown excellent HER and OER performance, respectively, but their practical applications are limited by their scarcity and high price. Therefore, the use of 3d transition metals, such as iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni), as electrocatalysts has attracted significant attention. To obtain a catalytic performance similar to that of precious metals, several methods have been explored, such as alloying 3d transition metals with precious metals, compositing a variety of transition metals, or requiring good carbon-based materials as a supporter. Metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived nanomaterials have emerged as some of the most promising non-precious metal bifunctional electrocatalysts. The MOF structure consists of metal-based units and special organic ligands, and after annealing, metal atoms can be converted into unsaturated metal-based active sites, and the organic ligands can be converted into carbon support. This could accelerate the charge transfer efficiency and can be beneficial for achieving excellent HER and OER performance. However, bifunctional electrocatalysts derived from nickel (Ni)-based MOFs have not been studied intensively, and their catalytic activity and stability remain to be improved. Herein, a Ni-MOF precursor was synthesized via a liquid-phase coordination reaction using Ni2+ and benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid. The obtained NiMOF samples were annealed under H-2/Ar atmosphere at 600, 700, and 800 degrees C, named Ni/C-H-2-600, Ni/C-H-2-700, Ni/CAr-700, and Ni/C-H-2-800, respectively. During high-temperature annealing treatment, Ni nanoparticles were grown in situ on a rod-shaped carbon substrate to form novel hybrid architecture Ni/C nanoparticles used as a high-performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The HER overpotential of Ni/C-H-2-700 was 120 mV at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2), which is much lower than that of Ni/C-H-2-600 (250 mV), Ni/C-H2-800 (348 mV), and Ni/C-Ar-700 (275 mV). Ni/C-H-2-700 required an OER overpotential of 350 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mAcm(-2), which is lower than that of Ni/C-H-2-600 (370 mV), Ni/C-H-2-800 (430 mV), and Ni/C-Ar-700 (380 mV). Furthermore, Ni/C-H-2-700 showed the idea of HER and OER durability. Presumably, good structural properties and the abundant surface area of the carbon substrate elevated HER/OER activity owing to the synergistic advantages of accessible active sites and enhanced electronic conductivity.									14	1	0	0	0	0	15			1000-6818			WOS:000616616500013

Among different non PGM groups nickel (Ni), nickel oxide (NiO), nickel molybdenum oxide (Ni-MoOx) show very good activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this work, Ni and Ni-MoO2 nanostructured particles were impregnated on the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets and utilized for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in highly alkaline medium (1 M KOH). Electrochemical studies have been done by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) which concludes that there is decrease in overpotential of about 124 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) as we switch from Ni/RGO to Ni-MoO2/RGO. To understand reaction mechanism, temperature dependent HER have also performed within the temperature range of 293-333 K respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Arrhenius activation energy calculations concluded enhanced catalytic activity of Ni-MoO2/RGO. Temperature-controlled experimental data clearly confirm that addition of molybdenum leads to reduction in energy barrier for hydrogen evolution in Ni-MoO2/RGO.									18	2	0	0	1	0	18			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000441485200028

In this work, we develop a two-dimensional computational model to investigate the current and potential distributions in a single cell under these voltage reversal conditions. It is found that most of hydrogen under these conditions is oxidized in a narrow region close to the fuel-inlet, and the anode area before hydrogen depletion can be characterized into an activation limited region and a mass-transport limited region. Meanwhile, an unexpected hydrogen evolution phenomenon is discovered in the cathode catalyst layer (CCL) adjacent to the fuel inlet, owing to the imbalance between the localized ultrahigh hydrogen oxidation current density in the anode and the lower limiting current density of oxygen reduction reaction in the adjacent CCL. Furthermore, the evolved hydrogen gas is also found to be oxidized nearby due to the steep variation of electrolyte potential in the CCL, indicating the coexistence of hydrogen evolution, hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction within the micron-scale thickness of CCL, which significantly adds to the complexity of the coupled phenomena in the voltage-reversal single cell.

It avoids the insoluble and insulating Li2O2 product in a typical nonaqueous Li-air battery, and it owns unique advantages. A bifunctional cathode catalyst is crucial to battery performance. Here, we synthesize an ultrathin N-doped graphene-encapsulated nanosphere Co-Ni alloy (Co-Ni@NG). It has hierarchical architecture consisting of a uniform Co-Ni nanoalloy coated with a thin layer of N-doped graphene, showing high activity, high stability, and lower overpotential between the ORR and OER (0.55 V between onset potentials). It exhibited a discharge/charge voltage gap of 0.55 V at a current density of 1.4 mA cm(-2), which is much smaller than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. It delivered an energy density of 3158 Wh kg(-1) and a power density as high as 134.2 W m(-2) at a current density of 7 mA cm(-2).

The following results were obtained. (1) Small but distinct temperature. acclimation of the PSII reaction center activity was shown for the first time when the activity was measured at inhibitory high temperatures. However, the reaction center activity showed no apparent acclimation when it was measured at growth temperatures after heat stress. (2) Oxygen-evolving activity and the permeability of plasma membranes showed higher resistance to heat when PCC6803 cells were grown at higher temperatures. (3) Acclimation of photosynthesis to the growth temperature seemed to occur so as to maintain photosynthesis activity not at a maximum level but in a certain range at the growth temperatures. (4) Neither sensitivity to high-temperature-induced dissociation of phycobilisomes from the PSII reaction center complexes nor degradation of phycocyanin were altered by changes in the environmental temperature. (5) A close relationship between the viability of cells and the structural changes of plasma membranes (but not the inactivation of photosynthesis) was observed. The denaturation process of PSII complexes and the relationship between the temperature dependence of the growth of Synechocystis PCC6803 cells and that of the photosynthetic activity are also discussed.									63	5	0	0	64	0	72			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000171692700015	11673630

The solution blow spun fibers, prepared using nitrate precursors (Fe and Co) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone, PVP), were calcined at 620 degrees C for 1 h in argon atmosphere. The thermogravimetric test shows that the stabilization of mass loss and the formation of the compound occur at similar to 600 degrees C. X-ray diffraction revealed the presence of two crystalline phases, Fe0.5Co0.5 and Co1.15Fe1.15O4, with crystallite sizes of 16.5 nm and 18.1 nm, respectively. Scanning and transmission electron microscopies show that the average fiber and nanoparticle diameters are 362 nm and 28.41 nm, respectively. The quantification of Fe0.5Co0.5 and Co1.15Fe1.15O4 phases determined by the Rietveld refinement agrees well with the relative absorption area (RAA) values obtained by Mo euro ssbauer spectroscopy. Electro-chemical analyses of Fe0.5Co0.5-Co1.15Fe1.15O4/carbon composite nanofibers supported by commercial Ni foam reveal a low overpotential value of h = 308 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and only 400 mV to generate 450 mA cm(-2). The chronopotentiometry test over 15 h indicates that Fe0.5Co0.5-Co1.15Fe1.15O4/carbon nanofibers have excellent chemical and mechanical stability for their use as electrodes for water oxidation.

The production of high current density at low overpotential and long-time durability of the catalysts are the main challenges to achieve further progress in this field. In this respect, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a new route for the designing of the catalysts with excellent electrochemical water oxidation activity. MOF derived materials have been demonstrated with high surface area, porous structure, increased electron transport, accessible active sites, and tailorable properties. Recent studies of MOF derived electrocatalysts mainly focused on the morphological development, crystal structure modulation, facet engineering, and enhancement of the electrochemical surface area. The recent reviews also followed the same trend to explain the improved water oxidation activity of the MOF derived catalysts. As a result, electronic structure, the major descriptor of the water oxidation activity, was never reviewed for the MOF derived electrocatalysts. Hence a systematic discussion for the designing of the MOF-derived electrocatalysts by electronic structure modulation is highly demanded. In this review, we have described the electronic structure engineering of the MOF derived materials to attain efficient water oxidation activity. The controlling factors like e(g) orbital filling, metal-oxygen covalency, mixed valency of metal ions, octahedral (Oh) vs tetrahedral (Td) occupancy of the metal ions, and vacancy engineering have been discussed. The strategies of tuning the electronic properties by interfacial modulation, surface overlayer, Fermi level manipulation, self-supported strategy, and heterostructure formation have also been addressed to improve the catalytic activity and stability of the MOF derived catalysts. Finally, an attempt has been made to establish a structure-activity-stability relationship in MOF derived materials for the electrochemical water oxidation. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

MXenes have been suggested as potential candidates owing to their high electrical conductivity and effective CO2 activation performance. Herein, the stability and bifunctional CRR/CER catalytic activities of bare MXene (M2C), oxygen-functionalized MXene (M2CO2), and single-atom (SA) modified M2CO2 are systemically investigated. Among bare MXenes, Mo2C exhibits the best catalytic activity, comparable to that of carbon nanotubes, whereas oxygen-functionalized MXene has poor activity. Notably, introducing an SA on the surface of oxygen-functionalized MXene decreases the overpotential by 12.2%-68.1%, which can even outperform graphene catalysts, suggesting their potential as bifunctional cathode catalysts in Li-CO2 batteries. This high activity is appropriate reactivity in origin, as highlighted by the volcano-type relationship between the Gibbs free energy and the overpotential for key steps. The descriptor xi, which is related to adsorption behavior, is effective in determining bifunctional catalytic activity, which depends on the ability of SA electrons to fill antibonding orbitals and SA-oxygen/carbon bonding. This work not only identifies promising MXene-based bifunctional CRR/CER catalysts but also provides a rational design rule for SA modified catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000862093700001

The challenge to develop a highperformance Li-O-2 battery lies in exploring an air electrode with optimal porous structure and high efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst. The present work demonstrates a bioinspired synthesis route for the preparation of high performance Li-O-2 air electrode materials that are made out of N-doped carbon foams decorated with heteronanostructured MoO2/Mo2C nanocrystals (MoO2/Mo2C@3D NCF). Here, recombinant proteins (ELK16-FLAG) facilitated the self-assembly of metal precursors and provided a carbon source for Mo2C formation. The as-prepared MoO2/Mo2C@3D NCF showed superior electrocatalytic activity in both oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction mechanisms with a high round-trip efficiency of 89.1% (2.77 V/3.11 V) at 100 mA g(-1) as well as exceptional rate performances and good cyclability in Li-O-2 battery. The desirable electrochemical performance can be attributed to the unique hierarchical porous structure of the 3D carbon foam and the intimate contact between MoO2 and Mo2C nanocrystals. We demonstrate that the novel, facile, environmentally friendly bioinspired approaches would open new avenues for the synthesis of 3D nitrogen doped carbon supported advanced functional materials with excellent electrochemical performances.									84	6	0	0	4	0	84			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000381960300022

However, phase segregation resulting from the outward migration of Fe species in NiFe2O4 often occurred, which could lead to serious surface sintering and, thus, a decrease in the redox activity of NiFe2O4 center dot CeO2 was often used as a promising candidate of support to induce the formation of oxygen vacancy, which could improve the diffusion rate of lattice oxygen in oxygen carriers. Herein, we synthesized NiFe2O4 samples doped with different contents of CeO2 using a wet impregnation method. A variety of characterization analyses were conducted to investigate the fundamental mechanism of the interaction between CeO2 and NiFe2O4. It was shown that the CeO2 content with 70 wt % in NiFe2O4 sample (70 CeO2-NiFe2O4) presented an excellent redox performance and the highest resistance to phase segregation, which was due to the formation of adequate oxygen vacancy by the addition of sufficient CeO2. The presence of abundant oxygen vacancy could enhance the mobility of lattice oxygen to prevent the phase segregation and thereby maintain the microstructural integrity of NiFe2O4 during the redox reaction.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000537407200096

Herein, the activity of a new catalyst motif is engineered and isolated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) created by nickel-iron transition metal electrocatalysts confined within a layered zirconium phosphate matrix. It is found that with optimal intercalation, confined NiFe catalysts have an order of magnitude improved mass activity compared to more conventional surface-adsorbed systems in 0.1 m KOH. Interestingly, the confined environments within the layered structure also stabilize Fe-rich compositions (90%) with exceptional mass activity compared to known Fe-rich OER catalysts. Through controls and by grafting inert molecules to the outer surface, it is evidenced that the intercalated Ni/Fe species stay within the interlayer during catalysis and serve as the active site. After determining a possible structure (wycherproofite), density functional theory is shown to correlate with the observed experimental compositional trends. It is further demonstrated that the improved activity of this motif is correlated to the Fe and water content/composition within the confined space. This work highlights the catalytic enhancement possibilities available through zirconium phosphate and isolates the activity from the intercalated species versus surface/edge ones, thus opening new avenues to develop and understand catalysts within unique nanoscale chemical environments.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000639983100001

Herein, we report a novel composite of MIL-53(Fe) with Ni(3)S(2)nanosheet arrays supported on Ni foam that ingeniously combines the chemical and structural advantages of the MOFs and metal sulfides to perform as a high-performance synergistic OER electrocatalyst in alkaline solution. The hybrid Ni3S2/MIL-53(Fe) simultaneously realizes high electrical conductivity to facilitate charge transfer and abundant coordinatively unsaturated centres, porosity and high surface area to provide a great number of active sites. Strikingly, synergistic electronic interaction between Ni(3)S(2)and MIL-53(Fe) is generated in the hybrid composite. Collectively, the coupled Ni3S2/MIL-53(Fe) exhibits excellent OER performance in comparison to bare Ni(3)S(2)and MIL-53(Fe), with low potentials of 214 and 251 mV to reach current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. The Tafel slope is 33.8 mV dec(-1), which is also markedly lower than those of Ni3S2, MIL-53(Fe) and most reported Ni-based electrocatalysts. The present work paves a promising avenue to design and fabricate highly active and earth-abundant electrocatalysts toward the OER.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000553632500015

In the present work, a visible light assistant electrode-process on an oxygen vacancy doped TiO2 (TiO2-delta) catalyst is proposed to promote its performances in Li-O-2 batteries. The TiO2-delta is prepared by an insufficient oxidation on Ti2O3 through a hydrothermal process and subsequent heat-treatment, and this method guarantees the homogeneous distribution of oxy-gen vacancies in obtained TiO2-delta catalysts. The TiO2-delta possess a narrow bandgap, leading to a visible light adsorption, which leads to remarkable suppression on overpotential under illumination by xenon lamp in Li-O-2 atteries. The electrochemical measurements indicate that, the illumination can obviously enhance the catalytic currents and reduce the electrochemical reaction impedance, and these contributions are responsible for the overpotential decrease. The in-situ gas chromatography is used for inspecting the oxygen flow of a cyclic battery, and the results reveal that, the illumination results in apparent increase in oxygen consumption/evolution in discharge/charge processes. We suggest the photo-induced electrons/vacancies on catalyst surface in discharge/charge processes promote the performances and reversibility of Li-O-2 batteries. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent intensive research has been conducted to introduce oxygen vacancies for boosting Li-O(2)battery performance. However, it is difficult to examine the efficiency of cationic vacancies due to their complicated preparation. Herein, a feasible method is demonstrated to introduce cationic vacancies into cobalt oxides via the thermal treatment of glycerolatocobalt (GlyCo) nanostructure. The formation of GlyCo composed of the repeating Co-O-Co-O units provides the possibility to regulate the ratio between cobalt and oxygen, thus cobalt vacancies in cobalt oxides can be easily created by the thermal treatment. The presence of cobalt vacancies enables the regulation of electronic structure and charge-transport properties of cobalt oxides with abundant defects on the basis of the experimental results and theoretical calculations, thus improving electrocatalytic activities. Therefore, the Li-O(2)battery delivers superior electrochemical performance with large specific capacities of 13 331/12 040 mAh g(-1), low overpotentials for the oxygen evolution reaction/oxygen reduction reaction of 1.15/0.23 V and good cycling stability. This work provides a favorable method to create metal vacancies for improving catalytic efficiency of advanced energy materials.									71	1	0	0	3	0	71			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000565632500001

However, the OER performance is still low, and especially, the overpotential is larger than 200 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Herein, an Ir@IrNiO sample is prepared with single-atom (SA) Ir4+ doping and surface metallic Ir nanoparticles loaded onto the NiO. Owing to the bonding of the loaded Ir with surface-exposed Ni2+, the nearby Ni atoms exist in the +3 valence state, that is, the surface-loaded Ir particles behave like a stabilizer for the Ni3+ sites. Under the synergistic effect of SA Ir4+ and high-valance-state Ni3+, the Ir@IrNiO nanostructure effectively reduces the overpotential to 195 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, it gives an Ir-content-normalized current density of 0.0457 A mg(Ir)(-1), 72.1 times higher than that of the best commercialized IrO2 (6.33 x 10(-4) A mg(Ir)(-1)), under the condition of 1.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Operando Raman and X-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) measurements reveal that there are more surface-active species of Ni3+, which adsorb and activate water molecules to form Ni3+-*OH at low voltage, the intermediate of Ni4+-center dot O is then formed at a relatively high bias voltage, and then the center dot O is transferred to the SA Ir4+ sites to generate Ir4+-O-O with -OH at increased voltage. This work can help design more SA-based highly active OER materials.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000678642400001	34323372

Herein, free-standing heteroatom-doped edge-enriched 3D rivet graphene (H-3DRG) film with high flexibility and conductivity was obtained as a substrate to deposit vertically arranged NiCo-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) nanoneedles via a hydrothermal approach and hierarchical NiCo2S4 nanostructures by further in situ anion exchange process without destroying the original vertical architecture. The carbon nanoparticles located on the surface of bicontinuous 3D porous graphene show gradient and edge-enriched structure, which can provide much more nucleation sites and better attachment of electroactive inorganics than traditional 3D porous graphene films with interconnected carbon layers prepared by the chemical vapor deposition process. Such outstanding structural advantages accelerate the reaction kinetics and enhance electrochemical activities which mean that H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH- and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4-based asymmetric supercapacitor devices both show high energy densities of 39.4 W h kg(-1) and 37.6 W h kg(-1) based on the entire devices, respectively. Furthermore, these hybrids also favor the oxygen evolution reaction process, which deliver a mass oxygen production current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 289 and 264 mV in 1 M KOH, respectively.									84	1	0	0	0	0	84			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431621700087

More importantly, their electrocatalytic performances for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER) have been fully investigated by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and linear sweep voltammetry with a rotating electrode in 1 M KOH electrolyte versus Ag/AgCl. Based on the measurements from these CuMnO2-based working electrodes, the specific capacitance, total charge, most accessible charge, electrochemically active surface area, and roughness factor were calculated for the first time. Their stability was also studied for cost-effective and active electrode material. Furthermore, by comparing measurements at 1600 rpm and no rotation of the electrodes in alkaline media, the delafossite CuMnO2 synthesized in this work showed current densities of 12.3 mA/cm(2) at 1600 rpm and 11.9 mA/cm(2) at no rotation for OER and 6.9 mA/cm(2) and 6.3 mA/cm(2) for HER.

The combination of BP with CN strengthens the visible-light harvesting ability, facilitates the charge separation in the photocatalytic process, and renders promoted activity of photoinduced molecular oxygen activation, such as superoxide radicals (center dot O-2(-)) evolution and H2O2 production. This work highlights that coupling semiconductors with well-matched band levels provide a flexible route to enhance the performance of photocatalysts for producing reactive oxygen species, and gives ideas for the design of highly active and metal-free materials toward sustainable solar-to-chemical energy conversion and environmental remediation.									285	20	0	0	41	0	290			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000426603700012

In this paper, a synopsis of the research efforts concerning with the development of electrocatalysts, polymer electrolytes and stack hardware components is presented. The most challenging problem for the development of PEMWEs is the enhancement of oxygen evolution reaction rate. At present, there are no practical alternatives to noble metal-based oxide catalysts such as IrO2 and RuO2. As well as carbon supported Pt nanoparticles are the benchmark cathode catalysts for hydrogen evolution. High noble metal loading on the electrodes and the use of perfluorosulfonic membranes significantly contribute to the cost of these devices. Critical areas include the design of appropriate mixed electrocatalysts and their dispersion on low cost Ti-oxide like supports to increase catalyst utilization. Moreover, the development of alternative membranes with enhanced mechanical properties for high pressure applications, proper conductivity and reduced gas cross-over is strongly required. This latter aspect is also addressed by the development of proper recombination catalysts. The development of anodic mixed non-noble transition metal oxides with spinel or perovskite structure and proper resistance to chemical degradation in the acidic environment and electrochemical corrosion is also an active area of research. Similarly, efforts are also being addressed to Pd and Ru based cathode formulations with cheaper characteristics than Pt. Whereas, concerning with stack hardware, cost reduction may be addressed by replacing Ti-based diffusion media and bipolar plates with appropriate and cost-effective stainless steel materials with enhanced resilience to chemical and electrochemical corrosion. Regarding the combination with renewable power sources, PEM electrolysers can find suitable applications for peak shaving in integrated systems grid connected or in grid independent operating conditions where hydrogen generated through electrolysis is stored and then via fuel cell converted back to electricity when needed or used to refill fuel cell-based cars. Hydrogen is the most promising clean energy carrier to accomplish the sustainable production of energy and a synergy among hydrogen, electricity and renewable energy sources is highly desired.									123	4	0	0	2	0	124			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000313519500003

The main issue was the inability to deconvolute bubble blockage of catalytic active sites from catalyst dissolution using the TF-RDE technique. It is also possible that the low-loading of TF-RDE OER catalysts exacerbates the effect of bubble blockage. In this work, the modified rotating disk electrode (MRDE) is used with commercial catalyst coated membranes (CCMs) to evaluate catalyst stability. The MRDE may be better suited for stability measurements, since the CCM samples used can better avoid experimental artifacts and can explore much higher current densities than a TF-RDE. Thicker catalyst layers have good adhesion to the membrane, making experimental artifacts less pronounced in stability measurements. Three different stability protocols are used to study the effect of cycling, lower/upper potential limits, and regeneration. The protocol which induced the most irreversible degradation was the square-wave voltammetry (SWV) cycling between 0.05-2.0 V-RHE. This irreversible degradation is likely the result of catalyst dissolution. The importance of differentiating between irreversible and reversible degradation is highlighted as a potential future standard for stability evaluation.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000620892800001

JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				166	8			F458	F464		10.1149/2.0301908jes				APR 23 2019	2019	The rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique was frequently used for investigating the stability of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts under galvanostatic conditions, where the increase in potential is reported to be due to catalyst degradation. The galvanostatic RDE stability test typically results in catalyst life-time of several hours, although the same catalyst can last for thousands of hours in a PEM electrolyzer under similar conditions, a discrepancy that is still unresolved. In this work, we present a careful examination of the use of the RDE technique as a tool for the investigation of the OER catalyst stability. Our findings provide a clear evidence that the change in potential during the stability test is not related at all to catalyst degradation, but is rather due to an experimental artifact caused by nano- and micro-bubbles formed within the pores of the catalyst layer during the OER, which cannot be removed by electrode rotation. Instead, they accumulate and shield the OER active sites from the electrolyte, resulting in an increase of the potential, which is mistakenly interpreted as catalyst degradation in previous literature. Thus, reliable OER catalyst stability tests other than testing in a real electrolyzer cell still needs to be designed. (C) The Author(s) 2019.

The proportions of the refractory lithophile elements in the silicate part of the Earth are thought to have remained similar to that of chondrite meteorites throughout accretion(1). However, although niobium (Nb) and tantalum (Ta) are both classified as refractory lithophile elements and share a similar degree of incompatibility in mineral structures(2), the Nb/Ta ratio of the bulk silicate Earth is subchondritic(3). To explain this paradox, it has been proposed that Nb becomes siderophile at the high pressures of core formation, and was preferentially removed from the silicate Earth(4-6). Here we conduct metal/silicate partitioning experiments at a range of oxygen fugacities and show that Nb and Ta are both siderophile elements under reducing conditions, but become so at different oxygen fugacities, leading to fractionation. We find that pressure has a negligible influence on the Nb/Ta ratio. Applying our partitioning data to existing theoretical accretion models(7,8), we reproduce the Nb/Ta ratios of the bulk silicate Earth, Mars and the differentiated asteroid 4 Vesta, and discuss the implications for Moon formation. We conclude that planetary accretion of reduced materials played an important role in the chemical evolution of Earth and, more generally, that Nb and Ta can be used to trace prevailing oxygen fugacities during the segregation of planetary cores.									35	0	0	0	6	0	35			1752-0894	1752-0908		WOS:000341635100013

Surface photovoltage techniques and other measurements were carried out to confirm that the enhanced photoelectrochemical performances were attributed to the synergistic effect of the phase junction and a certain content of surface states, which accelerate the separation and transmission of the photogenerated charges. This material with phase junction and surface states promises a potential application in the field of photoelectric catalysis under solar light.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1005-9040	2210-3171		WOS:000815451100002

Uranium oxides are efficient catalysts due to their wide range optical absorption (E-g approximate to 1.8-3.2 eV), high photoconductivity, and multiple valence switching among uranium centers that improves the charge propagation kinetics. Herein, thin films of depleted uranium oxide (U3O8) are demonstrated grown via chemical vapor deposition effectively accelerate the OER in conjunction with hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) overlayers through a built-in potential at the interface. Density functional theory simulations demonstrate that the multivalence of U and Fe ions induce the adjustment of the band alignment subject to the concentration of interfacial Fe ions. In general, the equilibrium state depicts a type II band edge as the favored alignment, which improves charge-transfer processes as observed in transient and X-ray absorption (TAS and XAS) spectroscopy. The enhanced water splitting photocurrent density of the heterostructures (J = 2.42 mA cm(-2)) demonstrates the unexplored potential of uranium oxide in artificial photosynthesis.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000491124400001

In this work, we have developed polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) with atomically dispersed N-coordinated Ni-Fe sites to investigate the OER process. The Ni-Fe dual sites consist of adjacent Ni and Fe atoms coordinated with N atoms in the PCN matrix. NiFe-codoped PCN exhibits higher electrocatalytic activity than monometal-doped catalysts, showing a lower overpotential (310 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and smaller Tafel slope (38 mV dec(-1)) in 1 M KOH, indicating that Ni-Fe dual-metal sites significantly favor the OER process. According to density functional theory calculations based on the oxidized-NiFe@PCN model, it was found that adjacent Ni and Fe atoms co-participate in the OER process for NiFe-codoped PCN, leading to a much lower energy barrier (0.10 or 0.22 eV for U = 1.58 V), while the effect of electronic modification of the single metal active sites by the other component (Ni sites by Fe sites or vice versa) contributes less to activity enhancement, thus leading to a rational explanation on the synergistic effect of the NiFe-based OER catalysts.									60	3	0	0	0	0	60			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472566400013

Cooperative QSEI in compositions with multi-atomic open-shell configurations (QSEI-OS) maximize the influence of the spin dependent potentials, determining the electronic properties of magnetic materials and shaping their reactivity. In this paper, we explain that because of the intra- and inter-atomic QSEI-OS, high-spin (3d(5)) antiferromagnetic (AFM) metals like Cr and Mn can be more inert (or "noble") than Au itself towards the formation of covalent bonds with hydrogen atoms. AFM QSEI-OS lead to a relative higher destabilization of the unoccupied (spin-)orbitals (Mott upper band) in Cr and Mn compared with other metals. In oxygen adsorption, QSEI-OS lead to the reduction of the electronic repulsions in occupied 3d(5) orbitals with a concomitant decrease of the chemisorption enthalpy of the oxygen atoms. Since hydrogen and oxygen atoms are the most important intermediates in relevant catalytic processes like oxygen reduction reaction and water splitting, we observe how the effect of QSEI-OS needs to be properly incorporated as a critical factor to understand the activity of catalysts based on magnetic metals.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2352-4928			WOS:000536946700013

The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) are two reactions that play key roles in electrochemical energy storage and conversion with the sustainable H-2 as a medium. To date, the most efficient catalysts for production and conversion of hydrogen are based on noble metals. Therefore, the development of non-noble metal catalysts with high efficiency and low cost is of significant importance for the practical application of H-2 in different electrochemical energy technologies. In this review, we recapitulate the recent progress of developing non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for HER and HOR and provide insights into the origins of catalytic performance enhancement. Fundamental understanding of the synthesis-structure-activity correlations, focusing on the HER/HOR mechanisms in acidic/alkaline media on studied non-noble metal catalysts are also discussed.									110	5	0	0	3	0	110			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000418344200009

This demands durable and affordable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, we report the preparation of uniform Ni-P-O, Ni-S-O, and Ni-S-P-O electrocatalytic films on nickel foam (NF) substrates via flow cell-assisted electrodeposition. Remarkably, electrodeposition onto 12 cm(2) substrates was optimized by strategically varying critical parameters. The high quality and reproducibility of the materials is attributed to the use of a 3D-printed flow cell with a tailored design. Then, the as-fabricated electrodes were tested for overall water splitting in the same flow cell under alkaline conditions. The best-performing sample, NiSP/NF, required relatively low overpotentials of 93 mV for the HER and 259 mV for the OER to produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Importantly, the electrodeposited films underwent oxidation into amorphous nickel (oxy)hydroxides and oxidized S and P species, improving both HER and OER performance. The superior electrocatalytic performance of the Ni-S-P-O films originates from the unique reconstruction process during the HER/OER. Furthermore, the overall water splitting test using the NiSP/NF couple required a low cell voltage of only 1.85 V to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Overall, we demonstrate that high-quality electrocatalysts can be obtained using a simple and reproducible electrodeposition method in a robust 3D-printed flow cell.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000635284900037

To improve the catalytic properties of the foam, it was subjected to complex modification via sulfurizing in sulfur-containing gaseous media and the additional formation of amorphous or crystalline MoSx nanolayers. The foam was sulfidized in hydrogen sulfide or sulfur vapor at a temperature of 400 degrees C. Amorphous MoSx films were produced via pulsed laser deposition from a MoS2 target in an H2S atmosphere. To obtain nanocrystalline catalytic MoSx layers, thin-film Mo precursors were preliminarily applied to the foam pre-sulfurized in sulfur vapor at 400 degrees C. The deposition of precursors was carried out in vacuum at 22 degrees C. After deposition, the foam with precursors was oxidized in air at 600 degrees C. The modified samples were probed via scanning electron microscopy involving microanalysis and Raman spectroscopy. The effect of the precursor layer thickness on the sulfurizing efficiency and phase composition of the modified layers was established. The amorphous layer deposition was found to have a strong impact on only the O-2 evolution. The crystalline layers obtained via sulfidizing of Mo-containing precursors exerted influence on both the cathodic and anodic reactions. The hydrogen overvoltage at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) was -160 mV, and the oxygen overvoltage was below 150 mV, which corresponded to the best electrocatalysts on the nickel foam after the volume modification via conventional chemical treatment (hydro- and solvothermal synthesis).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-7788	1562-692X		WOS:000520312400002

Functional nanocarbon materials have been extensively exploited as heterogeneous catalysts to drive catalytic ozonation because of the environmental-benign process, easy applicability, and high efficiency. Nevertheless, the bottlenecks in the processes are the economical production of high-performance and robust carbocatalysts and the debatable oxidation regimes. Different active sites have been suggested in engineered nanocarbons, and the corresponding mechanisms of the carbocatalytic ozonation are ambiguous including the evolution of various ROS, occurrence of radical and nonradical reaction pathways, selectivity toward organics, and tunable oxidation capacity. In this Review, we will showcase the roadmap of the development of reaction-oriented carbocatalysts and clarify the arguments in the mechanisms of the intrinsic active sites, identification of ROS, reaction intermediates, and oxidation pathways in carbocatalytic ozonation. We will provide critical comments and innovative strategies on the mechanistic investigations in carbon-based ozonation from the molecular level (electronic structures) to macroscale (kinetics), by deliberate radical screening/capture techniques, advanced characterizations and in situ analysis, and theoretical computations. More importantly, the critical issues and future directions will be proposed in the rational material/system design, mechanistic exploration, and the implementation of this powerful technology in catalytic oxidation and real wastewater treatment.									49	4	0	0	21	0	51			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900026

This study proposes NiCo2S4 and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 core-shell structures as energy storage materials and electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. A higher specific capacity of 2.22 mA h cm(-2) (168.18 mA h g(-1)) at 10 mA cm(-2) is obtained for the NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 electrode which is applied as the battery-type electrode in the battery supercapacitor hybrid, but a better electrocatalytic activity is achieved for the NiCo2S4 electrode with a smaller overpotential of 1.567 V-RHE at 0.12 A cm(-2) and a smaller Tafel slope of 86.1 mV dec(-1). The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is larger for NiCo2S4 due to the nanoparticle-assembled nanotube wall, whereas NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 shows higher electrical conductivity owing to the presence of molybdenum. Different performances in energy storage and electrocatalysis for NiCo2S4 and NiCo2OxSy@NiMoO4 nanomaterials are caused by different potentials applied for driving the electrochemical reactions. This study for the first time proves that the trade-off between ECSA and electrical conductivity is important for designing nanomaterials applied in different electrochemical fields.									36	1	0	0	0	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000460687400033

In this article, a facile two-step hydrothermal process was developed to grow Co9S8-Ni3S2 nanoarrays on nickel foam (Co9S8-Ni3S2 NAs/NF). The as-obtained catalyst possessed a novel morphology, in which the Co9S8 nanoneedles were surrounded by Ni3S2 ultrathin nanosheets. The resultant Co9S8-Ni3S2 nanoarrays not only permitted more exposures of active sites but also facilitated the charges and ions transport along the nanoarrays. Moreover, both Co9S8 and Ni3S2 exhibited metallic properties allowed the catalysts with conductivity (metallic conductor vs. semiconductor). Co9S8-Ni3S2 NAs/NF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activities for both HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH solution. To reach a large current density of 100 mA cm(-2), it only required overpotentials of 204 mV and 346 mV for HER and OER, respectively. After long-term electrolysis, the high activities were still preserved. This work indicates efficient electrocatalysts can be obtained by the rational design of the heterostructure, which sheds some light on the development of noble metal-free electrocatalysts.									35	4	0	0	0	0	37			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000458344900051

The bulk electrolysis was conducted at a fixed current density of 9.6 mA cm(-2), and the average applied potential difference was 6 V (anode potential 4 V; cathode potential -2 V). The feasibility of electrochemical treatment of phenol contaminated water was determined in terms of phenol degradation rate, byproduct formation, pH stability, and current efficiency. Galvanostatic electrolysis with NaCl electrolyte removed phenol and chemical oxygen demand (COD) faster than with Na2SO4 electrolyte, possibly due to the formation of chloride-oxychloride radicals, which are strong oxidation agents. The phenol and COD removal rates with NaCl were 2.26 x 10(-2) and 3.00 x 10(-4) min(-1), which was 9.5 and 1.5 times higher respectively than with Na2SO4. Energy consumption and current efficiency during the electrolysis suggested that chloride ions hinder the oxygen-evolution reaction, causing a growth in current efficiency and a decrease in energy consumption. This result clearly indicated that the presence of chloride in the solution was an important parameter for the efficient electrochemical oxidation of phenol-contaminated water. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The study shows a high increase in the HER activity, in terms of low onset overpotential (onset eta = 35 mV vs. RHE), high exchange current density (j(o,s) approximate to 0.22 mA cm(-2)), high mass activity (j(o,m) approximate to 59 mA mg(-1)), high kinetic current (j(K) approximate to 5-8 mA cm(-2)) and heterogeneous rate constant (k(0) approximate to 4 x 10(-4) cm s(-1)), which are attributed to the high porosity of MOFDC and contribution from residual Co, while the large Tafel slope (b(c) = 261 mV dec(-1)) is ascribed to the high degree of hydrogen adsorption onto polycrystalline Pd as a supplementary reaction step to the suggested Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. These values for the catalyst are comparable to or better than many recent reports that adopted nano-carbon materials and/or use bi- or ternary Pd-based electrocatalysts for the HER. The improved HER activity of Pd/MOFDC is associated with the positive impact of MOFDC and residual Co on the Pd catalyst (i.e., low activation energy, E-A approximate to 12 kJ mol(-1)) which allows for easy desorption of the H-ads to generate hydrogen. Moreover, Pd/MOFDC displays better OER activity than its analogue, with lower onset eta (1.29 V vs. RHE) and b(a) (approximate to 78 mV dec(-1)), and higher current response (ca. 18 mA cm(-2)). Indeed, this study provides a new strategy of designing and synthesizing MOFDC with physico-chemical features for Pd-based electrocatalysts that will allow for efficient electrochemical water-splitting processes.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16				2046-2069		WOS:000533969200063	35521459

The electrochemical behaviors of the composite materials were studied by electrochemical measurements, X-ray diffraction patterns, scanning electron microscopy observations, and so on. The results showed that the reproducibility and stability of the fabricated nanocarbon composites are good enough for use as electrodes in strong acidic and alkaline environments. The fabricated electrode in electrochemical performances was to some extent closer to graphite electrode rather than glassy carbon in these aqueous solutions. The porous nanocarbon electrodes seemed to have certain electrocatalysis capabilities for hydrogen evolution or oxygen reduction in aqueous solutions. These performances are attributed to the existence of pyrolyzed NCN derived from polymer and its high porosity in the composite matrix. The possible cathodic and anodic electrode reactions on this nanocarbon electrode surface were proposed and discussed according to their standard potentials reported in the literature. In addition, alumina particles or grain boundary phase dissolution in the electrode was a simple hydrolysis reaction with very low dissolution rate at ambient conditions, which did not involve the electrode reactions.

The integration of N-doped graphitic carbon outer shell and ultrathin nanocrystalline Co3O4 inner shell enable high ORR activity of the core@bishell NPs, as evidenced by ZnABs using catalyst of Co@Co3O4@PPD in air-cathode which delivers a stable voltage profile over 40 h at a discharge current density of as high as 20 mA. cm(-2).									82	10	0	0	5	0	84			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000378424100007	27031907

Because both groups are photosynthetic, all of the genes for nuclear-encoded plastid proteins might be supplied by the dinoflagellate host or some of them might have been replaced by haptophyte genes. Sequences of the conserved nuclear psbO gene were obtained from the haptophyte Isochrysis galbana, the peridinin-containing dinoflagellate Heterocapsa triquetra, and the 19'hexanoyloxy-fucoxanthin-containing dinoflagellate Karenia brevis. Phylogenetic analysis of the oxygen-evolving-enhancer (PsbO) proteins confirmed that in K. brevis the original peridinin-type plastid was replaced by that of a haptophyte, an alga which had previously acquired a red algal chloroplast by secondary endosymbiosis. It showed clearly that during this tertiary symbiogenesis the original psbO gene in the dinoflagellate nucleus was replaced by a psbO gene from the haptophyte nucleus. The phylogenetic analysis also confirmed that the origin of the peridinin-type dinoflagellate plastid was indeed a red alga.									119	1	1	0	121	0	128			0027-8424			WOS:000176775400041	12089328

Herein, an oriented thin film of 3-D MOF Co/Ni(BDC)(2)TED (BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate; TED = triethylenediamine) nanosheet arrays is first obtained on Cu foam by a liquid-phase epitaxial layer-by-layer growth approach. The obtained thin film of bimetallic MOF nanosheet arrays has preferred growth with [001]-orientation and strong adhesion on the substrates without the use of binder materials, which provides more accessible active sites for electrocatalytic performance. The OER activity of such surface-mounted MOF nanosheet arrays can be optimized effectively via tuning the thicknesses and Co/Ni ratios. The Co/Ni(BDC)(2)TED grown on Cu foam with 40 cycles at a Co/Ni ratio of 1/1 shows superior OER activity with required overpotentials of 260 and 287 mV to achieve current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability. The experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the synergistic effect of Co/Ni and rich metal sites dominated by nanosheet interfaces improve the electrocatalytic activity. This work provides more insight into the OER activity of the MOF thin film as an electrode material and presents a new strategy for developing promising highly efficient electrocatalysts in practical applications.									55	8	0	0	1	0	56			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000479056700032		
J	Wan, Lipeng; Xiong, Feng-Qiang; Zhang, Bingxue; Che, Ruxin; Li, Yue; Yang, Minghui								Achieving photocatalytic water oxidation on LaNbON2 under visible light irradiation								JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY				27	2			367	371		10.1016/j.jechem.2018.01.004				MAR 2018	2018	LaNbON2 has narrow bandgap and wide visible-light absorption band, yet no photocatalytic water oxidation on LaNbON2 has been reported. By a post-annealing treatment in Ar, anion vacancies were brought into LaNbON2 as shown by EPR spectroscopy. These could act as donors in the semiconductor. And consequently the oxidative power of holes was enhanced as indicated by the difference between fermi level and valence band maximum (EF-EVBM) evaluated from valence band XPS. The annealed LaNbON2 photocatalyst acquired water oxidation ability for the first time, which was improved by combining CoOx as cocatalyst. Annealed LaNbON2 derived from La3NbO7 had smaller particle size, higher concentration of anion vacancies, bigger EF-EVBM and better performance for photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction than LaNbON2 derived from LaNbO4.

Herein, this work reports a metal-organic framework derived 2D nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes/graphene hybrid as the efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc-air batteries. The as-obtained hybrid exhibits excellent catalytic activity and durability for the oxygen electrochemical reactions due to the synergistic effect by the hierarchical structure and heteroatom doping. The assembled rechargeable zinc-air battery achieves a high power density of 253 mW cm(-2) and specific capacity of 801 mAh g(Zn)(-1) with excellent cycle stability of over 3000 h at 5 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the flexible solid-state rechargeable zinc-air batteries assembled by this hybrid oxygen electrocatalyst exhibits a high discharge power density of 223 mW cm(-2), which can power 45 light-emitting diodes and charge a cellphone.

However, Si self-passivates during the oxygen evolution half reaction and requires a protection layer to maintain high photoanodic efficiency. Thin evaporated metallic Ni layers have been reported to protect Si while also enhancing the kinetics for oxygen evolution. Maximizing performance of these and related protected/ catalyzed semiconductors requires a fundamental understanding of the semiconductor|catalyst|solution interface. We use dual-working-electrode (DWE) photoelectrochemistry measurements to directly measure the interface's electronic properties in situ during operation. By controlling the Ni thickness (3, 5, and 20 nm), we confirm that favorable shifts in photocurrent onset are correlated with thinner protection layers. Photoelectrochemical DWE measurements are used to test various prevailing hypotheses for the origin of this behavior. We find evidence that increased photovoltage is due to the development of a spatially inhomogeneous buried junction wherein high barrier regions arise via adventitious SiO2 growth. Thinner protection layers more readily promote this behavior by facilitating solution permeation to the n-Si| Ni interface. Repeated electrochemical cycling of thicker catalyst layers can achieve similar behavior and improve the photocurrent onset by as much as 300 mV. The results are discussed in the context of the general design principles for metal-insulator-semiconductor protected photoanodes.									76	0	0	0	7	0	75			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000395679100016

This study introduces a one-pot surfactant-free polyol reduction method to disperse iridium nanoparticles on a tungsten doped titanium oxide (WxTi1-xO2) support. The polyol reduction approach for the Ir/WxTi1- xO2 catalyst synthesis was systematically investigated to determine the influence of synthesis parameters on the catalysts' physical properties, and its electrochemical activity and durability. The most promising synthesized catalyst with 38 wt% Ir (Ir-38 %/WxTi1-xO2) demonstrated five times higher mass activity than an Ir-black baseline (the industry standard catalyst) based on rotating-disk electrode (RDE) studies. When tested in a real water electrolyzer system, the synthesized catalyst enabled the Ir loading to be lowered by an order of magnitude while retaining a similar electrolyzer performance found for the baseline Ir-black catalyst. The Ir (38 %)/WxTi1- O-x(2) catalyst also demonstrated remarkable stability, e.g., only small voltage (<20 mV) increase was observed during a 1200-hour durability test at a constant current density of 1500 mA/cm(2).

Herein we configure porous Co3O4/C nanowire arrays (NAs) by thermally annealing a Co-based metal-organic framework (Co-MOF) in Ar and air, respectively. The hybrid Co3O4/C NAs demonstrate a high specific capacitance of 1.32 F cm(-2) at a current density of 1 mA cm(-2), which is much superior to that of bare Co3O4 NAs. A highly stable symmetric supercapacitor based on Co3O4/C exhibits an excellent durability with only 21.7% capacitance decay after 5000 cycles. Besides electrochemical energy storage, the Co3O4/C hybrids demonstrate an outstanding electrochemical catalysis ability for the oxygen evolution reaction, identified by the high current density of 30 mA cm(-2) at low overpotential (eta(30) = 318 mV) and a small Tafel slope (81 mV dec(-1)). The electrical conductivity of the interconnected C infrastructures and ion diffusion within the hierarchical pores are intrinsic causes to promote the pseudo-capacitive performance and enhance catalytic activity. The synthesis strategy reported here opens an avenue to design high performance electrodes for energy storage and electrochemical catalysis.									147	5	0	0	6	0	149			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000387166900028

Here, an effective strategy is demonstrated to stabilize alpha-Co(OH)(2) under harsh alkaline electrochemical condition by coordination polyhedron pinning (MoO42-, WO42-) on the surface for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The addition of MoO42- in 1 M KOH can inhibit the attack of hydroxyl ions on oxygen vacan- cies in alpha-Co(OH)(2), and simultaneously modulate the electronic structure of active sites for HER. The theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that MoO42- can be riveted on the surface of alpha-Co(OH)(2) to greatly stabilize oxygen vacancies and inhibit the formation of soluble ions of Co(OH)(3)(-). The resultant active sites exhibit reduced maximum energy barriers for the optimized alkaline HER. Additionally, MoO42- near the interface between alpha-Co(OH)(2) and electrolyte can alleviate the accumulation of hydroxyl ions on alpha-Co(OH)(2) due to the electrostatic repulsion, improving the stability toward HER. This work offers insight into the role of coordination polyhedron ions in regulating and enhancing the stability of alpha-Co(OH)(2) for various potential electrochemical applications in alkaline electrolyte.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000855467100001

The effects of the reductants (ethylene glycol, methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol), NaOH addition, the reactants, and the reaction temperature on the structure and morphology of the reaction product were investigated. In the first route, Cu-BTC derived CCO (CCO1) nanocrystals with a size of similar to 214 nm and a specific surface area of 4.93 m(2) g(-1) were prepared by using Cu-BTC and Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O as the Cu and Co source, respectively. In the second route, ZIF-67 derived CCO (CCO2) nanocrystals with a size of similar to 146 nm and a specific surface area of 11.69 m(2) g(-1) were prepared by using ZIF-67 and Cu(NO3)(2)center dot 3H(2)O as the Co and Cu source, respectively. Moreover, the OER performances of Ni foam supported CCO1 (Ni@CCO1) and CCO2 (Ni@CCO2) electrodes were evaluated in 1.0 M KOH solution. Ni@CCO2 demonstrates a better OER catalytic performance with a lower overpotential of 394.5 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a smaller Tafel slope of 82.6 mV dec(-1), and long-term durability, which are superior to those of some previously reported delafossite oxide or perovskite oxide catalysts. This work reveals the preparation method and application potential of CCO electrocatalysts by using Cu-BTC/ZIF-67 as the precursor, providing a new approach for the preparation of delafossite oxide CCO and the enhancement of their OER performances.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000826188600001	35842940

Herein, we report a hybrid material bearing a three-dimensional (3D) core-shell hierarchical structure, in which binary metal-organic framework nanosheets (NiFe-MOF NSs) are rationally decorated on NiSe(x)nanosheet (NS) arrays supported on Ni foam (NF). With this approach, the highly conductive NiSe(x)NSs ensure rapid charge transfer, the NiFe-MOF NSs provide a large number of exposed active sites, and the 3D hierarchical structure benefits gas release and electrolyte diffusion. As a result the NiFe-MOF/NiSex/NF electrode delivers current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2)at overpotentials of 198 and 230 mV and reveals a low Tafel slope of 30.6 mV dec(-1)toward the OER. When NiFe-MOF/NiSex/NF was used as both the anode and cathode for overall water splitting, the potential to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)was 1.59 V, lower than that for the benchmark IrO2/NF(+)||Pt/C/NF(-) system (1.66 V at 10 mA cm(-2)).									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000562931300009

After anion-exchange, NiMn LDH was exfoliated into unilamellar nanosheets. Subsequent flocculation of NiMn LDH nanosheets with (reduced) graphene oxide (GO/rGO) into superlattice composites was achieved and further tested as electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The face-to-face heteroassembly of NiMn LDH nanosheets with conductive rGO at an alternating sequence resulted in a small overpotential of 0.26 V and a Tafel slope of 46 mV per decade, which is much superior to as-exfoliated nanosheets. The analyses of electrochemical activity surface area (ECSA) and impedance spectra clearly indicated that the superlattice structure was ideal in facilitating the migration/transfer of the charge and reactants, revealing the electrochemical energetics and mechanism behind the synergistic effect arising from molecular hybridization. The proof of concept toward total water splitting using the newly developed hybrid electrocatalyst was demonstrated by an electrolysis cell powered by a single AA battery.									106	7	0	0	2	0	108			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000376047200058	27142232

However, existing doping methods face the challenge of simultaneous control over the morphology, crystallinity, dopant distribution and concentration at the nanometer scale. Here, we present a controllable and reliable method, which combines versatile solution phase chemistry and rapid flame annealing process (sol-flame), to dope TiO2 NWs with cobalt (Co). The sol-flame doping method not only preserves the morphology and crystallinity of the TiO2 NWs, but also allows fine control over the Co dopant profile by varying the concentration of Co precursor solution. Characterizations of the TiO2: Co NWs show that Co dopants exhibit 2+ oxidation state and substitutionally occupy Ti sites in the TiO2 lattice. The Co dopant concentration significantly affects the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of TiO2:Co NWs, and the TiO2:Co NWs with 12 at% of Co on the surface show the highest OER activity with a 0.76 V reduction of the overpotential with respect to undoped TiO2 NWs. This enhancement of OER activity for TiO2:Co NWs is attributed to both improved surface charge transfer kinetics and increased bulk conductivity.									41	0	0	0	3	0	41			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000337122000051	24820239

But the lack of inexpensive bifunctional efficient electrocatalysts, which can simultaneously boost oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), critically hinders their application. Herein, CoO/CoP heterostructured ultrathin nanosheets with an O-P interpenetrated interface have been synthesized through a controlled phosphatization of Co(CO3)(0.5)(OH)0.11H(2)O nanosheets, which combine the advantages of the high OER activity of CoP and the high ORR activity of CoO. ORR and OER activity are simultaneously boosted due to the interpenetration of O-P at the interface of CoO/CoP heterostructure, whose ORR or OER activity even exceeds that of parent CoO or CoP. ORR activity is in this order: CoO/CoP > Co3O4 approximate to CoO > CoP while the order for OER is CoO/CoP > CoP > Co3O4 > CoO. O-P interpenetration improves the conductivity and electron transfer of CoO or CoP owing to the interdoping effect, which is largely responsible for the simultaneous enhancement of OER and ORR activity. The initial capacity, rate capability, and cycle stability of Na-O-2 battery using CoO/CoP heterostructured nanosheets as cathode catalysts have been largely improved because of the simultaneous enhancement of OER and ORR activity. Additionally, the phase evolution of the discharged product of Na-O-2 battery is also unraveled by in situ X-ray diffraction and ex situ scanning electron microscopy. This study is also instructive to the design of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts through constructing a heterostructure with an interpenetrated interface.									65	5	0	0	3	0	66			2155-5435			WOS:000444364800127

Interestingly, the integration of Fe-III and Co-II in the same network is found to significantly influence both the porosity and the electronic state of Co-II. The CoFePi with a Fe-III to Co-II mole ratio of 0.91 has a specific surface area of 170 m(2) g(-1) and average pore size of 12.3nm, larger than those of the CoPi network; furthermore, the Co-II within such CoFePi exhibits a higher oxidation state than that in the CoPi. Due to such structural and compositional merits, the binary CoFePi network shows superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity, which gives an overpotential as low as 0.315V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 33 mV dec(-1) in 0.10 m KOH. Additionally, the trinary CoFeNiPi demonstrates similar OER catalytic performance. The two phosphate networks also exhibit remarkable catalytic stability.

The as-prepared CF-Glu-Mo and CF-Glu-CoFeNi can act as mono-functional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. In 1.0 M KOH, CF-Glu-Mo exhibits a small overpotential of 88 mV with a low Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1) under the working condition of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER, and CF-Glu-CoFeNi requires an overpotential of 290 mV for OER to reach a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), accompanied by a low Tafel slope of 115 mV dec(-1). In this case, these integrated electrodes derived from the robust interconnection between the electrocatalyst and the chitosan hydrogel derived carbon foam make the whole water decomposition behavior more direct and efficient, which is reasonably attributed to hierarchically porous nanostructures and intrinsically high conductivity. The full electrolyzer assembled with carbon cloth (CC) of CF-Glu-Mo/CC parallel to CF-Glu-CoFeNi/CC can drive full alkaline water splitting by applying a voltage of 1.65 V at a catalytic current of 10 mA cm(-2) for 24 h. Meanwhile, this work provides a feasible approach for the development of efficient water splitting electrocatalysts through the rational design and regulation of heterogeneous interfaces and nanostructures.

Here, we report on a novel templates approach to fabricate Co nanoislands activated Co,N-doped porous carbon nanospheres (Co/Co-N-x-PCNSs) bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst with high density Co-N-x, and graphitic carbon shell active sites. The obtained Co/Co-N-x-PCNSs exhibit the highest ORR activity with large E-onset (onset-potential) of 0.98 V vs RHE, more positive E-1/2 (half-wave potential) of 0.85 V vs RHE and large limited current density (j) of 6.6 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH solution. For OER, they exhibit remarkably stable OER performance with potential as low as 1.58 Vat 10.0 mA cm(-2) and the small Tafel slop of 53 mV dee(-1). The encouraging electrocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the high density of accessible active sites, low work function derived from Co nanoarchitecture activated graphitic carbon shell. The constructed Zn-air batteries display a large power density of 140 mW cm(-2) and small potential gap 0.79 V. Strategy developed herein provides a promising technique for the rationally fabrication of efficient nonprecious metal electrocatalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000608916800001

There are several stringent requirements, such as high power/energy density, good safety, and high reliability against external environmental abuse. For next-generation batteries to meet these requirements, the development of a new energy conversion system is crucial. Therefore, lithium-oxygen (lithium-O-2) batteries have attracted intensive attention, due to their high theoretical energy density, compared with those of gasoline engines. However, present lithium-O-2 batteries exhibit low round-trip efficiency and cyclic degradation, thus preventing their commercialization as next-generation power sources. This drawback may be attributed to the high thermodynamic stability of discharge products and their intrinsic insulating character, leading to the surge of polarization in oxygen reduction reactions/oxygen evolution reactions (ORRs/OERs). To alleviate cyclic degradation and improve round-trip efficiency, it has been reported that the polarization can be reduced by adopting adequate cathode catalysts, based on their surface structures regulating oxygen adsorption. Here we provide and discuss several design strategies for tailoring catalytic materials from a structural and morphological viewpoint, as well as their effect on discharge products.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			0021-2148	1869-5868		WOS:000354415600002

Alloying with Nd promoted the formation of Pb/PbOn/PbSO4 (1 <= n<2). Nd facilitated the transformation of PbOn and PbSO4 to alpha-PbO2 and beta-PbO2, at potential above 1.2 V vs Hg/Hg2SO4 (saturated K2SO4 solution). ESEM and LSV indicated that the anodic layer formed on the Pb-Ag-Nd anode was thicker and more compact than that formed on the Pb-Ag anode. Consequently, the anodic layer on the Pb-Ag-Nd anode could provide better protection for metallic substrates. EIS indicated that the OER was determined by the formation and adsorption of intermediates. Nd enhanced the OER reactivity, because of a smaller adsorption resistance and larger coverage of intermediates at the anodic layer/electrolyte interface. In summary, alloying with Nd can enhance the corrosion resistance and reduce the energy consumption of Pb-Ag anode due to lower anodic potential.									8	9	0	0	1	0	12			1000-6818			WOS:000332390600013

In this work, the n-n heterostructure CeO2 /NiFe-LDH electrocatalysts were synthesized through a simple hydrothermal reaction process. The heterostructure and morphology of feature were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope and studied for OER catalyst activity. The fabricated CeO2 /NiFe-LDH exhibited excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 246 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1), and good stability, due to the positively charged n-type semiconductor promoting the adsorption of OH , and the synergy effect of CeO2 and NiFe-LDH for the OER activity.

This study describes the enhancement of the MoS2-catalysed hydrogen evolution by incorporating metallic MoO2 as a co-catalyst introduced by coupling with MoS2 nanosheets through a facile calcination strategy, forming a Schottky junction between MoO2 and MoS2. The localized surface plasmon resonance effect induced by the oxygen vacancies and favourable Fermi lever position of MoO2 lead to a broad spectral response and a significant improvement in the exciton generation and dissociation. The electron gets transferred from the conduction band (CB) of MoS2 to MoO2, wherein MoO2 acts as an 'electron pool' that gathers the photoexcited electrons, which are rapidly shuffled to the surface of MoO2, where the redox reaction occurs due to its great metallic conductivity. Resultantly, a 242% increment in the production of hydrogen gas by MoS2/MoO2 is achieved in comparison with that of the MoS2 nanosheets.									25	1	0	0	0	0	25			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000502040600022

The single-atom Fe catalysts have a well-defined atomic dispersion of Fe atoms coordinated by Nligands on the 3D hierarchically porous carbon support. These SA-Fe-HPC catalysts are comparable to the commercial Pt/C electrode even in acidic electrolytes for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in terms of the ORR activity (E-1/2=0.81V), but have better long-term electrochemical stability (7mV negative shift after 3000potential cycles) and fuel selectivity. In alkaline media, the SA-Fe-HPC catalysts outperform the commercial Pt/C electrode in ORR activity (E-1/2=0.89V), fuel selectivity, and long-term stability (1mV negative shift after 3000potential cycles). Thus, these nSA-Fe-HPCs are promising non-platinum-group metal ORR catalysts for fuel-cell technologies.									370	29	0	0	15	0	372			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000438195200043	29920892

Practical water splitting needs not only intrinsically active catalyst materials but also the maximization of their electrocatalytic capability in a real electrolyzer. Here, we report for the first time a Ni/Ni2P inverse opal architecture fabricated by surface engineering. The superior HER properties are enabled by maximum active crystallographic plane exposure and vertical alignment of Ni2P nanosheets on nickel inverse opal. It requires an overpotential of only 73 mV to drive a HER current density of -20 mA cm(-2). After doping with Fe, the resulting Fe: Ni/Ni2P inverse electrode shows excellent OER performance with a very low overpotential (285 mV) at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2). An alkaline electrolyzer using the two 3D structured electrodes could split water at 20 mA cm(-2) with a low voltage of similar to 1.52 V for 100 h. The catalytic activity is even superior to that of the noble metal catalyst couple (IrO2-Pt/C). This work provides a surface engineered opal structure to maximize the electrocatalyst properties in the systems with coupled electron transfer and mass transport.									28	4	0	0	0	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000405689000044

The as-prepared sample exhibited heat evolution, above 330 K, due to stabilization from a metastable phase to a stable phase and to homogenization of the excess oxygen atoms over the whole polycrystalline sample. There were two phase transitions observed only for the stabilized sample; a Martensitic type at 290 K, and a second-order type at 158 K. A superconducting phase transition was observed near 41 K for both the as-prepared and the stabilized sample. A glass transition was found in the range of 130-190 K, and was interpreted to have originated from the freezing-in of the short-range rearrangement of excess oxygen atoms. Herein, the relationship between the phase transitions due to the order and/or disorder of excess oxygen atoms and to the tilt of the CuO6 octahedra is discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1098-0121			INSPEC:9394026

Although the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) by water oxidation is a critical reaction for water splitting, further investigations are needed to find the details of the OER mechanism for various electrocatalysts. More in particular for homogeneous electrocatalysts, the Randles-Sevcik equation has been extensively applied to determine the turnover frequency (TOF). Herein, using vitamin B12 as a case study, we show that the dynamical deposition/dissolution of the heterogeneous catalyst during OER makes the Randles-Sevcik equation too complicated to be used for calculating the TOF. Indeed, the conventionally applied post-characterization methods do not provide sufficient accuracy to prove the homogeneity of OER mechanisms; thus, using the Randles-Sevcik equation to calculate the TOF is not necessarily correct.

The series, consisting of mixed-metal oxides included binary and ternary mixtures containing Fe, Co and/or Ni, enabled a systematic evaluation of amorphous metal oxides with complex compositions. X-ray diffraction results indicate that the as-deposited films are amorphous and can be converted to their crystalline form by heating. Infrared spectroscopy of the films indicates the photochemically driven process drives complete loss of the organic constituents from the film. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the loss of the organic ligand and enabled estimation of metal oxidation states. Electrochemical characterization revealed significant variation in catalytic performance toward the oxygen evolving reaction (OER) upon variation of metal oxide composition. Analysis of the Tafel behavior was used to distinguish amorphous mixed-metal oxide films to enable several film compositions to exhibit excellent electrocatalytic OER performance.

The electrochemical reactions involved in water electrolysis, i.e., hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, are complex inner-sphere reactions with slow multi-electron transfer kinetics. To develop active electrocatalysts for water electrolysis, the physicochemical properties of the electrode surfaces in electrolyte solutions should be investigated and understood in detail. When electrocatalysis is conducted using nanoparticles with large surface areas and active surface states, analytical techniques with sub-nanometer resolution are required, along with material development. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is an electrochemical technique for studying the surface reactions and properties of various types of electrodes using a very small tip electrode. Recently, the morphological and chemical characteristics of single nanoparticles and bio-enzymes for catalytic reactions were studied with nanometer resolution by combining SECM with atomic force microscopy (AFM). Herein, SECM techniques are briefly reviewed, including the AFM-SECM technique, to facilitate further development and discovery of highly active, cost-effective, and robust electrode materials for efficient electrolysis and photolysis.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			2093-8551			WOS:000398291300010

Unfortunately, the green and sustainable development of electrocatalysts for water oxidation is nowadays a real challenge. Herein, a successful mechanochemical method is proposed for the synthesis of a novel hemoglobin (Hb) modified Co3O4/g-C3N4 composite nanomaterial. The controlled incorporation of cobalt entities as well as Hb functionalization, without affecting the g-C3N4 nanoarchitecture, was evaluated using different physicochemical techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, N-2-physisorption, scanning electron microscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The beneficial effect of the resulting ternary bioconjugate together with the influence of the temperature and light irradiation was investigated by electrochemical analysis. At 60 degrees C and under light exposition, this electrocatalyst requires an overpotential of 370 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2), showing a Tafel slope of 66 mV center dot dec(-1) and outstanding long-term stability for 600 OER cycles. This work paves a way for the controlled fabrication of multidimensional and multifunctional bio-electrocatalysts.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000529201500041	32242199

The high surface area of OMCs provides more active sites to adsorb metal precursors. The porous structure confines the growth of NiCo2O4 and supplies more efficient transport passage for reactant molecules to access the active sites. Due to the structural characteristics of OMCs and catalytic properties of NiCo2O4, NiCo2O4/OMCs composites are highly active, cheap, and selective noble metal-free electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline solution. The electrochemical activity of NiCo2O4 supported on three OMCs with different structures, surface areas, pore sizes, pore volumes, and defective sites is studied. NiCo2O4/OMCs composites may be further used as efficient and inexpensive noble metal-free ORR catalysts in alkaline solution. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a highly efficient electrocatalyst, reduced graphene oxide (rGO(-KOH)), applied for electrochemical H2O2 production was obtained by treating graphene oxide (GO) with KOH aqueous solution. Compared to KBH4-treated reduced graphene oxide (rGO(-KBH4)) made by KBH4 reduction method, rGO(-KOH) has more ether bonds (C-O-C) on the surface and a larger electrochemically active surface area. Benefiting from these advantages, rGO(-KOH) exhibits enhanced selectivity (similar to 100%) and mass activity for the oxygen reduction reaction through a two-electron pathway (ORR-2e) than rGO-KBH4. Meanwhile, rGO(-KOH) also shows the excellent durablity for (ORR-2e) in alkaline media. Thus, rGO(-KOH) may be an ideal electrocatalyst for H2O2 electroproduction. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A reasonable strategy for the synthesis of electrocatalysts is one of the most promising ways for developing precious metal-free ORR catalysts. Herein, the synthesis of a highly active Fe3O4-based catalyst using a facile molten salts method is proposed. The electrocatalytic analysis shows superior ORR performance with an admirable half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.83 V), comparable with the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. In contrast, primary Zn-air battery, using synthesized Fe,S-N-C as an air-cathode, displays an open-circuit potential of 1.44 V and a high power density of 84.3 mW cm(-2).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000487814700001

The redox-active tyrosine, Y-z, is the component at which the proton currents necessary for water oxidation are switched on. The thermodynamic and kinetic implications of this function for Y-z are discussed. These considerations also provide insight into the related roles of Y-z in preserving the high photochemical quantum efficiency in Photosystem II (PSII) and of conserving the highly oxidizing conditions generated by the photochemistry in the PSII reaction center. The oxidation of Y-z by P-680(+) can be described well by a treatment that invokes proton coupling within the context of non-adiabatic electron transfer. The reduction of Y-z(.), however, appears to proceed by an adiabatic process that may have hydrogen-atom transfer character. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Herein, a facile strategy is employed to synthesize FeS2/CoS2 nanoparticles anchored on N, S co-doped carbon nanotubes (NSCNTs). The obtained FeS2/CoS2/NSCNTs displays superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for both ORR and OER in an alkaline electrolyte, with a relative low potential difference value of only 0.66 V. Importantly, FeS2/CoS2/NSCNTs based solid-state ZAB endows a high specific capacity of 786.9 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), outstanding long-term charge-discharge stability over 70 h, as well as excellent flexibility. This research provides a new pathway for the construction of robust and low-cost bifunctional catalysts for ZABs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000822749100002

The pyrolysis produces benzene, toluene, methane, hydrogen, soot, and carbon oxides:. The rate constant for naphthalene pyrolysis in SCW was found to be k = 10(12.3+/-0.2)exp(-E/T) s(-1) where E = 35400+/-500 K. For T > 660 degreesC, water participates in the chemical reactions of naphthalene conversion, Particularly, in the formation of carbon oxides. The conversion of naphthalene in pure SCW is accompanied by heat evolution. Molecular oxygen oxidizes a part of naphthalene completely, i.e., to CO2 and H2O, this reaction being so prompt that in some cases, self-heating of the mixture and thermal explosion in the reactor were observed.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1066-5285	1573-9171		WOS:000173525900023

In particular, it is still a considerable challenge since the HER kinetics of Pt in alkaline solutions is about two to three orders of magnitude lower than that in acidic conditions. Herein, a heterogeneous yolk-shell nanostructure with Rh nanoparticles embedded in S, N co-doped carbon nanospheres prepared by a facile self-template method is reported. The optimized electrocatalyst can achieve an extremely small overpotential of 13.5 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), low Tafel slope of 25.5 mV dec(-1), high turnover frequency of 0.143 s(-1) (at -75 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode), and long-term durability for 10 h, which is the record-high alkaline HER activity among the ever-reported noble metal based catalysts. These striking performances are ascribed to the optimized electronic structure and unique heterogeneous yolk-shell nanostructure. More importantly, it is also demonstrated that the obtained electrocatalyst exhibits superior activities in all pH range, which is better than commercial Pt/C and Rh/C catalysts. This work proves that Rh-based nanomaterials are promising superior electrocatalysts in a wide pH range and nanostructure design is a powerful tool to increase the mass/electron transfer during reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000822057800001

Then, the heat generated by the oxidation promotes further oxidation, resulting in ignition. In order to prevent this phenomenon, it is necessary to understand the initial stage of oxidation of coal in the condition of heat-accumulation. Conventionally, there are very few researches to understand the early stage of coal oxidation. In this study, we aimed at to elucidate the earlier oxidation stage of coals by employing low temperature oxidation of a mass of coals and several instrumental analysis techniques. The oxidation we used were heating 50 g of coal charged in a stainless steel closed container at 80 degrees C for 24 h by flowing hot air to simulate the self-exothermic reaction condition. XRD and Raman spectroscopic measurements showed that the carbon skeleton structure of coal did not change by the oxidation treatment, while FTIR, H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR measurements showed a decrease in aliphatic side chains and an increase in hydroxyl groups in coal. The information obtained here will help to understand the whole process of self-exothermic reaction of coal to prevent burning.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0915-1559	1347-5460		WOS:000483909300015

The reaction equilibrium and regulation mechanism of CLGCS were analyzed in Ellingham diagrams via theoretical calculation. Variable conditions were designed and performed to investigate the reaction performance of OCs. The intermetallic synergy was analyzed, and the improvement order of heterologous metal on lattice oxygen transfer of OCs was Co2O3 > NiO > CeO2 > CaO. The NiO modified sample exhibited excellent reaction behavior in CLGCS, which provided active sites for catalytic cracking of tar in CLG stage and activating CO2 molecules in splitting stage. Syngas with heating value 13.32 MJ/m(3) and carbon conversion 74.18% were achieved in CLG stage, corresponding to CO2 conversion 64.09% and CO yield 23.59 mmol/g in splitting stage. High temperature enhanced the endothermic reactions in CLGCS process, and the biomass occurrence ratio indicated a positive correlation with CO2 splitting. Although some OC particles agglomerated in reaction process, the pore structure and reactivity remained stable. After 20 cyclic reaction tests, the carbon conversion in CLG stage and CO2 conversion in splitting stage were kept at 67.52% and 73.5%, respectively. The reaction path of CLGCS with NiO modified OC was summarized as: Fe2O3/NiFe2O4 -> Fe/FeO/Ni -> Fe3O4/Ni. Fe2O3/NiFe2O4.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0196-8904	1879-2227		WOS:000830157300004

One is that bulk materials limit the exposure of active sites, and the other is that controllable assembly of specific structures is difficult to achieve. In this work, based on the exfoliation-assembly strategy, we, for the first time, report novel tiled/standing structures of NiAl-LDH/RGO nanohybrids as highly efficient catalyst for water oxidation in 1.0M KOH solution. Interestingly, based on our mass protocol, we were surprised to find that there are dynamic evolution structures between NiAl-LDH nanosheets and GO nanosheets (GO-NS). Unambiguous evidences prove the LDH-NS tiling/standing on GO-NS that forms a periodic (LDH/GO)(n) superlattice, which was proposed for the first time. NiAl-LDH/RGO-5 (NG-5) nanohybrids possess the lattice unit where LDH-NS are well-organized standing on GO-NS, exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performances with low overpotential of 180mV and 220mV at current density of 50mAcm(-2) and 100mAcm(-2), and low onset potential of 1.345V (vs. RHE). In addition, at potential of 1.7V (vs. RHE), NG-5 composite can drive large current densities of 595mAcm(-2); it is better than those of pure NiAl-LDH (123mAcm(-2)). Furthermore, NG-5 composite exhibits an excellent long-term electrochemical stability for 10h remained 95.28%. The outstanding electrocatalytic properties above suggest that NG-5 composite is a candidate for the substitution of noble-metal-based catalyst for OER.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000462633100017

Five representative structural units including aliphatic bridge, aromatic cluster, aromatic ether, alkyl and oxygen-containing bridge are selected to build kerogen network model according to its structural characteristics. Kerogen pyrolysis involves in four processes including initial cracking, aliphatic chain reaction, aromatization and condensation expressed by eight chain reactions. Specific volatile products are attributed to various fragments from kerogen network and classified into seven types on the basis of structural features, which allows model to provide product composition. Oil shale is simplified as a linear combination of kerogen and minerals. Model predictions for kerogen and oil shale are compared with experiment data in fixed bed and thermogravimetry analysis. In conclusion, model reflects kerogen pyrolysis based on its structural characteristics and provides reasonable prediction on product distribution.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000461758800019

The unique hierarchical porous structure, heterogeneous (Ni2P and Co2P) composition and carbon framework of the NixCoy-P hybrids were characterized by scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope, which endowed handy ion diffusion path, synergistically active sites and high conductivity for OER. The as-fabricated Ni1Co1-P catalyst exhibited more excellent OER activity than other phosphides (Ni-P, Ni3Co1-P, Ni1Co3-P and Co-P). More remarkably, the Ni1Co1-P supported on Ni foam (NF) exhibits low overpotential (eta(35)) of 300 mV at a current density of 35 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 71 mV dec(-1) and excellent stability for OER in 1.0 M KOH solution. This work provides a general strategy to design more efficient multi-metallic component OER electrocatalysts. (C) 2020 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

Further, CoS/CNT composite was studied by X-ray diffraction studies, Field-emission scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to study the crystallinity, surface morphology, chemical composition and chemical states respectively. Electrochemical studies show the appearance of reversible redox peaks, indicating a pseudocapacitive nature of CoS/CNT nanocomposite electrodes. The electrochemical measurements show that CoS/CNT nanocomposite electrode is catalytically more active for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 347 mV and a current density of 15 mA/cm(2) (Tafel slope of 142 mV/decade) in alkaline solution. The low charge transfer resistance and high double layer capacitance of CoS/CNT studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The stability and amperometry studies also confirmed that CoS/CNT nanocomposite is able to maintain excellent performance even after 500 cycles without any degradation.									41	0	0	0	2	0	41			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000452842500098

The highly exothermic, self-sustaining, and aluminothermic reaction (10/3 Al + TiO2 + B2O3 = 5/3 Al2O3 + TiB2, Delta H = 2,710 kJ/mol) occurs in the absence of oxygen. Eventually, triggering the self-sustaining reaction on compacts formed from a ball-milled derived mixture, consisted of Al particles coated with TiO2 and B2O3 nano-particles, resulted in the spontaneous formation of a ceramic phasemixture consisted of alumina particles coated with TiB2 and Ti2O3 nano-particles. The highly exothermic character of the reaction enabled the sintering of the coated Al2O3 particles into a dense unique microstructure.					151st Annual Meeting and Exhibition of The-Minerals-Metals-and-Materials-Society (TMS)151st Annual Meeting and Exhibition of The-Minerals-Metals-and-Materials-Society (TMS)	FEB 27-MAR 03, 2022FEB 27-MAR 03, 2022	Minerals Metals & Mat SocMinerals Metals & Mat Soc	Anaheim, CAAnaheim, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2367-1181	2367-1696	978-3-030-92381-5; 978-3-030-92380-8	WOS:000775473000006

A systematic investigation to understand its catalytic activity towards both HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium is important, but rare. It was found that iron sulphides have inferior H-adsorption efficiency, which hindered their HER catalytic activity. Herein, a novel strategy was undertaken to obtain pyrites having different crystallite sizes and lattice strains. Changes in these crystal parameters affected the physicochemical phenomena occurring at the electrode-electrolyte interface which in turn influenced the electrocatalytic activity of the FeS2 and also altered the pathways of the reactions. The pyrite with the lowest lattice strain and crystallite size (FS3) showed superior catalytic activity towards both HER and OER. The overall water-splitting activity of FS3 was comparable with the state-of-the-art RuO2-Pt/C couple. Moreover, the synthesized pyrites showed the capability to overcome the previously mentioned drawback i.e., inferior H-adsorption efficiency. The pyrite FeS2 could be a potential candidate as a cheap and efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. This investigation demonstrates that modulation of crystal parameters can be an efficient technique to tune the activity of an electrocatalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0250-4707	0973-7669		WOS:000659192500002

It is shown that, in the course of charge-exchange reactions, O (2) (-) ions rapidly transform into ions with a larger electron bound energy (such as O (3) (-) and NO (3) (-) ); in humid air, they also transform into hydrated ions NO (3) (-) (H(2)O) (n) . As a result, the efficiency of primary electron production in the streamer head due to destruction of residual negative ions generated in the previous pulse decreases substantially.									23	2	0	0	0	0	25			1063-780X			WOS:000282180600008		
J	Bhowmik, Tanmay; Kundu, Manas Kumar; Barman, Sudip					Barman, Sudip/0000-0002-4285-9417			Growth of One-Dimensional RuO2 Nanowires on g-Carbon Nitride: An Active and Stable Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution Reactions at All pH Values								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				8	42			28678	28688		10.1021/acsami.6b10436				OCT 26 2016	2016	Development of highly efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is essential for efficient solar fuel generation. The commercial RuO2 or RuO2-based catalysts are highly active toward OER, but their poor stability under different operating conditions is the main obstacle for their commercialization. Herein, we report growth of one-dimensional highly crystalline RuO2 nanowires on carbon nitride (1D-RuO2-CNx) for their applications in HER and OER at all pH values. The 1D-RuO2-CNx, as an OER catalyst, exhibits a low onset overpotential of similar to 200 mV in both acidic and basic media, whereas Tafel slopes are 52 and 56 mV/dec in acidic and basic media, respectively. This catalyst requires a low overpotential of 250 and 260 mV to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic and basic media, respectively. The mass activity of 1D-RuO2-CNx catalyst is 352 mA mg(-1), which is similar to 14 times higher than that of commercial RuO2. Most importantly, the 1D-RuO2-CNx catalyst has remarkably higher stability compared to commercial RuO2. This catalyst also exhibits superior HER activity with a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at similar to 93 and 95 mV in acidic and basic media. The HER Tafel slopes of this catalyst are 40 mV/dec in acidic condition and 70 mV/dec in basic condition. The HER activity of this catalyst is slightly lower than Pt/C in acidic media, whereas in basic media it is comparable or even better than that of Pt/C at higher overpotentials. The HER stability of this catalyst is also better than that of Pt/C in all pH solutions. This superior catalytic activity of 1D-RuO2-CNx composite can be attributed to catalyst-support interaction, enhanced mass and electron transport, one-dimensional morphology, and highly crystalline rutile RuO2 structure.									123	3	0	0	2	0	123			1944-8244			WOS:000386540300047	27700048

The temporal profiles of these products enable the derivation of a mechanism for the photochemical reactions in this system: dissociation of O-2 first-generated (OP)-P-3 that reacted with nearby N-2 to yield N2O. Other products resulted from the secondary photolysis of N2O and the reactions of O with N2O. The reaction of O with O-2 to form O-3 was impeded by the small concentration of the latter, which requires substantial migration through the N-2 lattice. However, sufficient O-3 was eventually formed to enable detection either directly from O coming from O-2 or indirectly through N2O. These results enhance our understanding of the evolution of the transformation of oxygen and nitrogen in irradiated ices and have possible astrophysical applications.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000443814100009

Thereby, the microstructure evolution during laser beam welding depends on the chemical composition of the alloy as well as of the gaseous environment. As a result of reactions in a phosphorus rich copper melt, copper phosphides are formed which are located inside the grains as well as at the grain boundaries. Meanwhile, the formation of phosphorus pentoxide and an uncomplete decomposition of copper-I-oxide to elemental copper and phosphorus pentoxide were identified at the keyhole. Thereby, the decomposition of copper-I-oxide depends on the oxygen concentration. Thus, a complete decomposition of copper-I-oxide to elemental copper and phosphorus pentoxide was observed at the bottom side of the welding region due to a higher oxygen concentration.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0933-5137	1521-4052		WOS:000717604600004

It was found that the molecular structure of PCS was strongly dependent on the reaction time and reaction temperature. Shorter reaction time or lower reaction temperature is preferred to produce higher concentration of HSiC3 group, and less SiC4 group in PCS skeleton, which was confirmed by Si-29 NMR analysis. Higher reaction temperature or longer reaction time tended to dissociate more Si-Si chains to give PCS with higher molecular weight and broader distribution, as verified by GPC characterization. By interrupting the structure evolution of PCS from PDMS at low reaction temperature with short reaction time, solid PCS with controllable molecular structure can be obtained after the removal of the low molecular fraction by precipitation with ethanol. A scissor-couple rearrangement model was proposed for the formation of the PCS skeleton. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.									15	4	0	0	0	0	17			0021-8995	1097-4628		WOS:000255043100044

AbstractMetal-air batteries, like Zn-air batteries (ZABs) are usually suffered from low energy conversion efficiency and poor cyclability caused by the sluggish OER and ORR at the air cathode. Herein, a novel bimetallic Co/CoFe nanomaterial supported on nanoflower-like N-doped graphitic carbon (NC) was prepared through a strategy of coordination construction-cation exchange-pyrolysis and used as a highly efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst. Experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal the formation of Co/CoFe heterostructure and synergistic effect between metal layer and NC support, leading to improved electric conductivity, accelerated reaction kinetics, and optimized adsorption energy for intermediates of ORR and OER. The Co/CoFe@NC exhibits high bifunctional activities with a remarkably small potential gap of 0.70 V between the half-wave potential (E-1/2) of ORR and the potential at 10 mA cm(2) (E-j=10) of OER. The aqueous ZAB constructed using this air electrode exhibits a slight voltage loss of only 60 mV after 550-cycle test (360 h, 15 days). A sodium polyacrylate (PANa)-based hydrogel electrolyte was synthesized with strong water-retention capability and high ionic conductivity. The quasi-solid-state ZAB by integrating the Co/CoFe@NC air electrode and PANa hydrogel electrolyte demonstrates excellent mechanical stability and cyclability under different bending states.									33	1	0	0	2	0	33			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000658429800001	34138326

However, the PEC performance is still restricted by inefficient charge transfer at the semiconductor/cocatalyst interface. In this study, ultrathin Ti3C2 nanosheets, serving as a highly efficient hole transport layer, were introduced into the Fe2O3/CoAl-layered double hydroxide (LDH) interface. The obtained Fe2O3-Ti3C2-CoAl photoanodes exhibited a significantly improved photocurrent density of 2.1 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5G illumination. In this system, the Ti3C2 nanolayer not only suppresses the interfacial recombination of photogenerated carriers but also facilitates efficient hole transfer from Fe2O3 to the OER cocatalyst, thus promoting the PEC performance. This study provides a new guideline for optimizing the charge transfer at the semiconductor/cocatalyst interface.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000713153100001

The results obtained by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the initial oxidation has parabolic kinetics in the temperatures between 800-945 degreesC. The oxidation process exhibited temperature dependence with an activation energy of 195 +/- 15 kJ/mol in air and in pure oxygen atmosphere. Two possible reactions, either the evaporation of B2O3 species (occurring greater than or equal to945 degreesC) or the oxidation of surface LaB6 (less than or equal to 800 degreesC), influence the oxidation mechanism to be interfacial reaction control, which results in mass loss deviating from parabolic behavior. The details of the microstructure evolution of the formation of glass and crystalline La(BO2)(3) grains are investigated. The effects of porosity, the melting of La(BO2)(3), Coarsening of La(BO2)(3) grains are reported and discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Data show that the alteration in the organization of the photosystem 11 (PSII) supercomplex, i.e. the amount and the organization of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein complex (LHCII), which strongly modifies the electric properties of the membranes, influences both the energy redistribution between the two photosystems and the oxygen production reaction. The decrease of surface electric parameters (charge density and dipole moments), associated with increased degree of LHCII oligomerization, correlates with the strong reduction of the energy transfer from PSII to PSI. In the studied pea thylakoid membranes (wild types Borec, Auralia and their mutants Coerideovireus 2/16, Costata2/133, Chlorolica XV/1422) with enhanced degree of oligornerization of LHCII was observed: (i) an increase of the So populations of PSII in darkness; (ii) an increase of the misses; (iii) an alteration of the decay kinetics of the oxygen bursts under continuous irradiation. There is a strict correlation between the degree of LHCII oligornerization in the investigated pea mutants and the ratio of functionally active PSII alpha to PSII beta centers, while in thylakoid membranes without oligomeric structure of LHCII (Chlorina f2 barley mutant) the PSII alpha centers are not registered.

Herein, we employ methods rooted in genetic algorithms and grand canonical Monte-Carlo simulations to determine relevant structures of a gold clusters placed on a ceria support in oxygen atmosphere. Based on optimized structures, microkinetics simulations identify relevant structures present under the out-of-equilibrium conditions of the ongoing CO oxidation reaction. The results emphasize the role of cationic gold atoms at the interface between gold and ceria, which bind oxygen atoms strongly. At low temperature and low CO/O-2 ratio, the catalytic cycle for a 6-atom gold cluster mainly involves the Au6O3 and Au6O2 couple via the associative O-2 mechanism of CO oxidation. At higher CO/O-2 ratio and elevated temperature, the Au6O and Au-6 couple are the dominant active species. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Here we report a dealloyed ternary intermetallic compound of PtFeAl with a nanoporous structure composed of a (Pt1-xFex)(3)Al (x = 0.167) core with Pt skin [NP (Pt1-xFex)(3)Al/Pt]. As an oxygen reduction reaction catalyst, NP (Pt1-xFex)(3)Al/Pt exhibits exceptional durability in long-term electrochemical cycling, with specific and mass activities of 3.97 mA cm(Pt)(-2) and 1.94 A mg(Pt)(-1), respectively (similar to 10.2- and similar to 14.9-fold higher than those of commercially available Pt/C). This is due to strong Pt-Al and Fe-Al bonds, which not only weaken the adsorption energy of the Pt skin but also inhibit the evolution of Pt, Fe and Al atoms. The outstanding performance makes this a promising candidate as a cathode catalyst in PEM fuel cells as well as in other electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices, such as metal-air batteries.									17	2	0	0	1	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000390433700026

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as one of the fundamental reactions for energy utilization, has drawn a lot of attention. Understanding the reaction process and exploring the active sites are extremely important for designing new catalysts and improving the catalytic ability. In this paper, the interdigitated array (IDA) electrodes, which show high collection efficiency and sensitivity, are proposed to explore the catalytic ability and the reaction process. With this special tool, the in situ preparation of nitrogen-doped carbon (N/C) has been realized with the pyrolysis of polyaniline (PANI) on the IDA electrodes directly. Two things should be noticed: First, this method can be used as a simple way to obtain the N/C and be used as a potential substitution catalyst for the noble metal towards the ORR for its low cost and relatively high activity; Second, the in situ preparation of catalyst on the electrode surface largely eliminated the possible electron transfer barrier between the catalyst and the electrode surface, and the high collection efficiency of the IDA electrodes ensures the detection of species with low concentration or short lifetime, therefore, the sensitivity of detection is largely improved. It demonstrates that the polyaniline-derived N/C was successfully synthesized on the micron-sized electrode surface with precise control of boundaries. The electron transfer number and corresponding percentage yield of H2O2 were detected and calculated in real time. The catalyst prepared with 700 degrees C shows the highest electron transfer numbers in the reaction process and the lowest percentage yield of H2O2. The content of the pyridinic nitrogen may play a crucial role in catalyzing the ORR. The idea of in situ synthetization and investigation of reaction process with IDA electrodes can be applied to study other catalytic reactions and explore the catalytic reaction process as well.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000808406700003

However, simple fabrication of multilayered core-shell structured micro/nanomaterials with a consistent composition still faces a great challenge. Herein, a simple one-step solvothermal method is used to fabricate Cu-based metal organic framework multilayer core-shell microspheres (Cu-MOF-MCSMSs) as efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts. The systematic structural evolution of Cu-MOF-MCSMSs is from microspheres to core-shell microspheres and then to multilayer core-shell microspheres. Additionally, different transition metal cations and anions can also influence the structures, compositions and thus ORR activities of the synthesized MOFs. The representative Cu-MOF-MCSMSs exhibit high ORR activity and cycling stability. The simple method can provide a good guide to fabricate other micro/nanomaterials with multilayer core-shell structures and desirable properties.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000772916400001	35333276	
J	Hiratsuka, K.; Abe, T.; Kajdas, C.								Tribocatalytic oxidation of ethylene in the rubbing of palladium against aluminum oxide								TRIBOLOGY INTERNATIONAL				43	9			1659	1664		10.1016/j.triboint.2010.03.014				SEP 2010	2010	Friction experiments of palladium rubbed against aluminum oxide in ethylene/oxygen mixed atmosphere have been carried out. The complete oxidation of ethylene to carbon dioxide and water at room temperature was demonstrated. The evolution of carbon dioxide was initiated just after the start of friction; momentarily the pressure reached its equilibrium whereas water was produced gradually. On the other hand, by heating the palladium wire in the same partial pressure of both gases, carbon monoxide and hydrogen were generated at 600K and above. By increasing oxygen partial pressure, carbon dioxide and water were produced. These results indicate that the ethylene oxidation activity on palladium catalyst is enhanced by the friction of catalyst. Two kinds of reactions, fast and slow, are attributed to near-contact and out-of-contact activities of friction surfaces. The near-contact reaction is governed by tribo-electron emission, whereas the out-of-contact activity is due to the generated nascent surface. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, once combined with a photoanode, detailed discussions of the light-induced processes on metal/semiconductor junction remain largely inadequate. Here, by employing in situ X-ray scattering/diffraction and absorption spectroscopy, the generation of a photoinduced adaptive structure is discovered at the interfacial metal-semiconductor (M-S) junction between a state-of-the-art porous silicon wire and nickel electrocatalyst, where oxygen evolution occurs under illumination. The adaptive layer in M-S junction through the light-induced activation can enhance the voltage by 247 mV (to reach a photocurrent density of 10 mA cm(-2)) with regard to the fresh photoanode, and increase the photocurrent density by six times at the potential of 1.23 V versus reversible reference electrode (RHE). This photoinduced adaptive layer offers a new perspective regarding the catalytic behavior of catalysts, especially for the photocatalytic water splitting of the system, and acting as a key aspect in the development of highly efficient photoelectrodes.									27	0	0	0	3	0	27			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000475162600001

In particular, we can obtain numerical values for various lateral interactions by simulating temperature-programmed desorption spectra and fitting the simulated spectra to the experimental ones using evolution strategies.

We find that low-mass, metal-rich (Z greater than or equal to 0.001) structures climbing the red giant branch never attain the physical conditions suitable for the onset of this chain, while at lower metallicities the energy contribution by the NCO reaction is too low to affect the onset of the central He flash. At the same time, our evolutionary models suggest that for a carbon-oxygen white dwarf of mass M-WD = 0.6 M. accreting He-rich matter at rates suitable for a dynamical He flash, directly or as a by-product of an overlying H-burning shell, the NCO energy contribution is not able to keep the He shell hot enough to avoid the occurrence of a strong electron degeneracy and the ensuing final explosion.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0004-637X			WOS:000171001900037

Three possible mechanisms of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) following four one-electron pathway are investigated. The hydroxyl (OH) species as a key intermediate is found to strongly interact with the catalyst and its newly observed stability indeed significantly affects the overpotential of OER. On pure g-C3N4, the first removal of proton from water, the rate-determining step, can not become surmountable at room temperature until an overpotential of 0.88V (2.11V vs SHE) is appended, in accord with the experimental observation that water photooxidaton hardly occurs on g-C3N4 without any modification. Interestingly, the sulfur doping not only leads to a different reaction mechanism but also lowers the overpotential, consistent with the experimental finding that the reaction rate for OER could be further enhanced by sulfur-modified g-C3N4. Our theoretical results provide useful insights for designing better anodes to achieve high OER activity on graphitic carbon nitride based photocatalysts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To explore more efficient catalytic materials, MoS(2)nano-flowers stacked by ultrathin sheets werein situgrown on oxygen self-doped porous biochar (OPC). The resultant MoS2/OPC composites with large exposed surface sites could be helpful to charge migration, and adsorption and activation of inert N(2)molecules, which are favorable for excellent and stable photocatalytic N(2)reduction reaction (NRR) in pure water. As a result, the productivity of ammonia is significantly improved by MoS2/OPC and the NH(3)generation rate is as high as 37.878 mu mol . g(-1) . h(-1).

Herein, we propose an extremely simple soaking method for achieving in situ fabrication of a continuous mesoporous PtRu film on macroporous Ni foam (mPtRu-NF). Owing to its continuous mesoporous structure and bi-metallic compositions, the mPtRu-NF exhibits high activity and durability for both the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, when the mPtRu-NF was used as a binder-free air electrode for rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs), it shows superior electrochemical performance. Being very different from previous complex de-alloying or template-based approaches, this method provides a truly simple way for achieving direct fabrication of mesoporous metallic films on metallic substrates. The proposed one-step method is readily available for scale-up fabrication of continuous mesoporous Pt-based films on metallic substrates with designed compositions and desired performances.									40	3	0	0	2	0	40			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000437469300060

This work reports the synthesis of sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P) co-doped graphene (SPG) as a support of Pt nanoparticles by a thermally annealing procedure. The employment of additional S remarkably enhances the doping content of P from 1.9% of P doped graphene (PG) to 4.6%, leading to higher defect sites for uniformly dispersing Pt nanoparticles and enhanced interactions with Pt. Compared with Pt/PG and Pt/C catalysts, the Pt/SPG catalyst exhibits over 1.2 and 1.4 times higher electrochemical surface area, 1.6 and 3.6 times higher MOR activity, respectively, and desirable stability toward the MOR. It is revealed that the Pt/SPG catalyst has a strong CO-tolerance due to the more generated oxygen-containing functional groups and the enhanced oxidation of adsorbed CO. This work provides an ideal candidate of developing heteroatoms co-doped graphene based electrocatalysts towards MOR in fuel cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to drive the process economically, highly efficient catalysts are urgently needed to overcome the constraints of high overpotential, low Faradaic efficiency, and current density of CO2RR. This Perspective summarizes the performance of Pd-containing nano-structures toward CO2RR and related reaction mechanisms. The product selectivity of the Pd catalysts strongly depends on the structure and composition, and the dynamic evolution of active phases induced by the applied potential and reaction intermediate of CO2RR Introducing a second metal can effectively suppress the decay in the catalytic performance of a Pd catalyst and further improve the activity and selectivity of CO2RR The electrochemical promotion of catalysis effect drastically improves the production rate of formate over Pd nanoparticles, which demonstrates the advantage of the coupled thermo- and electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. The challenges and tentative strategies for the further application of Pd-containing catalysts in CO2RR are also discussed.									197	18	0	0	7	0	198			2155-5435			WOS:000424735000095

Three measures were proposed to reduce the degree of decarboxylation based on theoretical calculations: increasing the monomer concentration; decreasing the solvent polarity; and altering the ring substituents so as to bypass the decarboxylation route. Experimental investigations on a number of substituted DOO (including 4-vinyl-1,3-dioxan-2-one and its derivatives) support this conclusion.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1022-9760	1572-8935		WOS:000282701600001

Co or Ni embedded in the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were obtained by the heat treatment of Co- or Ni-ZIF-67. On Co or Ni embedded CNTs, Ni-deposition was performed to obtain the Ni-deposited catalysts, Ni- CNT-(Co or Ni), which have a higher surface area of 136.7 and 259 m(2)/g, respectively. These catalysts exhibit superior performance, low overpotential, and high stability for both oxygen reduction and evolu-tion reactions. The superior performance is attributed to metal deposition, which creates highly active catalytic sites and has potential application as a catalyst for the rechargeable zinc-air battery.

J	Nguyen Duc Hung; Garche, J.; Wiesener, K.								Contribution of the oxidation mechanism of free lead in lead accumulator paste during curing								Journal of Power Sources				17	4			331	44						May 1986	1986	The kinetics of lead oxidation during curing was studied by chemical analysis of the free lead content as well as by the gas volumetry of oxygen. The difference in the results in this research lies in the evolution of hydrogen as a curing reaction. This agrees with the results of curing the paste in ampoules without oxygen and with the oxidation of lead powder in an inert medium with high relative atmospheric humidity. The oxidation of lead during the curing is in close relationship with the drying of the paste, which is influenced by the relative atmospheric humidity and the temperature. The optimal water content of the paste for lead oxidation was determined. A model for the electrolyte film during curing has been developed, which allows the results to be interpreted satisfactorily.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0378-7753			INSPEC:2756212

An unexpected high ozone destruction rate was observed when O-2* was present in the system. The kinetic model developed for the oxygen nightglow on the terrestrial planets was adapted to interpret the detected temporal profiles of the ozone number density and the O-2* emission intensities. It was deduced that the vibrationally excited singlet delta oxygen molecule O-2(a(1)Delta, upsilon) formed in the secondary processes reacts efficiently with ozone in the process O-2(a(1)Delta, upsilon >= 3) + O-3 -> 2O(2) + O, and the rate constant of this process was estimated to be 3 x 10(-11) cm(3) s(-1). Ab initio calculations at the CASPT2(14, 12)/cc-pVTZ/U omega B97XD/cc-pVTZ level of theory were applied to find the reaction pathway from the reactants to products on the O-5 potential energy surface. These calculations revealed that the O-2(a(1) Delta) + O-3 reaction is likely to proceed via singlet-triplet intersystem crossing exhibiting an energy barrier of 9.6 kcal/mol, which lies between two and three quanta of vibrational excitation of O-2(a(1)Delta), and hence, O-2(a(1) Delta, upsilon) with upsilon >= 3 could rapidly react with ozone.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000715617200001	34717353

Although platinum (Pt) is the most efficient catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it has limitations for widespread applications due to its towering cost, scarcity and instability. Various catalysts such as precious/non-precious metal and metal-free catalysts have been developed for a viable HER process. Among them, ruthenium (Ru) based catalysts, which possess appropriate hydrogen bonding energy and reasonable price, have demonstrated strong potential as an alternative to Pt for the HER. In this review article, we summarize recently developed Ru-based electrocatalysts with superior HER performance, i.e., Ru on carbon supports, Ru phosphide based catalysts, and Ru coupled with transition metals. Finally, we discuss the challenges and perspectives of Ru-based catalysts in the HER research field.									122	6	0	0	6	0	122			2055-6756	2055-6764		WOS:000502785500004

Herein, we design and synthesize pyrite-type nickel/phosphorus co-doped CoS2 nanowires on carbon cloth (NiCoPS/CC) as efficient and durable electrodes for water electrolysis. Introduction of nickel and phosphorus produced stepwise and superb enhancement of the performance of the electrodes in the hydrogen evolution reaction due to regulation of the electronic structures of the active sites of the catalyst and accelerated charge transfer over a wide pH range (0-14). The NiCoPS/CC electrodes also delivered a nearly undecayed catalytic current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 230 mV for oxygen evolution due to in situ formation of surficial Ni-Co oxo/hydroxide in 1.0 M KOH. Thus, the NiCoPS/CC electrodes gave rise to a catalytic current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) for overall water splitting at potentials as low as 1.54 V during operation over 100 h in 1.0 M KOH with a Faradic efficiency of 100%.									54	6	0	0	0	0	55			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000395447600007

These conditions were disclosed in the literature more than 30 years ago and have found widespread use with little change. During studies focused on the synthesis of a drug candidate, we discovered the evolution of oxygen under the LiOH/H2O2 conditions for cleavage of an Evans auxiliary. We find this phenomenon to be general and tied to the fact that the initially formed peracid is not stable under the reaction conditions. The peracid is rapidly reduced by the excess H2O2 present in the reaction mixture, leading to the release of a stoichiometric amount of oxygen. This can present a significant risk for maintaining proper inertion in the presence of the flammable organic solvent, and we propose options for safely executing this chemistry at multikilogram scale.									9	0	0	0	3	0	9			1083-6160	1520-586X		WOS:000476956900011

Specifically, the atomic evolution during the phase transformation was monitored using high-resolution TEM images of individual nanocrystals. A two-step phase transformation was identified during the heating experiment: rapid oxidation of WZ CoO to SP Co3O4 and reduction of SP Co3O4 to RS CoO. In a low temperature range from 200 to 280 degrees C, the oxidation reaction, which was the first phase transformation from WZ CoO to SP Co3O4, occurred spontaneously via remnant oxygen in the TEM column. On the other hand, the reduction reaction, which was the second phase transformation from SP Co3O4 to RS CoO at high temperatures of over 280 degrees C, occurred under a low oxygen partial pressure. The phase transformation phenomena were analyzed from thermodynamical and microstructural viewpoints.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000466053600060

In this work, a carbon supported dicobalt phosphide (Co2P) nanosheet (Co2P/C) electrocatalyst is prepared using a simple and low cost supramolecular gel assisted strategy. The nanomaterial obtained with a nanosheet morphology presents excellent electrocatalytic performance for ORR with comparable onset- and half-wave potential to a platinum/carbon (Pt/C) catalyst, indicating the significant role of Co2P for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance for ORR in an alkaline medium. Furthermore, the obtained catalyst exhibits outstanding long-term durability, methanol tolerance and a four electron pathway for ORR.

In an acid medium which is predominantly HClO4 the kinetics are diffusion controlled and first order with respect to both [Ce(IV)] and [RuO2] and exhibit an activation energy of 19 kJ mol-1. In 0.5 mol dm-3 H2SO4 the kinetics are much slower and complex, the rate decreasing with increasing [Ce(III)]. The kinetics of catalysis observed in all the different acid media studied are readily interpreted using an electrochemical model in which the catalyst particles are considered as acting as microelectrodes which mediate electron transfer between a Nernstian reduction reaction (Ce(IV) --> Ce(III)) and an irreversible oxidation reaction (H2O --> 2H+ + 1/2O2). This electrochemical model is used to analyse the complex kinetics observed in 0.5 mol dm-3 H2SO4 and extract mechanistic information concerning the nature of the rate determining step.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0020-1693			WOS:A1991HA39300008

We disclose here for the first time gravimetric evidence with the EQCM of the different mechanistic models that apply to the ORR in LiPF6/DMSO electrolyte: (i) Surface electrochemical/chemical deposition of Li2O2(s) and (ii) solution phase disproportion of LiO2(soln) yields large Li2O2 particles. The mass per electron detected with the EQCM depends on the respective current rates and thus on the mechanisms, i.e. 23 g/F for the formation of Li2O2 thin film at high current density and much larger values for low current density due to solvent co-deposition and further degradation.

This is possible owing to the strong chelating ability of the biopolymer dextran, whose morphological complexity effectively cocoons the reaction, preventing oxygen ingress. This synthetic protocol demonstrates that not only can this important material be synthesized as nanoparticles but that, as the morphological template is calcined, it effectively carbon-dopes the superconducting phase, thereby improving the critical current density by a factor of five.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0361-5235			WOS:000282789800022

In this regard, structure-activity relationships based on several descriptors have already been proposed to rationally design electrocatalysts. However, the dynamic reconstruction of the surface structures and compositions of catalysts during electrocatalytic water oxidation, especially during the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), complicate the streamlined prediction of the catalytic activity. With the achievements in operando and in situ techniques, it has been found that electrocatalysts undergo surface reconstruction to form the actual active species in situ accompanied with an increase in their oxidation state during OER in alkaline solution. Accordingly, a thorough understanding of the surface reconstruction process plays a critical role in establishing unambiguous structure-composition-property relationships in pursuit of high-efficiency electrocatalysts. However, several issues still need to be explored before high electrocatalytic activities can be realized, as follows: (1) the identification of initiators and pathways for surface reconstruction, (2) establishing the relationships between structure, composition, and electrocatalytic activity, and (3) the rational manipulation of in situ catalyst surface reconstruction. In this review, the recent progress in the surface reconstruction of transition metal-based OER catalysts including oxides, non-oxides, hydroxides and alloys is summarized, emphasizing the fundamental understanding of reconstruction behavior from the original precatalysts to the actual catalysts based on operando analysis and theoretical calculations. The state-of-the-art strategies to tailor the surface reconstruction such as substituting/doping with metals, introducing anions, incorporating oxygen vacancies, tuning morphologies and exploiting plasmonic/thermal/photothermal effects are then introduced. Notably, comprehensive operando/in situ characterization together with computational calculations are responsible for unveiling the improvement mechanism for OER. By delivering the progress, strategies, insights, techniques, and perspectives, this review will provide a comprehensive understanding of the surface reconstruction in transition metal-based OER catalysts and future guidelines for their rational development.									118	0	0	0	6	0	118			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000672940500001	34259239

Quantum mechanical simulations have been extensively employed to study the catalytic mechanisms. These calculations typically assume that the catalyst is charge neutral for computational simplicity; however, in reality, the catalyst is usually charged to match its Fermi level with the applied electrode potential. These contradictions urge an evaluation of the charge effects. Here, using the example of hydrogen adsorption on the common 2D electrocatalysts (N-doped graphene and MoS2) and 3D metal catalysts, and employing the grand canonical density functional theory, we show that the charge on 2D materials can have a much stronger impact on the electrochemical reaction than the charge on 3D metals (the reaction energy can differ by >1 eV after including the charge effects). This arises from the charge-induced change in the occupation of electronic states, which is more significant for 2D materials due to their limited density of states. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of the charge effects in 2D materials, calls for re-evaluation of the previously suggested mechanisms by including the overlooked charge effects, and offers practical guidelines for designing 2D catalysts.									102	1	0	0	2	0	102			0002-7863			WOS:000440515200024	29956544

Then, the heat generated by the oxidation promotes further oxidation, resulting in ignition. In order to prevent this phenomenon, it is necessary to understand the initial stage of oxidation of coal in the condition of heat-accumulation. Conventionally, there are very few researches to understand the early stage of coal oxidation. In this study, we aimed at to elucidate the earlier oxidation stage of coals by employing low temperature oxidation of a mass of coals and several instrumental analysis techniques. The oxidation we used were heating 50 g of coal charged in a stainless steel closed container at 80 degrees C for 24 h by flowing hot air to simulate the self-exothermic reaction condition. XRD and Raman spectroscopic measurements showed that the carbon skeleton structure of coal did not change by the oxidation treatment, while FTIR, H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR measurements showed a decrease in aliphatic side chains and an increase in hydroxyl groups in coal. The information obtained here will help to understand the whole process of self-exothermic reaction of coal to prevent burning.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0021-1575	1883-2954		WOS:000441485100001

Herein, we report on a single-atom ruthenium doped monolayered TiO2 nanosheet catalyst (Ru-1/TiNS). Unlike pure TiO2 with no VLD-HER activity, Ru-1/TiNS enables efficient H-2 evolution with a mmol h(-1) g(-1) magnitude (4.81) under visible light, comparable to 8.95 mmol h(-1) g(-1) under full light spectrum. Various ex-/in-situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the single-atom Ru-1 introduces an impurity energy level, allowing light absorption up to 700 nm, and an oxygen vacancy around Ru t tends to be a charge trapping site, promoting rapid photogenerated electron separation and transportation. This study provides a promising catalyst-design strategy for high-efficiency hydrogen production using solar energy.									18	2	0	0	1	0	19			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000532681500024

Their electrochemical properties were systematically investigated for supercapacitors and energy-saving H-2 production. As an electrode material for supercapacitor, CMM demonstrates a specific capacitance of 2320F g(-1) at 1 A/g, and maintains a specific capacitance of 1216F g(-1) at 10 A/g. It also shows 72.8 % capacitance retention after 8000 cycles. The aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited high energy storage capacity (887.86F g(-1) specific capacitance at a current density of 1 A/g), good rate performance and cycling stability. Besides, CMM shows outstanding urea oxidation reaction(UOR) and glycol oxidation reaction (MOR) performances for H-2 production. Compared to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (1.635 V) at 20 mA cm(-2), the potentials were reduced by 213 mV for UOR and 233 mV for MOR, respectively. Therefore, this study shows the promising practical applications of CMM nanocomposites for energy storage and energy-saving H-2 production. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

This current report summarizes the latest advances in N-doped carbon electrocatalysts prepared by N mono-doping and co-doping with other heteroatoms.

The as-prepared electrocatalysts show an ultrathin rose petal-like carbon sheets structure loaded with micro and nano-sized Ni particles. The electrocatalytic activity of Ni loaded carbon sheets electrocatalysts are studied in 1 M KOH solution. Ni-GCS-2 shows overpotential of 0.205 V (vs RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with better stability for 4 h continuously and lower R-ct. Ni-GCS-2 shows only 15% loss for HER after 4 h. The effect of Ni on electrocatalytic performance was investigated. The Ni Nano particles are the active sites for the reaction and graphene-like carbon sheets facilitate electron transport due to their conductive nature. This study showed that Ni-GCS-2 is better in performance as compared to other as prepared electrocatalyst and previously studied Ni-based electrocatalysts.									19	2	0	0	0	0	19			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000466617800014

The microstructure results show that the prepared NP-PdCe alloy consists of nanocubes with an average size of 200 nm, exhibiting a three-dimensional nanoporous structure with a pore size of around 5 nm. Owing to the combined effect of bimetallic synergistic action and the nanoporous structure, the NP-PdCe catalyst exhibits much higher electrocatalytic activity and durability towards ethanol electro-oxidation and the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline solution, relative to nanoporous Pd and commercial Pd/C catalysts. With the advantages of scalable preparation and enhanced catalytic performance, the NP-PdCe nanocubes hold great potential for application as a promising catalyst in direct ethanol fuel cells.									25	1	0	0	0	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451813300036

Herein, a porous bimetallic selenide (NiFeSe) nanocube deposited on carbon fiber paper (NiFeSe/CFP) was synthesized through a facile selenization reaction based on Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) as precursors. The NiFeSe/CFP exhibited excellent HER activity with an overpotential of just 186 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH at ambient temperature, similar to most of the state-of-the-art transition metal chalcogenides. The corresponding Tafel slope was calculated to be 52 mV dec(-1), indicating fast discharge of the proton during the HER. Furthermore, the catalyst could endure long-term catalytic tests and showed remarkable durability. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance of NiFeSe/CFP is attributed to the unique 3D porous configuration inherited from the PBA templates, enhanced charge transfer occurring at the heterogeneous interface due to the synergistic effect between the bimetallic phases, and the high conductivity improved by the formation of amorphous carbon shells during the selenization. These findings prove that the combination of inexpensive metal-organic framework precursors and hybrid metallic compounds is a feasible way to realize the performance enhancement of non-noble-metal-based chalcogenides towards alkaline HER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000831614300001

Herein, for the first time, a novel three-dimensional (3D) hollow hybrid electrocatalyst, Co-Fe-P nanoframe immobilized on N,P-doped carbon nanotubes (CoFeP NFs/NPCNT), was synthesized by selectively etching a CNT-composited Co,Fe-based Prussian blue analogue and subsequent phosphorization. Benefiting from its unique 3D hollow nanoarchitecture, which offers rich porosity and abundant catalytically active sites and guarantees excellent conductivity and structural stability, the hollow CoFeP NFs/NPCNT hybrid delivered pronounced catalytic activity for oxygen evolution (or hydrogen evolution) in alkaline electrolyte, with a low overpotential of 278 (or 132) mV at 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 39.5 (or 62.9) mV dec(-1) and prominent long-term stability. Therefore, when CoFeP NFs/NPCNT was employed as the cathode and anode toward overall water-splitting, it required a quite small cell voltage of only 1.56 V to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and displayed outstanding electrocatalytic stability over 60 h, greatly approaching the performance of the commercial Pt/C (-)//RuO2(+) electrolyzer and outperforming most other non-noble-based electrolyzers.									58	2	0	0	2	0	58			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000496763600034	31503267

Based on previous reports on the deposition of oxides or hydroxides of the closely related element cerium, this work demonstrates that samarium films are formed following a similar mechanism, which involves as the fundamental step an increase in interfacial pH resulting from cathodic oxygen-reduction or hydrogen-evolution reactions. With cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical quartz-crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements, rotating-disk electrode (RDE) tests, and surface characterization techniques, namely, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray surface microanalysis (EDX), the postulated mechanism was verified, and the surface morphology of the resulting films was correlated with the nature of the reduction reaction that triggers film formation.

Investigations of complete reconstruction in energy conversion recently receive intensive attention, which promote the targeted design of top-performance materials with maximum component utilization and good stability. However, the advantages of complete reconstruction, its design strategies, and extensive applications have not achieved the profound understandings and summaries it deserves. Here, this review systematically summarizes several important advances in complete reconstruction for the first time, which includes 1) fundamental understandings of complete reconstruction, the characteristics and advantages of completely reconstructed catalysts, and their design principles, 2) types of reconstruction-involved precatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction catalysis in wide pH solution, and origins of limited reconstruction degree as well as design strategies/principles toward complete reconstruction, 3) complete reconstruction for novel material synthesis and other electrocatalysis fields, and 4) advanced in situ/operando or multiangle/level characterization techniques to capture the dynamic reconstruction processes and real catalytic contributors. Finally, the existing major challenges and unexplored/unsolved issues on studying the reconstruction chemistry are summarized, and an outlook for the further development of complete reconstruction is briefly proposed. This review will arouse the attention on complete reconstruction materials and their applications in diverse fields.									78	3	0	0	5	0	77			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000655840000001	34050565

CuFeO2 can absorb solar light and promote the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), even though the photocurrents achieved so far are still well below the theoretical upper limit. While several experimental and theoretical works have provided a detailed characterization of the bulk properties of this material, surfaces have been largely unexplored. In this work, we perform first-principles simulations based on DFT to investigate the structure, electronic properties, and thermodynamic stability of CuFeO2 surfaces both in vacuum and in an electrochemical environment. To estimate the alignment of the band edges on the electrochemical scale, we perform ab initio molecular dynamics in explicit water, unraveling the structure of the solid/liquid interface for various surface terminations. We consider the system both in the dark and under illumination, showing that light absorption can induce partial reduction of the surface, giving rise to states in the gap that can pin the Fermi level, in agreement with recent measurements. Using the free energy of adsorption of atomic hydrogen as a descriptor of the catalytic activity for the HER, we show that hydride species formed at oxygen vacancies can be highly active and could therefore be an intermediate of reaction.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000621598700001

Results of the pliminary examination (IR and XRD) specify the formation of almost pure spinel phase of the oxide. All the electrochemical charactrization such as cyclic voltammogram (CV), anodic polarization curve for the determination of electrocatalytic activity and thermodynamic parameters were done in three electrode single compartment glass cell. The study revels that nature of CV curve for each oxide electrode was same and exhibited a pair of redox peaks, one anodic (E-Pa = 509 +/- 22 mV) and a corresponding cathodic peak (E-Pc = 351 +/- 6 mV) prior to OER. The substitution of Ni in the Fe3O4 matrix increases the electrocatalytic activity and at E = 850 mV, it is similar to 7 times higher with Ni1.5Fe1.5O4 (j = 158.0 mAcm(-2)) than that of base oxide. For thermodynamic parameters, anodic polarization curve was recorded in 1M KOH at different temperatures. The standard electrochemical enthalpy of activation (Delta H-el degrees(#)) was found to be minimum with Ni1.5Fe1.5O4. The standard enthalpy of activation (Delta H degrees(#)) and standard entropy of activation (Delta S degrees(#)) have also been calculated with the help of polarization curve recorded at different temperatures.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1480-2422	2292-1168		WOS:000571433600004

In this paper, we prepared three-dimensional (3D) porous NiCo2O4 dodecahedron nanosheets (NCO) from a metaleorganic framework template (ZIF-67) and incorporated them with two-dimensional (2D) multilayer graphene nanosheets (GNS) through a simple and rapid ultrasonication process. The combination of these 3D/2D nanostructures created effective interfaces between the NCO and GNS components that enhanced the intrinsic electronic properties and increased the number of active catalytic sites on the NCO@GNS surfaces. Accordingly, the NCO@GNS electrocatalyst displayed superior kinetics for both the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes and could be fabricated into an air-cathode for Li-O-2 battery applications. The NCO@GNS air-cathode delivered a specific storage capacity (7201 mA h g(-1)) higher than those of the NCO and commercial carbon black electrodes. We tested the durability of the Li-O-2 battery featuring the NCO@GNS cathode in a new PAT-cell configuration; it exhibited long-term cyclability for 200 cycles with a limited capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). This cathode design featuring meso- and micropores shortened the pathways for Li+ ion diffusion and ensured rapid electron and oxygen transfer, thereby increasing the lifetime of its corresponding Li-O-2 battery.

Here, a simple and robust preparation method of three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured catalysts made of abundant metals is presented. The 3D hydrangea-like microspheres made of nickel-vanadium double hydroxide nanosheets are first prepared on the Ni-Co foam (NCF) followed by the hydroxides exchange with (MoS4)(2-) ions to form Chevrel-phase Ni-V-Mo sulfide. Benefiting from the 3D holey nanostructures with a large surface area, low adsorption free energy values, and fast electronic transport, the overpotentials of the optimized Ni8V2(Mo3S4)(11)/NCE catalyst for HER and OER at a current density 10 mA cm(-2) are as low as 129 and 330 mV, respectively. The amounts of H-2 and O-2 generated at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) are about 517 and 342 mu mol h(-1), which is very competitive with most advanced research results reported for non-noble-metal electrodes in alkaline medium. The Chevrel-phase chalcogenide also features excellent long-term stability under prolonged HER and OER cycling conditions. Our results suggest that Chevrel-phase materials are promising as low-cost and efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in alkaline electrolytes.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			2168-0485			WOS:000455288800171

A commonly known, but hitherto barely analyzed issue in this kind of modeling is the presence of sizable errors from the use of approximate Density Functional Theory (DFT). We here address the propagation of these errors to the catalytic turnover frequency (TOF) by global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Both analyses require the numerical quadrature of high-dimensional integrals. To achieve this efficiently, we utilize and extend an adaptive sparse grid approach and exploit the confinement of the strongly non-linear behavior of the TOF to local regions of the parameter space. We demonstrate the methodology on a model of the oxygen evolution reaction at the Co3O4 (110)-A surface, using a maximum entropy error model that imposes nothing but reasonable bounds on the errors. For this setting, the DFT errors lead to an absolute uncertainty of several orders of magnitude in the TOF. We nevertheless find that it is still possible to draw conclusions from such uncertain models about the atomistic aspects controlling the reactivity. A comparison with derivative-based local sensitivity analysis instead reveals that this more established approach provides incomplete information. Since the adaptive sparse grids allow for the evaluation of the integrals with only a modest number of function evaluations, this approach opens the way for a global sensitivity analysis of more complex models, for instance, models based on kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.

The Cu(II)TFP exhibits catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The analysis of linear sweep voltammograms shows that the HER reaction of Cu(II)TFP with benzoic acid is firstorder in proton concentration with an average apparent rate constant for HER catalysis of k(app) = 5.79 +/- 0.47 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2470-1343			WOS:000783601100076	35309414

The high-frequency region of the spectrum was monitored to determine the time evolution of the spin, oxidation, and coordination states of heme O and the oxidation state of heme B by using newly established marker lines for each heme. Three phases of the reaction were detected. In phase I, complete in 75 mu s, O-2 reacted with heme O and formed a low-spin ferric or ferryl adduct without significant oxidation of heme B. In phase II, between 75 and 120 mu s, a small fraction of heme B was oxidized. In phase III, at similar to 1 s, the majority of heme B was oxidized and heme O reverted to a high-spin ferric state. The high rate of oxygen reduction at heme O to the three- or four-electron reduced level, despite a very low rate of heme B oxidation, indicates that there are electron donors active in the enzyme other than the metal centers. Assays of our enzyme preparations rule out a quinol in the tight binding (Q(H)) Site as a possible donor but instead suggest electron donation from the protein matrix, such as from tryptophans or tyrosines. Three Tryptophans (W280, W282, and W331) and one tyrosine (Y288) are postulated as candidates for such a role, and their location near the binuclear center suggests that the donor electrons follow a pathway directly to the heme O-Cu-B binuclear center without passing through heme B. The donors that participate in the catalytic mechanism in vitro may also play a functional role under physiological conditions.									23	0	0	0	19	0	23			0006-2960			WOS:A1995TG97300016	7492552

A key task in studying heterogeneous reduction/oxidation reactions and developing CLC technology is to measure the heterogeneous redox kinetics of oxygen carrier particles in fluidizing state. Here we compared two methods to measure heterogeneous redox kinetics of fluidizing oxygen carrier particles by both the solid mass signal measured from the weight balance and the gas evolution signal measured by mass spectroscopy. Microfluidized bed thermogravimetry combined with the mass spectrometry method (MFB-TG-MS) was used here to measure the tail gas signal, and heterogeneous redox kinetics was obtained from the analysis of the tail gas signal. The oxidation by air and reduction by H-2 of a manganese oxide were chosen to be the target reactions. The heterogeneous redox kinetics of manganese oxide obtained from the analysis of the tail gas signal measured by mass spectroscopy was compared with the previously developed MFB-TGA method in which the real-time solid mass signal of fluidizing oxygen carrier was measured by weight balance. A K-L two-phase fluidized bed model, developed by Kunni and Levenspiel to describe the mass transfer and reaction behavior in a bubbling fluidized bed, was used to analyze the experimental data from MFB-TG-MS. It was found that there is no big difference for the reduction kinetics of manganese oxide measured by the two signals. Mass balance was achieved for the gas signal method, and the outlet mole fraction of H-2 is consistent with the model result, while for the fast heterogeneous oxidation reaction, the deconvolution of the gas signal is needed. It was found that the oxidation conversion calculated by the deconvoluted gas signal was close to the previous results measured by the weight balance method, while the estimation of the initial oxidation rate from the gas signal was not so accurate. For studying many redox cycles of oxygen carrier, it is more suitable to obtain the heterogeneous kinetics from the solid mass signal measured by the weight balance method. We anticipate that this new MFB-TG-MS method can be readily applied to measure fast heterogeneous redox kinetics of fluidizing oxygen carrier and provide a more comprehensive understanding for heterogeneous reactions occurring inside the fluidized bed reactor.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000574904900066

In this work, we propose a self-sacrifice template method combined with in-situ composite technique to fabricate a novel configuration of CeO2 quantum dots embedded in hierarchical porous foliaceous N-doped carbon with both mesopores and micropores. The prepared catalyst exhibits prominent ORR electrocatalytic performance with higher half-wave potential, lower Tafel slope, and enhanced durability comparing with the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, the Zn-air and Al-air batteries employing the prepared electrocatalysts in cathodes exhibit superior discharge performance with high open circuit voltages of 1.51 V and 1.76 V, and peak power densities of 204 and 458 mW cm(-2), respectively, compared to most reported metal-air batteries. The greatly enhanced electrocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the abundant oxygen vacancies, improved redox property of Ce3+/Ce4+ as well as the three-dimensional hierarchical porous structure. This work provides a valuable chance to develop scalable quantum dot level composite catalysts in metal-air batteries. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The results suggested that as-prepared Co3O4-CoFe2O4, Co3O4-CoFe2O4@SiO(2 )and Co3O4-CoFe2O4@SiO2@Au are excellent catalysts for the water oxidation reaction, while Co3O4-CoFe2O4@SiO2@Au shows the best catalytic activity, and an O-2 yield of 71.24% can be obtained. To gain insights into the relationship between the structural details and functional behaviors, the as-prepared catalysts were characterized using various analytical tools, respectively. SEM and TEM analyses showed that the average size of the nanoparticles was about 500 nm for the three catalysts and the surface of the Co3O4-CoFe2O4 catalyst was covered by a floc layer of SiO2. XRD and EDS studies confirmed that Au nanoparticles were present in Co3O4-CoFe2O4@SiO2 nanocomposites. From the above experimental results, we concluded that the reason why Co3O4-CoFe2O4@SiO2@Au shows superior performance over the other two catalysts Co3O4-CoFe2O4 and Co3O4-CoFe2O4@SiO2 may be due to: (1) the large refractive index and low dielectric constant of SiO2 (epsilon = 1.56); (2) Au metal nanoparticles can effectively harvest a wide range of sunlight containing UV light and visible light because of its plasmonic effect. Our research showed that Co3O4-CoFe2O4@SiO2@Au can be used as an efficient catalyst for water oxidation under visible light irradiation.									11	2	0	0	2	0	12			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000445219300100

In this work, we utilize cationic anionic passivated codoping to explore the potential of the g-ZnO nanosheet for the design of efficient water redox photocatalysts by employing density functional theory calculations with the hybrid HSE06 functional. Our calculations show that anion cation passivated codoped systems not only are more favorable than the corresponding monodoping in the g-ZnO nanosheet due to the Coulomb interactions but also effectively reduce the band gap without introducing unoccupied states which accelerate the electron hole recombination. The charge-compensated P-Sc and C-Zr codoped g-ZnO nanosheets are energetically favorable for hydrogen evolution but not insufficient to produce oxygen, indicating that they could serve as Z-scheme photocatalysts. The C-Ti, N-Y, and P-Y codoped systems may be potential potocatalysts for photoelectrochemical water splitting to generate hydrogen due to their appropriate band gaps and band edge positions. In particular, the charge-compensated P-Y codoped g-ZnO nanosheet has the most excellent stability and the largest absorption region of visible light among these codoped systems. Further, we show that P-Y passivated codoping can reduce the overpotentials for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of the g-ZnO nanosheet, indicating that the OER or HER on the P-Y codoped g-ZnO nanosheet can be easier driven by the irradiation-generated holes or electrons.									27	1	0	0	2	0	28			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000409395700024

Herein, we demonstrate an effective couple of MnO and Co nanocrystals embedded in N-doped graphite carbon to integrate a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst (denoted as MnO/Co@ NGC) toward oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER). MnO/Co@NGC was first successfully prepared by the one-step pyrolysis of Mn3[Co(CN)(6)](2)center dot 9H(2)O@PVP (poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)), and X-ray absorption near-edge structure analysis revealed that the charges were transferred from MnO to Co@NGC, which makes MnO more electrophilic to facilitate the initial electrochemical adsorption of OH- for improving the OER activity. As expected, the as-designed MnO/Co@NGC displays excellent bifunctional ORR/OER activity with a small overpotential gap of only 0.736 V, providing the ZABs with a high trip efficiency of 57.2% as well as excellent cycling stability. This work not only offers a bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalyst but also further highlights the interfacial charge distribution in oxygen electrocatalysis, affording a promising approach for developing advanced energy-related materials.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000675430900030	34219458	
J	Biehler, K; Fock, H								Evidence for the contribution of the Mehler-peroxidase reaction in dissipating excess electrons in drought-stressed wheat								PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				112	1			265	272		10.1104/pp.112.1.265				SEP 1996	1996	Gross O-2 evolution and uptake by attached, drought-stressed leaves of wheat (Triticum aestivum) were measured using a O-16(2)/O-18(2) isotope technique and mass spectrometry. The activity of photosystem II, determined from the rate of O-16(2) evolution, is only slightly affected under drought conditions. During drought stress, net CO2 uptake decreases due to stomatal closure, whereas the uptake of O-18(2) is stimulated. The main O-2-consuming reactions in the light are the Mehler-peroxidase (MP) reaction and the photorespiratory pathway. From measurements of the rate of carbon flux through the photorespiratory pathway, estimated by the analysis of the specific radioactivities of glycolate, we conclude that the rate of photorespiration is decreased with drought stress. Therefore, the O-2 taken up in the light appears to be preferentially used by the MP reaction. In stressed leaves, 29.1% of the photosynthetic electrons are consumed in the MP reaction and 18.4% drive the photorespiratory pathway. Thus, overreduction of the electron transport chain is avoided preferably by the MP reaction when drought stress restricts CO2 reduction.									199	22	1	0	199	0	225			0032-0889			WOS:A1996VJ09300031	12226390

Herein, the structural, electronic, and optical properties of three Janus Pd-based TMD monolayers (PdSSe, PdSTe, and PdSeTe) are investigated through comprehensive density functional theory calculations. The most stable ground-state configurations of these Janus TMD monolayers correspond to the unique pentagonal configuration instead of the common 1T or 2H phases. The monolayers are semiconductors with moderate bandgaps (2.06-2.21 eV) and anisotropic optical absorption properties. By exhibiting suitable band edge positions with respect to the redox potentials of water, they can simultaneously facilitate the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions as water-splitting photocatalysts. In addition, the effects of uniaxial and biaxial strains on the optoelectronic properties of the monolayers are investigated, and it is determined that the application of strain reduces their bandgaps and causes a redshift of their optical absorption spectra, thereby allowing them to harvest ultraviolet and visible photons more effectively. An insight on the intrinsic properties of 2D Pd-based Janus TMDs is provided, which elucidates the rational design of photocatalysts for water splitting.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1862-6254	1862-6270		WOS:000703584000001

As a solid-liquid mixed fuel, its combustion is a complex multi-stage process coupling of solid boron and liquid JP-10 combustion affected by various factors. In this study, A CO2 laser ignition test system was used to obtain the combustion characteristics of boron suspension fuel with solid loading of 10 wt.% in O-2 /Ar atmosphere. Focus is placed on the key factor of oxygen supply on the evolution of its solid-liquid coupling combustion characteristics. Theoretical analysis of the underlying mechanism of oxygen transportation and consumption caused by boron and JP-10 and their coupling characteristics was carried out for different stages. The results indicate that the combustion process could be divided into ignition, evaporation combustion, agglomerate combustion and extinguishment under full oxygen supply. In ignition stage, boron particles first ignite and promote the rapid ignition of JP-10. Oxygen supply can transfer boron combustion from heterogeneous reaction into homogeneous combustion. In evaporation combustion stage, a clear competition for oxygen between JP-10 and boron is observed. JP-10 is the main oxygen consumer whose flame forms an oxygen-lean zone around the droplet and suppresses boron combustion within the area. Micro-explosion could help carry boron particles into the outer oxygen-rich zone and achieve single-particle combustion. Increasing oxygen content to 60% can effectively compress the oxygen-lean zone area and realize simultaneous combustion of boron and JP-10. Agglomerate combustion stages could only occur when oxygen content is higher than 80%, which is the main energy releasing stage of boron. In extinguishment stage, black smoke is observed due to incomplete combustion of JP-10 when oxygen content is less than 60% while white smoke is observed due to boron oxide cooling deposition. This study provides a reference for the full energy exploitation of boron suspension fuel. (C) 2021 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the case of acidic polymer electrolytes, the electrodes are typically made of composites of carbon-supported catalyst and Nafion polymer electrolyte binder. In this study, the interaction of the proton conduction, the electron conduction, and the electrochemical hydrogen conversion in such composite electrode materials was examined. Exposed to a hydrogen atmosphere, these composites displayed up to 10-fold smaller resistivities for the proton conduction than that of Nafion membranes. This effect was ascribed to the simultaneously occurring electrochemical hydrogen oxidation and evolution inside the composite samples, which are driven by different proton and electron resistivities. The parasitic electrochemical currents resulting were postulated to occur in the anode of fuel cells with polymer, solid oxide, or liquid alkaline electrolytes, when the ohmic drop of the ion conduction in the anode is higher with the anodic kinetic overvoltage (as illustrated in the graphical abstract). In this case, the parasitic electrochemical currents increase the anodic kinetic overpotential and the ohmic drop in the anode. Thinner fuel cell anodes with smaller ohmic drops for the ion conduction may reduce the parasitic electrochemical currents.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244			WOS:000358897200009	26154401

The calculated results show that the oxygen molecule is dissociative on the neutral Tin clusters. Geometrically, the two O atoms are distributed at the two sides across the neutral Tin cluster for n = 1-4 and the oxygen atomfavors the three-fold hollow site for n = 5, 6, and 7. The binding energy per atom (E-b) and energy gap (E-gap) show higher stability and lower chemical activity of the neutral TinO2 (n = 1-7) systems compared with the corresponding Ti-n clusters. The adsorption energies (E-ad) exhibit a continuously ascending tendency except for n = 4. The results of the addition of different charges (-2, -1, +1, and +2) on the most stable neutral TinO2 (n = 1-7) systems indicate that their geometries are usually perturbed. The stabilities of the neutral TinO2 systems are enhanced by adding one negative charge.

Herein we report the development of a novel two-step heating route to produce metal-free N-doped carbon blacks.

Among the various heating temperatures tested, sequential two-step heating at 750 and 1000 degrees C produced the most efficient catalysts with onset and half-wave potentials of 0.97 and 0.82 V, respectively. The prepared materials show excellent selectivity for 4-electron transfer, durability, and stability in response to methanol poisoning.

Atomistic modeling of IrO2 is critical for understanding the structure, chemistry, and nanoscale dynamics of IrO2 in these applications. Such modeling has remained elusive due to the lack of an empirical force field (EFF) for IrO2. We introduce a first-principles-based EFF that couples the Morse (MS) potential with a variable charge equilibration method, QEq. The EFF parameters are optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA) on a density functional theory (DFT)-based training set. The resultant Morse plus QEq EFF, "MS-Q" in short, successfully reproduces the lattice parameters, elastic constants, binding energies, and internal coordinates of various polymorphs of IrO2 from DFT calculations. More importantly, MS-Q accurately captures key metrics for evaluating structural and chemical properties of catalysts such as surface energetics, equilibrium shape, electrostatic charges, oxygen vacancy formation energies, relative stability of low index rutile IrO2 surfaces, and pressure-induced phase transformations. The MS-Q EFF is used to predict the oxygen binding energy (E-ad), a well-known descriptor for OER activity, on various sites of a nanocatalyst. We find E-ad to be more favorable at low coordination sites, i.e. edges and corners, compared to planar facets; E-ad is also correlated with charge transfer between the adsorbed O and nanocrystal, highlighting the importance of variable charge electrostatics in modeling catalysis on metal oxide surfaces. Our variable charge force field offers encouraging prospects for carrying out large-scale reactive simulations to evaluate catalytic performance of IrO2 surfaces and nanostructures.									51	2	0	0	5	0	52			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000361553100022

The etch rate and the anisotropy evolutions are reported as a function of ion energy, oxygen pressure and substrate temperature, which are important parameters likely to affect anisotropy. A transition from isotropic to imperfect anisotropic etching occurs when the ion energy is increased. However, residual lateral etching always subsists at room temperature, even at the lowest oxygen concentrations. Above room temperature, in contrast with ion-induced etching, the spontaneous lateral etch rate increases with temperature, suggesting a thermally activated reaction process. The phenomena are interpreted in terms of oxygen coverage on the polymer surface, with a threshold coverage being required for purely spontaneous chemical etching to occur, and on the assumption of a photon-induced desorption of volatile products proportional to the oxygen coverage.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0021-4922			WOS:A1995RK73000058

Here, a unique, nanofunctional three-dimensional (3D) substrate-catalyst hybrid assembly with mutually related high conductivity, improved electronic structure, flexibility, and redox behavior, and a plethora of surface-active sites is developed, resulting in remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity from a simple and single catalytic platform. The hybrid and synergistic combination of controlled electrodeposited CoNPs on 3D Au-nano substrates reveals unprecedented water-splitting activity with very promising kinetics and sustained stability for a prolonged period. The engineered CoNPs/Au-nano hybrid assembly exceedingly surpasses the activity of CoNPs on other substrates, Co3O4 NPs and IrO2. The onset potential for water oxidation is E/V = 1.43 V-RHE (eta = 200 mV), which is extremely low and comparable to that of IrO2. With a low Tafel slope of just 52 mV dec(-1), the CoNPs/Aunano hybrid assembly presents remarkable stability for 180 continuous hours of electrolysis. The noteworthy enhancement in overall activity is ascribed to the unique nanoscale-level collaborations in the CoNPs/Aunano hybrid assembly, demonstrating enhanced electronic transport for overall water splitting. CoNPs/Aunano also exhibit remarkable HER activity and full water-splitting performance in the two-electrode system. No obvious change in the catalyst structure and morphological attributes are observed during characterization studies after OER.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2574-0962			WOS:000703338600030

Herein, amorphous/crystalline hybrid iron disulfide obtained by self-reconstruction is developed for the first time for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The amorphous/crystalline hybrid FeS2 catalyst exhibited a high OER activity with an overpotential of only 189.5 mV (IR-corrected) to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, which was superior to that of the commercial RuO2. Notably, in the two-electrode system with the amorphous/crystalline hybrid FeS2 as the anode electrocatalyst and Pt/C as the cathode, the catalytic activity towards the overall water splitting was enhanced with a voltage of only 1.43 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The phase, composition and surface structure were changed greatly before and after the reaction. All these surface reconstructions after the OER reaction may play significant roles in the high electronic catalytic efficiency. Therefore, the study of the surface reconstruction of catalysts during the reaction process is very important for the structure-performance relationship and the design of efficient hybrid electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000642232400001	33885125

However, breaking the triple bond in the nitrogen molecule is one of the most essential challenges in chemistry. In this work, we use density functional theory simulations to investigate the plausible reaction mechanisms of electrocatalytic NOR and its competition with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the atomic scale. We focus on the electrochemical conversion of inert N2 to active *NO during NOR. We propose formation of *N2O from *N2 and *O as the rate-determining step (RDS). Following the RDS, a microkinetic model is utilized to study the rate of NOR on metal oxides. Our results demonstrate that a lower activation energy is obtained when a catalyst binds *O weakly. We show that the reaction is extremely challenging but also that design strategies have been suggested to promote electrochemical NOR.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1948-7185			WOS:000858530400001	36130288

One challenge in this field is implementing a bifunctional catalyst to catalyze hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction using methods compatible with microfabrication techniques. Herein, the scalable synthesis, micropatterning, and performance of a nickel nitride (Ni3N/Ni) bifunctional catalyst are demonstrated. Microfabrication is used to pattern Ni microelectrodes, and nitridation and N-H grafting of the electrodes-which also act as the catalysts-are achieved by ammonia plasma. These electrodes are incorporated into the mu AME device, and the electrolyte flow rate is optimized to maximize gas product separation. The mu AME is operated in a two-electrode configuration exhibiting a current density of 263.73 mA cm(-2) at 2.5 V and a stable 6 h operation for overall water splitting. The mu AME performance efficiency is 99.86%, with a current density of 150 mA cm(-2). Gas chromatography of the electrolysis products revealed no gas cross-over across the electrodes. Volumetric collection efficiencies of 97.72% for H-2 and 96.14% for O-2 are obtained. The performance of the mu AME is comparable to a membrane-based electrolyzer operating under stringent conditions of high temperature (60-80 degrees C) and extreme electrolyte pH (30-40 wt % KOH).									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2574-0962			WOS:000703338600099

In this composite material, tungsten oxide particles with the size about 5-8 nm disperse evenly in the framework of nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon matrix. WO3-x@NC exhibits striking catalytic activity for reductive conversion of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol with the existence of sodium borohydride (NaBH4). The conversion efficiency reaches almost 100% in 2.5 min with a small amount of WO3-x@NC as catalyst. After 5 successive cycles of reactions, this value still retains above 92%. Besides 4-nitrophenol, WO3-x@NC also possesses excellent activity in catalytic removal of organic dyes, such as Rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO). Oxygen vacancies from WO2 and good conductivity of nitrogen doped carbon matrix play important roles in the removal of these organic pollutants. WO3-x@NC also possesses outstanding IR light driven photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity. Furthermore, the influence of calcination temperature on catalysis is studied and an ideal condition to obtain catalyst with high activity has been obtained. We expect that WO3-x@NC will find its way as a promising material in water purification as well as a new resource for hydrogen energy.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000444664800004

Using these techniques we clearly show here clearly the two advantages obtained by pyrolysis in the case of FeTPP. i) Anodic shift in redox potential of the iron metal center and ii) the formation of a mixed-valence dimeric catalyst site capable of binding molecular oxygen and enable charge transfer in a concerted fashion.					10th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells Symposium (PEFC) Conducted Under the Auspices of the 218th Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society (ECS)10th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells Symposium (PEFC) Conducted Under the Auspices of the 218th Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society (ECS)	OCT, 2010OCT, 2010	Electrochem Soc (ECS); Energy Technol (ETD); Phys & Analyt Electrochem (PAED); Battery (BATT); Ind Electrochem & Electrochem Engn; Asahi Kasei E-Mat Corp; Ion Power Inc; UTC Power Corp; Umicore; Tokuyama Corp; Toyota Motor Eng & Mfg N Amer; Pine Res Instruments; Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K KElectrochem Soc (ECS); Energy Technol (ETD); Phys & Analyt Electrochem (PAED); Battery (BATT); Ind Electrochem & Electrochem Engn; Asahi Kasei E-Mat Corp; Ion Power Inc; UTC Power Corp; Umicore; Tokuyama Corp; Toyota Motor Eng & Mfg N Amer; Pine Res Instruments; Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K K	Las Vegas, NVLas Vegas, NV	5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1938-5862	1938-6737	978-1-56677-820-6	WOS:000313331100172

Both techniques have allowed us to report on the evolution of the electronic structure of the valence band over hydrogen exposure. These investigations showed the fast formation and desorption of water molecules, but no hydroxyl groups. The oxygen coverage of the surface depends on the Ni 3d band intensity during hydrogen exposure. By using the MIES technique, we observed that the reduction reaction is preceded with a induction period. These periods are not seen with UPS data. This difference can be attributed to the fact that MIES gives information about the outermost layer of the surface, whereas UPS probes the first innerlayers. So it indicates that oxygen atoms are desorbed from the surface, and then subsurface oxygen atoms diffuse to the oxygen-depleted surface. To interpret these experimental results, we carried out simple Monte Carlo simulations based on the fact that the reduction takes place on the surface along the NiO island perimeters. This simulation fits well the experimental data when a lateral mobility of subsurface oxygen atoms is taken into account, i.e. the reaction leads to the reduction of the three-dimension NiO before the outermost layer oxygen desorption.

Recent work has identified arginine oxidases that catalyze desaturation or hydroxylation reactions. Here, we investigate a desaturase from the Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea indolmycin pathway. Our work, combining X-ray crystallographic, biochemical, spectroscopic, and computational studies, supports a shared mechanism with arginine hydroxylases, involving two rounds of single-electron transfer to oxygen and superoxide rebound at the 4 ' carbon of the PLP cofactor. The precise positioning of a water molecule in the active site is proposed to control the final reaction outcome. This proposed mechanism provides a unified framework to understand how oxygen can be activated by PLP-dependent enzymes for oxidation of arginine and elucidates a shared mechanistic pathway and intertwined evolutionary history for arginine desaturases and hydroxylases.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0027-8424			WOS:000705926100001	34580201

Herein, a cobalt phosphate (CoPi) modified BiVO4 (BiVO4/CoPi) photoanode is prepared by electrodeposition. The physical and chemical characterization shows that the BiVO4/CoPi photoanode has a three-dimensional porous structure formed by the aggregation of nanoparticles. Amorphous CoPi is successfully deposited on the surface of BiVO4. The photocurrent density of BiVO4/CoPi increases to 5.87 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE (3.24 times that of BiVO4). Based on the law of conservation of energy, it can be inferred that CoPi acts as an effective co-catalyst to reduce the activation energy (E-a) of the oxygen evolution reaction. The chopping current density-time curve indicates that CoPi, as a hole extractor, can reduce the charge accumulation on the BiVO4 surface. The Mott-Schottky curve shows that CoPi increases the band bending of BiVO4. It can be found that the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE), charge separation efficiency (eta(sep)) and charge injection efficiency (eta(inj)) of BiVO4/Co-Pi are enhanced. This is attributed to the synergistic effect of CoPi: increasing energy band bending, accelerating the hole separation and acting as an oxygen evolution co-catalyst with faster water oxidation kinetics. This work may provide new insights into the comprehensive effects of CoPi on the photoelectrochemical water oxidation of the BiVO4 photoanode.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000744960000001

In this work, Co2P nanoparticles supported on heteroatom-doped carbon catalysts (NBSCP) are developed with an eco-friendly synthesis method using bean sprouts. NBSCP can be easily synthesized through metal precursor absorption and carbonization at a high temperature. It shows a very large specific surface area with various dopants such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur derived from small organic molecules. The catalyst can exhibit activity in various electrochemical reactions. In particular, excellent performance is noted for the ORR. Compared to the commercial Pt/C, NBSCP exhibits a lower onset potential, higher current density, and superior durability. This excellent ORR activity and durability is attributable to the synergistic effect between Co2P nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped carbon. In addition, superior performance is noted on applying NBSCP to a practical anion exchange membrane fuel cell system. Through this work, the possibility of applying an easily obtained bio-derived material to energy conversion and storage systems is demonstrated.									30	0	0	0	2	0	30			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000477505900001	31328875

We adopt 9-species and 19-reaction models of non-premixed hydrogen and oxygen separated by a multimode perturbed cylindrical interface. A new definition of mixing width suitable for a chemical reaction is introduced, and we investigate the spatio-temporal evolution of typical flow parameters within the mixing regions. After reshock with a fuller mixing of fuels and oxygen, the chemical reaction becomes sufficiently apparent at affecting the evolution of the flow fields. Because of the generation of a combustion wave within the combustion regions and propagation, the growth of the mixing width with a chemical reaction is accelerated, especially around the outer radius with large temperature gradient profiles. However, the viscous dissipation rate in the early stage of the chemical reaction is greater because of heat release, which results in weakened turbulent mixing within the mixing regions. We confirm that small-scale structures begin to develop after reshock and then decay over time. During the developing process, helicity also begins to develop, in addition to kinetic energy, viscous dissipation rate, enstrophy, etc. In the present numerical simulations with cylindrical geometry, the fluctuating flow fields evolve from quasi-two-dimensional perturbations, and the generations of helicity can capture this transition process. The weakened fluctuations during shock compression can be explained as the inverse energy cascade, and the chemical reaction can promote this inverse energy cascade process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-1120	1469-7645		WOS:000791488000001

Biomass gasification or electrolysis of water are possible clean routes. For a global application, the material solution for the electrodes must be sustainable, scalable, and relatively inexpensive compared to the current precious metal-based electrodes. A key requirement to sustainable and green energy systems is that all harmful or rare resources utilized in the process must be part of a closed material cycle. Here, a carbon-based electrode for hydrogen production is presented that can be part of a closed material cycle if produced from biomass. Continuous hydrogen production takes place at the cathode through catalytic water splitting during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while intentionally allowing the decomposition of the electrode into CO2 analogous to the process of natural biomass decomposition. This strategy of a sacrificial electrode could provide a scalable and low-cost material solution for hydrogen production from renewable energy sources. The theoretical and technical feasibility of using carbon to produce hydrogen is demonstrated, and it is shown that chemical modification can further improve the performance characteristics towards the catalytic process. Combined with renewable energy derived electricity, this idea offers a real option for future energy systems.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000539102400001	32428374

Herein, NixCo3-xO4 nanoneedle arrays grown on 3D porous nickel foam (NF) was synthesized as a bifunctional electrocatalyst with OER and HER activity for full water splitting. Benefiting from the advantageous structure, the composite exhibits superior OER activity with an overpotential of 320 mV achieving the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). An exceptional HER activity is also acquired with an overpotential of 170 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the catalyst also shows the superior activity and stability for 20 h when used in the overall water splitting cell. Thus, the hierarchical 3D structure composed of the 1D nanoneedle structure in NixCo3-xO4/NF represents an avenue to design and develop highly active and bifunctional electrocatalysts for promising energy conversion.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000457713300016	30600933

Improving the efficiency of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is critical for environmental friendly hydrogen generation through electrochemical or photoelectrochemical water splitting. Here we report the surface-engineered PtNi-O nano particles with enriched NiO/PtNi interface on surface. Notably, PtNi-O/C showed a mass activity of 7.23 mA/mu g at an overpotential of 70 mV, which is 7.9 times higher compared to that of the commercial Pt/C, representing the highest reported mass activity for HER in alkaline conditions. The HER overpotential can be lowered to 39.8 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) when platinum loading was only 5.1 mu g(pt)/cm(2), showing exceptional HER efficiency. Meanwhile, the prepared PtNi-O/C nanostructures demonstrated significantly improved stability as well as high current performance which are well over those of the commercial Pt/C and demonstrated capability of scaled hydrogen generation.									266	14	0	0	13	0	267			0002-7863			WOS:000440515200008	29983055

This is demonstrated by significant changes in their geometric structures and also in their chemical properties. Here we focus on clusters containing up to about 20 gold atoms and briefly review their structural evolution emphasising the role of isomerism and structural fluxionality. The discussion of chemical properties is limited to the interaction of gold clusters with molecular oxygen and carbon monoxide, separately, and their interaction in CO/O-2 co-adsorbates on gold clusters eventually leading to CO oxidation. Whilst highlighting results obtained using different experimental approaches, special attention is given to the insights obtained using infrared multiple photon dissociation (IR-MPD) spectroscopy.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			0081-5993		978-3-319-07848-9; 978-3-319-07847-2	WOS:000348906100008

The stabilities of the identified geometrical configurations are confirmed by phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, respectively. The density of states, bandgap and band edges, the optical absorption, mobility, and effect of strain engineering are determined and used to evaluate the photoelectronic properties of the monolayers. The results show that the I-Bi2Se3 monolayer possesses an approximate direct bandgap of 1.44/1.77 eV by HSE06/GW. However, the II-Bi2Se3 and III-Bi2Se3 monolayers show indirect bandgaps of 1.91 and 2.15 eV by HSE06 and 1.99 and 2.84 eV by GW. The band edges can match the redox potentials of HER and OER, although one of them needs + 3% biaxial tensile strain. The enhanced visible-light and UV absorptions and apparent mobility difference between the electron and hole are also observed. All results support the newfound Bi2Se3 monolayers could be candidates for HER and OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000675534100005

This light-driven process culminates in what appears as one step: a four-electron abstraction from two water molecules bound to the Mn4Ca complex of photosystem II. Recently, an intermediate of the O-2-producing reaction sequence was stabilized by elevated oxygen backpressure and detected by UV flash photometry [Clausen, J., and Junge, W. (2004) Nature 430, 480]. We scrutinized its properties by delayed chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. Half-suppression of oxygen evolution was observed at a similar O-2 pressure of 2.3 bar, as previously, now with photosystem II membrane particles from spinach, without artificial electron acceptors, and at a high signal-to-noise ratio. The data are tentatively interpreted as the stabilization of a 2-fold oxidized state of the catalytic center (S-2*) With bound peroxide and its slow conversion into the normal S-2 state by the release of peroxide.									36	0	0	0	30	0	37			0006-2960			WOS:000232125500016	16171392

Here, we show a highly efficient and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst with multilayer-stacked hybrid structure, in which vertical graphene nanosheets (VGSs), MoS2 nanosheets, and layered FeCoNi hydroxides (FeCoNi(OH)(x)) are successively grown on carbon fibers (CF/VGSs/MoS2/FeCoNi(OH)(x)). The catalyst exhibits excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 225 and 241mV to attain 500 and 1000mAcm(-2) and small Tafel slope of 29.2mV dec(-1). Theoretical calculation indicates that compositing of FeCoNi(OH)(x) with MoS2 could generate favorable electronic structure and decrease the OER overpotential, promoting the electrocatalytic activity. An alkaline water electrolyzer is established using CF/VGSs/MoS2/FeCoNi(OH)(x) anode for overall water splitting, which generates a current density of 100mAcm(-2) at 1.59V with excellent stability over 100h. Our highly efficient catalysts have great prospect for water electrolysis. While water-splitting electrocatalysis offers a renewable means for carbon-neutral energy production, it is a challenge to design efficient, active, and stable catalysts. Here, authors prepare multilayer composite nanosheet materials as bifunctional water-splitting electrocatalysts.									75	2	0	0	8	0	75			2041-1723			WOS:000626586400007	33654075

However, the fundamental reason for the undesirable properties of metal oxides behind the repetitive conversion process is still obscure. In this work, we take advantage of synchrotron X-ray techniques as well as transmission electron microscopy to monitor the structural changes during both conversion (lithiation) and reconversion (delithiation) reactions. The difference in diffusion rates of lithium and metal plays a decisive role in determining the reaction pathway. We find that lithium accommodation and extraction occur via different reaction routes: lithiation follows a kinetically driven way while delithiation adopts a route close to the thermodynamic ground state path. Thermodynamic structural evolution features the formation of an intermediate phase of Li-metal (M)-O, suggesting that lithium removal accompanies the Li/M ionic exchange and rearrangement of the oxygen framework. The slow diffusion of metal ions and the high kinetic and energy barrier for dissociating the intermediate phase are mainly responsible for uncompleted reconversion reaction, evidenced by the remaining Li-M-O phase at the end of charge. Imperfect reconversion reaction eventually limits the utilization of lithium ions over the repeated cycling. This work sheds light on structural changes occurring at metal oxides during both conversion and reconversion processes, which is strongly linked with the performances of conversion-type materials in applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000656971000004

Aqueous extract derived from the plant Amaranthus viridis L. (Amaranthaceae) (AVL) was used as a reducing agent for morphological control of the synthesis of CuO-Bi2O3 nanocomposites. The modified nanomaterial revealed an average crystal size of 49 +/- 2 nm, which matches very well with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) findings. Furthermore, the synthesized material was characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission SEM and energy-dispersive spectroscopy. The optical band gap energy of 3.45 eV was calculated using a Tauc plot. Finally, the bioorganic framework-derived CuO-Bi2O3 electrode was tested for energy generating and storage applications and the results revealed a capacitance of 389 F g(-1) by cyclic voltammetry, with a maximum energy density of 12 W h kg(-1) and power density of 5 kW kg(-1). Hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction studies showed good potential of CuO-Bi2O3 as an electrocatalyst for water splitting, with maximum efficiency of the electrode up to 16.5 hours.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000716026500001	35479863

A photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction that uses this dye@SWCNT hybrid as a particulate photocatalyst was conducted in the presence of an electron-relay molecule [methyl viologen (MV2+)], a co-catalyst [PVP-Pt; poly(vinylpyrrolidone)], and a sacrificial donor [1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide]. Photoinduced electron transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye molecule inside the SWCNT and the MV2+ ion outside the SWCNT. This is followed by the relay of the electron to the co-catalyst, which reduces H+ to generate H-2. The external quantum yield of the H-2 evolution reached a maximum of 8.5% under irradiation with light at 510nm. Notably, the photoinduced electron transfer between the molecules on the inside and the outside of the SWCNT proceeded smoothly despite the possibility of energy migration from the encapsulated dye to the SWCNT or the possibility of charge recombination.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0021-8979	1089-7550		WOS:000607186300003

Herein, free-standing heterogeneous MoS2/NiCoS nanosheets as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting are designed. The abundant heterogeneous interfaces in MoS2/NiCoS, enriched holes and few-layer structure of MoS2 can not only provide enriched active sites but also accelerate electron/ion transfer. Consequently, the optimized MoS2/NiCoS heterostructure achieves a low overpotential of 189 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 290 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline electrolyte. In particular, in a two-electrode electrolyzer assembly, the MoS2/NiCoS heterostructure nanosheets can afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.50 V, serving as one of the best water-splitting electrocatalysts to date. This work provides a feasible strategy to construct efficient free-standing heterogeneous bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									53	6	0	0	3	0	54			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000502302300039

By employing density functional theory (DFT) based Bader analysis for active sites identification, the effective electronic charges of constituent ions in the ordered-disordered crystal structures were calculated. Accordingly, for DFT result validation, structurally disordered Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 ECs were experimentally synthesized by heat treatment to 200 degrees C (CMO-200). The disorder-order transitions of CMO related change in surface atomic arrangement and alteration in the Mn3+/Mn4+ and Cu2+/Cu1+ states are modulated via corresponding heat treatment (200 degrees C-800 degrees C) of CMO, revealing significant influence on OER electrocatalytic activity and durability. The measured higher electrocatalytic activity of disordered CMO-200 contrasted with ordered CMO is attributed to higher Mn3+/Mn4+ and Cu2+/Cu1+ states, signifying the beneficial role of Mn3+ and Cu2+ for facilitating OER. The ordered CMO structures containing lower Mn3+/Mn4+ and Cu2+/Cu1+ ratios albeit reveal higher electrochemical stability than the disordered CMO. The present study, thus, provides fundamental insights into the influence of ordered-disordered structures and rearrangement of the oxidation state of active species and their combined synergistic effects on the electrochemical performance for engineering high-performance ECs for acidic OER.

The anodic polarization is smaller than the cathodic polarization, allowing current densities of 2 X 1O(3) A m-2 at 0.1 V and 1041 K in oxygen for oxygen evolution. Comparison with the polarization behaviour of similar sputtered platinum electrodes on BE25 shows little effect of the electrode material on the exchange current densities. This indicates that the electrolyte surface is active in the oxygen transfer process, while the noble metal electrode serves merely as current collector. Analysis of the electrode impedance shows strong influence of surface diffusion on the electrode reaction(s). For the exchange current density an unusual P(o2) dependence is observed.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0167-2738			WOS:A1992JB58000019

We show here that a wide variety of such complexes robustly catalyze two-electron oxidations, transferring oxygen from hydrogen peroxide to thioanisole, indole, and styrene substrates. Use of O-18-labeled hydrogen peroxide reveals the source of the oxygen transferred to form thioanisole sulfoxide and styrene oxide to be the activated ferryl moiety within these systems. Hammett analysis of the kinetics of thioanisole sulfoxide formation is unable to distinguish between a one-step, direct oxygen transfer and a two-step, oxygen rebound mechanism for this catalysis. Oxygen transfer to indole produces a range of products, including indigo and related dyes. Docking of heme onto a high-resolution structure of the G-quadruplex fold of Bcl-2 promoter DNA, which both binds heme and transfers oxygen, suggests a relatively open active site for this class of ribozymes and deoxyribozymes. That heme-dependent catalysis of oxygen transfer is a property of many RNAs and DNAs has ramifications for primordial evolution, enzyme design, cellular oxidative disease, and anticancer therapeutics.									90	2	0	0	45	0	91			0002-7863			WOS:000287831800060	21265562

These are remarkably preferred for efficient hydrogen production in energy conversion and storage technologies. Regardless of recent progress, their activity and durability are still far from adequate, due to less visible light effectiveness, wide band gape and high overpotential and low current density. Herein we successfully applied a novel visible light accessible photo/electrocatalyst, silver-silver bromide doped hollow mesoporous silica-titania (Ag-AgBr/HMST) for overall water splitting. The results of the physicochemical characterization indicates that the nanocomposite has exceptional morphology, high surface area, and uniformly distributed particles. These features exhibits the illustrious visible light induced photo/electrocatalytic behavior for overall water splitting. The hollow silica-titania provides incredible quality conducting channel, to get better mass loading and boost the charge transportation. While well-built connection of Ag, AgBr with titania, provides well active sites that accomplish obvious photo/electrocatalytic performance with OER current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at 280 mV and HER current density of 65 mAcm(-2) at -173 mV. This is almost equal to RuO2 and Pt/C that are very expensive catalyst for water oxidation. Therefore, the present work establishes the first example of hollow mesoporous photo/electrocatalyst for OER and HER water splitting. The outstanding durability prop up the use of mesoporous material for renewable energy application. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report that the electrochemical oxidation of the adsorbed phenyl group (found in the ionomer) on oxygen evolution catalysts produces phenol, which may cause performance deterioration in AEM electrolyzers. In-line H-1 NMR kinetic analyses of phenyl oxidation in a model organic cation electrolyte shows that catalyst type significantly impacts the phenyl oxidation rate at an oxygen evolution potential. Density functional theory calculations show that the phenyl adsorption is a critical factor determining the phenyl oxidation. This research provides a path for the development of more durable AEM electrolyzers with components that can minimize the adverse impact induced by the phenyl group oxidation, such as the development of novel ionomers with fewer phenyl moieties or catalysts with less phenyl-adsorbing character.									36	0	0	0	1	0	35			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000461538000006	30811171	
J	Xu, Xiaowei; Wang, Tianyu; Zhao, Cheng; Huang, Zhixiong; Zheng, Mingfang; Jia, Runping; Liu, Ying								MOFs derived NiFeP porous nanoflowers for boosted electrocatalytic water splitting								MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS				312						110760	10.1016/j.micromeso.2020.110760				JAN 2021	2021	High-efficiency and stable non-precious metal electrocatalysts are of great significance to the development of the overall water splitting system in alkaline medium. Here, three-dimensional hierarchical NiFe-LDH-MOF nanoflowers with adjustable Ni/Fe ratio were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. Subsequently, the NiFe bimetallic based organic framework is obtained by the gas-phase anion exchanging strategy, and the corresponding phosphides MOF (NiFeP-MOF) is grown. These Ni-Fe phosphides-MOF catalysts show low potentials, small Tafel slopes, and excellent durability, accompanied by a low overpotential of 32 and 233 mV for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions to provide a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, due to its large electrochemical surface area and 3D porous morphologies for electron and proton transfer, leading to efficient catalytic activities. It is worth noting that the symmetrical electrolyzer constructed by the NiFe-based phosphides MOFs demonstrate excellent water splitting performance, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a relative low potential of only 1.54 V, which is superior to the precious metal RuO2 parallel to Pt/C electrocatalyst (1.57 V @ 10 mA cm(-2)). Density functional theory calculations prove that the outstanding overall hydrolysis of NiFeP-MOF benefits from its hierarchical porous structure, which facilitates the effective adsorption and disintegration of H2O molecule on the catalyst surface. This work provides a promising tactics to develop high efficiency electrocatalysts for practical using of overall water splitting system.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1387-1811	1873-3093		WOS:000603359900006		
J	Iapichino, L.; Lesaffre, P.					Iapichino, Luigi/0000-0003-3938-8973			Uncertainties and robustness of the ignition process in type Ia supernovae								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				512						A27	10.1051/0004-6361/200913306				MAR-APR 2010	2010	Context. It is widely accepted that the onset of the explosive carbon burning in the core of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD) triggers the ignition of a type Ia supernova (SN Ia). The features of the ignition are among the few free parameters of the SN Ia explosion theory.Aims. We explore the role for the ignition process of two different issues: firstly, the ignition is studied in WD models coming from different accretion histories. Secondly, we estimate how a different reaction rate for C-burning can affect the ignition.Methods. Two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of temperature perturbations in the WD core ("bubbles") are performed with the FLASH code. In order to evaluate the impact of the C-burning reaction rate on the WD model, the evolution code FLASH_THE_TORTOISE from Lesaffre et al. (2006, MNRAS, 368, 187) is used.Results. In different WD models a key role is played by the different gravitational acceleration in the progenitor's core. As a consequence, the ignition is disfavored at a large distance from the WD center in models with a larger central density, resulting from the evolution of initially more massive progenitors. Changes in the C reaction rate at T less than or similar to 5 x 10(8) K slightly influence the ignition density in the WD core, while the ignition temperature is almost unaffected. Recent measurements of new resonances in the C-burning reaction rate (Spillane et al. 2007, Phys. Rev. Lett., 98, 122501) do not affect the core conditions of the WD significantly.Conclusions. This simple analysis, performed on the features of the temperature perturbations in the WD core, should be extended in the framework of the state-of-the-art numerical tools for studying the turbulent convection and ignition in the WD core. Future measurements of the C-burning reactions cross section at low energy, though certainly useful, are not expected to affect our current understanding of the ignition process dramatically.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000276245500049

However, the commercialization of metal-air batteries is mainly hampered by the expensive precious metal catalysts, which are necessarily used for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions within the air cathodes. Biomass waste, the earth-abundant renewable energy source, can play an intriguing role in generating high-performance and low-cost carbon-based electrocatalysts for air batteries. This mini review presents the latest advances on innovative processing strategies of diverse biomass waste sources into various carbon-based electrocatalysts, whose performance are comparable with or even can beat that of the noble metal catalysts. Furthermore, how the composition and structure of the biomass waste is related to the electrochemical performances of the resultant electrocatalysts for air batteries is discussed. This mini review offers the rational principles and strategies to upcycle biomass waste into value-added materials for energy storage and conversion application.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2451-9103			WOS:000483330900020

Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, detailed structural and chemical analyses of the metallic layer are carried out. With complementary thermodynamic approximations, these observations render an assessment of the local effective oxygen partial pressure, which is considerably lower than the external, ambient processing environment. Through a set of model experiments on Ni-BaTiO3-carbon composites, we illustrate that the presence of carbon is sufficient to reduce locally BaTiO3 and form the observed metallic layer at similar to 1300 degrees C. A phase stability analysis indicates that the formation of the Ba and Ni-Ti liquid phases provides a kinetic path for the interfacial reaction. (c) 2006 Acta Materialia Inc.

In this paper, a low-temperature (120 degrees C) solvothermal method was developed to synthesize pure phase Co3O4, Co-2(OH)(3)Cl, and (Co1-xCoxIII)-Co-II(OH)(2)Cl-x center dot nH(2)O [HT(II,III)] and detailed analyses of their formation mechanism, intrinsic as well as geometric activity toward OER electrocatalysis, were carried out. This method employs a variety of amines to facilitate the Co-II to Co-III oxidation, which otherwise requires continuous gas (purified air/oxygen) flow or usage of oxidizing agents for reactions carried out below 150 degrees C. The choice of solvent (water/water-ethanol mixture) was also found to play a pivotal role in the reaction pathway, phase, and morphology of the resulting products due to changes in the pH of the reaction medium. In contrast to the geometric OER activity that follows the order HT(II,III) > Co-2(OH)(3)Cl > Co3O4, the intrinsic activity (from specific activity and turnover frequency) of Co-2(OH)(3)Cl was found to be significantly higher compared to that of HT(II,III). Underlying factors behind this observation were probed and found to be the (i) higher OER active site density, (ii) larger interlayer spacing, (iii) slitlike pore geometry, (iv) amorphous and turbostratic nature, and (v) lower charge-transfer resistance of HT(II,III). While for HT(II,III) and Co-2(OH)(3)Cl, structural and morphological changes coupled with low charge-transfer resistance led to the rapid generation of active catalytic centers that promote the electrocatalytic process, high charge-transfer resistance and reluctance toward any structural change were found to be responsible for the poor OER electrocatalytic performance of Co3O4.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2574-0970			WOS:000505626600055

In addition, it enables tuning of the emergent physical properties of complex oxides, through strong interaction between the lattice and electronic degrees of freedom. In this communication, the electronic structure evolution of SrFeOx epitaxial thin films is identified in real-time, during the progress of reversible topotactic phase transformation. Using real-time optical spectroscopy, the phase transition between the two structurally distinct phases (i.e., brownmillerite and perovskite) is quantitatively monitored, and a pressure-temperature phase diagram of the topotactic transformation is constructed for the first time. The transformation at relatively low temperatures is attributed to a markedly small difference in Gibbs free energy compared to the known similar class of materials to date. This study highlights the phase stability and reversibility of SrFeOx thin films, which is highly relevant for energy and environmental applications exploiting the redox reactions.									68	3	0	0	2	0	68			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000412184100031	28758333

Recycling the waste LiMn2O4 of spent Li-ion batteries by pH gradient in neutral water electrolyser								MATERIALS TODAY SUSTAINABILITY				20						100205	10.1016/j.mtsust.2022.100205				DEC 2022	2022	The rapid development of electric vehicles powered by Li-ion batteries poses a challenge for the supply of raw materials , will also generate significant battery waste. Recycling the spent Li-ion batteries not only mitigates the pressure on resource supply but also reduces environmental pollution. Herein, we present a comprehensive study on using pH gradient generated in neutral water electrolyser for recycling waste LiMn2O4 cathodes without addition of external acid, base or chemical reductant. Li+ and Mn2+ thorn are leached from LiMn2O4 at low pH in the anode chamber, and manganese oxide is precipitated at high pH in the cathode chamber. H-2 and O-2 are also valuable byproducts of the process. Li thorn can be recovered in the form of LiMn2O4. Finally, the LiMn(2)O(4 )is re-synthesized, closing the loop. The exact roles of multiple variables on the leaching of LiMn(2)O(4 )as well as the associated phase evolution are carefully examined. In addition, gamma-MnO2 is deposited on the anode during the process, and it is characterized to be a stable and relatively effective catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction in acid. The process demonstrated represents a promising approach for recovering waste LiMn(2)O(4 )of waste Li-ion batteries in an environmentally friendly way.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report NiCo-NiCoO2 nano-heterostructures embedded on the oxidized surface of copper foam (NiCo-NiCoO2@Cu2O@CF) as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution. In this study, metallic Ni and Co interlinkage with NiCoO2 nanoparticles (NPs) are suggested to form by thermal decomposition of nickel-cobalt hydroxide precursors embedding on copper foam under a nitrogen environment. Bimetallic thin layered nano-heterostructures of NiCo-NiCoO2@Cu2O@CF exhibits a synergic effect of doubly active metals Ni and Co to achieve remarkable small overpotentials of 133 and 327 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The influential synergetic and structural effects have been extensively discussed to understand the overall water splitting for designing an efficient electrocatalyst. Hence, this phenomenon for surface modification of conductive substrate (CF) with a suitable combination of metal/metal oxide alloying as catalytic material helps us to design and synthesize low cost, highly efficient, non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.

The as-prepared Co/CoN/Co2P-NPC is achieved by simultaneous annealing and phosphating of a Co-N rich metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) precursor. Compare with the phosphorus-free Co/CoN embedded nitrogen-doped carbon electrocatalyst (Co/CoN-NC), the as-prepared Co/CoN/Co2P-NPC display superior HER and OER low overpotential of 99 mV and 272 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2). When Co/CoN/Co2P-NPC electrocatalyst is use as bifunctional catalysts in overall alkaline water splitting, it exhibit excellent behaviour with 10 mA cm(-2) current at overall cell potential of 1.60 V. The excellent performance of Co/CoN/Co2P-NPC electrocatalyst is attributed to the phosphating process that could further enhance synergistic effect, create stronger electronic interactions, and form efficient dual heteroatom doping to optimize the interfacial adhesion within the electrocatalyst. This present work will create more opportunities for the development of new, promising and more active sites electrocatalysts for alkaline electrolysis. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Limited abundance of iridium, however, poses limitations on widespread applications of these devices, in particular in the large scale conversion and storage of renewable energy. In this work we investigate if the electrocatalytic performance of iridium can be fine-tuned by thermal treatment of catalysts at different temperatures. The OER activity and the dissolution of two different iridium electrodes, viz. (a) flat metallic iridium surfaces prepared by electron beam physical vapor deposition (EBPVD) and (b) electrochemically prepared porous hydrous iridium oxide films (HIROF) are studied. The range of applied annealing temperatures is 100 degrees C-600 degrees C, with a general trend of decreasing activity and increasing stability the higher the temperature. Numerous peculiarities in the trend are however observed. These are discussed considering variations of oxide structure, morphology and electronic conductivity. (C) The Author(s) 2016.

This work investigates the effect of solution hydrodynamics on the degradation of Pb-Sn-Ca and Pb-Ca anodes. Galvanostatic experiments (50 mA/cm(2)) were performed at 37 +/- 0.5 degrees C using 0, 600, and 1000 rpm stirring rates for the durations of 24 and 72 hours. The PbO2 layer was reduced to PbSO4 (discharged) and the discharge duration was used in corrosion rate calculations. Weight loss measurements along with the discharge calculations revealed that the degradation rate of lead anodes increased with the solution stirring rate. In addition, the amount of PbO2 remaining on the surfaces was decreased as a function of solution velocity. Therefore, it was concluded that detachment of the corrosion products from the surface (flaking) affects the degradation rate of lead anodes significantly. Moreover, it was determined that the Pb-Sn-Ca anode performed better than the Pb-Ca anode in terms of both integrity and electrocatalytic properties for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Surface morphologies of the Pb-Sn-Ca anodes indicated that the roughness decreased as the solution stirring rate increased. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

A carbon fiber microelectrode was contacted with a single particle of nickel hydroxide in 5 M KOH aqueous solution. In this way, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments were carried out. The Ni(OH)(2); NiOOH redox reaction, oxygen evolution reaction and charge/discharge capacity were examined without any dilution with a binder and a conductive additive. Data were compared with those of the composite electrode consisting of the nickel hydroxide particle and a polymer binder, which is the practical form in the Ni-MH batteries. The potential-step technique was also performed to evaluate the apparent chemical diffusion coefficient of the proton (D-app) in the nickel hydroxide. Since the nickel hydroxide particle was a dense, conductive sphere, the spherical diffusion model was employed for the analysis. The D-app was found to be around 10(-9) cm(2) s(-1).

Thus the indirect measurement of the low energy region of the O-18(p,alpha)N-15 reaction has been performed to reduce the nuclear uncertainty on theoretical predictions.

Herein, we have fabricated hybrid carbon shell encapsulated nitrogen trimetallic phosphide (Ni-Fe-Mn-P) ultrathin nanosheets derived from a pristine trimetallic-organic framework (Ni-Fe-Mn-MOF) grown on nickel foam using 2-aminoterephthalic acid as the ligand. The curved edge, nitrogen and carbon co-doped trimetallic-organic framework-derived phosphide grown on nickel foam (Ni-Fe-Mn-P/NC@NF) demonstrates low overpotentials of 72 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 274 mV at 30 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with corresponding Tafel slopes of (79.8 and 56.8) mV dec(-1) for the HER and OER, respectively, in 1 M KOH electrolytic solution. The efficient and highly stable electrocatalyst, when constructed as a Ni-Fe-Mn-P/NC@NF (+, -) device, exhibits a cell voltage of 1.52 V at 10 mA cm(-2), lower by 0.06 V than that of the benchmark device RuO2@NF (+)//Pt-C@NF (-) at the same current density. We believe this work opens the way for Ni-Fe-Mn-P/NC@NF (+, -) to be applied in industrial overall electrocatalytic water-splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000823781500001

The method uses readily available, inexpensive precursors without involving toxic phosphine gas (PH3) during the phosphidation process. Moreover, the CNTs are synthesized and doped in situ without the aid of any external carbon additives. The morphology and structure were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The as-prepared Co2P/NPCNTs were then for the first time demonstrated to be an electrochemical sensor for the enzymeless detection of glucose. The Co2P/NPCNTmodified electrode exhibits a quick response and good linearity (R-2 = 0.997) up to 7 mM with a high sensitivity and a low detection limit (LOD) of 338.8 mu A mM -1 cm-2 and 0.88 M, respectively, towards glucose, selectively in the presence of various endogenous interfering agents such as D-sucrose, D-mannose, L-cysteine, urea etc. with a good long-term stability. When applied as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), Co2P/ NPCNT delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 370 mV with a Tafel slope of only 53 mV dec(-1), outperforming even the state-of-the-art RuO2 while maintaining excellent long-term durability.									109	2	0	0	5	0	110			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000396144200020

To unveil specific structure-activity relationships for electrocatalytic performance, innovative types of catalysts are required to overcome the inherent high complexity of regular powder catalysts, where thin-film technology gained significance in recent years. As we demonstrate, epitaxial La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (LSCO) thin films can be deposited with controlled bulk properties, surface structure, and stoichiometry on orthorhombic (110) NdGaO3 single-crystalline substrates by pulsed-laser deposition, providing ideal model systems for this purpose. The epitaxial thin films are dense and single crystalline with sub-nanometer surface roughness and grow well oriented toward the pseudocubic [001] thin films show high activity catalyzing the OER and can carry significant current density loads exceeding 100 mA/cm(2). Using these model catalysts, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy reveals the degradation of the material under these dynamic conditions, involving cation leaching and a phase transformation of the oxide. An altered surface stoichiometry as well as cobalt hydroxide formation is observed. Our results show that epitaxial model systems can be operated at large current density loads, allowing a systematic study of catalysts and their degradation under highly dynamic conditions.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000464477100016

Since vitamin B-12 is a soluble cobalt compound with high enzymatic activity, evaluating its OER activity is of relevance for biomimetic catalyst research. In this work, the temporal evolution of a homogenous vitamin B-12 catalyst in the early stages of OER was investigated by an advanced combination of in situ electrochemical liquid transmission electron microscopy (EC-LTEM), in situ UV-vis spectroelectrochemistry, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) methods. For the first time, we provided direct evidence of diffuse layer dynamics on the working electrode interface. The results suggested that the formation of cobalt oxyphosphate nanoparticles on the working electrode interface and in the presence of phosphate buffer is the initial stage of the catalytic pathway. Computational results confirmed that the ligand oxidation pathway could occur at potentials below the OER thermodynamic barrier (1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), which leads to a Co ion leaching into the electrolyte. This study showed that investigation of the apparent molecular mechanisms of OER with metal complexes requires careful analyses. We illustrate the high precision and sensitivity of EC-LTEM under operational conditions to monitor heterogeneous catalysts generated during OER and to evaluate their actual roles in the catalytic process.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2168-0485			WOS:000675465900037

To date, it is still greatly desirable to obtain bifunctional and precious metal-free electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) simultaneously during overall water splitting toward actual applications. Herein, we develop a cocrystallized strategy to obtain a Co/Ni-based mixed metal-organic nanosheet array (NiCo-9AC-AD) on a nickel foam (NF) substrate with controlled composition and morphology as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. The optimized Ni0.3Co0.7-9AC-AD/NF reveals efficient electrocatalytical activity and very low overpotentials of 350 mV for OER to attain a current density value of 100 mA cm(-2) and 143 mV for HER at 10 mA cm(-2). This is due to the synergistic effect of Ni/Co double catalytical active sites and ultrathin 2D nanosheet topology. More importantly, as an exceptionally active and stable electrocatalyst, the NiCo-9AC-AD nanosheet array requires merely 1.56 V to deliver a current density value of 10 mA cm(-2) in an overall water-splitting application. This work thus develops a simple approach to obtain a highly active cocrystallized metal-organic hybrid for both OER and HER, which may open the way to rational design of similar Ni/Co-based supramolecular systems toward electrochemical and energy storage applications.									95	3	0	0	11	0	95			2168-0485			WOS:000494894200059

In this work, the core-shell MoS2-x@CNTs composite is synthesized via a hydrothermal method with annealing and NaBH4 reduction post-processing, of which the defective MoS2 nanoflakes are homogeneously coated on the 3D carbon nanotube (CNT) webs. It is found that it delivers superior bifunctional catalytic activities toward both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions for LOBs. On the one hand, the charge re-distribution on MoS2 nanoflakes with sulfur vacancies can be effectively constructed by the surface engineering strategy, remarkably boosting the kinetics of Li-O-2 catalysis. On the other hand, the conductive and high surface area CNT network can facilitate mass transfer and provide enough free space for composite cathodes, accommodating the volume changes caused by the reversible formation and decomposition of discharge products during cycling. More importantly, the unique core-shell architecture can not only enable fully covering of defective MoS2 nanoflakes on CNT surfaces to avoid the contact between CNTs and electrolyte, distinctly suppressing side reactions, but also realize the exposure of more active sites to fulfill their catalytic properties. This work provides an insightful investigation on advanced catalysts and holds great potential for catalyst structural engineering in LOBs.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000716487600001

Herein, it is demonstrated that the introduction of the interfacial In-O-Sn chemical bonds at the ZnIn2S4/SnS2 interface regulates the band bending of ZnIn2S4/SnS2 heterojunction photoanodes, reverses the charge transport direction, and reduces the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential. Detailed analysis indicates that the interfacial In-O-Sn bond makes band adaptation to promote carrier separation and transfer through ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometry, hydroxyl radical production tests, and surface photovoltage measurements. Due to the special nanosheet morphology with exposed edges of the heterojunction interface, the In-O-Sn bonds are partially exposed, which can reduce the OER overpotential and boost the surface injection efficiency according to the PEC impedance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. The synergistic modulation of In-O-Sn bond yields a photocurrent of 4.57 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, AM 1.5 G) and a low onset potential of -0.14 V-RHE. This work provides a new solution for energy band regulation to improve the performance of heterojunction photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000780440300001

By means of the cyclic voltammograms (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), the mechanism of the anodic processes playing on the surface of Pb-Ca-0.6% Sn, Pb-WC and Pb-Co3O4 composite anodes had been measured. Cyclic voltammograms analysis revealed the corrosion rate of the anodic layer in PbO2 region. EIS analysis pointed out that the reaction kinetics varied a lot during electrolysis for it is a process indicating the formation and stabilization of anodic layer. At the very beginning of galvanostatic electrolysis, the reaction oxygen evolution (OER) was Pb to PbSO4 and alpha-PbO2. On the anodic layer after 24 h electrolysis, the more beta-PbO2 appears, and the adsorption resistance took a dominant part in the whole impedance. SEM observed the microstructures of the conventional Pb-Ca-0.6% Sn, Pb-WC and Pb-Co3O4 composite anodes before and after 24 h electrolysis, and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis showed the phase after 24 h electrolysis of the three anodes for Cu electrowinning.

Herein, a novel WSS comprising electricity generation from solar panels, electricity storage in rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs), and water splitting in electrolyzers, enabled by hybrid cobalt nanoparticles/N-doped carbon embellished on carbon cloth (Co-NC@CC) as multifunctional platinum-free electrocatalysts is reported. Consequently, the Co-NC@CC electrode presents excellent trifunctional electrocatalytic activity with an onset potential of 0.94 V for oxygen reduction reaction, and an overpotential of 240 and 73 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively. For a proof-of-concept application, a rechargeable ZAB assembled from the high-performance Co-NC@CC air cathode exhibits a high open circuit potential of 1.63 V and a superior energy density of 1051 Wh kg(Zn)(-1). Furthermore, an overall water splitting electrolyzer constructed by the symmetrical Co-NC@CC electrodes delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.57 V. Such a solar-powered WSS can harvest hydrogen day and night, demonstrating a potential for application in sustainable renewable energy.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000625233100001

However, their catalytic efficiency is still far from meeting need of practical large-scale water splitting because of poor electrical conductivity and limited exposed active sites. Herein, we report that amorphous NiFe layered double hydroxide film can be grown on CuO nanorod arrays supported on Cu foil (NiFe-LDH/CuO NRs/CF) to construct a core-shell heterostructure via a facile electrochemical deposition approach. The resulting core-shell heterostructure demonstrates excellent OER performance in 1 M KOH, only requiring a small overpotential of 290 mV to drive the current density of 50 mV cm(-2) with a low Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1), and maintaining a steady current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for at least 35 h with negligible decline in catalytic activity, which is the best OER performance among reported CuO electrocatalysts to date. Remarkably, this catalytic performance is also superior to that of the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst. The prominent catalytic performance of NiFe-LDH/CuO NRs could be attributed to the synergistic effect between NiFe-LDH film and CuO NRs. As a result, our research indicates that the construction of amorphous heterostructures could be a promising strategy for development of efficient OER systems.									44	3	0	0	4	0	44			2574-0962			WOS:000458705200053

Firstly, a uniform film of Co-Fe oxides has been electrodeposited on the surface of 3D skeleton of NF (CoFe/NF). Secondly, an ethanol solvothermal sulfurization has been adopted to convert CoFe/NF to ternary mixed metal sulfides (NiCoFeS/NF). XRD confirms that ternary NiCoFeS is composed of mixed phases including NiS, Ni3S2 and Co3S4 phases but no Fe sulfides phase, implying amorphous state of Fe sulfides. SEM images of ternary NiCoFeS films shows uniform film covering on the surface of NF, which is compbsed of many hill-shaped bulges structures. The OER measurements confirm the excellent performance of ternary NiCoFeS/NF in 1.0 M KOH, providing low overpotential of 40 and 160 mV to drive 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. A further enhancement of the stability of NiCoFeS/NF have been conducted via a secondary electrodeposition of Fe on NiCoFeS/NF to obtain NiCoFeS-Fe/NF, with slightly lower overpotential of 230 mV to drive 100 mA cm(-2) than that (310 mV) of NiCoFeS/NF after stability test. The role of Fe on OER ability and stability of NiCoFeS/NF have been discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									41	2	0	0	0	0	42			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000395599900017

In this work, a bromide-induced wet-chemistry strategy to synthesize Co2C nanoparticles (NPs) was developed. Such NPs exhibited high electrocatalytic activity (eta = 181 mV for j = -10 mA.cm(-2)) and long-term stability (no obvious performance decrease after 4,000 cycles) for the HER. This study will pave the way for the design and fabrication of TMC NPs via a wetchemistry method, and will have significant impacts on broader areas such as nanocatalysis and energy conversion.									47	7	0	0	1	0	49			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000398382300019

Herein, a scalable layer-to-layer assembly strategy is first proposed to delicately construct in situ core-shell Fe@FexNiO nanosphere interlink ultrathin Ni@NiyCoP nanosheet nanohybrids on Ni-foam via controllable two-step electrodeposition pathway. By deliberately introducing metallic Fe and Ni into amorphous FexNiO/NiyCoP nanoclusters serving as the everlasting-conductivity and attached-active-sites along with morphological controls, Fe@FexNiO/Ni@NiyCoP nanohybrids achieved ultralow overpotentials of 92 and 270 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with uncompromising long-term durability for 100 h in 1 M KOH alkaline-electrolyte, respectively, and was even superior to the Pt plate and RuO2 at larger current density (eta(OER) = 400 mV, eta(HER) = 129 mV at 1500 mA cm(-2)). Besides, it also exhibited wonderful catalytic activity in 1 M phosphate-buffer-solution (PBS, pH = 7), achieving a cell-voltage of 1.86 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The metallic Ni bonding amorphous NiyCoP was recognized as high-intrinsic HER activity, whereas the Fe@FexNiO coupling in situ newly generated NiCoOOH species on the Ni@NiyCoP surface-layer was identified as intrinsic OER active-matter. Synergistic effects between Fe@FexNiO and Ni@NiyCoP further accelerated the water-splitting dynamics. Impressively, the bifunctional Fe@FexNiO/Ni@NiyCoP/NF achieves an alkaline cell-voltage of 1.43 V at 10 mA cm(-2), representing the best bifunctional material hitherto, which is promising for the scale-up commercialization of the production.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000642313200001

Pd-e-NiCo-PBA-C exerts extremely low overpotential and Tafel slope for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) both in acidic and alkaline media, only 47 mV, 55 mV dec(-1) (pH = 0, HER) and 147 mV, 67 mV dec(-1) (pH = 14, HER), and 309 mV, 67 mV dec(-1) (pH = 14, OER), outperforming commercial IrO2-based and Pt-based catalysts. In addition, after 5000 cycles, the linear sweep voltammetry curve shows a negligible shift, indicating excellent stability performance. To test its overall water-splitting performance, Pd-e-NiCo-PBA-C is applied as both cathode and anode materials. A high current density of 33 mA cm(-2) at a battery voltage of 1.6 V is obtained, with the catalytic activity maintained at 97.3% after over 50 h. To get a further insight into the superior OER and HER performance, theoretical calculations are carried out, the better performance originates from the affinity difference of Pd and Ni atoms for gas atoms, and the replacement of inert atoms can decrease the binding energy and enhance the electrocatalytic activity.									33	2	0	0	1	0	33			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000598304100001

Janus Bi2O2XY shows an enhanced separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs and an augmented utilization of solar energy due to Janus asymmetry. The asymmetric halogen surfaces on both sides of Janus Bi2O2XY induce an electrostatic potential difference, which leads to a staggered band alignment. The solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies of Janus Bi2O2BrI and Bi2O2ClI have greatly improved compared to those of pristine BiOBr and BiOCl. Additionally, Janus Bi2O2XY achieves stronger internal electric fields (IEFs) and a more suitable Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H)) than pristine BiOX. Moreover, the halogen layer with a smaller electronegativity in JanusBi(2)O(2)XY forms a stronger IEF with the oxygen layer; consequently, the Delta G(H) of terminations value is closer to the ideal value for the HER. The localized edge states in the p-orbital density of states (DOS) projected onto O atoms are responsible for the HER activity of terminations. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of Janus Bi2O2XY for the HER and provides a strategy for improving photocatalysis. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, a new organic-cadmium (Cd) complex formed through Cd2+ coordination with p-phenylenediamine (PPD) was used to synthesize highly active Fe-embedded N-doped carbon catalysts for the first time. It is significant that with the decreasing molar ratio of Cd/Fe, an obvious microstructure evolution was observed in Cd-Fe-PPD from diamondlike blocks to thick flakes, and further bloomed into flowerlike shapes with ultrathin petals and then eventually exhibited large block starfish-like shapes. After carbonization, Cd was removed, slack and porous N-doped carbon was formed, and Fe was assembled in the N-doped carbon. Similar phenomenon was also observed in Co-PPD. The optimized Fe/NPC-2 material featuring uniform and well-dispersed 3-5 nm Fe nanoparticles embedded in two-dimensional ultrathin carbon nanosheets delivered excellent electrocatalytic performance (E-onset: 0.96 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), E-1/(2): 0.84 V vs RHE), which is very Close to those of commercial platinum on carbon (Pt/C) (E-onset: 0.95 V vs RHE, E-1(/2): 0.84 V vs RHE), and its methanol tolerance and durability also surpass those of Pt/C.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000472683300022	31120730

Understanding the catalytic role of spin, and thus modulating the spin density of a single-atom center, is of profound fundamental interest and technological impact. Here, we synthesized ferromagnetic single Co atom catalysts on TaS2 monolayers (Co-1/TaS2) as a model system to explore the spin-activity correlation for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A single Co atom adsorbed at the hollow site (Co-HS) with spin-polarized electronic states serves as the active site for OER, whose spin density can be regulated by its neighboring single Co site via tuning the Co loading. Both experimental and theoretical results reveal the spin density-dependent OER activity that an optimal spin density of Co-HS can be achieved with a neighboring hetero-single Co-Ta site (substitution of Ta by Co) for a superior OER performance, in contrast to a homo-single Co-HS site, which creates an excessive spin density over vicinal Co-HS. An optimized spin density of Co-HS results in an optimal binding energy of oxygen species for the OER. Establishing the spin-activity correlation in SACs may create a descriptor for designing efficient magnetic SACs for renewable energy conversions.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000645436800099	33787215

The catalyst was prepared using a Suspension Unit for Reactive Evolution (SURE) approach. The merit of the SURE approach lies in the ease of formation of smaller Pt NPs with a size of 1.76 +/- 0.26 nm and uniformity of dispersion on rGO surface by hydrogen reduction. The Pt/FePc@rGO catalysts show superior mass activities of 281.29 mA mg(pt)(-1) at 0.86 V in an alkaline potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte system. Compared with the commercial Pt on carbon (Pt/C) catalysts, the ORR current density of the Pt/FePc@rGO catalysts shows 2.8 times greater under the same operating conditions, while the average Pt loading is only approximately one-third of the commercial catalyst (Pt/C). The result of accelerated durability test indicates the Pt/FePc rGO catalysts show similar to 8 mV decrease in half-wave potential after 10 000 cycles 0-1.23 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) potential cycling; while the Pt/C catalyst was subjected much larger shift (similar to 53 mV). Methanol tolerance study also indicates the Pt/FePc@rGO shows a 2 mV shift corresponding to a current density of 2.5 mA cm(-2), while the commercial Pt/C shows 238 mV shift when an aliquot of 0.1 M methanol and 0.1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte was added. All these results demonstrate that the obtained catalyst exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity, excellent antimethanol poisoning property, and long-term stability.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			2574-0970			WOS:000461400300026

Herein we engineer a novel nanocomposite (RuP/NP-C) comprising ultrafine RuP nanoparticles encapsulated in N, P co-doped porous carbon derived from a well-defined Ru3+ incorporated phytic acid-polyaniline composite. Benefitting from its unique composition and architecture with full exposure of active sites, rapid mass/charge transfer, and improved structural robustness, RuP/NP-C nanocomposite can exhibit respectable HER performance. Significantly, from experimental and theoretical investigations, it is revealed that charge redistribution occurs due to interfacial electronic interaction between RuP and NP-C, leading to electronic modulation of RuP with upshift of the d-band center relative to Fermi level, thereby yielding optimal hydrogen binding strength for HER. This study highlights a promising route to tailor the electronic state of catalyst via interfacial electronic effect for boosted catalytic property.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000713641400006

Although researchers often fixate on its energy inputs, a truly 'green' hydrogen production process would also be sustainable in terms of water and materials inputs. To address this holistic challenge, we demonstrate a new green hydrogen production system which can utilize secondary wastewater as the input (preserving scarce fresh water supplies for drinking and sanitation). The enabling feature of the proposed system is a self-grown bifunctional CoNi electrode which consists of ultrathin, spontaneously deposited CoNi nanosheets on a three-dimensional nickel foam. As such, a green synthesis process was developed using an immersion procedure at roomtemperature with zero net energy input. Testing revealed that the synthesized CoNi electrodes can reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 197 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction and 315 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkalified wastewater. The values are similar to 16.5% and similar to 6.5% smaller than that from precious catalysts (20 wt% Pt/C and RuO2, respectively). Importantly, this CoNi catalyst offers outstanding durability for overall wastewater splitting. A prototype solar-energy-powered rooftop wastewater splitting system was constructed and can produce more than 100 L hydrogen on a sunny day in Sydney, Australia. Taken together, these results indicate that it is promising to unlock holistically green routes for hydrogen production by wastewater uplifting with regards to water, energy, and materials synthesis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2567-3173		WOS:000817522400001

Herein, a systematic computation based on the density functional theory (DFT) was conducted to examine the potentiality of the isolated transition metal (TM) atom anchored on g-CN, expressed as TM@CN (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt and Au), as multifunctional electrocatalysts toward HER, OER and ORR. Among these candidates, Rh@CN and Pd@CN are predicted to be the promising trifunctional catalysts, being capable of driving HER/ OER/ORR with the ultralow overpotentials of 0.21/0.33/0.64 V and 0.14/0.58/0.48 V, respectively, which can compete with or even outperform the currently well-developed catalysts. Importantly, the d-band center of TM atom can serve as an ideal descriptor for the adsorption energy of oxygenated intermediates. Such superb catalytic activity can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of TM and g-CN, which can effectively guarantee outstanding conductivity and electron transfer, thus tuning the interaction strength of adsorbates and optimizing the catalytic performance. The tunable catalytic activity of TM@CN would open a new perspective for optimizing catalytic performances and stimulate the developments of promising multifunctional electrocatalysts for renewable energy applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000681185200006

Here, benefiting from one-step preoxidation that makes Co foam to act not only as a conductive collector but also as the sole cobalt source, a seamless integrated electrode (Fe2P-Co2P/CF) is successfully synthesized in which Co2P, Fe2P, and Co foam are tightly connected by chemical bonds to construct a versatile, highly active, and a durable catalyst for water splitting in an alkaline medium. Such an electrode only requires 145, 208, and 254 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while it requires 243, 291, and 317 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to deliver current densities of 100, 500, and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively. Notably, using Fe2P-Co2P/CF as both an anode and a cathode at room (25 degrees C) and quasi-industrial (65 degrees C) temperatures, the operating voltages are as low as 1.87 and 1.71 V to reach 500 mA cm(-2), respectively, together with excellent long-term durability over 300 h. The prominent performance is due to the robust in situ growth together with the formation of a strongly coupled heterojunction between Fe2P and Co2P, making it one of the most potential candidates to meet the large-scale application of industrial water electrolysis.									31	3	0	0	0	0	31			2168-0485			WOS:000599195300023

Herein, the synthesis of Co9S8-MoS2 hierarchical nanoboxes (HNBs) as efficient catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is reported. The surface of the hollow cubic structure was organized by CoMoS4 nanosheets formed through the reaction of MoS42- and Co2+ released from the cobalt zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF-67) templates under reflux in a mixture of water/ethanol. The formation process for the CoMoS4 HNB structures was characterized by TEM images recorded at various reaction temperatures. The amorphous CoMoS4 HNBs were converted through sequential heat treatments into CoSx-MoS2 and Co9S8-MoS2 HNBs. Owing to their unique chemical compositions and structural features, Co9S8-MoS2 HNBs have a high specific surface area (124.6m(2)g(-1)) and superior electrocatalytic performances for the HER. The Co9S8-MoS2 HNBs exhibit a low overpotential ((10)) of 106mV, a low Tafel slope of 51.8mVdec(-1), and long-term stability in an acidic medium. The electrocatalytic activity of Co9S8-MoS2 HNBs is superior to that of recently reported values, and these HNBs prove to be promising candidates for the HER.									34	3	0	0	1	0	34			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000425381700009	29291345

We took the view that generating transition-metal sites with high valence at low applied bias should improve the activity of neutral OER catalysts. Here, using density functional theory, we find that the formation energy of desired Ni4+ sites is systematically modulated by incorporating judicious combinations of Co, Fe and non-metal P. We therefore synthesized NiCoFeP oxyhydroxides and probed their oxidation kinetics with in situ soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS). In situ sXAS studies of neutral-pH OER catalysts indicate ready promotion of Ni4+ under low overpotential conditions. The NiCoFeP catalyst outperforms IrO2 and retains its performance following 100 h of operation. We showcase NiCoFeP in a membrane-free CO2 electroreduction system that achieves a 1.99 V cell voltage at 10 mA cm(-2), reducing CO2 into CO and oxidizing H2O to O-2 with a 64% electricity-to-chemical-fuel efficiency.									331	11	0	0	33	0	332			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000423144000009	29359759

Because of the high activation barriers of oxygen (O-2) generation, the half reaction, i.e., water oxidation, is the rate-limiting steps of the overall water splitting efficiency. Photocatalysts with high activity and nonmetal usage are needed. Herein, we report one new thin-layered heterojunction sample of Fe2O3/C-C3N4, containing layered alpha-Fe2O3 and carbon-coated g-C3N4, obtained through one simple repeatable solid-state synthesis strategy. The layered FeOOH and g-C3N4 are first synthesized working as the precursors. Under N-2 atmosphere and 580 degrees C, the dehydration of FeOOH happens, and it transfers into layered alpha-Fe2O3; the water vapor destroys the van der Waals force of g-C3N4 and induces the parts of edge carbonization. Under the synergistic effect of vapor and heating, the thin-layered Fe2O3/C-C3N4 heterojunction is obtained. Without cocatalyst addition, the obtained sample shows efficient visible-light-driven photocatalytic water oxidation performance, i.e., a 22.3 mu mol/h oxygen evolution rate under the LED lamp of lambda = 420 nm illumination, 3, 16, and 30 times higher than reference Fe2O3/C3N4, bare alpha-Fe2O3, and g-C3N4, respectively. The key parameters for the enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributable to the carbon layer and the tight contact structure, which can work as the carrier (electrons from g-C3N4 and holes from alpha-Fe2O3) collection center and provide the small migration resistance. Moreover, the carbon shows a different migration rate for electrons and holes and then facilitates the separation of carriers to some extent. To our knowledge, no other papers on Fe2O3/C-C3N4-based photocatalytic water oxidation have been reported. This work can provide a new insight for synthesis of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts, and also help us understand the water oxidation reaction.									48	3	0	0	7	0	48			2168-0485			WOS:000441475500098		
J	Cardona, Tanai				Cardona, Tanai/AAE-3011-2019	Cardona, Tanai/0000-0003-2076-4115			A fresh look at the evolution and diversification of photochemical reaction centers								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				126	1	SI		111	134		10.1007/s11120-014-0065-x				OCT 2015	2015	In this review, I reexamine the origin and diversification of photochemical reaction centers based on the known phylogenetic relations of the core subunits, and with the aid of sequence and structural alignments. I show, for example, that the protein folds at the C-terminus of the D1 and D2 subunits of Photosystem II, which are essential for the coordination of the water-oxidizing complex, were already in place in the most ancestral Type II reaction center subunit. I then evaluate the evolution of reaction centers in the context of the rise and expansion of the different groups of bacteria based on recent large-scale phylogenetic analyses. I find that the Heliobacteriaceae family of Firmicutes appears to be the earliest branching of the known groups of phototrophic bacteria; however, the origin of photochemical reaction centers and chlorophyll synthesis cannot be placed in this group. Moreover, it becomes evident that the Acidobacteria and the Proteobacteria shared a more recent common phototrophic ancestor, and this is also likely for the Chloroflexi and the Cyanobacteria. Finally, I argue that the discrepancies among the phylogenies of the reaction center proteins, chlorophyll synthesis enzymes, and the species tree of bacteria are best explained if both types of photochemical reaction centers evolved before the diversification of the known phyla of phototrophic bacteria. The primordial phototrophic ancestor must have had both Type I and Type II reaction centers.									57	0	0	0	51	0	58			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000361885500008	25512103

Herein, bimetallic platinum(69)-cobalt(31) nanosheet nanoassemblies (Pt69Co31 NSNSs) were facilely synthesized through a one-pot co-reduction solvothermal strategy in oleylamine (OAm), using cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) and allantoin as the directing agents. The current synthesis highly depended on the critical concentrations of Pt and Co precursors, the combined use of allantoin to OAm as the co-reductant, and the use of proper allantoin concentration. The obtained nanocatalyst exhibited largely enhanced electrocatalytic activity and durable ability towards ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) relative to home-made Pt85Co15 nanoparticles (NPs), Pt19Co81 NPs and Pt black catalysts due to its much larger electrochemically active surface area than the contrasts.

Here, we propose a two-dimensional GeC/GaN vdW heterostructure, where the GaN monolayer and the GeC monolayer are stacked. The binding energy, phonon spectrum, and elastic constants demonstrate this material's high dynamic and mechanical stability. Most notably, the GW band structure, GW + Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) optical absorption spectrum, and the band alignment of the density functional theory (DFT) scheme and empirical formula reveal that the GeC/GaN vdW heterostructures have a dramatically high optical absorption coefficient (similar to 10(5) cm(-1)) in the visible region and a suitable band edge with sufficiently large kinetic overpotentials of the hydrogen evolution reaction (Delta E-c >= 1.945 eV) and the oxygen evolution reaction (Delta E-v >= 1.244 eV). Photogenerated electrons and holes aggregate on the GeC monolayer and GaN monolayer surfaces, respectively, which could make this heterojunction a promising candidate for photocatalytic water splitting and solar energy conversion.									27	2	0	0	0	0	27			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526552100073	32126761

X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and energy dispersive spectrosmeter (EDS) analysis were performed to explore the composition and microstructure of the IrO2-RuO2 binary oxide coatings. To explore the electrochemical behavior of the anodes in sulphuric acid solution, anodic polarization and cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were performed. The rate-determining step of the anodes for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was determined by the calculated Tafel slope values. The corrosion mechanism of the anodes in sulphuric acid solution was investigated by EIS measurements, FESEM and EDS analysis before and after accelerated life test (ALT). It was found that the surface morphology (e.g., cracks, crystallinity degree and crystallite size) is influenced by the calcination temperature. The active surface area of the anodes decreases with increasing calcination temperature. The active surface area for the anodes calcined at 350-450 degrees C is dominated by the "inner" active surface, while the anodes calcined at 500-600 degrees C is dominated by the "outer" active surface. Increasing calcination temperature decreases the electrocatalytic activity, while increases the stability of the anode for OER. Considering the electrocatalytic activity and stability, the moderate temperature of 450-500 degrees C is suitable for the preparation of the Ti/IrO2-RuO2 anode.									15	0	0	0	5	0	15			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000462803300022

We first report the synthesis of core-shell structure nanoparticles (NPs) with an Au core and an AuIr2 alloy shell (Au@AuIr2). Au@AuIr2 displayed 4.6 (5.6) times higher intrinsic (mass) activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than a commercial Ir catalyst. Furthermore, it showed hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic properties comparable to those of commercial Pt/C. Significantly, when Au@AuIr2 was used as both the anode and cathode catalyst, the overall water splitting cell achieved 10 mA/cm(2) with a low cell voltage of 1.55 V and maintained this activity for more than 40 h, which greatly outperformed the commercial couples (Ir/C parallel to Pt/C, 1.63 V, activity decreased within minutes) and is among the most efficient bifunctional catalysts reported. Theoretical calculations coupled with X-ray-based structural analyses suggest that partially oxidized surfaces originating from the electronic interaction between Au and Ir provide a balance for different intermediates binding and realize significantly enhanced OER performance.									55	2	0	0	5	0	56			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000636686900019	33656891

Orthorhombic single-phase SmMn2O5 was confirmed by (211) crystal plane from x-ray diffraction study. Formation of uniform nanorods was confirmed by field-emission scanning electron micrograph images. Phonon vibrations and Mn-O vibration modes were observed around 600 cm(-1) in Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectra. Presence of oxygen vacancies in highly dispersed SmMn2O5 nanorods was confirmed by photoluminescence spectra by the observed emission peaks around 493 and 520 nm. Magnetic transformation from dia- to paramagnetic behavior was revealed for SmMn2O5 nanorods with respect to the increasing concentration of NaOH precipitating agent used in the material synthesis. Electrochemical water oxidation kinetics of optimized highly dispersed SmMn2O5 nanorods were investigated by a cyclic voltammogram and the specific capacitance value was calculated as 352 F g(-1) at 10 mV s(-1) scan rate. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of highly dispersed SmMn2O5 nanorods was calculated by a liner sweep voltammogram and found to be 178 mA g(-1) with a lower internal resistance of 1.5 Omega.

Precursor II is a dimeric silicon cobalt cluster [mu-{(CH3)Si(CH2)}(2)][Co(CO)(3)](2). Thermal decomposition of the precursors was performed under argon. Evolution of H-2 in the early stage of the pyrolysis (<120 degrees C) shows that an initial cross-linking of the material is induced by the remaining Si-H bonds. Between 120 and 300 degrees C, the thermal decomposition of the complexes results either in the elimination of the CO ligands or in their reaction with incorporation of oxygen and carbon. At higher temperature, the elimination of hydrogen and methane corresponds to the mineralisation step of the precursors. By 1000 degrees C, the material is formed of metal-rich nodules homogeneously dispersed in a matrix. Co2Si is detected by X-ray analysis. Between 1000 and 1400 degrees C, carbothermal reduction occurs with evolution of CO. Simultaneously SiO2, SiC and CoSi phases are formed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0959-9428			WOS:000075327100028

Annealing in air at 200 < T < 275 degrees C results in a three-phase region within 0.25 < delta < 0.50. Two of the phases are known previously, namely SrCoO2.5, a phase with an orthorhombic brownmillerite-type (BM) structure, and SrCoO2.75 (T1), a phase with a slight tetragonal distortion from cubic symmetry. The third phase (T2) has a strong tetragonal distortion, and appears to be the missing n = 3 member of the SrCoO(3 - 1)/n series. Once the overall oxygen content reaches the value of (3 - delta)(aver) = 2.68(1), the T1-to-T2 phase conversion proceeds at constant (3 - delta)(aver). A more pronounced evolution of the c(T2) lattice parameter as compared to the a(T2) parameter implies a layered oxygen-vacancy-ordered structure for T2 with some flexibility for oxygen-content variation, in the style of the BM phase.

Cobalt chloride was used as the cobalt source. The melamine-formaldehyde (MF) resin provided the carbon source and nitrogen source, and thiourea provided sulfur source. In addition, common inorganic salts were added as templates to generate pores. The characterization results showed that the prepared materials contained high contents of N, S and Co, and were mesoporous composites. At the same time, the porosity of electrocatalyst depended on the type of salt and the mass ratio of precursor to salt, which further affected the electrocatalytic activity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The best prepared catalyst showed excellent HER performance. The onset overpotential of the catalyst was low (33 mV) and had a small Tafel slope (61.1 mV dec(-1)), in addition to good stability in alkaline media.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2192-6506			WOS:000790848100001	35510894

The polarization and electric field curves indicate that ZnSnO3 NWs exhibit typical ferroelectric hysteresis loops. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra reveal that the relaxation time increases with the increasing concentration of oxygen vacancies. Moderated 3H-ZnSnO3 NWs (thermally annealed for 3 h in a hydrogen environment) have the longest extended carrier lifetime of approximately 8.3 ns. The piezoelectricity-induced HER, via the piezocatalysis process (without light irradiation), reaches an optimal H-2-production rate of approximately 3453.1 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). Through the synergistic piezophototronic process, the HER reaches approximately 6000 mu mol g(-1) in 7 h. Crucially, the mechanical force-induced spontaneous polarization functions as a carrier separator, driving the electron and hole in opposite directions in ferroelectric ZnSnO3 NWs; this separation reduces the recombination rate, enhancing the redox process. This theoretical analysis indicates that the photocatalytic and piezocatalytic effects can synergistically enhance piezophototronic performance through capitalizing on well-modulated oxygen vacancies in ferroelectric semiconductors. This study demonstrates the essential role of this synergy in purifying water pollutants and converting water into hydrogen gas through the piezophototronic process.									106	5	0	0	5	0	103			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000496010100001

The origin of this deterioration was explored by investigating surface structure, surface species, and ionic oxidation state of fresh and stored LiNiO2 materials. Rietveld analysis of X-ray diffraction patterns showed not only the formation of Li2CO3 on the surface, but also a weakening of ordered layered structure for the stored materials. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that Ni3+ transforms to Ni2+ and active oxygen species exist on the surface of stored materials. Temperature programmed desorption-mass spectroscopy measurements gave evidence that active oxygen species (O-, O-2(-)) occur on the surface of LiNiO2 after storage. A surface reaction mechanism based on the transformation of Ni3+/Ni2+ and the evolution of active oxygen species is proposed.

Some 2-propanol forms 2-propoxide on Rh(111)-p(2 x 1)-O below 250 K and selective beta (with respect to the metal in 2-propoxide) C-H bond breaking at approximately 270 K is the primary path for acetone evolution. A minor amount of reversible C-H bond activation is also observed. beta-carbon-hydrogen bond breaking is proposed to be the rate-limiting step for the initial acetone evolution from 2-propanol on Rh(111)-p(2 x 1)-O at high coverage based on kinetic isotope effects. The rate of acetone evolution is in part rate-limited by desorption, however, for low 2-propanol exposures. In addition, there is some oxygen exchange between the surface and the acetone at approximately 320 K. Combustion to H2O, CO and CO2 is a competing pathway. Irreversible gamma-C-H bond breaking primarily leads to combustion. The reactivity of 2-propanol on the (2 x 1)-O surface is dramatically different from that on clean Rh(111), where nonselective decomposition to CO and H-2 is induced. The inhibition of extensive, nonselective C-H and C-C bond breaking is a crucial factor in determining the selectivity for beta-dehydrogenation to produce acetone.									54	0	0	0	1	0	54			0039-6028			WOS:A1992HB01700008

Therefore, developing a cost-effective, efficient, and robust OER catalyst is still a challenge. Herein, we report a fast, low-cost, and gram-scale approach to overcome the synthesis of freestanding, ultrathin (ca. 1.3 nm), and mesoporous CoP sheets through the microwave-assisted growth of a cobalt-layered double hydroxide (Co-LDH) precursor coupled with chemical vapor deposition. The present 2D nanostructure not only guarantees a rich surface of active sites, but also promotes the charge and mass transfers due to the ultrathin and mesoporous features that allow it to efficiently perform the OER. It was found that the surface of the CoP sheets was oxidized in situ under the catalytic conditions, suggesting that Co3O4/CoP is effectively the active form of the catalyst, thereby modulating the electronic structure of Co atoms (active centers). This was embodied by the lowering of the Co-LDH's required overpotential to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) from 296 to 265 mV and the Tafel slope decrease from 75 to 63 mV dec(-1) upon phosphorization. Such performances of CoP nanosheets are remarkably superior to those of commercial RuO2 and compare favorably to the best values reported for noble-metal-free OER electrocatalysts.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2196-0216			WOS:000496539000016

In this work, we have successfully developed a facile and effective strategy for fabricating a class of 2D porous carbon nanosheets that simultaneously exhibit high surface areas and uniform distribution of metal chalcogenides for superior oxygen evolution reaction. The synthesis of these 2D carbon nanosheets involves the in-situ metal ion adsorption and exchange by the sulfonate radicals of polymer sheets followed by carbonization to form a series of metal chalcogenides loaded porous carbon nanosheets (PCNs/MxSy). The abundant mesopores (e.g., 3-7 nm, 524 m(2) g(-1)) that derived from the spontaneous stacking of flexible GO precursor are advantageous to the exposure of heteroatom sites. The uniform catalytic sites (33.8 nm) formed in-situ effectively avoid the agglomeration of functional components, which are conducive to make full use of catalytic sites and consequently shows excellent OER performance. We hope that our novel strategy can open a new door for the application and innovation of fabricating 2D porous carbon nanosheets in a wide range of areas including energy storage, adsorption, catalysis, separation and so on.

J	Gest, H								Evolutionary roots of the citric acid cycle in prokaryotes.								Biochemical Society symposium				54				3	16						1987	1987	Advances in biochemistry, microbiology, and molecular biology suggest new approaches for exploring the early evolution of bioenergetic systems. These approaches, still in their infancy, are necessarily directed to detection of 'molecular fossils' in diverse extant prokaryotes. Since the Earth was devoid of atmospheric oxygen during early cellular evolution, it is likely that 'precursor fragments' of the classical citric acid cycle are to be found in contemporary anaerobic bacteria. Accumulating evidence indicates that such fragments originally served biosynthetic roles of one kind or another, before they were recruited for assembly of the energy-yielding aerobic cycle. The extraordinary versatility of citric acid cycle intermediates and reactions for multiple uses raises the possibility that origination of the aerobic cycle, viewed as an evolutionary event, occurred more than once.									15	0	0	0	10	0	15			0067-8694			MEDLINE:3332996	3332996

Nickel-based catalysts, as low-cost and effective candidates, show great potentials to replace platinum (Pt)-based materials in the alkaline media. The main challenge regarding this type of catalysts is their relatively poor durability. In this work, we conceive and construct a charge-polarized carbon layer derived from carbon quantum dots (CQDs) on Ni3N nanostructure (Ni3N@CQDs) surfaces, which simultaneously exhibit durable and enhanced catalytic activity. The Ni3N@CQDs shows an overpotential of 69 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution, lower than that of Pt electrode (116 mV) at the same conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that Ni3N and interfacial oxygen polarize charge distributions between originally equal C-C bonds in CQDs. The partially negatively charged C sites become effective catalytic centers for the key water dissociation step via the formation of new C-H bond (Volmer step) and thus boost the HER activity. Furthermore, the coated carbon is also found to protect interior Ni3N from oxidization/hydroxylation and therefore guarantees its durability. This work provides a practical design of robust and durable HER electrocatalysts based on nonprecious metals.									93	6	0	0	3	1	93			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000433404500009	29557645

Herein, we report a new nanohybrid consisting of phosphorus-doped molybdenum carbide nanodots supported on Ti(3)C(2 )flakes encapsulated by nitrogen-doped carbon (denoted as P-Mo2C/Ti3C2@NC), which can serve as a high-performance nonprecious-metal electrocatalyst for HER. The inherent anchoring sites of the conductive Ti3C2 matrix contribute to the perfect distribution and confined growth of the electrocatalytically active P-doped Mo2C nanodots, thereby constructing optimized interfacial coupling between the P-doped Mo2C nanodots and the conductive Ti3C2 matrix. Meanwhile, nitrogen-doped porous carbon shells can stabilize the Ti3C2 flakes against spontaneous oxidation. Thus, a synergetic effect of collaborative catalytic interfaces between Ti3C2 and ultra-small P-Mo2C nanodots encapsulated by nitrogen-doped porous carbon and an appropriate introduction of a Ti3C2 substance afford overall enhancement in electrical conductivity and exposure of reactive sites. As a result, the P-Mo2C/Ti3C2@NC nanohybrid catalyst exhibits remarkable HER activity with an overpotential of 177 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), fast reaction kinetics of 57.3 mV dec(-1), and long-term stability over 60 h in the acidic electrolyte, which exceed the P-Mo2C@NC, Ti3C2@NC, P-Mo2C/CNT@NC, and P-Mo2C/rGO@NC nanohybrids. This work paves the way for the development of advanced MXenes-based electrocatalysts for HER and also inspires the exploration of a new branch of MXene-based nanohybrids for renewable energy applications.									22	2	0	0	1	0	21			2168-0485			WOS:000567778600027

Here, a general and scalable strategy to prepare stable and efficient bifunctional electrode was reported, based on a novel hierarchical porous structure constructed by conductive electrocatalyst. The method involved the construction of 3D monolithic structure and its surface reconstruction by chemical etching process. This strategy produced an advanced 3D hierarchical porous Fe/Ni-P-B@MS electrode containing well-defined macropores (>100 mu m) at the inter-wire space and mesopores (<100 nm) distributed uniformly over the entire catalyst surface. This highly efficient bifunctional electrode required only 79 and 279 mV to reach 100 mA cm(-2) toward HER and OER in 1.0 m KOH.

Herein, the assembly of holey iron-doped nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) nanosheets ('holey nanosheets') is demonstrated by employing uniform Ni-Co glycerate spheres as self-templates. Iron doping was found to increase the rate of hydrolysis of Ni-Co glycerate spheres and induce the formation of a holey interconnected sheet-like structure with small pores (1-10 nm) and a high specific surface area (279 m(2) g(-1)). The optimum Fe-doped NiCo-LDH OER catalyst showed a low overpotential of 285 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1). The enhanced OER activity was attributed to (i) the high specific surface area of the holey nanosheets, which increases the number of active sites, and (ii) the improved kinetics and enhanced ion transport arising from the iron doping and synergistic effects.									43	4	0	0	2	0	44			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000481069200001	31270940

Herein, Mo-doped cobalt phosphide (Mo-CoP) nanosheets on carbon cloth are successfully prepared and evaluated for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst. The Mo-CoP catalyst displays an excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability toward HER in 1 m KOH solution. Relatively low overpotentials of 49 and 120 mV are required to reach the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, the Mo-CoP catalyst shows an exceptional stability with 24 h operation. The origin of improvement can be ascribed to Mo doping, which probably results in more active sites, higher electrical conductivity, and faster mass transfer. This work demonstrates a promising electrocatalyst for water electrolysis in an alkaline media and opens new possibilities for exploring water-splitting catalysts.									16	2	0	0	1	0	16			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000474269800004

The construction of controllable binder-free nanostructures with self-standing holey and ultrathin nanosheets is one of the promising approaches. Herein, by employing a combination of the potentiodynamic mode of electrodeposition and low-temperature phosphidation, three-dimensional (3D) holey CoP ultrathin nanosheets are fabricated on a carbon cloth (PD-CoP UNSs/CC) as bifunctional catalysts. Electrochemical tests show that the PD-CoP UNSs/CC exhibits outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction performance at all pH values with overpotentials of 47, 90, and 51 mV to approach 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic, neutral, and alkaline media, respectively. Meanwhile, only a low overpotential of 268 mV is required to drive 20 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. Cyclic voltammetry and impedance studies suggest the enhanced performance is mainly attributed to the unique 3D holey ultrathin nanosheets, which could increase the electrochemically active area, facilitate the release of gas bubbles from electrode surfaces, and improve effective electrolyte diffusion. This work suggests an efficient path to design and fabricate non-noble bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting at a large scale.									38	1	0	0	0	0	38			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000482546000040	31343153

Nevertheless, exploring a nonprecious, ecofriendly, and high-activity electrocatalyst for the HER in alkaline media is still a challenging endeavor. In this work, a polyoxometalate (POM)-based crystalline polymer, {(trz)(3)Ni-2 center dot 6H(2)O}[H3GeMo12O40]center dot 9H(2)O (trz = 1,2,4-triazole), is prefabricated, and then it is converted to Ni-Mo-S-rGO-200-24-2 composite under additional thiourea and graphene oxide (GO) by a hydrothermal method for the first time. Our work proves that it is feasible to take advantage of the synergistic effects among Ni3S2, MoS2, and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to enhance the electrocatalytic HER activity and durability in KOH electrolyte. Namely, Ni-Mo-S-rGO-200-24-2 shows a low overpotential of 118 mV@10 mA.cm(-2) vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and remains stable for 20 h. Judging from the overall catalytic performance, we can conclude that Ni-Mo-S-rGO-200-24-2 electrocatalyst is one of the best non-noble HER catalysts reported to date.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000734172600006

Here, we elucidate on the origin of CO2, which is the dominant gaseous species associated with the layered lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM) cathode, by implementing isotope labeling and electrolyte substitution in differential electrochemical mass spectrometry-differential electrochemical infrared spectroscopy measurements. Li2CO3 on the NCM surface was successfully labeled with C-13 via a process that involves its removal followed by intentional growth. In situ gas analytics on such NCM samples with C-13-labeled Li2CO3 clearly indicate that Li2CO3 decomposition contributes to CO2 evolution, especially during the first charge. At the same time, the greater contribution of electrolyte decomposition was indicated by the large amount of (CO2)-C-12 observed. Employment of butyronitrile as the electrolyte solvent in further measurements helped determine that the majority of electrolyte decomposition occurs via a reaction that involves the lattice oxygen of NCM.									116	10	0	0	4	0	121			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000451100500024	30335934

Here, rich P vacancies to modulate Ni2P/Cu3P interfaced nanosheets for overall water splitting is demonstrated. We conduct a series of experimental parameters to adjust the nanostructures of Ni2P/Cu3P, and to get insight into the synergistic effects of interfaces and P vacancies on the catalytic activities. Notably, Ni2P/Cu3P with rich P vacancies shows the lowest overpotential requirements of 88 and 262 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The good activity is ascribed to abundant electroactive sites, electric field effect at the interfaces and tuning the electron structure by P vacancies. In addition, as bifunctional electrode, Ni2P/Cu3P with rich P vacancies allows for a low watersplitting voltage of 1.60 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This work may open up a new route for efficient electrocatalysts through the synergistic effects of interfaces and vacancies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Droplet spray ionization mass spectrometry (DSI-MS) was used for in situ analysis and real-time monitoring of this reaction. DSI-MS can eliminate the detecting delay caused by the multiple handing steps such as dilution, filtration and extraction. This has the further benefit for real-time detection of reactive intermediates. Different from persulfate activated by quinones, PMS was activated by p-BQwith the generation of singlet oxygen (0;(singlet)) instead of hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) and sulfate radical (SO4 center dot(-)). The O-2* (singlet) was chemically trapped by using 9,10-diphenylanthracene as a chemical probe. The generated intermediates during activation of PMS by p-BQ were detected and characterized by DSI-MS in real time. A possible mechanism about O-2*(singlet) evolution involving peroxide adducts as well as dioxirane intermediates was confirmed accordingly. Using the DSI-MS to study the activation of PMS by O-18-labeled p-BQfurther confirmed the 0;(singlet) evolution. The results suggest that DSI-MS has advantages of characterizing the reactive intermediates that generated in the PMS/p-BQ process. It is thus a potential tool to trace the reaction process, to detect reactive intermediates, and to study reaction mechanism in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The similar two-dimensional layered structures ensured evenly attached alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets on the graphene oxide support and the formation of a sandwich-like structure. The sequential in situ phosphorization strategy not only generated a high density of ultrafine CoP nanocrystals but also simultaneously reduced the graphene oxide support. The enough exposed active sites combined with a highly conductive matrix resulted in an excellent electrochemical catalyst for overall water splitting. The overpotential is only 125 mV at 10 mA.cm(2) in 0.5 M H2SO4. Good electrocatalytic performance was also exhibited in alkaline conditions for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The overpotential is 119 mV for HER and 374 mV for OER at 10 mA.cm(2) in 1 M KOH. More importantly, the composite exhibited much higher exchange current densities during HER processes (1.64 x 10(-4) A.cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 2.93 x 10(-4) A.cm(-2) in 1 M KOH) when compared with similar materials reported before. This low-cost, simple, and efficient approach is suitable for mass production and practical applications.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0743-7463			WOS:000518234900008	32036665

In this article, IrxRu1-xOy (y = 0 or 2) nanofibers with diverse compositions of Ir/IrO2 and RuO2 are synthesized by electrospinning and calcination procedures. Their HER activities are measured in 1.0 M NaOH. Interestingly, the HER activities of IrxRu1-xOy nanofibers improve gradually during repetitive cathodic potential scans for HER, and then eventually reach the steady-state consistencies. This cathodic activation is attributed to the transformation of the nanofiber surface oxides to the metallic alloy. Among a series of IrxRu1-xOy nanofibers, the cathodically activated Ir0.80Ru0.20Oy shows the best HER activity and stability even compared with IrOy and RuOy, commercial Pt and commercial Ir (20 wt % each metal loading on Vulcan carbon), where a superior stability is possibly ascribed to the instant generation of active Ir and Ru metals on the catalyst surface upon HER. Density functional theory calculation results for hydrogen adsorption show that the energy and adsorbate-catalyst distance at metallic Ir0.80Ru0.20 are close to those at Pt. This suggests that mixed metallic Ir and Ru are significant contributors to the improved HER activity of Ir0.80Ru0.20Oy after the cathodic activation. The present findings clearly demonstrate that the mixed oxide of Ir and Ru is a very effective electrocatalytic system for HER.									37	3	0	0	1	0	38			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000422814400059	29250950

High-performance and stable non-noble electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are urgently desired to improve the efficiency of water splitting for large-scale hydrogen production. Herein, a flowerlike heterojunction catalyst composed of N-doped carbon films and Mo2C nanoparticles strongly coupled with ultrasmall Ni or FeNi alloy (Ni-Mo2C/CF or FeNi-Mo2C/CF) is in-situ synthesized for efficient water splitting. The as-prepared samples with unique architecture and composition combine the synergistic effects of both geometric design and electronic modification, possessing plenty of active sites, robust heterostructures, abundant channels for rapid mass transport and electron/ion transfer, and the improved conductivity for high-efficiency charge exchange during electrocatalytic process. The optimized Ni-Mo2C/CF for HER and FeNi-Mo2C/CF for OER achieve overpotentials of 81 and 228 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, the FeNi-Mo2C/CF(+) //Ni-Mo2C/CF(-) alkaline water electrolyzer demonstrates a low cell voltage of 1.53 V at 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming most ever-reported water electrolyzer cells, and impressive stability over 24 h at 50 mA cm(-2).

The overpotential gain of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by high concentration of an acid and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by high concentration of a base was utilized for this new state-of-the art electro-syntheses. Difference in generation rate between acid electrocatalyst Co(III) and base electrocatalyst Co(I) was minimized by controlling the flow of H3O+ ions from anode to cathode. Also, variation in the nature of cathode materials was found to influence the formation rate of both acid Co(III) and base Co(I) electrocatalysts. We have shown that by selecting a suitable combination of electrode pair and controlling the presence of H3O+ ions it becomes possible to synthesize 3.5 mM of Co(III) and 2.5 mM of Co(I) simultaneously in both compartments of a divided electrolytic cell. This achievement on the hitherto unreported development in electrocatalyst synthesis strategy is the first of its kind in divided electrolytic cells.

These decades have witnessed the use of electrodes of different nature (from single crystals to nanoparticulate films), new electrode materials (including ternary and multinary transition metal oxides), and different strategies for improving their efficiency and stability (e.g.doping or protective layers). Although the very high initial expectations for using oxide electrodes in solar energy conversion were not fully met, substantial efforts have been devoted to reach an in-depth understanding of the processes limiting their functioning, providing firm bases for further developments. In this article, we review our main contributions in this field; in particular, we focus on the water photooxidation (i.e.oxygen evolution reaction), water photoreduction (i.e.hydrogen evolution reaction) and full water splitting processes (in a tandem cell) with binary and ternary oxides, including metal hydroxides as co-catalysts. We emphasize the importance of modeling and obtaining mechanistic insights and we conclude with a reflection on the main issues to be tackled in this field, which in our opinion should experience major advances in the coming years.									16	0	0	0	4	0	15			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000579572200001	32960202

In this work, cubic (Fe0.5Ni0.5)S-2 nanocrysals with a monodispersed size of ca. 10 nm were successfully prepared via a hot-injection reaction with a Schlenk line system. Because of the FeNi-oleate complex as transition metal source, no other by-products were produced. The (Fe0.5Ni0.5)S-2 nanocrystal/carbon black composite with different nanocrystal contents was control fabricated. Because the composite possessed two merits, more catalytically active sites of nanocrystals and fast electron transfer of carbon black, it is a promising catalyst for electrochemical water splitting and reduction of I-3 (-) in DSSCs. As the counter electrode catalysts for reduction of I-3 (-), DSSCs based on the composite with 57% (Fe0.5Ni0.5)S-2 nanocrystal contents have a high power conversion efficiency of 6.71%, which was comparable to Pt-based DSSCs (7.05%). The electrochemical measurement showed that (Fe0.5Ni0.5)S-2 nanocrystals had a good catalytic activity for reduction of I-3 (-). As the catalytic electrode for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the composite electrode with 57% (Fe0.5Ni0.5)S-2 nanocrystal contents displayed an overpotential of 250 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution. It retained good HER activity for 1000-cycle measurements. The density functional theory showed the free energy of hydrogen adsorbed on the Ni site near S defects was - 0.12 eV, which was smaller than that of the Fe site near S defects. So, the Ni site near S defects of (Fe0.5Ni0.5)S-2 was the main catalytically active site for HER. Also, the (Fe0.5Ni0.5)S-2 nanocrystals displayed good electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction. This type of double metal sulfide with monodispersed size paves the way for new insight into earth-abundance catalysts for water splitting and I-3 (-) reduction.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0922-6168	1568-5675		WOS:000435367000028		
J	Pacheco, JAD								Constraints on the early galactic cosmic ray activity from light element abundances								ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS				7	1-2			15	19		10.1016/S0927-6505(97)00002-9				JUN 1997	1997	New data on the Be and B abundances in halo stars indicate a linear correlation with metallicity. Such a 'primary' behaviour of these light elements doesn't support the scenario where their production occurs in the interstellar medium, through spallation reactions. Be and B are probably produced in the oxygen-rich ejecta of type Il supernovae. The right amount of those elements can be obtained if each supernova event converts about 10(51) erg into high energy particles and the irradiation time is about 100-1000 years. The positive detection of Li-6 in HD 84937 constrains the early cosmic ray intensity to values comparable to those presently found in the galactic disk.

Here, a highly efficient multifunctional electrocatalyst is demonstrated, i.e., 2D nanosheet array of Mo-doped NiCo2O4/Co5.47N heterostructure deposited on nickel foam (Mo-NiCo2O4/Co5.47N/NF). The successful doping of non-3d high-valence metal into a heterostructured nanosheet array, which is directly grown on a conductive substrate endows the resultant catalyst with balanced electronic structure, highly exposed active sites, and binder-free electrode architecture. As a result, the Mo-NiCo2O4/Co5.47N/NF exhibits remarkable catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), affording high current densities of 50 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 310 mV for OER, and 170 mV for HER, respectively. Moreover, a low voltage of 1.56 V is achieved for the Mo-NiCo2O4/Co5.47N/NF-based water splitting cell to reach 10 mA cm(-2). More importantly, a portable overall water splitting device is demonstrated through the integration of a water-splitting cell and two Zn-air batteries (open-circuit voltage of 1.43 V), which are all fabricated based on Mo-NiCo2O4/Co5.47N/NF, demonstrating a low-cost way to generate fuel energy. This work offers an effective strategy to develop high-performance metal-doped heterostructured electrode.									92	12	0	0	5	0	92			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000511244700001	31995284

Developing a feasible strategy to achieve higher catalytic activity with low usage of noble metals is vital and urgent. Herein, a simple nitridation route is proposed to design a hybrid material with both ruthenium (Ru) species and mixed metal nitride matrixes (Ru-NiWNx). Benefitting from the intrinsic high conductivity of metal nitrides, abundant catalytic active sites, and strong electron interactions, the Ru-NiWNx catalyst shows excellent bifunctional activity in alkaline electrolytes. The overpotentials are 70 mV and 270 mV at the geometric current density of 100 mA cm-2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. After further assembly into an electrolyzer, the Ru-NiWNx also shows superior performance. The voltage of the elec-trolyzer only needs 1.49 V to reach 100 mA cm-2 at the test temperature of 80 degrees C, indicating the promis-ing application for hydrogen production. Our work paves a new strategy to design high-active hybrid materials for overall water splitting.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The reduction in cathode and anode overpotentials is thought to be due to the change in the porosity and tortuosity of catalyst layers when H-2 evolves from the catalyst layers. As a result of this change, electrode catalyst utilization is increased and membrane electrode assembly performance is improved.

Nevertheless it is still a major challenge to design and prepare highly active noble metal-free electrocatalysts with controllable structure and composition for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, Mo2C regulated by cobalt components (Co and CoO) doping in Ndoped hollow carbon nanofibers (marked as Mo2C/Co/CoO-NHCNFs) are firstly designed and prepared via a facile coaxial electrospinning followed by calcination process. The onedimensional conductive carbon host, hollow structure and synergistic effect among CoO, Co and Mo2C can jointly promote electron transfer, augment exposure of active sites and adjust the electronic structure of the active sites, resulting in the excellent of HER performances. The optimized catalyst has a high specific surface area of 101.27 m2 g-1.Meanwhile, it has a low overpotential of 143 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and aSatisfactorily, the overpotential is reduced by 231 mV at the same current density compared with Mo2C doped in N-doped carbon nanofibers (named as Mo2C-NCNFs). Moreover, the Mo2C/Co/CoO-NHCNFs also demonstrate superior long-term stability. The formative mechanism of Mo2C/Co/CoO-NHCNFs is expounded, and the construction technique is established. The design philosophy and the simple and economical method are of significance for development of HER electrocatalysts. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, the electronic structure of NiO nanocrystals is modified by doping with a small amount of Li+. The Li+ doped NiO nanocrystals show much better OER activity than pristine NiO and LiNiO2, which is a result of tuned Fermi levels, stronger hybridization between Ni 3d and O 2p, and narrowed energy band gap.

Here, we develop a new strategy for the first design and synthesis of a NiO@Ni decorated WS2 nanosheet array on carbon cloth (NiO@Ni/WS2/CC) composite. This composite serves as a unique three-dimensional (3D) synergistic electrocatalyst that not only combines the intrinsic properties of individual NiO@Ni and WS2, but also exhibits significantly improved HER and OER activities when compared to that of pure NiO@Ni and WS2. This electrocatalyst possesses Pt-like activity for HER and exhibits better OER performance than that for commercial RuO2, as well as demonstrating superior long-term durability in alkaline media. Furthermore, it enables an alkaline electrolyzer with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage as 1.42 V, which is the lowest one among all reported values to date. The excellent performance is mainly attributed to the unique 3D configuration and multicomponent synergies among NiO, Ni, and WS2. Our findings provide a new idea to design advanced bifunctional catalysts for water splitting.GRAPHICS									86	3	0	0	2	0	88			2374-7943	2374-7951		WOS:000423170700013	29392183

First, reduced graphene oxide supported palladium and manganese oxide nanoparticle (rGO/Pd-Mn2O3) catalyst was synthesized via a simple chemical method at room temperature; then, it was electrochemically reduced for oxidation reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. The chemical composition and morphological properties of ErGO/Pd-Mn2O3 was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The TEM images reveals that, nano-sized Pd and Mn2O3 particles were disperse on the ErGO sheet without aggregation. The as-prepared ErGO/Pd-Mn2O3 was employed for ORR in alkaline media which shows higher ORR activity with more positive onset and half-wave potential, respectively. Remarkably, ErGO/Pd-Mn2O3 reduced oxygen via four-electron transfer pathway with negligible amount of intermediate peroxide species (HO2-). Furthermore, the higher stability and excellent methanol tolerance of the ErGO/Pd-Mn2O3 compared to commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) catalyst, indicating its suitability for fuel cells.

With x value being 1.4, the as-prepared Co1.4Ni1.6S2/NF shows superior performance as a HER electrode with low overpotentials of 68 mV, 160 mV and 226 mV at current densities of 10, 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) respectively and exhibits remarkable electrochemical durability for 50 h in 1.0 M KOH solution. We propose that the synergistic and electron-coupling effect between Co and Ni atoms in the CoxNi3-xS2/NF networked nanosheets lead to abundant active sites on surface and optimizes electronic structure. Density functional theory calculations indicate the introduction of Co atom can reduce the adsorption of H* thus optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy. The CoxNi3-xS2 nanosheets not only break through the limitations of traditional Ni-Co-S materials at the ratio of Ni and Co : S as 3 : 4 but also improve the activity of hydrogen evolution. The 3D CoxNi3-xS2/NF nanomaterials become a promising alternative to the Pt-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000492948300001

In this work, the MoSSe/XY2 (X = Hf, Zr; S, Se) heterostructures (HSs) with different contacts are proposed for Z-scheme photocatalytic water-spitting by first principles calculation. The separation of photogenerated carriers for HfSe2/SMoSe and ZrSe2/SMoSe HSs is limited by the type-I band alignment, while the hydrogen production ability of HfSe2/SeMoS and ZrSe2/SeMoS HSs is limited by the lower conduction band edge positions relative to the water reduction potential. The HfS2/SMoSe, HfS2/SeMoS, ZrS2/SMoSe, and ZrS2/SeMoS HSs are direct Z-scheme water-splitting photocatalysts with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurring at the Hf(Zr)S-2 layer and MoSSe layer, respectively. More excitingly, the S (or Se) vacancies effectively lower the HER overpotentials.

Structural and chemical changes to a greigite (Fe3S4)-modified electrode were determined at -0.6 V versus standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) at pH 7, under conditions of the HER. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy was employed at the Fe K-edge to show that iron-sulfur linkages were replaced by iron-oxygen units under these conditions. The resulting material was determined as 60% greigite and 40% iron hydroxide (goethite) with a proposed core-shell structure. A large increase in pH at the electrode surface (to pH 12) is caused by the generation of OH- as a product of the HER. Under these conditions, iron sulfide materials are thermodynamically unstable with respect to the hydroxide. In situ infrared spectroscopy of the solution near the electrode interface confirmed changes in the phosphate ion speciation consistent with a change in pH from 7 to 12 when -0.6 V versus SHE is applied. Saturation of the solution with CO2 resulted in the inhibition of the hydroxide formation, potentially due to surface adsorption of HCO3-. This study shows that the true nature of the greigite electrode under conditions of the HER is a core-shell greigite-hydroxide material and emphasizes the importance of in situ investigation of the catalyst under operation to develop true and accurate mechanistic models.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			1944-8244			WOS:000446142100027	30028585

Here, through mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (mRIXS), we have independently quantified the evolving redox states of both cations and anions in Na2/3Mg1/3Mn2/3O2. The bulk Mn redox emerges from initial discharge and is quantified by inverse partial fluorescence yield (iPFY) from Mn-L mRIXS. Bulk and surface Mn activities likely lead to the voltage fade. O-K super-partial fluorescence yield (sPFY) analysis of mRIXS shows 79% lattice oxygen redox reversibility during the initial cycle, with 87% capacity sustained after 100 cycles. In Li1.17Ni0.21Co0.08Mn0.54O2, lattice oxygen redox is 76% initial-cycle reversible but with only 44% capacity retention after 500 cycles. These results unambiguously show the high reversibility of lattice oxygen redox in both Li-ion and Na-ion systems. The contrast between Na2/3Mg1/3Mn2/3O2 and Li1.17Ni0.21Co0.08Mn0.54O2 systems suggests the importance of distinguishing lattice oxygen redox from other oxygen activities for clarifying its intrinsic properties.									156	11	0	0	11	0	160			2542-4351			WOS:000460076100019

Here, two disordered ruthenate double-perovskites Ca2ScRuO6 (CSR) and CaSrScRuO6 (CSSR) were synthesized by the conventional high-temperature solid-state reaction method, and their trifunctional electrocatalytic behaviors for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER/HER) were investigated in alkaline medium (1 M KOH). The orthorhombic (space group Pbnm) crystal structures of both CSR and CSSR were refined from the neutron and laboratory X-ray powder diffraction data. The oxidation states of Ru cations in both compounds were shown to be predominantly Ru+5, confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies. The as-prepared bulk perovskites showed excellent ORR performance with an onset potential of similar to 0.89 V for CSR and 0.90 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for CSSR, respectively. In addition, both compounds showed significantly low overpotentials toward OER (353 and 323 mV) and HER (313 and 275 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), demonstrating them to be active trifunctional electrocatalysts. The substitution of an alkaline earth metal at the A-site introduces a synergistic effect of structural distortion and electronic properties of Ru+5 metal ions responsible for enhanced trifunctional electrocatalytic activities. Such trifunctional catalytic behaviors of CSR and CSSR materials can be further understood by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The present finding not only provides insight into the catalytic activity of these materials but also presents an example of efficient trifunctional bulk-phase oxide electrocatalysts for practical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000856584800001

Herein, well-defined bimetallic CoFe alloyed nanocrystals wrapped in nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon nanocubes (CoFe@N-GCNCs-700) are synthesized by pyrolysis of CoFe-based Prussian blue analogue nanocubes@phenolic resin. The resulting CoFe@N-GCNCs-700, as an advanced trifunctional catalyst, exhibits prominent electrocatalytic behaviors for ORR (0.802 V of half-wave potential), OER (273 mV of overpotential at 10 mA cm-2) and HER (91.5 mV of overpotential at 10 mA cm-2) in the alkaline solution. Furthermore, its practicability is further exploited by overall water splitting. The output voltage of only 1.63 V is demanded to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Besides, the CoFe@N-GCNCs-700 based rechargeable Zn-air batteries exhibit large peak power density (132.5 mW cm-2) and superior cycling stability (100 h without evident degeneration). This research offers some new prospects in fabrication of highly effective multifunctional catalysts for electrochemical energy applications.

Tremendous investigations on the binary and ternary metal sulfides/selenides have demonstrated extraordinary chemical and physical properties such as good structural stability and adjustable chemical composition. The ternary amorphous refractory metal selenides (MWSex; M = Fe, Co, Ni, Mn) have been synthesized by the hot-injection method. The NiWSex, CoWSex, FeWSex and MnWSex nanostructures have been used as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution at the biphasic systems of water and 1,2-dichloroethane with similar to a biomembrane. The catalytic activity differences of ternary metal selenides have been compared with each other taking into account transition metals which are changed in the order of Fe approximate to Mn << Co < Ni. The catalytic activities of the MWSex have not been changed when adding of Fe and Mn into the tungsten selenide nanostructure, which may be originated from amorphous structures of FeWSex and MnWSex. Ni and Co addition into the tungsten selenide have improved the electrocatalytic HER activity when compared with only WSex. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the critical role of H2O in promoting solution mechanism still lacks persuasive spectroscopic evidence, moreover, the origin of low polarization remains incompletely understood. Herein, by in situ spectroscopic identification of reaction intermediates, we directly verify that H2O additive is able to alter oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway subjected to solution-mediated growth mechanism of Li2O2. In addition, ingress of H2O also induces to form partial LiOH, resulting in reduced charging polarization due to its higher conductivity; however, LiOH could not contribute to O-2 evolution upon recharge. These original results unveil the complex effects of H2O on cycling the aprotic Li-O-2 batteries, which are instructive for the mechanism study of aprotic Li-O-2 batteries with protic additives or soluble catalysts.									37	3	0	0	1	0	37			1948-7185			WOS:000436382400027	29792436

The caterpillar-like NiCo precursor arrays are first in situ grown on carbon cloth (NiCo2O4/CC) by a facile hydrothermal reaction, which is followed by an anion exchange process (or sulfuration treatment) with Na2S to form self-supporting spinel NiCo2S4 arrays (NiCo2S4/CC) with a roughened nanostructure. Taking advantage of the bimetallic synergistic effect, the unique hierarchical nanostructure, and the self-supporting nature, the resultant NiCo2S4/CC electrode exhibits high activities toward the OER, HER and UOR, which are highly superior to the monometallic counterparts of NiS nanosheets and Co9S8 nanowires on a carbon cloth substrate. The comparison of the three electrodes also indicates that the hierarchically structured bimetallic electrode combines the morphological and structural characteristics of monometallic Ni-based nanosheets and Co-based nanowires. When assembling a two-electrode electrolytic cell with NiCo2S4/CC as both the anode and cathode, an applied cell voltage of only 1.66 V is required to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in water electrolysis. By using the same two-electrode setup, the applied voltage for urea electrolysis is further reduced to 1.45 V that produces hydrogen at the cathode with the same current density. This study paves the way for exploring the feasibility of future less energy-intensive and large-scale hydrogen production.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000612999200021	33448268

The electrocatalytic activity of the obtained composites in the oxygen evolution reaction and oxidation of chloramphenicol was investigated. It was found that the Tafel slope significantly exceeds the theoretical value, which indicates a decrease in the degree of filling of the electrode surface with oxygen-containing particles. In the presence of organic compound and chloride ions in the solution, irreversible adsorption of the intermediate is observed, which leads to additional blocking of active centers on the oxide surface, which are involved in the oxidation of organic substance. It was established that the maximum rate of chloramphenicol conversion is 83.5% and 85% at 50 and 80 mA cm(-2), respectively, under kinetic control. The heterogeneous oxidation rate constant of chloramphenicol is 0.0035 min(-1). Oxidation of chloramphenicol occurs through the formation of 4-(-2-amino-1,3-dihydroxy-propanyl)-nitrobenzene with cleavage of dichloroacetic acid. Next, the amino group is oxidized to the nitro group to form 4-(2-nitro-1,3-dihydroxy-propanyl)-nitrobenzene. Subsequent electrolysis produces nitrobenzoic acid, which is oxidized to benzoic acid, later hydroquinone, then benzoquinone and a set of aliphatic compounds. Practitioner Points The PbO2-2 wt.% SDS composite consists of 93.1% of alpha phase of PbO2 in contrast to those synthesized from nitrate electrolyte. The Tafel slope indicates a decrease of surface filling with oxygen-containing particles. Irreversible adsorption of the intermediate is observed in the presence of chloride ions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1061-4303	1554-7531		WOS:000693082300001	34415641

The novel nanoarchitecture of MoS2-GO nanocomposites acts as an electrocatalyst in multifunctional electrochemical performance. The distribution and morphological studies for MoS2-GO nanocomposites were analyzed via X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Modified graphite felt (MGF) electrodes were developed using a spray-coating process to uniformly distribute MoS2-GO nanocomposites on graphite felt. The 1 mg cm(-2) MGF electrode showed the best electrochemical activity and electrochemical reversibility toward the redox couples of the iron(II) electrolyte, as indicated in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and Tafel plots; this may be due to the presence of sulfur and oxygen heteroatom layers of the MoS2-GO nanocomposites, which are more actively participated in the charge transfer redox reactions of the iron(II) electrolyte. Iron redox flow battery performance with an active area of 132 cm(2) was found to be 99.95% of coulombic efficiency (eta(c)), with a corresponding peak power density of 75.60 mW cm(-2). Furthermore, in 1.0 M KOH, MoS2-GO nanocomposites demonstrate effective electrocatalysis for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The complete catalytic impact of MoS2-GO nanocomposites toward the OER was investigated. The MoS2-GO nanocomposites show an overpotential of 1.49 V (recorded at. of 10) and a Tafel slope of 381 mV dec(-1) and remain stable after 20 h of chronoamperometry in 1.0 M KOH. The OER activity of MoS2-GO nanocomposites was found to be significantly higher than that of the bare screen-printed electrode and MoS2.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000648878900100

Here, oxygen-terminated lightly boron-doped diamond (BDDL) thin films were synthesized as a semiconductor electron source to accelerate CO2 reduction. However, BDDL alone could not stabilize the intermediates of CO2 reduction, yielding a negligible amount of reduction products. Silver nanoparticles were then deposited on BDDL because of their selective electrochemical CO2 reduction ability. Excellent selectivity (estimated CO: H-2 mass ratio of 318: 1) and recyclability (stable for five cycles of 3 h each) for photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction were obtained for the optimum silver nanoparticle-modified BDDL electrode at -1.1 V vs. RHE under 222-nm irradiation. The high efficiency and stability of this catalyst are ascribed to the in situ photoactivation of the BDDL surface during the photoelectrochemical reaction. The present work reveals the potential of BDDL as a high-energy electron source for use with co-catalysts in photochemical conversion.									37	1	0	0	6	0	38			2045-2322			WOS:000388569600001	27892544

Plenty of hydrogen bubbles were in situ formed via the oxidation and hydrolysis of the reductant (sodium borohydride), which served as the dynamic template in the fabrication of the porous sponge-like structures. The shape, size, crystal structure, and composition of the products were characterized by a set of characterization techniques. The obtained Pt53Ru39Ni8 nanosponges displayed dramatically highly electrocatalytic performances for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HOR) outperformed home-made PtNi nanoparticles (PtNi NPs), RuNi NPs and commercial PtRu black (50 wt.%).

Herein, we report a versatile molecular-confining route to construct strongly coupled metal oxides-N-C frameworks with interconnected configuration. By simply chelating various transition metal ions with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA) in agarose hydrogel and subsequent carbonization, the high specific surface area porous N-C frameworks with strongly coupled metal oxides (e.g., manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel and their mixed oxides) can be prepared as advanced nonprecious water splitting electrocatalysts. For instance, the resulting Co3O4-N-C frameworks with the high surface area of 153m(2) g(-1), and the moderate nitrogen content of 1.23%, require an overpotential of 324 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1M KOH for OER, superior to commercial RuO2 catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the strong coupling between N-C and Co3O4 tunes the local electronic structure of Co for high-valence active sites and assures optimal adsorption energies of OER intermediates. Moreover, Co2P-N-C electrocatalysts derived from Co3O4-N-C also exhibit excellent HER performance under 1.0M KOH with a low overpotential of 139 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1) and impressive stability, underscoring the versatility of our synthetic strategy.									52	2	0	0	3	0	52			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000432604600070

It was shown that the sintering of the layers on ZrO2 at temperatures of 1423 and 1573 K is attended by chemical interaction with the electrolyte. The part of La0.7Sr0.3CoO3-delta which reacts decreases with decreasing sintering temperature. At P(O2) between 10.1 and 0.293 Pa the interaction of oxygen with the electrode and the influence of nonstoichiometry on the resistance along the electrode surface are uniquely determined by the La0.7Sr0.3CoO3-delta. The rates of anodic oxygen evolution and of oxygen electroreduction at phi = const, as well as the exchange currents, were obtained as functions of P(O2). The results were explained by suggesting that the transfer of oxygen ions from the electrolyte into the La0.7Sr0.3CoO3-delta is the rate-determining step of the electrode reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0038-5387			WOS:A1990FR69600011

The integral procedure decomposition temperature (IPDT) increased significantly, and the activation energy increased by a certain factor, indicating a slow degradation pathway involving dehydration, rearrangement, formation of carbonyl groups, evolution of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and formation of a carbonaceous residue for the flame retardancy of Lyocell fibers.

J	Stanev, Ye.V.; Trukhchev, D.I.								A numerical model of the distribution of oxygen and hydrogen sulfide in the Black Sea								Oceanology				28	3			300	4						1988	1988	The effect of the dynamics of the Black Sea on the distributions of oxygen and hydrogen sulfide is studied. The calculations were made both for the entire Black Sea basin and, in greater detail, for a single area in the western part of the basin in the presence of synoptic eddy structures. The Bryan model and Sarkisyan's semidiagnostic model are used to calculate the current speeds. The model is a two-component model with regard to hydrochemical processes and includes the concentrations of oxygen and hydrogen sulfide. The interaction is described in terms of second-order reactions. The results of the numerical experiments agree with the actual distributions of oxygen and hydrogen sulfide and the actual location of the redox zone in the Black Sea. Advective and convective processes are of primary importance in the evolution of spatial inhomogeneities of oxygen and hydrogen sulfide.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0001-4370			INSPEC:3511271

Here, we demonstrate that a nanoporous morphology (specific surface area of 31.8 square meters per gram) effectively suppresses bulk carrier recombination without additional doping, manifesting an electron-hole separation yield of 0.90 at 1.23 volts (V) versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). We enhanced the propensity for surface-reaching holes to instigate water-splitting chemistry by serially applying two different oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) layers, FeOOH and NiOOH, which reduces interface recombination at the BiVO4/OEC junction while creating a more favorable Helmholtz layer potential drop at the OEC/electrolyte junction. The resulting BiVO4/FeOOH/NiOOH photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 2.73 milliamps per square centimenter at a potential as low as 0.6 V versus RHE.									2088	87	0	0	156	1	2113			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000332309600037	24526312

Hydrogen production by electrolysis of water is a highly efficient and feasible method. Besides, the by-product oxygen also has a high economic value. However, the slow kinetics leads to a higher than the theoretical voltage for water decomposition and requires additional energy. To deal with this problem, there is an urgent need to develop electrocatalysts for low consumption, high efficiency, and stable electrolytic water reactions. In recent years, non-precious metal nickel-based phosphide electrocatalysts have attracted a lot of attention. In this paper, three aspects of nickel-based monometallic phosphides, bimetallic phosphides, and polymetallic phosphides are reviewed. Finally, the current status, problems, and future directions of research on nickel-based phosphide electrocatalysts that do not contain precious metals are discussed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1793-6047	1793-7213		WOS:000715383000007

Phosphorus is the long-term(12) limiting nutrient for oxygen production via burial of organic carbon(13), and its retention (relative to carbon) within organic matter in marine sediments is enhanced by bioturbation(14-18). Here we explore the biogeochemical implications of a bioturbation-induced organic phosphorus sink in a simple model. We show that increased bioturbation robustly triggers a net decrease in the size of the global oxygen reservoir-the magnitude of which is contingent upon the prescribed difference in carbon to phosphorus ratios between bioturbated and laminated sediments. Bioturbation also reduces steady-state marine phosphate levels, but this effect is offset by the decline in iron-adsorbed phosphate burial that results from a decrease in oxygen concentrations. The introduction of oxygen-sensitive bioturbation to dynamical model runs is suffcient to trigger a negative feedback loop: the intensity of bioturbation is limited by the oxygen decrease it initially causes. The onset of this feedback is consistent with redox variations observed during the early Cambrian rise of bioturbation, leading us to suggest that bioturbation helped to regulate early oxygen and phosphorus cycles.									88	7	1	0	45	0	95			1752-0894	1752-0908		WOS:000341635600017

The SNG flakes are tightly immobilized on the GF surface, which can provide fast electron transfer rate and large electrolyte/electrode interfaces. The SNG@GF composite can be directly used as a free-standing electrode for electrocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants and overall water splitting. SNG@GF significantly enhanced the electrochemical activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for catalytic oxidation. During the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the SNG@GF exhibits an initial overpotential of 330 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 149 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, which outperforms most of the reported metal-free catalysts.

Two carbon catalysts, with the same chemical nature but different nitrogen content, are employed in this investigation. Electrochemical methods are applied to investigate the electrochemical behavior at different pH values (1.0-2.0,12.0-13.0). It is found that increasing nitrogen content has a positive effect on the electrocatalytic activity, and therefore, the doped nitrogen atoms should be the active sites. The kinetic current, normalized by the surface nitrogen content, is found to be the same for the two catalysts, confirming the above claim. As such, HER is proposed to proceed on these active sites by the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. The electrochemical tests reveal that the electrocatalytic activity closely relies on the solution pH, which is due to the chemical evolution of the active site in different solutions. In acid media, the electrocatalytic activity increases with the concentration of proton, and the Tafel slope is ca. 120 mV dec(-1). It is proposed that the electrochemical desorption of proton on the doped nitrogen atoms is the rate determining step (r.d.s.). In alkaline media, the electrocatalytic activity increases with pH, because the increase in pH dramatically enhances the basicity or the surface charge density, thereby facilitating charge transfer and improving activity. In alkaline media, Tafel analysis shows that Heyrovsky step is the rate determining. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									55	0	0	0	1	0	55			0021-9517	1090-2694		WOS:000400218500015

Compared to the metal free CN, the immobilization of Mn oxide enhances not only the electrocatalytic activity but also the selectivity towards the 4e- reduction reaction of O-2 to H2O. The XPS analysis reveals the interaction of the pyridine N species with Mn3O4 nanoparticles being particularly beneficial. This interaction is realized-although to a limited extent-when preparing the catalysts via impregnation; via the oleic acid route it is not observed. Whilst this work shows the potential of these systems to catalyze the ORR, the main limiting factor is still the poor conductivity of the support which leads to overpotential.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5				2073-4344		WOS:000593515100001

Botha, Louise/0000-0002-1249-2706			Catalytic dissociation of a water molecule on the (111) surfaces of Pt0.5Ni0.5 bimetal: Density functional theory (DFT) study								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				602						154238	10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.154238				NOV 15 2022	2022	One of the biggest challenges for the transition towards renewable energy sources today is the development of affordable platinum (Pt) containing bifunctional bimetals as electrode materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Recently, the optimal ratio of a bimetal consisting of Pt and nickel (Ni) was studied. This study included the impact of bimetal mixing on the electronic and magnetic properties of the bimetal. However, the catalytic properties of the bimetal have not been studied and compared to that of the pure metals. In this study, spin-polarized density functional theory calculations were employed to investigate the surface properties of Pt0.5Ni0.5 bimetallic surfaces. Relaxation of the surface terminations showed that the (1.5)(1 1 1) and (0.5)(1 1 1) surface terminations are energetically the most favourable surfaces, while the (2.0)(111) surface termination is energetically the least favourable surface. However, the (2.0)(1 1 1) surface termination is energetically more favourable than pure Ni. The adsorption of single water (H2O) molecule onto various (1 1 1) surface terminations (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0) of the bimetallic surfaces was investigated. The H2O molecule was adsorbed onto the atop site in the most stable orientation, namely parallel to the surface (a flat geometry). The d-band centre revealed that the bonding of the H2O molecule on the (0.5)(111) surface termination is stronger than on the pure Pt surface but weaker than on the pure Ni surface. Bond elongation of the OH bonds and an increase in the HOH bond angle were observed in the H2O molecule adsorbed on the (0.5)(111) surface. The results show that the (1.5)(111) surface termination, where the water adsorbs to a Ni atom, could potentially be used as an electrocatalyst for the water-splitting reaction. However, experimental data are needed to confirm these results.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000848218400005

A major physiological response to environmental change is cellular stress, which is counteracted by generic stress reactions detoxifying the cell. A model, stress-induced evolutionary innovation (SIEI), whereby ancestral stress reactions and their corresponding pathways can be transformed into novel structural components of body plans, such as new cell types, is described. Previous findings suggest that the cell differentiation cascade of a cell type critical to pregnancy in humans, the decidual stromal cell, evolved from a cellular stress reaction. It is hypothesized that the stress reaction in these cells was elicited ancestrally via inflammation caused by embryo attachment. The present study proposes that SIEI is a distinct form of plasticity-based evolutionary change leading to the origin of novel structures rather than adaptive transformation of pre-existing characters.									30	0	0	0	23	0	30			0265-9247	1521-1878		WOS:000462663800008	30919472	
J	Ivleva, NB; Shestakov, SV; Pakrasi, HB								The carboxyl-terminal extension of the precursor D1 protein of photosystem II is required for optimal photosynthetic performance of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp PCC 6803								PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				124	3			1403	1411		10.1104/pp.124.3.1403				NOV 2000	2000	The D1 protein is an integral component of the photosystem II reaction center complex. In the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, D1 is synthesized with a short 16-amino acids-long carboxyl-terminal extension. Removal of this extension is necessary to form active oxygen-evolving photosystem II centers. Our earlier studies have shown that this extension is cleaved by CtpA, a specific carboxyl-terminal processing protease. The amino acid sequence of the carboxyl-terminal extension is conserved among D1 proteins from different organisms, although at a level lower than that of the mature protein. In the present study we have analyzed a mutant strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 with a duplicated extension, and a second mutant that lacks the extension, to investigate the effects of these alterations on the function of the D1 protein in vivo. No significant difference in the growth rates, photosynthetic pigment composition, fluorescence induction, and oxygen evolution rates was observed between the mutants and the control strain. However, using long-term mixed culture growth analysis, we detected significant decreases in the fitness of these mutant strains. The presented data demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal extension of the precursor D1 protein is required for optimal photosynthetic performance.									33	2	0	0	32	0	35			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000165365800047	11080315

NiN4 center is found to be more stable in zigzag-edge and armchair-edge proximity of graphene, confirming experimental evidence. In an attempt to reduce the CO2 reduction overpotential, we construct a neighboring-site environment of NiN4 center and BN substitutional defect. B-doped structures are found to be capable of reducing the CO2 reduction energy barrier through direct (HCOOH pathway) or indirect (CO pathway) participation in facilitating CO2 reduction-related key intermediates. In most Ni sites, the presence of adjacent BN site is also discovered to change the product selectivity from CO to HCOOH. Our result predicts that B-doped NiN4 sites on the interior side (NiN4BN-G) and on the armchair-edge side of tilted orientation (t-NiN4BN-AGNR) are HCOOH-selective. Although the rest of zigzag-edge and armchair-edge sites have a tendency to selectively produce CO and HCOOH, respectively, the undesirable hydrogen evolution reaction is found to be more dominant and therefore obscuring the potential. Our result demonstrates that the hydrogen evolution reaction is most likely to occur on top of a neighboring C atom instead of on the Ni center, in contrast to the commonly understood mechanism. To ultimately suppress the activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction, we predict that an effective electrocatalyst optimization cannot be realized by only selecting the best metal center and dopant pair but also by altering the neighbor's electronic structure.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000696175400021

Moreover, the electrolysis of ammonia to produce nitrogen and hydrogen only requires an external voltage of 0.06 V theoretically, which is much lower than the energy needed for water electrolysis (1.23 V). In this study, we propose a well-established procedure using in operando gas chromatography that enables us to reliably compare and evaluate the new catalyst for ammonia oxidation. With the protocol, we could distinguish in detail the competitive oxidation reaction between the ammonia oxidation and oxygen evolution reactions with real-time monitoring. Using a flower-like electrodeposited Pt catalyst, we have efficiently produced hydrogen with less power consumption of 734 L<INF>H<INF>2</INF></INF> kW h<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is significantly lower than that of the water-splitting process (242 L<INF>H<INF>2</INF></INF> kW h<SUP>-1</SUP>). The use of this rigorous protocol should help to evaluate the practical performances for ammonia oxidation, thus enabling the field to focus on viable pathways towards the practical electrochemical oxidation of ammonia to hydrogen.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000639832400001

The fluorinated copper-manganese oxide (FCMO) is synthesized in an aqueous medium through a simple way using a hot plate and a fume hood. The FCMO catalyst is relatively inexpensive compared to Pt-, Ru-, and Ir-based catalysts, less hazardous than a Co-based catalyst, and at the same time, comparable with an Fe-Ni-based catalyst that has stable performance only in a basic medium. The FCMO is used in combination with carbon black as FCMO-carbon black by dispersing FCMO over carbon black to improve the electron transport efficiency. The FCMO catalyst and FCMO-carbon black show oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in both acidic and basic media with an impressive property of larger pH window stability with bifunctional performance. The ORR was found to be a two-electron process on both catalytic systems in both acidic and alkaline media. The FCMO-carbon black showed ORR (0.43 V) and OER (1.51 V) versus RHE in 0.5 M H2SO4. The onset potential of FCMO-carbon black was found to be an impressive 0.94 V versus RHE for the ORR and a relatively competitive OER of 1.54 V versus RHE in 0.1 M KOH. The FCMO-carbon black catalyst was also deposited on a conducting carbon cloth and used as an air cathode in a hybrid Li-air cell with 1.0 M LiOH as the electrolyte. The cell showed a stable cycling performance at room temperature for more than 80 h under a cycling current density of 0.08 mA cm(-2).									24	1	0	0	0	0	24			2574-0962			WOS:000576676900138

This relies on the fact of uncertainty concerning which structure acts as the real mutagen. Challenging the current accepted idea of a direct tautomeric process transforming the furanone ring to the oxobutenoic acid chain structure, a water-assisted process via a six-membered transition structure (TS) is revealed to proceed with activation energy of 24.5kcal/mol (i.e., 26.8kcal/mol lower than the conventional tautomeric process). An analysis based on the application of catastrophe theory to the evolution of the electron localization function topology along the intrinsic reaction coordinate reveals that the process can be explained, using a Lewis-like chemical language, as a result of the electronic activation of the furanone specie by the water molecule: on the activation pathway (i.e., before TS is reached), the electronic perturbation introduced by the water reagent is first observed on the valence shell of the ring oxygen and then on that of the hydroxylic one. Thereafter, the release of the hydroxylic hydrogen and the breaking of the C-O bond in the furanone ring follow the electronic rearrangement. On the de-activation pathway, the water molecule first captures the hydroxylic proton. Then, a hydronium-like structure transfers a proton to the oxygen of the furanone moiety contributing to stabilize the open ring structure. The above description of such a favorable ring-opening process become thus associated with nine topological structural stability domains, featuring the following sequence of catastrophes: C5H3O3Cl3+H2O: 10-(CF dagger)-F-dagger[FU]UC[(CC dagger)-C-dagger]CC-0: C5H3O3Cl3+H2O.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1432-881X	1432-2234		WOS:000451479500001

Here, free-standing, hetero-structured Ni3N-Ni0.2Mo0.8N nanowire arrays are prepared on carbon cloth (CC) electrodes for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) to formate with a remarkably high Faradaic efficiency of 96%. A two-electrode electrolyzer for GOR-assisted hydrogen production operates with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an applied cell voltage of 1.40 V, 220 mV lower than for alkaline water splitting. In-situ Raman measurements identify Ni (III) as the active form of the catalyst for GOR rather than Ni (IV) and in-situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements reveal pathways for GOR to formate. From density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the Ni3N-Ni0.2Mo0.8N heterostructure is beneficial for optimizing adsorption energies of reagents and intermediates and for promoting HER and GOR activities by charge redistribution across the heterointerface. The same electrode also catalyzes conversion of ethylene glycol from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic hydrolysate into formate. The combined results show that electrolytic H-2 and formate production from alkaline glycerol and ethylene glycol solutions provide a promising strategy as a cost-effective energy supply.

The phase transformation and structure evolution (e.g., atom site occupancy, crystallite size, and cell volume) of the CoNi-S-T@NCFs electrocatalysts, as a function of sulfurization temperatures, were confirmed by X-ray diffraction and Rietveld analyses. The sulfur vacancies effectively enhance the electrocatalytic activity, while the synergistic effect of (Co,Ni)(7)S-8 alloy and S, N-codoped carbon matrix facilitates the electron transfer and accelerates reaction kinetics, making CoNi-S-900@NCFs an efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The rich high-valence Co (III) and Ni (III) of CoNi-S-900@NCFs facilitates the in-situ transformation of the metal (oxy) hydroxides intermediates with high catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Thus, with a bifunctional parameter, delta E, of 0.75 V (E-j=10,E- OER -E-1/2,E- ORR), this electrocatalyst slightly outperforms the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C + RuO2/C catalyst (delta E = 0.76 V) in alkaline medium. This work demonstrates the influence that the sulfurization temperature has on the relationship between the structure and electrocatalytic performance of bimetallic sulfides prepared by the synthesis strategy using the intercalated LDH precursor. This strategy can be extended to prepare other chalcogenides with binary or ternary transition metals. (c) 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

They are microscopic materials that range in size from 1 to 100 nanometers. They may be distinguished from bulk materials by their size, shape, increased surface-to-volume ratio, and unique physical and chemical characteristics. Carbon nanocomposite matrixes are often created by combining more than two distinct solid phase types. The nanocomposites that were constructed exhibit unique properties, such as significantly enhanced toughness, mechanical strength, and thermal/electrochemical conductivity. As a result of these advantages, nanocomposites have been used in a variety of applications, including catalysts, electrochemical sensors, biosensors, and energy storage devices, among others. This study focuses on the usage of several forms of carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon aerogels, carbon nanofibers, graphene, carbon nanotubes, and fullerenes, in the development of hydrogen fuel cells. These fuel cells have been successfully employed in numerous commercial sectors in recent years, notably in the car industry, due to their cost-effectiveness, eco-friendliness, and long-cyclic durability. Further; we discuss the principles, reaction mechanisms, and cyclic stability of the fuel cells and also new strategies and future challenges related to the development of viable fuel cells.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				1420-3049		WOS:000777687800001	35164025	
J	Brand, Uwe; Davis, Alyssa M.; Shaver, Kristen K.; Blamey, Nigel J. F.; Heizler, Matt; Lecuyer, Christophe								Atmospheric oxygen of the Paleozoic								EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS				216						103560	10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.103560		MAR 2021		MAY 2021	2021	The evolution of Earth?s atmosphere is of extreme importance to the lithosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere. This is particularly true for the role the biosphere played in the inceptual formation of atmospheric oxygen, and subsequently in its potential role in the evolution of higher life forms. Quantifying the change in atmospheric oxygen with geologic time is extremely challenging, with the redox sensitive isotope and element models subject to contradictory outcomes. Here, we present a new approach in determining past atmospheres, by a) directly measuring (DM) the amount of atmospheric oxygen trapped in fluid-gas inclusions of primary and unaltered halite, and by b) using a back-calculation method (BCM) applied to trapped halite fluid inclusion gas contents subjected to post-depositional biogeochemical reactions to calculate the amount of atmospheric oxygen. On average (?standard error), atmospheric oxygen content during the latest Ediacaran was 17.4 ? 2.1% compiled from DM of 17.4 ? 1.3% and from BCM of 17.3 ? 2.9%. For the earliest Cambrian average oxygen was 19.3 ? 1.4% compiled from DM of 18.8 ? 1.5% and from BCM of 19.8 ? 1.3%. The oxygen content during the mid and late Ordovician was relatively invariant with 15.6 ? 1.8% [15.4 ? 1.4% (DM), 15.8 ? 2.2% (BCM)], and 16.2 ? 1.2% [15.7 ? 1.7% (DM), 16.6 ? 0.7% (BCM)], respectively. The relatively stable atmospheric oxygen levels continued into the Silurian of 15.9 ? 1.1% (12.9 ? 0.4 to 16.5%, DM; 14.3 ? 1.7 to 19.8 ? 2.1% BCM) except for a peak to about present levels during the late Silurian of 23.2 ? 1.9% (21.6% DM, 24.7 ? 3.7% BCM). Early Carboniferous atmospheric oxygen returned to relatively lower and invariant levels at about 15.3 ? 0.7 to 15.7 ? 1.0% (15.0%, 15.5 ? 0.1% DM, 9.4 ? 3.9 to 15.8 ? 1.9% BCM). Similarly, the average atmospheric oxygen content in fluid inclusion of halites from the late Permian was similar with 15.7 ? 1.3% with 16.9% (DM) to 14.5 ? 2.6% (BCM). Indeed, our study suggests that atmospheric oxygen was relatively constant for most of the Paleozoic at about 16.5% (?0.6 SE, ?2.2 SD). This puts our proxy result at odds with the values and trends suggested by the COPSE, GEOCARBSULF AND GEOCARBSULFOR models for the early Paleozoic atmospheric oxygen, and continues the discord with the GEOCARBSULF and GEOCARBULFOR models during the late Paleozoic.									9	1	0	0	3	0	10			0012-8252	1872-6828		WOS:000641463800001

Herein, zinc-mediated zeolitic imidazolate frameworks are exploited as the template and nitrogen and carbon sources, onto which is deposited a Fe3O4 layer by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition. Controlled pyrolysis at 1000 degrees C leads to the formation of high density of Fe3O4-x few-atom clusters with abundant oxygen vacancies deposited on an N-doped graphitic carbon framework. The resulting nanocomposite (Fe3O4-x/NC-1000) exhibits a markedly enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media, with a remarkable half-wave potential of +0.930 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, long-term stability, and strong tolerance against methanol poisoning, in comparison to samples prepared at other temperatures and even commercial Pt/C. Notably, with Fe3O4-x/NC-1000 as the cathode catalyst, a zinc-air battery delivers a high power density of 158 mW cm(-2) and excellent durability at 5 mA cm(-2 )with stable 2000 charge-discharge cycles over 600 h. This is ascribed to the ready accessibility of the Fe3O4-x catalytic active sites, and enhanced electrical conductivity, oxygen adsorption, and electron-transfer kinetics by surface oxygen vacancies. Further contributions may arise from the highly conductive and stable N-doped graphitic carbon frameworks.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-9608			WOS:000805092400001	35656764

The aerosol size distribution is key in determining its optical properties and cloud condensation nucleus activity. The dominant portion of organic aerosol is formed through gas-phase oxidation of volatile organic compounds, so-called secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). Typical experimental measurements of SOA formation include total SOA mass and atomic oxygen-to-carbon ratio. These measurements, alone, are generally insufficient to reveal the extent to which condensed-phase reactions occur in conjunction with the multigeneration gas-phase photooxidation. Combining laboratory chamber experiments and kinetic gas-particle modeling for the dodecane SOA system, here we show that the presence of particle-phase chemistry is reflected in the evolution of the SOA size distribution as well as its mass concentration. Particle-phase reactions are predicted to occur mainly at the particle surface, and the reaction products contribute more than half of the SOA mass. Chamber photooxidation with a midexperiment aldehyde injection confirms that heterogeneous reaction of aldehydes with organic hydroperoxides forming peroxyhemiacetals can lead to a large increase in SOA mass. Although experiments need to be conducted with other SOA precursor hydrocarbons, current results demonstrate coupling between particle-phase chemistry and size distribution dynamics in the formation of SOAs, thereby opening up an avenue for analysis of the SOA formation process.									120	2	0	0	32	0	120			0027-8424			WOS:000322086100032	23818634

The dissociation of N2O into adsorbed dinitrogen and oxygen can take place on Ar-pre-purged ZrO2. The adsorbed dinitrogen, which produces an IR band at 2360 cm(-1) as defected by in-situ DRIFT, can be easily removed from the surface by Ar-purge or heating to high temperatures. The adsorbed oxygen, which is identified by the IR band at 810 cm(-1), is strongly bonded to surface Zr ions and remain at the surface at high temperatures. TPR shows that the decomposition of N2O into N7 and O-2 over ZrO2 becomes significant only at temperatures higher than 750 K, especially after the evolution of dioxygen (the desorption of adsorbed oxygen). The mechanism of decomposition is discussed.									24	1	0	0	0	0	24			0169-4332			WOS:A1996VP75100011

For the oxygen concentration [O-2]> similar to 0.1%, the influence of oxygen on the electron characteristics and the power dissipation becomes important, e. g., the electron density, the electron temperature in sheath, the electron-coupling power, and the sheath width decreasing by 1.6 to 16 folds with a two-log increase in [O-2] from 0.1% to 10%. Also the discharge mode evolves from the gamma mode to the alpha mode. The reactive oxygen species are found to peak in the narrow range of [O-2] = 0.4%-0.9% in the plasmas, similar to their power-coupling values. This applies to their wall fluxes except for those of O* and O-2(-). These two species have very short lifetimes, thus only when generated in boundary layers within several micrometers next to the electrode can contribute to the fluxes. The dominant reactive oxygen species and the corresponding main reactions are schematically presented, and their relations are quantified for selected applications.

The obtained nanolayers were investigated by SEM, HRTEM, TEM, EDX, XRD, XPS and FTIR spectroscopy. They were stated to be formed by Ni:FeOOH 2D nanocrystals with lepidocrocite and goethite crystal structures having the morphology of nanosheets. They are 2-5 nm thick with planar dimensions of about 30-50 nm and the ratio of atomic concentrations of Ni to Fe is 25%. The nanolayers were shown to exhibit electrocatalytic properties during the oxygen evolution reaction upon water splitting in the alkaline medium. For the first time it was shown that the overpotential value can be precisely set by varying the number of SILD cycles these properties can be changed precisely. For a number of samples, synthesized after 20-80 SILD cycles, it was found for a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) the lowest overpotential value of 239 mV was obtained for the sample synthesized after 60 SILD cycles. The synthesis of a wide range of electrocatalytic nanolayers by SILD with the precise structural and chemical characteristics was suggested. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In especial, the large current density (larger than 1000 mA cm(-2)) is an important criterion for the evaluation of electrocatalysts for industrial application. Usually, the number of catalytic sites in electrocatalyst limits the current density for HER. To overcome these problems, bimetallic nitride is controllably synthesized, and the corresponding catalytic sites are regulated by a bimetallic effect. Herein, an inexpensive electrocatalyst consisting of N-doped carbon-coated porous Ni3Mo3N microrods (NC/Ni3Mo3N/NF) is cultured on nickel foam using a hydrothermal reaction and subsequent nitriding process. The designed electrocatalyst consisting of porous NC/Ni3Mo3N microrods displays efficient catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with a small overpotential of 136 mV to achieve a cathodic current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations clarified that the Ni3Mo3N electrocatalyst possesses various HER catalytic active sites with suitable GH* values (more than ten sites) due to the metallic semiconductor structure with special electronic structure. It is important that NC/Ni3Mo3N/NF possess perfect superstability for HER, with a large current density of 1100 mA cm(-2) for 50 h. Lastly, NC/Ni3Mo3N/NF and NiMoO4 center dot xH(2)O/NF are hired as the cathode and anode, respectively, to assemble the two-electrode electrolytic cell, thereby achieving excellent overall water splitting performance with a voltage of 1.58 V at 50 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH aqueous solution.									74	5	0	0	5	0	77			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000533148700037		
J	Chaudhary, Preeti; Ingole, Pravin Popinand								In-Situ solid-state synthesis of 2D/2D interface between Ni/NiO hexagonal nanosheets supported on g-C3N4 for enhanced photo-electrochemical water splitting								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				45	32			16060	16070		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.04.011				JUN 11 2020	2020	Herein, we report a synthesis of 2D/2D interfaces between nickel/nickel oxide (Ni/NiO) hexagonal nanosheets with graphitic-carbon nitride (g-C3N4) using an in-situ solid-state heat treatment that shows enhanced activity for electrochemical as well as photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The transmission electron microscopy characterization confirms the homogenous dispersion of 2D hexagonal nanosheets of Ni/NiO on the surface of g-C3N4. The higher electrochemical and PEC water splitting activity of 2D/2D interface may be due to the more intimate contact between 2D sheets of NiO with g-C3N4. Moreover, the effect of NiO loading in nanoheterostructures have been studied towards by varying the ratio of precursors for NiO to that of g-C3N4 viz. 1:1, splitting 1:8, and 1:16. A compositional ratio of 1:8 have been found to show the best PEC activity towards OER depicting a maximum photocurrent density of 20 mA cm(-2) at an over potential of 190 mV. Whereas, the highest ratio of NiO to g-C3N4 nanosheets (i.e. 1:1) was noted to demonstrate the best performance towards electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction showing dramatically reduced over potential of 26 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

Introducing cross-linking is an effective method to improve the property. In this study, Poly-(benzimidazole-terephthalamide) (PABI) fiber was synthesized and prepared by wet-spinning, followed by heat-treating at different conditions for formation of cross-linking. During the process, trace amount of oxygen was introduced and it was confirmed that oxygen had great influence on the cross-linking reaction. The finding was characterized in detail. It is found that cross-linking of PABI can take place upon 330 degrees C and cross-linking site is located in phenyl on benzimidazole moieties because of its higher electron density. Trace amount of oxygen can significantly catalyze the cross-linking reaction and make cross-linking degree improve. Compressive strength increases by over 50% and interfacial shear strength is improved by nearly 28% after cross-linking on the basis of maintaining excellent mechanical properties.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			1359-835X	1878-5840		WOS:000444659100023

Electrocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Physical characterization showed that all electrocatalysts are alloys in the form of agglomerated particles that consist of nanocrystals. To perform an electrocatalytic evaluation, polarization curves, Koutecky-Levich and Tafel plots were obtained to calculate the kinetic parameters. Additionally, the molar fraction of the generated HO2 (-) and the number of transferred electrons were determined. PtCo alloy showed a better performance for oxygen reduction reaction with a higher exchange current density, a lower overpotential, as well as higher specific and mass activities due to a synergistic effect between Pt and Co atoms as a result of the alloying process.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000360849500005

However, integrated the synergistic effect of carbon/oxygen defects and interfacial effects into spinel derivatives to dramatically improve the electrocatalytic property has not been studied up till now. Herein, a CoFe@Fe3N hybrid embedded into N-doped carbon nanotube has been prepared by heat-treatment of CoFe2O4 using a simple chemical vapor deposition method. Impressively, the as-prepared CoFe@Fe3N-CNT catalyst manifests a prominent stability and catalytic performance towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as demonstrated by an ultrahigh half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.936 V, which is the best ORR spinel-based catalysts. Furthermore, it was assembled into a rechargeable ZAB, which showed a high-power density of 173.6 mW cm-2 and an open circuit voltage of 1.534 V. The enhanced electrochemical performances are primarily due to the synergistic effect of carbon-oxygen double defects and interfacial electronic structure modulation.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663306500002

In this work, a self-templated carbonization strategy for synthesizing heterostructures of transition metal phosphide@nitrogen/phosphorus dual-doped carbon quasiaerogels (TMP@NPCA) is presented using a rationally designed precursor of a metallogel with Zn/M (M = Co, Fe, and Ni) bimetallic clusters (BMOG) and nitrogen/phosphorus chelate ligands. During the self-templated carbonization, the Zn ions among the BMOG boost a simultaneous catalytic carbonization and activation process of the resultant TMP@NPCA, whereas the M ions offer a versatile self-phosphating preparation of TMP nanoparticles (e.g., CoP, FeP, and Ni2P) within the TMP@NPCA. As a proof of concept, the TMP@NPCA catalysts deliver an excellent bifunctional catalytic activity and outstanding stability toward the oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, offering competitive advantages to achieve supreme bifunctional catalysis performance over the state-of-the-art TMP catalysts for renewable energy conversion systems.									70	1	0	0	4	0	70			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000477135400001

However, the commercial applications of these materials are hindered with drawbacks such as structural instability and poor cycling performance at high potentials. Herein, we comprehensively studied the oxygen redox reaction and the structural reversibility of LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 at deep delithiation using the synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations. The oxygen redox occurs due to the cation mixing upon delithiation in this material though there are no Li-O-Li configurations in its pristine form. The formation of the I41 structure was attributed to the migration of the transition metals in the deeply delithiated material, extending the route of the phase transformation from the layered to the rock-salt structure. These findings are helpful to enrich the understanding of the origin of the oxygen redox and reveal its impact on the structural transformations in the Nirich layered oxides. These will spur new strategies to enhance the performance of the cathode materials for the next-generation Li-ion batteries.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000804426800001

Oxygenic photosynthesis, the earth's major producer of both oxygen and organic matter, is a principal player in the development and maintenance of life, and thus results in increased order. The primary steps of oxygenic photosynthesis are driven by four multi-subunit membrane protein complexes: photosystem I, photosystem II, cytochrome b(6)f complex, and F-ATPase. Photosystem II generates the most positive redox potential found in nature and thus capable of extracting electrons from water. Photosystem I generates the most negative redox potential found in nature: thus, it largely determines the global amount of enthalpy in living systems. The recent structural determination of PSII and PSI complexes from cyanobacteria and plants sheds light on the evolutionary forces that shaped oxygenic photosynthesis. This newly available structural information complements knowledge gained from genomic and proteomic data, allowing for a more precise description of the scenario in which the evolution of life systems took place.

Herein, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 was used as the precursor for the construction of CoSe2 nanoparticles trapped in N-doped carbon (NC) polyhedra. Among as-obtained CoSe2-NC hybrid, highly active CoSe2 nanoparticles in sizes of 10-20 nm are encapsulated in N-doped few-layer carbon shell, avoiding their easy aggregations of CoSe2 nanoparticles as well as enhancing the long-term stability. The unique nanostructured CoSe2-NC hybrid with a hierarchical porosity and 3D conductive framework thus fully exerts outstanding bifunctional catalytic activity of CoSe2 centers. As a result, the CoSe2-NC hybrid as bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting delivers a high current density of 50 mA cm(-2) with an applied voltage of similar to 1.73 V in an alkaline electrolyte, with a promising stability over 50 000 s.									52	2	0	0	2	0	52			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000457067300092	30586290

In the research reported in this paper, the universal two-step method of co-precipitation and sulfuration is used to directly grow hierarchical nickel(II) hydroxide/trinickel disulfide [Ni(OH)(2)/Ni3S2] hybrid on nickel foam. The results show that the Ni(OH)(2)/Ni3S2-12h material used as the three-dimensional (3D) substrate electrode can maximize the synergy between the Ni(OH)(2) and Ni3S2, and it also exhibits high efficiency and persistent stability of the oxygen evolution reaction. The lower overpotential of only 270 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) compared to the benchmark of iridium(IV) oxide electrodes (300 mV of overpotential at 20 mA cm(-2)) benefited from the particular hybrid structure of Ni(OH)(2)/Ni3S2-12h with large voids and volume and rapid charge transfer. In addition, the Ni(OH)(2)/Ni3S2-12h material also shows a remarkable improved hydrogen evolution reaction activity compared to that of Ni(OH)(2), Ni(OH)(2)/Ni3S2-9h and Ni(OH)(2)/Ni3S2-15h individual catalysts, with which a low overpotential of only 211 mV is achieved at 20 mA cm(-2). Remarkably, Ni(OH)(2)/Ni3S2-12h is used as a bifunctional water splitting catalyst, with which an overpotential of similar to 340 mV is acquired at a very low cell voltage of 1.57 V with 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M potassium hydroxide. These results demonstrate that most hydroxide/sulfide-based materials can be used as a electrocatalyst candidate and provide a superior synergy strategy, which provides a new way for robust water splitting electrochemical fabrication of high-performance and inexpensive electrode materials.									169	3	0	0	3	0	170			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431003600024

In this work, micro-platinum modification strategy is developed to construct the bifunctional Pt@Co3O4/Ni foam (NF) hybrid electrode for overall water splitting. The resultant Pt@Co3O4/NF electrode exhibits low overpotentials and favorable kinetics for both hydrogen (30 mV@10 mA cm(-2), 31 mV dec(-1)) and oxygen evolution (263 mV@10 mA cm(-2), 69 mV dec(-1)). Moreover, a voltage of -1.53 V can drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the two-electrode electrolyzer. The enhanced performance of Pt@Co3O4/NF hybrid could be attributed to the synergistic effect of micro-Pt modified Co3O4 nanorod array with the optimized water cleavage and hydrogen recombination. This work not only reports an efficient hybrid electrode for overall water splitting but also offers valuable insights in designing multifunctional electrocatalysts for energy conversion technologies.									22	1	0	0	4	0	22			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000561585700003

This study investigates active sites and reaction mechanisms for CO2 electroreduction over metal N-doped flexible carbon materials using Phthalocyanine (Pc) and Iron Phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules as model catalysts. Both the FePc molecule and Pc molecule show catalytic activity for CO production and H2 evolution based on experimental results and DFT calculations. The presence of Fe atom results in a significantly higher activity for CO production and a little lower activity for H2 evolution. Calculated pKa and redox potentials (Ure) are introduced for the multi-step proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps of two competitive reactions. Specifically, a comparison between them is conducted to explain the competition between CO2 electroreduction and H2 evolution reaction with the support of energy diagram. The rate-determining steps for CO2 reduction and H2 evolution are also investigated. Both the CO and H2 formation on Pc molecule depend on electron transfer process. Besides, the Ure of two rate-determining steps are close, which is related to the closed Eonset for CO and H2 formation in the experiment. This study demonstrates that the mechanism for CO2 reduction from DFT calculation is in agreement with the experimental results. The technological approach and reaction mechanism can be applied to other types of CO2 electroreduction on carbon materials. Thus, this work provides a guidance in the rational design of the green catalyst and the implementation of carbon neutral.									3	1	0	0	1	0	4			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000675857600002

Here, in this work, we have demonstrated the suitability of CePO4:Sm3 thorn (CPOS) phosphor for white light luminophore and oxygen reduction catalyst. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the stabilization of monoclinic phase for CPOS. White light emission with correlated color temperature (CCT) favoring cool white feature in CPOS is endowed by inefficient host to dopant energy transfer (HDET). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggested presence of both Ce3 thorn and Ce4 thorn in CPOS with later in lower fraction. XPS results also showed the presence of surface oxygen in CPOS which along with mixed oxidation state of cerium on the surface may be aiding CPOS to work as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The best electrocatalytic performance was achieved with 1.0% Sm doped sample which has higher concentration of oxygen associated with Ce (IV) on the surface. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

However, how to introduce dual defects into nanomaterials by a simple way is still facing challenge. Herein, we propose a facile two-step solvothermal method to introduce Fe dopants and S vacancies into metal-organic framework-derived bimetallic nickel cobalt sulfide composites (NiCo-S). The as-prepared Fedoped NiCo-S (Fe-NiCo-S) possesses improved charge storage kinetics and activities as electrode material for supercapacitors and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The obtained Fe-NiCo-S nanosheet has a high specific capacitance (2779.6 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)) and excellent rate performance (1627.2 F g(-1) at 10 A g(-1)). A hybrid supercapacitor device made of Fe-NiCo-S as the positive electrode and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as the negative electrode presents a high energy density of 56.0 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 847.1 W kg(-1) and excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 96.5% after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g(-1)). Additionally, the Fe-NiCo-S composite modified by Fe doping and S vacancy has an ultralow oxygen evolution overpotential of 247 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculation, defects cause more electrons to appear near the Fermi level, which is conducive to electron transfer in electrochemical processes. Our work provides a rational strategy for facilely introducing dual defects into metal sulfides and may provide a novel idea to prepare electrode materials for energy storage and energy conversion application.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000709458200037	34605245

At present, a substantial part of the previous numerical study respecting the optimization design of the cathode catalyst layer (CCL) mainly focuses on the polarization curve output and oxygen local transport. In this paper, for the first time, a two-dimensional multiphase PEM fuel cell impedance model coupled with an improved electrochemical kinetics model considering the cathode agglomerate construction is proposed, which can reproduce the measured electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under different current densities, reactant stoichiometries and inlet humidity only with a single boundary set. Based on this, the effects of five CCL design parameters (Pt loading, carbon loading, catalyst layer thickness, ionomer volume fraction, and agglomerate radius) on the EIS and critical internal dynamics are comprehensively investigated. Meanwhile, each dynamics loss of simulated EIS is identified by the distribution of relaxation time and equivalent circuit model to support quantitative analysis. These works offer a deeper understanding and new insight into the effects of CCL parameters on PEM fuel cell internal dynamics, which can help material optimization and system controller design.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Oxygen not only hampers the sintering process but also proves to be detrimental to the ductility and corrosion resistance of the sintered sample. It is found that when the 316 L powder is doped with small amount of graphite (0, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 ppm), its oxygen content can be effectively reduced via the carbon-oxygen reaction during sintering. As the carbon dosage increases from 0 to 1500 ppm, the sintered density, elongation and pitting potential of the sintered samples are effectively improved due to the decreased oxygen contents in them. However, when 2000 ppm graphite is added, the sample becomes overdosed with carbon. The excessive carbon remains in the material and forms carbon-rich particles during sintering, which has significant adverse effects on the sintering process as well as the ductility and corrosion resistance of the sintered sample.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1526-6125	2212-4616		WOS:000513922000048

Photodamage of a Mn(III/IV)-oxo mixed-valence compound and photosystem II: Evidence that a high-valent manganese species is responsible for UV-induced photodamage of the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II								JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY				104	1-2	SI		118	125		10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2011.01.017				JUL-AUG 2011	2011	The Mn cluster in photosystem II (PS II) is believed to play an important role in the UV photoinhibition of green plants, but the mechanism is still not clear at a molecular level. In this work, the photochemical stability of [Mn-III(O)(2)Mn-IV(H2O)(2)(Terpy)(2)](NO3)(3) (Terpy = 2,2':6',2 ''-terpyridine), designated as Mn-oxo mixed-valence dimer, a well characterized functional model of the oxygen-evolving complex in PS II, was examined in aqueous solution by exposing the complex to excess light irradiation at six different wavelengths in the range of 250 to 700 nm. The photodamage of the Mn-oxo mixed-valence dimer was confirmed by the decrease of its oxygen-evolution activity measured in the presence of the chemical oxidant oxone. Ultraviolet light irradiation induced a new absorption peak at around 400-440 nm of the Mn-oxo mixed-valence dimer. Visible light did not have the same effect on the Mn-oxo mixed-valence dimer. We speculate that the spectral change may be caused by conversion of the Mn(III)O2Mn(IV) dimer into a new structure - Mn(IV)O2Mn(IV). In the processes, the appearance of a 514 nm fluorescence peak was observed in the solution and may be linked to the hydration or protonation of Terpy ligand in the Mn-oxo dimer. In comparing the response of the PS II functional model compound and the PS II complex to excess light radiation, our results support the idea that UV photoinhibition is triggered at the Mn4Ca center of the oxygen-evolution complex in PS II by forming a modified structure, possibly a Mn(IV) species, and that the reaction of Mn ions is likely the initial step.

Redox mediators (RMs) have been extensively investigated for reducing the overpotential of Li-O-2 batteries. However, most RMs have a limited effect on overpotential reduction and can only reach about 3.5 V. Herein, we report the use of a p-phenylenediamine oligomer (pPO) as an effective dual-functional RM to significantly reduce the charge potential to 3.1 V and to enhance the discharge capacity and rate capability. During the discharge process, pPO containing a benzoquinone group, is first reduced to pPOo(-), which adsorbs lithium ions and oxygen, and promotes the formation of lithium peroxide. During charging, pPO containing active N sites is preferentially oxidized to pPO(N)(+), which combines with lithium peroxide and promotes its decomposition. Similarly, we synthesized two other oligomers (mPO and oPO) that do not affect the overpotential due to differences in the molecular structure. Furthermore, pPO can also promote surface passivation of the lithium anode by forming a protective layer that allows facile cycling of the cells directly in air. The special molecular structure and functional groups determine the interaction between the RM and products. This study offers insights into designing bifunctional RMs to improve both the oxygen reduction and the oxygen evolution reaction activities in Li-O-2 batteries.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000589418400024

F. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 7836-7842]. This Ca2+-induced stability has been further characterized using the large reductant hydroquinone. Salt-washed photosystem II membranes reduced by hydroquinone in the presence of Ca2+ retain 80% of steady-state O2 evolution activity and contain about 2 Mn2+/reaction center that can be detected at room temperature by electron paramagnetic resonance. This Mn2+ produces a weak enhancement of H2O proton spin-lattice relaxation rates, cannot be easily extracted by a chelator, and is reincorporated into the O2-evolving complex upon illumination. A comparison of the properties of Ca2+-supplemented photosystem II samples reduced by hydroquinone or NH2OH alone or in sequence reveals the presence of a subpopulation of manganese atoms at the active site of H2O oxidation that is not accessible to facile hydroquinone reduction. At least one of these manganese atoms can be readily reduced by NH2OH following a noninhibitory hydroquinone reduction step. Under these conditions, about 3 Mn2+/reaction center are lost and O2 evolution activity is irreversibly inhibited. We interpret the existence of distinct sites of reductant action on manganese as further evidence that the Ca2+-binding site in photosystem II participates in regulation of the organization of manganese-binding ligands and the overall structure of the O2-evolving complex.									40	0	0	0	32	0	41			0006-2960			WOS:A1992JN25800009	1327103

The addition of alkaline phosphatase to the reaction medium enabled continuous photosynthesis by spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) chloroplasts to be sustained by hydrolysis of newly produced and exported triose phosphates and recycling of orthophosphate. In this system, simultaneous measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and oxygen evolution were performed and their dependence on orthophosphate concentration was investigated. Optimal photosynthesis was obtained at a much higher initial orthophosphate concentration (2-4 mM) compared to intact chloroplasts in suspension. Secondary kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence yield were observed and were shown to depend on the initial orthophosphate concentration.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:A1991FM45200012	24194077

In this work, for the first time, the synthesis of a sheet-like Zn1-xFex-oxyselenide and Zn1-xFex-LDH on Ni-foam is reported. The hydrothermally synthesized Zn1-xFex-LDH/Ni-foam is successfully converted into Zn1-xFex-oxyselenide/Ni-foam through an ethylene glycol-assisted solvothermal method. The anionic regulation of electrocatalysts modulates the electronic properties, and thereby augments the electrocatalytic activities. The as-prepared Zn1-xFex-LDH/Ni-foam shows very low OER and HER overpotentials of 263 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and 221 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Interestingly, this OER overpotential is decreased to 256 mV after selenization and the HER overpotential of Zn1-xFex-oxyselenide/Ni-foam is decreased from 238 to 202 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) after a stability test. Thus, the Zn1-xFex-oxyselenide/Ni-foam shows superior bifunctional catalytic activities and excellent durability at a very high current density of 50 mA cm(-2). More importantly, when the Zn1-xFex-oxyselenide/Ni-foam is used as the anode and cathode in an electrolyzer for overall water splitting, Zn1-xFex-oxyselenide/Ni-foam(+)& Zn1-xFex-oxyselenide/Ni-foam(-) shows an appealing potential of 1.62 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The anionic doping/substitution methodology is new and serves as an effective strategy to develop highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.									39	2	0	0	2	0	41			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000453859100019	30444578

Amorphous cobalt oxide films electrochemically formed in the presence of borate (CoBi) and phosphate (CoPi) share a common cobaltate domain building block, but differ significantly in OER performance that derives from different electron proton charge transport properties. Here, we use a combination of L edge synchrotron X-ray absorption (XAS), resonant X-ray emission (RXES), resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS), resonant Raman (RR) scattering, and high-energy X-ray pair distribution function (PDF) analyses that identify electronic and structural factors correlated to the charge transport differences for CoPi and CoBi. The analyses show that CoBi is composed primarily of cobalt in octahedral coordination, whereas CoPi contains approximately 17% tetrahedral Co(II), with the remainder in octahedral coordination. Oxygen-mediated 4p-3d hybridization through Co-O-Co bonding was detected by RXES and the intersite dd excitation was observed by RIXS in CoBi, but not in CoPi. RR shows that CoBi resembles a disordered layered LiCoO2-like structure, whereas CoPi is amorphous. Distinct domain models in the nanometer range for CoBi and CoPi have been proposed on the basis of the PDF analysis coupled to XAS data.

CURRENT OPINION IN ELECTROCHEMISTRY				33						100940	10.1016/j.coelec.2022.100940				JUN 2022	2022	Electrocatalysis is a promising technology for clean energy conversion. The prediction of activation energies is essential for reliably modeling electrocatalytic processes. Currently, a compromise is necessary between model complexity (electrochemical potential, electrode/electrolyte interface) and the accuracy of the resulting activation energies. We provide an overview on the approaches and recent advances in methods and models to identify transition states and activation energies in heterogeneous electrocatalysis, covering a large range of methods from model Hamiltonians to fully atomistic descriptions. We also discuss specific examples and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2451-9103			WOS:000819856600013

But the high overpotential, the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, and the poor cycling stability critically restrict their practical applications. To overcome these problems, various catalysts and electrolyte mediators have been used and studied. However, for practical application, these catalysts still have some challenges and scientific problems that need to be solved. Specifically, the performance of lithium-air batteries faces three major problems of capacity, overpotential, and cycle life that need to be solved. Solid-phase catalysts and liquid-phase redox mediators have their own advantages and disadvantages in the performance and reaction mechanism of lithium-air batteries. This review comprehensively analyzes and summarizes the catalytic materials and electrolyte additives of different systems and discusses in depth the corresponding reaction mechanism and performance (including technical characteristics and application difficulty). Finally, according to the characteristics of catalysts and practical application difficulties, the development direction of lithium-air batteries is proposed. Li-air batteries need to exploit the advantages of catalysts and redox mediators in terms of stability and overpotential to improve the electrochemical performance of the battery. In the future, anode protection and air purification systems will be combined to achieve large-scale, long-cycle applications of lithium-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000828742100001	35866683

The evolution of using oxygen for efficient energy production served as a driving force for the evolution of complex organisms. The redox reactions associated with its use were, however, responsible for the production of reactive species (derived from oxygen and lipids) with damaging effects due to oxidative chemical modifications of essential cellular components. Consequently, aerobic life required the emergence and selection of antioxidant defense systems. As a result, a high diversity in molecular and structural antioxidant defenses evolved. In the following paragraphs, we analyze the adaptation of biological membranes as a dynamic structural defense against reactive species evolved by animals. In particular, our goal is to describe the physiological mechanisms underlying the structural adaptation of cellular membranes to oxidative stress and to explain the meaning of this adaptive mechanism, and to review the state of the art about the link between membrane composition and longevity of animal species.									64	0	2	0	54	0	66			1664-042X			WOS:000346774000364	24381560

However, Pt/C and RuO2-based conventional rechargeable ZABs are mainly constrained by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER), limiting commercialization possibilities. Herein, a new type of oxygen vacancies enriched cobalt-doped molybdenum oxynitride quantum dot-anchored N-doped carbon nanosheets (V-O-CMON@NCNs) was demonstrated as an advanced air-cathode for long-life rechargeable ZABs. Such V-O-CMON@NCN catalyst has an exceptional ORR performance with a high half-wave potential of 0.857 V and tremendous OER performance with an ultrasmall overpotential of 240 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming conventional Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. As proof of concept, rechargeable ZABs with an optimal V-O-CMON@NCN-800 air-cathode showed an ultrahigh specific capacity of 721.2 mA h g(Zn)(-1) at a current density of 5 mA cm(-2), a tremendous peak power density of 143.7 mW cm(-2), and ultralong cycling life of 500 h. These consequences suggest that the oxygen vacancies enriched V-O-CMON@NCN can serve as promising bifunctional catalysts for next-generation metal-air batteries and other energy-related applications.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000631797300001

Single bubble measurements on the microwire electrode reveal a three-step growth process involving (1) the nucleation and formation of a supersaturated layer of dissolved gas followed by (2) a rapid growth phase depending on the gas diffusion process, and finally, (3) a stable growth phase where the growth rate is dominated by the bubble configuration depending on the contact angle. Moreover, correlation of multiple gas bubble observations with electrochemical data and surface coverage on the plate electrode reinforce the important role of wettability in determining bubble motion and energy consumption during electrolysis under microgravity.

J	Yang, Hongchao; Wang, Changhong; Zhang, Yejun; Wang, Qiangbin								Green synthesis of NiFe LDH/Ni foam at room temperature for highly efficient electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction								SCIENCE CHINA-MATERIALS				62	5			681	689		10.1007/s40843-018-9356-1				MAY 2019	2019	Clean energy technologies such as water splitting and fuel cells have been intensively pursued in the last decade for their free pollution. However, there is plenty of fossil energy consumed in the preparation of the catalysts, which results in a heavy pollution. Therefore, it is much desired but challenging to fabricate high-efficiency catalysts without extra energy input. Herein, we used a facile one-pot room-temperature method to synthesize a highly efficient electrocatalyst of nickel iron layered double hydroxide grown on Ni foam (NiFe LDH/NF) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The formation of the NiFe LDH follows a dissolution-precipitation process, in which the acid conditions by hydrolysis of Fe3+ combined with NO3- could etch the NF to form Ni2+. Then, the obtained Ni2+ was co-precipitated with the hydrolysed Fe3+ to in situ generate NiFe LDH on the NF. The NiFe LDH/NF exhibits excellent OER performance with a low potential of about 1.411 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 42.3 mV dec(-1) and a significantly low potential of similar to 1.452 V vs. RHE at 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 mol L-1 KOH. Moreover, the material also keeps its original morphology and structure over 20 h. This energy-efficient strategy to synthesize NiFe LDH is highly promising for widespread application in OER catalyst industry.									45	7	0	0	1	0	46			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000461366000008

In this work, we have designed and synthesized a series of metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived oxides pyrolyzed at different temperatures for efficient water oxidation in alkaline solutions. First, the barrel-shaped BMM-10 microcrystals can be conveniently synthesized under solvothermal conditions, and the hollow morphology of BMM-10-Fe with low crystallinity can be obtained through the fierce hydrolysis of Fe(III) ions. After being oxidized in air, there are only two typical phases of oxides including BMM-10-Fe-L and BMM-10-Fe-H. During electrolysis, BMM-10-Fe-L turns out to be immediately degraded into active Ni/FeOOH nanosheets with improved OER performance, while there is almost no structural and morphological change in BMM-10-Fe-H due to the structural rigidity and robust stability. Furthermore, the optimal BMM-10-Fe-H exhibits a promising electrocatalytic OER performance with a low Tafel slope of 137.4 mV dec(-1), a small overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and a high current retention of 93.8% after the stability test. The present work would motivate the scientific community to construct various MOF-derived nanomaterials for efficient energy storage and conversion applications.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000751884800081	34767333

The products were mainly investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The hierarchical architectures were formed by the oriented assembly growth and the diffusion-controlled deposition in the presence of many in-situ generated hydrogen bubbles. The architectures had the largest electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 84.32 m(2) g(-1) Pd than PdNi nanoparticles (NPs, 65.23 m(2) g(-1) Pd), PdRu NPs (23.12 m(2) g(-1) Pd), NiRu NPs (nearly zero), and commercial Pd black (6.01 m(2) g(-1) Pd), outperforming the referenced catalysts regarding the catalytic characters for hydrazine oxygen reaction (HOR).

Keys to the synthesis of the freestanding, laterally large 2D Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets from bulk Bi powder are choice of suspension medium, controlled reaction temperatures, and several hours processing time. Lateral sizes of 2D Bi2O2CO3 can be controlled between mu m-sized nanosheets and tens of nm sized nanoflakes solely based on the choice of suspension medium. The here introduced 2D Bi2O2CO3 nano-sheets/-flakes are then hybridized by a simple mix-and-match approach with TiO2 nanoparticles for testing in suspension-type photocatalytic hydrogen production via water splitting. This introduces the 2D Bi2O2CO3 as a prospective noble-metalfree catalyst component with TiO2 for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, beyond Bi2O2CO3's current use as photocatalyst for organic pollutant degradation. These results enrich the fabrication toolbox of emerging 2D pnictogen oxycarbonates toward large 2D nanosheets and demonstrate the potential of 2D Bi2O2CO3 as a catalyst component for hydrogen evolution in photocatalytic water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-7486			WOS:000846664900001

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is particularly promising in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as a substitute for noble-metal catalysts. Although numerous attempts have been made to improve the HER activity of MoS2, engineering the MoS2-based electrocatalysts with activities similar to noble-metal catalysts remains challenging. Herein, we synthesize high-quality tin doped molybdenum disulfide (Sn-MoS2) ultrathin nanosheets by a g-C3N4 sacrificial template assisted thermolytic approach, and detailly investigate the role of Sn doping on the HER activity. The porous SnMoS2 nanosheets displays superior HER performance, exhibiting an overpotential of 28 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 37.2 mV dec(-1) with an admirable stability. Compared to pristine MoS2 nanosheets, the significantly improved catalytic activity is ascribed to the increased active edge sites, enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity for each active site as well as accelerated electron transfer upon Sn doping. This work may provide guidelines for the design and synthesis of efficient non-precious HER catalysts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Electronic modulation via heteroatom doping is recognized as one of the most forceful leverages to enhance the electrocatalytic activity. Herein, we demonstrate a delicate strategy for the in-situ confinement of S-doped NiO nanoparticles into N-doped carbon nanotube/nanofiber-coupled hierarchical branched superstructures (labeled as S-NiO@N-C NT/NFs). The developed strategy simultaneously combines enhanced thermodynamics via electronic regulation with accelerated kinetics via nanoarchitectonics. The S-doping into NiO lattice and the 1D/1D-integrated hierarchical branched carbon substrate confer the resultant S-NiO@N-C NT/NFs with regulated electronic configuration, enriched oxygen vacancies, convenient mass diffusion pathways and superior architectural robustness. Thereby, the SNiO@N-C NT/NFs display outstanding OER properties with an overpotential of 277 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and impressive long-term durability in KOH medium. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further corroborate that introducing S-dopant significantly enhances the interaction with key oxygenate intermediates and narrow the band gap. More encouragingly, a rechargeable Zn-air battery using an air-cathode of Pt/C + S-NiO@N-C NT/NFs exhibits a lower charge voltage and preferable cycling stability in comparison with the commercial Pt/C + RuO2 counterpart. This study highlighting the concurrent consideration of electronic regulation, architectural design and nanocarbon hybridization may shed light on the future exploration of economical and efficient electrocatalysts.

As an effective method for hydrogen production, an efficient inexpensive multifunctional electrocatalyst with high durability is designed. Herein, we describe the heterostructural design of a three-dimensional catalytic network with self-embedded CoNi2S4 nanograins grown on electrospun carbon nanofibers (CoNi2S4-CNFs) with anchored thin-layer reduced graphene oxide. This is achieved via facile electrospinning followed by carbonization, low-temperature sulfidation, and surface functionalization. As a bifunctional catalyst, CoNi2S4-CNFs exhibited robust high activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium. The anchored ultrathin graphene oxide layer promoted the stability and durability of the catalytic network with an efficient path for the transportation of electrons. The rGO-anchored CoNi2S4-CNFs yielded overpotential values of 228 mV and 205 mV for the HER and OER, respectively, that drives a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium. Notably, the excellent electrochemical properties are attributed to the functional effect of the CoNi2S4 on the CNF network. The ultrathin feature of rGO improved the durability of the catalytic network. Moreover, using the rGO-anchored CoNi2S4-CNFs as a cathode and anode in a two-electrode water splitting system required a cell voltage of only 1.55 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). These CNFs exhibited outstanding durability for 48 h. The present work offers new insight for the design of a catalytic network with a non-noble metal catalyst that exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and durability on the metal sulfides in overall water splitting.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000532348300001	32182601

Free-base corrole was firstly reported as electrocatalyst for H-2 evolution. The results showed that free-base corrole was active in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in trifluoroacetic acid. And cobalt(III) corroles bearing hydroxyethyl amino groups were more efficient in HER as compared to their benchmark corroles. The catalytic active species of four tested cobalt(III) corroles were Co-II-H in acetic acid/dimethylformamide solvent. In water solution, both Co-III-H and Co-II-H may be involved in HER.

The m/z = 30 ion fragment with highest intensity among the fragments of nitrogen oxides might suggest parallel evolution of NO, anyhow, according to NIST reference spectra, m/z = 30 is also the most intense fragment of NO2 itself. The intense generation of oxygen resulted in parallel occurrence of m/z = 44 and 45 fragments indicating NO or rather CO, originated from reaction of nascent oxygen with the surrounding furnace. Whilst, the TG-FTIR spectroscopy showed evolution of NO, indicated by two PR bands positioned at 1616 and 2911 cm(-1), but no vibration bands of NO and N2O gases could be detected, at all. At greater initial loads, IR absorption bands of HNO3 vapour centred at 885, 1314, 1708, and 3566 cm(-1) have been observed. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Three-dimensional (3D) heteroatom-doped graphene-based materials have been reported to be efficient electrocatalysts for ORR in fuel cells for energy conversion. In this study, a novel cobalt-embedded nitrogen-doped graphene xerogel (denoted as Co-NGX) was prepared by a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The Co-NGX hybrid obtained at the pyrolysis temperature of 900 A degrees C (labeled as Co-NGX 900) was comparable to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst in terms of the onset potential and half-wave potential, indicating excellent ORR activity of our Co-NGX 900 catalyst. Additionally, the proposed Co-NGX 900 also displayed higher stability and better methanol tolerance than the commercial Pt/C, which might hold great promise as a Pt-free catalyst for application in alkaline direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs).An advanced and highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction activity catalyst was synthesized by embedding cobalt nanocrystals in nitrogen-doped graphene xerogel.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000392077600002

It reveals that the SW rich defects (e.g., pentagon (5), pentagon-octagon-pentagon (i.e. 585), or pentagon-heptagon-heptagon-pentagon (5775) rings, appears correspondingly with carbon rings that brought active sites during catalytic reactions. Moreover, we anchored dual isolated metallic atoms (Ni/Fe) on DG support via linkers (O/N) called NiFe-DG. X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates Ni/Fe metal single atoms are embedded via Fe-N-4 and Ni-N-4 coordination on DG surfaces. It exhibits high catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with an onset potential of 0.97 V, a half-wave potential of 0.86 V, and diffusion current density of 5.7 mA cm(-2), which is at par with commercial Pt/C. The catalyst shows superior stability, retained 82% of the initial current density even after 12 h under an applied potential of 0.86 V. Similarly, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 358 mV was achieved at 10 mA cm(-2) with a lower Tafel slope value (76 mV/dec) than commercial Pt/C. It maintains 85% stability for 12 h at a constant potential of 1.588 V, shows better stability than commercial Pt/C.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000709561000004

The structure and energetics of hydroxyls formed at the liquid water-Pt(111) interface are found to be significantly different from those of the hydroxyl formed on a bare Pt(111) surface and the hydroxyl formed on a Pt(111) surface with a static water layer. We identify 1/12 ML *OH, 5/12 ML *OH and 2/3 ML *OH as particularly stable hydroxyl coverages in highly dynamic liquid water environments, which - contrary to static water-hydroxyl models - contain adjacent uncovered Pt sites. Atomic surface oxygen is found to be unstable in the presence of liquid water, in contrast to static atomic level simulations. These results give an improved understanding of hydroxide and surface oxide formation from Pt(111) cyclic voltammetry and allow us to draw detailed connections between the electrostatic potential and the interface structure. The study of hydrogen adsorption at the liquid water-Pt(111) interface finds competitive adsorption between the adsorbed hydrogen atoms and water molecules. This does not adhere with experimental observations, and this indicates that the Pt(111) surface has to be negatively charged for a correct description of the liquid water-Pt(111) interface at potentials where hydrogen adsorption occurs.									55	1	1	0	3	0	56			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000444554100004	30288234

Here, latest progress in tuning intermetallic Pt- and Pd-based nanocrystals with tunable morphology and structure for catalyzing both the cathodic reduction of oxygen and anodic oxidation of fuels (e.g., methanol, ethanol and formic acid) in PEMFCs is highlighted. Making/tuning interesting intermetallic PtM (M = Fe, Co, Pb, Cu, etc.)-based nanocrystals for boosting oxygen reduction reaction with high activity and stability by using/controlling high-temperature annealing treatment is discussed. In all the reported Pt-based intermetallic nanocrystals, controlling the degree of ordering under the proper high temperature treatment is the key for achieving the optimized electrocatalysis. In order to search for cheaper catalysts, the progress on making Pd-based intermetallic nanocrystals is also discussed. Furthermore, future research directions are proposed and discussed to further enhance the efficiency of such unique intermetallic multimetallic nanocatalysts. This report aims to demonstrate the potential of ordered intermetallic strategy for boosting electrocatalysis and stimulating more research efforts in this field.									102	11	0	0	3	0	102			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000402967200009

The Ni3Se2 phase has a structure similar to the sulfur mineral heazlewoodite, which contains metal-metal bonding. The electrocatalytic activities of Ni3Se2 towards OER were seen to be at par with or even superior to the transition metal oxide based electrocatalyst in terms of onset overpotential for O-2 evolution as well as overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (observed at 290 mV). The electrocatalytic Ni3Se2 films were grown by electrodeposition on conducting substrates and the deposition parameters including the pH of the electrolytic bath, deposition potential, and substrate composition were seen to have some influence on the catalytic activity. So far, Ni3Se2 films deposited on the Au-coated Si substrate was seen to have the lowest overpotential. Annealing of the as-deposited electrocatalytic films in an inert atmosphere, enhanced their catalytic efficiencies by decreasing the overpotential (@10 mA cm(-2)) as well as increasing the current density. The structure and morphology of these films has been characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Catalytic activities were investigated through detailed electrochemical studies under alkaline conditions, including linear sweep voltammetry, chronoamperometric studies at constant potential, electrochemical surface area determination and calculation of the Tafel slope. The Faradaic efficiency of this catalyst has been estimated by reducing the evolved O-2 in a RRDE set-up which also confirmed that the evolved gas was indeed O-2. In addition to low overpotentials, these Ni3Se2 electrodeposited films were seen to be exceptionally stable under conditions of continuous O-2 evolution for an extended period (42 h).									518	21	0	0	21	0	520			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000375699500021

Here, high-dispersed Rh nanoparticles are successfully encapsulated in the pores of N-doped porous carbon polyhedrons (NPCP) derived from ZIF-8 to avoid their aggregation and detachment, which makes the electrocatalyst (Rh@NPCP) have high activity and good stability. With an accepted metal loading (9.84 wt% Rh), Rh@NPCP exhibits excellent activity for HER electrocatalysis with ultralow overpotentials of 20, 23 and 45 mV to reach a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) in alkaline, acidic and neutral media. Besides, remarkable ORR electrocatalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.84 V in alkaline media is achieved. Compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst (20 wt% Pt), the prepared Rh@NPCP catalyst demonstrates significantly superior electrocatalytic performance toward pH-universal HER and alkaline ORR, especially in stability. This work provides a highly efficient, durable and affordable electrocatalyst for HER and ORR, which may have practical applications in water splitting and fuel cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The obtained materials were investigated as potential catalysts for elemental mercury (Hg-0) and NO removal from simulate flue gas and the results indicated that MnCe@MOF exhibited superior activity in comparison with the conventional catalysts Mn-Ce loaded ZrO2, especially at low temperatures (<250 degrees C). It was established that the crystalline structure of MOF support influenced the catalytic behavior in a complex way. The MOF support played an important role in promoting dispersion of active components, improving the Hg-0 adsorption and enhancing oxygen utilization, which resulted in a desirable catalytic activity. To understand the mechanism of the Mn-Ce catalyst better, dynamic valence state evolution during the Hg-0 oxidation for the active components was investigated. The ratio of Mn3+/Mn4+ remained constant during the reaction at various temperatures, indicating the stability of Mn in the catalytic process. However, the ratio of Ce3+/Ce4+ gradually decreased with extended periods of reaction time, which most likely lead to the decreased of chemical adsorbed oxygen on the catalyst.

Both the design and synthesis of low-cost and high-performance catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remain challenging. Herein, an in-situ growth of carbon nanotubes encapsulated Ni particles on nickel foam is described. This catalyst is synthesized via a one-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at different temperatures followed by P-doping treatment (P-doped Ni@CNTs/NF). The corresponding physicochemical and electrochemical results illustrate that the P-doped Ni@CNTs/NF prepared at 600 degrees C with flower-like structure exhibits excellent activity and stability for HER in acidic electrolytes. In 0.5 MH2SO4 aqueous solution, the sample shows a small overpotential value of -135.2 mV to achieve a current density of -10 mA cm(-2), which also displays acceptable long-term stability for lasting 20 h. This work provides a facile approach to prepare a cost-effective catalyst with high efficiency and might promote further study of the transition metal catalysts for hydrogen evolution in acid environments.

These machines evolved exclusively in microbes early in our planet's history yet, despite their antiquity, are highly conserved. Hence, although there is enormous genetic diversity in nature, there remains a relatively stable set of core genes coding for the major redox reactions essential for life and biogeochemical cycles. These genes created and coevolved with biogeochemical cycles and were passed from microbe to microbe primarily by horizontal gene transfer. A major challenge in the coming decades is to understand how these machines evolved, how they work, and the processes that control their activity on both molecular and planetary scales.									1545	122	3	0	1355	5	1668			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000256059800033	18497287

It has a central role in erythropoiesis but is also involved in many other intracellular processes in the tissues of the body. It is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust and the most abundant transition metal in living organisms for which its characteristic chemistry endows it with a series of properties enabling it to fulfil certain biological reactions especially those involving redox mechanisms. It is involved in the transport of oxygen, in electron transfer, in the synthesis of DNA, in oxidations by oxygen (O-2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and in many other processes maintaining normal structure and function of virtually all mammalian cells. Because an iron atom can exist in two valency states, ferrous and ferric, iron became the primordial partner of oxygen in evolution. However, as de Sousa et al. (1989) state, such long standing partnerships have to use protective devices to ensure that the toxicity of neither partner is expressed in the presence of the other. Here, we discuss this dangerous partnership and its relevance to inflammation. The main themes of this review are the known roles of iron in the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates and new developments, including iron and transcription and the reaction of iron with nitric oxide. We also consider the widening recognition of the importance of oxygen metabolites in hypoxia-reperfusion injury and disease of the skin and joint.									112	1	1	0	76	1	123			1357-2725	1878-5875		WOS:A1995RD08400002	7767779

CA was associated with enhanced resistance to freezing in saline growth solutions, as manifested by protection of photosynthetic oxygen evolution and by reduced permeabilisation of the plasma membrane. Oxygen evolution activity in isolated chloroplasts was not affected by freezing, but was inhibited by high salt and the inhibition could be reversed or protected by glycerol. The activity of chloroplasts from cold-acclimated cells was more resistant to salt than of non-acclimatled cells. Electron transport measurements in chloroplasts indicated that high salt inhibited PS-II, but not PS-I electron transport. High salt also inhibited PS-II thermoluminescence (TL) activity in chloroplasts. Similar inhibition of PS-II TL was observed by freezing intact cells in saline solutions. Chloroplasts from cold-acclimated cells had enhanced resistance to inhibition of PS-II electron transport and of PS-II TL by high salt. These results suggest that inhibition of oxygen evolution upon freezing Dunaliella cells may result from inactivation of PS-II due to massive influx of salt and loss of glycerol. The enhanced freeze-resistance of cold-acclimated cells to inhibition of oxygen evolution can be accounted for partly by protection of PS-II against high salt.									6	1	0	0	5	0	7			0176-1617			WOS:000181286800010	12685034

Upon the excellent metallic characteristics of transition metal nitrides (TMN), the unfavorable d-band energy level severely hinders their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic properties. Herein, an enhanced metallicity concept is introduced to address this issue. We strongly enable bimetallic Ni2Fe2N with outstanding alkaline HER capability by making more metallic through in situ hybridization of another bimetallic compound, Ni3Fe. The enhanced metallicity Ni2Fe2N/Ni3Fe hybrid displays nearly 200% enhancement in alkaline HER catalytic activity compared to pristine Ni2Fe2N at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Experimental and theoretical analyses, as well as crystal field diagram persistently show that the enhanced HER catalytic properties is attributed to the enhanced metallic nature and synergistic effect, endowing strong electronic interaction between Ni2Fe2N and Ni3Fe. The strong electronic interaction enables low adsorption energy and a reasonable shift in the dorbital, which helps in facilitating water dissociation and H-desorption. This present study offers a useful pathway for the rational design of other catalysts for HER and beyond. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Thin-film electrocatalytic material (H-2-NiCat) with robust water reduction properties, which can be readily prepared by a reduction-induced electrodeposition method from nickel salts in a borate-buffered electrolyte (pH 9.2), is reported. The material consists of nanoparticles with nickel oxide or hydroxide species located at the surface and metallic nickel in the bulk. The catalyst mediates H-2 evolution in a near-neutral aqueous buffer at low overpotential. The catalyst requires a subsequent oxidative pretreatment in order to attain a well-defined hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, and the 1.5 h anodized catalyst film exhibits a HER current density of about 1.50 mA cm(-2) at 0.452 V overpotential over a period of 24 h with no observable corrosion. In addition, it can be converted by anodic equilibration into an amorphous Ni-based oxide film (O-2-NiCat) to catalyze O-2 evolution, and the switch between the two catalytic forms is fully reversible. The robust, bifunctional, switchable, and noble-metal-free catalytic material has immense potential in artificial solar water-splitting devices.									85	4	0	0	2	0	85			1932-7447			WOS:000332756000002

Nevertheless, their specific configuration and the role played in regulating the surface reconstruction of electrocatalysts remain ambiguous. Herein, cationic vacancy defects are generated via aprotic-solvent-solvation-induced leaking of metal cations from NiFe-LDH nanosheets. DFT calculation and in situ Raman spectroscopic observation both reveal that the as-generated cationic vacancy defects tend to exist as V-M (M=Ni/Fe); under increasing applied voltage, they tend to assume the configuration V-MOH, and eventually transform into VMOH-H which is the most active yet most difficult to form thermodynamically. Meanwhile, with increasing voltage the surface crystalline Ni(OH)(x) in the NiFe-LDH is gradually converted into disordered status; under sufficiently high voltage when oxygen bubbles start to evolve, local NiOOH species become appearing, which is the residual product from the formation of vacancy VMOH-H. Thus, we demonstrate that the cationic defects evolve along with increasing applied voltage (V-M -> V-MOH -> VMOH-H), and reveal the essential motif for the surface restructuration process of NiFe-LDH (crystalline Ni(OH)(x) -> disordered Ni(OH)(x) -> NiOOH). Our work provides insight into defect-induced surface restructuration behaviors of NiFe-LDH as a typical precatalyst for efficient OER electrocatalysis.									29	0	0	0	2	0	29			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000716788200001	34658135	
J	Grotjohann, I; Jolley, C; Fromme, P								Evolution of photosynthesis and oxygen evolution: Implications from the structural comparison of Photosystems I and II								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				6	20			4743	4753		10.1039/b408980d				2004	2004	Two large membrane protein complexes, Photosystem I and II (PS I and PS II), perform the first step in the conversion of the light energy from the sun into chemical energy: the light-induced transmembrane charge separation. They function in series; PS II provides the strong positive redox potential for water oxidation, while PS I generates a strong negative redox potential, which makes it able to reduce ferredoxin and deliver the electrons for the reduction of hydrogen in the form of NADPH. The structural comparison of PS I and PS II sheds light on the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. Both Photosystems show similarities in their core structure, indicating that they have been derived from a common ancestor. Striking differences in the arrangement and coordination of cofactors and in their protein environment, however, may contain the secret to the functional differences between the Photosystems. In this article, we address how the oxygen-evolving complex may have developed, and the main similarities and differences in the electron carriers and the organization of the antenna systems of these two complexes.									19	0	0	0	14	0	22			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000224755500004

This observation initiated a century of argument as to the origin of voltaic electricity (contact vs chemical) and catalyzed practical advances, such as the first demonstration of water electrolysis by William Nicholson and Anthony Carlisle within a few months of Volta's announcement. A deep dive into the literature demonstrates that practitioners at the time were disadvantaged in their quest for a detailed understanding of the pile. For instance, the idea of salt dissociation into charged ions and the discovery of the electron did not come to light until nearly an entire century after the pile made its first debut. A thorough survey of the literature also indicates that original piles, which were composed of silver or copper as the cathode and zinc as the anode, operated by the dissolution of zinc at the anode and the reduction of some species at the cathode. A cathodic reaction commonly implicated is the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we demonstrate that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) contributes to the cathodic half-reaction from pH 0 to 14, suggesting that the true mechanism of the voltaic pile depends on the mixed potential set by the HER/ORR and zinc oxidation. While the main point of this article is to implicate dissolved oxygen, we end the article with suggestions for experimental modifications to promote hands-on learning.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-9584	1938-1328		WOS:000696560500022

In both oxidation methods, a general loss of the original structure regularity and high surface area was observed with increasing amount of oxidation. However, the electrochemical method showed much better controllability and enabled the generation of a large number of oxygen functional groups while retaining the original structure of the ZTC. Unlike chemical treatments, highly microporous carbons with an ordered 3-D structure, high surface area (ranging between 1900 and 3500 m(2)/g) and a large number of oxygen groups (O = 11,000-3300 mu mol/g), have been prepared by the electrochemical method. Some insights into the electrooxidation mechanism of carbon materials are proposed from the obtained polarization curves, using ZTC as a model carbon material. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a facile approach to fabricate highly efficient nanostructured FeNi3 incorporated on carbon doped with multiple nonmetal elements (FeNi3/M-C) was prepared by annealing an insitu polymerized metal complex from economical precursors. The temperature dependence of the structure and the catalytic performance for the OER was probed. The best pyrolysis temperature was 800 degrees C, at which the fabricated material exhibited the highest catalytic performance for the OER. Specifically, an overpotential as low as 246 mV (no IR correction) afforded 10 mAcm(-2) with a low Tafel slope of 40 mVdec(-1), exceeding that of the best noble-metal catalyst IrO2 and other similar Fe-Ni alloys. High catalytic efficiency and anticorrosion ability towards the OER were displayed in terms of high specific surface area, rapid kinetics, high stability, and specific activity. The excellent performance was correlated to the structure and the modest graphitization degree of carbon and an appropriate ratio between graphitic and pyridinic N atoms and the synergistic effect between the Fe-Ni alloy active sites and the conducting carbon doped with multiple nonmetal elements. Moreover, as a powder catalyst, it could be applied in a real polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer. These results are helpful for understanding the improved catalytic activity and the promotion of the catalytic efficiency of the Fe-Ni alloy materials for the OER.									65	9	0	0	3	0	65			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000442491300007	29892992

Herein, three-dimensional porous network of NiCoP nanosheets being covered by bimetallic phosphides nanoparticles with a ultra-small size of ti 7 nm anchored on nickel foam (NF) is synthesized via employing a low-cost hydrothermal and phosphorization reaction, which provides the numerous electrcatalytic active area and reactive sites, benefiting for HER behaviors. Additionally, a top-down structure of F-doped NiCo2Al-LDHs@ZnFeAl-LDHs (F-NC2AL@ZFAL) catalysts supported on NF is also fabricated by a two-step hydrothermal reaction, which could also provide promising OER performances. As expected, the as-prepared HER and OER catalysts manifest the lower overpotential of 58 and 177 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH solution. Significantly, a overall water electrolyzer assembled by employing the as-prepared HER and OER catalysts displays the various cell voltages of 1.36, 1.55, 1.66, and 1.75 Vat the corresponding current densities of 10, 20, 50, and 100 mA cm-2, with the excellent durability for 22 h at 100 mA cm-2.

Herein, we report a facile preparation of meso/macroporous Co and N co-doped carbon nanofibers (Co-N-x@CNFs) as a high performance and cost-effective electrocatalyst toward ORR. Co-N-x@CNFs are simply obtained from electro-spinning of Co precursor and bicomponent polymers (PVP/PAN) followed by temperature controlled carbonization and further activation step. The prepared Co-N-x@CNF catalyst carbonized at 700 degrees C (Co-N-x@CNF700) shows outstanding ORR performance, i.e., a low onset potential (0.941 V) and half wave potential (0.814 V) with almost four-electron transfer pathways (n = 3.9). In addition, Co-N-x@CNF700 exhibits a superior methanol tolerance and higher stability (> 70 h) in Zn-air battery in comparison with Pt/C catalyst (similar to 30 h). The outstanding performance of Co-N-x@CNF700 catalysts is attributed to i) enlarged surface area with bimodal porosity achieved by leaching of inactive species, ii) increase of exposed ORR active Co-N-x moieties and graphitic edge sites, and iii) enhanced electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance due to the existence of numerous graphitic flakes in carbon matrix.									38	1	0	0	1	0	38			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000428007400020

In addition, electrochemical alcohol oxidation is considered a viable anode reaction that can be paired with H-2 evolution or other reductive fuel production reactions in electrochemical and photoelectrochemical cells. NiOOH, a material that has been extensively studied as an oxygen evolution catalyst, is among the most promising electrocatalysts for selective alcohol oxidation. Electrochemical alcohol oxidation by NiOOH has been understood since the 1970s to proceed through a hydrogen atom transfer to NiOOH. In this study, we establish that there is a second, more dominant general alcohol oxidation pathway on NiOOH enabled at more positive potentials. Using a three-step electrochemical procedure we developed, we deconvoluted the currents corresponding to these two pathways for various alcohols and aldehydes. The results show that alcohols and aldehydes have a distinct difference in their respective preferences for the two oxidation pathways. Our three-step electrochemical procedure also allowed us to evaluate the Ni valence involved with the different oxidation pathways to elucidate their mechanistic differences. Using these experimental results coupled with a computational investigation, we propose that the new pathway entails hydride transfer from the substrate to Ni4+ sites in NiOOH. This study offers an essential foundation to understand various oxidative electrochemical dehydrogenation reactions on oxide and hydroxide-based catalytic electrodes.									52	0	0	0	5	0	52			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000603395100035	33320654

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show that uniform SnO2 intermediate layers with rutile crystal structure were successfully achieved. According to the results of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), oxygen evolution potential (OEP) of the Ti/SnO2/MnO2 electrodes decreases with increasing SnO2 content, indicating that the electro-catalytic oxidation activity of the electrode increases. Accelerated service life tests results demonstrate that SnO2 intermediate layer can improve the service life of the Ti/SnO2/MnO2 electrode. As the content of SnO2 intermediate layer increases, the cell voltage and the energy consumption decrease apparently.									11	7	0	0	0	0	15			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000406388300022

It is crucial to develop a cost-effective, highly active, and durable electrocatalysts for ORR to overcome the sluggish kinetics of four electrons pathway. In recent years, the carbon-based electrocatalysts derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted tremendous attention and have been shown to exhibit superior catalytic activity and excellent intrinsic properties such as large surface area, large pore volume, uniform pore distribution, and tunable chemical structure. Here in this review, the development of MOF-derived heteroatom-doped carbon-based electrocatalysts, including non-metal (such as N, S, B, and P) and metal (such as Fe and Co) doped carbon materials, is summarized. It furthermore, it is demonstrated that the enhancement of ORR performance is associated with favorably well-designed porous structure, large surface area, and high-tensity active sites. Finally, the future perspectives of carbon-based electrocatalysts for ORR are provided with an emphasis on the development of a clear mechanism of MOF-derived non-metal-doped electrocatalysts and certain metal-doped electrocatalysts.									240	19	0	0	11	0	243				2198-3844		WOS:000428310500001	29593954

Herein, we report A-site cation-ordering layered perovskite EuBa0.5Sr0.5Co2-xFexO5+delta (EBSCFx) (x = 0.2-0.6) electrocatalysts. When evaluated for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, EuBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.6Fe0.4O5+delta (EBSCF0.4) exhibits the best catalytic activity among all of these catalysts, as evidenced by the lowest overpotential of 420 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Notably, the catalytic activity of EBSCF0.4 is better than that of commercial IrO2 at the overpotential >460 mV. Furthermore, the EBSCF0.4-20RuO(2) (involving 20 wt % RuO2) composite catalyst is developed and gives an overpotential as low as 390 mV at 50 mA cm(-2), which is even superior to commercial RuO2. For overall water splitting, an electrolysis voltage of merely 1.47 V is achieved at 10 mA cm(-2) in an electrolyzer employing EBSCF0.4-20RuO(2) as bifunctional catalysts, with exceptional durability for 24 h. Such a performance outperforms state-of-the-art IrO2 parallel to Pt/C and RuO2 parallel to Pt/C couples. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the unique catalytic properties of EBSCF0.4 may benefit from highly active Fe sites with octahedral coordination, and the synergistic effects of Fe and Ru sites in the composite catalyst accelerate the electrochemical water oxidation.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2470-1343			WOS:000538419300070	32548435

However, the kinetics of the anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in AEMFCs is significantly decreased compared to the HOR in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Therefore, it is urgent to develop HOR catalysts with low price, high activity, and robust stability. However, comprehensive timely reviews on this specific subject do not exist enough yet and it is necessary to update reported major achievements and to point out future investigation directions. In this review, the current reaction mechanisms on HOR are summarized and deeply understood. The debates between the mechanisms are greatly harmonized.

At the anode, alcohols are specifically converted to alkoxyl radicals. These can be used for chemical synthesis. When the enormous reactivity of such intermediate spin centers is not controlled, mineralization or electrochemical incineration dominates. Efficient strategies include either high substrate concentrations or fluorinated alcohols which seem to stabilize the spin centers in the course of reaction.									56	0	0	0	3	0	56			0340-1022	1436-5049	978-3-642-28123-5; 978-3-642-28122-8	WOS:000321617400002	21452080

Especially for BiVO4 the slow electron transport to the back contact facilitates charge recombination. Hence, thin layers have to be used to obtain higher photocurrents which are concomitantly only allow low absorption of the incident light. To address this limitation we have modified FTO substrates with Pt-nanoparticles before electrodepositing BiVO4. The Pt-nanoparticles decrease the overpotential for the electrodeposition of BiVO4, but more importantly they provide the basis for decreased charge recombination. Electrodeposited Mo-doped BiVO4 on Pt-nanoparticle modified FTO exhibits a substantially decreased recombination of photogenerated charge carriers during frontside illumination. Simultaneous co-doping of BiVO4 with two different metals leads to a substantial enhancement of the incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) during light driven oxygen evolution reaction. Highest IPCE (>30% at 1.2 V vs. RHE) values were obtained for Mo/Zn- and Mo/B-doped BiVO4.									23	1	0	0	2	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000376091600044

Targeted and random mutagenesis of these enzymes have been used to both understand and alter their reactivity. These studies have led to insights into residues essential for catalysis and FDH variants with improved stability, expanded substrate scope, and altered site selectivity. Mutations throughout FDH structures have contributed to all of these advances. More recent studies have sought to rationalize the impact of these mutations on FDH function and to identify new FDHs to deepen our understanding of this enzyme class and to expand their utility for biocatalytic applications.									35	0	0	0	21	0	35			0066-4154		978-0-8243-0887-2	WOS:000438081700009	29589959

Herein, we successfully fabricated a hierarchical necklace-like nanohybrid via assembling Ni-Co mixed metal phosphides/carbon (NiCoP/C) hollow nanocages and nanosheets with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). It was revealed that Ni-Co-layered double hydroxide/carbon hollow nanocages and nanosheets derived from Co-based MOF polyhedrons (ZIF-67) could pass through CNTs and perpendicularly anchor onto the surface of CNTs, respectively, thus finally constructing a hierarchical CNTs@NiCoP/C nanohybrid via further low-temperature phosphorization. The as-assembled CNTs@NiCoP/C electrocatalyst exhibited promising electrocatalytic performance towards OER with a low overpotential of about 0.297 V for reaching a current density of 10.0 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 57.35 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH owing to the advantages of its unique superstructure and multiple composition. Furthermore, the present CNTs@NiCoP/C also possessed good long-term operation stability. This synthesis strategy involving the combination of transition metal phosphides and CNTs to form hierarchical nanostructures holds promising potential for designing highly OER-active electrocatalysts.									60	2	0	0	3	0	60			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000439319000029	29974922

Such catalysts should offer binary active sites and an ability to transfer oxygen-based species and electrons. A 3D catalyst, composed of nanoparticles of CoFe alloy embedded in N-doped carbon nanotubes tangled with reduced graphene oxide, was developed, which presents appreciable ORR/OER activity when applied in a Zn-air battery. A high open-circuit voltage of 1.43 V, a stable discharge voltage of 1.22 V, a high energy efficiency of 60.1%, and excellent stability after 1600 cycles at 10 mAcm(-2) are demonstrated. An all-solid-state battery had an outstanding lifetime and high cell efficiency even upon bending. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that OOH* and O* intermediates induce variations in the Fe-Fe and Co-Co bond lengths, respectively, suggesting that Fe and Co species are crucial to the ORR/OER processes.									287	25	0	0	9	0	287			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000452235600038	30302889

As an efficient power generation device that converts hydrogen energy into electric energy, fuel cell has attracted more and more attention. For fuel cells, the oxygen reduction reac-tion (ORR) at the cathode is the core reaction, and the design and development of high-performance ORR catalysts remain quite challenging. Since the microenvironment of the active center of single atom cat-alysts (SACs) has an important influence on its catalytic performance, it has been a research focus to improve the ORR activity and stability of electrocatalysts by adjusting the structure of the active center through reasonable structural regulation methods. In this review, we reviewed the preparation and struc-ture-activity relationship of SACs for ORR. Then, the structural precision regulation methods for improv-ing the activity and stability of ORR electrocatalysts are discussed. And the advanced in-situ characterization techniques for revealing the changes of active sites in the electrocatalytic ORR process are summarized. Finally, the challenges and future design directions of SACs for ORR are discussed. This work will provide important reference value for the design and synthesis of SACs with high activity and stability for ORR.(c) 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

By effectively bypassing the use of organic surfactants, the postsynthesis steps for immobilization onto electrodes, catalytic ink preparation using binders, and the common problem of nanoparticles (NPs) detachment from the supports involved in traditional methodologies, we demonstrate a versatile electrodeposition method for growing anisotropic microstructures directly onto a three-dimensional (3D) carbon felt electrode, using platinum NPs as the elementary building blocks. The as-synthesized materials were extensively characterized by integrating methods of physical (thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and electroanalytical (voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectrometry) chemistry to examine the intricate relationship of material-to-performance and select the best-performing electrocatalyst to be applied in the model reaction of ORR for its practical integration into a microbial fuel cell (MFC). A tightly optimized procedure enables decorating an electrochemically activated carbon felt electrode by 40-60 nm ultrathin 3D-interconnected platinum nanoarrays leading to a hierarchical framework of ca. 500 nm. Half-cell reactions reveal that the highly rough metallic surface exhibits improved activity and stability toward ORR (E-onset similar to 1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, p(HO2-) < 0.1%) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (-10 mA cm(-2) for only 75 mV overpotential). Owing to its unique features, the developed material showed distinguished performance as an air-breathing cathode in a garden compost MFC, exhibiting better current and faster power generation than those of its equivalent classical double chamber. The enhanced performance of the material obtained herein is explained by the absence of any organic surfactants on the surface of the nanoarrays, the good metal-support interaction, particular morphology of the nanoarrays, and the reduced aggregation/detachment of particles. It promises a radical improvement in current surface reactions and paves a new way toward electrodes with regulated surface roughness, allowing for their successful application in heterogeneous catalysis.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			1944-8244			WOS:000405764700041	28621134

A Au/CuO/SBA-15 catalyst was designed and prepared via a nanoengineering approach in which the metallic particles of average size 3 nm located in the vicinity of CuO particles were highly dispersed on the SBA-15 support. It was found that the CuO particles could reduce the gold (Au) particle size, stabilize the Au particles, and facilitate the activation of molecular oxygen. Although this catalyst is extremely active for the PROX reaction at room temperature and superior to the Au/SBA-15 and CuO/SBA-15 catalysts, it deactivates easily. Clear experimental evidence showed that CuO was reduced to Cu2O and Cu in the reductive reaction gas mixture, and the Cu further combined/dissolved into the Au particles during the reaction. The alloying of Au and Cu not only decreased the catalytic activity of the Au particles but also reduced the ability of CuO to activate molecular oxygen. Fortunately, this alloying process could be reversed via a simple calcination in air to activate the catalyst. The identification of the catalyst structural evolution and this new contributing factor toward the deactivation of the Au catalysts has provided insights into the field of Au catalysis.									78	3	0	0	2	1	78			2155-5435			WOS:000301098800006

Herein, cobalt- and iron-based mixed oxide nanoclusters and laminar superstructures were successfully synthesized through a single step low temperature solution phase route by using good and poor solvent systems. The structure of the as-fabricated material is largely defined by the counterions of the precursor salts. The easily obtained unique FeCo-based mixed oxide nanoclusters and laminar superstructures are not only capable of catalysing the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) under sunlight, but also behave as outstanding electrocatalysts towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The present findings offer a new insight to rationally design materials with desired structures and functions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000792273700001

Effect of storage time on the pressure oxidation enthalpy of pyrite								JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY				108	3			829	835		10.1007/s10973-012-2382-7				JUN 2012	2012	The information on heat of oxidation-reduction reactions is important for the heat balance and optimization of the autoclave design in the hydrometallurgical industry in ore processing. Pyrite (FeS2) is a gangue mineral that presents with nickel-containing pentlandite, and copper-containing chalcopyrite minerals. The presence of pyrite impacts to the overall heat of leaching process. This study has been performed on a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC80, Setaram) with a commercial mixing cell to study the thermal behaviour of pure pyrite FeS2 (Valdenegrillos, Spain) mineral particles during oxidative pressure leaching at 150 A degrees C and partial oxygen pressure of 3.4 MPa. A calorimetric method for determining the enthalpy of leaching of sulphide minerals at high temperatures and oxygen pressures has been used to evaluate the enthalpies of oxidation of freshly ground pyrite and pyrite stored for a year in contact with air (stored pyrite) under conditions relevant to pressure oxidation operations. Ground pyrite stored over time has long since been known to result in greater heat evolution during oxidative leaching. A likely mechanism for this phenomenon was uncovered: formation of ferrous sulphate and sulphuric acid during storage in contact with air influencing greater heat evolution at the outset of the reaction. Two mass loss steps on TG curve of stored pyrite, attributed to the elimination of atmospheric moisture and H2O molecule from FeSO4 center dot H2O, is absent on TG curve of freshly ground pyrite.									7	1	0	0	1	0	7			1388-6150			WOS:000304621000001

The synthesis, properties, and in-depth characterization of a homogeneous CoNiFeCu catalyst are reported, demonstrating that multimetal synergistic effects improve the OER kinetics and the intrinsic activity. In situ carbon corrosion and Cu leaching during the OER lead to an enhanced electrochemically active surface area, providing favorable conditions for improved electronic interaction between the constituent metals. After activation, the catalyst exhibits excellent activity with a low overpotential of 291.5 +/- 0.5 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 43.9 mV dec(-1). It shows superior stability compared to RuO2 in 1 m KOH, which is even preserved for 120 h at 500 mA cm(-2) in 7 m KOH at 50 degrees C. Single particles of this CoNiFeCu after their placement on nanoelectrodes combined with identical location transmission electron microscopy before and after applying cyclic voltammetry are investigated. The improved catalytic performance is due to surface carbon corrosion and Cu leaching. The proposed catalyst design strategy combined with the unique single-nanoparticle technique contributes to the development and characterization of high-performance catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000756704400001	35062041

Geometric structure engineering and electronic structure modulation can be efficiently used to improve catalyst activity. Herein, a facile Ar plasma treatment method to fabricate a composite of uniformly dispersed iridium-copper oxide nanoclusters supported on defective graphene (DG) to form IrCuOx@DG, is described. Acid leaching can be used to remove Cu atoms and generate porous IrOx nanoclusters supported on DG (P-IrOx@DG), which can serve as efficient and robust pH-universal OER electrocatalysts. Moreover, when paired with commercial 20 wt% Pt/C, P-IrOx@DG can deliver current densities of 350.0, 317.6, and 47.1 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 2.2 V for overall water splitting in 0.5 m sulfuric acid, 1.0 m potassium hydroxide, and 1.0 m phosphate buffer solution, respectively, outperforming commercial IrO2 and nonporous IrOx nanoclusters supported on DG (O-IrOx@DG). Probing experiment, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and theoretical calculation results demonstrate that Cu removal can successfully create P-IrOx nanoclusters and introduce unsaturated Ir atoms. The optimum binding energies of oxygenated intermediate species on unsaturated Ir sites and ultrafine IrOx nanoclusters contribute to the high intrinsic OER catalytic activity of P-IrOx@DG.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000635511700001	33792164

It is generally accepted that the surface of the transition metal-based electrocatalyst exposed to the alkaline electrolyte is highly oxidized and reconstructed, forming an amorphous layer during the electrochemical process. This amorphous active phase is favorable for OER due to its abundant dangling bonds, vacancies and defects, which is tricky to be rationally prepared by conventional methods. Herein, a facile access to crystalline / amorphous NiOx microbelt superstructure of core-shell nanoparticles is presented, which is assembled of crystalline NiO nanoparticles coated with amorphous Ni3+/Ni2+ oxide layer. Electrochemical activation induces the in-situ surface reconstruction of the NiOx microbelt superstructure, resulting in a thicker outer amorphous Ni3+/Ni2+ layer further facilitating OER. Owing to the optimization of the in-situ surface reconstruction, the NiOx microbelt superstructure with crystalline / amorphous dual phases exhibited both high electrocatalytic activity and superior durability for OER, with the original microbelt superstructure retained after 50000 s I-t test.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0021-9797	1095-7103		WOS:000810408500012	35667206

The novelty is in the selective creation of both H-2 and O-2 cocatalysts on surface active sites of g-C3N4 via photodeposition triggering the splitting of water for the simultaneous evolution of H-2 and O-2 gases in a stoichiometric ratio of 2 : 1, irradiated with light, without using any sacrificial reagents.

However, both the lack of exposed catalytic sites and strong Mo-H binding strength will strongly hinder the HER process for Mo2C-based electrocatalysts. Herein, a scalable strategy is proposed for the preparation of highly porous Mo2C/C electrocatalysts with a specific surface area up to 611 m(2) g(-1) as well as uniform nitrogen doping derived from N, K co-activated biochar (NKAB). And the porous architecture with a large specific surface area can afford abundant catalytic sites. Additionally, both the Mo2C and carbon matrix are doped with nitrogen effectively, which can optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy of Mo2C/C electrocatalysts associated with a higher intrinsic activity. As a result, the active site density and intrinsic activity of Mo2C/NKAB have been promoted simultaneously on account of the high specific surface area and nitrogen doping. Furthermore, the interconnected N-rich carbon matrix provides efficient electron transfer pathways for superior HER kinetics. Ultimately, the overall HER performances of Mo2C/NKAB can be significantly enhanced.									13	0	0	0	3	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000514827600098

We report here a strategy to improve the sluggish HER kinetics on 3d transition metal hydroxides by incorporating tungsten through a one-step electrodeposition method. The prepared amorphous CoW-(OH)(x) delivers high HER activity in neutral solution, which only requires overpotentials of -73.6 and -114.9 mV to achieve the current densities of -10 and -20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS), respectively. The activity can be ascribed to the synergistic effects between Co and W, where Co sites facilitate H2O dissociation to generate H-ad intermediates and W sites could effectively convert H-ad to H-2. Meanwhile, the amorphous architecture features homogeneously dispersed Co and W atoms that avoid crystalline phase separation, further strengthening their collaborative interactions. Similar enhanced HER activity is also observed on the electrodeposited NiW(OH)(x) electrocatalyst, suggesting the universality of this strategy for accelerating HER in neutral environments.									53	4	0	0	3	0	54			2155-5435			WOS:000434369600044

Immense effort is made to optimize TMP catalysts aiming to satisfy the electrochemical catalysis performance. In this work, an environmentally friendly in situ green phosphating strategy and spatial limiting effect of the RuCo precursor is employed to fabricate the ruthenium nanoclusters anchored on cobalt phosphide hollow microspheres (Ru NCs/Co2P HMs). The obtained Ru NCs/Co2P HMs electrocatalysts exhibit high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at wide pH ranges, which require an overpotential of 77 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 and 118 mV in 1.0 mol/L KOH. Besides, the multifunctional Ru NCs/Co2P HMs exhibit good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an overpotential of 197 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4, which is below that of the commercial RuO2 electrocatalyst (248 mV). A two-electrode electrolyzer is assembled as well, in acid electrolyte, it achieves a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at a voltage of 1.53 V, which is superior to that of the benchmark of precious metal-based electrolyzer (1.58 V).

The 12 different structural stability domains obtained by the bonding evolution theory have been identified as well as the bifurcation catastrophes (fold and cusp) responsible for the changes in the topology of the system. This analysis permits finding a relationship between the ELF topology and the evolution of the bond breaking/forming processes and electron pair rearrangements through the reaction progress in terms of the different ways of pairing up the electrons. The reaction mechanism corresponds to an asynchronous electronic flux; first, the O1?C5 bond is formed by the nucleophilic attack of the C5 carbon of the electron rich ethylene 2 on the most electrophilically activated carbonyl O1 oxygen of 1, and once the s bond has been completed, the formation process of the second O4?C6 bond takes place. In addition, the values of the local electrophilicity and local nucleophilcity indices in the framework of conceptual density functional theory accounts for the asychronicity of the process as well as for the observed regioselectivity.

Based on the XPS characterization, a new term, degree of surface oxidation (DSO), is proposed to illustrate their relationship between ORR activity and surface oxidation extent. TPR characterization also provides the evolution of surface species within the topmost region. It can be obviously found the optimal temperature for the promotion of ORR activity on various oxidized samples is 520 K. On the other hand, various heat treatment atmospheres (H-2 and CO) are applied on Pd Co system without changing their particle size. It is clearly evident that the oxidized catalysts can exhibit the superior performance relative to that of the non-oxidized ones, confirming the improved ORR activity is solely ascribed to the formation of surface PdO species with 100% DSO value rather than large particle size effect. Moreover, an explainable model is demonstrated to illustrate the promotional effect of ORR performance on the oxidized PdCo/C catalysts. Copyright (C) 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Among various material classes, binary metal sulphides show a great promise as HER catalysts because of their tunable energy levels conducive to a high catalytic activity and high robustness under harsh operating conditions. On the other hand, facet-controlled nanoparticles with controlled surface energies have gained great recent popularity as active and selective catalysts. However, binary metal sulphide nanoparticles with well-defined facets and high surface areas are very rare. Herein we report the synthesis of a facet-controlled hollow Rh3Pb2S2 nanocage as a new catalytic material and its excellent activity (overpotential: 87.3 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and robustness toward HER under harsh acidic conditions.									22	1	0	0	1	0	22			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000434313200005	29786733

The sluggish water oxidation reaction (WOR) results in low overall energy conversion efficiency; also the production of O-2 is not of economic value. Thus, replacing sluggish anodic water oxidation reaction with 5-(Hydroxymethyl) furfural oxidation reaction (HmfOR) has been considered as a more energy-efficient strategy to produce hydrogen. Here, Ni3N incorporated by V2O3 is synthesized via thermal ammonolysis, which shows excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and HmfOR. The electrocatalyst has strong tolerance to Hmf, which avoids the use of membrane. The Ni3N-V2O3 hybrids shows a low overpotential of 53 mV for HER, and a low overpotential of 230 mV for HmfOR, which is below 140 mV for WOR at 10 mA cm(-2). When Ni3N-V2O3 is employed as a bifunctional electrode, it offers a cell voltage of only 1.40 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for continuously hydrogen production.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000697605400006

TiOxNy@CnNm composite nanoparticles were prepared by covering uniform carbon spheres of about 300 nm in size, synthesized through the hydrothermal reaction of glucose, with a homogeneous titania shell made by sol-gel processing. The core-shell particles were then subjected to nitridation in ammonia vapor at different temperatures (550 degrees C-150 degrees C). The influence of the nitridation temperature on the structure and phase composition of the resulting composite particles was evaluated by a variety of techniques, including electron microscopy (SEM, TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), elemental analysis, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, and N-2 sorption measurements, the electrochemical properties and the ORR performance of the materials were determined by rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) measurements. Trends in the evolution of the structural/chemical properties and electrochemical/electrocatalytic properties as well as correlations between them are discussed; an optimized mesoporosity of the titanium (oxy) nitride shell was identified as the key criterion for the catalyst's ORR performance.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2196-0216			WOS:000388377200017

In this study a well-defined synergistic photocatalysis system is realized by the 2D amorphous heterostructures (2DAHs) Ag/a-WO3-x which are constructed by Ag nanoparticles on 2D amorphous tungsten oxide (a-WO3-x) fabricated via supercritical CO2 method. We demonstrate theoretically that the oxygen evolution reactions (OER), characterized by photocurrent response, have been dramatically improved in Ag/a-WO3-x than those of both single a-WO3-x and Ag/WO3-x systems. Such an enhanced photoelectrochemical performance attributes to the superposition effect of amorphous effect catalysis and local surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) catalysis. More interestingly, the ab into density-functional theory calculations reveal that the amorphous effect catalysis ascribes to the unique d-d tail states coupling of both Ag and W atoms in the 2DAHs. Overall, our findings not only propose the prototype of synergistic photocatalysis, but also provide a new methodology to the design of novel catalyst.									50	1	0	0	2	0	50			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000467661700064		
J									Mechanism of electron transfer in photosynthetic reaction centres and oxygen evolution by plants								Mechanism of electron transfer in photosynthetic reaction centres and oxygen evolution by plants								iv+64 pp	iv+64 pp						1985	1985	The research carried out has been mainly concerned with the identification and characterisation of the electron transport components of photosystem 2 and the oxygen-evolving enzyme complex in plants and algae. Procedures have been developed for the isolation of photosystem 2 on a large enough scale for detailed analysis by electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of the iron-quinone electron acceptor has been identified for the first time. Redox titrations show that this component has Emsime-10 mV showing that it is the acceptor detected as QH in titrations of fluorescence and also by the C550 absorption change. Illumination at 200K of samples in which the iron-quinone is reduced results in the reduction of the early electron acceptor pheophytin. This reduction can be detected by the appearance of a split radical EPR signal at low temperature. Redox titrations show that the intensity of this signal increases at two potentials, one close to 0 mV paralleling the reduction of the iron-quinone. The second close to -300 mV which seems to correspond to the component QL seen in titrations of fluorescence. The redox state of the acceptor complex can also be monitored by measuring reaction centre triplet formation.									0	0	0		0	0	0						INSPEC:2490232

Reactions that result in carbon loss and glass network structure changes during plasma treatment were carefully examined, since carbon loss increases the dielectric constant of the low-k dielectrics and the susceptibility to water attack, thus adversely affecting the performance of these dielectric materials in microelectronic devices. Results from AIMD based collision cascade simulations have provided mechanistic understanding of collision reactions during plasma bombardment. It was found that Si-CH3 bond scission and CH3 abstraction reactions are the primary methods of carbon loss. Two distinct mechanisms were identified for CH3 removal from 100 eV plasma bombardment, one due to direct momentum transfer from the high-energy incident Ar atom to a Si-O bond on the OSG surface, and the other due to generation of highly reactive atomic oxygen radicals during collision cascades. Atomic oxygen radicals generated during cascades were found to occur at a rate of 1-3 per 100 eV Ar impact with radical kinetic energies ranging from 2.2 to 42.6 eV, well above the minimum energy of 0.1 eV for Si-CH3 bond breakage. Both reaction mechanisms were examined through atomic charge analysis and the results indicated that the Ar atom ionizes when it impacts the OSG surface, causing temporary charge transfer from the Ar atom to the Si-O bond and playing a role in CH3 removal. The cascading atomic oxygen radicals and the ionization of the Ar atom during the Si-CH3 bond scission and CH3 removal demonstrate the secondary effects of Ar bombardment which must be considered during plasma etching of low-k dielectrics.

In the present study, we employed Co-ZIF-9 as a sacrificial precursor to synthesize highly efficient bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts through tuning the pyrolysis temperature and Fe-doping of the zeolitic imidazolate framework. The synthesized samples were characterized extensively using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ()CPS), X-ray diffraction, elemental CHN and ICP analyses, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy as well as scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopies. It has been found that the Fe-doping can significantly affect the electrocatalytic activity of the product through improving the number of transferred electrons. The ZIF-9_Fe3_Pyrol exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards ORR (E-onset = 0.90 V vs. RHE) and OER (E-onset = 1.55 V vs. RHE), much better than other evaluated catalysts and comparable to the commercial PtRuC bifunctional catalyst. Moreover, the ZIF-9_Fe3_Pyrol sample outperformed the precious PtRuC catalyst with very little decay in ORR and OER activity over long continuous operation. The ZIF-9Fe3_Pyrol exhibited excellent performance as a cathode catalyst in rechargeable Zn-air batteries, superior to the one assembled with the state-of-the-art catalyst.									21	6	0	0	1	0	23			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000474327300033

The first generation emulsions have provided confirmation that the physical principals of high gas solubility and low viscosity can effectively support organ and organism respiration and metabolism. Clinical trials led the US FDA in 1990 to be the first to approve a 20 w/v% perfluorocarbon emulsion for human use as corollary angioplasty adjuvant therapy. Hemodynamic responses to hemodilution with intravascular perfluorocarbon emulsions have varied with species and the mechanisms for adverse reactions are better understood now as second generation emulsions containing up to 100 w/v% perfluorocarbon are under development as blood substitutes, imaging agents, and for other therapeutic applications. This report describes the evolution of perfluorocarbon emulsions as blood substitutes by emphasizing oxygen solubility, theology and hemodynamic aspects of the emulsions as they have been applied in experimental laboratory animal and human clinical settings.

In order to replace noble metals and their derivatives, transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni, Mo, Cu,etc.) selenides have demonstrated promising catalysis on both hydrogen and oxygen evolutions. Very recently, a number of reports have presented a variety of approaches to enhance their electrocatalytic activity. This review summarizes the most recent progress in transition metal selenide electrocatalysts for HER, OER, and overall water splitting. The merits and limitations of metal selenides are also discussed in the aspects of structure and composition. Moreover, we highlight new strategies and future challenges for design and synthesis of high performance electrocatalysts.									89	1	0	0	8	0	89			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000544063600004	32514508

Herein, examples of BOS-slag-related research conducted by the present authors are introduced, in addition to a critical review of relevant research reported in the literature. This includes four important topics: 1) slag formation, i.e., dissolution of lime in the BOS slag; 2) in situ observation of high-temperature behavior of BOS slags; 3) transient phenomena in BOS slags due to metal droplet-slag-gas reactions; and 4) energy and material recovery from molten BOS slags. This article aims to provide state-of-the-art understanding and new research ideas on these research topics. An emphasis is placed on methods that seek to in situ probe the evolution of the slag and to document its physical and chemical changes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1611-3683	1869-344X		WOS:000688505500001

The single-phase VO2 (M1) nanoparticles are prepared in the form of uniformly covering the surface of individual carbon fibers constituting a carbon fiber paper (CFP). The VO2 nanoparticles reveal the metal-insulator phase transition at ca. 65 degrees C (heating) and 62 degrees C (cooling) with low thermal hysteresis, indicating a high concentration of structural defect which is considered a grain boundary among VO2 nanoparticles with some particle coalescence. Consequently, the VO2/CFP shows a high electrocatalytic OER activity with the lowest eta(10) (350 mV) and Tafel slope (46 mV/dec) values in a 1 M aqueous solution of KOH as compared to those of the vacuum annealed V2O5 and the hydrothermally grown VO2 (M1), alpha-V2O5, and gamma '-V2O5. The catalytically active site is considered V4+ components and V4+/5+ redox couples in VO2. The oxidation state of V4+ is revealed to be more favorable to the OER catalysis compared to that of V5+ in vanadium oxide through comparative studies. Furthermore, the amount of V5+ component is found to be increased on the surface of VO2 catalyst during the OER, giving rise to the performance degradation. This work suggests V4+ and its redox couple as a novel active component for the OER in metal-oxide electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2079-4991		WOS:000774489600001	35335752

We apply the scheme to model simulations of the laser-assisted O+H -> OH association reaction in an environment. The suggested approach is based on the application of the time-evolution operator to the "closed-system" part of the overall Hamiltonian and transformation of the open-system equation of motion to the Heisenberg picture suitable for numerical propagation. A dual role of the system-environment coupling with respect to the infrared (ir) laser-driven association of OH is demonstrated: the association probability is increased due to the coupling at relatively weak laser fields, but decreased at strong laser fields. Moreover, at a certain strength of the ir laser field, the association probability does not depend on the strength of the system-bath coupling at all.									10	4	0	0	0	0	10			1050-2947	1094-1622		WOS:000262979000119

Metal sulfide nanoparticles (NPs) are potential candidates for such catalysts because of their metallic features and intrinsic high surface area; however, their poor electrocatalytic activity, owing to the presence of surface ligands, is an obstacle to practical use. Here we report the selective synthesis of oleylamine (OAm)-stabilized Ni3S4 (Ni3S4/OAm) NPs. The insulating ligands were exchanged with S2- and loaded on electrodes by a layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly method with metal cation linkers. The enhanced catalytic properties were confirmed by electrochemical measurements. A LbL assembled film with Ni2+ as a linker (11cycles) showed an overpotential of 555mV@-4mAcm(-2) at pH6.8 and a stable current density for 12h. In addition, when this LbL assembly method was applied to a CdS/Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 photocatalyst electrode, the resulting photoelectrode showed an enhanced photocurrent compared with that of the Ni3S4/OAm NPs-spin coated and bare photoelectrodes. These results indicate the versatility of LbL assembly for fabrication of ligand-free NP electrocatalyst films.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2199-692X			WOS:000412650500013

The comparison of this carbonaceous material with graphite and glassy carbon points out the similar behavior in terms of diagnostic parameters and related mechanisms, without the mechanical fragility of these materials. Tafel slopes at different chloride concentrations in solution (from 0.1 to 4 M NaCl in 0.01 M HClO4) and at different pHs have been determined. together with the reaction orders with respect to Cl- and H+.All measurements were carried out at a constant ionic strength. The electrode characterization has been done by means of cyclic voltammetry, showing a detailed picture for the chloride oxidation and the reduction of the evolved chlorine. Significant surface modifications occur when the electrode works as an anode for oxygen evolution, while chlorine evolution does not seem to cause severe changes. As shown by tests carried out following a method suggested in the literature, the faradaic yield for chlorine production is expected to be very high. In dilute chloride media and at neutral-weakly alkaline pH, a faradaic yield of about 65% has been found; this makes use of highly doped diamond electrodes in, e.g., seawater electrolysis, quite promising.

Efficient hydrogen (H-2) generation would offer the possibility of harvesting renewable energy in the form of clean fuels for many applications. To achieve this objective, H-2 generation through hydrolysis of hydrides, electrochemical, and photocatalytic H-2 evolution methods are the most effective, affordable, and clean techniques. On the other hand, recent claims of the high efficiency of ionic liquid-based (nano)catalysts (ILBCs) have inspired significant research regarding the application of these compounds in the production of high purity H-2 through cost-effective and straightforward processes. Herein, we review electrocatalytic and photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction methods, H-2 generation from hydrolysis of hydrides, and the performance of ILBCs in each of these methods. We believe that the contents of this review raise the interest of chemists working on catalysis and inspire more efforts in studying ILBCs. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

At present, one of the main research directions in the field of electrochemical nitrogen fixation is to improve the current efficiency and ammonia yield by developing efficient nitrogen reduction catalysts. To optimise the selectivity and catalytic activity of nitrogen reduction catalysts more efficiently, herein, we systematically summarise the progress of research on nitrogen reduction catalysts in recent years and present some general catalyst design strategies. Considering that it is difficult for metal-based catalysts to balance the competitive reactions of nitrogen activation and hydrogen evolution, we discuss in detail the advantages and application prospects of non-metallic catalysts in electrochemical nitrogen fixation. Moreover, both the design strategy of surface or interface defects, and how this atomic-level control of functionalisation helps to promote selectivity and catalytic activity are also discussed by theoretical and experimental electrochemistry. On this basis, we also discussed the future development direction, opportunities and challenges of nitrogen reduction electrocatalysts.									49	4	0	0	3	0	49			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000479952800001	31120594

Developing bifunctional anode noble-metal-free electrocatalysts towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to boost cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is promising but challenging to meet different reaction media and multiple applications for simultaneous clean energy production and pollution treatment. Herein, a facile one-pot thermal treatment strategy is presented to anchor NiFe nanoclusters (with a size of about 2 nm) on N-doped carbon as bifunctional electrocatalysts for both OER and UOR. Such an electrocatalyst can deliver a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) with a low overpotential of 260 mV and a small Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1) for OER, superior to the state-of-the-art Ru-based materials. Besides, this electrocatalyst also shows excellent activity for UOR with the need for just 1.37 V (vs. RHE) to attain a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). In a two-electrode electrolyzer for both cathodic HER and anodic UOR, only a cell voltage of 1.50 V is required to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is 140 mV lower than that of overall water splitting electrolysis (1.64 V). The excellent electrooxidative performance can be attributed to the improved conductivity, abundant active sites and fast charge transfer and transport benefiting from the ultrafine structure of NiFe clusters and their synergistic effect with N-doped carbon.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000587715700008	32794531

However, there is a great space for further improvement of its electrocatalytic performance since its charge transfer rate and catalytic activity have not reached a satisfactory level. Herein, we design and fabricate a three dimensional urchins like V-doped CoP with different amounts of V-doping on nickel foam electrode. The V-doped CoP/NF electrode with optimized amounts of V-doping (10%) exhibits outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance under universal-pH conditions and preeminent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in alkaline media. Notably, the assembled water-splitting cell displays a cell voltage of only 1.53 V at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) and has excellent durability, much better than many reported related bifunctional catalysts. The experiment results and theoretical analysis revealed that vanadium atoms replace cobalt atoms in CoP lattice. Vanadium doping can not only raise the density of electronic states near the Fermi level enhancing the conductivity of the catalyst, but can also optimize the free energy of hydrogen and oxygen-containing intermediates adsorption over CoP, thus promoting its catalytic activity. Moreover, the unique nanostructure of the catalyst provides the various shortened channels for charge transfer and reactant/electrolyte diffusion, which accelerates the electrocatalytic process. Also, the in situ growth strategy can improve the conductivity and stability of the catalyst.									22	2	0	0	0	0	22			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000620413000002

The electrode composition and morphology were characterized using X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results reveal that the electrode films consist of Ag2O, but some of the Ag+ ions on the {111} crystal facets are oxidized into Ag2+ ions. Furthermore, the Ag2-xO/FTO-1 electrode shows a triangular slice shape of a parallel matrix with a larger exposed area of {111} crystal facets than other Ag2-xO/FTO-i (i = 0.5, 2, 3, 4, or 7) electrodes. Electrocatalytic experiments prove that the Ag2-xO/FTO-1 electrode produces the highest oxidative current density, has an overpotential of 417 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and has a Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 M K2B4O7. Electrochemical impedance spectra indicate that Ag2-xO/FTO-1 electrodes have the best ability for charge transfer. In addition, in the I-t test over 10 h, the current density decreased 4%. Fortunately, both O-O and Ag2+ species were detected after electrocatalysis and a possible mechanism for the oxygen evolution reaction is proposed in which the formation of Ag2+ and O-O species on {111} facets plays a critical role.
