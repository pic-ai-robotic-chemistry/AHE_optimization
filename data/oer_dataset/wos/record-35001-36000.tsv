The photocurrent is found to be largely due to reduction of trace molecular oxygen, which decreases significantly in the presence of an oxygen scavenger. Residual current, <1 mu A cm(-2), is observed in acidic media that may be attributed to proton reduction. The addition of a catalyst to aid proton reduction is achieved through photoelectrochemical deposition of Pt nanoparticles from K2PtCl6. Photocurrents at single layer films in aqueous solution increase significantly and bubble formation is observed on the P3HT film that is confirmed to be hydrogen gas. While the photocurrents produced are smaller than those devices employing sophisticated multilayer architectures, the results hold promise that, with further studies, H-2 can be evolved at technologically-simple single layer systems with substantially higher rates.

The simplest unit present in the OEC that can produce O-2 is a dinuclear oxo-bridged manganese complex within the tetranuclear Mn-4 cluster. In this paper we report a theoretical study of the model complexes [Mn-2(mu-O)(2)(NH3)(6)(H2O)(2)](n+) (n=2-5), for which density functional calculations have been carried out for several electronic configurations. The molecular orbital picture deduced from the calculations indicates that one-electron oxidation of the Mn-2IV,Mn-IV/(O2-)(2) complex (n = 4) mostly affects the oxygen atoms, thus ruling out the existence of a Mn-V oxidation state in this context. while the incipient formation of an O-O bond in the O-2(3-) transient species evolves exothermally toward the dissociation of dioxygen and a Mn-2II,Mn-III couple. These results identify the electronic features that could be needed to enable an intramolecular mechanism of oxygen-oxygen bond formation to exist at the OEC during photosynthesis.									21	0	0	0	3	0	21			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000176075400010	12180329

In this work, a novel strategy is proposed for activity modulation in oxygen reduction electrocatalysis through constructing a heterojunction, which consists of CoN4 embedded graphene and B doped graphene with B concentrations of 3.13 at% and 6.25 at %, termed as BG/B1 and BG/B2 for convenience, respectively. The theoretical results reveal that the B doped graphene alleviates OH poisoning of CoN4 moiety and thereby promotes the activity improvement. As the main indicator of catalytic activity, the overpotential eta values are 0.46 V for BG/B1 and 0.38 V for BG/B2, respectively, which are comparable to the benchmark Pt(111). The underlying regulation mechanism involves the electron redistribution, wherein the electron-deficient B dopant causes electron depletion of the CoN4 embedded gra-phene. More intriguingly, the activity improvement caused by vertical electron transfer is observed for the bi-layers with FeN4 moiety. The similarity between CoN4 and FeN4 implies that the electron-mediated mechanism via the 2D/2D coupling might be a universal strategy for material design. Therefore, the proposed graphene-based heterojunction provides a novel insight into activity modulation in electrocatalysis field.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2468-0230			WOS:000838156900001

Herein, we investigate the dissolution behavior of hexagonal tungsten carbide in acidic media with cyclovoltammetric and galvanostatic procedures under steady-state and dynamic conditions. The tungsten dissolution rate in the electrolyte was monitored in-situ and time resolved via coupling of the scanning flow cell with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (SFC-ICP-MS), allowing a direct correlation of potential and amount of dissolved species. The stability and passivation behavior of tungsten carbide was compared to pristine tungsten metal and its highest oxide WO3 in fuel cell/electrolyzer relevant potential ranges. It was found that partial passivation in the oxygen reduction region takes place, accompanied by steady dissolution of tungsten slightly above these potentials. In the HER/HOR region, no significant dissolution was observed. The dissolution rate of WC at high potentials was found to be in many cases almost one order of magnitude lower than for the pristine metal, yet two orders of magnitude higher than for its corresponding highest oxide.

The rise of atmospheric oxygen occurred in two stages: approximately 2.5 to 2.0 billion years ago during the Great Oxidation Event and roughly 2 billion years later during the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event. We propose that the formation of continents about 2.7 to 2.5 billion years ago, perhaps due to the initiation of plate tectonics, may have led to oxygenation by the following mechanisms. In the first stage, the change in composition of Earth's crust from iron- and magnesium-rich mafic rocks to feldspar- and quartz-rich felsic rocks could have caused a decrease in the oxidative efficiency of the Earth's surface, allowing atmospheric O-2 to rise. Over the next billion years, as carbon steadily accumulated on the continents, metamorphic and magmatic reactions within this growing continental carbon reservoir facilitated a gradual increase in the total long-term input of CO2 to the ocean-atmosphere system. Given that O-2 is produced during organic carbon burial, the increased CO2 input may have triggered a second rise in O-2. A two-step rise in atmospheric O-2 may therefore be a natural consequence of plate tectonics, continent formation and the growth of a crustal carbon reservoir.									106	13	0	0	28	0	115			1752-0894	1752-0908		WOS:000377491600006

Moreover, this is also an urgent requirement for the sustainable development of green technology. Herein, we introduce a simplistic and expandable method to prepare metal-free biomass-derived nitrogen self-doped porous activation carbon (N-PAC) with large specific surface area (S BET = 1300.58 m(2)/g). Moreover, the manufactural electrocatalysts exhibit prominent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in all PH values. As compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst, the N-PAC/800 with a positive onset potential at 10 mA/cm(2) (0.93 V), half-wave potential (0.87 V), and limiting current (6.34 mA/cm(2)) bring to light excellent catalytic stability, selectivity, and much-enhanced methanol tolerance. Furthermore, the prepared electrocatalysts possess considerable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with a less onset potential of 0.218 V (acidic medium) and 0.271 V (alkaline medium) respectively, which can show similar catalytic activity across the whole pH range. Such bifunctional electrocatalyst, with excellent electrocatalytic properties, resource-rich, low cost, and environmental-friendly, hold a promising application in energy conversion and reserve.

Herein, we report nickel-iron diselenide hollow nanochains (denoted as NFSHNCs) synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal method working as the high performance OER catalyst. The formation of well-shaped NFSHNCs is due to the Kirkendall effect, in which NiFe alloy solid nanochains were employed as the precursors. The as-prepared NFSHNCs not only exhibit outstanding OER performance with low overpotential of 267 mV (at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and small Tafel slope of 67 mV dec(-1), superior to the state-of-the-art commercial RuO2, but also deliver high durability with a dinky degradation of 5.3% after 12 h fierce test. To identify the electrocatalytic active sites, the Gibbs free energy differences (Delta G) related to the O* and OH* adsorption on NiFe selenides were calculated with density functional theory. The theoretical results corroborate the fact that the O* and OH* adsorption prefers to occur on both iron sites and the nickel sites (the one that in the vicinity of iron sites) because of the synergistic effects of electron configuration.									91	4	0	0	6	0	93			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000430057000028

Herein, we fabricated a bimetallic Mo/Mn codoped three-phase nickel sulfide on Ni foam, with Mo/Mn-NixSy/NF successfully synthesized via hydrothermal synthesis and calcination. In order to better explore the codoping effect of Mo/Mn, we also synthesised Ni3S2/NF, NiS@Ni0.96S/NF, Mo-Ni3S2/NF and Mn-NiS@Ni0.96S/NF and their electrocatalytic activities (HER, OER, and overall water splitting) were systematically investigated. As expected, Mo/Mn-NixSy/NF catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activities and long-term durability. High electrochemical performance of Mo/Mn-NixSy/NF exceeded that of most reported non-precious metal catalysts and also benchmark RuO2, IrO2 and Pt/C. Moreover, in order to better understand the catalytic process, three possible mechanisms were further proposed to rationalize the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Our work might broaden the avenue to construct efficient non-precious bifunctional catalysts and further develop large-scale electricity-to-hydrogen applications.									35	3	0	0	0	0	35			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000472452900041	30945713	
J	Brouwer, M; Brouwer, TH; Grater, W; Brown-Peterson, N								Replacement of a cytosolic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase by a novel cytosolic manganese superoxide dismutase in crustaceans that use copper (haemocyanin) for oxygen transport								BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL				374				219	228		10.1042/BJ20030272				AUG 15 2003	2003	The blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, which uses the copper-dependent protein haemocyanin for oxygen transport, lacks the ubiquitous cytosolic copper-dependent enzyme copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu,ZnSOD) as evidenced by undetectable levels of Cu,ZnSOD activity, protein and mRNA in the hepatopancreas (the site of haemocyanin synthesis) and gills. Instead, the crab has an unusual cytosolic manganese SOD (cytMnSOD), which is retained in the cytosol, because it lacks a mitochondrial transit peptide. A second familiar MnSOD is present in the mitochondria (mtMnSOD). This unique phenomenon occurs in all Crustacea that use haemocyanin for oxygen transport. Molecular phylogeny analysis suggests the MnSOD gene duplication is as old as the origin of the arthropod phylum. cytMnSOD activity in the hepatopancreas changes during the moulting cycle of the crab. Activity is high in intermoult crabs and non-detectable in postmoult papershell crabs. mtMnSOD is present in all stages of the moulting cycle. Despite the lack of cytCu,ZnSOD, crabs have an extracellular Cu,ZnSOD (ecCu,ZnSOD) that is produced by haemocytes, and is part of a large, approx. 160 kDa, covalently-linked protein complex. ecCu,ZnSOD is absent from the hepatopancreas of intermoult crabs, but appears in this tissue at premoult. However, no ecCu,ZnSOD mRNA can be detected, suggesting that the protein is recruited from the haemolymph. Screening of different taxa of the arthropod phylum for Cu,ZnSOD activity shows that those crustaceans that use haemoglobin for oxygen transport have retained cytCu,ZnSOD. It appears, therefore, that the replacement of cytCu,ZnSOD with cytMnSOD is part of an adaptive response to the dynamic, haemocyanin-linked, fluctuations in copper metabolism that occur during the moulting cycle of the crab.									94	8	0	0	92	2	102			0264-6021			WOS:000184945000025	12769817

The particles were successfully synthesized in a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. The particles were characterized via high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), photoluminescence, energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), and powder X-ray diffraction. The near-infrared-driven photocatalytic activities of such hybrid nanoparticles are remarkably higher than that with bare upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) under the same irradiation. The upconverted photoluminescence of UCNPs efficiently reabsorbed by Cu2O promotes the charge separation in the semiconducting shell, and facilitates the formation of photoinduced electrons and hydroxyl radicals generated via the reaction between H2O and holes. Both serve as reactive species on the dissociation of the weak B-N bond in an aqueous medium, to produce hydrogen under near-infrared excitation, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activities. The photocatalyst of NaGdF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4@Cu2O (UCNPs@Cu2O) suffered no loss of efficacy after several cycles. This work sheds light on the rational design of near-infrared-activated photocatalysts, and can be used as a proof-of-concept for on-board hydrogen generation from ammonia borane under near-infrared illumination, with the aim of green energy suppliers.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2079-4991		WOS:000736669800001	34947585	
J	Hirschi, R; Meynet, G; Maeder, A								Yields of rotating stars at solar metallicity								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				433	3			1013	1022		10.1051/0004-6361:20041554				APR 2005	2005	We present a new set of stellar yields obtained from rotating stellar models at solar metallicity covering the massive star range (12-60 M.). The stellar models were calculated with the latest version of the Geneva stellar evolution code described in Hirschi et al. (2004). Evolution and nucleosynthesis are in general followed up to silicon burning. The yields of our non-rotating models are consistent with other calculations and differences can be understood in the light of the treatment of convection and the rate used for C-12(alpha,gamma)O-16. This verifies the accuracy of our calculations and gives a safe basis for studying the effects of rotation on the yields. The contributions from stellar winds and supernova explosions to the stellar yields are presented separately. We then add the two contributions to compute the total stellar yields. Below similar to 30 M., rotation increases the total metal yields, Z, and in particular the yields of carbon and oxygen by a factor of 1.5-2.5. As a rule of thumb, the yields of a rotating 20 M. star are similar to the yields of a non-rotating 30 M. star, at least for the light elements considered in this work. For very massive stars (similar to 60 M.), rotation increases the yield of helium but does not significantly affect the yields of heavy elements.									98	3	0	0	0	3	100			1432-0746			WOS:000228039100023

In order to prepare this material, first, we generated a polymeric gel using cost-effective and easily accessible precursors such as SnCl4, titanium isopropoxide, and tetrahydrofuran (THF). A small amount of triflic acid was used to initiate THF polymerization. The calcination of the resulting gel at 500 degrees C produced a Sn-Ti bimetallic nanocomposite. This newly synthesized Sn0.39Ti0.61O2 center dot TiO2 was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and UV-visible spectroscopy. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) studies were performed for the first time using Sn0.39Ti0.61O2 center dot TiO2 coated over fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) under simulated 1 sun solar radiation. The chronoamperometric study of the Sn0.39Ti0.61O2 center dot TiO2/FTO revealed the repeatable and substantially higher photocurrent for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) when compared to only TiO2. Moreover, the synthesized material exhibited high stability both in the presence and absence of light. The photocatalytic studies suggested that the sol-gel-synthesized Sn0.39Ti0.61O2 center dot TiO2 can be efficiently used as a photoanode in the water-splitting reaction.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2470-1343			WOS:000523299700019	32258875

Py-GC/MS was performed to analyze products distribution. The results show that the maximum weight loss rate peak appears at about 457???C. There are strong correlations between CO2 and CO, C=O and C=C functional groups, CH4 and C-H functional groups, SO2 and S=O functional groups. Through comparative analysis of two isothermal retorting experiments, the secondary reactions of the retorting products of Gonghe oil shale play the leading role in the constant temperature section. 520???C gives more complete volatilization and desulfurization than 470???C. Py-GC/MS analysis shows that the higher the temperature, the lower the content of saturated hydrocarbons and oxygen-containing heteroatom compounds, and the higher the content of unsatu-rated hydrocarbons.

However, pristine Ni3N has unsatisfactory performance in these devices because of limited electrochemical active sites. Revitalizing the morphology and modulation of the electronic structure by introducing defects or heterostructures have been proven effective in enhancing the performance of Ni3N electrode in both EES and ECS. This review will first provide an overview of the recent development of transition metal nitrides in energy application in comparison with other types of electrodes. Then, the general synthesis, electrochemical properties, modification strategies, and operating mechanism of Ni3N in energy storage devices and electrocatalysis are elaborated in detail. The associated challenges and possible mitigation in energy storage and electrocatalysis are also discussed.

However, the slow kinetics caused by the difficulty of N N bond activation and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction hinder the development and application of electrochemical nitrogen reduction. Herein, we synthesized a metal-free electrocatalyst of B, O-decorated carbon microspheres (B,O-CMS) by a hydrothermal method using nitrogen-free raw materials. The doping of B increases the specific surface area, induces abundant microporous structure and adjusts the electronic structure of the materials. As a result, in 0.1 M HCl, B,O-CMS achieves a high V-NH3 of 19.2 mg h(-1) mg(-1) cat. and a high FE of 5.57% at -0.25 V vs. RHE, along with outstanding selectivity for NH3 production and stability. This work provides an effective approach to rationally design high-performance metal-free catalysts for NRR by doping heteroatoms into carbon materials. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The CoNx/NGA nanohybrid with hierarchical porous strucuture guarantees the superior activities toward ORR, OER and HER, due to abundant dual active CoNx. and NxC sites. Impressively, it also exhibits a long lifetime and exceptionally high electrochemical performances as a cathode and an anode in a two-electrode overall water splitting electrolyzer, and also as an air-cathode in a rechargeable Zn-air battery. In addition, the CoNx/NGA-based water splitting electrolyzer and two Zn-air batteries can be integrated together to effectively self-drive electrochemical water splitting device with high gas evolution rates of 186 and 372 mu mol h(-1) for O-2 and H-2, respectively.

J	Kovtyukhova, Nina I.								Toward understanding of the propulsion mechanism of rod-shaped nanoparticles that catalyze gas-generating reactions								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				112	15			6049	6056		10.1021/jp710594w				APR 17 2008	2008	There is no consensus in the literature on the propulsion mechanism of rod-shaped nanomotors that catalyze hydrogen peroxide decomposition to oxygen and water. Historically, the directional motion was discovered with bimetallic nanorods,(1,2) and the related asymmetry of catalytic rod surface has been taken as a necessary condition of self-propulsion in all of the mechanisms proposed to date. This study for the first time demonstrates that hydrodynamic behavior of monocomponent catalytic nanorods in a H2O2 solution is similar to that of the bicomponent ones, and hence, the surface chemical asymmetry is unlikely to be a governing factor in the rods self-propulsion. The experimental results have shown that oxygen bubbles' evolution from the rod surface and related gravitational forces alone can drive directional motion of the rods. A new model is proposed that is based on the gravitational forces and considers rod motion in the 3D space. Nonparallel rods orientation relative to the horizontal plane has been found to play a major role in rods propulsion. Momentum exchange between such a "tilted" rod and water flux, caused by the oxygen bubbles' departure, drives the rod propulsion. The proposed mechanism provides a reasonable explanation for all behavior patterns of the nanorod motors. Motility of Pt and Rh nanorods was studied in the rod length range of 2-7 mu m and the H2O2 concentration range of 3-30 wt %. Confocal microscopy was used to estimate nanorods orientation relative to the horizontal plane.									38	1	0	0	1	0	39			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000254883100051

AMnO3+x perovskites showed after preparation an oxidative non-stoichiometry. Oxygen desorption analysis revealed for the four manganites different desorption steps occurring between 930 and 1370 K. Stoichiometry was reached after the first desorption step. Heating the samples at temperatures above 1300 K resulted in phase segregation to the simple oxides. AFeO3+x perovskites were more stable towards thermal decomposition than the Mn-perovskites, showing no oxygen evolution up to 1400 K. The reducibility of these perovskites in hydrogen correlated inversely with the relative effective ionic radii of the trivalent rare-earth cations. Comparative catalytic studies were carried out in a fixed-bed microreactor at atmospheric pressure in the temperature range 600-1200 K. The activities at 770 K, expressed as reaction rates referred to the BET surface area, varied between 1.4 x 10(-7) and 2.9 x 10(-7) mol s-1 m-2 for the AMnO3+x, and between 1.1 x 10(-7) and 1.6 x 10(-7) mol S-1 M-2 for the AFeO3+x perovskites.									67	2	1	0	0	0	68			1011-372X			WOS:A1994NL54900007

Potassium carbonate (K2CO3), calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)(2)) and iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3) were employed as precursors of the catalysts and compared to the Raw-form (no catalyst added) to investigate the effects of potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and iron (Fe) on pyrolysis and combustion. Pyrolysis tests were carried out in 100% N-2 and 100% CO2 ambient conditions which are the main diluting gases in air and oxy-fuel combustion. These experiments revealed that the major difference between pyrolysis in these two ambient conditions was observed above 720 degrees C and DTG (Derivative Thermogravimetric) profiles experienced sharp peaks at 785 degrees C in 100% CO2 which can be attributed to a char-CO2 gasification reaction. Furthermore, K2CO3 was found to be the most effective catalyst in the char gasification reaction during pyrolysis tests in 100% CO2. Combustion experiments were carried out in various oxygen concentrations from 21% to 35% O-2 in N-2 and CO2 ambient conditions. Combustion tests carried out in O-2/CO2 ambient conditions revealed that for 30% and 35% O-2, the relative active sequence of catalysts to the reaction rates of devolatilization can be described as Fe >> K > Ca > Raw-form, and Fe > Ca > Raw-form >> K respectively. Furthermore, potassium catalyst had the best char reactivity due to its much higher reaction rates for all oxygen concentrations. The burnout temperature (T-b) also experienced a significant drop in the case of the K-based catalyst. Finally, emission profiles of the evolved gases, CO2, CO, H2O, SOx and COS, were analyzed during pyrolysis tests in both N-2 and CO2 ambient conditions using the FTIR method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a novel strategy based on controllable in situ surface engineering and morphology was developed to synergistically boost the catalytic activity of CN by tuning the hydroxyl groups on its surface and constructing a unique nanostructure. The controllable introduction of hydroxyl groups on CN nanoshells, prepared by the thermal condensation of oxygen-containing supramolecular precursors formed in water, led to spatial separation of the HOMO and LUMO, and effective exciton dissociation, as verified by experiments and ab initio calculations. Furthermore, the hollow hemispherical nanoshell endowed more exposed active sites, optimal mass transport, and dynamic modulations. The optimized hollow hemispherical CN nanoshells exhibited remarkable catalytic activity, with a photoelectrocatalytic OER overpotential of about 330 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming state-of-the-art precious-metal catalyst IrO2. High activity for the visible-light photocatalytic HER and pollutant degradation were also observed. This study proposes that, through rational surface group modification, a polymer material with high catalytic activity can be practically realized, which is promising for the design of efficient metal-free catalysts.									36	4	0	0	3	0	37			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000485971900024	31436768

To overcome this problem, the in-situ constructed interfaces of Pt-Co alloy and amorphous cobalt oxide (CoOx) on the carbon powder are designed. The amorphous CoOx at Pt-Co/CoOx interfaces not only provide active sites for water dissociation to facilitate Volmer step, but also produce the strong electronic transfer with Pt-Co. Accordingly, the obtained interfacial catalysts exhibit outstanding alkaline HER performance with a Tafel slope of 29.3 mV.dec(-1) and an ultralow overpotential of only 28 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that the electronic accumulation on the interfacial Co atom in Pt-Co/CoOx constructing the novel active site for water dissociation. Compared to the Pt-Co, all of the energy barriers for water adsorption, water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption/desorption are reduced in Pt-Co/CoOx interfaces, suggesting a boosted HER kinetics for alkaline HER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000747662300001

In this study, biologically treated effluent from pulp and paper mill (BTEPM) has been examined by iron-carbon micro-electrolysis coupled with H2O2 (ICME-H2O2). Under the optimal treatment conditions (Fe/C = 1:2.5, pH = 2.5, 100 min reaction, 9 mmol/L H2O2 added in three aliquots), the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency attained 81% which is much more efficient than ICME without H2O2 under its optimal experimental conditions (42%). In addition, the initial biodegradability of BTEPM, as shown by BOD5/COD ratio, can be enhanced after treatment. The morphology and content of iron and the evolution of H2O2 content in the system under the optimal operating parameters were studied.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-3994	1944-3986		WOS:000565811400021

Acetaldehyde acts as a bridging compound to form modified tannins and polymeric pigments that are less likely to form tannin-protein complexes than unmodified tannins. Red wines are often treated with oxygen in order to yield acetaldehyde, however this approach can lead to unintended consequences due to the generation of reactive oxygen species. The present study employs exogenous acetaldehyde at relatively low and high treatment concentrations during fermentation to encourage tannin modification without promoting potentially deleterious oxidation reactions. The high acetaldehyde treatment significantly increased polymeric pigments in the wine without increasing concentrations of free and sulfite-bound acetaldehyde. Protein tannin precipitation was also significantly decreased with the addition of exogenous acetaldehyde. These results indicate a possible treatment of wines early in their production to increase color stability and lower astringency of finished wines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we go beyond vacuum studies and investigate the morphological evolution of a CoOx/Au(111) model system from intermediate to high pressures of H2O vapor by means of scanning tunneling microscopy and near-ambient pressure and vacuum X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. At elevated H2O pressure, we describe the formation of a well-defined Co(OH)(2) nanoisland morphology with cobalt in the +2 oxidation state. In contrast, the presence of O-2, in air and liquid water, results in only partially hydroxylated Co3+ phases comprising sheets of the CoO(OHx) trilayer, corresponding to a single sheet of cobalt(III)oxyhydroxide. We conclude that the oxyhydroxide structure, known to be the catalytically active phase for the oxygen evolution reaction, is stabilized by aerobic conditions, which inhibits further transformation into the catalytically inactive cobalt(II)hydroxide.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1932-7447			WOS:000464768600077

The structural, redox, acidic and adsorption properties were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), BET, H-2 temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), temperature programmed desorption of NO in the presence of oxygen (NO-TPD) and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). The results have shown good catalytic activity for CuO/Ce0,62Zr0,38O2 in NO oxidation to NO2. Species such as nitrites and nitrates were formed on the surface. The transformation of nitrite compounds into nitrate was observed above 200 A degrees C. From 300 up to 400 A degrees C, decomposition of the surface nitrate to nitrite was discerned. Ammonia was adsorbed on the Lewis and Bronsted acid sites on Cu/CZ catalyst surface during temperature programmed reactions.

Here, we employ focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy to examine the microstructural evolution of bare nickel-based yttrium-stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ) electrode (reference cell) and Gd-doped CeO2 (CGO)-infiltrated Ni/YSZ electrode (optimized cell) before and after 100-h durability test. The initial current density of the optimized cell was 1.16 A cm(-2) (at 1.3 V), which was 1.5 times larger than that of the reference cell. The voltage of the reference cell degraded dramatically due to a 1.16% reduction in the volume fraction of Ni, while the optimized cell showed a negligible degradation with a minor change in the volume fraction of Ni. It was confirmed that CGO nanoparticles formed a protective layer on the Ni surface during the electrolysis process, which prevented further evaporation of Ni. Overall, the infiltration of CGO into traditional Ni/YSZ electrode prevented decrease in the triple-phase boundary density and reduced the resistance by providing additional active sites for hydrogen evolution reaction. We believe that this work provides an efficient strategy for developing high-performance and long-term stable SOECs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000626374500001

In order to address this aforementioned challenge, a powerful tool with nanoscale resolution named photo-induced force microscopy was applied to map the chemical group distribution in the cross section of stabilized PAN fibers and reveal the evolution mechanism of skin-core structure throughout the whole stabilization process. The results indicated that the formation of skin-core structure of stabilized PAN fiber was attributed to the complex and overlapped chemical reactions caused by gradient of oxygen along radial direction and the formation of dense crystal layer at the interface between the skin and core part.

In particular, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and few-layered graphene (FLG) were covalently functionalized by a microwave-assisted cyclo-addition with nitrile oxides to form metal-binding isoxazoline functional groups with high densities. The covalent attachment was evidenced by Raman spectroscopy, and the chemical identity of the surface functional groups was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The functional carbon nanomaterials effectively chelate precious metals Ir(III), Pt(II), and Ru(III), as well as earth-abundant metals such as Ni(II), to afford materials with metal contents as high as 3.0 atom %. The molecularly dispersed nature of the catalysts was confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) elemental mapping. The interplay between the chelate structure on the graphene surface and its metal binding ability has also been investigated by a combination of experimental and computational studies. The defined ligands on the graphene surfaces enable the formation of structurally precise heterogeneous molecular catalysts. The direct attachment of the isoxazoline functional group on the graphene surfaces provides strong electronic coupling between the chelated metal species and the conductive carbon nanomaterial support. We demonstrate that the metal-chelated carbon nanomaterials are effective heterogeneous catalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction with low overpotentials and tunable catalytic activity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000674321800046	34213315

Crau) were grown from seedlings in controlled conditions and then subjected to an edaphic drought by withholding watering. A strong reduction of leaf gas exchange due to stomatal closure in the early stage of water deficit (0 to -1.2 MPa) was observed. Chlorophyll a measurements demonstrated that the photochemistry of PSII, the light driven electron transport and enzymatic reactions requiring ATP and NADPH in chloroplasts were not affected by plant water status. Moreover, oxygen evolution showed that the capacity of the photosynthetic apparatus was not altered by the stress. The results suggest that the biochemistry of photosynthesis was unaffected by an edaphic drought in white clover. The photosynthetic activity is probably limited by a reduction of CO2 allocation to chloroplasts.									21	1	0	0	20	0	23			0981-9428			WOS:A1995QB59600003

DETONATION IGNITION								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				695	2			1244	1256		10.1088/0004-637X/695/2/1244				APR 20 2009	2009	Observational evidences point to a common explosion mechanism of Type Ia supernovae based on a delayed detonation of a white dwarf (WD). Although several scenarios have been proposed and explored by means of one, two, and three-dimensional simulations, the key point still is the understanding of the conditions under which a stable detonation can form in a destabilized WD. One of the possibilities that have been invoked is that an inefficient deflagration leads to the pulsation of a Chandrasekhar-mass WD, followed by formation of an accretion shock around a carbon-oxygen rich core. The accretion shock confines the core and transforms kinetic energy from the collapsing halo into thermal energy of the core, until an inward moving detonation is formed. This chain of events has been termed Pulsating Reverse Detonation (PRD). In this work we explore the robustness of the detonation ignition for different PRD models characterized by the amount of mass burned during the deflagration phase, M(defl). The evolution of the WD up to the formation of the accretion shock has been followed with a three-dimensional hydrodynamical code with nuclear reactions turned off. We found that detonation conditions are achieved for a wide range of Mdefl. However, if the nuclear energy released during the deflagration phase is close to the WD binding energy (similar to 0.46 x 10(51) erg double right arrow M(defl) similar to 0.30 M(circle dot)) the accretion shock cannot heat and confine the core efficiently and detonation conditions are not robustly achieved.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			0004-637X			WOS:000265018300042

Herein, we demonstrate that, via simple laser scribing, isostructural metal-organic frameworks can be readily transformed into ultrasmall nanoparticles (5-14 nm) with different elemental compositions embedded in conductive carbon support. We found that the formation kinetics of nanoparticles is controlled by the thermodynamic reducibility of metal ions in the metal-organic framework as well as the cooling rate. This method allowed us to precisely tune the particle size and uniformity as well as the composition. As a potential application of the produced nanoparticles, we evaluated the electrocatalytic behavior of the Ni nanoparticles embedded in carbon support. It exhibited excellent performance and stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction in both acid and alkaline electrolytes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000663712300001

Herein, the activation-induced changes in material properties of a nanoporous Ag0.03Au0.97 alloy and their subsequent evolution under steady-state CH3OH oxidation conditions are investigated. Activation using O-3 results in AgO and Au2O3, strongly enriching the near-surface region in Ag. These oxides reduce in the O-2/CH3OH mixture, yielding CO2 and producing a highly Ag-enriched surface alloy. At the reaction temperature (423 K), Ag realloys gradually with Au but remains enriched (stabilized by surface O) in the top few nanometers, producing methyl formate selectively without significant deactivation. At higher temperatures, bulk diffusion induces sintering and Ag redistribution, leading to a loss of activity. These findings demonstrate that material properties determining catalytic activity are dynamic and that metastable (kinetically trapped) forms of the material may be responsible for catalysis, providing guiding principles concerning the activation of heterogeneous catalysts for selective oxidation.

We propose B-N-co-doped graphitic 2D carbon nanostructures impregnated with controlled amount of transition metals (M-BCN; M=Co, Ni, Fe, Cu) as bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts. Co-BCN outperformed the Ni-, Fe-, Cu-based BCN catalysts exhibiting potential values of 0.87 V and 1.62 V at -1 mA/cm(2) and 10 mA/cm(2) during ORR and OER, respectively. Importantly, Co-BCN shows bifunctional cyclic stability (Delta eta; E-OER-E-ORR=0.75 V) of up to 300 cycles in 1 M KOH for a duration of 20 h with total activity loss of only 10.2 % (ORR) and 6.2 % (OER), respectively. A low loading of the metal precursors was used to preserve porosity and to facilitate the formation of metal nanoparticles or M-NxB/C type species embedded in the graphitic carbon layers. The B-N-co-doped graphitic layers also protect the embedded metal nanoparticles explaining the observed long-term stability.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-0216			WOS:000664219100019

The results show that the effects of different ladle usages on the cleanliness of the steel differ from each other. The total oxygen content of steel increases with the decreasing glaze basicity. Ladle glaze having a lower basicity has a more negative impact on the cleanliness of steel in the subsequent production. Inclusions can be generated by the flush-off of ladle glaze, and the initial glaze is important in the evolution of inclusions in the subsequent heats. To avoid the negative effect of ladle usage and to improve the steel cleanliness as much as possible, specialized ladles were suggested for producing high-quality steel grades.

Daily temperature variation differs between microhabitats, which means that subpopulations of the same species may respond differently to temperature. The aim of this study is to determine how physiological responses to temperature of the limpet Cellana tramoserica differ between limpets from variable and from stable thermal environments. Oxygen consumption and anaerobic and aerobic metabolic capacities were measured over a range of temperatures in limpets from thermally stable and variable field sites in summer and winter, and in laboratory acclimation treatments. Limpets from both variable and stable sites, showed acclimatisation of anaerobic and aerobic potentials. Limpets from stable environments, but not from variable environments, showed increased oxygen consumption in winter. Comparison of field and laboratory data showed that temperature was the signal for acclimatisation. The physiological response of C. tramoserica to temperature depends on season and microhabitat. Care must therefore be taken when conducting interspecies comparisons of response to temperature to address the confounding effects of phenotypic plasticity. Differences in physiological response to temperature in phenotypically flexible species like C. tramoserica may simply reflect individual reactions to immediate environmental conditions.

Herein, theoretical simulations first disclose the charge transfer trend and reinforced inherent electron conduction around the epitaxial heterointerface between Ru clusters and Ni3N substrate (cRu-Ni3N), thus leading to the optimized adsorption behaviors and reduced activation energy barriers. Subsequently, the defect-rich nanosheets with the epitaxially grown cRu-Ni3N heterointerface are successfully constructed. Impressively, by virtue of the superiority of intrinsic activity and reaction kinetics, such unique epitaxial heterostructure exhibits remarkable bifunctional catalytic activity toward electrocatalytic OER (226 mV @ 20 mA cm(-2)) and HER (32 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline media. Furthermore, it also shows great application prospect in alkaline freshwater and seawater splitting, as well as solar-to-hydrogen integrated system. This work could provide beneficial enlightenment for the establishment of advanced electrocatalysts with epitaxial heterointerfaces.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2575-0356		WOS:000789506500001

Material crystal structure is a critical factor in governing catalytic activity, but is often neglected in designing degradation electrodes. Here, we investigate the role of crystal structure using six different Ir-oxides with three different crystal structures in electrochemical degradation. Hollandite structure (KxIrO2 and K-1.6(Mn0.78Ir0.22)(8)O-16) with 2 x 2 tunnel size obtains higher removal performance than that of other structure oxides, such as packed pyrochlore (Pb2Ir2O6.5 and Bi2Ir2O7) and rutile (IrO2 and Cu0.3Ir0.7O sigma). Catalysts with same crystal structure show similar morphology features and have almost same degradation performance, although their electrochemical properties are quite different. The presence of tunnel structure in oxides may be responsible for excellent degradation performance of corresponding catalysts. Additionally, tunnel structure oxides with good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity can reduce the energy consumption due to low cell potential. Our findings bring an opportunity for developing new catalysts for electrochemical treatment technologies. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Knowledge of practical limits for this process can help researchers assess their technology and guide future directions. We develop a model to quantify loss mechanisms in PEC water splitting based on the current state of materials research and calculate maximum solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies along with associated optimal absorber band gaps. Various absorber configurations are modeled considering the major loss mechanisms in PEC devices. Quantitative sensitivity analyses for each loss mechanism and each absorber configuration show a profound impact of both on the resulting STH efficiencies, which can reach upwards of 25% for the highest performance materials in a dual stacked configuration. Higher efficiencies could be reached as improved materials are developed. The results of the modeling also identify and quantify approaches that can improve system performance when working with imperfect materials.									160	3	0	0	12	0	161			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000336249400018	24692256

Studies on corrosion resistance and electrochemical behavior of Pb-Sb-As-S alloys as positive grids in lead-acid batteries								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE				2	9			700	720						SEP 2007	2007	The effects of sulfur addition in the range of 0.003-0.01wt.% on the corrosion resistance, electrochemical properties and gas evolution of Pb-Sb-As-S alloy in sulfuric acid solution were investigated by Linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, weight loss measurements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, chronoamperometry and scanning electron microscopy at room temperature. Sulfur added to lead alloy shifts the corrosion potential to negative values. Both oxygen and hydrogen evolution overpotentials were found to be higher for the alloys containing sulfur respect to samples without sulfur. The structures of low-antimony-arsenic alloy surfaces doped by sulfur were studied by using SEM. The experimental results show that, sulfur added to Pb-Sb-As alloy inhibits the growth of the anodic beta-PbO2 film and increases the reaction resistance. Impedance spectroscopy measurements showed that the sulfur addition decreased the conductivity of beta-PbO2 film on the lead alloy. In addition, the effect of sulfur on the hardness of the positive grids and batteries discharge capacities made of these grids was studied.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			1452-3981			WOS:000256381600005

The resistivity of the films was found to be dependent on the chemical composition and structure of the films. Postdeposition annealing (PDA) generally decreased the resistivity of the HfCxNy films. The elimination of residual carbon and oxygen through the evolution of CO2 gases and the formation of a HfxCy phase in the film by PDA were the main reasons for the decreased resistivity. The HfxCy phase in the film contributed to the electrical conductivity, whereas most of the HfxNy in the film existed as an insulating phase (Hf3N4). The introduction of a N-2/H-2 reduction gas during film growth reduced the oxygen concentration in the film. However, the addition of NH3 gas suppressed the formation of HfxCy and produced an insulating Hf3N4.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000261209800079

In this present study, the reaction of Mn(CH3COO)(2)center dot 4H(2)O with the novel ligand (2-([2,2':6',2 ''-terpyridin]-4'-yl)quinoline-8-ol) (8hq-tpy) affords a dinuclear manganese complex, [Mn-II(8hq-tpy)(H2O)](2)(PF6)(2) (Mn 1). Various spectroscopic techniques have been implemented for characterization purposes, and Mn 1 is employed as electrocatalysts towards water oxidation catalysis in the aqueous medium. Electrocatalytic responses in the aqueous medium at pH 6.0 lead to the electrodeposition of heterogeneous species (MnOx) which enables the oxidation event at an applied potential of 1.24 V vs. NHE with O-2 liberation of 50.2 mu mol/L.

For the cathodic processes, the addition of ATA slows down markedly the reduction reaction of dissolved oxygen, and the cathodic process is controlled merely by the hydrogen evolution. Besides, ATA inhibits efficiently the hydrogen evolution itself when the kinetics parameters were evaluated from a non-linear regression calculation according to Levich-Koutecky relationship. For the anodic processes, the addition of ATA suppressed completely the current peak observed at the active-passive transition revealed in its absence, and the passive current plateau is observed directly from the corrosion potential. Therefore, the addition of ATA reduces both the anodic and the cathodic partial currents of the corrosion process. The inhibiting efficiency of ATA is high, more than 98%, and even enhanced in presence of ammoniac. It was found also that this inhibiting effect increased with the immersion period.

However, the exploration of transition metal-based aerogels with core-shell architectures remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report a one-step auto-programmed synthesis method to generate a core-shell Cu@Fe@Ni metallic aerogel. Electroactivating (EA) the core-shell Cu@Fe@Ni causes the Fe inner shell to migrate into the Ni outer shell and forms a highly-active catalytic hydroxide on the surface of the aerogel. The resulting EA-Cu@Fe@Ni catalysts exhibited a low OER overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is much smaller than bimetallic CuNi (320 mV), CuFe (390 mV), and RuO2 (271 mV). In-situ Raman measurements confirm that the catalyst's outer layer is composed of NiOOH doped with Fe during the electrochemical activation process, resulting in the high OER performance. This work describes the first example of a trimetallic core-shell aerogel synthesized in one step and enables another strategy for designing highly active metals/metal oxide electrocatalysts via surface reconstruction.									23	1	0	0	1	0	24			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000620327500001

Gaggioli, Carlo Alberto/0000-0001-9105-8731; Ray, Debmalya/0000-0002-8309-8183			Cu[Ni(2,3-pyrazinedithiolate)(2)] Metal-Organic Framework for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				13	29			34419	34427		10.1021/acsami.1c08998		JUL 2021		JUL 28 2021	2021	The application of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as electrocatalysts for small molecule activation has been an emerging topic of research. Previous studies have suggested that two-dimensional (2D) dithiolene-based MOFs are among the most active for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a three-dimensional (3D) dithiolene-based MOF, Cu[Ni(2,3-pyrazinedithiolate)(2)] (1), is evaluated as an electrocatalyst for the HER. In pH 1.3 aqueous electrolyte solution, 1 exhibits a catalytic onset at -0.43 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), an overpotential (eta(10mA/cm2)) of 0.53 V to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), and a Tafel slope of 69.0 mV/dec. Interestingly, under controlled potential electrolysis, 1 undergoes an activation process that results in a more active catalyst with a 200 mV reduction in the catalytic onset and.10 mA/cm(2). It is proposed that the activation process is a result of the cleavage of Cu-N bonds in the presence of protons and electrons. This hypothesis is supported by various experimental studies and density functional theory calculations.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000679917500066	34275268

High potentials inducing carbon corrosion reaction cause electrode thinning, make the supporting carbon structure less porous, decrease the electrochemical surface area (ECSA), and dehydrate the ionomer, leading to fast performance decay in the cell. Particularly, in this work, we discuss the main cause of performance decay in PEMFCs in view of the structural deformation of supporting carbon using the ionic resistance and double layer capacitance in non-faradaic impedance and charge transfer resistance in faradaic impedance to elucidate the different degradation behaviors of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) under saturated and low humidity (RH 30%) conditions. As a result, it is confirmed that carbon corrosion severely changes the structural properties of the supporting carbon, such as pore depth and circumference, and the specific pore deformation with the evolution of oxygen-containing functional groups on the carbon surfaces subordinately induces the severe degradation in cell performance with the water drainage issues, namely, flooding.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000664795500001

Herein, we have designed and developed a NiCo-based NiCo-MOF-Phosphide (NiCo-MOF-P) as a multifunctional electrocatalyst via electrodeposition and phosphorization approach. The structurally and electronically modified NiCo-MOF-P can significantly boost the electrocatalytic activity towards urea-assisted water splitting. The optimized electrocatalyst exhibits a lower overpotential of 230 mV for OER and delivered a current density 10 mA cm-2 at applied potential of 1.33 V for UOR. When, catalyst was used as cathode and anode, it requires a cell voltage of 1.45 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm-2 for urea-assisted full water splitting (230 mV less than that of urea free counterpart) with remarkable long time stability. The NiCo-MOF-P also exhibits an overpotential 191 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for HER in an alkaline medium.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000870760100001

In this study, the electrodeposition method was used to coat four different metal meshes with three-dimensional nickel porous structures using hydrogen bubbles as a template. The significant influence of the metal substrates on the morphology of deposited nickel was demonstrated. 3D porous structures formed on nickel, iron, copper, and titanium meshes via the hydrogen bubble template method varied significantly. It was found that differences in the physical adsorption of hydrogen and electrochemical hydrogen evolution on metal substrates are the fundamental reasons behind the diverse morphology of the coatings. Lattice matching of the substrate and the active material also plays an important role during the electrodeposition process. Electrocatalytic performance of the newly prepared materials in water electrolysis was evaluated using the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). The results demonstrate the high electrocatalytic activity of Ni/FeM in the OER and HER, and the good stability of Ni/TiM in HER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000810093100001	35695272

It is found that the appropriate Nafion loading in the oxygen electrode (i.e., 0.5 and 1.0 mg/cm(2)) can increase the electrochemically active area and decrease resistance of electrocatalyst layer. The decrease in working voltage for water electrolyzer with 0.5 and 1.0 mg/cm(2) Nafion loading was 0.23 and 0.19 V at a current density of 1A/cm(2,) compared with that of water electrolyzer without Nafion loading (2.25V)									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1480-2422			WOS:000326710700004

Herein, we demonstrate that the ultrathin FeP nanosheets (FeP-I NS) with abundant mesoporosity and phosphate dopants can be facilely synthesized using ultrathin gamma-Fe2O3 NS as precursors. The as-prepared catalyst displays good HER catalytic activity with an low overpotential (eta) of 95/160 mV at the current densities of 10/100 mAcm 2 and small Tafel slope of 41 mVdec 1 as well as good stability during a period of 24 h in acid media. Additional experimental results reveal that the unique structural features of FeP-I NS (i. e., ultrathin morphology, abundant mesoporosity, local structural distortion and amorphous domains) are key factors for achieving good HER activity. The computational studies demonstrate that the phosphate dopants (i. e., Fe2P2O7) contribute to the superior catalytic performance of FeP by reducing the Gibbs free energy of intermediate H* adsorption (Delta G(H)*) to the catalyst surface as well as by tailoring the electronic properties of the catalyst.									13	1	0	0	1	0	14			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000472232800014

By combining cyclic voltammetry and in-operando surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy along with MD simulations and DFT calculations, their respective surface attachment, redox chemistry and activity toward electrocatalytic oxygen reduction was investigated. For both porphyrin complexes, it could be shown that catalytic activity is restricted to the first (few) molecular layer(s), although electrodes covered with thiophene-substituted complexes showed a better capability to consume the oxygen at a given overpotential even in thicker films. The spectroscopic data and simulations suggest that both porphyrin complexes attach to a Ag electrode surface in a way that maximum planarity and minimum distance between the catalytic iron site and the electrode is achieved. However, due to the distinctive design of the FeT3ThP complex, the thiophene rings are capable of occupying a conformation, via rotation around the bonding axis to the porphyrin, in which all four sulfur atoms can coordinate to the Ag surface. This effect creates a dense and planar surface coverage of the porphyrin on the electrode facilitating a fast (multi) electron transfer via several covalent Ag-S bonds. In contrast, bulky mesityl groups as peripheral substituents, which have been initially introduced to prevent aggregation and improve catalytic behavior in solution, exert a negative effect on the overall electrocatalytic performance in the immobilized state as a less dense coverage and less stable interactions with the surface are formed. Our results underline the importance of rationally designed heterogenized molecular catalysts to achieve optimal turnover, which not only strictly applies to the here discussed oxygen reduction reaction but eventually holds also true for other energy conversion reactions such as carbon dioxide reduction.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000482173300024	31385516

Two experiments at fixed temperatures of 30 and 40 degrees C, and a third experiment alternating temperatures of 40 and 15 degrees C every 12 h were carried out. The must from grapes dried at 40 degrees C presented the reddest color, and the highest anthocyanin concentration and antioxidant activity. A possible hypothesis could be that the high temperature induced a continuous water evaporation from the grapes, preventing the oxygen entry. At the same time, the dehydration resulted in broken skins, which facilitated the transfer of colored compounds to the pulp, increasing the red color of the musts. However, when the temperature dropped, oxygen could penetrate through the skin and the browning reactions started. As a result, the must obtained from gra pes dehydrated by alternating high and low temperatures presented the least anthocyanin content and the least red color.									16	1	0	0	7	1	18			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000340080100031	25030077

Most research has focused on clarifying the exclusive properties of the materials; however, only limited reports have described the biomedical applications of 2D nanomaterials. 2D MXenes are monolayer atomic nanosheets resulting from MAX phase ceramics. The hydrophilic properties, metallic conductivity, stability, and exclusive physiochemical performances make them promising materials for electrochemical and biomedical applications, including CO2 reduction, H-2 evolution, energy conversion and storage, supercapacitors, stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems, regenerative medicine, and photothermal cancer therapy. In this review paper, we have provided facile approaches to synthesising MXene and characterization of chemical and physical properties. Their potential applications in medicine, ranging from antibacterial agents to targeted drug delivery, cancer photo/chemotherapy, tissue engineering, and electrochemical applications, have not been comprehensively reviewed and discussed-which encouraged us to come up with this work. We also discuss the most common challenges of utilizing MXene-related materials and areas that can be further developed in the future, with possible struggles and limitations one may face.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2051-8153	2051-8161		WOS:000860889500001

Herein, we synthesized g-C3N4 combined with PtNix, which shows much higher photocatalytic activity than that of pure g-C3N4 and achieves the highest H-2 evolution rate of 8456 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) for 2.5% PtNix/g-C3N4. The excellent photocatalytic activity resulted from the enhanced charge-separation efficiency compared to the pristine g-C3N4, which was proved by surface photovoltage, photoluminescence, and transient photovoltage spectra. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the dark further confirms the ability of charge transfer of 2.5% PtNix/g-C3N4 is superior to that of pure g-C3N4. This effective separation efficiency gives rise to the observed excellent photocatalytic activity. This study not only provides us with an efficient catalyst for water splitting, but opens new avenues for designing and developing platinum-based photocatalysts.									38	1	0	0	0	0	38			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000412656600020

However, major challenges still have to be overcome before commercialization can be achieved. One of the largest barriers to overcome is to achieve a stable PEC reaction in either strongly basic or acidic electrolytes without degradation of the semiconductor photoelectrodes. In this work, we discuss fundamental aspects of protection strategies for achieving stable solid/liquid interfaces. We then analyse the charge transfer mechanism through the protection layers for both photoanodes and photocathodes. In addition, we review protection layer approaches and their stabilities for a wide variety of experimental photoelectrodes for water reduction. Finally, we discuss key aspects which should be addressed in continued work on realizing stable and practical PEC solar water splitting systems.									338	10	1	0	21	0	338			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000398145400008	28246670

Herein, we report a systematic study on anionic silver clusters, Ag-n(-) (n = 10-34), by reacting them with O-2 under multiple-collision conditions. Mass spectrometry observation presents the odd-even alternation effect on the reaction rates of these Ag-n(-) clusters. A few chosen clusters such as Ag-13(-) and Ag-17-19(-) hold up in the presence of excessive oxygen gas reactants. First-principles calculation results reveal that the chemical stability of D-4d Ag-17(-) is associated with its symmetric ellipsoidal structure and the electronic shell closure of superatomic orbitals (1S(2)vertical bar 1P(4 vertical bar)1P(2)vertical bar 1D(4)vertical bar 1D(6)parallel to 2S(0). This results in 17c-2e multicenter bonding and a large highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap, the highest electron detachment energy and incremental binding energy among all the studied Ag-n(-) clusters, as well as the smallest O-2-binding energy and least charge transfer from Ag to O-2. We fully demonstrate the superatomic signature of these silver clusters and emphasize the unique Ag-17(-) with both geometric and electronic shell closure, shedding light on the 18e stability for the coinage of metal clusters. The superatomic charac teristics are also disclosed for Ag-16(-), Ag-18(-), and Ag-3(2)- clusters.									4	0	0	0	0	0	3				2096-5745		WOS:000794252300010

However, the doping position and concentration of hetero atom remains ill-defined although enhanced photocatalytic activity of modified g-CN photocatalysts has been reported. Herein, a facile two step procedure to synthesize heptazine polymer with defined O-atom position in polymer structure is presented. Cyameluric acid, a member of cyamelurine family upon polycondensation under inert atmosphere ensures the insertion of O-atom at bridge position between heptazine units in growing polymer. The developed polymer OLHP (oxygen linked heptazine polymer) attains high hydrogen production efficiency likely due to high O-content and efficient charge separation evident from PL spectra compared to g-CN. This heptazine based precursor design also eliminates the possibility of presence of triazine based moiety defects in g-C3N4 polymers.									34	1	0	0	2	0	34			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600032

The results show that the calcination temperature has a significant influence on the electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This is attributed to the influence of the calcination temperature on the surface microstructure including the crystallinity and the preferred orientation of IrO2 crystallites of the IrO2-Ta2O5 binary oxide formed. The surface morphology of the anodes was revealed as mud- cracks surrounded by flat areas containing several scattered IrO2 nanocrystallites. The size of these nanocrystallites, which in turn contribute to the electrochemical active surface area, is dependent on calcination temperature. The (101)- surfaces of the IrO2 were found to have higher catalytic activity than (110) IrO2 with respect to the OER. The (101) IrO2 planes were dominating at low or moderate calcination temperatures, whereas the (110) IrO2 orientation was preferred at the highest calcination temperature. Accelerated lifetime tests of the investigated samples indicate that the (101) IrO2 is more stable (110) IrO2 during electrolysis. A moderate temperature is suggested as the best calcination temperature for this type of anode regarding the electrochemical active surface area, electrocatalytic activity and stability for OER in acidic aqueous electrolytes at operating conditions.

However, there have been few applications of this technique to the synthesis of electrochemical catalysts for energy conversion. Herein, we report the detailed effects of femtosecond laser ablation in water on the structure and activity of a catalyst intended to promote the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in association with water oxidation. The femtosecond laser ablation of submicron-sized Co-CoO particles induced a drastic size reduction (from approximately 500 to 5nm) to give highly dispersed CoO nanoparticles. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) data demonstrated that these particles also contained Co3O4 and CoO(OH) but not metallic Co. These 5nm-CoO nanoparticles showed higher mass-based-activity and lower over-potential values than those of submicron-sized Co-CoO during the OER in a nearly neutral solution. XANES data suggest that Co containing Co2O3 and Co(OH)(2) formed during the OER functioned as the actual OER catalyst.									13	2	0	0	0	0	14			2365-6549			WOS:000431625900058

In addition, commercial units cannot be directly integrated with intermittent renewable energy sources due to rapid start up and shut down conditions which rapidly deteriorates the anode and cathode materials. Here, a very simple electrochemical conditioning approach followed by galvanic replacement with gold nanoparticles at a level of 0.5 at.% is demonstrated to transform stainless steel (AISI 316) into an electrocatalyst that facilitates overall water splitting while showing excellent tolerance to reverse polarity conditions. The electrocatalyst is not only very active for the OER with a low Tafel slope value of 29 mV dec(-1), but also shows excellent performance for the HER where high current densities of 100 mA cm(-2) can be achieved. In a two-cell configuration, current densities greater than 150mA cm(-2) can be achieved for overall water splitting in 6 M NaOH at a cell voltage of only 2 V indicating potential commercial applicability. Additionally, the electrodes demonstrate high tolerance to reversing the polarity of the cell over prolonged periods of up to 216 h where equal performance is maintained. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

MoS2 is potulated as a promising candidate for HER in acidic solution, however, showing poor activity in alkaline media. Herein, to widen its application in various media, we first report the synthesis of NiMoS3 nanorods using a hydrothermal method that starts from NiMoO4 nanorods. The incorporation of Ni atoms in Mo-S could arouse the synergism of ternary Ni-Mo-S and create abundant defect sites, thus substantially improving the inherent catalytic activity and catalytic sites. More importantly, Ni endows Mo-S with excellent catalytic activity in alkaline solution. As a result, NiMoS3 exhibits large cathodic current, low overpotetnial, and stable durability for HER in H2SO4 and especially in KOH. The overpotetnial at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is as low as 126 mV in KOH, making it a promising candidate for HER electrocatalyst.									39	1	0	0	0	0	39			2168-0485			WOS:000412382700058

At n = 390 mV, turnover frequencies of 38.8 +/- 1.9 and 52.1 +/- 2.0 mol H-2 (mol Co)(-1) h(-1) were achieved with high stability (Faradaic efficiency >95% for at least 72 h) and turnover numbers of approximately 2600 and 3400 in neutral and basic electrolyte solution, respectively. The rate of HER per geometric area is further enhanced by employing a CoS microtube array (microCoS), which is prepared by sulphurisation of a cobalt hydroxide carbonate nanorod array template using CBD. MicroCoS shows excellent HER activity when it is coupled with a cadmium sulphide sensitised zinc oxide photoanode in the presence of sodium sulphide and a nanostructured hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) photoanode from photoelectrochemical water splitting in basic electrolyte solution.									54	1	0	0	4	0	54			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000344376400045

Despite the similar micro-morphologies of the samples, the nonlinear electrical characteristics were enhanced in the Ni3+-doped samples but deteriorated in their Ni2+-doped counterparts. With Ni content increasing, the breakdown field and nonlinear coefficient of Ni3+-doped samples enhanced from 0.54 to 6.14 kV cm(-1) and 2.68 to 4.92 respectively while dropped from 0.98 to 0.21 kV cm(-1) and 3.48 to 1.03 for Ni2+-doped samples. Impedance spectroscopy analysis revealed significant discrepancies in terms of grain boundaries between the two series of samples, which resulted in their different dielectric properties. The oxygen loss owing to the in situ formation of NiTiO3 was considered to be the crucial factor impeding grain boundary insulation, which was key to the potential barrier formation. In contrast with that of the Ni2+-doped samples, the oxygen loss of the Ni3+-doped samples was compensated by the reduction of Ni3+ to Ni2+. This helped maintain a high potential barrier height and resulted in different nonlinear characteristics of the two series.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000533512000142

In the microwave radiation method, tetrabutylphosphonium tetrachlorocobaltate(II) ([P-4,P-4,P-4,P-4](2)[CoCl4]) with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was utilized to obtain the Co2P/CNTs-1 via one step phosphidation within 6 min. These as-prepared materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrocatalytic performance of microwave-prepared Co2P/CNTs-1 toward hydrogen evaluation reaction was investigated in acidic solution, which shows a good catalytic activity with onset overpotential of 80 mV, Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1), current densities of 10 and 20 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 135 and 170 mV, respectively. This microwave-assisted strategy for synthesis of Co2P provides a remarkable advantage of preparation process in a quite short time, which also is a simple operation and energy efficient method.

Despite everincreasing research progress at low current densities (<100 mA cm-2) in laboratory, the water electrolysis still faces several challenges under industrially-relevant current densities (>= 200 mA cm-2), such as corrosion, catalyst activity and stability issues. Thus, pursuing and designing cost-effective electrocatalysts with superior activity and stability under large current density is crucial for large-scale water splitting. This review first summarizes the fundamentals of water electrolysis both in alkaline freshwater and seawater and approaches for evaluating catalytic activity. Then, it concentrates on the innovative strategies for rational design of non-noble electrocatalysts toward alkaline water splitting and direct seawater splitting. Finally, the challenges and opportunities are highlighted for the development of catalysts toward large-current-density alkaline freshwater/ seawater electrolysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2542-5293			WOS:000813346600002

This formalism relies on the introduction of interaction coefficients to account for deviations from Henry's Law. With the evolution of thermodynamic modeling and of the CALPHAD method, the fact that thermodynamic descriptions using these parameters were derived to be used at relatively dilute solution has been sometimes overlooked and the formalism has been criticized for deviating from reality in non-dilute solutions. In this work, it is shown that the interaction parameters used in this formalism correlate with properties of the solutes and of the solvent. The work focuses on the interactions in systems Fe-M-O, where M is a deoxidant. Correlations between interaction coefficients and heats of formation of the corresponding oxides and with the atomic number of the deoxidants are demonstrated. This not only helps supporting the physicochemical soundness of the formalism but also provides a way of checking the consistency of data presented in this formalism.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1450-5339			WOS:000372771500006

MethodsThe hot-filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) system was chosen for the preparation of Boron doped diamond (BDD) film on the Ti substrate, with the H_2, CH_4 and (CH_3O)_3B mixture as the reaction gas. SEM, EDX, Raman spectra, XRD and electrochemical workstation were used for the morphology and electrochemical detection of BDD film in different growth stage. ResultsThe BDD film displayed uniform (111) crystal face, and obvious characteristic peaks of diamond atom and boron atom were found through Raman spectra. The background currents were low and the potential window was wider (3.5 V). The COD degradation of phenol wastewater was remarkable. ConclusionThe adsorption of organic pollutants was positively correlated with the roughness of the electrode surface. The laboratory prepared BDD/Ti electrode had smaller surface roughness, which was not favorable for the occurrence of hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution, and could reduce the direct electrochemical oxidation, resulting in a wider potential window.			目的:研究硼掺杂对改善金刚石膜的电阻率的影响,制备掺硼金刚石膜。方法采用热丝化学气相沉积系统,以CH_4,H_2,(CH_3O)_3B混合气体为反应气,在钛片衬底上沉积制备掺硼金刚石膜电极。对不同生长阶段沉积出的电极进行扫描电镜、EDX光电子能谱、激光Raman光谱、X射线衍射、电化学性能表征及废水降解应用研究。结果制备出的掺硼金刚石膜呈现出均匀的(111)晶面,Raman光谱图中金刚石特征峰与硼原子特征峰峰型显著,具有较低的背景电流和更宽的电位窗口(3.5 V),对苯酚废水COD降解效果显著。结论有机污染物的吸附量与电极表面的粗糙度正相关,实验室制备的BDD/Ti电极表面粗糙度小,不利于析氢和析氧等副反应的发生,能降低直接电化学氧化作用,从而得到更宽的电势窗口。						1	2	0	0	0	0	2			1001-3660			CSCD:5426590

The reaction mechanism of the oxygen evolution driven by this catalyst was investigated by means of density functional calculations. The results showed that one chloride ligand of 1(Cl) has to exchange with a water molecule to generate 1, [Cl-Fe-III(dpa)-OH2](2+), as the starting species of the catalytic cycle. The initial one-electron oxidation of 1 is coupled with the release of two protons, generating [Cl-Fe-IV(dpa)=O](+) (2). Another one-electron transfer from 2 leads to the formation of an Fe-V=O complex [Cl-Fe-V(dpa)=O](2+) (3), which triggers the critical O-O bond formation. The electronic structure of 3 was found to be very similar to that of the high-valent heme-iron center of P450 enzymes, termed Compound I, in which a pi-cation radical ligand is believed to support a formal iron(IV)-oxo core. More importantly, 3 and Compound I share the same tendency toward electrophilic reactions. Two competing pathways were suggested for the O-O bond formation based on the present calculations. One is the nitrate nucleophilic attack on the iron(V)-oxo moiety with a total barrier of 12.3 kcal mol(-1). In this case, nitrate functions as a co-catalyst for the dioxygen formation. The other is the water nucleophilic attack on iron(V)-oxo with a greater barrier of 16.5 kcal mol(-1). In addition, ligand degradation via methyl hydrogen abstraction was found to have a barrier similar to that of the O-O bond formation, while the aromatic carbon hydroxylation has a higher barrier.									22	2	0	0	0	0	22			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000430437400043	29600856

Ethylene glycol (EG) has been found to be a refractory compound. Different heterogeneous catalysts in slurry conditions using a high-pressure batch reactor at 160-220 degreesC and 15-25 bar of oxygen partial pressure were studied for enhancing WO efficiency. The activity of commercial catalysts (Pt/Al2O3, CuO-ZnO/Al2O3, CuO-MnOx/Al2O3, Fe2O3-MnOx and CuO-MnOx) was compared with the one related to various catalysts prepared in our laboratory (Ag-Ce-O, Mn-Ce-O and Ce-O). The Mn-Ce-O catalyst showed very high activity in terms of total oxidation of EG as well as total organic carbon reductions (up to 99.3%). Formic acid was identified as the only intermediate compound and the pH evolution was related with its formation/oxidation. Kinetic studies revealed activation energies of 31.8 and 45.0kJ/mol concerning the two step mechanism of EG degradation by means of Mn-Ce-O. The catalyst stability was observed in terms of metal leaching and carbon adsorption, and its texture and morphology were analyzed by SEM, TEM, EDXS and SAED, Whiskers of MnOOH and/or beta-MnO2 were detected.

The effects of PEG addition on the co-deposition of Zr and V oxides and their polarization behavior, and on the microstructure of the deposits, were investigated. Although the Zr content in the deposits obtained from the Zn-Zr solution in the absence of PEG was approximately zero, it increased significantly at a current density of above 1000 A.m(-2) following the addition of PEG. In the Zn-V solution, the V content in the deposits obtained from 100 to 2000 A.m(-2) was higher with PEG than without it. In the presence of PEG, the cathode potential polarized, the rate of hydrogen evolution increased, and the hydrolysis reaction of Zr4+ and VO2+ ions proceeded smoothly, resulting in an increase in the Zr and V content in the deposits. Additionally, the crystal platelets of Zn in the Zn-Zr and the Zn-Voxide films became fine, and the surface coverage of the spongiform Zr and film-like Voxides increased. Furthermore, the corrosion current densities of the Zn-Zr and Zn-Voxide films obtained from the solution with PEG were lower than those from the solution without it. The reduction rate of dissolved oxygen decreased in the films in the presence of PEG, thereby leading to a decrease in the corrosion current density.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1345-9678	1347-5320		WOS:000582700300020

The microstructure and morphology of the anode were examined by SEM, EMPA and XRD, and its catalytic selectivity was studied by potentiodynamic polarization and cyclic voltammetry. The result shows that the anode coating has a compact texture, whose oxide distributes uniformly with a complete coverage of the Ti matrix. Electrochemical performance test shows that the anode has high oxygen evolution potential and good catalysis for the oxidative degradation of phenol. In the simulative test of phenol degradation, the removal rates of phenol and COD (chemical oxygen demand) reach 100% and 97.7%, respectively. Therefore, the Ti/Sn-Sb anode doped with Ce possesses high ability of removing the phenol in waste water.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1002-185X			WOS:000291966000033

Herein, a simple one-step thermal polymerization technique was developed to modulate electronic structures of g-C(3)N(4)by compositing with waste coffee grounds. The formed sandwich-like carbocatalysts (coffee grounds-derived graphitic carbon nitride, Cs/C3N4) exhibited an excellent performance on PDS activation toward bisphenol A oxidation via a nonradical pathway. The abundant unpaired electrons around the dangling bonds on the Cs/g-C(3)N(4)surface, which were formed by the mutual substitution of N and C atoms between Cs and g-C(3)N(4)during the annealing process, could be deprived by PDS, forming the reactive electron-deficient carbocatalysts ([Cs/g-C3N4]*) along with a spot of singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) generation to oxidize the organic pollutants. The graphitic N and structural defects might serve as the active sites to offer the unpaired electrons. Compared to singlet oxygen, [Cs/g-C3N4]* revealed a higher mineralization efficiency to reduce the residual ecotoxicity, exhibiting a certain potential in practical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000770898200004

The phase transformation and microstructure evolution during the reaction at 1600-1800 degrees C were thoroughly investigated. The results indicated that the high N-2 pressure was essential for the effective nitridation. The in situ generated AlN-AlON refractories had a homogeneous local chemical composition, and the (101) plane of AlN and the (222) lattice plane of Al5O6N were bonded at their grain boundary with no amorphous phase. The as-fabricated AlN-AlON refractories treated at 1700 degrees C by a 20 atm nitrogen pressure exhibited an optimum bending strength of 111.10 MPa, combining an apparent porosity of 20% with a low bulk density of 1.97 g/cm(3). The diffusion of the generated oxygen led to an increase in the apparent porosity and decrease in the bulk density at 1800 degrees C. Furthermore, the fabrication mechanism of AlN-AlON refractories under the nitrogen gas-pressure was discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000846837000001

Herein, we firstly synthesized NH-rich red PHI nanoparticles (RPHI NP) with tunable n -> pi* electronic transition by calcining melamine using a KCl/KSCN molten system. The small particle size (about 50 nm in diameter) promotes charge separation via shortening the electron and hole transfer distance. Moreover, the n -> pi* electronic transition can be controllably regulated by changing the KSCN dosage, which remarkably broadens the optical response range to 750 nm. Collaborative optimization of the two enables RPHI1 NP to exhibit 25 times higher photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction (HER) rate than bulk PHI under visible-light irradiation (lambda > 510 nm). This work details the simultaneous achievement of the optimization of charge separation and optical absorption of PHI via the synthesis of red PHI nanoparticles, which paves the way for developing advanced PHI materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000840710200001

In the present work, we show that our predicted two-step structural transformation and resulted structural evolution for Li2RuO3 agree well with our experiments. The anionic oxidation occurs upon delithiation, and the reduction of structural stability would initiate cation migration from Li-Ru layers to adjacent Li layers, which can in turn restabilize the delithiated structures and suppress the oxygen evolution, providing a good explanation on the observed high reversible capacity. However, the gradual migration of cations will cause a serious voltage decay of Li2RuO3 upon cycling, as well as poor cycling kinetics because of the fact that migrating cations in Li layers impede the Li diffusion. Our finding significantly broadens the current understanding on the electrochemistry of Li2RuO3 and provides important guidelines for the future design of Li-rich TM oxides as high-capacity cathode materials.									20	1	0	0	0	0	21			1932-7447			WOS:000470938400014

The classical model of three-stage Ni oxidation refers to the relationship between NiO cluster evolution and the kinetics of O-2 exposure; however, this information has a critical inherent limitation because of the pressure gap between UHV and real reaction conditions. Here, we report reversible NiO phase transitions on the Ni(111) surface at near-ambient pressure by using scanning tunneling microscopy at room temperature. The restricted kinetic growth of NiO cluster evolution expands unexpectedly to oxide multi-layer formation at 100mTorr of O-2. Furthermore, metastable NiO islands can be manipulated by varying the partial CO pressure of the gas mixture. The interplay between the CO and O-2 molecules on the Ni(111) is correlated definitely to either surface oxide formation or competitive CO adsorption on the defect-laden multi-layered NiO interface.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000431974000017

The pitting corrosion of different regions in the joint was investigated by a microcell method and the salt spray test. The pitting corrosion was mainly dependent on the nature of precipitates in each region of the joint. The heat affected zone had the worst susceptibility to pitting corrosion as a result of the presence of coarse. phase, the existence of precipitate-free zones, and the decrease in dissolved Cu in the matrix. However, the thermomechanically affected zone had a slightly improved pitting resistance because theta phase redissolved into solid solution. In the shoulder affected zone (SAZ), theta and theta phases were completely and partially redissolved, respectively, and the content of dissolved Cu in the matrix increased. As a result, the corrosion resistance significantly increased in the SAZ.									13	4	0	0	0	0	15			0010-9312	1938-159X		WOS:000383391600001

The S-H bond breaking and the Au-S bond formation are analyzed through the evolution of the density of states. The energetics confirms the complexity of the reaction emerging from the interthiol chain interaction. The formation of a self-assembled monolayer is explained through a two-step mechanism, S-H bond breaking and Au-S bond formation. The production of H-2 is found to be more favorable than the formation of Au-H species. The bonding and antibonding electronic states of the S-H bond have been identified and their evolutions during the process of bond breaking carefully analyzed. The corresponding bonding and antibonding states for the C-S bond are practically not affected during this process, indicating that the bond is preserved. The s orbital of the hydrogen atom strongly interacts with the gold surface and finally a Au-H bond is formed.									79	3	0	0	8	2	79			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000277776900034

Usually well established N2O techniques are the dissociative N2O chemisorption performed as pulse chemisorption or in frontal technique with highly diluted N2O to avoid high heat evolution and bulk oxidation. Here TPR/H-2 of the oxygen layer formed under relatively high N2O Partial pressure is compared with TPD/H-2. The dispersion of Cuo determined by TPD is very high. The calculated metallic surface copper area was very close to the total exchanged Cu in the sample, which confirms that copper atoms are well dispersed on ZSM-5 sample. These measurements are supported by XPS data, suggesting also a high dispersion of copper ions in the zeolite. The surface metallic copper determined by H-2 TPD technique showed that this method avoids sintering, compared to the N2O method, where sintering occurred due to heat evolution during the N2O reaction, causing migration and agglomeration of copper externally the surface of the zeolite.

J	Pang Xuexia; Deng Zechao; Jia Pengying; Liang Weihua								Influence of Ionization Degrees on Conversion of CO and CO2 in Atmospheric Plasma near the Ground								PLASMA SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				16	8			782	788		10.1088/1009-0630/16/8/09				AUG 2014	2014	A zero-dimensional model is used to study the processes of physical and chemical reactions in atmospheric plasma with different ionization degrees near the ground (0 km). The temporal evolutions of CO, CO2 and other main reactants (namely OH and O-2), which affect the conversion of CO and CO2, are obtained for afterglow plasma with different initial values. The results show that the consumption rate of CO is largest when the initial electron number density eta(e0) = 10(12) cm(-3), i.e. the ionization degree is 0.000004%. The number density of CO2 is relatively small when eta(e0) =10(16) cm(-3), i.e. the ionization degree is 0.04%, whereas they are very close under the condition of other ionization degrees. Considering the total number densities of CO and CO2 and the consumption rate of CO comprehensively, the best condition is eta(e0) = 10(13) cm(-3), i.e. the ionization degree is 0.00004% for reducing the densities of CO and CO2 in the atmospheric plasma. The temporal evolutions of N+, Ar+, CO+ and CO2+ are also shown, and the influences on the temporal evolutions of CO and CO2 are analyzed with increasing ionization degree.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1009-0630	2058-6272		WOS:000342388800009

However, their phase instability in reducing conditions remains an issue for anode application. The role of Mn substitution into B-site of La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-delta (LSF) perovskite oxide was investigated. New insights on the structural evolution of La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Mn0.2O3-delta (LSFMn) upon high temperature reduction were revealed. In oxidizing atmosphere, Mn substitution reduces the oxygen vacancy concentration while, switching to reducing conditions, it drives the transition from rhombohedral perovskite to single Ruddlesden-Popper phase, affecting the Fe-0 exsolution. Redox-cycles of LSFMn were investigated and the properties of re-oxidized compounds were highlighted. The effect of Mn substitution on perovskite conductivity was also evaluated both in oxidizing and reducing conditions.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0955-2219	1873-619X		WOS:000541149500031

NiP2/ZnP4/NF is demonstrated to be a better bifunctional catalyst. Furthermore, the effects of calcination temperature on the catalytic performance of Ni2P/ZnP4/NF are studied, they are synthesized at different temperatures (250 degrees C, 300 degrees C, 350 degrees C) (denoted as Ni2P/ZnP4/NF-250, Ni2P/ZnP4/NF-300, Ni2P/ZnP4/NF-350). The results indicate Ni2P/ZnP4/NF-300 has better catalytic performance, and can be used as bifunctional catalyst for both HER and UOR in alkaline electrolyte. Then, a two-electrode electrolyzer Ni2P/ZnP4/NF-300 parallel to Ni2P/ZnP4/NF-300 is constructed. It only needs 1.69 V at 50 mA cm(-2) with long-term stability. Thus, Ni2P/ZnP4/NF-300 is not only promising for hydrogen production, but also has great significance for urea-water treatment. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report the use of hydrogenated MoO3 (HMO) with a unique quasi-metallic property as an excellent cocatalyst for the ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst. The HMO-ZnIn2S4 composite with an optimized ratio realizes a H-2 production rate of 1564 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under visible light (lambda >= 420 nm) excitation. It not only significantly surpasses the performance of pristine ZnIn2S4 (327 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)), but also outperforms the 1 wt % Pt-decorated ZnIn2S4 (1308 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)). The reasons for this improvement, as disclosed by photoelectrochemical characterization, ultrafast laser spectroscopy, and density functional calculation, is that the efficient charge transfer from ZnIn2S4 to HMO facilitates electron-hole separation after photoexcitaiton, and HMO substantially lowers the overpotential of the H-2 evolution reaction. This work thus demonstrates the potential of quasi-metallic hydrogenated metal oxide as an alternative to noble metal cocatalyst for photocatalytic application.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000664312500021

In this study, MoC@NC is synthesized via a one-step carbonization procedure under Ar atmosphere. Thereinto, PMo12@ZIF-8/ZnO was prepared by the mechanical grinding of zinc oxide, 2-methyl imidazole and phosphomolybdic acid hydrate and used as a precursor. The characterization results show that MoC@NC is an N-doped hierarchical porous graphite carbon-coated MoC nanoparticle. Significantly, the formation of hierarchical pores is mainly attributed to the evaporation of zinc ions at high temperatures. The catalyst exhibits outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) property with low overpotentials (132 and 122 mV) and small Tafel slopes (75 and 80 mV dec(-1)) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH solutions at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, MoC@NC demonstrated favorable stability for 24 h under operating conditions. Herein, the excellent catalytic effect can be ascribed to the multistage pore structure and the N-doped graphite carbon layer. Simultaneously, this is a simple way to synthesize highly efficient MoC electrocatalysts in large quantities.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000649420300001

Although there is existing work that illustrates their effect on PEC processes, clarifying the influence of surface and bulk oxygen vacancies, respectively, on the PEC performance is challenging. Herein, we present the fabrication of WO3 photoanodes with tunable bulk and surface oxygen vacancy with a novel two-step flame heating approach that is proving to be a powerful platform for this purpose. We found that both the conductivity and trapping state density of the WO3 photoanode increase with bulk oxygen vacancy density, leading to a volcano-like relationship between the kinetics of charge separation/transport and bulk oxygen vacancy density. Moreover, both the interfacial charge transfer rate constant and the charge recombination rate constant on the surface of the WO3 photoanode increase with surface oxygen vacancy density, which also leads to a volcano-like relationship between the charge injection efficiency and surface oxygen vacancy density. By tuning the surface and bulk oxygen vacancy density simultaneously, the PEC performance of the WO3 photoanode was increased by ca. 10 times, which illustrates the strength of delicate oxygen vacancy engineering in optimizing PEC devices.									35	3	0	0	0	0	35			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000581738300075

Herein, the real intrinsic activity of layered Mn oxide toward OER in Fe/Ni-free KOH is studied for the first time. At pH approximate to 14, the onset of OER for layered Mn oxide in the presence of Fe/Ni-free KOH happens at 1.72 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). In the presence of Fe ions, a 190 mV decrease in the overpotential of OER was recorded for layered Mn oxide as well as a significant decrease (from 172.8 to 49 mV/decade) in the Tafel slope. Furthermore, we find that both Ni and Fe ions increase OER remarkably in the presence of layered Mn oxide, but that pure layered Mn oxide is not an efficient catalyst for OER without Ni and Fe under alkaline conditions. Thus, pure layered Mn oxide and electrolytes are critical factors in finding the real intrinsic activity of layered Mn oxide for OER. Our results call into question the high efficiency of layered Mn oxides toward OER under alkaline conditions and also elucidate the significant role of Ni and Fe impurities in the electrolyte in the presence of layered Mn oxide toward OER under alkaline conditions. Overall, a computational model supports the conclusions from the experimental structural and electrochemical characterizations. In particular, substitutional doping with Fe decreases the thermodynamic OER overpotential up to 310 mV. Besides, the thermodynamic OER onset potential calculated for the Fe-free structures is higher than 1.7 V (vs RHE) and, thus, not in the stability range of Mn oxides.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000768216300001	35029976

Further to the presence of units of TiO2, the films contained fluorine, carbon, nitrogen, and probably hydrogen species derived from the electrolyte. The compositions of the films appeared to be relatively independent of the water content of the electrolyte. Following a small increase in efficiency of film growth for additions between 0 and 1 vol % water, the efficiency decreased from about 25 to about 10% between water contents of 1 and 25 vol %, respectively, possibly due to a combination of loss of titanium species to the electrolyte and evolution of oxygen. The densities of the nanotube layers were estimated to be in the range of 1.25-1.75 g cm(-3), with an average value of 1.47 g cm(-3). (C) 2009 The Electrochemical Society.

Initially, both water and oxygen are oxidants, generating H-2, releasing low concentrations of Fe, Al, Ni and Mn. All added oxygen is consumed during this period. No Cr release is observed during these initial stages, attributed to Mn incorporation in the oxide. Rapid reappearance of oxygen in the water is attributed to thickening of the surface oxide.

Herein, self-supported NiCo2S4/FeOOH nanowire arrays with rich heterointerfaces being embedded in were constructed via a two-step route, namely, hydrothermal synthesis of hydroxide precursors and then selective sulfur anion exchange, which was purposely realized by utilizing the different solubility product constants (K-sp) of Ni(II), Co(II), and Fe(III)-hydroxides and controlling the sulfidation conditions. The as-synthesized NiCo2S4/FeOOH nanowire arrays as a pre-catalyst present a large length-diameter ratio and porous feature, which is beneficial to expose high density of active sites and accelerate the mass transport. In addition, the synergy arising from interfacial electron redistribution and multiple active sites substantially helps optimize the surface binding energy of the different intermediates as demonstrated by our experimental investigations and theoretical calculations, thus enabling the remarkable overall activity for OER with an ultra-low overpotential of similar to 200 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This interface engineering strategy can be expanded to advance other interfacial structures, which is believed to afford inspiration in the field of interface engineering for high-performance catalysts.									67	2	0	0	3	0	68			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000595298400002

For a large-scale CLC system in fixed bed reactors, the effective utilization of oxygen carrier (OC) pellets or sticks is crucial with respect to overall system performance due to the relatively large particle sizes. In the present work, we compared the reactivity and effective utilization of four typical OCs (i.e., CuO/SiO2, Fe2O3/Al2O3, Mn3O4/ZrO2 and NiO/ZrO2) for chemical looping combustion of methane in a large laboratory fixed bed reactor. The effect of particle size on the reactivity of OCs was also investigated. The OC sticks were prepared by an extrusion method. By scraping the sticks layer by layer, the evolution of OC component and structure after reaction from surface to bulk was investigated. The result showed that OC sticks with 2 mm diameter and 4 mm length is suitable for CLC in this large laboratory unit. It is found that the CuO/SiO2 OC exhibit high reactivity, redox performance and strong resistance to carbon deposition formation. The existence of Cu2O in the deep layers of the reduced CuO/SiO2 sticks suggests that the CuO even in the bulk of sticks can react with methane. The effective utilization of the CuO/SiO2 OC is 77.56%. NiO/ZrO2 OC also shows high reactivity and redox performance for CLC with methane, and its effective utilization is as high as 86.96%. However, the presence of metallic Ni during the reaction will catalyze the methane cracking into carbon deposition and H-2. Fe2O3/Al2O3 and Mn3O4/ZrO2 OCs represent relatively low reactivity for methane oxidation. The obtained effective utilizations for the Fe2O3/Al2O3 and Mn3O4/ZrO2 sticks are only 36.82% and 38.86%, respectively, indicating that these two OCs with large particle size cannot react with methane completely. It is also noted that the Mn3O4/ZrO2 OC sticks possess strong resistance to carbon deposition formation, while the Fe2O3/Al2O3 OC sticks are faced with serious carbon deposition problem. For all the OC sticks, since methane can easily diffuse into the bulk layer, the reaction of methane with OC sticks is mainly controlled by the migration rate and activity of lattice oxygen in OCs.

Recently, the repertoire of HHDH has been expanded, providing access to some novel HHDH subclasses exhibiting a broader epoxide substrate scope. In this work, we develop a computational approach based on the application of linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques to long time-scale Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to study the HHDH conformational landscapes. We couple the analysis of the conformational landscapes to CAVER calculations to assess their impact on the active site tunnels and potential ability towards bulky epoxide ring opening reaction. Our study indicates that the analyzed HHDHs subclasses share a common breathing motion of the halide binding pocket, but present large deviations in the loops adjacent to the active site pocket and N-terminal regions. Such conformational differences affect the available tunnels for epoxide binding to the active site. The superior activity of the HHDH G subclass towards bulkier substrates is explained by the additional structural elements delimiting the active site region, its rich conformational heterogeneity, and the substantially wider and frequently observed active site tunnels. This study therefore provides key information for HHDH promiscuity and engineering.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5				2073-4344		WOS:000601851400001

The expensive and benign carrageenan served as the source of carbon, oxygen, and sulfur, whereas urea served as the nitrogen source. The material was prepared via direct mixing of precursors and freeze-drying followed by carbonization under nitrogen at 900 degrees C. Co@NOSC catalysts comprising a Co inner core and outer electron-rich heteroatom-doped carbon shell were thoroughly characterized using various techniques, namely, TEM, HRTEM, STEM elemental mapping, XPS, BET, and ICP-MS. The utility of the Co@NOSC catalyst was explored for base-free selective oxidative esterification of alcohols to the corresponding esters under mild reaction conditions; excellent conversions (up to 97%) and selectivities (up to 99%) were discerned. Furthermore, the substrate scope was explored for the cross-esterification of benzyl alcohol with long-chain alcohols (up to 98%) and lactonization of diols (up to 68%). The heterogeneous nature and stability of the catalyst facilitated by its ease of separation for long-term performance and recycling studies showed that the catalyst was robust and remained active even after six recycling experiments. EPR measurements were performed to deduce the reaction mechanism in the presence of POBN (alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone) as a spin-trapping agent, which confirmed the formation of (CH2OH)-C-center dot radicals and H-center dot radicals, wherein the solvent plays an active role in a nonconventional manner. A plausible mechanism was proposed for the oxidative esterification of alcohols on the basis of EPR findings. The presence of a cobalt core along with cobalt oxide and the electron-rich N-, O-, and S-doped carbon shell displayed synergistic effects to afford good to excellent yields of products.									37	1	0	0	0	0	38			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000441581600014

Electrochemical measurements and metallurgical characterization have been made to clarify and quantify the physical properties of Al7Cu2Fe particles in AA7075-T651. Prior studies regarding either the stereology or electrochemical properties of Al7Cu2Fe are scarce. Quantitative microscopy revealed a significant population of Al7Cu2Fe in the alloy; comprising up to 65% of the constituent particle population and typically at a size of 1.7 +/- 1.0 mu m. It was determined that Al7Cu2Fe may serve as a local cathode in the evolution of localized corrosion of AA7075-T651 and is capable of sustaining oxygen reduction reactions at rates of several hundreds of mu A/cm(2) over a range of potentials typical of the open circuit potential (OCP) of AA7075-T651 in NaCl solution of various concentrations and pH. The presence of Al7Cu2Fe leads to the development of pitting at the particle-matrix interface. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

ZnO layers were deposited on the silicon single crystals and GaN epitaxial layers at low temperature by atomic layer deposition. Deposition temperature varied between 100 and 300 degrees C. A random spectra analysis was performed to determine layer thickness and composition. In turn, analysis of the aligned spectra allows us to study evolution of ingrown defects. The Rutherford backscattering study supports the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, performed separately, that the ZnO-ALD layers deposited at low temperature contain a higher oxygen content. Composition measurements, performed as a function of growth temperature, show that oxygen content decreases with the increasing temperature of the atomic layer deposition growth process.					9th International Conference on Ion Implantation and Other Application of Ions and Electrons (ION)9th International Conference on Ion Implantation and Other Application of Ions and Electrons (ION)	JUN 25-28, 2012JUN 25-28, 2012	Maria Curie Sklodowska Univ; Lublin Univ Technol; Wroclaw Univ Technol; Polish Phys Soc; Polish Minist Sci & Higher EducMaria Curie Sklodowska Univ; Lublin Univ Technol; Wroclaw Univ Technol; Polish Phys Soc; Polish Minist Sci & Higher Educ	Kazimierz Dolny, POLANDKazimierz Dolny, POLAND	3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0587-4246	1898-794X		WOS:000319856400030

Herein we report the synthesis of Ru nanoparticles supported on nanodiamond by a one-step approach through the reduction of RuCl3 using AB as reducing agent. The nanocomposites surfaces with large quantity of oxygen containing functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxylic groups resulted in a homogeneous suspension in aqueous phase. The catalytic activity of Ru/nanodiamond was studied for hydrogen generation from AB hydrolysis at 25 degrees C. Results indicated that nanodiamond supported Ru nanoparticles with a mean particle size of 3.7 nm exhibited high catalytic activity for AB hydrolysis, with a turnover frequency number of 229 mol H-2 center dot(mol Ru center dot min)(-1). The high catalytic activity of Ru/nanodiamond demonstrates that nano diamond is a good media for nanoparticles immobilization. Copyright (c) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

J	Hamdi, Adel								A non-iterative method for identifying multiple unknown time-dependent sources compactly supported occurring in a 2D parabolic equation								INVERSE PROBLEMS IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING				26	5			744	772		10.1080/17415977.2017.1347648				2018	2018	We address the non-linear inverse source problem of identifying multiple unknown time-dependent sources spatially supported in some subdomains of a two-dimensional bounded domain subject to an evolution advection-dispersion-reaction equation. Provided to be available within the monitored domain interfaces for recording the state and its flux crossing each suspected zone where a source could occur, we establish an identifiability theorem that yields uniqueness of the unknown elements defining all occurring sources. We develop a non-iterative detection-identification method that goes throughout the monitored domain to detect in each suspected zone whether there exists or not an occurring source. Once a source is detected, the developed method determines lower and upper bounds of the total amount discharged by the occurring source and localizes the geometric centre of its unknown spatial support. Then, given two desired reference geometries for example, squares/discs centred at the already localized geometric centre, the method determines the biggest domain defined by a first reference geometry included in the sought source spatial support as well as the smallest domain defined by a second reference geometry containing this unknown support. In addition, the developed method gives an approximation of the surface area of this latest and identifies its time-dependent intensity function. Some numerical experiments on a variant of the surface water Biological Oxygen Demand pollution model are presented.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1741-5977	1741-5985		WOS:000427557000008

Electrochemical characterizations, as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were utilized to assess degree of components degradation. Catalyst AST results revealed that Pt nanoparticles dispersed within the micro- and meso-pores and not in contact with ionomer are the main contributor to the 50% electrochemical surface area (ECSA) loss observed after 30k cycles resulting in significant polarization loss, which is much more notable in the case of sub-stoichiometric operating condition. Support AST results for HSA carbon showed severe ionomer degradation and 55% ECSA loss within the first 100 cycles, while cell with durable support exhibited negligible polarization and ECSA decay during the first 2500 cycles attributed to higher ionomer coverage, preservation of proton pathways preventing Pt from detachment.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000711979600003

We have, for the first time, developed a descriptor and design principle to accurately predict the HER electrocatalytic activities of heteroatom-doped g-C3N4. The new descriptor includes the dopant and its bonding environmental information, which provides a detailed guide to the rational design and screening of high-performance catalysts. A "volcano" relationship between the descriptor and the electrocatalytic activity was established, from which the most active dopant elements and related structures were identified. It was shown that doping near the edge of g-C3N4 could be a promising strategy in developing highly active metal-free g-C3N4-based catalysts. We also reveal the intrinsic origin of the catalytic activity of the doped g-C3N4 for different activity sites. Our work provides a basic design principle of heteroatom-doped g-C3N4 as an efficient HER catalyst and a fundamental understanding of the HER mechanism.									30	0	0	0	3	0	30			2296-8016			WOS:000459064900001

We report that the addition of 1% Pd in the surface in the form of a Pd/Au(111) single-atom alloy dramatically alters the desorption temperature of molecular oxygen after oxidation by ozone. We use temperature programmed desorption to study the desorption kinetics and scanning tunneling microscopy to compare the structure of the oxides produced on Au(111) with and without 1% Pd. Aided by density functional theory we hypothesize that the lower temperature evolution of O-2 occurs not because Pd atoms lower the O-2 desorption barrier, rather than the 10% Pd disrupts the formation of the more stable 2D ordered oxide formed on Au(11). This effect is particularly pronounced when the single-atom alloy surface is treated with ozone at lower temperatures.									17	0	0	0	3	0	17			0039-6028	1879-2758		WOS:000447478700040

The development and evaluation of effective catalysts are here imperative; however, due to the inclusion of elements with different redox properties and reactivity, these materials undergo dynamical changes and phase transformations during the reaction conditions. NiMoO4 is currently investigated among other metal oxides as a promising noble metal free catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. Here we show that at applied bias, NiMoO4 center dot H2O transforms into gamma-NiOOH. Time resolved operando Raman spectroscopy is utilized to follow the potential dependent phase transformation and is collaborated with elemental analysis of the electrolyte, confirming that molybdenum leaches out from the as-synthesized NiMoO4 center dot H2O. Molybdenum leaching increases the surface coverage of exposed nickel sites, and this in combination with the formation of gamma-NiOOH enlarges the amount of active sites of the catalyst, leading to high current densities. Additionally, we discovered different NiMoO4 nanostructures, nanoflowers, and nanorods, for which the relative ratio can be influenced by the heating ramp during the synthesis. With selective molybdenum etching we were able to assign the varying X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern as well as Raman vibrations unambiguously to the two nanostructures, which were revealed to exhibit different stabilities in alkaline media by time-resolved in situ and operando Raman spectroscopy. We advocate that a similar approach can beneficially be applied to many other catalysts, unveiling their structural integrity, characterize the dynamic surface reformulation, and resolve any ambiguities in interpretations of the active catalyst phase.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000693105500084	34383485

However, too many semiconductors show poor stability, due to photodegradation phenomena in aqueous solutions, thus loosing efficiency under operative conditions. Aim of this paper is to introduce a simple and fast method for screening different semiconductor materials and identify their efficiency in H-2(or O-2) production with respect to photocorrosion. This method could be used with any finely dispersed semiconductor (powder) for a fast, preliminary evaluation of the material's behaviour without interferences from the supporting material (i. e. FTO) or any binder. The method is based on the combination of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) in the tip generation/substrate collection (TG/SC) mode and of cavity microelectrodes as SECM tips. Here, we show results obtained on three powder materials, namely core-shell CuI/CuO, CuI and TiO2.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000544213900011

In this composite cathode, both LSF and LSCF layers are uniformly distributed on Yttria-stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) scaffold by optimizing the infiltrating solution components. LSF serves as a protective layer between LSCF and YSZ. The introduction of the LSCF exterior layer has greatly improved cell performance compared with the cell with sole LSF cathode. At 600 degrees C, the maximum power density of the cell with LSCF/LSF/YSZ composite cathode reaches up to 0.559 W cm(-2). The evolution of the cathode polarization resistance verifies that the ORR activity has been greatly enhanced. Therefore, the results indicate that the high cell performance at intermediate temperatures can be obtained by adopting the LSCF cathode into YSZ-based SOFCs using protective layer and that the infiltration method is a practical way for constructing electrode.

Laccase activity is commonly determined by monitoring spectrophotometric changes (absorbance) of the product or substrate during the enzymatic reaction. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) is a fast and versatile technique where spectral evolution profiling, i.e. assessment of the spectral changes of both substrate and products during enzymatic conversion in real time, can be used to assess enzymatic activity when combined with multivariate data analysis. We employed FTIR to monitor enzymatic oxidation of monolignols (sinapyl, coniferyl and p-coumaryl alcohol), sinapic acid, and sinapic aldehyde by four different laccases: three fungal laccases from Trametes versieolor, Trametes villosa and Ganoderma lucidum, respectively, and one bacterial laccase from Meiothermus tuber. By coupling the FTIR measurements with Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) we established a quantitative assay for assessing laccase activity. By combining PARAFAC modelling with Principal Component Analysis we show the usefulness of this technology as a multivariate tool able to compare and distinguish different laccase reaction patterns. We also demonstrate how the FTIR approach can be used to create a reference system for laccase activity comparison based on a relatively low number of measurements. Such a reference system has potential to function as a high-throughput method for comparing reaction pattern similarities and differences between laccases and hereby identify new and interesting enzyme candidates in large sampling pools.									8	0	0	0	6	0	8			0141-0229	1879-0909		WOS:000457511400007	30638509

Such an improvement is not observed by the addition of Cu(ClO4)(2) in the absence of organic ligands. The addition of [(tmpa)Cu](2+) in the reaction solution resulted in more than an 11 times higher turnover number (TON) compared with the TON obtained without [(tmpa)Cu-II](2+). In the photocatalytic oxygenation, a stoichiometric amount of H2O2 formation was observed in the absence of [(tmpa)Cu-II](2+), however, much less H2O2 formation was observed in the presence of [(tmpa)Cu-II](2+). The photocatalytic mechanism was investigated by laser flash photolysis measurements in order to detect intermediates. The reaction of O-2(center dot-) with [(tmpa)Cu-II](2+) monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy in propionitrile at 203 K suggested formation of [{(tmpa)Cu-II}(2)O-2](2+), a transformation which is crucial for the overall 4-electron reduction of molecular O-2 to water, and a key in the observed improvement in the catalytic durability of Acr(+) -Mes.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000305581500015	22692585

Oxygen vacancies (OVs) with abundant localized electrons on the surface of bismuth oxybromide-based semiconductors are demonstrated to have the ability to capture and activate N-2, providing an alternative pathway to overcome such limitations. However, bismuth oxybromide materials are susceptible to photocorrosion, and the surface OVs are easily oxidized and therefore lose their activities. For realistic photocatalytic N-2 fixation, fabricating and enhancing the stability of sustainable OVs on semiconductors is indispensable. This study shows the first synthesis of self-assembled 5 nm diameter Bi5O7Br nanotubes with strong nanotube structure, suitable absorption edge, and many exposed surface sites, which are favorable for furnishing sufficient visible light-induced OVs to realize excellent and stable photoreduction of atmospheric N-2 into NH3 in pure water. The NH3 generation rate is as high as 1.38 mmol h(-1) g(-1), accompanied by an apparent quantum efficiency over 2.3% at 420 nm. The results presented herein provide new insights into rational design and engineering for the creation of highly active catalysts with light-switchable OVs toward efficient, stable, and sustainable visible light N-2 fixation in mild conditions.									483	40	1	0	44	0	493			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000407565700025	28614603

Preliminary structural studies at room temperature suggest that compounds are formed in a single perovskite phase. Compositions with x = 0.02-0.04 possess orthorhombic structure while for x = 0.06-0.10 show tetragonal structure. The diffraction peaks shift slightly to a higher angle with increasing concentration of x. The ferroelectric phase-transition of these materials, shows a shift in the transition temperature towards the higher-temperature side with increased GF concentration. The magnetization increases with the increase in GF content which is clearly perceptible in the evolution of hysteresis loops indicating that GdFeO3 doped NKN has introduced ferromagnetic contribution. This may be attributed to variation in the oxygen stoichiometry, doping at different crystallite sites and change in the magnetic anisotropy. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

The resultant materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen physisorption studies, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The photocatalytic performances of these materials were evaluated by calculating the amount of hydrogen evolved from the decomposition of water under solar simulated irradiation conditions. An improvement was achieved from no H-2 evolution at all with the bare TiO2, to an evolution of 0.21 mL g(-1) h(-1) from a composite material modified with an optimum carbon loading of 3.62%. These results suggested that the interaction of carbon with predominantly rutile form of TiO2 can promote shallow trapping of photogenerated electrons in the oxygen vacancies. This phenomenon consequently enhances the photocatalytic activity by minimizing charge carrier recombination, a characteristic demonstrated by fluorescence quenching of the TiO2 emission.

Previously, when a non-regular 2D h-BN layer was grown on a Cu(111) surface, metal adatoms were found to spontaneously emerge from the bulk to fill the atomic holes in the structure and become available for surface catalysis. Herein, computational electrochemistry is used to investigate and compare the performance of Cu-doped and Cu-supported pristine and defective h-BN systems for the electrocatalytic water oxidation reaction. For the various model systems, the intermediate species of this multistep oxidation process are identified and the free-energy variations for each step of reaction are computed, even for those steps that do not involve an electron or a proton transfer. Both associative and O-2 direct evolution mechanisms are considered. On this thermodynamic basis, the potential-determining step, the thermodynamic-determining step, and consequently the theoretical overpotential are determined for comparison with experiments. Small Cu clusters (tetramers) trapped in the h-BN defective lattice on a Cu(111) support are found to be very active for the water oxidation reaction since such systems are characterized by a low overpotential and by a small energy cost for O-2 release from the catalyst, which is often observed to be a major limit for other potential electrocatalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000471314900023	30600934

In this study, tungsten phosphide-embedded carbon-thin-layer/acid-treated expanded graphite (WP-CL/AEG) composites are synthesized as Pt-supports/co-catalysts for MOR/ORR via a one-step synthesis route. For MOR, Pt-WP-CL/AEG-3 (molar ratio of P to AEG is 3.6 in precursor) shows the highest electrochemical surface area (123.05 m(2) g(Pt)(-1)) and mass activity (2217.6 mA mg(Pt)(-1)), which are respectively 1.92 and 4.44 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C (64.16 m(2) g(Pt)(-1) and 499.2 mA mg(Pt)(-1)). Pt-WP-CL/AEG catalysts also exhibit higher CO tolerance and stability than Pt/C. Moreover, Pt-WP-CL/AEG-3 also exhibits a higher ORR activity than Pt/C in acidic media, mainly via a 4e(-) transfer pathway (OH- as the main product) for ORR. As expected, AEG greatly enhances the charge transfer capacity of Pt-WP-CL/AEG catalysts; the exposed P active sites induced by W atoms on WP facilitate methanol/O-2 adsorption and activation during MOR/ORR; the CL originated from citric acid can protect WP from being oxidized in air, which contributes to high activity and stability of P active sites; and charges are transferred from AEG (positively charged) to WP via the linked-CL and then from WP to Pt, which contributes to the high MOR/ORR activity of Pt-WP-CL/AEG. It indicates that WP-CL/AEGs can be considered as promising supports/co-catalysts for Pt in MOR/ORR.									26	3	0	0	1	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451738200027

However, redox reactions such as VO2+/VO2+ in a vanadium redox flow battery have been found to possess relatively slow kinetics, resulting in significant activation losses during operation. In this work, we demonstrate a facile and scalable method for nitrogen doping of carbon paper electrodes, leading to superior electrocatalytic activity. The effects of pyrolytic pretreatments under different conditions on the performance of carbon paper were also studied to elucidate their electrocatalytic activity from a material physics perspective, using Raman spectroscopy. The 2D Raman signature, a specific feature of the carbon structures, was employed to understand the effect of different pretreatments on the Fermi level of the carbon papers, which could help us elucidate their intrinsic electron transfer kinetics. The full wave half-maximum of the 2D Raman band and the intensity ratio I-2D/I-G were used to indicate changes in the Fermi level relative to the untreated carbon paper, and hence the electrocatalytic properties, which were confirmed using voltammetric techniques. Although heating of carbon paper in air at around 500 degrees C (a widely used method for activating carbon paper electrodes) increases the surface area by about 16 times compared to untreated and nitrogen-doped carbon paper, the latter exhibits superior electrocatalytic property for VO2+/VO2+, [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-), and the oxygen reduction reaction. This study provides greater physical insights into different pretreatments in terms of the energy barrier at the interface, which will aid the pursuit for better carbon-based electrode materials and provide mechanistic details about charge transfer processes at the interface.									26	1	0	0	2	0	26			2574-0962			WOS:000462944700084

Anchoring active electrocatalysts with controllable loading and uniform dispersion onto suitable supports has become an attractive topic. This is because the supports can not only have the potential to improve catalytic activity and stability through the interaction between support and catalytic center, but also can reduce precious metal consumption by improving atomic utilization. Herein, recent theoretical and experimental progresses concerning the development of supports to anchor electrocatalytic materials are first reviewed. Next, their controllable syntheses, characterization techniques, metal-support electronic interactions, and structure-performance relationships are presented. Some representative carbon supports and non-carbonaceous supports, as well as recently reported star supports such as 2D supports, single atom catalysts, and self-supported catalysts are also summarized. In addition, the significant role of support in stabilizing and regulating catalytic active sites is particularly emphasized. Finally, challenges, opportunities, key problems, and further promising solutions for supported catalysts are proposed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-9608			WOS:000850604400001	36070422

The unique 0D/2D structure allows Cu3P and MoO3 to be in close contact to provide more active sites, and a p-n heterojunction was established at the metallurgical interface. The existence of built-in electric field in the barrier region erects a fast transfer channel for electrons, which significantly improves transfer kinetics. Additionally, SEM, TEM, UV-vis, XPS, XRD, BET, PL and TRPL were used to study the reasons for the increase in hydrogen production activity and the intrinsic properties of the photocatalyst. Finally, a feasible photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction mechanism under dye-sensitized conditions is proposed. Our work has provided motivation for using the earth's abundant transition metal phosphides to design and improve the photocatalytic activity of wide-bandgap semiconductor photocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2468-8231			WOS:000713698700010

Despite the importance of dopants, little is known about the underlying mechanisms for the change of the system properties. We have performed density functional theory calculations to investigate the influence of different valent ions on the O-2 evolution reaction activity of beta-MnO2 and Mn2O3. While Mn2O3 is unaffected by dopants, beta-MnO2 is strongly affected by ions placed in a subsurface position. Doping does not affect the ion charge at the active site, but instead it effects the bond character. This is concluded through an analysis of the density overlap regions indicator and the density of states showing that the partially covalent nature of the bonds in beta-MnO2 is responsible for the changes in the adsorbate binding energies. This mechanism is not active in the mostly ionic Mn2O3. These results highlight the need to explicitly consider the detailed bonding situation and to go beyond simple charge transfer considerations when describing doping of transition metal oxide catalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000422814200023

III) and extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars of low- and intermediate-masses experience mixing of hydrogen into the helium convection during the early TP-AGB phase, differently from the metal-rich stars. We have studied nucleosynthesis in the helium convective zone with C-13 formed from mixed protons as a neutron source by using a nuclear network from H through S. In the absence or scarcity of pristine metals, neutron-recycling reactions, C-12 (n, gamma) C-13 (alpha, n) O-16 and also O-16 (alpha, gamma) O-17 (alpha, n) Ne-20 promote the synthesis of 0 and light elements, including their neutron-rich isotopes and the odd atomic number elements. Based on the results, we demonstrate that the peculiar abundance patterns of C through Al observed for the three most iron-deficient, carbon-rich stars can be reproduced in terms of nucleosynthesis in Pop. III, AGB stars in three different mass ranges. We argue that these three stars were born as low-mass members of Pop. Ill binaries, and later were subjected to surface pollution by mass transfer in the binary systems. It is also shown that AGB nucleosynthesis with hydrogen mixing explains the abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, and Al observed for most of carbon-enhanced EMP (CEMP) stars, including all CEMP-s stars with s-process elements. In addition, the present results are used to single out nucleosynthetic signatures of the early generations of stars other than AGB stars.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0004-6264	2053-051X		WOS:000271364100002

Herein, taking the oxidation of 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by H2O2 as the model reaction, we investigate the possible catalytic mechanisms using DFT calculations. The results indicate that the carbonyl groups are the active centers. The activation of the C=O bond is the key step in the catalytic cycle.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop high-performance water oxidation photocatalysts. Herein, the Fe-doped Bi2WO6 nanosheets with oxygen vacancies (OVs) were synthesized for enhanced photocatalytic water oxidation efficiency, showing a synergistic effect between Fe dopants and OVs. When a molar fraction of 2% Fe was doped into the Bi2WO6 nanosheets, the visible-light-driven photocatalytic oxygen evolution rate was increased up to 131.3 mu mol.h(-1)-g(cat)(-1) under ambient conditions, which was more than 3 times that of pure Bi2WO6 nanosheets. The proper doping concentration of Fe could promote the formation of OVs and at the same time modulate the band structure of catalysts, especially the position of the valence band maximum (VBM), leading to effective visible-light absorption and enhanced oxidizing ability of photogenerated holes. With ameliorated localized electron distribution, fast charge transfer channel emerged between the OVs and adjacent metal atoms, which accelerated the charge carrier transfer and promoted the separation of photoexcited electrons and holes. This work provides feasible approaches for designing efficient two-dimensional semiconductor water oxidation photocatalysts that could utilize visible-light, which will make more use of solar energy.									7	1	0	0	1	0	7			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000657608100006

The Dion-Jacobson phase, KCa2. NaNb4O13 perovskite was calcined under NH3 environment at various reaction durations (5 hr, 6 hr, 7 hr) to yield N3-/Nb4+ co-doped layered structures and subsequently exfoliated into ultrathin nanosheets. The N3-/Nb4+ co-doped nanosheets realized superior visible light absorption and bandgap narrowing as determined from UV-visible spectroscopy profiles. The synthesis of bulk materials and ultrathin morphology of exfoliated nano sheets were confirmed through XRD, SEM and AFM. The chemical states of the elements were examined by XPS measurements. The optimized N3-/Nb4+ co-doped CNNO--6hr nanosheets demonstrated excellent O-2 evolution of 903 mu mol g(-1) after 4 h compared to N3-/Nb4+ co-doped CNNO--5hr (510 mu mol g(-1)), N3-/Nb4+ co-doped CNNO--7hr (528 mu mol g(-1)) and non-doped CNNO- nanosheets (381 mu mol g(-1)). Our study paves a way on the feasibility of combining various chemical strategies for advanced photocatalyst design.

However, they usually suffer from two major drawbacks, poor electrochemical stability and low electrocatalytic activity in bulk form. Here, we have developed a rational strategy to fabricate a promising electrocatalyst composed of a nanoscale conductive copper-based MOF (Cu-MOF) layer fully supported over synergetic iron hydr(oxy)oxide [Fe(OH)(x)] nanoboxes. Owing to the highly exposed active centers, enhanced charge transfer, and robust hollow nanostructure, the obtained Fe(OH)(x)@Cu-MOF nanoboxes exhibit superior activity and stability for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 112 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 76 mV dec(-1). X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations unravels that the highly exposed coordinatively unsaturated Cu-1-O-2 centers could effectively accelerate the formation of key *H intermediates toward fast HER kinetics.									61	0	0	0	5	0	59			2375-2548			WOS:000645464500021	33910899

The structural and energetic properties of various C-H and C-C bond scission reactions were calculated and C-H bond breaking seems always favorable for the same species. CH2CH and CH fragments were verified as likely intermediates theoretically, in accordance with previous experiments. Three possible pathways for the formation of carbon monomer were proposed based on the analysis of the reaction network and they all feature the generation of CH as the rate-limiting step. There exists some structure sensibility for ethylene transformation on Pd catalyst on account of the notable difference between the results on Pd( 1 0 0) with that on Pd( 1 1 1) and Pd( 2 1 1) reported recently.

We found that the orr at the Pt(111) \ Br-ad interface is always accompanied quantitatively by H2O2 oxidation currents on the ring electrode, implying that in the presence of Br- anions the orr does not proceed entirely through the 4e(-) reduction pathway, as in the Br--free solution. We propose that strongly adsorbed Br- can simultaneously suppress both the adsorption of the O-2 molecule and the formation of pairs of platinum sites needed for the breaking of the O-O bond. Besides elucidating the effects of Br-ad, these studies also shed some light on the role of OHad on the kinetics of the orr on the Pt(111) surface in solution free of Br anions. We have developed a theoretical model and from simulations of I-E curves we propose two modes of action of the OHad state on the kinetics of the orr on the Pt(111) surface: (i) OHad can block the adsorption of O-2 on active platinum sites, i.e. they compete for the same sites, and (ii) OHad can alter the adsorption energy of intermediates which are formed during the orr on the bare Pt sites adjacent to the OHad.

The route also offers excellent potential for hydrogen production through wastewater remediation. Here, a simple synthetic strategy has been adopted to embed NiS in a nitrogen-rich stable and activated mesoporous carbon matrix (NOMC) that has been successfully exploited for UOR. The NOMC supported nickel sulfide catalyst with high electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) exhibits a very good response towards the electro-catalytic oxidation of urea in an alkaline medium with a low working oxidation potential (potential corresponding to the current density value of 10 mA/cm2 taken as a standard) of 1.34 V (vs. RHE). The introduction of heteroatom (N) to the mesoporous carbon support and subsequent incorporation of metal sulfide rather than metal oxide or metal hydroxide, as reported previously, is done purposefully to increase the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst through the synergistic effects of charge density with carbon support. The synergism is further supported by the comparative response in urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for NiS/NOMC catalyst compared to other Ni-based catalysts like Ni(OH)2, NiS, and NiS/CMK-3, which indicates that the activity is highest for NiS/NOMC. The catalyst attains good stability in an alkaline medium. The mesoporous carbon framework (NOMC) with considerably high BET surface area, large pore volume, and interconnected ion diffusion channels accelerate the transport of electrons through the porous surface, which makes NiS/NOMC highly efficient and stable as an electrocatalyst for the oxidation of urea in comparison to its other composite catalysts in alkaline medium.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, a facile chemical activation strategy using biomass cellulose as the carbon feedstock to fabricate isolated Fe atoms dispersed on a nitrogen doped graphene/nanocarbon hybrid is reported. This new single atom catalyst aFe-NGC worked as an excellent electrocatalyst towards the ORR compared to commercial Pt/C with 30 mV higher positive half-wave potential, larger current density, better stability and stronger methanol-tolerance. The key active sites for enhancing the ORR activity originated from the constructed high loading Fe-N/C configuration coupled with doped nitrogens, as explored by optimizing the activation temperatures and characterized by state-of-the-art techniques including aberration-corrected STEM and synchrotron XANES. This strategy could be developed into a general approach to prepare highly efficient atomic metal electrocatalysts using abundant biomass as a cost-effective carbon source.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000506883100003	31782475

Subsequently, the silver nanodecahedra were reconverted to silver nanoprisms under sodium lamp if there was sufficient citrate in the reaction system. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) optical properties of silver nanoparticles were tuned during photoinduced shape conversion. The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 QDs assisted the conversion of prisms to decahedra upon UV light irradiation. Nevertheless, the presence of TiO2 did not inhibit the photoinduced reconversion from decahedra to prisms by sodium light. It was demonstrated that citrate was indispensable in the photoinduction process. In addition, oxygen in solution played a vital role in the reversible shape conversion of silver nanoparticles. Moreover, simulated sunlight can convert silver nanoprisms to nanodecahedra instead of UV light with assistance of TiO2 QDs, which would promote the photoinduced reaction of silver nanoparticles based on a natural light source.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000343072800011	25205167

Interfacing of graphene with hexagonal boron-nitride (h-BN) leads to the formation of a hybrid sheet, namely BCN, which can be used as a stable and conductive support for an efficient single atom catalyst (SAC). Using first principles calculations, we designed a single Mo atom anchored on a defective BCN monolayer (Mo@BCN) as a durable, highly stable, and efficient SAC for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Compared to the semiconducting Mo-anchored h-BN, Mo@BCN exhibited metallic property that favored charge transport to active sites to drive the NRR. Importantly, this hybrid catalyst promoted the dominant NRR while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Investigation of the detailed mechanisms, including distal, alternating, and enzymatic mechanisms, for the reduction of N-2 to NH3 has revealed outstanding catalytic performance of Mo@BCN at the quite low overpotential of 0.42 V via the enzymatic pathway independent of carbon concentration; thus, this study would lead to a new strategy for the development of efficient and stable SACs using BN-based materials as the substrate.									89	9	0	0	2	0	90			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000473054500019

The catalyst preparation is initiated with EDOT polymerization on GCE surface by electrochemical potential cycling method, followed by the electrodeposition of Cu from a 2 mM solution of CuSO4 in 0.1 M NaClO4 at a constant potential of +0.34V vs. SHE in the form of Cu nanocubes on the PEDOT surface. Pd-PEDOT catalyst was then prepared by the partial substitution of copper by galvanic displacement with various concentrations of PdCl2. The prepared Pd/PEDOT electrocatalyst is found to be methanol resistant indicating its usefulness as fuel cell cathode. The prepared catalyst supports two electron transfer of oxygen reduction reaction in 0.5 M H2SO4. The effects of Pd and Cu contents and the quantity of PEDOT, mass and specific activities were studied. At a relatively low Pd loading of 0.57 ng/cm(2), the Pd/PEDOT should be a cost-effective alternative cathode catalyst for direct methanol fuel cells, DMFCs. This work explains the usefulness of PEDOT as good catalyst supporting material which is prepared by an eco-friendly electrochemical route.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2045-2322			WOS:000503188600003	31844318

We found that the effect of Cu2+ on growth, photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) and metabolism do not follow the same pattern. Photosynthesis was more sensitive than respiration. The analysis of chlorophyll a fluorescence transient shows that the effect of sub-lethal Cu2+ concentration in vivo, causes a reduction of the active PSII reaction centers and the primary charge separation, decreasing the quantum yield of PSII, the electron transport rate and the photosynthetic O-2 evolution. The order of sensitivity found was: Growth > photosynthetic pigments content = photosynthetic O-2 evolution > photosynthetic electron transport > respiration. The uncoupled relationship between growth and metabolism is discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									109	10	2	0	97	7	124			0045-6535	1879-1298		WOS:000246335500021	17267014

This nanojunction is formed such that 3D C3N4 nano-networks with a positively charged surface are efficiently anchored on the BiVO4 photoanode with a negatively charged surface. This electrostatic self-assembly can initiate and contribute to an intimate contact at the interfaces, leading to an enhanced photoelectrochemical activity and stability compared with that fabricated by non-electrostatic assembly. The C3N4 nano-network/BiVO4 photoanode achieved a remarkable photocurrent density of 4.87 mAcm(-2) for water oxidation at 1.23V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) after depositing FeOOH/NiOOH as oxygen-evolution co-catalyst, which is among the highest photocurrent densities reported so far for BiVO4-based photoanodes.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000441237800006	29923319

Studies of symbiotic variables independently suggest a similar endpoint-a carbon-oxygen white dwarf that, at the time of nuclear instability has accreted 0.15 to 0.20 M. of helium. In such systems helium burns in a detonation wave with such force that a detonation is also ignited in the interior of the dwarf. The entire system is disrupted and a bright display ensues, powered by the decay of Ni-56 synthesized in the explosion. We consider here the outcome of such events, calculating in detail their final composition, velocities, and light curves. The models do not fare badly compared with observations. The iron group nucleosynthesis is acceptable though there are, in some cases, substantial overproductions of Ti-44 and other isotopes of Ti, Cr, and V with respect to iron, suggesting that supernovae of this type are the origin in nature of these isotopes, but only part of the iron. The models tend to be subluminous compared with those based on carbon deflagration in white dwarfs near 1.4 M.. Interestingly, though peak luminosities are obtained that vary by up to a factor of 4, the shapes of the light curves and especially their post-peak decline rate are very similar. Future studies of radiation transport, spectral synthesis, and especially multidimensional hydrodynamics will be needed to clarify some of these properties.									441	7	0	0	0	0	442			0004-637X			WOS:A1994MZ15200030

However, conventional poly condensation induces a strong agglomeration and collapse of nanostructure, resulting in a relatively poor photocatalytic performance. To overcome this problem, we develop a gas bubbling exfoliation strategy with NH4Cl assistant to make ultrathin 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets self-assembled into a 3D macroporous network on a large scale. The hierarchical structure significantly improves the specific surface area to 176.4 m(2) g(-1) (11.6 times higher than the reference g-C3N4), which allows a large water/g-C3N4 interface for photocatalytic water reduction reaction. The ultrathin 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets show a thickness of about 1.4 nm, which greatly suppress photoinduced carriers recombination and enhance charge transfer at the interface. Furthermore, the doping of N and Cl is achieved during synthesis. As a result, the resulting g-C3N4 demonstrates a remarkable improvement in H-2 production of 12.89 mmol g(-1) h(-1), which is 21 times higher than the g-C3N4 obtained from the conventional condensation method. These explorations provide a facile guidance for the quasi 3D g-C3N4 hierarchical architecture engineering even for various energy-related applications.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Models currently predict as much as 150 times the solar abundance of S-33 in oxygen-neon nova ejecta. This overproduction factor may vary by orders of magnitude due to uncertainties in the S-33(p,gamma)Cl-34 reaction rate at nova peak temperatures. Depending on this rate, S-33 could potentially be used as a diagnostic tool for classifying certain types of presolar grains. Better knowledge of the S-33(p,gamma)(34) rate would also aid in interpreting nova observations over the S-Ca mass region and contribute to the firm establishment of the maximum endpoint of nova nucleosynthesis. Additionally, the total S elemental abundance which is affected by this reaction has been proposed as a thermometer to study the peak temperatures of novae. Previously, the S-33(p,gamma)(34) reaction rate had only been studied directly down to resonance energies of 432 keV. However, for nova peak temperatures of 0.2-0.4 GK there are seven known states in Cl-34 both below the 432-keV resonance and within the Gamow window that could play a dominant role. Direct measurements of the resonance strengths of these states were performed using the DRAGON (Detector of Recoils And Gammas of Nuclear reactions) recoil separator at TRIUMF. Additionally two new states within this energy region are reported. Several hydrodynamic simulations have been performed, using all available experimental information for the S-33(p,gamma)(34) rate, to explore the impact of the remaining uncertainty in this rate on nucleosynthesis in nova explosions. These calculations give a range of approximate to 20-150 for the expected S-33 overproduction factor, and a range of approximate to 100-450 for the S-32/S-33 ratio expected in ONe novae.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0556-2813	1089-490X		WOS:000326095900003

Both activities can be simultaneously monitored by continuous mass spectrometry in the presence of O-18(2), The light-driven O-2 exchange was shown to involve the plastoquinone pool as an electron carrier, but not cytochrome b(6)f, Photosystem II-dependent O-2 production and O-2 uptake were observed in isolated chloroplast fractions. Photosystem II-dependent oxygen exchange was insensitive to a variety of inhibitors (azide, carbon monoxide, cyanide, antimycin A, and salicylhydroxamic acid) and radical scavengers. It was, however, sensitive to propyl gallate, From inhibitors effects and electronic requirements of the O-2 uptake process, we conclude that an oxidase catalyzing oxidation of plastoquinol and reduction of oxygen to water is present in thylakoid membranes. From the sensitivity of flash-induced O-2 exchange to propyl gallate, we conclude that this oxidase is involved in chlororespiration, Clues to the identity of the protein implied in this process are given by pharmacological and immunological similarities with a protein (IMMUTANS) identified in Arabidopsis chloroplasts.									120	6	1	0	119	1	130			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000087485000008	10748104

It is well established that the local oxygen tension plays an important role in radiation-induced cell death, with hypoxic tumour regions responding poorly to irradiation. Therefore, to improve radiation response, it is important to understand more fully the spatiotemporal distribution of oxygen within a growing tumour before and during fractionated radiation. To this end, we have extended a spatially resolved mathematical model of tumour growth, first proposed by Greenspan (Stud Appl Math 51:317-340, 1972), to investigate the effects of oxygen heterogeneity on radiation-induced cell death. In more detail, cell death due to radiation at each location in the tumour, as determined by the well-known linear-quadratic model, is assumed also to depend on the local oxygen concentration. The oxygen concentration is governed by a reaction-diffusion equation that is coupled to an integro-differential equation that determines the size of the assumed spherically symmetric tumour. We combine numerical and analytical techniques to investigate radiation response of tumours with different intratumoral oxygen distribution profiles. Model simulations reveal a rapid transient increase in hypoxia upon regrowth of the tumour spheroid post-irradiation. We investigate the response to different radiation fractionation schedules and identify a tumour-specific relationship between inter-fraction time and dose per fraction to achieve cure. The rich dynamics exhibited by the model suggest that spatial heterogeneity may be important for predicting tumour response to radiotherapy for clinical applications.									24	0	0	0	13	0	24			0092-8240	1522-9602		WOS:000431110400012	29488054

In this work, we have realized the morphological evolution of PdIr nanostructures in aqueous solution through the synergistic effect of self-assembled functional surfactants and different halide ions, and achieved precise control of the kinetic and thermodynamic crystalline growth due to the different reduction potential between PdCl42-, PdBr42-, and PdI42-. The actual precursors of PdCl42- resulted in ultrathin nanodendrites, PdClxBr(4-x)2- for nanosheets and fewer branched nanodendrites, PdClxI(4-x)2- for nanorings, nanoflowers and multiply concave nanocubes. Owing to the synergistic advantages of structure and composition (alloyed Ir), PdIr nanodendrites exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity, anti-poisoning ability, and stability toward alcohols (including ethanol, methanol, and glycerol) electrooxidation reactions. The results would be helpful for thoroughly understanding how structure-directing surfactants and halide ions synergistically determine the production of advanced metallic nanocrystals.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000804491700001	35650650	
J	Hamo, Eliran R.; Rosen, Brian A.								Transition metal carbides as cathode supports for PEM fuel cells								NANO RESEARCH											10.1007/s12274-022-4831-3		SEP 2022			2022	As energy demands increase and environmental issues loom, fuel cells (FCs) have attracted significant attention as an alternative to conventional energy sources. Their use encompasses portable applications, transportation, and a stationary grid-power mainly due to their low-temperature operation and quick start-up. However, the primary challenge is improving fuel cell durability to meet 2025 U.S. Department of Energy targets (e.g., 8,000+ h for automotive drive cycle). Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) catalysts currently suffer from low durability, undermining their wide-scale deployment into the consumer and industrial markets. Platinum group metals (PGMs) are still the most common catalysts used in PEMFCs as they provide among the highest activity for electrode reactions and lifetime stability. An effective way to decrease Pt loading is the adoption of supports to enhance both Pt dispersion and its durability. Corrosion of the carbon-based support was identified to be the major contributor to performance degradation as they suffer from parasitic oxidation to CO2 (at the cathode). Therefore, there is a significant interest in exploring stable alternatives to replace carbon supports in PEMFCs. Transition metal carbides (TMCs) have attracted significant attention over the last several years as a possible candidate to replace carbon-based catalyst supports in fuel cells. Despite these advantages over carbon supports, the large-scale deployment of TMC-based supports in fuel cells is still hindered by concerns of durability at the high potential on the cathode during start-up and shutdown operation. Here, we address the most relevant studies concerning TMCs as supports for acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis, including viewpoints about the surface and bulk design of the support, as well as the design of the catalyst itself to enhance the interaction and dispersion with the support.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000854851900001

Their respective morphologies were determined through scanning electron microscopy. The TG analyses in nitrogen gave fairly predictable results, but the analyses in oxygen gave complex results that seemed to be dependent on the respective morphologies of the blend samples and on the presence and amount of GrP in the respective samples. It was observed that, depending on the blend or nanocomposite morphologies, the GrP could have played the role of catalysing the degradation process, or inhibiting the onset of degradation by immobilizing the polymer or free radical chains and by delaying the evolution of the degradation products from the respective samples. The DSC results clearly showed the influence of the respective components in the blends and composites on the crystallization behaviour and crystallinities of the two polymers.									14	1	0	0	2	0	15			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000466163400018

In this work, Ti3C2Tx MXene coupled CdS nanostructures are fabricated via one-step gamma-ray radiation-induced reduction in ambient conditions. By subsequent alkaline treatment, a novel cocatalyst of carbon supported amorphous TiO2 nanosheets (denoted as aTiO(2)-C) is derived from Ti(3)C(2)Tx/CdS to form aTiO(2)-C/CdS nanocomposites. The prepared aTiO(2)-C/CdS nanocomposites with cyclability achieve a H-2 evolution rate of 1.48 mmol.g(-1).h(-1) under visible-light illumination, which is 6.4 and 7.0 times greater than that of pristine Ti3C2Tx/CdS and P-CdS, respectively. The oxygen vacancies in aTiO(2)-C cocatalysts are revealed to act as electron trapping sites to facilitate the transfer of photoexcited electrons and boost photoactivity. Further, the electronic interaction between CdS and aTiO(2)-C prevents Cd2+ from leaching and thus enhances photostability. The results of this work may guide the rational design of viable cost-effective cocatalysts in solar-to-chemical energy conversion and beyond.									22	3	0	0	0	0	23			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000564001300004

TS is a dc-driven self-pulsing discharge of streamer-to-spark transition type. The presented kinetic model defines the temporal evolution of reduced electric field strength E/N, gas temperature, and density of neutrals N during the evolution of TS discharge, so that calculated electron density is in agreement with experimental results. We studied the mechanism of the streamer-to-spark transition and breakdown in TS using this model. We assume that the breakdown mechanism in TS is based on the gas density decrease and can be summarized as follows: heating of the channel -> increase in the pressure -> hydrodynamic expansion -> decrease in N in the core of the channel -> increase in E/N -> acceleration of ionization processes. However, this mechanism is influenced by species accumulated due to previous TS pulses at higher TS repetition frequencies. Sensitivity analysis focused on major electron loss and production processes indicates an important role of the amount of O-2 dissociated by the previous pulses. A lower density of O-2 means a lower rate of electron attachment, while accumulated atomic oxygen atoms lead to acceleration of electron detachment processes.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0093-3813	1939-9375		WOS:000359546500039

This paper proposes an approach to synthesize a hollow-sphere nitrogen-doped carbon shell loaded with cobalt nanoparticles derived from a polystyrene@bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework (PS@BMZIF) core@shell, which exhibits high activity as an ORR catalyst. The ORR activity can be enhanced by performing carbonization in the presence of hydrogen, resulting in the growth of additional carbon nanotubes on the hollow-sphere porous carbon shell (h_CoNC/CNT) derived from the PS@BMZIF. The electrocatalyst obtained exhibits excellent ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.894 V and long-term stability for 5000 cycles in alkaline media. The h_CoNC/CNT catalyst is applied to the membrane electrode assembly of an anion exchange membrane fuel cell, where it demonstrates a performance of 140 mA/cm(2) at 0.6 V and 133 mW/cm(2) at the maximum power density and improves mass transfer. The exceptional electrochemical properties of h_CoNC/CNT can be attributed to its desirable hollow-sphere structure with CNTs and the adjustment of efficient active sites of the nitrogen-doped porous material. These findings suggest a potential approach by which to select the structure of the ZIFs and control the pyrolysis condition for ZIF-derived ORR electrocatalysts.

In order to investigate their composition-activity relationship, 11 samples with Ce/(Mn + Ce) atomic bulk ratios ranging from 0 to 100% were prepared by co-precipitation. Phenol was selected as a model pollutant and the catalytic oxidation was carried out in a batch slurry reactor using oxygen as the oxidizing agent under mild reaction conditions. The results showed that the catalytic activity was greatly influenced by the catalyst composition. The catalyst with Mn/Ce ratio = 6/4 was found to be the most active in reducing both phenol concentration and total organic carbon (TOC). All catalysts were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and nitrogen adsorption techniques. Systematic shifts in binding energy, diffraction angle, and reduction temperature were observed in the XPS, XRD and TPR spectra, respectively. XPS and XRD data revealed the occurrence of significant interactions between Mn and Ce oxides, resulting in the evolution of textural, structural and oxidation state with composition. TPR analysis showed that the interaction between Mn and Ce greatly improved the oxygen storage capacity of manganese and cerium oxides as well as oxygen mobility on the surface of catalyst. Catalytic active sites have been ascribed to manganese oxide species exhibiting higher oxidation state. Furthermore. XPS revealed that the most active catalyst, i.e. Mn/Ce 6/4, exhibits an electron-rich surface which may be very important in the activation of adsorbed oxygen. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Although it is well known that carbon nanotubes can influence the catalytic activity of transition metal nanoparticles, insights into whether the unrolling of carbon nanotubes can be exploited to enhance the oxygen reduction performance are lacking. Herein we demonstrate the transformation from FeS/Fe3C nanoparticles coupled S, N dual doped carbon nanotubes (FeS/Fe3C@S, N-C) to nanosheets can yield the improved oxygen reduction performance. Under a glucose protective strategy, the walls of FeS/Fe3C@S, N-C nanotubes were unrolled and extended, creating FeS/Fe3C nanoparticles coupled S, N dual doped carbon nanosheets (FeS/Fe3C@S, N-C g(50)) with larger surface area and higher doping level, which allowed for the exposure of sufficient accessible active sites. Consequently, FeS/Fe3C@S, N-C g(50) exhibited an onset potential of 0.938 V, together with low peroxide yield, good selectivity and durability. Our investigations showed that the carbon matrix with an opened structure and abundant accessible active sites is critical to the electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the synergetic effect of the S, N dual doped carbon nanosheets and FeS/Fe3C nanoparticles contributed to the enhanced oxygen reduction activity. We expect the presented structureeactivity relationship can provide guidance for future design of advanced electrocatalysts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Combined IO structure and plasmon material (MoO3-x) is found to show much higher light capture capability and carrier separation and transfer efficiency than those with single control factor, which could enhance photocatalyst activity of RhB degradation and H-2 evolution significantly. The mechanisms for such synergy effect were investigated in depth. Comparing with non-plasmonic IO-TiO2-MoO3, the type II heterojunction, the more abundant oxygen vacancies and Mo5+, and the high-energy "hot electron" of plasmonic MoO3-x are believe to account for the high photoelectrical properties and high activity of IO-TiO2-MoO3-x. Comparing with bulk-TiO2-MoO3-x, the introduction of IO structure brings into substantial higher light capture capability and carrier separation and transfer efficiency.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000564451700009

Thus, highly active, cost-efficient, and robust catalysts must be developed to reduce the reaction overpotential and increase electrocatalytic efficiency. In this review, recent research efforts toward developing advanced electrocatalysts based on noble metals with outstanding performance for water splitting catalysis, which is mainly dependent on their structure engineering, are summarized. First, a simple description of the water-splitting mechanism and some promising structure engineering strategies are given, including heteroatom incorporation, strain engineering, interface/hybrid engineering, and single atomic construction. Then, the underlying relationship between noble metal electronic/geometric structure and performance for water splitting is discussed with the assistance of theoretical simulation. Finally, a personal perspective is provided in order to highlight the challenges and opportunities for developing novel electrocatalysts suitable for a wide range of commercial uses in water splitting for structural engineering applications.									325	14	0	0	15	0	328			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000511263900001

Oxidative stress is usually defined as an imbalance arising when the rate of production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) exceeds the capacity of the antioxidant defence and repair mechanisms, leading to oxidative damage to biomolecules, but the concept can be expanded to include the disruption of reduction : oxidation (redox) reactions involved in cellular signalling. In this review, we consider how the need to circumvent oxidation may shape the phenotypes of organisms throughout their life and that of their offspring, underpinning a diverse range of life-history trade-offs.2. A recent explosion of interest in this field has shown that both ROS production and the capacity of animals to deal with it change from early development through to adulthood, and vary with environmental conditions and lifestyle. Oxidative stress may both stimulate and be caused by reproduction, although direct evidence of either process is surprisingly weak. Many forms of secondary sexual traits may signal the individual's oxidative balance to potential mates, but the underlying mechanisms are still debated.3. Germline cells may be especially vulnerable to oxidative stress, leading to transgenerational effects on offspring viability and possible consequences for the evolution of mate choice.4. Both antioxidant defences and the ability to repair oxidative damage tend to decline with old age, contributing to cellular and whole organism senescence. This increasing vulnerability to oxidative stress, although little studied, appears especially marked in sexually selected traits.5. Challenges for the future include the incorporation of longitudinal approaches into experiments that analyse oxidative balance over an individual's lifetime (preferably under near-natural conditions), the exploration of the genetic basis for trade-offs involving oxidative stress, the assimilation of current redox signalling knowledge, and the study of the consequences of heritable oxidative damage to germline DNA.									376	6	0	0	349	0	379			0269-8463			WOS:000281895800005

Cyclic voltammetry at as-deposited (AD) and anodically oxidized (AO) BDD were used to study the electrochemistry and to optimize the condition for HPLC applications. At AO BDD electrode, due to its higher overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction, well-defined anodic peaks were observed for the oxidation of purine and pyrimidine bases in acid medium, whereas at AD BDD the oxidation peak of thymine was overlapped with the anodic cur-rent of oxygen evolution. The chromatograms of adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine and 5-methylcytosine mixture were well resolved by using a silica-based column and a solution of 5% acetonitrile in 100 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.25) as the mobile phase. The detection was carried out at AO BDD electrode at an applied potential of 1.6 V versus Ag/AgCl. Linear calibration curves were obtained within the concentration range from 0.1 to 10 mu M with the limits of detection (S/N = 3) ranging from 26.3 to 162.1 nM, resulting in an order of magnitude higher sensitivities than those at conventional electrodes. HPLC analysis with diamond amperometric detector was successfully applied for determination of 5-methylcytosine in real DNA samples with high reproducibility.

In these experiments, sounding rockets were used to place equal quantities of CO2 above and below h(max) of the nocturnal F region. CO2 leads to 6300 Angstrom emission by a three-step process: (1) CO2 + O+ --> O-2(+) + CO, (2) O-2(+) + e(-) --> O* + O, (3) O* --> O + h nu(6300). Direct measurements of plasma parameters and indirect measurements of the neutral atmosphere densities were used in conjunction with the Fluid Element Simulation (FES) computer code to model the temporal and spatial evolution of the observed 6300 Angstrom airglow enhancement and accompanying plasma depletion. Using the currently accepted set of reaction rates relevant to F region chemistry, the quantum yield of O(D-1) from reaction (2) was found to have a mild altitude dependence, decreasing by 16% from 275 to 350 km. Since the initial vibrational distribution of the nascent O-2(+) was the same for the two releases, this result implies an altitude dependence in the quenching of O-2(+) vibrational states. Building on previous evidence that O-2(+) is vibrationally excited in the nighttime thermosphere, we further conclude that this vibrational distribution is altitude dependent. In terms of 6300 Angstrom airglow production, the effect is manifested in an altitude dependence of f(D-1). Additionally, quenching by O(P-3) was found to contribute very little to the depopulation of the nascent O(D-1), with Q(O) = o giving the best fit to the RED AIR observations.									29	2	0	0	1	0	31			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:A1996VF25700005

Herein using density functional theory calculations, we predict trends in activity for water oxidation towards H2O2 evolution on four different metal oxides, i.e., WO3, SnO2, TiO2 and BiVO4. The density functional theory predicted trend for H2O2 evolution is further confirmed by our experimental measurements. Moreover, we identify that BiVO4 has the best H2O2 generation amount of those oxides and can achieve a Faraday efficiency of about 98% for H2O2 production.									216	8	0	0	26	0	219			2041-1723			WOS:000411672800005	28951571

A Facile Synthesis of Graphene-WO3 Nanowire Clusters with High Photocatalytic Activity for O-2 Evolution								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHOTOENERGY				2014						943537	10.1155/2014/943537				2014	2014	In the present work, graphene-WO3 nanowire clusters were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. The obtained graphene-WO3 nanowire clusters were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) techniques. The photocatalytic oxygen (O-2) evolution properties of the as-synthesized samples were investigated by measuring the amount of evolved O-2 from water splitting. The graphene-WO3 nanowire clusters exhibited enhanced performance compared to pure WO3 nanowire clusters for O-2 evolution. The amount of evolved O-2 from water splitting after 8 h for the graphene-WO3 nanowire clusters is ca. 0.345 mmol/L, which is more than 1.9 times as much as that of the pure WO3 nanowire clusters (ca. 0.175 mmol/L). The high photocatalytic activity of the graphene-WO3 nanowire clusters was attributed to a high charge transfer rate in the presence of graphene.									3	0	0	0	1	0	4			1110-662X	1687-529X		WOS:000340190600001

It is essential for such systems to provide a practical photocurrent response and overpotential for driving hydrogen production. Herein, electrodeposited Ni-M (M = Co, Fe, Mo) is investigated as a surface catalyst onto p-type silicon micropillar arrays for solar-driven hydrogen evolution, and the generation of catalytic active species by in situ and ex situ tracking methods is directly observed. The dynamic electronic and atomic structures of highly active surface catalysts are identified during photocatalysis in alkaline condition. Furthermore, the incorporation of high-valence Mo species acts as a key promoter for triggering the in situ formation of active Ni2+ species on the surface of alloys. These findings offer guidelines for the design and development of highly efficient catalytic photocathodes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2367-198X			WOS:000520765800001

Here we examine CaMKII, a pluripotent signaling molecule that contributes to common aging-related diseases, and find that its activation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) was acquired more than half-a-billion years ago along the vertebrate stem lineage. Functional experiments using genetically engineered mice and flies reveal ancestral vertebrates were poised to benefit from the union of ROS and CaMKII, which conferred physiological advantage by allowing ROS to increase intracellular Ca2+ and activate transcriptional programs important for exercise and immunity. Enhanced sensitivity to the adverse effects of ROS in diseases and aging is thus a trade-off for positive traits that facilitated the early and continued evolutionary success of vertebrates. Natural selection may favor traits underlying aging-related diseases if they benefit the young. Wang et al. find that oxidative activation of CaMKII provides physiological benefits critical to the initial and continued success of vertebrates but at the cost of disease, frailty, and shortened lifespan.									10	1	0	0	6	0	11			2041-1723			WOS:000658301200005	34039988	
J	He, Chunyong; Tao, Juzhou								Two-dimensional Co3W3C nanosheets on graphene nanocomposition: An Pt-like electrocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction in wide pH range								MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY				8				65	72		10.1016/j.mtener.2017.12.009				JUN 2018	2018	It is still a great challenge to replace Pt by non-precious metal electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their sluggish kinetics and poor electrochemical durability. Here, we reported a novel two-dimensional Co3W3C nanosheets on graphene nanocomposition (Co3W3C NSs/G) that synthesized by a simple two-step method. The overpotential of Co3W3C NSs/G at 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) is just 64 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, which is very close to Pt/C (37 mV). The Tafel slope of Co3W3C NSs/G is 35 mV dec(-1), which is also very close to Pt/C (30 mV dec(-1)). The exchange current density (j(0)) of Co3W3C NSs/G is 0.232 mA cm(-2), which is almost as high as Pt/C (0.279 mA cm(-2)). Overall, the Co3W3C NSs/G exhibits Pt-like catalytic activity toward HER. Furthermore, the Co3W3C NSs/G shows outstanding HER activities and extreme high electrochemical durability in a wide pH range. The density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations show that the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen bonding (Delta G(H)*, * denotes an adsorption site) of the Co3W3C is -0.15 eV, which is also very close to Pt (-0.09 eV).

J	Fujimoto, SI; Hashimoto, MA; Koike, O; Arai, K; Matsuba, R								p-process nucleosynthesis inside supernova-driven supercritical accretion disks								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				585	1			418	428		10.1086/345982				MAR 1 2003	2003	We investigate p-process nucleosynthesis in a supercritical accretion disk around a compact object of 1.4 M., using the self-similar solution of an optically thick advection-dominated flow. Supercritical accretion is expected to occur in a supernova with fallback material accreting onto a newborn compact object. It is found that an appreciable number of p-nuclei are synthesized via the p-process in supernova-driven supercritical accretion disks (SSADs) when the accretion rate (m)over dot = (M) over dot c(2)/(16L(Edd)) > 10(5), where L-Edd is the Eddington luminosity. Abundance profiles of p-nuclei ejected from SSADs have features similar to those of the oxygen/neon layers in Type II supernovae when the abundance of the fallback gas far from the compact object is that of the oxygen/neon layers in the progenitor. The overall abundance profile is in agreement with that of the solar system. Some p-nuclei, such as Mo, Ru, Sn, and La, are underproduced in the SSADs as in Type II supernovae. If the fallback gas is mixed with a small fraction of protons through Rayleigh-Taylor instability during the explosion, significant amounts of Mo-92 are produced inside the SSADs. Isotopes Ru-96 and La-138 are also produced when the fallback gas contains abundant protons, although the overall abundance profile of p-nuclei is rather different from that of the solar system. The p-process nucleosynthesis in SSADs contributes to the chemical evolution of p-nuclei, in particular Mo-92, if several percent of the fallback matter are ejected via jets and/or winds.									40	1	0	0	0	0	40			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000181046500035		
J	Juan, Pi-Chun; Lin, Kuei-Chih; Cho, Wen-Hao; Kei, Chi-Chung; Hung, Wei-Hsuan; Shi, Hao-Pin								Plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of molybdenum oxides using molybdenum hexacarbonyl as the precursor								MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS				288						126395	10.1016/j.matchemphys.2022.126395				SEP 1 2022	2022	Molybdenum oxide (MoOx) thin films are fabricated by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) using molybdenum hexacarbonyl Mo(CO)6 as the precursor and oxygen as the reactant. The effect of plasma power for oxygen has been investigated on the evolution of film structure. Molybdenum oxide shows the orthorhombic alpha-MoO3 phase at low powers and gradually changes to the metastable monoclinic beta-MoO3 phase as the power continually increases, which is confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. alpha-MoO3 is two-dimensional (2-D) phase with Pbnm space group, while beta-MoO3 film belongs to three-dimensional phase with P21/c. From the observation of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a rod-like structure has been detected, whereas a bulk-like grain corresponds to a high ratio of beta-MoO3 to alpha-MoO3 phase at higher power of 150 W. Due to better coverage of 2-D layer preventing surface from oxidation, the interfacial layer of alpha-MoO3 checked from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows thinner at low powers when contacting with silicon substrate, which is consistent with the performance of leakage current. The changes in binding energies of Mo 3d and O 1s orbits at different milling depths are compared by different powers. Though the significant amount of Mo4+ oxidation state is shown from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), only alpha-MoO3 and beta-MoO3 crystallites with +6 state of Mo are observed from x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. Above phenomenon is due to the structural change caused by the loss of oxygen atoms. Thus, according to the charge transformation and compensation, the defect reaction model can well explain that oxygen vacancies inside films are more prevalent in orthorhombic phase at low plasma power for oxygen of our reduced MoO3-x.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000826598100001		
J	Cheng, Bin; Xu, Jianbing; Liang, Yungan; Deng, Qian; Tian, Yankuan; Liao, Zewen								Determination and geochemical implication of multiple series of long-chain oxygen-bearing compounds trapped in kerogen in the Lucaogou Formation, Santanghu Basin, NW China								ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY				121				68	79		10.1016/j.orggeochem.2018.04.005				JUL 2018	2018	Studies of occluded oxygen-bearing compounds inside kerogen are scarce, although such studies are important in understanding early-stage transformation of organic matter. A relatively low-maturity kerogen from the late Permian mudstone of the Lucaogou Formation of the Santanghu Basin, northwestern China, was successively extracted with n-hexane, acetone and dichloromethane to release the adsorbed components, and the extracted kerogen was treated with a mild oxidation reagent H2O2 to release the occluded components. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the adsorbed and occluded components revealed a suite of oxygen-bearing compounds, including n-alkan-2-ones, n-aldehydes and fatty acid methyl esters. The n-alkan-2-ones were mainly detected in the adsorbed fraction and n-aldehydes in the occluded component. Comparison of the long-chain oxygen-bearing compound distributions and their individual stable carbon isotope characteristics both suggest that the oxygen-bearing compounds released by H2O2 treatment were occluded in the kerogen. The shorter-chain (C-15 to C-19) occluded n-aldehydes reflected similar isotopic distribution trends to the adsorbed n-alkan-2-ones, and the delta C-13 values of the mid-length (C-21 to C-25) occluded n-aldehydes were much closer to the adsorbed n-alkanes. Bacterially mediated methylation and decarbonylation of the n-aldehydes during kerogen formation may be important source(s) of n-alkan-2-ones and n-alkanes, respectively. The mid-chain ketones mainly originated from hydrothermal alteration of n-alkanes after kerogen formation. Uplift of the Lucaogou Formation in the Yuejingou section allowed surface-enhanced aerobic reactions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TUMOR BIOLOGY				33	1			195	205		10.1007/s13277-011-0262-6				FEB 2012	2012	The metabolism of cultured cancer cells is stimulated by 21% oxygen and generous nutrition, while real tumors grow in oxygen and nutrient-restricted environments. The effect of these contrasted conditions was studied in five hyperploid (54-69) cancer cell lines. When grown under anoxia and in the presence of antioxidant metabolic restrictors, the cell lines quickly reverted to almost normal chromosome numbers (47-49). The stepped withdrawal of oxygen over K562 showed progressive increases in proliferation rate and the acquisition of a stable, stem phenotype. In genetic studies, hyperploid cancer cells adjusted their chromosome numbers up or down to match their micro-environment through rapid mechanisms of endo-reduplication or chromosome loss. These fast reactions may explain the surprising adaptability of tumor cells to oncologic interventions. Furthermore, karyotype contraction may provide a basis for the previously observed carcinogenic influence of the administration of some antioxidants in human populations.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1010-4283	1423-0380		WOS:000297866700021	22090169

The structure, morphology and surface chemical state of the prepared samples were well characterized. The AFM images (Atomic force microscopy) present that the average thickness of the nanosheets for two typical samples are about 0.81 and 0.84 nm, respectively. The analysis results of O 1s XPS and in-situ ESR indicate that there are different concentration oxygen vacancies (OVs) in two prepared samples (denoted as Vo-rich and Vo-poor). Time-resolved fluorescence emission decay spectra show that the carriers lifetime of Vo-rich and Vo-poor are 5.18 and 1.59 ns, respectively. Moreover, in-situ FTIR of benzyl alcohol (BA) absorption results suggest that rich oxygen vacancies could facilitate BA coordination. Vo-rich and Vo-poor present 38.2% and 7.1% of conversion with high selectivity for benzyl alcohol oxidation under visible light irradiation, respectively. The higher performance for Vo-rich was attributed to rich oxygen vacancies which act as the sites for the reactant activation. Finally, a feasible reaction mechanism was proposed to elucidate that enhanced photocatalytic activity over the Vo-rich.									134	8	0	0	15	0	135			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000453616800002

Comparison of the in situ action spectra with absorption spectra of PSII and PSI complexes isolated from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 revealed a shoulder at 650 nm that indicated presence of Chl b in the both photosystems of P hollandica. Fitting of two action spectra to absorption spectrum of the cells showed a chlorophyll ratio of 4:1 in favor of PSI. Effective antenna sizes estimated from photochemical cross-sections of the relevant photoreactions were found to be 192 +/- 28 and 139 +/- 15 chlorophyll molecules for the competent PSI and PSII reaction c:enters, respectively. The value for PSI is in a quite good agreement with previous electron microscopy data for isolated Pcb-PSI supercomplexes from P. hollandica that show a trimeric PSI core surrounded by a ring of 18 Pcb subunits. The antenna size of PSII implies that the PSII core dimers are associated with similar to 14 Pcb light-harvesting proteins, and form the largest known Pcb-PSII supercomplexes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Although microRNAs first appeared highly conserved among plant species, several aspects of biogenesis, function and evolution of microRNAs were shown to differ. High throughput transcriptome and degradome analyses enable to identify small RNAs and their mRNA targets. A non-photosynthetic tissue particularly prone to redox reactions, laticifers from Hevea brasiliensis, revealed species-specific post-transcriptional regulations. This paper sets out to identify the 407 genes of the thirty main redox-related gene families harboured by the Hevea genome. There are 161 redox-related genes expressed in latex. Thirteen of these redox-related genes were targeted by 11 microRNAs. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a mutation in the miR398 binding site of the cytosolic CuZnSOD. A working model was proposed for transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation with respect to the predicted subcellular localization of deduced proteins.									10	0	0	0	7	0	10			2045-2322			WOS:000463482800041	30952924

The thickness, morphology and microstructure of these coatings are controlled by the growth conditions. The deposition process has been used for the preparation of Ti/IrOx/SnO2 electrodes that were tested for the anodic oxidation of organic pollutants in industrial wastewater. These anodes exhibit a high overpotential for oxygen evolution and a good efficiency for the elimination of total organic carbon (TOC) from wastewater. Electrochemical impedance measurements were used to characterize the activity of the interface SnO2/aqueous media as a function of time during the oxidation process. The influence of the grain size, thickness and surface pre-treatment of the Ti substrate on the electrocatalytic properties is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Surface-enhanced resonance Raman (SERR) spectro-electrochemistry has a great potential to give insight into the reaction mechanism of such molecular catalysts attached to electrodes under turnover conditions. However, the intrinsic catalytic activity of plasmonic supports and photoinduced side-reactions make the in situ analysis of their structures very challenging. In this work, the structure of hangman complexes attached to electrodes via dip-coating was investigated during catalytic turnover by electrochemistry and SERR spectroscopy. In order to explore the relevance of the hanging group for proton supply, complexes bearing a carboxylic acid and an ester hanging group were compared. For the former, SERR spectra recorded under turnover conditions indicate the reductive formation of a Co-III-H species, followed by laser-induced translocation of a proton to the carboxylic hanging group and the associated formation of the CoI state. Due to the lack of a proton accepting group, hangman complexes with an ester group could not be trapped in the Co-I intermediate state and as a consequence SERR spectra solely reflected the (photo-enriched) Co-II resting state under turnover conditions. These results represent the first Raman spectroscopic insights into intermediates of dihydrogen evolution catalysed by cobalt hangman complexes on electrodes and support the direct involvement of the hanging group as a proton shuttle.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000432082800008

Here, we present the construction of uniform PtCo nanoparticles grown on N-doped carbon frameworks via pyrolyzing Pt and Co ions adsorbed polyaniline, whereby the nanostructure of the nanoalloys can be effectively tuned by controlling the calcination temperature. As-prepared PtCo@NC-900 shows the optimal HER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4, resulting in a high mass activity of 4.31 A mg(Pt)(-1) and excellent operation durability, which far exceeds that of commercial 20 wt % Pt/C (0.30 A mg(P)(t)(-1)). Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the improved HER activity on PtCo(111) is originated from the strong electronic interaction between Pt and Co with favorable electron transfer, allowing for a more suitable binding strength for hydrogen (i.e., Delta G(*H) = -0.164 eV) compared with that of pristine Pt(111) (-0.287 eV).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1948-7185			WOS:000813439300001	35666168

Here, flake Znln(2)S(4) grew in situ on the surface of black porous zinc oxide (B-ZnO), and finally a binary composite material (B-ZnO/ZnIn2S4) is synthesized. Based on the reduction process of U(VI), the chemical reaction of the U(VI) & RARR; U(IV) process occurred on the surface and interface of the composite material. The S scheme heterojunction system constructed of ZnO and Znln(2)S(4) with a matching band structure showed great potential for promoting the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers and obtaining powerful photoredox capabilities. By generating biologically toxic free radical reactive oxygen species and Zn2+, the adsorbent had high antibiological fouling activity. After 120 min of extraction in simulated seawater, the light-induced reduction ability of B-ZnO/ZnIn2S4-45% (mass ratio) on U(VI) reached 99%, which was 6.2 times higher than that under dark conditions. The conversion path of U(VI) was calculated by density functional theory (DFT). In addition, ZnIn2S4 (007) exhibited the ability to localize to the surface of ZnO (002) and promote electron transfer. These results indicate that interface atomic structure engineering is crucial for the synthesis of efficient and durable seawater U(VI) extraction catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773397500002

The electrocatalytic studies of L-Cy-rGO for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HOR) have been demonstrated, as important fuel-cell oxidation and reduction reactions confirm its bifunctional nature. The electrochemical ORR performance of L-Cy-rGO is significantly improved with an onset potential of 0.77 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a current density of -2.32 mA/cm(2) in O-2-saturated 0.5 M KOH electrolytes. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and chronoamperometric (i-t) measurements of the electrocatalyst are also carried out toward determining the feasibility of electron transfer and current/potential stability at the interface. The L-Cy-rGO electrocatalyst shows excellent activity toward ORR in alkaline medium. Furthermore, L-Cy-rGO shows better electrocatalytic activity toward HOR at an onset potential of 1.01 V vs RHE and the maximum current density of 65 mA/cm(2) at a potential of 1.59 V vs RHE at 35 mu M hydrazine hydrate in 0.5 M KOH. The electrochemical studies show that the L-Cy-rGO exhibits the highest electrocatalytic activity toward hydrazine oxidation. Moreover, the L-cysteine-functionalized graphene oxide supporting material plays an excellent role that could be from their synergistic catalytic effect. The L-Cy-rGO electrocatalyst shows excellent electrochemical ORR and HOR performances due to the presence of S- and N-heteroatom-containing surface of GO that enhances the electrocatalytic activity and electron transfer capabilities toward the ORR. Morphological studies based on high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirm that the size of L-Cy-rGO is similar to 10 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms the surface functionalization of GO by L-cysteine (L-Cy-rGO) from the binding energies of C-S, C-N, C-O, and C-C signals. Based on these findings, we find that the metal-free amino acid-functionalized carbon-based electrocatalyst shows excellent electrochemical ORR and HOR performances and demonstrate its key role toward enhancement in activities.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000641201400035

Here, we demonstrate that dendrite-like plasmonic CuNi bimetal, used as a nonsemiconductor photocatalyst, produces electrons for photocatalytic water splitting by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of the CuNi bimetal. Carbon quantum dots (CQDs), by virtue of their outstanding charge transfer properties, serve as a co-catalyst that can facilitate the transfer of the photoinduced charge. The photocatalytic water splitting rate of the CuNi bimetal was significantly improved after modification with CQDs, and the highest hydrogen evolution rate was 55.19 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), with an oxygen evolution rate of 27.51 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), when the content of CQDs in the photocatalyst was 3 wt%. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization reveal that the structure and state of the element in the photocatalyst remain unchanged after four consecutive cycles of, cumulatively, 20 h. Our findings may help in the development of a non-semiconductor driven photocatalytic system for application in the photocatalytic field. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we report the preparation of IrCo nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped carbon (IrCo/NC) as a HER electrocatalyst in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The IrCo/NC composite is obtained by pyrolyzing an Ir-doped Co (OH)(2) precursor on g-C3N4, and is endowed with N-doped carbon and uniform IrCo alloy nanoparticles via a crystal confinement resulting from the Ir-doping into the Co(OH)(2) layer. Electrocatalytic analysis shows that the IrCo/NC electrode requires low overpotentials of 32 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 33 mV in 1 M KOH, which are superior to those of the Co/NC and IrCo alloys that are free of Irdoping or N-doped carbon. The results provide a strategy for designing and preparing active noble-transition bimetallic alloy electrocatalysts as efficient HER catalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000575307000014	32945314

Surface engineering of bimetallic oxides is a promising way to boost the catalytic activity by the regulation of electronic structure and surface property. Herein, a dual P, S-anions modification strategy is developed to optimize the catalytic performance of CoMoO4 nanowire arrays. The formations of CoP and Co3S4 species on the CoMoO4 surface bring heterojunction interfaces for more catalytic active sites and strong electronic interaction for faster interfacial charge transfer. Benefiting from these advantages, the P, S-CoMoO(4 )catalyst on nickel foam (NF) delivers excellent catalytic activity and stability. The overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2) of P, S-CoMoO4/NF for HER are just 31 mV in acid media and 58 mV in alkaline media, respectively. In addition, by assembling the P, S-CoMoO4/NF as bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting, the electrolyzer exhibits a voltage of as low as 1.66 V at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2). This work put forward a new avenue for the development of advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Thorough morphological characterizations revealed that significant variation of the morphology of products originated from varying the amount of Pb/Ni precursors injection. Thermodynamic calculation and experimental results indicated that Pb more active than Ni towards Te template at 298 K. Serving as lithium ion battery (LIB) anode material, the discharge capacities of the NiTe-PbNiTe (Ni = 0.3 g, atomic ratio I-Ni:pb = 1.5:1) electrode for the 1st and 200th cycles are 493.5 and 208.4 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 0.5 A g(-1), and NiTe-PbNiTe (Ni = 1.0 g, = 4.8:1) catalysts show electrocatalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 387 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 96 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution, which are superior to the pristine PbTe, NiTe and their powder mixtures (NiTe + PbTe) and other different Ni addition amount samples under the identify condition. This behaviour indicates that a suitable substitution of Pb with Ni and heterostructure nanorod do have profound synergistic effects on the electrochemical performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Examining gene expression changes in infected fleas could reveal pathways that affect Y. pestis survival in fleas and subsequent transmission. We used suppression subtractive hybridization to identify genes that are induced in Xenopsylla cheopis (Rothschild) (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae) in response to oral or hemocoel infection with Y. pestis. Overall, the transcriptional changes we detected were very limited. We identified several genes that are likely involved in the production or removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Midgut ROS levels were higher in infected fleas and antioxidant treatment before infection reduced ROS levels and resulted in higher bacterial loads. An ROS-sensitive mutant strain of Y. pestis lacking the OxyR transcriptional regulator showed reduced growth early after infection. Our results indicate that ROS may limit Y. pestis early colonization of fleas and that bacterial strategies to overcome ROS may enhance transmission.									19	0	0	0	19	0	19			0022-2585	1938-2928		WOS:000301446400019	22493856

Deviating from an all-thiophene backbone, using poly(1,4-di(2-thienyl))benzene (PDTB) lowers the highest occupied molecular orbital level by approximate to 0.3 eV compared with polythiophene, and PDTB simultaneously maintains the photoelectrocatalytic properties without an all-thiophene backbone, resulting in very high conversion rate of 600 mmol(H-2) h(-1) g(-1) at 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at pH 11. PDTB shows the same non-Nernstian behavior as PTTh with increasing onset potential (versus RHE) at higher pH, and the open circuit potential on PDTB under visible light reaches 1.4 V versus RHE at pH 12. The PDTB photocathode thus produces a photovoltage above the theoretical potential for the complete water-splitting (1.229 V) and is indeed able to produce hydrogen in a one-photon-per-electron light-driven water splitting setup with MnOx as the anode at a rate of 6.4 mmol h(-1) g(PDTB)(-1).									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000458338300002

To gain insight into the contributions of the heteroatoms, we developed a facile and reproducible method for constructing Fe, N, S-codoped carbon frameworks derived from self-assembled Fe3O4 nanocrystal superlattices. The material constructed by the suggested method exhibited excellent ORR activity with more positive half-wave potential (similar to 0.869V, vs RHE), higher diffusion-limiting current density (similar to 5.88mA/cm(2)) and smaller Tafel slope (45mV/dec) compared with Fe, N-codoped carbon frameworks and Pt/C. Notably, Fe3O4 nanocrystals served as both the building blocks for constructing carbon frameworks and the source of Fe residues leaving in the frameworks at the same time. By artificially tailoring the doping type and level as well as the homogeneousness of heteroatoms, the results discussed herein prove the importance of each kind of heteroatom in boosting ORR activity.									15	1	0	0	2	0	16			2196-5404			WOS:000457457300001	30710178

The optical and structural properties of different samples were examined using N-2 adsorption-desorption analysis, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction results confirmed the insertion of Ni2+ into the lattice of TiO2, and the crystallite size reduced remarkably after the addition of NiO. The diffuse reflectance spectroscopy spectra displayed obvious red shift in the absorption edges, and new absorption bands appeared in the visible region when NiO was added, which indicates the formation of surface defects and oxygen vacancies. The optical band gap of TiO2 reduced sharply when the contents of NiO were increased. The increase in the surface defects as well as oxygen vacancies were examined using PL spectroscopy. The photocatalytic performance of the as-synthesized samples was investigated over photodegradation of brilliant green (BG) and phenol and hydrogen generation under visible light. 10% NiO/TiO2 exhibited the highest photocatalytic efficiency. The photocatalytic activity was improved due to the creation of a p-n junction at the interface of NiO/TiO2, which efficiently promotes the separation of photogenerated electron/hole pairs and consequently enhances its photodegradation activity. According to the photocatalytic activity results, NiO contents were considered one of the most important factors affecting the photodegradation of BG and phenol and H-2 evolution. Also, we discussed the mechanism of photodegradation, mineralization (total organic carbon), and photocatalytic reaction kinetics of BG and phenol.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			2470-1343			WOS:000721114500016	34805670

Thus, developing highly active and economically competitive HOR/HER electrocatalysts for alkaline electrolytes is of critical importance to realize future hydrogen economy. Herein, we for the first time report a new class of platinum-rhodium nanoalloy aerogel (PtRh NAA) via a facile and controllable strategy as exceptional HOR/HER electrocatalysts in alkaline environment. The as-synthesized PtRh NAA features unique lamellar architecture, hierarchical pores system and abundant low-coordinated sites. Benefiting from the combined structural and electronic effects as well as bifunctional synergetic effects, the lamellar PtRh NAA delivers an excellent HOR specific activity of 1.25 mA cm(pt+Rh)(-2), which is 5.5 times higher than that of the commercial Pt/C (0.225 mA cm(pt)(-2)). Meanwhile, its HER overpotential at -10 mA cm(-2) can be lowered to -55 mV, representing one of the highest HER activity so far. Moreover, no obvious deactivations are observed even after 5000 potential cycles for both HOR and HER, exhibiting excellent operation stability. These findings open a new field to design more advanced aerogels with high electrocatalytic performance.									24	2	0	0	2	0	24			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000482496300036

It was shown that the efficiency of H-2 generation by the Pt4+ exchanged LTA zeolite powders without further heat-treatment was higher than the counterpart of the samples with heat treatment. In addition, the samples with lower Pt loading concentration showed higher H-2 evolution rate than those of higher Pt loading did. The higher H-2 evolution efficiency can be attributed to the effective isolation of water molecules and Pt at the atomic or the few atom 'cluster' scale by LTA zeolite's periodical porous structure, which ensures a more efficient electron transfer efficiency for H-2 evolution. However, after extra heat treatment, the Pt atoms reduced from Pt4+ in LTA zeolite's cavities may tend to migrate to the surface and then form nano-particles, which led to the lower H-2 evolution efficiency.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2053-1591			WOS:000432447400003

With an aim to modulate the metallic nucleation or the growth of metal nanoparticles, the CoP nanoparticles are served as the bridge to deposit Rhodium (Rh) nanoparticles on carbon black in this work. These on-site deposited Rh nanoparticles are uniform , feature controllable sizes. Their size effect on the performance of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is then revealed. The Rh nanoparticles with a size of -3.23 nm shows excellent HER activity such as the overpotential of only 3 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(2), far surpassing other reported Rh-based catalysts. The integrated anion exchange membrane water electrolysis system using this catalyst delivers a cell voltage of 1.81 V at a current density of 1 A cm(-2) and a charge transfer resistance of 0.299 Omega at 60 degrees C, which are smaller than those (1.84 V and 0.337 Omega) obtained using a commercial 20 wt% Pt/C-JM catalyst.

However, its relatively low oxide-ion conductivity hinders its wide practical applications and thus needs to be further optimized. Herein, a new recently developed glass crystallization route was used to prepare a series of Ga-doped Ca12Al14-xGaxO33 (0 <= x <= 14) materials, which is not accessible by the traditional solid-state reaction method. Phase evolution with the content of gallium, the corresponding structures, and their electrical properties were studied in detail. The X-ray diffraction data revealed that a pure mayenite phase can be obtained for 0 <= x <= 7, whereas when x > 7, the samples crystallize into a melilite-like orthorhombic Ca5Ga6O14-based phase. The electrical conduction studies evidence no apparent enhancement in the total conductivity for compositions 0 <= x <= 7 with the mayenite phase, and therefore, the rigidity of the framework cations and the width of the windows between cages are not key factors for oxide-ion conductivity in mayenite Ca12Al14O33-based materials, and changing the free oxygen content through aliovalent cation substitution may be the right direction. For compositions with a pure melilite-like orthorhombic phase, the conductivities also mirrored each other and are all slightly higher than those of the mayenite phases. These melilite-like Ca5Ga6O14-based materials show mixed Ca-ion, oxide-ion, and electron conduction. Furthermore, the conduction mechanisms of Ca ions and oxide ions in this composition were studied by a bond-valence-based method. The results suggested that Ca-ion conduction is mainly due to the severely underbonded Ca3 ions and that the oxide ions are most likely transported via oxygen vacancies.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000620345400036	33535755

Mononuclear phagocytes, an inflammatory cell capable of generating a variety of oxidizing species, are early components of arterial lesions. Their normal functions include host defense and surveillance through regulated generation of diffusible radical species, reactive oxygen or nitrogen species, and HOC1 (hypochlorous acid). However, under certain circumstances an excess of these oxidizing species can overwhelm local antioxidant defenses and lead to oxidant stress and oxidative tissue injury, processes implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. This review focuses on oxidation reactions catalyzed by myeloperoxidase (MPO), an abundant heme protein secreted from activated phagocytes which is present in human atherosclerotic lesions. Over the past several years, significant evidence has accrued demonstrating that. MPO is one pathway for protein and lipoprotein oxidation during the evolution of cardiovascular disease. Multiple distinct products of MPO are enriched in human atherosclerotic lesions and LDL recovered from human atheroma. However, the biological consequences of these MPO-catalyzed reactions in vivo are still unclear. Here we discuss evidence for the occurrence of MPO-catalyzed oxidation reactions in vivo and the potential role MPO plays in both normal host defenses and inflammatory diseases like atherosclerosis.

These clusters provide well-defined molecular models pertinent to mechanistic understandings of complex oxide surface chemistry and catalysis. The energy gap evolution with cluster size was probed for the stoichiometric (TiO2)(n) , (V2O5)(n) , and (CrO3)(n) clusters, and each system was shown to approach the band gap of bulk oxides in a unique way. A variety of other model clusters have been characterized, such as the oxygen radical or diradical on a single W6+ site in WO4 /WO4, the superoxide (WO3)(n)(O-2 ) complexes for dioxygen activation, and terminal versus bridging oxygen in M3O2 (M = Nb, Ta) clusters. Novel chemical bonding has been observed in a number of oxide clusters. The W3O9 and W3O92 clusters were found to possess d-orbital aromaticity, whereas delta-aromaticity was discovered in the Ta3O3 cluster. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

Kinetics of chemical dissociation in the YBa2Cu3-xSnxO6.5+or-delta								Superconductivity: Physics, Chemistry, Technology				5	4			719	23						April 1992	1992	The kinetics of chemical dissociation in the YBa2Cu3d-xSnxO6.5+or-delta system with x=0-50 mass.% SnO2 has been studied by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetry (TG). The material was synthesized by solid-phase sintering. At x=0.2, a new composition, Y0.8Ba1.6Cu2.4Sn0.2O6.5+or-delta, forms in the solid state. This material melts congruently at 1493 K. It has a superconducting transition temperature Tc=87 K. The transition width is 7 K. The DTA, TG, and DTG kinetic curves are used to calculate the apparent activation energy for the loss and absorption of oxygen. It is shown that the oxygen exchange results from a sequential restructuring of the solid. Estimates of the amount of oxygen evolved show that for all values of x the compositions are capable of an oxygen exchange up to 5% at 293-673 K, up to 75% at 673-1133 K, and up to 15% at 1133-1493 K. It is concluded from X-ray diffraction and from the TG kinetic data that a partial substitution of tin for copper occurs in the interval 0.2lesxles0.4.									1	0	0		0	0	1			0235-8964			INSPEC:4181977

It is essential for growth control, involving cell division and cell wall synthesis and also involved in redox signaling, in the modulation of gene expression and regulation of enzymatic activities. Ascorbate also fulfills crucial roles in scavenging reactive oxygen species, both enzymatically and nonenzymatically, a well-established phenomenon in the chloroplasts stroma. We give an overview on these important physiological functions and would like to give emphasis to less well-known roles of ascorbate, in the thylakoid lumen, where it also plays multiple roles. It is essential for photoprotection as a cofactor for violaxanthin de-epoxidase, a key enzyme in the formation of nonphotochemical quenching. Lumenal ascorbate has recently also been shown to act as an alternative electron donor of photosystem II once the oxygen-evolving complex is inactivated and to protect the photosynthetic machinery by slowing down donor-side induced photoinactivation; it is yet to be established if ascorbate has a similar role in the case of other stress effects, such as high light and UV-B stress. In bundle sheath cells, deficient in oxygen evolution, ascorbate provides electrons to photosystem II, thereby poising cyclic electron transport around photosystem I. It has also been shown that, by supporting linear electron transport through photosystem II in sulfur-deprived Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells, in which oxygen evolution is largely inhibited, externally added ascorbate enhances hydrogen production. For fulfilling its multiple roles, Asc has to be transported into the thylakoid lumen and efficiently regenerated; however, very little is known yet about these processes.									28	4	2	0	25	0	33			0031-9317	1399-3054		WOS:000318808100001	23163968

This constraint implies that all thermodynamic properties of the fluid are uniquely determined at isobaric-isothermal conditions. The O2, H2O and CO2 fugacities (f(O2), f(H2O) and f(CO2)) of such fluids have been estimated from equations of state and fit as a function of pressure and temperature. These fugacities can be taken as characteristic for graphitic metamorphic systems in which the dominant fluid source is dehydration, e.g. pelitic lithologies. Because there are no compositional degrees of freedom for graphite-saturated fluids produced entirely by dehydration, the variance of the dehydration process is not increased in comparison with that in non-graphitic systems. Thus, compositional 'buffering' of C-O-H fluids by dehydration equilibria, a common petrological model, requires that redox reactions, decarbonation reactions or external, H/O not-equal 2, fluid sources perturb the evolution of the metamorphic system. Such perturbations are not likely to be significant in metapelitic environments, but their tendency will be to increase the f(O2) of the fluid phase. At high metamorphic grades, pyrite desulphidation reactions may cause a substantial reduction of f(H2O) and slight increases in f(O2) and f(CO2) relative to sulphur-free fluid. At low metamorphic grade, sulphur solubility in H/O less-than-or-equal-to 2 fluids is so low that pyrite decomposition must occur by sulphur-conserving reactions that cause iron depletion in silicates, a common feature of sulphidic pelites. With increasing temperature and sulphur solubility, pyrite desulphidation may be driven by dehydration reactions or infiltration of H2O-rich fluids. The absence of magnetite and the assemblages carbonate + aluminosilicate or pyrite + pyrrhotite + ilmenite from most graphitic metapelites is consistent with an H/O = 2 model for GCOH(S) fluid. For graphitic rocks in which such a model is inapplicable, a phase diagram variable that defines the H/O ratio of GCOH(S) fluid is more useful than the conventional f(O2) variable.									238	5	0	0	9	0	243			0263-4929			WOS:A1993LA75000006

The interfacial electron transfer rate and the number of active sites increased owing to the synergistic effect between the N,P-dual-doped Co2P@C core-shell and sandwich-nanostructured substrates. The presence of a high surface area and large pore sizes improved the mass-transfer dynamics. This nanohybrid showed remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward the HER in a wide pH range with good stability. The computational study and experiments revealed that the carbon atoms close to the N and P dopants on the shell of Co2P@N,P-C were effective active sites for HER catalysis and that both Co2P and the N,P dopants gave rise to an optimized binding free energy of H on the active sites.									40	3	0	0	1	0	42			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000423205200005	29024394

In this research, a novel electrocatalyst based on star-like molybdenum phosphide structure vertically grown on highly conductive graphene supported by a three-dimensional nickel foam (MoP/GR/NF) was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method followed by a phosphidization strategy at 300 degrees C. The exclusive hierarchical nanostructure with abundant porosity was beneficial for enhancing active site numbers and electrical conductivity. In particular, the formation of Mo-P impressively changed electronic structure of the resulting material, thereby accelerating electrocatalytic activity for HER in 1.0 M KOH medium. The MoP/GR/NF required small overpotentials of 95 and 189 mV to deliver current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. In addition, it also demonstrated a Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1), which was significantly smaller than that of the GR/NF, Mo-O/GR/NF, and Mo-P/NF. Furthermore, there was negligible decrease of current response and overpotential for a continuous HER during long-term operation, implying its excellent stability. The prospective catalytic activity and good stability of the MoP/GR/NF material could prospectively open a new aspect for developing effective electrocatalyst for hydrogen production in water splitting application.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1293-2558	1873-3085		WOS:000530691200006

Accordingly, through designing and constructing a Co3O4-Co heterostructure embedded in Co, N co-doped carbon polyhedra derived (Co3O4-Co@NC) from the in-situ compositions of ZIF-67 and cobalt nanocrystals synthesized by the strategy of in-situ NaBH4 reduction, the dual-active site (Co3O4-Co and Co-N-x) is synchronously realized in a MOFs derived nanomaterials. The formed Co3O4-Co@NC shows excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity with ultra-small potential gap (Delta E = E-j=10 (OER) - E-1/2 (ORR)) of 0.72 V, which surpasses the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. The theory calculation results reveal that the excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity can be attributed to the charge redistribution of Co of Co-N-x induced by the synergistic effects of well-tuned active sites of Co3O4-Co nanoparticle and Co-N-x, thus optimizing the rate-determining step of the desorption of O-2* intermediate in ORR and OH* intermediate in OER. The rechargeable Zn-air batteries with our bifunctional catalysts exhibit superior performance as well as high cycling stability. This simple-effective optimization strategy offers prospects for tuning the active site of MOF derived bifunctional catalyst in electrochemical energy devices.									31	2	0	0	0	0	32			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000593826500001

Tetragonal structure of high crystalline and pure phase Mn3O4 nanostructures was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra. Physical characteristics such as vibration, optical and morphology of the electm catalysts were examined and confirmed by Raman spectra, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectra (FTIR), photoluminescence spectra (PL) and ultra-violet diffuse reflection spectra (UV-DRS) respectively. Mn3O4 electro catalysts were deposited on GCE electrode for investigating the electrochemical behavior. The electrochemical water splitting application was demonstrated by the prepared Mn3O4 electm catalysts in conventional three electrode cell with Hg/HgO as a reference electrode and Pt mesh as a counter electrode. Higher current density of 1.31 mA/g with lowest Tafel slope value of 63 mV/dec was achieved for the prepared electro catalyst synthesized in base pH condition.

The 2D-WO3 plate arrays were prepared perpendicularly on the FTO substrate by hydrothermal method. The CoOx nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of WO3 plate arrays on FTO by chemical deposition process. The CoOx nanoparticles are distributed on the surface of WO3 plates with a diameter of about 20 nm. The CoOx/WO3 film shows enhanced photo electrochemical performance than the bare WO3 film. The highest incident-photon-to current-efficiency (IPCE) value increases from 24.9% to 49.1% when introducing CoOx. The deposited CoOx electrocatalyst on WO3 surface can transfer holes effectively through the cobalt ion valency cycle, suppress the hole's accumulation and recombination at the electrode surface, achieve the superior kinetics and consequently enhance the overall solar water oxidation efficiency.

In addition to the ground states, an excited state of O-12 at 1.8(4) MeV and two excited states of O-13 at 2.8(3) and 4.2(3) MeV were observed. Spin-parity and/or spectroscopic factors were obtained from the comparison of the differential cross-sections to distorted-wave calculations. The excited state of O-12 with a suggested spin-parity of 0(+) or 2(+) has a significantly low excitation energy, indicating that the proton shell closure at Z = 8 vanishes in O-12. The spin-parity of 1/2(+) was suggested for the 2.8 MeV state, which implies that the proton shell gap is weak in O-13, whereas the large spectroscopic factor extracted from the O-14(p, d) reaction indicates that the ground 3/2(-) state remains dominated by normal p-shell configurations. These features of O-12 and O-13 have marked similarities with their neutron-rich mirror partners Be-12 and B-13, respectively, demonstrating mirror symmetry in the fading of the shell closure at magic numbers 8 near the drip lines.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1434-6001	1434-601X		WOS:000309858600001

However, the potential of P450 monooxygenases has not been fully exploited; there are some drawbacks limiting the broader implementation of these catalysts for commercial needs. Protein engineering has produced P450 enzymes with widely altered substrate specificities, substantially increased activity and higher stability. Furthermore, electrochemical and enzymatic approaches for the replacement or regeneration of NAD(P)H have been developed, enabling the more cost-effective use of P450 enzymes.

Selenoxide elimination performed on (n-OctSe)(8)-CuPc with H2O2 under two different reaction conditions, one in MeOH/DCM medium at room temperature and another in toluene at 140 degrees C, led to the formation of nanostructured fibrous aggregates (FAs) and particulate aggregates (PAs), respectively. The structural and morphological characteristics of the prepared hierarchical aggregates have been systematically studied, thereby the coexistence of covalent and non-covalent linkage between CuPc skeletons is demonstrated by an adaptive structural ordering at the nanoscale regime. Owing to the unique structural order of hierarchical aggregates, the electrocatalytic HER overpotential (eta) and interfacial charge transfer characteristics are greatly influenced. The nanostructured PAs exhibited much lower HER overpotential (-0.172 V) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) as compared to the HER overpotential of the state-of-art materials that come under polymeric coordination complexes and pristine-metal organic frameworks (MOFs). Accompanied by high stability under acidic conditions, the high-performance catalytic behavior of PAs shows promise for the development of novel non-precious metal catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000661591400001		
J	McTavish, H								Hydrogen evolution by direct electron transfer from photosystem I to hydrogenases								JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY				123	4			644	649						APR 1998	1998	H-2 evolution by direct electron transfer from the dithionite-reduced photosystem I (PSI) complex to both hydrogenase I and hydrogenase II from Clostridium pasterianum was observed, Evidence indicates that the electron carriers on PSI that transfer electrons to hydrogenase in this system are the F-A/F-B iron-sulfur clusters on the PsaC polypeptide, the terminal bound electron accepters in PSI. Light-dependent H-2 evolution was also observed, using high potential electron donors to PSI, from a combination of hydrogenase I and either solubilized purified PSI or thylakoids, Mediators capable of transferring electrons from the PSI complex to hydrogenase were not necessary for H-2 evolution, indicating again that the mechanism of H-2 evolution is direct electron transfer from PSI to hydrogenase, and that this can occur with light-reduced as well as chemically reduced PSI, and with PSI in thylakoids as well as the solubilized complex. Light-dependent H-2 evolution was also observed from a mixture of thylakoids and the oxygen-resistant hydrogenase of Rhodococcus sp, MR11. These results suggest that direct electron transfer from PSI to hydrogenase could be engineered to occur in vivo in a photosynthetic organism to create an organism that would efficiently produce H-2 from H2O.									28	1	0	0	16	0	29			0021-924X	1756-2651		WOS:000072990600015	9538256

It is also interesting to explore the photocatalytic activity of one-dimensional (1D) CdS nanotubes (CSNTs). In the present study, we have designed atomic models for CSNTs in the 5.2-19.2 A outer diameter range and investigated the basic properties using density functional theory. It is shown that the CSNTs have negative strain energies when the diameter is beyond 6.4 A; this indicates that they can possibly be folded from 2D CdS nanosheets. Moreover, all the CSNTs are direct-energy-gap semiconductors, and their energy gaps monotonically increase as the outer diameter increases. Tunable band gaps provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of nanostructuring on the electronic properties of CSNTs. Due to their perfect band gaps and band energies for photocatalytic activity, CSNTs exhibit potential application in visible light photocatalysis for water splitting. Because of their better photooxidation capabilities and smaller effective masses of holes, CSNTs are more promising photocatalytic materials for the oxygen evolution reaction in Z-scheme systems than monolayer CdS. In addition, the designed CdS nanotube-planar (CSNTP) hetero-dimension junction can be used as a direct Z-scheme photocatalyst. Electron transfer is observed in the interface region, which induces an internal electric field that effectively promotes the separation of charge carriers at the interface and reduces the probability of recombination. This study helps to further understand the advanced strategies to design and improve potentially efficient photocatalysts for the overall water splitting reaction.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000423019600059	29297522	
J	Nishimori, T; Sakamoto, H; Takakuwa, Y; Kono, S								Methane adsorption and hydrogen desorption kinetics during diamond gas source molecular beam epitaxy								DIAMOND FILMS AND TECHNOLOGY				6	5			301	310						1996	1996	Diamond epitaxial films with a thickness of 200-350 Angstrom were grown on C(001) surfaces by gas source molecular beam epitaxy (GSMBE) with pure methane (CH4) and without the addition of hydrogen or oxygen. From Arrhenius plots of the growth rates, the activation energy (E(a)) of the growth was found to be 15 kcal/mol. To clarify the rate-limiting reaction of the diamond epitaxial growth in this GSMBE, the reaction coefficients of CH4 adsorption and H-2 desorption were obtained by measuring the time evolution curves of the surface hydrogen coverage (theta(H)) by electron stimulated desorption of H+ ions. From Arrhenius plots of the reaction coefficients, the E(a)'s of CH4 adsorption and H-2 desorption on C(001) surface were estimated to be 7.3 +/- 1.7 and 21 +/- 4.9 kcal/mol, respectively. E(a) for H-2 desorption is close to E(a) for diamond growth, which suggests that the rate of GSMBE diamond growth is limited by hydrogen desorption. This is further supported by the experimental observation that the growth rate is largely independent of the CH4 pressure. It was also found that theta(H) does not disappear completely but has a large saturation value of similar to 30-60% of initial theta(H), depending on the desorption temperature, which will be discussed in terms of surface segregation of hydrogen from the bulk.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0917-4540			WOS:A1996WH74000005

Herein, we solve a significant remaining challenge with Pt/MMO systems, namely, the relatively low surface area and porosity. This is achieved by dispersing nearly uniform Pt clusters by using atomic layer deposition (ALD) on highly conductive (6.2 S/cm) and stable antimony-doped tin dioxide (ATO) support. ALD-Pt/ATO exhibited a significantly higher electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) (74 m(2)/g) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity (102 mA/mg(p)(t), at 0.9 V vs RHE) compared to Pt/ATO synthesized by using ethylene glycol (ECSA = 31 m(2)/g(pt,) mass activity = 52 mA/mg(pt) at 0.9 V vs RHE) and formic acid reduction methods (ECSA = 28 m(2)/g(pt), mass activity = 46 mA/mg(pt), at 0.9 V vs RHE). Further characterization showed that wet chemical methods resulted in poorer Pt particle dispersion, poor control over Pt particle size distribution, and chemical degradation of the support (during Pt deposition). Given the near-ideal Pt particle size distribution of the ALD-Pt/ATO, particle size growth and loss of ECSA was found to be minimal over the course of rigorous potential cycling. Thus, after 10000 potential cycles between 1 and 1.5 V vs RHE, ALD-Pt/ATO and other Pt/ATOs were found to retain 100% of their initial ECSA compared to 57.6% retention for Pt/C. Upon testing in a H-2/air PEMFC, following 1000 potential cycles, the change in ALD-Pt/ATO performance was negligible while Pt/C exhibited a 68.2% loss of initial peak power density. Thus, ALD-Pt/ATO is an active and highly durable ORR electrocatalyst in PEMFCs under start-up-shut-down conditions.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			2574-0962			WOS:000543715100075

As synthesized, the nanotubes are nanoparticulate aggregates composed of Pt crystallites approximately 3 nm in diameter and with a range of lengths from 1 mu m to 20 mu m. Annealing treatments result in crystallite growth and morphological evolution of the tubular nanostructures including the development of nanoscale porosity. In rotating disk electrode measurements carried out in 0.1MHClO(4), porous PtNTs annealed at 500 degrees C exhibited a specific activity for oxygen reduction of 2390 +/- 423 mu A/cm(Pt)(2) at 0.9 V, comparable to bulk polycrystalline Pt. The electrochemical surface area of the annealed structures was a relatively low 10 m(2)/g, resulting in a moderate overall mass activity of 240 +/- 41 mA/mg(Pt).

Scope and Mechanistic Observations								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				137	48			15234	15240		10.1021/jacs.5b09939				DEC 9 2015	2015	Using abundant soft oxidants, a high methane-to-ethylene conversion might be achievable due to the low thermodynamic driving force for over-oxidation. Here we report on the oxidative coupling of methane by gaseous S-2 (SOCM). The catalytic properties of Pd/Fe3O4 are compared with those of Fe3O4, and it is found that high ethylene selectivities can be achieved without noble metals; conversion and selectivity on Fe3O4 are stable for at least 48 h at SOCM conditions. SOCM data for 10 oxides are compared, and ethylene selectivities as high as 33% are found; the C2H4/C2H6 ratios of 9-12 observed at the highest S-2 conversions are significantly higher than the C2H4/C2H6 ratios usually found in the CH4 coupling with O-2. Complementary in-detail analytical studies show that, on Mg, Zr, Sm, W, and La catalysts, which strongly coke during the reaction, lower ethylene selectivities are observed than on Fe, Ti, and Cr catalysts, which only coke to a minor extent. Further catalyst-dependent changes during SOCM in surface area, surface composition, and partial conversion to oxysulfides and sulfides are discussed. Evidence concerning the reaction mechanism is obtained taking into account the selectivity for the different reaction products versus the contact time. CH4 coupling proceeds non-oxidatively with the evolution of H-2 on some catalysts, and evidence is presented that C2H4 and C2H2 formation occur via C2H6 and C2H4 dehydrogenation, respectively.									23	1	0	0	1	0	24			0002-7863			WOS:000366339900026	26551955

The micro-structural evolution of the multi-layers oxide on the alloys was investigated and the effect of Nb on the oxidation characteristics of NiTiNb alloys was evaluated. It is shown that the addition of Nb can remarkably improve the oxidation resistance of NiTiNb alloys at high temperature. Further, the corresponding mechanism for the improvement of the oxidation resistance by Nb addition has been probed. Nb-rich oxide layer formed can effectively impede interdiffusion of oxygen and metallic cations during oxidation process, leading to a remarkable improvement of oxidation resistance of NiTiNb alloys at high temperature.

A Combined Experimental and Computational Study								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				116	35			10665	10675		10.1021/jp303678n				SEP 6 2012	2012	The origins of C-H activation in pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) Schiff bases and modulation of reaction specificity in PLP enzymes are still not completely understood. There are no available studies that compare the reactivity of C4' carbons in ketimine Schiff bases with that of C alpha carbons in their aldimine counterparts, which is essential to unravel the mechanisms that govern the evolution of their common carbanionic intermediates. Second-order rate constants for phosphate-catalyzed proton/deuterium exchange reactions in D2O of C4' carbons suffer a 10(5)-fold increase due to Schiff base formation (k(B) = 5.3 x 10(1) M-1 s(-1)) according to NMR measurements. The C4' carbon acidity is also increased to pK(a) = 9.8, which is significantly higher than that of C alpha in PLP-aldimines. DFT calculations reveal the role of each heteroatom in modulating the electrophilicity of C4' and C alpha carbons. Specifically, the protonation state of pyridine nitrogen is the main factor in determining the absolute carbon acidity in aldimines (pK(a) of C alpha varies from similar to 14 to similar to 23) and ketimines (pK(a) of C4' varies from similar to 12 to similar to 18), whereas the protonation state of both imine nitrogen and O3' phenol oxygen modulates the relative acidities of C alpha and C4' from 1.5 to 7.5 pK(a) units. Our results provide an explanation to the modulation of reaction specificity observed in different PLP-enzymes based on the differences in the protonation state of the cofactor Wand H-bonding patterns in the active site.									29	0	0	0	13	0	29			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000308339400027	22845654

In addition, we show that the sizes and distributions of NaO2 can be highly dependent on the discharge rate, and we discuss the formation mechanisms responsible for this rate dependence.

We assume that the region of interest consists solely of gaseous free carbon and oxygen atoms and that the buildup of CO is counteracted by the radioactive decay of Co-56, which breaks up the CO molecule and allows C to condense into solids. Our chemical model takes C to first form linear chains, which, at some critical length, transition into ringed isomers. These isomers are more resistant to oxidation than linear chains. These ringed isomers form the nuclei for the growth of larger carbon solids. The effect of the disruption of CO on grain growth is displayed, leading to a rethinking of previous assumptions on the importance of CO disruption. How the abundance and size distribution of grains are affected by various parameters of the ejecta is also studied, providing insight into the possible sites of grain condensation.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000235132100022

Herein, we elaborately design a facile enzyme-assisted synthetic strategy that enables to tailor the ZIFs precursors into structural stable decus-sation shape, which derived Co nanoislands grafted on decussate N-doped carbon nanoleaves (D-Co@NC) can well retain the interpenetrating nanostructure. Benefiting from the combined advantages of compositions and interpenetrating nanostructures, D-Co@NC possesses 5.2 times higher exposed electrochemical active area than the conventional dodecahedral one, thus endowing the superior bifunctional activity toward ORR and OER with a low potential gap (& UDelta;E) of 0.866 V. When applicated in Zn-air battery, the D-Co@NC electrode displays a high peak power density of 115.4 mW cm(-2) and energy density of 879.6 Wh kg(-1) as well as excellent long-cycling stability more than 200 h, outperforming benchmark catalysts of Pt/C||RuO2.

However, the oxidation mechanisms and products of histidine differ dramatically in these related environments which range from the gas phase through aerosols to aqueous solution. Herein we report a parallel gas- and solution-phase study on the O-1(2) oxidation of histidine, aimed at evaluating the evolution of histidine oxidation pathways in different media and at different ionization states. We first investigated the oxidation of protonated and deprotonated histidine ions and the same systems hydrated with explicit water molecules in the gas phase, using guided-ion-beam-scattering mass spectrometry. Reaction coordinates and potential energy surfaces for these systems were established on the basis of density functional theory calculations, Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus modeling and direct dynamics simulations. Subsequently we tracked the oxidation process of histidine in aqueous solution under different pH conditions, using on-line UV-Vis spectroscopy and electrospray mass spectrometry monitoring systems. The results show that two different routes contribute to the oxidation of histidine depending on its ionization states. In each mechanism hydration is essential to suppressing the otherwise predominant dissociation of reaction intermediates back to reactants. The oxidation of deprotonated histidine in the gas phase involves the formation of 2,4-endoperoxide and 2-hydroperoxide of imidazole. These intermediates evolve to hydrated imidazolone in solution, and the latter either undergoes ring-closure to 6 alpha-hydoxy-2-oxo-octahydro-pyrrolo[2,3-d]midazole-5-carboxylate or cross-links with another histidine to form a dimeric product. In contrast, the oxidation of protonated histidine is mediated by 2,5-endoperoxide and 5-hydroperoxide, which convert to stable hydrated imidazolone end-product in solution. The contrasting mechanisms and reaction efficiencies of protonated vs. deprotonated histidine, which lead to pH dependence in the photooxidation of histidine, are interpreted in terms of the chemistry of imidazole with O-1(2). The biological implications of the results are also discussed.									21	0	0	0	10	0	22			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000343072800030	25213401

Here, the authors show that such materials can intrinsically generate remarkably long-lived reactive charges, enabling them to efficiently drive hydrogen evolution.Organic semiconductor photocatalysts for the production of solar fuels are attractive as they can be synthetically tuned to absorb visible light while simultaneously retaining suitable energy levels to drive a range of processes. However, a greater understanding of the photophysics that determines the function of organic semiconductor heterojunction nanoparticles is needed to optimize performance. Here, we show that such materials can intrinsically generate remarkably long-lived reactive charges, enabling them to efficiently drive sacrificial hydrogen evolution. Our optimized hetereojunction photocatalysts comprise the conjugated polymer PM6 matched with Y6 or PCBM electron acceptors, and achieve external quantum efficiencies of 1.0% to 5.0% at 400 to 900 nm and 8.7% to 2.6% at 400 to 700 nm, respectively. Employing transient and operando spectroscopies, we find that the heterojunction structure in these nanoparticles greatly enhances the generation of long-lived charges (millisecond to second timescale) even in the absence of electron/hole scavengers or Pt. Such long-lived reactive charges open potential applications in water-splitting Z-schemes and in driving kinetically slow and technologically desirable oxidations.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			2058-7546			WOS:000768620500001

The synthesis and formation mechanism of 3D porous NC nanosheet array assembled into a honeycomb layer with ultrafine CoP/Co2P single-crystal nanorods encapsulated is systematically presented. The CoP/Co2P@NC/Ti electrode exhibits low overpotentials (eta(10)) of 31, 49, and 64 mV at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1.0 KOH, and 1.0 M PBS, respectively, exceeding the overwhelming majority of the documented transition metal phosphide-based electrocatalysts. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the superior electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction could be ascribed to the strong coupling effects of the reactive facets of CoP and Co2P with the 3D porous NC nanosheet, making it exhibit a more thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption free energy.									21	2	0	0	0	0	22				2589-0042		WOS:000553829700002	32599558	
J	Deng, Puhui; Li, Haiyan; Wang, Zidong; Hou, Yu								Enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by carbon-doped carbon nitride synthesized via the assistance of cellulose								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				504						144454	10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.144454				FEB 28 2020	2020	Photocatalytic splitting of water is a promising way to realize the conversion of solar energy to hydrogen. In this work, carbon-doped graphitic carbon nitride (CGCN) materials with enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production performance under visible-light irradiation was obtained. The activity is about 17 times higher than the bulk g-CN. The enhanced hydrogen evolution performance of CGCN is due to the replacement of N with C in g-CN, which leads to a higher charge separation efficiency and better light absorption capability. This study proves that regulating the ratio of carbon to nitrogen in g-CN could optimize its electronic and optical properties, further improving the photocatalytic activity.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000502040600094

In this paper, the in situ process test combining pyrolysis and combustion of Pingshuo coal was carried out using a thermogravimetric analyzer and a fluidized-bed reactor. The influence of pyrolysis conditions on the combustion behavior and char structure was studied. The reduction of the pyrolysis temperature and the increase in pyrolysis residence time resulted in a lower burnout temperature of char, thereby improving the combustion characteristics of char. Furthermore, the maximum CO2 release rate reached 2.8 mg/(g center dot s) during the combustion process. The decrease in the pyrolysis temperature was conducive to the increase of CO2 release mass, suggesting a more complete burning of char. The char combustion process was mainly controlled by the chemical reaction according to the reaction kinetics study. The apparent rate constant of the combustion process increased gradually with the decrease in the pyrolysis temperature of char, and the rate of the combustion reaction increased, which contributed to the enhancement of the combustion performance of the char within the range of 850-950 degrees C. Meanwhile, the crystal structure inside the char changed significantly after different pyrolysis conditions. However, it had little influence on the molar content of carbon structure, which suggested that the amount of CO2 released was mainly caused by the different resistances of oxygen diffusion to the reaction interface.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1343			WOS:000823008200001	35847288

To identify the importance of preparation parameters and screen the optimal ones with a relatively small number of experimental runs, an orthogonal experiment design was used in this work. The four parameters were the mole ratio of citrate to cations (CA/Me, factor A = 1, 2, and 3), the gelation temperature (factor B = 60, 80, and 100 degrees C), the cation concentration (factor C = 0.98, 0.49, and 0.33 mol/L), and the calcination temperature (factor D = 800, 1000, and 1200 degrees C). Regarding the specific surface area (SSA), the order of importance of the four factors is calcination temperature > CA/Me > gelation temperature > cation concentration. The sample prepared at a combination of A3B1C3D2 (3-60 degrees C-0.33 mol/L-1000 degrees C) has the largest SSA (28.25 m(2)/g), and high CA/Me ratios and low gelation temperatures result in big and porous particles. For nine nanocomposites, complete oxidation of methane occurs first, followed by partial oxidation of methane and then methane cracking at 950 degrees C and 1 atm in the reduction step of chemical-looping steam methane reforming. The first two reactions proceed until the lattice oxygen is depleted, but the last one takes place before the oxidation reactions are completed. As the redox cycle number increases, the first and last two reactions become insignificant. No combination can produce an oxygen carrier that exhibits high selectivity toward partial oxidation but low selectivity toward complete oxidation and methane cracking. Regarding methane conversion, syngas selectivity, and coke selectivity, the best combinations of CA/Me, gelation temperature, cation concentration, and calcination temperature are A2B1C1D1 (2-60 degrees C-0.98 mol/L-800 degrees C), A1B2C3D3 (1-80 degrees C-0.33 mol/L-1200 degrees C), and A3B3C2D3 (3-100 degrees C-0.49 mol/L-1200 degrees C), respectively. Concerning hydrogen purity in the oxidation step, the best combination is A3B3B3D3 (3-100 degrees C-0.33 mol/L-1200 degrees C).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000716453500060		
J	BADER, KP; HOPER, S								STIMULATORY EFFECTS OF AN AMMONIUM SALT BIOCIDE ON PHOTOSYNTHETIC ELECTRON-TRANSPORT REACTIONS								ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATURFORSCHUNG C-A JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES				49	1-2			87	94						JAN-FEB 1994	1994	Alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride (ABDAC, zephirol) has been shown to improve the functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus of the filamentous cyanobacterium Oscillatoria chalybea (Bader, K. P. (1989) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 975, 399-402). This biocide exerts stimulatory effects on various electron transport reactions in Oscillatoria chalybea and chloroplasts from higher plants. By means of oxygen evolution measurements and of repetitive flash-induced absorption spectroscopy we were able to demonstrate an impact of the drug on the major complexes of photosynthetic membranes, i.e. the water splitting complex, photosystem II and photosystem I. Both, P-820- and X(320)-absorption change signals were enhanced by the addition of ABDAC. Along with the quantitative analysis we investigated the relaxation kinetics of the signals and observed a substantial stabilization of the oxidized states of the respective redox components in the presence of the ammonium salt. Under appropriate conditions the relaxation kinetics of the absorption signals were significantly slowed down. ABDAC also affects photosystem I in Oscillatoria chalybea, but only under conditions, where a donor/acceptor system i.e. an isolated photosystem I reaction with photosystem II being disconnected was measured. Electron transport through the whole chain i.e. with water as the electron donor yielded no effect of the quaternary ammonium salt. It is suggested that this is due to an extremely bad linkage between the two photosystem, each of which, however, shows good reaction rates, when separately measured. The described interactions of the biocide with photosynthetic membranes are not restricted to Oscillatoria chalybea but are also observed with higher plant chloroplasts. In these systems, ABDAC enhances X(320)- and P-700-signals to a comparable extent. In this case the P-700-signal is stimulated in assays with electrons which are furnished from water which hints at good coupling between the two photosystems in our tobacco chloroplast preparations.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			0939-5075			WOS:A1994MY47800014

In this study, we tentatively examined the molecular composition and evolution of a WSOC mixture extracted from field-collected wheat straw burning aerosol (WSBA) samples upon photolysis, using direct infusion electrospray ionisation (ESI) coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with HRMS. For comparison, two typical phenolic compounds (i.e. phenol and guaiacol) emitted from lignin pyrolysis in combination with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a typical OH radical precursor were simultaneously exposed to simulated sunlight irradiation. Their photochemical products such as phenolic dimers (e.g. m/z 185.0608 for phenol dimer and m/z 245.0823 for guaiacol dimer) or their isomers, were also observed in field-collected WSBA samples, suggesting that the aqueous-phase reactions might contribute to the formation of emitted biomass burning aerosols. The aqueous photochemistry of both the phenols (photooxidation) and WSBA extracts (direct photolysis) could produce a series of highly oxygenated compounds, which in turn increases the oxidation degree of organic composition and acidity of the bulk solution. In particular, the LC/ESI-HRMS technique revealed significant photochemical evolution of the WSOC composition in WSBA samples, e.g. the photodegradation of low oxygenated species and the formation of highly oxygenated products. We also tentatively compared the mass spectra of photolytic time-profile WSBA extracts with each other for a more comprehensive description of the photolytic evolution. The calculated average oxygen-to-carbon ratio (O/C) of oxygenated compounds in bulk extract increases from 0.38 +/- 0.02 to 0.44 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- standard deviation), while the intensity (S/N)-weighted average O/C (O/C-w) increases from 0.45 +/- 0.03 to 0.53 +/- 0.06 as the time of irradiation extends from 0 to 12 h. These findings indicate that the water-soluble organic fraction of combustion-derived aerosols has the potential to form more oxidised organic matter, contributing to the highly oxygenated nature of atmospheric organic aerosols.									9	0	0	0	5	0	9			1680-7316	1680-7324		WOS:000537577300002

In spite of the well-known high reactivity of rare earth oxides towards silicon, films characterized by good morphological properties have been obtained by using a SiO2 interlayer between the film and the silicon substrate. The evolution of the properties of the Er2O3 films due to thermal annealing processes in oxygen ambient performed at temperatures in the range of 800-1200 degrees C has been investigated in detail. The existence of well defined annealing conditions (rapid treatments at a temperature of 1100 degrees C or higher) allowing to avoid the occurrence of extensive chemical reactions with the oxidized substrate has been demonstrated; under these conditions, the thermal process has a beneficial effect on both structural and optical properties of the film, and an increase of the photoluminescence (PL) intensity by about a factor of 40 with respect to the as-deposited material has been observed. The enhanced efficiency of the photon emission process has been correlated with the longer lifetime of the PL signal. Finally, the conditions leading to a reaction of Er2O3 with the substrate have been also identified, and evidences about the formation of silicate-like phases have been collected.

Besides the dopants, porosity, or ion-penetration of the cocatalyst, the crystallinity of the cocatalyst may also influence the charge reactions at the interface. Herein, we prepared amorphous LaNiOx and crystalline La-doped NiO (c-LaNiOx) cocatalysts through photochemical decomposition and ion-exchange of Ni(OH)(2) precipitation, respectively. Both lanthanum nickel oxides (LaNiOx) showed considerable improvement of hematite photoanodes. By using electrochemical impedance measurements, we confirmed that the catalyst could store photogenerated charges with reduced transfer resistance and passivate the surface state, resulting in the overall charge transfer rate enhancement. This study may lead to a chance to uncover the kinetic bottleneck with an efficient cocatalyst in well-controlled crystallinity in the future.

In this study we induce oxygen starvation in a manner closer to failure in real systems than commonly applied accelerated stress tests. By cycling the cathode gas flow, two accelerated stress tests were introduced; simulating short periods of air starvation with duration of either 10 or 60 seconds. Short cathode undersupply does not lead to fuel cell failure. Air starvation results in a voltage drop and hydrogen evolution. This is accompanied by the reduction of platinum oxides in the respective areas, which leads to an improvement of the active catalyst surface area. After extensive cycling, degradation becomes the dominant effect. X-ray computed tomography is used to visualize the change of the catalyst particle size and distribution in dependence on the location in the fuel cell. Throughout the experiments, a total voltage decay rate of 1.427mVh(-1), a total fluoride emission rate of 0.0031 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2) and severe current and temperature gradients during starvation were observed, leading to an inhomogeneous agglomeration of the platinum electrocatalyst.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1615-6846	1615-6854		WOS:000395007000003

The results indicated that S. sclerotiorum infection increased the content of H_2O_2, enhanced the peroxidation of membrane lipid, suppressed the rate of O_2 evolution and changed the shape of chlorophyll fluorescence transient significantly. The donor (Oxygen evolution complex) and acceptor sides as well as the reaction centers of PS II were damaged severely by the infection of 5. sclerotiorum. The maximal oxidation-reduction activity of PS I ( DeltaI/Io) was also declined by the infection. According to the results, the inhibition of CAT activity and the accumulation of H_2O_2 damaged the function of PS I and PS II. The damage of PS I inhibited the electron transporting from PS II to PS I , which accelerated the damage of PS H leading to an increase of excessive excitation energy. This vicious circle was the main reason of inhibition of photosynthesis in cucumber leaves caused by 5. sclerotiorum infection.			以津春四号黄瓜(Cucumis sativus L.'Jinchun 4')为实验材料,通过同时测定黄瓜叶片叶绿素荧光快速诱导动力学曲线和对820 nm光的吸收曲线,以及过氧化氢含量和过氧化氢酶(CAT)活性的变化,研究了核盘菌(Sclerotinia sclerotiorum(Lib.)de Bary)侵染黄瓜叶片后,对光系统I(PSⅠ)和光系统Ⅱ(PSⅡ)功能的影响,并分析了核盘菌侵染后,两个光系统之间的相互影响.结果表明,核盘菌侵染叶片后,叶片过氧化氢(H_2O_2)含量升高,膜脂过氧化的程度加剧,叶片放氧能力下降,快速叶绿素荧光诱导动力学曲线发生变化.核盘菌侵染严重伤害了PSⅡ供体侧(放氧复合体)、受体侧以及反应中心的活性,并且降低PS I最大氧化还原能力(△I/Io).核盘菌侵染黄瓜后,抑制了CAT的活性,导致过量活性氧的积累,直接伤害了光合机构PS I和PSⅡ的功能;对PS I的伤害抑制了PSⅡ电子向Ps I的传递,进一步加剧了PSⅡ的伤害程度,导致更多过剩激发能产生,造成恶性循环,这是核盘菌抑制黄瓜光合作用的主要原因.						7	13	0	0	8	0	20			0412-0914			CSCD:3780122

In BiVO4 photoanodes, the eta(trans) has been greatly enhanced by integrating various low-price oxygen evolution electrocatalysts but improving eta(abs) x eta(sep) efficiency remains a great challenge. Considering this challenge, here, we fabricate inverse opal (IO)SnO2@BiVO4 type-II heterojunction photoanodes and investigate the nabs x n sep efficiency by tailoring the amount of BiVO4 on the IO-SnO2 nanostructures. The optimized IO-SnO2@BiVO4 photoanode exhibits eta(abs) x eta(sep) of 62.91 % at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is much higher than that of the bare BiVO4 (16.14 %). The significantly improved eta(abs) x eta(sep) is attributed to the introduction of IO-SnO2, which provides a high solar light-harvesting capability by diffuse scattering and coherent multiple internal scattering. Moreover, it greatly improves the intrinsic charge transport and reduces interface contact resistance due to ordered paths for electron migration. Even though eta(abs) x eta(sep) is high, the majority of the photogenerated holes are lost at the surface/electrolyte recombination, resulting in a very low eta(trans) of 24.93 % at 1.23 V vs. RHE. To improve the eta(tr)(ans) performance, an oxygen evolution catalyst is deposited on the surface of optimized IO-SnO2@BiVO4, and it greatly increases the eta(abs) (96.29 %) and achieves J(H2O) of 3.57 mA.cm(-2) with excellent stability for 10 h. In addition, we achieve an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of nearly 1.02 % at 0.72 V vs. RHE. Overall, the obtained results and fabrication process are considered a significant step toward achieving sustainability.									18	1	0	0	0	0	19			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000532683200020

In this work, the mechanism for oxygen and hydrogen production by photo water splitting using Mn-oxo complex/tungsten oxide heteronanostructures was examined under different experimental conditions by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as well as gas chromatographic analysis, O-18 isotope measurements, and pH dependence of photocurrent. We found that the Mn(II) species plays an important role in the catalytic cycle of water oxidation in the Mn-oxo oligomer complex/tungsten oxide system and propose a working model of the Mn-oxo oligomer complex/tungsten oxide catalytic system in photo water splitting.

This ion must be present at high concentration in the electrolyte. In aqueous fuel cells operating on hydrogen and oxygen, the only useful electrolytes have high concentrations of either H+ or OH-, i.e., strong acids or bases. The product of the anode reaction in aqueous acids, H+, occurs as a 'carrier ion' complexed by H2O as H(H2O)n+, where n lies between 1 and 4. The corresponding cathodic product ion in bases, OH-, is itself a 'carrier ion', the reaction product of O2-(from the reduction of O2) and H2O. Phosphoric acid is not an aqueous acid, but a unique self-ionizing amphoteric system, in effect a molten acidic (H+) salt. In molten salts, H+ could be the primary conductor, e.g., in molten bisulfates. Less corrosive carbonate melts use a cathodic supply of CO2 supplied via the gas phase to give CO22- as the O2- 'carrier ion'. A similar approach may be used in aqueous carbonates. No carrier material is needed in solid oxides, which conduct directly via O2- ion. The temperature windows for different electrolytes are limited by performance at the low end and materials considerations at the high end. As a result, there are no electrolytes capable of operation between 480 and 900 K, and between 1050 and 1220 K. Development of electrolytes for these temperature ranges would be valuable.					3rd Grove Fuel Cell Symposium: The Science, Engineering and Practice of Fuel Cells3rd Grove Fuel Cell Symposium: The Science, Engineering and Practice of Fuel Cells	SEP 28-OCT 01, 1993SEP 28-OCT 01, 1993	ELSEVIER SCI LTDELSEVIER SCI LTD	IMPERIAL COLL, LONDON, ENGLANDIMPERIAL COLL, LONDON, ENGLAND	34	2	0	0	0	0	34			0378-7753			WOS:A1994NP06100003

Pt-free and Fe-free cathode catalysts therefore are urgently needed for durable and inexpensive proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Herein, a high-performance nitrogen-coordinated single Co atom catalyst is derived from Co-doped metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) through a one-step thermal activation. Aberration-corrected electron microscopy combined with X-ray absorption spectroscopy virtually verifies the CoN4 coordination at an atomic level in the catalysts. Through investigating effects of Co doping contents and thermal activation temperature, an atomically Co site dispersed catalyst with optimal chemical and structural properties has achieved respectable activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in challenging acidic media (e.g., half-wave potential of 0.80 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The performance is comparable to Fe-based catalysts and 60 mV lower than Pt/C -60 mu g Pt cm(-2)). Fuel cell tests confirm that catalyst activity and stability can translate to high-performance cathodes in PEMFCs. The remarkably enhanced ORR performance is attributed to the presence of well-dispersed CoN4 active sites embedded in 3D porous MOF-derived carbon particles, omitting any inactive Co aggregates.									693	67	1	0	31	0	707			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000427111300028	29363838

Metal-organic gels (MOGs) have recently emerged as promising nonprecious electrocatalysts for the OER, which have the advantages of high surface areas, hierarchical porosity, good compatibility, and open metal active sites for electrocatalysis. Herein, multimetallic metal-organic aerogel electrocatalysts (MG-FeNiCo) are assembled from 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid and Fe3+, Co2+, and Ni2+ nitrates via a facile one-pot method. In this way, multiple metal ions react with 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid to yield a multimetallic metal-organic gel. The multimetal-organic gel is a self-sorting system rather than a co-assembled one, exhibiting mixed nanoparticle and tape morphology. The bimetallic and multimetallic metal-organic gels exhibit a partially amorphous structure together with regular nanoscale metal-organic framework phases. It is noted that the MG-FeNiCo aerogel shows thermoreversible stimulus-response and a low density of 52.8 mg cm(-3), and can support about 770 times its weight. MG-FeNiCo exhibits excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 248 mV and 272 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively, and a small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1). Chronopotentiometry experiments revealed that MG-FeNiCo can retain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for 48 h with only a similar to 2.1% increase, indicating the excellent activity and stability of MG-FeNiCo in the OER. The excellent performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of multiple metal ions to obtain more abundant active sites, and there is more electron movement in the oxidation and reduction state transformation of multiple metal ions (Fe3+/Fe2+ and Ni3+/Ni2+). Additionally, a conductive substance (graphene oxide) was doped into the gel network to form MG-FeNiCo-xGO aerogels. MG-FeNiCo-xGO aerogels show improved OER performance and good stability and durability. This strategy provides a simple and efficient method to explore multimetallic electrocatalysts.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000681776600001

The optimal concentration of Fe3+ for the modification of the TiO2 nanocrystals was determined by UV-Vis spectroscopy. A cobalt-phosphate (CoPi) water oxidation catalyst was electrochemically deposited onto the FeO(OH)TiO2 photoanodes. The resulting FeO(OH)-TiO2/CoPi composite photoanodes were systematically characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the photoelectrochemical water oxidation properties of the FeO(OH)-TiO2/CoPi composite photoanodes were investigated in neutral conditions by electrochemical and photoelectrochemical methods. The results indicated that the TiO2 particles were pure anatase nanocrystals, and the FeO(OH) phase on the TiO2 surfaces was goethite. The optimal light absorption properties of the FeO(OH)-TiO2 photoanodes were achieved when the photoanodes were prepared in the precursor solution with a Fe:TiO2 mass ratio of 0.05%. The overpotential for oxygen evolution on the FeO(OH)-TiO2/CoPi composite photoanodes under illumination decreased significantly compared with that obtained on the CoPi catalyst. The high oxygen evolution activity of the composite photoanodes can be attributed to modification of FeO(OH) on TiO2 nanocrystal surfaces changing the light absorption band from the ultraviolet to the visible region and CoPi inhibited hole-electron recombination through facilitating the photon-induced hole transfer for water oxidation.									1	2	0	0	0	0	2			1000-6818			WOS:000310181300007

Through coaxial electrospinning, the metal nanoparticles were evenly distributed on the CNF surfaces, and the samples were directly applied as LOB cathodes. Although the Co and Pd nanoparticles did not promote the desired Li-O-2 reactions, the CNF@Pt exhibited much improved electrochemical performance with highly reversible Li-O-2 operations. Therefore, the Li-O-2 cell using the CNF@Pt cathode exhibited significantly enhanced specific capacity, rate capability, energy efficiency, and cycle stability compared to the other samples. The observed formation of Li2O2 film, rather than toroidal particles, on the CNF@Pt after an early stage of discharge may be attributed to greatly reduced overpotentials both on discharge and charge, as well as a considerably prolonged cycle life (163 cycles) with a limiting capacity of 1000 mAh/gc at a current density of 500 mA/gc. In particular, in-situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry studies revealed that the cycles of the Pt-catalyzed Li-O-2 cell were mainly based on the reversible formation/ decomposition of Li2O2, as evidenced by high O-2 evolution and negligible CO2 evolution, even after long-term cycles.

Under these explosive conditions, the reaction rate is dominated by contributions from a narrow resonance at E-c.m. = 183 keV and by the combined contributions of direct capture and low-energy tails of broad resonances. At present, the astrophysical reaction rate is not well constrained because of the lack of data in the energy region appropriate to classical novae.Purpose: This study aims at the measurement of the O-17( p,gamma)F-18 reaction cross section in order to determine its reaction rate in the temperature region appropriate to explosive hydrogen burning in novae.Method: The O-17( p,gamma)F-18 reaction cross section was measured using both the prompt detection of the emitted gamma rays and an activation technique. Measurements were carried out at the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics ( Gran Sasso, Italy) where the strongly reduced cosmic-ray-induced background allows for improved sensitivity compared to previous studies.Results: The O-17( p,gamma)F-18 reaction cross section was measured in the range E-c.m. = 160 to 370 keV. The strength of the E-c.m. = 183 keV resonance, omega gamma = 1.67 +/- 0.12 mu eV, was determined with unprecedented precision. The total S factor was obtained through a combined fit of prompt gamma-ray and activation results. An overall global fit including other existing data sets was also carried out and a recommended astrophysical reaction rate is presented.Conclusions: The reaction rate uncertainty attained in this work is now below the required precision for nova models. We verified, following a full set of hydrodynamic nova models, that the abundances of oxygen and fluorine isotopes obtained with the present reaction rate are determined with 10% precision and put firmer constraints on observational signatures of novae events.									42	0	0	0	0	0	42			0556-2813	1089-490X		WOS:000332155600006

We have developed for the first time an integrated battery-electrolyser (`battolyser') that efficiently stores electricity as a nickel-iron battery and can split water into hydrogen and oxygen as an alkaline electrolyser. During charge insertion the Ni(OH)(2) and Fe(OH)(2) electrodes form nanostructured NiOOH and reduced Fe, which act as efficient oxygen and hydrogen evolution catalysts respectively. The charged electrodes use all excess electricity for efficient electrolysis, while they can be discharged at any time to provide electricity when needed. Our results demonstrate a remarkable constant and a high overall energy efficiency (80-90%), enhanced electrode storage density, fast current switching capabilities, and a general stable performance. The battolyser may enable efficient and robust short-term electricity storage and long-term electricity storage through production of hydrogen as a fuel and feedstock within a single, scalable, abundant element based device.									42	4	0	0	3	0	44			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000396430700008

Herein, based on high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of transition metal phosphides, a CoP3 nanowire decorated with copper phosphides (denoted as CuPx) nanodots structures synthesized through a simple and easily scalable precursor-transformation strategy is reported as a highly efficient HER catalyst. By decorating with CuPx nanodots, the optimized CoP3 nanowires electrode exhibits excellent catalytic activity and long-term durability for HER in alkaline conditions, achieving a low overpotential of 49.5 mV at a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 58.0 mV dec(-1), while also performing quite well in neutral and acidic media. Moreover, its overall performance exceeds most of the reported state-of-the-art catalysts, especially under high current density of 100 mA cm(-2), demonstrating its potential as a promising versatile pH universal electrocatalyst for efficient water electrolysis. These results indicate that the incorporation of earth-abundant stable element copper can significantly enhance catalytic activity, which widens the application range of copper and provides a new path for design and selection of HER catalysts.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000492740800001	31657107

These hydrogen bond interactions suggest that Tyr(381) and/or Tyr(465) are general acid catalysts that facilitate epoxide ring opening in the first step of the hydrolysis reaction; Tyr(485) is highly conserved among all epoxide hydrolases, and Tyr(381) is conserved among the soluble epoxide hydrolases. In one enzyme-inhibitor complex, the urea carbonyl oxygen additionally interacts with Gln(382). If a comparable interaction occurs in catalysis, then Gln(382) may provide electrostatic stabilization of partial negative charge on the epoxide oxygen. The carboxylate side chain of Asp(333) accepts a hydrogen bond from one of the urea NH groups in each enzyme-inhibitor complex. Because Asp(333) is the catalytic nucleophile, its interaction with the partial positive charge on the urea NH group mimics its approach toward the partial positive charge on the electrophilic carbon of an epoxide substrate. Accordingly, alkylurea inhibitors mimic features encountered in the reaction coordinate of epoxide ring opening, and a structure-based mechanism is proposed for leukotoxin epoxide hydrolysis.									107	3	0	0	77	1	131			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000087128300067	10747889	
J	Sandmann, Gerhard								Carotenoids and Their Biosynthesis in Fungi								MOLECULES				27	4					1431	10.3390/molecules27041431				FEB 2022	2022	Carotenoids represent a class of pigmented terpenoids. They are distributed in all taxonomic groups of fungi. Most of the fungal carotenoids differ in their chemical structures to those from other organisms. The general function of carotenoids in heterotrophic organisms is protection as antioxidants against reactive oxygen species generated by photosensitized reactions. Furthermore, carotenoids are metabolized to apocarotenoids by oxidative cleavage. This review presents the current knowledge on fungal-specific carotenoids, their occurrence in different taxonomic groups, and their biosynthesis and conversion into trisporic acids. The outline of the different pathways was focused on the reactions and genes involved in not only the known pathways, but also suggested the possible mechanisms of reactions, which may occur in several non-characterized pathways in different fungi. Finally, efforts and strategies for genetic engineering to enhance or establish pathways for the production of various carotenoids in carotenogenic or non-carotenogenic yeasts were highlighted, addressing the most-advanced producers of each engineered yeast, which offered the highest biotechnological potentials as production systems.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4				1420-3049		WOS:000764345000001	35209220

The TiHx as an interlayer was produced by electrochemical cathodic reduction of a coated layer of the TiOx on the titanium substrate. Spin coating and thermal decomposition were used to deposit the Sn-Sb-Ni precursor on the surface of the prepared Ti/TiHx electrode. Cyclic and linear scanning voltammetry, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to reveal the electrode performance and morphology. Results show that the onset potential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of Ti/TiHx /NATO is higher than for Ti/NATO. They also indicate that the service lifetime of the Ti/TiHx/NATO is twice as long as the Ti/NATO at a current density of 50 mA.cm(-2) at room temperature. Electrochemical ozone generation and degradation of the methylene blue were investigated to confirm selectivity and activity of the electrodes. After 5 min electrolysis, a current efficiency for ozone generation of 56% was obtained the electrode with TiHx while 38% was obtained on Ti/NATO under same conditions. The results also confirm that the Ti/TiH x /NATO has a higher kinetic rate constant and decolorization efficiency for removal of the methylene blue compare to the Ti/NATO. The rate constant for the pseudo-first ordered reaction of methylene blue degradation showed high values of 350 x 10(-3) min(-1) for Ti/NATO and 440 x 10(-3) min(-1) for Ti/TiHx/NATO.

Iron-dependent oxygenases exploit this earth-abundant transition metal for the insertion of oxygen atoms into organic compounds. Throughout the astounding diversity of transformations catalyzed by these enzymes, the protein framework directs reactive intermediates toward the precise formation of products, which, in many cases, necessitates the cleavage of strong C-H bonds. In recent years, members of several iron-dependent oxygenase families have been engineered for new-to-nature transformations that offer advantages over conventional synthetic methods. In this Perspective, we first explore what is known about the reactivity of heme-dependent cytochrome P450 oxygenases and nonheme iron-dependent oxygenases bearing the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad by reviewing mechanistic studies with an emphasis on how the protein scaffold maximizes the catalytic potential of the iron-heme and iron cofactors. We then review how these cofactors have been repurposed for abiological transformations by engineering the protein frameworks of these enzymes. Finally, we discuss contemporary challenges associated with engineering these platforms and comment on their roles in biocatalysis moving forward.									26	0	0	0	8	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200049	33282461	
J	Miller-Oana, Melia; Corral, Erica L.								High-Temperature Isothermal Oxidation of Ultra-High Temperature Ceramics Using Thermal Gravimetric Analysis								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY				99	2			619	626		10.1111/jace.14001				FEB 2016	2016	Oxidation of ZrB2 + SiC composites is investigated using isothermal measurements to study the effects of temperature, time, and gas flow on oxidation behavior and microstructural evolution. A test method called dynamic nonequilibrium thermal gravimetric analysis (DNE-TGA), which eliminates oxidation during the heating ramp, has been developed to monitor mass change from the onset of an isothermal hold period (15 min) as a function temperature (1000 degrees C-1600 degrees C) and gas flow (50 and 200 mL/min). In comparing isothermal to nonisothermal TGA measurements, the scale thicknesses from isothermal tests are up to 4 times greater, indicating that oxidation kinetics are faster for isothermal testing, where the oxide scale thickness is 110 m after 15 min at 1600 degrees C in air. Isothermal oxidation followed parabolic kinetics with a mass gain that is temperature dependent from 1000 degrees C-1600 degrees C. The mass gain increased from similar to 5 to 45 g/m(2) and parabolic rate constants increased from 0.037 to 2.2 g(2)/m(4<bold>)s over this temperature range</bold>. The effect of flow velocity on oxidation is not significant under the given laminar flow environment where the gas boundary layer is calculated to be 4 mm. These values are consistent with diffusion of oxygen through the glass-ceramic surface layer as rate limiting.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000369836600035

Herein, a highly HER-active graphene-supported Co-N-C SAC is reported with unique design features in the morphology of the substrate and the microenvironment of the single metal sites: i) the crumpled and scrolled morphology of the graphene substrate circumvents the issues encountered by stacked nanoplatelets, resulting in improved exposure of the electrode/electrolyte interfaces (approximate to 10 times enhancement); ii) the in-plane holes in graphene preferentially orientate the Co atoms at the edge sites with low-coordinated Co-N-3 configuration that exhibits enhanced intrinsic activity (approximate to 2.6 times enhancement compared to the conventional Co-N-4 moiety), as evidenced by detailed experiments and density functional theory calculations. As a result, this catalyst exhibits significantly improved HER activity with an overpotential (eta) of merely 82 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 59.0 mV dec(-1) and a turnover frequency of 0.81 s(-1) at eta = 100 mV, ranking it among the best Co-N-C SACs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000778952200001	35388966

The IrOx center dot nH(2)O film was prepared by the application of repetitive cyclic voltammetry and it was characterized by the charge of the broad voltammetric peak at 0.97 V. It was observed for charges lower than 720 mu C cm(-2) a slight increase of both, the H-UPD electroadsorption and the steady state limiting current of hydrogen oxidation, with respect to Ir metal. For higher oxide charge values, both variables decrease while a small anodic peak appears at 0.65 V. This behaviour was explained on the basis of the formation of two types of Ir oxide depending on the film thickness and the water concentration profile, which changes the site where the hydrogen reaction takes place.

J	Kim, HK; Seong, TY; Cho, WI; Yoon, YS								Rapid thermal annealing effect on surface of LiNi1-xCoxO2 cathode film for thin-film microbattery								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				109	1			178	183	PII S0378-7753(02)00046-0	10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00046-0				JUN 15 2002	2002	The effect of rapid thermal annealing (RTA) on the surface of a LiNi1-xCoxO2 cathode film is examined by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and auger electron spectroscopy (AES). It is found that the as-deposited LiNi1-xCoxO2 film undergoes a surface reaction with oxygen in the air, due to the high activity of lithium in the film. AES spectra indicate that the surface layer consists of lithium and oxygen atoms. The RTA process at 500 degreesC eliminates the surface layer to some extent. An increase in annealing temperature to 700 degreesC results in complete elimination of the surface layer. The surface evolution of the LiNi1-xCoxO2 film with increasing annealing time at 700 C is examined by means of AFM examination. It is found that the surface layer, which is initially present in the form of an amorphous like-film, becomes agglomerated and then vaporizes after 5 min of annealing. A thin-film microbattery (TFB), fabricated by using the LiNi1-xCoxO2 film without a surface layer, exhibits more stable cycliability and a higher specific discharge capacity of 60.2 muAh cm(-2) muM than a TFB with an unannealed LiNi1-xCoxO2 film. Therefore, it is important to completely eliminate the surface layer in order to achieve high performance from all solid-state thin-film microbatteries.

By substituting the heteroatom template in the Keggin-type polyoxometalate cluster, H6ZnW12O40, it is possible to double the number of electrons and protonation in the redox reactions (from two to four). This increase can be achieved with better matching of the energy levels as indicated by the redox potentials, compared to the ones of well-studied H3PW12O40 and H4SiW12O40. This means that H6ZnW12O40 can act as a high-performance redox mediator in an electrolytic cell for the on-demand generation of hydrogen with a high decoupling efficiency of 95.5 % and an electrochemical energy efficiency of 83.3 %. Furthermore, the H6ZnW12O40 cluster also exhibits an excellent cycling behaviour and redox reversibility with almost 100 % H-2-mediated capacity retention during 200 cycles and a high coulombic efficiency >92 % each cycle at 30 mA cm(-2).									22	1	0	0	1	0	23			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000481086500001	31309625

The vapor-deposited metallic Sm onto the Al2O3 thin film at 300 K is partially oxidized, leading to the appearance of both Sm2+ and Sm3+ states at low coverages, due to the charge transfer from Sm to oxide film. The complete oxidation of the Sm, i.e., all Sm2+ converted to Sm3+, occurs when the sample is annealed to 500 K. Further annealing results in the diffusion of Sm into the Al2O3 lattice. At similar to 900 K, the formation of a SmAlO3 complex is observed. However, this complex starts to decompose and desorb from the surface at temperature higher than 1200 K. Interestingly, it is found that Sm can promote the oxidation of Ni3Al substrate and thicken the alumina film when Sm is deposited at room temperature onto the Al2O3/Ni3Al(111) substrate followed by annealing in oxygen environment at similar to 800 K.

The development of the fingerprints of these compounds with the increase of the counter ion radius, modification of power density, wavelength, or hydration degree allow us to gain a better understanding of the processes involved in ion formation and occurring after laser irradiation. The mixed metal ions are in all probability formed by ion/molecule reactions corresponding to sequential addition of neutral molecules on precursor ions. The ternary system of chromate compounds (chromium-oxygen-chromate counter ion) induced the presence of various neutral species in the gaseous cloud above the analyte surface; these species are responsible for the occurrence of competitive aggregation reactions. In this case, the formation of a given ion is governed by the relative affinity of its precursor ion with either neutral species. Moreover, the evolution of the alkali chromate fingerprint with the power density pushes us into considering the aggregation processes as equilibrium, the reverse way depending on the accumulated internal ion energy. By considering a simple model based on the minimization of unpaired electrons in favor of a greater stability, we additionally put forward two ionic structures for the most intense cluster ion M3CrO4+ observed on the fingerprint of alkali chromate.

Groundwater formed during the last cold period under the influence of the Eemian Sea and the Baltic Ice Lake, and also cryogenic metamorphism was discovered. It was discovered that some relatively small rivers pose as regional drains for groundwater of a significant age. Such reaction of groundwater on the geographic and climatic changes is a consequence of the specific geological and tectonic structure of area, where the Baltic shield is contact with artesian basins and fractured crystalline rocks begins to be covered by the platform sediments.									3	2	1	0	1	0	5			1040-6182	1873-4553		WOS:000487671100010

A non-zero multiple isotopic signature of sulfur (Delta(33)S and Delta(36)S) is produced primarily through photochemical reactions, and it is an almost perfect tracer of the source of sulfur. Once the signature is passed on to a given sulfur reservoir, it will be preserved unless there is addition of sulfur with a different Delta(33)S or Delta(36)S. In the geological record, this signature has been used to study the evolution of the Earth's atmosphere and to trace movement of sulfur through geological systems early in Earth's history. Recently, small but significant mass-independent sigriatures have been reported for some younger samples, raising the possibility of additional applications of multiple isotope studies. The purpose of this review is to introduce and discuss the implications of multiple isotope studies and to focus attention on these anomalous, but not uncommon isotopic signatures.

Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology				23	7			1803	8						2012-Jul	2012	Taking Rumex K-1 leaves as test materials, this paper studied the role of mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) pathway in photoprotection under different light intensities. Under low light intensity (200 micromol x m(-2) x s(-1)), and after treated with salicylhydroxamic acid to inhibit the AOX pathway, the leaf actual photochemical efficiency of PS II, linear electron transport rate of photosynthesis, and photosynthetic O2 evolution rate all decreased significantly while the non-Q(B) reducing reaction center had a significant increase, indicating that under low light, the photoinhibition was aggravated while the scavenging enzymes of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased, which avoided the over-accumulation of ROS and partially alleviated the photoinhibition of Rumex K-1 leaves. Under high light intensity (800 micromol x m(-2) x s(-1)), the inhibition of AOX pathway caused more severe photoinhibition, and the increased activities of ROS scavenging enzymes were insufficient to prevent the over-accumulation of ROS. This study demonstrated that AOX pathway played an important role in the photoprotection in Rumex K-1 leaves under both high and low light intensities, and the role of AOX pathway in photoprotection under high light could be irreplaceable by the other photoprotection pathways in chloroplast.									1	6	0	0	1	0	7			1001-9332			MEDLINE:23173452	23173452

Here, the precipitation of metallic nickel during the internal reduction of nickel-doped yttria stabilized zirconia is studied with electron microscopy and SQUID magnetometry. It is shown that the microstructure evolution proceeds in three distinct stages, each with its own kinetics description, dependent on the porosity and grain size. 0.5 M percent NiO doped YSZ was synthesized, sintered, pressed into pellets, and then exposed to 1000 degrees C in 2% H-2 for various times. Metallic Ni-0 particles (>100 nm) are first formed in pores connected to grain boundaries; subsequently, metallic Ni-0 particles (20-50 nm) precipitate at grain boundaries; and finally, superparamagnetic Ni particles (<10 nm) form within the bulk YSZ grains. The transitions between stages depend upon concentration gradients and electrostatic potentials that act upon the relevant transporting species, namely oxygen vacancies, electrons, nickel ions and zirconium vacancies.

The NiFe-Bi films were investigated as-deposited and after anodic conditioning, and compared to Ni-Bi without intentional Fe doping at Ni(OH)(2) loading from a submonolayer to 10 layers. Fe co-deposition enhanced the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of as-deposited NiFe-Bi films relative to as-deposited Ni-Bi; however, anodic biasing was still required to maximize catalysis. The Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox peaks of NiFe-Bi deposited from 6 : 4 and 4 : 6 Ni : Fe were more cathodic and more reversible than Ni-Bi peaks. Anodic conditioning caused the Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox peaks of Ni-Bi and NiFe-Bi to shift anodically but without narrowing of peak separation, different from the effects of Fe co-deposition. After anodic conditioning, the turnover frequency (TOF) for OER per Ni center for Ni-Bi and NiFe-Bi was more proportional to the Ni content within the first linear Tafel region, with a promoting effect of Fe, and the films exhibited similar Tafel slopes of 37-42 mV dec(-1). With increasing overpotential however, the TOF increased more significantly at high Fe : Ni ratio and was not proportional to the Ni content, and the Tafel slopes varied while notably decreasing for some NiFe-Bi films. Electrochemical results can support a Ni active site at low overpotential, but point to possibly different roles of Fe at low versus high potential. In addition, the effect of adding Fe3+ and Al3+ to the electrolyte was studied after deposition of Ni-Bi. Adding Fe resulted in reaching almost maximum activity in a single potential scan, confirming the promoting role of Fe in Ni-Bi and providing a quick alternative to applying anodic bias for hours to increase activity, while Al in the electrolyte poisoned OER catalysis at Ni-Bi and at NiFe-Bi. In the presence of both Fe and Al ions in solution however, with their opposite effects on the OER, the Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox peaks shifted anodically with potential scanning.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000408678500022

More desired spherical-shaped complex inclusions with an average diameter of about 2.7 mu m, total oxygen of 4 ppm and Mg of 10 ppm after refining were obtained with initial slag basicity of 2.1 and Al2O3 15 wt-%. The relationship between the slag composition and the melting temperature and viscosities of slag was achieved based on a calculation by Factsage Software and Einstein-Roscoe Equation. The refractory-slag-metal-inclusion multiphase reactions were investigated from the viewpoint of thermodynamics and kinetics by the estimation of viscosities, MgO solubility, Al2O3 activity in slag and sulphur capacity of slags. It is experimentally confirmed that the corrosion of MgO crucible by slag was affected by the MgO solubility and viscosity of slag. The factors facilitating to obtain low oxygen and control sulphur content were also analysed. Finally, the composition transformation of inclusions during slag refining and cooling process was discussed based on thermodynamic calculation.									2	2	0	0	0	0	4			0301-9233	1743-2812		WOS:000465569400002

Parametric variations include the injector nozzle orifice diameter (0.31-0.83 mm), injection reservoir pressure (100-200 bar), ambient temperature (1000-1140 K), density (12.5-24 kg/m(3)) and O-2 concentration (10-21 vol.%). The jet ignition delay was found to be highly sensitive to changes in ambient temperature while all other parameter variations resulted in minor ignition delay changes. Optical imaging reveals that in most cases, the reaction front of the H-2 jet initiates from a localised kernel, before engulfing the entire jet volume downstream and recessing towards the nozzle. The flames attach to the nozzle, except at the lowest ambient oxygen condition of 10 vol.% O-2 for which a lifted flame is observed.

J	Sun, Ji; Zhang, Xian; Jin, Meng; Xiong, Qizhong; Wang, Guozhong; Zhang, Haimin; Zhao, Huijun								Robust enhanced hydrogen production at acidic conditions over molybdenum oxides-stabilized ultrafine palladium electrocatalysts								NANO RESEARCH				14	1			268	274		10.1007/s12274-020-3083-3		SEP 2020		JAN 2021	2021	Electrochemical water splitting is quite seductive for eco-friendly hydrogen fuel energy production, however, the attainment of highly efficient, durable, and cheap catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains challenging. In this study, molybdenum oxides stabilized palladium nanoparticle catalysts (MoOx-Pd) arein situprepared on commercial carbon cloth (CC) by the facile two-step method of dip-coating and electrochemical reduction. As a self-supported Pd-based catalyst electrode, the MoOx-Pd/CC presents a competitive Tafel slope of 45.75 mVdec(-1), an ultralow overpotential of 25 mV, and extremely long cycling durability (one week) in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, superior to unmodified Pd catalysts and comparable to commercial Pt mesh electrode. On the one hand, the introduction of MoOx can inhibit the growth of Pd particles to obtain ultrafine Pd nanoparticles, thus exposing more available active sites. On the other hand, density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that MoOx on the surface of Pd metal can regulate the electronic structure of Pd metal and enhance its intrinsic catalytic activity of HER. This work suggests that transitional metal nanoparticles stabilized by molybdenum oxides are hopeful approaches for obtaining fruitful hydrogen-producing electrocatalysts.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000573764700002

Ammonium chloride is added to the ionic solution to regulate the pH of the solution and slow down the release of OH-, effectively regulating the phase, nanostructure, interlayer spacing, surface area, thickness, and the performance of binary Ni-Co hydroxide. The ion-slow-release mechanism is conducive to the formation of alpha-phase with larger interlayer spacing and thinner flakes rather than beta-phase. Attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing, thinner nanosheets, and more exposed active sites, the resultant alpha-phase hydroxides (NCNS-5.2), displayed much lower over potential of 285 mV with respect to the dense-stacked beta-phase hydroxides (362 mV) for OER at 10 mA/cm(2). It also exhibited high specific capacitance of 1474.2 F/g, when tested at 0.5 A/g within a voltage range of 0-0.45 V vs. Hg/HgO. This composite was also stable for water oxidation reaction and supercapacitor. The proof-of-concept of using controlled-release agent may provide suggestive insights for the material innovation and a variety of applications.

However, there is still lack of efficient electrocatalysts at both anode and cathode for glycerol electrolysis. Herein, we report the activation of Ni site in NiV layered double hydroxide (LDH) by electrochemical and N-2/H-2 plasma regulations for boosting the activity of glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Specifically, boosted GOR performance with a low overpotential (1.23 V at 10 mA.cm(-2)) and a high Faradic efficiency (94%) is demonstrated by electrochemically regulated NiV LDH (E-NiV LDH) with elevated valence state of Ni site. In situ Raman spectrum reveals the generation of Ni(III) species by electrochemical regulation, and the highly active Ni(III) can be regenerated with the process of electrochemical oxidation. Additionally, the possible reaction pathway is speculated based on the in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and high-performance liquid chromatography results. The plasma-regulated NiV LDH (P-NiV LDH) with lower valence state of Ni site exhibits outstanding HER activity, displaying a low overpotential of 45 mV to deliver 10 mA.cm(-2). When employing E-NiV LDH and P-NiV LDH as anode and cathode electrocatalyst, respectively, the assembled electrolyzer merely needs 1.25 V to achieve 10 mA.cm(-2) for simultaneous production of formate and hydrogen, demonstrating remarkable 320 mV of lower potential than water electrolysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000743733700002

However, its intrinsic properties appear to be dependent on the synthesis conditions so that from the majority of the reports, it is quite difficult to establish an overall performance trend. In this contribution, we report an extensive and systematic physicochemical and electrochemical screening of the potentiality of chemically synthesized PANI as an electrode material to provide an overall understanding of the effect of the entire synthesis conditions. We have integrated different methods (TGA-DSC, XRD, SEM, EDX, FTIR, BET, CHNS, XPS, CV, and EIS) to deeply examine the as-synthesized materials and interrogate their electrocatalytic efficiency towards hydrogen evolution reaction, which was chosen as a model reaction of critical importance for H-2 production from water splitting. It was found that all the synthesis parameters affect strongly the physical and electrochemical characteristics of the PANI-based materials. Specifically, XPS analysis contributed to identify the oxidation levels of the PAM samples on the basis of oxidizing agents. The outcomes provided by the study delineate a rational pathway for the further design and fabrication of PAM-based metal nanoparticles as advanced electrode materials. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Critical insights from alloys and composites of Ni-based electrocatalysts for HER on NaCl electrolyte								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				915						165352	10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.165352				SEP 15 2022	2022	It is critical to minimize the cost of materials and inputs used in hydrogen production and to create solutions for large-scale generation to reduce the cost of hydrogen produced. Seawater is a natural low-cost electrolyte with high Na+ and Cl- concentrations, among other soluble salts. Chloride ions allow a highly corrosive media to the materials typically used as electrodes. In this work, we have prepared and tested different Ni-based catalysts for hydrogen evolution in NaCl-containing solutions. NiMo alloy, Ni(WO3), and Ni(Nb2O5) composites are compared and studied from a critical point of view to find a viable solution for catalysis in seawater electrolysis. The NiMo catalyst presents a higher dissolution rate in the NaCl medium than all synthesized catalysts. Furthermore, Ni-based composites showed improved durability due to a decrease in dissolution, and an increase in catalytic activity when using Nb2O5 as the dispersed phase. The Ni(Nb2O5) electrodes presented the higher catalytic activity in NaCl solution, even higher than that found in NiMo catalyst.

X-ray diffraction patterns establish the formation of hexagonal bismuth ferrite as the prominent phase, with a small contribution of the Bi2Fe4O9 phase (as reported by others as well) which diminishes rapidly with the increase in Ca concentration. Interestingly, above a calcium dopant concentration of about 10 % peaks of Fe2O3 (both a and c components) are observed with a concomitant enhancement of ferromagnetism. Small contribution of the Bi6Ca4O13 phase is also noted in these samples. This phase evolution is driven by dopant-induced strain energy and increasing oxygen vacancy concentration for local charge balance. Transmission electronmicroscopy (with elemental scanning) and Mossbauer spectroscopy techniques bring out the evolution of nanoparticle morphology (and elemental distribution) and phase configuration, respectively. Measurements of photocatalytic activity (and photo-Fenton activity with H2O2) reveal that Ca doping at the Bi site in BFO enhances the activity significantly in the concentration regime where BFO/alpha(gamma)-Fe2O3 phases coexist in the form of a nanocomposite. The enhancement can thus be attributed to the carrier transfer between BFO and alpha(gamma)-Fe2O3 across nano p/n junctions leading to enhanced carrier lifetime. Importantly, the magnetization of the nanocomposite (about 16 emu gm(-1) at x = 0.20) provides a convenient way to collect the photocatalyst with the help of an external magnet for reuse.									32	2	0	0	4	0	32			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000322593200042

This study was aimed at determining experimentally the validity of the kinetic assumptions made in existing literature to account for the oxidation Of UO2 into U3O8 and also to determine precisely the structural evolution, in relation to the kinetic behaviour. Our results provide evidence of four distinct kinetic time domains, and the assumption of a single rate-limiting step is verified only for two of them. The crystalline phases associated with these domains are also identified. In fact, the first kinetic domain corresponds to the reaction Of UO2 into U4O9; the second one is linked to the two simultaneous reactions, UO2 into U4O9 and U4O9 into U3O7. Finally, the transition from U3O7 into U3O8 corresponds to the third and fourth kinetic domains. These results show that the oxidation Of UO2 into U3O8 cannot satisfactorily be described with modelling approaches used in the literature. A new general outline is proposed to study the oxidation of uranium oxides. This outline will improve both the understanding and predictions of oxidation processes at the relatively low temperatures that are expected during interim storage of spent nuclear fuel.

Evolution of different gaseous species during carbonization were analyzed at different temperatures and densities. Elementary reactions were identified leading to the formation of small gaseous species. Cleavage of homolytic O-H bond was found to be the first step of sub-bituminous coal carbonization. CH4 formed mainly due to reaction of center dot CH3 with hydrogen radical/hydrogen abstraction. Among others, C9HmOn radicals were the most abundant species at any simulations condition considered here, where m = 9, 8 or 7 and n = 1, 2 or 3. Bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the identified reactions decreased by similar to 3.0 kcal/mol for endothermic reactions and increased by similar to 3.0 kcal/mol for exothermic due to change in enthalpy at higher temperature. It was observed that the formation of 5-membered carbon only rings and sp-hybridized carbon species played crucial role in the subsequent growth. The results agree with available experimental observations and computational studies. This work provides new insights on the carbonization mechanism of subbituminous coal. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The combustion reaction mainly occurs in the mixture of O-2 and H2O instead of recycled flue gas (mainly CO2). The purpose of this research is to clarify the evolution characteristics of O/N-containing complexes (C(O)/C(N)) during O-2/H2O combustion. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed in this study. The addition of H2O in the atmosphere promoted the generation of NO and HCN in char combustion. There was a good linear relationship between the C(O) amount and char reactivity, as well as the NO conversion ratio, during the O-2/H2O combustion process. Moreover, trace amounts of the precursors of CO2 with low thermal stability remained on the particle surface in the O-2/H2O combustion. The enhancement of the reaction temperature revealed positive effects on inhibiting NO emissions in the O-2/H2O combustion. The relative amount of pyrrole (N-5), which was the precursor of HCN, increased apparently at the expense of pyridine (N-6) and quaternary nitrogen (N-Q) in the early reaction stage. VVhen the char conversion degree exceeded 50%, N-Q and N-6 became the dominant forms of C(N).									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000482499000002

Acid mine drainage (AMD) ecosystems are characterized by low pH values, enhanced levels of metal ions and low species abundance. Furthermore, metal sulfides, such as pyrite and chalcopyrite, generate extracellular ROS upon exposure to acidic water. Consequently, oxidative stress management is especially important in acidophilic leaching microorganisms present in industrial biomining operations, especially when forming biofilms on metal sulfides. Several adaptive mechanisms have been described, but the molecular repertoire of responses upon exposure to pyrite and the presence of ROS are not thoroughly understood in acidophiles. In this study the impact of the addition of H2O2 on iron oxidation activity in Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans DSM 14882(T) was investigated. Iron(II)- or sulfur-grown cells showed a higher sensitivity toward H2O2 than pyrite-grown ones. In order to elucidate which molecular responses may be involved, we used shot-gun proteomics and compared proteomes of cells grown with iron(II)-ions against biofilm cells, grown for 5 days in presence of pyrite as sole energy source. In total 1157 proteins were identified. 213 and 207 ones were found to have increased levels in iron(II) ion-grown or pyrite-biofilm cells, respectively. Proteins associated with inorganic sulfur compound (ISC) oxidation were among the latter. In total, 80 proteins involved in ROS degradation, thiol redox regulation, macromolecule repair mechanisms, biosynthesis of antioxidants, as well as metal and oxygen homeostasis were found. 42 of these proteins had no significant changes in abundance, while 30 proteins had increased levels in pyrite-biofilm cells. New insights in ROS mitigation strategies, such as importance of globins for oxygen homeostasis and prevention of unspecific reactions of free oxygen that generate ROS are presented for A. ferrooxidans biofilm cells. Furthermore, proteomic analyses provide insights in adaptations of carbon fixation and oxidative phosphorylation pathways under these two growth conditions.									32	1	0	0	24	0	33			1664-302X			WOS:000462717400001	30984136

Here, we uncovered that the strong polar bond in support can significantly boost the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction activity and durability of Pd nanoparticles (NPs). The mass-specific activity and surface-specific activity of optimized Pd/p-BNO at 0.90 V (vs.RHE) is almost 1.9 and 2.2 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. By means of a joint experimental and computational study, the enhanced activity of Pd/p-BNO stems from the electron directly transfer through the strong polar O-B bonds from support to Pd NPs leading to the electron-rich Pd surface. Moreover, the strong bonding effect of the caused by polarity bond effectively improves the stability of Pd/p-BNO. This progress demonstrates the vital role of polar chemical bonds in support on inducing SMSI effect, which might open up new opportunities in designing superior heterogeneous catalysts.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000782991900001

Our two-dimensional, self-consistent explosion model of an ECSN predicts ejection of neutron-rich matter with electron fractions Y-e approximate to 0.40-0.42 and relatively low entropies, s approximate to 13-15 k(B) per nucleon (k(B) is the Boltzmann constant). Post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations result in appreciable production of Ca-48 in such neutron-rich and low-entropy matter during the quasi-nuclear equilibrium and subsequent freezeout phases. The amount of ejected Ca-48 can account for that in the solar inventory when we consider possible uncertainties in the entropies. ECSNe could thus be a site of 48Ca production in addition to a hypothetical, rare class of high-density Type Ia supernovae.									51	1	0	0	0	0	52			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000317411100006

Theoretical computations unveil that FeTe2 possesses abundant surface-terminated and low-coordinate Fe sites that can activate the NRR with a low limiting potential (-0.84 V) and currently impede the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. As a proof-of-concept prototype, we synthesized FeTe2 nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide (FeTe2/RGO), which exhibited a high NRR activity with the exceptional combination of NH3 yield (39.2 lg h-1 mg-1) and Faradaic efficiency (18.1%), thus demonstrating the feasibility of using FeTe2 and other earth-abundant metal tellurides for electrocatalytic N2 fixation. ? 2020 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Nanocatalysts, with size ranging from hundreds of nanometers to the atomic scale, possess activities that are closely connected to their structural characteristics such as particle size, surface morphology, and three-dimensional topography. Recently, the development of advanced analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques, especially quantitative high-angle annular darkfield (HAADF) imaging and high-energy resolution spectroscopy analysis in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) at the atomic scale, strengthens the power of (S) TEM in analyzing the structural/chemical information of heterogeneous catalysts. Three-dimensional reconstruction from two-dimensional projected images and the real-time recording of structural evolution during catalytic reactions using in-situ (S) TEM methods further broaden the scope of (S) TEM observation. The atomic-scale structural information obtained from high-resolution (S) TEM has proven to be of significance for better understanding and designing of new catalysts with enhanced performance.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1674-1056	1741-4199		WOS:000432668900004

Such a nanocomposite showed efficient electrocatalytic activity in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both acidic and basic solutions. The optimal overpotential required for the current density of 20 mA cm(-2) (020) in acidic solution is 164 mV, which is favourably comparable to those of recently reported nonprecious electrocatalysts; whereas in basic solution the value of 020 is 376 mV. The HER activity of Fe2P/NGr can be correlated to Fe2P nanoparticles in the nanocomposite, and NGr is beneficial to the electron transport from electrode to the catalyst. The faradaic efficiency of Fe2P/NGr nanocomposite in HER is nearly 100% in both acidic and basic solutions. The stability of Fe2P/NGr nanocomposite during HER has been demonstrated by potentiostatic electrolysis and accelerated degradation experiments. Tafel slope was determined to be 65 mV dec(-1), which suggests that the HER processes might proceed along a Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. The catalytic activity of Fe2P/NGr nanocomposite is influenced by synthesis temperature, which may result in the differences in phase purity, particle size and specific surface areas of the composite material. The charged natures of Fe and P in Fe2P nanoparticle might be responsible for the HER activity of Fe2P/NGr nanocomposite. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A cost-effective copper doped porous carbon (Cu-PC) has been synthesized here by carbonizing Cu that contains metal-organic framework (MOF)-5. Results show the Cu-PC exhibits ORR activity by following the four-electron route, and the number of electron transfers (n) is nearly 4. In addition, onset potential (E (o)), half-wave potential (E (1/2)), and limiting current density (J (L)) are nearly equal and far better than commercial Pt/C (20 wt.%). The Cu-PC-800 exhibits superior activity with E (o) 0.99 V and E (1/2) 0.87 V compared to commercial Pt/C (E (o) 0.94 V and E (1/2) 0.83 V) as well as from several prepared catalysts. More importantly, the Cu-PC-800 displays superior stability in alkaline solution compared to Pt/C catalyst. These superior activities are attributed to the interaction of Cu nanoparticles with the support of porous carbon. The effects of carbonizing temperature and Cu doping on the ORR activity have been studied. The electrochemical tests showed that both metal doping and the temperature of pyrolysis could induce the electrocatalytic activity. The metal codoping and carbonizing approach will positively affect electrocatalyst efficiency and guide the development of new transition metal porous carbon ORR electrocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2399-1984		WOS:000739531800001

Despite many Pt/support hybrid materials that have been reported as promising electrocatalysts for the ORR, precisely controlling the contact facet between the Pt and the support has never been demonstrated to mediate the ORR. Herein, based on theoretical calculations, we constructed an interesting Pt/support electrocatalyst by chemically coupling Pt nanoparticles (NPs) with single crystal (Sc) LiTiO2 nano-octahedra (Pt NPs/Sc-LiTiO2) for the first time. Specifically, the Pt {111} atomic crystal planes are in contact with the highly lattice-matched Sc-LiTiO2 {111} crystal planes to form specific crystal-plane coupling heterostructures, leading to strong cooperative effects between the Sc-LiTiO2 and the Pt as well as to the epitaxial growth and favorable exposed facets of Pt on the surface of Sc-LiTiO2. These key features endow Pt NPs/Sc-LiTiO2 with a mass activity of 1.44 A mg(Pt)(-1) and specific activity of 1.78 mA cm(-2) at 0.9 V, which are 8.0 and 7.1-fold higher than those of the state-of-the-art Pt/C, respectively. Meanwhile, it can undergo 20000 sweep cycles with negligible activity decay and no obvious changes in morphology or composition, showing excellent ORR durability. The resulting ORR performance is also comparable to or even better than those of most first-class Pt-based electrocatalysts. Our synthetic strategy could be easily extended to the design and fabrication of other robust metal/support electrocatalysts.									15	0	0	0	1	0	14			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000571079300001

Four nanometer size CuxMn0.9-xCo2.1O4 samples (x = 0, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9) were prepared and characterized with XRD, SEM, TEM, and cyclic voltammetry. The CuxMn0.9-xCo2.1O4 samples exhibited promising ORR and OER catalytic activities. The gap between ORR half wave potentials of Pt/C and CuxMn0.9-xCo2.1O4 in 1 M KOH achieved only 50 mV. The onset potentials for OER on CUxMn0.9-xCO2.1O4 catalysts were more than 100 mV more negative than Pt/C in 1 M KOH. MEA with CuxMn0.9-xCO2.1O4 bifunctional oxygen electrode was prepared with CCM method and applied in a laboratory scale regenerative fuel cell. In fuel cell mode the peak power density was over 80 mW cm(-2) and in electrolyser mode the onset voltage was about 1.55 V.

In this work, L-asparagine (Asn), an amino acid derivative, has been used as a doping agent to prepare nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide gels (N-GAs). The 3D interconnected structure gives rise to the superior electrochemical properties for supercapacitor and electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The N-GA-4 (the mass ratio of Asn to graphene oxide (GO) is 4:1 by hydrothermal method) electrode shows the capacitance of 291.6 F.g(-1) at 0.5 A.g(-1). Meanwhile, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor achieves a maximum energy density of 23.8 Wh.kg(-1) when the power density is 451.2 W.kg(-1), and demonstrates an ultralong cycling life that the retention of capacitance is 99.3% after 80 000 cycles. What's more, the annealed aerogel N-GA-4-900 exhibits an onset potential (E-onset) of 0.95 V, half wave potential (E-1/(2)) of 0.84 V (vs. RHE) and the oxygen reduction current density of 5.5 mA.cm(-2) at 0.1 V with nearly four-electron transfer, which are superior to commercial Pt/C. This work offers a new insight into the synthesis and applications of N-GAs materials towards high performance in supercapacitors and ORR.									9	3	0	0	0	0	9			1001-604X	1614-7065		WOS:000544600200001

Relying on single type of doping usually cannot yield optimal electronic and geometric structures favorable for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, heteroatom N, P, and S simultaneously doped graphene-like carbon (NPS-G) was successfully synthesized from onium salts by a facile one-step pyrolysis method. The resulting metal-free NPS-G catalyst with optimized N, P, and S contents exhibits enhanced catalytic activity towards the ORR in alkaline media, relative to any single doping. In particular, this metal-free catalyst shows an encouraging half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.857 V) comparable to that of metal-based catalysts. It also demonstrates excellent electrochemical stability and methanol tolerance. This catalyst was further studied as a cathode in a primary Zn-air battery, showing exceptional open-circuit voltage (1.372 V) and power density (0.151 W cm(-2)). The NPS-G cathode delivers a specific capacity of 686 mA h g(zn)(-1) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) while utilizing 82.2% of the theoretical capacity (835 mA h g(zn)(-1)). The origin of high activity associated with various heteroatom dopings is elucidated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis and density functional theory studies. The enhanced chemisorption of oxygen species (*OOH, *O and *OH) onto the dopants of the NPS-G catalysts reduces charge transfer resistance and facilitate the ORR. The porous 2D structure also contributes to the increase of active site density and facile mass transport.									205	12	0	0	13	0	207			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000449444000046

The films were deposited at various negative bias voltages (V-b) in order to vary the TiNx stoichiometry and then exposed to several gases and to air at room temperature. The oxidation rate was found to depend strongly on V-b and thus on film stoichiometry. Fast oxidation was observed in films deposited at low \V-b\, that contain nitrogen which is weakly bonded to Ti and can be easily replaced by oxygen. At high \V-b\ values (aboue - 80 V) stoichiometric TiN films were developed, that were stable and not prone to oxidation. The results showed that oxidation takes place in the bulk of thr: film and can proceed up to about 10% transformation of titanium nitride into titanium oxide. The fastest step in the him oxidation mechanism is diffusion of oxygen along the columnar grain boundary structure, followed by the reaction of oxygen with the weakly bonded TiN. The results suggest that the oxidation process proceeds with different stages involving formation of TiON, followed by a slow stage of TiO2 formation. These microstructural changes are consistent with the evolution of compressive stresses in the films surd the increase in film density and thickness and the: decrease in surface roughness as determined by X-ray reflectivity.

The strong affinity of titanium to oxygen dictates that it is very difficult to produce low-oxygen Ti metal from TiO2 directly. In this paper, a hydrogen assisted magnesiothermic reduction (HAMR) process for producing Ti metal powder from TiO2 powder at relatively low temperatures (<= 750 degrees C) is established. The overall approach is based on the thermodynamic tuning of the relative stability of MgO versus that of Ti-O solid solutions by temporarily alloying the system with hydrogen. It is shown that Ti-H-O solid solutions are less stable than their corresponding Ti-O solid solutions, which changes the reaction of Mg with Ti-O from being thermodynamically unfavorable to being favorable. The key steps for producing pure Ti metal powder from TiO2 involve Mg reduction of TiO2 in a hydrogen atmosphere which produces porous TiH2, a heat treatment procedure to consolidate the powder and reduce specific surface area of the powder, and the final step to deoxygenate the powder using Mg in a hydrogen atmosphere to further reduce the oxygen content. This paper systematically examines the changes of oxygen content, phase transformations, and the evolution of the morphology of the particles during the entire process. The results show that this approach has great potential to be a viable method for the production of low-oxygen Ti metal powder from TiO2. In addition, the effect of hydrogen on the oxidation of Ti powder is analyzed using XPS, which reaffirms that titanium hydride is more impervious to surface oxidation than Ti metal, another crucial advantage of using hydrogen atmosphere.

Then, it was combined with ZnIn2S4 nanosheets containing zinc vacancies to construct a three-dimensional (3D) flower-like Z-scheme heterojunction (pCN-N/ZIS-Z), which was used for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and the degradation of mixed pollutants. The constructed Z-scheme heterojunction improved the efficiency of photogenerated charges separation and migration, and the large surface area and porous characteristics provided more active sites. Doping and defect engineering can change the bandgap structure to improve the utilization of visible light, and can also capture photogenerated electrons to inhibit recombination, so as to promote the use of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in the photocatalytic redox process. Heterojunction and defect engineering synergized to form a continuous and efficient conductive operation framework, which achieves the hydrogen production of pCN-N/ZIS-Z (9189.8 mu mol center dot h(-1)center dot g(-1)) at 58.9 times that of g-C3N4 (155.9 mu mol center dot h(-1)center dot g(-1)), and the degradation rates of methyl orange and metronidazole in the mixed solution were 98.7% and 92.5%, respectively. Our research provides potential ideas for constructing a green and environmentally friendly Z-scheme heterojunction catalyst based on defect engineering to address the energy crisis and environmental restoration.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2079-4991		WOS:000716979700001	34684924

Measurements were made for deposits in the two main paleoaquifers in the area, the Lower Cambrian Shady and Lower Ordovician Knox, and included the large East Tennessee ore field and the Austinville district. delta(18)O and SD values for sphalerite-hosted brines in the two main paleoaquifers cluster in separate fields. Those in the Lower Cambrian paleoaquifer form an elongate array that extends from delta(18)O = 2 parts per thousand and delta D = -41 parts per thousand to delta(18)O = 5 parts per thousand and delta D = -87 parts per thousand. Those in the Lower Ordovician paleoaquifer form a cluster at about delta(18)O = 7 parts per thousand and delta D = -35 parts per thousand. Stable isotope compositions of fluid inclusion-hosted brines in fluorite from the Lower Ordovician paleoaquifer form an array that extends from the Lower Ordovician hosted sphalerite cluster toward the composition of modern formation waters in the Lower Ordovician paleoquifer, which plot along the meteoric water line. Stable isotope compositions of fluids in barite form an array that extends toward very low delta D values typical of organic matter or gas. These data permit, but do not require, the interpretation that the mineralizing brines contain seawater with hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions that were modified by reaction with country rocks, particularly with organic matter and/or hydrocarbon gas. When the Appalachian data are plotted together with those from other MVT districts in the mid-continent, the combined data form a broad array that extends downward from hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions typical of seawater, toward low delta D values such as would form by fluid interaction with organic matter or gas. Consideration of published isotopic compositions of brines from other MVT deposits suggests that interaction with organic matter and/or gas may be an important process in the evolution of ore-forming brines.

The a priori choice of this precursor is dictated mainly by its oxygen and halogen-free ligands allowing co-deposition with oxophilic elements such as Al and by its ability to provide conformal Cu films in atomic layer deposition processes. The nucleation delay and the deposition rate as a function of deposition temperature and the evolution of the deposition rate along the radius of the substrate holder are experimentally determined with depositions performed at 1333 Pa in a vertical, warm wall, MOCVD reactor. With the aim to propose a kinetic scenario for Cu deposition, based on recently published experimental results for the decomposition of [Cu(amd)](2), a predictive 3D model of the process is built, based on the mass, momentum, energy and species transport equations. In agreement with the previously mentioned experimental results, it is demonstrated that a single surface reaction is responsible for the deposition of Cu. Two surface kinetics expressions are implemented depending on the deposition regime; a simple Arrhenius type expression in the reaction limited regime and a Langmuir-Hinshelwood type expression prevailing in the transport limited regime which takes into account the inhibition effects. The two different kinetics designate a modification in the surface reaction mechanism. The results show good agreement between experiments and computations. Complementary computations are performed, in order to compare the deposition rates of the Cu films deposited via the [Cu(amd)](2) and the (hfac)Cu(VTMS) and Cu(hfac)(2) so as to determine relative advantages and disadvantages of Cu MOCVD from [Cu(amd)](2).

Recently, there has been a growing interest in the study of carbene-ligated nanocrystals, primarily coinage metal nanocrystals, which have found application as catalysts for numerous reactions. The general ability of NHC ligands to positively affect the catalytic properties of other types of nanocrystal catalysts remains unknown. Herein, we present the first carbene-stabilized Cu3-xP nanocrystals. Inquiries into the mechanism of formation of NHC-ligated Cu3-xP nanocrystals suggest that crystalline Cu3-xP forms directly as a result of a high-temperature metathesis reaction between a tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine precursor and an NHC-CuBr precursor, the latter of which behaves as a source of both the carbene ligand and Cu+. To study the effect of the NHC surface ligands on the catalytic performance, we tested the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolving ability of the NHC-ligated Cu3-xP nanocrystals and found that they possess superior activity to analogous oleylamine-ligated Cu3-xP nanocrystals. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the NHC ligands minimize unfavorable electrostatic interactions between the copper phosphide surface and H+ during the first step of the hydrogen evolution reaction, which contributes to the superior performance of NHC-ligated Cu3-xP catalysts as compared to oleylamine-ligated Cu3-xP catalysts.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526583500042	32174101

The substitutional carbon concentration is found to decrease as a function of fluence for 50 laser pulses performed at room temperature and vacuum, The strain profile evolution is obtained with x-ray diffraction and dynamical diffraction simulations. After melting, most of the strain is released, and a new FTIR and Raman peak appears around 830 cm(-1). This feature is attributed to the formation of SIC microprecipitates and V-O asymmetrical centers. A mechanism for the substitutional carbon removal is proposed, It involves SiC precipitation and reaction between V-O and substitutional carbon to form volatile CO. In the case of pulsed laser induced epitaxy, we predict that the highest substitutional carbon content should be obtained with one laser pulse in an oxygen-free ambiant. From these results, it is inferred that pulsed-laser-induced epitaxy is suitable for the localized patterning of ultrashallow buried Si1-yCy junctions.

After acid treatment, a substantial number of -OH groups were obtained on the surface of HP25-60, which can act as Broslashnsted acid sites providing hydrogen protons for H2 generation. Besides, more oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ sites were also created on the HP25-60 surface after acid treatment, which could enhance the carrier separation and transfer efficiency by capturing more electrons and holes, respectively. The H2 production over HP25-60 reached 4853 mumol h-1 with Pt as a co-catalyst, which is 7.1 times higher than 679 mumol h-1 of bare TiO2. Three favorable factors for H2 photogeneration, i.e. Broslashnsted acid sites, oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ sites, can be introduced on a catalyst surface via a simple one-step acid strategy, which can be applied as a universally-applicable modification method for valence-alternative metal oxide semiconductors for enhanced H2 photogeneration.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753			INSPEC:20643019

The annealed NG (NG-A) possessed high specific surface area and a hierarchical porous texture, and exhibited remarkably improved electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction in both alkaline and acidic media. Ab initio molecular dynamic simulations indicated that rapid H transfer and the thermodynamic stability of six-membered N structures promoted the transformation of N-containing species from pyrrolic to pyridinic at 600 A degrees C. In O-2-staturated 0.1 M KOH solution, the half-wave potential (E (1/2)) of NG-A was only 62 mV lower than that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst, and the limiting current density of NG-A was 0.5 mA center dot cm(-2) larger than that of Pt/C. Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots and rotating ring-disk electrode measurement indicated a four-electron-transfer pathway in NG-A, which could be ascribed to its high content of pyridinic N.									75	8	0	0	0	0	78			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000371797000022

Cloud formation in carbon- and oxygen-rich environments								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				603						A123	10.1051/0004-6361/201629696				JUL 2017	2017	Context. Recent observations indicate potentially carbon-rich (CO > 1) exoplanet atmospheres. Spectral fitting methods for brown dwarfs and exoplanets have invoked the CO ratio as additional parameter but carbon-rich cloud formation modeling is a challenge for the models applied. The determination of the habitable zone for exoplanets requires the treatment of cloud formation in chemically different regimes.Aims. We aim to model cloud formation processes for carbon-rich exoplanetary atmospheres. Disk models show that carbon-rich or near-carbon-rich niches may emerge and cool carbon planets may trace these particular stages of planetary evolution.Methods. We extended our kinetic cloud formation model by including carbon seed formation and the formation of C[s], TiC[s], SiC[s], KCl[s], and MgS[s] by gas-surface reactions. We solved a system of dust moment equations and element conservation for a prescribed DRIFT -PHOENIX atmosphere structure to study how a cloud structure would change with changing initial C/O-0 = 0.43 ... 10.0.Results. The seed formation efficiency is lower in carbon-rich atmospheres than in oxygen-rich gases because carbon is a very effective growth species. The consequence is that fewer particles make up a cloud if C/O-0 > 1. The cloud particles are smaller in size than in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. An increasing initial CO ratio does not revert this trend because a much greater abundance of condensible gas species exists in a carbon-rich environment. Cloud particles are generally made of a mix of materials: carbon dominates if C/O-0 > 1 and silicates dominate if C/O-0 < 1. A carbon content of 80-90% carbon is reached only in extreme cases where C/O-0 = 3.0 or 10.0.Conclusions. Carbon-rich atmospheres form clouds that are made of particles of height-dependent mixed compositions, sizes and numbers. The remaining gas phase is far less depleted than in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. Typical tracer molecules are HCN and C2H2 in combination with a featureless, smooth continuum due to a carbonaceous cloud cover, unless the cloud particles become crystalline.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000406619100039

We combine density functional theory total energy calculations and Keldysh Green's function methods in order to determine the changes in the structure and conductance induced by the presence of hydrogen and oxygen atomic impurities. Our simulations show how atomic oxygen is incorporated into the nanowire, forming long monoatomic chains, in good agreement with the experimental observation. The presence of adsorbed atomic impurities introduces significant changes in the conductance, providing a quantitative explanation for the new peaks found in the conductance histograms recorded in the presence of the corresponding molecular species. The exothermic character of the dissociation process in the nanowire found in our study provides a sound basis for the presence of these atomic impurities, although the problem of finding a low-activation energy path for the oxygen molecule remains open. This enhanced chemical reactivity can be traced back, through the analysis of the local density of states, to both the reduced coordination and the applied tensile strain.									43	1	1	0	1	0	44			1098-0121			WOS:000254542800199

We now show improved HER activity of Ni compared with Co hangman porphyrins. Cyclic voltammogram data and simulations, together with computational studies using density functional theory, implicate a shift in electrokinetic zone between Co and Ni hangman porphyrins due to a change in the PCET mechanism. Unlike the Co hangman porphyrin, the Ni hangman porphyrin does not require reduction to the formally metal(0) species before protonation by weak acids in acetonitrile. We conclude that protonation likely occurs at the Ni(I) state followed by reduction, in a stepwise proton transfer-electron transfer pathway. Spectroelectrochemical and computational studies reveal that upon reduction of the Ni(II) compound, the first electron is transferred to a metal-based orbital, whereas the second electron is transferred to a molecular orbital on the porphyrin ring.									125	1	1	0	16	1	125			0027-8424			WOS:000343302600029	25298534

Positional dependence of texture orientation and microstructural features, which might be attributed primarily to bombardment of high energetic oxygen species on the film in the region of the target erosion area, were observed. The films deposited at low temperature and/or using pure argon had (002) preferred orientation and a smooth columnar structure. At increasing substrate temperature and/or oxygen partial pressure, c-axis orientation of the film was severely degraded and abnormal elongated crystallites were also developed. As the films became thicker, c-axis orientation changed from normal to the substrate to parallel to the substrate. In this case, the microstructure was altered from a smooth fine columnar structure to abnormally grown elongated crystallites that were developed to a faceted texture structure.

Here, pristine and functionalized g-C3N4 with B-doping at bay C site (B-C1-C3N4), corner C site (B-C2-C3N4), Co-loading (Co-C3N4) and Coloading and B-doping together [(Co-B)(C1)-C3N4 and (Co-B)(C2)-C3N4] have been studied for structural, electronic, optical and photocatalytic properties using hybrid density functional theory. B-doping in g-C3N4 formed p-type semiconductor while Co-loading revealed formation of n-type semiconductor with formation of Co-3d intermediate states while both together indicated partial charge compensation. All the functionalized films show lower overpotential value for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as compared to g-C3N4 while for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) lower overpotential values are obtained for Co-C3N4, (Co-B)(C1)-C3N4 and (Co-B)(C2)-C3N4. The present work, highlights the synergistic effects of Co-loading and B-doping in g-C3N4 in terms of formation of impurity states, high absorption, charge redistribution and lower OER and HER overpotential along with suitable redox potentials than g-C3N4 and suggests (Co-B)(C1)-C3N4 as potential candidate for overall photocatalytic water splitting.

Therefore, chromium redox transformations were investigated in the aquatic environment under conditions as close to natural as possible - at intermediate pH and in the presence of original bottom sediment and dissolved oxygen.Reduction of Cr(VI) in the Radomka river water occurs at a low rate (t(1/2) = 19 h). The rate of Cr(VI) reduction increased in the river water spiked by HA (t(1/2) = 0.5 h), and Fe(II) (t(1/2) = 2 min). The kinetics of Cr(VI) reduction by Fe(II) was dependent on the evolution of the forms of Cr(VI) and the competing Fe(II) oxidation reaction by dissolved oxygen. The reduction of Cr(VI) by humic acids appeared to be a significantly slower process than Fe(II) oxidation by O-2.Chromium(III) present in the tanning liquor used and the aged solution of chromium sulphate was less prone to oxidation by MnO2 than Cr(III) introduced with chromium nitrate and sulphate solutions (7% and 10% conversion over 1 h in comparison with 55% and 32%, respectively). Chromium deposits in bottom sediment turned out to be resistant to oxidation by MnO2.									4	1	0	0	3	0	4			1230-1485			WOS:000176505600022

Maximizing its performance per metal atom is essential in order to reduce costs. The deposition of small Pt nanoparticles (2-3 nm) onto electrically conductive, highly accessible and stable carbon supports leads to active catalysts. However, blocking of pores and active sites by Nafion, which acts as a binding species, reduces the catalytic activity. Moreover, inaccessible Pt located in micropores diminishes an efficient exploitation of the noble metal.We report a new synthesis approach to ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) coatings with preformed Pt nanoparticles. The particles are exclusively located inside the mesopores. Furthermore, no Nafion binder is needed. As a consequence, the PtNP/OMC catalyst film outperforms Pt/C catalysts reported in literature particularly at high current densities. PtNP/OMC catalyst films with a geometric Pt loading of 1.6 mu g(pt)/cm(2) achieve a current density of -100 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of ca. -70 mV. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The design of earth-abundant electrode materials without extra binders for an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is critical in realizing the hydrogen economy in the push for future sustainable development. Herein, three-dimensional (W3D) porous electrodes (denoted CoOx-CNT-CC) featuring CoOx nanoparticles (NPs) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) growing on activated carbon fiber were synthesized through a one-pot pyrolysis process. The achieved 3D electrodes acted as efficient electrocatalysts as well as current collectors for hydrogen production, greatly simplifying the electrode preparation process. Impressively, the electrodes exhibited high current density under low overpotential. The current density can reach up to similar to 720 mA cm (2), an overpotential of similar to 99 mV is required to reach a current density of 20 mA cm (2), and they function with a durability of up to 70 h. Beyond that, the electrodes still show superb catalytic properties at low temperature (the current density is 326 mA cm (2) even at 278 K) and in a neutral medium (the current density is 450 mA cm (2) in 1 M PBS).									38	2	0	0	2	0	39			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000402387900047

The C8 formation of an n-n isotype heterojunction was confirmed by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The photocatalytic efficiency of the In2S3/BiVO4 catalyst was examined over degradation of oxytetracycline hydrochloride (O-TCH) and oxygen (O-2) evolution reaction. Consequently, an n-n In2S3/BiVO4 isotype heterojunction exhibits a superior O-TCH degradation efficiency (94.6%, 120 min) and O-2 evolution (695.76 mu mol, 120 min) of multiple folds as compared to the pure BiVO4 and In2S3 solely. This is attributed to the proper band alignment and intimate interfacial interaction promoted charge carrier separation over the n-n isotype heterojunction. The intimate interfacial contact was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM, and field emission scanning electron microscopy analysis. The proper band alignment was confirmed by Mott-Schottky analysis. The photoelectrochemical linear sweep voltammetric study shows a superior photocurrent density (269 mu A/cm(2)) for In2S3/BiVO4 as compared to those for pristine BiVO4 and In2S3, which is in good agreement with the photocatalytic results. Furthermore, the superior charge antirecombination efficiency of the n-n isotype heterojunction was established by photoluminescence, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Bode analysis, transient photocurrent, and carrier density analysis. The improved photostability of the heterojunction was confirmed by chronoamperometry analysis. An orderly corelationship among physicochemical, electrochemical, and photocatalytic properties was established, and a possible mechanistic pathway was presented to better understand the outcome of the n-n isotype heterojunction. This study presents an effective way to develop new n-n isotype heterojunction-based efficient photocatalysts and could enrich wide applications in other areas.									29	0	0	0	2	0	29			2470-1343			WOS:000520853400062	32201816

The powder consists of a mixture of high-purity Cu powder, pre alloyed CuSn and CuP powder. Liquid phase sintering with complete melting of the binder (CuSn) but non-melting of the cores of structural metal (Cu) proves to be a feasible mechanism for laser sintering of this powder system. The microstructural evolution of the sintered powder with variation of laser processing parameters was presented. High sintering activities and sound densification response were obtained by optimizing the laser powers and scan speeds. Using a high laser power accompanied by a high scan speed gives rise to balling effect. At a high laser power with a slow scan speed the sintering mechanism may change into complete melting/solidification, which decreases the obtainable sintered density. The role of additive phosphorus in the laser sintering process is addressed. Phosphorus can act as a fluxing agent and has a preferential reaction with oxygen to form phosphatic slag, protecting the Cu particles from oxidation. The phosphatic slag shows a concentration along grain boundaries due to its light mass as well as the short thermal cycle of SLS.									7	2	0	0	0	0	8			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000234534800019

X-ray structure determinations for 6 and 9 show them to be one-dimensional coordination polymers composed of E(OtBu)(4) (E = Sb, Bi) units linked through potassium atoms. These E(OtBu), units display a Psi-trigonal-bipyramidal coordination around the metal atom (Sb-O = 1.971(2) and 2.181(2) Angstrom, Bi-O = 2.068(8) and 2.275(8) Angstrom). Both the structures exhibit a planar four-coordinate environment of oxygen around the potassium atoms (K-O = 2.650(2)-2.967(2) Angstrom in 6, 2.53(1)-3.15(1) Angstrom in 9). Compound 2 reacts with two equivalents of KOtBu to afford K2Sb(OtBu)(5) dioxane (10), which contains Sb2K2O5 cage units and can be described as an O-5 trigonal bipyramid with metal atoms inserted in the equatorial edges. Each metal atom is tetracoordinated by oxygen atoms of the cage (Sb-O = 1.979(3)-2.144(3) Angstrom, K-O = 2.592(3)-2.775(2) Angstrom). The dioxane molecules increase the coordination number at each potassium atom to five by Forming bridges between the molecules through K-O bonds. Reaction of 2 and 3 with NaOtBu produce the cluster compounds Na4Sb2O(OtBu)(8) (4) and Na4Bi2O(OtBu)(8) (5) in high yields. K4Sb2O(OtBu)(8) (11) is obtained in almost quantitative yield by heating KSb(OtBu)(4) in benzene for 24 h. Compounds 4, 5 and 11 crystallise in rhombohedral lattices; the crystal structure analyses show a superposition of molecules, with an isotropic oxygen-centred Mb octahedron. The formation of these oxo-tert-butoxides is accompanied by evolution of isobutene. Addition of four equivalents of THF to 11 gives K4Sb2O(OtBu)(8) . 4 THF (12). X-ray diffraction studies reveal a cis arrangement of the Sb atoms in the central OSb2K4 unit. K4Sb2O2(OiPr)(12) (13) is obtained as the major product on heating KSb(OtBu)(4) and subsequent reaction with isopropyl alcohol. In the crystal structure, two oxygen-centred Sb2K2 tetrahedra (K-O 2.693(4) Angstrom, Sb-O = 1.982(5) Angstrom) linked through iPrO-K bonds (2.726(7)-2.738(7) Angstrom) are observed. In the reactions of KSb(OtBu)(4) (6) with the metal halides CaCl2, TlCl and CuI, a halide ion is transferred to potassium; this results in formation of potassium halide, the corresponding alkoxide and Sb(OtBu)(3).									53	0	0	0	0	0	53			0947-6539			WOS:A1995RW85700005

In this work, we examine the effect of light wavelength, not only for the HER to H2 in the presence of Na2S and Na2SO3, but also for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) without addition of any sacrifices. For the HER under a 365 and 420 nm LED lamp, the xm were 0.9 and 0.7, respectively. For the HER under a 330 and 395-515 nm cut-off xenon lamp, the xm were 0.7 and 0.5, respectively. For the ORR under a 420 nm cut-off halogen lamp, a maximum production of H2O2 was observed at x = 0.3. Furthermore, after 4% ZnCo2O4 loading, ZnxCd1_xS had an increased activity and stability, either for the HER or for the ORR. Through a (photo)electrochemical measurement, it is proposed that the photocatalytic activity of ZnxCd1_xS is determined by its light absorptivity and electron reactivity. The improved performance of n-type ZnxCd1_xS by p-type ZnCo2O4 is due to formation of a p-n junction, promoting the HER (ORR) on ZnxCd1_xS, and the sulfide (water) oxidation on ZnCo2O4. This work highlights that ZnxCd1-xS is a promising photocatalyst for H2 and H2O2 production, respectively.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The development of highly efficient, low cost metal-based electro-catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction during water electrolysis is necessary. Novel materials such as ternary metal sulphides are being projected as good candidates for hydrogen generation from water splitting due to the difference in electronic structures from the two metal components. Furthermore, morphological alteration to such ternary sulphides is expected make them much more efficient. The present work describes the synthesis of highly efficient ternary NiV2S4 nanosphere (NPs) with two different morphological structures and their electro-catalytic performance for water electrolysis by mploying the polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzer system. The characterization and morphological study of the synthesized NPs were carried out using Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and BET surface area analysis. The results of electrochemical measurement suggested that due to higher surface area in hierarchical structures of the ternary metal sulphide NiV2S4, its efficiency for producing hydrogen is higher in comparison to the solid NiV2S4 NPs containing smooth surfaces leading to the reduced surface area. This work will help in evaluating the ternary metal sulphides as electro-catalysts for hydrogen production with the help of electrochemical techniques. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

J	Schiff, J A								Pathways of assimilatory sulphate reduction in plants and microorganisms.								Ciba Foundation symposium					72			49	69						1979	1979	Assimilatory sulphate reduction, largely restricted to plants and microorganisms where it provides reduced sulphur for the formation of amino acids and proteins, nucleic acids, and various sulphur-containing coenzymes, begins with the activation of sulphate through reaction with ATP to form adenosine 5'-phosphosulphate (APS) and adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulphate (PAPS). Two pathways of assimilatory sulphate reduction are known. One, found in some blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) and in all oxygen-envolving eukaryotes, begins with APS where the sulpho group is transferred via APS sulphotransferase to a thiol acceptor (glutathione (G-S-) in Chlorella) to form the organic thiosulphate (G-S-SO-3). The organic thiosulphate appears to be reduced further by an organic thiosulphate reductase employing reduced ferredoxin to form G-S-S-. The terminal sulphur is then thought to be reductively transferred to O-acetylserine via O-acetylserine sulphydrase to form cysteine. A second pathway, found in bacteria and fungi, begins with PAPS where the sulpho group is transferred via PAPS sulphotransferase to an acceptor thiol to form an organic thiosulphate. Since thioredoxin is indispensable, this molecule may be the carrier or may serve to reduce the carrier. NADPH via thioredoxin reductase or glutathione and glutathione reductase reduces thioredoxin. These reactions release sulphite which is further reduced to sulphide by sulphite reductase, employing NADPH. Sulphide is then thought to react with O-acetylserine to form cysteine via O-acetylserine sulphydrase. The cellular location and evolution of these pathways is discussed.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0300-5208			MEDLINE:398767	398767

Precious or non-precious catalysts are typically loaded on high surface area carbon materials, and these supports play a critical role in both thermodynamics and kinetics of the HER. In this paper, we evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of a molecular hydrogen evolving catalyst, diacetyl-bis(4-methyl)-3-thiosemicarbazone Ni(ii) (Ni-ATSM), on three different carbon surfaces: glassy carbon, carbon paste and pencil graphite. The overpotential for each modified electrode was benchmarked at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2). Carbon paste electrodes showed highest overpotentials (495 mV) compared to the other electrode surfaces. Polished pencil and glassy carbon modified electrodes performed similarly (eta = 395 mV for GCE and eta = 400 mV for pencil). Pencil electrodes etched in acetone overnight prior to Ni-ATSM deposition produced lowest overpotentials (eta = 354 mV). Etching results in an increase in electroactive surface area and substantial decrease in the charge transfer resistance of the graphitic interface from 275 omega to 50 omega, verified using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Our studies demonstrate pencil graphite may serve as versatile, disposable, cost effective, and reproducible electrode surface for the evaluation of heterogeneous HER catalysts. Moreover, pencils can be easily cut with table saw to generate new surface for easy characterization of the surface such as electrochemistry, imaging and spectroscopy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000858349800001

Herein, we successfully fabricate ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets with in-situ interstitial zinc doping and short-range disordered structure (d(Zni)-ZIS) by one-step solvothermal method with magnetic stirring, which can realize overall water splitting without cocatalysts under visible light irradiation. In-situ interstitial Zn (Zn-i) doping can not only induce electrostatic potential difference to accelerate the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, but also broaden layer spacing and create short-range disordered structure in nanosheets. Moreover, the disordered regions possess abundant active sites and adjustable electronic configurations, which increase the surface carrier density and enable adequate charges for surface reaction. Consequently, the average photocatalytic H-2 and O-2 evolution rates of the resultant ultrathin d(Zni)-ZIS nanosheets achieve 42.8 and 19.1 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) under visible light irradiation, as well as an apparent quantum yield (AQE) of 1.51% at 420 nm without noble-metal cocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773524600003

We predict the reactivity of these highly oxophilic and reduced surface Ti species through density functional theory, where we calculate the adsorption of H2O on the root 5 x root 5)R26.6 degrees TiO2-Ti-3/5 reconstruction. H2O serves as the primary O source and oxidizing agent. We demonstrate that H2O oxidizes some of the Ti adatoms, shifting their occupied 3d states to the surface conduction band edge. We find that, due to the high concentration of reduced Ti species on the surface, a dissociative adsorption of water on the reconstructed surface can also lead to the formation of surface hydrides, which serve as a precursor for H-2 evolution. This suggests that the reconstructed surface may be an attractive single-phase hydrogen evolution catalyst.									24	1	0	0	1	0	24			1948-7185			WOS:000343067800026	26278454

J	Wincencjusz, H; Yocum, CF; van Gorkom, HJ								S-state dependence of chloride binding affinities and exchange dynamics in the intact and polypeptide-depleted O-2 evolving complex of photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				37	23			8595	8604		10.1021/bi972660v				JUN 9 1998	1998	The Cl- binding properties in the successive oxidation states of the O-2 evolving complex of photosystem II were investigated by measurements of UV absorbance changes, induced by a series of saturating flashes, that monitor manganese oxidation state transitions. In dark-adapted, intact photosystem II, Cl- can be replaced by NO3- in minutes, in an exchange reaction that depends on the NO3- concentration and that is not rate-limited by dissociation of Cl- from its binding site. Preillumination of dark-adapted photosystem II by one or two flashes accelerated the NO3- substitution reaction by an order of magnitude. A quantitative analysis of the Cl- concentration dependence of UV absorbance changes, measured in photosystem II preparations depleted of extrinsic 17 and 23 kDa polypeptides, shows that the Cl- binding properties of photosystem II change with the oxidation state of the oxygen evolving complex. Although the affinity for the individual S-states could not be determined with precision, it is shown that the affinity is an order of magnitude lower in the S-2 state than in the S-1 state. Comparison of the results obtained using intact photosystem II and preparations depleted of the 17 and 23 kDa extrinsic polypeptides suggests that these proteins constitute a diffusion barrier, which prevents fast equilibration of the Cl- binding site with the medium, but does not change the Cl- affinity of the binding site.									50	1	0	0	40	0	51			0006-2960			WOS:000074171800034	9622511

In the present work, novel heterojunctions composed of g-C3N4 nanosheets and Sr0.4H1.2Nb2O6 center dot H2O nanooctahedrons were constructed via a simple hydrothermal method. The as-prepared Sr0.4H1.2Nb2O6 center dot H2O/g-C3N4 (HSN/CN) heterojunction showed high photocatalytic activity in the water splitting reactions. Specially, it is found that the developed 20 wt%-HSN/CN heterojunction shows high water splitting activity with H-2 evolution rate up to 469.4 mu mol g(-1), which was much higher than that of bare CN. This enhanced photocatalytic activity for H-2 evolution can be mainly attributed to the matched energy level and heterojunction structure which could improve the photo-generated charge carriers separation and transfer. This work implies that construction of heterojunctions with a wide band gap semiconductor is a feasible strategy for enhancement of photocatalytic activity of CN materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The electrons required for CO2 reduction are extracted from water in a reaction driven by light-induced charge separations in the Photosystem II reaction center and catalyzed by the CaMn4O5-cluster. This cyclic process involves five redox intermediates known as the S-0-S-4 states. In this study, we quantify the flash-induced turnover efficiency of each S state by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Measurements were performed in photosystem II membrane preparations from spinach in the presence of an exogenous electron acceptor at selected temperatures between -10 degrees C and +20 degrees C and at flash frequencies of 1.25, 5 and 10 Hz. The results show that at optimal conditions the turnover efficiencies are limited by reactions occurring in the water oxidizing complex, allowing the extraction of their S state dependence and correlating low efficiencies to structural changes and chemical events during the reaction cycle. At temperatures 10 degrees C and below, the highest efficiency (i.e. lowest miss parameter) was found for the S-1 -> S-2 transition, while the S-2 -> S-3 transition was least efficient (highest miss parameter) over the whole temperature range. These electron paramagnetic resonance results were confirmed by measurements of flash-induced oxygen release patterns in thylakoid membranes and are explained on the basis of S state dependent structural changes at the CaMn4O5-cluster that were determined recently by femtosecond X-ray crystallography. Thereby, possible "molecular errors" connected to the e(-) transfer, H+ transfer, H2O binding and O-2 release are identified.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000823810200001	35974765

The cathodic deposition kinetics of Cu2O is investigated by varying Glu concentration, operation pH and temperature under pseudo-first-order conditions. The spontaneous endothermic deposition reaction is controlled by a coupled dehydration conversion from Glu to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF). The proposed cathodic deposition method has the merits of mild reaction condition, environment-friendly procedure, no requirement of applied voltage, and harvesting UV photons (P-in = 55 mu W cm(-2)) and chemical energy from 1.0 mol L-1 Glu/0.1 mol L-1 SO32- (298 K, pH 12) to produce open-circuit photovoltage (V-oc) of 1.121 V, short-circuit current density (i(sc)) of 0.25 mA cm(-2) and power conversion efficiency (eta = P-max/P-in) of 14.8%. Furthermore, the as-prepared Cu2O can act as cathode catalysts to improve remarkably the performances of photoelectrochemical Glu/O-2 fuel cells (298 K, pH 7) based on its photoelectrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of oxygen with the assistance of methylene blue (MB).

Herein, we report the crafting of hybrid electrocatalysts comprising both single atomic Ru (SA-Ru) and Ru nanoparticles (NPs) supported on porous N-doped carbon (PC), in which the electronic structures of SA-Ru were effectively optimized by nearby Ru NPs to achieve great enhancement of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The resulting SA-Ru/Ru NPs/PC displayed ultrahigh activity for HER in 1 M KOH with a mass activity of 4.2 mA mu g(Ru)(-1) at -0.07 V vs. RHE; this activity was 14 times that of commercial Pt/C, representing the largest reported value among the Pt-free electrocatalysts. In addition to the ultrahigh activity, the composite possessed the outstanding stability of 24 h and rapid HER kinetics (i.e. Tafel slope: 31.8 mV dec(-1)). The experimental and theoretical results matched well with each other and unambiguously indicated that the control over the electronic structures of SA-Ru and the advantageous PC support (i.e. its hierarchical porous nanostructures and superhydrophilic surface) jointly contributed to the exceptional performance.									21	3	0	0	2	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000482139000031

Nonetheless, the material obtained by this method exhibits considerable structural disorder and residual oxygen groups, and reports on their microscopic structure are quite scarce. We have investigated the structure and chemistry of graphene oxide samples reduced to different degrees using atomic force and scanning tunneling microscopy (AFM/STM) as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), respectively. TPD and XPS results indicate that reduction proceeds mainly by eliminating the most labile oxygen groups, which are ascribed to epoxides and hydroxyls on basal positions of the graphene plane. AFM/STM shows that the sheets are composed of buckled oxidized regions intermingled with flatter, non-oxidized ones, with the relative area of the latter increasing with the reduction degree.

Here we incorporate reaction energetics for CO2 reduction on Cu(111) and Cu(211) determined by DFT calculations in microkinetics simulations to predict the influence of surface topology, the presence of water and possible diffusion limitations on current density-potential curves and Faradaic efficiencies. A reaction-diffusion model was used that takes into account the effect of electrochemical potential on the stability of intermediates and associated activation barriers in proton-coupled electron transfer steps as well as diffusion of protons and CO2 from the bulk electrolyte to the electrode surface. The basic model can well reproduce hydrogen evolution including the effect of proton diffusion limitations and a shift of proton reduction (low potential) to water reduction (high potential). Considering CO2 electro-reduction, the stepped Cu(211) surface is more active than the Cu(111) terrace towards HCOO(H), CO and CH4. The presence of a catalytic H2O molecule increases the overall rate and selectivity to products (CO and CH4) derived from dissociated CO2. A catalytic H2O molecule facilitates the difficult electrochemical CO2 activation step to COOH and suppresses the competing activation step towards HCOO, which mainly yields HCOO(H). In general, the current densities increase at higher negative potential and the products follow the sequence CO2 -> CO -> CH4. That is to say, CO2 is converted to CO via COOH dissociation, followed by CO hydrogenation. Trendwise, the simulated product distribution follows the potential-dependent distribution observed in experiment. The low selectivity to CH3OH can be understood from the fast electrochemical steps that lead to CHx-OH dissociation. At high overpotentials the hydrogenation step from CO2 to COOH controls both activity and selectivity towards CH4. At high potential CO2 reduction becomes increasingly diffusion-limited, thus limiting the selectivity of CO2 reduction vs. hydrogen evolution. This aspect supports the need for better design of mass transfer in electrochemical reactors, which operate at high current density. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The efficiency of the applied oxidation processes (AOPs) has been estimated by the conversion of the original substrate (XENR and XCIP) and the reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC). Special emphasis was laid on the effect of varying reaction pH as well as of the applied oxidant doses on the observed reaction kinetics for each advanced oxidation processes. High degradation efficiencies, particularly in terms of rates of TOC and COD abatement, were obtained for photo-Fenton assisted ozonation [O3/UV/H2O2/Fe(II)], compared to other advanced oxidation processes. At pH 3 and 25 degrees C best results for the degradation of both investigated drugs were achieved when 10 mM H2O2, 0.5 mM Fe(II) and an initial dose of 8.5 mg L-1 ozone were applied.

Hydrogen is an appealing green energy source due to huge energy density, carbon free by products, renewable and storable nature. Water splitting is an exceedingly important technology for sustainable hydrogen generation. However, the process needs high-performance, stable, and low-cost catalyst for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure prove that the Pt is atomically dispersed in the Pt-Fe/N/C catalysts, leading to a high Pt utilization. The electrochemical results indicate that this Pt-Fe/N/C catalyst exhibits an excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, with a low overpotential of 51 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1), which are comparable with that of 20 wt % Pt/C. The enhanced performance can be ascribed to the intensive electron transfer between Pt atoms and the Fe and N co-doped substrate, resulting in an enhanced HER intrinsic activity. Furthermore, the Pt-Fe/N/C catalysts are applied as the cathode catalysts for water electrolysis, which exhibits an excellent performance of a low cell voltage of similar to 1.8 V at 1 A cm(-2) and a good stability for 100 h of continuous hydrogen production when the cathode Pt loading is reduced to only 4 mu g cm(-2). The study provides a general strategy to develop Pt atomically anchored electrocatalysts with low cost, high activity, and high stability.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000538758700004

A durable activity of Ni with Ni(OH)(2) was observed mainly on porous substrates, such as nickel foam or carbon cloth. Herein, we examined the effect of anodic oxidation on the HER using smooth samples of Ni, Ni with graphene, and Ni with C introduced by a low-temperature plasma treatment. Electrochemical measurements in 1.0 M KOH showed that a strong activation toward HER was achieved by voltammetric cycling to potentials of the formation of Ni3O4, Ni2O3, and/or NiO2. The presence of C enhanced this activation. The effect of C was explained by the accumulation of larger amounts of these products as a result of a deteriorated passivity, their higher compactness (demonstrated by higher impedance), and the longer durability under conditions of HER (revealed by a slower cathodic reduction). The durability of oxides in porous C structures can be explained by anodic potentials in pores owing to the ohmic potential drop. It is proposed that anodic oxidation might be used for the reactivation of Ni cathodes for water electrolysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-0216			WOS:000696501800024

Simultaneous Hydrogen Evolution and Lignin Depolymerization using NiSn Electrocatalysts in a Biomass-Depolarized Electrolyzer								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				167	4					043502	10.1149/1945-7111/ab7179				FEB 11 2020	2020	In this paper, we report on our efforts to evaluate NiSn as anode electrocatalysts for simultaneous hydrogen evolution and lignin depolymerization in a biomass-depolarized electrolyzer. Different ratios of NiSn alloys were synthesized through co-electrodeposition of Ni and Sn from a pyrophosphate plating bath. The composition and morphology of the electrocatalysts were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) techniques. Electrochemical measurements were carried out in a typical three electrode-cell system to evaluate electrocatalyst kinetics in 1.0 M NaOH solution. We evaluated the alloys as anode electrocatalysts in a flow-through biomass-depolarized electrolyzer. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) was employed to evaluate the production rates of vanillin as one of the main oxidation products. It was found that using NiSn20% electrode as the anode results in higher electrochemical reaction rates and potentially higher rate of aromatic products. (c) 2020 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

Plasma technology can realize surface etching and heteroatom doping, and generate highly dispersed components and redox species to increase the exposure of the active edge sites so as to improve the surface utilization and catalytic activity. This review summarizes the recent plasma-assisted preparation methods of noble metal catalysts, non-noble metal catalysts, non-metal catalysts, and other electrochemical catalysts, with emphasis on the characteristics of plasma-assisted methods. The influence of the morphology, structure, defect, dopant, and other factors on the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts is discussed.									19	1	0	0	0	0	20				2079-4991		WOS:000495666800091	31658708

The oxidation of CO molecules on the single Ir atom embedded graphdiyne (Ir-GDY) has been investigated by using the first-principles calculations. A variety of reaction mechanisms are taken into account and a new pathway is found to catalyze CO oxidation more efficiently on Ir-GDY. A comparison of the reaction energy barrier shows that the CO oxidation likely occurs in the new Eley-Rideal (NER) mechanism rather than the traditional mechanism. In the NER mechanism, the adsorbed O-2 molecule is activated by two physisorbed CO molecules thereby formed two CO2 synchronously with the energy barrier of 0.37 eV, as the rate-limiting step. In this reaction, the electrons are transferred' from the substrateto the O-2 and CO, which promotes the decomposition of O-2. After the C-C bond cleavage, the OOCCOO intermediate dissociates to form two CO2 molecules, in which the electrons return to the substrate and then start a new round of oxidation. We also found that the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (0.77 eV) and termolecular Eley-Rideal (0.70 eV) mechanisms are also likely to proceed. Therefore, the Ir-GDY is an efficient catalysis for CO oxidation.									68	6	0	0	3	0	68			1932-7447			WOS:000448087900027

Herein, Co@CoO core-shell heterostructures with a crystalline Co core and an amorphous CoO shell have been prepared using a simple solution reduction process and shown to be effective catalysts for the electro-oxidation of hydrazine in alkaline media. The synergistic effect between the crystalline metallic Co core and the amorphous CoO shell leads to a small onset potential of -1.10 V vs. Ag/AgCl. In addition, the Co@CoO electrode has been shown to exhibit good long-term catalytic stability.									21	1	0	0	1	0	21				2052-1537		WOS:000418622500009

Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)											10.1039/d2dt03160d				2022-Nov-03	2022	The poor kinetic background with the four-electron transfer of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was eradicated using a nickel-based catalyst, which was identified as an alternative to noble-metal catalysts. Here, we report the simple in situ formation of an earth-abundant nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) electrocatalyst for efficient OER in an alkaline medium. Electroless material preparation, namely, the direct modification of a gas diffusion layer (GDL) with a nickel salt, was studied, and the layered oxyhydroxide phase was found to influence the rate of the OER. Interestingly, complete OER studies were carried out without using any external binders; that is, the catalyst stabilized in an aqueous medium was directly exploited. The resulting in situ electrochemically tuned NiOOH@GDL shows a low overpotential of 294 mV to reach a current density of 20 mA cm-2, which is superior to most non-noble mono/bimetal oxides that have been studied as OER catalysts so far. The catalyst also shows better kinetics with a low Tafel slope value of 30 mV dec-1 for NiOOH@GDL-B. In addition, the stability of NiOOH@GDL-B was confirmed from a chronoamperometric study that was carried out for 30 h with no significant loss in activity. The electrochemical evolution of the materials was further scrutinized, and a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.1 * 10-4 s-1 was calculated at 300 mV. The consistency of the catalyst was proved with various post-OER characterization analyses, and it appears to be beneficial for developing an efficient electrocatalyst for OER in the near future.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1477-9234		MEDLINE:36326617	36326617

In this work, Mn(2)CoO(4 )nanoarray grown on carbon cloth (Mn2CoO4/CC) serves as a superior electrocatalyst for efficient NH3 synthesis by selective reduction of NO3-. When operated in 0.1 M PBS with 0.1 M NaNO3, Mn2CoO4/CC reaches a high Faraday efficiency of 98.6% and a large NH3 yield up to 11.19 mg/h/cm(2). Moreover, it exhibits excellent electrocatalytic stability. Theory calculations show that the Mn2CoO4 surface has strong interaction with NO3-, which can effectively inhibit the occurrence of hydrogen evolution, beneficial for NO3--to-NH3 conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000830058700001	35834395

While molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) is deemed as potential electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), growth of Mo2C with small particle size and uniform dispersion on carbon support remains a challenging endeavor, predominantly due to the requirement of high crystallization temperature (>= 750 degrees C). Herein, a molecular approach is demonstrated to modify the self-assembling of molybdenum on carbon nanotubes, steering a discrete nucleation and growth of Mo2C. Molybdenum reacts with oxalate forming molybdenum-oxalate, which presumably improves immobilization (through interaction between carbon surface and oxygen of oxalate) and increases the inter-molybdenum-distance (through steric hindrance). This oxalate assisted assembling of molybdenum inhibits the agglomeration and coalescence of Mo2C during growth. The as-prepared electrode exhibits a remarkable HER and stability with low onset and overpotential, and small Tafel slope. The high activity is rationalized in terms of size, dispersion, specific and electrochemically active surface area, electrical conductivity, interfacial charge transfer resistance, and turnover frequency. Effect of growth temperature and catalyst's mass on the performance is investigated, and how electrochemically active surface area, interfacial charge transfer resistance and performance vary with respect to molybdenum carbide contents is established.

J	Mola, EE; Irurzun, IM; Vicente, JL; King, DA								Mesoscopic pattern formation in catalytic processes by an extension of the mean field approach								SURFACE REVIEW AND LETTERS				10	1			23	38		10.1142/S0218625X03004585				FEB 2003	2003	For some years it has been known that a number of catalytic reactions, under specified steady operating conditions, exhibit oscillations, in the rate of product formation. These are often related to beautiful spatiotemporal patterns, including targets and spirals, on the metal surface.These examples of self-organizational phenomena have attracted considerable interest, because they are proving to be theoretically amenable.Here we review different approximations to model heterogeneous surface chemical reactions, which exhibit oscillatory behavior.A focal point is the use of a detailed knowledge of the dynamics of surface structural phase transition for modeling kinetic oscillations, which represent a severe test of our understanding of chemical processes at surfaces.Advantages and disadvantages of the Monte Carlo approach are presented to model heterogeneous oscillatory chemical reactions, with special emphasis if a Monte Carlo method is going to be applied to study the time evolution of a surface chemical reaction, as there should be a linear relationship between the time unit called the Monte Carlo step (MCS) and actual time. We conclude that special care must be taken when two or more processes are included in a simulation, because now overall MCS should be compatible with every individual process.The mean field approach (MFA) takes into account only reaction processes and completely neglects spatial correlation and fluctuations. Therefore, this approach is not adequate for describing the rich variety of spatial patterns that are experimentally observed. On the other hand, Monte Carlo approaches are severely limited by computational capabilities. To overcome MFA limitations we propose to extend the earlier work of King and coworkers [J. Chem. Phys. 100, 14417 (1996)], which did not include spatial dependence, by adding diffusion processes and gas global coupling to the coupled reaction equations.The extended MFA can now be used as a new tool for the analysis of pattern formation in surface chemistry.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			0218-625X	1793-6667		WOS:000182377900004		
J	Lovyagina, E. R.; Semin, B. K.								Competitive interaction of Mn(II) and Fe(II) cations with the high-affinity Mn-binding site of the photosystem II: evolutionary aspect								ORIGINS OF LIFE AND EVOLUTION OF BIOSPHERES				52	1-3			113	128		10.1007/s11084-022-09625-8		JUL 2022		SEP 2022	2022	The evolutionary origin of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in the photosystem II (PSII) is still unclear, as is the nature of electron source for the photosystem before the OEC had appeared. Johnson et al. (in PNAS 110:11238, 2013) speculated that Mn(II) cations were the source of electrons for transitional photosystems. However, Archean oceans also contained Fe(II) cations at concentrations comparable or higher than that of Mn(II). Fe(II) cations can bind to the high-affinity (HA) Mn-binding site in the OEC (Semin et al. in Biochemistry 41:5854, 2002). Now we have investigated the competitive interaction of Mn(II) and Fe(II) cations with the HA site in the Mn-depleted PSII membranes (PSII[-Mn]). Fe cations, oxidized under illumination, bind strongly to the HA site and, thus, prevent the interaction of Mn(II) with this site. If the Mn(II) and Fe(II) cations, at relatively equal concentration, are simultaneously present in the buffer, together with PSII(-Mn) membranes, there is competition between these two cations for the binding site, which manifests itself in partial inhibition of the Mn(II) oxidation and the blocking of the HA site by Fe(II) cations. If the concentration of Fe(II) cations is several times higher than the concentration of Mn(II), the HA site is completely blocked and the oxidation of Mn(II) cations is inhibited; under saturating light, the effectiveness of this inhibitory effect increases. This may be due to the generation of H2O2 on the acceptor side of the photosystem, which significantly accelerates the rate of the turnover reaction of Mn(II) on the HA site.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-6149	1573-0875		WOS:000824932000001	35796895

However, the sluggish process of H2O dissociation, as well as the accumulation of OH- around the active sites, seriously limit the alkaline HER performance. In this work, we developed a unique CoS2 needle array grown on a carbon cloth (NAs@C) electrode as an alkaline HER catalyst. Finite-element simulations revealed that CoS2 needle arrays (NAs) induce stronger local electric field (LEF) than CoS2 disordered needles (DNs). This LEF can greatly repel the local OH- around the active sites, and then promote the forward H2O dissociation process. The local pH changes of the electrode surface confirmed the lower OH- concentration and stronger local pseudo-acidic environment of NAs@C compared to those of DNs@C. As a result, the NAs@C catalyst exhibited a low HER overpotential of 121 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, with the Tafel slope of 59.87 mV dec(-1). This work provides a new insight into nanoneedle arrays for the alkaline HER by electric field-promoted H2O dissociation.									13	1	0	0	1	0	14			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000678168100001	34477634

However, pure-phase carbides suffer from mismatching hydrogen adsorption/desorption kinetics. Herein, Mo2C and VC nanoparticles are embedded in a three-dimensional (3D) graphitic carbon network (Mo2C/VC@C) via phase separation of V2MoO8 with NaHCO3 as the carbon source in a magnesiothermic reduction process. The Mo2C/VC heterojunction with abundant interfacial area and exposed active sites not only lead to moderate hydrogen adsorption energy and enhanced deasorption kinetics, but also facilitate efficient electron transfer. Moreover, the 3D carbon network provides high conductivity and structural support. The Mo2C/VC@C catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 122 mV at a current density of 10 mV cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 43.8 mV dec(-1) in addition to outstanding stability for over 10,000 cycles. Density-functional theory calculations reveal that the heterointerface of Mo2C/VC adjusts the electronic structures of Mo2C and VC and lowers the binding energy with hydrogen to enhance the HER performance. The concept, synthesis method, and materials properties described here provide insights into future development of high-efficiency HER catalysts for commercial water splitting.									89	7	0	0	3	0	90			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000467774100058

A rational design of cathode materials is an important step toward addressing these issues but faces a large challenge of simultaneous optimization for many design parameters such as Li2O2 decomposition reaction kinetics and charge transfer rate in different regions. In this work, two typical materials TiC and TiN are taken as examples to study the energy profiles of Li2O2 decomposition and charge transfer energies from Li(2)O(2)to cathode based on first-principles calculations and an electronic structure analysis. The electrochemical decomposition energies of Li2O2 on O-covered TiC and TiN surfaces make similar contributions to charge potentials (1.17-1.48 and 1.14-1.33 V), respectively. In contrast, interfacial charge transfer energies of 1.98 and 3.04 eV from Li2O2 to TiC and TiN, respectively, are significantly different. The calculated charge potentials of TiC (3.30-3.61 V) and TiN (4.33-4.52 V) are well consistent with experimentally measured values (3.5 and 4.5 V). The present study shows that interfacial charge transfer plays the key role in reducing charge overpotentials and should be considered in the calculation of charge potentials by the use of surface models.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000716453300019

Although soybean LOX1 was discovered more than 60 years ago, the structural biology of these enzymes was not studied until the mid 1990s. In 1993 the first crystal structure for a plant LOX was solved and following this protein biochemistry and molecular enzymology became major fields in LOX research. This review focuses on recent developments in molecular enzymology of LOXs and summarizes our current understanding of the structural basis of LOX catalysis. Various hypotheses explaining the reaction specificity of different isoforms are critically reviewed and their pros and cons briefly discussed. Moreover, we summarize the current knowledge of LOX evolution by profiling the existence of LOX-related genomic sequences in the three kingdoms of life. Such sequences are found in eukaryotes and bacteria but not in archaea.

In this work, the 2D NiFe-MOF-74 nanosheets directly growing on nickel foam (NF) are fabricated by a one-step solvothermal process without using annealing treatment. Remarkably, it is noted that thin layered MOF shape can be obtained by the collaboration of two metals, Ni and Fe which favors in maximum utilization of the active sites. Also, the electron environment of Ni and Fe, together with the conductivity of MOF-74 can be tuned by the cooperative effect of two metals. The optimized NiFe-MOF-74 electrode displays higher activity than that of a metal MOF-74 and the benchmarking catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which drives a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotentials of only 208 mV for OER and 195 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. More importantly, the morphology of NiFe-MOF-74 is nearly retained after 5000 cycles CV test for OER. The overall water splitting of as-prepared NiFe-MOF-74 electrode requires 1.58 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), making it as a promising bifunctional electrocatalysts for water-splitting system.

The progression of the fire past a given point in these simulations is divided into a preheating period and an active burning period. The preheating period is characterized by a slowly increasing radiative heating of the fuel that evaporates fuel moisture and raises the temperature of the fuel slightly and by weak convective cooling because the gases flowing over the heated solid fuel are still cooler than the fuel itself. The active burning period is characterized by the presence of a strong pulse of convective heating and continued radiative heating, accompanied by the development of large vertical velocities and a rapid increase in fuel temperature that causes the reaction rates to increase and the fuel to begin to burn, producing heat and increasing the rates of depletion of fuel and oxygen. In all simulations, the magnitude of the convective heat transfer is greater than that of the radiative heat transfer; however, these processes and their relationships to the three-dimensional structure and evolution of the fire are shown to depend both on the ambient wind speed and on the specific location along the fire front (e. g., at the head of the fire where the fire is spreading in the direction of the ambient wind, or on the flank of the fire where the fire is spreading in the direction almost perpendicular to the ambient wind).									38	0	0	0	12	0	38			2169-897X	2169-8996		WOS:000245017100005

In order to verify this concept, graphite particles (sp(2)) were deposited on diamond electrodes (sp(3)) by mechanical abrasion. The behavior of the so prepared diamond-graphite composite electrodes were compared with those of as-grown (BDDag) and those after mild anodic polarization (BDDmild).Outer-sphere electron transfer processes such as ferri/ferrocyanide (Fe(CN)(6)III/II) and inner-sphere charge transfer reactions such as 1.4-benzoquinone/hydroquinone (Q/H(2)Q) were chosen in order to investigate the electrochemical properties of these composite electrodes. Both redox systems became more reversible as the graphite (sp(2)) loading increased. A strong analogy existed between as-grown diamond electrodes and diamond-graphite composite electrodes.Finally a model is proposed which describes the BDD electrode surface as a diamond matrix in which non-diamond (sp(2)) impurity states are dispersed. These non-diamond sp(2) states on BDD surface acts as charge mediators for both inner-sphere and outersphere reactions.

However, their working feasibility at high temperatures has seldom been investigated. Herein, the working feasibility of high-temperature zinc-air batteries is systemically investigated. The effects of temperature on air cathode, zinc anode, and aqueous electrolyte are decoupled to identify the favorable and unfavorable factors. Specifically, parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction strengthens at high temperatures and leads to declined anode Faraday efficiency, which is identified as the main bottleneck. Moreover, zinc-air batteries demonstrate cycling feasibility at 80 degrees C. This work reveals the potential of zinc-air batteries to satisfy energy storage at high temperatures and guides further development of advanced batteries towards harsh working conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000820668300001	35679060

Two different varieties of mafic granulite exhibit slightly contrasting mineral assemblages. While the massive type of mafic granulite contains minerals assemblage orthopyroxene + clinopyroxene + plagioclase + magnetite + ilmenite + pyrite + pyrrhotite, the migmatitic variety contains garnet as an additional phase. Both oxide and sulphide minerals show contrasting textural characters. Textural analysis and construed mineral reactions imply that the variation of oxide-silicate, oxide-sulphide and sulphate relations is linked to variation of fO2 during the pre-peak, peak and post-peak stages of metamorphism. The calculated fO2 values range up to +4 log units relative to the QFM (quartz-fayalite-magnetite) buffer among the samples, except for one sample which shows lower values (-10 log units relative to the FMQ (fayalite-magnetite-quartz) buffer). The consistently high fO2 condition at the lower crust could result from several factors, but the role of the externally derived fluid appears to be plausible. Hot brine solution with CaCl2 species can explain the oxidation as well as local metasomatism of the mafic lower crust even though its presence is not verified from direct characterisation like fluid inclusion analysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2347-4327	0973-774X		WOS:000474569900001

Herein, we demonstrate that bimetallic MnMoO(4)can be a highly active and durable NRR catalyst. The developed MnMoO(4)nanorods-reduced graphene oxide presented a favorable combination of both high NH(3)yield (60.3 mu g h(-1)mg(-1)) and high faradaic efficiency (14.7%), surpassing nearly all of the previously reported Mn and Mo-based NRR catalysts.

However, the design of efficient catalytic sites is still limited to the trial-and-error stage, largely due to the lack of rational design principles. Here, we present a universal principle to evaluate HER catalytic activity of the various MoS2 structures such as TM-substitute, S-vacancy, Mo-edge, and S-edge, based on high-throughput first-principles calculations. We reveal that their catalytic activity has a fundamental relationship with the bonding characteristics of the local environment, such as valence electron number, bond electronegativity, and bond distance. Some catalytic activity predicted by the design principle is consistent with the available experimental data. The design principle elucidates the intrinsic nature of electrocatalysis is electron transfer capacity from a catalytic structure to a hydrogen atom. More importantly, the design principle based on MoS2 can be extended to other transition metal disulfides with the same valence electron amounts. Through the design principle, we find many possible catalysts such as Zn@S-vacancy@MoS2, Zn@Mo-edge@MoS2, Y@S-edge@MoS2, Zn/Ag@W-edge@WS2, Ru/Zn@substitute-W@WS2, and Pd@S-vacanay@WS2, which may achieve a highly efficient catalytic activity. These findings provide important insight toward understanding catalytic properties and serve as design principles for new catalysts.									27	1	0	0	1	0	27			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000513299400027

It represents a defense reaction of cells to damage that environmental forces inflict on macromolecules. Many aspects of the cellular stress response are not stressor specific because cells monitor stress based on macromolecular damage without regard to the type of stress that causes such damage. Cellular mechanisms activated by DNA damage and protein damage are interconnected and share common elements. Other cellular responses directed at re-establishing homeostasis are stressor specific and often activated in parallel to the cellular stress response. All organisms have stress proteins, and universally conserved stress proteins can be regarded as the minimal stress proteome. Functional analysis of the minimal stress proteome yields information about key aspects of the cellular stress response, including physiological mechanisms of sensing membrane lipid, protein, and DNA damage; redox sensing and regulation; cell cycle control; macromolecular stabilization/repair; and control of energy metabolism. In addition, cells can quantify stress and activate a death program (apoptosis) when tolerance limits are exceeded.									974	20	1	0	875	3	998			0066-4278	1545-1585		WOS:000228406800011	15709958

The drying step is found to be necessary to obtain a sample with small and uniformly sized Co-CoO nanoparticles. The calcination temperature has a great effect on the catalytic activity of the final product. Specifically, the sample prepared at the calcination temperature of 800 degrees C shows better catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Urea in the reaction mixture is crucial to obtain the sample with the uniformly sized Co-CoO nanoparticles and also plays an important role in improving the catalytic activity of the Co-CoO@NC/NC. Additionally, there exists a strong electronic interaction between the Co-CoO nanoparticles and the NC. Most interestingly, the Co-CoO@NC/NC is highly efficient for the ORR and can deliver an ORR onset potential of 0.961 V vs. RHE and a half-wave potential of 0.868 V vs. RHE. Both the onset and half-wave potentials are higher than those of most catalysts reported previously and even close to those of the commercial Pt/C (the ORR onset and half-wave potential of the Pt/C are 0.962 and 0.861 V vs. RHE, respectively). This, together with its high stability, strongly suggests that the Co-CoO@NC/NC could be used as an efficient catalyst for the ORR.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			2046-2069			WOS:000430536600035	35540762

Herein, metallic nanoparticulate-containing carbon nanofibers (MCNFs) featuring interior, nanoparticulate-in-pore structures were fabricated by taking advantage of cationic metal species/anionic surfactant complexes (MSCs). Binary MSC mixtures containing Fe-Co, Fe-Ni, and Co-Ni species were used to control not only the size/loading amount of the metallic phases but also the microstructural characteristics of the nanofiber matrices. Compared to their single MSC counterparts, the binary MSC mixtures allowed the generation of unique metallic phases, such as binary transition-metal oxides, and resulted in enhanced surface area/porosity and reduced charge transfer resistance. The noble-metal-free MCNFs were demonstrated as electrocatalysts for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The MCNFs prepared using binary combinations of Fe-Ni and Co-Ni, viz., FeNiCNFs and CoNiCNFs, showed outstanding performances for the OER and HER, respectively. For the OER particularly, at potentials exceeding 1.6 V (vs RHE), the FeNiCNFs showed higher current densities than that of the well-known, conventionally used electrocatalyst RuO2. For overall water splitting, an asymmetric FeNiCNF parallel to CoNiCNF cell rendered performance stability that was 15% better than that of the RuO2 parallel to Pt/C control cell. Based on the results of this study, various combinations of MSCs with controlled loading into functional matrices can be prepared to yield efficient, cost-effective electrocatalysts for water splitting.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2574-0970		WOS:000711030600107

Compound 1 displays a stair-like arrangement parallel to the b-axis, with the cobalt clusters arranged in a zigzag fashion, and contains small, honeycomb-like channels parallel to the c-axis. Compound 1 shows a remarkable activity for water oxidation and attains a current density of 1 mA.cm(-2) at low overpotential (eta = 257 mV) with a Tafel slope value of 80.5 mV.dec(-1). This high performance of 1 in catalysing the water oxidation reaction is attributed to its unique 3-D architecture. The results of electrochemical investigations, including long-term and controlled potential electrolysis, are anticipated to guide the forthcoming advancement in creating efficient, cheap and noble metal (Pt/Ru/lr) free catalysts for the water oxidation reaction.

Herein, we demonstrate that the water splitting efficiency of a photoanode can be further enhanced by introducing its photothermal effect. Under near-infrared radiation, the temperature of the NiCo2O4/BiVO4 photoanode increases moderately, leading to improved water oxidation kinetics and charge transport simultaneously. With the assistance of the photothermal effect, the obtained photoanode reaches a photocurrent density of 6.20 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode. A series of spinel-type MCo2O4 oxides (M = Mn, Zn, Cu, and Fe) are deposited on the surface of the BiVO4 photoanode to show similar photothermally enhanced PEC performance. The research discovery provides a way for improving the catalytic activity of photoanode materials with a photothermal effect, which may be applied to various fields of energy conversion, including CO2 reduction, N-2 fixation, and pollutant degradation.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000710924900055	34636240

As a proof, La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3-delta(LSFN) perovskite decorated with in situ exsolved Ni-Fe alloy nanoparticles is reported as electrode materials of SSOECs. XRD, SEM, TEM, and XPS characterizations prove the formation of Ni-Fe alloy. The as-prepared SSOECs deliver improved electrochemical performances for both steam electrolysis (50%H2O/50%H-2) and co-electrolysis (50%H2O/40%CO2/10%H-2), current densities of 0.64 and 0.67 A.cm(-)(2) are obtained at 1.3 V and 800 degrees C, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analysis show that the in situ formed Ni-Fe nano-particles can provide a new reaction path for water/hydrogen half-reaction, and electrochemical activity and kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be significantly enhanced by RP type perovskite oxide after reoxidation treatment. Moreover, the SSOECs successfully runs for 60 h at 1.2 V without obvious performance degradation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000843629300004

Electrochemical responses of the complexes were determined with voltammetric and in situ spectroelectrochemical measurements. Cobalt and mu-oxo manganese phthalocyanines (CoPc and mu-oxo MnPc) illustrated metal-based electron transfer reactions in addition to the Pc based reactions.-oxo-manganese phthalocyanine exhibited completely different redox properties than those of the monomeric manganese phthalocyanine. Thiazole substituents of the complexes caused oxidative electropolymerisation of the complexes on the working electrode. Electropolymerised-oxo manganese phthalocyanine catalyzed oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in basic aqueous solution. The ac behaviour of the tetrasubstituted metallophthalocyanines was studied by impedance spectroscopy technique over a temperature range of 300-450 K and frequency of 100 Hz-13 MHz. The results show that the new compounds exhibit abnormally high dielectric constants even at room temperature. It was concluded that Maxwell-Wagner polarisation is an appropriate model to explain the behaviour of the dielectric function at low frequencies. Frequency dependent measurements revealed that the compounds exhibits non-Debye type relaxation behaviour. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

SO2 reacts with the bare supports to form mainly sulfite species at 200 degrees C and mainly sulfate species at 400 degrees C. For Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/CeO2, the reaction with SO2 produces additionally sulfide species on the platinum surface. Pt/Al2O3 reacts with the SO2 + O-2 mixture to yield the sulfide and sulfate species in comparable amounts at <= 200 degrees C, whereas sulfates become the main product at higher temperatures (300-400 degrees C). The addition of oxygen to the Pt/CeO2 + SO2 system almost completely suppresses the formation of sulfide species and increases the yield of sulfate. The reduction of ceria accompanies the formation of sulfate; both processes proceed to a greater extent in the presence of supported platinum. To confirm the identification of surface species, the reactions of SO2 and SO2 + O-2 with a Pt(111) single crystal were studied as well.									35	2	0	0	3	0	37			1932-7447			WOS:000342396300042

The extraordinary variability and richness of their structures afford engineering synergies between the metal nodes, functional linkers, encapsulated substrates, or nanoparticles for multiple and selective heterogeneous interactions and activations in these MOF-based nanocatalysts. Pyrolysis of MOF-nanoparticle composites forms highly porous N- or P-doped graphitized MOF-derived nanomaterials that are increasingly used as efficient catalysts especially in electro- and photocatalysis. This review first briefly summarizes this background of MOF nanoparticle catalysis and then comprehensively reviews the fast-growing literature reported during the last years. The major parts are catalysis of organic and molecular reactions, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and views of prospects. Major challenges of our society are addressed using these well-defined heterogeneous catalysts in the fields of synthesis, energy, and environment. In spite of the many achievements, enormous progress is still necessary to improve our understanding of the processes involved beyond the proof-of-concept, particularly for selective methane oxidation, hydrogen production, water splitting, CO2 reduction to methanol, nitrogen fixation, and water depollution.									827	35	3	0	81	1	835			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000509426800018	31246430

The original two-parameter Kok model was subsequently extended in its level of complexity to better simulate diverse data sets, including intact cells and isolated PSII-WOCs, but at the expense of introducing physically unrealistic assumptions necessary to enable numerical solutions. To date, analytical solutions have been found only for symmetric Kok models (inefficiencies are equally probable for all intermediates, called "S-states"). However, it is widely accepted that S-state reaction steps are not identical and some are not reversible (by thermodynamic restraints) thereby causing asymmetric cycles. We have developed a mathematically more rigorous foundation that eliminates unphysical assumptions known to be in conflict with experiments and adopts a new experimental constraint on solutions. This new algorithm termed STEAMM for S-state Transition Eigenvalues of Asymmetric Markov Models enables solutions to models having fewer adjustable parameters and uses automated fitting to experimental data sets, yielding higher accuracy and precision than the classic Kok or extended Kok models. This new tool provides a general mathematical framework for analyzing damped oscillations arising from any cycle period using any appropriate Markov model, regardless of symmetry. We illustrate applications of STEAMM that better describe the intrinsic inefficiencies for photon-to-charge conversion within PSII-WOCs that are responsible for damped period-four and period-two oscillations of flash O-2 yields across diverse species, while using simpler Markov models free from unrealistic assumptions.

Herein, a novel direct Z-scheme heterojunction with a coherent interface has been presented for the first time. Specifically, the heterojunction was constructed by dispersing pre-prepared BiVO4 crystals into the reaction system to synthesize Cu3SnS4, followed by a hydrothermal reaction. It is shown that Cu3SnS4 was deposited on the surface of each pre-prepared BiVO4 crystal as a thin layer via heterogeneous nucleation to acquire a core-shell heterojunction. The BiVO4@Cu3SnS4 heterojunction was found to possess an atomic coherent interface, which is formed through the bonding between the (121) plane of BiVO4 and the (112) plane of Cu3SnS4, originating from the matching in the crystalline lattice between the two planes. The coherent interface facilitated the charge transfer from Cu3SnS4 to BiVO4 owing to the difference in their Fermi levels, thereby forming a built-in electric field pointing from Cu3SnS4 to BiVO4. Reduced fluorescence emission and a shortened carrier lifetime reveal an obvious reduction in the inter-band charge recombination for the optimal BVO@CTS-0.19 sample. Consequently, BVO@CTS-0.19 shows remarkably enhanced photocatalytic performance in MO degradation, Cr6+ reduction and oxygen evolution. The Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism for BVO@CTS-0.19 was verified by a suite of techniques. This work provides a universal strategy for building a coherent interface to develop high-performance direct Z-scheme heterojunctions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000834551200001	35912901

These tools efficiently compare and provide a global evaluation of catalyst performance while highlighting the limitations for a given reaction. In the framework of solid-state water oxidation, a minimal overpotential of 0.4 eV has been predicted on the basis of LFESRs. Considering the very different nature of homogeneous catalysts compared to solid-state systems, the validity of scaling relationships determined for the former cannot be assumed. To evaluate the global limitations of molecular O-2 evolution catalysts, LFESRs are established for all key intermediates for different metal (Mn, Co, Ru, Rh, Ir) and ligand (corrole and perfluoro-porphyrin) combinations assuming a mononuclear mechanism that proceeds through *=OH, *=O, and *-OOH intermediates. Our computations indicate that the LFESRs strongly depend on the choice of density functional. Using GMC-QDPT2 as a benchmark, strong scaling relationships between all intermediates are observed, but the relationships between *-OH and *=O significantly differ from those found in solid-state systems. Consequently, the shape of the molecular volcano plot changes drastically from its solid-state counterpart and shows a broad plateau at the top where the overpotential is nearly independent of the choice of catalyst. This plateau renders the performance of molecular catalysts extremely robust, but inhibits improvements by proceeding through alternative reaction mechanisms.									31	1	0	0	1	0	31			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000435611900031

The high cost of Pt-based catalysts forces researchers to develop alternative electrocatalysts. Here, a simple strategy has been proposed to synthesize a metal-free electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by high-temperature annealing of graphene oxide-coated melamine foam. The prepared catalyst possesses both structural and functional advantages with its three-dimensional (3D) interconnected arms of carbon nitride (CNx) backbone wrapped with nitrogen-doped graphene (N-RGO) sheets (CNx@N-RGO). CNx@N-RGO faces only a 193 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10mAcm(-2), which is far superior to the previously reported Pt-free systems. Along with the high exchange current density 34.7 x 10(-6)A cm(-2) and low Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1), CNx@N-RGO follows a Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for the HER. DFT calculations show that the synergy between CNx and N-RGO facilitates good electrical coupling between the two moieties and provides optimal binding to H+ ions on the catalyst that, in turn, results in efficient reduction of hydrogen ions.									25	1	0	0	1	0	26			2196-0216			WOS:000412892600031

The model accounted for the fuel devolatilization, moisture evaporation, heterogeneous reaction as well as homogeneous reactions integrated with the heat and mass transfer from the fluidized bed environment to the coal particle. This model was validated by comparing the model prediction with the experimental results in the literature, and a satisfactory agreement between modeling and experiments proved the reliability of the model. The modeling results demonstrated that the carbon conversion rate of a single coal particle (diameter 6 to 8 mm) under fluidized bed conditions (bed temperature 1088 K) in an O-2/CO2(30:70) atmosphere was promoted by the gasification reaction, which was considerably greater than that in the O-2/N-2(30:70) atmosphere. In addition, the surface and center temperatures of the particle evolved similarly, no matter it is under the O-2/N(2)condition or the O-2/CO(2)condition. A further analysis indicated that similar trends of the temperature evolution under different atmospheres were caused by the fact that the strong heat transfer under the fluidized bed condition overwhelmingly dominated the temperature evolution rather than the heat release of the chemical reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2095-1701	2095-1698		WOS:000550598500001

Herein, a novel hybrid electrocatalyst comprising fullerene quantum dot (FQD)-decorated CoNi layered double hydroxides (CoNi-LDH) nanosheet arrays anchored on porous Ni foam (NF) is elaborately fabricated. Beneficial from the synergetic effect between FQD and CoNi-LDH, the obtained FQD/CoNi-LDH/NF exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution as well as urea oxidation under ambient atmosphere. Impressively, to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), it requires cell voltages of only 1.59 and 1.45 V for overall water and urea electrolysis, respectively, in a two-electrode electrolyzer consisting of FQD/CoNi-LDH/NF as both anode and cathode. Furthermore, this catalyst also displays outstanding reaction kinetics and favorable catalytic stability. Both experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results demonstrate that the charge transfer from FQD to CoNi-LDH could account for the excellent catalytic performance of the newly-synthesized catalyst, and the decorated FQD finely modulates the electronic structure of CoNi-LDH, favoring the adsorption of active hydrogen atom, and thus promote the catalytic process. The present work would provide useful guidance for designing and developing multifunctional and efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production.									75	5	0	0	10	0	76			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000522640100024

Herein, we report a novel confinement strategy for preparing well-dispersed octahedral CoS2 nanocrystals through in situ sulfidization of the carbon fibre-wrapped Co nanoparticles, in order to fully expose the active sites of every nanocatalytic unit. The successful synthesis of the material includes three main steps: (i) electrospinning synthesis of Co ion-containing polyacrylonitrile fibres (Co2+-PANF), (ii) thermal conversion of the Co2+-PANF at 900 degrees C under N-2 atmosphere into a Co-embedded carbon fibre network (Co-CFN), and (iii) direct sulfidization of Co-CFN using sublimed sulphur, leading to the confinement growth of CoS2 nano-octahedra on CFN. Furthermore, this material, denoted as CoS2-CFN, can serve as a highly active, stable, non-noble metal electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic medium. This material generates a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 136 mV with about 100% Faradaic yield and maintains its catalytic activity for at least 20 hours. The excellent catalytic properties of CoS2-CFN are attributed primarily to the synergistic effects of the intrinsic catalytic ability of CoS2, the well-dispersed CoS2 nanocrystals as the catalytically active phase, as well as the high conductivity and porous structure of the carbon fibre network as a support material.									52	1	0	0	1	0	53			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000378276300051

Herein, a microdroplet flow reaction is used for ultrafast and continuous synthesis of a nickel metal-organic framework material with 4,4'-bipyridine and phosphonate ligands. A one step pyrolysis of this metal-organic framework to various heat treatment temperatures and hold times at maximum temperature give a range of electrocatalysts, containing crystalline Ni2P nanoparticles dispersed in a porous carbonaceous matrix incorporating relatively high concentrations of both nitrogen and phosphorus derived from the original metaleorganic framework. The Ni2P electrocatalysts inherite the morphology of the metal-organic framework precursor, have a uniform dispersion of Ni2P sites and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas in the range 558-754 m(2) g(-1). The Ni2P electrocatalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in 1.0 M KOH and an electrolyzer using Ni2P electrocatalysts as both cathode and anode generates a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.62 V with superior durability. This facile and scalable synthesis strategy for the rational design of electrocatalysts represents a proof-of-concept with the potential for scale-up for use in practical applications.

Herein, we report a one-step strategy for the fabrication of versatile silver nanomaterials. Tailored structures, such as nanobelts, nanowires, and nanocables, were conveniently synthesized by adjusting the reaction conditions. The novelty of this synthesis is in a one-pot procedure that combines the sequential formation of precursor nucleation, in situ polymerization, and crystal shaping under mild conditions. The as-synthesized cables consisted of a metallic core (Ag) and an organic outer shell (poly(o-anisidine), POA). Control experiments demonstrated that the introduced organic monomer (OA) not only acted as the nanoreactor and capping agent, but also a modest reducer for controlled crystal growth at the hydrophilic interface. Electrocatalytic tests showed enhanced stability and activity towards the reduction of oxygen, which was believed to be closely associated with the coreshell structural characteristics of the nanomaterials. Their electrocatalytic performance and tunable structure makes such silver nanobelts promising candidates for applications in catalysis and as sensors in nanoelectrochemical devices.									32	2	0	0	5	0	33			0947-6539			WOS:000303497100030	22454266

The working electrode was a 20 nm thick gold film thermally coated on the outside of an inner 3 mm glass tube. An underlayer consisting of (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxy-silane was coated on the glass surface in order to improve its adhesion to gold. Tests showed prolonged life of the gold film. Details of the design and construction of the ECNMR cell are described. The ECNMR cell could be routinely used in a multi-user service high-resolution NMR instrument under oxygen-free conditions in both aqueous and non-aqueous solvents. Different approaches were applied to suppress the noise transmitted between the potentiostat and the NMR spectrometer. These approaches were shown to be effective in reducing background noise in the NMR spectra. The electrochemical and NMR performance of the ECNMR cell is presented. The reduction of 1,4-benzoquinone in both aqueous and non-aqueous solvents was used for testing. The evolution of the in situ ECNMR spectra with time demonstrated that use of the ECNMR cell was feasible. Studies of caffeic acid and 9-chloroanthracene using this ECNMR cell were undertaken to explore its applications, such as monitoring reactions and studying their reaction mechanisms.

In this approach, the dispersion of bulk MoS2 in the aqueous phase was increased with a surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate), which reduced the exfoliation time and enhanced the exfoliation ability to produce layered MoS2 nanosheets. During the hydrothermal treatment, the nanosheets were further scissored into small nanocrystals. Nanocrystals have attractive properties with stable dispersion and high-water solubility. Our method provides a scalable, eco-friendly, easy, and low-cost strategy for designing other HER catalysts. Such ultra-small MoS2 nanocrystals with rich Mo vacancies were used as catalysts for HER, which showed excellent electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential (95 mV) and small Tafel slope (41 mV/dec) in 0.5M H2SO4 electrolyte. The design and synthesis of the HER catalyst in this work presents a promising path for preparing active and stable electrocatalysts to replace costly metal-based catalysts for hydrogen production.

Herein, we report a facile route for the controllable orientation-dependent crystal growth of {(1) over bar 20) high-index faceted dendritic hexagonal NiCx nanosheets on Ni-coated copper foil, with an optimized carbon content of 16.7 at%, by a mild electrodeposition approach. Impressively, the as-prepared material (denoted as d-NiC0.2NS/Ni/CF) shows remarkable catalytic activity (with overpotentials of 121 mV and 228 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER, respectively), simultaneously giving a nearly 100% faradaic yield and affording superior catalytic stability (beyond 100 h) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the HER and OER in basic media. The achieved ultrahigh catalytic performance of d-NiC0.2NS/Ni/CF is primarily attributed to its dendritic nanosheet morphology, optimized 16.7 at% carbon content, and fully exposed {(1) over bar 20} high-index facets, which lead to improved mass/electron transport capability and fully exposed active sites. In comparison with the other non-noble-metal electrocatalysts developed to date, we provide a controllable and mild strategy to fabricate high-performance nickel-carbide-based electrocatalysts for advanced applications.									44	3	0	0	0	0	44			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000390083200034

However, the feasibility of self-driven water splitting is limited by inefficient connections between functional modules, lack of highly active and stable electrocatalysts, and intermittent and unpredictable renewable energy supply. Herein, we construct a dual-modulated three-dimensional (3D) NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 (denoted as NCONCS) heterostructure deposited on nickel foam as a multifunctional electrode for electrocatalytic water splitting driven by photovoltaic-powered supercapacitors. Due to a stable 3D architecture configuration, abundant active sites, efficient charge transfer, and tuned interface properties, the NCONCS delivers a high specific capacity and rate performance for supercapacitors. A two-electrode electrolyzer assembled with the NCONCS as both the anode and the cathode only requires a low cell voltage of 1.47 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte, which outperforms the state-of-the-art bifunctional electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations suggest that the generated heterointerfaces in NCONCS improve the surface binding capability of reaction intermediates while regulating the local electronic structures, which thus accelerates the reaction kinetics of water electrolysis. As a proof of concept, an integrated configuration comprising a two-electrode electrolyzer driven by two series-connected supercapacitors charged by a solar cell delivers a high product yield with superior durability.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2637-9368		WOS:000804602100001

In-situ photocatalytic generation of H2O2 for Fenton-degradation is a promising way to remove pollutants.Methods: ZnSe nanosheets was obtained via a simple one-step solvothermal method using diethylenetriamine, hydrazine hydrate and water as reaction medium. Significant Findings: ZnSe tends to produce H2O2 under 300 W Xenon light irradiation, which then participates in Fenton reaction with the assistance of Fe2+ to generate active hydroxyl radical for degradation of dyes and antibiotics, leading to the photocatalytic H2O2 evolution rate decreases from 241 mmol.L - 1.h - 1 in pure water to 190 mmol.L - 1.h - 1 in Fe2+-contained solution. The photo-Fenton degradation rate of Methylene blue (MB), Tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH), Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is better than those of corresponding photocatalytic process and Fenton process alone, this is mainly attributed to the continuous generation and activation of H2O2 in the presence of ZnSe and Fe2+based on a series of trapping experiments and related analysis. Besides, ZnSe also displays excellent stability and hydrophilicity in Fe2+-contained solution, which is benefit to the contact of catalyst and pollutants. Further investigation shows the kinetic of photo-Fenton degradation over ZnSe follows the pseudo-first-order kinetic. (c) 2022 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Cobalt phosphate (CoPi)-based catalysts belong to the relevant class of nonprecious electrocatalysts studied for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, an in-depth investigation of the electrochemical activation of CoPi-based electrocatalysts by cyclic voltammetry (CV) is presented. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is adopted because it enables the synthesis of CoPi films with cobalt-to-phosphorous ratios between 1.4 and 1.9. It is shown that the pristine chemical composition of the CoPi film strongly influences its OER activity in the early stages of the activation process as well as after prolonged exposure to the electrolyte. The best performing CoPi catalyst, displaying a current density of 3.9 mA cm(-2) at 1.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and a Tafel slope of 155 mV/dec at pH 8.0, is selected for an in-depth study of the evolution of its electrochemical properties, chemical composition, and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) during the activation process. Upon the increase of the number of CV cycles, the OER performance increases, in parallel with the development of a noncatalytic wave in the CV scan, which points out to the reversible oxidation of Co2+ species to Co3+ species. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Rutherford backscattering measurements indicate that phosphorous progressively leaches out the CoPi film bulk upon prolonged exposure to the electrolyte. In parallel, the ECSA of the films increases by up to a factor of 40, depending on the initial stoichiometry. The ECSA of the activated CoPi films shows a universal linear correlation with the OER activity for the whole range of CoPi chemical composition. It can be concluded that the adoption of ALD in CoPi-based electrocatalysis enables, next to the well-established control over film growth and properties, to disclose the mechanisms behind the CoPi electrocatalyst activation.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000626844200029	33842021

The morphological and electrochemical properties and chemical composition of the as-synthesized BGNS-MnO2 composite (MnO2@BGNS) were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, linear sweep voltammetry and a rotating disk electrode (RDE). The as-prepared BGNS-MnO2-modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) displayed excellent catalytic activity towards the ORR in an alkaline medium compared to pure MnO2 and pure BGNSs. In addition, the hybrid electrode exhibited superior electrocatalytic stability and preferable methanol tolerance compared to commercial platinum electrocatalysts in alkaline media. This is due to the synergistic effect between the excellent catalytic activity of the MnO2 nanotubes and the large surface area and high conductivity of BGNSs. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations show a strong binding energy between BGNSs and MnO2 in the form of strong electrostatic interaction and inter charge transfer. The enhanced reactivity of MnO2@BGNS is due to the strong bonding between the boron (BGNSs) and oxygen (MnO2). Moreover, the electron density difference and partial density of states (PDOS) analysis suggest that the electron transfer capability of B-O bonding is stronger than that of C-O bonding. Finally, we conclude that boron doping of graphene is an effective strategy for fabricating efficient ORR catalysts.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2398-4902			WOS:000528920000022		
J	Ferralis, Nicola; Carraro, Carlo								Evolution of interfacial intercalation chemistry on epitaxial graphene/SiC by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				320				441	447		10.1016/j.apsusc.2014.09.096				NOV 30 2014	2014	A rapid and facile evaluation of the effects of physical and chemical processes on the interfacial layer between epitaxial graphene monolayers on SiC(0 0 0 1) surfaces is essential for applications in electronics, photonics, and optoelectronics. Here, the evolution of the atomic scale epitaxial graphene-buffer-layer-SiC interface through hydrogen intercalation, thermal annealings, UV-ozone etching and oxygen exposure is studied by means of single microparticle mediated surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (smSERS). The evolution of the interfacial chemistry in the buffer layer is monitored through the Raman band at 2132 cm(-1) corresponding to the Si H stretch mode. Graphene quality is monitored directly by the selectively enhanced Raman signal of graphene compared to the SiC substrate signal. Through smSERS, a simultaneous correlation between optimized hydrogen intercalation in epitaxial graphene/SiC and an increase in graphene quality is uncovered. Following UV-ozone treatment, a fully hydrogen passivated interface is retained, while a moderate degradation in the quality of the hydrogen intercalated quasi-freestanding graphene is observed. While hydrogen intercalated defect free quasi-freestanding graphene is expected to be robust upon UV-ozone, thermal annealing, and oxygen exposure, ozonolytic reactivity at the edges of H-intercalated defected graphene results in enhanced amorphization of the quasi-freestanding (compared to non-intercalated) graphene, leading ultimately to its complete etching.

However, the theoretical energy density of most layered oxide cathodes is limited as their charge compensation process relies solely on the cationic redox of transition-metal (TM) ions. To break this shackle, anionic redox has emerged as a lever to improve the energy density of layered oxides. Herein, a systematic overview of the latest progresses on anionic-redox-active layered oxide cathodes is presented, with focus on the mechanism studies of anionic redox reaction. The practical challenges of anion redox in layered oxides are also summarized, and the possible solutions are suggested. In contrast to the Li-ion system, anion redox activity is uncovered for both Na-rich and Na-deficient layered oxides, and their underlying anionic reaction mechanisms exhibit many discrepancies. Moreover, the promise of utilizing sole anionic redox in NIBs with earth-abundant and low-cost elements is also considerable. This overview could provide robust guidance for further development of high-energy layered oxide cathodes with anionic redox activity. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Adsorption of CO occurs only molecularly. By contrast, exposures of up to 0.8 L of NO undergo complete dissociation. This is evidenced by the evolution of only N2 and O2 in TPD spectra. The reaction between NO and CO is found to proceed steadily only at temperatures above 670 K, i.e., after completion of N2 thermal desorption. Under isothermal conditions, but only above 670 K and under a constant flow of the reactants (flow ratio CO/NO approximately 10:1), a hysteresis-like behaviour in the CO2 production may be observed. Rate oscillations have been found at unusually high temperatures, i.e., above 900 K. Periods in the oscillating CO2 production are in the range of 5-20 min and coincide with electronic change at the surface as indicated by work-function measurements. The feedback process probably involves different states of oxygen which is dissociatively chemisorbed at the surface or absorbed beneath. These states have been characterized by TPD spectra after high exposures of pure O2 or NO to Rh{110}.									58	0	1	0	0	0	59			0039-6028			WOS:A1992HW92400080

Chloride anions proved to be essential to prevent chelate complexation of the second amino acid. Upon exchange of sodium by other alkali- or alkaline-earth elements, peptide formation is still observed. The dipeptide yields are mainly determined by two factors: on the one hand the pH of the solution should be below 3 to prevent Cu(II)-catalysed peptide hydrolysis and give an optimum species distribution for peptide formation, and above 2 to keep proton-catalysed peptide hydrolysis as low as possible; on the other hand by the concentration of the inorganic salt for removing water from the reaction and thus shifting the equilibrium towards the peptide side. The hydration enthalpies of the cations are the determining factor for the initial rate of peptide formation and lead to the series Mg2+ > Ca2+ > Ba2+> Na+ > NH4+ > K+ > Cs+. In the long run the initial advantage of divalent cations is overruled by stronger hydrolysis due to the lower pH of their solutions. The ion NH4+ is a typical, apparently due to its buffering ability.									22	0	0	0	6	0	22			1472-7773			WOS:A1994NF44800024

Nickel silicide formation by reaction of filament evaporated nickel with silicon substrate								Microelectronics Journal				17	6			24	9		10.1016/S0026-2692(86)80161-6				Nov.-Dec. 1986	1986	Nickel silicide formation by reaction of tungsten filament evaporated nickel film with silicon substrate in flowing commercial nitrogen at temperatures in the range of 400 to 900degC has been investigated. The oxygen contained in the nickel film and in the nitrogen gas is found to greatly slow down/inhibit the silicidation process. The silicidation is found to restart only after removing the impurities chemically and subjecting the wafers once again to the annealing schedule as before. The sheet resistance is observed to decrease with increase of annealing temperature and time. This is attributed to the evolution of different silicide phases during annealing. The barrier height is found not to depend on silicide phases indicating that the reaction between silicon and nickel occurs during deposition at room temperature. A thin layer of SiO2 is also observed to grow on top of nickel silicide. Various applications to VLSI are indicated.									4	0	0		0	0	4			0026-2692			INSPEC:2863597

Although WO3 has demonstrated oxygen-evolution capability in PEC, further increase of its PEC efficiency is limited by high recombination rate of photogenerated electron/hole carriers and slow charge transfer at the liquid-solid interface. To further increase the PEC efficiency of the WO3 photocatalyst, designing WO3 nanocomposites via surface-interface engineering and doping would be a great strategy to enhance the PEC performance via improving charge separation. This review starts with the basic principle of water-splitting and physical chemistry properties of WO3, that extends to various strategies to produce binary/ternary nanocomposites for PEC, particulate photocatalysts, Z-schemes and tandem-cell applications. The effect of PEC crystalline structure and nanomorphologies on efficiency are included. For both binary and ternary WO3 nanocomposite systems, the PEC performance under different conditions-including synthesis approaches, various electrolytes, morphologies and applied bias-are summarized. At the end of the review, a conclusion and outlook section concluded the WO3 photocatalyst-based system with an overview of WO3 and their nanocomposites for photocatalytic applications and provided the readers with potential research directions.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18				2079-4991		WOS:000581235400001	32962035

Here, we report atomically dispersed cobalt on nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene (N-Co-S/G) for HER. Remarkably, the prepared N-Co-S/G electrocatalyst shows a small overpotential of 67.7 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and exceptional durability over 100 h at 10 mA cm(-2) under acidic conditions. Moreover, we found that the HER activity of N-Co-S/G is close to 20% Pt/C at all pH levels (0-14) and superior activity at high current density (>100 mA cm(-2)). Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the S atom in N-Co-S/G form Co-S bond, resulting new Co-N3S1 active site, which optimizes Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H)*) close to zero, while water adsorption and dissociation enhanced by S modulation for neutral and basic media HER.									17	2	0	0	1	0	18			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000618010600004

The study uses density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine thermodynamics and reaction mechanisms of elementary reactions, and the ratings concept is introduced previously as an evaluation tool for the dry reforming reaction of methane (DRR) catalyst. The results for carbon atom adsorption strength and activation energy of higher coke formation (2C* reversible arrow C-C* + *) suggest that on metallic surfaces, coke formation would be easy on the (111) facet but suppressed on the (100). Likewise, the carbide surface exposing metal atoms strongly binds to carbon and easily forms higher coke. In contrast, the oxide of Ni exhibits coke-resistant properties as it weakly adsorbs carbon. Finally, a ternary contour plot featuring metallic/oxide/carbide phases of Ni on the (111) facet was employed for identifying surface compositions, yielding highly reactive and stable DRR catalysts through a microkinetics model. It is found that, to become coke-resistant, the surface should contain less than 10% of carbide, whereas more than 75% of metallic surface is needed for the catalyst to be out of the coke formation zone, and to enter the coke removal zone, up to 80% of the metallic surface is required.									16	0	0	0	3	0	16			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000526324100080

While non-noble metal catalysts are highly promising for real-world DRM applications, they often sillier from deactivation due to sintering and carbon deposition. In this study, ultraline bimetallic NiCo nanoparticles encapsulated in silicalite-2 (S-2) were prepared via an in situ growth method. Density functional theory in combination with microkinetic modeling was used to understand the influence of the alloy on reaction kinetics and the resistance to carbon deposition. Elemental segregation was observed during the activation stage, wherein the Ni and Co atoms migrated toward the outer surface and center of the NiCo alloy, respectively. Subsequently, the Ni0.2Co0.3@S-2 catalyst prepared using the optimized Ni/Co ratio showed stable and high CH4 and CO2 conversions for 100 h with no carbon deposition. The confinement effect together with precisely balancing the carbon and oxygen content on the surface of the catalyst contributed to its high catalyst performance. This work is expected to provide relevant guidance for studying the evolution of catalyst structures via material dynamics elucidation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000791836500014

MnO2 electrode satisfies the requirements of DSA, and has a good cycle life and a low overpotential for oxygen evolution. MnO2 electrodes based on Ti matrix were prepared by using thermal decomposition method and also MnO2 was coated on Ti and Pb matrix with DMF and PVDF compositions. The MnO2 electrodes prepared by thermal decomposition method had very weak adhesive strength onto Ti matrix and MnO2 layer was removed out so that electrochemical properties for MnO2 were not investigated. The viscosity of solvent used as a binder of MnO2 powder increased with the increasing PVDF contents. The thickness of the MnO2 layer on Pb matrix in DSA, which was prepared with 5 times dipping at the solution mixed with PVDF : DMF = 1 : 9, was 150㎛. When the ratio of PVDF to MnO2 was lower than 1 : 6, the Pb electrode didn't show any reaction irrespective of the concentrations of DMF. However, When the ratio of PVDF to MnO2 was higher than 1: 6, the Pb electrode showed constant current reactions and homogeneous cyclic voltammetry even though at a high cycle. The reason for the high current and homogeneous cyclic voltammetry is the good catalytic reactions of MnO2 powder in electrode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1226-7945			KJD:ART000937474

Here, we reported the fabrication of multilayer Waffle structured VS(2)featuring rich hole defects (VS2MLW). This structure shows excellent kinetic metrics for electrocatalytic HER, exhibiting a overpotential of 82 mV at the current density of -10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 61 mV dec(-1), and a long-term stability without any current fading. Its HER performance is much better than that of other V-based catalysts, and even comparable to that of commercial Pt/C. Through experimental and theoretical calculation, the outstanding electrocatalytic activity of the VS2MLW is attributed to its special morphology and electronic structure. The hole defects in this structure provide larger electrochemical active area and more active sites for HER, more importantly, hole defects change the electron structure of catalyst and reduce the free energy of hydrogen adsorption, the optimized free energy consequently leading to the improved inherent catalytic activity of VS2MLW.

Unmodified NFC and NFC chemically modified with a silane coupling agent and with ceric ammonium nitrate for direct polymer grafting from the cellulose surface were used. A homogeneous dispersion of NFC in the matrix was obtained in each case, leading to a marked improvement in oxygen barrier (up to nine times) and thermomechanical properties (storage modulus increased up to seven times). The mechanisms involved in the permeability reduction were investigated, revealing non-monotonic trends in the evolution of the solubility and diffusion coefficients with NFC content. Most significantly, the inherent moisture sensitivity of the oxygen permeability of the NFC was found to be drastically reduced when it was dispersed in the polymer matrix, particularly after chemical modification, underlining the promise of the present approach for the production of robust, high barrier organic films.

Designing and controlling the surface/interface structure of platinum-based nanomaterials at the atomic scale and understanding the structure-property relationship have great significance for optimizing the performances in practical catalytic applications. In this review, the strategies to obtain platinum-based catalysts with fantastic activity and great stability by composition regulation, shape control, three-dimension structure construction, and anchoring onto supports, are presented in detail.

AIPO(4)-coated LiNi0.8Co0.2O2 cathodes exhibited an original specific capacity of 170.8 mAh g(-1) and had a capacity retention (89.1% of its initial capacity) between 4.35 and 3.0V after 60 cycles at 150mAg(-1). Co-3(PO4)(2)-coated LiNi0.8Co0.2O2 cathodes exhibited an original specific capacity of 177.6 mAh g(-1) and excellent capacity retention (91.8% of its initial capacity), which was attributed to a lithium-reactive Co-3(PO4)(2) coating. The CO3(PO4)(2) coating material could react with LiOH and Li2CO3 impurities during annealing to form an olivine LixCoPO4 phase on the bulk surface, which minimized any side reactions with electrolytes and the dissolution of Ni4+ ions compared to the AIPO(4)-coated cathode. Differential scanning calorimetry results showed CO3(PO4)(2)-coated LiNi0.8Co0.2O2 cathode material had a much improved onset temperature of the oxygen evolution of about 218 degrees C, and a much lower amount of exothermic-heat release compared to the Al PO4-coated sample.

A new generation of Fe-based catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) which resembles SCEINs, e.g. single carbide nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon shells, has demonstrated enhanced activity and stability for FTS as compared to other carbon-supported Fe-based FTS. Thus the catalytic ability of SCEINs for the water splitting reactions and the Fe-based FTS catalyst with SCEINs-like features stimulated our exploration of SCEINs-catalyzed FTS. We performed ab initio DFT calculations using a realistic SCEINs model system Fe55@C240 to investigate for the first time the adsorption of the main reactants in FTS (CO and H/H2) and further to evaluate the catalytic ability of Fe55@C240 by reproducing the key steps of the well-known Fe-based FTS mechanisms (carbide, enol and CO insertion). Our calculations revealed: (i) a determinant role of Fe in enhancing CO adsorption (ii) strong cooperative effects with the adsorbates that stabilize the binding (iii) a less favourable two-sites reaction on Fe55@C240 due to preferential positions of the reactants farther to each other which prevent enol and carbide FTS mechanisms. We propose therefore a possible CO insertion path for hydrocarbon growth on Fe55@C240.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000423505500060	29322152

As far as adsorption-migration-desorption of precursors and the resultant nucleation, growth, and coalescence of 2D islands up to 1 monolayer are concerned, however, the autocatalytic-reaction (ACR) model [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82 (1999) 2334] can be a rare exception, which satisfactorily models the oxide film uptake curve during Si dry oxidation from a Langmuir to sigmoidal behaviors. A kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation, conducted to mimic the 2D growth of thin films, shows a similar shift from a Langmuir to sigmoidal uptake behavior by varying the parameters corresponding to adsorption, migration, and desorption. A comparison between ACR and KMC clarifies that the success of the ACR model lies in its effective inclusion of adsorption of species as well as of nucleation, growth, and coalescence of islands. A recipe is presented to translate the ACR parameters to KMC ones, which allows one to discuss the surface morphology based on the ACR analysis on the film uptake curve. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In flash smelting-flash converting copper smelters, when molten copper matte quenched in industrial water to produce matte granules, Na2SO4 precipitated and entered the system, which had negative influence on the matte converting process. The reaction behaviors of copper matte powder containing Na2SO4 have been studied through thermodynamic calculation and single-particle experiments. Calculated results showed that a liquid sulfate phase, Na2S containing copper matte, and Cu-Na alloy may form in the processing conditions of the converting process. The influence of the Na2SO4 dosage, fluxing conditions, and processing temperature has been systematically studied, and the results obtained showed that: (1); Na2SO4 physically precipitated on matte particles, and the Cu-Na alloy phase was found within copper phase in reacted particles; (2); Na2SO4 contamination hindered oxygen transfer by forming a low melting sulfate phase, and the de-sulfuration rate of matte powder changed dramatically along with the variation in Na2SO4 amount; (3); CaO flux was able to promote the converting reactions and Na2SO4 transformation; (4); Na2SO4 melt and formed a sulphate layer on matte particles at 1000 degrees C, Cu-Na alloy phase was found in samples collected at 1200 degrees C, and Cu-Na-O phase was detected in blister copper at 1600 degrees C.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000673485200003

Recently, although numerous 2D materials have been proposed as the photocatalytic candidates, the strategies to effectively modulate photocatalytic reactions and conversion efficiency are still lacking. Herein, based on first-principles calculations, we show that the photocatalytic activities and energy conversion efficiency can be well tuned by ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition of a AgBiP2Se6 monolayer. It is found that the AgBiP2Se6 monolayer has a higher potential and driving forces of photogenerated holes for water oxidation in the ferroelectric phase, but higher corresponding values of photogenerated electrons for the hydrogen reduction reaction in the paraelectric phase. Besides, the solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency is also tunable with the phase transition; it is up to 10.04% at the ferroelectric phase due to the better carrier utilization, but only 6.66% at the paraelectric phase. Moreover, the exciton binding energy is always smaller in the paraelectric state than that in the ferroelectric state, indicating that the ferroelectric switch could also make a directional adjustment to the photoexcited carrier separation. Our theoretical investigation not only reveals the importance of ferroelectric polarization on water splitting, but also opens an avenue to modify the photocatalytic properties of 2D ferroelectric materials via a ferroelectric switch.									122	4	0	0	4	0	122			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000509425600047	31888324

The elemental analysis and the mass spectrometric data confirmed the molecular formula of the complex. It is electrically non-conducting and paramagnetic. The complex crystallized as acetonitrile solvate. The X-ray structure shows that each Co(ii) centre has a distorted square-pyramidal NO4 coordination sphere, while each Co(iii) centre is in a distorted octahedral NO5 environment. The four metal atoms and the four bridging O-atoms form an open cubane type Co4O4 motif. In the crystal lattice, self-assembly of the solvated complex via intermolecular O-HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISO interaction leads to a two-dimensional network structure. The infrared and electronic spectroscopic features of the complex are consistent with its molecular structure. Cryomagnetic measurements together with theoretical calculations suggest the presence of easy-axis anisotropy for the square-pyramidal Co(ii) centres. The complex is redox-active and displays metal centred oxidation and reduction responses on the anodic and cathodic sides, respectively, of the Ag/AgCl electrode. Bifunctional heterogeneous electrocatalytic activity of the complex towards O-2 and H-2 evolution reactions (OER and HER) in neutral aqueous medium has been explored in detail.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000762920900001	35234225

In this study, we skillfully synthesized binary transition-metal (i.e., nickel and iron) phosphosulfides on nickel foam (NiFeSP/NF) via a sulfuration/phosphorization treatment of bimetallic layered double hydroxides (LDH). Taking the advantage of the presence of active heterointerfaces among Ni2P, Ni3S2, and FeS2, the NiFeSP/NF catalyst, which was advantageous of the highly exposed active sites, exhibited an extraordinary catalytic activity in HER-an overpotential of 70 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 69 mV dec(-1), outperforming most of the existing counterparts. Moreover, NiFeSP/NF catalysts demonstrated favorable long-term catalytic stability for 10 h. We contributed this superior catalytic activity to the characteristic attributes of NiFeSP/NF, which could be stemmed from its exquisite catalyst design: (i) the co-occurrence of highly HER-favored crystalline Ni2P, Ni3S2, and FeS2 in bimetallic phosphosulfides and (ii) the existence of multi-functional phase interfaces among Ni2P, Ni3S2, and FeS2 in the NiFeSP/NF hierarchical structure. The present study exemplified an effective strategy for designing HER-favored bimetallic phosphosulfides and provided the scientific base for the insight into the catalytic nature of multi metallic phosphosulfides.

Smarter material and strategy for anchoring platinum with enhanced utilization efficiency are highly demanded. In this work, N-doped hollow carbon nanospheres are prepared targetedly from a metal-organic framework for in-situ platinum dispersion. Through a simple electrochemical method, platinum nanoparticles are successfully anchored on the surface of the carbon nanospheres decorated electrode, which exhibits exceptional HER performance in H2SO4 with low onset overpotential, small Tafel slope (33 mV decade(-1)), high current density (overpotentials of 40 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and high stability (4000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles and total 30 h of high current density (10, 50 and 100 mA cm(-2)) chronoamperometric electrolysis). The superior electrocatalytic activity and durability can be attributed to the facilitated electron transport and synergistic effects between platinum and carbon nanospheres.

The PEDOT: PSS layer was coated on the surface of carbon (graphene) using simple method. A electrode containing PEDOT: PSS-coated graphene (PEDOT electrode) could be prepared without binder (such as PVDF) because of high adhesion of PEDOT: PSS. PEDOT electrode presented considerable discharge and charge capacity at all current densities. These results shows that PEDOT: PSS acts as a redox reaction matrix and conducting binder in the air electrode. Moreover, after cycling, the accumulation of reaction products due to side reaction in the electrode was significantly reduced through the use of PEDOT: PSS. This implies that PEDOT: PSS coating layer can suppress the undesirable side reactions between the carbon and electrolyte (and/or Li2O2), which causes enhanced Li-air cell cyclic performance.									35	0	0	0	2	0	35			2045-2322			WOS:000368670700001	26813852

Herein, the plasmon-enhanced photoelectrical nanocatalysts (NCs) have been successfully developed by Au nanoparticle-decorated Bi2Se3 nanoflowers (Au@Bi2Se3 NFs) as catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), leading to a more than 3-fold increase of current under excitation of Au localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and affording a markedly decreased overpotential of 375 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The HER enhancement can be largely attributed to effective electron-charge separation and the increase of carrier density in Bi2Se3 induced by the injection of hot electrons of Au nanoparticles. Meanwhile, Bi2Se3 nanoflowers (NFs), a kind of topological insulators, possess gapless edges on boundary and show metallic character on surface, providing a path for the flow of electrons in the electrocatalytic system. This study opens up a new avenue towards the design of higher energy conversion catalytic water splitting systems with the assistance of light energy, which could increase of HER catalysis efficiency by plasmonic excitation.

The need for better understanding and control of electrode-electrolyte interfaces where these reactions take place, however, implies the continuous need for development of efficient analytical techniques and methodologies capable of providing detailed information about the performance of electrocatalysts, especially in situ, under real operational conditions of electrochemical systems. During the past decade, significant efforts in the fields of electrocatalysis and (electro)analytical chemistry have resulted in the evolution of new powerful methods and approaches providing ever deeper and unique insight into complex and dynamic catalytic systems. The combination of various electrochemical and non-electrochemical methods as well as the application of quantum chemistry calculations has become a viable modern approach in the field. The focus of this critical review is primarily set on discussion of the most recent cutting-edge achievements in the development of analytical techniques and methodologies designed to evaluate three key constituents of the performance of electrocatalysts, namely, activity, selectivity and stability.

In this Perspective we discuss opportunities to replace all but the top atomic layer, or monolayer (ML), of Pt with low-cost, "Pt-like'' tungsten carbide (WC). These ML Pt-WC catalysts represent the lower limit of Pt loading, allowing for a significant decrease in Pt costs in devices such as fuel cells and electrolyzers. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental measurements indicate that the ML Pt-WC surface exhibits chemical and electronic properties that are very similar to bulk Pt for simple reactions such as the hydrogen evolution reaction, although deviation in behavior is observed for more complex reactions such as the electrooxidation of methanol. In order to further improve the performance of ML Pt-WC electrocatalysts and transfer knowledge gained from thin films to high surface area catalysts, a better understanding of the electronic, electrochemical, and catalytic properties of ML Pt-WC is needed. This Perspective provides an overview of these promising ML Pt-WC electrocatalysts and discusses approaches to overcoming limitations based on a better understanding of the Pt-WC interface and its behavior in electrochemical environments.									216	11	0	0	11	0	220			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000295888100014

However, it remains a great challenge to address the sluggish reaction kinetics and severe deactivation problems of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we show a Cu-doped Ni catalyst implanted with Ni-O-VOx sites (Ni(Cu)VOx) for alkaline HER. The optimal Ni(Cu)VOx electrode exhibits a near-zero onset overpotential and low overpotential of 21mV to deliver -10mAcm(-2), which is comparable to benchmark Pt/C catalyst. Evidence for the formation of Ni-O-VOx sites in Ni(Cu)VOx is established by systematic X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies. The VOx can cause a substantial dampening of Ni lattice and create an enlarged electrochemically active surface area. First-principles calculations support that the Ni-O-VOx sites are superactive and can promote the charge redistribution from Ni to VOx, which greatly weakens the H-adsorption and H-2 release free energy over Ni. This endows the Ni(Cu)VOx electrode high HER activity and long-term durability.									78	3	0	0	5	0	79			2041-1723			WOS:000542983000012	32483179

The FDPs in cyanobacteria have an extra domain as compared to major prokaryotic enzymes. The physiological role of cyanobacteria FDPs is mostly unknown. Of the four putative flavodiiron proteins (Flv1-4) in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, a physiological function in Mehler reaction has been suggested for Flv1 and Flv3.Principal Findings: We demonstrate a novel and crucial function for Flv2 and Flv4 in photoprotection of photosystem II (PSII) in Synechocystis. It is shown that the expression of Flv2 and Flv4 is high under air level of CO2 and negligible at elevated CO2. Moreover, the rate of accumulation of flv2 and flv4 transcripts upon shift of cells from high to low CO2 is strongly dependent on light intensity. Characterization of FDP inactivation mutants of Synechocystis revealed a specific decline in PSII centers and impaired translation of the D1 protein in Delta flv2 and Delta flv4 when grown at air level CO2 whereas at high CO2 the Flvs were dispensable. Delta flv2 and Delta flv4 were also more susceptible to high light induced inhibition of PSII than WT or Delta flv1 and Delta flv3.Significance: Analysis of published sequences revealed the presence of cyanobacteria-like FDPs also in some oxygenic photosynthetic eukaryotes like green algae, mosses and lycophytes. Our data provide evidence that Flv2 and Flv4 have an important role in photoprotection of water-splitting PSII against oxidative stress when the cells are acclimated to air level CO2. It is conceivable that the function of FDPs has changed during evolution from protection against oxygen in anaerobic microbes to protection against reactive oxygen species thus making the sustainable function of oxygen evolving PSII possible. Higher plants lack FDPs and distinctly different mechanisms have evolved for photoprotection of PSII.									123	2	0	0	121	0	124			1932-6203			WOS:000265514400017	19390625

The newly adapted equations are applied to a range of relevant molecular catalysts, both in homogeneous and heterogeneous phase, and the kinetic parameters are determined, including apparent rate constants and turnover frequencies. In this respect, the application of FOWA at different catalyst concentrations allows elucidation of the reaction mechanism that operates in each case. In addition, catalytic Tafel plots are used for assessing the performance of several molecular water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) as a function of overpotential under analogous conditions, and thus can be used for benchmarking purposes. This analysis was carried out earlier for oxide-based WOCs; however, this is the first report using molecular WOCs.									57	1	0	0	2	0	58			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000394571400015	27863132

In this work, we report a novel B-rich diruthenium triboride electrocatalyst homogeneously dispersed on the B, N doped carbon nanofiber (Ru2B3@BNC) synthesized at a moderate temperature (600 degrees C). Electrochemical tests reveal that such a Ru2B3@BNC electrocatalyst owns surprising HER performance with ultralow overpotentials (i) of 7, 41, and 58 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4, and 1 M PBS (pH = 7) solutions, respectively, outperforming commercial Pt/C and all reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts, as well as superior durability. Combining density functional theory (DFT) computational Results, it unveils that the electron-deficient B atom can contribute to the local electronic redistribution, leading to the anchoring preference effect of H* on Ru atoms for Ru-B bonds in Ru2B3. Thus, our work highlights a new type of cheap noble-metal-based electrocatalysts for high-efficiency HER electrocatalysis.									45	2	0	0	7	0	45			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000560728400006

However, the reported catalytic activities for Ni3S2 are still relatively low. Herein, an effective strategy to boost the H adsorption capability and HER performance of Ni3S2 through nitrogen (N) doping is demonstrated. N-doped Ni3S2 nanosheets achieve a fairly low overpotential of 155 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and an excellent exchange current density of 0.42 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 m KOH electrolyte. The mass activity of 16.9 mA mg(-1) and turnover frequency of 2.4 s(-1) obtained at 155 mV are significantly higher than the values reported for other Ni3S2-based HER catalysts, and comparable to the performance of best HER catalysts in alkaline medium. These experimental data together with theoretical analysis suggest that the outstanding catalytic activity of N-doped Ni3S2 is due to the enriched active sites with favorable H adsorption free energy. The activity in the Ni3S2 is highly correlated with the coordination number of the surface S atoms and the charge depletion of neighbor Ni atoms. These new findings provide important guidance for future experimental design and synthesis of optimal HER catalysts.									170	9	0	0	9	0	170			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000437667800012

However, it is still a challenge to realize the enhanced electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using these structures with electric, photo-, and thermal effects. Herein, we report that Pd-tipped Au nanorods (NRs) were prepared for electrochemical water splitting in the visible and near-infrared region. The NRs exhibited a lower onset overpotential (40mV) and high exchange current density (1.585mA/cm(2)), which was largely ascribed to the increased carrier density in Pd induced by photo-excited Au NRs, and further enhancement of Pd catalytic activity resulted from the photothermal effect of Au NRs. As the hot electron transport channel was hindered by excess Pd nanoparticles, it was found that the HER performance of tipped NRs was much higher than that of fully covered ones. This study extends enhanced electrocatalytic HER activity with plasmonic bimetallic structures by taking full advantage of the synergy between photoelectric and photothermal effects.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			2196-0216			WOS:000426495000010

Nevertheless, the high dissociation energy of the O-H bond impedes its academic progress and the practical applications. Herein, we synthesize a 3D hierarchical porous loofah-like carbon nitride sponge (LCN) with ultrathin thickness via the supramolecular pre-organization coupling with the oxidation etching process, in which the heterogeneous oxygen atoms and the nitrogen vacancies are in-situ engineered. On top of the adorable photocatalytic H2 evolution (4812 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)), LCN associated with Pt cocatalyst reveals a conversion rate of 96.5 % towards the hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol, substantially superior to the reference experiment (8.3 %). Further based on the isotope-labeling tests and the density functional theory calculations, the photo-generated H0 from water is clarified to be the direct reducing agent, tactfully skipping the hydrogen extraction step in the traditional path. This work provides a green and sustainable methodology to transfer the solar energy to the valuable fine chemicals, as well as highlights the importance of the 3D hierarchical porous structure to the catalytic activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000800412400005

Nitrosation of solid CAA (glycine or valine derivative) by a 4/1 NO/O-2 gaseous mixture (1 atm) yields N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) quantitatively in less than 1 h at room temperature. The crude solid NCA undergoes quantitative oligomerization (from trimer to nonamer under the conditions we used) when treated with a (bi)carbonate aqueous buffer at pH 9. We therefore suggest that part of the prebiotic amino acid activation/polymerization process may have taken place in a dry phase ("drying-lagoon" scenario).									48	0	0	0	15	0	49			0022-2844	1432-1432		WOS:000080241400002	10229567

Accordingly, single-atom catalysts (SACs), defined as catalysts containing atomically dispersed active sites on a support material, strikingly show the highest atomic utilization and drastically boosted catalytic performances to functionally mimic or even outperform natural enzymes. The molecular characteristics of SACs (e.g., unique metal-support interactions and precisely located metal sites), especially single-atom iron catalysts (Fe-SACs) that have a similar catalytic structure to the catalytically active center of metalloprotease, enable the accurate identification of active centers in catalytic reactions, which afford ample opportunity for unraveling the structure-function relationship of Fe-SACs. In this review, we present an overview of the recent advances of support materials for anchoring an atomic dispersion of Fe. Subsequently, we highlight the structural designability of support materials as two sides of the same coin. Moreover, the applications described herein illustrate the utility of Fe-SACs in a broad scope of industrially and biologically important reactions. Finally, we present an outlook of the major challenges and opportunities remaining for the successful combination of single Fe atoms and catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2055-6756	2055-6764		WOS:000853020400001	36097878

However, the catalytic performance of the NRR electrocatalyst still requires a systematical investigation and improvement. Herein, this paper reports that MoS2/C3N4 is prepared by in situ controllable synthesis through a one-step pyrolysis process of thiourea and ammonium molybdate. A thorough characterization reveals that the strong interactions between MoS2 and C3N4 of MoS2/C3N4 lead to the formation of an interface with Mo-N coordination, which promotes electron transfer across the MoS2/C3N4 interface. Meanwhile, it is clarified that the formation of interfacial Mo-N coordination is beneficial to improve the catalytic activity and acts as the main active sites for catalyzing NRR. As a result, the as-prepared electrocatalyst exhibits an excellent NH3 yield rate of 19.86 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) and an enhanced faradaic efficiency of 6.87% at -0.5 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) in 0.1 M Na2SO4, placing it as one of the most promising NRR electrocatalysts.									30	3	0	0	4	0	31			2168-0485			WOS:000541876900035

The CuCo2O4/CuO nanocomposites are synthesized by microwave assisted reflux method at different reaction times (1, 5,10 and 15 min) and are subjected to necessary characterization techniques to find its physicochemical properties. The compound formation temperature is identified through TG/DSC analysis. Subsequently the phase formation is envisaged from XRD analysis. The characteristic functional groups and valency state of the elements are revealed from FT-IR and XPS analysis, respectively. The spherical and rod-like shape CuCo2O4/CuO particles are visualized from FESEM and TEM analysis. The CuCo2O4/CuO prepared at 5 min reaction time provides the enhanced capacitance of 781 F g(-1) at 2 mV s(-1) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Further the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is fabricated with activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode, which rendered the specific capacitance of 141 Fg(-1) at 1 mVs(-1) with an energy density of 18 Wh kg(-1) and power density of 259 W kg(-1) at 1 mAcm(-2) in 1 M KOH electrolyte.

However, it was seldom used in hydrogen generation because of its low conduction band and high reaction overpotential. Here, we proposed an effective strategy to address these issues by distributing BiVO4 quantum dots onto nanostructured tin oxide (SnO2). The nanostructured SnO2 simultaneously served as the host substrate and a passivation layer. Carbon quantum dots were also used to improve the charge transfer and electrocatalytic properties at the BiVO4-SnO2 interface. As expected, the final composite yields a net photo-current of 2.2 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and a hydrogen generation rate of 0.54 mu mol.h(-1) without bias. The excellent performance was due to the enhanced electron energy, effective charge separation at the BiVO4-SnO2 interface, and the fast hole transfer from BiVO4 to carbon quantum dots and electrolyte.									30	2	0	0	3	0	30			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000414155500007

The metal-free HT-AFNG is efficient for the HER in the acid solution and can deliver an onset potential of 100 mV and an overpotential of 350 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than those of the singly and dually doped graphene reported previously. The amine functionalized and nitrogen doped structure plays an important role in the high catalytic activity of the HT-AFNG, where the amine group can greatly reduce the vertical bar Delta G(H*)vertical bar value at both defect and edge sites as well as increases the electron transfer capability of nitrogen dope graphene (NG). Significantly, the highly torn structure also makes a big contribution on the high catalytic activity of the HT-AFNG, since it allows for the good accessibility of the active sites for the HER. The strategy involves the introduction of electron donating groups open a new research pathway towards the improvement of HER catalytic activity of graphene-based materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

To elucidate the effect of the presence of these extrinsic proteins on the stabilization of the oxygen-evolving machinery against high-temperature stress, we inactivated the genes for these proteins individually in Synechocystis sp.

The thermal stability of the oxygen-evolving machinery decreased in all mutated cells but the extent of the susceptibility to heat inactivation varied between the photosystems lacking the different extrinsic proteins. Cells that lacked either the manganese-stabilizing protein or cytochrome c(550) were unable to enhance the thermal stability of the oxygen-evolving machinery and, moreover, failed to increase cellular thermotolerance when grown at moderately high temperatures. Our findings indicate that the three extrinsic proteins stabilize the oxygen-evolving machinery independently against high-temperature stress and that the thermal stability of the machinery influences cellular thermotolerance.									40	1	0	0	40	0	42			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000177620800012	12198196

Development of synthesizable catalysts has always been one of the biggest obstacles to replace platinum-group catalysts.

The state-of-the-art CTFs@MoS2 structure exhibits superior catalytic kinetics with an overpotential of 93 mV and Tafel slope of 43 mV dec(-1), which is improved over most other reported analogous catalysts. The inherent pi-conjugated crystal channels in CTFs provides a multifunctional support for electron transmission and mass diffusion during the hydrogen evolution process. Catalytic kinetics analysis shows that the HER performance is closely correlated to the hierarchical pore parameters and aggregated thickness of MoS2 nanoparticles. This work provides an attractive and durable alternative to synthesize high activity and stable catalysts for HER.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000492169000001	31552705

Recently, researchers have developed a variety of well-controlled methods to synthesize atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs). NCs have shown high catalytic activity and unique selectivity in many catalytic reactions, which are related to their ultrasmall size, abundant unsaturated active sites, and unique electronic structure different from that of traditional nanoparticles (NPs). More importantly, because of their definite structure and monodispersity, they are used as model catalysts to reveal the correlation between catalyst performance and structure at the atomic scale. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the recent progress on NCs in catalysis and provide potential theoretical guidance for the rational design of high-performance catalysts. First a brief summary of the synthetic strategies and characterization methods of NCs is provided. Then the primary focus of this review-the model catalyst role of NCs in catalysis-is illustrated from theoretical and experimental perspectives, particularly in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, photoelectric conversion, and catalysis of organic reactions. Finally, the main challenges and opportunities are examined for a deep understanding of the key catalytic steps with the goal of expanding the catalytic application range of NCs.									475	18	0	0	26	1	473			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000509426800003	30901198

Herein, we successfully developed a simple and fast anodic electrodeposition route to fabricate amorphous NiCoOx films on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate. The crystalline structure, surface morphology, and surface composition of deposited films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The optimized NiCoOx provided a synergistic effect for efficient water oxidation, with an overpotential of 250 mV and a low Tafel slope of 48 mV.dec(-1). The NiCoOx films also exhibited an enhanced long-term durability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000436243500074	29954556

J	Kang, Jin Woo; Chung, Ik Kyo								The effects of eutrophication and acidification on the ecophysiology of Ulva pertusa Kjellman								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY				29	5			2675	2683		10.1007/s10811-017-1087-5				DEC 2017	2017	In coastal environments, acidification and eutrophication affect the physiology of marine macroalgae. We investigated the responses of Ulva pertusa Kjellman (Ulvales, Chlorophyta) under such conditions. Samples were cultured at two different pH settings (low, 7.5; high, 8.0) and at three different ammonium levels (low, 4; medium, 60; high, 120 mu M NH4 (+)). Our objective was to analyze the influence that elevated CO2 and NH4 (+) might have on pH, oxygen evolution, rates of nutrient uptake, chlorophyll fluorescence, growth, and C/N ratio of that organism. Variability in pH value was enhanced under low pH/high NH4 (+) and was significantly different (p < 0.05) from changes measured when the high pH/low NH4 (+) combination was applied. Rates of NH4 (+) uptake and relative growth rates by U. pertusa were increased under low pH/high NH4 (+) conditions and that response was significantly different (p < 0.05) from the other treatments. The rate of photosynthetic oxygen evolution and chlorophyll fluorescence were increased under elevated NH4 (+) concentrations (p < 0.05). However, the C/N ratio of U. pertusa was not affected by higher concentrations of CO2 and NH4 (+) (p > 0.05). Our results indicated that the physiological reactions of this alga were heightened when exposed to either the elevated combination of CO2/NH4 (+) or even when only the level of NH4 (+) was raised. Although such excessive growth can lead to bloom formations in coastal areas, this species also has greater capacity for taking up nutrients and dissolved inorganic carbon.					22nd International Seaweed Symposium (ISS)22nd International Seaweed Symposium (ISS)	JUN 19-24, 2016JUN 19-24, 2016	Int Seaweed AssocInt Seaweed Assoc	Copenhagen, DENMARKCopenhagen, DENMARK	15	2	0	0	15	0	16			0921-8971	1573-5176		WOS:000413299100051

The sample generation - tip collection (SG-TC) mode was used to operate the SECM and the tip potential was biased to detect the electroactive species. The evolution of the current at the ultramicroelectrode tip with the applied potential within the passive range was followed at different LiBr concentrations. Results show that the absolute value of the current at the tip increases with the applied potential. Additionally, SECM was also used to detect stable pits formed on the stainless steel surface in a 0.2 M LiBr solution. The results show clear evidence of the presence of high amounts of other reducible species (metal cations) apart from oxygen. Also, the dish-shape morphology of the pits observed using Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy will be discussed in relation to the kinetics of the reactions observed using SECM.

During the operation of the fuel cell, noble metal catalysts are widely used to accelerate the reaction kinetics by alloying with other materials. However, there are a few facile methods for improving elemental metal catalytic activity. In this work, the defect-rich palladium (Pd) aerogels are acquired by laser ablating technology, which can significantly improve the intrinsic activity of Pd elementary catalysts through introducing defects and lattice strain. The electrochemical results show that the mass and specific activities of the obtained Pd aerogel for the formate oxidation reaction are 2.26 and 1.99 times higher than those of the commercial Pd/C. The excellent activity and stability of the Pd aerogel for ethanol oxidation reaction have also been demonstrated. The effect of the compressive strain is further investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It has been found that the compressive strain weakens the adsorption strength of the intermediates, which can facilitate the desorption of toxic specifics. The laser-assisted synthesis of defect-rich aerogel paves a way in optimizing the structure of the elemental metal catalysts and improving their intrinsic catalytic activity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2168-0485			WOS:000662271200015

In addition, the types of sulfur compounds in shale oils at different pyrolysis temperatures were determined by flash pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and a gas chromatography-sulfur chemiluminescence detector. The reaction pathway for the sulfur-containing model provided reliable results for the conversion behavior of sulfur, which was consistent with the experimental values. With increasing temperature, the content of C-n-thiophene continuously decreased. In contrast, the C-n-benzothiophene concentration generally increased with increasing temperature. The S=O double bond affected the C-S bond order, and the bond order was reduced due to the effect of oxygen atoms. Calculation results revealed that the alkyl side-chain group tends to form an aromatic ring structure, leading to the increase in the relative content of C-n-thiophene/benzothiophene. Meanwhile, the Mulliken atomic charge, bond dissociation energy, bond length, and Mayer bond order of thioether and sulfoxide compounds were estimated. Quantum chemistry was successfully employed to analyze the chemical reactions, which provided a basis for promoting the understanding of the kerogen pyrolysis mechanism at the molecular level.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000499741900020

Effect of Retorting Temperature								ENERGY & FUELS				35	3			2838	2844		10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c03727		JAN 2021		FEB 4 2021	2021	Fluidized bed retorting of oil shale is a potential technology with high shale oil yield. However, there are few studies on the composition distribution of the products of this technology. In this work, Dachengzi oil shale from Huadian city of China was retorted in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor, focusing on the effect of retorting temperature on the yield and composition distribution of products. With increasing retorting temperature, shale oil yield increased up to 522 degrees C and then decreased, and noncondensable gas always kept slow growth, while shale char decreased significantly. The H/C atomic ratio of shale oil decreased with increasing temperature, which was attributed to the strengthened dehydrocyclization and aromatization reactions of shale oil. Higher temperatures promoted more oxygen-containing functional groups releasing in forms of CO2 and CO, decreasing the O/C atomic ratio of shale oil. At the same time, higher retorting temperatures could also enhance cracking reactions and thus reduce heavy fractions of shale oil. With the increase of retorting temperature, the content of aliphatics decreased up to 562 degrees C and then increased, while the content of aromatics was always increasing. The yields of inorganic gases and some hydrocarbon gases, as well as the total alkenes/alkanes ratio increased because of the strengthened secondary cracking reactions at higher temperatures.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000627568300084

The reaction proceeds by stepwise oxidation of (RuORuIII)-O-III to (RuORuV)-O-V with oxidation of (RuORuIII)-O-IV the slow step. (RuORuV)-O-V has been identified as an intermediate by the appearance of its ClO4- salt as a black suspension in concentrated solutions at 5 degrees C. It is the key intermediate in water oxidation. The mechanism may involve a bimolecular step and formation of a peroxo-bridged intermediate. Catalytic water oxidation is greatly retarded after just a few catalytic cycles because of anation induced by O-2 evolution.									152	0	0	0	24	0	152			0002-7863			WOS:000089285300015

An optimal control strategy called event-driven time optimal control was applied to biodegrade, in a discontinuous reactor, wastewater containing 4-chlorophenol as an inhibitory compound model. The strategy estimates the oxygen mass uptake rate, which is linearly related to the substrate uptake rate, by measuring only the dissolved oxygen concentration and the volume of the reactor. Using this estimation, the optimal strategy sets the influent flow rate such that the substrate degradation rate is maintained around its maximal value as long as possible, thus minimizing the reaction time. The strategy was tested for the degradation of different influent concentrations of 4-chlorophenol between 175 and 625 mg L-1. Also, the robustness of the strategy under different airflow rates was studied. It was concluded that the practical implementation of the optimal strategy was possible and very successful.

J	Zhang, Chenyun; Chen, Tingting; Zhang, Hong; Li, Zhonghao; Hao, Jingcheng								Hydrated-Metal-Halide-Based Deep-Eutectic-Solvent-Mediated NiFe Layered Double Hydroxide: An Excellent Electrocatalyst for Urea Electrolysis and Water Splitting								CHEMISTRY-AN ASIAN JOURNAL				14	17			2995	3002		10.1002/asia.201900742		AUG 2019		SEP 2 2019	2019	The liquid structures of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) based on hydrated metal halides and their application as electrolytes have been widely studied. However, little attention has been paid to the direct use of this type of DES in the preparation of micro-/nanomaterials. Herein, an FeCl3.6 H2O/urea DES was used in the one-step synthesis of NiFe-LDH_D with a nanoflower morphology. In alkaline media, this catalyst promoted excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of urea at potential of 1.32 V (vs. RHE) and for the oxygen-evolution reaction at a potential of 1.39 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). These results were superior to the results with NiFe-LDH/NF that was obtained from an aqueous solution of FeCl3, as well as most of the previously reported transition-metal catalysts. Furthermore, NiFe-LDH_D/NF could be readily implemented as both a cathode and an anode for the electrolysis of urea and water splitting. The use of hydrated-metal-halide-based DESs for the preparation of LDH catalysts through a dipping-redox strategy should both enrich the research of DESs and offer guidance for the rational surface engineering of catalysts for the electrolysis of urea and overall water splitting with high performance.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000481163100001	31310427

However, they are not satisfied well for long-life rechargeable zinc-air batteries due to the limited single particle morphology. Herein, the preparation of an interconnected macroporous carbon matrix with a well-defined 3D architecture by the pyrolysis of silica templated ZIF-67 assemblies is reported. The matrix catalyst assembled zinc-air battery exhibits a high power density of 221.1 mW cm(-2) as well as excellent stability during 500 discharging/charging cycles, surpassing that of a commercial Pt/C assembled battery. The synergistic effect from the interconnected macroporous structure together with abundant cobalt-nitrogen-carbon active sites justify the excellent electrocatalytic activity and battery performance. Considering the advanced nanostructures and performance, the as-synthesized hybrid would be promising for rechargeable zinc-air batteries and other energy technologies. This work may also provide significant concept in the view of electrocatalysis design for long-life battery.									133	11	0	0	10	0	134			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000536893900001	32484260	
J	Jiang, Kun; Li, Kai; Liu, Yun-Quan; Lin, Shixiang; Wang, Zhaolin; Wang, Duo; Ye, Yueyuan								Nickel-cobalt nitride nanoneedle supported on nickel foam as an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen generation from ammonia electrolysis								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				403						139700	10.1016/j.electacta.2021.139700				JAN 20 2022	2022	The generation of hydrogen from water electrolysis has been widely studied as a power-to-gas pathway for the change of energy consumption system, and has attracted a lot of scientific interest over the past several decades. However, the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) leads to high overpotential in the electrolytic process. Therefore, using ammonia electrolysis to replace water splitting was recently considered as an advisable method for getting pure hydrogen, as ammonia electrocatalytic decomposition is thermodynamically more energy efficient than water splitting. Thus, in this work, a nanostructured transition metal binary (rather than the most widely used noble metals) deposited on nickel foam was developed through a hydrothermal method. The nickel-cobalt bimetallic catalyst was then further fabricated through the nitridation process annealed in an ammonia atmosphere at high temperatures to prepare nickel-cobalt nitride, which substantiated an optimal electrochemical performance on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline ammonia system. The electrochemical tests indicated that the 1D nanoneedle nickel-cobalt nitride electrode offers favorable surface area and active sites leading to the hydrogen evolution onset potential close to zero, the overpotential 74 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2), 138 mV at 100mA.cm(-2), and the Tafel slope 67 mV/dec. In addition, it also demonstrated an excellent stability in long-term running, with the hydrogen generation rate slightly reduced after 10 h of chronoamperometry measurements. Moreover, the potential of ammonia electrolysis was 0.71 V at 100 mA.cm(-2) in a two-electrodes system, lower than that of water splitting, suggesting the hydrogen production from ammonia electrolysis could be a promising alternative to water splitting.

In this closed system, all the aluminum in Al(acac)(3) was converted into PACS. Therefore, the content of aluminum could be readily controlled quantitatively. On the basis of Fourier transform infrared, H-1-NMR, C-13-NMR, Si-29-NMR, and Al-27 magic-angle spinning NMR analysis, the reaction mechanism was proposed as follows: PDMS dissociated during pyrolysis to generate silicon free radicals, and then they reacted with Al(acac)(3) to yield PACS containing (Si-O)(n)Al groups (n = 4, 5, or 6). Mean while, these reactions resulted in the cleavage of O-C and/or O=C bonds in Al(acac)(3). Some of the free-radical fragments generated by this cleavage continued to react with the silicon free radicals and were incorporated into the structural units of PACS; the rest of them may have been converted into small oxygen-containing compounds, which were removed in the subsequent processing after the reactions.

The precursor fibers obtained by electrospinning were heated in air at a low temperature firstly, followed by calcination at high temperature in Ar. With changing the amount of Ni precursors and preparation conditions, the morphology of resulting samples were adjusted from porous nanofiber to nanotube-loaded bulky material. The sizes and distribution of Ni/NiO NPs also changed. These NPs were in and on the nanofibers or located on the top of nanotubes. Electrochemistry test results indicate that resulting sample revealed enhanced electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) when the precursor contained 0.5 mmol Ni. In an alkaline medium, the current density of samples could reach up to 280 mA cm(-2). This is ascribed to the homogeneous distribution of Ni/NiO NPs and the porous structure of nanofibers with a large surface area of 251 m(2)/g. In contrast, the HER performance of nanotube-loaded bulky material get worse due to the disadvantage of specific surface area. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The UVB-induced inhibition of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) photoreduction and lowering of chlorophyll a fluorescence could not be reversed by artificial electron donors (diphenyl carbazide, NH2OH and MnCl2). These electron donors, however, substantially reversed the inhibition caused by Pb, thereby suggesting that UVB primarily inhibits the photosystem II (PS II) reaction center and Pb arrests the electron flow at the water splitting site, Nevertheless, the suppressed fluorescence intensity and the reduced emission and excitation peaks of phycobilisomes indicate the involvement of Pb in inhibition of PS II, All combinations of UVB and Pb inhibited the different metabolic processes in a synergistic manner.									11	4	0	0	10	0	15			0031-8655			WOS:A1996VM13600007

Nature communications				13	1			6650	6650		10.1038/s41467-022-34380-9				2022 Nov 04	2022	Unraveling the precise location and nature of active sites is of paramount significance for the understanding of the catalytic mechanism and the rational design of efficient electrocatalysts. Here, we use well-defined crystalline cobalt oxyhydroxides CoOOH nanorods and nanosheets as model catalysts to investigate the geometric catalytic active sites. The morphology-dependent analysis reveals a ~50 times higher specific activity of CoOOH nanorods than that of CoOOH nanosheets. Furthermore, we disclose a linear correlation of catalytic activities with their lateral surface areas, suggesting that the active sites are exclusively located at lateral facets rather than basal facets. Theoretical calculations show that the coordinatively unsaturated cobalt sites of lateral facets upshift the O 2p-band center closer to the Fermi level, thereby enhancing the covalency of Co-O bonds to yield the reactivity. This work elucidates the geometrical catalytic active sites and enlightens the design strategy of surface engineering for efficient OER catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2041-1723		MEDLINE:36333330	36333330

For the practical application of water electrocatalysis, it is important to develop a non-noble metal-based, earth-abundant, highly efficient, and stable electrocatalysts for water splitting. Among the various non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts, layered transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have emerged as fascinating materials for electrochemical water splitting. The unique structural and electronic properties of layered TMCs make them very attractive for understanding the fundamental principles of electrocatalysis, as well as for developing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the practical application of water electrocatalysis. In this mini review, we present a comprehensive overview of recent developments to improve the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of layered transition metal chalcogenide (TMC)-based electrocatalysts for practical applications in water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2451-9103			WOS:000819871900012		
J	Deng, Haoyuan; Feng, Haoran; Luo, Guoqiang; Tu, Rong; Zheng, Yingqiu; Shen, Qiang								One-step corrosion method for preparing Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide on nickel foam: Importance of the iron valence state								MATERIALS LETTERS				316						131999	10.1016/j.matlet.2022.131999				JUN 1 2022	2022	A facile chloride corrosion method was adopted to synthesize Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH) materials on Ni foam. Ni-Fe LDH catalysts with varying oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance were obtained by using different iron salts. The reasons for differences in the OER activity were investigated through experiments and characterizations. Structural characterization results showed that Fe3+ salts generated Ni-Fe LDH on nickel foam (NF), and FeOOH was additionally obtained by Fe2+ salts. Compared with NiFe/NF prepared with ferrous salts precursors, NiFe/NF catalysts produced using ferric salts exhibited markedly enhanced OER performance, presenting lower overpotentials of approximately 290 mV to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm-2 and lower Tafel slopes of approximately 96 mV dec- 1 in 1.0 M KOH.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-577X	1873-4979		WOS:000793245300003

The provision of O-2 and monomeric hydrophobic photosensitizers (PSs) under physiological conditions would greatly help to shrink malignant tumors. We take advantage of the high porosity and multifunctionality of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to fabricate a simple all-in-one nanoplatform mediated by microneedle delivery to achieve synergistic O-2 evolution and chemophototherapy. An iron(iii)-based MOF (MIL-100(Fe)) acted not only as a vehicle for the concurrent delivery of zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and doxorubicin hydrochloride (Dox), but also to supply O-2 by decomposing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the tumor microenvironment via a Fenton-like reaction. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that the nanoplatform had excellent biocompatibility and exerted enhanced anticancer effects. The encapsulated drug was sustainably released from the nanoplatform skeleton in response to acidic tumor microenvironments. Moreover, upon 660 nm light irradiation, ZnPc effectively produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to the reduction of hypoxia by MIL-100(Fe). A microneedle technique was adopted to directly deliver the nanoplatform into superficial tumors rather than via systemic circulation. Hence, this study provides a new strategy for more efficient chemophototherapy of hypoxic superficial tumors.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			2047-4830	2047-4849		WOS:000693170900001	34636812

Hydrogen and oxygen are evolved with a 2 : 1 ratio by irradiating the C3N4-WO3 composites loaded with Pt under visible light (lambda > 420 nm) without any redox mediator. Introducing reduced graphene oxide (rGO) into the C3N4-WO3 composites enhances the water splitting efficiency. Through optimizing the mass ratio in the C3N4-WO3 composites, rGO content, amount of loaded Pt and pH value of the reacting system, the highest H-2/O-2 evolution rates of 2.84 and 1.46 mu mol h(-1) can be obtained, with a quantum yield of 0.9%. Our findings demonstrate that the hydrothermal method is a promising strategy for constructing intimate heterostructures for Z-scheme water-splitting systems without using any redox mediator, and that rGO can be used to further enhance the performance in optimized conditions.									77	8	0	0	9	0	81			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000355487900040

Herein, we report that hybrid water electrolysis, integrating the electrochemical reforming of benzyl alcohol (BA) and the H-2 evolution reaction (HER), largely accelerates the kinetics and stability of H-2 production over a hierarchical bifunctional catalyst couple of Mo-Ni alloy nanoparticles in 1.0 M KOH. The high-performance of the hierarchical Mo-Ni nanoparticle catalyst for both the HER and the BA oxidation not only eliminated the need for an ion-conducting membrane to separate the cathodic and anodic reactions to achieve nearly unity faradaic efficiences for the two reactions, but also allowed the reactions to be readily driven by low cell voltage in a two-electrode configuration. Specifically, the cell voltages required to deliver the benchmark current densities of 20, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2) are as low as 1.40, 1.45, and 1.53 V, respectively. The membrane-free hybrid water electrolysis technology exhibits a set of advantages including long device lifetime, ease of H-2 collection, and high efficiency, thus showing significant promise for practical H-2 production, especially considering the fact that the device can be readily powered by a single-cell alkaline battery or a solar cell under natural sunlight irradiation.									26	0	0	0	2	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000475689800041

In this study, we demonstrate a new co-catalyst of FeP and trace Fe2+ that can greatly enhance the decomposition efficiency of H2O2 and accelerate the degradation of methylene blue (MB). This co-catalyst is applicable in a broad pH range (pH = 3.0 -9.0) and capable of degrading 95.74% and 89.01% of MB with 100 ppm in concentration within 30 s at pH 3 and 5, and 99.65% and 90.06% within 3 min at pH 7 and 9. The coexistence of FeP with Fe-II accelerates the Fe-III/Fe-II cycle by electron transfer between Fe delta+ in FeP and Fe-III. Mossbauer spectra and density functional theory calculations indicate that the unique structure of FeP plays an important role in accelerating the Fe-III/Fe-II cycle.									71	2	0	0	20	0	71			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000488308800002

The influence of various parameters, such as kinds of catalysts, reaction temperature and electrolysis duration on electrolysis is studied and the catalytic electrolysis mechanism is discussed. The prepared NiOOH sample is characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope observation and electrochemical measurements. The experimental results show that the spherical beta-NiOOH powder with high capacity is obtained by electrolysis process under the conditions of a temperature of 30-35 degrees C with addition of KMnO4 for 4 h in 6-9 mol L-1 NaOH solution. The obtained NiOOH electrodes have superior electrochemical performance than commercial MnO2 electrodes under different current densities. The NiOOH electrode offers 273.6 mAh g(-1) specific capacity at 60 mA g(-1), which is about 20% higher than that of commercial MnO2 electrode.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1452-3981			WOS:000429101700043

The metal-free nature of the nanocarbons can completely prevent toxic metal leaching and the associated secondary contamination. In this study, nitrogen doped graphene (NG) at a doping level of 6.54 at.% was prepared at mild conditions. Moreover, B- and P-doping or codoping with N in graphene were also achieved by a simple route. The modified graphene can efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to produce sulfate radicals to oxidize phenol solutions. Kinetic studies indicated that initial phenol concentration, PMS dosage, and temperature presented significant influences on the degradation rates. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis provided further insights into the evolution of active radicals during the activation of PMS and SO4 center dot- was believed to be the primary radicals in the oxidation reactions. This study demonstrated a metal-free material for green catalysis in environmental remediation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we discuss the mechanisms of bacterial bioluminescence. We have the main results from structural and functional analysis of the genes of lux operons, enzymes (luciferase), and mechanisms of bioluminescence in several species of marine bacteria, which belong to three genera, Vibrio, Aliivibrio, and Photobacterium (A. fischeri, V. harveyi, P. leiognathi, and P. phosphoreum), and in terrestrial bacteria of the genus Photorhabdus (Ph. luminescens). The structure and mechanisms for the regulation of the expression of the lux operons are discussed. The fundamental characteristics of luciferase and luciferase-catalyzed reactions (stages of FMNH2 and tetradecanal oxidation, dimensional structure, as well as folding and refolding of the macromolecule) are described. We also discuss the main concepts of the origin of bacterial bioluminescence and its role in the ecology of modern marine fauna, including its involvement in the processes of detoxification of the reactive oxygen species and DNA repair, as well as the bait hypothesis.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0026-8933	1608-3245		WOS:000454272100003

The maximum power (P-max) obtained was in the range from 1.7 mW to 1.9 mW for each SC-MFC. This in-series connection of four SC-MFCs almost quadrupled Pmax to an operating voltage of 3025 mV and a Pmax of 8.1 mW, one of the highest power outputs reported in the literature. An additional electrode (Ad(HER)) connected to the anode of the first SC-MFC and placed in the fourth SC-MFC evolved hydrogen. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) taking place at the electrode was studied on Pt and two novel platinum group metal-free (PGM-free) catalysts: Fe-Aminoantipyrine (Fe-AAPyr) and Fe-Mebendazole (Fe-MBZ). The amount of H-2 produced was estimated using the Faraday law as 0.86 mMd(-1)cm(-2) (0.132 Lday(-1)) for Pt, 0.83 mMd(-1)cm(-2) (0.127 Lday(-1)) for Fe-AAPyr and 0.8 mMd(-1)cm(-2) (0.123 L day(-l))' for Fe-MBZ. Hydrogen evolution was also detected using gas chromatography. While HER was taking place, galvanostatic discharges were also performed showing simultaneous H-2 production and pulsed power generation with no need of external power sources.

Surface Density Function statistics in hydrogen-air flames for different turbulent premixed combustion regimes								COMBUSTION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				190	11			1988	2002		10.1080/00102202.2018.1480015				2018	2018	The choice of reaction progress variable (RPV) on the statistical behavior of the surface density function (SDF) and the strain rates, which govern the evolution of SDF, have been analyzed using a detailed chemistry Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) database of freely propagating statistically planar air flames with an equivalence ratio of 0.7. The DNS database consists of three cases spanning the corrugated flamelets (CF), thin reaction zones (TRZ) and broken reaction zones (BRZ) regimes of premixed turbulent combustion. For this analysis, the RPV is defined based on the mass fractions of H-2, O-2 and H2O. The mean variations of the SDF and the flame displacement speed, , have also been found to be dependent on the choice of the RPV. The progressive weakening (strengthening) of the preferential alignment of the RPV gradient with the most extensive (compressive) principal strain rate with increasing Karlovitz number leads to changes in the behaviors of normal and tangential strain rates from one combustion regime to another. The differences in displacement speed statistics for different choices of RPV affect the behaviors of the normal strain rate due to flame propagation and curvature stretch. The relative thickening/thinning of the reaction layers of the major species has been explained in terms of the statistics of effective normal strain rate experienced by the >-isosurfaces for different choices of RPVs.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000445647700007

AEM electrolysis can be integrated with intermittent and sustainable energy sources, utilize low-cost electrocatalysts and other inexpensive components in stacks. The sporadic investigation on catalysts and membrane development of AEM electrolysis enable it still under the early stage of development. To enable commercially viable hydrogen generation, deeper understanding and improvement of AEM electrolysis technology is imperative, including power efficiency, stack feasibility, mem-brane stability, ion conductivity, robustness and cost reduction. In this review, the basic principles, progress and challenges of AEM are discussed. We highlight recent achievements in electrocatalysts, alkaline exchange membranes, ionomers, and the resulting AEM electrolyser performance. In particular, development challenges facing AEM electrolysis are summarized. Hopefully, this review paper will attract additional interest to close technical gaps, while providing practical research recommendations for AEM electrolysis research, leading to scalable hydrogen production.									41	2	0	0	1	0	42			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000685249000003

Results revealed that both tension stress (e.g., 120 and 200 MPa) and cathodic protection (e.g.,-0.8,-1.0 and-1.2 V with respect to a saturated silver/silver chloride electrode) could greatly deteriorate coating protective performance, including barrier properties, water uptake and diffusion as well as delaminated area, and meanwhile their harmful impacts could become more pronounced with the prolongation of immersion time. The interactive effect of the two factors on coating degradation was shown to be associated with their respective contribution. In addition, the degradation rate for the coating at the potentials of-0.8 and-1.0 V depended largely on the main reaction rate of oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution, and the predominant control procedure of the two reactions could be reversed by the critical tension stress of 120 MPa.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000618783200001

Traditional CO2 capture methods employ temperature or pressure swings; however, electrochemical swings, in which an applied potential modulates nucleophilicity, are also possible to mediate the capture and release of CO2. In contrast to the breadth of electrochemical CO2 reduction research, electrochemically mediated CO2 capture and concentration is an emerging field. Although some aspects are reminiscent of those in CO2 reduction, like local pH gradients and (bi)carbonate equilibria, ultimately electrochemical CO2 capture and concentration poses its own unique challenges that will benefit from insights from intercalative batteries, redox flow batteries, and biomimetic/-inspired design, among other fields. After an introduction to carbon capture and current chemical strategies, this Review highlights promising emerging electrochemical methods to enable CO2 capture and concentration; specifically discussed are organic redox, transition metal redox, and pH swings. It closes with an outlook and discussion of future research challenges for electrochemically mediated capture.									39	1	0	0	3	0	39			2155-5435			WOS:000589939900063

In this study, the surface chemistry of sewage sludge-derived biochar (SSB) was regulated by controlled pyrolysis and SSB was used for PMS activation and oxidation of antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP). SSB-20-120 achieved high CIP removal efficiencies in both batch test (94.2%) and continuous column test (96.3%) with PMS. The species and contents of Fe, N and O as active sites on SSB and their relationships with generated ROS (SO4(center dot-), (OH)-O-center dot, and O-1(2)) for CIP degradation were comprehensively identified. Fe(0), -OH, C = O and the pairwise interaction among Fe(0), Fe(II) and Fe(III) were responsible for SO4 center dot- generation. Besides, pyrrolic N, graphitic N and the co-effect among pyridinic N, pyrrolic N and graphitic N exerted positive effects on (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- generation simultaneously. Meanwhile, Fe(II), Fe(III), pyrrolic N, graphitic N, lattice O with -OH, lattice O with C = O, the interactions among Fe(0), Fe(II) and Fe(III) as well as pyridinic N, pyrrolic N and graphitic N contributed to the production of (OH)-O-center dot coupling with O-1(2). Moreover, SO4 center dot- and O-1(2), as well as the co-effects of (OH)-O-center dot with SO4 center dot- and (OH)-O-center dot with O-1(2) were in favor of CIP degradation. This research provided new insights into the biochar synthesis, structure evolution, and the generation mechanism of reactive oxygen species from PMS activation. Outcomes are beneficial to sewage sludge utilization and developing low-cost catalysts for wastewater remediation.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000840985400002

Nonetheless, their intrinsic electrochemical activity and electrical conductivity are poor, which hinder their applications in energy conversion and storage. In catalytic applications, metal compounds derived from PB/PBAs have a lot of advantages, such as outstanding stability, selectivity, and electrical conductivity. Furthermore, they can be used as electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion, while having preferable electronic conductivity, sufficient catalytic active sites, as well as a larger specific surface area and tunable size to achieve an optimized performance. This review summarizes the current achievements of PB/PBA-derived metallic nanomaterials, as well as the existing limitations, urgent challenges and future development.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0009-2673	1348-0634		WOS:000763582300004

To commercialize this attractive technique, designing cost-effective, highly efficient, and stable electrocatalysts is desired. Perovskite oxides have been widely applied in many fields as efficient and low-cost catalysts due to their flexible compositions and structures, offering considerable opportunities and strategies to design desired electrocatalysts. In this Review, we present emerging strategies mainly based on our group's works about electrochemical water splitting for developing perovskite-based electrocatalysts to enhance the intrinsic and apparent activity of water splitting. The relationship between the composition/structure and the electrochemical activity of these materials is established for the rational design of more practical water-splitting electrocatalysts.									28	2	0	0	0	0	28			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000574904900010

Thirteen current peaks can be distinguished in sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide. With respect to the pH sensitivity of RuO2 electrodes, we considered charge calculations, peak currents, and apparent diffusion coefficients. The nature of the Ru(II) oxidation was clarified by Ru(I)-Ru(III) species.									16	0	0	0	4	0	16			2090-3529	2090-3537		WOS:000425001200001

Concentration of the zinc precursor in the reaction mixture had a strong effect on the final morphology of the ZnO nanostructures. While a low precursor concentration results in triangular morphology, high precursor concentrations favor rod-like morphologies of the nanostructures. The room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra of both nanostructures are dominated by the green emission attributed to the oxygen vacancy (Vo) related donor-acceptor transition. Presence of several infrared (IR) inactive vibrational modes in the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) absorption spectra of the samples indicates a breakdown of translational symmetry in the nanostructures induced by native defects. Possible mechanisms of the morphology evolution and the origin of observed visible emissions in the nanostructures are discussed.									40	1	0	0	4	0	40			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000262332700047

Aliphatic poly(ester-urethane)								POLYMER				38	16			4019	4031		10.1016/S0032-3861(96)00984-6				AUG 1997	1997	The photochemical behaviour of aliphatic-based poly(ester-urethanes) is investigated. Polymer samples are submitted to irradiation in the presence of oxygen in conditions of long wavelength irradiation (lambda > 300 nm) or short wavelength irradiation (lambda = 254 nm). The evolution of the structure of photooxidized polymers is monitored by FTi.r. analysis of thin samples and the different photoproducts formed are identified. It is shown that long wavelength irradiations provoke an induced oxidation of urethane functions. This reaction is initiated by hydrogen atom abstraction on the methylene groups in the alpha position of nitrogen atoms. On irradiation at short wavelength, the results provide evidence for a dual mechanism for photooxidation: induced oxidation and direct photolysis of the urethane groups following three possible photoscissions that involve the homolysis of C-N and C-O bonds.

In less acidic solutions the films show only partial transient rectification or else fully reversible transient behavior, together with Koutecky-Levich-type steady-state behavior. Experimental studies, as a function of Ru(NH3)63+ concentration, solution pH, film thickness, voltammetric sweep rate and electrode rotation rate, show that these unusual phenomena are related to: (1) transient uptake of Ru(NH3)63+, apparently in place of H+, during film-based Ir(IV/III) cycling; (2) Donnan exclusion of Ru(NH3)63+ from the reduced film under steady-state conditions; and/or (3) film-based diffusional inhibition of Ru(NH3)63+ reduction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:A1993KP53300025

The allylic hydroxylation of the starting cycloalkenecarboxylates is carried out by using R. oryzae resting cells entrapped in alginate beads, in acetate buffer solution at 25 degrees C. The oxidation of the intermediate allylic alcohols to unsaturated ketones, performed by the laccase/TEMPO system, and the ene-reductase mediated hydrogenation of the alkene bond were carried out in the same reaction vessel in a sequential mode at 30 degrees C. Being entirely biocatalytic, our multistep procedure provides considerable advantages in terms of selectivity and environmental impact over reported chemical methods.									18	0	0	0	3	0	19			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000414147100013

However, only two species with published genomes are known to occupy this phylogenetic space, both within the genus Gloeobacter. Here, we describe nearly complete, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of an uncultured organism phylogenetically placed near Gloeobacter, for which we propose the name Candidatus Aurora vandensis {Au'ro.ra. L. fem. n. aurora, the goddess of the dawn in Roman mythology; van.de'nsis. N.L. fem. adj. vandensis of Lake Vanda, Antarctica}. The MAG of A. vandensis contains homologs of most genes necessary for oxygenic photosynthesis including key reaction center proteins. Many accessory subunits associated with the photosystems in other species either are missing from the MAG or are poorly conserved. The MAG also lacks homologs of genes associated with the pigments phycocyanoerethrin, phycoeretherin and several structural parts of the phycobilisome. Additional characterization of this organism is expected to inform models of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.									11	0	0	0	11	0	12			1751-7362	1751-7370		WOS:000534278500004	32424249

The conventional process is based on ECR and an oxygen evolution re-action (OER), and it requires a high amount of energy because of its higher thermodynamic and practical operation voltage. By contrast, the new co-electrolytic process employs an AOR instead of an OER, and a decreased energy consumption (maximum 34.04%) is observed with the addition of ammonia. The new process provides advantages with respect to its lower energy consumption and controllable hydrogen and carbon monoxide ratio. We also found that this syngas production method, in which the NH3 concentration and applied current can be controlled, produces syngas with different H2 and CO ratios, it is comparable to that used in the conventional Fischer-Tropsch process.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729813100002

As a proof of concept, easily modifiable screen-printed electrodes were used in this unified operando synchrotron setup for a trade-off between convenience of electrochemical anodization and spectroscopic data acquisition. Monitoring of chemical and structural transformations at the electrode surface during initial anodic electrode polarization shows stability for MNCN with M = Co, Ni, Co0.9Ni0.1 and Mn. While MnNCN is inactive, CoNCN emerges as the most active representative of the series. CuNCN displays pronounced side reactions and the formation of a surface copper oxide layer leading to lower current density attributed to water oxidation, as evident from an irreversible variation of the CuNCN redox behaviour in rotating ring-disc voltammetry. Furthermore, the accompanying structural and vibrational spectroscopy properties of the different MNCN compounds were explored with complementary ex situ analytical methods.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000441151700049	29978162

In nature, the ample valence of transition metal endows impressive chemical and structural multiplicity for mixed-component oxides, demonstrated here by TMVs. Given that there are few reviews on TMVs for LIBs, we aim to exhaustively summarize cutting-edge breakthroughs on structures, fabrications, performances and mechanisms of TMVs in LIBs in the past twenty years, with remarks and outlooks on the future explorations. Specifically, here we provide holistic synthesis guidelines for nanoscale vanadates, which can accelerate rational design of novel TMVs bypassing pitfalls. Mechanistic insights enlightened by defects of existed work are also discussed for better illuminating the complicated materials transformation correlated to electrochemistry in the future. Utilizing the LIBs as paradigms to accumulate knowledge in all aspects, TMVs as a broad family can be promoted to other rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors and electrocatalysis readily.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2405-8297			WOS:000621356400005

Carbon monoxide (CO) is one key desired product of the CO2RR Herein, a Mn-based heterogeneous catalyst by depositing MnO nanoparticles on three-dimensional N-doped graphene aerogels (NGAs) is synthesized. The catalyst exhibits a negligible onset potential of -0.27 V (vs RHE). This onset potential is 12.5% lower than that of bulk Au electrodes. Moreover, the higher Faradaic efficiency for CO is 86% at a potential of -0.82 V (vs RHE) and better stability over at least 10 h. The excellent CO2RR performance can be attributed to the large specific area of the unique 3D crumpled porous NGA nanostructure, the synergistic effect of well-crystallized MnO active sites, and effective hydrogen evolution reaction suppression from nitrogen doping. The enhancement effect is also revealed by the density functional theory method. Our results highlight a promising new class of low-cost, abundant electrocatalysts for synthetic fuels from CO2.									17	2	0	0	2	0	19			2168-0485			WOS:000526592900031

The Al-doped PbO2 electrode showed high electrochemical activity, oxygen evolution potential, radical utilization rate, reusability and safety. The influence factors on CAP degradation with the Al-doped PbO2 electrode were investigated in detail, and under the optimal conditions the removal rates of CAP and TOC reached 87.30% and 52.06% in acid conditions after 2.5 h electrolysis with a 0.2 mol dm(-3) Na2SO4 at a current density of 30 mA cm(-2), respectively. The electrochemical degradation of CAP at Al-doped PbO2 electrode electrode followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The degradation mechanism was proposed by cyclic voltammograms tests and it was deduced that hydroxyl radicals generated in the electrochemical process played a key role in oxidizing CAP. Finally, based on the reaction products identified, a possible degradation pathway including radical reaction, ring open and mineralization was proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

O 1s, O2s, In 4d core level and valence band spectra were monitored at photon energies 660, 245, 150, and 73 eV to see their evolution with UHV treatments (heating, sputtering and exposure of oxygen). Reduction of the surface layer to nearly metallic indium was found with thermal treatment at T > 300 degrees C. This surface demonstrates high reactivity to reversible oxidation/reduction processes. This was evidenced by evolution of the O 2s core level peak and of the band gap emission intensity. In spite of such surface reduction it was found that within a probing depth of < 10 A the material displays spectral features characteristic of stoichiometric In2O3. We tentatively explain such behavior in terms of the In2O3 crystallographic structure and some conclusions relating to gas-sensing properties were made. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Pt is a highly efficient ORR electrocatalyst, but its large-scale application is severely prohibited by the high cost. In the pursuit of cost-effective electrocatalysts, it is urgent to develop non-noble metal ORR catalysts. Herein, we report a facile strategy for synthesizing an ORR electrocatalyst based on ultrafine bimetallic FeCo nanoparticles (NPs) anchoring on N-doped porous carbon matrix (FeCo-NC). By optimizing the ratio of Fe and Co, the FeCo-NC-1 catalyst exhibits excellent performance for ORR with the half-wave potential of 0.84 V and limiting current density of -5.3 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. When applied to Zn-air batteries, FeCo-NC-1 catalyst possesses a high open-circuit potential (1.50 V) and large specific capacity (726.2 mA h g(-1)) with a good long-term stability and methanol-tolerant capability, which are even superior to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The first-principle calculations indicate the bimetallic FeCo-NC has stronger O-2 adsorption than the single metal nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts (Fe-NC and Co-NC), which is the primary reason for the better ORR performance. We believe this work can be helpful for the development of inexpensive and high-efficient ORR electrocatalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, an easy and highly scalable method to prepare MoS2 nanoparticles embedded in 3D partially reduced (pr) graphene oxide (GO) aerogel microspheres (MoS2/prGOAMs) with controlled morphology and composition is described. Given their peculiar center-diverging mesoporous structure, which allows easy access to the active sites and optimal mass transport, and their efficient electron transfer facilitated by the intimate contact between the MoS2 and the 3D connected highly conductive pr-GO sheets, these materials exhibit a remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Ni atoms, either as single Ni atoms or NiO aggregates are then introduced in the MoS2/prGOAMs hybrids, to facilitate water dissociation, which is the slowest step in alkaline HER, producing a bifunctional catalyst. After optimization, Ni-promoted MoS2/prGOAMs obtained at 500 degrees C reach a remarkable eta(10) (overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2)) of 160 mV in 1 m KOH and 174 mV in 0.5 m H2SO4. Moreover, after chronopotentiometry tests (15 h) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the eta(10) value improves to 147 mV in alkaline conditions, indicating an exceptional stability.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000765158100001	35253364

Here, it is reported that agglomerates of large ruthenium phosphide (RuP) particles (L-RP, approximate to 32 nm) show outstanding HER performance in pH-universal electrolytes, which particularly demonstrates a surprisingly higher intrinsic activity and durability than small nanoparticles of RuP (S-RP, approximate to 3 nm) or metallic Ru on carbon supports. This is especially true in basic media, achieving electrocatalytic activity comparable to or even outperforming that of Pt/C, as reflected by lower overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2), smaller Tafel slope, larger exchange current density, and higher turnover frequency while maintaining 200 h stable operation. Calculations suggest that Delta G(H*) of RuP is much closer to zero than that of metallic Ru, and phosphorous doping is proven to enhance the rate of proton transfer in HER, contributing in part to the improved activity of RuP. The better performance of L-RP than that of S-RP is ascribed largely to the stabilization of the P species due to the lowered surface energy of large particles. Furthermore, the relatively low-cost materials and facile synthesis make L-RP/C a highly attractive next-generation HER electrocatalyst.									165	8	0	0	7	0	167			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000445327500002	30132992

The relationship of Ni3Al contents, microstructural evolution, and mechanical properties of W-Ni3Al alloys were also clarified. The results show that the milled powder has a lamellar structure and cold welding phenomenon. This structure encloses a small amount of ethanol, and this causes an Al2O3 phase to form when it undergoes an oxidizing reaction of Ni3Al with oxygen in ethanol during ball milling and drying. The W-rich phase is the network structure, and this structure is finer and denser with an increase in Ni3Al contents as a result of the grain refining effect of Al2O3 particles and the densification effect of liquid sintering. Under a load, the Al2O3 particles at the interface of W/binder phases increase the resistance of crack growth and compressive strain, which improves the mechanical properties and deformability of W-Ni3Al alloys. The Ni3Al binder provides a new strategy for improving the mechanical properties of tungsten alloys.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2053-1591		WOS:000625108000001

Low/high H-2 (D-2) desorption rates at room temperature in vacuum quantitatively correspond to low/high exchange current densities for the HOR/HER in electrochemistry. In view of the "volcano plot" concept, these represent two surfaces that adsorb hydrogen atoms, H-ad, too strongly and too weakly, respectively. Atomically smooth, vacuum annealed model surfaces are the closest approximation to the idealized slab geometries typically studied by density functional theory (DFT). A predictive volcano plot based on DFT-based adsorption energies for the H-ad intermediates agrees well with the experiments if two things are considered: (i) the steady-state coverage of H-ad intermediates and (ii) local variations in film thickness. The sluggish HER/HOR kinetics of Ru(0001) allows for excellent visibility of cyclic voltammetry (CV) features even in H-2-saturated solution. The CV switches between a H-ad-and a OHad-/O-ad-dominated regime, but the presence of H-2 in the electrolyte increases the H-ad-dominated potential window by a factor of two. Whereas in plain electrolyte two electrochemical adsorption processes compete in forming adlayers, it is one electrochemical and one chemical one in the case of H-2-saturated electrolyte. We demonstrate and quantitatively explain that dissociative H-2 adsorption is more important than H+ discharge for H-ad formation in the low potential regime on Ru(0001).									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000412348100004

Determining the Electrochemically Active Area of IrOx Powder Catalysts in an Operating Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzer								ECS Transactions				69	17			877	81		10.1149/06917.0877ecst				2015	2015	Iridium oxide is one of the most common anode catalysts in commercial PEM electrolyzers for its high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability. Unfortunately, benchmarking iridium oxide OER catalysts has proven difficult since IrO2 cannot undergo proton underpotential deposition, which makes it difficult to estimate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). In this work, we propose a method to calculate the electrochemically active surface area of iridium oxide in an operating PEM electrolyzer. A constant of 601 muC/cm2 was obtained using powder electrocatalysts by correlating the pseudocapacitive charge and electrochemically active surface area of the iridium oxide. This allowed us to determine the catalyst specific and mass activities in an operating PEM electrolyzer.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1938-5862			INSPEC:15991709

Here, we have propounded copper sulfide-coupled cobalt sulfide nanosheets grown on 3D nickel as an electrocatalyst for hydrogen (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions. The formation of djurleite copper sulfide with a Cu vacancy enables faster H+ ion transport and shows improved HER activity with a remarkably lower overpotential of 164 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), whereas cobalt-incorporated copper sulfide undergoes cation exchange during synthesis and shows elevated OER activity with a lower overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) for the OER. Moreover, Cu2-xS/Co is said to have a hybrid CoS-CoS2 interface and provide Co2+ active sites on the surface and enable the fast adsorption of intermediate species (OH*, O*, and OOH*), which lowers the potential requirement. The copper vacancy and cation exchange with a hybrid CoS-CoS2 structure are helpful in supplying more surface reactive species and faster ion transport for the HER and OER, respectively. The full-cell electrolyzer requires a very low potential of 1.58 V to attain a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), and it shows excellent stability for 50 h at 100 mA/cm(2) as confirmed by the chronopotentiometry test.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000823423700001	35762731	
J	Menard, S.; Wurm, J.								Effect of anode geometry on additive consumption								Galvanotechnik				99	5			1116	20						May 2008	2008	When using insoluble anodes, evolution of oxygen, the main anode reaction, is accompanied by an undesirable oxidative breakdown of organic additives. By so-called screening-off of the anode surface, access of the additives to the active anode surface is decreased. This screening is brought about by fixing fine-gauge bars which only slightly reduce the active anode surface area. Used in printed circuit board processing, this concept resulted in reduced rate of additive consumption and an extension of the bath life.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0016-4232			INSPEC:10245222

Inspired by the edge-state-enhanced conductivity in topological nodal-line semimetals (NLSs) and the recent advances in synthesizing the NLS Cu2Si sheet, we report the super performance of CO2 reduction on Cu2Si nanoribbons. Using first-principles calculations, we have found that Cu2Si nanoribbons with an armchair edge (labeled as A > CuSi) and a zigzag edge ending with Cu or Si (labeled as Z > Cu and Z > Si) have a strong reduction ability to activate CO2 to *COOH with low barriers. Especially, Z > Si is most effective for further hydrogenation, displaying a capability of transferring eight electrons to produce CH4 with a low free energy change of 0.24 eV. Furthermore, the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction can also be suppressed on Z > Si, exhibiting excellent performance and good selectivity for CO2 reduction.									11	2	0	0	0	0	12			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000458348600016

The influence of the pretreatment of the lead substrate and of the organic additives in the electrolyte for deposition of lead-cobalt coatings on this process has been studied. On the basis of the cyclic voltammograms obtained, information about the corrosion rate of the composite anodes in the lead dioxide region has been deduced. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations showed a nucleation and growth of 'ear-like' structures on the lead-cobalt composite coatings. The presence of such structures provides a larger surface area and leads to depolarisation of the oxygen evolution reaction respectively.									23	14	0	0	0	0	32			0020-2967			WOS:000235151600006

Along with its traditional application (phase transitions and chemical reactions in catalysts and their solid precursors, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the phase composition of the samples, and the characterization of energetic nonuniformity of solid surfaces), the differential scanning calorimetry may also be used to study the mechanisms of complex catalytic processes: the construction of thermochemical properties vs. reactivity diagrams, the discrimination of the mechanisms of the heterogeneous activation of gaseous molecules, the evolution of active surface sites and states of solid bulk, and the construction of kinetic models for complex heterogeneous-homogeneous processes.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0023-1584			WOS:000084606000009

The initial stage involves pore filling by electrolyte and steel corrosion due to oxygen reduction at the cermet coating. The galvanic effect between steel and cermet coating leads to local acidification of pore bottom that decreases galvanic effect and increases steel acid corrosion.EIS measurements on individual components of the steel/coating galvanic couple reveal that the overall impedance spectrum results from the parallel combination of both anodic and cathodic reactions. Steel corrosion defines the shape of the spectrum at the low frequency range. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

One of the hindrances for wide applications of electrocatalysis in H-2 pro-duction is the lack of freshwater resources. Comparatively, seawater splitting has become an effective approach for large-scale H-2 production due to its abundant reserves. However, the increased complexity of seawater content emerged more problems in electrocatalytic seawater splitting. Recently, various strategies have been reported on improving the performance of electrocatalysts applied in seawater. Herein, this review firstly analyzed the mechanisms and challenges of electrocatalytic seawater splitting to evolve H-2, and sum-marized the recent progress on H-2 production in electrocatalytic seawater splitting. Furthermore, suggestions for future work have been provided for guidance. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The synergy between HPM and ZIS contributes to the formation of a Z-type heterojunction structure and thus enhances redox capacity. Moreover, the sub-nanometer size of POM clusters endows molecular-level interfacial contact, which acts as an "electron bridge " ensuring faster interfacial charge transfer kinetics. Therefore, an impressive nearly 100% yield of benzaldehyde and 10.6 mmol.g(-1).h(-1) H-2-evolution rate are observed for POM/ZIS nanocomposites even under an anaerobic atmosphere with water as the solvent. This is the first application of POM-based materials in the anaerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol with concomitant H-2 production. This study expands the possibilities for designing multifunctional POM-based photocatalysts for economic and ecological photoredox applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000783879600004

Both complexes undergo a series of substitution reactions at oxidation state Rull and Ru'll when dissolved in aqueous triflic acid-trifluoroethanol solutions as monitored by UVNis spectroscopy, and the corresponding rate constants were determined. In particular, aqueous solutions of the Rul11-CI complex trans-[Ru-III(C1)(L-OMe-KN5)]2' (trans -124) generates a family of Ru aquo complexes, namely trans-[Ru-III(H2O)(L-OMe-K-N-5)](3+) (trans -2(3+), [Ru-III(H2O)(2)(-) (L-OMe-K-N-4)](3+) (trans-3(3+), and [Ru-III(Cl)(H2O)(L-OMe-(K-N4))](2+) (trans-4(2+). Although complex trans-4(2+) is a powerful water oxidation catalyst, complex trans-2(3+) has only a moderate activity and trans -334 shows no activity. A parallel study with related complexes containing the methyl-substituted ligand 6,6"(1-pyridin-2-ypethane-1,1-diy1)di-2,2'-bipyridine (L-Me) was carried out. The behavior of all of these catalysts has been rationalized based on substitution kinetics, oxygen evolution kinetics, electrochemical properties, and density functional theory calculations. The best catalyst, trans-4(2+), reaches turnover frequencies of 0.71 s(-1) using Celv as a sacrificial oxidant, with oxidative efficiencies above 95%.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000416158500028	29068156

We demonstrate how highly active, ultralow loading platinum (Pt) catalyst layers can be fabricated in a single, solution-processable step using electroless deposition. Growing Pt nanoparticles directly in the surface of a polyelectrolyte Nafion membrane yields a mechanically robust film with tunable optical reflectance and electronic conductivity. Small changes in the polymer hydration and Pt film thickness critically modulate nanoparticle interconnectivity near the percolation threshold. Conductive atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electron microscopy reveal how the film's dynamic nanoscale morphology allows control over bulk electrochemical and optical properties. Well-defined composition and structure make these layers an experimentally accessible model system for studying thin-film electrocatalyst architectures.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1932-7447			WOS:000384626800027

So far molecular adsorption, photocatalytic, organocatalytic, and electrical conductivity properties have been demonstrated to be surface-related or facet-dependent. Chemical etching and metal nanoparticle deposition can also be face-selective. Examples of these surface properties are presented. In general, ionic solids such as Cu2O nanocrystals exhibit more sharply different surface properties than those seen in metal nanoparticles. A better understanding of these facet-dependent properties is necessary to prepare nanomaterials with enhanced properties such as their catalytic activities.									120	3	0	0	5	0	121			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000330045400002	24406546

It is shown that the overall current transient of the oxidation at 1.4 V can be separated into the following contributions: (i) oxidation of the Pb(II)-containing phases into PbO2 which involves mainly an instantaneous nucleation and two-dimensional growth mechanism under charge-transfer control (2DIC); (ii) oxidation of the lead substrate into PbO under the diffusion control of oxygen ions, and (iii) evolution of oxygen on the electrode. The plumbous phases that participate in the oxidation process include an inner layer of (PbO+PbO . PbSO4) together with an adjacent part of an outer layer of PbSO4. Several electrochemical quantities of significance with respect to this oxidation process have been calculated, such as the thickness of the PbO2 formed, the degree of oxidation of the Pb(II)-containing phases, as well as the diffusion coefficient of O2- in the concurring oxidation process of Pb to PbO.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0378-7753			WOS:A1996VZ79100021

The cross-linking technique was applied to obtain a self-standing membrane with a high PW12 O-40(3-) content. Incorporation and structure retention of PW12O403- within the polymer matrix were confirmed by FT-IR and micro-Raman spectroscopy, and optical characteristics were investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy, which revealed successful construction of the metal-to-metal charge transfer (MMCT) unit. After deposition of MnOx oxygen evolving catalysts, photocurrent measurements under visible light irradiation verified the sequential charge transfer, Mn -> MMCT unit -> electrode, and the photocurrent intensity was consistent with the redox potential of the donor metal (Ce or Co). This method provides a new strategy for preparing integrated systems involving catalysts and photon-absorption parts for use with photo-functional materials.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1940-087X			WOS:000444913100100	30148502

Due to their extremely high reactivity and short lifetime, hydroxyl radicals are a special case, because cells have not developed enzymes to detoxify these most dangerous ROS. Thus, scavenging of hydroxyl radicals may only occur by accumulation of higher levels of simple organic compounds. Previous studies have demonstrated that plant-derived sugars show hydroxyl radical scavenging capabilities during Fenton reactions with Fe2+ and hydrogen peroxide invitro, leading to formation of less detrimental sugar radicals that may be subject of regeneration to non-radical carbohydrates invivo. Here, we provide further evidence for the occurrence of such radical reactions with sugars in planta, by following the fate of sucralose, an artificial analog of sucrose, in Arabidopsis tissues. The expected sucralose recombination and degradation products were detected in both normal and stressed plant tissues. Oxidation products of endogenous sugars were also assessed in planta for Arabidopsis and barley, and were shown to increase in abundance relative to the non-oxidized precursor during oxidative stress conditions. We concluded that such non-enzymatic reactions with hydroxyl radicals form an integral part of plant antioxidant mechanisms contributing to cellular ROS homeostasis, and may be more important than generally assumed. This is discussed in relation to the recently proposed roles for Fe2+ and hydrogen peroxide in processes leading to the origin of metabolism and the origin of life.									73	2	3	0	58	0	78			0960-7412	1365-313X		WOS:000355219800008	25891826

We studied the responses of PSII quantum yield (active fluorescence), carbon fixation (C-14 assimilation) and oxygen evolution (membrane inlet mass spectrometry) in Synechococcus WH8102 under moderate UV and PAR. PSII quantum yield decreased during exposure to moderate UV and UV+PAR, with response to the latter being faster (6.4 versus 2.8min, respectively). Repair processes were also faster when UV+PAR exposure was followed by moderate PAR (1.68min response time) than when UV was followed by very low PAR (10.5min response time). For the UV+PAR treatment, the initial decrease in quantum yield was followed by a 50% increase ("rebound") after 7min exposure, showing an apparent photoprotection induction. While oxygen uptake increased with PAR, it did not change under UV, suggesting that this oxygen-dependent mechanism of photoprotection, which may be acting as an electron sink, is not an important strategy against UV. We used propyl gallate, an antioxidant, to test for plastid terminal oxidase (ptox) or ptox-like enzymes activity, but it caused nonspecific and toxic effects on Synechococcus WH8102.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			0031-8655	1751-1097		WOS:000335261300007	24175996

Abundances of O, Mg, Cr, Y, Zr, Ba, Nd, and Eu (along with previously published abundances for C and Si) are presented. This study is one of the first to specifically examine planetary host stars for the heavy elements produced by neutron capture reactions. We find that the abundances in host stars are chemically different from both the standard solar abundances and the abundances in non-host stars in all elements studied, with enrichments over non-host stars ranging from 0.06 dex (for O) to 0.11 dex (for Cr and Y). Such abundance trends are in agreement with other previous studies of field stars and lead us to conclude that the chemical anomalies observed in planetary host stars are the result of normal galactic chemical evolution processes. Based on this observation, we conclude that the observed chemical traits of planetary host stars are primordial in origin, coming from the original nebula and not from a "pollution'' process occurring during or after formation, and that planet formation occurs naturally with the evolution of stellar material.									36	0	0	0	1	0	36			0004-637X			WOS:000258026100047

In order to mimic aspects of this microenvironment, [CoLDMA(CH3CN)(2)][BF4](2) (2) was synthesized, where LDMA is a dipyridyldiamine ligand with two dimethylamine bases in the secondary coordination sphere. Structural characterization of the corresponding aqua complexes establish hydrogen bonding between the bound water and pendant base(s). Cyclic voltammetry of [CoLDMA(CH3CN)(2)][BF4](2) (2) reveals enhanced oxidative current upon titration with water and controlled potential electrolysis confirms evolution of O-2. The related complex [CoLH(CH3CN)(2)][BF4](2) (1), which has the same primary coordination environment as 2 but lacks pendant bases, is inactive. The structural and electrochemical studies illustrate the role positioned proton relays can play in promoting redox reactivity.									19	1	0	0	2	0	19			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000431100300012	29732059

Here, a cage-confinement pyrolysis strategy is presented for the synthesis of ultrasmall tungsten carbide nanoclusters/nanoparticles. An RHO type zeolitic metal azolate framework MAF-6, possessing large nanocages and small apertures, is selected to confine the metal source W(CO)(6). High temperature pyrolysis gives tungsten carbide nanodusters/nanopartides with sizes ca. 2 nm, which can serve as an excellent electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. In 0.5 M H2SO4, it exhibits very low overpotential of 51 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 49 mV per decade, as well as the highest exchange current density of 2.4 mA cm(-2) among all tungsten/molybdenum-based catalysts. Moreover, it also shows excellent stability and antiaggregation behavior after long-term electrolytic process.									278	22	0	0	10	0	281			0002-7863			WOS:000399966000004	28376618

This report highlights recent insights into the nanoscale phase properties of gold-platinum (AuPt) nanoparticles, which serves as an example to shine a light on the importance of changes in physical and chemical properties in which nanoscale multimetallic materials may differ from their bulk counterparts. In contrast to the wide miscibility gap well known for the bulk gold-platinum system, the bimetallic nanoparticles have been demonstrated to exist in phases ranging from alloy, partial alloy, to phase segregation depending on the preparation conditions, the bimetallic composition, and the supporting materials. For AuPt nanoparticles supported on carbon materials, the nanoscale alloying or phase segregation is shown to be controllable by thermal treatment temperatures, which is not only evidenced by detailed analysis of the phase and surface properties, but also supported by theoretical modeling based on thermodynamic and density function theory. The understanding of the nanoscale phase properties can be correlated with the electrocatalytic activities for fuel cell reactions such as methanol oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction. Implications of the new insights to designing and nanoengineering the phase properties of multimetallic nanoparticles and catalysts are also briefly discussed.									110	3	0	0	4	0	112			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:000288220600002

Detailed modeling of the discharge development and evolution leads to the identification of a suitable scheme for chemical kinetics simulations. Such scheme has been exploited with the implementation of suitable numerical models of the chemical kinetics considering actually existing devices (DC discharges in point-plane, point to point or coaxial cylinder configuration, dielectric barrier discharges) and used to study the evolution of the discharge composition. As a first application we have chosen to simulate the chemical kinetics induced in a single isolated streamer and the results of this approach are examined within this paper. The interplay between different time scale processes is shown. The model allows also to investigate the dependence of chemical species density as a function of input parameters depending on actual discharge parameters. Many of our observations are directly relevant for a better understanding of the operating conditions during atmospheric pressure plasma processing. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

However, the route to the thermonuclear runaway has always been uncertain owing to the lack of a convective model consistent with the Urca process.We derive a formalism for convective motions involving two radial flows. This formalism provides a framework for convective models that guarantees self-consistency for chemistry and energy budget, allows time-dependence and describes the interaction of convective motions with the global contraction or expansion of the star. In the one-stream limit, we reproduce several already existing convective models and allow them to treat chemistry. We also suggest as a model easy to implement in a stellar evolution code.We apply this formalism to convective Urca cores in Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. We stress that in degenerate matter, nuclear reactions that change the number of electrons strongly influence the convective velocities. We point out the sensitivity of the energy budget on the mixing. We illustrate our model by computing stationary convective cores with Urca nuclei. We show that even a very small mass fraction of Urca nuclei (10(-8)) strongly influences the convective velocities.Finally, we present preliminary computations of the late evolution of a close to Chandrasekhar mass C+O white dwarf including the convective Urca process.					8th International Symposium on Nucle in the Cosmos (NIC8)8th International Symposium on Nucle in the Cosmos (NIC8)	JUL 19-23, 2004JUL 19-23, 2004		Vancouver, CANADAVancouver, CANADA	3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0375-9474			WOS:000230660500100

In the region of active dissolution a Tafel slope of 1/(30 +/- 3) mV-1 was measured. This value was found to be independent of acid concentration. A reaction mechanism is presented to explain this slope. It was found that tin dissolves both in the active and partly passive potential region in the form of bivalent tin. Oxidation to the tetravalent state seems to occur only at high anodic potentials. Oxygen evolution starts only at potentials above 3 V (vs. Hg2SO4/Hg). Analysis of the passivating film formed on the electrode surface using SEM, XRD, XPS and SIMS showed that the film is mainly tin oxide, SnO, mostly in an amorphic form.									28	1	0	0	0	2	31			0013-4686			WOS:A1992JE46200007

The cobalt oxide formation process was accomplished in alkaline solution (30 mM NaOH) containing millimolar concentrations of CoCl2 and ligand species such as sodium citrate. The cobalt oxide/hydroxide films were obtained either by voltage cycling between 0.4 and 1.1 V versus SCE or under potentiostatic conditions at moderate positive potentials (i.e. 0.5 V). The resulting electrodeposited film was characterized electrochemically in alkaline solutions by cyclic voltammetry and, independently of the electrodeposition procedure adopted, reveals three well-defined sets of redox waves related to the Co(OH)(2)/Co(2)o(3), Co(2)o(3)/CoOOH and CoOOH/CoO2 electrochemical transitions. The charge/discharge processes and the oxygen evolution reaction during continuous potential cycling were severely inhibited in the presence of increasing concentrations of electroinactive electrolytes (i.e. NaNO3, K2SO4, Na3PO4, etc.). The electrochemical behaviour of the electrodeposited cobalt oxide/hydroxide film in alkaline solution and in the presence of various organic molecules was also investigated.

We have processed a large amount of literature data through the Web of Science database. The bibliometric method was used to analyze the development trend and research hotspots over the past 10 years since the concept of single-atom catalysis was proposed in 2011. Results show that the field of single-atom catalysis is currently at a high-speed development stage. China is in a leading position in terms of comprehensive strength, with the largest number of publications and great influence. Most productive journals and institutions are ACS Catalysis and Chinese Acad. Sci. Single-atom catalysis has the most research results in the field of chemistry.

The materials were prepared using a two-step hydrothermal procedure. Catalytic activity of the materials was tested for the oxidation of 2-thiophenemethanol. OMS-2 prepared at a high-frequency limit of 5.5 GHz showed the highest conversion (50%) to the 2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde among all of the tested OMS-2 samples. The OMS-2 precursor showed remarkable conversion (89%) in the oxidation reaction. In addition, the OMS-2 materials and the precursor showed differences in oxygen evolution based on the thermal decomposition experiments, as well as differences in porosity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

To improve the activity, two-step annealing treatment in the temperature range from 550 degrees C to 800 degrees C was proposed for the Fe2O3 nanorods synthesized by hydrothermal method. This study reveals that the OER (oxygen evolution reaction) performance increases with the annealing temperature, which yields photocurrent density of 1.036 mA cm(-2) and ABPC (applied bias photon-to-current) efficiency of 0.86% under simulated solar illumination of 100 mW cm(-2) (AM 1.5G) condition at 1.23 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) at 800 degrees C. The second-step short time high temperature annealing treatment has a primary contribution on the fine-tune crystallite size and the diffusion and incorporation of Sn atoms. In addition, examining the corresponding resistance properties reveal a substantial improvement in the conductivity within the hematite film and at the conducting interface, and a suppressed charge carrier recombination process.

Incorporation of organically modified montmorillonite into polystyrene, (PS) matrix not only increased thermal stability but also the probability of radical recombination, disproportionation and carbonization reactions causing increase in the char yield. Exfoliation of organoclay in BE phase of PS-BE matrix affected the extent of radical coupling and disproportionation reactions between the thermal degradation products of PS and organic modifier. In addition, the evolution of BE based products was hindered partly and the attacks of HBr to epoxy units generating H2O became more efficient. During the pyrolysis of polystyrene/organoclay nanocomposite involving both BE and Sb2O3, the relative yields diagnostic products of both oxybromides and bromides of antimony were increased significantly in the temperature region where PS decomposition took place which in turn increased the efficiency of radical scavenging and reduced peak heat release rate while increasing limiting oxygen index.

However, the low separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers and the sluggish reaction kinetics seriously restrict the efficiency of the organic photosynthesis of desired compounds. Herein, a facile strategy is adopted to regulate the boron carbon nitrides (BCN) semiconductors by hydrogen reduction to precisely tune the structural and surface properties. The reduced BCN materials can effectively enhance charge separation and migration as well as promote O-2 activation and mass transfers. As a result, this BCN catalyst therefore displays a remarkable enhancement in photosynthesis of aromatic aldehydes from the alcohols with high conversion and selectivity compared to pristine BCN.									27	2	0	0	5	0	28			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000549171400001

Polyetherimide hollow fiber membranes were coated with a solution containing carboxyl-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes and poly(ether-b-amide). Electron microscopy images confirmed the presence of a layer of percolating carbon nanotubes on the surface of the membranes. Cyclic voltammetry and linear swept voltammetry experiments showed that these membranes are able to drive the reactions of hydrogen evolution, and oxygen reduction, making them a cheaper, and greener substitute for platinum based cathodes in microbial bioelectrochemical systems. Water flux and molecular weight cut off experiments indicated that the electro-chemically active coating layer does not affect the ultrafiltration performance of the membrane.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0376-7388	1873-3123		WOS:000413270200037

In addition, EIS allows quantification of the electrode performance. However, the utilization of potential-dependent EIS measurements is more convenient to explore electrochemical phenomena occurring at the electrode interface. Herein, we discuss the advantages in using multiple polarized EIS for performance evaluation of three classical electrode types: capacitive, pseudocapacitive, and battery-like, employed in supercapacitor devices. The results are compared with those obtained by direct current methods displaying good agreement in the case of capacitive electrodes. On the other hand, pseudocapacitive and battery-like electrodes exhibit strong ohmic effects and non-reversible processes when the power law equation is utilized. Both of these issues can be circumvented by using potential-dependent EIS.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000687635800001

Two different configurations were prepared: 2-fold-coordinated Ni adatoms on top of the surface and Ni atoms incorporated into the octahedral sites of the support. Using temperature-programmed desorption, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy, we show that water is adsorbed and dissociated on the nickel adatoms at room temperature, resulting in Ni-OH species and surface hydroxyl groups. Nickel atoms incorporated into the support do not directly adsorb water but modify the electronic properties of the surface Fe, and water adsorbed on these sites has similar characteristics as that of water adsorbed on intrinsic surface defects. In both cases, the presence of Ni significantly alters the growth of the first water monolayer on Fe3O4(001).									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1932-7447			WOS:000472800500019

Herein, we firstly introduced a delafossite CuCoO2 to act as the support of noble metal Pt. The strong metal support interaction between Pt and CuCoO2, abundant hydroxide species and active sites on the surface of catalyst may be the key factors for enhanced performances of methanol oxidation. Pt-CuCoO2/C achieved a mass activity of 1.16 A mg(Pt)(-1), which obtained 3.02 times enhancement compared with commercial Pt/C (0.38 A mg(Pt)(-1)). The I-f/I-b value of Pt-CuCoO2/C is 1.96, much higher than that of Pt/C (0.76), demonstrating favorable anti-poisoning ability. After 200 times cycling, Pt-CuCoO2/C still maintained 77.1 % of its initial activity, exhibiting superior COads intermediate tolerance and stability. Low cost, better performances and stability of Pt-CuCoO2/C reveal that it can be seen as a hopeful catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-6549			WOS:000830644800004

Here, we show that paired reductive coupling of nitroaromatics into azoxy-aromatics and oxidative coupling of aromatic amines into azo-aromatics can be realized with high efficiency and selectivity employing the surface-hydroxylated Ni3Fe metal-organic framework (Ni3Fe-MOF-OH) bifunctional electrocatalyst. The competitive hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions are suppressed due to the adsorption of nitroarenes and anilines via surface hydroxyls of the electrocatalyst. Simultaneous cathodic and anodic N-N coupling of a wide range of nitroaromatics and aniline derivatives are realized with high conversion and selectivity at an overall bias of 1.4 V in an undivided cell in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Ni3Fe-MOF-OH displays a high stability and enables gram-scale synthesis of azo- and azoxy-aromatics with a satisfactory yield and Faraday efficiency, offering an efficient synthetic protocol for applications.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000716773800064

Co and Ni ions were concurrently coordinated with carboxyl groups and pyridyl nitrogen donors. Basic characterizations of the series of MOFs were investigated by diverse techniques. The developed NiCo-MOF consisted of mixed-valence Co(II)/ Co(III) and Ni(II)/Ni(III) and rich functional groups. The MOF exhibited a large specific surface area, evenly distributed nanocubes, and high electrocatalytic activity. Compared with the Ni-MOF, Co-MOF, and commercial Pt/C(20 %), the NiCo-MOF catalyst had improved electrocatalytic activity toward methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). High current density of 225 mA cm-2 at the potential of 1.6 V versus RHE in alkaline medium was achieved. Moreover, remarkable cycling stability in the MOR conditions was observed and only showed a slight decline after 5000 s.

The electrochemical performance of Au@Co3O4NAs is obviously superior to Co3O4NAs, which will open up a viable strategy for the design and fabrication of a bi-functional electrocatalyst for the overall reaction (CO2+ H2O -> CO + H-2+ O-2).									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000548246700043

The decomposition patterns of these xerogels, both in the presence and in the absence of oxygen are discussed in terms of the gaseous products' evolution under temperature-programmed (TP) reaction conditions, and diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS). The primary decomposition routes of residual alkoxide groups are: (i) auto-redox (CO, CO2) and dehydration (to olefins) under pyrolysis conditions: (ii) oxidative (CO, CO2) under flowing air. The decomposition of the Si-C bond upon heating, as monitored by all three techniques, follows a pattern independent of that of (CH) species from -OR groups. The Si-29 MAS/NMR of these materials is dominated by the so-called D-2 (Me2Si(OX)(2)), Q(3) ((OR)Si(OX)(3)) and Q(4) (Si(OX)(4)) resonances. Fairly homogeneous proton envelopes around Si centers are evident from the NMR spectra of these materials in the proton cross-polarization mode. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	JONES, DA; SICHEL, M; ORAN, ES								REIGNITION OF DETONATIONS BY REFLECTED SHOCKS								SHOCK WAVES				5	1-2			47	57		10.1007/BF02425035				JUN 1995	1995	Numerical simulations are used to study the diffraction, decay, and reignition that occurs when a detonation propagates past an increase in cross-sectional area in a rectangular tube. The computations solve the time-dependent two-dimensional equations describing a reactive flow in an argon-diluted stoichiometric hydrogen-oxygen mixture at atmospheric pressure. Previous studies have shown that soon after transmission to a larger area, the reaction front decouples from the leading shock and forms a decaying blast wave (''bubble'') in the larger tube. Then, depending on the initial conditions, the detonation either continues to decay or is reignited as the bubble reflects off confining surfaces. For a strongly overdriven initiating detonation, reignition occurs through an interaction between the bubble and the original contact surface. For a more weakly driven system, reignition can occur in two ways: either in the slip line and Mach stem of the Mach reflection formed when the bubble reflects off the bottom surface of the tube, or by multiple shock interactions that occur when the reflected bubble overtakes the initial detonation front. The computations show the evolution and development of the cellular structure of the steady detonation front.									32	7	0	0	0	0	40			0938-1287			WOS:A1995RF86400005

Independent of the Ag content, the anode behaviour is essentially determined by the electrolysis time. From a comparison of experimental data to a kinetic model for the Pb/PbOn/PbSO4 electrode, it is shown that the layer growth is first controlled by the solid state diffusion of SO42- ions, and then by a chemical step associated with a change in charge carriers, from O-upsilon(2+) vacancies in the PbOn sublayer into Pb2+ ions in the PbSO4 layer. In Mn2+-containing electrolytes the additional formation of MnO2 occurs under diffusion control of the Mn2+ oxidation, and it modifies both the layer properties and the kinetics of reactions.									22	5	0	0	1	0	24			0013-4686			WOS:A1995QZ39500002

Here we report a highly active and durable RuIrOx (x >= 0) nano-netcage catalyst formed during electrochemical testing by in-situ etching to remove amphoteric ZnO from RuIrZnOx hollow nanobox. The dispersing-etching-holing strategy endowed the porous nano-netcage with a high exposure of active sites as well as a three-dimensional accessibility for substrate molecules, thereby drastically boosting the electrochemical surface area (ECSA). The nano-netcage catalyst achieved not only ultralow overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER; 12 mV, pH = 0; 13 mV, pH = 14), but also high-performance overall water electrolysis over a broad pH range (0 similar to 14), with a potential of mere 1.45 V (pH = 0) or 1.47 V (pH = 14) at 10 mA cm(-2). With this universal applicability of our electrocatalyst, a variety of readily available electrolytes (even including waste water and sea water) could potentially be directly used for hydrogen production.									131	12	0	0	4	0	132			2041-1723			WOS:000492835100013	31653856

However, the air-cathode reaction-oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has limited the development of ZAB technology. In this study, a hollow carbon catalyst, NOC-1000-1, was prepared by pyrolysis of a mixture of a N-enriched Zn/bispyrozolate-based metal-organic framework and urea to replace the labile Pt-based catalysts for ORR. The employment of sacrifical urea eliminated the requirement for complicated post-treatment compared to the template method. Combined with self-activation (Zn evaporation), the obtained carbon showed a micro- and mesopore-dominant hierarchical structure coexisting with some macropores. Moreover, the doped N and O species were also tailored in a preferable configuration for ORR by simply screening the pyrolysis conditions. Under the synergistic effect of the preferable N and O configurations and pore structure, the derived carbon catalyst displayed superior ORR activity of 0.977 V onset potential and 0.867 V half-wave potential; these values are slightly better than those of the 20% Pt/C benchmark catalyst (0.985 and 0.861 V, respectively). Flexible solid-state ZABs were further assembled by employing the derived carbon catalyst as an air-cathode, and they exhibited a higher peak power density of 100.92 mW cm(-2) than a 20% Pt/C-RuO2 battery as well as previously reported similar batteries and very high stability for up to 30 h. The flexible solid-state ZABs could drive a red light-emitting diode and run a 130-type motor for hours, which indicates their promising applications in real-world technologies.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000698753200001	34558569

As one of the most potential substitutes for Pt-based materials, pyrite cobalt selenide (CoSe2) still has shortcomings in terms of HER performance possibly due to its unfavorable hydrogen adsorption characteristics. Metal cation doping has been considered as one of the most available methods to modulate the electronic structure of electrocatalysts. Herein, non-transition metal tin (Sn) doped CoSe2 nanowire arrays grown on carbon cloth have been constructed and fabricated via a simple gas-phase selenization treatment of hydroxide precursor. The successful doping of Sn element into CoSe2 nanowires was confirmed by many experimental results. The as-prepared catalyst shows an obviously enhanced HER performance in alkaline media. Compared with pristine CoSe2, the over potential of Sn doped catalyst with optimal doping content decreases from 189 mV to 117 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope declines from 94 mV dec(-1) to 86 mV dec(-1), as well as shows long-term durability for 100 h. Experimental results and further density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that Sn doping can improve the ability of charge transfer and increase the electrochemical surface area, as well as optimize the hydrogen adsorption energy, all of which are instrumental in HER performance improvement. This work not only provides atomic-level insight into regulating the electronic structure of transition metal selenides by main group metal doping, but also broadens the avenue of developing high-efficiency and stable non-precious metal catalysts.

Transition metal phosphides (e.g., Ni12P5 nanoparticles) may be used as non-precious earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the H-2 evolution reaction, but their poor electronic conductivity and small surface area hinder efficient catalytic H-2 production. In this research, we demonstrate for the first time the facile synthesis of porous carbon/Ni12P5 (C/NiP-C) composites with the dispersion of Ni12P5 nanoparticles onto a conductive porous carbon support in an ionic surfactant hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)-mediated ethanol solution. The CTAB plays dual roles in the synthesis including (1) the introduction of carbon to increase the conductivity of the synthetic materials and (2) the formation of uniform Ni12P5 phosphides through the interaction between the H2PO2- anion, Ni2+, and C19H42N+ cation dissociated from CTAB. The obtained C/NiP-C composites may function as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with excellent HER performance (: 63 mV, (10): 176 mV, Tafel slope: 100 mV dec(-1), wherein represents the onset overpotential and (10) represents the overpotential required for a current density (j) value of -10 mA cm(-2)) compared with the NixPy composites synthesized in pure ethanol (: 160 mV, (10): 392 mV, Tafel slope: 154 mV dec(-1)), the C/NiP-P composites synthesized in a P123-mediated ethanol solution (: 75 mV, (10): 286 mV, Tafel slope: 210 mV dec(-1)), and the C/NiP-F composites synthesized in a F127-mediated ethanol solution (: 80 mV, (10): 302 mV, Tafel slope: 189 mV dec(-1)). The enhanced HER performance can be attributed to the synergistic effects resulting from the unique structure of the porous C support and the well dispersed Ni12P5 nanoparticles.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000461592700020

A significant increase in the material search space is possible by utilizing "Non-Native polymorphs (NNP)," which are materials that have different translational symmetry with respect to NP. As the NNP have a distinct coordination structure from that of the NP, critical material properties can be anticipated to be different, making NNP a potential substitute material for the aforementioned applications, which are the focus of this review. To obtain a structure-function relationship, systematic approaches to the synthesis of NNP has been demonstrated. Following certain generalities behind NNP, we classify synthesis techniques into few categories with the hope of rationalizing the underlying mechanism of these synthesis and stabilization strategies. We discuss the utility of NNPs in the context of electrochemical water electrocatalytic reactions. Typically, the NNPs have more open volume space enabling lower lithium-ion diffusion barrier, higher lithium-ion binding energies, thereby making NNP efficient in the context of energy storage material. However, NNP have lesser stability than the NP and methods to calibrate and improve the stability of NNP are important. Overall, the discussion of polymorphic materials by demarcating them as NP and NNP provides a systematic approach towards modulating material properties as a trade-off between thermodynamics and kinetics of physicochemical processes. Finally, the challenges and perspectives in this emerging field are discussed.

However, achieving high specific surface areas of nanostructured WCs with a small size and controlled morphology remains a considerable challenge. In the present studies, WC nanorods with a diameter and length of approximately 50 and 100-300 nm, respectively, were prepared. The morphology of the obtained WO3 center dot H2O was controlled by adding citric acid to the reaction solution. The secondary growth of WO3 center dot H2O crystals was efficiently restrained because double-walled carbon nanotubes were homogenously dispersed in the solution. When the WO3 center dot H2O nanorods were heated in air and carbonized in a nitrogen atmosphere, small-sized WC nanorods with a high specific surface area (32.2 m(2) g(-1)) were obtained. Furthermore, the obtained catalysts displayed improved electrocatalytic activity and stable anti-poisoning performance when the WC nanorods were used as a support for loading platinum nanoparticles. All these results indicate the potential application of WC nanorods in electrochemistry and related fields.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000418373300067

Reduction of 1 by NO2- has been found to be kinetically insignificant, but that of 2 is rapid, quantitative and follows the sequence Mn(III)Mn(IV) k1 --> (Mn(III))2 k2 --> Mn(II)Mn(III) fast --> 2Mn(II). In the presence of an excess of NO2-, first-order kinetics was observed at 830 nm, but a biphasic profile at 525 nm.

But how sustainable are catalysts themselves? In this contribution we will give a perspective overview of the progress in dematerializing catalysts, i.e., in using less (critical) materials to deliver the same (or better) level of functionality. This may be accomplished in many ways: improving the catalyst performance and durability by gaining insights in reaction, activation, and deactivation mechanisms; lowering the amount of critical or harmful catalytic components, e.g., by finding cheaper, more abundant, and sustainable substitutes; and making catalysts production and disposal processes more sustainable, e.g., by recycling. Material science and nanotechnology are two essential actors in this process, providing the tools to understand and optimize catalytic materials and processes, and to assess the environmental and toxicological impact of nanomaterials.									38	1	0	0	4	0	38			0360-0564		978-0-12-815087-0	WOS:000453678900001

The techniques used were cyclic voltammetry (CV), steady-state potentiostatic method, on line differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The chemical products: acetaldehyde and acetic acid were detected measuring the proper mass charge (m/z) ratios. These products were also confirmed by HPLC. The surface modification of composite electrodes by ruthenium nanoparticles promotes the formation of acetaldehyde. As shown by DEMS, the surface modification shifts the onset potential for oxygen evolution reaction on the Cu-PVC composite electrode towards more anodic values. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

By potentiostatic polarization under 5 V-Ag/AgCl, a dark red microporous layer was formed on the surface of the high-chromium alloy. The workpieces and electrolytes were examined and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Raman microscopy (RMS) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) to probe the electrochemical mechanism of layer formation. The results demonstrate that under the set conditions, Fe(VI) ions were generated from the anode. However, due to the consumption of OH- ions, Fe(VI) ions were decomposed into ferric hydroxide; in turn, ferric hydroxide had an autocatalytic effect on the decomposition of Fe(VI) ions. The anodic reaction steps were controlled by the mass transfer of OH- ions, and alternative transformation between Fe(VI) ions and ferric hydroxide accelerated the formation of a microporous layer.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1452-3981			WOS:000580810400018

A small single cell is therefore electrochemically analyzed by means of polarization behavior and impedance spectroscopy throughout a range of currents (0.01 A cm(-2) to 2.0 A cm(-2)) at two temperatures (60 degrees C and 80 degrees C) and eight compressions (0.77 MPa-3.45 MPa). Additionally, a computational model is utilized to support the analysis. The main findings are that cell compression has a positive effect on overall cell performance due to decreased contact resistances, but is subject to optimization. In this case, no signs of severe mass transport problems due to crushed transport layers are visible in either polarization curves or impedance plots, even at high currents. However, a Tafel plot analysis revealed more than one slope throughout the current range. The change in the Tafel slope is therefore discussed and connected to the electrochemical reaction or an ohmic contribution from a non-electrode component. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Thermal Stability and Kinetics of Decomposition of Hydrogen Polyoxides H2O3 and H2O4 in Peroxy Radical Condensates								RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A				96	6			1204	1214		10.1134/S0036024422060140				JUN 2022	2022	Experimental studies are performed of the kinetics of decomposition of peroxy radical condensates (PRC) under conditions of a rise in temperature according to a linear law and control during the process by measuring the pressure of gaseous products in a constant volume system. An original way of solving the inverse problem of non-isothermal kinetics is proposed that does not require transformation of experimental dependence P(T). Four stages of gas evolution during the decomposition of PRC are discovered, and their temperature intervals and kinetic characteristics are determined. The Raman spectra of peroxy radical condensates (PRC) are analyzed at different temperatures. Based on the results, it is proposed that the stages of decomposition be attributed to the decomposition reactions of hydrogen tetroxide H2O4 and trioxide H2O3. Temperature intervals of stability and kinetic characteristics of decomposition reactions of polyoxides H2O4 and H2O3 in the composition of PRC are established. The quantitative composition of freshly prepared condensates is determined.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0036-0244	1531-863X		WOS:000811215000012

It is essential to devise new inexpensive catalytic systems to reduce reaction time, increase the yield, and put a smaller burden on the environment. The discovery of nanomaterials has breathed fresh air into this area. Extraordinary surface-to-volume ratio and various quantum effects made these materials a promising al-ternative to the traditional catalysts. Particularly notable results come from implementing metal species arranged in 1D, which are referred to as nanowires (NWs). In this review, we illustrate their potential to catalyze various chemical transformations in organic chemistry. We demonstrate how NWs facilitate processes such as coupling and reduction. Furthermore, we show how these species can be used in elec-trochemistry and photo-catalysis. Finally, having described the advances in these areas, we envision the next steps which should be taken to bring this concept to the phase of commercial implementation. (c) 2021 The Authors.

In this paper, Ru and Ni dual-metal doped CoP (Ru, Ni-CoP) porous nanofibers were fabricated. Dual-metal doping can be more efficiently used to modulate the electronic structure than single-metal doping, thereby, achieving decreased water dissociation energy and optimized adsorption energy for different reaction intermediates. Consequently, Ru, Ni-CoP porous nanofibers exhibit highly enhanced bifunctional activities. The electrolytic cell based on Ru, Ni-CoP porous nanofibers, which is significantly superior to Pt/C||IrO2 pairs, requires a low voltage of 1.448 and 1.757 V at 10 and 500 mA cm-2, respectively. The electrolytic cell exhibits excellent long-term stability at 400 mA cm-2. This excellent activity and stability at high-current density provides the considerable potential for the practical applications of Ru, NiCoP porous nanofibers as high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts.									36	0	0	0	7	0	35			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000697031500006

Structure engineering is an efficient approach to tailoring the electrical conductivity and the quantities of active sites. Herein, a series of hierarchical NiCr hydroxide nanowire-assembled nanospheres with tunable crystallinity have been synthesized by hydrothermal method. The effect of Cr content on the structure and the electrochemical properties of NiCr hydroxides has been investigated. The axially aligned nanowires ensure the exposure of active sites; the crystalline/amorphous domain boundaries are intrinsically more active; the amorphous structure improves the electrical conductivity; the incorporation of Cr3+ promotes the charge transfer kinetics. The 10Cr-Ni(OH)(2) with the optimized Cr3+ content and domain boundaries shows the best catalytic performance with a reduction of 35 mV in onset potential relative to the alpha-Ni(OH)(2). In addition, the 10Cr-Ni(OH)(2) demonstrates good long-term working stability. (C) 2021ElsevierLtd. Allrightsreserved.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000670310900014

Although, it suffers from several obstacles such as voltage hysteresis and sluggish kinetics. In this paper, a new layered chalcogenide-based on dual anionic-redox reaction is reported. The newly designed layered NaCrSSe exhibits the capacity of almost all Na + intercalation/deintercalation (137 mAh g(-1) at 50 mA g(-1)), and a unique charge/discharge feature with a small polarization of 0.15 V and high energy efficiencies of similar to 92% in initial cycles. Furthermore, a superior high-rate charge capacity of 115.5mAh g(-1) (83.7% retention) was achieved at 27.8 degrees C (4000 mA g(-1)). Systematic characterization studies on structure evolution and DFT calculation show the charge compensation of S and Se anions during cycling. These results will enrich the anion redox chemistry and provide valuable information for developing new anion-redox based cathode materials with high capacity and fast kinetics.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000659445900003

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to study the compositions, structures and film morphologies of the electrodes. Electrocatalytic oxidation characteristics to phenol on the prepared electrodes were investigated by electrochemical method. The experimental results showed that compared with the Ti/PbO_2 electrode, the potentials of oxygen evolution on the Ti/PbO_2+F electrode apparently shifted more positively, while those of Ti/PbO_2+Nano-Co_3O_4 electrode shifted negatively after the oxidation of phenol took place. This provided experimental evidence for the existence of some transient intermediates which underwent particularly fast reactions, i.e., the reaction of water molecule with phenol occurred before the dissociation of water molecule, which was more beneficial to the transformation and degradation of phenol.			本文在SnO_2-Sb_2O_5氧化物为中间层的钛基体上,采用电沉积法制备了无掺杂的Ti/PbO_2、掺杂F的Ti/PbO_2(Ti/PbO_2+F)和掺杂Co_3O_4纳米粒子的Ti/PbO_2电极(Ti/PbO_2+Nano-Co_3O_4).用X射线衍射(XRD)和扫描电镜(SEM)分析和观察了电极材料的组成、结构和形貌,并通过电化学方法研究了这三种电极对苯酚的电催化氧化性能.结果表明,Ti/PbO_2+F电极的析氧电位较Ti/PbO_2电极的发生明显正移,但其苯酚的氧化峰和析氧峰并不能分开;而Ti/PbO_2+Nano-Co_3O_4电极虽然其析氧电位负移,但对苯酚的氧化峰出现在析氧峰之前.这一结果表明,体系存在着某种反应特别快的瞬态中间体,即在水分子被解离之前已与苯酚发生了反应,从而更有利于苯酚的转化和降解.						2	0	0		0	0	2			1006-3471			CSCD:4777363

Their water oxidation activities were measured in 0.1 M HClO4. The Ir0.89Cu0.11 HO-np was the most active catalyst in the series with mass (Ir) - normalized activity = 142 A g(Ir)(-1) and electrochemically accessible Ir sites normalized activity >180 A mmol(Ir)(-1) (both at 250 mV overpotential). The Ir0.89Cu0.11 HO-nps were stable for 24 h galvanostatic oxidations at 1 mA cm(geometric)(-2), with only 280 mV overpotential. The average diameter of the Ir0.9Cu0.11 HO-nps was similar to 1.30 nm. XPS results suggested that doping with Cu2+ reduces the overall charge in the lattice, resulting in higher electron density at Ir than in pure Ir HO-np. Preliminary mechanistic investigations showed that the activity enhancement by Cu is not only a surface area effect, and the presence of Cu does not appear to significantly alter the mechanism of the water oxidation reaction.									24	0	0	0	1	0	24			1932-7447			WOS:000396969900004

The preferred method to produce hydrogen without generating greenhouse gases is the electrolysis of water using renewable energy. The reduction of energy during the water electrolysis process is a desirable goal regardless of the source of electric power. Similar to ferrous/ferric mediation, iodide can be used as a mediator in the electrolysis of an acidic suspension of coke or coal. The iodide ion is oxidized at a far lower anodic potential than the alternative oxygen evolution reaction. This reduces the cell electrolysis voltage and, consequently, reduces electricity use. The iodide consumed at the anode is continuously regenerated by chemical reaction with the coke/coal in suspension.									13	2	0	0	0	0	15			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000255752100015

This technique has been used here to follow the tungsten oxidation during reactions performed under 1.3 Pa of dry oxygen pressure and at different temperatures in the range 800-1100 K.At a fixed temperature T(ox), the spectrometer records the evolution of the normal and spectral emissivity, epsilon(lambda,theta = 0), during the formation of the WO3 oxide layer from the first stage (clean metal surface) until measurements have shown a modification in the radiative behaviour of WO3 during its growth when this growth is performed above a critical temperature T(c), between 1000 and 1010 K. To understand this discontinuity, we had to study more precisely the oxidation kinetics of this refractory material in this pressure and temperature range by additional measurements; electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, measurements of oxidation rates.

An initial light-dependent O2 outburst of 6-mu-mol.m-2 was measured after aerobic dark incubation. It was attributed to the reduction of electron carriers, predominantly plastoquinone. The maximum initial rate of O2 evolution at PFD 8000-mu-mol.m-2.s-1 was 170-mu-mol.m-2.s-1 or about four times the steady CO2- and light-saturated rate of photosynthesis. Fluorescence measurements showed that the rate was still acceptor-limited. Fast O2 evolution ceased after electron carriers were reduced in the dark-adapted leaf, but continued for a short time at the lower rate of 62-mu-mol.m-2.s-1 in the light-adapted leaf. The data are interpreted to show that enzymes involved in 3-phosphoglycerate reduction are dark-inhibited, but were fully active in low light. In a dark-adapted leaf, respiratory CO2 evolution continued under nitrogen; it was partially inhibited by illumination. Prolonged exposure of a leaf to anaerobic conditions caused reducing equivalents to accumulate. This was shown by a slowly increasing chlorophyll fluorescence yield which indicated the reduction of the PSII acceptor Q(A) in the dark. When the leaf was illuminated, no O2 evolution was detected from short light pulses, although transient O2 production was appreciable during longer light pulses. This indicates that an electron donor (pool size about 2-3 e/PSII reaction center) became reduced in the dark and the first photons were used to oxidise this donor instead of water.									20	0	0	0	17	0	20			0032-0935			WOS:A1992HE34800015	24186741

High-content oxygen is a significant negative factor for low-rank coal utilization. The TG-FTIR-GC/MS method was applied to investigate the migration behavior of oxygen and the variation in the properties of Chinese long-flame coal during low-temperature pyrolysis. It was found that the oxygen migration ratios in long-flame coal toward gas and tar were 47.7 and 5.2%, respectively, at 550 A degrees C, that the initial oxygen migration temperatures of hydroxyl, carboxyl, carbonyl and ether bonds were 500, 200, 300 and 350 A degrees C, respectively, that the decomposition rates were 8.2, 90, 99.2 and 86% at 550 A degrees C, respectively, that the oxygen in gas existed mainly in the form of CO2 and CO, and that the oxygen in tar existed mainly in the form of phenolic compounds. The further removal of oxygen was due to the decomposition of hydroxyl and a small amount of stable ether bonds. Furthermore, deoxygenation suggested that the decrease in oxygen had a positive effect on coal liquefaction and resulted in a decrease in its hydrophilicity.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000425965400089

The abundances of nitrogen-containing molecules during pre-protostellar collapse								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				456	1			215	U41		10.1051/0004-6361:20065375				SEP 2006	2006	Aims. We have studied the chemistry of nitrogen-bearing species during the initial stages of protostellar collapse, with a view to explaining the observed longevity of N2H+ and NH3 and the high levels of deuteration of these species. Methods. We followed the chemical evolution of a medium comprising gas and dust as it underwent free-fall gravitational collapse. Chemical processes which determine the relative populations of the nuclear spin states of molecules and molecular ions were included explicitly, as were reactions which lead ultimately to the deuteration of the nitrogen-containing species N2H+ and NH3. The freeze-out of "heavy" molecules on to dust grains was taken into account. Results. We found that the timescale required for the nitrogen-containing species to attain their steady-state values was much larger than the free-fall time and even comparable with the probable lifetime of the precursor molecular cloud. However, it transpires that the chemical evolution of the gas during gravitational collapse is insensitive to its initial composition. If we suppose that the grain-sticking probabilities of atomic nitrogen and atomic oxygen are both less than unity ( S less than or similar to 0.3), we find that the observed differential freeze-out of nitrogen-and carbon-bearing species can be reproduced by the model of free-fall collapse when a sufficiently large grain radius (a(g) approximate to 0.50 mu m) is adopted. Furthermore, the results of our collapse model are consistent with the high levels of deuteration of N2H+ and NH3 which have been observed in L1544, for example, providing that 0.5 less than or similar to a(g) less than or similar to 1.0 mu m. We note that the ortho: para H2D+ ratio, and fractional abundance of ortho-H2D+, which is the observed form of H2D+, should be largest where ND3 is most abundant.									81	1	0	0	0	0	81			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000240009800021

The kinetic evaluations were performed in a temperature range from 923 to 1,123 K under atmospheric pressure. The effects due to water and oxygen addition to the feed of the process were examined in terms of the yields of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Contributions of the reverse water-gas shift and oxidation reactions were evaluated. At temperatures above 1,000 K, methane and carbon dioxide conversions of 97.35 and 46.75% produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide with yields of 37.35 and 4.99%, respectively. A model was proposed to describe the kinetic behavior of the process considering the proposition of a four step reaction mechanism. The solutions of the equations of the model established predictions in terms of reactant and products concentration evolutions. The model predictions indicated that for operations at 1,123 K and 1.0 bar, with low spatial times (tau < 2.0 kg s/m(3)), a hydrogen yield as high as 75% was obtained.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1878-5190	1878-5204		WOS:000283366300015

Many efforts have been made to improve the energy conversion efficiency. In this review article, we mainly summarized the emerging ideas on water oxidation by multi-energy coupling. First, the physicochemical nature of electrolyzing water reaction is described. Then, we conceptually proposed the physical basis of energy coupling with a goal to maximize the energy conversion efficiency and showed the methods to achieve heat-electricity and magnetism-electricity coupling to drive water splitting. Finally, the material requirements for creating efficient energy coupling water splitting system were proposed. These new ideas unlock a big potential direction for developing multi-energy coupling hydrogen production devices to efficiently store the intermittent and fluctuating renewables.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-2646			WOS:000802252200001	35615312

After oxygen evolution, all of the Fe-Ni alloys formed a passivation film consisting of an outer Fe2O3 layer, an intermediate Fe3O4 layer, and an inner FeO layer. Because of the outward diffusions of nickel ions, a NiO layer formed in the passivation film when the 43Fe-57Ni alloy was passivated by O-2. A solid-state reaction between Fe2O3 and NiO led to the formation of NiFe2O4 in the passivation film, which greatly promoted its corrosion resistance to the molten fluoride salts.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000472589600004

In the past few decades, photocatalytic water splitting has attracted increasing attention, and extensive efforts have been made to construct efficient heterogeneous water-splitting systems. In this chapter, we review the fundamental scientific advances in photocatalytic water splitting using semiconductor-based photocatalyst, especially in light-absorbing materials, photogenerated charge separation, dual-cocatalyst, and surface catalytic reactions. The chapter focuses on the advances achieved in particulate photocatalyst systems, Z-scheme photocatalyst systems, and hybrid natural-artificial photosynthesis systems. Additionally, technical and economic evaluation of hydrogen production via solar water splitting for potential applications is also briefly discussed.

NaTaO3:La loaded with Au by an impregnation method showed higher and more steady activity for water splitting than that by a photodeposition method. This difference in the activity for water splitting was related to the O-2 photoreduction on the loaded Au cocatalyst, which is one of the backward reactions of water splitting. The impregnated spherical Au cocatalyst suppressed the O-2 photoreduction by photogenerated electrons more efficiently than the photodeposited hemispherical Au cocatalyst, because the perimeter of Au/NaTaO3:La interface which produces activated O-2 molecules was smaller in the impregnated Au than the photodeposited Au.

An overpotential occurs in the presence of organic molecules in the solution shifting oxygen evolution towards higher potentials. The results obtained were conclusive that benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde electrooxidation on NiOOH layers yielded benzoic acid as the main final reaction product. Chromatographic analysis of the bulk solution showed that the electrocatalytic oxidation of harmful molecules was carried out until the formation of acid compounds (benzoic acid) as an ultimate stage, suggesting that a Ni anode can be used successfully for waste remediation.									22	1	0	0	1	1	22			0021-891X			WOS:000239730100011

Herein, we now report the synthesis of vanadium-doped CoS/Co9S8 heterostructures embedded on carbon nanorods (V-CoS/Co9S8@CNR), which was realized through one-step sulfurization of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-67 (ZIF-67) grown on V2O5 nanorods (V2O5@ZIF-67). The results of experiment and theoretical calculation verified that because of the vanadium dopant and the coupled nanointerface that can expedite the synergistic effect of Co9S8 and CoS, the obtained V-CoS/Co9S8@CNR showed an excellent OER catalytic performance (269 mV@10 mA/cm2) and comparable ORR catalytic performance.

Cyclic voltammetry and transient photoresponse measurements in the presence of above-bandgap illumination reveal that hole transfer to the solution is mediated by surface states in all cases. For measurements in pure PBS, a modification of the surface during cyclic potential sweeps is observed. In contrast, the presence of the redox species used in this work efficiently suppresses the oxygen evolution reaction and the associated surface modification. Furthermore, charge transfer to the redox couple is fully reversible using GaN as a dark cathode and photoanode, respectively. The presented study is of significant importance for applications of GaN in photocatalysis and biosensing, where the stability of (bio)functionalized surfaces is an essential requirement.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			1932-7447			WOS:000310121000021

This is seen primarily as a substantial positive shift of the anodic peaks and in a diminishment, by up to about 50%, in the reaction kinetics. This effect, termed as film ageing, can be reversed, either by long times of cycling over an extended range of potential or by a brief holding period in the oxidized state of the film. Oxide films do not exhibit ageing in alkaline solutions. It is, therefore, suggested that film ageing is associated primarily with the loss of water from the film in acidic solutions at negative potentials, resulting in the inhibition of subsequent ion/solvent transport processes in the film.									28	0	0	0	1	0	28			0021-891X			WOS:A1993LG09900016

Our recent theoretical DFT+U calculations confirm this hypothesis. In this paper, in order to account for more accurate electronic structure of the surface, we perform a one-shot GW calculation from a DFT+U wavefunction. We find that G(0)W(0) overestimates the energy position of surface states, but provides good qualitative features of the surface's electronic structure.[GRAPHICS].									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000385196700021

Herein, a surface functionalized Pt/C catalyst with minute Ce-O-Pt linkages decorating on Pt surface (denoted as Ce-O-Pt/C) is synthesized via a coating-annealing-etching route, in which a valid contact and a strong interaction between CeOx and Pt NPs are established. Experimental and theoretical results suggest that in this unique Ce-O-Pt/C catalyst, the slight cerium oxides bond well with Pt atoms to form Ce-O-Pt linkages and induce an obvious charge transfer interaction, resulting in an electron redistribution and modulated d-band state of Pt. The optimized Pt electronic structure consequently facilitates the adsorption of oxygen-containing species and oxidation of CO intermediates, promoting the methanol conversion. Benefiting from that, the as-synthesized Ce-O-Pt/C catalyst exhibits much better catalytic MOR activity, stability and anti-CO poisoning ability as compared to the un-functionalized Pt/C.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000848288600004

We develop a "dynamic, isothermal" carburization of WO3 in a mixture of CH4 and H-2 to control phase composition and catalytic properties. A design-of-experiments approach reveals that the key parameters are synthesis temperature (670 to 775 degrees C) and addition of silica as stabilizer (0 or 70 mol%). X-ray diffraction shows that the composition can be adjusted from 14 to 99 wt% W2C, complemented by WC and a small fraction of W metal. Crystalline domain sizes for W2C are smaller than those of WC (>= 10 nm), affording thermodynamic stabilization of W2C in agreement with computational predictions (Shrestha et al., Chem. Mater. 2021, 33, 4606-4620). The amount of CO adsorbed scales with W2C content, and so does the performance in butyraldehyde or toluene hydrogenation. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Electrocatalysts, as the "heart" of the electrochemical conversion process, play a key role in accelerating reaction rates and promoting efficiency. Transition-metal-based layered double hydroxides (TM LDHs), one of the famous electrocatalysts, show unique 2D supermolecular-stratified structure, excellent electronic properties, and their raw materials are easily available. In this review, electrocatalysis-related properties of TM LDHs and the state-of-the-art synthesis methods of TM LDH-based electrocatalysts are summarized. Modifications for promoting the development of TM LDH-based electrocatalysts are included, such as carbon materials modification, defect engineering, and noble metal loading. Then, the application of TM LDH nanosheets in the field of electrocatalysis is reviewed in detail. Finally, recent challenges, ongoing improvements, and future expectations for TM LDH nanosheets are presented.									49	3	0	0	9	0	51			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000620997100001

Herein, we report the synthesis of the bimetallic catalyst PtyCo1-y/Ti3C2X2 via a facile one-pot approach using Ti3C2X2 as the support. The in situ synthesized PtyCo1-y/Ti3C2X2 is subsequently applied as a catalyst for hydrogen evolution from the hydrolysis of ammonia borane at 25 degrees C. Experimental results show that Pt0.08Co0.92/Ti3C2X2 exhibits excellent catalytic activity for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane with a high hydrogen generation rate of 100.7 L H-2 (min g(Pt))(-1) and turnover frequency of 727 mol H-2 (min mol(Pt))(-1) because of the synergistic effect between Pt and Co. Moreover, Pt0.08Co0.92/Ti3C2X2 could be recovered from the reaction mixture by a magnet and recycled at least seven times, thus showing its high recycling efficiency.									51	2	0	0	2	0	51			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000401528400030

In this work, we explore the correlation between the downshift in flat band potential of hematite, V-fb, and in onset potential of OER, V-onset, caused by prolonged annealing. We observed a cathodic shift (i.e., towards lower potentials) of 200 mV of V-onset on model photoanodes consisting of ultra-thin hematite films, upon increasing the oxidation time during fabrication and without any further modifications. Detailed physical characterization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and Mott-Schottky analysis revealed a quantitative correlation between the cathodic shift of V-onset and a lowering of V-fb. We identified a reduction in concentration of grain boundaries with increasing oxidation time, as the mechanism behind the observed shift of the V-fb. The approach presented here can be seen as a complementary strategy to co-catalysts and other post-fabrication treatments to lower V-onset. Moreover, it is generically applicable to photoelectrodes used to carry out oxidation and reduction half-cell reactions.									55	0	0	0	6	0	55			2046-2069			WOS:000358229500045

The treatment was conducted in a discontinuous set-up provided with a flow cell with recirculation of the liquid medium. Al (III) species and hydrogen were shown to be evolved at both Al-based alloy cathode and anode. The current yield of both generations is higher than unity depending on the content of oil dispersion and the applied current, due to the complex reaction mechanism at the electrodes. The progress in removal of the suspended matter was followed by determination of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) of the clear fractions of the samples collected. The operation of the process and the treatment efficiency were shown to depend little on the operating conditions. Removal yields of COD and TOC higher than 90% can be obtained upon dissolution of 0.5 g 1(-1) Al, corresponding to acceptable energy consumption in the cell, and low concentrations of Al salts in the recovered sludge.									56	1	0	0	17	2	56			0957-5820	1744-3598		WOS:000226798000007

According to this principle, isomerization of molecules is extended to sets of molecules. A synthesis can be regarded as a system in which the elementary objects are atoms (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, etc.). The main property of these objects is to be or not to be bonded to other objects. The continuity of bonds define molecules. Such a system evolves with time, from an initial state containing starting materials towards a final state containing the target molecule, via a sequence of intermediary steps. This evolution represents actions which can be considered as bond redistributions at the atomic level and reactions at the molecular level. Atoms, bonds and molecules are passive objects that can be observed at different times. Reactions, and, at a higher level, synthetic methods and synthetic paths, are active objects which can be observed within the time intervals. We present an implementation of this modelization using the frame-based language YAFOOL. Finally, a linear notation developed to give a unique name to chemical complex objects is described.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1144-0546			WOS:A1990EQ10500004

Excess Ca2+ increased the inhibitory effect of Hg2+ on O-2 evolution. Exposure to Hg2+ caused increase in functional antenna size (ABS/RC), trapping rate of reaction center (TR0/RC), dissipated energy flux per reaction center (DI0/RC) and maximum quantum yield of non-photochemical deexcitation (phi(Do)), indicating that some reaction centers were transformed to dissipation sinks under Hg2+ stress. Hg2+ stress slowed down electron transport on both donor side and acceptor side and caused accumulation of P-680(+). Excess Ca2+ intensified all the Hg2+ toxic effects on PSII function and led to dysfunction of PSII. The number of reaction centers that were transformed into dissipation sinks increased with increasing Ca2+ concentration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, B doped g-C3N4 quantum dots (BCNQDs) were prepared via a facile molten salt method using melamine and boron oxide as precursors. By introducing BCNQDs onto the surface of g-C3N4, g-C3N4/BCNQDs heterojunction was constructed via hydrothermal treatment. The resulting g-C3N4/BCNQDs heterojunction exhibits enhanced hydrogen evolution performance for water splitting under visible light irradiation. The mechanism underlying the improved photocatalytic activity was explored and discussed based on the formation of heterojunction between g-C3N4 and BCNQDs with well-matched band structure.

One of the main problems is the identification of new electrocatalytic materials which are used for energy conversion applications. A brief view on the use of modern computational techniques in discovery of new electrocatalysts is provided, mainly focusing on the electronic structure methods and the idea of catalytic descriptor. Using this approach, it is possible to screen many candidates for new electrocatalysts. However, the complexity of an electrified interface requires additional efforts to fully understand the properties of electrocatalytic materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0352-5139			WOS:000466010400007

The products of the photoelectrochemical (PEC) reaction could be detected electrochemically by a Au ring on the optical fiber. The PEC properties of larger electrodes were investigated, and the Zn-In and W-Cd oxide photocatalysts showed a much higher photoactivity than Sn-doped Cd-In-Bi.

The Ni-Pt codeposit with ca. Pt 60 a/o was found to exhibit the maximal activity for the oxidation of methanol in the low potential range. The electrocatalytic activity of all Ni-Pt codeposits (before and after leaching) for methanol oxidation was found to depend on their original compositions/textural properties before leaching. The hydroxyl Pt(IV) species with a higher hydrated property possessed a higher activity for the methanol oxidation and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). The presence of a hydroxyplatinum intermediate, Pt(OH)(ads), was proposed to be responsible for the anodic peaks of methanol oxidation in the less positive potential region on both positive and negative sweeps.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0368-1653			WOS:000084068200010

These transformants were exposed to ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation, and the degradation of phycobilins, the inactivation of photosynthetic oxygen evolution, and the activity of photosystem II were determined. In the genetically modified cells, the influence on destruction of phycobilins was negligible. However, protection of photosynthetic reactions against UV-B damage was observed and was dependent on the carotenoid concentrations in the different transformants. Furthermore, it was shown that endogenous zeaxanthin is more effective than beta-carotene. Our results suggest that carotenoids exert their protective function as antioxidants to inactivate UV-B-induced radicals in the photosynthetic membrane.									96	8	0	0	91	2	108			0032-0889			WOS:000080936500028	10364412

Slightly negative delta D and delta(18) O values of hydration water and marine nature of Br in carnallites indicate that these minerals were the products evaporated from the concentrated seawater mixed with meteoric water and that the continental water exerted influence to some extent on the evolution of ore-forming brine. These evaporites in the lower section of Nongbok Formation are divided into three different evolutionary stages: (1) Stage of marine input: the seawater entered into salt basin and voluminously hakes deposited; the transgression is characterized by the early obvious fluctuation and the late stabilization; the transition of marine to nonmarine input occurred at latest stage and then continental inputs was gradually dominant for the hydrologically closed and restricted salt basin; the components of ore-forming brine were changed by input of deep-seated fluid. (2) Stage of nonmarine input and mixed brine evaporation: the potash deposits formed during progressive evaporation; a slightly freshening event of brine happened at the early stage. (3) Stage of post-depositional reworking: the buried carnallitite was translated into the sylvitite by leaching of ground water and therefore the sylvite is the secondary mineral which substituted for precursor carnallite. Systematical analyses of trace element, oxygen and hydrogen isotope show that the nonmarine inputs played an important role during the evolution of ore-forming brine post-depositional reworking.									11	8	0	0	0	0	17			1000-0569	2095-8927		WOS:000362800400025

The bimetallic electrocatalysts show excellent activity both in cathodic and anodic processes. As a result, we achieved a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at a cell potential as small as 1.56 V. Moreover, the electrodes feature great stability and even after 12 h of continuous operation maintain stable cell voltage. Excellent performance of the LDH-based electrocatalysts stems from the combination of unsurpassed conductivity and stability of Ag backbone and LDH lattice expansion upon introduction of Fe atoms.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2574-0970			WOS:000510073600095

Herein, a peculiar Co-based phosphate NaCo4(PO4)(3), in which all Co atoms were in very rare 5-coordinations, was first synthesized in nanoribbon morphology. With the combined merits of the unique Co coordination, intrinsic half-metallicity, and nano structured morphology, NaCco(4)(PO4)(3) nanoribbons were characterized with high efficiency for water oxidation in a neutral electrolyte, remarkably outperforming congeneric phosphates such as Na2CoP2O7 with 4-coordinated Co configurations and even comparable to the benchmark RuO2 nanoparticles. The high catalytic performance validates a great potential in exploiting inorganic nanostructures with coordinatively asymmetric or unsaturated metal centers for energy storage and conversion applications.									46	5	0	0	0	0	46			2380-8195			WOS:000435159000007

In all cases a portion of the adsorbed ethanethiol undergoes S-H bond cleavage below 350 K to form ethyl thiolate; H-2 and H2S are evolved between 150 and 350 K. Ethyl thiolate decomposes above 400 K on Ag(110) to yield ethylene, together with ethane and some dihydrogen. On Au(110) ethyl thiolate decomposes in the same temperature range to evolve a mixture of ethylene, ethane, ethanethiol and diethyl sulfide. The evolution of sulfur-containing molecules from thiolate decomposition is novel and appears to be unique to gold. On both surfaces the decomposition kinetics are dependent on surface sulfur coverage.									50	0	0	0	0	0	51			0039-6028			WOS:A1994NL43100023		
J	Cheng, Emily; Notestein, Justin								Molybdenum oxide and sulfide active sites for isobutane dehydrogenation with methanol as a probe molecule								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				413				498	508		10.1016/j.jcat.2022.07.007				SEP 2022	2022	Molybdenum oxides and sulfides are alternative catalysts for several reactions, including alkane dehydrogenation. Correlations have been developed between reactivity and structure, but it is difficult to compare different catalysts without determining numbers of active sites. Here, methanol temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR) is applied to bulk MoS2 and a series of supported molybdenum oxides and sulfides used for isobutane dehydrogenation. Rates and deactivation behavior are similar between supported molybdenum oxides and sulfides. Coking increases with loading and correlates well with the fraction of Mo-based CO2-forming sites from methanol TPSR. Normalizing isobutane dehydrogenation rates by formaldehyde-forming sites unifies rates over oxide and sulfide materials. These measurements confirm earlier hypotheses that MoS2 and higher loadings of oxides and sulfides are intrinsically fast catalysts, but they have few active sites and are prone to coking. In general, methanol TPSR is proposed as an accessible route to count sites on both supported oxides and sulfides. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

For prevention of intolerable global warming and complete exhaustion of fossil fuels we need complete conversion from fossil fuel consumption to renewable energy. We have been performing the research and development of global carbon dioxide recycling for more than 25 years to supply renewable energy to the world in the form of methane produced by the reaction of carbon dioxide captured from chimney with hydrogen generated electrolytically using electricity generated by renewable energy. We created the cathode and anode for electrolytic hydrogen generation and the catalyst for carbon dioxide methanation by the reaction with hydrogen. The methane formation from renewable energy will be the most convenient and efficient key technology for the use of renewable energy by storage of intermittent and fluctuating electricity generated from renewable energy and by regeneration of stable electricity.

A new distribution function that links the specific surface area of a particle with its porosity and reaction degree has been proposed. An equation for estimation of changes in this parameter during the reaction, on the basis of the initial value, has been presented. In the range of our data and the analysis of the literature data, the model, with satisfactory accuracy, describes internal structural changes of coal and coal char particles. The present results may constitute a basis for complex modelling of coal conversion processes.Based on the results it was found that the total active centres are related to the internal surface area and porosity of the particle. For a specific coal type, this value depends on the porosity, true density and size of the particle. Changes in total active centres, when these structural properties during thermal conversion of coal are considered, are described in equations.									12	3	0	0	0	0	15			0208-6425			WOS:000294148500006

Proceedings of the 4th International Meeting on Modern Ceramics Technologies								718	28						1980	1980	Different samples of (Si+6 wt.% Al) compacted powder, nitrided under various conditions, have been oxidized at 1400degC in air. X-ray diffraction recordings and quantitative electron microprobe analyses suggest that the chemical evolution of the oxidized layer (mainly composed of cristobalite, mullite and silicon oxynitride) at the surface of a nitrided sample is controlled initially by the diffusion of oxygen in a possible gaseous boundary layer or in the oxidized layer itself. the diffusion of aluminium in the nitrided material later becomes the limiting process. The effects of the possible presence of a glassy phase in the oxidized layer (found to be dependent amongst other things on the amount of free silicon in the nitrided material) have also been investigated. In practice aluminium additions seem to prevent any loss of strength after oxidation.

In this research, a triple-cathode EF system with a microbial fuel cell (MFC) cathode for the acceleration of Fe2+ regeneration, a gas diffusion electrode for H2O2 production and a stainless steel mesh (SSM) for electro-activation of H2O2 was designed for efficient degradation of organic pollutants. The triple-cathode EF exhibited improved removal rate for recalcitrant organic pollutants with an average electricity consumption of 18.2 kWh Kg(-1) TOC for Rhodamine B degradation, and the dosage of Fe2+ could be reduced to 0.1 mM due to better utilization of H2O2 and inhibition of parasitic reactions. Electrochemical characterization and theoretical calculation revealed that both one-electron reduction and H*-mediated activation contributed to the electro-activation of H2O2 on SSM. This work demonstrates a novel construction and feasible approach for efficient EF with low cost.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000831672200003

In this research, a novel electrocatalyst of sulfur-doped nickel cobalt phosphide nanosheets coating over structure of the conductive carbon cloth (CC) (S-NiCoP/CC) was synthesized via a facile electrodeposition method followed by a phosphidization step. Such hierarchical nanostructure with excellent porosity offered rich active sites and high electrical conductivity, thereby accelerating electrocatalyst activities for HER and OER in 1.0 KOH electrolyte. The S-NiCoP/CC required small overpotentials of 90 at 10 mA cm 2 for HER and 320 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) for OER. In addition, an electrolyzer based on S-NiCoP/CC electrodes showed a cell voltage of 1.61 V at 20 mA cm(-2) along with good stability in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The successful synthesis of S-NiCoP/CC prospectively opened a new aspect for developing effective electrocatalyst in water splitting application.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000672582700004

The matrix of carbon corresponds to an experimental turbostratic carbon black with low surface area. In all cases, the redox reactions studied by Cyclic Voltammetry in 6 M KOH can be assigned to the reduction/oxidation of intrinsic carbon-oxygen complexes and to the hydrogen adsorption/desorption reactions. Modification with less than 10 wt.`% carbon nanotubes facilitates hydrogen evolution, while modification with C-60 causes the activation of the paste towards oxidation processes. For SWNT-modified paste electrodes, changes in the microstructure of the paste cause the increase in capacitive current, in contrast with the unmodified carbon paste electrode where this increment only occurs after several potential cycles. The fact that the paste electrode required an optimum carbon nanotubes concentration indicates that low-surface area carbon blacks are good candidates for the dispersion of single wall carbon nanotubes, and that a maximum of 200% increase in charge storage capacity can be obtained from carbon black/SWNT silicon oil composites.

However, the relatively high recombination rate and low quantum yield of photogenerated electron-hole pairs limit their practical applications. In this study, a series of TiO2/ZnO/diatomite composites with various compositions were successfully prepared via a two-step precipitation method. They exhibited stronger UV-visible absorption properties and substantially lower fluorescence intensities than those of ZnO and ZnO/diatomite, which was mainly due to the low recombination rate of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs in the composite system. The reaction intermediates of methylene blue were detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the degradation process was determined. The best composite catalyst was used for the degradation of gaseous methylbenzene and gaseous acetone. The gaseous acetone degradation product was determined to be acetaldehyde via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results show that the composite catalyst exhibited a good photocatalytic degradation of both liquid pollutants and harmful volatile gases. When applied to the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, the composite catalyst retained a good photoresponsivity and electrolytic efficiency.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2073-4344		WOS:000776857600001

The solution of CBS in CCl(4) was irradiated with a mercury lamp for 1.0-7.5 h without and with application of ultrasound (25 kHz, 16 W cm(-2)). Using GC the presence of following benzothiazole derivatives was confirmed: benzothiazole, benzothiazole-2-thiol, 2-(cyclohexyldisulfanyl)benzothiazole, di(benzothiazol-2-yl)disulfane, and 2-chlorobenzothiazole. In the investigated concentration range (1.5-148.5 mg dm(-3)) CBS and its photodegradation products showed pronounced stimulating effects on the growth of Sinapis alba L. On the other hand, the tested reaction mixtures containing photodegradation products of CBS inhibited oxygen evolution rate in the suspension of spinach chloroplasts and the photosynthesis-inhibiting activity of the reaction mixtures depended on the time of irradiation as well as on the application of ultrasound.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0366-6352			WOS:000186190300011

The product showed a photocurrent density of 0.39mA/cm(2) at 1.23V vs RHE. It was found that the Ti doping had promoted the photovoltage of hematite by surface modification rather than increasing donor density. The loading of Ni (OH)(2) had further improved the photoelectrochemical performance of Ti-Fe2O3 via reducing both overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction and the recombination rate of the charge carriers. Moreover, the Ni(OH)(2) content could be optimized to avoid light blocking effect due to excessive Ni(OH) 2 loading. This confirms that Ni(OH)(2)/Ti-Fe2O3 could be a promising material for photoelectrochemical water splitting. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Hydronium ions enhance oxidation and Pt buckling through proton transfer to the adsorbed O, whereas the chloride species plays an additional oxidant role enhancing Pt detachment. At the fuel cell operation temperature of 80 degrees C, ab initio molecular dynamics results after 4 ps suggest a small influence of the temperature on surface oxidation and moderate reconstruction effects.

At short irradiation times X-ray induced defluorination of the semifluorinated SAM exhibits first-order kinetics with respect to the film's fluorine concentration. The evolution of the C(1s) region during modification is consistent with a kinetic model of defluorination involving consecutive C-F bond breaking events (e.g., CF2 --> CF). Relative defluorination rate constants obtained for the different fluorine-containing functionalities (e.g., CF2, CF) provide support for a stochastic fluorine loss process, where each individual C-F bond is initially equally labile toward dissociative electron attachment, independent of local chemical environment. Upon atmospheric exposure the modified film's oxygen adsorption characteristics demonstrate that the density of radicals produced within the organic film during X-ray exposure exhibit a non-linear dependence on irradiation time due to the onset of radical-radical coupling reactions at longer X-ray exposures. The appearance of oxygen within the film is also responsible for further defluorination due to the reactivity of peroxy radicals (-CF(OO .)-). Results from this study support the idea that SAMs can be employed as model systems for developing a detailed understanding of the molecular level events associated with organic surface modification processes.									42	0	0	0	1	0	43			1089-5647			WOS:000086599700038

Disc shaped UME are produced by embedding metal wires on insulating materials such as glass or epoxy resin. In the field of electrochemistry, UME have been applied in studies of the hydrogen evolution reaction and the electrocrystallization of metals. The negligible values of sensibility for ohmic drop and the enhanced mass transport rate by spherical diffusion are the main advantages of UME in these applications. New important conclusions regarding the phenomena under study were drawn from the experimental results. The applications in electroanalytical chemistry involved the determination of contaminants such as heavy metals and nitrites in natural waters and food products. The use of UME requires little sample manipulation and, in general, no need for oxygen removal or the addition of supporting electrolytes.									19	0	0	0	3	6	19			0100-4042	1678-7064		WOS:000074891600013

The biogeochemical feedbacks within the sulfur, carbon, and oxygen cycles may have changed through time, reflecting changes in the concentration of sulfate in the oceans. Unfortunately, there is much uncertainty about the size of the marine sulfate reservoir throughout Earth history. In particular, conflicting estimates for marine sulfate exist during the latest Neoproterozoic, an interval of time associated with striking changes in Earth system evolution and oxidation: published interpretations of fluid inclusion chemistry place sulfate greater than 16 mmol/kg, whereas other interpretations of carbonate-associated sulfate data suggest concentrations less than 2 mmol/kg. Calcium isotope ratios in evaporite successions provide an independent method for deriving semi-quantitative constraints on sulfate concentrations, as well as other properties of seawater chemistry. Here, the calcium isotope behavior of bedded sulfate evaporites from similar to 1050 Ma (Baffin and Bylot Islands, Nunavut, Canada), similar to 830 Ma (Officer Basin, Western Australia), and similar to 545 Ma (South Oman Salt Basin, Sultanate of Oman) are examined. In combination with other geological observations, the results suggest relatively low, millimolal-level sulfate in the latest Mesoproterozoic and a more specific range of 6-10 mmol/kg sulfate during the latest Neoproterozoic. These new constraints suggest that previous interpretations of sulfate concentrations and seawater chemistry need to be revised, opening up new possible solution spaces for the major ion composition of seawater.

Three are spectroscopic binaries, and three have constant radial velocities. The chemical compositions of these two groups are very different, as the binary BMP stars have large enhancements of carbon and neutron-capture elements that are products of s-process nucleosynthesis. One star, CS 29497-030, has an extreme enhancement of lead, [Pb/Fe] = +3.7, the largest abundance in any star yet discovered. It probably also has an oxygen overabundance compared to the other BMP stars of our sample. The binary BMP stars must have attained their status via mass transfer during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) evolutions of their companion stars, which are now unseen and most likely are compact objects. We have not found any examples of AGB mass transfer among BMP binaries with [Fe/H] > -2.									62	1	0	0	0	0	63			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000184098600041

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to investigate the surface morphology and chemical composition of the AuNPs@CaFe-LDH. The catalytic activity of the catalyst was studied for OER and HER in alkaline media and was compared with CaFe-LDH@AuNPs, AuNPs and CaFe-LDH catalysts using electrochemical methods such as linear sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and chrono-analysis. The AuNPs@CaFe-LDH featured a low onset potential of 1.68 V for OER and - 0.30 V for HER. The current density, reaction kinetics and stability for both OER and HER at the AuNPs@CaFe-LDH were much higher than those of the AuNPs, LDH and CaFe-LDH@AuNPs. The results indicated that in addition to the synergistic effects between the AuNPs and CaFe-LDH, high electrochemically active surface area of AuNPs plays a key role in the enhancement of catalytic activity of the AuNPs@CaFe-LDH. Therefore, this catalyst could be applied as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst to use in alkaline water electrolyzers.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000423650000011

We have investigated the process at surfaces vicinal to Pt(111) and show that these oxidize in successive stages depending on site geometry as well as the adsorption behavior of the electrolyte anion. Step sites of {100} orientation slowly oxidize at low potential (0.7 V vs RHE) in a region overlapping that of the "butterfly" peak seen at Pt(111) in the absence of specific electrolyte anion adsorption. Almost regardless of the latter, both {110} and {100} steps also oxidize between 0.9 and 1.2 V, causing voltammetric peaks with shapes that are characteristic of step orientation. The complex oxidation behavior of Pt(111) in perchloric acid, ranging from 0.6 V to the onset of O(2) evolution at 1.5 V, is mostly suppressed in sulfuric acid. However, if steps are introduced, then the oxidation at lower potential is again facilitated, probably by breaking the ordered protective sulfate adlayer along the steps. It was found that {100} steps oxidize to the extent of one electron per step atom, whereas {110} steps show two consecutive oxidations, amounting to a total of two electrons per step atom. At the onset of O(2) evolution, Pt(111) terraces are oxidized with two electrons per surface atom.									46	0	0	0	6	0	46			1932-7447			WOS:000293419700051

Nevertheless, its practical electrocatalytic performance towards OER is still undesirable due to the sluggish OER kinetics and high overpotential gap on the water oxidation anode side. In this work, in order to enhance the electrochemical water oxidation performance of NiFe2O4, the surface of NiFe2O4 is functionalized with phosphate ions (Pi) by using a facile incipient impregnation and following calcination process. Results demonstrate that the OER properties of NiFe2O4 under alkaline conditions can be dramatically boosted by the surface Pi functionalization. In 1.0 M KOH solution, the resulting NiFe2O4-Pi on glassy carbon (GC) electrode demonstrates quite lower overpotential of 332 mV (10 mA/cm(2)) and Tafel slope of 57 mV/dec compared to that of pristine NiFe2O4 (443 mV@10 mA/cm(2) and 96 mV/dec), which is also better than that of commercial RuO2 electrocatalysts (348 mV@10 mA/cm(2) and 80 mV/dec). Moreover, such electrocatalyst on nickel foam electrode also realizes superior OER durability to afford a current density of 70 mA/cm(2)at overpotential of only 300 mV for at least 28 h. The excellent electrocatalytic water oxidation activities of NiFe2O4 -Pi can be attributed to the tuning electronic property and surface wettability by Pi ions functionalization. This work provides us a novel and effective approach to modify the photo-/electrocatalytic activity for transition metal oxides. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

As a cheaper alternative to Pt, ruthenium is considered an inferior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst than Pt due to its high susceptibility to oxidation and loss of activity. Herein, we reveal that the HER activity on Ru based catalysts could surpass Pt via tuning Ru oxidation state. Specifically, RuP clusters encapsulated in few layers of N, P-doped carbon (RuP@NPC) display a minimum over potential of 15.6 mV to deliver 10 mA.cm(-2). Moreover, we for the first time show that a Ru based catalyst could afford current density up to 4 A.cm(-2) in a practical water electrolysis cell, with voltage even lower than the Pt/C-based cell, as well as high robustness during 200 h operation. Using a combination of experiment probing and calculation, we postulate that the suitably charged Ru (similar to +2.4) catalytic center is the origin for its superior catalytic behavior. While the moderately charged Ru is empowered with optimized H adsorption behavior, the carbon encapsulation layers protect RuP clusters from over oxidation, thereby conferring the catalyst with high robustness.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000684526800001

The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate could reach 99.4% at 400 A degrees C, 24 MPa, 1min and oxidation coefficient (OC) of 2. Experimental results showed that COD removal had no significant dependence on temperature and pressure variations. By contrast, COD removal could be significantly promoted with OC increasing from 0 to 2.0, but the effect was negligible as the OC further increased; similarly, longer residence time than a definite value seemed to contribute little to COD removal. Initial and deeper degradation pathways of penicillin were proposed based on the reactive force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. By tracing the evolution of intermediates, the migration routes of S and N during the SCWO process were obtained with H2S and NO2 produced as the corresponding products. Simulation results showed that SCW and oxidant not only accelerated the degradation by producing highly reactive radicals or molecules, but also participated in reactions by serving as H and O sources. Moreover, catalysis of water clusters in C-heteroatom bond cleavage was also observed.									19	2	0	0	6	0	20			0256-1115	1975-7220		WOS:000430107300010

Without the presence of AC or at the low AC current densities of 30A.m(-2) and 50A.m(-2), oxygen consumption reaction controls the entire cathode process. While cathode process isdominated by hydrogen evolution reaction at high AC current density of 150A.m(-2). With or without AC application, X100 steels with different microstructure have various corrosion resistances, and the corrosion resistance of steels is in the order of normalized > hot rolled > annealed. The pearlite and granular bainite in the steel have high electrochemical activity, where pitting corrosion generally easy to occur. The combined action of temperature and AC current density promotes the corrosion of X100 pipeline steel to a certain extent. At the low AC current density, the effect of temperature on corrosion behavior is more notable. While the AC current density increases up to 150A.m(-2), the AC corrosion plays a dominant role.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1452-3981			WOS:000489224100029

The morphology, nature and composition of the thin films were fully characterized by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopies. The electrode, annealed at 100 degrees C, generates a sustain current density approximate to 2.25mA.cm(-2) for at least 12h, which is almost two order of magnitude larger than the as-deposited electrode in a sodium borate buffer solution of pH9.2.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2365-6549			WOS:000422674700049

An enhanced energy conversion efficiency requires efficient electrocatalysts to reduce the electrochemical energy barrier. The hollow structures, which have the advantage of optimizing mass/charge transfer, provide a platform for full contact between the electrocatalysts and the reactants, which has great potential for advanced electro-catalysts. In addition, rare earth-based materials integrate unique electronic configuration and chemical behavior into electrocatalysts, leading to improved performance and selectivity for various electrocatalysis. Combining hollow structures with rare earths is fascinating and challenging in terms of synthesis and electrocatalysis. This review expounds general synthesis methods of hollow structures with rare earths and then summarizes strategies to prepare highly efficient hollow electrocatalysts with rare earths.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2589-7780			WOS:000865721800001

The abundant hydroxyl groups of chrysotile can react with amine groups of urea-derived intermediates and accelerate formation of double nitrogen defects (N-vacancy and cyano group) in g-C3N4, which can drastically improve the activation efficiency of PMS. The introdution of chrysotile can greatly increase the reaction time of hydroxyl and amine groups, and promote the generation of double nitrogen defects. This catalyst displayed superior catalytic performance for rhodamine B (RhB) degradation than bare chrysotile and g-C3N4. Moverover, this catalyst also has good cycle performance, structural stability and universal applicability, which provides an idea for the comprehensive utilization of asbestos tailings and environmental remediation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000780991700002

Also, it is considered one of the most interdisciplinary and fundamental sciences with enormous potential for future research and development. Hence, a high number of manuscripts dealing with all different aspects of catalysis topics are published each day. Unfortunately, certain pitfalls that became quite common by now are found in submitted manuscripts and sometimes (and too often) even pass the peer reviewing process. This is especially a problem at the forefront of catalysis research at which novel catalysts are developed and novel reaction systems are described from scratch. Hence, in this concept paper common pitfalls in carrying out and reporting catalytic experiments ranging from heterogeneous thermal catalysis to photo- and electrocatalysis are briefly summarized and solutions how to avoid these issues are presented.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000470937300001

The growth mechanism and microstructure of CuWO4 are discussed in detail. The PEC measurements indicate that flowerlike CuWO(4 )exhibited a photocurrent density of 0.58 mA/cm(2) at 0.8 V versus RHE. When coupled with CdS and FeOOH layers, the triple CuWO4/CdS/FeOOH photoanode exhibited further improved PEC performance with a higher photocurrent density of about 2.05 mA/cm(2 )at 0.8 V versus RHE and excellent operation stability. The remarkable PEC performance stems from several crucial factors: (i) ideal band gap; (ii) improved light absorption; (iii) efficient charge-hole pair separation and collection.									27	2	0	0	3	0	27			0888-5885			WOS:000432093500019

The catalytically active Dy2O3 on graphitized carbon was synthesized from this particular Dy-CP via annealing. Generally, MOFs containing transition elements, such as Zn, Fe, and Co, have been studied for ORR, and they show very good activity as ORR catalysts. Although lanthanide-based perovskites have also been explored for ORR, lanthanide-based MOF/CPs have not been evaluated for the same. The promising activities of other transition metal-based oxides inspired us to study the ORR activity of the dysprosium-based CP. As a precursor molecule for porous nanocarbon synthesis, this Dy-based CP was graphitized under particular annealing conditions and its influence on the ORR activity was investigated.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000407304100021

Ni shown active-passive transition in acetic acid solutions of concentration 0.5 - 5 and 13 M. In the Solution of concentration 7 M and 10 M CH3COOH, the anodic curves were different, presenting either a continuous increase either ail oscillating current. The corrosion of Ni in acid acetic solutions is controlled by the diffusion of the dissolved oxygen at the interface metal/solution. The evolution hydrogen reaction has an insignificant roll in the Ni corrosion. The open circuit potentials after 24 hours of immersion in all acetic acid solutions have shown active values and therefore the spontaneous passivation of Ni is not possible.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0035-3930			WOS:000261193400006

IR measurements performed ex situ and in situ reveal the chemical reactions which take place during annealing at the interface of silicon bonded wafers with thin native (Si/Si) or thick thermally grown interfacial oxide (Si-SiO2/Si). A comparative analysis of the IR response of the buried interface in low temperature silicon bonded wafers prepared using different surface activation treatments is presented. The evolution with annealing temperature of the chemical species at the interface is used to explain the bonding mechanism of Si wafers in the temperature range of 30-400 degreesC. Very good bonding (similar to3000 mJ m(-2)) at 200 degreesC was obtained between pairs of Si wafers covered with native and thermally grown oxide in the case when the wafers were treated by reactive ion etching oxygen plasma.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0268-1242	1361-6641		WOS:000221732000009

These materials show hydrogen evolution rates with a sacrificial donor under broadband illumination that are between two and three times higher than the corresponding bulk polymers. The most active emulsion particles displayed a hydrogen evolution rate of 60.6mmol h(-1) g(-1) under visible light (lambda > 420 nm), which is the highest reported rate for an organic polymer. More importantly, the emulsion particles display far better catalytic lifetimes than previous polymer nanoparticles and they are also effective at high concentrations, allowing external quantum efficiencies as high as 20.4% at 420 nm. A limited degree of aggregation of the polymer particles maximizes the photocatalytic activity, possibly because of light scattering and enhanced light absorption.									62	0	0	0	5	0	62			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000457893400003

Here, by means of the first principles calculations, we propose a new strategy using a transition metal single-atom catalyst (SAC) anchored on a phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) cluster as a heterogeneous catalyst for the eNRR. We have systematically studied three reaction mechanisms, i.e., distal, alternating, and enzymatic pathways, respectively, for the eNRR on a Mo-1/PMA SAC via a six-proton and six-electron process, and found that the preferred mechanism is the enzymatic pathway with the smallest overpotential (eta) of 0.19 V. N-2 is first strongly adsorbed on Mo-1/PMA and then dissociated by the subsequent protonation process. In addition, we found that Mo-1/PMA can impede the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process and thus promotes the eNRR selectivity. The high catalytic activity of Mo-1/PMA for the eNRR is attributed to the high spin density on Mo, enhanced N-2 adsorption, stabilization of the N2H* species, and the destabilization of the NH2* species. The present work is further extended to investigate the kinetics of the conversion of N-2 to ammonia on Mo-1/PMA via an enzymatic mechanism. Our results expose that the calculated activation energy barrier for the protonation of N-2 to form the N2H4* species is kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable compared with other elementary steps. These results provide valuable guidance for NH3 synthesis using SACs at ambient temperature with high efficiency and low cost.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000730767200001

These groups bring hydrophilicity and reactivity to GO, as they are present on its basal plane or at the edges. Thus, their identification is essential to determine the chemical properties of GO. Amongst the possible analytical techniques, infrared spectroscopy is suitable to identify these groups. In this work, an advanced spectroscopic method, polarized attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy, was used to obtain a more in-depth analysis of these reactive groups. This new approach has allowed to refine the description of the functional groups at the surface and could be used to follow the evolution surface processes in material chemistry (e.g. grafting reactions).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-577X	1873-4979		WOS:000830205800008

For the construction of the electrocatalysts, a stable conductive substrate is generally required to the uniform distribution of the catalytic materials, where carbon-based materials are widely utilized. Herein, porous carbon skeletons were prepared after the annealing treatment of Al-porous coordination polymers with high specific surface area as the substrates for the growth of Ru nanoparticles via wet chemical reduction. The obtained electrocatalysts show a low overpotential of 39 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 26 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, outperforming the commercial Pt/C.

In recent years, it has become an important orientation to reduce the energy consumption of hydrogen production by replacing the energy-intensive oxygen evolution reaction with thermodynamically easier occurring reaction at the anode. Biomass is a low-cost carbon source with a wide range of sources. Biomass-assisted water electrolysis system can reduce the energy consumption of hydrogen production and cooperate in the production of high-value chemicals. This review summarizes the recent progress of biomass-assisted water electrolysis for hydrogen production, and introduces the principle of hydrogen production with low energy consumption and biomass oxidation path. Meanwhile, the influence of key factors on hydrogen production efficiency and biomass oxidation products is summarized. However, due to the complex molecular structure and large molecular weight of biomass, its electrochemical oxidation efficiency is low, and it needs heating to promote the electrochemical oxidation efficiency. The product selectivity is poor, and the oxidation mechanism is not clear. The key points of future research will be aimed at electrode materials, charge carriers and biomass pretreatment methods to improve hydrogen production efficiency.			高制氢电耗是限制电解水制氢规模化应用的瓶颈。近年来,采用热力学上更易发生的反应取代阳极高耗能的析氧反应,成为降低制氢电耗的重要方向。生物质作为成本低廉、来源广泛的碳源,其辅助的电解水体系,可降低制氢电耗30-60%并协同制备香兰素等高值化学品。总结了近年生物质辅助电解水制氢的研究进展,介绍了低电耗制氢的原理及生物质氧化路径,综述了关键因素对制氢效能及生物质氧化产物分布的影响。但生物质分子结构复杂,分子量大,其电化学氧化效率低,通常需加热才能达到理想效果,并且产物选择性差,氧化机理不明确。未来研究可从电极材料、电荷转移载体以及生物质预处理手段作为着手点,提升制氢效能及应用价值。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0253-231X			CSCD:7249724

However, NRR is limited by low faradic efficiencyand NH3yield because of a high-energy barrier for N2activationand competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

However, the nonequivalency between the amount of visible light absorbed and the photocatalytic activities limits its usage as photoanodes in the dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Herein, the synthesized black titania (BT) via imidazole at 400 degrees C; without washing steps, produces not only Ti2O3 and Ti3O5 nanoparticles but also allows the formation of the C3N4 nanosheets; which is emphasized via XRD, TEM-SAED-IFFT, FTIR, CV and XPS studies. The BT incorporated with hole transporting metals including Ag2O, CuO and Ag2S; at 3% loading, synthesized by deposition precipitation route are also fabricated to form p-n junction interfaces. The best conversion efficiency attained when using Ag2O/BT was 6%; that presented the highest IPCE% in the visible light margin of 500-750 nm, followed by CuO (5.6%) and BT (4.9%). Although Ag2O/BT did not absorb visible light as CuO, however, it offers minimum optical and electronic losses. Besides, it gives the highest dielectric constant (epsilon') value subsequent BT and exposes numerous active sites. Well correlations with vibrational, surface texturing, permittivity and electrical conductivity were achieved and discussed to have a view on the effect of the C3N4 interface as well as oxygen defect sites and the incorporation with metal oxide/sulfide groups. This work supplies a new aspect in the synthesis of g-C3N4 while synthesizing the oxygen deficient TiO2-x in solar energy conversion reactions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0927-0248	1879-3398		WOS:000694793600001

The results obtained reveal the specificity of lithium cation in strongly alkaline solutions, both as pure LiOH and as an additive to KOH solutions, consisting in inhibition of the dissolution of poorly crystallized fraction contained in the synthetic goethite sample during its long-term contact with alkaline electrolytes. The study of soluble ferric hydroxo forms in strong alkali demonstrated that transformation of polynuclear forms, which are characterized by a symmetric Mossbauer doublet, to mononuclear hydroxo complexes under certain conditions results in the change of the initial doublet to a symmetric singlet with the same parameters, which has not been observed for ferric oxide/hydroxide systems before. It obviously corresponds to the formation of a symmetric coordination sphere of mononuclear ferric hydroxo complexes statistically distributed in the NaOH.H2O matrix and is consistent with our earlier electron spectroscopic observations. The study of electrooxidation of the Ni-Fe (4:1 molar ratio) hydroxide system in 8 M KOH solution showed that the position of its resonant absorption remained constant indicating that the ferric component is electrochemically inactive remaining in the Fe(III) form, despite the nickel component oxidation. Nevertheless, the soluble products can be anodically oxidized in the oxygen evolution potential region, as well as reduced on the cathode.									21	0	0	0	0	0	22			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:A1991FX08000002

Additionally, under photoirradiation with blue light (lambda(max) = 469 nm), 1, together with ascorbic acid and [Ru(bpy)(3)]Cl-2 (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) in an aqueous buffer (pH 6.0), also affords hydrogen with a remarkable turnover number (TON) of 4314 mol of H-2 per mol of catalyst.

Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the van der Waals heterojunction consisting of PtS2 and GaSe monolayers is a potential step-scheme photocatalyst with high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency. The stability of the heterojunction is confirmed by phonon dispersion spectrum calculation and ab initio molecular-dynamics simulation. In such a step-scheme heterojunction, GaSe serves as a reduction photocatalyst and PtS2 acts as an oxidation photocatalyst. The built-in electric field and band bending are formed since the work function difference and electrostatic potential difference promote the photo-generated electron (hole) to the conductance band minimum (valence band maximum) of GaSe (PtS2), inducing a step-scheme migrating route and guaranteeing strong redox ability of photo-generated carriers. The hydrogen evolution reduction can proceed driven solely by the photogenerated electrons, while the barrier of the oxygen evolution reaction is only 0.89 eV. More intriguingly, the STH efficiency is predicted up to 36.9% along with the improvement of visible light absorption. The STH efficiency can be enhanced effectively by both in-plane strain and compressive vertical strain. Our findings provide valuable guidance for the potential applications of PtS2/GaSe heterojunction as a photocatalyst for the photocatalytic splitting of water.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8979	1089-7550		WOS:000860443900003

Water oxidation is a critically limiting anodic reaction of electrochemical water splitting and has been a research hotspot. However, significantly high overpotentials are usually required to overcome the large energy barriers of water oxidation. NiFe-based electrocatalysts have been suggested to be prospective candidates towards water oxidation, but improvement of their intrinsic activity still demands in-depth investigations. Over the past decades, anionic regulation has attracted increasing attention as a strategy to enhance the intrinsic activity of NiFe-based oxides/(oxy) hydroxides through tuning the electronic structures of cation active sites. This review focuses primarily on the recent advances of anion regulated NiFe-based electrocatalysts (NiFe oxides/(oxy)hydroxides) for water oxidation. Specifically, we highlight the water oxidation activity that is associated with different synthesis strategies and structural characterization studies of various NiFe oxides/(oxy) hydroxides regulated by different anions. By reviewing the advantages and limitations of these synthesis strategies, the future developing directions of NiFe-based energy materials are also prospected.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000719549700001

Its properties, as gauged by the shape and position of the reduction peak, vary significantly after ca. 20-30 cycles of potential and then become constant. The compact-alpha-oxide, which is present along with the beta-oxide at all times, can be reduced and reformed in potential sweep experiments, as well as thickened under potentiostatic conditions in the presence of the beta-oxide film, exactly as at a bare Pt electrode surface. This confirms that the alpha-oxide lies beneath a porous beta-oxide film. In addition, the kinetics of Fe2+ oxidation at a beta-oxide covered electrode has been investigated. The inhibition of this reaction by the oxide, as well as its other electrochemical properties, support the notion that the beta-oxide is a solvent-filled, highly porous, polymer-like material.									52	0	0	0	1	0	52			0022-0728			WOS:A1991EY38700011

RuO2-based electrocatalysts have been observed to evolve methanol at low overpotentials, which has been attributed to an alternative reaction mechanism with oxygen-coordinated intermediates that can circumvent the limitations imposed by the scaling relations on metal catalysts. Here, we introduce an innovative concept of ligand effects in oxide catalysts. Both IrO2 and RuO2 binds OH* and other intermediates from the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) strongly, but the stable and miscible system IrxRu(1-x)O2 exhibits anomalous weaker binding energy in the presence of CO* spectators, because of RuIr ligand effects. The weakened adsorbate binding leads to a very low CO2RR onset potential (methanol evolution at -0.2 V RHE). An Ir atom at the bridge site with Ru neighbors binds intermediates such as OH* and OCHO* much weaker, because of synergistic ligand effects and adsorbateadsorbate interactions. Consequently, a RuO2 surface doped with Ir move close to the top of the predicted CO2RR volcano for oxides, which offers a significant improvement over state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for conversion of CO2 into methanol. Analysis of electronic structure parameters with adsorbate binding energies indicates the ligand effect depletes electrons from the Ir atom and shifts the t(2g) orbitals. The lack of electron donation from CO* spectators to Ir at the active site cause favorable adsorbate binding.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000417230500058

Colossal dielectric permittivity (>= 10(5)) and a very low loss tangent (<1.5%) at 10 kHz were achieved. Furthermore, the ceramics exhibit excellent temperature stability with a broad operating temperature range (25-400 degrees C). The evolution of the concentrations of oxygen vacancies and reduced Ti3+ was estimated by the XPS. Defect dipole complexes, coupled between the negatively and positively charged defects, are responsible for the observed huge dielectric permittivity. Temperature dependence of dc conductivity demonstrates that the stability of the defect dipole complexes matches the temperature range of stable dielectric properties. The result bridges a relationship between defect dipoles and dielectric behavior to understand the huge permittivity response and low loss mechanism.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000708546000002

In COFs, the basic rigid molecular building blocks are linked through strong covalent bonds to produce two-dimensional and three-dimensional porous frameworks. COFs are an exciting class of nano-porous materials due to their structural diversity, exceptionally high porosity, and desired tailored chemical structural features. Due to the distinct characteristics of the COFs, they are currently being explored in a wide range of applications such as water decontamination, energy, gas storage, separation, adsorption, and sensing.

The value of Delta H(act)degrees for oxidation of aquated ammonia is estimated to be 39 kJ mol(-1) from data obtained in a flow-through reactor. The anodic peak potential for ethylamine is observed to vary linearly with the overpotential for anodic evolution of O-2 as a function of temperature. This is interpreted on the basis of the coupling of these anodic processes via the adsorbed hydroxyl species (OH) produced by anodic discharge of H2O as a prerequisite of both processes.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			0013-4651			WOS:A1996VC70600031

The negative electrode shows an electric double layer capacitor-type behavior. On the positive electrode, highly reversible Br-/Br-3(-) redox reactions take place, presenting a battery-type behavior, which contributes to increase the capacitance of the hybrid cell. The voltage window of the whole cell is extended up to 1.5 V because of the high over-potentials of oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in the neutral electrolyte. Compared with raw CNT, the FCNT has better wettability in the aqueous electrolyte and contributes to increase the electric double layer capacitance of the cell. As a result, the maximum energy density of 28.3 Wh kg(-1) is obtained from the hybrid EC at 0.5 A g(-1) without sacrificing its power density, which is around 4 times larger than that of the electrical double layer capacitor constructed by FCNT electrodes and 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Moreover, the discharge capacity retained 86.3% of its initial performance after 10000 cycles of galvanostatic charge and discharge test (10 A/g), suggesting its long life cycle even at high current loading.

Fe ions, as effective activity boosters for nickel-based catalysts, can effectively modulate the neatly arranged structure and electron configuration of MOF materials through the penetrating and etching process. Therefore, a Fe ion etching method was employed to modulate the structure and electronic configuration of bulk MOF. The resulting Ni-MOF-Fe-2 was equipped with a wider pore width distribution and lower crystallinity, and the Fe ion doping induced many dislocations and stacking faults in the lattice planes, which provided sufficient defects and active sites for OER. Therefore, Ni-MOF-Fe-2 displayed an advanced performance with an overpotential of 269 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the small Tafel slope of 47.1 mV dec(-1) and charge transfer resistances (R-ct) of 8.31 omega revealed its fast kinetics and high electron transfer efficiency, indicating that Fe ion etching played an important role in booting OER performance of Ni MOF.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2052-1537		WOS:000841174100001

Precise control of the surface structure at the atomic level can effectively tune the electrocatalytic performance of materials. Here, an in situ electrochemical post-treatment technique to rebuild a highly crystalline and stable multilayered Pd-skin structure on Pd47Cu53 nanotubes (NTs) via dealloying and atomic rearrangement is reported. The structural and compositional evolution of Pd47Cu53 NTs is tracked through the whole post-treatment process, involving sequential cyclic voltammetry (CV) and potentiostatic chronoamperometry (PC) treatments. The post-treated Pd47Cu53 NTs not only preserve the original tubular structure of the pristine materials, as-prepared Pd47Cu53 NTs, but also extensively improve the crystallinity of discrete nanoparticles (NPs) along the NTs. By comparing their catalytic performance toward ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), the construction of a multilayered Pd-skin surface is capable of greatly enhancing the catalytic stability of Pd47Cu53 NTs.

Unfortunately, they are typically formed in low concentrations and mixed with impurities due to the current limitations of traditional CO2 electrolysers as well as CO2RR catalysts. In this Perspective, we emphasize that while the declining renewable electricity price can greatly lower the formation cost of liquid fuels, the downstream purification process will add an extra layer of cost that greatly harms their economic feasibility for large-scale applications. Different strategies in reactor engineering and catalyst improvement are proposed to realize the direct and continuous generation of high-purity and high-concentration liquid fuels from CO2RR electrolysers, allowing this electrochemical route to become more competitive compared with the traditional chemical engineering industry in the future.Liquid fuels produced by electrocatalytic CO2 reduction are costly to separate from liquid electrolytes in a conventional cell. This Perspective identifies the need for novel cell designs that can directly produce high-concentration and high-purity products and discusses the progress towards this goal using porous solid electrolytes.									22	2	0	0	1	0	22			2520-1158			WOS:000720437900009

Thus, we sought to characterize the functional groups and suspension charge behavior of nitrogen-doped graphene (NDG) prepared in the absence of hydrazine, a highly toxic reagent. The hydrothermal reaction of graphite oxide (GO) with ammonia was shown to effectively remove oxygen and to restore the graphitic framework within the resulting NDG sheets. The enhanced graphitic character of the NDG materials was verified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetic analysis, and electrical conductivity measurements. With six hours of reaction time (sample NDG-6), up to 9.6 wt % (7.1 atomic %) of nitrogen could be introduced into the graphene. All the NDG materials exhibited excellent dispersibility in water allowing their surface charge to be probed by measuring zeta potential (zeta) as a function of suspension pH. The NDG-6 material could hold surface charge ranging from zeta = -50 mV to zeta = +20 mV, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the widest range of surface charges measured on a colloidal graphene material.									58	1	0	0	10	0	58			1932-7447			WOS:000301766800004

Included was species transport, as well as complex chemical reactions in the simulations. It was found that the algebraic SGS model satisfactory predicts experimental data for the mean flow field. A detailed description of multiphase flow was used and developed to simulate the time evolution of scalar and reactive mixing in a bubble column. An analysis involving the scale of segregation Phi, a metric that characterizes the mean driving force for mixing, is applied for the first time to multiphase flow. The study shows that Phi is inversely proportional to the bubble diameter at constant gas-feed rate, but only a weak function of the gas-feed rate. Also, we observed significant differences of mixing metrics in reactive and nonreactive systems.

In dense molecular cloud models, at a later stage of the evolution, the O-2 molecule may become a substantial grain mantle constituent. Since IR dipole vibrational transitions for the homonuclear diatomic molecule O-2 are forbidden, the abundance of this potentially important grain mantle component can not be determined. However, embedded in a dirty ice matrix, the fundamental vibration of O-2 at similar to 1550 cm(-1) becomes observable at 10 K, due to interactions with surrounding molecules, which break the symmetry of molecular oxygen. This process might be applicable for the dust mantle environment of interstellar grains. We have studied the role of solid O-2 and O-3 in astrophysically relevant ice mixtures and discuss the possible detection of solid O-2 and its major photolysis product O-3 in interstellar grains, in dense molecular clouds. Both molecules represent a specific target to be observed by the ISO satellite in the near future.

This undoubtedly evidences that, for metal sulfides, the atom-scale cation/anion vacancy pair and surface electronic spin state can play a great role in enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction. Inspired by the theoretical prediction, interconnected selenium (Se) wired ultrathin Co3S4 (Se-x-Co3S4) nanosheets with Co/S (Se) dual-vacancies (Se-1.0-Co3S4-V-S/Se-V-Co) pairs are constructed by a simple approach. As an efficient sulfur host material, in an ultralow-concentration KOH solution (0.1 m), Se-1.0-Co3S4-V-S/Se-V-Co presents outstanding durability up to 165 h and a low overpotential of 289.5 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which outperform the commercial Co3S4 nanosheets (NSs) and RuO2. Moreover, the turnover frequency of Se-1.0-Co3S4-V-S/Se-V-Co is 0.00965 s(-1) at an overpotential of 0.39 V, which is 5.7 times that of Co3S4 NSs, and 5.8 times that of commercial RuO2. The finding offers a rational design strategy to create the multi-defect structure in catalysts toward high-efficiency water electrolysis.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000762619500001	35233940

Herein, we demonstrated the construction of large-size and ultrathin NiCoP nanosheets on hierarchical Fe2O3 nanorod photoanodes for significantly promoting the PEC water oxidation activity. Specifically, the obtained NiCoP/Fe2O3 photoanodes exhibited an excellent photocurrent density of 3.8 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Comprehensive investigations reveal that the tight interfacial interaction could effectively facilitate the rapid transfer of photogenerated holes from Fe2O3 to NiCoP, and the abundant surface active sites on large-size and ultrathin NiCoP cocatalysts dramatically enhance the OER kinetics. These findings may offer a new insight into rational regulation of the photoanode/cocatalyst interface for highly efficient PEC water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000810618000001

The synthesized samples are denoted as Co3O4-1 and Co3O4-2. Structural and morphological properties of as-prepared samples were characterized by XRD, FTIR, XPS, SEM, and HR-TEM techniques. The electrochemical characteristics for the urea oxidation (UOR) on Ni-doped Co3O4 catalyst were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS), and chronoamperometry (CA). The Ni-doped Co3O4 with the lower Ni percentage (Co3O4-1) exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity toward the UOR than Co3O4-2. Co3O4-1 had a high surface area and pore size, which influence the UOR. Co3O4-1 showed high stability up to 10,000 s. Overall, Co(3)O4(-)1 has significant potential in energy consumption and wastewater treatment.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000733644100004

These defects considerably limit their catalytic activity in oxygen evolution reactions (OERs). This study involves the preparation of manganese iron oxide modified using flaky cobalt phosphide. The obtained product exhibits good OER catalytic performance in a 1 M alkaline solution, which shows a low overpotential of 320 mV for the OER at 50 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, modified manganese iron oxide exhibits a low Tafel slope of 65.58 mVdec(-1). After the introduction of flaky cobalt phosphide, the increase of the active area and conductivity of manganese iron oxide significantly improves the OER performance of the sample.

Herein, cost-effective, renewable biomass chitosan was used to prepare a N-doped carbon modified with iron oxide catalyst (Fe2O3@NC) for nitrile synthesis. The iron oxide nanoparticles were uniformly wrapped in the N-doped carbon matrix to prevent their aggregation and leaching. Fe2O3@NC-800, which was subjected to carbonization at 800 degrees C, exhibited excellent activity, selectivity, and stability in the catalytic ammoxidation of aromatic aldehydes to aromatic nitriles. This study may provide a new method for the fabrication of an efficient and cost-effective catalyst system for synthesizing nitriles.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2468-8231			WOS:000604626700010

However, it is still a large challenge to obtain high efficient catalysts for full water electrolysis. Herein, we design novel sandwich-like FeCo2O4@FeCo2S4@PPy catalysts through a facile preparation strategy. The as-fabricated samples present an excellent electrocatalytic performance with an overpotential of 98.2 mV for HER at -10 mA cm(-2), 280 mV for OER and a cell voltage of 1.63 V at 50 mA cm(-2). The outstanding performances can be contributed to in-situ electrochemical activation and synergistic effects of electrode materials. It benefits to surface/interface modulation forming active Co and Fe oxyhydroxides in electrochemical reaction process.									106	3	0	0	4	0	107			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000532789900008

The resulting porous particles exhibit high total surface areas (internal and external) but determining the magnitude of the interface remains challenging. Furthermore, assessing the chemical accessibility of the catalytic interface presents an additional difficulty. Taking three structurally related but different sized platinum nanoparticle samples (30-70 nm), we demonstrate how the catalytic rate of two archetypal surface limited reactions scale not with the square of the particle radius but with a power law of 2.6-2.9. This power law directly reflects the mesoporosity of the nanoparticles; the internal surface of the nanoparticles is both chemically accessible and contributes to the catalytic activity. For the 70 nm particles, up to 60% of the catalytic surface is contained in the internal structure of the particle.									15	3	0	0	1	0	15			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000487555400066	31501845

Such photoanodes, fabricated without the need for additional protecting layers, a buried junction, and high vacuum techniques, show a high photovoltage of similar to 500 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), state-of-the-art photocurrents, and faradaic efficiencies > 90% under AM 1.5G illumination conditions at pH 14. Remarkably, these photoelectrodes are stable and can be operated at the light limited catalytic current from 10 h to more than 40 h in 1 M NaOH. These findings demonstrate that robust and efficient Si-based photoanodes can be produced easily, which opens new opportunities for the implementation of low-cost Si-based monolithic photoelectrochemical cells for efficient solar fuel production.									47	2	0	0	2	0	46			2380-8195			WOS:000396385000007

Accordingly, the electrochemical oxidation of SO2 in aqueous 1.0 x 10(-1) mol/L NaClO4 has been studied at pH 2.3 using platinum and glassy carbon electrodes. On the platinum electrode SO2 oxidation occurred on the forward scan at 0.96 V and on the reverse scan at 0.63 V. For GC, a single SO2 oxidation peak occurred at 1.40 V on the forward scan. SO2 oxidation on both electrode substrates was hampered by oxide layer formation. The electrode could be reactivated however, by oxide layer reduction. Although reactivation was most successful for platinum, SO2 oxidation on platinum is quite complex, with this evidenced by the reverse scan anodic peak. Glassy carbon shows simpler behaviour and thus, is the preferred substrate for SO2 oxidation.

Electrooxidation is an alternative synthetic route that can help scientists conduct desired changes in organic compounds. In this study, we investigated the Ti/RuXTi(1-X)O2 system and used safrole (SF) as model substrate, to understand the role played by electrode composition in organic substances oxidation. We characterized the surface of the prepared electrodes and conducted controlled potential electrolysis with potential pulse, which oxidized 98 % SF. Electrode efficiency depended on the electrode composition-higher RuO2 concentration led to a more efficient process. Our results showed that all the electrodes generated the same intermediates regardless of the composition, indicating that the same reaction mechanism occurred in all cases, as corroborated by mechanistic parameters. Electrolysis under controlled current generated the same intermediates as electrolysis under controlled potential. The main difference between these two types of electrolyses was that controlled current promoted at least five times faster reaction, which resulted in substrate mineralization, an outcome that is not interesting for the synthetic process.									7	0	0	0	4	0	7			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000328166300018

Mechanisms and reaction pathways of electrochemical oxidation of phenol at BDD electrode was investigated. The results showed that phenol with different initial concentrations was completely mineralized to CO_2 at BDD electrode, favoring electrochemical combustion. Phenol with high initial concentration was initially converted to intermediates and then finally mineralized to GO_2. Phenol with low initial concentration was rapidly mineralized to CO_2. Phenol degradation at high current density resulted in high removal rate for phenol and total organic carbon (TOC) but low mineralization current efficiency (MCE), which arose from side reaction of oxygen evolution. Phenol degradation pathway was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). It was found that the para site of phenol was attacked by· OH radical first, then formed hydroquinone and the ring was broken into maleic acid,fumaric acid and acetic acid. Maleic acid and fumaric acid were reduced into succinic acid at cathode which were further oxidized into malonic acid, acetic acid or formic acid.

Adult mammals and birds are delineated from their early ontogenetic stages, as well as from other vertebrates, by high resting metabolic rates and consequent internal heat production. We used the embryonic development of a bird (Gallus gallus) as a model to investigate the metabolic transition between ectothermy and endothermy. Increases in aerobic capacity occur at two functional levels that are regulated independently from each other: (i) upregulation of gene expression; and (ii) significant increases in the catalytic activity of the main oxidative control enzymes. Anaerobic capacity, measured as lactate dehydrogenase activity, is extremely high during early development, but diminishes at the same time as aerobic capacity increases. Changes in lactate dehydrogenase activity are independent from its gene expression. The regulatory mechanisms that lead to endothermic metabolic capacity are similar to those of ectotherms in their response to environmental change. We suggest that the phylogenetic occurrence of endothermy is restricted by its limited selective advantages rather than by evolutionary innovation.									20	1	0	0	19	0	21			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000235238100007	16537127

The role of oxygen in the synthesis of this MOF was investigated. Copper metal is formed along with the MOF when the synthesis is done in argon as suggested by XRD. When the reaction was exposed to air with vigorous stirring, copper metal was not observed by XRD. However, if there is no stirring, then copper metal is formed, and we learned that this is because oxygen was not allowed to enter the solvent due to the formation of a MOF film at the air/water interface. For the sample synthesized in argon (Cu-3(TABTO)(2)-Ar), an insulating Cu-3(TABTO)(2)-Ar pellet (sigma < 10(-10) S cm(-1)) became a metallic conductor with an electrical conductivity of 0.78 S cm(-1) at 300 K after exposure to iodine vapor. This work provides further insights into the role of oxygen in the synthesis of redox-active ligand-based MOFs, expands the family of 2D redox-active ligand-based electrically conductive MOFs, and offers more opportunities in sensing, photocatalytic, electronic, and energy-related applications.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000582673500011	33021791

However, it is hindered by the complex oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with sluggish kinetics. NiFe-based catalysts, which are known for their high activity, durability, and low-cost, have been a "hot topic" in research on OER catalysts. Increasing numbers of reports have indicated that Fe sites provide active centers. Meanwhile, Fe is considered as the cheapest and one of the most abundant transition-metal elements. Herein, we report a facile and fast method to prepare iron-phosphate films supported on a nickel foam scaffold (Fe-Pi/NF), with exposed Fe sites at the surface. Fe-Pi/NF exhibited outstanding activity for the OER, requiring low overpotentials of 215 and 257 mV to drive current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, in 1 M KOH solution. The TOF was as high as 0.381 s(-1) at an overpotential of 270 mV. The Tafel slope was as low as 28 mV dec(-1) between current densities of around 30 to 125 mA cm(-2). It also exhibited excellent durability during a 90 h stability test, and the calculated faradaic efficiency was close to 96%. For comparison, Fe(OH)(3)/NF electrodes were also prepared. The results showed the OER activity of Fe-Pi/NF to be superior to those of Fe(OH)(3)/NF. The incorporation of electronegative phosphate groups results in the great hydrophilicity of Fe-Pi/NF and effectively adjusts the electronic structure of Fe3+ and facilitates the oxidation of Fe3+ to Fe4+.									50	2	0	0	2	0	50			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000410597200034

The coupling reaction of A(2)B- and A(3)-corroles with glycine ethyl ester and taurine under strong basic conditions proved to be successful and yielded di- and trifunctionalized corrole amino acid conjugates in good yields. The subsequent metalation of the corrole/amino acid conjugates broadens the scope for applications considerably. As examples, we herein show the catalytic activity of the Mn(III) A(3)-corrole towards O-2 evolution. First we employed tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) as oxidant to obtain the Mn(V)oxo species and tetrabutyl ammonium hydroxide (TBAH) as hydroxide donor agent. Furthermore, the binding properties of the non-metalated and the Mn(III) A(3)-corrole/amino sulfonic acid conjugates and transport of proteins were investigated and the conjugates exhibited binding to human serum albumin (HSA). Finally, a novel Ga(III) A(3)-corrole/amino sulfonic acid derivative was synthesized and we briefly describe the photophysical properties of this compound.

J	Giorgio, S.; Cabie, M.; Henry, C.R.								Dynamic observations of Au catalysts by environmental electron microscopy								Gold Bulletin				41	2			84	90						July 2008	2008	Au clusters in the size range (1-8 nm), supported on MgO and TiO2, are studied at the atomic scale by High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), in standard conditions and during cycles of gas treatments by environmental HRTEM. Their morphology, the structure of the interface with the substrate and their adhesion energy are deduced from top and profile views, according to the preparation techniques, by atomic deposition in ultra high vacuum or by deposition precipitation in wet conditions. Under hydrogen atmosphere the gold clusters exhibit a truncated octahedron shape while under oxygen they show a rounding of the shape. These evolution are reversible in hydrogen / oxygen cycles. In the case of the CO oxidation by Au clusters supported on TiO2, the formation of CO2 in the microscope sample holder is evidenced by a differentially pumped mass spectrometer connected to the environmental sample holder, at the same time as the rounding of the clusters. The implication of the shape evolution in CO oxidation is discussed.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0017-1557			INSPEC:11017811

Rh and Rh Alloy Nanoparticles as Highly Active H-2 Oxidation Catalysts for Alkaline Fuel Cells								ACS CATALYSIS				9	6			5057	5062		10.1021/acscatal.9b00906				JUN 2019	2019	When moving from acidic to alkaline media, non-Pt-group metal catalysts can be used as the oxygen reduction catalyst, because of their high activity and stability. However, in alkaline electrolytes, we meet another challenge: slower H-2 oxidation kinetics on platinum group metals, relative to acidic electrolytes. We require new robust anode catalysts to enhance H-2 oxidation kinetics in alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). In this Letter, carbon-supported Rh and Rh alloy nanoparticles such as Pt7Rh3/C, Ir9Rh1/C, Rh9Ru1/C and Rh9Pd1/C were found to be highly active hydrogen oxidation and evolution catalysts in alkaline media. A size effect was observed for Rh/C, i.e., the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity significantly increased on Rh nanoparticles, relative to bulk Rh. A synergistic effect was noted for the hydrogen oxidation on PtRh and IrRh alloy catalysts. These Rh and Rh alloy nanoparticles outperformed Ir/C and Pt/C as electrocatalysts. In particular, Rh/C with an average particle size of ca. 2 nm was identified to be the best HOR catalyst among all catalysts studied, in terms of its mass activity, while Pt7Rh3/C outperformed other studied catalysts, in terms of its specific activity and exchange current density. Ir9Rh1/C was found to be the most effective electrocatalyst among all studied Ir alloy nanoparticles. These Rh and Rh alloy catalysts could be employed as highly active H-2 electrocatalysts in anion exchange membrane fuel cells.									33	3	0	0	4	0	33			2155-5435			WOS:000471212600033

Biomedical applications, in particular, the application for root canal disinfection, have motivated fundamental studies of single-electrode microplasma jets. In this work, a single-electrode nanosecond pulsed microplasma jet and its interaction with liquid water are evaluated via spatiotemporal optical emission spectroscopy as well as nanosecond gated imaging. The helium microplasma jet was generated in atmospheric air by delivering 8 kV, 164 ns pulses at a pulse repetition rate of 500 Hz. When the microplasma jet impinged on water surface, the spatiotemporal optical emission spectroscopy identified a number of reactive plasma species including O*, OH*, He*, N2*, N2+*, and Halpha*. The presence of liquid water produced an approximately 10 times increase in the optical emission intensity compared to water not being present. As such, the presence of water has led to a significant increase in OH radical concentrations. Nanosecond gated imaging showed that the radius of the plasma plume varied with time between the nozzle and the water surface and presented a different propagation behavior from those in air.					2015 42nd IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)2015 42nd IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)	24-28 May 201524-28 May 2015		Antalya, TurkeyAntalya, Turkey	0	0	0		0	0	0						INSPEC:15360906

The purpose of this study is the illustration of good anticorrosion activity of virgin Pb anodes compared to recycled one in industrial operation, while the compositions of both of them are the same which obtained from quantmetry method. Design/methodology/approach Its corrosion properties and electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction were appraised using potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, galvanostatic polarization and ionic equilibrium methods. In addition, composition of anodes investigated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) method. The surface composition of samples was studied via X-ray diffractogram (XRD). Findings The results indicate that the anodes display different anodic behaviors during the galvanostatic polarization. Virgin Pb anode shows a "potential reduction" about 320 mV lower than recycled Pb anode after 6 h of polarization; also, the stable potential after 72 h for virgin Pb anode is 100 mV lower than recycled Pb anode. Also, The XPS results show a trace amount of Cl in recycled anodes which cause the more corrosion activity. XRD results indicate that virgin Pb anodes have been covered by more oxides than recycled anodes after 72 h of electrowinning. Originality/value The treatment of corrosion behavior by virginity has not been detected by any researchers yet. Therefore, it is imperative to study the corrosion behavior and exact composition analysis of virgin and recycled Pb anodes to comprehension of them. This paper fulfills this need.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0003-5599	1758-4221		WOS:000581201600001

The structure and morphology are mainly characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). HBZ-1 sample with the structure of Co/Co(OH)(2)/C@B has the best onset potential of 1.075 V vs. RHE at 0.1 mA cm(-2) and the best catalyst stability among all of the materials researched. Especially as its pyrolyzing product, the CBZ-1 sample with the structure of Co/CoO/C@B behaves the most excellent synthetically electrocatalytic performance with low onset potential of 1.444 V vs. RHE at 0.1 mA cm(-2) and a small overpotential of 390 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is better than that of RuO2. This good catalytic activity is mainly attributed to the generation of CoO phase and synergistic effect of all the phases in the composite structure. Furthermore, the CBZ-1 sample has the appropriate catalytic stability which attributed to the three-phase structure of Co/CoO/C@B composite and the existing of a little B element.

Surface morphology, structural quality and related impurity incorporation are very sensitive to the growth temperature. A significant difference of yellow luminescence is observed and attributed to the incorporation of carbon into GaN films, which is confirmed by SIMS analysis. Our results show that the sample with triangular-pit morphology has significantly higher concentrations of oxygen than the other sample with pentagon-like pit morphology, which is induced by the existence of an N-face in triangular pits.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0256-307X	1741-3540		WOS:000362732800038

Toward this end, design of efficient electrocatalysts is of critical significance. While extensive research has been extended to develop excellent electrocatalysts, the fundamental understanding of the relationship between the electronic and structural properties of electrocatalysts and the catalytic activity must remain a priority. In this review, the activity modulation of electrocatalysts by charge transfer effects, including intramolecular and intermolecular charge transfer, is systematically introduced. With suitable charge transfer modification, such as heteroatom doping, defect engineering, molecule functionalization, and heterojunctions, the electrocatalytic activity of carbon-based electrocatalysts can be significantly boosted. The manipulation of the electronic structure of carbon-based materials by charge transfer may serve as a fundamental mechanism for performance enhancement. After establishing an understanding of the relationship between catalytic activity and charge transfer, the opportunities and challenges for the design of electrocatalyst with charge transfer effects are discussed.									101	7	0	0	2	0	102			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000473963200001

HRTEM images reveal the origin of the strain to be lattice defects such as stacking faults. The strained beta-TaON was found to be the clearly less active semiconductor in photochemical and photoelectrochemical water oxidation.

We consider a delayed-detonation model that assumes a deflagration-to-detonation transition. In contrast with the pure deflagration model, the delayed-detonation model releases enough energy to account for a healthy explosion, and does not leave carbon, oxygen, and intermediate-mass elements in central parts of a white dwarf. This removes the key disagreement between simulations and observations, and makes a delayed detonation the mostly likely mechanism for type Ia supernovae.									101	3	0	0	0	0	103			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000221713300007	15245271

Concepts of the designated procedure are summarized with emphasis on the carboxylic acids generated as intermediate products during anodic degradation of 4-chlorophenol and benzoquinone. Data are summarized for various electrode materials including oxide-covered Pt, as well as PbO2 and SnO2 films that are heavily doped with altervalent metallic cations. The anodic degradation reactions have in common the fact that they involve transfer of O-atoms from H2O in the solvent phase to the oxidation products. Therefore, variations in reactivity of electrode materials are ascribed to differences in the extent of electrocatalytic participation of these electrode surfaces within the anodic O-transfer mechanisms. Results are explained on the basis of the following mechanistic speculations: (1) a prerequisite of the required anodic O-transfer reactions is the discharge of H2O to generate adsorbed hydroxyl radicals; (2) a co-requisite is preadsorption of the reactant species; (3) the O-transfer step occurs from (OH)(ads) to (R)(ads); and (4) an inevitable but undesirable concomitant reaction is the anodic evolution of O-2(g). The expected benefit of elevated anode temperature is verified for degradation of acetic acid at a Pt anode. Also, cyanuric acid generated as a stable product of photocatalytic degradation processes is demonstrated to be degraded by anodic reaction at a Pt electrode. Recovery of nitrate is approximately 70% during degradation of cyanuric acid and it is speculated that some volatile N-species is lost during the procedure. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this work, Ni-0-rich Ni/NiO nanocrystals were facilely synthesized on the surface of acid-treated nickel foam via thermal annealing in Ar/H-2 (denoted as NF@Acid-H-2). The three-dimensional free-standing NF@Acid-H-2 electrode exhibited high HER and UOR activities at 156 mV and at 1.33 V to reach the current density of 10 mA/cm(2), respectively. The urea electrolyzer needed a cell voltage of 1.49 V to deliver the current density of 10 mA/cm(2), and could continuously generate H-2 for 20 h with negligible activity loss. Systematic study revealed that the presence of Ni-0 played a significant role to improve both HER and UOR performance. In particular, the Ni-0-rich Ni/NiO exhibited better catalytic performance than that of Ni-0-less counterpart. This work proved that the high urea electrolysis performance was dependent on the rational design of non-precious metal electrocatalysts with controllable compositions and hierarchical nanostructures.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000488957400049

Nevertheless, the fabrication of nano HEAs at large-scale is still challenging. Herein, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, cathodic plasma electrolysis deposition (CPED) is utilized to develop FeCoNiMnCu HEA dendrites which are self-assembled by single HEA nanoparticles. These particles were examined to be face-centered cubic, having a size less than 40 nm and being randomly stacked together porously. The dendrites appear a 3D structure and leave a gap of approximately 5 um in between, leading to a significantly large surface area. Along with the highly deformed lattices with defects, this unique nanostructure achieves the very high efficient OER performance with an overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH solution. FeCoNiMnCu HEA dendrites also show outstanding electrochemical stability and are claimed that no compositional reorganization occurs after the long-term durability test. This work provides a new route to synthesize nanoscale HEAs for energy storage and conversion in a large-scale base for practical commercialization.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707126000229

A crucial physical mechanism in any SN Ia model is the initiation of the detonation front that ultimately unbinds the white dwarf progenitor and leads to the SN Ia. We demonstrate, for the first time, how a carbon detonation may arise in a realistic three-dimensional turbulent electron-degenerate flow, in a new mechanism we refer to as turbulently driven detonation. Using both analytic estimates and three-dimensional numerical simulations, we show that strong turbulence in the distributed burning regime gives rise to intermittent turbulent dissipation that locally enhances the nuclear burning rate by orders of magnitude above the mean. This turbulent enhancement to the nuclear burning rate leads in turn to supersonic burning and a detonation front. As a result, turbulence plays a key role in preconditioning the carbon-oxygen fuel for a detonation. The turbulently driven detonation initiation mechanism leads to a wider range of conditions for the onset of carbon detonation than previously thought possible, with important ramifications for SNe Ia models.									5	0	1	0	0	0	6			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000467111100003

Here we construct a ternary titanium dioxide/ nitrogen-doped carbon dot/gold (TiO2/NCD/Au) complex as the model catalyst to investigate the kinetic indexes at their interfaces. Under irradiation (200 mW cm(-2)), the photocurrent density of TiO2/NCD/Au is 10.26 mA cm(-2), which is higher than those of TiO2/Au (4.34 mA cm(-2)), TiO2/NCD (7.55 mA cm(-2)) and TiO2 (3.34 mA cm(-2)). The evolved oxygen of TiO2/NCD/Au reaches 125.8 lmol after 5000 s test. The energy bands of complexes are very similar to that of the unmodified TiO2 catalyst due to the low content modification of NCDs and Au. In addition, the transient photovoltage (TPV) tests with a series of control samples show differences about the carriers' separation and transfer process, which verify that Au can increase the separation quantity of electron-hole pairs while NCDs play a more important role on the increase of the separation quantity and separation rate simultaneously. This work quantifies the function of each component in a composite catalyst and deepens the understanding of the catalyst interface design. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

J	Inagaki, Noritoshi								Processing of D1 Protein: A Mysterious Process Carried Out in Thylakoid Lumen								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES				23	5					2520	10.3390/ijms23052520				MAR 2022	2022	In oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, D1 protein, a core subunit of photosystem II (PSII), displays a rapid turnover in the light, in which D1 proteins are distinctively damaged and immediately removed from the PSII. In parallel, as a repair process, D1 proteins are synthesized and simultaneously assembled into the PSII. On this flow, the D1 protein is synthesized as a precursor with a carboxyl-terminal extension, and the D1 processing is defined as a step for proteolytic removal of the extension by a specific protease, CtpA. The D1 processing plays a crucial role in appearance of water-oxidizing capacity of PSII, because the main chain carboxyl group at carboxyl-terminus of the D1 protein, exposed by the D1 processing, ligates a manganese and a calcium atom in the Mn4CaO5-cluster, a special equipment for water-oxidizing chemistry of PSII. This review focuses on the D1 processing and discusses it from four angles: (i) Discovery of the D1 processing and recognition of its importance: (ii) Enzyme involved in the D1 processing: (iii) Efforts for understanding significance of the D1 processing: (iv) Remaining mysteries in the D1 processing. Through the review, I summarize the current status of our knowledge on and around the D1 processing.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1422-0067		WOS:000768265800001	35269663

During a reaction, adsorbates as well as strain may cause the catalyst's surface to reorganize, which can lead to great changes in the reaction energetics and structures of reaction intermediates. Surface restructure is more prominent for certain metals than others. To better utilize strain to affect reaction, we need first to properly characterize transition metals according to their surface property change caused by adsorbates and strain. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the synergistic effect of a representative adsorbate O* and strain (biaxial, +/- 5%) on the close-packed surfaces of 27 transition metals are systematically investigated. The metals can be roughly characterized as strain-sensitive or strain-insensitive using three descriptors: two variations of the O formation energy both in the absolute (Delta E-form) and relative sense (Delta E-form%), and the maximum vertical displacement of metal atoms (Z(i)). For strain-sensitive metals, the criteria are Delta E-form > 0.60 eV, Delta E-form% > 20% and Z(i) > 0.50 angstrom within the considered strain variation range. According to the isolated O* model, Zn and Cd are found to be strain-sensitive, while Zn, Cd, Pt, and Au are screened out as strain-sensitive metals when using the double-O* model with two neighboring O* adatoms, suggesting the categorization is strongly O coverage dependent. In principle, for these strain-sensitive transition metals, strain can be effectively utilized to control the energetics, selectivity, and mechanism of reactions involving O* adatoms.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000741016000001

In this study, the influence of seven alkaline additives (KOH, K 2 CO 3 , KHCO 3 , CH 3 COOK, NaOH, Ca(OH) 2 , and Mg(OH) 2 ) on biomass pyrolysis was investigated in fixed-bed system, as well as the reaction mechanism through combining the evolution properties of biochar, bio-oil, gas products, and alkaline additives. Results showed that alkaline additives promoted the formation of biochar and gas products, while inhibited the generation of bio-oil. The content of phenols (reaching 80% for NaOH, mainly non?methoxy phenols) and hydrocarbons (reaching 38% for Ca(OH) 2 , mainly aromatics) increased greatly at the cost of acetic acid and O-species. Carbon content of biochar decreased largely, while oxygen content increased greatly, and the main O-containing species were ?OH, -O?C = O and -COOH groups. The surface area of biochar also increased greatly (reaching 764 m 2 /g for KOH). During pyrolysis process, alkaline additives could react with high active O-containing species and carbon fragments to generate lots of vacancies, then some anions of alkaline additive quickly occupied these vacancies to form new O-containing groups in biochar. Alkaline additives also converted into more stable structure (K 2 CO 3 , Na 2 CO 3 , CaO, and MgO). The possible reaction pathway between biomass and alkaline additives was first proposed.(c) 2020 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	Broska, Igor; Petrik, Igor					Broska, Igor/0000-0002-8464-8976			Variscan thrusting in I- and S-type granitic rocks of the Tribec Mountains, Western Carpathians (Slovakia): evidence from mineral compositions and monazite dating								GEOLOGICA CARPATHICA				66	6			455	+		10.1515/geoca-2015-0038				DEC 2015	2015	The Tribec granitic core (Tatric Superunit, Western Carpathians, Slovakia) is formed by Devonian/Lower Carboniferous, calc-alkaline I- and S-type granitic rocks and their altered equivalents, which provide a rare opportunity to study the Variscan magmatic, post-magmatic and tectonic evolution. The calculated P-T-X path of I-type granitic rocks, based on Fe-Ti oxides, hornblende, titanite and mica-bearing equilibria, illustrates changes in redox evolution. There is a transition from magmatic stage at T ca. 800-850 degrees C and moderate oxygen fugacity (FMQ buffer) to an oxidation event at 600 degrees C between HM and NNO up to the oxidation peak at 480 degrees C and HM buffer, to the final reduction at ca. 470 degrees C at Delta NN = 3.3. Thus, the post-magmatic Variscan history recorded in I-type tonalites shows at early stage pronounced oxidation and low temperature shift back to reduction. The S-type granites originated at temperature 700-750 degrees C at lower water activity and temperature. The P-T conditions of mineral reactions in altered granitoids at Variscan time (both I and S-types) correspond to greenschist facies involving formation of secondary biotite. The Tribec granite pluton recently shows horizontal and vertical zoning: from the west side toward the east S-type granodiorites replace I-type tonalites and these medium/coarse-grained granitoids are vertically overlain by their altered equivalents in greenschist facies. Along the Tribec mountain ridge, younger undeformed leucocratic granite dykes in age 342 +/- 4.4 Ma cut these metasomatically altered granitic rocks and thus post-date the alteration process. The overlaying sheet of the altered granites is in a low-angle superposition on undeformed granitoids and forms "a granite duplex" within Alpine Tatric Superunit, which resulted from a syn-collisional Variscan thrusting event and melt formation similar to 340 Ma. The process of alteration may have been responsible for shifting the oxidation trend to the observed partial reduction.									14	0	0	0	5	0	14			1335-0552	1336-8052		WOS:000367471300002

However, the opportune adsorptions of intermediate oxygen and hydrogen species on catalytic active sites are prerequisites for the design of high-performing bifunctional electrocatalysts to simultaneously drive oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER/HER). In this work, we developed a dual metal doping strategy to manipulate the d-band centers of non-precious transition metal phosphides aiming at optimal intermediate adsorption towards robust overall water splitting. The Ni and Mn atom incorporated FeP nanoarrays (Ni-Mn-FeP) were grown directly on NiFe foam via sequential etching-depositing and phosphorization processes. As for the well-known sluggish OER process, Ni-Mn-FeP only requires an overpotential of 185 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media. Meanwhile, the HER can also be driven at a low overpotential of 103 mV. In particular, when bifunctional Ni-Mn-FeP as both the cathode and anode is assembled into an electrolytic cell, the electrolysis current of 100 mA cm(-2) can be easily achieved at a low cell voltage of 1.55 V and the stability at 500 mA cm(-2) can last for 360 h, implying great prospects for large-scale applications. The d-band center theory indicated that the intrinsic high electroactivity of bifunctional Ni-Mn-FeP should arise from the doping induced notable promotions in *O to *OOH conversion and H* adsorption processes. The collaboration approach of codoped low-valence and high-valence metals may inspire the development of high-performance and versatile catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000864385400001

Cyclic voltammetry, quasistationary polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to investigate the anode process. The microscopic morphology and phase composition of the anodic oxide layers were observed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, respectively. The observable variations in the electrocatalytic activity and reaction kinetics of the anodes during electrolysis indicate the formation and stabilization of the anodic oxide layer. With prolonged electrolysis, the oxygen evolution overpotential in the anodes mainly exhibited a decreasing trend, which is contrary to the trend of the electrode surface exchange current density. This depolarization may have been caused by the increasing roughness of the anodic surface and the catalytic effects of alpha-PbO2 and beta-PbO2. As electrolysis continued, the cathodic peak (alpha-PbO2 -> PbSO4) mainly showed an increasing trend and gradually moved toward the negative direction. After 15 days of electrolysis, the oxide layers exhibited a severely corrosive microstructure with plenty of cavities and etch pits. The uniform, well-defined crystal grains and regularity were not appeared. The phase composition of the anodic oxide layer was formed after 6 d of electrolysis. alpha-PbO2 proved to be the main peak and showed preferential growth orientations along the (111) planes of the anodic oxide layer.

High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms confirm its mesoporous crystal structure. Well-dispersed ruthenium (Ru) in the mesoporous nanocrystal TiO2 can be attained by the same process using Ru-doped precursor SrTi1-xRuxO3. Ru is doped into lattice of TiO2, which is identified by HRTEM and super energy dispersive spectrometer (super-EDS) elemental mapping. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) suggest the pentavalent Ru but not tetravalent, while partial Ti in TiO2 accept an electron from Ru and become Ti3+, which is observed for the first time. This Ru-doped TiO2 performs high activity for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution.

Here nanodiamond (ND)@graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheet heterostructures were synthesized via a facile one-step pyrolysis approach. The ND@g-C3N4 heterostructures exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution from water splitting as compared with pristine g-C3N4. The optimal heterostructures with 10 wt% ND loading content show the best performance in photocatalytic H-2 evolution under visible light irradiation, which is more than 5.6 times higher than that of the pristine g-C3N4. The increased light-trapping induced by the scattering of the NDs promotes more localized charge carriers generation, which is clarified by the combined experimental results and finite difference time domain simulations. Meanwhile, the effective charge separation at the ND@g-C3N4 interface due to the energy level matching can synergistically induce the enhanced photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4.

The ionomer has an ion exchange capacity of 1.9 mmol g(-1) and ionic conductivity of 0.14 S cm(-2) at 50 degrees C. The cell voltage at 20 degrees C at 100 mA cm(-2) is 1.77 and 1.72 V in, 0.1 and 1.0 M NaOH, respectively, for an optimum loading of 10 mg cm(-2) NiCo2O4. At 10 mg cm(-2) NiCo2O4 electrolyser cell performance is at least equal to or superior to that of IrO2 at 2 mg cm(-2) with excellent stability over 1 h. When the catalyst is sprayed on the GDL instead of CCM, the performance is further improved to 1.65 Vat 100 mA cm(-2) at 60 degrees C & 0.1 M KOH. The limited AEM electrolyser performance when operating with deionised water in comparison to PEM and alkaline electrolyser arises from the sluggish OER in the AEM environment equivalent to pH of 11.5 and the two orders of magnitude lower HER activity with respect to acid medium combined with the high Tafel slope of 120 mV dec(-1) .

Modeling subgrid combustion processes in simulations of thermonuclear supernovae [arXiv]								arXiv								7 pp.	7 pp.						16 Aug. 2019	2019	Supernovae of type Ia are thought to arise from the thermonuclear incineration of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf stellar remnant. However, the detailed explosion scenario and stellar evolutionary origin scenario - or scenarios - which lead to observed supernovae are still quite uncertain. One of the principal tests of proposed scenarios is comparison with the explosion products inferred, for example, from the spectrum of the supernovae. Making this comparison requires computation of the combustion dynamics and products through simulation of proposed scenarios. Here we discuss two specific proposed explosion scenarios, the deflagration-detonation transition and the helium shell double detonation, With these two examples in mind, we proceed to discuss challenges to computational modeling of the combustion taking place in these explosions. Both subsonically and supersonically propagating reaction fronts are discussed, called deflagrations and detonations respectively. Several major stages of the combustion occur on length and time scales that are many orders of magnitude smaller than those accessible in simulations of the explosion.

Recent studies revealed that the response of plants to a combination of different abiotic stresses is unique and cannot be directly extrapolated from simply studying each of the different stresses applied individually. These studies have also identified specific regulatory transcripts, combinations of metabolites and proteins, and physiological responses that are unique to specific stress combinations, highlighting the importance of studying abiotic stress combination in plants. Here we describe the interactions between drought and other abiotic stresses with emphasis on drought and heat stress. We compile new data about the different molecular, physiological and metabolic adaptations of different plants and crops to this stress combination and we highlight the importance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism and stomatal responses for plant acclimation to drought and heat stress combination. We further emphasize the need for developing crops with enhanced tolerance to drought and heat stress combination in order to mitigate the negative impacts of predicted global climatic changes on agricultural production worldwide.									442	31	3	0	339	7	478			0031-9317	1399-3054		WOS:000418236000001	28042678

Herein, amorphous FeOOH nanoparticles decorated on defect-rich porous Ni MOF nanosheet based hierarchical architectures were constructed via a simple electrodeposition route and their corresponding potential for the OER was explored. In detail, the defect-rich porous Ni MOF nanosheets were firstly synthesized by a hydrothermal route, followed by alkali etching treatment. After subsequent electrodeposition, amorphous FeOOH nanoparticles were uniformly loaded on the surface of the MOF nanosheets. The as-prepared hierarchical nanocomposite exhibited improved conductivity, a larger electrochemical surface area and promoted oxidation processes for the transformation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ and Ni3+ to Ni>3+ in the presence of FeOOH. As a result, the hierarchical nanocomposite required only 267 mV for the OER to reach a catalytic current density of 20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. It also showed a small Tafel slope of 79 mV dec(-1) and remarkable stability. What is more, the hierarchical nanocomposite possessed higher OER performance, lower Tafel slopes and smaller charge transfer resistance than each individual component as an electrocatalyst, showing a synergistic effect of the defect-rich porous Ni MOF and amorphous FeOOH nanoparticles. In brief, this work provided a feasible strategy for further exploring the application potential of MOF-based hierarchical composites for an efficient electrocatalytic OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000790407600001		
J	Liu, Qiang; Zhou, Fang; Bai, Yuying; Hu, Weikang								Evaluating Properties of Carbon-Free Nano-NiCoFe-LDHs with Molybdate as Oxygen Evolution Catalysts and Their Applications in Rechargeable Air Electrodes								ENERGY & FUELS				35	24			20374	20385		10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c03475				DEC 16 2021	2021	The issues of carbon corrosion, oxidation, and catalytic stability for most electrocatalysts of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remain great challenges under high oxidizing environments. Herein, we report carbon-free nano-NiCoFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with MoO42- anions to alleviate these issues. An excellently active catalyst of nanocarbon-free NiCo1.5Fe0.5-LDH with 14.9 at. % MoO42- was synthesized by a chemical coprecipitation method that shows superior OER performance having an overpotential of 239 mV@10 mA cm(Geo)(-2), a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec(-1), and excellent long-term stability (200 h no degradation) at 100 mA cm(Geo)(-2). The outstanding performance is ascribed to the excellent stability of carbon-free powder catalysts with no carbon corrosion under high oxidizing environments, while the high catalytic activity is attributed to the enhanced synergistic effects between multiple metals of Ni-III, Co-III, and Fe-III, the size reduction and formation of high specific surface areas, and poor crystallinity after molybdate introduction. In this work, a durably rechargeable air electrode for metal-air batteries was fabricated using the electrocatalyst, which exhibits low charging voltage (1.882 V@20 mA cm(-2) vs Zn), excellent cycling stability, and a low voltage gap (0.67 V) at 20 mA cm(-2) in the atmosphere environment (air as the reactive gas). The paper discussed two strategies to promote OER activities and presents a feasible approach to tackle the tricky issues of carbon corrosion and oxidation for rechargeable air electrodes in alkaline medium under high oxidizing environments.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000760881300045

In this study, a novel three-dimensional (3D) electrode, consisting of hybridized Ni(PO3)(2)-MnPO4 nanosheet array on self-supported conductive nickel foam (Ni(PO3)(2)-MnPO4/NF), is established to demonstrate the promising applications of an class of transition metal phosphates (TMPOs) for electrochemical water splitting and supercapacitors. By means of the Ni(PO3)(2)-MnPO4/NF electrode with rationally designed nanosheet array structure and abundant defects, we demonstrate the good catalytic activity of TMPOs for hydrogen evolution reaction (125 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). It is also revealed as a robust oxygen-evolving catalyst, yielding a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at ultralow overpotential of 116 mV (corresponding to the electrode potential of 1.346 V). When tested as bifunctional electrocatalysts to drive overall water splitting, the applied potential difference is as low as 1.41 V for the whole cell to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, Ni(PO3)(2)-MnPO4/NF could serve as excellent supercapacitor electrode with superior capacitance behavior (areal specific capacitance of 14.48 F cm(-2) at 5 mA cm(-2)) and good stability. In an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor, a high energy density of 45.6 Wh kg(-1) is obtained at a power density of 1.1 kW kg(-1). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we systematically identified and analyzed the membership, characterization, and evolutionary relationship of PLDs in five species of cotton. The results of the transcriptomic analysis suggested that the evaluated PLD genes showed high expression levels in anther tissue and during the fiber initiation and elongation periods. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed differential expression of GhPLD genes in the anthers of photoperiod sensitive male sterility mutant 5 (psm5). Previous research on multiple stable quantitative trait loci also suggests the role of PLD genes in the fiber development. Further analyses showed that GhPLD2 protein is localized to the plasma membrane. The virus-induced gene silencing of GhPLD2 in cotton seedlings repressed its expression by 40-70%, which led to a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, 22% anther indehiscence, and disrupted fiber initiation and elongation. Thus, we inferred that GhPLD2 may promote ROS production, which, in turn, may regulate anther dehiscence and fiber development.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1664-462X			WOS:000707771900001	34659294

Higher steel cleanliness, lower corrosion, and small inclusions were obtained using the optimal slag composition (pctCaO/pctSiO(2) = 3.7 to 4, pctCaO/pctAl(2)O(3) = 6 to 8). Layered composite inclusions formed during vacuum decarburizing refining. CaS first precipitated around the spinel and subsequently formed inclusions in which solid CaS-CaO wrapped around the Al2O3-MgO-SiO2-CaO system as the modification and diffusion progressed. The thermodynamic equilibrium between slag and liquid 95CrMo steel at 1873 K (1600 A degrees C) was also studied to understand the effect of slag composition on the oxygen content and absorption capacity for Al2O3. A mathematical model based on an investigation of slag viscosity and the interfacial tension between slag and inclusions was used to predict the size of critical inclusions for different slags. The evolution of typical inclusions is discussed in terms of the study of reactions between slag and steel.									15	2	0	0	0	0	16			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000368692300015		
J	Wang, Ying; Shen, Chanchan; Li, Lifang; Li, Haiyan; Zhang, Manman								Electrocatalytic degradation of ibuprofen in aqueous solution by a cobalt-doped modified lead dioxide electrode: influencing factors and energy demand								RSC ADVANCES				6	36			30598	30610		10.1039/c5ra27382j				2016	2016	A Co-doped modified PbO2 electrode was prepared to electrocatalytically oxidize IBU in aqueous solution. The effects of initial IBU concentration (40-320 mg L-1), initial pH (4-10), current density (3-30 mA cm(-2)), natural organic matter and small molecular organic acid were investigated. The structure, morphology and electrochemical properties of the electrode were studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, linear sweep voltammetry and cyclic voltammograms. The doping of Co may decrease the particle size and increase the lifetime of PbO2, which favors the electrocatalytic activity. The results indicated that the Co-PbO2 electrode exhibited a highly effective oxidation capacity for IBU. After 60 min of electrolysis, the removal of IBU and COD at a current density of 3 mA cm(-2) for 80 mg L-1 of IBU reached 98.7% and 32.1%, respectively, and the degradation of COD was 53.6% after 180 min of reaction. The reaction apparently followed a first-order kinetics model. When the IBU initial concentration was 80 mg L-1, the highest reaction rate and energy efficiency were observed. Considering the energy demand and space efficiency, the applied current density of 3 mA cm(-2) was the most suitable. Lower pH favored degradation because the oxygen evolution reaction was restrained. The addition of low concentrations (10 mg L-1) of humic acid and fulvic acid could promote the degradation of IBU, whereas high concentrations (20-40 mg L-1) inhibited the degradation of IBU. Moreover, the addition of oxalic acid and citric acid (0.1-0.5 mmol L-1) could inhibit IBU degradation. Finally, the possible reaction pathways were proposed.									18	0	0	0	6	0	18				2046-2069		WOS:000373061600081

Herein, this paper selected different rank coals before and after acid treatments to analyze the relationship among nanopore structure, chemical functional groups and the heat of gas adsorption through low-temperature N-2 adsorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and calorimetric tests. This enabled us to explore the effect of acid solvents on nanopore structure and functional groups, and finally reveal a coupling mechanism between physicochemical structure and gas adsorption. Results showed that the specific surface area of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller model (BET-SSA) and pore volume of Barret-JoynerHalenda model (BJH-PV) decrease first and subsequently increase with increasing coal evolution before and after acid treatments. However, both pore structure parameters and fractal dimension show a decrease or an increase at different degrees under pore expansion and increase effects. On the other hand, after acid treatments, aliphatic structures evidently decrease and aromatic structures relatively increase. For oxygen-containing functional groups affected by ester hydrolysis and Fourier reaction, more carboxyl and hydroxyl groups appear but ether groups reduce. This suggests that acid treatment is actually accompanied by more physicochemical changes. Then, according to its physicochemical response, less aliphatic structures and more aromatic structures significantly contribute to appear more micropores. However, a non-significant effect of aliphatic structure on gas adsorption is observed, while micropores, aromatic structure and oxygen-containing groups give a positive effect on gas adsorption.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0920-4105	1873-4715		WOS:000760849600003

Recently, MoS2 shows vast perspectives due to its excellent catalytic performance and chemical stability in acid condition. Herein, to expand its application in different environment, a unique ternary composite MCNTs@CoSx@MoS2 comprising three-dimensional lamellar heterostructure supported by multiwalled carbon nanotubes was successfully prepared by a two-step solvothermal strategy and used in electrocatalytic field. As a bifunctional electrocatalyst, heterostructure MCNTs@CoSx@MoS2 could catalyst HER with a small overpotential of 196 mV and low Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1) in acid condition and exhibit outstanding OER performance with a low overpotential of 285 mV and small Tafel slope of 76 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solution. Meanwhile, it displayed excellent durability both in an acid and alkaline solution. The remarkable electrochemical performance of MCNTs@CoSx@MoS2 can be attributed to novel construction advantages and synergy of MCNTs, small CoSx nanoparticles and lamellar MoS2. This work can be extended to the design and preparation of a series of composite materials with the advantage of structural diversity.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000653229500253

Properties of the CuxCo3-xO4, such as morphology, particle sizes, crystallite structure and cation distribution, were characterized with SEM, TEM, XRD and EDX. The CuxCo3-xO4 particles, with various x values, were found to be cubic spinel nanoparticles, with average size of 20-30 nm. Incorporation of Cu in the spinel lattice of Co3O4 shifted the Co3+/Co4+ redox peak as well as the onset point for OER to more negative potentials, which may be related to inversion of Cu2+ into the octahedral sites. Amongst all samples studied, Cu0.7Co2.3O4 was the most active for OER. The CuxCo3-xO4 electrodes exhibited satisfying stability during repetitive cyclic voltammetry. A membrane electrode assembly, using 3 mg cm 2Cu0.7Co2.3O4 on the anode, demonstrated, in an alkaline membrane water electrolyser, a high current density performance of 1 A cm-2 at a voltage of 1.8 V in 1 mol dm 3KOH at 25 degC.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0959-9428			INSPEC:12717061

We demonstrate here the proof-of-principle visual characterization of the reactivity at an enzymatic electrode thanks to fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy (FCLSM) implemented in situ during the electrochemical experiment. The enzymatic O-2 reduction involves proton-coupled electron transfers. Therefore, fluorescence variation of a pH-dependent fluorescent dye in the electrode vicinity enables reaction visualization. Simultaneous collection of electrochemical and fluorescence signals gives valuable space- and time-resolved information. Once the technical challenges of such a coupling are overcome, in situ FCLSM affords a unique way to explore reactivity at the electrode surface and in the electrolyte volume. Unexpected features are observed, especially the pH evolution of the enzyme environment, which is also indicated by a characteristic concentration profile within the diffusion layer. This coupled approach also gives access to a cartography of the electrode surface response (i.e., heterogeneity), which cannot be obtained solely by an electrochemical means.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000537144800059	32298094

Recently, metal single atoms (SAs) have attracted tremendous attention owing to their merits of full atom utilization, unique electronic structures, tunable surface characteristics, and low costs. However, metal SAs usually have relatively low physical/chemical stabilities due to their high surface energy, which results in severe degradation of electrochemical performances. Novel synthetic strategies are developed for metal SAs with better stability and performance. In this review, these strategies will be introduced in the context of electrocatalysis and batteries. Specifically, the design concepts, synthesis approach properties, and applications of metal SAs will be discussed. Finally, the critical challenges and future perspectives of metal SAs are presented. This review aims to provide new insights for future work as well as the real-world applications of metal SAs.									29	2	0	0	2	0	29			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000561931300001

The resulting composites (CFGO-S4, CFGO-C4, CFGO-C6, and CFGO-C8) were fixed onto glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs) to investigate their electrochemical behavior. The modified GCEs were used in a three-electrode system for recognizing tryptophan (Trp), ascorbic acid (AA), and dopamine (DA). The oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were also carried out using the modified electrodes in order to explore their electrocatalytic properties. The results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and static contact angle measurements confirmed that the CFGO composites were effectively adsorbed onto the surfaces of the GCEs. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements showed that the CFGO composite/GCEs exhibited superior supramolecular recognition and consequently showed good electrochemical responses toward the target molecules. CFGO-S4/GCE could recognize dopamine perfectly, with a high current density of 8.82 mA mM(-1) L cm(-2) and a low detection limit of 0.25 mu M.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2046-2069			WOS:000385367300099

We prepared periodic molybdenum (Mo) metal catalytic electrodes by employing self-assembled polystyrene (PS) spheres prepared with a sauna-like method as templates, followed by a reactive ion etching (RIE) process with oxygen gas and a double-layer deposition by low-temperature magnetron sputtering. By controlling the etching time of oxygen gas on PS spheres during the RIE process, the lateral and vertical feature sizes of Mo catalytic electrodes can be efficiently controlled, thereby having various surface area ratios. According to surface morphologies from atomic force microscopy, electrochemical linear sweep voltammetry, Tafel, and impendency measurements, we have found that the surface roughness and surface area ratios of Mo metal catalytic electrodes can be enhanced by prolonging the etching times of PS spheres, thereby reducing the charge transfer resistances and Tafel slopes, and then improving the hydrogen evolution reactions at the catalysts/electrolyte interfaces. We attribute this improvement to the fact that the Mo metal catalytic electrodes can efficiently form beneficial Schottky junctions with the electrolyte to enhance the carrier transportation, and the increased surface area ratios can improve the effective area of the Schottky junctions, thereby enhancing the carrier transportation at the catalysts/electrolyte interfaces. Tafel slope of the periodic Mo metal catalytic electrodes in our work is as low as about 53.9 mV/dec, equivalent to highly catalytic materials MoS2 (55 mV/dec) and MoSe2 (105-120 mV/dec). The proposed periodic Mo catalytic electrodes, which combine a simple sauna-like self-assembly process with a double-layer Mo architecture is scalable and simple; and the surface area of periodic Mo metal catalytic electrodes can also be flexibly controlled, so that the low-temperature magnetron sputtered Mo metal catalytic electrodes are cost-effective and highly compatible with various photovoltaic devices, highlighting the great potential to form high efficient monolithic solar-water-splitting devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-3290			WOS:000371401000044

The surface morphologies and composition of this electrode were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The electrochemical performances of FR-CNTs-PbO_2/SnO_2-Sb/Ti electrode were investigated using the contact angle meter and anode polarization curve. The results showed that the FR-CNTs-PbO_2/SnO_2-Sb/Ti anode exhibits higher hydrophobicity and oxygen evolution potential than FR-PbO_2/SnO_2-Sb/Ti and PbO_2/SnO_2-Sb/Ti electrodes,which would be beneficial to the enhancement of electro-catalytic performance and current efficiency. Under the current density of 30 mA·cm~(-2),the removal efficiency of 10 mumol·L~(-1)RhB can be 90.21% in 15 min using the FR-CNTs-PbO_2/SnO_2-Sb/Ti electrode. However,the removal efficiency of RhB on FR-PbO_2/SnO_2-Sb/Ti electrode was 69.08% under the same conditions. Moreover,the reaction rate constant of FR-CNTs-PbO_2/SnO_2-Sb/Ti_electrode can be 0.2215 min~(-1),which is nearly twice as high as that of FR-PbO_2/SnO_2-Sb/Ti electrode (k = 0.1191 min~(-1)). Thus,the electrochemical properties and the electro-catalytic effect of FR-CNTs-PbO_2/SnO_2-Sb/Ti electrode were significantly improved due to the enhancement of hydrophobicity and oxygen evolution potential.			利用碳纳米管(CNTs)的优异性能和氟树脂(FR)的憎水性能,采用电化学共沉积法制备掺杂型FR-CNTs-PbO_2/SnO_2-Sb/Ti复合电极.运用扫描电子显微镜(SEM)和X射线衍射(XRD)仪对该电极的形貌和组成进行表征,采用接触角仪和阳极极化曲线对电极的电化学性能进行考察.结果表明,该电极比FR-PbO_2/SnO_2-Sb/Ti和PbO_2/SnO_2-Sb/Ti电极具有更强的憎水性能和更高的O2析出电位,这将有利于提高电极的电催化性能和电流利用效率.将FR-CNTs-PbO_2/SnO_2-Sb/Ti电极应用于罗丹明B(RhB)的降解研究,30 mA.cm~(-2)电流密度下,处理10mumol.L~(-1)RhB 15 min,RhB去除率高达90.21%.相同条件下,FR-PbO_2/SnO_2-Sb/Ti电极对RhB的去除率仅为69.08%.且FR-CNTs-PbO_2/SnO_2-Sb/Ti电极的反应速率常数为0.2215 min~(-1),是FR-PbO_2/SnO_2-Sb/Ti电极(k=0.1191 min~(-1))的近2倍.由此可见,较强的憎水性和较高的析氧电位,增强了FR-CNTs-PbO_2/SnO_2-Sb/Ti电极的电化学性质和电催化效果.						0	3	0	0	1	0	3			0254-6108			CSCD:4797910

These represent a lack of (as-deposited) and full oxygen content (annealed). Single-layer Ti was additionally used as a control. The influence of oxygen diffusion phenomena of the bottom layer of TiO2 to the upper layer of Ti thin films at different oxidation temperatures on structural, optical, and photocatalytic performance was investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results confirmed that the crystalline phases coexisting on thin-film samples oxidized at 450 degrees C were TiO, TiO1.4, (bilayer, as-deposited TiO2), anatase (bilayer, annealed TiO2), and rutile (single and bilayer). This finding showed that the film's phase structure evolution is significantly affected by oxygen diffusion from the bottom layer. Further increasing the thermal oxidation temperature caused a notable decline in the amorphous zone in bilayer thin films based on TEM analysis. Bilayer thin films lead to higher degradation of methylene blue under UV light radiation (63%) than single-layer films (45%) oxidized at 450 degrees C. High photocatalytic activity performance was found in the bilayer annealed TiO2-Ti thin-film sample. This study demonstrates that the bilayer modification strategy promotes the oxygen-induced bottom layer of TiO2 bilayer thin films.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5				2079-6412		WOS:000676768000001

Experiments were carried out at pressures of 2 and 5 atm, temperatures of 1670-2200 K, for pyrolysis and for equivalence ratios of 20, 10 and 5 highly diluted in argon. Soot induction delay time and soot yield were studied by measuring the soot-induced laser extinction signal at 632.8 nm. The effects of temperature, pressure and equivalence ratio on soot induction time and soot yield were investigated. A decrease in soot induction time can be observed as the temperature rises. The addition of oxygen or the increasing of pressure leads to a decrease in soot induction time. Bell-shaped evolution of the soot yield versus the temperature was obtained and a modified Gaussian expression was derived. The decrease of pressure or equivalence ratio reduces soot yield significantly. A noticeable shift of optimal temperature toward lower temperatures was observed as the equivalence ratio decreases. A soot particle model coupled with a gas-phase jet fuel mechanism was used to simulate the soot formation under the experimental conditions. The predicted soot yields are in approximate agreement with the experimental data under most conditions. The model underestimates the soot yield at 2 atm for pyrolysis, as well as at 4 atm for equivalence ratio of 5. The major reaction pathways for the formation of soot precursors were obtained and discussed by time integrated element flux analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The values of enthalpy of activation (Delta H-#) and pre-exponential factor (A(f)) estimated using the Eyring equation are in the range of 0.25-0.53 eV (24-51 kJ mol(-1)) and -1.3 to 5, respectively. The Eyring plots tend to diverge with overpotential, causing an increase in the values of the estimated Delta H-# and A(f). This is perhaps due to the retarding effect of the precipitates/adsorbates on the electrode surface. The investigation of the kinetics suggests that the V5+/V4+ redox reaction is electrocatalysed through an increase in the entropy of activation (Delta S-#).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000814232100001	35730802

It is found that both the electronic structure modulated by nitrogen doping and the enriched electrochemically active functional groups on NOMC favor the three electrochemical transitions between the adjacent couples, viz. V2+<-> 3+<-> 4+<-> 5+, as compared with Vulcan XC72 carbon black. Salient findings are as follows. First, the transition of V3+<-> 2+ is the same on the two distinctly different carbons, which indicates that this reaction is an outer-sphere charge transfer reaction. The concomitant hydrogen evolution reaction makes NOMC unsuitable to be used as a negative electrode material in flow batteries. Second, the transition of V5+<-> 4+ shows a quasi-reversible behavior, indicating that NOMC can be used as a positive electrode material. Simulation of cyclic voltammogram (CV) reveals that the standard rate constant and the adsorption equilibrium constant are (7.0 +/- 0.9)* 10(-3) cm s(-1) and 0.70 +/- 0.09 (both V4+ and V5+), respectively. Third, the transition of V4+<-> 3+ is recognized in the CV curve, which proceeds in a quasi-reversible reaction. The preceding adsorption of the symmetrical ions (V3+) is found to play a key role in determining the kinetics. Finally, for the two latter transitions, the content of dopant nitrogen yields a negligible effect on the electrochemical activity, excluding the possibility of its direct involvement in electrocatalysis. The above findings not only reveal the applicability of the nitrogen-doped carbon to be used as an electrode material in flow batteries, but also offer an in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism of vanadium redox couples.

In this work, a 3-D Monte Carlo model is developed to study these photochemical escape processes on early Mars. Although the DR reaction rates of O-2(+), CO2+, and CO+ increase monotonically with solar soft Xray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) flux, the peak of the calculated DR-induced escape rates of O is near 3 x XUV, and the DR-induced escape rates of C increase with XUV until 10 x XUV. The non-monotonic behavior can be explained by the increased column densities of background species in high XUV conditions, which can deflect energetic particles through collisions more efficiently. At 20 x XUV, CO+ DR is the main source of escaping O and C, and the escape of secondary particles could contribute to 30 similar to 40% and 10% of the total escape of O and C respectively. The time-integrated DR-induced escape of 0 and C is equivalent to 1 m of H2O and 20 mbar of CO2 escaping early Mars since 4.5 billion years ago. The accumulated CO2 loss is much lower than what's needed to explain the carbon isotopic ratios on Mars and much lower than the total CO2 needed to warm up early Mars. If more vigorous escape mechanisms were absent on early Mars, substantial inventories of volatiles have not been detected yet. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Evidence against bicarbonate bound in the O-2-evolving complex of photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				47	10			3073	3075		10.1021/bi8000424				MAR 11 2008	2008	The oxidation of water to molecular oxygen by photosystem 11 (PSII) is inhibited in bicarbonate-depleted media. One contribution to the inhibition is the binding of bicarbonate to the non-heme iron, which is required for efficient electron transfer on the electron-acceptor side of PSII There are also proposals that bicarbonate is required for formation Of 02 by the manganese-containing O-2-evolving complex (OEC). Previous work indicates that a bicarbonate ion does not bind reversibly close to the OEC, but it remains possible that bicarbonate is bound sufficiently tightly to the OEC that it cannot readily exchange with bicarbonate in solution. In this study, we have used NH2OH to destroy the OEC, which would release any tightly bound bicarbonate ions from the active site, and mass spectrometry to detect any released bicarbonate as CO2. The amount Of CO2 per PSII released by the NH2OH treatment is observed to be comparable to the background level, although N2O, a product of the reaction of NH2OH with the OEC, is detected in good yield. These results strongly argue against tightly bound bicarbonate ions in the OEC.									36	1	0	0	24	0	37			0006-2960			WOS:000253726900001	18275153

RuO2 and TiO2 sols were synthesized by forced hydrolysis of the corresponding chlorides in acid medium. The morphology of the prepared sols was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. The chemical composition of the RuO2 sol was determined by X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. The loss of electrocatalytic activity of a RuO2-TiO2/Ti anode during an accelerated stability test was investigated by examination of the changes in the electrochemical characteristics in the potential region of the chlorine and oxygen evolution reaction, as well as on the open circuit potential. These electrochemical characteristics were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and polarization measurements. The changes in electrochemical characteristics of the anode prepared by the sol-gel procedure were compared to the changes registered for an anode prepared by the traditional thermal decomposition of metal chlorides. The comparison indicated that the main cause for the activity loss of the sol-gel prepared anode was the electrochemical dissolution of RuO2, while in the case of thermally prepared anode the loss was mainly caused by the formation of an insulating TiO2 layer in the coating/Ti substrate interphase. The results of an accelerated stability test on RuO2-TiO2/Ti and RuO2-TiO2-IrO2/Ti anodes showed that the ternary coating is considerably more stable than the binary one, which is the consequence of the greater stability of IrO2 in comparison to RuO2.									21	1	0	0	0	1	22			0352-5139			WOS:000261070600007

In short, photoelectrochemistry can be divided into three sub-processes, namely (i) the creation of electron-hole pairs by light absorption; (ii) separation/transport on the charge carriers and finally (iii) the water splitting reaction. The challenge is to understand all three processes on a microscopic scale and, perhaps even more importantly, how to combine the processes in an optimal way. This review will highlight some first-principles insights to the above sub-processes, in particular as they occur using metal oxides. Based on these insights, challenges and future directions of first-principles methods in the field of photoelectrochemistry will be discussed.									19	1	0	0	3	0	19				2304-6740		WOS:000404617200020

Here we describe how a molecular iridium catalyst for water oxidation directly and robustly binds to oxide surfaces without the need for any external stimulus or additional linking groups. On conductive electrode surfaces, this heterogenized molecular catalyst oxidizes water with low overpotential, high turnover frequency and minimal degradation. Spectroscopic and electrochemical studies show that it does not decompose into iridium oxide, thus preserving its molecular identity, and that it is capable of sustaining high activity towards water oxidation with stability comparable to state-of-the-art bulk metal oxide catalysts.									221	3	0	0	24	1	222			2041-1723			WOS:000352697100010	25757425

Based on studies of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of different stages, the authors hold that the ore -forming fluid was derived mainly from the magmatic system and subordinately from the carbonate strata with minor organic matter. The atmospheric water probably made very little contribution to the ore -forming process. From early to late stage, the ore -forming process probably experienced immiscibility between melt and volatile-rich hydrothermal fluid, water-rock reaction, and phase separation of CO_2 rich gas from ore fluid caused by sudden decompression.			南泥湖一三道庄钼(钨)矿的成矿阶段从早到晚可以划分为⑴矽卡岩化阶段和角岩化阶段,(2)石英钾长石阶段和退化蚀变作用阶段,(3)石英硫化物阶段以及⑷石英碳酸盐阶段。通过对各阶段流体包裹体的碳、氢和氧稳定同位素研究,认为形成该矿床的成矿流体来源以岩浆源为主,含少量有机质的碳酸盐地层的贡献次之,大气降水可能没有贡献。从矽卡岩阶段到石英硫化物阶段再到石英方解石阶段,成矿流体依次经历了硅酸盐熔体与富挥发分热液流体的不混溶、水岩反应和富气流体的减压沸腾,其中气体的大规模逸出发生在石英方解石阶段。						9	11	0	0	0	0	18			1000-3657			CSCD:4739051

The anodic reaction consumes up to 60% to 80% of the whole energy input due to oxygen evolution. Corrosion takes place and limits the anode life. Due to the insufficient mechanical stability, the lead alloy anodes tend to creep and produce short circuits. Our investigations show the different corrosion behaviour of lead alloy anodes as a function of anode composition and current density under the conditions of copper electrowinning. There is a possibility of decreasing the corrosion rates by coating lead alloy anodes. At the same time, the electrochemical features of the anodes are clearly improved. Potential measurements and the calculation of the specific energy consumption of the electrowinning process show the possibility of cost reduction. The influence of manganese ions in solution on the anode potential of different lead alloy anodes is also investigated.

Chemical analysis established the formula of the compound prepared.

From the initial rates of the first-order reaction at different temperatures, the activation enthalpy and entropy were 16 kJ mol-1 and -210 J K-1 mol-1, respectively. The rates of gas evolution were similar to those obtained when a MnO2 sample was used as a catalyst. Neither the superconductor nor its semiconductor phase photocatalysed the decomposition of KMnO4 solution.

Their interest lies in various complementary physical properties. For instance, the existence of mixed valencies (Fe3+, Fe4+) gives peculiar electrical properties which have been correlated to the evolution of stoichiometry at high temperature and to a progressive disproportionation at low temperature. As these ferrites are stable in alkaline media, the electrochemical behaviour of the La1-xSrxFeO3-y phases for the oxygen reaction has been studied; it can be correlated to the ratio of polyvacancies.

Here, a three-dimensional (3D) porous interconnected network structure combined with ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets with homogeneously dispersed CNTs (MoS2/CNTs) was synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal reaction. The 3D interconnected architecture can efficiently promote the diffusion of O-2 and Li ions as well as impregnation of electrolyte and provide more abundant storage space for the accommodation of discharge products, while the incorporation of uniformly dispersed CNTs improves the electronic conductivity and maintains the integrity of the cathode structure. Therefore, the Li-O-2 battery based on MoS2/CNTs achieves improved performance with the low overpotentials (discharge/charge overpotentials of approximately 0.29 and 1.05 V), a high discharge specific capacity of 6904 mA h g(-1) at a rate mA g(-1), and excellent cycling stability (132 cycles). Experimental studies reveal that the improved electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the synergistic advantages of electronic conductive CNTs and excellent catalytic activity of the MoS2 nanosheets. Moreover, the unique 3D interconnected network structure can effectively facilitate fast charge transfer kinetics and a facile mass transport pathway.

Materials deposited as very thin (ca 50 nm) films on F-doped SnO2 (FTO) substrate do not initially exhibit high activity in 0.1 M H2SO4, but are activated during operation through the electrooxidatively-induced enrichment of the catalytic surface with Co and Sn oxides. The latter originate from the FTO support and are identified as an important component of the catalyst through control experiments with a Sn-free substrate and with Sn2+ intentionally added at the electrodeposition stage. A distinctive feature of the Co-Bi-Sn-based electrocatalyst is the slow but persistent improvement in the activity during operation in 0.1 M H2SO4 at both ambient and elevated (60 degrees C) temperatures, which contrasts with the continuously degrading behaviour of state-of-the-art oxygen evolution catalysts at low pH. This is demonstrated by 9-day-long galvanostatic tests at 10 mA cm(-2), during which the Co-Bi-Sn-based thin film catalyst shows no degradation and sustains stable water oxidation at ca 1.9 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. The effects of tin leaching from the support detected herein might have implications to other acidic water oxidation catalysts supported on high-surface area doped SnO2 materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000787598700001

Here, we present a combined experimental and computational study of M+(N2O)(n) [M = Cu, Ag, Au; n = 2-7] complexes. The spectra provide clear evidence for both nitrogen- and oxygen-bound ligands giving rise to a wide range of structural isomers for each complex studied. The evolution of the complex structures observed as well as spectral trends for each metal center are interpreted in terms of a molecular orbital binding picture and resulting calculated ligand binding energies. Given the environmental importance of nitrogen oxides, these results have implications for metal-catalyzed removal of nitrous oxide and, particularly, the prospect of initiating infrared-driven isomer-selective chemistry in Size-selected complexes.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1089-5639			WOS:000413131300014	28925700

In the absence of sulphur-containing anions in solution, the polarization curves are characterized by one distinct arrest corresponding to Zn(OH)(2) and/or ZnO, after which the potential increases linearly with time due to the formation of barrier oxide film before reaching the oxygen evolution reaction. The duration time of the arrest decreases with increasing current density while the rate of oxide film formation increases. On the other hand, the duration time of the arrest increases with the number of anodic cyclization while the rate of oxide film formation decreases. Additions of low concentration of the aggressive anions have no effect on the passive film formed on the metal surface. The potential starts to oscillate within the oxygen evolution region with increases in the concentration of these aggressive anions. Further increases in the concentration of these aggressive anions are associated with impaired Zn passivity that might indicate pitting attack. The aggressiveness of the sulphur species decreases in the order: SO42- > S2O32- > S2-. The effect of raising pH of the solution on the anodic behaviour of Zn electrode in the presence of SO42- anions was also investigated. It was found that the raising the pH of the solution affecting on the rate of oxide film formation and the breakdown potential value. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The protective MPL was made of the IrO2 deposited fine Ti powders. The cycle performance and polarization curves for both fuel cell and water electrolysis modes of URFC operation were investigated.

Herein, a highly efficient and long-term stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst Mn-doped CoP on foam Ni (MnCoP/NF) is synthesized by the one-step electrodeposition method. Owing to the synergetic effect among the Sepaktakraw-like morphology, the doped Mn element and the binder-free synthesis method, MnCoP/NF displays superior electrocatalytic activity and electrochemical stability toward OER. MnCoP/NF only requires an overpotential of 266 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), demonstrating an excellent electrocatalytic activity even better than that of commercial catalysts of IrO2/NF. And the retention rate of potential can still be maintained at 99.57% after the durability test as long as 240 h, indicating the prominent electrochemical stability of MnCoP/NF. Simultaneously, MnCoP/NF could be directly used as both cathode and anode in the two-electrode system for overall water splitting, exhibiting a low potential of 1.97 V for reaching 100 mA.cm(-2). Impressive long-term stability of MnCoP/NF is also observed by limited activity decay after 240-h durability tests at 10 and 100 mA.cm(-2). Thus, this study illustrates a feasible approach to the rational design of highly active and stable electrocatalyst and also provides valuable insights on the improved electrocatalytic performance of water splitting by Mn doping.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000806114700001

Herein, we report homogenous electrochemical water oxidation by a nickel(ii) complex, ([NiL](PF6)(2) (L = bis(2-pyridyl-methylimidazolylidene)methane), based on a macrocyclic N-heterocyclic carbene/pyridine hybrid ligand under neutral and alkaline conditions. The catalyst displayed the stable catalytic current of 0.65 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 0.80 V (similar to 0.55 V at GCE for CV) with a similar to 93% Faradaic efficiency at pH 9.0 for oxygen evolution in long-term bulk electrolysis. The CV, UV-vis, ESI-MS, SEM, and EDX results demonstrated that the catalyst was impressively stable even after long-term controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) (11 h) and homogeneous in nature. The synthesis of this catalyst is straightforward, and its complex is air and moisture stable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the investigation of a Ni-NHC complex for water oxidation under aqueous conditions (acetate/phosphate). According to the literature, the role of the phosphate ion in homogenous nickel-catalysed water oxidation was found to vary from catalyst poisoning to activation. Interestingly, the catalytic activity of our catalyst in phosphate buffer was significantly higher than that with acetate ions at the same pH value; this might indicate the key role of phosphate ions as proton acceptors, which boosted the catalyst activity via enhanced PCET during catalysis.									9	0	0	0	3	0	9			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000490981500008

Despite the remarkable catalytic activity of ceria in the reaction, achieving full selectivity and long-term stability still represent major challenges. Here, the mechanism of the methoxycarbonylation of the industrially relevant 2,4-diaminotoluene (2,4-TDA) with dimethylcarbonate (DMC) along with the evolution of the property-performance interplay upon consecutive cycles are rationalized via the identification of reaction products, characterization tools, and density functional theory (DFT). The formation of the desired carbamates (7% mono- and 83% biscarbamate) is favored over the (111) facet, the most abundant in the as-prepared material, and proceeds via a complex reaction mechanism that involves a broad number of isomers and multiple reaction paths. A consecutive reaction in which 2,4-TDA is converted into a monocarbamate that further reacts to the biscarbamate drives the selective path. Part of these carbamates reacts to form productive ureas, unprecedented intermediates that reversely transform into carbamates. A full product analysis enables us to identify a number of side products that mostly comprises N-methylated carbamates and N-methylated ureas. Evaluation in subsequent cycles evidences the catalyst deactivation and the concomitant increase in the formation of byproducts, which is linked to the increasing amount of carbon deposits along with the DMC-induced partial surface restructuring into an oxygen-defective (100) facet after six cycles. These findings highlight the challenges in the rational design of robust heterogeneous catalysts for the production of isocyanate precursors.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000485090400010

The effect of the Al amount added to the PMS on phase development, densification behaviour and microstructure evolution was studied by simultaneous thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and electron probe microanalysis. The Al/PMS reaction route is complex producing Si, SiO(2) (amorphous and cristobalite), Al(2)O(3) (gamma-, iota- and alpha-Al(2)O(3)), Al(2)OC, Al(4)O(4)C, Al(4)SiC(4), and AlN, depending on the ratio of Al/PMS in the initial mixture. Increasing the Al content (high Al/PMS ratio) reduces the amount of voids and porosities after PMS degradation. The voids and porosities provide access for the oxygen atmosphere into the inner structure to oxidise the Al particles, Si or SiC and also as channels for the PMS degradation products to escape. Mullite formation was identified in sample containing > 73 wt% Al at temperature as low as 1400 A degrees C.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0022-2461			WOS:000272904700030

Herein, we investigate the potential of CO2-to-CH4 conversion on the representative single-atom catalysts (SACs), single transition metal atom with four coordinated nitrogen atoms embedded in graphene (TM-N-4) by first-principle calculations. Interestingly, the CH4 product can be formed more favorably on TM-N-4 through the key intermediate of *HCOOH instead of the traditional *CO. Among all TM-N-4 candidates, Mn-, Fe-, and Ru-N-4 stand out with the low limiting potentials of-0.31,-0.42, and-0.30 V, respectively. The analysis of electronic structures and charge variation shed light on the CO2RR activity origin. Moreover, it is suggested that Mn-N-4 and Ru-N-4 possess high CH4 selectivity owing to the suppressed hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while the dominant HER prohibits the CH4 formation on Fe-N-4. This work will provide more insights into the underlying mechanism of CO2RR and promote the explorations of TM-N-4 for CO2-to-CH4 conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000762844400001

Herein, we design and fabricate a novel g-C3N4/BO0.2N0.8 van der Waals heterostructure to realize oriented charge flow in-plane and separation within the interface. On one hand, a B-C bond forms within the g-C3N4/BO0.2N0.8 interface after the introduction of O atoms. The B-C bond as the mediator bridges g-C3N4 and BO0.2N0.8 sides to enhance the effective separation of photogenerated charges. On the other hand, the existence of O atoms promotes the formation of a B-O-O-B intermediate to realize that molecular oxygen can directionally obtain electrons from the surface to generate circle O-2(-). As a result, BO0.2N0.8 instead of g-C3N4 is considered to be the main reaction side, and the energy barrier of NO3- generation is significantly decreased. The NO removal performance of g-C3N4/BO0.2N0.8 is enhanced and the NO2 generation is effectively controlled compared with that of g-C3N and g-C3N4/BN. This work could provide an effective and facile strategy to tune oriented charge transfer.									12	4	0	0	4	0	13			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000557854700100	32614161

Herein, we prepared Ni metal catalysts ranging in size from single atoms to over 100 nm and distributed them across N-doped carbon substrates which were obtained from converted zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF). The results show variance in CO(2)reduction performance with variance in Ni metal size. Ni single atoms demonstrate a superior Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO selectivity (ca. 97 % at -0.8 V vs. RHE), while results for 4.1 nm Ni nanoparticles are slightly lower (ca. 93 %). Further increase the Ni particle size to 37.2 nm allows the H(2)evolution reaction (HER) to compete with the CO(2)reduction reaction (CO2RR). The FE towards CO production decreases to under 30 % and HER efficiency increase to over 70 %.

The spectral dynamics observed at 267 and 400 nm demonstrate that the quantum yield for geminate recombination of ClO and O to form OClO is reduced in acetonitrile relative to water. However, the dynamics at 800 nm are similar for both solvents consistent with ClOO rather than OClO being responsible for the evolution at this wavelength.

The inevitable selectivity gap against hydrogen evolution reaction and inert nitrogen (N-2) hinders the device-level usage of nitrogen cathodes. In this work, we report engineered electrocatalyst/support interface of NbTiO4 nanoparticles supported on nitrogen doped carbon nanorods (NbTiO4@NCNR) to catalyze NRR. Insisted by the pitfalls to rationally design N-2 reduction catalysts, the strong catalyst-support interaction strategy is adapted to tune the selectivity towards NRR. Electrochemical tests reveal that NbTiO4@NCNR hybrid accelerates a 10-fold increase in N-2 selectivity compared to pure metal oxide. Using first-principles calculations, we identify the underlying mechanism of enhanced performance: bridging bonds in the interface as electron transport channels to promote the N-2 reduction kinetics. Essentially, this study provides an insight into how to overcome the immense kinetic barrier of NRR using smartly engineered interfaces of hybrid materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000788166900004

Treatment of this product with [Fe(CO)(5)] produced a brown oil, which is very soluble in toluene. The orange red compound [{Li(THF)[HNC(NMe2)(2)]}(2){Fe-3(CO)(11)}] (2), which forms an infinite chain, and the colorless dimeric complex [Li(THF) {HNC(NMe2)(2)}{Fe(CO)(4)(C(O)NMe2)}](2) (3) could be isolated from this solution. The oxygen atom of the carbamoyl part in 3 is connected to two Li+ ions with formation of a Li2O2 ring. Crystals of 2 and 3 were obtained by fractional crystallization from toluene/n-pentane and characterized by IR spectroscopy and X-ray analyses.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0044-2313	1521-3749		WOS:000276497000022

The time-resolved evolution of the OH radical concentration has been observed at pressures between 4 and 600 Torr and at varying distances between the photocatalytic surface and the detection volume. OH radicals have been detected even at the highest pressures, opening the assumption that gas-phase reactions with OH radicals may very well be involved in the photocatalytic degradation of VOCs, even at atmospheric pressure. Interestingly, a second fluorescence signal peak has been observed at longer delays with respect to the excitation pulse. The use of different fluorescence laser energies leads us to interpret this second peak as H2O2, released from the surface into the gas phase and detected by a two-photon process; in fact, we use fluorescence laser fluencies high enough to photolyze H2O2 molecules at the fluorescence-excitation wavelength (282 nm) and excite the generated OH radicals within the same laser pulse.									24	1	0	0	3	0	24			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000256920000001

During the design of polymer-flooding projects, an important question is thus the acceptable levels of Fe2+ and O-2 that can be tolerated in injection-water specifications. Furthermore, we would like to be able to predict the extent of degradation in the case of excess Fe2+ or oxygen ingress.However, despite more than 50 years of research and a general understanding of the degradation mechanism involved, quantitative prediction of the extent of degradation has proved elusive and dependent on the measurement protocol. This is likely because of the fastidious experimental protocols required to work under anaerobic or limited-oxygen conditions.We examine existing protocols and demonstrate that experiments in which either Fe2+ or O-2 is the limiting reagent yield equivalent results when the stoichiometry of the Fe2+ autoxidation reaction with oxygen is taken into account. On the basis of these findings, a novel, easy approach is proposed to quantify polymer-oxidative degradation as a function of either O-2 or Fe2+ content.The limits of 225 ppb Fe2+ and 32 ppb of O-2 are fixed for Flopaam 3630S in 6 g/L brine in the concentration range 500-1,500 ppm to ensure that degradation of low-shear plateau viscosity does not exceed 10%. Higher levels will lead to severe polymer degradation. The influence of polymer concentration, temperature, and salinity is also investigated. At last, evolution of redox potential and pH during Fe2+ oxidation is discussed along with the injectivity risk associated with the formation of Fe3+.There is a direct practical application of these findings for the design of surface facilities for polymer dissolution and transport and for the prediction of degradation in case of oxygen ingress. Moreover, a simple and easily performed protocol is proposed for the evaluation of polymer oxidative degradation for any given field conditions.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1086-055X	1930-0220		WOS:000401982200004

The results showed that the maximal carboxylation efficiency (Vcmax) and Hill reaction activity were higher in line 154 than that of line 212. The Pn in flag leaves of line 154 was significantly higher than that of line 212 during the anthesis to grain-filling stage. Higher leaf sucrose phosphate synthase activity, grain sucrose synthase activity, and grain ADPG pyrophosphorylase activity ensured that the photosynthate of line 154 could be transported to grains and translated into starch in a timely and effective manner, which also contributed to the maintenance of its high photosynthetic rate. Eventually, all of these factors of line 154 resulted in its higher grain yield compared with the low photosynthetic rate of line 212.									33	6	0	0	22	0	37			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000362006900016	25823798

Herein, we propose a strategy in which, through the manipulation of crystal and electronic structure, one can convert a common metal to have a Pt-like performance for HER. To achieve this goal, a series of MCo2 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf and Sc) has been synthesized by using a rapid arc-melting method. TiCo2 exhibits comparable HER activity to that of Pt/C, for which it requires only -70 mV (V vs. RHE) to reach 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 33 mV decade(-1) in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) indicate that the lower adsorption energy (DGH*) of H on the Co atom in TiCo2, due to the change in Co electronic state, is another key factor to account for its high HER activity. This case study offers a good illustration of how to transform a non-noble metal so it behaves like a noble metal toward HER and can potentially be applied under other conditions.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000499480200031	31682249

In this work, we investigated the chemical and electrochemical stability of representative Ni-based electrocatalysts. For this, carbon supported monometallic Ni and bimetallic Ni3M (M = Co, Fe, Cu, Mo) nanoparticles were synthesized and tested using a set of complementary techniques. It was found that Mo suffers from intense dissolution due to thermodynamic instability. Cu was stable below 0.4 V-RHE, though it undergoes noticeable electrochemical transient dissolution if the potential range is extended to 0.5 V-RHE and higher. However, Ni, Co, and Fe showed negligible dissolution up to 0.7 V-RHE. Despite the absence of dissolution, all catalysts lose their HOR activity if they are cycled to these high potentials. Physicochemical characterization of the aged catalysts revealed full oxidation of the metal nanoparticles, which could be responsible for the performance deterioration. Although our results demonstrate that, besides Ni3Mo, all studied materials show high stability under operating potentials of AEMFCs, if fuel starvation in AEMFCs results in high anodic potentials, cell activation and operation strategies are needed to prevent the passivation of the catalysts. These results present critical insights toward the design and development of affordable Ni-based electrocatalysts for AEMFCs as well as provide a better understanding of the operation strategies for the stability of AEMFCs.									62	4	0	0	6	0	63			2155-5435			WOS:000480503700023

The rapid evolution of this chemistry has led to an increasing number of applications in the field of catalytic C-heteroatom bond formation, reduction, and oxidation where the heteroatom is nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen, or boron. Thus, in addition to the development of aryl aminations, aryl thiolations, alkyne hydrothiolations, and transfer hydrogenations, which are the most ancient reactions of this type known for these systems, the last five years have seen the appearance of a number of novel interesting Ni(NHC)-catalyzed transformations such as the dehydrogenative cross coupling of aldehydes and amines or alcohols, the hydroamination of alkenes, the hydroimination of alkynes, a one-step indoline synthesis, (cross-) Tishchenko reactions, the borylation of unsaturated C-C bonds and arenes, the borylative cleavage of C-N bonds, the hydrosilylation of C-O and C-N multiple bonds, the reductive cleavage of aromatic C-O bonds, and the anaerobic oxidation of alcohols. This rapid expansion calls for a review of the state of the art at this time with a special emphasis on mechanistic data to allow new insights into catalyst improvement.									163	1	0	0	14	0	163			2155-5435			WOS:000369774900050

The method is based on a quantum-mechanical time-dependent non-adiabatic picture. A universal functional form for the potential energy surfaces is employed. The diabatic potentials describing the sequence of events leading to dissociation begin from the physisorption potential crossing over to a charged molecular chemisorption potential and crossing over again to the dissociated atomic-surface potential. Within such a potential surface topology, two different surfaces leading to dissociation are studied: the empirical potential of Spruit and the ab-initio potential of Nakatsuji. It is found that the system is captured by the molecular chemisorption well for a considerable length of time, long enough for thermalization. Thus the calculation is split into two parts: the calculation of ''direct'' dissociation probability and the calculation of nonadiabatic dissociative tunneling rate from the thermalized chemisorbed molecular state. For the direct probabilities, the Fourier method with the Chebychev polynomial expansion of the evolution operator is used to solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. For the tunneling rate calculation, a similar expansion of Green's operator is used. The output of the direct-reaction calculation is the dissociation probability as a function of the initial energy content, while the tunneling calculation yields the dissociation rate. The dependence of the direct dissociation probability on the initial kinetic energy is found to be non-monotonic. A strong isotope effect has been found, favoring the dissociation of the light species.									37	0	0	0	0	0	37			0039-6028			WOS:A1996UM63400007

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with open Fe sites are promising candidates for catalyzing this reaction. One advantage of MOFs is their modular construction from inorganic nodes and organic linkers, allowing for flexible design and detailed control of properties. In this work, we studied a series of single-metal atom Fe model systems with ligands that are commonly used as MOF linkers and tried to understand how one can design an optimal Fe catalyst. We found linear relationships between the binding enthalpy of oxygen to the Fe sites and common descriptors for catalytic reactions, such as the Fe 3d energy levels in different reaction intermediates. We further analyzed the three highest-barrier steps in the ethane oxidation cycle (including desorption of the product) with the Fe 3d energy levels. Volcano relationships are revealed with peaks toward higher Fe 3d energy and stronger electron-donating group functionalization of linkers. Furthermore, we found that the Fe 3d energy levels positively correlate with the electron-donating strength of functional groups on the linkers. Finally, we validated our hypotheses on larger models of MOF-74 iron sites. Compared with MOF-74, functionalizing the MOF-74 linkers with NH2 groups lowers the enthalpic barrier for the most endothermic step in the reaction cycle. Our findings provide insight for catalyst optimization and point out directions for future experimental efforts.									37	0	0	0	1	0	37			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000412717600016	28394564

Two bituminous coals (coals A and B) and one lignite (coal C) were pyrolyzed in a fixed bed in N-2 from 600 degrees C to 1100 degrees C. The chemical structure of coal char was characterized by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The carbon and oxygen functionalities of coal char were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Raman spectroscopic parameters A(D)/A(G) (A(D1)/A(G), A(D2)/A(G), and A(D3)/A(G)) increased from 600 degrees C to 900 degrees C and then decreased after 900 degrees C, indicating that the degree of order of coal char first decreased and then increased with increasing pyrolysis temperatures (600-1100 degrees C). The content of graphite-like microcrystalline carbon decreased and then increased with an increase in temperature. Prominent diffraction peaks of microcrystalline carbon for coal chars A and B were observed, but only minerals were shown in diffraction patterns of coal char C since the ash content of coal chars A and B is much lower that that of coal char C. The lateral size of the crystallite plane (L-a) generally increased between 600 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. The relative content of C=O and COOH in coal chars A and B generally decreased as the temperature increased, suggesting an increase in the degree of order at higher temperatures. The oxygen functionalities of coal char were composed of organic oxygen and oxygen-containing bonds of minerals.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4352		WOS:000785084200001

Owing to the excellent catalytic effect of Ag and Pt NPs, oxygen bubble generation and evolution frequencies are improved, leading to the ultra-fast movement of micromotor in H2O2 solution with a long lifetime of 6 h and a highest speed of ca. 12 mm/s. Meanwhile, active radical species are produced in the reaction of Ag NPs and H2O2. As a result, the synergy effect of vigorous intermixing and peroxidase mimics activity of Ag NPs speeds up the degradation significantly. In order to improve the decontamination efficiency, key factors that affect the motion performance and the generation of ROS, including H2O2, sodium dodecyl sulfate, buffer solution and the amount of micromotors, are discussed using response surface methodology. Taking methylene blue (MB) as pollutant model, the degradation rate increased from 32.47% to 90.42% after the deposition of Pt NPs on Ag micromotor, indicating the excellent catalytic effect of the bimetallic catalysts modified micromotor. Possible degradation pathway of MB was pro-posed, based on the results of quantum chemistry calculation and LC/MS analysis. Overall, the ultra-high traveling speed and the excellent catalytic effect make it to be a promise candidate for environmental remediation.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000743802900001

Inorganic chemistry				61	42			16760	16769		10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c02603				2022-Oct-24	2022	Molybdenum nitrides and oxynitrides have been increasingly realized as (electro)catalysts for a variety of reactions. In this context, the cubic "gamma-Mo2N", also known to contain oxygen in the bulk, is of particular interest. The gamma phase is typically derived from ammonolysis of MoO3, and a high temperature is needed to fully react the stable MoO2 intermediate that often forms along the reaction pathway. In this study, ammonolysis of atypical bronze (HxMoO3) and peroxo (H2MoO5) precursors was undertaken to avoid the formation of this undesired intermediate with the aim of synthesizing "gamma-Mo2N" at reduced temperatures and thus with a high surface area. It was found, using in situ powder diffraction, that, when the phase I bronze (x 0.3) served as the precursor, MoO2 formed as an intermediate and was retained in the reaction product until 700 °C. In contrast, ammonolysis of the phase III bronze (x 1.7) and of H2MoO5 circumvented the MoO2 intermediate. From these latter two precursors, "gamma-Mo2N" was formed at the lowest maximum reaction temperatures reported in the literature, namely, 480 °C in the case of HxMoO3-III and 380 °C for H2MoO5. The resulting products displayed extremely high surface areas of 206 and 152 m2/g, respectively, presumably as a consequence of the low synthesis temperatures. While the HxMoO3-III precursor showed evidence of a topotactic transformation pathway, with morphological similarity between precursor and product phases, H2MoO5 transformed via amorphization. Electrochemical characterization showed moderate activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which increased after exposure to reducing potentials and loosely scaled with the catalyst-specific surface area. This work points toward new low-temperature synthesis pathways for accessing molybdenum (oxy)nitrides with high surface areas.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1520-510X		MEDLINE:36219544	36219544

Novel catalytic properties were discovered for these subnanometer clusters, suggesting that they may be good candidate materials for CO2 reduction. The calculated overpotentials for producing CH4 are in the order, Co-4 < Fe-4 < Ni-4 < Cu-4 < Pt-4, with both Co-4 and Fe-4 having overpotentials less than 1 V. Investigation of the effects of supports found that a Cu-4 cluster on a graphene defect site has a limiting potential for producing CH4 comparable to that of a Cu (111) surface. However, due to the strong electronic interaction with the Cu-4 cluster, the defective graphene support has the advantage of significantly increasing the limiting potentials for the reactions competing with CH4, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO production.									49	0	0	0	4	0	50			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000345453200022	25158148

In current work, self-supporting Co0.85Se nanosheets network anchored on Co plate (Co0.85Se NSs@Co) is fabricated by employing easily tailorable Co metal plate as the source conductive substrate. The scalable dealloying and hydrothermal selenization strategy was employed to build one layer of three dimensional interlinking Co0.85Se nanosheets network on the surface of Co plate. Benefiting from bulky integrated architecture and rich active sites, the as-made Co0.85Se NSs@Co exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity and long-term catalytic durability toward HER. It only requires lower overpotentials of 121 and 162 mV to drive the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2)for hydrogen evolution in 0.5 M H(2)SO(4)and 1 M KOH solution. Especially, no evident activity decay occurs upon 1,500 cycles or continuous test for 20 h at 10 mA.cm(-2)in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. With the merits of exceptional performances, scalable production, and low cost, the self-supporting Co0.85Se NSs@Co holds prospective application potential as stable and binder-free electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation in a wide range of electrolyte.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000555721200001

Fluorinated TiSO anode promoted electro-generated hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) with higher selectivity and activity, due to increased O-2 evolution potential and more loosely interaction with hydrophobic electrode surface. For electro-oxidation process, fluorine doping had an insignificant impact on outer-sphere reaction and exerted inhibition on inner-sphere reaction, as indicated by cyclic voltammogram performed on Ru(NH3)(6)(3+/2+) Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4-) and Fe3+/2+ redox couple. This facilitated electrochemical conversion of TBBPA and intermediates via more efficient outer-sphere reaction and hydroxylation route. Additionally, generated O-2 micro-bubbles could be stabilized on hydrophobic F-doped TiSO anode, which extended the three-phase boundary available for interfacial enrichment of TBBPA and subsequent mineralization. Under action of these comprehensive factors, 0.5% F-doped TiSO electrochemically reactive membrane could achieve 99.7% mineralization of TBBPA upon energy consumption of 0.52 kWh M-3 at current density of 7.8 +/- 0.24 mA cm(-2) (3.75 V vs SHE) and flow rate of 1628 LHM based on flow-through electrolysis. The modified anode exhibited superior performances compared with un-modified one with more efficient TBBPA removal, less toxic intermediate accumulation and lower energy consumption. The results may have important implications for electrochemical removal and detoxification of hydrophobic micro-pollutants.									8	0	0	0	5	0	8			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000693395700002	34323737

The Pd-xML/Pt(111) surfaces are all more active than Pt(111), and present smaller reaction onset potential and larger faradaic current in the kinetics region. The most active surface, at 400 rpm is Pd-1ML/Pt(111). As hydrogen insertion is not possible in this case, the superior activity of Pd-xML/Pt(111) surfaces cannot be linked to the formation of Pd-hydrides. Instead, the activity improvement of the Pd-xML/Pt(111) surfaces versus Pt(111) may originate from (i) the larger oxophilicity of Pd than Pt facilitates the removal of strongly-adsorbed BHad intermediates in a Langmuir-Hinshelwood pathway, (ii) the redirection of the heterogeneous hydrolysis of BH4 towards the partial dissociation into BH3 species, that are oxidized faster than BHad species and (iii) the slower hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at Pd than at Pt surface, which shifts negatively the BOR onset potential and oxidation current generation. Pd-xML/Pt(111) surfaces are sensitive to surface poisoning and deactivation by either the final products of the BOR (BOx) and/or their intermediates (BHx,ad species), but this deactivation is much less than observed for Pt(111). Finally, the Pd-xML/Pt(111) and Pt(111) surfaces lose their long-range order after being used for the BOR, most likely because of the "irreversible" adsorption of strong adsorbates (e.g. BOx species), even if their restructuration cannot be completely ruled out.

Hydrogen production by dark fermentation								2020 6th International Symposium on New and Renewable Energy (SIENR)								4 pp.	4 pp.		10.1109/SIENR50924.2021.9631925				2021	2021	Dark fermentation, photo-fermentation, hybrid system, direct bio photolysis, and indirect bio photolysis are all types of biological processes used to produce bio hydrogen. Dark fermentation involves bio hydrogen production by anaerobic bacteria from carbohydrate-rich substrates in the absence of light, whereas in photo-fermentation, photosynthetic bacteria use light energy to produce bio hydrogen from various organic acids, food processing and agricultural wastes Dark fermentation and photo-fermentation are complementary technologies and can be used sequentially in a hybrid system. In direct bio photolysis solar energy is used by algae and cyanobacteria to convert water into oxygen and bio hydrogen. On the other hand, indirect bio photolysis involve separation of the bio hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions into separate stages, coupled via carbon dioxide (CO2) fixation/evolution. Dark fermentation present advantages when compared to other biological processes because it is light-independent and different raw materials can be used as a carbon source to the microorganisms, which have both a high rate of bio hydrogen production and growth rate to supply the system. Furthermore, strict and facultative anaerobic microorganisms can be used in the form of pure cultures and mixed cultures. Unlike mixed cultures, pure cultures require a sterile environment to prevent contamination, which is difficult and expensive to achieve in industrial scale. For this reason, mixed cultures have been preferred in scaled-up applications.					2020 6th International Symposium on New and Renewable Energy (SIENR)2020 6th International Symposium on New and Renewable Energy (SIENR)	13-14 Oct. 202113-14 Oct. 2021	IEEEIEEE	Ghadai, AlgeriaGhadai, Algeria	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-6654-0833-2	INSPEC:21385396

XRD and SEM studies confirmed the obtention of the hexagonal brucite structure of ZnO with hexagonal truncated-pyramid morphology. A slight decrease in the cell parameters of ZnO:Cu and ZnO:Ni was observed due to the incorporation in the crystal lattice of Cu2+ and Ni2+. The absorption spectra of ZnO was red shifted in the doped samples. The formation of oxygen vacancies was confirmed through Raman and XPS spectroscopy, and it was found that the metal doping increased the oxygen vacancies in ZnO, being ZnO:Ni the sample that exhibited the higher density of oxygen vacancies. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was evaluated in the H-2 production and the reduction of CO2 under UV light. ZnO:Cu and ZnO:Ni samples showed enhanced activity compared to pure ZnO in both photoreduction reactions. ZnO:Ni exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity (224 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) H-2, 29 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) CH3OH), adjudicated to the major oxygen vacancies observed in this sample, which improved the charge separation and reduced the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs.									16	2	0	0	1	0	18			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000490627900021

The very low wettability of this substrate caused by its low surface energy allows tailoring the CoNi deposit morphology. This is concluded from a comparison of polycrystalline Cu substrates with single-crystalline ones of different orientations. The advantages of the present CoNi alloy foams are low internal stresses and good mechanical stability on the substrate. In a second step, by comparing the catalytic properties of the achieved foam with those of CoNi layers obtained on polycrystalline Cu substrates, it is shown that the morphology of the CoNi layers has a decisive influence on the kinetics of the surface redox reaction. The higher reaction rate makes the open foam suitable as catalyst for oxygen evolution in electrolysers. The reversibility of the redox process provides great potential for the achieved porous layers to be used as positive material in alkaline batteries.									13	2	1	0	0	0	14			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000298552800062	22124412

While attempts have been made to explore the composition space of HEA thin-film libraries and compare experimental and computational studies, no corresponding approaches exist for HEA nanoparticles. So far, catalytic investigations on HEA nanoparticles are limited to small sets of individual catalysts. Here, we report the experimental exploration of the composition space of carbon-supported Pt-Ru-Pd-Rh- Au nanoparticles for the H-2/CO oxidation reaction by constructing a dataset using Bayesian optimization as guidance. Applying a surfactant-free synthesis platform, a dataset of 68 samples was investigated. By constructing machine learning models, the relationship between the concentrations of the constituent elements and the catalytic activity was analyzed and compared to density functional theory calculations. The machine learning models confirm findings from previous studies concerning the role of Ru in the H-2/CO oxidation reaction. This has been achieved starting from a random set of compositions and without any prior assumptions for the reaction mechanism nor any in-depth design of the active site. In addition, by comparing the trends of the computational and experimental studies, it is seen that the "onset potentials " across the compositions can be correlated with the adsorption energy of *OH. The best correlation between the computational and experimental data is obtained when considering 5% of the most strongly *OH adsorbing sites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000875125300001

However, excessive amounts of non-precious metal components can show leaching characteristics in electrocatalytic tests, thus hindering the durability of the catalyst. In this work, we report a simple strategy based on seed-mediated growth to synthesize PtCu/PdCu core-shell tripod nanocrystals (TDNs). The construction of PdCu shells with different thicknesses and the modulation of the low Cu content in the shells are achieved via the galvanic replacement reaction between Pd and Cu as a feasible mitigation strategy. PtCu/PdCu TDNs with different shell thicknesses and Cu fractions in the shell exhibit various catalytic activities in ethylene glycol and glycerol oxidation. The PtCu/Pd42Cu core-shell TDNs with a shell thickness of about 1.3 nm exhibit significantly high catalytic activities towards the ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), due to the unique structure of the branched TDNs and stable PdCu shell. Both the specific and mass activities for the EGOR and GOR on PtCu/Pd42Cu TDNs are an order of magnitude higher than those of commercial Pt/C and Pd/C. Moreover, this synthetic strategy is not restricted to PtCu/PdCu TDNs, and it can be extended to PtCu/MCu (M = Rh, Ru, Au, Ir) heterostructure TDNs. The present work could provide a simple and effective strategy for the design and regulation of multi-component core-shell catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000785856700001

NSR operation is cyclic: during the lean part of the cycle, NOx are trapped on the catalyst; intermittent rich excursions are used to reduce the NOx to N2 and restore the original catalyst surface; and lean operation then resumes. This review will describe the work carried out in characterizing, developing, and understanding this catalyst technology for application in mobile exhaust-gas aftertreatment. The discussion will first encompass the reaction process fundamentals, which include five general steps involved in NOx reduction to N(2) on NSR catalysts; NO oxidation, NO(2) and NO sorption leading to nitrite and nitrate species, reductant evolution, NOx release, and finally NOx reduction to N(2). Major unresolved issues and questions are listed at the end of each of the reaction process fundamental sections. Degradation mechanisms and their effects on NSR catalyst performance are also described in relation to these generalized reactions. Since at this stage it does not appear possible to arrive at a complete and consistent mechanistic model describing the broad, existing experimental phenomenology for these processes, this review is primarily focused on summarizing and evaluating literature data and reconciling the many differences presented.									774	45	0	0	36	0	791			0161-4940			WOS:000228116200004

Aqueous alkaline precipitation is the most common approach but it has the limits of microscopic inhomogeneity because of intrinsically different precipitation rates between metal cations. Herein, we demonstrate a new preparation of uniformly structural substituted cobalt iron oxides via acidic redox-assisted precipitation (ARP) upon the interaction of Co-II and K2FeO4. This low-pH synthesis features the redox process between Co and Fe, presumably through the formation of inner-sphere complexes such as [(H2O)(5)Co-II-O-FeVIO3]. With the nucleation starting from such complexes, one obtains a product with predominantly mixed-metal Co-O-Fe moieties, which improves the electrical conductivity of the product. This work further analyzes how the properties of the product species evolve during the hydrothermal synthesis step in the ARP process. We see that the Co/Fe ratio slowly increases from about 1:1 to a final value of 2:1, but does not reach the expected redox stoichiometry of 3:1. At the same time, the magnetization also increases, reaching a value of 16.9 emu g(-1) for the final superparamagnetic product, which is three times higher than the value of monometallic Co3O4 and Fe2O3. The cobalt iron oxide samples obtained from ARP also possess superior oxygen evolution activity (307 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) mu g(-1)) compared to a mixture of Co3O4 and Fe2O3 (422 mV) or pure cobalt oxide (350 mV), highlighting the structure-induced enhancement of the catalytic activity. The difficult synthesis of evenly blended trinary/quaternary metals in a single-oxide phase may become possible in the future via ARP.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000718271300040	34423968

ROS are also considered important immune regulators. In this study, we identified a homologue of reactive oxygen species modulator 1 (Romo1) in the Japanese lamprey (Lampetra japonica). The L japonica Romo1 (Lj-Romo1) gene shares high sequence homology with the Romo1 genes of jawed vertebrates. Real-time quantitative PCR demonstrated the wide distribution of Lj-Romo1 in lamprey tissues. Furthermore, after the lampreys were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the level of Lj-Romo1 mRNA was markedly up-regulated in the liver, gill, kidney, and intestine tissues. Lj-Romo1 was localised to the mitochondria and has the capacity to increase the ROS level in cells. The results obtained in the present study will help us to understand the roles of Romo1 in ROS production and innate immune responses in jawless vertebrates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Of particular interest are photosynthesis can potentially mimic a variety of vital reactions, many of which hold the key to develop sustainable energy economy. In light of this, many of the technological and procedural advancements that have recently occurred in the field are discussed in this review, namely those linked to: (1) photocatalysts made from metal oxides, nitride, and sulfides; (2) photocatalysis via polymeric carbon nitride (PCN); and (3) general advances and mechanistic insights related to TiO2-based catalysts. The challenges and opportunities that have arisen over the past few years are discussed in detail. Basic concepts and experimental procedures which could be useful for eventually overcoming the problems associated with photo-catalysis are presented herein.									77	6	0	0	5	0	77			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000512035700005

The role of Heisenberg spin exchange and the quantum Zeno effect in the spin-selective reaction between spin-1/2 and spin-1 particles								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				157	6					064306	10.1063/5.0101173				AUG 14 2022	2022	The kinetics of spin-selective reactions involving triplet molecules, such as triplet-triplet annihilation or electron transfer to dioxygen molecules in the ground triplet spin state, are strongly dependent on the dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) of electron spins in spin-1 particles. The effect of this interaction on the intersystem crossing in the reaction encounter complex of the paramagnetic particles was previously considered for some particular cases using oversimplified approaches. In this study, we consider a rigorous kinetic model of the irreversible reaction between the spin-1/2 and spin-1 particles in an encounter complex with the reactive doublet state. This model explicitly includes both isotropic exchange coupling of the reactants and spin dependence of the reaction rate in the form of the Haberkorn reaction term. For the time-independent DDI, an analytical expression for the reaction kinetics was derived. The effect of DDI fluctuations was analyzed using numerical simulations. It was found that increasing both the exchange coupling and the reaction rate constants can significantly slow down the quartet-doublet spin transitions and, as a consequence, the observed spin-selective reaction rate. Additionally, the presence of the irreversible reaction in the doublet states affects a coherent evolution in the non-reactive quartet subsystem.

One way to alleviate the drawback of expensive noble metal catalysts is to disperse the active component on a support. Tungsten oxide and tungsten carbide were investigated here comparing different synthesis routes. Adam's fusion and hydrolysis route with the addition of support during different stages of the synthesis and mechanical mixing of catalyst and support were investigated and compared. Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE) measurements show high currents for mechanically mixed samples and samples obtained via hydrolysis with a WO3 precursor. Single cell tests confirm catalyst activity and stability. Further studies are needed to completely understand catalyst behavior, especially fast activity loss during RDE.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			1615-6846	1615-6854		WOS:000403082100016

Although inexpensive transition-metal oxides are competitive water oxidation catalysts in alkaline media, they cannot compete with noble metals in acidic media, in which hydrogen production is easier and faster. Here, we report a water oxidation catalyst based on earth-abundant metals that performs well in acidic conditions. Specifically, we report the enhanced catalytic activity of insoluble salts of polyoxometalates with caesium or barium counter-cations for oxygen evolution. In particular, the barium salt of a cobalt-phosphotungstate polyanion outperforms the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst even at pH <1, with an overpotential of 189 mV at 1 mA cm(-2). In addition, we find that a carbon-paste conducting support with a hydrocarbon binder can improve the stability of metal-oxide catalysts in acidic media by providing a hydrophobic environment.									253	9	0	0	19	0	257			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000423143500008	29256497

A fully transient nonisothermal model involving both heterogeneous and homogeneous chemical reactions, multicomponent mass transfer, heat transfer with intraparticle resistances, as well as char structure evolution is developed. The model takes into account convection and diffusion inside the particle pores, as well as in the boundary layer. By addressing the Stefan flow originated due to nonequimolar mass transfer and chemical reactions, this work enables a more realistic analysis of the combustion process. The model, characterized by a set of partial differential equations coupled with nonlinear boundary conditions, is solved numerically using the implicit finite volume method (FVM) with a FORTRAN code developed in-house. The use of a FVM for solving such an elaborate char combustion model, based on the VRM, was not reported earlier. Experiments consisting of fluidized-bed combustion of a single char particle were carried out to determine the internal surface area of a partially burned char particle and to enable model validation. Predicted results are found to compare well with the reported experimental results for porous coal char combustion. The effects of various parameters (i.e., bulk temperature and initial particle radius) are examined on the dynamics of combustion of coal char. The phenomena of ignition and extinction are also investigated. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Important information about catalytic interactions is commonly gathered by perturbation or mutation of active site residues that directly contact substrates. However, active sites are engaged in intricate networks of interactions within the overall structure of the macromolecule, and there is a growing body of evidence about the importance of peripheral interactions in the precise structural organization of the active site. Here, we use functional studies, in conjunction with published structural information, to determine the effect of perturbation of a peripheral metal ion binding site on catalysis in a well-characterized catalytic RNA, the Tetrahymena thermophila group I ribozyme. We perturbed the metal ion binding site by site-specifically introducing a phosphorothioate substitution in the ribozyme's backbone, replacing the native ligands (the pro-R-P oxygen atoms at positions 307 and 308) with sulfur atoms. Our data reveal that these perturbations affect several reaction steps, including the chemical step, despite the absence of direct contacts of this metal ion with the atoms involved in the chemical transformation. As structural probing with hydroxyl radicals did not reveal significant change in the three-dimensional structure upon phosphorothioate substitution, the effects are likely transmitted through local, rather subtle conformational rearrangements. Addition of Cd2+, a thiophilic metal ion, rescues some reaction steps but has deleterious effects on other steps. These results suggest that native interactions in the active site may have been aligned by the naturally occurring peripheral residues and interactions to optimize the overall catalytic cycle.									12	0	0	0	9	0	12			1355-8382	1469-9001		WOS:000249920600007	17720880

We report a detailed impedance spectroscopy study of Ni-Mo and Ni-Fe based electrocatalytic materials deposited onto porous and compact substrates with different conductivities. The results were interpreted by a critical comparison with equivalent circuit models. The reaction resistance displays a strong dependence on potential and a lower substrate dependence. The impedance behaviour can also provide information on the dominating reaction mechanism. An optimized Ni-Fe based catalyst showed very promising properties for applications in water electrolysis.					12th International Scientific Conference on Functional Materials and Nanotechnologies (FM and NT)12th International Scientific Conference on Functional Materials and Nanotechnologies (FM and NT)	OCT 02-05, 2018OCT 02-05, 2018	Univ Latvia, Inst Solid State Phys; Univ Tartu; Vilnius Univ; Taylor&Francis IncUniv Latvia, Inst Solid State Phys; Univ Tartu; Vilnius Univ; Taylor&Francis Inc	Riga, LATVIARiga, LATVIA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1757-8981		*****************	WOS:000471150800005

Herein we study the electrocatalytic activity of nanostructured 3D Cu-M (M = Fe, Co, Ni) and single metal Ni and Co foams for hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (HPRR) in alkaline media. The electrode materials are prepared by galvanostatic electrodeposition and their morphology, composition and crystallographic structure are characterised by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis, respectively. The electrochemical characterisation is performed by voltammetry and chronoamperometry measurements, where it is concluded that Cu-Fe and Cu-Ni foams exhibit good catalytic activity for HPRR with a number of electrons transferred during the reaction close to 1.

Fabricating novel photocatalysts with high H-2 evolution rate and good cyclic stability is extremely vital for practical applications. Herein, a novel CdS/Cd2SO4(OH)(2) composite derived from cadmium nitrate doped Cd-MOF is deposited on the surface of butterfly wings with reticular hierarchical structure for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction. The combination of unique hierarchical structure and MOF-derived CdS nanoparticles endows them with strong light absorbability, small band gap, and superior photogenerated charges separation efficiency, leading to excellent photocatalytic efficiency. Furthermore, in-depth measurements reveal the reduction of Cd2SO4(OH)(2) to Cd on the surface of CdS particle during the photocatalytic process. The obtained Cd metal can act as the electron trap to improve the charge separation efficiency and further promote the hydrogen production performance. As a result, the MOF-derived CdS/Cd2SO4(OH)(2) and final CdS/Cd systems with reticular hierarchical structure exhibit significantly enhanced hydrogen production performance compared with CdS/Cd2SO4(OH)(2) powder and MOF-derived CdS nanoparticles under visible light irradiation. It is expected that this synthetic approach can be used to fabricate other composite photocatalyst materials with reticular hierarchical structure for efficient water splitting to hydrogen.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-7350			WOS:000765324400001		
J	Wang, Qinhui; Zhang, Rui; Luo, Zhongyang; Fang, Mengxiang; Cen, Kefa								Effects of Pyrolysis Atmosphere and Temperature on Coal Char Characteristics and Gasification Reactivity								ENERGY TECHNOLOGY				4	4			543	550		10.1002/ente.201500366				APR 2016	2016	Coal chars are usually produced under complex atmospheres in industrial production. However, most of the research about char characteristics and gasification reactivity uses the coal char samples prepared under an inert atmosphere. In this study, the influences of the pyrolysis atmosphere and temperature on coal char characteristics and gasification reactivity were investigated. A Shanxi bituminous coal was pyrolyzed in a bubbling fluidized bed to produce char samples. A mixture of hydrogen (H-2), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4) was used as simulated pyrolysis gas (SPG). The coal was pyrolyzed in the SPG and N-2 atmospheres, respectively. SEM, Raman spectroscopy, and FTIR spectroscopy were used to study the influences of the pyrolysis atmosphere and temperature on the coal char characteristics. The char-H2O and char-CO2 gasification reactivities were measured by using a modified thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) system. The experimental results indicate that the SPG atmosphere has no obvious influence on the coal char morphology, but it has significant influences on the carbon structures and surface chemical groups. The SPG char samples have lower gasification reactivity. The disproportionation reaction of CO, the decomposition reaction of CH4, and the loss of oxygen-containing structures induced by H-2 lead to a higher-ordered degree of char, and the graphite generated from the disproportionation reaction and the decomposition reaction can decrease the specific surface area of the coal char. These two reasons result in the lower gasification reactivity of SPG char.									20	3	0	0	2	0	22			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000374018300012

Our recent experimental study determined the depths to which different types of reactions between the shale matrix and the HFF extended. In the present study, we built continuum-scale reactive transport models to understand the coupling of chemical reactions and the transport of aqueous species in these shale-HFF systems. Calibration of the model with our previous experimental results reveals that it takes hours to months for the shale matrix to completely neutralize the imbibed acids, depending primarily upon the carbonate content of the shale. Both the HFF pH and pore pH affect the location of barite precipitation, resulting in unique barite precipitation profiles extending millimeters into calcite-rich Eagle Ford shale but only tens of micrometers into low-carbonate Marcellus shale. In addition, dissolved oxygen and extracted bitumen are key to reproducing the experimental observation of Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxide formation in the shale matrix as a result of pyrite dissolution in the shales. A comparison between the modeling results of porosity in the present study to experimentally measured permeabilities in our previous study suggests that chemical reactions occurring at a greater depth than the observable reaction zone might have impacted permeability. Our model serves as a benchmark for efficiently modeling water-rock interactions in similar systems where bulk rock samples react with a solution in batch reactors. Important reactive transport processes were ascertained via modeling, which allows for quantitative prediction of shale-HFF interactions in shale matrices given the shale and HFF compositions.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000537407200035

In contrast to Pt-based nanocatalysts with other morphologies, nanowire catalysts, especially 1D ultrafine nanowire (NW) structure, are garnering increased attention because of their advantages of high atomic efficiency, intrinsic isotropy, rich high-index facets, better conductivity, robust structure stability for prohibiting dissolution, ripening, and aggregation. Regardless of these advantages, it is still challenging to realize the precise control of ultrafine Pt-based NWs in terms of their size, crystal phase structure, and composition. Aiming to synthesize advanced ultrafine Pt-based NWs catalysts with higher activity, durability, and selectivity toward catalytic reactions, this review summarizes the recently available approaches for improving the catalytic performance of ultrafine Pt-based NWs with detailed guidance. A summary of recent progress in ultrafine Pt-based NWs catalysts for advanced catalysis and heterogeneous reactions is also provided. Furthermore, integrated experimental and theoretical studies are reviewed to explain the activity, stability, and selectivity enhancement mechanism. In the final section, the challenges and outlook are also discussed to provide guidance for the rational engineering of efficient ultrafine Pt-based NWs catalysts for applications in renewable-energy-related devices.									141	13	0	0	7	0	144			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000527097800001

The reaction occurs at an extremely sharp reaction front (< 10 nm) and involves the complete breakdown of the initial framework structure. This results in the release of tetrahedrally incorporated elements such as Fe3+ and Ti4+ and a significant increase in Si/Al disorder across the reaction interface. The evolving microstructure is controlled by crystallographic relations between the phases. This leads to highly anisotropic, sawtooth-shaped intergrowths of albite and initial K-feldspar, resulting in the least structural misfit between the two framework structures. As a result, the newly formed interfaces appear to be semicoherent, and cracks across the reaction fronts even indicate elastic strain. The reaction produces 2 distinctive albite types (albite-1 and albite-2). Both are polycrystalline, with albite-2 showing significantly larger subgrain sizes. This indicates a secondary coarsening step driven by the reduction in interfacial energy within the polycrystalline replacement product. The reaction also produces a highly porous rim. However, the porosity is not evenly distributed resulting in a porous albite-1 and a non-porous albite-2 that mostly surrounds large, euhedral pores. Despite the substantial volume fraction of porosity in albite-1, no significant 3D interconnectivity could be detected, making the presence of a pervasive porosity unlikely. However, the result of coarsening is the continuous modification of the 3D porosity distribution. This could potentially provide a mechanism for fluid transport through the replacement rim until textural and chemical equilibration is achieved.									51	3	0	0	1	0	51			0010-7999	1432-0967		WOS:000294216500005

The key step in this protocol is the preparation of the catalyst precursor W18O49 with surface oxygen vacancies. The existence of large quantities of oxygen vacancies gives plenty channels for diffusion and keeps the specific morphology of WC in the carbonization process. Efforts to build WC blocks with well-defined geometrical shapes (e.g., rods, wires, spheres and flakes) have further expanded its possibility to be the support for methanol electrooxidation catalyst. The platinum supported on pure phase WC materials served as an effective CO tolerant electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation. Electrochemical experiments indicated that the improved catalytic activity was related to the special morphologies of WC supports. Its sea urchin like feature leads to substantial interfaces between WC and Pt by preparing more anchor points for Pt loading and also the barriers for the subsequent crystal growth, which enhances the synergistic effect between WC and Pt.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1001-604X	1614-7065		WOS:000383365000012

The catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Nickel(0) nanoparticles supported on nanoceria (Ni-0/CeO2) were employed as electrocatalyst on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for H(2)evolution reaction. The modified Ni-0/CeO2-GCE requires a relatively small overpotentials of 150 mV, 175 mV and 203 mV to drive current densities of 10, 20 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. Tafel slope, 80 mV dec(-1), indicates that HER process follows the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism with relatively high turnover frequency (TOF), i.e. 0.41 and 5.84 s(-1)at an overpotential of 100 and 200 mV, respectively. A drastic enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity of Ni-0/CeO2-GCE was observed when platinum wire was used as counter electrode instead of graphite rod, especially after long term potential cycling due to platinum dissolution and deposition on the modified electrode. Ni-0/CeO2-GCE was found to exhibit high electrochemical stability (i.e. a small change both in the Tafel slope and onset potential) after 2000 CV scans in 0.5 M H2SO4, which makes Ni-0/CeO(2)a potential electrocatalyst for H(2)evolution from water.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000545755800001		
J	Imshennik, VS; Kal'yanova, NL; Koldoba, AV; Chechetkin, VM				Koldoba, Alexander/K-9428-2013				Is the detonation burning in a degenerate carbon-oxygen core of a presupernova possible?								ASTRONOMY LETTERS-A JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMY AND SPACE ASTROPHYSICS				25	4			206	214						APR 1999	1999	An attempt is made to solve the problem of the regime of burning in degenerate carbon-oxygen cores (CO cores) of stars, which are assumed to be type-ia presupernovae, in favor of deflagration burning. For this purpose, we demonstrate numerically for Chapman-Jouguet detonation waves the galloping instability that changes into decay. The structure of these waves is described by the Zel'dovich-Neumann model involving the kinetics of nuclear reactions in the burning zone. Along with the numerical hydrodynamic model, which include the kinetics of nuclear reactions, we suggest a qualitative model of galloping instability, which takes nonlinear perturbations into account. It is shown that the decay takes a very short time (less than or equal to 10 ms) and is nearly independent of the initial disposition of detonation waves along the radius of the CO core. The kinetic equations include 12 nuclides, from C-12 to Si-28, with fairly detailed net of nuclear reactions (39 reactions). The initial composition of the CO core is an equimolar mixture of C-12 and O-16 (with equal mass fractions), while the mass of the CO core is close to the Chandrasekhar limit. In addition to with the mixture of Boltzmann nuclide gases, the equation of state takes into account the relativistic electron-positron gas of arbitrary degree of degeneracy and the equilibrium radiation.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1063-7737			WOS:000080026500002

To obtain insights into the effect of structure on photocatalytic activity, two types of reduced TiO2 were prepared from CO (CO-TiO2) and H-2 (H-TiO2). For H-TiO2, Ti-H bonds and oxygen vacancies are formed on the surface of H-TiO2, which results in a more disordered surface lattice. However, for CO-TiO2, more Ti-OH bonds are formed on the surface and more bulk oxygen vacancies are introduced; the disorder layer of CO-TiO2 is relatively thin, owing to most surface vacancies being filled by Ti-OH bonds. Under simulated solar irradiation, the photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of CO-TiO2 reaches 7.17mmolg(-1)h(-1), which is 4.14 and 1.50times those of TiO2 and H-TiO2, respectively. The photocatalytic degradation rate constant of methyl orange on CO-TiO2 is 2.45 and 6.39times those on H-TiO2 and TiO2. The superior photocatalytic activity of CO-TiO2 is attributed to the effective separation and transfer of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, due to the synergistic effects of oxygen vacancies and surface Ti-OH bonds. This study reveals the relationship between the photocatalytic properties and structure, and provides a new method to prepare highly active TiO2 for H-2 production and environmental treatment.									35	1	0	0	4	0	35			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000442491300016	29864238

The species formed on the Ni electrode are found to depend on the sweep number due to changes in the activation state of the electrode surface. The voltammograms are characterized by a pronounced anodic peak due to the formation of NiO and a protective passive film corresponding to the formation of beta-Ni(OH)2 before the evolution of oxygen. An additional anodic peak in the vicinity of oxygen evolution potential appeared in the advanced cycles that is attributed to the transformation of beta-Ni(OH)2 to beta-NiOOH. The cathodic branch shows only one peak corresponding to the reduction of beta-NiOOH to beta-Ni(OH)2. The current density flowing along the anodic oxidation peak varies with the concentration of the electrolyte according to: log ip = a + b log CB4O72- where a and b are constants. An increase in the scan rate increases markedly the current density flowing along the whole range of the CVs. As the concentration of borate anions increases, the anodic peak potential is shifted toward more positive values, whereas the cathodic peak potential is shifted in the negative direction, indicating the irreversibility of formation of the passive film formed on the electrode surface. A correlation is made between the anodic oxidation processes and their corresponding cathodic one. The failure-protecting film in borate solutions is assumed to be caused by the formation of a sandwich oxide having the form: NiO/beta-Ni(OH)2/ beta-NiOOH.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1547-7029			INSPEC:13508007

Two major sources of energetic O considered are the photochemical production, via dissociative recombination of O-2(+) ions, and energizing collisions with fast atoms produced by the precipitating Solar Wind (SW) ions, mostly H+ and He2+, and energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) originating in the charge-exchange collisions between the SW ions and atmospheric gases. Energizing collisions of 0 with atmospheric secondary hot atoms, induced by precipitating SW ions and ENAs, are also included in our consideration. The non-thermal reaction O + H-2(v, j) -> H + OH(v', j') is described using recent quantum mechanical state-to-state cross sections, which allow us to predict non-equilibrium distributions of excited rotational and vibrational states (v', j') of OH and expected emission spectra. A fraction of produced translationally hot OH is sufficiently energetic to overcome Mars' gravitational potential and escape into space, contributing to the hot corona. We estimate its total escape flux from the dayside of Mars for low solar activity conditions at about 1.1 x 10(23) s(-1), or about 0.1% of the total escape rate of atomic O and H. The described non-thermal OH production mechanism is general and expected to contribute to the evolution of atmospheres of the planets, satellites, and exoplanets with similar atmospheric compositions.

Investigated was La dosage-induced compositional and morphological evolution of (Co, Ni)(2) P/LaF3, and it was found that suitable La dosage is beneficial for the epitaxial growth of (Co, Ni)(2)P on LaF3 nanosheets (the thickness direction of LaF3 nanosheet is along the (03 (i) over bar) facet), leading to the formation of porous (Co, Ni)(2)P/LaF3 nanotube walls, giving rise to hollow nanotube arrays. The binder-free (Co, Ni)(2)P-La4/NF electrode with unique morphology not only provides more active sites exposure to electrolyte ions and accessible ion diffusion path but also favors electron and charge transfer. Density functional theory calculation and experimental data reveal the doping of La into metal phosphide can lead to electron transfer from metal centers to P atoms, make the Delta G(H) on the P sites closer to zero with lower H2O adsorption energy (-0.58 eV), thus improving the HER behavior. The present work gives a novel strategy to design hollow nanotubular microstructure as non-noble-metal HER electrocatalyst.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000535304900035	32351107

In addition to the usual hydrothermal procedure, the Co2+ derivative could also be prepared by microwave-assisted synthesis, in much shorter times. The crystal structures were solved by ab initio calculations, from powder diffraction data. Compounds M-II[O2P(CH2CH2COOH)(C6H5)](2) {M = Cd (1) or Ca (2)} crystallize in the monoclinic system and display a layered topology, with the phenyl groups pointing toward the interlayer space in a interdigitated fashion. Compound Co-2[(O2P(CH2CH2COO)(C6H5)(H2O)](2)center dot 2H(2)O (3) presents a 1D structure composed of zig-zag chains, formed by edge-sharing cobalt octahedra, with the phenyl groups pointing outside. Packing of these chains is favored by hydrogen bond interactions via lattice water molecules. In addition, H-bonds along the chains are established with the participation of the water molecules and the hydrophilic groups from the ligand. However, the solid exhibits a low proton conductivity, attributed to the isolation of the hydrophilic regions caused by the arrangement of hydrophobic phenyl groups. Preliminary studies on the electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have been conducted for compound 3 and its pyrolytic derivatives, which were previously thoroughly characterized. By comparison, another Co2+ phosphinate, 4, obtained by microwave-assisted synthesis, but with distinct stoichiometry and a known structure was also tested. For the OER, the best performance was achieved with a derivative of 3, prepared by heating this compound in N-2 at 200 degrees C. This derivative showed overpotential (339 mV, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (51.7 mV dec(-1)) values comparable to those of other Co2+ related materials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000642584600001	33890594

In this comprehensive study, a detailed identification of dolerite and hydrothermally altered un-mineralized sandstone and sandstone-hosted ore in the Yaojia Formation have been performed through the use of scanning electron microscopy observation, electron probe, carbon-oxygen-sulfur isotope, and fluid inclusion analyses. The results show that the hydrothermal fluid derived from the intermediate-basic magma intrusion is a low-temperature reducing alkaline fluid and rich in CO2, Si, Zr, Ti, Fe, Mg, Mn, and Ca, producing different types of altered mineral assemblages in the rocks, including carbonation, pyritization, sphalerite mineralization, clausthalite mineralization, silicification, and biotitization. Specifically, the carbonate minerals in sandstone are mixed products of deep hydrothermal fluid and meteoric water, with carbon and oxygen isotopes ranging from -5.2 parts per thousand to -1.7 parts per thousand and -20.4 parts per thousand to -11.1 parts per thousand, respectively. Carbon source of the carbonate minerals in dolerite is mainly inorganic carbon produced at the late stage of intermediate-basic magma evolution, with carbon and oxygen isotopes from -16.1 parts per thousand to -7.2 parts per thousand and -18.2 parts per thousand to -14.5 parts per thousand, respectively. Various carbonate minerals in the rocks may have been precipitated by the hydrothermal fluid after the magmatic stage, due to the change of its CO2 fugacity, temperature, and cation concentration during the long-term evolution stage. A series of carbonate minerals were generated as calcite, dolomite, ankerite, ferromanganese dolomite, and dawsonite. The precipitation processes and different types of carbonate mineral mixtures identified in this study mainly occur as parallel, gradual transition, interlacing, or inclusion metasomatism in the same vein body, without obvious mineralogical and petrologic characteristics of penetrating relationship. Homogenization temperature of fluid inclusions in calcite is high, in the range of 203-234 degrees C, with a low salinity of 0.71-4.34% NaCl, and the data range is relatively concentrated. Homogenization temperature of fluid inclusions in ankerite is usually low, ranging from 100 degrees C to 232 degrees C, with a high salinity of 4.18-9.98% NaCl. The precipitation processes of carbonate minerals and the results of this study are basically in consistent. Overall, the sandstone-type uranium deposits have a temporal and genetic relationship with hydrothermal activities during Paleogene. (1) Hydrothermal activity was directly involved in uranium mineralization, result in dissolution and reprecipitation of earlier uranium minerals, forming uranium-bearing ankerite and complexes containing uranium, zirconium, silicon, and titanium. (2) Hydrothermal fluid activity provided reducing agent to promote hydrocarbon generation from pyrolysis of carbonaceous fragments and accelerate uranium precipitation rate. (3) Regional water stagnation prolongs reaction time, contributing to huge uranium enrichment. This study provides new petrologic, mineralogical, and geochemical evidence for multi-fluid coupled and superimposed mineralization of sandstone-hosted uranium deposits in the sedimentary basin.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2075-163X		WOS:000746521300001

Here, we report on the strong and intricate interactions between coadsorbed H/D and water on the close-packed (111) surface of gold. Deuterium isotopic labeling shows H/D exchange in H-D2O and D-H2O systems, indicating water dissociation and suggesting a nonrandom scrambling process by revealing the origin of hydrogen evolution (from surface H atoms or from water molecules) during annealing. In this reaction, the protonation of the H-bonding ice network (i.e., the formation of (H2O)(n)H+) is energetically favorable and is responsible for water dissociation. Density functional theory (DFT) modeling suggests that the thermodynamics and structure of the protonated clusters are predominant factors for yielding the traceable H-2 desorption features from the surface interaction with H atoms, providing insights into reaction mechanisms.									30	2	0	0	2	0	30			1948-7185			WOS:000306674100008	26292010

Alterations of any of these functions can cause cell death directly or precipitate death indirectly by compromising the ability of cells to withstand stressful stimuli. Abnormal accumulation of Ca2+ by mitochondria in response to exposure of neurons to excitotoxic levels of excitatory neurotransmitters, for example, glutamate, is a primary mediator of mitochondrial dysfunction and delayed cell death. Excitoxicity, along with inflammatory reactions, mechanical stress, and altered trophic signal transduction, all likely contribute to mitochondrial damage observed during the evolution of traumatic brain injury. The release of apoptogenic proteins from mitochondria into the cytosol serves as a primary mechanism responsible for inducing apoptosis, a form of cell death that contributes significantly to neurologic impairment following neurotrauma, Although several signals for the release of mitochondrial cell death proteins have been identified, the mechanisms by which these signals increase the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane to apoptogenic proteins is controversial, Elucidation of the precise biochemical mechanisms responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction during neurotrauma and the roles that mitochondria play in both necrotic and apoptotic cell death should provide new molecular targets for neuroprotective interventions.									284	9	3	0	237	0	294			0897-7151	1557-9042		WOS:000089894300005	11063052

Through covalent modifications of target proteins and redox reactions with oxygen and superoxide radical and transition metal prosthetic groups, NO plays a critical role in many vital biological processes, including the control of vascular tone, neurotransmission, ventilation, hormone secretion, inflammation, and immunity, Moreover, NO has been shown to influence a host of fundamental cellular functions, such as RNA synthesis, mitochondrial respiration, glycolysis, and iron metabolism. NO is formed from L.-arginine by NO synthases (NOSs), a family of related enzymes encoded by separate unlinked genes, The different NOS isozymes exhibit disparate tissue and intrarenal distributions and are governed by unique regulatory mechanisms. In the kidney, NO participates in several vital processes, including the regulation of glomerular and medullary hemodynamics, the tubuloglomerular feedback response, renin release, and the extracellular fluid volume, While NO serves beneficial roles as a messenger and host defense molecule, excessive NO production can be cytotoxic, the result of NO's reaction with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, leading to peroxynitrite anion formation, protein tyrosine nitration, and hydroxyl radical production, Indeed, NO may contribute to the evolution of several commonly encountered renal diseases, including immune-mediated glomerulonephritis, postischemic renal failure, radiocontrast nephropathy, obstructive nephropathy, and acute and chronic renal allograft rejection, Moreover, impaired NO production has been implicated in the pathogenesis of volume-dependent hypertension, This duality of NO's beneficial and detrimental effects has created extraordinary interest in this molecule and the need for a detailed understanding of NO biosynthesis, (C) 1997 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.									175	4	0	0	139	0	179			0272-6386	1523-6838		WOS:A1997XU87900004	9292559

Copper has hitherto received comparatively little attention, with a single study reporting variation in delta Cu-65 between pre- and post-GOE black shales. This is attributed to postulated isotope fractionation effects in the pre- GOE ocean during widespread iron oxide deposition in IF. Here we focus on the application of Cu isotopes in two classic IF-containing sequences of the Neoarchean-Paleoproterozoic, namely the Hamersley (Australia) and Transvaal (South Africa) Supergroups. We specifically targeted the oxide-rich Joffre and Kuruman IF, the carbonate-rich Griquatown IF, and the Mn-rich Hotazel IF, which collectively record over 100 Ma of sustained IF deposition in the pre- GOE ocean. The aim was to assess the utility of Cu isotopes in IF as a paleoceanographic proxy in view of existing oxygen evolution models. Iron formation Cu concentrations are low compared to average crust and modern oceanic Fe-Mn oxide deposits, with average values between 1 and 5 ppm for all four IF data sets. Copper concentrations show no systematic variability with mineralogy, no statistical correlation with bulk Fe and Mn contents, good correlations with Ti (r(Cu-Ti) = 0.73) for the Joffre data set and with Cr, Ni, and V for the South African data sets, and shale-like Cu/Ti ratios. Isotopic results show statistically invariant average delta Cu-65 values very close to 0 parts per thousand for all but the Joffre IF which has a marginally negative average delta Cu-65 value (-0.24 +/- 0.22 parts per thousand). Combined with other trace transition metal systematics, the Cu isotope data point to a Cu source that was controlled largely by inputs of fine volcanic-derived particles (ash), thus placing limitations on its utility as a paleoceanographic redox proxy during IF genesis.

In the present study a detailed kinetic mechanism is developed and tested against experimental data for six: lean (phi = 0.12) to sooting (phi = 2.50) laminar, premixed, low-pressure acetylene flames. Generally the agreement between computations and experiments is acceptable. It is suggested that OH attack competes with O attack as the major acetylene breakdown path in rich flames. It is further shown that the balancing of the ketyl radical destruction chemistry to a significant extent determines important flame features such as CO/CO2 ratio and H radical concentrations. The balancing of the methylene and methyne radical chemistry in both lean and rich environments is discussed in detail and the importance of molecular oxygen attack on (CH2)-C-3 is outlined. It is further shown that the present mechanism accurately predicts the qualitative evolution of methylene and methyne radical levels as a function of stoichiometry. The present study incorporates the benzene oxidation mechanism by Lindstedt and Skevis (1994) and the benzene formation steps, involving isometrization reactions between linear and cyclic C-6 intermediates, reported by Leung and Lindstedt (1995). The results obtained show that for rich acetylene flames the primary path for benzene formation passes via propargyl radical recombination and that benzene levels are generally satisfactorily predicted. However, computations also indicate that for leaner flames paths involving acetylene addition to n-C4H3 and 1,3-C3H5 radicals become increasingly important. This study also identifies reactions where further experimental investigations are required.									109	2	1	0	1	1	112			0010-2202			WOS:A1997YH99500004

These fluids are thought to play an important role in the generation of arc-magmas, but their affect on the subducted slab itself is less clear. In this study, the stable isotope geochemistry of the Corsican ophiolite, which is variably affected by subduction-related metamorphism, was investigated to assess the impact of subduction zone fluid flow on the downgoing slab. A total of 170 stable isotope analyses (oxygen and carbon) showed the following features: (1) overall, the ophiolite preserves the same oxygen isotope profile with depth as unmetamorphosed ophiolites; (2) the variation in oxygen isotope values for different areas does not correlate with metamorphic grade; (3) oxygen and carbon isotope values for calcite in the ophiolite are not in equilibrium with the ophiolite but are similar to those of the overlying calc-schists (Schistes Lustres); and (4) hydrogen isotopes indicate that serpentinitisation of ultramafics occurred during sub-seafloor hydrothermal alteration and probably also during tectonic emplacement of the ophiolite. These features indicate that large-scale fluid flow did not affect the Corsican ophiolite during subduction zone metamorphism. Calcite in the ophiolite was probably precipitated from CO2-bearing fluids derived from decompression dehydration reactions affecting the overlying Schistes Lustres during exhumation of the ophiolite-bearing Schistes Lustres nappes. Given that ocean crust must undergo at least some dehydration during prograde subduction zone metamorphism, the evolved fluids must be either highly channelled or exit the slab relatively quickly so as to not interact with it. The results of this study indicate that the important fluid pathways on Corsica have yet to be identified, but are probably the shear zones and fault systems that bound different slices of the high-pressure nappe stack.

The pinecone shaped ZnO photodetectors were synthesized via successive ionic layer by adsorption and reaction method (SILAR). The MSM device with silver (Ag) as contact electrode, possess simplicity in material synthesis and advantages in the device design and testing. Morphological evolution using SILAR method involves Ostwald's ripening process. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) study reveals the formation of pinecone like ZnO structure with high surface area for adsorption of oxygen molecules. The device exhibited good photoresponse and spectral responsivity under ultraviolet (UV) illumination (power density 1.8 mu Wcm(-2)) at 5 V bias voltage. At 365 nm wavelength, the highest peak responsivity observed was 350.98 A/W. The device showed good ohmic contact between metal semiconductor junctions. Our finding provides new route for the fabrication of low cost and highly selective UV photoconductive detectors.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			0040-6090			WOS:000413807200035

CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL				23	53			13233	13239		10.1002/chem.201702860				SEP 21 2017	2017	Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is extensively studied because of its potential applications in catalysis, electronic and optoelectronic devices, and composite nanostructures. However, a recent experimental study indicated that, contrary to current beliefs, MoS2 monolayers lack long-term stability in air. Here, a study is presented on the oxidation of MoS2 monolayers based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results suggest that single-layer MoS2 samples with exposed edge sites are indeed unstable to oxidation, which occurs because of the low energetic barrier to dissociation of oxygen molecules at the Mo-edges of MoS2. After an oxygen molecule dissociates, oxygen atoms replace sulfur atoms, and further oxidation causes the formation of a one-dimensional chain-like structure resembling that of bulk MoO3. This MoO3 structure facilitates the spread of oxidation onto the surface, and the stress associated with the misfit between the MoS2 and MoO3 lattices may cause the experimentally observed cracking of MoS2 flakes.									61	1	0	0	4	0	61			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000411357000036	28771850

The redox state of terrestrial basalts has to a large extent been inferred from the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios of their quenched glasses. However, this quantity appears to be significantly affected during late and post-eruptive processes in magmatic systems (e.g. by degassing, charge-transfer reactions of redox-variable species, and alteration), so that the degree to which the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios preserved in basaltic glasses reflect the oxidation state of the magma at high temperature is unclear. Because olivine is the first silicate mineral to crystallize from primitive basaltic liquids on cooling following decompression, the equilibrium partitioning relations preserved in olivine phenocrysts in basalts are, in principle, less disturbed by these late and post-eruptive processes and, therefore, may better reflect the high-temperature (pre-eruptive) conditions of the magma. Here we calibrate an oxybarometer based on the strong sensitivity of the partitioning of vanadium between olivine and silicate melt to oxygen fugacity. Our empirical parameterization, calibrated over a range of redox conditions between four log(10) units above and below the quartz-fayalite-magnetite (QFM) oxygen buffer, takes into account the effects of temperature, olivine composition (i.e. Mg/Fe ratios) and melt composition (namely the activities of CaO, SiO2, AlO1 center dot 5, NaO0 center dot 5 and KO0 center dot 5), and allows oxygen fugacity determinations to within similar to 0 center dot 25 log(10) units. We also explore the sensitivity of the exchange partitioning of Sc and Y between olivine and melt to temperature as a geothermometer. Our calibration indicates that this geothermometer allows temperature to be estimated to within 15 degrees C, but precision is strongly dependent on the Sc and Y measurements in olivine and melt.									78	10	1	0	2	1	85			0022-3530	1460-2415		WOS:000318572300005

Co- and Ni-substituted RuS2 were identified as potentially active HER electrocatalysts by high-throughput screening (HTS), and the specific compositions Co0.4Ru0.6S2 and Ni0.6Ru0.4S2 were identified by optimization. Hydrogen evolution activity of Co0.4Ru0.6S2 in HBr is greater than RuS2 or CoS2 and comparable to Pt and commercial RhxSy. Structural and morphological characterizations of the Co-substituted RuS2 suggest that the nanoparticulate solids are a homogeneous solid solution with a pyrite crystal structure. No phase separation is detected for Co substitutions below 30% by X-ray diffraction. In 0.5 M HBr electrolyte, the Co-Ru electrode material synthesized with 30% Co rapidly lost approximately 34% of the initial loading of Co; thereafter, it was observed to exhibit stable activity for HER with no further loss of Co. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the S-2(2-) sites are the most important for HER and the presence of Co influences the S-2(2-) sites such that the hydrogen binding energy at sufficiently high hydrogen coverage is decreased compared to ruthenium sulfide. Although showing high HER activity in a flow cell, the reverse reaction of hydrogen oxidation is slow on the RuS2 catalysts tested when compared to platinum and rhodium sulfide, leaving rhodium sulfide as the only suitable tested material for a regenerative HBr cell due its stability compared to platinum.									71	1	0	0	7	0	73			0743-7463			WOS:000313305900058	23205859	
J	PARNIK, T; KEERBERG, O								DECARBOXYLATION OF PRIMARY AND END-PRODUCTS OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS AT DIFFERENT OXYGEN CONCENTRATIONS								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY				46		SI		1439	1447		10.1093/jxb/46.special_issue.1439				SEP 1995	1995	A radiogasometric method for the determination of the rates of intracellular decarboxylation of primary and end products of steady-state photosynthesis in the light has been worked out. On the basis of oxygen dependence of the CO2 evolution, two types of decarboxylation, oxygenase (photorespiration) and oxidase (dark respiration), have been distinguished. Oxygenase decarboxylation is linearly dependent on O-2 concentration in the range from 0 to 210 mmoi mol(-1), which is characteristic of the oxygenation of RuBP, the rate-limiting reaction of the glycolate cycle. Oxidase decarboxylation is saturated at relatively low O-2 concentration (of about 15 mmol mol(-1)), similar to the oxidative reactions associated with glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. In the C-3 plants (tobacco, wheat, barley) we have studied, primary products were decarboxylated predominantly via the oxygenase mechanism; the oxidase component was 3-15% of the total rate of the decarboxylation of primary photosynthates in the light. The oxygenase mechanism was also involved in the decarboxylation of end products of photosynthesis. The rate of this component exceeded by 3 to 5 times the rate of oxidase decarboxylation of end products in the light. It has been suggested that compounds derived from the degradation of end products of photosynthesis are incorporated into the reductive pentose phosphate cycle and, via the cycle, into the glycolate cycle where they are decarboxylated. In this way, four components of plant leaf respiration in the light may be distinguished according to the substrates and mechanisms of decarboxylation. In the dark, only one of them, oxidase decarboxylation of end products, is functioning. The rate of this component has been shown to be partially suppressed by light.									66	1	2	0	58	0	70			0022-0957			WOS:A1995TD35700023		
J	McDonald, AE; Amirsadeghi, S; Vanlerberghe, GC								Prokaryotic orthologues of mitochondrial alternative oxidase and plastid terminal oxidase								PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				53	6			865	876		10.1023/B:PLAN.0000023669.79465.d2				DEC 2003	2003	The mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) and the plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) are two similar members of the membrane-bound diiron carboxylate group of proteins. AOX is a ubiquinol oxidase present in all higher plants, as well as some algae, fungi, and protists. It may serve to dampen reactive oxygen species generation by the respiratory electron transport chain. PTOX is a plastoquinol oxidase in plants and some algae. It is required in carotenoid biosynthesis and may represent the elusive oxidase in chlororespiration. Recently, prokaryotic orthologues of both AOX and PTOX proteins have appeared in sequence databases. These include PTOX orthologues present in four different cyanobacteria as well as an AOX orthologue in an alpha-proteobacterium. We used PCR, RT-PCR and northern analyses to confirm the presence and expression of the PTOX gene in Anabaena variabilis PCC 7120. An extensive phylogeny of newly found prokaryotic and eukaryotic AOX and PTOX proteins supports the idea that AOX and PTOX represent two distinct groups of proteins that diverged prior to the endosymbiotic events that gave rise to the eukaryotic organelles. Using multiple sequence alignment, we identified residues conserved in all AOX and PTOX proteins. We also provide a scheme to readily distinguish PTOX from AOX proteins based upon differences in amino acid sequence in motifs around the conserved iron-binding residues. Given the presence of PTOX in cyanobacteria, we suggest that this acronym now stand for plastoquinol terminal oxidase. Our results have implications for the photosynthetic and respiratory metabolism of these prokaryotes, as well as for the origin and evolution of eukaryotic AOX and PTOX proteins.									41	1	0	0	39	0	42			0167-4412	1573-5028		WOS:000220816200010	15082931

The three experimental systems considered here are Czochralski single-crystal growth, zinc diffusion, and oxide precipitation during wafer thermal annealing. All three systems are intimately connected at the atomistic level by the thermodynamic and transport properties of single point defects. The present work demonstrates how this microscopic overlap in these macroscopically distinct systems can substantially reduce uncertainty in model regression to experimental data, leading to strict bounds on the transport, reaction, and thermodynamic properties of the various species present. The resulting parameters lead to a solid, quantitative basis for modeling a wide variety of technologically important defect-related phenomena in silicon processing. Several different stochastic global optimization methods are employed to perform the computationally expensive multi-objective function minimization, namely simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, Tabu search and particle swarm optimization. These methods are compared and contrasted as part of the investigation and it is shown that a hybrid genetic algorithm that periodically incorporates a local search is the most robust approach for the types of problems considered in this work.

However, conventional synthetic methods can only obtain perovskite catalysts with large particle sizes, small surface areas, and few morphological features, leading to limited catalytic activity and thus posing a major challenge toward real-world applications. Reducing the size of bulk perovskites down to the nanosize represents an efficient way to improve the electrocatalytic performance. A comprehensive overview of recent progress in the nanostructuring of perovskites for catalyzing several key reactions in metal-air batteries, water splitting, and solid oxide fuel cells is provided. A range of synthetic protocols for making perovskite nanostructures are summarized, followed by an emphasis on how each method can be tailored to obtain high-performing perovskite nanocatalysts. These recent advances highlight the enormous potential of nanosized perovskites for facilitating the electrocatalytic reactions. The remaining challenges and future directions are pointed out for the development of next-generation perovskite-based nanostructured catalysts.									193	7	0	0	9	0	194			2366-9608			WOS:000438365300011		
C	Hu Xinglei			ASME					EXPERIMENT AND MECHANISM STUDY ON THE EFFECT OF COAL ASH ON THE CAPTURE OF ALKALI METALS IN ZHUNDONG COAL								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME POWER CONFERENCE JOINT WITH ICOPE-17, 2017, VOL 1										UNSP V001T04A044					2017	2017	A large number of Xinjiang Zhundong coal was found in China. Its high content of alkali metals can cause serious fouling/slagging problems which may lead to economic losses. It is significant to control the release of alkali metals from Zhundong coal during the combustion. Si-Al additives are used to capture Na released from the Zhundong coal. In this work, a combination of experimental research and quantum chemical calculation was used to study the effect of coal ash on the capture of alkali metal in Zhundong high alkali Coal and the related mineral evolution mechanism during melting processes. The experiments were done with Zhundong coal/coal ash mixtures at 900-1200 degrees C. The behavior mechanism of coal ash capturing alkali metals was analyzed from the perspective of mineral microstructure features by using XRD, ICP and quantum chemical calculation methods. The results show that during the process of combustions, complex chemical reactions occur among minerals after sodium is released from the coal and captured by the coal ash. The coal ash's ability to capture sodium in Zhundong high alkali coal rises firstly, and then gradually decreases with the rise. of temperature. It shows the best capture performance for sodium at 1000-1100 degrees C. The maximum efficiency of sodium absorption can reach to 50.6%. The coal ash shows a rather high efficiency compared with other additives. Furthermore, metals in Zhundong coal have opposite directions of migration. The Na, K, Al, Ca, and Mg migrated to the coal ash far away from the reaction interface, and the Fe and Mn were moved to the coal from the reaction interface. The original minerals of Zhundong coal mainly include calcium sulfate hydrate, quartz and kaolinite. Investigating the capture mechanism, it indicates that O (26) and O (22) in kaolinite have electrophilic reaction with Na+ and K+ easily, which would promote the rupture of aluminum-oxygen bonds. The O-2- of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal oxide would easily have nucleophilic reaction with Si (6) and Si (8) and prompt the rupture of bridging oxygen bonds (Si-O-Si). Kaolinite would be transformed into some other minerals that contains Na+ or K+ which have trend to form eutectics or evaporate into the flue gas easily, the degree of fouling and slagging on heating surface can be reduced based on these two most easily reaction paths.

Here, we developed a general route for synthesizing sub-3 nm nanoalloys on a carbon support via a shear-assisted liquid-metal reduction (SA-LMR) strategy. The utilization of shearing treatment resulted in the rapid release of electrons from the liquid sodium-potassium (NaK) alloy, which enabled the ultrafast reduction of precursor metal ions to metallic nanoalloys at room temperature. As a model system, Pt-Cu NPs with uniform distribution were synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The size, composition and structure of the Pt-Cu NPs could be tuned by controlling the volume of liquid NaK alloy and the reaction time. To prove the universality and utility of our method, the binary Pt-M (Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) and ternary Pt-Cu-Fe nanoalloys deposited on a carbon support were prepared as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts. This facile, rapid and universal synthesis technique has the potential to be employed in the large-scale production of nanomaterials and suggests a new direction for nanoalloys.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2516-0230			WOS:000586010700051	36132892

Counterpropagating gradients composed of two different thiols differing either in terminal functionality or in chain length were prepared, and their kinetic and environmental stability was inferred from spatially resolved contact angle measurements for samples stored under varying environmental conditions for periods up to one month. Chain length was found to correlate strongly with stability-a requirement for stability being that at least one of the chains be at least C-8 or longer. Spatially directed Cu deposition on All was demonstrated by forming Cu stripes on All, establishing that a sequence of different potential gradients could be used to define an area of deposition in the center of a working electrode. Dynamic spatiotemporal control of Cu deposition on Au was achieved by translating a potential window, which encompassed the Cu redox waves, across the All surface. The position of the Cu/Au transition was constant at a potential intermediate between the two waves, and the width of the transition region in the SPR images was narrower than either of the two electron transfer waves. Spatially directed oxidation of H2O2 was demonstrated by monitoring the formation of oxygen bubbles near the electrode. Consistent with predictions of the Butler-Volmer equation, the rate of bubble formation was found to depend on spatial position (overpotential) in these experiments.									44	0	0	0	2	0	46			1089-5647			WOS:000171032600043

No.02EX589)								212	13		10.1109/IMNC.2002.1178619				2002	2002	The control of Si oxidation with the atomic scale is necessary for nano-scale fabrication of ultra-thin gate-oxide layers in Si-based electronic devices such as MOSFETs. Dissociative chemisorption Of O2 molecules takes place on the Si(001) surface even at room temperature (passive oxidation) and thermal desorption of SiO molecules occurs at surface temperature (Ts) higher than 1000 K (active oxidation). The translational kinetic energy (Et) of incident O2 molecules affects the passive and active oxidation reactions. The determination of Et roles is an area of current interest from an application viewpoint as well as pure surface reaction dynamics studies. Current data concerning Et-dependent oxidation, however, is not sufficient to obtain complete understanding of Et roles. Therefore, we have performed Si18O (m/z:46) desorption yield measurements using supersonic seed molecular beams (SSMEBs) of the isotope 18O2. We found out a singular phenomenon, that is, the increase of Si18O desorption yield with decreasing the Et at Ts lower than 1000 K. In order to analyze the surface, we have performed real-time in-situ photoemission spectroscopy (PES) of Si-2p and O-1s core levels to obtain uptake curves of oxygen and information about time evolution of Si sub-oxides. The O-1s uptake curves and Si-2p PES spectra revealed the coexistence of the passive and active oxidation reactions. In this report, the Et effects for the Si(001) initial oxidation in the high Ts region in conjunction with the coexistence issue of the passive and active oxidation reactions is discussed on the basis of time evolution of Si-2p and O-1s photoemission spectra as well as the mass spectrometry of desorbed SiO molecules.

This experiment was carried out to assess the effects of unmodified biochar (30 g kg(-1) soil) and biochar-based nanocomposites (BNCs) of iron (30 g BNC-FeO kg(-1) soil), zinc (30 g BNC-ZnO kg(-1) soil), and a combined form (15 g BNC-FeO + 15 g BNC-ZnO kg(-1) soil) on dill (Anethum graveolens L.) plants under various salinity levels (non-saline, 6 and 12 dS m(-1)). The biochar-related treatments reduced sodium content of the plants, leading to a decline in osmolytes, antioxidant enzymes activities, reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, NADP reduction, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid in dill leaf tissues. The combined form of BNCs reduced sodium content of leaf tissue by about 22% and 26% under 6 and 12 dS m(-1) salinities, respectively. In contrast, addition of biochar, particularly biochar-based nanocomposites to the saline soil, enhanced potassium, iron, and zinc contents of leaf tissue, photosynthetic pigments, leaf water content, oxygen evolution rate, hill reaction and ATPase activities, endogenous indole-3-acetic acid, plant organs biomass, and consequently essential oil yield of plant organs. The combined form of BNCs in comparison with unmodified biochar improved vegetative, inflorescence, and seed biomass under 12 dS m(-1) salinity by about 33%, 25%, and 6%, respectively. These findings revealed that BNCs with novel structure can potentially enhance salt tolerance, plant biomass, and essential oil yield of different organs in salt-stressed dill plants through decreasing leaf sodium content and ROS generation and increasing nutrient availability, water status, and photosynthetic pigments.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0269-4042	1573-2983		WOS:000860229500001	36153765

For wastewater treatment by adsorption, pristine ZIFs presented high adsorption capacities of phenol while the carbon derivatives showed a negligible capacity, due to the collapse of frameworks during the pyrolysis, resulting in a sharp decrease in specific surface area and micropore fraction. However, the as-derived carbons exhibited excellent catalytic performances in degradation of phenol and p-hydroxybenzoic acid by advanced oxidation using peroxymonosulfate. Moreover, ZIF-67 derived carbons also produced the best performances in electrochemical oxygen reduction and evolution reactions due to a high graphitic degree, while ZIF-8 derived carbons showed the highest specific supercapacitance, attributing to the large mesopore volume and specific surface area. This study illustrated that the structures of ZIFs-derived carbon materials are determined by the metal species and constituents of the parental ZIFs as well as the pyrolysis conditions, making the carbons varying performances in environmental and electrochemical applications.									36	1	0	0	6	0	36			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000444000000067

The CoFe2O4 was doped in activated carbon (AC) as air cathode catalyst in microbial fuel cell (MFC). The obtained maximum power density (MPD) of MFC with 10% CoFe2O4 reached as high as 1780 +/- 20 mW m(-2), which was 1.99 times higher than that with bare AC. The electrochemical studies showed that CoFe2O4-doped AC exhibited superior kinetic activity of electron transfer and low resistance through four-electron reaction pathway. CoFe2O4 introduced binary metal as active sites during the oxidative recombination of the metal mixture. Besides, the first principle calculations proved that CoFe2O4 had better ORR activity comparing with Co3O4 and Fe3O4. It is verified experimentally and theoretically that CoFe2O4 will be an excellent cathodic catalyst in MFC.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000467662200016

Herein, we have developed a cost-effective and highly stable nanorod embedded wheat grain CoFeS2 in conjugation with a nitrogen containing carbon framework for pure H-2 production from H2S by reduction at the cathode and the sulfide oxidation reaction (SOR) at the anode. The proposed catalyst exhibits the lowest onset potential of 0.23 V vs. RHE to drive H2S electrolysis which is 1.0 V lower than the thermodynamic potential of electrochemical water splitting (1.23 V). Moreover, it demonstrates 97.8% H-2 faradaic efficiency with remarkable durability up to 120 h. These outcomes demonstrate a promising future prospective of H2S as a cost-effective H-2 source towards a more sustainable economy simultaneously eliminating the environmental pollutant.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000753580400001

Therefore, electrocatalytic materials have been designed with a simple approach using electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and thin film (AuTF) directly on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) paper. As-prepared paper electrocatalysts (AuNPs/rGO and AuTF/rGO) were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS Free-standing and flexible AuNPs/rGO and AuTF/rGO electrocatalysts have exhibited excellent performances on HER with low Tafel slopes (88 and 112 mV dec(-1)), low onset potentials (-47 and -55 mV), small overpotentials of only -176 and -204 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, and high durability even with the rolled design. The outstanding performance of these two electrocatalysts can be attributed to the uniform distribution of 20-nm-sized AuNPs and the deposition of well-ordered AuTF on rGO paper, providing an increment in the surface area and an enhancement of the electron density. CONCLUSION The controllable design of AuNPs/rGO and AuTF/rGO electrocatalysts, together with their high flexibility, good stability and promising results, suggest potential use in future applications of H-2 production in splitting water.

Herein, we firstly present the fabrication of an amorphous MoS2-MoO3-x/Ni3S2 heterostructure on the nickel foam (NF) substrate via a facile and low-cost electrochemical synthesis approach consisting of a spontaneous chemical reaction followed by one-step electrodeposition in a single solution. The chemical composition and the content of the bridging S22- sites (i.e., a highly active site for the HER) in the fabricated MoS2-MoO3-x/Ni3S2@NF could be conveniently modulated by controlling the temperature and applied potential during the electrodeposition. The optimized MoS2-MoO3-x/Ni3S2@NF shows an excellent electrocatalytic activity with a HER overpotential of 76 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and stabilizes for over 17 h under the HER conditions in a 1 M KOH electrolyte at room temperature, which are the best among the reported MoS2-based hybrid electrocatalysts for the alkaline HER. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations show that the excellent electrocatalytic performance of the fabricated MoS2-MoO3-x/Ni3S2 heterostructure could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the proper hydrogen binding free energies of MoS2 with abundant bridging S22- sites, the strong H2O adsorption of MoO3-x, and the strong adsorption of OH- to the Ni3S2. This study presents a delicately designed MoS2-based hybrid catalyst for efficient alkaline HER, which could shed light on the design and fabrication of inexpensive electrocatalysts for energy conversion.

Pristine AZTS photoanode yielded a photocurrent density of 4.0 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V vs. RHE. In order to improve the stability of Ag2ZnSnS4 photoanode, TiO2 offering more protection against the photo corrosion was deposited through an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process. IPCE measurements were used to evaluate solar energy utilization efficiencies of AZTS and TiO2/AZTS photoanodes, which showed 25% and 20% IPCE (510-530 nm) in water splitting reaction, respectively. The analysis of gas yield determined that the faradaic efficiency during the H-2 evolution process was over 90%. Furthermore, the reasons for the high photoelectrochemical performance of AZTS/Mo-mesh and mechanism of PEC H-2 evolution in system are discussed below.									23	1	0	0	2	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000459724300027

We describe herein the design and synthesis of a series of ultra-small hollow ternary alloy nanostructures using a simple one-pot strategy. The same technique was demonstrated for hollow PtNiCu nanoparticles, hollow PtCoCu nanoparticles and hollow CuNiCo nanoparticles. During synthesis, the displacement reaction and oxidative etching played important roles in the formation of hollow structures. Moreover, our hollow PtNiCu and PtCoCu nanoparticles were single crystalline, with an average diameter of 5 nm. Impressively, ultra-small hollow PtNiCu nanoparticles, containing only 10% Pt, exhibited greater electrocatalytic HER activity and stability than a commercial Pt/C catalyst. The overpotential of hollow PtNiCu nanoparticles at 10 mA cm(-2) was 28 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The mass activity was 4.54 A mg(Pt)(-1) at -70 mV versus RHE, which is 5.62-fold greater than that of a commercial Pt/C system (0.81 A mg(Pt)(-1)). Through analyses of bonding and antibonding orbital filling, density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the bonding strength of different metals to the hydrogen intermediate (H-*) was in the order of Pt > Co > Ni > Cu. The excellent HER performance of our hollow PtNiCu nanoparticles derives from moderately synergistic interactions between the three metals and H-*. This work demonstrates a new strategy for the design of low-cost and high-activity HER catalysts.									13	1	0	0	0	0	12			2095-5138	2053-714X		WOS:000697170300008	34691685

To address that, the technologies regarding energy conversion systems, such as water splitting and electroreduction of carbon dioxide, have attracted significant attention for a few decades. Yet, to date, the production of green fuels and/or high energy density chemicals like hydrogen, methane, and ethanol, are still suffering from many drawbacks including high energy consumption, low selectivity, and sluggish reaction rate. In this regard, nanostructured bimetallic materials that is capable of taking the full benefits of the coupling effects between different elements/components with structure modification in nanoscale are considered as a promising strategy for high-performance electrocatalysts. Herein, this review aims to outline the important progress of these nanostructured bimetallic electrocatalysts. It starts with the introduction of some important fundamental background knowledge about the reaction mechanism to understand how these reactions happen. Subsequently, we summarize the most recent progress regarding how the nanostructured bimetallic electrocatalysts manipulate the activity and selectivity of catalytic reactions in the order of bimetallic alloying effect, interface/substrate effect of bi-component electrocatalyst, and nanostructuring effect.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1674-4926			WOS:000570391500001

A first series of pure vanadium films are prepared by glancing angle deposition (GLAD). The incident angle a of the particle flux is systematically changed from 0 to 85. For the second series, the angle a is kept at 85 and oxygen gas is injected during the growth by means of the reactive gas pulsing process (RGPP). A constant pulsing period P = 16 s is used whereas the oxygen injection time t(ON) is varied from 0 to 6 s. After depositing, films are annealed in air following 11 incremental cycles from room temperature up to 550 degrees C. For both series, the DC electrical resistivity is systematically measured during the annealing treatment. Vanadium films sputter deposited by GLAD become sensitive to the temperature for incident angles a higher than 60 degrees. The most significant annealing effect is observed for films prepared with alpha = 85 degrees with a strong increase of resistivity from 2.6 x 10(-5) to 4.9 x 10(-3) Elm. It is mainly assigned to the oxidation of GLAD vanadium films, which is favoured by the high porous morphology produced for the highest incident angles. The resistivity vs. temperature evolution is also measured and related to the occurrence of the VO2 phase. By combining GLAD and RGPP processes, the reversible variation of resistivity associated to the VO2 phase is even more pronounced. Oxygen pulsing during deposition and the voided structure produced for the highest incident angles enhance the oxidation of vanadium through the films thickness. The porous architecture by GLAD and the oxygen injection by RGPP have to be carefully controlled and optimized for the growth of vanadium oxide compounds, especially to favour the formation of the VO2 phase.

To enhance the charge separation, Sb-doped CN (CN/Sb) was firstly synthesized using antimonate as a doping and oxidizing agent. The N-Sb-III bond was fabricated in CN/Sb via a redox process, which works as a charge-capture center, evidenced by experimental and theoretical calculation methods, and leads to a prominent enhancement in the charge separation and transfer performance of CN/Sb. CN/Sb exhibits much higher photocatalytic activity than CN in water splitting and environmental remediation. The visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of CN/Sb can reach similar to 1.75 mmol g(-1) h(-1), which is similar to 4.5 times that of CN, with an apparent quantum yield of 6.4% at 420 nm. Reactive oxygen species generation rates of CN/Sb are also much higher than those of CN. This work provides not only a new effective way for CN modification but also a deep insight into the metal-doping structure in the CN framework, which can guide future research on metal-doped CN photocatalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000500028900008

The following results were obtained by measurements of the transient fluorescence quantum and oxygen yield, respectively, induced by a train of short flashes in dark-adapted samples: (a) in the control the decay of the fluorescence quantum yield is very rapid after the first flash, if the dark incubation was performed in the presence of 300-mu-M K3[Fe(CN)6]; whereas, a characteristic binary oscillation was observed in the presence of 100-mu-M phenyl-p-benzoquinone with a very fast relaxation after the even flashes (2nd, 4th. . .) of the sequence; (b) illumination of the samples in the presence of K3[Fe(CN)6] for only 5 min with white light (180 W m-2) largely eliminates the very fast fluorescence decay after the first flash due to Q(A)- reoxidation by preoxidized endogenous non-heme Fe3+, while a smaller effect arises on the relaxation kinetics of the fluorescence transients induced by the subsequent flashes; (c) the extent of the normalized variable fluorescence due to the second (and subsequent) flash(es) declines in all sample types with a biphasic time dependence at longer illumination. The decay times of the fast (6-9 min) and the slow degradation component (60-75 min) are practically independent of the absence or presence of K3[Fe(CN)6] and of anaerobic and aerobic conditions during the photo-inhibitory treatment, while the relative extent of the fast decay component is higher under anaerobic conditions. (d) The relaxation kinetics of the variable fluorescence induced by the second (and subsequent) flash(es) become retarded due to photoinhibition, and (e) the oscillation pattern of the oxygen yield caused by a flash train is not drastically changed due to photoinhibition.Based on these findings, it is concluded that photoinhibition modifies the reaction pattern of the PS II acceptor side prior to protein degradation. The endogenous high spin Fe2+ located between Q(A) and Q(B) is shown to become highly susceptible to modification by photoinhibition in the presence of K3[Fe(CN)6] (and other exogenous acceptors), while the rate constant of Q(A)- reoxidation by Q(B)(Q(B)-) and other acceptors (except the special reaction via Fe3+) is markedly less affected by a short photoinhibition. The equilibrium constant between Q(A)- and Q(B) (Q(B)-) is not drastically changed as reflected by the damping parameters of the oscillation pattern of oxygen evolution.									19	0	0	0	16	0	19			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1992HM81900005	24407983

Here, highly dispersed metal (M = Ni, Co, Fe) phosphides modified g-C3N4 nanosheets (CNNS) were prepared through in situ precipitation and solid/gas-phase phosphorization. The results confirmed that metal phosphides (MPX) nanoparticles with high dispersion were well loaded on CNNS surface. The property well reveals the transfer path of photogenerated charges and the origin of high charge separation efficiency in photocatalytic reaction, thus yielding a remarkable catalytic activity. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) based on the NiPx/CNNS-900 is up to 6.61% at 400 nm while the H-2 evolution rate boosts to 4068.84 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1), which is 50 times higher than that of pristine CNNS. The mechanism could be attributed to the highly dispersed MPX nanoparticles on the surface of CNNS, which acted as effective active sites to promote the separation and migration of photogenerated charges, leading to greatly increase in H-2 production. This study is beneficial to further develop the high-efficient, low cost and environmentally-friendly CNNS-based photocatalytic materials for H-2 production.									33	3	0	0	4	0	33			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000441400000103

Taking overpotential as a direct criterion, we illustrate in theory and experiment that the adsorption energies of charged species such as Li++ e(-) and H++ e(-) are a central parameter to describe catalytic activities related to electricity-in/electricity-out efficiencies. The essence of catalytic activity is revealed to relate with electronic coupling between catalysts and charged species. Based on adsorption energy, some activity descriptors such as d-band center, eg-electron number and charge-transfer capacity are further defined by electronic properties of catalysts that directly affect interaction between catalysts and charged species. The present review is helpful for understanding the catalytic mechanisms of these electrocatalytic reactions and developing accurate catalytic descriptors, which can be employed to screen high-activity catalysts in future high-throughput calculations and experiments.									76	7	0	0	3	0	78			2095-5138	2053-714X		WOS:000440951600012

Unfortunately, their high preparation temperature usually results in particle sintering. It is challenging to achieve the ultra-dispersion of transition metal phosphide nanoparticles on conductive supports so as to enlarge their surface areas and reinforce their physical stability. In this study, we prepare fine MoP nanoparticles uniformly dispersed on hierarchical carbonaceous scaffolds by using strongly interacting Mo, P and C precursors. The resultant hybrid product possesses a three-dimensional open structure that allows a large fraction of MoP nanoparticles electrochemically accessible and suppresses their possible agglomeration during extended electrocatalysis. Electrochemical measurements show that the product has an impressive HER activity, only requiring an overpotential of 120 and 170 mV to achieve 10 mA/cm(2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1M KOH, respectively, as well as great cycling stability. Its performance can be further promoted via the controlled sulfur doping at surface to form molybdenum phosphosulfide, which reduces the overpotential at j = 10 mA/cm(2) to 92 mV and 158 mV for acidic and alkaline HER.									84	6	0	0	6	0	84			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000467661700065

Herein, 2D MoS2 nanosheets are used as a low-cost cocatalyst and loaded onto porous P-doped CN nanosheets (PCNNSs) to fabricate a 2D/2D noble-metal-free MoS2/PCNNSs photocatalyst via a simple in situ immersion pyrolysis method. The optimal H-2 evolution rate of the MoS2/PCNNSs sample reaches 1741 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is almost 2 times that of Pt/PCNNSs (976 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)). The outstanding activity mainly stems from the extended light absorption from 420 nm to the near-infrared 800 nm owing to MoS2 and P doping, as well as faster separation of photogenerated electrons and holes due to the close contact between PCNNSs and MoS2 induced by in situ fabrication method. This work unfolds new opportunities for the modification of cocatalysts to realize higher photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1862-6254	1862-6270		WOS:000613842400001

The effect of Sn content on the structure and electrocatalytic performance of Ti/PbO2-Sn anodes has been studied. The surface coating structure and composition of the anodes were characterized by SEM, EDX and XRD. The results reveal that a limited amount of doping Sn can improve the coating structure of the PbO2 layer, and an over-doping of Sn has an adverse effect on the coating structure and crystallinity of beta-PbO2. Linear polarization curves analysis shows that the novel Ti/PbO2-Sn anodes have higher oxygen evolution overpotential when compared to pure Ti/PbO2 electrode. The performance of electrodes for the electrochemical degradation of a model pollutant (phenol) was enhanced using the Ti/PbO2-Sn anode. The effects of current density, initial pH and supporting electrolyte on the electrochemical degradation of phenol by Ti/PbO2-Sn electrode were investigated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Weber, AL								Chemical constraints governing the origin of metabolism: The thermodynamic landscape of carbon group transformations under mild aqueous conditions								ORIGINS OF LIFE AND EVOLUTION OF BIOSPHERES				32	4			333	357		10.1023/A:1020588925703				AUG 2002	2002	The thermodynamics of organic chemistry under mild aqueous conditions was examined in order to begin to understand its influence on the structure and operation of metabolism and its antecedents. Free energies (DeltaG) were estimated for four types of reactions of biochemical importance - carbon-carbon bond cleavage and synthesis, hydrogen transfer between carbon groups, dehydration of alcohol groups, and aldo-keto isomerization. The energies were calculated for mainly aliphatic groups composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The energy values showed (1) that generally when carbon-carbon bond cleavage involves groups from different functional group classes (i.e., carboxylic acids, carbonyl groups, alcohols, and hydrocarbons), the transfer of the shared electron-pair to the more reduced carbon group is energetically favored over transfer to the more oxidized carbon group, and (2) that the energy of carbon-carbon bond transformation is primarily determined by the functional group class of the group that changes oxidation state in the reaction (i.e., the functional group class of the group that donates the shared electron-pair during cleavage, or that accepts the incipient shared electron-pair during synthesis). In contrast, the energy of hydrogen transfer between carbon groups is determined by the functional group class of both the hydrogen-donor group and the hydrogen-acceptor group. From these and other observations we concluded that the chemistry involved in the origin of metabolism (and to a lesser degree modern metabolism) was strongly constrained by (1) the limited redox-based transformation energy of organic substrates that is readily dissipated in a few energetically favorable irreversible reactions; (2) the energy dominance of a few transformation half-reactions that determines whether carbon-carbon bond transformation (cleavage or synthesis) is energetically favorable (DeltaG < -3.5 kcal/mol), reversible (Delta G between +/- 3.5 kcal/mol), or unfavorable (Delta G > +3.5 kcal/mol); and (3) the dependence of carbon group transformation energy on the functional group class (i.e., oxidation state) of participating groups that in turn is contingent on prior reactions and precursors in the synthetic pathway.									32	0	0	0	23	0	33			0169-6149	1573-0875		WOS:000178393000006	12458737

Over the past decade, a significant achievement has been made in identifying seven oxygenic photosynthesis-specific (OPS) subunits of NDH-1 enzyme, NdhL to NdhQ and NdhS, in several cyanobacterial strains. Six of them are also found in higher plants but not in nonphototrophs. This indicates an exclusive existence of these OPS Ndh subunits in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms and suggested certain role of cyanobacterial and chloroplastic NDH-1 in photosynthetic reactions. In this review, we describe these seven OPS subunits of cyanobacterial NDH-1, focusing on their identification, localization, function, and evolution from cyanobacteria to higher plants. A crucial role of these OPS subunits on the function of cyanobacterial NDH-1 is proposed.

Understanding how Delta G(Hads) can be tuned with support gives insight into MoS2 as a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The supports studied here include graphene oxide materials, heteroatom doped (S, B, and N) graphene, and some insulator materials (hexagonal boron nitride and graphitic carbon nitride). For the basal plane of MoS2, a wide range of values for Delta G(Hads) are observed (between 1.4 and 2.2 eV) depending on the support material used. It is found that Delta G(Hads) relates directly to the energy of occupied p-orbital states in the MoS2 catalyst, which is modified by the support material. On the Mo-edge of MoS2, different supports induce smaller variations in Delta G(Hads), with values ranging between -0.27 and 0.09 eV. However, a graphene support doped with graphitic N atoms produces a Delta G(Hads) value of exactly 0 eV, which is thermodynamically ideal for hydrogen evolution. Furthermore, Delta G(Hads) is found to relate closely and linearly to the amount of charge transfer between MoS2 and support when they adhere together. The support-induced tuning of Delta G(Hads) on MoS2 observed here provides a useful tool for improving current MoS2 catalysts, and the discovery of variables which mediate changes in Delta G(Hads) contributes to the rational design of new hydrogen evolution catalysts.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000617768200037	33523072

Three seeding groups of cicer negundo L. were treated with simulated acid rain at PH 3.0, 4.5 and 5.6 levels for three months. The results indicated the photosynthetic activity, expressed in terms of normalized oxygen evolution signal, photochemical energy storage, normalized variable fluorescence (F-v/F-m), photochemical and non-photochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching, ranges in the order PH 4.5 > pH 3.0 > pH 5.6. This stimulation effect has been confirmed by increased growth rate observed in relation with increased acidity levels. The nutritional aspects of this favorable effect of the acid rain on plant growth were discussed.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			0577-7496	1672-9072		WOS:000078463400017

Cardiomyocytes and their mitochondria are the main energy producers and consumers of the heart, and their metabolic changes during ischemia seem to be a key driver of reperfusion injury. Here, we hypothesized that tracking changes in cardiomyocyte metabolism, such as oxygen and ATP concentrations, would help in identifying points of metabolic failure during ischemia and reperfusion. To track some of these changes continuously from the onset of ischemia through reperfusion, we developed a system of differential equations representing the chemical reactions involved in the production and consumption of 67 molecular species. This model was validated and used to identify conditions present during periods of critical transition in ischemia and reperfusion that could lead to oxidative damage. These simulations identified a range of oxygen concentrations that lead to reverse mitochondrial electron transport at complex I of the respiratory chain and a spike in mitochondrial membrane potential, which are key suspects in the generation of reactive oxygen species at the onset of reperfusion. Our model predicts that a short initial reperfusion treatment with reduced oxygen content (5% of physiological levels) could reduce the cellular damage from both of these mechanisms. This model should serve as an open-source platform to test ideas for treatment of the ischemia reperfusion process by following the temporal evolution of molecular concentrations in the cardiomyocyte.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1083-351X		WOS:000860390500001	35157851

The achievement has been realized through a series of different hydrogen dilution ratio treatment by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition system. Raman scattering, x-ray diffraction, and ultraviolet-visible transmission techniques have been employed to characterize the physical structural characterization and to elucidate the structure evolution. The bonding configuration of the oxygen impurities was investigated by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the Si-O stretching mode of infrared-transmission, indicating that the films were well oxidized in SiO2 form. Based on the consistence between the proposed structure factor and the oxygen content, we have demonstrated that there are two dominant disordered structure regions closely related to the post-oxidation contamination: plate-like configuration and clustered microvoids.

We show that the substrate temperature during nickel oxide sputtering governs the composition of the pristine NiO(x)film and the OER performance. Two dedicated nickel oxide species are found with Ni2+ corresponding to stoichiometric NiO while Ni3+ indicates an oxygen rich NiOx (x > 1) phase. With decreasing deposition temperature, the ratio of Ni3+/Ni2+ in the pristine NiO(x)film increases. Information depth dependent synchrotron related photoemission spectroscopy further suggests that oxygen rich NiOx is found on top of the surface and at the grain boundaries. The OER onset potential improves from 1.55 V to 1.1 V in correlation to an increasing Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio in the pristine NiO(x)film and an increasing emission from a nickel oxyhydroxide phase (h-NiOx) after photo-assisted cyclic-voltammetry in alkaline solution. Upon electrochemical treatment, a reconditioning process is observed with the formation of h-NiOx that consists of Ni(OH)(2) and NiOOH, while NiOx disappears. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

Non-precious metals phosphide has the potential to become a non-noble metal electrocatalyst due to its good electronic structure effect, extremely low price, and expected durability in a larger pH range. In this paper, hexagonal NiCoP porous nanosheets were synthesized using a facile hydrothermal and post-phosphating method. We anticipate that bimetal doping can further enhance electrocatalyst activity as well as improve the capability of absorbing hydrogen from the materials by modifying the electronic structure. The obtained NiCoP electrocatalyst behaves outstanding catalytic performances for HER in alkaline media with 83 mV initial overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2), as well as the low Tafel slopes of 41 mV dec(-1). In addition, the current density showed almost no attenuation in the 10 h chronoamperometry experiment. The outstanding catalytic function can be attributed to the nanosheets with many orifices, which can expand the effective reaction specific surface area, promote mass transport and boost the water decomposition efficiency. And the collaboration of Ni and Co in NiCoP nanosheets can also improve the electrochemical function. Moreover, the current work offers a feasible approach for synthesizing a cheap and efficient NiCoP electrocatalyst for HER, which is especially appealing to practical application.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000762840400004

The coordination mode of transition metal ions can directly affect the catalytic performance of catalysts. Herein, this paper reports that two kinds of Cu-based composites (CuSCN and CuSCN/C3N4) are prepared by in situ controllable crystallization of copper foam (CF) through electropolymerization and calcination. As a comparison, it is clarified that the different coordination modes of Cu1+ ions determine the different catalytic properties. The samples can be switched freely by tuning the electropolymerization period, which leads to different coordination modes of Cu1+ ions dramatically, thus affecting the electrocatalytic performance of composite materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in turn. Thorough characterization using techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and synchrotron-based near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, reveals that strong interactions between CuSCN and C3N4 of CuSCN/C3N4 facilitate the formation of subtle coordinated N-Cu-S species, of which electronic structures are changed. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electrons can penetrate from CuSCN to N atoms present in C3N4. As a result, CuSCN/C3N4 demonstrates a better catalytic performance than the conventional transition-metal-based electrocatalysts. Besides, CuSCN/C3N4 reflects almost identical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and stability in an acid electrolyte with Pt/C.									7	2	0	0	0	0	7			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000475482200019	31259334

Our results show that, the oxidation majorly occurs in the aromatic hydrocarbon (AH), which may debranch the side chains of aromatic derivatives forming isolated long-chain carboxylic acids, or introduce carboxyl to the tail of the branch chains in aromatic structures. The elevated interactions between adjacent debranched side chains in AH as well as condensation of the AH fragments will occur, which will transfer the AH components to resins and result in a quasi-linear correlation between the viscosity and total acid number (TAN) of heavy oil. Upon pyrolysis, resins in original heavy oil will be fragmented accompanied with decarboxylation; while the prior oxidation to heavy oil, although increases the viscosity, will benefit the fragmentation and decarboxylation, leading to approximate viscosity reduction behavior. Our work reveals that the oxygen content should be an important factor that contributes to the high viscosity of heavy oil, which could render reliable reference for developing new strategies to efficiently recover heavy oil reservoirs.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000417103800014

Herein, a hybrid electrocatalyst was successfully prepared by growing layered alpha-phase NiFe hydroxide on mildly oxidized carbon nanotubes (NixFe1-x(OH)(2)/CNT) through a hydrothermal process. Then, NixFe1-x(OH)(2)/CNT hybrids with defect structures accompanied by a change from Fe(OH)(2) to alpha-FeOOH were prepared via in situ oxidation of Fe(OH)(2) with H2O2 solution. In situ Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the change of the electrocatalysts under different potentials and identify the active sites in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. In addition, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy was employed to probe the metal defects in the hybrid. The outstanding electrocatalytic efficiency of Ni1/2Fe1/2(OH)(2)/CNT with defects was accessible with a remarkably small overpotential of 244 mV and Tafel slope of 41 mV per decade for the OER in a 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution. Its bifunctional electrocatalytic efficiency was also evaluated using a two-electrode system, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an applied voltage of 1.64 V by loading the electrocatalyst on nickel foam. Furthermore, the high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of similar to 10.3% for the bifunctional electrocatalyst indicates that the introduction of defects into the catalyst can significantly improve its catalytic efficiency, making it a promising low-cost catalyst for overall water splitting.									34	2	0	0	0	0	34			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000661592000001

Although considerable efforts have been paid to create efficient catalysts for HER, the development of an affordable HER catalyst with superior performance under mild conditions is still highly desired. In this work, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-templated strategy is proposed for in situ coupling of cobalt phosphide (CoP) polyhedrons nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Due to the synergistic catalytic effect between CoP polyhedrons and CNTs, the as-prepared CoP-CNTs hybrids show excellent HER performance. The resultant CoP-CNTs demonstrate excellent HER activity in 0.5 m H2SO4 with Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1), small onset overpotential of approximate to 64 mV, and a low overpotential of approximate to 139 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Additionally, the catalyst also manifests superior durability in acid media. Considering the structure diversity of MOFs, the strategy presented here can be extended for synthesizing other well-defined metal phosphides-CNTs hybrids, which may be used in the fields of catalysis, energy conversion and storage.									199	10	0	0	5	0	203			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000399019700001	28145620

Here, we report an Ir-based HER catalyst supported by N-doped carbon nanosheets (Ir-NCNSs). The NCNSs, with a high surface area and unique atomic composition, enable Ir nanoparticles (NPs) to disperse at 2-3 nm and strongly coordinate to the Ir through Ir-N bonds, which exposes many active sites and strengthens their durability. The catalyst displays a low over-potential and a small Tafel slope of 46.3 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 52 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. When used in 1.0 M KOH, Ir-NCNSs also show excellent electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 125 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The calculated results further suggest that Ir NPs and NCNSs have excellent selectivity for strong metal-support interactions, corresponding to a significant and stable HER characteristic. Our findings provide insight into the design of high-efficiency Ir-based HER catalysts.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000655027500034	33950664	
J	Wydrzynski, TJ								Early indications for manganese oxidation state changes during photosynthetic oxygen production: a personal account								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				80	1-3			125	135		10.1023/B:PRES.0000030429.31799.fc				2004	2004	One of the major questions yet to be answered in photosynthesis research today is what is the chemical mechanism for the oxidation of water into molecular oxygen. It is well established that an inorganic cluster of four manganese ions and at least one calcium ion form the catalytic core. As the oxidation potential generated by the Photosystem II reaction center is accumulated over the four sequential steps needed to produce O-2, changes in the oxidation state of the catalytic manganese occur, though the formal oxidation states that are involved are still a matter of considerable debate. Much of what is currently known has come from direct measurements of the catalytic manganese using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray spectroscopy. However, in the early attempts to attack this problem, the catalytic manganese was monitored indirectly by its paramagnetic effect on the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rates of solvent water protons. In this contribution, a description of the proton relaxation rate phenomenon and its use to indicate manganese oxidation state changes during O-2 production is presented.									7	0	0	0	3	0	7			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000221878600010	16328815

Studies of the real structure and surface property evolution at sintering under air up to 1100 degrees C revealed some redistribution of elements between the phases without new phase formation. Sizes of both phase domains remain in nanorange even in the dense material, thus providing a developed perovskite-fluorite interface. The surface layer of nanocomposite is enriched by LSM. The oxygen mobility and reactivity estimated by the oxygen isotope exchange and O-2 TPD exceed those for LSM suggesting a positive role of interfaces as fast oxygen migration paths. Button-cell tests with the LSM/ScCeSZ interlayer between LSNF and a thin ScYSZ layer covering Ni/YSZ cermet demonstrated a high and stable performance promising practical application promising for practical application.

The main bioenergetic process of these organisms, photosynthesis, was studied by measuring both oxygen evolution and chlorophyll a fluorescence emission parameters. Nanoceria significantly inhibited photosynthesis in the cyanobacterium in the entire range of concentrations tested (0.01-100 mg/L), while a dual effect of nanoceria was found in the green alga with slight stimulation at low concentrations and strong inhibition at the highest concentrations tested. Chlorophyll a fluorescence experiments indicated that nanoceria had a significant impact on the primary photochemical processes of photosystem II. The primary cause of the observed photosynthetic inhibition by nanoceria is an excessive level of ROS formation; the results indicated a strong generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which caused oxidative damage, as evidenced by lipid peroxidation in both photosynthetic organisms. it is proposed that nanoceria can increase the production of hydrogen peroxide (a normal ROS by-product of light-driven photosynthesis) in both the green alga and the cyanobacterium; through an oxidative reaction, these ROS cause lipid peroxidation, compromising membrane integrity and also seriously impairing photosynthetic performance, eventually leading to cell death.

The catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of these anodes are determined by calcination temperature, coating loading (coating thickness), pretreatment of titanium substrate and coating method. The difference in OER performance among the anodes are ascribed to the crystallinity of the IrO2 phase and the phase composition of the coatings. The durability of the anodes were also studied by conducting an accelerated lifetime test (ALT) in acidic 0.9 mol L-1 Na2SO4 solution at a current density of 5 kA m(-1). An anode prepared at a moderate temperature exhibits an excellent lifetime of almost one year although its catalytic activity is not the best. Nevertheless, using the electrostatic spraying method to replace the hand-brush method in the coating preparation can prolong the service life even further and with less amount of coating loading. Moreover, it reveals that the coating loss or combined with titanium substrate passivation results in the eventual deactivation of the anodes during ALT. No critical value of the amount of the residual iridium was found in this work to predict the eventual deactivation before forming the passive oxide film. In addition, the deactivation of the anodes strongly depends on the calcination temperature.									11	1	0	0	1	0	12			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000462108000008		
J	Song, Li; Fan, Haiyun; Fan, Xiaoli; Gong, Hao; Wang, Tao; He, Jianping								A simultaneous phosphorization and carbonization strategy to synthesize a defective Co2P/doped-CNTs composite for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				435						134612	10.1016/j.cej.2022.134612				MAY 1 2022	2022	Integration of heteroatom doped carbon material and metal phosphide is an ideal strategy for bifunctional oxygen reduction and evolution catalysis. In this work, heteroatoms doped carbon nanotubes, together with cobalt phosphide (Co2P/doped-CNTs) are prepared with a simultaneous phosphorization and carbonization strategy. It is revealed that the in-situ generated Co2P weakens the catalytic graphitization effect of metallic Co during the carbonization process, thus bringing about large numbers of defects, which is conducive to generating more pyridinic-N species in the carbon nanotube. As a result, the ORR-active pyridinic-N species and the OER-active Co2P are enriched in the carbon nanotube after the introduction of phosphorus, therefore providing dual active sites. The resultant Co2P/doped-CNTs catalyst shows outstanding ORR and OER performances, which are comparable to those of the commercial counterparts. The bifunctional activity makes Co2P/doped-CNTs an effective air-cathode catalyst for the rechargeable zinc-air batteries, showing a high power density and prominent cycling stability. This work abandons the traditional post-treatment phosphating method and realizes the integration of simplicity, safety and high efficiency.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773585400004		
J	LAVERGNE, J; JUNGE, W								PROTON RELEASE DURING THE REDOX CYCLE OF THE WATER OXIDASE								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				38	3			279	296		10.1007/BF00046752				DEC 1993	1993	Old and very recent experiments on the extent and the rate of proton release during the four reaction steps of photosynthetic water oxidation are reviewed. Proton release is discussed in terms of three main sources, namely the chemical production upon electron abstraction from water, protolytic reactions of Mn-ligands (e.g. ore-bridges), and electrostatic response of neighboring amino acids. The extent of proton release differs between the four oxidation steps and, greatly varies as a function of pH both, but differently, in thylakoids and PS II-membranes. Contrastingly, it is about constant in PS II-core particles. In any preparation, and on most if not all reaction steps, a large portion of proton transfer can occur very rapidly (< 20 mu s) and before the oxidation of the Mn-cluster by Y-Z(+) is completed. By these electrostatically driven reactions the catalytic center accumulates bases. An additional slow phase is observed during the oxygen evolving step, S-3 double right arrow S-4 --> S-0. Depending on pH, this phase consists of a release or an uptake of protons which accounts for the balance between the number of preformed bases and the four chemically produced protons. These data are compatible with the hypothesis of concerted electron/proton-transfer to overcome the kinetic and energetic constraints of water oxidation.									142	2	0	0	97	0	142			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1993MX41700007	24317981

The gradually changing morphologies and microstructures of cerium oxide were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. A top-down path is illuminated to have an insight to the morphological transformation from nanorod to nanotube by adjusting the reaction time. The growth process is investigated by preparing a series of intermediate morphologies during the shape evolution of CeO(2)nanostructure based on the scanning electron microscopy image observation. On the basis of the time-dependent experimental observation, the possible formation mechanism related to oriented attachment and Oswald ripening was proposed, which might afford some guidance for the synthesis of other inorganic nanotubes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-6203			WOS:000358158900045	26151866

Migration and capture of active electrons are central to catalytic ozonation reactions, which was not studied or reviewed more clearly. Based on this perspective, the catalytic ozonation potential of 2D-LCMs synthesized by numerous methods is firstly contrasted to guide the design of subsequent carbon based-catalysts, and not limited to 2D-LCMs. Matching ROS to active sites is a key step in understanding the catalytic mechanism. The structure-activity relationships between reported numerous active sites and ROS evolution is then constructed. Result showed that center dot OH could be produced by-OH,-C=O,-COOH groups, defective sites, immobilized metal atoms, doped heteroatoms and photo-induced electrons; and center dot O-2- could be produced by-OH groups and sp2-bonded carbon. The normalized model further be used to visually compare the contribution degree of various regulatory methods to performance improvement. More importantly, this review calls for 2D-LCMs-based catalytic ozonation to be studied without circumventing the issue of structural stability, which would lead to many proposals of catalysts and its involved catalytic reactionmechanism being meaningless.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0048-9697	1879-1026		WOS:000793435200004	35395298

This hierarchically porous structure can expose active sites efficiently and is also favorable for electrolyte permeation and O-2 diffusion. Furthermore, the self-generation of CNTs can improve electron conduction. Co,N/FLC @CNT has high contents of pydinic- and graphitic-N and large electrochemical active surface area (463 cm(2)). The Co,N/FLC@CNT presents excellent ORR activity in terms of high limiting current density (5.6 mA cm(-2)) and half-wave potential (0.82 V), which is almost the same as commercial Pt/C. The H2O2 yield of Co,N/FLC @CNT for ORR is 11.3%, which is close to that of Pt/C (8.0%). The ORR on Co,N/FLC @CNT proceeds via 4e(-) path.

The hybridization of MoxW2-xC with N-doped carbon enables effective regulation of the electrocatalytic performance of the composite nanowires, endowing abundant accessible active sites derived from N-doping and MoxW2-xC incorporation, outstanding conductivity resulting from the N-doped carbon matrix, and appropriate positioning of the d-band center with a thermodynamically favorable hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(H*)) for efficient hydrogen evolution catalysis, which forms a binder-free 3D self-supported monolithic electrode with accessible nanopores, desirable chemical compositions and stable composite structure. By modulating the Mo/W ratio, the optimal Mo1.33W0.67C @ NC nanowires on carbon cloth achieve a low overpotential (at a geometric current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) of 115 and 108 mV and a small Tafel slope of 58.5 and 55.4 mV dec(-1)in acidic and alkaline environments, respectively, which can maintain 40 h of stable performance, outperforming most of the reported metal-carbide-based HER electrocatalysts.									38	2	0	0	3	0	38			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000557658600001

Such plasma is characterized by a high temperature of both neutral and ionized gaseous atoms, which can easily reach several 1000K. The electron temperature is often between 15000 and 30000K, and the electron density usually exceeds 10(20) m(-3). At such conditions, several reactions untypical for low pressure plasmas occur.

The results of N-2 adsorption/desorption showed that CeO2 nanorods possessed large pore volume, which was about 7-fold of that in conventionally synthesized CeO2 nanoparticles. TEM images revealed the exposure of more reactive {200} and {220} planes, consistent with the favorable formation of more oxygen vacancies on the surface, as confirmed by XPS and O-2-TPD. TPR results demonstrated that low temperature reducibility (max. at 334 degrees C) maintained after reduction-oxidation cycles and even after heat treatment at 900 degrees C, indicating the strong stability of surface active oxygen species. Based on time-dependent morphology evolution of as-prepared precursor, the formation mechanism of nanorod structure was proposed. Furthermore, catalytic performance of CeO2 nanorods in methane combustion was investigated and compared with that of CeO2 nanoparticles. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, their catalytic activities are usually restricted by the absence of active sites inside the nanospheres and the inadequate communications between the interior and exterior of the nanospheres. Therefore, it can be anticipated that great improvement will be achieved if a porous three-dimensional catalytic system can be designed, through which the activity sites can be distribute interior and exterior. Herein, polydopamine (PDA) NPs with uniform sizes of 300 nm are prepared. Then, the Ru nanoclusters (Ru NCs) are uniformly generated inside and on the surface of the PDA NPs to afford the bi-nanospheres (Ru-PDA NPs). After annealing, the porous carbonized Ru-PDA NPs (Ru-cPDA-750 NPs) with electroactive nitrogen atoms are finally obtained, exhibiting small overpotential (42 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)), low value of Tafel slope (35 mV decade(-1)) and robust stability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which are comparable to that of Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, the study on the effect of Ru NCs amount on electrocatalytic ability reveals that RucPDA NPs loaded with 0.08 wt% of Ru NCs exhibit the best HER catalytic performance compared with the Ru-cPDA NPs loaded with other amount of Ru NCs (0.04-0.16 wt%).

When NO2 is excited to energies above dissociation threshold, overlapping resonances interfere and give rise to final state-selected spectra which depend on the monitored final state of the NO product. The differences. among the spectra diminish with the degree of incoherent superposition (e.g., thermal averaging). In this article, we describe the experimental manifestations of overlapping resonances in the case of barrierless unimolecular reactions and how they relate to transition state theories. We treat the unimolecular reaction of NO2 using resonance scattering theory combined with random matrix formalism and distinguish between the near-threshold region where the transition state is loose and dissociation at higher excess energies where the transition state has tightened significantly. The final state-selected spectra and their dependence on the degree of resonance overlap are simulated in a qualitative way. Experimentally, fluctuations are observed in the Line shapes, positions, and intensities in the spectra; the rotational and vibrational NO state distributions; the spin-orbit states of the oxygen atom correlated with specific quantum states of NO; and the state-specific rates, We show how the patterns of fluctuations in the rotational distributions allow the distinction between the loose and tight transition state cases and discuss the evolution of the excited complex from transition state to final products. In spite of the fluctuations, the averaged results agree well with the predictions of statistical theories, and implications for the transition state and the adiabatic evolution of the NO degrees of freedom are discussed. Even when the product state distributions agree with the predictions of specific statistical models, caution should be exercised in inferring properties of the transition state, due to the unaccounted influence of final state interactions beyond the transition state.									69	0	0	0	0	0	69			0022-3654			WOS:A1996TP94200011		
B	Wei Yao; Bo Li								Application of dynamic zone flamelet model to a GH2/GO2 rocket combustor								AIAA Propulsion and Energy 2019 Forum								22 pp.	22 pp.						2019	2019	A dynamic zone flamelet model is proposed and validated in this study. The model divides the whole computational domain into different zones and uses a local flamelet to describe the chemistry status within each zone. The zone division constantly updates with the time-variant mixture fraction fields. Each zone is in irregular shape and contains a random number of CFD cells. The flamelet evolution equation due to convective transport, molecular diffusion, and chemical reactions is derived through redefining the conditional average within each zone. In highly compressible supersonic flows, the density, temperature, and velocity do not correlate with the mixture fraction any more; thus only the species mass fraction in each flamelet is used. The flamelet temperature equation is not solved, but a computationally-efficient statistical method is used for the conditional temperature, which then determines the reaction progress. The DZFM is then applied to a GH2/GO2 rocket combustor based on an Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (IDDES) framework and a total of 20,557 flamelet zones. The predicted wall heat flux, mean temperature and mean hydrogen concentration are generally comparable with the available experimental measurement and the previous predictions in the literature. The evolution of flamelet variables with the axial height and the time shows that the current model has the capability of characterizing the transient chemistry status, which would especially useful for unsteady combustion modeling by large eddy simulation.

The cis-dihydrodiol product of dioxygenase bioconversion is converted to a phenol by acidification or to a catechol by reaction with cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase. Gibbs reagent reacts quickly with these oxygenated aromatics to yield colored products that are quantifiable using a microplate reader or by digital imaging and image analysis. The method is reproducible and quantitative at product concentrations of only 30 muM, with essentially no background from media components. This method is an effective general screen for aromatic oxidation and should be a useful tool for the discovery and directed evolution of oxygenases.									14	1	0	0	10	0	16			1087-0571	1552-454X		WOS:000170471100002	11689121

Here, we report oxygen atom uptake from water under ambient conditions, producing H-2 in the presence of alloyed Au-Rh nanoparticle catalysts encapsulated in a "click"-dendrimer. These systems are named nanozymes (NZs) because their function and mechanism resemble those of hydrogenase enzymes. The Au-Rh NZs with variable proportions of Au and Rh exhibit positive sharp volcano-type synergy and visible light-induced acceleration. The best synergy in the dark is disclosed in Au4Rh1, achieving a turnover frequency (TOFs) of 5100 mol(H2) mol(cata)(-1) min(-1) in dark, 3.4 times higher than the related Au NZ and 8.9 times higher than the related Rh NZ at 25 +/- 1 degrees C. The catalytic activity of Au-Rh for H-2 evolution is enhanced by visible light irradiation due to the Au plasmon, so that the synergistic effect in the dark and the visible light-induced rate enhancement cumulate for Au4Rh1, allowing for complete B-2(OH)(4) hydrolysis in 39 s at 25 +/- 1 degrees C (TOFs = 6000 mol(H2) mol(cata)(-1) min(-1)). Upon increasing the Rh content, Au- Rh provides less synergy in the dark, whereas the light enhancement of the reaction rate increases, reaching a maximum for Au1Rh2. Experiments using D2O, including kinetic isotope effect determination, suggest that the rate-determining step of the reaction involves concerted O-H bond cleavage of water and support the proposed catalytic reaction mechanism.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000813003600001

Carbon-based metal hybrid materials with unique edge sites, good chemical stability, high electrical conductivity, and synergetic effects exhibit great potential. However, there are few studies on the effect of the carbon-based support on catalytic performance. In this study, we explored the synergy between the carrier and metal (Ru), and studied the effect of the carrier and metal crystallinity on the catalytic performance of HER. The performance of Ru nanoparticles (Ru NPs) catalyst supported on carbon quantum dots (Ru@CQDs) was superior to that on other carbon supports. In addition, the HER performance of the Ru@CQDs catalyst was highly dependent on the crystallinity and confinement effects. Experimental results indicate that the Ru NPs were successfully anchored by strong coordination interactions between the d orbitals of Ru and the surface functional groups of CQDs, which is beneficial to the confinement of Ru NPs around the CQDs and to prevent their aggregation. The results will guide the design of inexpensive Ru-based HER electrocatalysts.									63	5	0	0	4	0	64				2052-1537		WOS:000506835500021

To understand how the ORR activity of molecular catalysts can be controlled by the active site structure through modification by the pH and substituent functional groups, the change of the ORR onset potential and the electron number in a broad pH range was examined for three different metallocorroles. Experiments revealed a switch between two different ORR mechanisms and a change from 2e(-) to 4e(-) pathway in the pH range of 3.5-6. This phenomenon was shown by density functional theory (DFT) calculations to be related to the protonation of the nitrogen atoms and carboxylic acid groups on the corroles indicated by the pK(a) values of the protonation sites in the vicinity of the ORR active sites. Control of the electron-withdrawing nature of these groups characterized by the pK(a) values could switch the ORR from the H+ to e(-) rate-determining step mechanisms and from 2e(-) to 4e(-) ORR pathways and also controlled the durability of the corrole catalysts. The results suggest that protonation of the nitrogen atoms plays a vital role in both the ORR activity and durability for these materials and that pK(a) of the N atoms at the active sites can be used as a descriptor for the design of high-performance, durable PGM-free catalysts.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000629780600001	33629811

This method resulted in the formation of a thin, porous, low mass-percentage amorphous carbon coating (< 5 nm, <= 1.2 wt % C) on the nanowire with an increase in single-nanowire electronic conductivity of roughly 5 orders of magnitude (alpha-MnO2, 3.2 x 10(-6) S cm(-1); C-MnO2, 0.52 S cm(-1)) and an increase in surface Mn3+ (average oxidation state: alpha-MnO2, 3.88; C-MnO2, 3.66) while suppressing a phase change to Mn3O4 at high temperature. The enhanced physical and electronic properties of the C-MnO2 NWs-enriched surface Mn3+ and high conductivity-are manifested in the electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), where a 13-fold increase in specific activity (alpha-MnO2, 0.13 A m(-2); C-MnO2, 1.70 A m(-2)) and 6-fold decrease in charge transfer resistance (alpha-MnO2, 6.2 k Omega; C-MnO2, 0.9 k Omega) were observed relative to the precursor alpha-MnO2 NWs. The C-MnO2 NWs, composed of similar to 99 wt % MnO2 and similar to 1 wt % carbon coating, also demonstrated an ORR onset potential within 20 mV of commercial 20% Pt/C and a chronoamperometric current/stability equal to or greater than 20% Pt/C at high overpotential (0.4 V vs RHE) and high temperature (60 degrees C) with no additional conductive carbon.									32	3	0	0	2	0	34			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000423140400065	29266915	
C	Pantelides, ST; Ramamoorthy, M						Dunham, ST; Nelson, JS		Atomic dynamics during silicon oxidation and the nature of defects at the Si-SiO2 interface								SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESS AND DEVICE PERFORMANCE MODELLING		MATERIALS RESEARCH SOCIETY SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS		490				59	70						1998	1998	Oxidation of thin-film Si, oxygen precipitation in bulk crystalline Si, and the formation of buried oxide layers (as in the SIMOX process for SOI) have been studied extensively for decades but the underlying atomic scale processes have remained elusive. Furthermore, common features of these phenomena have not been generally appreciated, in part because the kinetics are substantially different in the different cases. In this paper we review recent theoretical research based on atomic-scale first-principles calculations that provides a unified description of the three phenomena. In particular, we account for both the normal and enhanced mode of oxygen diffusion that leads to the formation of oxygen clusters known as thermal donors and their subsequent annealing and evolution into SiO2-like precipitates. It is proposed that a novel family of interface defects that are akin to thermal donors, composed of "frustrated" Si-O bonds, are a natural by-product of thin-film oxidation. An explicit mechanism for the emission of Si interstitials, which occurs during both oxidation and oxygen precipitation, is obtained. It is shown that emission of Si interstitials eliminates the frustrated-bond defects, thus explaining the high quality of the resulting interfaces. It is proposed that frustrated-bond defects are responsible for much of the behavior observed at the Si-SiO2 interface that cannot be accounted by dangling bonds and for the amphoteric traps that occur in high concentrations in SOI material.

In this paper, an iron-rich copper ore, mainly containing CuO, CuFe2O4, SiO2 and Al2O3, was used as an inexpensive oxygen carrier (OC) for chemical looping combustion of methane. The activity for methane oxidation, the stability during long-term CLC testing and the structural evolution after redox cycling were systematically investigated. In addition, kinetic study via a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) method was also performed on the recycled oxygen carrier to understand the reduction mechanism. The results show that the iron-rich copper ore OC can oxidize methane with very high selectivity (CO2 selectivity > 95%), conversion (CH4 conversion = 80%) and stability in the successive CLC process. No obvious sintering is observed after 30 redox cycling. This can be attributed to the enhanced diffusion of different components (Cu, Fe, Si and Al) in the redox process, which could improve the interaction between the active components (CuFe2O4 and CuO) and the support components (SiO2 and Al2O3). The kinetic study shows that a nucleation-growth model and a diffusion-controlled model can be successfully adapted to depict the reduction of CuO and Fe2O3 in the copper ore OC, respectively. The activation energies for CuO and Fe2O3 reductions are 56.49 and 109.56 kJ/mol, respectively, which are similar with that for the synthetic CuO-based or CuFe2O4-based OCs. This work fully demonstrates the feasibility of using iron-rich copper concentrate as a lower cost OC for the CLC system. (C) 2019 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, in heterogeneous water oxidation, atomistic understanding of this four-electron reaction is still elusive. In particular, the mechanism of O-O bond formation, the coupled transfer of proton and electron, and the hopping of high-valent metal-oxo intermediates are challenging issues. To date, binding energy related descriptors have been used successfully to predict the catalytic activities by matching the experimental data and quantitatively comparing the performances. In this Perspective, we attempt to emphasize the significance of entropic contribution, like enthalpy, by highlighting recent literature and calculating the entropy from the available data. We envision that this Perspective can suggest a new research direction toward the catalyst design to control the entropy during water oxidation and be technologically useful for characterizing the temperature effects.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			2380-8195			WOS:000480672800016

The composite electrodes possess 8.79 at% cerium content, which is 12 times than the Ce-doped PbO2 electrodes (0.7 at%). The electrochemical measurements show that PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes possess higher oxygen evolution overpotential (1.98 V vs. SCE) than PbO2 electrodes (1.51 V vs. SCE) and Ce-doped PbO2 electrodes (1.77 V vs. SCE). The service life of PbO2-CeO2 nanocomposite electrodes is 135 h, which is 1.8 times longer than that of Ce-doped PbO2 electrodes.

However, the majority only respond to a limited wavelength region (lambda < 460 nm) and exhibit fast charge recombination. Our density-functional theory (DFT) calculations have identified an oxygen-doped polymeric carbon nitride structure with heptazine chains linked both by oxygen atoms and by nitrogen species, which results in a reduced band gap and efficient charge separation. A novel synthetic method has then been developed to control both surface hydrophilicity and more importantly, the linker species in a polymer, which highly influences the band gap and charge separation. As such, the synthesized polymer can be excited from UV via visible to even near-IR (lambda = 800 nm) wavelengths, resulting in a 25 times higher H2 evolution rate (HER) than the previous benchmark polymeric g-C3N4 (lambda > 420 nm), with an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 10.3% at 420 nm and 2.1% at 500 nm, measured under ambient conditions, which is closer to the real environment (instead of vacuum conditions). The strategy used here thus paves a new avenue to dramatically tune both the light absorption and charge separation to increase the activity of polymeric photocatalysts.									175	7	0	0	27	0	175			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000405279900012

It also functions in a few extremely important oxygen-atom transfer reactions at low redox potential. This review poses the question "Why does life depend upon molybdenum?" The answer has to be based upon the availability of the element and on chemical superiority in carrying out the essential tasks. We illustrate here the peculiarities of molybdenum chemistry and how they have become part of certain enzymes. The uptake and incorporation of molybdenum are dependent on its availability, selective pumps, and carriers (chaperones), but 4.5 x 109 years ago molybdenum was not available when both tungsten and vanadium or even iron were possibly used in its place. While these possibilities are explored, they leave many unanswered questions concerning the selection today of molybdenum.

Rotating-disk electrode measurements at ink-cast films of carbon + MnOx show that both MnOx nanoarchitectures exhibit comparable intrinsic ORR activity for four-electron reduction with a low onset overpotential (similar to 310 mV). The MnOx xerogel and aerogel powders were also incorporated into practical powder-composite electrodes that include carbon and polymer binder. When evaluated in an air-breathing three-electrode electroanalytical cell, the aerogel-based composite electrode exhibits an overpotential lowered by similar to 50 mV compared to the xerogel-based analog. The superior performance of the aerogel-based composite is also demonstrated in zinc-air button cells, with up to 100 mV improvement in discharge voltage at moderate-to-challenging current densities (5-125 mA cm(-2)). We ascribe the enhanced activity of the MnOx aerogel-based composite to a more uniform dispersion of the aerogel powder within the carbon/binder matrix, as verified by focused-ion beam-scanning electron microscopy and elemental mapping. The results reported herein highlight the importance of assessing the translation of electrocatalytic activity from fundamental measurements to technologically relevent electrode structures.

One challenge in photocatalytic systems is to promote an effective separation of charges and reduce charge recombination to enhance overall performance of the photocatalytic system. In the present work, MoS2-TiO2-reduced graphene oxide (MTG) and CeO2-Ce2Ti3O8.7-TiO2-reduced graphene oxide (CTG) composites were synthesized through hydrothermal route using a KOH pretreatment on the TiO2 nanoparticles before Mo or Ce incorporation, in order to increase reactivity and defects such as oxygen vacancies. The structural analysis done by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy reveals the formation of KTi8O16.5 traces, TiO2 and rGO in MTG as well as rGO, CeO2, Ce2Ti3O8.7 and TiO2 phases in CTG. From high resolution transmission electron micrographs, the composite phases were identified. In MTG, well defined graphene, TiO2 and MoS2 phases were observed. In CTG, CeO2 nanoparticles nucleated onto Ce2Ti3O8.7. XPS analysis reveals the presence of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ in TiO2 both in CTG and MTG, Mo2+ and Mo4+ in MTG, and Ce4+ and Ce3+ in CTG, respectively. From optical absorption, band gap of 3.3 eV and 3.4 eV was found for CTG and MTG respectively. CTG shows an extended absorption tail that would arise from Ce3+ induced defects within the band gap. Photoluminescence confirmed the presence of MoS2 and defect states both in MTG and CTG. From the structural, chemical and optical data, electronic band diagrams are proposed to explain the mechanisms of H-2 evolution in the composites. The homojunction due to the presence of rutile and anatase in the commercial TiO2 nanoparticles im-proves charge separation in TiO2. The oxygen vacancies in Ce2Ti3O8.7 and Ti3+ in TiO2 as well as the sulphur vacancies in MoS2 create interband defect states below conduction bands of the respective semiconductors that trap the photoelectron, which leads to prolonging the lifetime of charge carriers, resulting in reduced charge recombination. The presence of defect states in the TiO2-Ce2Ti3O8.7-CeO2 interfaces create extended absorption below the TiO2 bandgap. The presence of the graphene boosted charge transport in composites and acted as a co-catalyst to photogenerate the H-2, presumably because the work function value of rGO with respect to that of H-2 evolution reaction as well as to its electron donor character. Observed H-2 evolution rates in MTG and CTG were 363.83 mu molg-1h-1and 355.9 mu molg(-1)h(-1)respectively, under 254 nm illumination. The photocatalytic activity of the CTG composite was reported for the first time. The KOH pretreatment on TiO2 nanoparticles effectively increased the H-2-photogeneration with respect to previous reports.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000552273700011

The electronic structure calculations show that the band gap is modified in the SrTiO3 nanowires compared with that of the bulk. For TiO2-terminated nanowires, the mid-band states induced by the combination of oxygen and strontium atoms on the surface lead to a shift in the valence band toward the conduction band without interference from the edge of the conduction band, which reduces the band gap. On the contrary, the electronic states induced by the combination of oxygen and strontium atoms on the surface of SrO-terminated nanowires lead to a shift in the conduction band toward the valence band. The calculated optical results indicate that the absorption edge of the nanowires shift towards the red-light region. These theoretical results suggest that perovskite SrTiO3 nanowires are promising candidates for use in visible light photocatalytic processes such as solar-assisted water splitting reactions.

Methylated melamine grafted poly vinyl benzyl chloride (mm-qPVBz/Cl-) was synthesized and cast as the membrane. The conductivity of this hydroxide ion exchange membrane increased from 1.6 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) to 2.7 x 10(-2-) S cm(-1) when the temperature was increased from 25 degrees C to 60 degrees C. Membranes were examined using TEM. The oxygen evolution catalyst used was based on Cu0.7Co2.3O4 particle 20-30 nm in size, synthesized through a thermal decomposition method. A membrane electrode assembly was prepared with the resultant membrane as electrolyte, the Cu0.7Co2.3O4 nano-particles as the anode catalyst and Ni nano-powders as the hydrogen evolution catalyst. SEM observations showed that the catalysts were well dispersed on the electrodes. The polarization curves exhibited onset voltages for water electrolysis of around 1.5 V. The MEA polarisation in deionised water exhibited voltages of 2.19 V, 2.05 V, 1.99 V at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at temperatures of 25 degrees C, 40 degrees C and 55 degrees C respectively.

Results obtained from pure water (water-splitting conditions) showed that evolution of H-2 in the gas phase is accompanied by production of peroxide species on the photocatalyst surface and H2O2 in solution. Two kinetically distinguishable reaction pathways of peroxide formation were observed, one prevailing at low irradiation times (Route I) and another dominating after prolonged exposure to light (Route II). It is proposed that Route I involves oxidation of surface hydroxyl groups by photogenerated holes and subsequent dimerization of the so-formed hydroxyl radicals, whereas Route ll proceeds via consecutive reduction of surface-trapped photogenerated oxygen by conduction band electrons. The rate of H-2 production increases significantly in the presence of glycerol in solution due to efficient scavenging of photogenerated holes/hydroxyl radicals. This is accompanied by a substantial increase of the initial rate of peroxide formation, possibly due to an enhancement of the rate of the oxygen reduction pathway (Route II). Under all experimental conditions employed, the total amount of peroxide species bound to the photocatalyst surface was found to reach a steady-state coverage of ca. 260 mu mol g(-1) (3.8 molecules nm(-2)).

Microkinetic models were formulated to obtain the HER kinetic information for individual Au and Pt NEs. We found that the rate-determining steps for the HER at Au and Pt NEs were the Volmer step and the Heyrovsky step, respectively. More interestingly, the standard rate constant (k(0)) of the rate-determining step was found to vary over 2 orders of magnitude for the same type of NEs. The observed variations indicate the HER activity heterogeneity at the nanoscale. Furthermore, we discovered a linear relationship between bubble formation potential (E-bubble) and log(k(0)) with a slope of 125 mV/decade for both Au and Pt NEs. As log (k(0)) increases, E-bubble shifts linearly to more positive potentials, meaning NEs with higher HER activities form H-2 bubbles at less negative potentials. Our theoretical model suggests that such linear relationship is caused by the similar critical bubble formation condition for Au and Pt NEs with varied sizes. Our results have potential implications for using gas bubble formation to evaluate the HER activity distribution of nanoparticles in an ensemble.									25	1	0	0	1	0	26			0743-7463			WOS:000430512400014	29569923

We herein report preparation of g-C3N4-MoS2 hybrid by pyrolysis of affordable melamine and (NH4)(2)MoS4 in molten LiCl-NaCl-KCl at 550 degrees C. Molten salts are confirmed as ideal reaction media for formation of homogeneous hybrid. Characterizations suggest a strong interaction between g-C3N4 and MoS2 in the hybrid, which results in an enhanced visible-light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen generation of the hybrid with an optimal g-C3N4/MoS2 ratio.

However, it is quite difficult for a general photocatalyst to realize the crucial functions. In this study, the above idea was easily realized via a coupling strategy of crystal-facet engineering and spatially separated cocatalyst modification, namely, a TiO2 single-crystal photocatalyst with spatially separated Ag and F- bi-cocatalysts (Ag/F-TiO2). In this case, the F ions (as a hole cocatalyst) and Ag nanoparticles (as an electron cocatalyst) were selectively modified on the hole-rich (001) and electron-rich (101) facets of TiO2 single crystals, respectively. Photocatalytic results demonstrated that the resultant spatially separated Ag/F-TiO2 photocatalyst exhibited an obviously higher photocatalytic performance than pure TiO2, single-cocatalyst modified TiO2 (F-TiO2 and Ag/TiO2) and randomly Ag-deposited TiO2 (Ag/F-TiO2(R)). The main reason for the enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the excellent synergistic effect of orientation transfer of photogenerated charges and their rapid interfacial reaction via the efficient coupling strategy of crystal-facet engineering and cocatalyst modification, namely, the TiO2 single crystal structure can self-induce the orientation transfer of photogenerated charges to different crystal facets, while the spatially separated cocatalysts function as the effective active sites for the rapid interfacial catalytic reactions of those spatially separated charges (Ag nanoparticles on the (101) facets work as the active centres for oxygen-reduction reactions, and F ions on the (001) facets serve as the active sites for oxidation reactions of organic substances). The present coupling strategy of crystal-facet engineering and cocatalyst modification may also provide new ideas for the design and preparation of other highly efficient semiconductor photocatalysts.									140	11	0	0	12	0	142			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000378583200021

In this paper, the ablation mechanism of C/SiC composites and their modified composites under laser irradiation was studied. ZrB2-MoSi2-SiC ternary-phase ceramic was successfully coated on C/SiC composites by using high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) technology, with Mo as transition layer. The evolution of phase and morphology of the composites was investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The ablation behavior of composites was investigated by laser confocal microscopy (LCM). The results showed that the ablation mechanism of composites was controlled by phase transformation, thermal reaction and thermal diffusion. The solid-liquid transition of ZrB2 and MoSi2 was the dominant factor. Thermal reaction and good thermal diffusivity of coatings were also important factors affecting the ablation performance. ZrB2-SiC-MoSi2/Mo coating failed when all phase transitions were completed and no continuous liquid phase was formed, followed by rapid damage of C/SiC substrate. The results of this work can provide theoretical guidance and research ideas for the design and application of laser protective materials.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000537570200067

Based on the importance of establishing new experimental models, the present investigation evaluated the modulation of APPs following inflammatory stimulus by the inoculation of Aeromonas hydrophila in tilapias. Fish were sampled 6 and 24 hours post-infection. Tilapias presented increase of positive APPs such as ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, alpha-2-macroglobulin and complement C3, as well as decrease of negative APPs such as albumin and transferrin. The protein response of tilapias during the course of bacterial infection showed correlation with the kinetics of cellular accumulation in the inflamed focus with significant increase of granulocytes, thrombocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages. However, granulocytes were the predominant cells, associated with increment in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Showing responses similar to those observed in humans, the modulation of APPs and the kinetics of cellular accumulation in the exudate demonstrate the feasibility of this alternative experimental model for advances and studies to understand changes in pathophysiological mechanisms of acute inflammatory reaction due to bacterial infection.									38	0	0	0	29	0	38			2045-2322			WOS:000461418200013	30886242

During the simulation, the surrounding interspace around the Mn4O5Ca cluster was filled with numerous water molecules. The traffic of water molecules in the bidirectional pathway between the Mn4O5Ca cluster and outside of PSII is investigated by analyzing MD trajectories. The result of this simulation suggests that water delivery to the Mn4O5Ca cluster in PSII is driven by self-diffusion of water molecules coupled with the synchronized motion of the residues surrounding the Mn4O5Ca cluster. By tracing these water molecules, we find that the water molecules predominantly take five water pathways to enter into and leave from PSII. In these pathways, the water molecules move being strongly affected by the structure and dynamics of PSII. Nevertheless, the directions of each water molecule in these pathways are nearly random. In contrast, the principal component analysis for C alpha atoms in the PSII complex revealed that the residues surrounding the OEC showed the collective and continuing motion. In an attempt to assess the validity, the MD simulation of the D1-D61A mutant is performed, comparing the distribution of water molecules near the Mn4O5Ca cluster. The results show that the change in the water distribution by the D1-D61A mutant is responsible for the experimentally observed decrease in the activLity of PSII. The details of the pathways for water delivery provide important information about the water-splitting reaction.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000479326100007	31268711

Phylogenetic analyses indicate that there are three classes of bona fide RubisCO proteins, forms I, II and III, which all catalyse the same reactions. In addition, there exists another form of RubisCO, form IV, which does not catalyse RuBP carboxylation or oxygenation. Form IV is actually a homologue of RubisCO and is called the RubisCO-like protein (RLP). Both RubisCO and RLP appear to have evolved from an ancestor protein in a methanogenic archaeon, and comprehensive analyses indicate that the different forms ( I, II, III and IV) contain various subgroups, with individual sequences derived from representatives of all three kingdoms of life. The diversity of RubisCO molecules, many of which function in distinct milieus, has provided convenient model systems to study the ways in which the active site of this protein has evolved to accommodate necessary molecular adaptations. Such studies have proven useful to help provide a framework for understanding the molecular basis for many important aspects of RubisCO catalysis, including the elucidation of factors or functional groups that impinge on RubisCO carbon dioxide/oxygen substrate discrimination.									110	1	0	0	97	0	110			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000257571100002	18487131

Two compositions were obtained using SiC powders and different contents of AlN-Y2O3. The powders were mixed/homogeneizated and subsequently dried and deagglomerated. Powder mixtures were compacted by cold isostatic pressing. Samples were sintered at 2080 degrees C, for 1h, under 0.2 MPa-N-2 atmosphere. Sintered samples were characterized by X-Ray diffraction and density. The oxidation behavior was investigated and related to the densification and additive-content. Samples were submitted to the tests at 1200, 1300 or 1400 degrees C, in air for 120 hours. Weight gain of the samples is plotted as function of the exposure time, obtaining the evolution of the oxidation on the surface of the samples. Based on the results, the parabolic oxidation content (k(p)) and activation energy were determined. The results indicate that the samples present parabolic behavior in all conditions. The activation energy results indicate that the phenomena of diffusion of oxygen ions into the oxide layer and interfacial reactions between oxide layer and intergranular phase are the responsible for oxidation mechanism.					6th International Latin American Conference on Power Technology6th International Latin American Conference on Power Technology	NOV 07-10, 2007NOV 07-10, 2007	Inst Pesquisas Energet Nucl; Metallum Eventos Tecn CientifInst Pesquisas Energet Nucl; Metallum Eventos Tecn Cientif	Assoc Brasileira Ceram, Buzios, BRAZILAssoc Brasileira Ceram, Buzios, BRAZIL	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0255-5476		*****************	WOS:000262481100105

However, LRLO cathodes also evolve reactive oxygen species on charge, especially in the first formation cycles, which leads to reactivity with the electrolyte at the surface, reconstruction of surface layers, and deleterious impedance growth. Here, a strategy to enhance the cycle performance of a Li-rich Mn-rich layered cathode is demonstrated by scavenging the evolved oxygen species with a polydopamine (PDA) surface coating. PDA, a well-known oxygen radical scavenger, provides a chemically protective layer that diminishes not only the growth of the undesirable cathode electrolyte interphase but also results in less oxygen gas release compared to an unprotected surface, and significantly suppressed phase transformation at the surface. These factors lead to improved rate capability and diminished capacity fading on cycling; namely a capacity fade of 82% over 200 cycles at a C rate for the PDA-coated LRLO, compared to 70% for the bare LRLO material.									27	1	0	0	2	0	26			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000666870700001

CH* chemiluminescence is a significant radical species in flame spectral diagnostics, and blackbody radiation can reflect the spatial distribution of solid particles produced in flame. A fiber-optic spectrometer and a CCD camera coupled with multiple bandpass filters are used to obtain the spectral emission lines and two-dimensional spectral distributions, respectively. The results show that CH* emission peak at 431 nm and continuous blackbody radiation can be detected in CWS flames. The differences of spectral distributions between diesel and CWS impinging flame are analyzed. Impinging zone is the core chemical reaction region, and solid particles are also concentrated in impinging zone, indicating that four-burner impinging can well restrict the reactants and flames in the impinging zone, thereby greatly reduce the damage to the refractory walls. Moreover, according to the time-averaged distributions, the intensity and area of CH* emission and blackbody radiation are enhanced with the increase of oxygen and carbon molar ratio (O/C), demonstrating that improving O-2 velocity promotes the chemical reactions, and flame temperature plays more dominant role than solid particle quantity in blackbody radiation. The time-dependent blackbody radiation evolution presents periodical change. Besides, it is found that O/C or syngas concentration can be feasibly estimated using CH* chemiluminescence in OMB gasifier.									5	2	0	0	0	0	6			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000413449600068

In this work, we employ density functional theory with the inclusion of the on-site Coulomb interaction (DFT + U) to investigate the structure evolution of small-sized gold (Au, Au-4, Au-8 and Au-12) clusters on four types of reduced CeO2-X(111) surfaces: SSV (single surface oxygen vacancy), LSVT (linear surface oxygen vacancy trimer), dLSVC (double linear surface oxygen vacancy with a surface vacancy dimer and a subsurface vacancy), and TSVT (triangular surface oxygen vacancy trimer). Our results indicate that the relative stabilities of multilayer (3D) structures are strengthened gradually compared with the monolayer (2D) structures with increasing the number of gold atoms. In addition, the 2D-3D structure transition occurs on the size order of Au-2D -> 3D@TSVT > Au-2D -> 3D@dLSVC similar to Au-2D -> 3D@LSVT > Au-2D -> 3D@SSV, which is determined by the charge transfer magnitude between the CeO2 surfaces and gold clusters. Meanwhile, two competitive nucleation patterns are observed, fcc-like nucleation and hcp-like nucleation, which highly affect the morphology of supported gold clusters. Further site-by-site investigations indicate that the coordination number and the charges of Au atoms are the dominant factors to influence the adsorption strength of CO and O-2, and the interface plays a relatively minor role. These findings not only enrich our knowledge of the relationship between surface defects, gold cluster structures and small molecule adsorptions, but also provide a theoretical perspective to help design the optimal Au/CeO2 systems possessing high catalytic efficiency.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000346919200033	25407915

We showed previously that the 30-kDa protein accumulates in the membrane later than the reaction center-binding D1 protein (Mizobuchi and Yamamoto 1989). In the present study, the rate of accumulation of the apoproteins of LHC and CP43/47 was shown to be similar to that of the D1 protein. By contrast, we found by nondenaturing lithium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that, at the early stages of greening, newly assembled antenna Chl a-binding proteins CP43 and CP47 were more susceptible to detergent than were the other Chl-protein complexes. Prolonged illumination was required for the stabilization of CP43 and CP47, and the time course of the light-dependent formation of stable CP43/47 paralleled that of the accumulation of the extrinsic 30-kDa protein. These results are discussed in terms of the relationship between the stabilization of CP43/47 and the accumulation of the 30-kDa protein in the thylakoid membrane and the roles of these two processes in the assembly of the oxygen-evolving system in Euglena are examined.									11	0	0	0	11	0	11			0032-0781			WOS:A1991GF22200018

Further copper loading was done using copper nitrate by wet impregnation method. Formation of uniformly Cu-decorated TiO2-B:Cu-NWs was evident in TEM micrographs. Starting from commercial TiO2-NPs, systematic evolution of TiO2-B, R-TiO2-B and R-TiO2-B:Cu NW-structures in steps, identified a gradual narrowing of the band gap from 3.23 eV to 2.22 eV. Generation of Ti3+ defect-states and oxygen-vacancy (O-v) could efficiently suppress charge-recombination, improve interfacial charge-transfer, enhance visible-light adsorption and provide plentiful photocatalytic reaction active sites; hence, enormously promising as efficient photocatalytic material.

The Co-Fe nanostructures are characterized by homogeneous pore distribution. The electrocatalytic activity of the produced nanomaterials was determined in 1 M NaOH using the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronopotentiometry (CP) methods.

The critical and highly uncertain rate for the reaction C-12(alpha, gamma) O-16 has been varied over a range from 0.5 to 3.0 times that given by Caughlan and Fowler and two different prescriptions for semiconvection have been explored. The nucleosynthesis resulting from integrating the yields of these models over plausible initial stellar mass distributions is found to be in excellent agreement with the observed solar abundances of virtually all the intermediate mass isotopes (16 less-than-or-equal-to A less-than-or-equal-to 32) if, and only if, the rate of the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction is taken to be 1.7+/-0.5 times that given by Caughlan and Fowler. This range is a small subset of what is allowed by current experimental measurements and can be taken as a nucleosynthetic ''prediction'' of the value that this rate needs to have in order to prevent 5- to 100-fold deviations from the observed relative abundances of key isotopes. These results are insensitive to the assumed slope of the initial stellar mass distribution within observational limits, and relatively insensitive to the theory of semiconvection (except for the apparent excessive production of O-18 when semiconvective mixing is suppressed). Three of the stars have been followed through simulated explosions to obtain the explosive modifications to their nucleosynthesis (including the ''neutrino process''), which for most isotopes is relatively small. Isotopic yields of both stable and radioactive products are tabulated as are the calculated iron core masses of the presupernova stars.									359	8	1	0	1	0	365			0370-1573			WOS:A1993LH20600008

Towards a New Perspective on the Efficiency of Water Electrolysis								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				163	11			F3197	F3208		10.1149/2.0271611jes				2016	2016	Water electrolysis is a promising technology for enabling the storage of surplus electricity produced by intermittent renewable power sources in the form of hydrogen. At the core of this technology is the electrolyte, and whether this is acidic or alkaline affects the reaction mechanisms, gas purities and is of significant importance for the stability and activity of the electrocatalysts. This article presents a simple but precise physical model to describe the voltage-current characteristic, heat balance, gas crossover and cell efficiency of water electrolyzers. State-of-the-art water electrolysis cells with acidic and alkaline electrolyte are experimentally characterized in order to parameterize the model. A rigorous comparison shows that alkaline water electrolyzers with Ni-based catalysts but thinner separators than those typically used is expected be more efficient than acidic water electrolysis with Ir and Pt based catalysts. This performance difference was attributed mainly to a similar conductivity but approximately 38-fold higher diffusivities of hydrogen and oxygen in the acidic polymer electrolyte membrane (Nafion) than those in the alkaline separator (Zirfon filled with a 30 wt% KOH solution). With reference to the detailed analysis of the cell characteristics, perspectives for the improvement of the efficiency of water electrolyzers are discussed. (C) The Author(s) 2016. Published by ECS.

Reversible Control of the Mn Oxidation State in SrTiO3 Bulk Powders								FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY				7						353	10.3389/fchem.2019.00353				MAY 22 2019	2019	We demonstrate a low-temperature reduction method for exhibiting fine control over the oxidation state of substitutional Mn ions in strontium titanate (SrTiO3) bulk powder. We employ NaBH4 as the chemical reductant that causes significant changes in the oxidation state and oxygen vacancy complexation with Mn2+ dopants at temperatures < 350 degrees C where lattice reduction is negligible. At higher reduction temperatures, we also observe the formation of Ti3+ in the lattice by diffuse-reflectance and low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. In addition to Mn2+, Mn4+, and the Mn2+ complex with an oxygen vacancy, we also observe a sharp resonance in the EPR spectrum of heavily reduced Mn-doped SrTiO3. This sharp signal is tentatively assigned to surface superoxide ion that is formed by the surface electron transfer reaction between Ti3+ and O-2. The ability to control the relative amounts of various paramagnetic defects in SrTiO3 provides many possibilities to study in a model system the impact of tunable dopant-defect interactions for spin-based electronic applications or visible-light photocatalysis.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2296-2646			WOS:000468728600001	31179268

Owing to their self-assembly properties with various molecular interactions, peptides play an essential role in the controlled synthesis of noble metal-based catalysts with high surface area. In this work, a phenylalanine (F) and tyrosine (Y) based peptide bolaamphiphile is prepared by solution-phase peptide synthesis. The peptide bolaamphiphile readily self-assembles into a hydrogel with a cross-linked nanofibrillar network. The platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) are in situ generated within the cross-linked nanofibrillar network of the hydrogel matrix of the peptide bolaamphiphile. Benefiting from the synergistic properties of the Pt nanoparticles doped on three-dimensional fibrous networks, Pt6@hydrogel shows efficient catalytic activity for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The Pt6@hydrogel requires an overpotential of 45 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1). The Pt6@hydrogel also shows electrocatalytic activity in basic and neutral pH solutions. The excellent activity and stability of Pt6@hydrogel for the HER shows great potential for energy conversion applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2516-0230			WOS:000703650000001	36132646

Numerous synthetic methods have been developed, but mild synthesis conditions and fast polymerization rate are highly desired. Herein, high porous POPs with high surface areas from aromatic vinyl monomers by using acid catalysis method is reported. The polymerization is ultrafast and could be accomplished even in 5 min at room temperature. Furthermore, the surface area can be tuned by using various acid catalysts and controlling the reaction time. Due to the high surface area, these POPs show promising adsorption of carbon dioxide and hydrogen, respectively. Furthermore, the large pi-system of the building block and high surface area of the POPs also make them show potential applications in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution as well as promising catalyst support for metal nanoparticles.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1022-1336	1521-3927		WOS:000481838600007	31206971

We derive the theoretical expressions for the OH* brightness and rotational temperature (T*) responses to high-frequency atmospheric temperature perturbations. The theory is used to calculate the 1-D and 2-D horizontal wave number spectra of the OH* and T* image fluctuations induced by atmospheric turbulence. By applying the theory to images of a breaking gravity wave packet, acquired by the Utah State University Advanced Mesospheric Temperature Mapper, we show that existing infrared OH* imager technology can observe the evolution of gravity wave breakdown and characterize the resulting turbulent eddies in the source region and in the inertial subrange of the turbulence spectrum. For the example presented here, the RMS OH* brightness fluctuations induced by the gravity wave packet was 2.90% and by the associated turbulence was 1.07%. Unfortunately, the T* fluctuations induced by turbulence are usually too small to be observed in the OH* rotational temperature maps.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2169-897X	2169-8996		WOS:000394520300006

These winds are a major source of replenishment of the interstellar gas and dust, so they furnish a large part of the raw materials for new generations of stars and planets. The chemistry of the circumstellar envelope depends strongly on the photospheric abundances of the elements, especially C and O. If C/O > 1, a rich organic chemistry is observable in the microwave and mm-wavelength emission lines of the reactions products. This paper reviews the observational evidence for the presence of organic molecules and their formation pathways in circumstellar envelopes, with special emphasis on rotational spectra at microwave and millimeter wavelengths.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0273-1177			MEDLINE:11539242	11539242

Constructing heterostructures with interfacial interactions is an effective strategy to improve the catalytic performance for large-current-density HER. Herein, we innovatively present a facile two-step electrodeposition method to immobilize a hierarchical NiCoP/NiCoSx heterostructure on Ni foam (NF) for alkaline HER. The strong interfacial coupling effect between NiCoP and NiCoSx not only offers abundant active sites for fast electrochemical reaction, but also enhances the charge transfer ability accompanied by high electrical conductivity. Consequently, the obtained self-supporting NiCoP/NiCoSx/NF exhibits an excellent catalytic performance with low overpotentials of 68, 144 and 222 mV to deliver current densities of 10, 100 and 500 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, along with good stability for more than 110 h, outperforming most of the reported non-noble metal based HER catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) results further confirm that this bimetal phosphide/sulfide heterostructure can synergistically optimize the Gibbs free energy of H* during the HER process, thus accelerating the HER reaction kinetics. This work provides a new strategy toward the rational design of large-current-density electrocatalysts, which have great potential in practical large-scale hydrogen production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000866875700001	36227106

Some characteristic features of plasma jets were discussed with an emphasis on the temporal evolution of discharge current and light emission. The electrical and optical characteristics of the jet exhibited quite a strong dependence on the pulse width and oxygen gas admixture. We investigated the effects of the pulse width and oxygen admixture on the production of reactive species in gas and liquid phases. The concentrations of reactive species were measured at the plasma-liquid surface and inside the plasma-treated liquids using ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, the chemical probe method, and UV-VIS spectrophotometry. In the range of pulse widths of 1.5-5.5 mu s, the 3.5 mu s case was observed to exhibit higher values in discharge current and optical emission intensity. The OH densities estimated at the plasma-liquid interface and inside the plasma-treated liquid were observed to vary with the pulse width, and it exhibited a similar trend of change to those of discharge current, optical emission intensity, and the concentrations of the long-living reactive species, H2O2 and NO3-, in the plasma-treated liquids. Around the oxygen admixture of 10SCCM (=1% vol. %), the discharge current and wavelength-integrated optical intensity were maximal, but the estimated OH density inside the plasma-treated liquid exhibits a slight rise with the increasing oxygen admixture, reaching the highest at 20 SCCM, and then decreases slightly.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1070-664X	1089-7674		WOS:000470877600065

Hence, based on first-principles calculations, we predict that Sc2CF2/Janus MoSSe can be used as a Z-scheme heterostructure for efficient photocatalytic water splitting. The research shows that the traditional type-II to direct Z-scheme heterostructure conversion can be realized through different stacking methods of Sc2CF2 and Janus MoSSe. Through the built-in electric field and band bending theory, the transition path of photogenerated carriers is analyzed, which reveals the completely different photocatalytic mechanism of type-II and direct Z-scheme heterostructure. Surprisingly, the direct Z-scheme heterostructure displays a high overpotential of the hydrogen evolution reaction (chi(H2) = 1.01 eV) and the oxygen evolution reaction (chi(O2) = 1.46 eV) compared with the type II heterostructure. More importantly, the direct Z-scheme heterostructure has an ultra-high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency (36.1%), which breaks through the limitation of traditional theoretical efficiency and reveals a tremendous prospect of commercial application. Furthermore, the calculation of free energy confirms that the water splitting reaction on the direct Z-scheme heterostructure occur spontaneously under the external potential, but not for type-II heterostructure. Finally, introducing the additional electronic conductor (N-doped graphene) can accelerate the electron (hole) transfer and interlayer carrier recombination, which will further improve the photocatalytic performance of Z-scheme heterostructure. These distinctive features make Sc2CF2/Janus MoSSe heterostructure as promising Z-scheme photocatalyst for water splitting. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms of their photolytic and photocatalytic reactions under UV-A irradiation are still fully undisclosed, particularly, at different pH values under aerobic and inert atmospheres. Herein, we have studied the photolytic decomposition of nitrite ions under different conditions using 365 nm UV-A LED as a light source instead of mercury lamps that emit photons in the UV-B region and generate a lot of heat. The results indicated that the rate of nitrite disproportionation in the dark at pH <= 3.0 is remarkably high relative to the rate of the photolytic decomposition. At pH > 3, the photolytic reaction is negligible and nitrite ions showed considerable stability. In contrast, the photocatalytic oxidation of nitrite ions over TiO2 photocatalysts, namely, TiO(2)P25, TiO(2)UV100, and TiO2 anatase/brookite mixture proceeds at pH > 3.0. TiO2 P25 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity at pH 5. Interestingly, the photolytic simultaneous removal of nitrite ions and ammonia was possible at pH 9.0 in the absence of oxygen (Ar atmosphere). A 42.69 +/- 0.66%, 27.75 +/- 1.7%, and 32.74 +/- 0.59% of nitrogen calculated based on nitrite, ammonia, and both of them, respectively, can be removed after 6 h of UV-A irradiation. The selectivity of N-2 evolution was 77.6%. The nitrogen removal rate was significantly reduced in the presence of TiO2 photocatalyst evincing that TiO2 photocatalysis is applicable for nitrite ions oxidation, whereas the photolytic process is better suited for the simultaneous removal of nitrite ions and ammonia.[GRAPHICS].									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1474-905X	1474-9092		WOS:000838478200001	35947301

Synchrotron radiation based techniques have been used to identify the composition of the catalyst indicating the presence of FeOOH and NiOOH (FeNiOOH). The enhanced performance can be attributed to the better oxidation evolution reaction kinetics with the FeNiOOH cocatalyst. The FeNiOOH-decorated hematite is very stable for a long time. Moreover, the cocatalyst can be well coupled to the Pt-modified hematite photoanode achieving a high photocurrent of 2.21 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The good catalytic properties and the facile preparation method suggest that the decoration of FeNiOOH is a favorable strategy to improve the performance of hematite.									42	2	0	0	3	0	42			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000374350600066	27029763

Herein, to gaintheoretical insights into the experimentally observed potential-dependent activity and selectivity for the CO2reduction reaction(CO2RR) on the popular single-iron-atom catalyst, we performedab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation, constrained MDsampling, and thermodynamic integration to acquire the freeenergy profiles for the proton and electron transfer processes ofCO2at different potentials. We have demonstrated that theadsorption of CO2is significantly coupled with the electrontransfer from the substrate while the further protonation does notshow distinct charge variation. This strongly suggests that CO2adsorption is potential-dependent and optimizing the electrodepotential is vital to achieve the efficient activated adsorption of CO2. We further identified a linear scaling relationship between thereaction free energy (Delta G) and the potential for key elementary steps of CO2RR and HER, of which the slope is adsorbate-specificand not as simple as 1 eV per volt as suggested by the traditional computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model. The derivedscaling relationship can reproduce the experimental onset potential (Uonset)ofCO2RR, potential of the maximal CO2-to-CO Faradayefficiency (FECO), and potential where FECO=FEH2. This suggests that our state-of-the-art model could precisely interpret theactivity and selectivity of CO2RR/HER on the Fe-N4-C catalyst under different electrode potentials. In general, our study not onlyprovides an innovative insight into the theoretical explanation of the origin of the solvation effect from the perspective of chargetransfer but also emphasizes the critical role of electrode potential in the theoretical consideration of catalytic activity, which offers aprofound understanding of the electrochemical environment and bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimentalresults									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000810516000031

MXene nanosheets could not only effectively buffer the serious volume change of Bi2.88Fe5O12-x nano particles but also facilitate fast electron transfer as a flexible, well-conductive but robust substrate in the fast charge/discharge processes. Owing to the three-dimensional distinct structure and the strong synergistic effects between MXene and Bi2.88Fe5O12-x nanoparticles, the obtained composite exhibits impressive electrochemical performances. The composite electrode possesses high gravimetric specific capacity of 176 mAh g(-1) with ultrahigh volumetric specific capacity of 476 mAh cm(-3) at 0.5 A g(-1) in an aqueous electrolyte, superior to those of the so-far reported Bi2O3-based electrode materials. In addition, our fabricated asymmetric device displays a high volumetric energy density of 177 Wh L-1 and remarkable cycling performance with 93.3% retention ratio after 10,000 cycles. Moreover, the resultant MXene/Bi2.88Fe5O12-x composite presents high reversible specific capacity of 805 mAh g(-1) for Li-ion storage, corresponding to the volumetric specific capacity of 2176 mAh cm(-3).									22	2	0	0	1	0	21			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000595296400004

In addition to the low cost, IMPs have numerous interesting features such as high conductivity and chemical stability. Since, the catalytic activity of IMPs is highly dependent on the metal/phosphorous ratio, herein, we report the investigation of nickel-phosphide/carbon composites of different stoichiometries (NixPy/C) with tractable nickel phosphide phases as promising electrocatalyst for ORR under alkaline and acidic conditions. The NixPy/C composites are obtained by carbonization of a Ni-struvite NiNH4PP4 center dot H2O) coated phenol-formaldehyde resin at different temperatures, resulting in variations of the formed NiP, phases. As expected, it is found that the electrocatalytic ORR performance of the NixPy/C composites highly depends on the predominant phase of nickel phosphide formed. The highest catalytic activity for ORR in alkaline as well as acidic media was found for the NixPy/C composite with the highest proportion of Ni2P as a predominant phase, obtained at 800 degrees C. For composites with NiP2 and Ni12P5 as the predominant phase, obtained at lower and higher temperatures, respectively, a lower catalytic activity was found.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2196-0216			WOS:000438339200030

Herein, typical Fe, Ni-codoped W18O49/NF was prepared via a simple solvothermal method. The incorporation of Fe ions enhanced the electronic interaction and enlarged the electrochemically active surface area. The increased W4+ leads to a high proportion of unsaturated W=O bonds, thus enhancing the adsorption capacity of water. The valence configuration of nickel (Ni) sites in such dual-cation doping is well adjusted, realizing a high proportion of trivalent Ni ions (Ni3+). Due to the orbital interactions, the Fe3+/Ni3+ ions and OER reaction intermediates exhibit strong orbital overlap. The positions of the valence band and conduction band are well modulated. As a result, the Fe, Ni-codoped W18O49/NF shows improved electrocatalytic activity, and achieves a low decomposition voltage of 1.58 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and retains long-time stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000681722400001	34355722

However, the progress in this field is hindered by the lack of consistency of the CNTs used in the studies and sometimes insufficient materials characterization.In this study, two types of CNTs were at first characterized to reveal their chemical composition and morphology (by TEM and XPS) and then used as matrix additives in the process of electrospinning. The outcome product was evaluated for morphology (SEM), chemical composition (XPS, FTIR), course of thermal transition (STA-FTIR) and level of structural arrangement (TEM combined with SAED) to answer the question how do CNTs interact with polymer matrix and how it impacts the process of thermal transition and properties of the as-received carbon nanofibers. Highly oxidized and short CNTs were found to increase the structural arrangement, catalyzing the thermal transition, while thin and long CNTs, with low amount of oxygen, entrap the nitrogen atoms, yielding nitrogen-doped CNFs that might be suggested as high-performance oxygen reduction reaction catalysts.

Three types of metastability were observed: a) long term irreversible degradation due to oxidization processes on the film surface, b) reversible degradation determined by uncontrolled water adsorption, c) fast field switching effect in the film bulk.Oxygen and hydrogen content and its bonding configurations have been analyzed by hydrogen evolution and infrared spectroscopy methods on the films deposited on glass substrates and silicon wafers subsequently. It has been found that metastable processes close to the film surface are stronger than in the bulk. The switching effect is the fast increase of charge carrier density observed on bottom chromium contacts under a condition of air admittance. We propose this effect is associated with morphology changes during film growth and electrical field induced by adsorbed atmospheric components on the film surface.

In the present work, we investigated the impact of mercury on the polypeptide composition of PSII submembrane preparations. Electrophoretic analysis revealed that the incubation of the membranes in the presence of mercury produces the depletion of a polypeptide of molecular weight of 33 kDa. This polypeptide corresponds to the extrinsic protein EP33 of the oxygen evolving complex removed following urea treatment. However, the two closely related extrinsic polypeptides of 16 and 23 kDa, usually removed concomitantly after urea treatment, remained unaffected after the mercury treatment. These data demonstrated the existence of an intrinsic binding site for EP23. The molecular mode of action of mercury in the oxygen evolving complex of PSII is discussed.									45	0	0	0	42	0	45			0014-5793			WOS:A1995QL72300008	7883042

We further propose that the brain can use both picture-like and language-like representation processes. In our interpretation, visualization (imagery) is a special kind of representation i.e., visual imagery requires a peculiar inherent biophysical (picture-like) mechanism. We also conjecture that the evolution of higher levels of complexity made the biophysical picture representation of the external visual world possible by controlled redox and bioluminescent nonlinear (iterative) biochemical reactions in the V1 and V2 areas during visual imagery. Our proposal deals only with the primary level of visual representation (i.e. perceived "scene").									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			0219-6352	1757-448X		WOS:000288567700004	21425482

However, the complexities/difficulties in their design have largely hindered their wide-scale adoption in catalysis. Herein, with this work we report a green and new protocol for the synthesis of unsupported as well as reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-reinforced dendritic Ru nanostructures (Ru@rGO) via controlled galvanic replacement reaction with Mg as the sacrificial metal. Interestingly, experimental findings elucidate Ru@rGO as a promising electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in a wide range of pH with nearly zero onset potential and superior current density as compared with the state-of-art Pt/C catalyst in alkaline as well as acidic media. It requires only 32 and 68 mV overpotential (eta) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH and 1 M H2SO4 solution, respectively. Poisoning test conducted in the presence of thiocyanate (SCN-) elucidates the direct involvement of Ru nanostructures. Overall, the unique morphology and the interaction between Ru dendrites with rGO lead to the high HER activity. In addition to electrocatalytic superiority, Ru@rGO is found to be an effective catalyst for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (an industrial waste) to 4-aminophenol (a value-added product) indicating its bi-functionality as well as adaptive nature for different catalytic environments. This green synthesis protocol driven by the respective redox energy level positioning of Mg, rGO and Ru, as revealed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopic studies, opens up the potential to develop various mono-/bi-metallic nanodendrites for renewable energy harvesting and neutralizing the toxic chemicals in wastewater for environmental remediation.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000611678100044

While the hematite photoanode with a photocurrent threshold of 600 nm is promising for practical PEC water oxidation, it still suffers from the small minority carrier diffusion length, which makes it difficult to realize adequate light absorption and efficient charge separation concurrently. To address this issue, hematite nanorods were grown on macroporous SnO2:Sb substrates, forming a coral-like hematite (ATO-Fe2O3) photoanode. The ATO-Fe2O3 photoanode exhibited a 150 mV cathodic shift of onset relative to Fe2O3 nanorods directly on planar SnO2:F (FTO-Fe2O3). The photocurrent density reached 1.32 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, approximately 8.8 times higher than FTO-Fe2O3, and it was further increased to 1.81( )mA cm(-2) after passivation with a thin TiO2 overlayer. The improved photocurrent was attributed to the increased light harvesting, reduced charge transfer resistance (R-ct), and smaller contact area of oxygen bubble to hematite photoanode. Our research confirmed the effectiveness of macroporous ATO templated coral-like morphology on balancing the adequate light absorption and efficient charge separation issues of hematite photoanodes. This research may also be applicable to other semiconductor photoanodes for high-efficiency PEC water splitting. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

P	HAMILTON J V; MANASAS M A; FLYNN T M								Improving wear resistance of a polymeric manufactured part e.g. artificial joint involves placing parts in flexible packaging container, subjecting to vacuum and heat sealing to exert hydrostatic pressure on part and irradiating					EP1481693-A2; EP1481693-A3	DEPUY PROD INC																			NOVELTY - Improving wear resistance of a polymeric manufactured part involves placing the polymeric parts in at least one packaging container having at least one heat sealable opening; subjecting the packaging container and the polymeric parts to a vacuum force; heat sealing the container; and irradiating the heat sealed packages and the parts to sterilize the parts for a time and promote crosslinking within the polymer of the parts. USE - For improving wear resistance of a polymeric manufactured part (claimed), such as polymeric parts for biomedical engineering e.g. polymeric articles for implantation (such as during orthopedic surgery) such as artificial joints. ADVANTAGE - The method improves the wear and oxidation resistance of the polymeric parts, after the irradiation step for the sterilization, while maintaining the other mechanical properties, compared to the prior art methods. The resulting sterilized part has a gel content of 75 - 100%, thus indicating a high level of crosslinking within the polymer. The method results in a chemical environment that favor the free radicals produced due to irradiation and participating in crosslinking reactions with the adjacent polymer chains, due to the lack of oxygen available in the system for oxidation reactions. The irradiation also results in the evolution of hydrogen gas in a quantity that is proportional to the quantity of free radicals created. The creation of hydrostatic pressure or the charging of the container with an inert gas optionally with hydrogen, within the container and over the bulk material, inhibits the diffusion of hydrogen gas out of the material, which further reduces the number of free radicals present within the bulk polymer and thus reduces the potential for oxidation of the material and the chain cessation within the polymer DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Improving wear resistance of a polymeric manufactured part involves:(a) placing the polymeric parts in at least one gas impermeable, flexible packaging container having at least one heat sealable opening;(b) subjecting the packaging container and the polymeric parts to a vacuum force;(c) heat sealing the container while subjecting to vacuum force such that upon sealing the container hydrostatic pressure is exerted on the part; and(d) irradiating the heat sealed packages and the parts to sterilize the parts for a time and promote crosslinking within the polymer of the parts.															0						DIIDW:2005022468

The face-to-face g-C3N4/BiVO4 composed of two-dimensional materials of g-C3N4 and BiVO4 (010) surface, can introduce a built-in electric field, which promotes interface charge transfer and prevents the electron-hole pair recombination, and causing g-C3N4 monolayer with negative charge and BiVO4 (010) surface with positive charge. Under visible light irradiation, electrons are excited to the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the BiVO4 (010) surface undergoing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while the holes remain in the valence band maximum (VBM) of g-C3N4 monolayer aiding the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The band edge potentials of BiVO4 (010) surface is higher than that of g-C3N4 monolayer, which ensures a stronger redox reaction potential and therefore belongs to a typical Z-scheme heterostructure. In addition, the Cr or/and B (co)doping introduces the Cr-3d or/and B-2p states to reduce the bandgap and generate impurity levels, thus enhancing solar energy utilization rate and expanding the optical absorption in the visible-light range. The optical absorption intensity of the (Cr, B) codoped g-C3N4/BiVO4 is superior to pure and Cr or B doped g-C3N4/BiVO4, confiriming the synergistic effect of Cr-3d and B-2p states. Thus, this research is helpful to design a novel and potential Z-scheme photocatalyst useful for the photocatalytic water splitting. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

J	Xu, Lei; Niu, Junfeng; Xie, Hongbin; Ma, Xiao; Zhu, Yunqing; Crittenden, John								Effective degradation of aqueous carbamazepine on a novel blue-colored TiO2 nanotube arrays membrane filter anode.								Journal of hazardous materials				402				123530	123530		10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123530				2021-01-15	2021	The effective electrochemical oxidation of aqueous carbamazepine (CBZ) using a novel blue-colored TiO2 nanotube arrays (BC-TiO2NTA) membrane filter anode was studied. The BC-TiO2NTA was characterized using SEM, TEM, BET, mercury intrusion porosimetry, XPS, XRD, CV, and LSV. The BC-TiO2NTA had reserved pore structure, formed mesopores, specific and electroactive surface areas of 2.01 m2 g-1 and 9.32 cm2 cm-2, respectively. The oxygen evolution potential was 2.61 V vs. SCE. CBZ could be degraded by OH, SO4- and O2- on BC-TiO2NTA in accordance to pseudo-first-order kinetic, which was greatly enhanced in flow-through mode. The optimal kinetic rate constant of CBZ degradation of 0.403 min-1 was achieved at 3 mA cm-2, while energy consumption per order was 0.086 kW h m-3. The mineralization efficiency and mineralization current efficiency were 50.8 % and 9.5 % at 180 min, respectively. The presence of Cl- (0.3-3 mM) accelerated electrochemical degradation of CBZ, while NO3- (0.1-2 mM) inhibited the reaction. Based on density functional theory calculation and UPLC-Orbitrap-MS/MS measurement, we found that electrochemical degradation of CBZ was initialized by cleavage of -CONH2 group and attack of OH on the olefinic double bond of the central heterocyclic ring.									36	1	0	0	14	0	36				1873-3336		MEDLINE:33254736	33254736

A robust electrocatalyst can provide corrosion resistance towards the poisoning of contaminants in the electrolyzer. In this present work, N doped graphene and graphene with platinum nanoparticles (NPs) composites (RGO Pt, U-NGO Pt, and A-NGO Pt) have been studied against chloride ion poisoning on the performance of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic medium. Effect of chloride ion poisoning has been studied by adding Cl- ion ranging from 0.16 to 0.96 mM in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution. Experimental data revealed that the activated N- doped graphene oxide (by KOH at 600 degrees C) and Pt NPs composite imparts the highest Cl- corrosion resistance due to the presence of more pyridinic and pyrrolic groups in the N doped graphene-Pt composite catalyst. Electrochemical studies showed that A-NGO Pt displayed the highest exchange current density (3.20 mA cm(-2)) and it was nearly 1.3 and 7 times higher than that of RGO Pt (2.43 mA cm(-2)) and U-NGO Pt (0.46 mA cm(-2)) respectively. Tafel slope for HER was improved from 35.5 (RGO Pt) to 32.6 mV dec(-1) (A-NGO Pt), indicating that the doping of N in the graphene plays an important role in the improvement of the catalytic activity of A-NGO Pt catalyst. The impedance spectroscopy, chronoamperometry, chronopotentiometry data in presence of 0.96 mM Cl ion concentration, LSV curves, and ECSA values before after chronoamperometry for A-NGO Pt catalyst confirmed that it was a chloride ionresistant, stable and durable electrocatalyst for efficient hydrogen generation by the electrochemical water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2365-6549			WOS:000526179200021		
J	RAJ, IA								ON THE CATALYTIC ACTIVITY OF NI-MO-FE COMPOSITE SURFACE-COATINGS FOR THE HYDROGEN CATHODES IN THE INDUSTRIAL ELECTROCHEMICAL PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				59	3-4			245	252						JUL 1992	1992	Nickel-based composite surface coatings were assessed for their utility as catalytic hydrogen evolving cathodes in alkaline water electrolysers, chlor-alkali cells, chlorate cells, etc. Transition-metal-based hydrogen cathodes from metals, namely Ni, Mo, Cu, Fe, W, Co and Cr, obtained as thin electrolytic surface coatings on mild steel substrates were investigated in this laboratory Ni-Mo-Fe electrolytic ternary surface coatings had exhibited acceptable catalytic activity for the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (h.e.r.). The reduction in the hydrogen overpotential value (eta(H-2)) that could be practically realised by replacing the mild steel cathodes which are in use by convention, with the present Ni-Mo-Fe coated cathodes, amounts to 0.3 V minimum at typical industrial operation conditions, namely 300 mA cm-2 and 353 K. A critical assessment of the catalytic application of Ni-Mo-Fe composite for the h.e.r. had been carried out. The results of the range of examined conditions such as the ease of preparation of the Ni-Mo-Fe surface coatings through electrolytic codeposition technique, the microstructural features of the coatings, the X-ray diffraction data, the influence of chloride on the polarisation characteristics, the effect of synthetic seawater treatment, the susceptibility to thermochemical reactions with oxygen and the wetting agent in the PTFE binder at temperatures above 623 K and the effect of simulated application of asbestos separator on the catalytic activity of Ni-Mo-Fe composite are presented. It is proposed that this new catalytic material does meet out the stability requirements. A laboratory size unit electrolytic cell assembled with catalytic electrodes working at 1.8 V, 300 mA cm-2 in 6M KOH is described. A discussion on the possible energy saving by employing the proposed Ni-Mo-Fe catalyst for cathodes in the industrial production of hydrogen is also included.									23	2	0	0	0	0	25			0169-4332			WOS:A1992JH14600009

Effect of heat treatment on the surface chemical structure of glass: Oxygen speciation from in situ XPS analysis								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY				101	2			644	656		10.1111/jace.15245				FEB 2018	2018	Compositional changes in unleached and acid-leached soda-lime silicate surfaces were tracked with in-vacuo heating and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. Surface oxygen speciation was determined using a stoichiometry-based algorithm via elemental composition, instead of the typical O 1s peak-fitting approach. Accurate surface hydroxyl quantification is shown to require dehydration at temperatures near 200 degrees C. On the unleached surface, no change in surface hydroxyl density (2.5 OH/nm(2)) is observed in the temperature range of 200 degrees C-500 degrees C after the initial dehydration. However, repolymerization in the network (non-bridging oxygenbridging oxygen) is observed due to volatilization of sodium. The acid-leached surface undergoes sodium out-diffusion from the bulk at sub-T-g temperatures with laterally resolved inhomogeneity and shows a reduction in the concentration of hydroxyls from 4.5 OH/nm(2) (200 degrees C) to 3.2 OH/nm(2) (500 degrees C) accompanied by an increase in bridging oxygen. These results suggest that when [OH] > 2.53/nm(2), vicinal OH undergo dehydroxylation with evolution of water, whereas when [OH] < 2.5/nm(2), most OHs are non-interacting and isolated (at temperatures below T-g). Furthermore, at temperatures exceeding 300 degrees C, sodium has enough thermal energy to desorb in vacuum and diffuse from the bulk (depending on the abundance & local structure).									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000416933700018

The latest version of this commercially sold sub-stack or "module" results in improved performance (400-430 to 590 W at 4 V and 51 % total efficiency (eta) versus LHV, i.e. from 100 to 137 mA cm(-2) at 0.67 V per cell) and durability (2500 h expected with 10% decrease in power when operating at constant nominal current). The catalyst content in the module is also reduced from 1.2 to 0.5-0.6 mg cm(-2). These improvements were achieved via an optimisation the porosity of the electrodes in order to obtain greater air diffusion inside the electrode. The authors also present the results of experiments that determine the origin of the performance loss of the AFC module over time. In contrast to much of the literature, the results do not support the irreversible corrosion of materials due to the oxygen reduction reaction. Indeed, over the investigated working period (i.e. ca. 1500-2000h), the degradation of the performance was attributed to a slow and constant physical flooding due to imperfections in the wet proofing coating. Based on these facts, strategies are proposed to slow, avoid and even reverse to this flooding. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report that cobalt oxide (CoOx) ultrathin nanosheets (UTNS, approximate to 1.6 nm thick) with a large number of oxygen defects and mixed cobalt valences can be obtained through a facile one-step hydrothermal protocol. The large number of oxygen defects make the ultrathin CoOx nanosheet a superior OER catalyst with low overpotentials of 315 and 365 mV at current densities of 50 and 200 mA cm(-2), respectively. The stable framework-like architectures of the UTNS further ensure their high OER activity and durability. Our method represents a facile one-step preparation of CoOx nanostructures with tunable compositions, morphologies, and defects, and thus promotes OER properties. This strategy may find its wider applicability in designing active, robust, and easy-to-obtain catalysts for OER and other electrocatalytic systems.									17	2	0	0	1	0	17			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000451762800025	30375608

However, a quantitative correlation of degradation of the oxygen surface exchange kinetics with Sr precipitation formation at the LSCF surface is not clearly understood yet. Herein, the correlation of the time-dependent degradation mechanisms of the LSCF catalysts with respect to Sr segregation phenomenon at the surface were investigated at 800 degrees C for a prolonged annealing time (similar to 800 h) by combining in situ electrochemical measurements, and ex situ chemical and structural analyses at the multiscale. The in situ monitored surface exchange coefficient (k(chem)) was found to drastically drop by similar to 86% over the 800 h, and it was accompanied by the formation of Sr-containing secondary phases on the bulk LSCF surface, as expected. However, the estimated coverage of Sr segregation on the LSCF surface was only similar to 15%, even after 800 h of aging time, showing significant deviation from the k(chem) degradation rate (similar to 86%). The surface chemistry evolution at the clean surface area, which is believed to be electrochemically active, was further analyzed on the nanoscale. The quantified results showed that the Sr elemental fraction of the A-site at the outermost surface of the LSCF samples was becoming deficient from similar to 4.0 at 0 h to similar to 0.27 at 800 h annealing. Interestingly, the time-dependent behavioral tendencies between k(chem) degradation and surface Sr fractional changes were highly analogous. Thus, our results suggest that this Sr deficiency at the clean surface region more dominantly impacts the degradation process rather than an electrochemical activity passivation by the SrOx precipitates, which has been shown to be a major degradation mechanism of LSCF performance.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000484831100021	31408308

To overcome this, their surfaces are usually modified by depositing earth-abundant, efficient, and inexpensive water oxidation co-catalysts. While this effort has been successful in enhancing the photoelectrochemical performance, a true understanding of the nature of the improvement is still under discussion. This is due to the fact that the co-catalyst can have multiple functionalities, e.g., accelerating charge transfer, passivating surface states, or modifying band bending. Disentangling these factors is challenging, but necessary to obtain a full understanding of the enhancement mechanism and better design the semiconductor/co-catalyst interface. In this study, we investigate the role of atomic layer deposited (ALD) MnOx co-catalysts and their thickness in the photoelectrochemical performance of BiVO4 photoanodes. Modified MnOx/BiVO4 samples with an optimum thickness of similar to 4 nm show higher photocurrent (a factor of >3) as well as lower onset potential (by similar to 100 mV) compared to the bare BiVO4. We combine spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical measurements to unravel the different roles of MnOx and explain the photocurrent trend as a function of the thickness of MnOx. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies reveal that the surface band bending of BiVO4 is modified after the addition of MnOx, therefore reducing surface recombination. At the same time, increasing the thickness of MnOx beyond the optimal 4 nm provides shunting pathways, as shown by energy dispersive X-ray scanning transmission electron microscopy (EDX-STEM) and redox electrochemistry. This cancels out the band bending effect, which explains the observed photocurrent trend. Therewith, this study provides additional insights into the understanding of the charge transfer processes occurring at the semiconductor-catalyst interface.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521109000008

PCC 6803 with genetically inactivated desaturase genes. We show that posttranslational carboxyl-terminal processing of the precursor form of the D1 protein is an extremely sensitive reaction in the PSII repair cycle and is readily affected by low temperature. Furthermore, the threshold temperature at which perturbations in D1-protein processing start to emerge is specifically dependent on the extent of thylakoid membrane lipid unsaturation, as indicated by comparison of wildtype cells with the mutant defective in desaturation of 18:1 fatty acids of thylakoid membranes. When the temperature was decreased from 33 degrees C (growth temperature) to 18 degrees C, the inability of the fatty acid mutant to recover from photoinhibition was accompanied by a failure to process the newly synthesized D1 protein, which accumulated in considerable amounts as an unprocessed precursor D1 protein. Precursor D1 integrated into PSII monomer and dimer complexes even at low temperatures, but no activation of oxygen evolution occurred in these complexes in mutant cells defective in fatty acid unsaturation.									75	3	0	0	73	0	80			0032-0889			WOS:A1997XK77400010	9232871

For the NiO/H2O and Ni2P/H2O interfaces, we employ an explicit atomistic description of water and perform molecular dynamics simulations considering both molecular and dissociated water adsorbed at the co-catalyst surface. For the MIL-125-NH2/NiO and MIL-125-NH2/Ni2P interfaces, we rely on the concept of charge neutrality and use a scheme combining the electron affinities and the charge neutrality levels of the interface components. We provide a description of the underlying fundamental processes that is consistent with photoluminescence and intrinsic activity experiments and that supports NiO and Ni2P as suitable co-catalysts for MIL-125-NH(2)as far as the hydrogen evolution reaction is concerned.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000578872600023

In environmental remediation, manganese oxides can catalyze peroxides to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in an aqueous phase for in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). The manganese oxides stand out among the transition metal oxides due to their inherent dissimilarity in redox properties, crystal structure, and surface nano-architectures. In this paper, a comprehensive review is presented on the formation of nanostructured manganese oxides in nature (abiotic oxidation and biogenic evolution) as well as their artificial synthesis with rationally controlled tunnels and layers, crystal structures, exposed facet orientations, dimensional architecture and oxidation states. We further overview the applications of nanostructured manganese oxides in activation of various peroxides for catalytic oxidation to destroy organic contaminants during water purification. The roles of manganese oxides are emphasized in catalytic activation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ozone (O-3), and persulfates (peroxymonosulfate and peroxydisulfate). The mechanisms of the interactions between manganese oxides with the diverse peroxides and structure-dependent ROS production will be illustrated. The regulating rules of compositional alien-metal doping, formation of mixed metal oxides and hybrid materials are further discussed regarding the promoted catalytic activity. More importantly, both radical oxidation and nonradical pathways involved in manganese-based AOPs will be illustrated. Lastly, we will propose several prospects for future development of manganese oxides in practical applications.									53	2	0	0	21	0	55			2051-8153	2051-8161		WOS:000517270500002

Blend samples were prepared by mixing lignite, which has low calorific value, high ash and moisture contents with petcoke that has high calorific value, low ash and moisture content, in the proportion of 70:30. Pyrolysis tests were carried out in nitrogen and carbon dioxide environments which are the main diluting gases of air and oxy-fuel environments, respectively. Pyrolysis curves of parent fuels and their blend reveal close resemblance up to 700 degrees C in both N-2 and CO2 environments. At higher temperatures, further weight loss taking place in N-2 and CO2 atmospheres is attributed to calcite decomposition and CO2-char gasification reaction, respectively. Gasification reaction leads to significant increase in CO and COS formation as observed in FTIR evolution profiles. Almost identical experimental and theoretical pyrolysis profiles of the blend samples show that there is no synergy between the parent fuels of the blend in both pyrolysis environments. Combustion experiments were carried out in four different atmospheres; air, oxygen-enriched air environment (30% O-2-70% N-2), oxy-fuel environment (21% O-2-79% CO2) and oxygen-enriched oxy-fuel environment (30% O-2-70% CO2). Combustion experiments show that replacing nitrogen in the gas mixture by the same concentration of CO2 leads to delay in combustion (lower maximum rate of weight loss and higher burnout temperatures). Overall comparison of derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) profiles shows that effect of oxygen content on combustion characteristics is more significant than that of diluting gas in the combustion environment. At elevated oxygen levels, profiles shift through lower temperature zone, peak and burnout temperatures decrease, weight loss rate increases significantly and complete combustion is achieved at lower temperatures and shorter times.

The catalysts were designated VPO40, VPO100 and VPO132. Increasing the duration of reaction with n-butane/air mixture led to an increase in the total surface area from 21.3 m(2) g(-1) (VPO40) to 24.9 m2 g-1 (VPO100) and to 27.0 m(2) g(-1) (VPO132). It also led to the complete removal of the VOPO4 phase from catalysts VPO100 and VPO132, this VOPO4 phase having seen as a minor component of catalyst VPO40. Scanning electron microscopy showed that longer periods of pretreatment in the n-butane/air mixture produced catalysts with increasing amounts of a characteristic rosette-type of agglomerate. Temperature-programmed reduction with HZ resulted in the removal of similar to 11 monolayers equivalent of oxygen from all three of these catalysts at a peak maximum temperature of similar to 1000 K with the development of a second reduction peak at similar to 1100 K which increases with increasing time of n-butane/air pretreatment. The morphology produced by extended pretreatment in the n-butane/air mixture at 673 K is therefore predisposed to reaction with HZ (and probably with n-butane). Apparently paradoxically, increasing the duration of n-butane/air pretreatment results in catalysts which on temperature-programmed desorption desorb less oxygen.									14	2	0	0	0	0	14			1011-372X			WOS:000170812900017

The mixed transition metal oxide catalysts provide the most efficient catalytic activity for partial heterogeneous surface cations with oxygen vacancies as the active phase. They include multiple oxidation states and oxygen vacancies. Here, using a combination of transmission electron microscopy, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical properties to probe the surface of the MnMoO4 nanowires, it is shown that the intrinsic MnMoO4 oxygen vacancies on the oxygen electrode are an effective strategy to achieve a high reversibility and high efficiency for lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) batteries. The modified MnMoO4 nanowires exhibit a highly stable capacity at a fixed capacity of 5000 mA h g(sp)(-1) (calculated weight of Super P carbon black) during 50 cycles, a high-rate capability at a current rate of 3000 mA g(sp)(-1) during 70 cycles, and a long-term reversible capacity during 188 cycles at a fixed capacity of 1000 mA h g(sp)(-1). It is demonstrated that this strategy for creating mixed transition metal oxides (e. g., MnMoO4) may pave the way for the new structural design of electrocatalysts for Li-O-2 batteries.									53	4	0	0	6	0	54			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000397007100006

Herein, by revisiting the well-studied aqueous system of Co/NaBH4 at room temperature, the chainlike assembly of Co3O4 nanoparticles is attained with the assistance of an external magnetic field; more importantly, a one-dimensional hierarchical array consisting of perpendicularly oriented and interconnected Co(OH)(2) thin nanosheets could be constructed upon such well-aligned Co3O4 assembly, generating biphasic core shell-structured Co3O4@Co(OH)(2) microfibers with permanent structural integrity even upon the removal of the external magnetic field; isomorphous doping was also introduced to produce Co3O4@FeCo(OH)(2) microfibers with similar structural merits. The cobalt-chemistry in such a Co/NaBH4 aqueous system was illustrated to reveal the compositional and morphological evolutions of the cobalt species and the formation mechanism of the microfibers. Owing to the presence of Co3O4 as the core, such anisotropic Co3O4@(Fe-doped)Co(OH)(2) microfibers demonstrated interesting magnetic-responsive behaviors, which could undergo macro-scale oriented -assembly in response to a magnetic stimulus; and with the presence of a hierarchical array of weakly crystallized thin (Fe-doped) Co(OH)(2) nanosheets with polycrystallinity as the shell, such microfibers demonstrated remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline conditions.									25	2	0	0	2	0	25			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000411043600071	28832114

Titanium tetraisopropoxide Ti((OPr)-Pr-i)(4) was used as the Ti source. Film preparation was carried out on quartz and Si(100) substrates at 450 degrees C under a nitrogen + oxygen atmosphere followed by annealing in air at temperatures up to 800 degrees C. The structural, compositional, and morphological evolution of the films was investigated by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy, with particular focus on the interplay between the system properties and the processing conditions.

J	Coogan, L. A.; Gillis, K. M.								The average Phanerozoic CO2 degassing flux estimated from the O-isotopic composition of seawater								EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS				536						116151	10.1016/j.epsl.2020.116151				APR 15 2020	2020	The degassing rate of CO2 from the solid Earth, and matching burial rate, is critical to understanding the long-term carbon and oxygen cycles and the maintenance of a habitable climate. However, estimates of modern CO2 degassing rates vary by more than a factor of four and uncertainties are even larger further back in Earth history. Both the crustal C-inventory and C-isotope mass balance suggests that over long timescales similar to 70-90% of the CO2 degassed from the solid Earth is drawn-down through silicate weathering reactions (subaerial and submarine). These reactions involve dissolution of silicate minerals, that typically formed at relatively high temperatures, and formation of silicate and carbonate minerals in low temperature aqueous environments. These new low temperature minerals have much higher delta O-18 than their precursors; thus the rate of degassing of CO2 is tied to the rate of removal of materials with high delta O-18 from the hydrosphere into weathering products. Maintaining a near-constant O-isotopic composition of the ocean over the Phanerozoic means that this weathering sink of isotopically heavy O must have equaled the source of isotopically heavy O to the ocean. This isotopically heavy oxygen largely comes from high-temperature hydrothermal vent fluids at mid-ocean ridges. New O-isotope data for the previously under-sampled lower oceanic crust from fast-spreading ridges, along with a compilation of published O-isotopic compositions of other sections of oceanic crust altered at high-temperatures, allows the magnitude of this high delta O-18 flux to be quantified. Modelling the coupled O-isotope and CO2 mass balance constrains suggests that the average Phanerozoic solid Earth CO2 degassing rate was similar to 3.4 Tmol yr(-1) (10th to 90th percentile of 1.8-5.3 Tmol yr(-1)). This is substantially lower than has been suggested by some recent studies, and is at or below the lower end of the range of previous estimates, with wide ranging implications for our understanding of the long term C cycle.

J	Oja, Vello; Eichelmann, Hillar; Laisk, Agu								Oxygen evolution from single- and multiple-turnover light pulses: temporal kinetics of electron transport through PSII in sunflower leaves								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				110	2			99	109		10.1007/s11120-011-9702-9				DEC 2011	2011	Oxygen evolution per single-turnover flash (STF) or multiple-turnover pulse (MTP) was measured with a zirconium O-2 analyzer from sunflower leaves at 22A degrees C. STF were generated by Xe arc lamp, MTP by red LED light of up to 18000 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1). Ambient O-2 concentration was 10-30 ppm, STF and MTP were superimposed on far-red background light in order to oxidize plastoquinone (PQ) and randomize S-states. Electron (e(-)) flow was calculated as 4 times O-2 evolution. Q (A) -> Q (B) electron transport was investigated firing double STF with a delay of 0 to 2 ms between the two. Total O-2 evolution per two flashes equaled to that from a single flash when the delay was zero and doubled when the delay exceeded 2 ms. This trend was fitted with two exponentials with time constants of 0.25 and 0.95 ms, equal amplitudes. Illumination with MTP of increasing length resulted in increasing O-2 evolution per pulse, which was differentiated with an aim to find the time course of O-2 evolution with sub-millisecond resolution. At the highest pulse intensity of 2.9 photons ms(-1) per PSII, 3 e(-) initially accumulated inside PSII and the catalytic rate of PQ reduction was determined from the throughput rate of the fourth and fifth e(-). A light response curve for the reduction of completely oxidized PQ was a rectangular hyperbola with the initial slope of 1.2 PSII quanta per e(-) and V (m) of 0.6 e(-) ms(-1) per PSII. When PQ was gradually reduced during longer MTP, V (m) decreased proportionally with the fraction of oxidized PQ. It is suggested that the linear kinetics with respect to PQ are apparent, caused by strong product inhibition due to about equal binding constants of PQ and PQH(2) to the Q (B) site. The strong product inhibition is an appropriate mechanism for down-regulation of PSII electron transport in accordance with rate of PQH(2) oxidation by cytochrome b(6)f.									12	0	0	0	11	0	12			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000297541500003	22038184

An increase of the coercivity is observed as often as the oxidation reactions Fe2+ --> Fe3+ and Mn+ --> M(n+m)+ (1 less than or equal to m less than or equal to 3) occur. This enhancement of coercivity has been explained by stresses generated during each specific oxidation reaction. The well-known property of cobalt to strongly magnify the magnetostrictive effects has been used to support this interpretation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

All samples show the ORT-2 orthorhombic structure that suppresses the Jahn-Teller distortion, thus favoring a ferromagnetic (FM) superexchange interaction between Mn3+-O-Mn3+. For x = 0.0 the oxygen excess (y approximate to 0.09) produces vacancies in the La and Mn sites and generates a fraction around 18% of Mn4+ ions and 82% of the usual Mn3+ ions, with possible double-exchange interaction between them. The Fe doping in this system is known to produce only stable Fe3+ ions. We find an evolution from a fairly strong FM phase with a Curie temperature T-C similar to 160 K, for x = 0.0, to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase with T-N = 790 K, for x = 1.0, accompanied by clear signatures of a cluster-glass behavior. For intermediate Fe contents a mixed-phase state occurs, with a gradual decrease (increase) in the FM (AFM) phase, accompanied by a systematic transition broadening for 0.2 < x < 0.7. A model based on the expected exchange interaction among the various magnetic-ion types accounts very well for the saturation magnetization (M-S) dependence on Fe doping.

To elucidate the roles of Ca2+ in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr2+-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 angstrom, and compared it with the 1.9 angstrom structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca2+, resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca2+, W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr2+-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation. In addition, the PsbY subunit, which was absent in the 1.9 angstrom structure of native PSII, was found in the Sr-PSII structure.									114	3	1	0	54	0	137			0027-8424			WOS:000316377400052	23426624

Herein, Mo5N6-MoS2 heterojunction nanosheets prepared on hollow carbon nanoribbons (Mo5N6-MoS2/HCNRs) are designed as Mott-Schottky electrocatalysts for efficient pH-universal HER. The in-plane Mo5N6-MoS2 Mott-Schottky heterointerface induces electron redistribution and a built-in electric field, which effectively activates the inert MoS2 basal planes to intrinsically increase the electrocatalytic activity, improve electronic conductivity, and boost water dissociation activity. Moreover, the vertical Mo5N6-MoS2 nanosheets provide more activated sites for the electrochemical reaction and facilitate mass/electrolyte transport, while the tightly coupled HCNRs substrate and metallic Mo5N6 provide fast electron transfer paths. Consequently, the Mo5N6-MoS2/HCNRs electrocatalyst delivers excellent pH-universal HER performances exemplified by ultralow overpotentials of 57, 59, and 53 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes with Tafel slopes of 38.4, 43.5, and 37.9 mV dec(-1), respectively, which are superior to those of the reported MoS2-based catalysts and outperform Pt in overall water splitting. This work proposes a new strategy to construct an in-plane heterointerface on the nanoscale and provides fresh insights into the HER electrocatalytic mechanism of MoS2-based heterostructures.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000792085100001	35527344

This result is independent of the various deposition conditions investigated. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy shows this interfacial layer to be polycrystalline and very non-uniform.Specially designed structures of the type [Si]/SiO2/Al/RuO2/Al were annealed and measured with four-point probe setups having different probe spacings. Applying a transmission line type-model for four-point probe measurement of multilayered structures, the specific contact resistance between Al and RuO2 was derived and shown to decrease with annealing duration at 500-degrees-C. This evolution of the specific contact resistance indicates that the interfacial reaction does not lead to an insulting interface as could have been expected if the interfacial growth were pure and dense Al2O3.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0038-1101			WOS:A1991EZ88000006

An isobaric cooling path from peak-metamorphic conditions of 860A degrees C to 750A degrees C at 6.5 kbar is inferred from scapolite-wollastonite-grandite reaction textures in Type (1) and is consistent with cooling after an advective heat input from related gabbroic and tonalitic intrusive bodies. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope geochemistry was used to decipher the fluid/rock evolution of the three marble types. An interpreted four-stage temperature-time-fluid flow path comprises: (1) infiltration of pre-peak-metamorphic fluids, depleted in delta O-18, that caused a shift of primary sedimentary delta O-18 ratios to lower values (19.6-20.0); (2) syn-metamorphic fluid liberation from Type (1) marbles with evidence for processes close to batch devolatilization that caused a weak coupled C-13 and O-18 depletion during prograde metamorphism. A different devolatilization behaviour, close to Rayleigh fractionation, texturally associated with fold settings indicates that granulite-facies fluid flow was focused rather than pervasive; (3) H2O-absent conditions were dominant when coronal grandite formed during incipient high-temperature isobaric cooling at the expense of scapolite and wollastonite in the Type (1) marbles; (4) intense post-peak- hydration of Type (2) and Type (3) marbles is the last recognizable metasomatic event. In combination, the three marble types record fluid infiltration both before and after the metamorphic peak.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0930-0708	1438-1168		WOS:000262830000009

Although the topic has been studied for decades, challenges persist in clarifying the nanoscale mechanism and dynamic evolution of tribochemical reactions. To investigate the tribochemistry between iron and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in ambient and cryogenic environments, we have trained and expanded a ReaxFF reactive force field to describe iron-oxygen-water-PTFE systems (C/H/O/F/Fe). Using ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations, we find that mechanical shearing of single asperity induced the degradation of PTFE molecules and radicals, showing subsequent oxidation and hydroxylation reactions of the radicals initiated by C-C bond cleavage, in agreement with previous experimental observations. Furthermore, we studied mechanisms of interfacial tribochemical reactions and formation of transfer films. We found that tribochemical wear and Fe-C and Fe-F bonding networks are important mechanisms for anchoring molecular chains to form a transfer film on the iron countersurface. Hydroxyl groups can dehydrogenate to form short and strong chelation bonds with the Fe2O3 countersurface. A friction-induced oriented molecular layer plays a key role in reducing friction, which is responsible for the excellent lubrication property. By varying temperatures in the range of 10-300 K, we found a nonmonotonic change in friction with a maxima at 100 K. At cryogenic temperatures, the molecular mobility was obviously suppressed, while the chain rigidity was enhanced, resulting in the less oriented interface and brittle-like shear interface, which is responsible for nonmonotonic friction. This work elucidates mechanisms of tribochemical reactions and transfer film formation between iron and PTFE at the atomistic level, facilitating design and development of self-lubricating materials, especially under harsh conditions.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000746548400001	35049265

The phenotypes of the E229D and E243K mutants were similar to that of the control strain (AR) in all of the studied aspects. The characteristics of CA1 were very different. Formate, which inhibits the Q(A)(-) to Q(B)(-) reaction, was severalfold less effective in CA1 than in AR. The S(2)Q(A)(-) and S(2)Q(B)(-) states were stabilized in CA1. It was previously shown that the electron transfer between Q(A)(-) and Q(B) was modified in CA1 (P Maenpaa, T. Kallio, P. Mule, G. Salih, E.-M. Aro, E. Tyystjarvi, C. Jansson [1993] Plant Mol Biol 22: 1-12). A change in the redox potential of the Q(A)/Q(A)(-) couple, which renders the reoxidation of Q(A)(-) by back or forward reactions more difficult, could explain the phenotype of CA(1). Although the rates of photoinhibition measured as inhibition of oxygen evolution, Chl fluorescence quenching, and decrease of thermoluminescence B and Q bands were similar in AR and CA1, the CA1 strain more quickly reached a state from which the cells were unable to recover their activity. The results described in this paper suggest that a modification in the structure of the D-de loop of D-1 could influence the properties of the couple Q(A)/Q(A)(-) in D-2 and the mechanism of recovery from photoinhibition.									48	0	0	0	46	0	48			0032-0889			WOS:A1995QB24700022	12228353	
J	Li, Junrui; Sun, Shouheng				Li, Junrui/AAF-1205-2019	Li, Junrui/0000-0002-4386-1199			Intermetallic Nanoparticles: Synthetic Control and Their Enhanced Electrocatalysis								ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH				52	7			2015	2025		10.1021/acs.accounts.9b00172				JUL 2019	2019	CONSPECTUS: Intermetallic nanoparticles (NPs) described in this Account are a class of metallic alloy NPs within which metal atoms are bonded via strong d-orbital interaction and ordered anisotropically in a specific crystallographic direction. Compared to the common metallic alloy NPs with solid solution structure, intermetallic NPs are generally more stable against chemical oxidation and etching. The strict stoichiometry requirement, well-defined atom binding environment and layered atomic arrangement also make intermetallic NPs an ideal model for understanding their physical and catalytic properties. This account summarizes the synthetic principles and strategies developed to obtain monodisperse intermetallic NPs, especially tetragonal L1(0)-NPs. The thermodynamics and kinetics involved in the conversion between disordered and ordered structures are briefly discussed. The synthetic methods are grouped into two slightly different categories: solution-phase synthesis followed by solid state annealing and direct solution-phase synthesis. In the former method, high-surface-area supports are often needed to disperse NPs and to prevent them from aggregation, while in the latter method such supports are not required since the structure conversion temperature is lowered to a level that the conversion can proceed in the solution reaction condition. In any of these two synthetic approaches, various factors influencing intermetallic structure formation should be carefully controlled to ensure more complete structural transition within NPs. Using representative synthetic examples, we highlight the strategies explored to facilitate the formation of intermetallic structure, including the introduction of vacancies/defects within NP structures and the control of atom addition rate/seed-mediated diffusion to lower the energy barrier. These strategies illustrate how the concept of thermodynamics and kinetics can be used to design the synthesis of intermetallic NPs. Additionally, to correlate NP structure and catalysis, we introduce briefly the d-band theory to explain how the electronic, strain and ensemble effects can be used to tune NP catalysis. We focus specifically on Pt-, Pd-, and Au-based L1(0)-NPs and demonstrate how these L1(0)-NPs could be prepared to show much enhanced catalysis for electrochemical reactions, including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR), and thermo-oxidation reaction of CO. Due to the enhanced metal atom stability in the "sandwich"-type structure, the roles of the first-row transition metal atoms in catalysis are better understood to achieve catalysis optimization. This concept can be extended to other alloy NPs, demonstrating great potentials in using intermetallic structures to control NP reduction and oxidation catalysis for important chemical and energy applications.									103	6	0	0	6	0	104			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000476568400026	31251036

The relationship between the overpotential and optical transmission of the catalysts determined the attainable efficiencies for integrated solar-fuel devices as well as the optimal band gaps for the photoanode in such devices. The systems investigated generally showed: (1) the OER catalysts dissolved in acid, and were less stable in buffered near-neutral pH electrolytes than in strongly alkaline electrolytes; (2) higher overpotentials were required to drive the OER at a specified current density when the catalysts were operated in contact with near-neutral pH electrolytes than strong alkaline electrolytes; (3) for some of the OER catalysts, the electrocatalytic activity and in situ absorption spectra depended strongly on the preparation method; (4) increasing the loading of the electrocatalyst reduced the overpotential and the optical transmission; (5) for the catalysts studied, the optical transmission and overpotential were generally correlated, and the trend lines did not cross, indicating that based on these factors alone, the optimal approach is to use lower loadings of highly active catalysts, rather than to use a less active but more transparent catalysts; (6) for a solar-fuel device driven by semiconductors operating at the Shockley-Queisser limit and using a continuous film of a given OER catalyst in the path of incident light, the efficiency decrease due to the reduced optical transmittance that accompanies increased OER catalyst loading can be substantially greater than any efficiency increase that might be gained through the reduction in catalytic overpotential by increasing the catalyst loading; and (7) HER catalysts possessed the same performance trade-off when the light is incident through the HER catalysts as is observed for OER catalysts when the light is incident from the OER side.									42	2	0	0	1	0	43			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000398909900018

Therefore, it would be of great significance to catalyze the degradation of UA in human body. Herein, platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) were found to be an effective mimic of uricase in the oxidation of UA. PtNPs could lower the activation energy of UA oxidation (i.e., from 139.49 kJ mol(-1) to 61.73 kJ mol(-1)), and thus increase the reaction rate constant dramatically (e. g., by the catalysis of 2.63 mg L-1 PtNPs, the reaction rate constant of UA degradation at 37 degrees C was 5.85 x 10(-4) s(-1), which was almost 29000 times higher than that of without PtNPs (2.02 x 10(-8) s(-1))). Effects of degradation conditions, such as the concentration and size of PtNPs, concentration of dissolved oxygen and pH value of the solution on the catalytic degradation of UA have been studied. Furthermore, products of UA degradation were analyzed by GC-MS spectroscopy and FT-IR spectrometry. On this basis, a detailed mechanism was finally proposed for the PtNPs-catalyzed UA degradation.									18	2	0	0	2	0	20			1463-9076			WOS:000288447100102	21359394

Herein, a facile impregnation method with an annealing process was developed to synthesize MoO3 modified Fe2O3 photoanodes using the MoO3 layer as an effective passivation component to decrease surface states and thus to improve the charge separation and transfer process at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. The oxygen vacancies were subsequently introduced to steer the electrical conductivity, and further to boost the charge separation and transfer. The optimized MoO3-x/Fe2O3-x photoanode displays a photocurrent density of 2.6 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5 G irradiation, 2.2 times that of the Fe2O3 (1.2 mA cm(-2)). The synergetic integration of passivation layer and oxygen vacancies on photoelectrodes heralds an efficient paradigm for solar energy conversion.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000708296400005		
J	Barber, James								'Photosystem II: the water splitting enzyme of photosynthesis and the origin of oxygen in our atmosphere'								QUARTERLY REVIEWS OF BIOPHYSICS				49						e14	10.1017/S0033583516000093				AUG 1 2016	2016	About 3 billion years ago an enzyme emerged which would dramatically change the chemical composition of our planet and set in motion an unprecedented explosion in biological activity. This enzyme used solar energy to power the thermodynamically and chemically demanding reaction of water splitting. In so doing it provided biology with an unlimited supply of reducing equivalents needed to convert carbon dioxide into the organic molecules of life while at the same time produced oxygen to transform our planetary atmosphere from an anaerobic to an aerobic state. The enzyme which facilitates this reaction and therefore underpins virtually all life on our planet is known as Photosystem II (PSII). It is a pigment-binding, multisubunit protein complex embedded in the lipid environment of the thylakoid membranes of plants, algae and cyanobacteria. Today we have detailed understanding of the structure and functioning of this key and unique enzyme. The journey to this level of knowledge can be traced back to the discovery of oxygen itself in the 18th-century. Since then there has been a sequence of mile stone discoveries which makes a fascinating story, stretching over 200 years. But it is the last few years that have provided the level of detail necessary to reveal the chemistry of water oxidation and O-O bond formation. In particular, the crystal structure of the isolated PSII enzyme has been reported with ever increasing improvement in resolution. Thus the organisational and structural details of its many subunits and cofactors are now well understood. The water splitting site was revealed as a cluster of four Mn ions and a Ca ion surrounded by amino-acid side chains, of which seven provide direct ligands to the metals. The metal cluster is organised as a cubane structure composed of three Mn ions and a Ca2+ linked by oxo-bonds with the fourth Mn ion attached to the cubane. This structure has now been synthesised in a non-protein environment suggesting that it is a totally inorganic precursor for the evolution of the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving complex. In summary, the overall structure of the catalytic site has given a framework on which to build a mechanistic scheme for photosynthetic dioxygen generation and at the same time provide a blue-print and incentive to develop catalysts for artificial photo-electrochemical systems to split water and generate renewable solar fuels.									54	0	0	0	33	0	54			0033-5835	1469-8994		WOS:000385392200001	27659174	
J	Govindjee; Seufferheld, MJ				Govindjee, Govindjee/ABF-3362-2021				Non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll a fluorescence: early history and characterization of two xanthophyll-cycle mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii								FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY				29	10			1141	1155		10.1071/FP02061				2002	2002	This paper deals first with the early, although incomplete, history of photoinhibition, of 'non-Q(A)-related chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence changes', and the xanthophyll cycle that preceded the discovery of the correlation between non-photochemical quenching of Chl a fluorescence (NPQ) and conversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin. It includes the crucial observation that the fluorescence intensity quenching, when plants are exposed to excess light, is indeed due to a change in the quantum yield of fluorescence. The history ends with a novel turn in the direction of research - isolation and characterization of NPQ xanthophyll-cycle mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Dangeard and Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh., blocked in conversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin, and zeaxanthin to violaxanthin, respectively. In the second part of the paper, we extend the characterization of two of these mutants (npq1, which accumulates violaxanthin, and npq2, which accumulates zeaxanthin) through parallel measurements on growth, and several assays of PSII function: oxygen evolution, Chl a fluorescence transient (the Kautsky effect), the two-electron gate function of PSII, the back reactions around PSII, and measurements of NPQ by pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM 2000) fluorimeter. We show that, in the npq2 mutant, Chl a fluorescence is quenched both in the absence and presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU). However, no differences are observed in functioning of the electron-acceptor side of PSII - both the two-electron gate and the back reactions are unchanged. In addition, the role of protons in fluorescence quenching during the 'P-to-S' fluorescence transient was confirmed by the effect of nigericin in decreasing this quenching effect. Also, the absence of zeaxanthin in the npq1 mutant leads to reduced oxygen evolution at high light intensity, suggesting another protective role of this carotenoid. The available data not only support the current model of NPQ that includes roles for both pH and the xanthophylls, but also are consistent with additional protective roles of zeaxanthin. However, this paper emphasizes that we still lack sufficient understanding of the different parts of NPQ, and that the precise mechanisms of photoprotection in the alga Chlamydomonas may not be the same as those in higher plants.

The BiOX compounds usually have a tetragonal type crystal structure with unique layered morphology consisting of [X-Bi-O-Bi-X] sheets. Although the BiOX nanosheets exposed with {001} facets perform superior photoactivity, there is lack of understanding about their capability in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, we adopt wet-chemical syntheses to make 2D BiOCl and Pd-doped BiOCl nanosheets for CO2RR. In the results, formic acid is the only one kind of product converted from CO2 along with H-2 gas from water reduction over both BiOCl and Pd-doped BiOCl nanosheets. By thorough analyses with ex situ and in situ spectroscopy, the results reflect that (1) metallic Bi-0 atoms generated by the applied negative potentials serve as the catalytic sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO2RR and (2) the existence of doped Pd ions in the BiOCl structure reduces the barrier of charge transfer over the nanosheets, which enhances HER and CO2RR activities. We believe that the observations are important references for making catalysts toward CO2RR performance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000752977200053	34859991

Successful implementations of these reactions often require the combination of catalysts with photoelectrodes. How these catalysts improve the performance of photoelectrodes, however, is not well understood, making it difficult to further improve these systems for practical applications. Here, we present a systematic study that directly compares two water-oxidation catalysts (WOCs) on a hematite (alpha-Fe2O3)-based PEC system. We observe that when a thin layer of a heterogenized molecular Ir catalyst (het-WOC) is applied to a hematite photoanode, the system's performance is improved primarily due to improved charge transfer (>2 fold), while the surface recombination rate remains unchanged. In stark contrast, heterogeneous oxide catalysts (IrOx) improve the PEC performance of hematite by significantly reducing the surface recombination rate. These results suggest that the het-WOC provides additional charge-transfer pathways across the Fe2O3 vertical bar H2O interface, while IrOx and similar bulk metal-oxide catalysts replace the Fe2O3 vertical bar H2O interface with a fundamentally different one.									106	5	0	0	12	0	106			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000375699500023

The obtained tungsten trioxides (WO3) at three different temperatures and two oxygen mole fractions used for the highest synthesis temperature were characterized by XRD, SEM, and XPS. Higher crystallinity and concentration of W5+ was observed in tungsten trioxides as the synthesis temperature increased. Nevertheless, despite of the different synthetic conditions used, a mixture of two different crystalline structures was observed in all solar-prepared tungsten trioxides: monoclinic and triclinic. Comparing oxides obtained at 1000 degrees C, higher concentration of W5+ and more defects were found when using lower oxygen molar fraction (WO3-1000-2). Their electrochemical performance was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a conventional three-electrode cell in the following three aqueous electrolytes: acidic, alkaline, and neutral media. In the acidic medium, all the tungsten trioxides showed a capacitive behavior, which was enhanced for oxides obtained at 1000 degrees C due to a mixed valence of W. On the other hand, in the alkaline medium, a catalytic behavior was detected with higher activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction for the oxide with more defects, higher crystallinity, and monoclinic phase, obtained at 1000 degrees C and a lower oxygen molar fraction in the synthesis. Finally, in the neutral medium, the oxides synthesized at 1000 degrees C presented a capacitive behavior whereas the oxides prepared at the lowest temperatures (600 and 800 degrees C) presented electrochemical processes related to a catalytic behavior for water reduction, which must correspond to their minor concentration of defects, as confirmed by XPS.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000459805700003

Hillier, T. Wydrzynski, Biochemistry 39 (2000) 4399-4405). The results show that one substrate water molecule is bound at the beginning of the catalytic sequence, in the S-0 state, while the second substrate water molecule binds in the S-3 state or possibly earlier. It may be that the second substrate water molecule only enters the catalytic sequence following the formation of the S-3 state. Most importantly, comparison of the observed exchange rates with oxygen ligand exchange in various metal complexes reveal that the two substrate water molecules are most likely bound to separate Mn-III ions, which do not undergo metal-centered oxidations through to the S-3 state. The implication of this analysis is that in the S-1 state, all four Mn ions are in the +3 oxidation state. This minireview summarizes the arguments for this proposal. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here we report a facile one-pot synthesis of edge-segregated trimetallic Pd-Pt-Ni spiral nanosheets (SpNSs) to serve as active dual-electrocatalysts toward ORR and OER electrocatalysis under alkaline conditions, showcasing a workable cathode electrocatalyst for high-performance and rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). These trimetallic SpNSs are generated from a template-directed, spiral dislocation growth process with the later deposited Pt-Ni active ingredient mainly segregated at the low-coordinated edges. Partial in situ oxidation of incorporated Ni generates highly dispersed NiOx species which play a crucial role in modulating the electronic structure of Pd and Pt and providing strong hydroxyl adsorption sites. Owing to these merits, the Pd45Pt44Ni11 SpNSs exhibit excellent ORR mass activity (4.90 A mg(Pd+Pt)(-1)) in 0.1 M KOH, which is 28.8 times that of commercial Pt/C. Meanwhile, they require a substantially lower overpotential than Pt/C and Ni-free counterparts to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the reverse OER. When employed as the cathode in a practical ZAB, the Pd45Pt44Ni11 SpNSs present greatly improved power density and rechargeability compared to the Pt/C benchmark. This work realizes atomic-level manipulation for the distribution of active ingredients on ultrathin 2D multimetallic nanostructures, offering a novel platform for the exploration of high-performance energy conversion heterocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000746666200001

Nonetheless, their catalytic performance is restricted by the sluggish reaction kinetics, limited exposed active sites, and poor conductivity. In this work, we report on an effective strategy to solve those problems by using an as-designed new porous-C/Ni2SeS nanocatalyst with the Ni2SeS nanostubs anchored on with porous-carbon skeletons process. On the basis of three advantages, as the enhancement of the intrinsic activity using the ternary sulfoselenide, increased number of exposed active sites due to the 3D hollow substrate, and increased conductivity caused by porous-carbon skeletons, the resulting porous-C/Ni2SeS requires an overpotential of only 121 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 78 mV dec(-1) for hydrogen evolution in acidic media and a good long-term stability. Density functional theory calculations also show that the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption of the Ni 2 SeS was -0.23 eV, which not only is close to the ideal value (0 eV) and Pt reference (-0.09 eV) but also is lower than those of NiS2 and NiSe2; large electrical states exist in the vicinity of the Fermi level, which further improves its electrocatalytic performance. This work provides new insights into the rational design of ternary dichalcogenides and hollow structure materials for practical applications in HER catalysis and energy fields.									8	1	0	0	1	0	8			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000530668400027	32314921

Thermal treatment of Rh2S3 at high temperatures (600 degrees C to 850 degrees C) in presence of argon resulted in the transformation of Rh2S3 into Rh3S4, Rh17S15 and Rh which were characterized by TGA/DTA, XRD, EDX, and deconvolved XPS analyses. The catalyst particle size distribution ranged from 3 to 12 nm. Cyclic voltammetry and rotating disk electrode measurements were used to evaluate the catalytic activity for hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions in H2SO4 and HBr solutions. The thermally treated catalysts show high activity for the hydrogen reactions. The exchange current densities (i(o)) of the synthesized RhxSy catalysts in H-2-saturated 1M H2SO4 and 1M HBr for HER and HOR were 0.9 mA/cm(2) to 1.0 mA/cm(2) and 0.8 to 0.9 mA/cm(2), respectively. The lower i(o) values obtained in 1M HBr solution compared to in H2SO4 might be due to the adsorption of Br- on the active surface. Stable electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of RhxSy catalyst was obtained for CV scan limits between 0 V and 0.65 V vs. RHE. Scans with upper voltage limit beyond 0.65 V led to decreased and unreproducible ECSA measurements. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS.

J	Yang, C; Hutcheon, I; Krouse, HR								Fluid inclusion and stable isotopic studies of thermochemical sulphate reduction from Burnt Timber and Crossfield East gas fields in Alberta, Canada								BULLETIN OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM GEOLOGY				49	1			149	164		10.2113/49.1.149				MAR 2001	2001	Thermochemical sulphate reduction (TSR) is generally considered to be the source of high H2S content in deep Devonian and Mississippian gas fields. Increasing concentration of both H2S and CO2 is observed to correlate in general with increasing depth, and therefore temperature. The TSR reaction between anhydrite and natural gas to produce calcite and HS is also thought to generate water.Fluid inclusions in TSR calcite cement from the Burnt Timber and Crossfield East natural gas fields in the Upper Devonian Crossfield Member, in the Foothills and adjacent Plains of Southwestern Alberta, reveal details of the TSR reaction. Petrographic, stable isotopic, fluid inclusion microthermometry and gas compositional data have been gathered to calibrate the temperature range of TSR and to obtain semi-quantitative compositional data on the variation and evolution of natural gas composition and reaction products as TSR proceeds. Fluid inclusions in late-stage calcite have higher homogenization temperature (Th: 110-160 degreesC) and lower salinity (3.9 to 9.9wt.% NaCl equivalent) than anhydrite cement (Th: 80-105 degreesC; 11.6-17.8wt.% NaCl equivalent). They also have distinctively lower salinity (5-20wt.% NaCl equivalent) and heavier oxygen isotopic composition (delta O-18(water) = 7.8-11.7% V-SMOW) than formation water in the area (delta 18O(water) = -5- +7%c V-SMOW and 20-25wt.% NaCl equivalent); and contain CH4, H2S, CO2, C2H6 and C3H8 gases. This indicates that TSR occurred at a temperature range between 110 and 160 degreesC and less saline (fresh?) water was produced within the reservoirs during TSR. Water from the TSR reaction has locally diluted the formation water and, potentially, may have increased the TSR reaction rate because hydrocarbon solubility is greater in less saline water.The delta S-34 values of H2S gas increase with increasing H2S% in the gas fields and they approach the values of elemental sulphur (+25.4 to +26.4%, V-CDT). which in turn are similar to the values of anhydrite. The negative delta C-13 values of calcite (-23.9 to and -12.0% V-PDB) reflect incorporation of organic carbon from the isotopically light hydrocarbons. The occurence of light hydrocarbon gases (e.g. CH4, C2H6 and C3H8) in fluid inclusions in calcite suggests their participation in TSR.									30	7	0	0	1	0	37			0007-4802			WOS:000170190500006

PCC 7942. Measurements on the rates of oxygen evolution in the wild type and mutant cells in the presence of different concentrations of formate with a fixed bicarbonate concentration and vice versa, analyzed in terms of an equilibrium activator-inhibitor model, led to the conclusion that the equilibrium dissociation constant for bicarbonate is increased in the mutants, while that of the formate remains unchanged (11 +/- 0.5 mM). The hierarchy of the equilibrium dissociation constant for bicarbonate (highest to lowest, +/-2 muM) was: D1-F255L/S264A (46 muM) > D1-F255Y/S264A (31 muM) is similar to D1-S264A (34 muM) is similar to D1-F255Y (33 muM) > wild type (25 muM). The data suggest the importance of D1-S264 and D1-F255 in the bicarbonate binding niche. A possible involvement of bicarbonate and these two residues in the protonation of Q(B)-, the reduced secondary plastoquinone of PS II, in the D1 protein is discussed.									18	0	0	0	15	0	18			0166-8595			WOS:A1992KE44700013	24408835	
J	Zeng, Kai; Zhang, Dongke					Zhang, Dongke/0000-0003-0715-7986			Recent progress in alkaline water electrolysis for hydrogen production and applications								PROGRESS IN ENERGY AND COMBUSTION SCIENCE				36	3			307	326		10.1016/j.pecs.2009.11.002				JUN 2010	2010	Alkaline water electrolysis is one of the easiest methods for hydrogen production, offering the advantage of simplicity. The challenges for widespread use of water electrolysis are to reduce energy consumption, cost and maintenance and to increase reliability, durability and safety. This literature review examines the current state of knowledge and technology of hydrogen production by water electrolysis and identifies areas where R&D effort is needed in order to improve this technology. Following an overview of the fundamentals of alkaline water electrolysis, an electrical circuit analogy of resistances in the electrolysis system is introduced. The resistances are classified into three categories, namely the electrical resistances, the reaction resistances and the transport resistances. This is followed by a thorough analysis of each of the resistances, by means of thermodynamics and kinetics, to provide a scientific guidance to minimising the resistance in order to achieve a greater efficiency of alkaline water electrolysis. The thermodynamic analysis defines various electrolysis efficiencies based on theoretical energy input and cell voltage, respectively. These efficiencies are then employed to compare different electrolysis cell designs and to identify the means to overcome the key resistances for efficiency improvement. The kinetic analysis reveals the dependence of reaction resistances on the alkaline concentration, ion transfer, and reaction sites on the electrode surface, the latter is determined by the electrode materials. A quantitative relationship between the cell voltage components and current density is established, which links all the resistances and manifests the importance of reaction resistances and bubble resistances. The important effect of gas bubbles formed on the electrode surface and the need to minimise the ion transport resistance are highlighted. The historical development and continuous improvement in the alkaline water electrolysis technology are examined and different water electrolysis technologies are systematically compared using a set of the practical parameters derived from the thermodynamic and kinetic analyses. In addition to the efficiency improvements, the needs for reduction in equipment and maintenance costs, and improvement in reliability and durability are also established. The future research needs are also discussed from the aspects of electrode materials, electrolyte additives and bubble management, serving as a comprehensive guide for continuous development of the water electrolysis technology.

However, the realization of high-performance Mo2C catalysts is still limited because controlling their particle size and catalytic activity is challenging with current synthesis methods. Here, the synthesis of ultrafine beta-Mo2C nanoparticles with narrow size distribution (2.5 +/- 0.7 nm) and high mass loading (up to 27.5 wt%) on graphene substrate using a giant Mo-based polyoxomolybdate cluster, Mo-132((NH4)(42)[MO132O372(CH3COO)(30)(H2O)(72)]center dot 10CH(3)COONH(4)center dot 300 H2O) is demonstrated. Moreover, a nitrogen-containing polymeric binder (polyethyleneimine) is used to create Mo-N bonds between Mo2C nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped graphene layers, which significantly enhance the catalytic activity of Mo2C for the hydrogen evolution reaction, as is revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. The optimal Mo2C catalyst shows a large exchange current density of 1.19 mA cm(2), a high turnover frequency of 0.70 s(-1) as well as excellent durability. The demonstrated new strategy opens up the possibility of developing practical platinum substitutes based on Mo2C for various catalytic applications.									38	2	0	0	1	0	39			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000463290700016	30735307

Following the eruption, dust consisting of refractory silicate-rich dust grains containing a significant component of AlO bonding was formed sometime between 1998 and 2003. Observations using Spitzer between 2005 and 2009 show significant changes in the 10 mu m silicate stretch feature. There is a deepening of the 10 mu m silicate stretch as well as the development of a feature between about 13 and 20 mu m consistent with a blend of the MgO and FeO stretching features and the O-Si-O bending mode of increasingly ordered silicate dust. Near-infrared observations show the presence of AlO and water vapor in the outflow in 2003, 2004, and 2005: the AlO has significantly decreased in spectra obtained in 2014 while the water vapor remains largely unchanged. An attempt is made to correlate these observations and understand the significance of these changes using DUSTY modeling. The observations appear consistent with the kinetically controlled condensation of highly underoxidized SiO/AlO/Fe/Mg dust grains in the outflow followed by the continuous evolution of the initial condensate due to thermal annealing and oxidation of the dust via reaction with ambient O, OH, and H2O in the expanding, cooling shell. Periodic monitoring of this dust shell over the mid-infrared spectral range could yield useful information on the evolution of underoxidized silicate condensates exposed to hot water vapor in more conventional circumstellar environments.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000365317300027

The nature of the active site (gold oxidation state) and its modification along the course of the reaction are under discussion. In this work, we studied the modifications of a Au/CeO2 catalyst in the presence of gas-phase CO by simultaneous in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform mass spectrometry (DRIFT-MS) in isothermal conditions. Redox processes involving surface hydroxyl groups, gold atoms, and gas-phase CO molecules play a determinant role in surface gold dynamics. The interaction of CO with the catalyst surface results in the evolution Of CO2 and H-2 through both the decomposition of the formate species and the formation of the [Au(CO)(2)](+) species, which accounts for the redispersion of gold atoms. The identification of the involved surface species by DRIFT lets us state that a deep reduction of the surface (oxygen vacancy creation) changes the gold dispersion and migration of oxygen atoms to the surface, generating an oxidized gold species. This result is also confirmed by XRD, where a decrease in the intensity of all metallic gold diffraction peaks and the relative intensity among them is evidenced in the used catalyst. Therefore, this work provides evidence for the surface dynamics of gold in this Au/CeO2 catalyst and hence provides clues for understanding the modification of the catalytic activity of gold catalysts under cyclic operations.									74	2	0	0	4	1	74			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000249838300029

The results show that the morphologies of Ti/IrO2.Ta2O5 anodes are impacted by different pressures and grain size of sand-blasting. The pressure of sand-blasting contributes more to the roughness of Ti substrates than to the grain size of sand-blasting. The roughness of Ti substrate is directly proportional to the pressure of sand-blasting with on the same grain size. The crystallite grains of IrO2 become finer with increasing roughness of Ti base. The roughness of base metal has an influence on the nucleation and growth of IrO2 crystal grain, as well as the electrocatalytic activity and service life, however, not the biggest degree of roughness results in the most precipitation of IrO2, but the quantity of micro-ridges of coatings surface also contributes to the electrochemical activities and lifetime of Ti based anodes. The more the quantity of crystallization of IrO2 is, the more the oxygen evolution is. The roughness degree is not positively correlative to the lifetime of the anode. Among the four anodes, the anode coated on Ti substrate with roughness of 3.6 mum shows the best catalytic activity for oxygen evolution and the longest service life, which are improved by 7%~36% and 63%-72%, respectively.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1004-0609			INSPEC:11936274

Some of the NZVI advantages include; environmental friendliness, high reactivity and cost-effectiveness. NZVI was synthesized through the reduction of a ferric ion by sodium borohydride in anoxic medium and the resulting particles were characterized by the Transmission Electron Microscope with Energy-dispersive X-ray (TEM-EDX). The NZVI evolution and dissolution in water were examined through a series of batch experiments conducted in varying experimental conditions which include; pH, temperature, dosage, oxygen and interferences. The dissolution of iron was enhanced in the acidic pH due to the presence of H+ ions thus favoring release of hydrogen gas. More iron ions were present in the lowest temperature (5 degrees C) due to decreased crystallization and proton assisted dissolution. Furthermore, highest NZVI dosage (3 g/L) resulted in the highest iron ions concentrations in solution due to the increased number of nanoparticles hence providing surface-active sites. Ultimately, more iron ions were present in limited oxygen supply condition involving initial air saturation showed due to decreased crystallization and precipitation which were favored in continuous supply. These results are a useful guidance during real-life application of NZVI.									48	1	0	0	26	0	48				2213-3437		WOS:000449777200055

Precise synthesis of catalytically active nanostructures is one of the key challenges that hinder the practical application of many important energy-related electrocatalytic reactions. Compared with conventional wet-chemical, solid-state and vapor deposition synthesis, electrochemical synthesis is a simple, fast, cost-effective and precisely controllable method for the preparation of highly efficient catalytic materials. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the electrochemical synthesis of catalytic materials such as single atoms, spherical and shaped nanoparticles, nanosheets, nanowires, core-shell nanostructures, layered nanomaterials, dendritic nanostructures, hierarchically porous nanostructures as well as composite nanostructures. Fundamental aspects of electrochemical synthesis and several main electrochemical synthesis methods are discussed. Structure-performance correlations between electrochemically synthesized catalysts and their unique electrocatalytic properties are exemplified using selected examples. We offer the reader with a basic guide to the synthesis of highly efficient catalysts using electrochemical methods, and we propose some research challenges and future opportunities in this field.

J	Afrin, Sadia; Bollini, Praveen								A transient kinetic analysis of the evolution of a reducible metal oxide towards catalyzing nonoxidative alkanol dehydrogenation								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				393				290	302		10.1016/j.jcat.2020.08.023				JAN 2021	2021	Quantitative analyses of four sets of aerobic/anaerobic ethanol conversion transients point to the evolution of a native high-surface-area cerium oxide surface that effects the reduction half of the ethanol oxidation turnover to catalyzing, exclusively, nonoxidative ethanol dehydrogenation upon complete surface reduction. Aerobic-anaerobic switches at 498 K lead to new steady state dehydrogenation rates, rather than termination of catalytic acetaldehyde formation. Concurrent termination of oxygen imbalances (reflecting ceria reduction) and induction periods (reflecting active site creation) in anaerobic experiments point to ethanol dehydrogenation turnovers owing their provenance to surface reduction. Implausibly high vacancy densities obtained from analysis of oxygen imbalances when using acetaldehyde and CO2 formation rates, unlike those obtained when using water and CO2 formation rates, point to the catalytic origin of at least part of the acetaldehyde formed during both aerobic-anaerobic switches and anaerobic induction periods. Normalized water molar flow rates, used as a measure of the relative contributions of catalytic and stoichiometric routes to acetaldehyde formation, evince a transition from stoichiometric ethanol oxidation to catalytic ethanol dehydrogenation upon progressive surface reduction. Hightemperature hydrogen pretreatments can be used to manipulate both the initial contribution of ethanol dehydrogenation to overall acetaldehyde formation as well as the fractional surface reduction that ethanol, rather than molecular hydrogen, effectuates. Alpha hydrogen-free titrants such as phenol, on the other hand, can be used to titrate sites contributing to catalytic alkanol dehydrogenation without altering the prevalence of stoichiometric routes responsible for site creation in the first place. The combination of transient experiments used herein capture, with clarity, the evolution in catalytic function of highsurface-area cerium oxide toward ethanol upon progressive reduction that originates from its stoichiometric conversion over a native, fully oxidized surface. Not unimportantly, the results also point to an avenue for the water-free synthesis of alkanals over reducible metal oxides. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, the development of a general and simple strategy to synthesize metal nitrides remains challenging. Here we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of various porous monometallic and bimetallic nitrides on different substrates for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. The best monometallic nitride of CoN supported on the Ni foam delivered current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 95 and 212 mV, respectively in 1 M KOH. This performance was further improved through Ni-doping to form bimetallic nitrides of NiCoN, the best of which exhibited excellent HER performance with low overpotentials of 48 and 149 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, along with superior stability in 1 M KOH. The enhanced performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of Co and Ni, a larger surface area with more active sites, and improved electrical conductivity for more efficient charge transfer. This work demonstrates a particularly facile and general approach to synthesize porous transition metal nitrides with advanced HER performance.									70	7	0	0	0	0	70			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000483565400044

Here, we design and construct a direct Z-scheme van der Waals heterojunction composed by ultrathin WO3H2O and g-C3N4 nanosheets to achieve efficient overall water splitting without adding any sacrificial agents. This WO3H2O/g-C3N4 system can efficiently transport the electrons, which leading to a considerable improvement in the photocatalytic performance. Due to the suitable band edge potentials for H-2, O-2 evolution, and remarkable charge transfer, the direct WO3H2O/g-C3N4 Z-scheme system exhibits prominent photocatalytic activity for both H-2 and O-2 production under visible-light illumination, the H-2, O-2 production rate up to 482 and 232 mu molg(-1)h(-1) respectively, which is greatly higher than the H-2 evolution of g-C3N4 nanosheets (109 mu molh(-1)g(-1)) and the O-2 evolution of WO3H2O nanosheets (57 mu molh(-1)g(-1)) under the same condition. The measured quantum efficiency of the WO3H2O/g-C3N4 heterojunction reaches 6.2% at 420nm.									38	3	0	0	2	0	39			2367-198X			WOS:000443972900016

A feasible electrospinning strategy to construct a novel 1D hierarchical nanoarchitecture comprising Ni3Fe nanoalloy-encapsulated carbon nanotubes grown onto N-doped carbon nanofibers (abbreviated as Ni3Fe@N-C NT/NFs) is demonstrated here. Benefiting from the abundant firmly immobilized Ni3Fe nanoparticles for catalytic sites and hierarchical fibrous nanostructures for effective electron transport and mass diffusion, the resultant Ni3Fe@N-C NT/NFs display an extraordinary HER activity with a low overpotential of 72 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in KOH medium and a remarkable stability for 40 000 s. Theoretical studies corroborate that the resultant Ni3Fe@N-C NT/NFs exhibit a favorable Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H*) = -0.14 eV), further manifesting their superior HER activity. The present work will advance the development of highly efficient nonprecious electrocatalysts for energy conversion.									142	9	0	0	9	0	142			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000453604700024

XRD measurements confirmed the composition of the alloy as Pt3Co. Results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements showed that Pt3Co nanoparticles with an average size of 4 nm were uniformly assembled on the surface of CdS. It was found that the activity of Pt3Co-CdS was approximately two times higher than that of Pt-CdS for photocatalytic H-2 evolution. Photochemical measurements suggested that the high activity could be attributed to a better accumulation of photoexcited electrons and the higher conductivity of Pt3Co-CdS than that of Pt-CdS. The Pt3Co alloy cocatalyst was also loaded on TiO2, another widely used photocatalyst, and it also exhibited higher activity than pure Pt loaded on TiO2. This demonstrates the potential of Pt3Co as a universal cocatalyst.									64	2	0	0	5	0	65			2050-7488			WOS:000324553400029

Here, we describe the preparation of novel nanofibers (NF) made of Ni/Gd2O3/NiO heterostructures by electrospinning. The fabricated materials showed high electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with onset potential values of 89 mV, which are very close to those of platinum (Pt). NiO chemical and electronic properties were successfully optimized in Ni/Gd2O3/NiO coaxial heterostructures; NiO NFs doped with Gd3+ significantly enhanced its electrical conductivity and promoted HER reaction kinetics. These NFs offer the distinct advantages of long-term durability and readiness for hydrogen production via HER, and also better performance than benchmark Pt catalysts. The successful fabrication of these metal oxide NFs and nanostructures may represent a new approach for the rational synthesis of efficient HER catalysts. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

These chemical reactions lead to the formation of intermediates that occurs in the process of deposition onto nuclei during the reduction. The understanding of these chemical reactions would enable a better design of functional metal nanocrystals, even those with unconventional hierarchical morphologies. In this study, we report the formation of dish-shaped nanostructures of palladium (Pd) obtained from palladium acetylacetonate (Pd(acac)(2)) in the presence of oleylamine and oleic acid. The process was correlated with the kinetic-controlled evolution of two-dimensional (2D) Pd nanosheets. The formation of Pd-ligand complexes was revealed using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. These intermediates affected the formation kinetics of the 2D nanostructures and higher-ordered morphology of the nanodishes.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000433048600044

Herein, a novel cobalt boride/graphitic carbon nitride nanosheet (CoB/CNs) Schottky junction with interfacial Co-N bond was successfully prepared to uncover the function of interfacial chemical bond in photocatalytic antibacterial process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation and experimental investigation demonstrate that the interfacial Co-N bond can act as an electron transfer channel to efficiently steer the electron transfer from CNs to CoB, and then an upward band bending with the height of 0.26 eV is formed in CoB/CNs Schottky junction. The formed upward band bending can rapidly separate the photogenerated electron-hole pairs by preventing electrons from flowing back to the CNs, which causes the surface electron transfer efficiency (eta trans) to increases from 41.8% (CNs) to 57.7% (CoB/CNs-2). Rotating disk electrode (RDE) results demonstrate that compared with CNs (n = 2.38), the oxygen reduction reaction in CoB/CNs-2 (n = 2.19) is more selective to a two-electron transfer route. Meanwhile, further research on reactive oxygen species reveals that it is an indirect two-step single-electron oxygen reduction process, which is beneficial for the generation of O2- and H2O2. As a result, 7 x 107 CFU/mL of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) can be completely inactivated by CoB/CNs-2 with 125 min under visible light irradiation. It is expected that our work will provide some guidance for the exploitation of more advanced hybrid photocatalysts system through interfacial engineering.									24	0	0	0	6	0	24			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000672587400006

Herein, a highly active and stable electrocatalyst of MoC encapsulated by graphitized carbon shells (nanoMoC@GS) has been developed via an in situ carburization of a Mo-based metal-organic framework (Mo-MOF) with the atomic periodic structure. The ultrafine MoC nanoparticles (similar to 3 nm) confined by 1-3 layered graphite shells significantly favor the efficient HER in both acidic and basic media. In particular, a low overpotential (eta(10) = 124 and 77 mV at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2)), a small Tafel slope (43 and 50 mV dec(-1)) and a high exchange current density (j(0) = 0.015 and 0.212 mA cm(-2)) are achieved on nanoMoC@GS in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Such remarkable activity, outperforming most current noble-metal-free electrocatalysts, stems from the cooperative/synergistic effects of ultrafine MoC nanostructure, ultrathin and conductive graphitized carbon shells, and enriched porosity. This work demonstrates a feasible way to design high-performance electrocatalysts via converting "atomic contact" hybrid structures (e.g., MOFs), illustrating a new perspective for developing nanocatalysts in the energy chemistry field.									158	7	0	0	8	0	161			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000374790700030

How. ever, the current researches mainly focus on the regulation of the atom type of the active center of M-N-C, and under. estimate the effect of the coordination environment and distribution of the active sites on their catalytic performance. A typical diatomic site M-N-C catalyst (NiFe-N-C) was selected as the research object, and the electrocatalytic CO2RR reaction mechanism of nine types of NiFe-N-C catalysts with different coordination environments at active sites were systematically investigated by the density functional theory (DFT) method. The results show that with the increase of the coordination number of metal atoms and the distance between diatomic sites,the stability of M-N-C catalysts, the catalytic activity of CO2 reduction to CO, and the selectivity of inhibiting hydrogen evolution reaction all show a trend of increasing first and then decreasing. Among them, the NiFe-N-C-model 3 catalyst with four-coordi. nated and symmetrically distributed metal atoms exhibits the best catalytic performance due to the strong interaction of the diatomic sites. This study provides theoretical support for the precise regulation of active sites in diatomic site M-N-C catalysts and the rational design of CO2RR catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0251-0790			WOS:000765114700017

Radmer and O. Ollinger, 1986, FEBS Lett 195: 285-289; K.P. Bader, P. Thibault and G.H. Schmid, 1987, Biochim Biophys Acta 893: 564-571). In the present study, isotope exchange experiments with (H2O)-O-18 were performed under different experimental conditions. We found: a) the isotope exchange pattern is virtually the same at both pH 6.0 and 7.8, although marked structural changes of the PS II donor side are inferred to take place within this pH-range (Renger G., Messinger J. and Wacker U., 1992, Research in Photosynthesis, II: 329-332); b) injection of (H2O)-O-18 at about O degrees C gives rise to mass ratios of the evolved oxygen which markedly deviate from the theoretically expected values of complete isotope scrambling; and c) rapid injection of (H2O)-O-18 into samples with high population of S-1 and S-2 and subsequent illumination with three and two flashes, respectively, spaced by a dark time of only 1.5 ms lead to similar O-18-labeling of the evolved oxygen. Based on the published data on the interaction with redox active amines, possible pathways of substrate exchange in the water oxidase are discussed.									26	1	0	0	18	0	28			0166-8595			WOS:A1993MX41700016	24317990

Recent experimental studies have revealed the importance of surface deprotonation and alkali metal cation adsorption on the activity of Ni oxide surfaces, in contact with aqueous alkaline electrolyte. As a first step to elucidate the role of the alkali adsorption for the activity, we performed first-principles electronic structure calculations to address the stable surface structures of beta-NiOOH(0001) as a function of the operating conditions in an electrochemical environment. We present a grand-canonical approach to compute the surface Pourbaix diagram of the beta-NiOOH/water interface for the processes of deprotonation and alkali metal cation adsorption. The results of this study emphasize the importance of double-layer effects, including the adsorbate-induced change of surface dipole moments and the rearrangement of water molecules due to their strong interaction with the adsorbed species, for the most stable interface structure.

In this study, the well-defined Co3O4 cubes with exposed (001) plane and octahedrons with exposed (111) plane have been successfully synthesized and the facet-dependent electrocatalytic performance of Co3O4 for rechargeable Li-O-2 battery has been comprehensively investigated by the combination of experiments and theoretical calculations. The Li-O-2 battery cathode catalyzed by Co3O4 octahedron with exposed (111) plane shows much higher specific capacity, cycling performance, and rate capability than Co3O4 cube with exposed (001) plane, which may be largely attributed to the richer Co2+ and more active sites on (111) plane of Co3O4 octahedrons. The DFT-based first-principles calculations further indicate that Co3O4 (111) has a lower activation barrier of O-2 desorption in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than Co3O4 (001), which is very important to refresh active sites of catalyst and generate a better cyclic performance. Also, our calculations indicate that Co3O4 (111) surface has a stronger absorption ability for Li2O2 than Co3O4 (001), which may be an explanation for a larger initial capacity in Co3O4 (111) plane by experimental observation.									82	10	0	0	7	0	86			1932-7447			WOS:000350840700008

Here, we report a versatile and general method for synthesizing nanosized perovskite oxides. Specifically, we used bimetallic "LaMnOx" oxide nanoparticles as the precursors to synthesize r-LaMnO3 +/-delta perovskite oxide aerogels by way of a solid-state gelation process, generating aerogels with specific surface areas exceeding 74.2 m(2) g(oxide)(-1). The r-LaMnO3 +/-delta aerogel featured an increased Mn valence state compared to the bulk form of the material, facilitating the oxygen reduction reaction kinetics in alkaline medium. At 0.8 V-RHE, the r-LaMnO3 +/-delta aerogel achieved a mass activity of 66.2 A g(oxide)(-1) which is 153-fold higher mass activity compared to the conventional bulk LaMnO3. The solid-state gelation synthesis route was extended to other perovskite oxides with high compositional diversity, including LaMnO3, LaFeO3, LaNiO3, LaCoO3, La0.5Sr0.5CoO3, and La0.5Sr0.5Co0.5Fe0.5O3, thereby demonstrating the versatile nature of our synthetic route for the fabrication of a wide range of nanostructured perovskite oxides.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000500039100022		
J	Derrouiche, S; Bianchi, D								Experiments and kinetic model regarding the induction period observed during the oxidation by O-2 of adsorbed CO species on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				230	2			359	374		10.1016/j.jcat.2004.12.011				MAR 10 2005	2005	The present study concerns the characterization, by experiments in the transient regime, at atmospheric pressure, with either a Fourier transform infrared or a mass spectrometer as a detector, of the elementary steps involved in the isothermal oxidation at To lower than 360 K of the superficial species formed by adsorption of CO on reduced Pt/Al2O3 catalysts: linear, bridged, and threefold coordinated CO species. The coverages of the adsorbed species and the rate of the CO2 production are determined during successive adsorption, desorption, and oxidation reactions for different durations. The evolution of the rate of the CO2 production with the duration of the oxidation, RCO2(t), presents a variety of profiles, depending on the Pt dispersion of the catalysts. For Pt dispersions higher than 0.6, an induction period is observed and the RCO2(t) profile is characterized by a peak with a maximum defined by t(m) and RCO2(m). The greater the Pt dispersion is, the longer t(m) is and the lower RCO2(m) is. For Pt dispersions lower than 0.6, the RCO2(t) profile is similar to a decreasing exponential, and its highest value is observed at time 0 of the oxidation. The induction period observed for Pt dispersions higher than 0.6 allows us to characterize the Langmuir-Hinshelwood steps between the adsorbed CO and oxygen species by studying the impacts on tm and RCO2(m) of different experimental parameters such as the Pt dispersion, the oxidation temperature, the oxygen partial pressure, and the duration of a desorption stage before oxidation. A kinetic model based on the oxidation of the LCO species by a weakly adsorbed oxygen species formed on the Pt-0 sites liberated by the removal of the bridged CO species provides a set of mathematical expressions that provide a reasonable explanation of the impacts of the various experimental parameters on tm and RCO2(m). As a consequence, this kinetic model reveals how the Pt dispersion affects the elementary step and the turnover frequency of the CO/O-2 reaction. A comparison of the present study with similar literature data on a single Pt crystal shows that the differences in the experimental conditions, material and pressure gaps, may lead to a situation in which the Langmuir-Hinshelwood steps that are studied are not the same.

J	Poudyal, Samiksha; Laursen, Siris				Poudyal, Samiksha/Q-5029-2019				Photocatalytic CO2 reduction by H2O: insights from modeling electronically relaxed mechanisms								CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				9	4			1048	1059		10.1039/c8cy02046a				FEB 21 2019	2019	A detailed understanding of the mechanism for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 by H2O is required to facilitate the development of catalysts that exhibit improved activity, controlled product distributions, and enhanced quantum yield. As the reaction assuredly contains many more reaction intermediates than the well-studied water-splitting reaction, the effect of catalyst surface reactivity may be quite pronounced. The reaction mechanism may also contain electronically relaxed intermediates that are driven through the reaction via non-photoelectrochemical steps. We have investigated the ground-state surface reaction mechanism for CO2 reduction over SiC and GaN using DFT modeling. Results were correlated with experimentally observed catalyst performance at near-ambient and elevated temperatures and in condensed and gas phase H2O conditions. Positive correlations suggest photocatalyst surface reactivity may play a role in C-O cleavage and stabilizing reaction intermediates to promote CH4 production. Electronic analysis indicated protonic H+ from H2O dissociation would relax to neutral H-0 over SiC - an effect that correlated with elevated performance in CH4 production. Less stable H+ over GaN also correlated with a selectivity preference for H-2 production. Overall, results suggest that alternative factors beyond bulk electronic structure dictate photocatalytic activity in this reaction.									17	2	0	0	2	0	18			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000459893900012

Herein, we present a DFT study of electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction (eNRR) on W-4 tetrahedron embedded in graphene-like C2N (denoted as W-4@C2N). Our results demonstrate that N-affinity of active sites on W-4 dominate over single-atom site, rendering *NH2 + (H+ + e(-)) ->*NH3 invariably the potential-determining step (PDS) of eNRR via consecutive or distal route (U (L) = -0.68 V) to ammonia formation. However, *NHNH2 + (H+ + e(-)) ->*NH2NH2 has become the PDS (U (L) = -0.54 V) via enzymatic route towards NH2NH2 formation and thereafter desorption, making W-4@C2N a potentially promising catalyst for hydrazine production from eNRR. Furthermore, eNRR is competitive with hydrogen evolution reaction (U (L) = -0.78 V) on W-4@C2N, which demonstrated sufficient thermal stability and electric property for electrode application.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000773100900001	35259738

Estimating the content of active PSII reaction centers in a liquid sample is a key input for estimating aquatic photosynthesis rates, as well as for analyzing phytoplankton stress responses. Established procedures for PSII content quantification based on oxygen evolution are slow, imprecise and require dense cell suspensions, and are thus inapplicable to many laboratory or field studies. A new approach uses baseline chlorophyll fluorescence emission divided by the effective absorbance cross section for PSII photochemistry, with both variables derivable from single turnover fluorescence induction protocols. This approach has not been widely tested and is potentially subject to variation in samples suffering progressive photoinactivation or induction of non- photochemical quenching under variable light. We evaluated the validity of this approach for a marine picocyanobacteria, low and high light Prochlorococcus ecotypes, arctic and temperate prasinophyte green alga and two centric diatoms, generating 209 paired determinations from a range of growth and treatment conditions. We successfully calibrated the fluorescence derived estimator for PSII reaction center content, and demonstrate a modification that corrects for the short term influence of photoinactivation. The modified parameter shows little response to induction of non-photochemical quenching. In doing so we show the potential and limitations of an estimator of active PSII reaction center content that is sufficiently robust to support rapid, time-resolved autonomous measures of primary productivity from lakes and oceans.									17	0	0	0	15	0	17			1541-5856			WOS:000394962100004

Tamone, Sherry/0000-0002-7839-3567			Linking Insects with Crustacea: Physiology of the Pancrustacea: An Introduction to the Symposium								INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY				55	5			765	770		10.1093/icb/icv093				NOV 2015	2015	Insects and crustaceans represent critical, dominant animal groups (by biomass and species number) in terrestrial and aquatic systems, respectively. Insects (hexapods) and crustaceans are historically grouped under separate taxonomic classes within the Phylum Arthropoda, and the research communities studying hexapods and crustaceans are quite distinct. More recently, the hexapods have been shown to be evolutionarily derived from basal crustaceans, and the clade Pancrustacea recognizes this relationship. This recent evolutionary perspective, and the fact that the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology has strong communities in both invertebrate biology and insect physiology, provides the motivation for this symposium. Speakers in this symposium were selected because of their expertise in a particular field of insect or crustacean physiology, and paired in such a way as to provide a comparative view of the state of the current research in their respective fields. Presenters discussed what aspects of the physiological system are clearly conserved across insects and crustaceans and how cross-talk between researchers utilizing insects and crustaceans can fertilize understanding of such conserved systems. Speakers were also asked to identify strategies that would enable improved understanding of the evolution of physiological systems of the terrestrial insects from the aquatic crustaceans. The following collection of articles describes multiple recent advances in our understanding of Pancrustacean physiology.									9	0	0	0	7	0	9			1540-7063	1557-7023		WOS:000362900500001	26251464

The seed abundances are obtained by calculating the s-process nucleosynthesis that is expected to occur in the repeating helium shell flashes on the carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarf (WD) during mass accretion from a binary companion. When the deflagration wave passes through the outer layer of the COWD, p-nuclei are produced by photodisintegration reactions on s-nuclei in a region where the peak temperature ranges from 1.9 to 3.6 x 10(9) K. We confirm the sensitivity of the p-process on the initial distribution of s-nuclei. We show that the initial C/O ratio in the WD does not affect much the yield of p-nuclei. On the other hand, the abundance of Ne-22 left after s-processing has a large influence on the p-process via the 22Ne(alpha,n) reaction. We find that about 50% of p-nuclides are co-produced when normalized to their solar abundances in all adopted cases of seed distribution. Mo and Ru, which are largely underproduced in Type II supernovae (SNe II), are produced more than in SNe II although they are underproduced with respect to the yield levels of other p-nuclides. The ratios between p-nuclei and iron in the ejecta are larger than the solar ratios by a factor of 1.2. We also compare the yields of oxygen, iron, and p-nuclides in SNe Ia and SNe II and suggest that SNe Ia could make a larger contribution than SNe II to the solar system content of p-nuclei.									42	1	0	0	1	0	42			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000285411300025

Nevertheless, a quantitative description of complicated transfer and reaction rates of the oxidation of graphite is still not available, which essentially hinders large-scale production of high-quality GO and other graphene related materials. In this work, GO is prepared from flake graphite (FG) by a modified Hummers method. Size and color evolutions of time-dependent complementary domains, i.e. the starting GO domain and the remaining FG domain, are monitored during the entire oxidation process. The oxidation of FG in acidic oxidizing medium can be interpreted as a contracting area process controlled by phase boundary. Reaction rate constant (k) and kinetic parameters (Ea, lnA) are obtained after a systematic investigation of the influence of reaction temperature, concentration of sulfuric acid, and oxidizing agent on the oxidation, with the aid of R2 mathematical model. Using the kinetic results, the oxidation process and the conversion rate from FG to GO thus become controllable. Both intermediate products and final GO products are studied using XRD, TGA, and XPS to reveal the oxidation mechanism. The degree of oxidation of FG and the content of major functional groups on the surface of products can thus be optimized. Our research results are valuable to understanding fundamental mechanism of graphite oxidation and to achieving industrial production of high-quality GO with controllable degree of oxidation and tunable proportion of oxygen-containing functional groups for a variety of applications.

Herein, we propose a facile self-template pyrolysis strategy at high temperature to synthesize one-dimensionally holey Pt nanotubes (Pt-hNTs) using PtII-dimethylglyoxime complex (PtII-DMG) nanorods as the reaction precursor. The coordination capability of DMG results in the generation of PtII-DMG nanorods, whereas the reducibility of DMG at high temperature leads to the reduction of PtII species in PtII-DMG nanorods. During the reaction process, the inside-out Ostwald ripening phenomenon leads to the hollow morphology of Pt-hNTs. Benefiting from the physical characteristics of hollow and holey structure, Pt-hNTs with clean surface show superior electroactivity and durability for catalyzing ethanol electrooxidation as well as hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media. Under optimized experimental conditions, the constructed symmetric Pt-hNTs||Pt-hNTs ethanol electrolyzer only requires an electrolysis voltage of 0.40 V to achieve the electrochemical hydrogen production, demonstrating a highly energy saving strategy relative to traditional water electrolysis.

Acute toxicity assessment of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) on the oxygen flux of the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium instriatum								ECOTOXICOLOGY				25	1			248	252		10.1007/s10646-015-1564-z				JAN 2016	2016	Despite the ubiquitous occurrence of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) in aquatic systems, assessments evaluating the toxicity of DEET on phytoplankton species are summed to a single study on a unicellular green alga. In particular, the toxicological effects of DEET in dinoflagellates are unknown. In this study, we employed the mixotrophic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium instriatum as a study system to evaluate acute effects of DEET on the oxygen flux of laboratory cultures. This study reports an inhibitory reaction model of DEET described by the equation y = 4.99x(0.54), where y represents the percent inhibition of oxygen flux and x represents DEET concentration in mg L-1 (r(2) = 0.98). Based on this model, the effective concentration of DEET needed to reduce O-2 flux by 50 % (EC50) for this species was found to be at 72.9 mg L-1. The reported EC50 is more than five times lower than the EC50 reported previously for the unicellular green algae Chlorella protothecoides. This study raises the question of the potential toxicological effects of DEET in dinoflagellates, in particular those populations inhabiting systems characterized by low water circulation such as enclosed bays and lagoons.									8	1	0	0	8	0	9			0963-9292	1573-3017		WOS:000370715500023	26467804

A simple and scalable synthetic route is demonstrated for the preparation of a novel 3D hybrid nanocatalyst consisting of Co9S8 nanoparticles which are incorporated in N, S-doped carbon (N, S-C) with rational structure design. In particular, the hybrid catalyst is prepared by direct pyrolysis and calcination of a gel mixture of Mg, Co nitrate-thiourea-glycine under Ar atmosphere, with subsequent HCl washing. The properties of obtained hybrid catalyst are quite dependent on calcination temperature and added glycine amount. Under a molar ratio of Co5-Mg15-tu10-gl45 and a calcination temperature of 900 degrees C, Co9S8 nanoparticles are embedded in a well-developed carbon matrix which shows a porous 3D few-layer graphene-like N, S-C with open and hierarchical micro-meso-macro pore structure. Because of the synergistic effect between Co9S8 nanoparticles and well-developed carbon support, the composite exhibits high ORR activity close to that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. More importantly, the composite displays superior long-term stability and good tolerance against methanol. The strategy developed here provides a novel and efficient approach to prepare a cost-effective and highly active ORR electrocatalyst.									24	0	0	0	1	0	24			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000418244400009
