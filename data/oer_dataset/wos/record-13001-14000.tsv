The lowest overpotentials are observed for (La0.3Sr0.7)(0.97)CoO3-delta, which exhibits a significant oxygen deficiency in combination with high conductivity associated with the A-site cation nonstoichiometry compensation mechanism via Co4+ formation. Perovskite-type cobaltite anodes are essentially stable in alkaline solutions, whilst La2NiO4-based electrodes exhibit degradation at the potentials where the oxygen evolution occurs, probably due to the electrochemical oxygen intercalation in the lattice.					3rd International Materials Symposium/12th Meeting of the Sociedad-Portuguesa-da-Materials (Materials 2005/SPM)3rd International Materials Symposium/12th Meeting of the Sociedad-Portuguesa-da-Materials (Materials 2005/SPM)	MAR 20-23, 2005MAR 20-23, 2005	Portuguese Mat Soc; Mat Network Atlantic Arc; CiCECO; BPI; Bayer Mat Sci; DURIT; IZASA; GIC; Novagres; Rauschert; CRIOLAB CRYOGENICS Vacuum Syst Vacuum Chambers; FCT; NTI EUROPE; Fdn Calouste Gulbenkian; ScienTec; ThermoLab; Papelave; cienciapt net; Air LiquidePortuguese Mat Soc; Mat Network Atlantic Arc; CiCECO; BPI; Bayer Mat Sci; DURIT; IZASA; GIC; Novagres; Rauschert; CRIOLAB CRYOGENICS Vacuum Syst Vacuum Chambers; FCT; NTI EUROPE; Fdn Calouste Gulbenkian; ScienTec; ThermoLab; Papelave; cienciapt net; Air Liquide	Univ Aveiro, Aveiro, PORTUGALUniv Aveiro, Aveiro, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0255-5476		*************	WOS:000238056400276

Herein, a series of transition metal sulphide-based nanostructures, including Au-CoNi2S4 core-shell, Au-NiS core-shell, Au-Co3S4 core-shell, and bare CoNi2S4 nanoparticles (NPs), have been rationally designed. Among them, the Au-CoNi2S4 core-shell NPs exhibit superior electrocatalytic properties for oxygen evolution. It requires an overpotential of only 264 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), while the Tafel slope (35.6 mV dec(-1)) is also the lowest among the as-prepared nanostructures. X-ray photoelectron spectra and electrochemical impedance spectra demonstrate that the electronic structure and chemical state of Au-CoNi2S4 core-shell heterostructure are regulated by the delicate structural design. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance of the Au-CoNi2S4 core-shell heterostructure can be attributed to the combined effects of constructing bimetallic sulphide instead of its monometallic counterparts and forming metal-sulphide core-shell interface. It provides a way to develop a superior electrocatalyst by constructing a metal-bimetallic sulphide core-shell heterostructure.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000682152500001		
J	Zhang, Yingjie; Liu, Zhuo; Guo, Fei; Li, Mian; Bo, Xiangjie								Morphological modulation of iron carbide embedded nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous carbon by manganese doping as highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting								JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				618				149	160		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.03.045				JUL 15 2022	2022	In the development of water splitting, the sluggish electrocatalytic kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have restricted their energy conversion efficiencies. Along with the continuous rise in the prices of noble metals and transition metals (such as cobalt and nickel), constructing high-efficiency HER/OER catalysts based on low cost transition metals, such as iron and manganese, is becoming more meaningful in developing industrialized water splitting devices. In this paper, in the absence of a template or active agent, three-dimensional, hierarchically porous FexMny nanoparticles (NPs) were embedded and nitrogen-doped carbon materials (denoted as Fe(x)Mny@NC; x: y, representing the molar ratio of Fe:Mn) were successfully prepared via pyrolysis of corresponding precursors containing different metallic salt components. Various morphological, structural, and chemical characterization analysis demonstrate that at an Fe:Mn molar ratio of 3:1, the optimal Fe3Mn1@NC material shows high graphitization degree, rich mesoporous structures, a large surface area, and abundant carbon defects/edges, which promote the uniform dispersion of pyridinic-N (pyridinic-N-metal), graphitic N, carbon oxygen bonds (CAO), manganese oxide (MnO) nanocrystals, and Fe3C NPs-embedded, N-doped carbon sheet (Fe3C@NC) active sites. In alkaline conditions, the HER onset potentials (Eonset) and potentials recorded at 10 mA cm-2 (E10) of the optimal Fe3Mn1@NC are just 84.8 and 156 mV more negative than those of 20 wt% platinum carbon (Pt/C). Meanwhile, the OER Eonset and E10 values of the optimal Fe(3)Mn1@NC are just 8 and 18.7 mV more positive than those of RuO2. Furthermore, optimized Fe3Mn1@NC catalysts were assembled into a water splitting cell, where the catalytic current density achieves 10 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of 1.6287 V (with superior catalytic stability), which is just 24.9 mV higher than that of the (-) 20 wt% Pt/C||RuO2 (+) benchmark (1.6038 V) under the same conditions. This work describes the regulating efficiency of Mn toward growing mesopores and opens new possibilities for the development of novel carbonaceous catalysts with excellent hydroxide catalytic efficiencies based on low cost Mn/Fe elements.

Understanding the underlying physics of superior endurance in Bi-layered TaOX-RRAM								2015 Silicon Nanoelectronics Workshop (SNW)								1	2						2015	2015	A comprehensive physical model is introduced to account for the superior endurance characteristics of TaOX-based RRAM with bi-layered Ta2O5-X/TaO2-X stack by considering the influence of oxygen content in TaO2-X layer. In the physical model, the TaO2-X layer acts as an oxygen reservoir to store and release oxygen ions (O2-) during switching cycles and different oxygen contents in TaO2-X layer correspond to different capabilities to take redox reactions with O2-. The proposed model is implemented into an atomic Monte-Carlo simulator involving the evolution of oxygen distribution in Ta2O5-X/TaO2-X stack to reproduce the impacts of different TaO2-X layers on endurance performance. Results reveal that the optimized TaO2-X layer with the feature of easily storing O2- as lattice oxygen (LO) during SET and decomposing to release O2- during RESET is beneficial to enhance the endurance property.					2015 Silicon Nanoelectronics Workshop (SNW)2015 Silicon Nanoelectronics Workshop (SNW)	14-15 June 201514-15 June 2015	IEEE Electron Dev.

Herein, we designed an ideal Co phosphate-based platform to explore the effect of coordination environment on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The cobalt geometry was modulated from octahedral to tetrahedral by simple removal of water ligands in Co-3(PO4)(2).8 H2O. Other features except the coordination structure in the two autologous materials remain similar. The two analogues display the same OER kinetics, but the anhydrous Co-3(PO4)(2) exhibits a greatly enhanced OER activity. On the basis of Raman and operando XAS results, the higher intrinsic activity of the Co tetrahedral sites is because they facilitate the formation of active high valent cobalt (hydr)oxide intermediates during OER. This work not only brings insights of OER on Co-based electrocatalysts but also provides a reference system to study the effect of metal geometry on electrocatalysis.									48	6	0	0	2	0	49			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000521800300001	32112670

Transition metal sulfides usually undergo phase evolution during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), making the resulting electrocatalysts unstable. Here we report the synthesis of Co-doped (Ni, Fe)1+xS (denoted as FeCoNiS), and that its derived electrocatalyst exhibited remarkably high OER activity and excellent stability with an overpotential of 164 mV for 10 mA cm-2 and a steady-state current density of 100 mA cm-2 for up to 2200 h. The impressive OER performance can be attributed to the electronic structure regulation of (Ni, Fe)1+xS via Co doping and the formation of polysulfides (Sn2-). Promisingly, a device assembled using FeCoNiS and MoNi4/MoO2 two electrodes delivered a current density of 100 mA cm-2 at a low potential of 1.60 V for overall water splitting and worked stably for 1200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm-2.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) provides a promising route for depositing uniform thin coatings of electrocatalysts, which are useful in many technologies, including the splitting of water. In this communication, we report the growth of a NiO/Ni catalyst directly on carbon fiber paper by atomic layer deposition and report subsequent reduction and oxidation annealing treatments. The 10-20 nm NiO/Ni nanoparticle catalysts can reach a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) at an overpotential of 189 mV for hydrogen evolution reactions and 257 mV for oxygen evolution reactions with high stability. We further successfully achieved a water splitting current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) at 1.78 V using a typical NiO/Ni coated carbon fiber paper two-electrode setup. The results suggest that nanoparticulate NiO/Ni is an active, stable, and noble-metal-free electrocatalyst, which facilitates a method for future water splitting applications.									18	2	0	0	0	0	18			1996-1944			WOS:000394838800015	28772376

XRD and TEM analysis indicate small crystallites of MnCo2O4 forming ultra-thin layer of irregular structures that lead to porous morphology. A slightly larger crystallite size was observed for MnCr2O4. The surface oxygen defect in MnCo2O4 is much higher than MnCr2O4 that enhances the active sites for the oxygen adsorption and promotes fast dissociation in presence of more exposed Mn/Co sites during the oxygen electrocatalysis. The electrochemical properties of the synthesized catalysts were analysed using CV, LSV, EIS and CA showing high limiting current density and kinetic current density, positive onset and halfwave potential and higher number of overall electron transfer in MnCo2O4 that MnCr2O4. Chronoamperometric (CA) runs for 24 h shows excellent stability of MnCo2O4 without any significant decrease in the current or potential value in ORR and OER. On basis of the activity and stability performance, MnCo2O4 shows to be a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst, with significantly improved performance than previously reported Mn and Co mixed oxides, and comparable to Pt and Ru based catalysts in terms of durability, onset potential and Tafel slope.

To date manganese(V)-oxo corrole has successfully mimicked the oxygen evolution reaction. We report here ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer (ET) in corrole manganese (Mn) complexes. With femtosecond spectroscopy, the evolutions of transient absorption spectra of three kinds of Mn(V)-oxo corroles were measured. A similar to 0.17 ps ET process has been observed in (OHF10C)Mn-V(O) after photoexcitation at 400 nm, which is absent for (F15C)Mn-V(O) and (F10C)Mn-V(O). The back ET is different from that of Mn(III) corrole ((OHF10C)Mn-III), being a similar to 12.3 ps ET followed by a very long ground-state recovery. The mechanism of the ET observed in (OHF10C)Mn-V(O) has been discussed. The result reveals that the natural O-O bond formation may include ultrafast ET among the calcium-ligated hydroxide, Mn(V), and the oxygen bound to the metal ion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2367-0932			WOS:000616175500001

A large amount of oxygen is stored in the lunar regolith in the form of oxides. Many efforts have been devoted to electrochemically splitting oxides to oxygen and metals in molten oxides and molten salts. However, a cheap oxygen-evolution inert anode is still a serious challenge, especially in the supercorrosive molten halides. Herein, we combine a molten CaCl2 electrolyzer that can convert Chang'e-5 lunar regolith simulants to metals and CO2 using a carbon anode and a molten carbonate electrolyzer that can convert the generated CO2 to carbon and oxygen using a cheap Ni11Fe10Cu oxygen-evolution anode. Further, the electrolytic carbon is reused as the anode in the molten CaCl2 electrolyzer, thereby closing the carbon cycle. Hence, the overall electrochemical reaction of the dual-electrolyzer system is to convert lunar regolith to metals and oxygen. More broadly, this system can convert the CO2 generated by humans living on the Moon and Mars to oxygen and carbon materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000874043400001

J	BARR, DP; SHAH, MM; AUST, SD								VERATRYL ALCOHOL-DEPENDENT PRODUCTION OF MOLECULAR-OXYGEN BY LIGNIN PEROXIDASE								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				268	1			241	244						JAN 5 1993	1993	Veratryl alcohol- and H2O2-dependent production of oxygen by lignin peroxidase isozyme H2 (LiPH2) from Phanerochaete chrysosporium was investigated. Veratryl alcohol oxidation by LiPH2 decreased with increasing concentrations of H2O2 while oxygen evolution increased. The absorption spectrum of the LiPH2 in these experiments indicated that it was in the compound Il state. We propose that O2 production results from the one electron oxidation of H2O2 by the veratryl alcohol cation radical to yield superoxide, as the addition of superoxide dismutase stimulated oxygen production. It has been reported previously that oxygen is consumed in reaction mixtures containing lignin peroxidase, H2O2, veratryl alcohol, and oxalate (Popp, J. L., Kalyanaraman, B., and Kirk, T. K. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 10475-10480). In the presence of oxalate, we observed oxygen consumption that was dependent on the H2O2 concentration. The ability of other methoxybenzenes to mediate oxygen production appeared to be related to their redox potential. It was concluded that cation radicals can oxidize H2O2 by one electron which results in the production of superoxide and the evolution of molecular oxygen. Thus, the rates of LiPH2-catalyzed O2 Consumption or O2 production are dependent on the relative concentrations of H2O2 and oxalate.									15	0	0	0	10	0	17			0021-9258			WOS:A1993KE60300038	8416932

It is a convenient way to couple late transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni) with carbon nanomaterials, as their proximity not only improves the catalytic performance through their synergistic effect but also provides a cost-effective preparation process compared with precious metals (e.g., Pt, Ru, and Ir). Herein, FeCoNi alloy nanoparticles embedded in a nitrogen-doped carbon shell (NC) were synthesized via a simple one-step chemical reaction of three metal salts (Fe, Co, and Ni) and two organic linkers (2-methylimidazole and 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid dipotassium) followed by pyrolysis. The as-synthesized catalyst with an optimized composition (Fe1.0Co1.1Ni1.4-NC) required overpotentials of 270 mV and 175 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Moreover, the catalyst demonstrated ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) activity by achieving a 9% less positive onset potential than for the OER in 1.0 M KOH + 1.0 M C2H5OH electrolyte. The high catalytic activity of Fe1.0Co1.1Ni1.4-NC was intrinsically associated with the presence of Fe+3 species as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. When the catalyst Fe1.0Co1.1Ni1.4-NC comprised both the anode and cathode in a prototype electrolytic cell for overall water splitting, it required 1.52 V vs. RHE to reach a 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 1.0 M KOH, outperforming the benchmark IrO2 (or RuO2)||Pt/C coupled cells.									42	2	0	0	4	0	42			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536095500020

A minute amount of oxygen in the atmosphere caused the active oxidation of SIC during heat treatment at >1673 K, resulting In severe strength degradation for the as-heat-treated fibers. Vacuum heat treatment at 1573 K provided the best characteristics in low-oxygen SiC fibers.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0002-7820			WOS:000167265300017		
J	Tang, Jing; Meng, Hui-min; Li, Sen; Yu, Meihui; Li, Huan; Shi, Jin hui								The energy saving mechanism of gas diffusion electrode based on Pt/C catalyst for saving energy and green electrodeposition of manganese dioxide								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				170				92	97		10.1016/j.electacta.2015.04.096				JUL 10 2015	2015	The electrodeposition of manganese dioxide is obtained by using Pt/C GDE rather than the traditional electrode (Cu) in order to save energy and protect the environment. Thus, the energy-saving mechanism of Pt/C gas diffusion electrode (Pt/C GDE) in high temperature and strong acid MnSO4 media is studied. The cell voltage and the cathode potential of Pt/C GDE and Cu electrode are tested in 30 g/dm(3) H2SO4 + 120 g/dm3 MnSO4 at 80 +/- 2 degrees C to exhibit the energy-saving effect. The results show that the cell voltage can be reduced more than 1.13 V using Pt/C GDE as cathode instead of the traditional electrode (Cu), and the electric energy consumption of electrolysis with Pt/C GDE can save 60% at 80 A/m(2). The CV curves and polarization curves of Pt/C GDE and the polarization curve of hydrogen evolution reaction on a Cu electrode are researched. The results indicate that the polarization curve of Cu electrode is much more negative than that of the Pt/C GDE at same current density. The reaction of Pt/C GDE is oxygen reduction at the cathode. The amperometric oxygen reduction current of the GDE with Pt/C is about 28 times higher than that of GDE without Pt/C at 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The Pt/C catalyst particle sizes range from 2 nm-6 nm by HRTEM. The oxygen reduction reaction mechanism of Pt/C GDE is researched in strong acid containing manganese ion by rotating disk electrode (RDE). The D-O2 and CO2 values are 0.715 x 10(-9) m(2)s(-1) and 3.3 mol.m(-3) in electrolyte. Koutecky-Levich analysis indicates that the oxygen reduction reaction of Pt/C GDE adopts a 4electron transfer process as main process as the main process in electrolyte (O-2 + 4H(+) + 4e -> 2H(2)O). Therefore, the major causes of the new method for saving energy is that the oxygen reduction reaction of Pt/C GDE, rather than the hydrogen evolution reaction of tradition cathode (Cu), is used, and that the high catalytic activity (the 4-electron transfer process) of Pt/C catalyst also contributes.

Herein, a type of Ag-doped mesoporous NiCoO nanorod with rich oxygen vacancies (NiCoO@Ag-40/NF-Ar) for OER is prepared via an electrodeposition-hydrothermal reaction and the subsequent annealing treatment process under an Ar atmosphere. The electrodeposited Ag film is found to direct the uniform growth of the nanowire arrays of NiCo hydroxide precursors compared to the nanoparticles of NiCo hydroxide in the absence of the Ag film. Interestingly, the addition of C2H8N2 (EN) during the electrode-position of the Ag film and the subsequent calcination under an Ar atmosphere collectively contribute to the formation of mesoporous nanorod structures and rich oxygen vacancies. The calcined NiCoO in air mainly have the Co3O4 phase, implying that it has fewer oxygen vacancies and weak activity for OER. The high surface area and one-dimensional feature of mesoporous nanorods are responsible for the increased exposure of active sites and fast charge transport behavior. Moreover, Ag doping can also improve the conductivity of NiCoO nanorods. NiCoO@Ag40/NF-Ar exhibits a highly efficient activity for OER with a current density of 140 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 370 mV and a remarkable stability. The suitable Ar annealing treatment coupling Ag films and oxygen vacancies into transition metal oxide precursors may be a facile and promising method for constructing mesoporous nanostructures with rich oxygen vacancies for efficient water oxidation.									30	2	0	0	0	0	31			2052-1553			WOS:000414779000002

The polarization of Li-O-2 batteries can be rapidly increased by operation under a high rate condition, resulting in the early capacity fade of the cells. Therefore, a well-designed catalyst with a unique structure and excellent catalytic ability is an important way to boost the round-trip performance of Li-O-2 batteries, especially under high current density. In this work, a unique nanoflower structure assembled with Co3O4 nanosheets is synthesized by using 2-methylimidazole (2-MIM) as a structural directing agent. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectra reveal abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of the Co3O4 nanoflower, which are beneficial for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions and long round-trip lifetime. Density functional theory results demonstrate that Co3O4 catalyst with oxygen vacancies could promote the wetting of Li2O2 on substrate and formation of a Li2O2 nanofilm, thereby boosting the discharge capacity of Li-O-2 batteries. On account of the synergistic effect of abundant oxygen vacancies, the unique structure, and excellent oxygen evolution reaction, Co(3)O(4 )nanoflower-based cells could deliver ultralong lifetime of 276 and 248 cycles with a discharge capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1) under charge/discharge current densities of 0.5 A g(-1) and 1 A g(-1), respectively. This study has shed light on a new strategy for catalyst preparation for long lifetime Li-O-2 batteries.									39	4	0	0	1	0	40			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000487931500035

However, their inherent activity still needs further improvement and the intrinsic catalytic mechanisms are poorly understood during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. Herein, a facile nonstoichiometric strategy is implemented to fabricate perovskite LaMnO3-delta with abundant A-site cationic defects for the first time. The Li-O-2 cell with the as-prepared La0.7MnO3-delta (L0.7MO) dual-function electrocatalyst delivers ultrahigh discharge capacity (29,286 mAh g(-1)), extremely low overpotential (0.38 V) and superior long-term cycling durability (375 cycles at 300 mA g(-1)). The well-defined La defects make crucial contribution in modulating the local unsaturated coordination state of active Mn atoms and thus regulating the electronic structure of L0.7MO, which prominently enhances the oxygen redox kinetics in Li-O-2 battery. Specifically, experimental results and density function theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that La vacancies conspicuously increase the covalency of Mn-O bonds, thus optimizing the e g electron filling states of the active Mn cation and enhancing the overlapping state of Mn 3d-O 2p hybridization, which promotes lattice oxygen participated redox reaction and accelerates the electron transport between the Mn cations and oxygen adsorbates (e.g., O-2(2-), O-2(-)). In addition, the abundant crystal defects endow the surface with strong adsorption capability for LiO2 intermediate and hence fundamentally regulate the formation and decomposition mechanism of Li2O2.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2405-8297			WOS:000703863600011

Here, we show that materials with intrinsically poor electrocatalytic activity can be turned into active electrocatalysts that drive the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) effectively. This development is achieved through ultrafast plasma sputtering, which introduces abundant oxygen vacancies that reconstruct the surface electronic structures, and thus, regulated the surface interactions of electrocatalysts and the OER intermediates. Using tungsten oxide (WO3) as an example, we present a broad spectrum of theoretical and experimental characterizations that show an improved energetics of OER originating from surface oxygen vacancies and resulting in a significantly boosted OER performance, compared with pristine WO3. Our result suggests the efficacy of using defect chemistry to modify electronic properties and hence to improve the OER performance of known materials with poor activity, providing a new direction for the discovery of acid-stable OER catalysts.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17				2096-5745		WOS:000794138300016

However, many fundamental issues regarding the effects of catalyst structure on ORR/OER activities with enhanced stability still remain unknown. Here we prepare three-dimensional (3D) flower-like Ni3Se4 coated by ultrathin carbon-layer (Ni3Se4/UCL) as bifunctional catalyst. Distribution (mapping) of C and N elements confirms the firm combination of Ni3Se4 with UCL to form flower petals with convex-concave surface. Ni3Se4/UCL-3 (mass ratio of NiCl2 center dot 6H(2)O/carbon is 3) exhibits an excellent half-wave potential of 0.82 V (E-1/2, ORR) and a promising overpotential of 0.35 V at 10 mA cm(-2) (OER). Ni3Se4/UCL-3 has a negative shift of only 12 mV for E-1/2 after 5000 cycles (ORR) and a current density decline of only 7.34 % after 20 h test (OER). Density functional theory calculations reveal that interfacial charge redistribution behaviors including charge accumulation and depletion lead to strong electronic interactions between Ni3Se4 (002) and UCL to obtain efficient charge transfer for ORR/OER. beta-NiOOH is mainly responsible for the high OER activity, and in-situ X-ray diffraction tests verify the crystallization of selenite (NiSeO3) during OER. This work provides a promising reference for promoting future development of 3D-structured transition metal selenidesbased electrocatalysts.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000722924400004

Whereas Co3O4 contains Co2+ in the tetrahedral sites and Co3+ in the octahedral sites in the spinel structure, ZnCo2O4 contains only Co3+ in the octahedral sites; Co in the tetrahedral sites is replaced by Zn2+. Therefore, by comparing the catalytic properties of ZnCo2O4 and Co3O4 electrodes prepared with comparable surface morphologies and thicknesses, it was possible to examine whether Co2+ in Co3O4 is catalytically active for OER. The electrocatalytic properties of ZnCo2O4 and Co3O4 for OER in both 1 M KOH (pH 13.8) and 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) solutions were investigated and compared. The results suggest that the Co2+ in Co3O4 is not catalytically critical for OER and ZnCo2O4 can be a more economical and environmentally benign replacement for Co3O4 as an OER catalyst.									226	5	0	0	9	0	227			1948-7185			WOS:000338693200033	26279561

However, achieving higher efficiency is largely limited by the valence states of metal species. Herein, different graphdiyne (GDY)-nickel composites were designed and synthesized [Ni(OH)(2)/GDY, NiOOH/GDY, and NiOx/GDY] as the electrocatalysts for OER. The NiOx/GDY possessing the mixed valence states can drive the OER more efficiently than Ni(OH)(2)/GDY and NiOOH/GDY. NiOx/GDY gives the smallest overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) for OER, which is even superior to commercial RuO2 electrocatalyst. Experimental results reveal that not only the fast charge transfer induced by GDY but also the prominent roles of mixed Ni2+/Ni3+ valence states boost the OER electrocatalytic performances. The presence of the mixed valence state was demonstrated to be helpful for the charge transfer, resulting in the enhancement of the catalytic activity. This work may provide a new direction to design and fabricate high-performance materials for OER and beyond.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1005-9040	2210-3171		WOS:000709719800001

For decades, scientists have been discussing the characteristics of water that differ from bulk water in special environments. Recently, various small amounts of treated water were developed to create specific applications. In 2014, comprehensively active and stable plasmon-activated water (PAW), which was mass-produced and innovatively created by utilizing hot electron transfer (HET) from gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), was first reported. In this work, we report the maintenance of activity of purified Au-free PAW collected from water condensed from PAW vapor (PAW-V). Interestingly, the metastable PAW-V was still active with a structure of electron-doping and reduced hydrogen bonding (HB), which were confirmed by zeta potentials and the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation time (T-1). Like PAW, PAW-V enhanced hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and oxygen evolution reactions (OERs), compared to deionized water (DIW). The PAW-V itself exhibited the ability to more rapidly evaporate due to reduced HBs between homogeneous molecules, while a PAW/isopropanol solution evaporated more slowly due to enhanced HBs between heterogeneous molecules. Also, PAW-V could scavenge free 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals and reduce the strong KMnO4 oxidant. The unique properties of PAW-V were maintained after storage for 3 days at room temperature in the dark. The condensed Au-free PAW has emerged as a promising green active solvent applicable in various fields of physics, chemistry and biomedicine.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000722897500001

Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, a 3-in-1 electrocatalyst that can efficiently catalyze overall water splitting in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes has not been reported so far. Herein, we report the colloidal synthesis of well-dispersed IrW nanobranches with branch architectures and describe how the morphology varies with the amount of W doping. As expected, they exhibit outstanding catalytic performance and durability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at all pH values, which are much higher than those of Ir nanoparticles (NPs), and most reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. More importantly, when further used as both an anode and cathode for overall water splitting in 0.1 M HClO4, 0.1 M KOH, and 1.0 M PBS (phosphate buffer solution), cell voltages of 1.58, 1.60, and 1.73 V, respectively, were achieved at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The present work opens up a new avenue for designing electrocatalysts for pH-universal overall water splitting, especially for application in highly corrosive acidic media and neutral media with limited ionic concentrations.									42	1	0	0	2	0	42			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000469245300023	31016292

The oxides were characterized by X-ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry and steady state polarization measurements. The electrolyte pH was varied in order to study the reaction order with respect to protons. The polarization curves recorded could be well fitted to a model consisting of a series of concerted electron-proton transfer reactions (mononuclear mechanism) with either of the second, third, or fourth step being rate determining. The expected trends for this mechanism with respect to potential and pH were observed in the experimental data and are consistent with DFT results for the adsorption energies of the adsorbates [Rossmeisl et aL, J. ElectroanaL Chem. 607 (2007) 83-89] if the third or fourth step is rate-determining for RuO2 and IrO2, respectively.The fitting procedures also demonstrate the advantages of working with the full current-voltage expression when analyzing polarization curves, since Tafel behavior may only prevail in a limited potential region.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000435619700069

Novel core-shell structure consisting of polydopamine (PDA) shell with different thickness and bimetal-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) Co/Fe core with cubic morphology are first prepared, followed by a thermal and etching treatments to fabricate hollow composite materials composed of multiple Co/FeC cores evenly distributed in N-doped carbon shell. PDA acts as a carbon and nitrogen source simultaneously to form N-doped hollow carbon in this procedure. Creatively, the N-doped hollow carbon shell protects Co/FeC core and against the degradation, in addition to enhance the conductivity of Co/FeC@NHC. Through adjusting the PDA shell thickness simply, Co/FeC@NHC with tunable N-doped carbon shell thickness is well crafted. The Co/FeC@NHC-1 with the best electrocatalytic performance is obtained by optimizing the thickness of N-doped hollow carbon shell. The Co/FeC@NHC-1 exhibits the highest activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and outstanding stability and durability. Hence, this research may establish a promising path for the rational design of metals@carbon composite with controllable structure which can act as highly efficient electrocatalysts for (OER).

In the present work, phenanthroline (phen) was used as a ligand to prepare a Co(phen)(2) complex. The Co(phen)(2) complex was coated on BP2000 and then heat treated at 600, 700, 800, and 900 degrees C, to obtain carbon-supported Co-N (Co-N/C) catalysts. The catalytic activities in oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) of the prepared catalysts were measured and compared with those of a typical carbon-supported cobalt tetramethoxyphenylporphyrin (CoTMPP/C) catalyst. The influence of the calcination temperature on the composition and structure of the Co-N/C catalysts was investigated. Electrochemical tests showed that the Co-N/C catalysts prepared at 700 and 800 degrees C gave better performances, comparable to that of the CoTMPP/C catalyst. The superior electrochemical performance of the prepared Co-N/C catalysts and the low cost of the phenanthroline chelating agent make Co-N/C a promising cheap catalyst for lithium/oxygen batteries.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			1000-6818			WOS:000329345800020

Herein, we prepare a trimetallic nickel, iron, and molybdenum phosphide (FeNiMoP) grown on nickel foam (NF) via a facile two-step process and employ it as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for full water splitting. In virtue of the superior hydrogen/oxygen evolution activity, the cell with the bifunctional FeNiMoP as both anode and cathode exhibits an initial low cell voltage of 1.50 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution. Impressively, the full cell voltage decreases to 1.44 V through favorable self-reconstruction on both the anode and cathode during the electrocatalytic overall water splitting process. On the anode side, the FeNiMoP is transformed into FeNiOOH while Mo and P elements are dissolved into the electrolyte. Such transformation leads to a continuously increasing active surface area, and the dissolved Mo forms MoO42- in the electrolyte which improves the OER performance. On the cathode side, the dissolution and re-deposition of Mo oxides on the surface of the electrode greatly increase the active surface sites towards the electrolytes, and the surface absorbed Mo oxides play key roles, leading to a positive effect on HER performance. The new synthesis strategy, taking advantage of favorable structural self-reconstruction in the catalysts can be extended to other catalytic systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000708560600001		
J	Lv, Yang; Wang, Xianbao; Mei, Tao; Li, Jinhua; Wang, Jianying								Reduced Graphene Oxide-Supported Cobalt Phosphide Nanoflowers via in situ Hydrothermal Synthesis as Pt-Free Effective Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction								NANO				13	5			30	37						2018	2018	Cobalt phosphide (CoP) has aroused extensive research interest in a field of electrochemical application due to its excellent catalytic activities. CoP and its compounds have been widely reported using in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, few reports about CoP as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were presented. In this work, we prepare reduced graphene-oxide(rGO)-loaded CoP (rGO@CoP) as an electrocatalyst for ORR through in situ hydrothermal treatment. The rGO@CoP as ORR catalyst exhibits excellent activities where its onset potential has a positive increase of 129 mV, and the ORR potential achieves an increase of 330mV at a current density of 1.0mA cm -2 compared with that of pure CoP. The current density is also significantly improved with an increase of 0.51mA cm -2 at -350 mV, and the Tafel slope has a decrease of 19mV dec -1. Further tests show that the electron transfer number of rGO@CoP is 3.66, which is larger than 2.19 of pure CoP, indicating that it is dominated by a four-electron transfer pathway. Moreover, its stability (remained 98.6% current after working 6000 s) and methanol tolerance are outstanding. These results show that rGO@CoP may be considered to replace traditional Pt-based ORR catalysts for fuel cells, and rGO loading has been proven to be an effective strategy to enhance the ORR performance of CoP, which may provide a new idea to synthesize transition metal phosphides as ORR catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1793-2920			KJD:ART002350117

Amorphous and nanocrystalline phases have been prepared by mechanically alloying the elemental components under various milling conditions. Fee nanocrystals are formed when the Mo concentration is smaller than 30 at. %. The nanocrystalline state becomes unstable with respect to the amorphous phase when the Mo content in the solid solution exceeds 30 at. %. The electroactive phase for the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline solutions is the nanocrystalline supersaturated solid solution.

X-ray diffraction characterization suggests that the CoOx/Co precursor is oxidized to Co3O4 before the onset potential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Scanning electron microscopy shows that instead of retaining its original morphology, the irregular-shaped nanoparticles undergo a morphological transition into hexagonal nanoplates during the oxidation process. The mechanism of the morphological changes is discussed and a two-step topotactic transformation pathway from Co(OH)(2) to CoOOH to Co3O4 is proposed. Amorphization and recrystallization of the catalysts are also found at different stages of the electrochemical measurements. The 2D-Co3O4 nanoplates exhibit high OER catalytic activity.

Herein, TiO2 is doped with N through facile NH3 gas treatment and innovatively employed to support IrOx nanoparticles towards acidic OER. N-doping action not only dramatically boosts the electrical conductivity and dispersing/anchoring effects of TiO2, but also effectively improves the electron-transfer procedure. As a result, the IrOx/N-TiO2 electrocatalyst exhibits prominent catalyst utilization, catalytic activity and stability. Specifically, the overpotential required to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) is only 270 mV, and the mass activity climbs to 278.7 A g(Ir)(-1) @ 1.55 V-RHE. Moreover, the single cell voltage is only 1.761 V @ 2.0 A cm(-2) when adopting IrOx/N-TiO2 as the anode catalyst, which is 44 mV lower than that of the commercial IrO2 counterpart.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000870383300001	36320779

However, the electrocatalytic rate on CoP is restricted because of the reaction intermediates binding to its surface strongly, leading to sluggish reaction kinetics and unsatisfied catalytic performance. Herein, we describe a ternary heterostructured CoP/CN/Ni catalyst with oriented electron modulation effect to boost its electrocatalytic activity, where the electronic structure of the outer CoP is modulated by the endowed electrons from underlying Ni nanoparticles, which are encapsulated and protected by 2?3 N-doped carbon (CN) layers from oxidation and corrosion in harsh environment. Theoretical calculations reveal that the electron redistribution effect could decrease the adsorption energy of hydrogen (?GH*) on CoP from -0.25 eV to -0.1 eV. Benefiting from such electron modulation, CoP/CN/Ni only needs overpotentials of 66 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 106 mV in 1 M KOH for HER to afford a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and presents the comparable ORR activity with Pt/C in 0.1 M KOH. Besides, the unique structure also endows CoP/CN/Ni with superior electrocatalytic stability for HER and ORR.									19	1	0	0	2	0	19			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000644451300003

Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to realize simultaneous nanointerface engineering and electronic structure modulation. Herein, a facile two-step cation exchange method has been developed for the fabrication of heterostructured CoMoOx/CoOx/RuOx nanoboxes with multiple well-defined nanointerfaces and modified electronic structures. Importantly, benefiting from the compositional and structural advantages, this CoMoOx/CoOx/RuOx nanobox could achieve excellent OER activity with an ultralow overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Combining experimental results and mechanistic studies implied that the strong electron interaction on the well-defined nanointerfaces within the multi-component CoMoOx/CoOx/RuOx nanoboxes could induce effective electronic modification, which would significantly optimize the binding energy of *O and *OOH intermediates, thereby contributing to the improved OER performance.									37	0	0	0	0	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000663879900001

The effects of the furnace temperature and the oxygen partial pressure in the reaction atmosphere on the combustion behaviors are studied experimentally and kinetically. Comparing the experimental results obtained with the kinetic modelling results, the most optimum kinetic model is proposed for all of the samples employed, and the detail combustion mechanisms are also elucidated quantitatively. As a result, the completion period of the overall combustion decreases with increases of both the furnace temperature and the oxygen partial pressure. The evolution period of volatile matter (VM) is reduced in order from the bituminous coal. the oil coke to the waste plastic of composite materials. While, the reaction period by 95 % of the conversion is shorten in order from the oil coke, the waste plastic of composite materials and the bituminous coal. The reaction model for the oil coke is revealed as the parallel model of the volumetric model with the grain model. For both the waste plastic of composite materials and the bituminous coal, the parallel model the volumetric model of with the pore model agrees well with the respective experimental results. The activation energy of the fixed carbon (FC) combustion for the oil coke is the largest of the three. The activation energy for the waste plastic of composite material is almost the same as that for the bituminous coal. The reaction orders of the oxygen partial pressure for the VM evolution and the FC combustion become almost 0 and 1 for all of the samples, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0916-8753	1882-6121		WOS:000445881400002

Phase evolution in the powder mixtures as a function of composition and milling time was followed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) finding out that after 18h, every mixture consist of a single phase. Mechanically activated chemical reaction takes place after an intial step of particle size refinement and polymorphic transformation of C-Gd2O3. We have performed Impedance Spectroscopy measurements to investigate oxygen ion dynamics in the series and conclude that Zr substitution for Sn hardly modifies the importance of ion-ion correlations in the oxygen diffusion process. We also estimate from conductivity measurements the value of the microscopic activation energy needed for independent ion hopping, which is found to be 0.56+or-0.06eV, independent of Zr content.

Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) provides data on the electrocatalytic OER activity from several individual measurement areas covering one Co3O4 nanocube of a comparatively high number of individual particles with sufficient statistical reproducibility. Single-particle-on-nanoelectrode measurements of Co3O4 nanocubes provide an accelerated stress test at highly alkaline conditions with current densities of up to 5.5 A cm(-2), and allows to derive TOF values of up to 2.8x10(4) s(-1) at 1.92 V vs. RHE for surface Co atoms of a single cubic nanoparticle. Obtaining such high current densities combined with identical-location transmission electron microscopy allows monitoring the formation of an oxy(hydroxide) surface layer during electrocatalysis. Combining two independent single-entity electrochemistry techniques provides the basis for elucidating structure-activity relations of single electrocatalyst nanoparticles with well-defined surface structure.									15	0	0	0	0	0	14			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000697959700001	34411401

Electrocatalysts with an amorphous form are highly active but suffer with low structural stability. Poorly crystallized materials with activity like amorphous forms, while maintaining the mechanical robustness of crystalline forms, are expected to be ideal materials. Towards this direction, we, for the first time, developed low-crystalline Fe5O7(OH)4H(2)O as an excellent OER electrocatalyst with an overpotential of 269 mV, in order to drive a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in a 1.0 M KOH environment, and this outperforms most of the reported Fe-based electrocatalysts. Notably, its activity can be maintained for at least 100 hours. A one-pot synthesis for the poorly-crystallized material using one of the most abundant metal elements to obtain effective OER catalysis will provide great convenience in practical applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000516545700054	35542842

We provide here a controllable thermal decomposition route for PBAs to obtain highly dispersed small-sized nanoparticles with high catalytic activity. CoFe PBA nanocubes as catalyst precursors are grown within three-dimensional porous ultrathin N-doped carbon networks (3DNC), which is constructed using mixed soluble salts as templates. The use of 3DNC as supporting matrix can not only increase the electrical conductivity and transport properties of reaction-relevant species within the catalyst material, but also supply huge specific surface and restrict the size of loaded nanoparticles. Followed by calcination in the reductive atmosphere, the PBA nanocubes are decomposed to form numerous small-sized CoFe/CoFeOx nanoparticles that are uniformly dispersed. It is interesting to find that this thermal decomposition process is assisted by 3DNC matrix because of its excellent thermal conductive property. Benefiting from the synergetic bimetal alloy/oxide composition, advantageous structural feature and favorable interfacial integration of the hybrid material, the CoFe/CoFeOx@3DNC exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. The decomposition of PBAs precursor to small-sized nanoparticles and the use of 3DNC as supporting matrix and thermal conductive agent are appealing.

Using in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy, we explored the interfacial evolution during the Li-O-2 electrochemical reactions in dimethyl sulfoxide-based electrolyte, further revealing the surface catalytic mechanism of the soluble catalyst 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DBBQ). The real-time views showed that during discharge flower-like Li2O2 formed in the electrolyte with DBBQ but small toroid without DBBQ Upon charge, Li2O2 decomposes at a slow rate from bottom to top in the absence of DBBQ yet with an outside-in approach in the presence of DBBQ Bigger discharge products and more efficient decomposition pathways in the DBBQ-containing system reveal the catalytic activity of DBBQ straightforwardly. Our work provides a direct insight into the surface effect of soluble catalyst DBBQ on Li-O-2 reactions at the nanoscale, which is critical for the performance optimization of Li-O-2 batteries.									40	7	0	0	4	0	44			0002-7863			WOS:000466987900020	30966740

In this study, hierarchical dodecahedral-structured CoP/CN@MoS2 is prepared through a two-step calcination treatment and a solvothermal approach. The metal-organic framework of ZIF-67 is chosen to serve as the template and for providing Co sources, in which ZIF-67 is first transformed to Co nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon polyhedrons and then transformed to CoP/CN. MoS2 nanosheets are further grown on the surface of dodecahedral-structured CoP/CN with a solvothermal method. Benefiting from the synergistic coupling effect of CoP and MoS2 and the nitrogen-doped carbon matrix, advanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) both in acid and alkaline solution as well as splendid oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in alkaline aqueous were achieved. Moreover, the coupling effect of CoP/CN and MoS2 is disclosed theoretically by density functional theory calculations to validate the increased HER activity. The as-prepared hybrid CoP/CN@MoS2 not only exhibits decent HER activity in acidic (eta(10) = 144 mV) and alkaline solutions (eta(10) = 149 mV), but also exhibits splendid OER activity (eta(10) = 289 mV) in 1.0 M KOH. This work represents a solid step toward boosting the electrocatalytic kinetics of nonprecious catalysts.									48	2	0	0	3	0	49			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000490357900038	31535845

Photosynthtic inhibition on the microalga Dunaliella sallina (Chlorophyta) by the dried macroalga Gracilaria lemaneiformis (Rhodophyta)								2012 International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology (iCBEB)								400	4		10.1109/iCBEB.2012.296				2012	2012	The effects of the dried macro alga, Gracilaria lemaneiformis (Rhodophyta), on photosynthesis of a highly stress-resistant micro alga, Dunaliella sallina, were studied. D. sallina was cultured with dried G. lemaneiformis under controlled laboratory conditions. Photosynthetic oxygen evolution was measured and the chlorophyll a (Chl a) fluorescence transient O-J-I-P curve coupled with its specific parameters was established. In vivo, the Chl a fluorescence transients were recorded at high time resolution and analyzed via the JIP-test to evaluate photo system II activity. A clear dose-relevant relationship was estabished between the dried biomass of G. lemaneiformis and its inhibitory effect on D. sallina. A decrease in the light-saturated maximum photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate (Pmax) was observed, which was also time-relevant. Also an O-J-I-P curve along with its specific parameters were reduced. The dark respiration rate (Rd) showed a reverse pattern. The main photosynthetic inhibitory targets of the macro alga on the micro alga, based on the JIP-test and the amount of oxygen evolution, can be expressed as the number decrease of active reaction centers, the blocking of the electron transport chain, and the damage to the oxygen-evolving complex. The results of this study indicate that dried fragments of G. lemaneiformis effectively inhibit photosynthesis in D. sallina and could thus be potential candidates in controlling and mitigating harmful algal blooms.					2012 International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology (iCBEB)2012 International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology (iCBEB)	28-30 May 201228-30 May 2012	IEEE Biomed.

It continues to inspire and challenge the design and fabrication of artificial multicomponent colloidal nanostructures for solar-to-fuel conversion. Herein, we introduce a plasmonic photocatalyst synthesized with colloidal methods with five integrated components including cocatalysts installed in orthogonal locations. The precise deposition of individual inorganic components on an Au/TiO2 nanodumbell nanostructure is enabled by photoreduction and photooxidation, which selectively occurs at the TiO2 tip sites and Au lateral sites, respectively. Under visible-light irradiation, the photocatalyst exhibited activity of oxygen evolution from water without scavengers. We demonstrate that each component is essential for improving the photocatalytic performance. In addition, mechanistic studies suggest that the photocatalytic reaction requires combining the hot charge carriers derived from exciting both the d-sp interband transition and the localized surface plasmon resonance of Au.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000599507100036	33226246

Herein, Ni,Fe sulfides embedded N,S co-doped carbon hybrids (NiFeS@NSCs) with tunable Ni:Fe ratios were devised through pyrolysis of methionine chelated Ni, Fe precursors. In this type of heterojunction hybrids, the spontaneous diffusion of electrons from embedded sulfides to NSC shell increases the reducibility of NSC and the oxidizability of sulfides, which are therefore capable of catalyzing OER and HER simultaneously. The typical Ni2FeS@NSC hybrid with Ni:Fe molar ratio of 2:1 offered high electrocatalytic ability for alkali OER (overpotential of 247 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), which is significantly superior to that of individual sulfide. In addition, good HER efficiency was concurrently ensured by Ni2FeS@NSC. The symmetric water electrolyzer based on Ni2FeS@NSC required an input voltage of 1.77 V to arouse an electrolysis current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work offers a feasible approach to enhance the OER, HER bifunctional catalytic performances via interfacial electrons diffusion within heterojunction hybrid.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000782268200006

However, the roles of two geometrical cobalt ions toward the OER have remained elusive. Here, we investigated the geometrical-site-dependent OER activity of Co3O4 catalyst by substituting Co-Td(2+) and Co-Oh(3+) with inactive Zn2+ and Al3+, respectively. Following a thorough in operando analysis by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, it was revealed that Co-Td(2+) site is responsible for the formation of cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH), which acted as the active site for water oxidation.									537	24	1	0	33	0	546			0002-7863			WOS:000368323100005	26710084

In this work, a novel bimetallic phosphide confined within P, N co-doped carbon layers is achieved through a space-confinement phosphorization strategy. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the obtained bimetallic phosphide nanoparticle-containing hybrid can serve as a highly efficient bifunctional oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) catalyst. It delivers a small potential difference of 0.75 V in 0.1 M KOH solution along with long-term catalytic durability, superior to most of the non-precious metal catalysts reported to date. The detailed synchrotron-based spectra results combined with structural characterizations reveal that the constructed hierarchical structure endows the confined bimetallic phosphide catalyst with abundant catalytic sites and stable spatial structure, thereby achieving remarkable electrocatalytic performance. This work opens up a facile way to design effective and durable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for practical applications in renewable energy production, especially in rechargeable metal-air batteries and regenerative fuel cells.									31	0	0	0	2	0	31			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000435829000024

Herein, a facile solution impregnation strategy to construct metal-organic frameworks on electrospun nanofibers following melamine-assisted carbonization synthetic approach is reported to prepare low-cost, scalable, and efficient bifunctional air electrodes. The flexible electrode comprises carbon nanofibers as the backbone that supports nitrogen-doped, cobalt embedded carbon nanotubes/porous carbon flakes arrays hierarchical structures (CoNCNTF/CNFs). The combined advantages of optimized chemical compositions and CNT/carbon flakes morphology endow CoNCNTF/CNFs with a promising reversible oxygen overpotential of 0.76 V. The flexible solid-state zinc-air battery using CoNCNTF/CNEs film as the additive-free air electrode exhibit favorable battery capacity and power density, durable stability and good bendability, surpassing that of the precious metal-based air electrodes.

The morphological evolution and the influential effects of the important experimental parameters on the PtCu networks have been systematically studied. Relative to commercial Pt/C and Pt black catalysts, these porous PtCu networks exhibit much better activity and remarkably improved durability towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The excellent ORR performance could be attributed to their structural features, including the core-shell nanostructures with a Pt-skin, the 3D porous networks with high surface area, and the ultrathin (3.6 nm) jagged nanowires with plentiful edge/corner atoms. Notably, this method can be facilely extended to obtain PtCuAu trimetallic nanowire networks with high porosity, which exhibits its robustness for preparing novel 3D porous nanostructures with great potential in various catalytic applications.									57	7	0	0	0	0	58			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000437965900036

Many efforts have been made to develop nanostructured DSA electrodes to enhance the stability and catalytic activity of CER. Herein, a composite catalyst composed of RuO2/IrO2 decorated TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2 NTAs) was proposed for CER applications. 1D TiO2 NTAs were fabricated by electrochemical anodization. RuO2/IrO2 nanoparticles were embedded in TiO2 NTAs by electrochemical deposition. Catalytic activity of RuO2/IrO2-TiO2 NTAs is superior to most CER materials. At a current density of 50 mA cm-2, the overpotential is 1.115 V (vs. SCE) with a Tafel slope of 33.5 mV dec-1 in 5 M NaCl. The RuO2/IrO2-TiO2 NTAs exhibit good selectivity towards oxygen evolution reaction, with a potential separation of 205 mV at 50 mA cm-2. The RuO2/IrO2-TiO2 NTAs also display excellent stability for CER. Almost no attenuation is observed after 50 h test.

In addition, the activity surpasses that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst after repeated HER measurements.

Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), desktop scanning electron microscope (TM3030)-energy spectrometer (SwiftED3000), thermal analyzer (TGA), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), X-ray photoelectron energy Spectral analyzer (XPS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) (BET) were used to study the influence of different cobalt oxide concentrations on the morphology of mesoporous TiO2 fibers. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and continuous cycle method were used to evaluate the fiber's oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactivity. It was found that the fiber with a molar ratio of Co to Ti of 1:10 showed the best performance for both OER and ORR reactions in alkaline solution. The fiber showed an overpotential of 382 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 58 mV.dec(-1), and a half-wave potential change of only 10 mV after 4000 CV cycles. It has an onset potential of 0.83 V (vs RHE) in the ORR reaction. The OER/ORR overpotential gap (E) of 0.85 V is significantly lower than commercial platinum/carbon and bulk TiO2 analogs. Obviously, this catalytic activity stems from the synergy between Co3O4 and TiO2 fibers. In addition, the higher specific surface area and the presence of disordered mesopores provide a higher charge carrier density during the electrocatalytic process, which improves the reaction activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1387-1811	1873-3093		WOS:000786666200003

The cheap and stable chalcogenides seem to be an attractive alternative and are most likely to replace the precious metal catalysts. However, the poor conductivity, limited number of active sites, and other properties of the chalcogenides limit their applications. In this work, we synthesized defect-rich MoSe2 with nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (MoSe2/NG) in a simple hydrothermal process by introducing excess Se precursor. The catalyst with optimal performance (MoSe2/NG-4) exhibits good bifunctional properties in the oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It exhibits a small overpotential of 120 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the HER, with a smaller Tafel slope of 69 mV dec(-1), which is much lower than the values of most reported most reported Mobased catalysts. Besides, it behaves as an effective catalyst in the ORR and adopts a four-electron reaction pathway. This excellent bifunctional catalytic property is mainly due to the rich heterostructure of MoSe2 /NG-4 and synergistic effect of nitrogen doping, excellent conductivity of graphene, and the rich active sites. This work provides a new approach for the synthesis and application of chalcogenides and their complexes in the field of catalysis. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

By control of the pyrolysis conditions, iron species can ex-solve from inside N,O-doped carbon nanoshells onto the external carbon surface, where they form stable small FeOx nanoparticles. The location (endo- or exohedral) of the iron species is correlated with an observed switch of the product selectivity (from H2O2 to H2O) in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction.									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			2574-0970			WOS:000507667200003

Herein, a new synthesis strategy is proposed to prepare OER catalysts based on a simple yet flexible in situ decomposition of Co-based acetate hydroxide metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). This process allows straightforward fabrication of various 2D hydroxide ultrathin nanosheets (UNSs) with excellent component controllability. The as-obtained Co-based hydroxide UNSs demonstrate superior catalytic activity for the OER due to the exposure of numerous active sites. In particular, the CoNi hydroxide UNSs exhibit low overpotentials (eta) of 324 and 372 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA center dot cm(-2), respectively; a large turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.16 s(-1) at eta = 380 mV; and a small Tafel slope of 33 mV center dot dec(-1) in an alkaline environment. Importantly, these values are superior to those of the state-of-theart IrO2 commercial electrocatalyst. This facile strategy enables the exploration of more efficient and economic OER electrocatalysts with various constituents and opens a promising avenue for large-scale fabrication of functional nanocatalysts for use in clean energy technologies.									62	6	0	0	2	0	62			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000376652300029

Here, by using first-principles calculations, we predicted that the transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes in the WTe2/InSe vdW heterostructure follows the Z-scheme pathway instead of type-II. It is highlighted that the WTe2/InSe vdW heterostructure is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with high lattice dynamical and thermodynamic stability. Interestingly, the built-in electric field at the interface can effectively separate photogenerated carriers. The suitable band edge positions of the WTe2/InSe vdW heterostructure can provide sufficient driving force for photoinduced carriers to participate in water redox reaction. More importantly, the Te-vacancies in WTe2/InSe can significantly lower the overpotential of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Under light irradiation, both HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can spontaneously occur on the surface of the WTe2/InSe vdW heterostructure when pH > 7. These results provide new prospects for designing efficient InSe-based Z-scheme vdW heterostructure photocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000782254900001

Herein, an advanced carved particle-in-box nanoreactor, composed of small Fe-Co-Ni trimetallic alloy nanoparticles confined in porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanocage, was developed through a spatially-confined pyrolysis strategy. Tri-metal alloy could optimize the electronic structure of the catalyst, thus inducing the charge redistribution, and then regulating the adsorption and desorption energy barriers of intermediates in electrochemical reactions. Unique nano-hole design provided convenient and efficient channels for mass transfer during ORR and OER processes. Thanks to these attributes, the hybrid electrocatalyst delivered decent reversible oxygen catalytic activities, evidenced by a high half-wave potential of 0.850 V towards ORR and a low overpotential of 355 mV at 10 mA/cm2 for OER both in alkaline electrolyte. As a proof-of-concept, this as-developed carved particle-in-box nanoreactor enabled the assembled Zn-air battery to deliver a narrow potential gap of 0.735 V, a decent power density of 315 mW/cm2, a notable specific capacity of 754 mAh/gZn and excellent durability up to 165 h of continuous charge and discharge operations, thus implying the potential applications of this sophisticated catalyst model for promising energy conversion.									5	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000810320000004

ACS applied materials & interfaces											10.1021/acsami.2c15769				2022-Nov-03	2022	Rational design and synthesis of high-performance electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are critical for practical application of Zn-air batteries (ZABs). In this work, the bifunctional composite Cu-Fe2O3/PNC was prepared by a simple and effective wet-hydrothermal coupled dry-annealing synthesis strategy. The Cu-Fe2O3/PNC displayed excellent catalytic activity in ORR and OER with a potential difference of 0.63 V. More importantly, the ZAB assembled with Cu-Fe2O3/PNC exhibited a high-power density of 138.00 mW cm-2 and an excellent long-term cyclability. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrated that the excellent performance is due to the strong electronic interaction between Cu and Fe2O3 that arises as a result of the fast electron transfer through the Cu-O-Fe bond and the higher concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. Meanwhile, the spillover factor Bsp/2zF of Cu/PNC and Cu-Fe2O3/PNC obtained by the rotating disk experiment was 1.00 * 10-7 and 1.10 * 10-7 cm2·s-1, respectively, indicating that the oxygen spillover effect between Cu and Fe2O3 lowers the energy barrier, increases the number of active sites, and alters the rate-determining reaction step. This work demonstrated the significant potential of Cu-Fe2O3/PNC in energy conversion and storage applications, providing a new perspective for the rational design of bifunctional electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1944-8252		MEDLINE:36326106	36326106

Here, we report a hydrothermal method to generate hydrogen bonded supramolecular complex via water-based homogeneous supramolecular assembly, which is a promising precursor to fabricate porous and oxygen-doped g-C3N4. The hydrothermal treatment provides a homogeneous environment for hydrolysis of melamine to produce cyanuric acid and reaction of cyanuric acid with remained melamine to create the in-plane ordering and hydrogen bonded supramolecular complex. The complex can template uniform nanoporous structure and also provide an opportunity for O-doping in the g-C3N4 network upon calcination in air. The resulted g-C3N4(GCN-4) possesses high surface area, well-defined 3D morphology and oxygen-dopant in the lattice. Subsequently, the visible light absorption, charge separation, and wettability are considerably enhanced. This catalyst exhibits higher hydrogen evolution rate by 11.3 times than the bulk g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation, with apparent quantum efficiency of 10.3% at 420 mn.									157	11	0	0	15	0	161			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000414109700002

Electrolysis of seawater is not only a promising approach to produce clean hydrogen energy, but also of great significance to seawater desalination. The implementation of seawater electrolysis requires robust and efficient electrocatalysts that can sustain seawater splitting without chloride corrosion, especially for the anode. Here we report a three-dimensional core-shell metal-nitride catalyst consisting of NiFeN nanoparticles uniformly decorated on NiMoN nanorods supported on Ni foam, which serves as an eminently active and durable oxygen evolution reaction catalyst for alkaline seawater electrolysis. Combined with an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst of NiMoN nanorods, we have achieved the industrially required current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2) at record low voltages of 1.608 and 1.709 V, respectively, for overall alkaline seawater splitting at 60 degrees C. This discovery significantly advances the development of seawater electrolysis for large-scale hydrogen production.									373	17	0	0	16	0	377			2041-1723			WOS:000495393000001	31704926

In this work, Cyamopsis tetragonoloba extract derived nitrogen doped carbon dots (NDCDs) supported NiFe layered double hydroxide stacked sheets (NiFe LDH@NDCDs) had been successfully synthesized by easy solvothermal method. Structural morphology and crystalline nature of the synthesized NiFe LDH@NDCDs were characterized by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. The performance of the synthesized NiFe LDH@NDCDs in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was estimated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Tafel, Electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry, and chronopotentiometry measurements in 0.1 M KOH. The synthesized NiFe LDH@NDCDs demonstrated the small overpotential of 0.385 V-RHE to attain current density of 10 mA/cm(2), which was lesser than NiFe LDH (0.425 V-RHE), the state of the art (RuO2 = 0.422 V-RHE), NDCDs (0.534 V-RHE) and Bare Ni foam (0.541 V-RHE). The calculated Tafel slopes of synthesized NiFe LDH@NDCDs showed smaller value (93 mV/dec) than NiFe LDH, RuO2, and Bare Ni foam. The EIS studies exposed that the total resistance (R-1 + R-2) of NiFe LDH@NDCDs (63.85 omega/cm(2)) was lower than the total resistance of NiFe LDH (82.58 omega/cm(2)) and resistance of Bare Ni foam (123.8 omega/cm(2)), which revealed the good conductivity and electro activity of NiFe LDH@NDCDs. Moreover, the stability of the synthesized NiFe LDH@NDCDs was analyzed by chronopotentiometry for 6 h at a constant current density of 10 mA/cm(2). Thus the results of the present study established NiFe LDH@NDCDs as an efficient electrocatalyst for the OER in alkaline medium.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000806822200002

However, the utilization of anionic oxygen redox reactions always leads to detrimental lattice oxygen release, which accelerates structural distortion and electrochemical performance deterioration. In contrast to the typical Li-O-Li configuration in Li-rich layered oxides, not only can oxygen redox behaviors be triggered within layered Li-4/7[square Mn-1/7(6/7)]O-2 (square: Mn vacancy) with Li-O-vacancy configuration, but lattice oxygen loss can be effectively suppressed. Upon Li + (de)intercalations, Mn vacancy within the TM layer also enables reversible structural evolution and Li migration processes, further boosting high output capacity and long-term cycling stability. Besides, not only can the irreversible/reversible anionic/cationic redox reactions be clearly unraveled, but their capacity distributions can be roughly quantified upon cycling. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the introduction of Mn vacancy provides a promising configuration to achieve high-capacity cathode candidates for next-generation Li-ion batteries.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2542-4351			WOS:000819196200001

In virtue of the synergistic effect between the POM and ZIF species, their regular architecture and their high surface area, the as-prepared ZIF-8@ZIF-67@POM hybrids exhibit remarkable OER electrocatalytic performance in a 1 M KOH electrolyte in the presence of an overpotential of only 490 mV with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 88 mV dec(-1). In addition, the ZIF-8@ZIF-67@POM hybrids display good long-term stability.

Albeit photoelectrochemical water splitting has been demonstrated, the required overpotentials remain prohibitively large compared with the theoretically accessible values, particularly for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we apply density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the use of strain and cationic doping with Ca and Sr to optimize the OER theoretical overpotential. For the TaON-terminated BaTaO2N (001) surface, 4% compressive uniaxial strain can lower the theoretical overpotential to eta = 0.59 V, under operational conditions. For the most stable TaO2N-(100) termination, 1% tensile uniaxial strain, which is perfectly accessible by experiments, is enough to reduce the theoretical overpotential from eta = 0.43 V to eta = 0.37 V under (photo)electrochemical conditions. This value is close to the minimum predicted theoretical overpotential and points out how strain engineering could be efficiently used to improve the electrocatalytic reactions.									10	0	0	0	0	0	8			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000651524100026

The relatively high temperature is beneficial to improving the electrocatalytic performance. Integrating the photothermally induced thermal energy and the electrocatalytically active functionality into the bifunctional electrode is desirable for practical applications of energy-saving water splitting, but it is still challenging. Herein, we report the photothermally active Fe-tannic coordination network (Fe-Tan) nanoparticles covered on the oxidized iron foam (O-IF) show the remarkably boosted oxygen evolution electrocatalysis under irradiation of NIR laser. Benefiting from ligand-to-metal charge transfer between Fe3+ and tannic acid (TA), the Fe-Tan/O-IF electrode exhibits a broad absorption from UV to NIR region, which can rapidly generate effective heat-localization effect when exposed to NIR light irradiation. Bearing the coupled photothermal-electrocatalytic functionalities, the Fe-Tan/O-IF electrode irradiated by NIR light presents greatly enhanced performances and favorably improved kinetics in OER electrocatalysis processes compared with that under dark condition, which is superior to most of TA-based/derived OER electrocatalysts and compares favorably to many photothermal OER electrocatalysts previously reported.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000745076000002

Lithium-rich oxides have been a longstanding research target because of their large capacity involving extra oxygen-redox reactions. In this work, we report the synthesis, electrochemical properties, electronic structure, and structural evolution of O2-type lithium-rich layered oxide Li1.22-x Ru0.78O2. A robust Ru-O layered framework without Ru migration allows for unveiling the solid-state electrochemistry of O2-type lithium-rich layered oxides with possibility of a large yet stable extra capacity for oxygen-redox reaction. Using a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption/emission spectroscopy, and in situ/ex situ X-ray diffraction, we clarified that O2-Li1.22-x Ru0.78O2 delivers a large capacity of 200 mAh g(-1) in association with Ru5+/Ru4+ and Ru4+/Ru3+ two-electron redox reactions under a solid-solution process, but with no contribution from the extra oxygen-redox reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000783326500001

The potential energy surface of the reactive system was explored at the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ level of theory and the electronic energies were refined by means of single-point CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ(-f) calculations. Solvent effects were taken into account by using a solvent continuum model (COSMO) and by adding explicit water molecules. The results show that the first step in the reaction mechanism corresponds to a nearly symmetric DielsAlder addition of the singlet oxygen molecule to the imidazole ring to yield an endoperoxide, in agreement with experimental evidence. The intermediate formed can evolve along two different reaction paths leading to two isomeric hydroperoxides and, eventually, to open-chain or internally cyclised oxidised products. Water plays a significant role in stabilising the reaction structures by solvation and by acting as a bifunctional catalyst in the elimination/addition reaction steps.

The potentiostatic method was used to study the electrochemical behaviour of the oxygen reduction reaction on the prepared catalyst electrodes in potassium hydroxide electrolyte. A pure polymer carbon electrode and a cobalt chloride doped polymer carbon electrode were shown to be active in oxygen reduction, but the electrode containing cobalt chloride seemed the most active. The main reaction product at the pure polymer electrode is hydrogen peroxide, involving two electrons, whereas at a poly(CoCl2) electrode the reduction process reaches partly its ultimate state, and involves at most three electrons.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000306339400006

In this work, decahedral BiVO4 nanoparticles with a uniform size are synthesized by the solution-chemistry method. The effects of different heat treatment temperatures on their morphology, size, crystallinity and photocatalytic oxygen evolution activity were systematically studied. The morphology and structure characterization show that with the increase of heat treatment temperature, the size and crystallinity of BiVO4 nanoparticles increase significantly, while the proportion of defective oxygen decreases. The photocatalytic oxygen evolution tests show that although the oxygen evolution activity of the as-prepared BiVO4 without heat treatment is the highest, the photocorrosion phenomenon is aggravated by the defective structure. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) results show that photocorrosion is assigned to the reduction and dissolution of vanadium (VI) within BiVO4 by photogenerated electrons. Improving the material's crystallinity can effectively enhance the V-O bond energy and avoid the photocorrosion effect to a certain extent. The proposed BiVO4 calcined at 400 degrees C exhibits good stability and catalytic activity for catalytic oxygen evolution. Under visible light (lambda > 420 nm) irradiation, the photocatalytic oxygen evolution rate in Fe(NO3)(3) solution is 149.3 mu mol h(-1). In Fe-2(SO4)(3) solution, the oxygen evolution rate is 95.4 mu mol h(-1), corresponding to an AQY of 37.1% at 420 nm. The experimental results show that NO3- ions also play the role of electron scavengers.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000797064000001

For x = 2, oxygen evolution occurs at three distinct steps, whereas for x less than or equal to 1.8, oxygen evolution occurs only in two steps and for x = 1 it becomes negligible. A decrease in the Pr-content in the fluorite compositions lowers the TPD peak intensity. The samples resorb oxygen on annealing at 650 degrees C in flowing oxygen and cooling the samples to room temperature revealing the reversible oxygen uptake and release feature. The electrical conductivity increases as a function of Pr-content in this series. For x less than or equal to 1.8, the temperature dependent conductivity shows breaks at two temperature regions and the magnitude of the break is pronounced in Pr-rich compositions. Also, the activation energy decreases as the Pr-content is increased in this series. The present results suggest that the fluorite compositions in this system might have potential as catalysts to store/transport/release oxygen reversibly.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0217-9792	1793-6578		WOS:000080193400008

Herein, a selenium doped hierarchical Ni-based electrocatalyst was fabricated. Nickel nanosheet array (NNA) was firstly electrodeposited on stainless steel, and then selenium was doped in the NNA to form a hierarchical nanosheet structure via a hydrothermal process. The effect of hydrothermal temperature and duration on the OER performance were investigated. Results shown that after selenization at 140 degrees C for 12 h, the NNA electrodeposited for 30 min performed best OER performance with a current density of 50 mA cm-2 at overpotential of 365 mV and a small Tafel slope of about 34 mV dec-1. This work provides a valuable strategy to design high efficiency electrocatalysts and shows the universality of selenization for improving catalytic performance.

Here we provide a consistent picture of the entire reaction cycle by analyzing how the active species, (FeO2+)-O-IV can react with hydrogen peroxide to produce O-2 and regenerate the Fe2+ catalyst. These results are also relevant in view of the analogies with important enzyme-catalyzed oxidation reactions.									70	3	0	0	22	1	71			0947-6539			WOS:000184479300026	12866086

We report a variation of similar to 0.15 V in the overpotential of the recently discovered IrOx/SrIrO3 OER catalysts, which directly correlates with the structural parameters of the as-synthesized SrIrO3 epitaxial films. This variation is caused by both extrinsic area enhancement and intrinsic electronic structure modification driven by defect formation. These correlations not only indicate that microscopic film defects play an important role in the activity of the IrOx/SrIrO3 catalyst but also provide readily accessible parameters predictive of the activity post-transformation to IrOx/SrIrO3. Establishing strong associations between the catalytic activity and key structural and electronic parameters, rather than synthetic variables, provides important guidance to control and study these complex catalysts independent of the synthetic technique.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1948-7185			WOS:000463960700014	30883127

Teflon-bonded electrodes were studied whose true electrochemical surface area was estimated from the double layer capacitance. It was found that the activity of the spinels increases relative to that of Co3O4 in the order: Co3O4<NixCo3-xO4 much less than CuxCo3-xO4<LixCo3-xO4. A relation was found between the activity and the dopant content. The enhanced activity is determined by two inter-related factors: the cation distribution in the two types of spinel site (8a) and (16d) and the number and energetics of the active sites formed on the surface in the anodic peak potential range preceding the oxygen evolution potential. Tafel slopes between 2.3RT/F and 2.3(2RT/3F) at Co3O4, CuxCo3-xO4 and NixCo3-xO4 electrodes and 2.3(RT/2F) at LixCo3-xO4 electrodes were observed; the slopes decrease with increasing dopant content. The reaction order with respect to OH- concentration was nearly two. The data are consistent with two mechanisms: (i) Bockris's electrochemical oxide path with the second step, MOH+OH--->MO+H2O+e(-), as rate determining for Co3O4, CuxCo3-xO4 and NixCo3-xO4 and with the third step, 2MO-->2M+O-2, as rate determining for LixCo3-xO4; (ii) Krasil'shchikov's path with the third step, MO--->MO+e(-), as rate determining for the first three spinels and with the fourth step, 2MO-->2M+O-2, as rate determining for the Li doped oxide (M=Co4+). The decrease of the Tafel slopes with increasing dopant content is assumed to be due to the formation of active sites with larger charge transfer coefficients.

The heterogenous material acts as highly active and durable electrocatalyst toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution. The LaNiO3 nanoparticles prepared by the conventional method require an overpotential of 490 mV, while the one synthesized by the proposed polyol method in this work requires only 410 mV, and the value can be further decreased to merely 390 mV for the as-prepared LaNiO3-NCNTs at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The high performance of this composite material could be due to the exposure of more active sites existing on the surface of LaNiO3 nanoparticles and the connected NCNTs, which improve the charge transfer from the active LaNiO3 surface to the electrode substrate and therefore outperforms the electrocatalytic activity in comparison to commercial RuO2 catalyst. The synthesis method reported here opens a new way to design advanced perovskite oxides for OER even other applications.									13	1	0	0	0	0	14			1862-6300	1862-6319		WOS:000449941800024

We present a systematic investigation on fine-tuning of the interlayer environment of MnO2 nanosheets by intercalation through a facile cation exchange with inexpensive first-row transition metal cations, including Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+,Zn2+, and Fe3+ ions. Among them, the Ni-intercalated MnO(2 )nanosheets show remarkably enhanced OER activity and long-term stability, compared to pristine MnO2 nanosheets. The overpotential of 330 mV at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) is observed for the Ni-intercalated MnO2 nanosheets. The ehancement mechanism of OER is studied by comparing physiochemical properties, such as the oxidation state of Mn, the interlayer distance, the increase in the disorder/twisting of MnO6 octahedra, and the interlayer cooperative binding of water molecules. The Ni intercalation, different from other metal cations, strengthens the Mn-O bond perpendicularly to the layer chains to facilitate the interlayer catalysis possibly between two Mn sites, and thus promotes the efficiency of oxygen evolution.									25	1	0	0	3	0	25			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000463960000017

Here, we investigate a series of Mn-, Co-, Fe-,and Zn-doped nickel oxides usingoperandoUV-vis spectroscopy coupledwith time-resolved stepped potential spectroelectrochemistry. The Ni2+/Ni3+redox peak potential is found to shift anodically from Mn- < Co- < Fe-< Zn-doped samples, suggesting a decrease in oxygen binding energeticsfrom Mn- to Zn-doped samples. At OER-relevant potentials, using opticalabsorption spectroscopy, we quantitatively detect the subsequent oxidationof these redox centers. The OER kinetics was found to have a second-orderdependence on the density of these oxidized species, suggesting a chemicalrate-determining step involving coupling of two oxo species. The intrinsicturnover frequency per oxidized species exhibits a volcano trend with thebinding energy of oxygen on the Ni site, having a maximum activity of similar to 0.05 s-1at 300 mV overpotential for the Fe-doped sample.Consequently, we propose that for Ni centers that bind oxygen too strongly (Mn- and Co-doped oxides), OER kinetics is limited byO-O coupling and oxygen desorption, while for Ni centers that bind oxygen too weakly (Zn-doped oxides), OER kinetics is limitedby the formation of oxo groups. This study not only experimentally demonstrates the relation between electroadsorption free energyand intrinsic kinetics for OER on this class of materials but also highlights the critical role of oxidized species in facilitating OERkinetics.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000798986400017	35442661

A facile but highly precise composition-controlled electrodeposition technique was employed to synthesize CoNi-layered double hydroxides (LDH) within tens of seconds; the 0.3/0.2 CoNi-LDH NSs showed the best current density (76.9 mA cm(-2) at 1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl)). However, the poor adhesion of the CoNi-LDH NSs on the Ni foam decreased the current density to 82% at 1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) after 10 h. The manipulation of the surface of the Ni foam via the deposition of Ni nanocones (NCs) enhanced the long-term stability to 92.6% and led to an overpotential of 366 mV and a current density of 111.5 mA cm(-2) at 1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 1 M KOH alkaline solution. Thus, the CoNi LDH NSs on the surface-modified Ni foam are a promisingly efficient and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The structures, compositions, and morphologies of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and electron microscopy. Application of the catalyst cathodes in Li-O-2 batteries was also investigated. Compared with GNS cathode, dramatic improvements in the catalytic performance of the composite cathode have been obtained. This superior performance is attributed to the synergistic benefits from the GNS with three-dimensional structure and the MnO2 nanoflakes that cover them. The GNS not only increase the electrical conductivity of the composite cathode but also offer enough space for the tri-phase reaction and to buffer the volume changes during cycling. Due to their intrinsically high catalytic activity, the MnO2 nanoflakes could efficiently boost the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, improving the electrocatalytic performance of the MnO2/GNS composite as cathode for Li-O-2 batteries.					66th ISE Satellite Annual Meeting on New Devices for Energy Conversion and Storage66th ISE Satellite Annual Meeting on New Devices for Energy Conversion and Storage	OCT 01-03, 2015OCT 01-03, 2015	ISEISE	Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINAHong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	19	2	0	0	1	0	20			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000379802500008

Herein, we fabricate mesoporous thin-walled CuCo2O4@C with abundant nitrogen-doped nanotubes via coaxial electrospinning technique. Benefiting from high catalytic activity of ultrasmall CuCo2O4 particles, double active specific surface area of mesoporous nanotubes, and strong coupling with N-doped carbon matrix, the obtained CuCo2O4@C exhibits outstanding oxygen electrocatalytic activity and stability, in terms of a positive onset potential (0.951 V) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a low overpotential (327 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Significantly, when used as cathode catalyst for Zn-air batteries, CuCo(2)O4@C also displays a low charge-discharge voltage gap (0.79 V at 10 mA crn(-2)) and a long cycling life (up to 160 cycles for 80 h). With desirable architecture and excellent electrocatalytic properties, the CuCo2O4@C is considered a promising electrocatalyst for Zn-air batteries.									155	14	0	0	4	0	159			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000418393300114	29166026

There is a dynamic exchange of metal cations between the electrocatalyst and electrolyte. Understanding how iron in the electrolyte gets incorporated in the nickel hydroxide electrocatalyst is critical for pinpointing the roles of Fe during water oxidation. Here, we report that iron incorporation and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly coupled, especially at high working potentials. The iron incorporation rate is much higher at OER potentials than that at the OER dormant state (low potentials). At OER potentials, iron incorporation favors electrochemically more reactive edge sites, as visualized by synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we show that Fe incorporation can suppress the oxidation of Ni and enhance the Ni reducibility, leading to improved OER catalytic activity. Our findings provide a holistic approach to understanding and tailoring Fe incorporation dynamics across the electrocatalyst-electrolyte interface, thus controlling catalytic processes.									33	0	0	0	0	0	33			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000718279300019	34641670

Here, we hydrothermally synthesized a novel OEC, cobalt germanium hydroxide, CoGeO2(OH)(2). The inherent Co-bonded hydroxyl groups facilitate the formation of active oxygen evolution reaction intermediates. Meanwhile, the facile leaching of Ge at the OEC-electrolyte interface contributes to surface reconstruction, generating Co-based (oxy)hydroxides, which would weaken its lattice constraint and suppress the excessive corrosion in the OEC bulk. As a result, CoGeO2(OH)(2) reveals good catalytic activity and stability. This CoGe-based OEC achieves the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(@10mA)) of similar to 340 mV, and the turnover frequency of similar to 0.08 s(-1). And the electrolysis kept at similar to 10 mA cm(-2) could be sustained for over 350 h. In addition, this p-type CoGeO2(OH)(2) is demonstrated to be an effective electrocatalytic overlayer on n-type Ta3N5 photoanode, remarkably decreasing the onset for nearly 400 mV and increasing the photocurrent density at 1.23 V-RHE about 3.8 times.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000444793000039	30137963

CRTA is a type of smart temperature program based on a feedback system that uses any experimental signal related to the process evolution for commanding the temperature evolution. In this work, an instrument that uses the gravimetric signal for CRTA control has been designed and used for the study of two high-pressure gas-solid reactions: the highly exothermic thermal oxidation of TiC under high pressure of oxygen and the reduction in Fe2O3 under high pressure of hydrogen. Advantages of CRTA for discriminating overlapping processes and appraising kinetic reaction mechanisms are shown.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000459610500054

The obtained RuO2@LSCF-NFs are used as a cathode catalyst for lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) batteries. The RuO2@LSCF-NFs catalyst exhibits enhanced catalytic performance with a decreasing voltage gap of 283mV lower than the cell with the LSCF-NFs catalyst. The improved performance is attributed to the superior catalytic activation of RuO2 nanoparticles toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER).									22	4	0	0	1	0	24			2199-692X			WOS:000405241900006

In this paper, a Co/Fe-imidazole-based bimetal-organic framework nanosheet array grown on a nickel foam [MIL-53(Co-Fe)/NF] was prepared via a facile solvothermal process. Surprisingly, MIL-53(Co-Fe)/NF shows excellent OER activity with overpotential as low as 262 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), much lower than those of the single metal-based MOFs, and even comparable to that of the precious RuO2. The results indicate that the synergetic effect of co-doped Fe and Co makes a crucial contribution to the high activity of the bimetal-based MOF catalyst. Additionally, this catalyst also displays outstanding long-term electrochemical durability for at least 80 h.									60	3	0	0	3	0	61			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000504106900004	31807741

Herein, the Ru species are doped into the complex of magnetite and FeNi-layered double hydroxide by a one-step oil bath method, and a self-supporting binder-free bifunctional electrocatalyst was synthesized on the surface of iron foam (named Ru-Fe3O4@FeNi-LDH/IF). The unique 3D core-shell microflower structure of Ru-Fe3O4@FeNi-LDH/IF, the combination of active ingredient and conductive substrate, together with the doping of Ru may immensely provide a large number of active sites, adjust the electronic structure, accelerate electron transfer, and thus greatly improve the electrocatalytic activity and durability. It is worth mentioning that when Ru-Fe3O4@FeNi-LDH/IF is used as the anode and cathode for overall water splitting, only 1.52 V battery voltage can generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and also maintain a prominent stability for at least 36 hours. This work provides a feasible strategy for heteroatom-doping LDH as a bifunctional electrocatalyst.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000696319100001	34528985

Metallic Ni3Fe nanoarray is firstly fabricated on carbon cloth as efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. Co, N-dual doped carbon shell derived from metal organic framework is coated on the Ni3Fe nanoarray to enhance electrocatalytic activity and stability. The as-prepared composite catalyst only needs a low overpotential of 170 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) current density in alkaline solution, and an overpotential of 370 mV in carbonate buffer solution. Moreover, the catalyst exhibit excellent durability in both alkaline and carbonate electrolyte. Good conductivity, rich active sites, fast electron transport process and synergistic effect between Ni3Fe and the doped carbon together contributes to the efficient catalytic performance. This synthesis approach provides a new way to develop efficient nonprecious metal based electrocatalysts for water oxidation and other energy-related applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The calculated oxygen and carbon abundances resulting from helium burning can then be used to constrain the variation of the fundamental constants.

The results indicate that AC significantly strengthens the cathodic reaction, especially the oxygen reduction reaction. Simultaneously, hydrogen evolution reaction occurs when the limiting diffusion current density of oxygen reaches, and thus, i(corr) sharply increases with the increase in AC density. Additionally, when AC is imposed, the X70 steel exhibits higher SCC susceptibility in the simulated seawater, and the susceptibility increases with the increasing AC density. The SCC mechanism is controlled by both anodic dissolution (AD) and hydrogen embrittlement (HE) with the interference of AC.									5	2	0	0	0	0	7			1996-1944			WOS:000442117300025	29941807

However, poor charge separation and transfer ability as well as sluggish surface oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics of the photoelectrode severely hinder the advance in PEC performance. Herein, a facile electrodeposition method was used to integrate Mo-doped NiFe-layered double hydroxide onto a NiOx/Ni-protected Si photoanode for enhanced PEC water oxidation. Mo doping contributed to an increased amount of oxygen vacancies, whereas a dynamic surface self-reconstruction was induced by Mo leaching under PEC OER conditions. This led to enhanced PEC performance with an onset potential of 0.87 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), a photocurrent density of 39.3 mA cm(-2)at 1.23 V vs. RHE, a fill factor of 0.38, and a solar-to-oxygen conversion efficiency of 5.3 %, along with a stability of 130 h continuous PEC reaction. The performance was superior to that of the undoped NiFe-LDH/NiOx/Ni/Si (4.3 %), which was attributed to the elevated interface charge separation, fast charge transfer, and accelerated OER kinetics.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000556370600014	32400054

In this work, we report cobalt nanoparticle-embedded porous carbon nanofibers with inherent N- and F-doping as binder-free bifunctional electrocatalysts with excellent activity for both the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) in an alkaline medium. Single-step electrospinning of a solution of the polymer mixture (carbon precursor) and the cobalt precursor followed by controlled pyrolysis with an intermediate reduction step in H-2 (to reduce cobalt oxides to cobalt) was utilized to synthesize an integrated freestanding catalyst. The fabricated catalyst with effective structural and electronic interaction between the cobalt metal nanoparticles and the N- and F-doped carbon defect sites showed enhanced catalytic properties compared to the benchmark catalysts for ORR and OER (Pt, Ir, and Ru). The ORR potential at the current density of -3mAcm(-2) was 0.81 V-RHE and the OER potential at a current density of 10mAcm(-2) was 1.595 V-RHE, resulting in a E of only 0.785V.									24	3	0	0	0	0	24			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000393186100007	27813238

The exploration and rational design of high-performance, durable, and nonprecious metal bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is highly desired for the large-scale application of rechargeable ZABs. Herein, an effective and straightforward coupling approach is developed to fabricate high-performance bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts based on novel nanostructured amorphous bimetal Fe/Co hydroxide/oxide nanoparticles (10-20 nm) inlaid on multiwalled N-dopted carbon nanotubes (FeCo-DHO/NCNTs). Fe/Co nanoparticles achieve a maximum contact area on the NCNTs, effectively facilitating the rapid electron transport and preventing the aggregation of nanoparticles. Consequently, the as-prepared FeCo-DHO/NCNTs show a half-wave potential of 0.86 V for ORR and a low operating potential of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER in 1.0 (M) KOH, superior to most bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts reported so far. Moreover, the assembled all-solid-state zinc-air batteries with FeCo-DHO/NCNTs catalyst as the air electrode demonstrate remarkable stability over long-term cycling and excellent charging-discharging performance, with a low voltage gap (1.085 V at 60 mA cm(-2)) and high energy efficiency (60% at 10 mA cm(-2)) under ambient conditions.									75	9	0	0	2	0	75			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000448257300012

However, the effect of Fe3+ doping in Co3O4 spinel remains poorly understood, mainly because the surface state of a catalyst is difficult to characterize. Herein, a bifunctional oxygen electrode composed of spinel Co2FeO4/(Co0.72Fe0.28)(Td)(Co1.28Fe0.72)(Oct)O-4 nanoparticles grown on N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) is designed, which exhibits superior performance to state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts. Theoretical calculations and magnetic measurements reveal that the introduction of Fe3+ ions into the Co3O4 network causes delocalization of the Co 3d electrons and spin-state transition. Fe3+ ions can effectively activate adjacent Co3+ ions under the action of both spin and charge effect, resulting in the enhanced intrinsic oxygen catalytic activity of the hybrid spinel Co2FeO4. This work provides not only a promising bifunctional electrode for zinc-air batteries, but also offers a new insight to understand the Co-Fe spinel oxides for oxygen electrocatalysis.									266	23	0	0	16	0	267			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000480142900001	31317625

While there have been numerous studies focusing on layered TMDs, the ORR and OER catalytic activity trends of various cubic pyrite TMDs have not been systematically explored yet. Herein, we investigated 12 earth abundant element-based pyrite TMDs (MX2, where M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and X = S, Se, Te) using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We initially constructed surface Pourbaix diagrams to determine the most stable surface coverages under the reaction conditions and found that the oxidized surfaces are most energetically preferred in all cases. We then calculated the binding free energies of reaction intermediates (O*, OH* and OOH*) and established their scaling relations. The electrochemical ORR and OER performances were then displayed on two-dimensional volcano plots, which suggest MnS2, FeS2, NiTe2 and CoSe2 to be ORR active, and CoTe2 and CoSe2 to be OER active. In addition, we built multivariate linear regression models to predict Delta G(O*) and Delta G(OH*) using only atomic and bulk properties to readily estimate the catalytic activities of pyrite TMDs and to explore correlations between those properties. Particularly, we found that the electron affinity and bulk Bader charges of metal atoms are critical in determining the ORR and OER catalytic activities, which could be used as a guidance for future catalyst design.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000839631600001	35960004

A highly efficient electrocatalyst should possess both active sites and high conductivity; however, the loading of powder catalysts on electrodes may often suffer from the large resistance between catalysts and current collectors. This work reports a class of bulk amorphous NiFeP materials with metallic bonds from the viewpoint of electrode design. The materials reported here perfectly combine high macroscopic conductivity with surface active sites, and can be directly used as the electrodes with active sites toward high OER activity in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes. Specifically, a low overpotential of 219 mV is achieved at the geometric current density 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline electrolyte, with the Tafel slope of 32 mV dec(-1) and intrinsic overpotential of 280 mV. Meanwhile, an overpotential of 540 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) is attained in an acidic electrolyte and stable for over 30 h, which is the best OER performance in both alkaline and acidic media. This work provides a different angle for the design of high-performance OER electrocatalysts and facilitates the device applications of electrocatalysts.									330	19	0	0	10	0	332			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000407995100005	28639333

The samples synthesized in open air exhibit fine size and uniform distribution of particles. However, the samples synthesized in autoclave reveal larger size particles, a greater number of defect states, and oxygen vacancies. The sample synthesized in open air elucidates a lower water oxidation overpotential of 170mV to retrieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The results predict that morphological features play a vital role in electrocatalytic activity compared to defect states and vacancies. To avoid the prevailing confusion regarding the electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors and batteries, the actual pseudocapacitor behavior of the synthesized samples has been studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanic charge-discharge characteristics performed at different scan rates and applied currents, respectively. The synthesized samples exhibit higher capacitance retention (>95%) during continuous CV cycling.

Layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets of NiCoAI, Co-Al oxide nanoparticles and Co-Ni oxide nanoparticles were prepared and studied for the first time as OER catalyst. Among all the subjected catalysts, the binary LDH comprise of NiCoAI showed comparatively high catalytic activity than Co-Al oxide nanoparticles and Co-Ni oxide nanoparticles. The Co-Al and Co-Ni oxide nanoparticles showed current densities of 34.6 and 24.5 mA cm(-2), respectively at 1V in 0.3 M KOH solution. However at the same conditions, NiCoAl-LDH showed comparatively low overpotential, high current density (40.8 mA cm(-2)) and lower Tafel slope. The low overpotential and high catalytic activity of NiCoAI-LDH stipulate the possibility to reduce the demand of precious, rare earth and expensive transition metal catalyst in electrochemical water splitting for OER.

Bifunctional catalysts enable higher performance and lower cost than two single-function catalysts. Supported single-atom bifunctional catalysts are therefore of great economic interest and scientific importance. Density functional theory calculations are used to design SACs, isolated transition metal anchored on graphdiyne (TM@GDY), for oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions in alkaline media. A dual-volcano plot is constructed to thoroughly describe and predict the catalytic activity toward ORR and OER processes on TM@GDY materials. The results demonstrate that GDY could provide a unique platform for synthesizing uniform SACs with high catalytic activity toward ORR and OER. The theoretical evaluations show that Ni@GDY and Pt@GDY catalysts possess comparable electrocatalytic activity for ORR and OER in alkaline media. The study not only provides deep insights into the catalytic activity of TM@GDY, but also guides the design of GDY based SACs.									27	2	0	0	0	0	27			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000486175400075	31468048

Series of rare earth dual metal-doped Pr2O3 electrocatalysts (Pr2CeMO3, M = Sm, Yb, Er) were successfully fabricated by employing solgel treatment. The antimicrobial and electrochemical applications of grown products were studied along with physical properties using advanced techniques such as FESEM, EDX, XRD, FTIR, IV, CV, LSV, EIS, and ECSA. The prepared products retain the monoclinic Pr2O3 structure with the successful doping of rare-earth elements. From the FESEM analysis, grown products have the grainy conglomerate shape, icy monoclinic boxes, irregular lamellar shaped, and well-crystallized grains with the plate-like morphology. EDX has confirmed the presence of metal elements Pr, Ce, Sm, Yb, and Er in grown samples. The electrochemical measurements exhibited the enhancement by dual-doping, and Pr2CeSmO3 has an extraordinarily low overpotential of 189 mV to reach 10 mAcm(-2) density and lower Tafel slope (75 mV/dec) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic efficiency of Pr2CeSmO3 electrocatalyst for OER is extremely longlasting for (> 16 h). The antibacterial test showed that all grown single and dual-doped nanostructures have good antibacterial performance, but Pr2CeSmO3 exhibits strong inhibition activity towards E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and P. vulgaris bacterial strains with maximum inhibition zone diameter 30, 32, 35, and 31 mm, respectively. This low-cost method for the production of rare earth dual metal-doped materials holds a lot of potential for making efficient catalysts, electrochemical energy-conversion devices, and economical antibacterial agents.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000807161800003

Stability tests of the samples in aqueous acidified LiCl, LiOH and LiTFSI in H2O/DME showed that Co3O4/Ni and Co3O4-PVP/Ni are relatively stable in alkaline and neutral environments, with Co3O4/Ni being relatively more stable. For NiCo2O4/Ni and NiCo2O4-PVP/Ni, the low weight percentage change of cobalt in LiTFSI in H2O/DME suggests that they are mostly stable in this electrolyte. The electrochemical performance of the Li-air cell was evaluated using Li anode and a LAGP ceramic separator with above mentioned electrolytes. Co3O4 showed slightly higher catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for the first three cycles. The cell with LiTFSI in H2O/DME as aqueous catholyte showed that NiCo2O4 is a better catalyst for the OER than for the ORR, while the reverse was observed when LiOH was used as the electrolyte.					15th Asian Conference on Solid State Ionics (SSI)15th Asian Conference on Solid State Ionics (SSI)	NOV 27-30, 2016NOV 27-30, 2016		IIT Patna, Patna, INDIAIIT Patna, Patna, INDIA	4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000411879100008

The interfacial morphology and interface reaction of Ti-Al laminated composite anode were analyzed by means of scanning electron microscopy(SEM) and EDS. The Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5 were got by typical oxygen evolution model coating ingredient(mole ratio of Ir to Ta was 7:3) and the sides of Titanium were examined by using electrochemical workstation.This text results indicated that the interfacial thickness varied from 462nm to 792nm with the increase of holding time and increased from 396nm to 1.25 mu m with temperature rising. Under the same condition of hot-pressing diffusion welding,the thickness of diffusion interface layer with aluminum sheets by previous cold rolling (1.25 mu m) is thicker than non-cold rolling(924nm),increasing by 35.28%. Ti-Al laminated composite anodes by using hot-pressing diffusion welding showed better performances than the industrial titanium.The oxygen evolution anode showed the best performance by holding at 833 K for 2h under the pressure of 6MPa.This will play a role in the energy saving.

The sputtered films possess excellent mechanical stability and corrosion resistance at the high anodic potentials where oxygen evolution takes place. Their catalytic activity has been assessed using the conventional electrochemical methods of cyclovoltammetry and steady state polarisation techniques. A morphology factor assessing the catalyst active surface for a series of sputtered samples with varying thickness/loading has been determined and correlated to the catalytic efficiency. It has been proven that iridium oxide is a very efficient catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The best performance with anodic current density of 0.3 A cm(-2) at potential of 1.55 V (versus RHE) has shown the 500 nm thick film containing 0.2 mg cm(-2) catalyst. The results obtained have also demonstrated the advantages of the reactive magnetron sputtering as simple and reliable method for deposition of efficient and cost effective catalysts for PEM electrolysis application.

Here, a Ce-doped Co9S8 core-shell nanoneedle array (Ce-Co9S8@CC) supported on a carbon cloth has been designed and developed to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of the OER. Profiting from valance alternative Ce doping, a fine core-shell structure and vertically aligned nanoneedle arrayed architecture, Ce-Co9S8@CC integrates modulated electronic structure, highly exposed active sites, and multidimensional mass diffusion channels; together, these afford a favorable catalyzed OER. Ce-Co9S8@CC exhibits remarkable performance in the OER in an alkaline medium, where the overpotential requires only 242 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER; this is 70 mV superior to that of Ce-free Co9S8 catalyst and other counterparts. Good stability and impressive selectivity (nearly 100 % Faradic efficiency) are also demonstrated. When integrated into a two-electrode OER//HER electrolyzer, the as-prepared Ce-Co9S8@CC displays a low operation potential of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability, thus demonstrating great potential for economical water electrolysis.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000787182000001	35384094

Here we report the significant enhancement of the OER activity of electrodeposited NiOx films resulting from the combined effects of using cerium as a dopant and gold as a metal support. This NiCeOx-Au catalyst delivers high OER activity in alkaline media, and is among the most active OER electrocatalysts yet reported. On the basis of experimental observations and theoretical modelling, we ascribe the activity to a combination of electronic, geometric and support effects, where highly active under-coordinated sites at the oxide support interface are modified by the local chemical binding environment and by doping the host Ni oxide with Ce. The NiCeOx-Au catalyst is further demonstrated in a device context by pairing it with a nickel-molybdenum hydrogen evolution catalyst in a water electrolyser, which delivers 50mA consistently at 1.5V over 24 h of continuous operation.									366	13	0	0	24	0	369			2058-7546			WOS:000394119200002

A novel non-noble metal-based self-supported carbon nanofiber (Ni delta Fe4-delta-CNF) catalyst was developed. First, the network precursors were prepared from polyvinylpyrrolidone, transition metal acetate, and N, N-dimethylformamide via the electrostatic spinning method. After annealing at high temperature, the precursors were transformed into three-dimensional (3D) multi-pore structure material. The synthesized Ni1Fe1-CNF catalyst has a lower initial potential (230 mV) and overpotential (280 mV, 10 mA.cm(-2)) in electrolyte solution of 1 mol.L-1 KOH, and its performance is superior to that of commercial RuO2. Meanwhile, ZAB was assembled by mixing Ni1Fe1-CNF catalyst with commercial Pt/C catalyst as the air cathode. Compared with commercial RuO2+Pt/C ZAB, Ni1Fe1-CNF+Pt/C ZAB had a higher power density (122 mW.cm(-2)), lower charging voltage and better charge/discharge cycle stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-4861			WOS:000774474200004

Herein, the Au/Ir nanochains (Au/Ir NCs) are synthesized via one-pot, hydrothermal method. By virtue of jagged surface with abundant atomic defects, the Au/Ir NCs are demonstrated much more active than commercial IrO2 electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction under alkaline media. The potential of the Au/Ir NCs sustains 1.53 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with no obvious decease under current density at 10 milliamps per square centimeter, while that of IrO2 increase to 1.65 V vs RHE after stability tests for ca. 32 h. The durability as well as the activity of Au/Ir NCs is attributed to the electronic interaction between Au and Ir, which is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000452782100008

The transformation process from MnCO3 to MnOx at four different annealing temperatures has been investigated. XRD data show that MnOx samples obtained at 250, 350, 450, and 550 A degrees C are corresponding to MnCO3, the mixture of MnCO3 and epsilon-MnO2, pure epsilon-MnO2 and pure Mn3O4, respectively.

The electrocatalytic measurements of different MnOx samples for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have been systematically studied. The results show that epsilon-MnO2 microspheres exhibit excellent OER activity, with an overpotential of 0.42 V (at j = 10 mA cm(-2)) and a low Tafel slope of 75.7 mV dec(-1), which is much better than the other MnOx samples.

We report a novel method to prepare the excellent electrocatalysts for the H2O2 production derived from the fungal hyphae (with bioconcentrated dye), which was used as the main sources of C, N, O, and P. The optimizational electrocatalyst had a large surface area with many nanopores, which exhibited excellent activity, selectivity, and stability towards O-2 reduction when producing H2O2 in an alkaline media and good activity, selectivity, and stability in neutral media. A flow cell with the optimizational electrocatalyst as cathode and IrO2 as anode exhibited exceptionally high Faradaic efficiency, H2O2 productivity, and energetic efficiency in alkaline media. This maintained the Faradaic efficiency and H2O2 productivity when driven by commercial dry battery (1.5 V) or by solar-energy battery (2.5 V or 3.0 V). This is helpful in developing an electrocatalyst for H2O2 production and practical industrial application of O-2 reduction to H2O2 by electrocatalysis. This low-cost, simple, and readily scalable approach offers insight for developing a novel electrocatalyst for other electrochemical reactions, such as hydrogen evolution reactions, oxygen evolution reactions, and CO2 reduction reactions.

Herein, we developed NiS2-MoS(2)heterostructured nanoflowers with 430-810 nm in diameter using a simple one-pot hydrothermal method. The resultant catalysts required the potential of 1.5 V to afford 10 mA/cm(2) toward the oxygen evolution reaction, lower than that of MoS2 nanoflowers. Hydrogen evolution reaction was enhanced by the introduction of Ni into MoS2 nanoflowers with 194 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm(2). Moreover, the cell assembled by the NiS2-MoS2 heterostructured nanoflowers could drive the voltage of 1.67 V at 10 mA/cm(2)using two-electrode system in 1.0 mol/L KOH solution toward overall water splitting. Structure-controlled synthesis of NiS2-MoS2 nanoflowers, directing the construction of heterointerfaces with the exposure of the abundant active sites, greatly altered the electron distribution due to synergistic effect between Ni-S and Mo-S. Due to the unique structure, NiS2-MoS(2)heterostructured nanoflowers could effectively catalyze overall water splitting. Graphic abstract NiS2-MoS(2)heterostructured nanoflowers exhibited the enhanced overall water splitting activity in alkaline media due to more positive charges for Ni atoms and more surplus electrons for S.[GRAPHICS]									11	1	0	0	0	0	10			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000543331900005

The architecture and composition of the 3D catalysts are particularly tuned. The outstanding structural and component features of the as-prepared 3D catalysts are characterized by the vertically grown NiCo2O4 nanocone/NiO nanosheet core/shell structure and Ni decorated 3D-conductive networks, which largely prompt the catalytic performance. The hybrid catalyst with core/shell nanocone array structures exhibits superior bifuncational activities for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with an overpotential of 240 and 120 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The Tafel slope of the optimal 3D electrode is about 43 and 58 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline electrolyte for OER and HER, respectively. An alkaline electrolyzer constructed by two symmetric NiCo2O4@NiO@Ni electrodes delivers splendid activity toward overall water splitting with a current of 10 mA cm(-2) at only approximate to 1.60 V and almost no deactivation after 10 h. This work provides a promising strategy to design ternary core/shell electrodes as high performance Janus catalysts for overall water splitting.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000418244400005

Herein, we successfully synthesized an oxygen electrocatalyst consisting of Ni nanoparticles purposely interpenetrated into mesoporous NiO nanosheets (porous Ni/NiO). Benefiting from the contributions of the Ni and NiO phases, the well-established pore channels for charge transport at the interface between the phases, and the enhanced conductivity due to oxygen-deficiency at the pore edges, the porous Ni/NiO nanosheets show a potential of 1.49 V (10 mA cm(-2)) for the OER and a half-wave potential of 0.76 V for the ORR, outperforming their noble metal counterparts. More significantly, a Zn-air battery employing the porous Ni/NiO nanosheets exhibits an initial charging-discharging voltage gap of 0.83 V (2 mA cm(-2)), specific capacity of 853 mAh g(Zn)(-1) at 20 mA cm(-2), and long-time cycling stability (120 h). In addition, the porous Ni/NiO-based solid-like Zn-air battery shows excellent electrochemical performance and flexibility, illustrating its great potential as a next-generation rechargeable power source for flexible electronics.									73	6	0	0	2	0	72			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000519642000001	34138276

Herein, we demonstrate an interfacial engineering strategy to prepare Fe-doped CoP nanocubes/CoP nanosheet arrays heterostructure supported on carbon cloth (denoted as CoFeP/CoP/CC). The resultant CoFeP/CoP/ CC heterostructure catalyst possesses abundant heterogeneous interfaces, which enables the exposure of reaction active sites and possibly modulation of electronic structure of the catalyst. Furthermore, this strong interfacial coupling of CoFeP and CoP as well as the integration structure on the carbon cloth guarantee high electronic conductivity and enhanced mechanical stability. Benefiting from these advantages, the CoFeP/CoP/CC-heterostructure exhibits high electrocatalytic OER performance with a low overpotential of 240 mV for reaching a current density of 10 mA cm-2, which outperforms the commercial noble metal RuO2 (255 mV) and many reported TMPs-based electrocatalysts. Moreover, this CoFeP/CoP/CC catalyst shows a remarkable OER catalytic stability over 100 h. This work provides an effective avenue for the design of the high-performance OER catalyst by interfacial engineering strategy.(c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, we develop a one-step facile hydrothermal approach to successfully synthesize nickel sulfide nanospheres from nanosheets. The micro-nanostructure and surface metal valence state can be engineered by tuning the phase and composition of the nickel sulfides. Electrochemical results show that a pyrite-type NiS2 catalyst with surface enriched Ni3+ sites exhibits enhanced catalytic activities towards tri-functional electrocatalysis: overpotentials of 241 mV and 147 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH for OER and HER, respectively; and a half-wave potential of 0.80 V for ORR. As for overall water-splitting, a low voltage of 1.66 V is required at 10 mA cm(-2), which is even lower than that required by RuO2 + Pt/C (1.69 V). The catalyst also exhibits robust durability: the overpotential reduces by only 4.8% over 37 h of chronopotentiometry and maintains almost 100% faradaic efficiency. The hierarchical NiS2 nanospheres also promote performance in a Zn-air battery with lower discharging-recharging overpotentials (0.8 V) and a longer cycle life (>120 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2)) than Pt/C. Furthermore, theoretical analysis demonstrates that the pyrite-type NiS2 with octahedrally coordinated Ni3+ active sites tailors the adsorption free energies of H* and OH* intermediates to optimal values, contributing to the outstanding electrochemical properties. This work sheds light on the rational design of highly efficient transition metal chalcogenide nanocatalysts through composition and surface chemistry engineering for next-generation energy conversion technologies.									49	4	0	0	3	0	50			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000508175800053

Due to the complex coordination fields and highly hybridized metal-oxygen bonds, the generalized synthesis method of thin-layered 3d TMOs with large size is still lacking. Here, graphene oxide (GO) template-assisted method is developed to fabricate large-size two-dimensional 3d transition metal oxides (TMO), e.g. Mn2O3, Mn3O4, Fe2O3, Co3O4, CoO, NiO. The electrostatic attraction between electronegative GO templates and electropositive metal cations is used to confine the growth of hydroxide precursor along GO surface. The precise control of pH and temperature is essential for tailoring the balance between heterogeneous nucleation and heteroepitaxy growth which leads to different morphology, size and granularity of the final metal oxides. A mild annealing treatment of layered hydroxide precursor is necessary to achieve smooth and uniform surface morphology for thin layered TMO nanosheets. The unique advantages of these thin layered structures have been proved by the enhanced oxygen evolution reaction catalytic performance, because the distorted crystalline structure contributes to the oxygen exchange and accelerates the charge transfer process. Especially for thin layered Co3O4, it exhibits a superior OER activity with a low overpotential of 275 mV at 10 mA cm-2, even better than that of benchmark IrO2 electrocatalyst. This unique synthesis strategy is believed to facilitate the design and fabrication of advanced two-dimensional materials.									2	2	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000647729600002

Incorporation of Mo(V) and Mo(VI) into TiO2 significantly enhances the electrical conductivity of TiO2. During the synthesis of Ir nanoparticles on TiO2-MoOx, Mo(V) is oxidized to Mo(IV) with suppressing oxidation of Ir(III) to Ir(IV). Consequently, Ir/TiO2-MoOx forms higher fraction of the OER-active Ir(III) species on Ir surface enhancing OER activity of Ir catalyst. During OER, the chemical interaction between Mo and Ir keeps in Ir(III) and lessens the dissolution of Ir(III), improving the durability of Ir/TiO2-MoOx. Thus, Ir/TiO2-MoOx exhibits superior OER activity and durability. The single cell test results demonstrate that, as an anode catalyst, Ir/TiO2-MoOx can improve the performance and durability of the PEMWE cell than Ir black.									30	1	0	0	0	0	30			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000572833100007

The motivation of this study comes from the fact that this material has not been studied as an electrocatalyst in acidic media, although past studies showed a high electronic conductivity and a high corrosion resistance. Co-Pt bronze without metallic Pt was obtained by solid-state synthesis and hot aqua regia rinsing. The OER activity was found to be among the highest as a material without Ir and Ru in acidic media, and it showed extremely high electrochemical stability in the OER potential range. Its oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was obtained after potential cycles down to the hydrogen region, which formed a thin Pt metallic layer over the oxide. While its specific activity was not more than that of pure platinum nanoparticles, its durability against the potential cycles was much higher.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3				2073-4344		WOS:000440016400005

Herein, we demonstrate that the oxygen vacancies (OVs) in Nb2O5 (Nb2O5-x) nanorods exhibit significantly enhanced ENRA activity, with an ammonia faradaic efficiency of 85.1% and selectivity of 90.8% at -1.1 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Introducing OVs not only improves the surface activity but also facilitates the charge transport of Nb2O5-x. Moreover, the OV-engineered surface of Nb2O5-x alters the semiconducting behaviour of the catalyst by suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to improve the selective production of ammonia. We believe that this research will pave the way for the development of defect-engineered metal oxide catalysts for the selective ENRA process.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000772508300001

Herein, 2D nanosheets with randomly cross-linked CoNi layered double hydroxide (LDH) and small CoO nanocrystals were designed and synthesized via in situ reduction and interfacedirected assembly in air. The formation of CoNi LDH/CoO nanosheets was attributed to the strong extrusion of hydrated metal-oxide clusters driven by the interfacial tension. The obtained loose and porous nanosheets exhibited low crystallinity due to the presence of numerous defects. Owing to the orbital hybridization between metal 3d and O 2p orbitals, and electron transfer between metal atoms through Ni-O-Co, a number of Co and Ni atoms in the CoNi LDH present a high +3 valency. These unique characteristics result in a high density of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active sites, improving the affinity between OH- and catalyst, and resulting in a large accessible surface area and permeable channels for ion adsorption and transport. Therefore, the resulting nanosheets exhibited high catalytic activity towards the OER. The CoNi LDH/CoO featured a low onset potential of 1.48 V in alkaline medium, and required an overpotential of only 300 mV at a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2), while displaying good stability in accelerated durability tests.									148	24	0	0	7	0	149			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000371797000012

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties of the obtained sample (FeNiOxHy/NF) were investigated under alkaline conditions (1.0 M KOH). The optimized FeNiOxHy/NF displays extremely small overpotentials of only 195 and 306 mV to achieve the current densities of 10 and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively, and shows almost no potential attenuation during the 160 hours of stability test even the current density is up to 1000 mA cm(-2), demonstrating brilliant OER catalytic activity and durability. FeOOH and the NiOOH produced from the in situ oxidation of the surface Ni atoms of the NF substrate are the active sites. The synergistic effect between FeOOH and NiOOH is responsible for the high performances. To our knowledge, the high activity and stability of FeNiOxHy/NF catalyst outperform almost all of the OER catalysts reported to date. These informative findings are valuable not only for understanding the mechanism of OER but also for the design of cheap transition metal catalysts for industrial water electrolysis at high current densities.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000541979200001

As a result, the optimized CoNi-C-200 sample with a Co/Ni atomic ratio of 9:1 exhibits a lower overpotential of 408 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a smaller Tafel slope of 83 mV dec(-1) compared to as-prepared CoNi-C-100 (410 mV, 93 mV dec(-1)), CoNi-C-400 (420 mV, 94 mV dec(-1)), and Co-C (447 mV, 97 mV dec(-1)). Moreover, it shows an excellent long-term stability during 5000 CV sweeps. Such improved performance can be attributed to the unique morphology and the synergistic effects of CoNi alloy nanoparticles and conductive carbon matrix in the composite.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000432348300024

The synthesized particles were characterized using XRD, SEM, TEM, FTIR and XPS to study the morphological and structural features. The fuel rich condition provides a reducing atmosphere limiting further oxidation of synthesized nanoparticles but produces more carbon residue on the catalyst surface compared to fuel lean conditions. Increasing the fuel ratio (phi value) from 0.5 to 1.75 increases the crystallite size and lowers the surface area. The electrocatalytic performance studies conducted by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) indicate significant changes in catalytic activities due to variation in synthesis conditions. The LSV results obtained between potential of -1.2 V and 0.75 V shows all the three cobalt oxide catalysts to have bifunctional properties of being active for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with Co synthesized at lower fuel ratio (phi = 0.5) displaying the highest current density. The onset potential for Co (phi = 0.5) is more positive than Co (phi = 1) and Co (phi = 1.75). The kinetic current density for Co (phi = 0.5) is 6.45 mA cm(-2) and decreases with increase in fuel ratio. The OER current starts at similar to 0.45 V for all the catalysts showing maximum density for Co (phi = 0.5) and gradually decreasing for catalysts synthesized at higher fuel ratio.

Therefore, a similar element substitution approach is reported in this study to regulate the catalyst's crystallinity. Adjustment of the cobalt content in NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) by the solvothermal method enables the control of c-a interfacial site of the material. In 1 M KOH, the as-obtained Co1.98-NiFe LDH exhibited a low overpotential of 236 mV to achieve 20 mA cm-2. It also showed excellent stability, operating steadily at high current densities for 96 h without significant degradation in 1 M KOH or alkaline artificial and natural seawater electrolytes.

However, its ORR/OER activities are sluggish. Here, we investigated the roles of iron dopants in the Fe-doped NiCoP (Fe-NiCoP) in order to boost its ORR/OER kinetics. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the Fe dopant effectively modulates the electron conductivity of NiCoP and reduces binding energies of the reaction intermediates towards rate-determining steps of ORR and OER. A binder-free 3D microflowers morphology of the Fe-NiCoP embedded in the amorphous carbon layer (Fe-NiCoP@C) catalyst on the nickel foam was prepared as the air cathode for the hybrid sodium-air battery (HSAB). The HSAB displays a discharge voltage of 2.74 V at 0.01 mA cm(-2) with excellent round trip efficiency of 93.26 % at the 500th cycle and state-of-the-art power density of 621 mW g(-1).									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000623240700002

Herein, we demonstrate the rational construct of cost-effective MoOx@NiS2 hybrid nanostructures as bifunctional electrocatalysts and the electrode material of supercapacitor. Microstructural analysis shows that the hybrid is a kind of hierarchical heterostructure composed of open and porous NiS2 nanowrinkles in situ grown on non-stoichiometric MoOx nanorods, which greatly improves the conductivity, and effectively maximized the electrochemical surface area. As expected, the MoOx@NiS2 hybrid show remarkable electrocatalytic performance in alkaline media, such as overpotentials of 101 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 278 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and a low cell voltage of 1.62 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the hybrid nanostructures present a high specific capacitance 1050 A/g at 1 A/g with ultra-long stability in 6 M KOH. The strategy proposed here introduces a new perspective about the development of efficient earth-abundant bifunctional elecrocatalysts and electrode materials for superior energy conversion and storage devices.

Combining them mass and ion transfer through the thickness, and large with electrically conductive 2D nanosheets is anticipated to achieve further improved performance in electrocatalysis. In this work, we in situ hybridized 2D cobalt 1,4-benzenedi-carboxylate (CoBDC) with Ti3C2Tx (the MXene phase) nanosheets via an interdiffusion reaction-assisted process. The resulting hybrid material was applied in the oxygen evolution reaction and achieved a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a potential of 1.64 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode and a Tafel slope of 48.2 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 M KOH. These results outperform those obtained by the standard IrO2-based catalyst and are comparable with or even better than those achieved by the previously reported state-of-the-art transition-metal-based catalysts. While the CoBDC layer provided the highly porous structure and large active surface area, the electrically conductive and hydrophilic Ti3C2Tx nanosheets enabled the rapid charge and ion transfer across the well-defined Ti3C2Tx-CoBDC interface and facilitated the access of aqueous electrolyte to the catalytically active CoBDC surfaces. The hybrid nanosheets were further fabricated into an air cathode for a rechargeable zinc-air battery, which was successfully used to power a light-emitting diode. We believe that the in situ hybridization of MXenes and 2D MOFs with interface control will provide more opportunities for their use in energy-based applications.									397	25	0	0	28	0	401			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000404808000058	28514161

This layered intermetallic material was prepared via Sn-flux high-temperature annealing. The electrocatalytic ink, prepared with the ball-milled LaCo2P2 catalyst at the mass loading of 0.25 mg/cm(2), shows OER activity at pH = 14, reaching current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA/cm(2) under the overpotential of 400, 440, and 460 mV, respectively. Remarkably, the electrocatalytic performance remains constant for at least 4 days. Transmission electron microscopy reveals the formation of a catalytically active CoOx shell around the pre-catalyst LaCo2P2 core during the alkaline OER. The core serves as a robust support for the in situ-formed electrocatalytic system. Similar studies under pH = 0 reveal the rapid deterioration of LaCo2P2, with the formation of LaPO4 and amorphous cobalt oxide. This study shows the viability of layered intermetallics as stable OER electrocatalysts, although further developments are required to improve the electrocatalytic performance and increase the stability at lower pH values.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000787374700012	35291765

The performance of a metal-air battery heavily relies on two fundamental electrocatalytic reactions, that is, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which take place at the air cathode during battery discharging and charging, respectively. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives stand out as promising candidate catalysts for the once sluggish redox reactions at the cathodes of MABs, due to their unique merits of crystalline porous structures and tunable chemistry. These distinct characteristics of MOFs offer an effective way to introduce bifunctionality (catalytic activity for ORR and OER in the case of MABs) through the design and synthesis of MOF-based catalysts with large surface area, well-developed porous networks, smooth electron and mass transfer pathways and active sites with different catalytic preferences. Herein, this review summarizes recent advances in the design and synthesis of MOF-based catalysts for a range of MABs, including Li-, Zn-, Al-, Fe- and Na-air batteries. By the demonstration of representative examples, this review also discusses the underlying mechanisms for the origin of bifunctional performance and enhanced catalytic activity with MOF-based catalysts. Future challenges and prospects for both MOFs and MABs are also proposed at the end of this review.									59	8	0	0	1	0	59			2405-8297			WOS:000495867200075

Herein, we report such a bifunctional material which is new by its morphology and enables the provision of a reliable power output as a supercapacitor electrode as well as oxygen evolution in water splitting as an efficient electrocatalyst material. A coral-shaped NiCo2O4 nanostructure was developed by the oriented attachment pathway of nanocrystal building blocks, which can provide efficient energy storage and energy conversion bifunctional properties which are not realized earlier. Here, the less stable and highly reactive (111) planes of NiCo2O4 small single crystals grow at the expense of the (100) planes in the.111. direction to decrease the total interfacial free energy and get attached with each other to form the coral-shaped nanostructure. The outstanding battery-like capacitive features (e.g., maximum specific capacitance of 1297 F.g(-1) or specific capacity of 180 mA.h.g(-1), energy density of 45 W.h.kg(-1) at high charge-discharge rates, and a minimum stability of 10,000 cycles) with a high Coulombic efficiency (>96%) are attributed to faster ion intercalation between an electrode and an electrolyte and redox pseudocapacitance, high conductivity, and highly porous coral morphology that decreases diffusion distances and exposure of mixed metal valence at the surface. In addition to these features, a higher Ni2+ content enhances the adsorption of OH- species on the material surface and a high electrochemically active surface area of the material attributed to a lower overpotential (0.29 V) and longer stability at a higher current density during precious metal-free electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2574-0962			WOS:000557375200086

Rationally engineering chemical composition, electronic structure, and micro/nanoarchitecture of these catalysts represent a promising way to achieve their desired performance. Herein, we propose a general synthetic approach to prepare a series of porous nanosheets of bi- and tritransition-metal phosphides with homogeneous compositions supported by reduced graphene oxide (the resultant samples are termed as rGO/(MMb)-M-a-P for simplicity, including rGO/CoFe-P, rGO/NiFe-P, rGO/CoNi-P, and rGO/CoNiFe-P). The resultant sheet-on-sheet hierarchical nanocomposites exhibit outstanding OER performance with low overpotentials, small Tafel slopes, and long durability in alkaline electrolyte, which compete favorably with the state-of-the-art OER catalysts reported to date. The remarkable electrocatalytic performances originate from their hierarchical structures and tailorable compositions with optimized electronic structure modulation and synergistically electroactive sites, together with large active surface area and smooth mass/charge transports. This synthetic route could serve as a facile and controllable process to simultaneously realize the architectural manipulation, compositional regulation, and electronic modulation for low-cost OER electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant metal elements in practical water electrolysis and other energy applications.									18	2	0	0	2	0	19			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000503918300046	31746179

Engineering inexpensive yet active electrocatalysts for water oxidation is mandatory for the cost-effective generation of solar fuels. Herein, we propose a novel hierarchical porous Ni-Co-mixed metal sulfide (denoted as NiCoS) on Ti3C2Tx MXene via a metal-organic framework (MOF)-based approach. Benefiting from the unique structure and strong interfacial interaction between NiCoS and Ti3C2Tx sheets, the hybrid guarantees an enhanced active surface area with prominent charge-transfer conductivity and thus a superior activity toward oxygen evolution reactions (OERs). Impressively, the hierarchical NiCoS in the hybrid is converted to nickel/cobalt oxyhydroxide-NiCoS assembly (denoted as NiCoOOH-NiCoS) by OER measurement, where NiCoOOH on the surface is confirmed as the intrinsic active species for the consequent water oxidation. The hybrid material is further applied to an air cathode for a rechargeable zinc-air battery, which exhibits low charging/discharging overpotential and long-term stability. Our work underscores the tuned structure and electrocatalytic OER performance of MOF derivatives by the versatility of MXenes and provides insight into the structure-activity relationship for noble metal-free catalysts.									182	10	0	0	8	0	184			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000438179000059	29888588

Herein, well distributed nanopolyhedron (NP) Co3O4 grown on iron (Fe) encapsulated in graphitic layers on a nitrogenated, porous two-dimensional (2D) structure, namely, a C2N matrix, (NP Co3O4/Fe@C2N), presents an outstanding bifunctional catalytic activity with a comparable overpotential and Tafel slope to those of benchmark Pt/C and Ir02. The rationally designed atomic configuration of Co3O4 on the C2N matrix has a well-controlled NP morphology with a (111) plane, leading to bifunctional activities for the ORR and OER. Interestingly, the specific interaction between the NP Co3O4 nanoparticles and the C2N matrix introduces synergistic coupling and changes the electronic configuration of Co atoms and the C2N framework. Benefiting from the synergistic coupling of Co3O4 with C2N matrix, the NP Co3O4/Fe@C2N electrocatalyst exhibits exceptionally high stability and an even lower charge discharge overpotential gap of 0.85 V at 15 mA cm-2 than that of the Pt/C+IrO2 catalyst (1.01 V) in Zn air batteries.

Herein, we report that negatively charged iron (III) hydroxide colloidal particles, can significantly enhance the OER activity of NiFeOH in alkaline media. NiFeOH is grown on nickel foam in a supersaturated iron(III) salt solution, which also contains a high content of Fe(OH)(3) colloidal nanoparticles, forming free-standing NiFeOH@C-x electrodes (with x being the Fe (OH)(3) concentration). The interface between NiFeOH and Fe(OH)(3) colloidal particles, as manifested by the unique volcano-like holes on the NiFeOH@C-x surface, is likely the OER active sites. In comparison to Fe (OH)(3)-free NiFeOH, NiFeOH@C-1000 exhibits a 40-fold enhancement of the OER activity, confirming the significant effect of Fe(OH)(3) colloidal nanoparticles in boosting the OER activity, likely as a result of enhanced charge transfer from Ni2+ to Fe3+ that facilitates the adsorption of key reaction intermediates. Furthermore, by coupling the free-standing NiFeOH@C-1000 electrode with commercial Pt/C, full water splitting can occur and reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under a cell voltage of 1.51 V, which is lower than that (1.59 V) based on noble metal catalysts of RuO2 + Pt/C.

Two-dimensional transition-metal hydroxides have good prospects for the OER. Herein, 2D hierarchical FeLDH(FeCo)/Co(OH)(2) (LDH=layered double hydroxide) arrays were fabricated by growing 2D-ZIF-67 (ZIF=zeolitic imidazolate framework) on carbon cloth, transformation of 2D-ZIF-67 into Co(OH)(2), and electrodeposition of FeLDH(FeCo) on Co(OH)(2) at ambient temperature. The optimized hierarchical catalyst exhibits high OER activity that requires a small overpotential of only 242 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) (279 mV for 100 mA cm(-2)) and prolonged durability for 100 h at 20 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH. The FeLDH(FeCo)/Co(OH)(2) interfaces are observed to be the electrocatalytically active centers for the OER. The interfaces contribute to accelerating the OER kinetics owing to fast transfer of intermediate oxygen species. Furthermore, the FeCo alloy promotes electron transfer among the newly formed interfaces related to CoOOH in the OER process, which leads to improved durability. This work gives insight into the design and synthesis of hierarchical bimetallic hydroxide arrays with high OER activity and durability, as well as understanding of the origin of the OER promotion by metals and metal hydroxides.									28	2	0	0	1	0	28			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000473931600001	31087548

With the rise of pyrolysis temperature (700 degrees C-1000 degrees C), the morphological evolution and structural changes of resultant FeCoNC samples and the subsequent differences in oxygen reduction performances were also explored. The maximum power density of the FeCoNC-modified air-cathode microbial fuel cell (MFC) reaches 1769.95 mW m(-2), which is superior to that of Pt/C-modified MFC (1410.31 mW m(-2)). A N-2 adsorption-desorption experiment reveals the presence of abundant mesoporous in the structure of the as-prepared FeCoNC material pyrolized at 900 degrees C (FeCoNC-900), and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller model discloses its high specific surface area. Rotating disk electrode test results demonstrate a four-electron transfer pathway for the FeCoNC-900 catalyst. Furthermore, the MFC device modified by the as-prepared FeCoNC materials shows excellent durability and stability as cathode oxygen reduction catalyst. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Our studies illustrate how detailed mechanistic information is obtained about surface reactions by separating complex problems into elementary reaction steps on well-defined materials. This methodology is particularly powerful for the study of fundamental structure-reactivity relationships, including issues of site specificity. Methods for synthesizing and characterizing oxidized surfaces with specific types of oxygen coordination are described to demonstrate how a model system can be constructed. We have focused on the C-O bond formation step in the oxidation of methane via our investigations of methyl radical reactions with surface oxygen and the microscopic reverse, methyl evolution from adsorbed methoxy. A combination of infrared and electron energy loss spectroscopies is used to identify specific intermediates on the surface.

The reversible Ni(II)/Ni(III) oxidation/reduction reaction was monitored using an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM). The coupling of powerful electrochemical methods, EQCM and ac-electrogravimetry, and physicochemical techniques, EDX, XPS and in situ XRD, provided results clarifying the corresponding mass transfer mechanisms. Ac-electrogravimetry identified the nature, in terms of molar mass, kinetics, and concentration variation of all reversibly transferred species associated with the redox reactions involving Ni and water molecules. This methodology demonstrated a reversible anion intercalation/deintercalation into/from the interlayer spacing, in agreement with the redox reactions leading to modulation of the electric charge of the layers. This phenomenon was also identified by in situ XRD. In addition, the variation of the pH at the LDH/electrolyte interface via a catalyzed oxygen evolution reaction (OER) leads to cation electro-adsorption/desorption onto/from the external LDH surfaces.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000512222000032

Herein, a series of novel and robust bifunctional boride-based electrodes are successfully fabricated using a versatile Et2NHBH3-involved electroless plating (EP) approach via deposition of nonprecious boride-based catalysts on various substrates. Owing to the unique binder-free porous nodule structure induced by the hydrogen release EP reaction, most of the nonprecious boride-based electrodes are highly efficient for overall water splitting. As a distinctive example, the Co-B/Ni electrode can afford 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of only 70 mV for HER and 140 mV for OER, and can also survive at large current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) for over 20 h without performance degradation in 1.0 (M) KOH. Several boride-based two-electrode electrolyzers can achieve 10 mA cm(-2) at low voltages of around 1.4 V. Moreover, the facile EP approach is economically viable for flexible and large size electrode production.									102	7	0	0	3	0	103			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000444537800011

Specifically, isostructural trimetallic framework Fe1.7Co0.3Ni1.0-ppat possesses a minimum overpotential (291 mV), small Tafel slope (91.65 mV dec(-1)), and high stability up to 83 h. The enhanced catalytic performance could be mainly ascribed to the synergistic effect of Ni-II equivalent occupancy in pillars and Co/Fe-III in layers.

Although effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for OWS (HER and OER) are highly desired, designing and constructing such suitable materials is full of challenges to overcome several difficulties, involving slow kinetics, differences in catalytic mechanisms, large overpotential values, and low round-trip efficiencies. In this work, we reported a new bifunctional electrocatalyst Ru/RuO2-MoO2 catalyst (RRMC) via a redox solid phase reaction (RSPR) strategy to achieve the high electrocatalytic activity of OWS. Briefly, due to the restricted transport behavior of atoms in solid state precursor, the designed redox reaction occurred between the adjacent part of RuO2 and MoS2, forming Ru/RuO2 hybrid NPs and MoO2 plane. Therefore, the newly formed Ru/RuO2 hybrid NPs and MoO2 plane were tightly combined and used as an electrocatalyst for OWS. Benefiting from the exposed active sites and optimized electronic structure, the RRMC sample annealed at 500 degrees C (RRMC-500) exhibited low overpotential for HER (18 mV) and for OER (260 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) under alkaline conditions. Especially, a low cell voltage of 1.54 V was required at 10 mA cm(-2) under alkaline condition. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Non-noble Co-based nanomateria Is are considered as earth-abundant and effective catalysts to lower overpotential and increase polarization current density of OER. In this work, we reported, for the first time, a "rapid solvent-evaporation" strategy for the synthesis of three-dimensional (3D) cobalt complex hierarchical architectures constructed by two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets. The 3D structured cobalt complexes have excellent performances in catalyzing OER with lower onset potential, overpotential, Tafel slope and better stability than commercial IrO2. Superior electrochemical performances would be beneficial from the unique 3D structure. This extremely simple method for 3D Co complex with good OER activities makes the complex be promising commercial OER catalyst to replace earth-rare and expensive IrO2.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2045-2322			WOS:000493277900017	31666571

However, defect formation in the C network during deoxygenation compromises the charge carrier mobility in the reduced material. Understanding the mechanisms of the thermal reactions is essential for defining alternative routes able to limit the density of defects generated by carbon evolution. Here, we identify a dual path mechanism in the thermal reduction of graphene oxide driven by the oxygen coverage: at low surface density, the O atoms adsorbed as epoxy groups evolve as O-2 leaving the C network unmodified. At higher coverage, the formation of other O-containing species opens competing reaction channels, which consume the C backbone. We combined spectroscopic tools and ab initio calculations to probe the species residing on the surface and those released in the gas phase during heating and to identify reaction pathways and rate-limiting steps. Our results illuminate the current puzzling scenario of the low temperature gasification of graphene oxide.									355	5	0	0	21	0	356			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000297380900036	21846143

Herein, a superior OER catalyst of Fe substituted a-Co(OH)2 (a-Co1-mFem(OH)2) has been synthesized by taking advantage of the large layered structure and good conductivity of a-Co(OH)2, in conjunction with the rich redox properties and abundance of Fe. The atomically layered alpha-Co4Fe(OH)x (Co/Fe = 4) nanoplates could effectively catalyze water oxidation at the onset potential of 0.26 V and its turnover frequency (TOF) was 11 and 5 times higher than those of alpha-Co(OH)2 and IrO2, respectively. The increased activity could be attributed to strong electronic interactions between Co and Fe. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations also demonstrated that the theoretical overpotential of alpha-Co1-mFem(OH)2 is obviously lower than that of alpha-Co(OH)2 and thus Fe doped alpha-Co(OH)2 displays a better activity. Moreover, the correlation between the Fe content and activity could be plotted as a volcano curve.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488			INSPEC:17293885

However, it is still challengeable to develop low-cost and efficient OER electrocatalysts. Herein, we present a combination strategy via heteroatom doping, hetero-interface engineering and introducing conductive skeleton to synthesize a hybrid OER catalyst of CNTinterconnected iron-doped NiP2/Ni2P (Fe-(NiP2/Ni2P)@CNT) heterostructural nanoflowers by a simple hydrothermal reaction and subsequent phosphorization process. The optimized Fe-(NiP2/Ni2P)@CNT catalyst delivers an ultralow Tafel slope of 46.1 mV dec(-1) and overpotential of 254 mV to obtain 10 mA cm(-2), which are even better than those of commercial OER catalyst RuO2. The excellent OER performance is mainly attributed to its unique nanoarchitecture and the synergistic effects: the nanoflowers constructed by a 2D-like nanosheets guarantee large specific area and abundant active sites; the highly conductive CNT skeleton and the electronic modulation by the heterostructural NiP2/Ni2P interface and the hetero-atom doping can improve the catalytic activity; porous nano structure benefits electrolyte penetration and gas release; most importantly, the rough surface and rich defects caused by phosphorization process can further enhance the OER performance.

Due to their high OER activity, transition metal-based nanomaterials have become potential low-cost substitutes for Ir/Ru-based OER electrocatalysts in an alkaline environment. Herein, holey Fe3O4-coupled Ni(OH)(2) sheets (Ni(OH)(2)-Fe H-STs) were easily achieved by a simple mixed-cyanogel hydrolysis strategy. The two-dimensional (2D) Ni(OH)(2)-Fe H-STs with ca. 1 nm thickness have a high specific surface area, abundant unsaturated coordination atoms, and numerous pores, which are highly favorable for electrocatalytic reactions. Meanwhile, the introduction of Fe improves the conductivity and regulates the electronic structure of Ni. Due to their special structural features and synergistic effect between the Fe and Ni atoms, Ni(OH)(2)-Fe H-STs with an optimal Ni/Fe ratio show excellent OER activity in a 1 M KOH solution, which significantly exceeds that of the commercial RuO2 nanoparticle electrocatalyst. Furthermore, Ni(OH)(2)-Fe H-STs can be grown on nickel foam (NF), and the resulting material exhibits enhanced OER activity, such as a small overpotential of 200 mV and a small Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1), than that of Ni(OH)(2)-Fe H-STs without NF.

Charge transfer from Au to SrCoOx effectively weakens the Co-O bond, meanwhile Co-O-Au synergistic bonding remarkably decreases the migration barrier of oxygen ions. Fast oxygen evolution occurs at the perimeter of the Au/SrCoOx interface, and the chemical potential gradient of O2- drives inner ion diffusion to the surface. Consequently, bias-free topotactic phase reduction from perovskite SrCoO3-delta to brownmillerite SrCoO2.5 has been achieved at room temperature. Our finding explores a new dimension to accelerate oxygen ion kinetics in transition-metal oxides from the aspect of interfacial bond activation, which is significant for developing oxide/noble-metal interfaces for high-efficiency ion migration and redox catalysis at low temperature.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000712453200001	34713881

In this work, we report an efficient and stable NiCo2S4/N, S co-doped reduced graphene oxide (NCS/NS-rGO) electrocatalyst for water splitting, in which NCS microspheres are composed of one-dimentional (1D) nanorods grown homogeneously on the surface of NS-rGOs). The synergetic effect, abundant active sites, and hybridization of NCS/NS-rGO endow their outstanding electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in both alkaline and neutral conditions. Furthermore, NCS/NS-rGO employed as both anode and cathode in a two-electrode alkaline and neutral system electrolyzers deliver 10 mA/cm(2) with the low cell voltage of 1.58 V in alkaline and 1.91 V in neutral condition. These results illustrate the rational design of carbon-supported nickel-cobalt based bifunctional materials for practical water splitting over a wide pH range.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000671541600004

The sluggish kinetics of these reaction is a challenging situation on the surface of electrodes which imposes large over-potential and affects the energy output of fuel cells. Although the platinum-based electrode materials have excellent activity toward ORR/OER but their high cost limits commercialization of fuel cells. To deal with this problem, platinum-free electrode materials has aroused the considerations of scientists. The present work is proposed to study the oxygen reduction reaction and water oxidation on the surface of xAg(2)O-yPrO(2)/gamma-Al2O3/Glassy-Carbon. The ORR was studied electrochemically via cyclic voltammetry on the surface of these nano-catalysts while the OER was investigated via cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry in alkaline media. The mechanism of ORR on catalysts surface was enquired and the results indicate that ORR followed two electrons pathway in case of 10PrO(2)/gamma-Al2O3/Glassy-Carbon while four electrons reduction pathway is identified on surface of others catalysts which divulged that addition of silver with praseodymium shifted the mechanism from 2e(-) to 4e(-) pathway. The electrocatalysts featured the stability during multiple scans and no corrosion of electrode in OER/ORR is observed. Different kinetic parameters for both reactions are determined which affirmed that both ORR and OER on the active surface of catalysts is irreversible and diffusion controlled. 4Ag(2)O-6PrO(2)/gamma-Al2O3 is indicated to be proficient electro-catalyst among other members of the series, having greater value of mass transport and diffusion coefficients. The bi-functionality of all electrocatalysts are verified by their electrochemical responses in alkaline medium. The catalytic reduction of oxygen and oxidation of water by these electro-catalysts imitates their potential as electrode material in batteries and unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFC) technology for energy production as substitute of platinum electrode.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000807066600001

The electrochemical performance of LNO was measured in both solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and SOEC modes at 750 degrees C in air. The results suggest that LNO oxygen electrodes exhibit high electrochemical activity and the processes related to oxygen adsorption, dissociation and diffusion dominate the oxygen evolution reaction on the electrodes. Electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) measurements imply that LNO shows better oxygen surface exchange performance than conventional LSM and LSCF electrodes, because of its special crystal structure with flexible non-stoichiometric oxygen. Significant performance degradation was observed during polarization at 500 mA cm(-2) and 750 degrees C in the SOEC mode for 48 h. XRD and XPS results confirmed that high-order Ruddlesden-Popper La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10 phases have great contributions to the performance degradation of LNO oxygen electrodes related to anodic current polarization at 500 mA cm(-2) and 750 degrees C.									34	2	0	0	0	1	36			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000405158100039

Herein, porous delta-MnO2/carbon composite fibers (delta-MnO2/CCFs), where the interconnected and ultrathin delta-MnO2 nanosheets are uniformly coated on electrospun carbon fibers (CFs), have been successfully fabricated via a facile liquid deposition. This unique structure ensures the high utilization of the catalytic sites, sufficient spaces to accommodate the discharge products, and rapid diffusion of lithium ions and oxygen within the porous catalyst, thus providing suitable characteristics of an electrocatalyst for high-performance Li-O-2 batteries. As a consequence, suppressed overpotentials, especially oxygen evolution reaction overpotential and desirable rate capability are achieved by the Li-O-2 cells with these d-MnO2/CCFs as electrocatalysts. In addition, the effectiveness of the catalyst and its critical role during the electrochemical growth of the discharge product (Li2O2) are further analyzed.									51	7	0	0	1	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000354395400025

Herein, we successfully synthesize a three-dimensional interlinked non-noble metal-based bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, which is composed of Co-based metal organic frames (ZIF-67) derived Co3O4 polyhedrons and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). For the introduction of CNTs, the electron transfer rate of the Co3O4 polyhedron was obviously enhanced. Due to the synergetic effect between the CNTs and Co3O4 polyhedron, the as-synthesized Co3O4-CNTs hybrids displayed excellent electro-activity for ORR and OER. When served as ORR electrocatalyst, low onset potential (0.89 V), high half-wave potential (0.76 V) vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and limiting current density (-6.28 mA cm(-2)) were obtained in O-2-saturated 0.1M KOH solution. In addition, when used for OER, only low overpotential of 370 mV was needed for yielding 10 mA cm(-2) current density with 87 mV dec(-1) of Tafel slope in 1M KOH solution. What's more, the obtained Co3O4-CNTs hybrids also exhibited superior stability, implying its potential application possibility for novel energy-storage and transformation systems as electrode materials.									26	2	0	0	1	0	26			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000487849800064

The redox mediators show promise for improving electrochemical performance, for example, by decreasing the overpotential for oxygen evolution reactions. However, their catalytic activity degrades after a certain number of cycles, leading to an increase in overpotential with increasing cycle number. The shuttle effect of redox mediators has been considered to be associated with the failure of Li-O-2 batteries containing the redox mediators, but, this effect does not fully explain the capacity fading observed with Li-O-2 batteries. In this study, it is demonstrated that the failure of these types of Li-O-2 cells occurs because of an irreversible decomposition of the redox mediators on Li metal, which both degrades Li metal and depletes the redox mediators. We also show that this decomposition occurs even though oxygen dissolved in the electrolytes forms stable protective layers of lithium oxides on the Li surface. One model redox mediator, 10-methylphenothiazine, is examined in a case study to clarify the failure mechanism of Li-O-2 batteries.									49	4	0	0	4	0	49			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000402387900059

We report the synthesis of 3D NiCo2O4 hierarchical nanocactus arrays (NiCo2O4-NC) comprising 1D nanowires and 2D nanoflakes on carbon cloth by controlling the concentration of ionic liquid (IL) 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C12MIm]Ac). For both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and asymmetric supercapacitors (ASC), NiCo2O4-NC shows enhanced electrochemical performance. Impressively, for the OER process, NiCo2O4-NC exhibits an overpotential of 294 mV at 10 mA cm-2, Tafel slope of 77 mV dec- 1, and superior stability. As a supercapacitor electrode, NiCo2O4-NC exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1842 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, outstanding rate capability, and superior cycling stability. Moreover, NiCo2O4-NC-based ASC produces a high energy density of 46.1 Wh kg- 1 at power density of 557.4 W kg -1. The outstanding electrochemical performance is attributed to the distinct structure of NiCo2O4-NC with the merits of both 1D nanowires and 2D nanoflakes. This work not only offers an effective mean to design nano -structured metal oxide arrays with improved electrochemical performance but also lays the foundation of studying the application potential of ILs in the synthesis of multifunctional materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000861034400005

Hydrogen generation by electrolysis of water is an important process for the production of renewable energy resources. The high cost, less abundance, poor stability, and carbon monoxide poisoning of currently used noble metals as electrocatalyst is the bottleneck of this technology. These limitations can be conquered by using transition metal phosphates. In particular, cobalt phosphate-based materials show favorable performance and stability for electrolytic water splitting. Furthermore, cobalt phosphates in combination with semiconductors act as a co-catalyst in solar water oxidation. The variable oxidation state of cobalt is beneficial for fast electron transfer. The phosphate group due to its unique lattice structure helps in the adsorption and dissociation of water on the surface of the electrode. This review will provide a brief outline of the structure and activity relation between cobalt phosphate-based materials. The electrocatalytic applications of these materials in water oxidation, hydrogen generation, and overall water splitting have also been discussed. The role of cobalt phosphate-based materials in water splitting using solar radiation is thoroughly explained. In the end, a diverse range of synthesis methods, challenges, and future prospects have been presented.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000648608900002

Subsequently, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of these electrodes were determined. A majority of the mixed Mn/Ru catalysts are highly active for the OER, exhibiting lower overpotential values compared to those of the state-of-the-art RuO2 and IrO2 type materials, when measured at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). These Mn/Ru oxide materials are also cheaper to produce than the aforementioned platinum group materials, therefore rendering the Mn/Ru materials more practical and economical. The Mn/Ru catalysts are also evaluated with respect to their Tafel slopes and turnover frequency numbers. Interestingly, scanning electron microscopy reveals that the morphologies of the electrodes change to a mud-cracked morphology, similar to that of the RuO2, with minimal amounts of the Ru precursor salt added to the Mn salt. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction show that the Mn material fabricated in this study at the two annealing temperatures is largely Mn3O4, while the Ru material is predominately RuO2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was also used to investigate the Mn and Ru composition ratios in each of the films.									114	0	0	0	1	0	114			2155-5435			WOS:000373524400031

Heat treatment of electrodeposited NiO films for improved catalytic water oxidation								RSC ADVANCES				5	105			86713	86722		10.1039/c5ra17041a				2015	2015	Recognizing the superior electrocatalytic properties of nickel oxide (NiO), we prepared cathodically electrodeposited nickel oxide (NiO) on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates as binder free electrocatalysts for water oxidation. The electrodeposited nickel oxide film (NiO(ED)) showed remarkable improvement for electrocatalytic water oxidation after heat treatment. In particular, the NiO(ED)-400 catalyst (electrodeposited nickel oxide film heat treated at 400 degrees C) achieved appreciable current density similar to 5 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the overpotential of 0.45 V vs. RHE. These catalyst films were characterized for structural, morphological, thermal and electrochemical properties, where the results reveal that the dehydration during heat treatment permanently removes the structural water with a concomitant amorphous -> crystalline transformation in NiO(ED) films, thereby making them more active catalysts for OER. In parallel investigations, nickel metal was electrodeposited on a stainless steel (SS) substrate, and was subsequently annealed in hot air to produce NiO(HA) films at different temperatures. The NiO(HA) films prepared by this method showed relatively high values of Tafel slopes and corresponding high overpotentials and low currents for OER, when compared to the NiO(ED) films. Hence, simple heat treatment of the cathodically electrodeposited nickel oxide (NiO(ED)) films showed remarkable improvements in their catalytic performances for oxygen evolution reaction, thereby making them efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation.									30	2	0	0	1	0	30			2046-2069			WOS:000363179500084

Transitional metal dichalcogenides have been regarded as effective substrates. However, the corresponding research in transition metal dichalcogenides is insufficient for oxygen reactions. In this work, a prototype investigation of dual transition-metal (TM) atoms doped MoTe2 (CoM/MoTe2, M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pd, Pt) is performed with density functional theory (DFT). The results indicate that proper dual doping configuration can effectively enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity of MoTe2 compared to single Co doping. Further research suggests that the regulated electronic property and moderated adsorption strength of reaction intermediates could help to accelerate the OER and ORR processes. This investigation provides an effective strategy for TMD-based catalysts designing by dual transition-metal atoms doping.									7	2	0	0	0	0	7			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000634523300030

The cerium species were introduced into the SiO2 shell by using different solvents to enhance the oxidation of NO, which is beneficial to the fast-SCR reaction. The meso-SiO2 shell inhibits the growth of CeO2 particles and enhances the dispersion of cerium oxide. The results of TEM, XPS and H-2-TPR found that the higher dispersity and smaller size of cerium species endow catalyst with a high ration of Ce4+/Ce3+ and outstanding SCR activity.

Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop alternative clean and renewable energies (such as solar, wind, and hydro energies) and related energy conversion technologies to overcome the above-mentioned problems. However, these energy sources suffer from intermittent availability because of regional or seasonal factors. Converting these energies into electrical energy and storing the excess electrical energy in the form of chemical bonds (like H-2) by electrochemical water splitting has been regarded as a promising strategy for the optimal use of these energies. Electrochemical water splitting is composed of two half-cell reactions, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode to produce hydrogen and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode to produce oxygen. However, both the HER and OER processes exhibit sluggish kinetics and thus need noble metal-based materials (Pt, IrO2, and RuO2) as electrocatalysts to improve the overall energy conversion efficiency. The scarcity and high cost of the noble metal limit their large-scale applications. Therefore, it is highly desirable and challenging to develop durable and efficient electrocatalysts for the HER/OER composed of earth-abundant elements.Transition metal sulfides with multi-valence states, low-cost and earth-abundance are promising electrocatalysts for the HER/OER in alkaline media. In the past years, substantial efforts have been devoted to developing a variety of transition metal sulfides to boost the HER/OER electrocatalytic activity from two aspects. One is from the aspect of material/ electrode structure (such as size, dimension and morphology), and most of the work was focused on the preparation of the material/electrode with a high specific surface area, open pore structure and high electrical conductivity to improve the number of active sites and their utilization, facilitate the charge/mass transfer. However, the prepared materials/electrodes usually exhibit great differences in specific surface area, pore structure and electrical conductivity, which is not an efficient strategy to peruse highly active electrocatalysts. The other one is from the aspect of intrinsic activity, which is closely related to the adsorption free energy of the reaction intermediate species (such as -H-ads and -OHads). The adsorption free energy of the reaction intermediates can be optimized by the tuning of the electronic structure of the active sites thus increasing the intrinsic activity of the HER/OER. Many strategies have been developed for tuning the electronic structure, such as valence regulation, heteroatom doping, defect construction and heterointerface construction.With a specific focus on transition metal sulfides for the alkaline electrolyzed water, this paper mainly reviews the recent progress of transition metal sulfides as electrocatalysts for the HER/OER in alkaline media. First, the HER/OER reaction mechanisms and performance evaluation parameters are briefly introduced. Second, the activity improvement strategies of the electrocatalysts are summarized extensively, including (1) increasing the number of active sites per unit area, promoting the exposure of active sites and facilitating the charge/mass transfer through the material/electrode structure design, and (2) increasing the intrinsic activity by tuning the electronic structure of the material. Finally, the future development direction of transition metal-based electrocatalysts for the HER/OER is proposed to provide a guideline for the rational design of high-performance electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0023-074X	2095-9419		WOS:000836798000003

These NPG metal catalysts are also stable under alkaline conditions and cost much less than Pt-group metals. However, in alkaline media, H-2 oxidation on Pt anodes is much more sluggish than in acidic media, and thus, more active H-2 oxidation catalysts are required to enable AEMFCs. Here we report on a family of H-2 oxidation catalysts: Ru alloys with Co, Ni, or Fe. A series of RuCo/C, RuNi/C, and RuFe/C alloy nanoparticle catalysts have been synthesized via an impregnation method and characterized by atomic-scale scanning transmission electron microscopy. We find that Ru alloys with small amounts of Co, Ni, or Fe can significantly enhance H-2 oxidation (HOR), H-2 evolution (HER), O-2 reduction (ORR), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions in alkaline media. They are much more active than pure Ru catalysts for the HOR, HER, ORR, and OER, and even more active than pure Pt catalysts for the HOR and HER, but they cost much less. In particular, Ru-0.95/Co-0.05/C is the most active among all studied Ru alloys catalysts for the HOR, HER, and ORR. Thus, they are promising catalysts for alkaline fuel cells and electrolyzers. The enhancement mechanism of Ru alloys has been elucidated by density functional theory calculations.									53	2	0	0	1	0	52			2155-5435			WOS:000543700400013

A unique, versatile, and scalable approach has been developed to fabricate manganese oxide films from single layers to multilayers with a controlled thickness and high reproducibility. The produced MnOx films are composed of small nanostructures that are assembled closely in the form of porous sponge-like layers. The films were investigated for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media and demonstrate a remarkable activity as well as a superior stability of over 60 h. To elucidate the catalytically active species, as well as the striking structural characteristics, the films were further examined in depth by using SEM, TEM, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, as well as quasi insitu extended X-ray absorption fine structure and X-ray absorption near edge structure analysis. The MnOx catalyst films excel because of a favorably high fraction of Mn3+ ions that are retained even after operation at oxidizing potentials. Upon exposure to oxidizing potentials in strongly alkaline aqueous electrolyte, the catalyst material maintains its structural integrity at the nanostructural, morphological, and atomic level.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000441237800011	29888534

The noble metal oxide, such as iridium dioxide (IrO2), is considered as a promising oxygen-evolving catalyst in proton exchange membrane based electrolysis cell, though it still needs to be improved due to the large over-potential. At the same time, composite materials containing lower amount of Ir without appreciable loss in electrocatalytic activity are also in high demand. By using the first-principles density functional theory calculations, we have studied the OER at IrO2 substituted with M (Ti, Cr, Mn, Ru, Rh, Pt, Sn, Pb) to search for the candidate catalysts with lower over-potential. Our calculation results show that the formation of Ir0.5Ti0.5O2 solid solution is thermodynamically the easiest and Pt cation is the most difficult to be substituted into IrO2 lattice. When OER occurs, the surfaces for pure and doped IrO2 are readily covered with O. The formation of adsorbed HOO at Ir0.5M0.5O2 catalysts is the potential-determining step which gives the theoretical over-potential close to that of pure IrO2. The free energy changes of this step increase in doped IrO2 systems with Ti, Mn, Rh, Pt or Sn, while they reduce at Ir0.5Cr0.5O2, Ir0.5Ru0.5O2 and Ir0.5Pb0.5O2 catalysts. In particular, compared to the pure IrO2, the binding strength of O is weakened more significantly than that of HOO at the Cr-, Ru- and Pb-doped IrO2, leading to the reduction of the free energy differences.

Here, we firstly report a simple KCl-assisted pyrolysis strategy to construct hybrid architectures with Co nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon nanotube hollow polyhedra (NCNHP) by using ZIF-67 as the precursor. The presence of KCl accelerates the decomposition of ZIF-67 and promotes the in situ formation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) during the pyrolysis at temperatures as low as 400 degrees C. The optimal NCNHP-1-500 with a CNT-assembled hierarchical architecture and abundant Co-N-x active sites exhibits excellent OER activity when benchmarked with commercial IrO2, achieving a needed overpotential of only 310 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). NCNHP-1-500 also displays satisfactory ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.828 V vs. RHE that is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (20 wt% Pt), and superior methanol tolerance and stability to Pt/C. The KCl-assisted pyrolysis strategy might bring new opportunities to fabricate novel hybrid architectures for highly efficient bifunctional OER and ORR electrocatalysts.									28	1	0	0	2	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000489686400024

Here, we demonstrate that the surface of two-dimensional Co-based MOF is modified by decorating Ag quantum dots (QDs) simply through in-situ reduction of Ag+ ions. Toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), it reveals that the catalysis is mediated by the reversible redox of Co sites between Co3+ and Co4+ states coupling with transfer of OH- ions. The decoration of Ag QDs decreases the redox potential of Co sites, and thus effectively decreases the overpotential of OER. The TOFs of Co sites are increased by 77 times to reach 5.4 s(-1) at an overpotential of 0.35 V. We attribute the activity enhancement to the tuning of the coupling process between Co sites and OH- ions during the redox of Co sites by Ag QDs decoration based on Pourbaix analysis.

Due to the increased chemical complexity, multimetallic catalysts provide flexibility to alter their electronic and crystal structure to attain a superior intrinsic catalytic activity via synergistic effects, which is seldom accomplished using single metal catalysts. However, the high chemical complexity increases the difficulty to prepare elemental homogenous catalysts and reveal their synergistic effect during OER process, which further hinder the design of multimetallic catalysts. Here, high entropy concept is utilized to design an NiFeCoMnAl oxide with amorphous structure as OER catalyst. The direct evidence of active Ni sites is provided by the operando Raman measurements and Fe can modify oxygen intermediates binding energy on Ni sites. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal that the incorporation of Mn can construct the electron-rich environment of active Ni center, and the relatively lower oxidation state of Ni facilitates the self-construction of beta-NiOOH intermediates, which shows promoted OER activity as confirmed by density functional theory calculations. Doping Co can enhance the conductivity and doping Al leads to the formation of nanoporous structure through dealloying process, thus each component is essential for improving OER performance. The optimized NiFeCoMnAl catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution, much superior to the ternary and quaternary counterparts. This work sheds light on understanding the origin of high entropy catalysts' OER activity and thereby enables the rational design of multinary transition metallic catalysts.									26	1	0	0	4	0	26			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000707950800001

Here we develop a highly flexible Ni3S2@Ni/CC electrode via a facile and scalable nickel electroplating and in-situ sulfuration route. When it acts as a supercapacitor electrode, the assembled all-solid-state hybrid supercapacitor delivers a high areal energy density of 0.27 mWh cm(-2) at an areal power density of 4.90 mW cm(-2). Because of its superior mechanical flexibility, the assembled supercapacitor exhibits 88.1% retention of its initial capacitance after 2000 bending cycles from 0 degrees to 90 degrees. Furthermore, the Ni3S2@Ni/CC electrode exhibits high activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), achieving a benchmark of 10 mA cm(-2) at a relatively low overpotential (eta(10)) of 290.9 mV with a Tafel slope of 101.26 mV dec(-1). Slight increments of 9.9 mV in eta(10) and 6.55 mV dec(-1) in Tafel slope are obtained even when the electrode is tested under a bending angle of 180 degrees. Meanwhile what it delivers an excellent long-term durability for 30 h that is similar to the electrode without bending for OER. The flexible Ni3S2@Ni/CC electrode can be incorporated into wearable electronics and portable water-splitting cells.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664785000003

Achieving sufficiently high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity while maintaining stability of the active catalyst surface is a primary challenge of designing OER catalysts. Often high electrocatalytic activity is accompanied by structural instability. This is the case for the metallic perovskite oxide SrRuO3 (SRO), which exhibits rapid dissolution under OER conditions, both as thin-films and as nanoparticles. On the other hand, large band-gap perovskite oxides such as SrTiO3 (STO) are inactive for OER in the dark but are stable. In this work, we demonstrate that burying as little as one unit cell of SRO beneath an ultrathin STO capping layer activates the otherwise inert electrocatalyst and gives excellent stability. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that such a chemical modification of STO by sub-surface SRO introduces new 4d electronic states including Ru states within the STO band gap, raising the energy level of the electrons, changing the electronic hybridization, and facilitating an easy transfer to the adsorbed intermediates. We validate this hypothesis experimentally using atomically precise heteroepitaxial deposition. We find that a single-unit-cell layer of SRO is sufficient to activate the topmost STO layer towards OER; burying SRO underneath two unit cells of STO protects the inherently unstable SRO against corrosion during OER. Generally, our layered heterostructures are model systems of oxide core-shell structures, where an unstable catalyst (core) is protected against degradation and electronically activates the otherwise inactive shell. As demonstrated in this work, the growth of ultrathin heterostructures establishes a rigorous platform for screening core/shell nanoparticle combinations/thicknesses, and elucidates sub-surface activation mechanism for achieving stable and active oxide electrocatalysts.									62	1	0	0	0	0	62			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000438392400011

Therefore, an effective strategy is proposed to replace the OER with selective methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). A nickel sulfide nanosheet catalyst supported on Ni foam (NiS/NF) was prepared by a facile hydrothermal method following with sulfurization treatment. The as-obtained catalyst could be used for the co-electrolysis of methanol/water to produce hydrogen and value-added formate simultaneously. The electrocatalyst can selectively oxidize methanol to formate (1.36 V vs.RHE) and the energy consumption is significantly lower than OER. Furthermore, the integrated two-electrode electrolyzer drives 10 mA cm-2 at a cell voltage of 1.5 V with 96% Faradaic efficiency for MOR.					3rd International Conference on Green Energy and Sustainable Development3rd International Conference on Green Energy and Sustainable Development	14-15 Nov. 202014-15 Nov. 2020		Shenyang, ChinaShenyang, China	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1755-1307			INSPEC:20349240

For the most investigated Ni-based electrode, the in situ reconstruction from Ni(OH)(2) to NiOOH is hardly avoidable during the electro-oxidation reaction, which is also a highly indispensable prerequisite towards HMFOR. Herein, we developed an efficient strategy of sacrificing W to investigate the effect of surface defects on the self-reconstruction of Ni for promoting HMFOR. It was rationalized that the selective and rapid exsolution of the W species from the as-prepared NiW layer created a porous structure and induced lattice defects on the surface, which facilitated the ion and electron transportation, and further promoted the in situ reconstruction for the formation of higher oxidated Ni with superior activity for HMFOR. This work offers a novel and low-cost means to enrich the active sites for the electrocatalytic upgrading of HMF and other bio-derived platforms.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000784955400001

The analysis revealed that a higher oxygen potential in the sintering atmosphere and a higher amount of M3O8 contributed to a lower sintered density but the formation of a larger average grain size in the microstructure of the sintered specimens. Moreover, it was revealed that the weight change during sintering with different amounts of M3O8 had an influence on the microstructural evolution and sintered density due to the difference in the oxygen potentials. This behavior is discussed in terms of the oxygen potential-density relationship, thermogravimetric behavior and microstructure evolution in the specimens. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Especially in acidic environments, compatible with the powerful proton exchange membrane (PEM), an earth-abundant OER catalyst that combines high activity and high stability is still unknown. Current PEM-compatible OER catalysts still rely mostly on Ir and/or Ru as active components, which are both very scarce elements of the platinum group. Hence, the Ir and/or Ru amount in OER catalysts has to be strictly minimized. Unfortunately, the OER mechanism, which is the most powerful tool for OER catalyst optimization, still remains unclear. In this review, we first summarize the current state of our understanding of the OER mechanism on PEM-compatible heterogeneous electrocatalysts, before we compare and contrast that to the OER mechanism on homogenous catalysts. Thereafter, an overview over monometallic OER catalysts is provided to obtain insights into structure-function relations followed by a review of current material optimization concepts and support materials. Moreover, missing links required to complete the mechanistic picture as well as the most promising material optimization concepts are pointed out.									588	26	0	0	26	1	596			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000393583600019

The materials were prepared by coprecipitation using various copper and cobalt precursors, and subsequent oxidation treatment. Electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) analyses were employed to characterize the Cu0.72Co2.28O4 catalysts. The Cu0.72Co2.28O4 catalyst, synthesized with acetate based precursors, exhibited higher activity for the oxygen evolution reaction than commercial precious IrO2 catalyst. This performance was attributed to its high surface area, sheet morphology and ratio of Co3+. The Cu(0.72)Co(2.28)O(4 )catalyst also showed excellent stability with a performance of 99% after 300 hours. The Cu0.72Co2.28O4 catalyst anode electrode was coupled with a Pt/C cathode electrode to construct an anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) cell.

However, it is difficult to fabricate most oxides as 2D materials unless they have a layered structure. Here, we present a facile strategy for the synthesis of ultrathin oxide nanosheets using a self-formed sacrificial template of carbon layers by taking advantage of the Maillard reaction and violent redox reaction between glucose and ammonium nitrate. To date, 36 large-area ultrathin oxides (with thickness ranging from similar to 1.5 to similar to 4 nm) have been fabricated using this method, including rare-earth oxides, transition metal oxides, Ill-main group oxides, II-main group oxides, complex perovskite oxides, and high-entropy oxides.

Here, atomic layers of metallic molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) with primarily exposed high-energy (010) facet are achieved via a facile carbothermic reduction approach. The resultant MoO2 exhibits single-crystalline, monoclinic, and ultrathin features with nearly 100% exposed (010) facet, which can significantly reduce reaction barriers toward the oxygen reduction reaction. As a consequence, the atomic layers of MoO2 exhibit high electrocatalytic activity, excellent tolerance to methanol, and good stability for the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline electrolyte, superior to commercial Pt/C catalysts. It is believed that such new transition metal oxide catalysts with exposed high-energy facets have broad applications in the areas of energy storage and conversions.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000428797800025	29405565

Herein, amorphous Fe- Ni-P-B-O (FNPBO) nanocages as efficient OER catalysts are synthesized by a simple low-cost and scalable method at room temperature. The samples are chemically stable, in clear contrast to reported unstable or even pyrophoric boride samples. The Fe/Ni ratio of the FNPBO nanocages can be continuously adjusted to optimize the OER catalytic performance. The FNPBO nanocages composed of multicomponent elements can weaken the metal-metal bonds, thus rearranging the electron density around the catalytic metal atom centers and reducing the energy barrier for intermediate formation. Hence the optimized FNPBO (Fe6.4Ni16.1P12.9B4.3O60.2) catalyst shows superior intrinsic electrocatalytic activity for OER. The low overpotential to afford the current density of 10 mA cm-2 (236 mV), the small Tafel slope (39 mV dec-1), and the high specific current density (26.44 mA cm-2) at a given overpotential of 300 mV make a sharp contrast to state-of-the-art RuO2 (327 mV, 136 mV dec-1, and 0.028 mA cm-2, respectively). copy 2019 American Chemical Society.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1936-0851			INSPEC:19524300

Therefore, tailoring the shape and composition within the nanoscale is the key to designing a robust electrocatalyst in electrochemical energy conversion. Here, Cu-rich PtCu octahedral alloys achieved by a composition-driven shape evolution route have been used as outstanding bifunctional electrocatalysts for both methanol oxidation (MOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an acid medium. When benchmarked against commercial Pt black or Pt/C, for MOR, the specific activity/mass activity on Pt34.5Cu65.5 octahedra is 4.74/7.53 times higher than that on commercial Pt black; for ORR, the specific activity/mass activity on Pt34.5Cu65.5 octahedra is 7.7/4.2 times higher than that on commercial Pt/C. After a current-time test for 3600 s, the remaining mass activity on Pt34.5Cu65.5 octahedra is 35.5 times higher than that on commercial Pt black for MOR.

Therefore, significant progress has been made in developing catalysts with transition metal and carbon materials as alternative catalysts. Here, we prepared cobalt containing carbon nanofibers via a facile route of electrospinning and pyrolysis, and metal leached carbon nanofibers were also prepared by subsequently leaching the metal. Despite metal leaching, the latter ones still show comparable activity and stability with iridium black in alkaline water electrolysis. After detailed physicochemical and electrochemical characterizations, we revealed that graphitic edge plane rich carbon is mainly responsible for the activity of our material rather than embedded metal species. In addition, the metal plays a role in forming the specific carbon structure along with improving graphitization based on the catalytic graphitization. This result indicates the importance of the graphitic edge plane and might be helpful to understand carbon anodes for alkaline water electrolysis.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000408257700009	28808708

The formation of hollow CoO nanoparticles is generally attributed to the nanoscale Kirkendall effect.

This multi-step water electrolysis system can achieve a high energy conversion efficiency during hydrogen production by reducing the ohmic overpotential between the electrodes through use of a thinner separator than that used in conventional systems. In the present study, manganese dioxide (MnO2) was selected as the intermediate electrode because its oxidation-reduction potential is located between the potentials of the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. In addition, the electrolysis cell contained using metal hydride and nickel hydroxide as negative and positive electrodes, respectively, to split the gas evolution reactions at the solid/liquid/gas three-phase boundary into reactions at the solid/gas and solid/liquid two-phase boundaries. The electrochemical performance of the fabricated electrolyzer cell was tested at 25, 40, and 60 degrees C and the results show that oxygen and hydrogen can be easily separated by producing them in different steps. Furthermore, a low average voltage for water electrolysis, below 1.6 V, was obtained at 60 degrees C. Thus, the proposed water electrolysis system has potential as an electrochemical reactor for highly efficient, high-purity hydrogen production.

Herein, oxygen defect hollow Co3O4/nitrogen-doped carbon (O-V-HCo3O4@NC) composites were successfully synthesized using tannic acid-modified ZIF-67 (TAMZIF-67) as the precursor through a one-step pyrolysis. Tannic acid provides abundant oxygen during the pyrolysis process of the modified ZIF-67, which can contribute to the formation of oxygen defects and the construction of a hollow structure. The existence of oxygen defects is shown by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance, whereas the hollow structure is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. The optimized O-V-HCo3O4@NC shows good electrocatalytic activity and exhibits a low overpotential of 360 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH due to the hollow structure, abundant oxygen defects, and good electrical conductivity. This work provides valuable insights into the exploration of promising OER electrocatalysts with oxygen defects and special structures.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7				2046-2069		WOS:000582937000020	35518438

Arrhenius' law suggests that the higher temperature, the faster the reaction rate, so that a larger OER current density can be achieved at a lower eta. Herein, we report an abnormal temperature effect on the performance of Co-based catalysts, e.g., Co3O4, Li2CoSiO4, and Fe-doped Co(OH)(x), in OER in alkaline electrolytes. The OER performance reached a maximum when the temperature increased to 65 degrees C, and the OER performance declined when the temperature became higher. The mechanism was investigated by using Co3O4 as a model sample, and we propose that at an optimal temperature (around 55-65 degrees C) the main rate-determining step changes from OH- adsorption dominant to a mixed mode and both the adsorption and the cleavage of the OH group can be rate-determining, which leads to the fastest kinetics.									34	2	0	0	1	0	35			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000427094000050	29470062

In response, a urea-assisted energy-saving alkaline hydrogen-production system has been investigated by replacing OER with a more oxidizable urea oxidation reaction (UOR). A bimetal heterostructure CoMn/CoMn2O4 as a bifunctional catalyst is constructed in an alkaline system for both urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Based on the Schottky heterojunction structure, CoMn/CoMn2O4 induces self-driven charge transfer at the interface, which facilitates the absorption of reactant molecules and the fracture of chemical bonds, therefore triggering the decomposition of water and urea. As a result, the heterostructured electrode exhibits ultralow potentials of -0.069 and 1.32 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and UOR, respectively, in alkaline solution, and the full urea electrolysis driven by CoMn/CoMn2O4 delivers 10 mA cm(-2) at a relatively low potential of 1.51 V and performs stably for more than 15 h. This represents a novel strategy of Mott-Schottky hybrids in electrocatalysts and should inspire the development of sustainable energy conversion by combining hydrogen production and sewage treatment.									125	3	0	0	12	0	125			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000516610600001

Herein, a Co-Ni-Fe spinet oxide-carbonitrides hybrids (CoNiFeOx-NC) electrocatalyst with hierarchical structure was synthesized from Fe-MIL-101-NH2 through a unique ion-exchange based strategy. The ion exchange of Fe-MIL-101-NH2 with both Ni and Co ions induced a hierarchically structured 2-D ternary metal MOF shell layer encapsulated 3-D octahedral MOF crystals as a core. This prevents the collapse of MOF frameworks during the air calcination process and affords highly porous structure and large surface area. Additionally, the unique combination of Co-Ni-Fe in spinet oxides derived from calcination of the hierarchically structured core-shell MOF provides a favorable electronic environment for the adsorption of OER intermediates, which was further verified by the XPS characterizations and DFT calculations. DFT study revealed the Ni-Co coordinated O-h sites in the MFe2O4 reverse spinet structures as the main active sites, which tuned the binding strength of oxygen species with a catalyst through electron transfer of Fe -> Co -> Ni, thereby lowered the energy barriers for OER. As a result, the rationally designed CoNiFeOx-NC catalyst manifests superior OER performance with a low overpotential of 265 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and a decent Tafel slope of 64.1 mV dec(-1). The ion-exchange based strategy may serve as a versatile platform for rational design and synthesis of multi-metallic MOF derived electrocatalysts.									75	0	0	0	7	0	75			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000627553300001

A variety of molecular water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) have been reported over the last two decades. In view of their applications in artificial photosynthesis devices, it is essential to immobilize molecular catalysts onto the surfaces of conducting/semiconducting supports for fabricating efficient and stable water oxidation anodes/photoanodes. Molecular WOC-based anodes are essential for developing photovoltaic artificial photosynthesis devices and, moreover, the performance of molecular WOC on anodes will provide important insight into designing extended molecular WOC-based photoanodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation.

It takes scientists a great deal of effort to design and synthesize electrocatalytic materials with high catalytic properties, low fabrication cost and simple synthesis method. In this paper we report the synthesis of the octahedral Co3O4 particles by a simple hydrothermal method, with the double-layer capacitance (C-dl) 154.85 mF cm(-2), and a lot of {111} high-index facets exposed. The Co3O4 of this structure not only contains oxygen vacancies and hydroxyl groups on the surface, but has a high electrochemical surface area. The synergistic effect of these features makes it a high efficiency catalyst for HER and OER. The bright performance is manifested in that the HER in an alkaline medium requires only 77.9 mV overpotential for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the OER needs 301.2 mV overpotential for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), while during the electrolytic overall water splitting, it just needs 1.60 V for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The durability test also shows good performance of the material both for the HER and OER processes with the tolerating time of Chronoamperometry (j-t) curve test for 20 h. This work not only proves the efficient catalytic performance of this material, but also has the guiding significance for the large volume synthesis of electric catalysts used in industry.

NiS-FeS hybrid was uniformly integrated with N, S co-doped carbon in NixFey-S/NSC. NixFey-S/NSC showed high OER catalytic activity, and the optimized Ni60Fe40-S/NSC afforded an OER overpotential of similar to 239 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and showed a corresponding Tafel slope of similar to 30.9 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. Such OER catalytic activity was not only higher than that of IrO2, but also comparable with that of the most recently reported NiFe-based sulfides for OER. Further study indicated that hybridizing NiS with FeS resulted in a synergistic effect for OER. The hybridization increased total amount of sulfides as active species, therefore enhancing the OER catalytic activity. In addition, the hybridization benefited the formation of petal-like morphologies that contributing much to higher electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), and also boosted the content of graphitic and N, S co-doped carbon that improving charge transfer efficiency.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000525840100001

The strong solid-solid interfacial interactions between gamma-MnOOH rods and CoOOH particles feature the Mn-O-Co bond on the interface and a high valence state of cobalt in CoOOH. The branched gamma-MnOOH/CoOOH composites demonstrate a significantly strengthened synergy effect for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The optimal B-MCO-0.1 (gamma-MnOOH/CoOOH-0.1) shows an excellent OER performance, which requires an overpotential of 313 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a lower Tafel slope (87 mV dec(-1)) and the strong durability in alkaline electrolyte. Specially, the intrinsic OER activity (versus electrochemical active surface area, ECSA) on B-MCO-0.1 at an overpotential of 420 mV is 16.3 and 8.9 times higher than those of gamma-MnOOH and CoOOH, respectively.

Thus, the development of highly efficient and durably stable non-noble-metal OER electrocatalyst is necessary and challenging for the large-scale electrocatalytic water splitting. Herein, a series of iron-substituted cobalt-nickel phosphides grown on Ni foam (FeCoNi-P/NFs) were easily prepared though successive hydrothermal and phosphorization treatments. The chemical compositions, crystalline and electronic structures as well as surface morphologies of these resulting electrocatalysts are strongly related with the iron substitution ratio. More interestingly, the FeCoNi-P/NF-2 nanosheet arrays prepared from equivalent molar ratio of iron and cobalt precursors exhibit the best OER performance with a low overpotential of 266 mV to produce a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 61.2 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH condition, which is comparable to the reported state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts. Additionally, the FeCoNi-P/NF-2 nanosheet arrays also show satisfactory long-term durability over 60 h. The superior OER activity of the electrocatalyst is essentially attributed to the heteroatomic substitution and the unique three-dimensional hierarchical morphology, which greatly increase the electrical conductivity, afford more active sites and facilitate the efficient charge transfer ability.

Herein, Co-phthalocyanine-based COPs (CoPc-COPs) are constructed using cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine (CoPc(NH2)(4)) as the organic building unit and phosphonitrilic chloride trimer (Cl6N3P3) as the linker group, which serve as the self-carrier enriched with Co, P, N, and C to derive Co2P nanoparticles anchored on the N, P codoped graphene after carbonization treatment. Benefiting from the unique construction and the metallic property confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the Co2P/NPG displays high-efficient trifunctional electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), including excellent oxygen electrocatalytic activity (overpotential of 0.32 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, half-wave potential of 0.81 V for ORR) and outstanding stability (98% over 12 h for OER, 89% over 17 h for ORR). Impressively, rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs) that employed Co2P/NPG as the cathode electro-catalyst display a peak power of up to 103.5 mW cm(-2) along with a good cycle stability after 55 h. Moreover, the constructed ZABs can be used to power the overall water splitting. Therefore, function-oriented design of metallophthalocyanine-based COPs provides new ways to strategically construct multifunctional electrocatalysts for the wider integrated green energy system.									36	2	0	0	0	0	36			2168-0485			WOS:000529151600027

However, the whole design of precursor and product is studied a few for efficient photocatalytic and electrocatalytic water oxidation. Here, we report the large-scale synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) nanohybrids (NHs) of 50-nm nickel perylene diimide (Ni-PDI) nanowires loading iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)(3)) nanoparticles through one-step hydrothermal reaction. The Fe(OH)(3)@Ni-PDI NHs as OER photocatalyst possess the super activity, even high electrocatalytic performance after pyrolysis. Under visible light (lambda > 420 nm), the photocatalytic oxygen evolution rate of 22,000 mu mol g(-1) h(-)(1) can be achieved via the synergy between 1D Ni-PDI nanowires and in-situ generated iron (oxy)hydroxide as cocatalyst. Through pyrolysis of 1D Fe(OH)(3)@Ni-PDI NHs, the NiFe nanoparticles covered by NiFe2O4 layer can be synthesized on 30-nm nitrogen-doped carbon nanowires (NiFe/NiFe2O4@NC). After optimizing the mole ratio of nickel to iron atoms (2:1) and pyrolysis temperature (800 degrees C), as-obtained sample exhibits the OER activity with the overpotential of 256 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH. The work provides a universal strategy to design 1D nanostructure for efficient OER catalysis.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000619128500005

Herein, it is reported that the subnanometric CoOx clusters with high oxidation state substitutionally dispersed in the lattice of rutile TiO2 support (Co-TiO2) can be prepared by a thermally induced phase segregation process. Owing to the strong interaction of CoOx clusters and TiO2 support, Co-TiO2 exhibits both excellent intrinsic activity and durability for OER. The turnover frequency of Co-TiO2 is up to 3.250 s(-1) at overpotentials of 350 mV; this value is one of the highest in terms of OER performance among the current Co-based active materials under similar testing conditions; moreover, the OER current density loss is only 6.5% at a constant overpotential of 400 mV for 30 000 s, which is superior to the benchmark Co3O4 and RuO2 catalysts. Mechanism analysis demonstrates that charge transfer occurs between Co sites and their neighboring Ti atoms, triggering the efficient Co-Ti cooperative catalytic centers, in which OH* and O* are preferred to be adsorbed on the bridging sites of Co and Ti with favorable adsorption energy, inducing a lower energy barrier for O-2 generation.									42	2	0	0	7	0	42			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000599739000001

Besides demonstrating the often astonishing catalytic capabilities of the materials, it is possible to discuss the oxygen exchange reaction mechanism based on experiments on clean surfaces unaltered by external degradation processes. All investigated materials with at least moderate ionic conductivity (i.e. all except LSM) exhibit polarization resistances with very similar p(O-2)- and T-dependences, mostly differing only in absolute value. In combination with non-equilibrium measurements under polarization and defect chemical model calculations, these results elucidate several aspects of the oxygen exchange reaction mechanism and refine the understanding of the role oxygen vacancies and electronic charge carriers play in the oxygen exchange reaction. It was found that a major part of the effective activation energy of the surface exchange reaction, which is observed during equilibrium measurements, originates from thermally activated charge carrier concentrations. Electrode polarization was therefore used to control defect concentrations and to extract concentration amended activation energies, which prove to be drastically different for oxygen incorporation and evolution (0.26 vs. 2.05 eV for LSF).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000721863700001	35223039

The activity of corresponding catalytic coatings strongly depends on material properties such as film thickness, crystallinity, electrical conductivity, and chemical surface speciation. Measuring these properties with high accuracy in vacuum-free and non-destructive methods facilitates the elucidation of structure-activity relationships in realistic environments. Here, we report a novel approach to analyze the optical and electrical properties of highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts via spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). Using a series of differently calcined, mesoporous, templated iridium oxide films as an example, we assess the film thickness, porosity, electrical resistivity, electron concentration, electron mobility, and interband and intraband transition energies by modeling of the optical spectra. Independently performed analyses using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, ellipsometric porosimetry, X-ray reflectometry, and absorption spectroscopy indicate a high accuracy of the deduced material properties. A comparison of the derived analytical data from SE, resonant photoemission spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with activity measurements of the OER suggests that the intrinsic activity of iridium oxides scales with a shift of the Ir 5d t(2g) sub-level and an increase of p-d interband transition energies caused by a transition of mu(1)-OH to p mu(3)-O species.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200039

Herein, by employing first principles calculations, the catalytic performance of various transition metal (TM) atoms supported on single-layer ternary Ga2FeS4 for water splitting has been systematically investigated. Strikingly, it was evidenced that the sandwich Ga2FeS4 can form a tunable interfacial polarization field under external strain, which can effectively regulate its catalytic performance. Specifically, Au-Ga2FeS4 under a 0.5% tensile strain presents good bifunctional catalytic performance, with the low overpotentials of 0.03 and 0.48 eV, respectively, for the HER and OER, outperforming the experimentally identified Pt and IrO2. Considering the massive possibilities of these ternary substrates and the easily accessible characteristic of external strain, the findings highlighted here can provide a useful theoretical guideline for designing efficient bifunctional SACs in overall water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000687281200001

Although the direct growth of active components on the substrate is an effective strategy to enhance the catalytic activity, the weak adhesion between active material and substrate tremendously hampers their long-term utilization with excellent performance. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) hollow structure of NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) on NiFe foam (NiFe LDH@NiFe) is designed via acid-corrosion-induced strategy. The self-supported electrode was obtained through a process based on an autologous NiFe foam, in which the electrode/gas/electrolyte interface and electrocatalyst/substrate interface are delicately engineered. Remarkably, the NiFe LDH@NiFe only needs an ultralow overpotential of 201 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER in 1 M KOH electrolyte, along with superb stability. The high catalytic activity is attributed to the intimate connection between the nanosheet arrays and substrate, superior intrinsic activity, and fast electron transfer. More importantly, the excellent hydrophilicity and aerophobicity of NiFe LDH@NiFe enables significantly improved infiltration of electrolytes, quick release of oxygen bubbles, and remarkably enhanced charge transfer. Thus, the obtained NiFe LDH@NiFe holds promise for electrocatalytic applications. Finally, the growth mechanism of NiFe LDH@NiFe is investigated and discussed in detail.									4	1	0	0	1	0	5			2574-0962			WOS:000703338600036

Therefore, it is of much significance to rationally design TMP electrocatalysts for achieving high-efficiency OER. Here, we design Mn-doped cobalt phosphide (Mn-CoP) porous nanosheets for highly active OER through the in-situ metal acetate hydroxide transformation and subsequent phosphidation treatment. Benefiting from synergistic effects of the porous structure, high density of active sites and improved charge-transfer capability, the optimized Mn-CoP serving as a pre-catalyst shows an impressive alkaline OER performance with a low overpotential of 288 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and high stability. Post-electrolysis characterizations show the conversion from Mn-CoP to vertical Mn-CoOOH hexagonal nanosheets during OER, in which the transformed Mn-CoOOH not only provide extra active sites, but serve as the highly active species. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mn doping can increase the gap states near the Fermi level of active O sites, endowing facilitated deprotonation of OH* to O* and reducing the energy barrier of rate-determining step. This protocol provides a novel insight for the construction of highly efficient TMP water oxidation electrocatalysts.									24	1	0	0	2	0	24			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707126000261

Herein, a rapid surface-guided synthetic approach is proposed to introduce amorphous and mixed-metal oxyhydroxide overlayers on ultrathin Ni-doped MnO2 (Ni-MnO2) nanosheet arrays via a galvanic replacement mechanism. This method results in a monolithic 3D porous catalyst with a small overpotential of only 232 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH, which is much lower than the corresponding value of 307 mV for the Ni-MnO2 reference sample. Detailed structural and electrochemical characterization reveal that the unique Ni-MnO2 ultrathin nanosheet arrays do not only provide a large surface area to guide the formation of active amorphous catalyst layers but also ensure the effective charge transport owing to their high electron conductivity, collectively contributing to the greatly improved catalyst activity. It is envisioned that this highly operable surface-guide synthetic strategy may open up new avenues for the design and fabrication of novel 3D nanoarchitectures integrated with functional amorphous materials for broadened ranges of applications.									59	4	0	0	3	0	60			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000538506800001

The discovery of potentially efficient catalysts for OER is a key factor to facilitate the overall kinetics of water splitting, in which, noble metals such as Ru and Ir are still the conventional benchmarks. However, besides the high cost, such catalysts are also suffered from rapid performance degradation under OER conditions, particularly for Ru. In this work, Ru@IrOx core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) are successfully obtained through a wet chemical synthesis with the assistance of electro-oxidation. The NPs possess an ultra-small size of about 3.4 nm, achieving high specific OER activities of 51.99 mu A/cm(oxide)(2) and 3.44 mu A/cm(oxide)(2) as well as mass activities of 44.85 A/g(oxide )and 3.03 A/g(oxide) at overpotential of 250 mV (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M HClO4 and in 0.1 M KOH respectively.

J	Hong, Jeong Hoo; Park, Gi Dae; Kang, Yun Chan								Aerosol-assisted synthesis of bimetallic nanoparticle-loaded bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotubes as an efficient bifunctional oxygen catalyst for Zn-air batteries								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH				46	4			5215	5225		10.1002/er.7513		NOV 2021		MAR 25 2022	2022	Considering fabrication of highly efficient and low-cost bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts, which can substitute noble metal-based catalysts, is imperative for advanced rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Among the various candidates, N-doped carbon and transition metal composite catalyst is considered as promising bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. In this study, one-dimensional structured bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotubes (bNCNTs) were synthesized by spray pyrolysis followed by a post-treatment. CoFe nanoalloys embedded within SiO2 microspheres were employed as a nanocatalyst to grow homogeneous bNCNTs, which have known as excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. To compensate for the low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of bNCNTs, NiFe nanoparticles were loaded on bNCNTs (NiFe/bNCNT) by a "drop and dry" process and post-treatment. Synergistic effect arising from bNCNTs showing high surface area and controlled infiltration method, NiFe nanoparticles exhibited high dispersity on bNCNTs. Owing to the synergistic effect of NiFe metal nanoparticles and bNCNTs, NiFe/bNCNT exhibited superior ORR properties with a high limiting current density (5.1 mA cm(-2)) and a low Tafel slope (94 mV dec(-1)), as well as outstanding OER activity with a low overpotential (350 mV) in an alkaline media compared to those of single metal-loaded bNCNTs and Pt/C-RuO2. Furthermore, when applied as ZAB cathode catalyst, NiFe/bNCNT demonstrated a high power density (224 mW cm(-2)) and 330 hours long cycling stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000722746000001

The optimized NiCo(2.148)O(4)PNSs with an average Co valence state of 2.3 and uniform 4 nm nanopores present excellent catalytic performance with an ultralow overpotential of 190 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)and long-term stability (700 h) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Furthermore, Zn-air batteries built using the NiCo(2.148)O(4)PNSs present a high power and energy density of 83 mW cm(-2)and 910 Wh kg(-1), respectively. Moreover, a portable battery box with NiCo(2.148)O(4)PNSs as the air cathode presents long-term stability for 120 h under low temperatures in the range of 0 to -35 degrees C. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the prominent electron exchange and transfer activity of the electrocatalyst is attributed to the surface lower-coordinated Co-sites in the porous region presenting a merging 3d-e(g)-t(2g)band, which overlaps with the Fermi level of the Zn-air battery system. This favors the adsorption of the *OH, and stabilized *O radicals are reached, toward competitively lower overpotential, demonstrating a generalized key for optimally boosting overall OER performance.									53	4	0	0	2	0	54			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000562460900001	32844534

However, it is of huge challenge to expose more active sites due to the typical amorphous feature. Besides, proper defect engineering is promising to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts. Herein, we have successfully prepared disordered CoFePi nanosheets with rich vacancies from layered double hydroxide by a solution plasma method. The plasma can etch the interlayer anions to realize the physical exfoliation of layered double hydroxides. Meanwhile, the as-physically-exfoliated layered double hydroxides nanosheets are in-situ chemically-conversed to disordered CoFePi nanosheets by the NaH2PO4. The X-ray adsorption spectra results suggest the abundance of vacancies in the products. Cobalt tends to adjust the local structural rearrangement and to sustain the structure in the presence of a great deal of oxygen and metal vacancies. Under this adjustment, the crystal field is expected to be influenced in CoFePi. The oxygen and metal vacancies may be extensively present in MO6 octahedra layers, giving rise to a relative structure disorder and more unbonded speciec within the layers which provides more active sites in CoFePi. As a result, the disordered CoFePi nanosheets with rich vacancies could catalyse OER effectively.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000474327300024

Geometric configuration and electronic structure engineering have been demonstrated to play a paramount role in improving the electrocatalytic OER. However, there are few reports targeting thiospinel-based electrocatalysts that simultaneously employ these two strategies. Herein, we have designed a well-controlled hollow heterostructure of Ni3S2/NiCo2S4 with rich heterointerfaces through a facile hydrothermal method. Benefitting from the hollow nanotube structure, the Ni3S2/NiCo2S4 catalyst can expose more catalytically active sites accessible to reactants and intermediates as well as provide more routes for facilitating electron transfer. Moreover, the unique heterostructure greatly modifies the electronic structure and generates lattice strain at the heterojunction interface to optimize the binding strength with intermediate species. As a result, Ni3S2/NiCo2S4 exhibited markedly high OER activity, achieving a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of 177 mV and maintaining high stability during a 200 h test.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2052-1553			WOS:000782938000001

One of the key requirements for achieving high-performance reversible SOCs is the development of highly active bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we investigate a La0.2Sr0.8Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (LSCF2882) material as a novel oxygen electrode for reversible SOCs at intermediate temperatures. Unlike most widely used La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF6428) with a rhombohedrally distorted perovskite structure, LSCF2882 possesses a simple cubic perovskite structure with a symmetric BO6 octahedral network. Furthermore, the 3D bond valence sum calculation of the LSCF2882 structure suggests a reduction in oxygen ion conduction barrier energy. Oxygen surface exchange (k(chem)) and diffusion (D-chem) coefficients of LSCF2882 determined by electrical conductivity relaxation are consistently remarkably higher by >2 and 20 times compared to those of LSCF6428 at 700 degrees C, respectively. This result is further supported by a 43% reduction in the oxygen vacancy formation energy of LSCF2882 determined from density functional theory calculations. The reversible SOCs with LSCF2882 oxygen electrodes greatly outperform LSCF6428 cells in both fuel cell (2.55 W cm(-2)) and electrolysis mode (2.09 A cm(-2) at 1.3 V) at 800 degrees C, with excellent reversible cycling stability. Our findings strongly suggest that LSCF2882 is a promising candidate as a bifunctional oxygen electrode for high performance reversible SOCs at reduced temperatures.									8	1	0	0	1	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000627067700017

A Co complex of 5,15-bis(pentafluorophenyl)-10-(4)-(1-pyrenyl)phenylcorrole (1) bearing a pyrene substituent was synthesized. When it was immobilized on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), the 1/MWCNT composite displayed very high electrocatalytic activity and durability for both OER and ORR in aqueous solutions: it catalyzed a direct four-electron reduction of O-2 to H2O in 0.5 M H2SO4 with an onset potential of 0.75 V vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), and it catalyzed the oxidation of water to O-2 in neutral aqueous solution with an onset potential of 1.15 V (vs NHE, eta = 330 mV). Control studies using a Co complex of 5,10,15-tris(pentafluorophenyl)corrole (2) demonstrated that the enhanced catalytic performance of 1 was due to the strong noncovalent pi-pi interactions between its pyrene moiety and MWCNTs, which were considered to facilitate the fast electron transfer from the electrode to 1 and also to increase the adhesion of 1 on carbon supports. The noncovalent immobilization of molecular complexes on carbon supports through strong pi-pi interactions appears to be a simple and straightforward strategy to prepare highly efficient electrocatalytic materials.									130	7	0	0	8	0	131			2155-5435			WOS:000385057900016

The solution coordination chemistry of metalammonia complexes was utilized to synthesize well-defined NiCo LDH nanoplates directly in a single step without topochemical oxidation. The as-grown NiCo LDH nanoplates exhibit a high catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By chemically exfoliating LDH nanoplates to thinner nanosheets, the catalytic activity can be further enhanced to yield an electrocatalytic current density of 10 mA cm(2) at an overpotential of 367 mV and a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(1). Such enhancement could be due to the increased surface area and more exposed active sites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggests the exfoliation also caused some changes in electronic structure. This work presents general strategies to controllably grow nanostructures of LDH and ternary oxide/hydroxides in general and to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of layered nanostructures by exfoliation.									763	42	0	0	30	0	775			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000349578000095	25633476

Characterization by XPS of surface oxides on carbon has been accomplished with the aim of providing a better atomistic insight into: (a) reactions involved in molecular oxygen adsorption on coals and (b) the relations between the nanostructure of solid carbons and the chemistry of oxidation. High-resolution C 1s and O 1s core level and valence band XPS spectra effectively reflected the oxidative functionalization of different types of coals and synthetic carbons upon oxidation in air at moderate temperatures (300 and 500 degrees C). More specifically, analysis of C 1s and valence band spectra could be directed to monitor the structural evolution of the carbons in terms of extension of sp(2) versus sp(3) conjugation, carbon vacancies and oxidized carbon. Comparison of the 0 1s spectra, on the other hand, provided a tool to characterize the nature of oxygen bonding on carbon and to determine the relative abundance of carbon-oxygen species. Results underline the important role of epoxy groups in the early stages of oxidation, providing a mechanistic framework for the identification of the stable and metastable intermediates in the heterogeneous oxidation of coal by molecular oxygen.

Herein, we report a simple and facile surface engineering strategy for nickel and cobalt based (NiO-Co3O4) hybrid as efficient and robust ORR electrocatalyst. The surface nanostructure of NiO-Co3O4 nanohybrids can be easily tuned by controlling the precursor amounts of nickel and cobalt during a wet-chemical synthesis. With an optimal composition, an intriguing surface structure consisted of one dimensional (1D) nanorod with two dimensional (2D) nanosheet can be obtained for NiO-Co3O4 nanohybrids, which significantly boosts ORR electrocatalytic activity as well as stability. A facile charge or mass transfer within 1D and 2D open surface nanostructures is mainly responsible for an excellent catalytic performance of NiO-Co3O4 nanohybrids.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000575656600008

We assume that the reaction is entertained by the air oxygen which continuously diffuses into the mixture pores.The solid-phase diffusion of oxygen through a zircon layer seems to constitute the limiting step of the reaction. To verify this assumption, a model allowing for diffusion in a protective oxide is developed. The results obtained with this model correspond to the tests for an apparent energy diffusion value varying between 130 kJ/mol and 170 kJ/mol. A value of 130 kJ/mol corresponds to the migration energy of the anionic gaps in a porous zircon layer. The evolution of the apparent diffusion energy can be attributed to the formation energy of crystalline defects (in particular anionic gaps).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0721-3115			WOS:A1994QD84400002

Herein, a hierarchical FeCo2S4@CoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) core-shell structure catalyst was successfully fabricated via a hydrothermal-sulfuration-electrodeposition three-step method. The unique structure can provide more abundant catalytically active sites for the electrochemical reaction. The resulting FeCo2S4@CoFe LDH electrode only requires overpotentials of 115 and 247 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER in 1 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. The electrode also exhibits a low Tafel slope and excellent stability. Furthermore, the bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting can exhibit a cell voltage of 1.6 V at 10 mA cm(-2), along with outstanding durability for 24 h testing. This work provides a new strategy to design effective bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting.									26	3	0	0	0	0	26			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000536775400005

A sufficiently high angular speed of the electrode is necessary to obtain layers of homogeneous thickness and Co3O4 concentration. The volume fraction of Co3O4 particles in the deposit cu reaches a limiting value of ca. 0.1 when the volume fraction of particles in suspension C exceeds 0.008. The current density j has little effect on alpha as long as it is in the range 1 to 20 mA cm(-2); if j increases further, alpha decreases.PbO2 + Co3O4 composite layers have been studied as electrode materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (mainly in NaOH solution). The overpotential and Tafel slope decrease upon increasing alpha. At a fixed potential, j is roughly proportional to OH- concentration. The PbO2 + Co3O4 electrode performance is fairly stable at 25 degrees C but declines with time at higher temperature.

We showed previously that, in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, some protein factors located on the thylakoid membranes are involved in the stabilization of this reaction against heat-induced inactivation, and we identified cytochrome c(550) as one such factor (Y. Nishiyama, H. Hayashi, T. Watanabe, N. Murata [1994] Plant Physiol 105: 1313-1319). In the present study we purified another protein that appears to be essential for the stabilization of the oxygen-evolving machinery. The purified protein had an apparent molecular mass of 13 kD, and the gene encoding the 13-kD protein was cloned from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the protein was homologous to PsbU, an extrinsic protein of the photosystem II complex, which has been found in thermophilic species of cyanobacteria. Western analysis showed that the level of PsbU in thylakoid membranes was constant, regardless of the growth temperature. Our studies indicate that PsbU, a constituent of the photosystem II complex, protects the oxygen-evolving machinery against heat-induced inactivation.									49	2	0	0	44	0	52			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000071040500019	9414557

Among those, the rate limiting depends on electrons transfer for chemisorptions of molecules in redox reactions. This feature can be directly linked with efficient catalyst support material in electrocatalysis. To this end, we have developed a novel, simple and facile route to introduce commercially available material with tuned surface and interface chemistry for their potential applications in fuel cells (FCs) science and technology. Commercial tungsten carbide (WC) was activated by means of electrochemical oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) on different rotation rates to induce mild interactions of oxygen molecules with surface of WC at specified reduction potentials. The X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis before and after the activation confirmed the tuning of WC surface with incorporation of potential factors to activate them for enhanced electrocatalytic activities. In addition, the electrocatalytic methanol oxidation reactions (MOR) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) were carried and confirmed the exceptional boosted-up electrocatalytic behaviour of WC after the activation. The enhancement in electrocatalytic mechanism after activation was also tested and proved by means of in-situ FTIR spectroelectrochemical analysis for methanol electro-oxidation. In addition, the electrochemical depositions of N nanoparticles were carried out on WC surface before and after the activation to reveal the influence of surface activation for accommodating the foreign particles as support material in electrocatalysis.

In this work, carbon nanofibers synthesized by electrospinning are modified with a combination of cobalt oxide and metallic cobalt (CoO-Co/CNF) and studied as a bifunctional air electrode for metal-air batteries. The performance of CoO-Co/DIF for both reactions is compared with state-of-the-art catalysts such as Pt/C and IrO2. The combination of cobalt oxide and metallic cobalt, finely distributed on the surface of graphitic carbon nanofibers, leads to a bifunctional catalyst with a half-wave potential for the ORR slightly better than Pt/C and a reversibility (Delta EoER-oRR) of 809 mV. The stability of CoO-Co/CNF is assessed by means of different stress tests: polarizations at high electrochemical potentials (2 V vs. RHE), rapid charge-discharge cycles at +/- 80 mA cm(-2) and long durability tests by charging for 12 h at 60 mA cm(-2) and discharging for 8 h at -80 mA cm(-2). CoO-Co/CNF shows a remarkable stability, maintaining, at least, an 82% of its performance for the ORR after the stress tests, even when cycled for more than 100 h. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the structural dynamics of well-defined cobalt oxide nanoislands (NIs) on Au(111) are investigated in situ under potential control. The samples are prepared in ultra-high vacuum and the system is characterized using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). After transfer into the electrochemical environment, the structure, mobility, and dissolution is studied via in situ electrochemical (EC) STM, cyclic voltammetry, and EC on-line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Cobalt oxide on Au(111) forms bilayer (BL) and double-bilayer NIs (DL), which are stable at the open circuit potential (0.8 V-RHE). In the cathodic scan, the cobalt oxide BL islands become mobile at potentials of 0.5 V-RHE and start dissolving at potentials below. In sharp contrast to the BL islands, the DL islands retain their morphology up to much lower potential. The re-deposition of Co aggregates is observed close to the reduction potential of Co2+ to Co3+. In the anodic scan, both the BL and DL islands retain their morphology up to 1.5 V-RHE. Even under these conditions, the islands do not show dissolution during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) while maintaining their high OER activity.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000608229600001

Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) show great potential for the dispersion and exposure of OER catalysts due to their adjustable element compositions and easily decomposable structures. Herein, bimetallic Ni-Co Prussian blue analogs grown on the conductive nickel foam supported by Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets are designed and constructed. Firstly, the uniform dispersion of Ni-Co Prussian blue analogs has been realized on the surface of NF. By means of the confined decomposition of PBAs at calcination temperature, NiSe2/CoSe with the smaller particle size and good dispersion supported on NF can provide the more active sites when containing high electron transfer rate. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) measurements show that the as-prepared NiSe2/CoSe/NF exhibits the very impressive OER activity with low overpotential of 270 mV to reach the current density of 100 mA/cm(2). The special nanoarrays structure, abundant active sites and high intrinsic activity may contribute to the excellent performance. The synergistic effect of nickel-cobalt selenide and support enable superior stability toward OER. This confined decomposition strategy may provide a promising way to controlled assembly of transition metal-based electrocatalyst for OER. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In electro-catalysis, these two parameters are often framed together to improve the understanding of the interactions of a catalyst and a reactant. Generally, "volcano-type" correlations are composed to compare similar catalysts. In this type of corre-lation, kinetic versus thermodynamic parameters are juxtapose to identify the most active catalyst positioned at the top of the volcano trend. In this work, we delve into the obtaining of this type of correlations to clarify the significance and utility. In particular, the study of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been selected due to its importance in energy conversion devices such as fuel cells and metal-air batteries.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2451-9103			WOS:000788053500018

When tested as a catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an La0.6Sr0.4Co0.6Fe0.4O3-delta (LSCF6464) nanofiber catalyst (with a specific surface area of 24.2 m(2) g(-1)) exhibits a potential (vs Ag/AgCl) of 647 mV at 10 mA cm(disk)(-2), which is much smaller than that of a powder-type commercial LSCF (786 mV) and also smaller than that of the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalysts (660 mV). The LSCF6464 nanofiber catalyst further delivers an outstanding durability, with almost no observable change in potential at a current density of 10 mA cm(disk)(-2) for more than 3 h. In contrast, the performance of an IrO2 catalyst degrades continuously under the same testing conditions. The findings suggest that the LSCF nanofiber is a promising OER electrocatalyst for metal-air batteries and water electrolysis.									53	3	0	0	2	0	53			2196-7350			WOS:000405123200006

Modulation of electronic structure of catalysts is critical for improving the performance of the resulting electrodes. Here, we report a facile way to engineer the electronic structure of Ni3FeS by coating a thin polyaniline (PANI) layer for improving electrocatalytic activity for overall water splitting. Experimental investigations unveil that the strong electronic interactions between the lone electron pairs of nitrogen in PANI and d orbitals of iron, nickel in Ni3FeS result in an electron-rich structure of Ni and Fe, and consequently optimize the adsorption and desorption processes to promote the OER activity. Remarkably, the resulting PANI/Ni3FeS electrode exhibited much enhanced OER performance with a low overpotential of 143 mV at a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) and good stability. Promisingly, coupled with the reported MoNi4/MoO2 electrode, the two-electrode electrolyzer achieved a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) with a relatively low potential of 1.55 V, and can generate oxygen and hydrogen bubbles steadily driven by a commercial dry battery, endowed the composite electrocatalyst with high potential for practical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000840501500001	35878590

Carbon-confined transition-metal phosphides derived from coordination polymers and metal-organic frameworks have received great attention. Herein, a CoP/N-doped carbon-400 (CoP/NC-400) nanowire is prepared using a coordination polymer [Co(C4H7NO4)]center dot xH(2)O (Co-Asp, Asp = l-aspartic acid) nanowire as the precursor and template through simultaneous pyrolysis and low-temperature phosphidation. Electrochemical tests indicate that the CoP/NC-400 nanowire displays better OER properties than CoP/NC-300/500 nanowires. The overpotential required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is 320 mV with a minimum Tafel slope of 89 mV dec(-1). Moreover, at a higher current density, the OER performance of the CoP/NC-400 nanowire is superior to that of RuO2. The excellent electrochemical performance of the CoP/NC-400 nanowire is attributed to the high electrochemical surface area and the strong synergistic effect of the CoP nanoparticle and the N-doped carbon nanowire.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000507954100001

MoS2 based HER catalysts are potentially competitive to noble metals but facing the challenges of low conductivity, density of active sites and intrinsic activity in basal planes. Herein, oxygen incorporated V-MoS2 supported on partially sulfurized nickel foam (V-Mo(x)S/NF) are synthesized as binder-free HER catalysts via a one-step in-situ hydrothermal method. By controlling the fed atomic ratios of V/Mo, the optimal V-Mo(0.05)S/NF shows the low HER overpotential of similar to 31 and similar to 115 at 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively in alkaline electrolyte, which is among the most active noble-metal and noble-metal-free HER catalysts reported. In V-Mo(0.05)S/NF, the introduced V and partially sulfurized nickel foam increases the conductivity. The hedgehog-like morphology ensures the exposure of high-density active sites. More importantly, the incorporated surface oxygen can be readily tuned by the fed atomic ratios of V/Mo, which plays the primary role in promoting the intrinsic HER activity for V-Mo(x)S/NF. This work demonstrates the feasibility of boosting HER through the precise control of incorporated surface oxygen in MoS2 based catalysts. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The VMo2S4 nanosheets also show superior water splitting activity with 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.65 V.

Herein, for the first time, the direct growth of Mo-doped Ni3S2 on Ni foams using sodium molybdate as the Mo source at different temperatures is demonstrated. Effects of temperature on the morphology and water splitting performance of Mo-doped Ni3S2 were discussed in detail. It is found that the atomic stoichiometric ratios of Mo and Ni can be controlled by the adjusting of reaction temperature, while the obtained electro-catalysts demonstrate various morphologies, capacitances and chemisorption free energies of hydrogen, which lead to different current densities and hydrogen evolution efficiencies. The electro-catalyst synthesized at 200 degrees C (200-SMN/NF) demonstrates the best regular morphology and electrochemical properties. When employed in oxygen evolution reactions, 200-SMN/NF demonstrates a low over-potential of 180 mV at 100 mA cm(-2). Adapting it as a bifunctional electro-catalyst, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a very low cell voltage of 1.53 V and cycling lifespan of more than 15 h was delivered. Further results indicated elevated hydrogen evolution reaction activity, consisting of a moderate 278 mV over-potential at a 100 mA cm(-2) hydrogen production current density, a small 72.9 mV dec(-1) Tafel slope, and a superior current density compared to that of precious catalyst Pt/C (40%) after-0.53 V. These results underscore the fact that 200-SMN/NF is a high-performance, precious-metal-free electro-catalyst, and provide the foundation for exciting opportunities in water splitting applications.									116	6	0	0	3	0	118			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395072800032

The synergistic effects between Ni and Fe result in the high electrocatalytic performance of porous NiFe electrodes. In 1.0 M KOH, porous Ni7Fe3 attains 100 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 388 mV with a Tafel slope of 35.8 mV dec(-1) for OER, and porous Ni9Fe1 exhibits a low overpotential of 347 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 121.0 mV dec(-1) for HER. The Ni9Fe1//Ni9Fe1 requires a low cell voltage of 1.69 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) current density for overall water splitting. The excellent durability at a high current density of porous NiFe electrodes has been confirmed during OER, HER and overall water splitting. The fine electrocatalytic performances of the porous NiFe-based electrodes owing to the three-dimensionally well-connected scaffolds, aligned pore channels, and bimetallic synergy, offering excellent charge/ion transfer efficiency and sizeable active surface area.

Herein, we develop a core-shell electrocatalyst consisting of an amorphous/crystalline heterophase NiFe alloy encapsulated by ultrathin graphene layers (a/c-NiFe-G) via a rapid microwave thermal shock strategy. The amorphous/crystalline heterostructure generates enriched active sites with high intrinsic activity, while the graphene coatings serve as electron transport pathways and protective layers, resulting in dramatically enhanced OER performance in 1 M KOH with an overpotential (eta(10)) of 250 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 36.5 mV dec(-1), a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.87 s(-1) that is 24 times as high as that of the crystalline counterpart when evaluated on a glassy carbon electrode. Further, when supported on porous Ni foam, the catalyst exhibited an eta(10) as low as 217 mV, along with excellent durability (136 h). Various characterization methods, including X-ray absorption fine structure analysis and density functional theory calculations, reveal that unsaturated coordination configurations and abundant amorphous/crystalline boundaries in a/c-NiFe-G are responsible for its superior OER performance. This work offers insights for constructing metastable amorphous/crystalline heterophase catalysts toward highly efficient electrocatalysis.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000704700800045

By assembling diversiform components with particular features and tuning microstructure on micrometer and nanometer of catalysts felicitously, a huge optimization on its electrochemical performance can be possible. In this work, we report an effective three-dimensional (3D) electrode comprising of hierarchical core-shell structure on conductive nickel foam, in which ultrafine Ni(OH)(2) nanorods are directly grown on the CoMnFe hydroxysulfide nanowires via a three-step facile synthesis. Benefitting from the prominent structural advantages and desirable compositions, several crucial factors conducive to excellent catalytic behavior, including big surface area, highly exposed surface active sites, rapid ionic and electronic transport and open-channels for effective gas releasing, are endowed to the electrocatalyst. Therefore, the resultant CoMnFe hydroxysulfide nanowire@Ni(OH)(2) nanorod nanoarrays exhibit a superior catalytic performance (eta = 264 mV@200 mA cm(-2)) for water oxidation, with a low Tafel slope of 73 mV dec(-1), and a long-term durability for at least 100 h in the alkaline electrolyte. This work broadens the horizon and displays a fresh strategy for the suitable design of efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with new hierarchical hybrid structure.

The strategies are based on two central mechanistic features of its efficient water oxidation: (1) metal-oxo bond formation and (2) threeelectron reductive elimination of O-2. Here, we explore secondary dopants that may promote the latter by enhancing O-O bond formation. From periodic slab models using screened-exchange hybrid density functional theory, we predict that Fe3+-doped beta-NiOOH codoped with Cu2+ or Ag3+ will have even more favorable O-O coupling and molecular O-2 desorption activity at the Fe sites. This work illustrates a mechanism-oriented design principle in the development of oxygen evolution catalysts.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			2380-8195			WOS:000526311000034

The as-synthesized electrode materials were characterized further by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman and X-ray photoelectron (XP) spectroscopic studies. Significantly, Ni doped CZTS electrocatalyst exhibits low overpotential approximately 214 and 400 mV for the hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH electrolyte solutions respectively, and 1.29 V vs RHE for the oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in 1 M KOH at 10 mA/cm(2) current density. Small Tafel slopes and tested durability for longer time i.e. upto 500 min for water splitting, demonstrates that Ni doped CZTS is efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst having high activity along with extraordinary current/potential stability. Moreover, Fe doped CZTS electrocatalyst shows relatively poor response, i.e. overpotential 300 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 445 mV in 1.0 M KOH towards HER and overpotential 1.54 V for the OER in 1 M KOH reaches at 10 mA/cm(2).

These so-called mixed ion and electron transfer (MIET) reactions are crucial in intercalation/insertion electrochemistry, such as that occurring in oxygen reduction/evolution electrocatalysts and lithium-ion battery electrodes. Understanding MIET reaction pathways, particularly identifying the rate-determining step (RDS), is crucial for engineering interfaces at the molecular, electronic and point defect levels. Here we develop a generalizable experimental and analysis framework for constructing the reaction pathway for the incorporation of O-2(g) in Pr0.1Ce0.9O2-x. We converge on four candidates for the RDS (dissociation of neutral oxygen adsorbate) out of more than 100 possibilities by measuring the current density-overpotential curves while controlling both oxygen activity in the solid and oxygen gas partial pressure, and by quantifying the chemical and electrostatic driving forces using operando ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.Identifying rate-determining steps (RDSs) is one of the most challenging aspects of catalysis. This work presents a general framework to identify the RDS of mixed ion and electron transfer reactions, and applies it to the four-electron/two-ion O-2 reduction in solid-oxide fuel cell cathodes, converging on four RDS out of more than 100 possible candidates.									25	2	0	0	1	0	24			2520-1158			WOS:000507787600003

However, the catalytic efficiency of NiFe LDH is always hampered by the slow and incomplete reconstruction during OER process. Herein, a strategy of borate ion (BO33-) regulation is developed to achieve a fast and adequate reconstruction of NiFe LDH. The BO(3)(3- )is easy to fill the oxygen vacancy in NiFe LDH, which can narrow the band gap of NiFe LDH to realize an efficient reconstruction under OER conditions. DFT calculations demonstrate the enhanced effect of BO(3)(3- )on adsorption of hydroxyl ion (OH-) to further improve the OER activity. Sequentially, the BO33-decorated NiFe LDH (NiFeB) shows a desirable catalytic activity for OER with an ultralow overpotential of 201 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is 40 mV lower than the overpotential of pure NiFe LDH. Moreover, membrane electrode assembly cell using anodic NiFeB and cathodic Pt/C for water splitting affords a cell voltage of only 2.0 V to drive a current density of 540 mA cm(-2). This work widens the horizon of ion effect on electrocatalysis and offers an effective approach for developing high-active electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000841965100001

This paper proposes a simple solid-state protocol to fabricate nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (CNT) and cobalt oxide embedded with CNT (Co3O4-CNT) for oxygen evolution reaction and benzoin oxidation. The proximity between cobalt and CNT sites amplifies oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and conductivity. Embedded Co3O4-CNT form an integrated architecture, providing efficient and rapid electron/ion transfer rate. Fabricated Co3O4 -CNT electrocatalyst exhibited OER activity of 317 mV, which was better than that of pristine Co3O4 electrocatalyst (340 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) current density. Impressively, Co3O4-CNT delivers stable response at low and high currents as well as excellent durability over 25 h. Experimental and analytical results verified that maximal electrocatalytic OER activity can be realized by combining a conductive CNT network and catalytically active sites could be further enhanced by nitrogen doping. Additionally, the Co(3)O(4)embedded with CNT upon exploration as a milder, inexpensive, and eco-friendlier catalyst for air oxidation of 2-hydroxy-1,2-bis(3-methoxyphenyl)ethan-1-one (benzoin), produces 3,3'-dimethoxybenzil in high yield (96%). The Co3O4-CNT was further evaluated the catalytic activities after repetitive recycling processes and demonstrated the high yields without the significant loss in the catalytic activity.

Copper, on the other hand, is relatively neglected despite its versatility. In this paper, we describe a series of steps to enhance the OER efficiency of copper-based catalyst, including metal organic framework (MOF)-guided structure control, secondary metal doping, and nitridation. In particular, the effect of growth solvent on coordination kinetics and morphology of the precursor MOFs was studied in detail. The optimal MOF structure was further engineered with Fe doping followed by rapid microwave-assisted nitridation, resulting in CuFeN/CNT composite. Experimental results showed that all three engineering steps have significant impact on the enhanced OER efficiency. CuFeN/CNT composite with optimal Fe doping derived from urchin-shaped CuFeMOF exhibited a greatly enhanced OER performance comparable to that of precious metal catalyst, affording a current density as high as 236.3 mA at an overpotential of 420 mV (RuO2, 215.3 mA). Furthermore, excellent stability in alkaline media was observed during 10 00 cycles and chronopotentiometric analysis for over 20 hours. We highlight that the entire synthesis protocol is environmentally benign and sustainable by employing microwave to enable rapid formation and conversion of the precursors with minimal energy consumption.

Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) has been proven as a promising candidate for OER with attractive activity and stability in alkaline media. In this study, flower-like Co3O4 microstrips have been successfully prepared and directly embedded in Co foam (denoted as Co3O4@Co foam) by a green and facile two-step strategy including hydrothermal treatment and subsequent annealing process under relatively low temperatures. It demonstrates that the OER performance of the Co3O4@Co foam electrode can rival to the commercial RuO2 on glassy carbon electrode. The Co3O4@Co foam electrode displays high OER activity with a low overpotential of 273 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a low Tafel slope of 61.8 mV dec(-1). The flower-like Co3O4 microstrips greatly increase the active surface area to expose more active sites, and the directly growth of Co3O4 micro strips on Co foam with intimate contact improves the electron transport and ensures the stability of the Co3O4@Co foam electrode.

The evolution mechanism featuring a competitive growth of different carbon sources in a closed hypoxic space is elucidated for a series of Fe2O3/Fe5C2/Fe-N-C composites. The size and dispersity of Fe2O3/Fe5C2 nanoparticles, the graphitization degree of the carbonaceous matrix, and their diverse hybridization states lead to disparate electrocatalytic behaviors for the oxygen reduction reaction ORR). Among them, microspherical Fe2O3/Fe5C2/Fe-N-C-3 exhibits an optimal ORR performance and the as-assembled zinc-air battery shows all-round superiority to the Pt/C counterpart.

Herein, we introduce oxygen-containing functional groups associated with defects on the carbon fiber papers (functionalization) via acid treatment and investigate their effects on the rechargeable nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries. The discharge platform increases from 2.68 V to 2.79 V, meanwhile the decreased charge overpotential (a drop of 0.84 V) is also observed after functionalization. It is found that the discharge products formed on pristine carbon fiber exhibit a huge toroidal-like structure, in contrast to the porous flake clusters with much smaller size on the functionalized carbon fiber. On the other hand, the smaller product clusters are found to be much easier to be oxidized, leading to remarkably reduced charge overpotential. In this regard, the decomposition of electrolyte and corrosion of carbon cathode are dramatically alleviated, thus leading to greatly promoted cycling performance. All the experimental facts suggest that the oxygen functional groups associated with defects could provide tremendous active sites for the nucleation of discharge products and result in remarkably decreased overpotential for both the oxygen reduction and the oxygen evolution reaction in our cases.

Herein, a facile hydrothermal strategy is applied to prepare net-like MoSe2-acetylene black (AB), tailoring the interior structure by Ni substrate. The 3D MoSe2-AB nanostructures constructed with MoSe2 ultrathin nanosheets are applied as supercapacitors electrode materials. As expected, the net-like MoSe2-AB composites exhibit a high specific capacitance (2020 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)) and good cycling stability (107.5% after 1500 cycles) due to their unique architecture. The MoSe2-AB composites also show highly electrocatalytic ability for hydrogen evolution reaction (0.08 V of onset potential and similar to 55 mV dec(-1) of Tafel slope). The developed method can be extended to the preparation of other MoSe2-based materials and used in other applications, such as sensors, Li-ion battery or oxygen reduction reaction.

One such novel catalyst based on polyhedron N-doped Ni-Co phosphide is burgeoned directly from the Ni-Co foam (N-NiCoP/NCF) using a facile and eco-friendly approach without involving heavy metal ions. The N-NiCoP/NCF catalyst exhibits superior activity in 1.0 M KOH for overall water splitting, evidenced by the low overpotentials of 78 mV for HER and 225 mV for OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The excellent electrocatalytic activity of N-NiCoP is attributed to the increased Fermi level due to effective N-doping and the abundant exposed active crystal planes (311) of heterostructured Co-2 NiP4 phase. Importantly, the N-NiCoP/NCF catalyst shows ultra-stable electrocatalytic performance while retaining structural integrity in both HER and OER processes during continuous reactions for over 100 h. These results open new avenues for in situ engineering of transition-metal based electrocatalysts used for renewable energy generation.									76	4	0	0	2	0	78			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000472697500041

However, it is challenging to explore an electrocatalyst that simultaneously possesses ORR and OER active sites. Herein, we designed a strategy for one-step adsorption to manufacture a nitrogen-doped carbon-supported Co and Ru single-atom catalyst (Co/Ru SAs-N-C) with outstanding ORR and OER performance under alkaline conditions. The catalyst displays a half-wave potential of 0.855 V in ORR and a low potential of 338 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density in OER, thus obtaining Delta E = 0.713 V. The result of the density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicates that the introduction of Ru sites enhances catalytic performance for ORR and OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000832639700001

Herein, pure phase nickel molybdenum phosphide (NiMoP2) nanowires on carbon cloth are successfully synthesized through a simple and highly reproducible in situ P/O exchange process. Such a NiMoP2 nanowire catalyst requires low overpotentials of 199 and 330 mV to obtain a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, and is among the most active HER and OER electrocatalysts yet reported. The bifunctional NiMoP2 is used as both anode and cathode catalysts in a two-electrode water electrolysis configuration, which delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under a potential of 1.67 V. Furthermore, the overall water-splitting of the bifunctional NiMoP2 nanowire catalyst is further driven by a dry battery with a nominal voltage of 1.5 V which exhibits excellent performance and durability in a strong alkaline electrolyte.									130	9	0	0	2	0	133			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000398889600045

To discriminate such behavior, different catalysts are prepared using the Pechini method varying ZrO2 content, at different Zr/Ru molar ratios: 1, 0.5 and 0.3. The characterization of the materials using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals that no solid solution (Ru-Zr) or any doping that affects the crystalline phase of Zr are obtained, while Sb2O3 was surface-segregated from the bulk to the anode surface affecting the outmost 3-5nm surface layers. There are enormous impacts on the catalytic activity and adsorption properties of the structures as ZrO2 content is increased. The presence of ZrO2 and Sb2O3 shrink the number of favorable oxygen adsorption sites in Ti/ZrO2-RuO2-Sb2O3 catalysts, whence the adsorption energies for oxygen-metal interactions became lower than for Ti/RuO2. Differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS) and electrochemical experiments qualitatively indicate that a lower amount of ZrO2 in the ternary electrode induce a better catalysis towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, O-2 production), while the ionic currents for ClO- and HClO species drop. This behavior suggests that chloride oxidation needs to encompass the mitigation of the OER as the percentage of ZrO2 is increased in the anode. Active chlorine could stem from HClOads species since it was produced in larger amounts than ClOads- according to the pH of the electrolyte, and in adequate levels to generate the degradation of organic compounds.									21	1	0	0	4	0	22			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000432564500028

Herein, using the first-principles computations, the structural, electronic, magnetic, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic properties of single platinum group metal (PGM) atom modified Janus WSSe monolayer systems are comprehensively investigated. The results reveal that the single PGM atom can be stably supported on the W top position of S side and effectively regulate the structural and electronic characteristics of Janus WSSe monolayer. Pd- and Pt-WSSe are effectively screened from the PGMWSSe systems with the outstanding bifunctional catalytic activity elucidated, especially the Pd-WSSe exhibits even smaller overpotentials (eta ORR approximate to 0.39 and eta OER approximate to 0.49 V). The mechanisms of prominent bifunctional catalytic activity of Pd- and Pt-WSSe are summarized including their moderate binding strength with O2 molecule, superior electrical conductivity, high intrinsic electric field and the d orbital occupancy of Pd and Pt atoms. Thus, the effective strategy to reduce the dosage of PGMs in PGM single atom catalysts (SACs) and to boost the bifunctional catalytic performance of Janus WSSe monolayer could be achieved, which would be useful to promote the exploration of novel bifunctional electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000838922300004

However, in these multimetallic catalyst systems, the function of their bridging anionic ligands (e.g., O2-, S2-, and P3-/PO43-) is rarely investigated, partially due to the lack of an ideal material model system. Herein, by combining a careful electrochemical conversion of metal-organic framework (MOF) precursors with low-temperature phosphorization processes, we designed a series of NiFe-based model catalysts as a proof-of-concept platform to identify the roles of different anionic ligands in tuning the redox and electronic properties of metal sites. Our experimental and theoretical results reveal that ligands having varying electron-withdrawing/donating ability can modulate not only the electron density of Ni2+/Fe3+ centers but also the electron transfer efficiency from Ni2+ to neighboring Fe3+ sites. Importantly, synergistically coupled ligands (e.g., S2- and PO43-) with complementary electronic properties help to optimize the chemical environments of the Ni2+/Fe3+ centers (even upon partial catalyst surface reconstruction to NiFe oxyhydroxide), thus giving rise to a remarkable OER activity. These insights open new avenues for developing highly active multimetallic OER electrocatalysts.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2574-0962			WOS:000462944700063

Herein, a series of copper-based alloy (CuM, M = Fe, Co, Ni; FeCo, FeNi, CoNi; FeCoNi) nanoparticles have been synthesized by a rapid microwave assisted solution phase method. Electrochemical measurements show that the catalysts possess outstanding OER activity as well as excellent long-term durability in alkaline electrolyte. The optimized samples of FeCoCu and FeCoNiCu exhibit superior activity with low overpotentials (265 and 269 mV at 10 mA cm-2 ), small Tafel slopes (49 and 48.9 mV dec-1), and low loss of activity after a 24 h stability test, which are much better than that of commercial RuO2. The significant OER activity and stability are mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of multiple metal elements. The alloying strategy promotes the combination of the highly active iron, cobalt and nickel elements with the excellent conductive copper element, which not only changes the electronic structure of the material surface, but also accelerates the electron transfer and provides more active sites, thereby improving the electrocatalytic performance of the material. This work demonstrates an efficient and rapid method to prepare low cost electrocatalysts, which is important for the applications in energy conversion devices.</p>(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Element doping is proved effective in enhancing the photocatalytic performance of p-C3N4. The effect of doping is usually interpreted from the angle of electronic structures by first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, the information on electronic structures is insufficient for understanding and predicting the ultimate criterion of solar-tohydrogen (STH) efficiency. Herein, a DFT calculation method is provided to investigate and predict the STH of VIA group elements doped p-C3N4 by calculating the efficiencies of both light absorption and carrier utilization. Particularly, significant efforts are made to calculate the energy barriers for the surface hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to determine the carrier utilization efficiency. Moreover, the chemisorption energies of the reactant intermediates are calculated to quantify the intermediates affinity for HER and OER on the surface. Among the VIA elements, oxygen is discovered as the most effective dopant in promoting the STH because oxygen-doped p-C3N4 has the lowest energy barriers for OER and the largest chemisorption energy for intermediates absorption. The calculation results highlight the importance of the surface reaction properties for efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting.									3	1	0	0	1	0	3			2367-198X			WOS:000627075200001

In this study, we develop a novel hollow cobalt-borate modified cobalt oxide composite (denoted by Co-B-O@Co3O4) catalyst derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) for electrochemical OER. The Co-B-O@Co3O4 was easily synthesized via pyrolysis of ZIF-67 in Ar and air to produce hollow Co3O4 (denoted by h-Co3O4), followed by simple NaBH4 treatment at ambient temperature for 4 h. The unique polyhedral morphology was well preserved during the NaBH4 treatment. Benefiting from its structural and compositional merit, the as-synthesized Co-B-O@Co3O4 exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability for OER. Also, we conducted the OER test using a Co-B-O@Co3O4 catalyst in a neutral pH environment for further investigation. Our study can provide an insight into catalyst modification step to enhance the overall performance while keeping its physical structure simultaneously. using metal-organic framework for the electrochemical catalyst thus can be recognized as a method for producing a highly active, long-term working and novel engineered electrocatalyst for OER applications.

The prepared La0.6Sr0.4CoxFe1-xO3-delta catalysts possess almost same crystal structures, similar morphologies (except for the LSC catalyst) and slightly different BET surface areas. Upon the optimization of the Co/Fe atomic ratio, the optimal LSCF-82 catalyst exhibits the OER performance with a low onset potential of 1.541 V, a small Tafel slope of 80.56 mV dec(-1), a high charge-transfer rate and a large electrochemical surface area in 0.1 M KOH solution. LSCF-82 catalyst exhibits the long-term stability under the catalytic operation condition for 12 h. Such catalytic activity may mainly cause by the synergy of higher catalytic activity Co and lower catalytic activity Fe. Thus, the reasonable optimization of the transition metal composition in B sites for the perovskite oxides is in favor of the improvement of OER performance.									12	4	0	0	2	0	14			1002-0071	1745-5391		WOS:000443981100001

In this paper the design of a novel cation modulating electrocatalyst Ni3ZnC0.7 using homogeneous bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (NiZn-MOFs) as precursor is reported. The synergistic effect between the unique chemical properties and nanostructure endows Ni3ZnC0.7 with a remarkable electrocatalytic performance. The balance of Ni(0) and Ni(II) achieved by Zn modulation is beneficial to both the hydrogen evolution reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction under alkaline conditions. The bifunctional catalyst, Ni3ZnC0.7, can drive overall water splitting through a symmetrical double electrode at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with only 1.65 mV, and also shows excellent stability without obvious degradation after 24 h of operation, which makes it a promising noble metal free electrocatalyst. This easy preparation method for Ni3ZnC0.7 makes it a promising candidate for a practical answer to water splitting. Furthermore, this cation modulating strategy provides an ingenious way to realize the precise control of the catalysts and can be extended to the synthesis of various novel nanomaterials.									41	1	0	0	1	0	41			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000397608000023

The success needs development of low-cost and high-performance electrode materials. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial reaction in water splitting. The combined Ni and Co oxide developed nanostructures having a small overpotential and fast kinetics of OER. They have drawn considerable attention, because of their theoretically high efficiency, high abundance, low cost, and environmental benignity in comparison with precious metal oxides, such as RuO2 and IrO2. However, the desired efficiency needs the developments of enhanced specific active area and conductivity. In the present communication, we address these issues. Specifically, exfoliation of layer double hydroxide (LDH) is applied to enhance the active surface area. The study reveals that intercalation by calixarene in NiCo LDH affords a multifunctional interlayer to deliver a large active surface area and fast electron transport toward the carbon nano-onion (CNO) support. It favorably lowers the overpotentials in OER (290 mV) and attains Tafel slope of 31 mV/decade. Enhanced conductivity is achieved using CNO as a support for the calixarene intercalated NiCo LDH. These developments offer a synergistic effect in achieving superior electrocatalytic activity for OER. This work gives insight into designing binder-free electrodes in alkaline media with good stability for advanced OER activity.									40	5	0	0	1	0	41			2168-0485			WOS:000441475500018

Herein, ultrathin FeOOH nanosheets (FeOOH NSs, 1.8 nm) with abundant oxygen vacancies are composited with BiVO(4)via an electrostatic adsorption method, and the resulting composite demonstrates a remarkable enhancement in visible-light photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution, approximately 2-fold and 9-fold higher than that of pristine BiVO4, respectively. The kinetics study shows that FeOOH NS loading leads to a 90% decrease in apparent activation energy compared to that of pristine BiVO4. The prominent cocatalyst effect of FeOOH NSs is further validated in RhB degradation with an 8-fold apparent rate constant enhancement. Effective charge carrier separation and transfer are clarified by photoluminescence (PL) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization. The oxygen vacancies, systematically studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron spin resonance (ESR) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) characterization, are experimentally and theoretically demonstrated to be crucial for facilitating photocatalytic water oxidation.									71	2	0	0	4	0	72			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000465152700054

Herein, the synthesis of hierarchically porous nitrogen-doped carbon (HPNC) with bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis for Zn-air batteries is reported. The HPNC catalyst possesses a large surface area of 1459 m(2) g(-1) and exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity toward ORR and OER simultaneously with a low OER/ORR overpotential of 0.62 V, taking the difference between the potential at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and half-wave potential for ORR in 0.1 m KOH. Adopting HPNC as the air cathode, primary and rechargeable Zn-air batteries are fabricated. The primary batteries demonstrate a high open-circuit potential of 1.616 V, a specific capacity of 782.7 mAh g(Zn)(-1) and a superb peak power density of 201 mW cm(-2). The rechargeable batteries can be cycled stably for over 360 cycles or 120 h at the current density of 5 mA cm(-2). As elucidated by density functional theory, N-doping is preferred on defective sites with pentagon configuration and on the edge in the form of pyridinic-N-type.

Recently, iridium and non-noble metal mixed oxides have been identified as promising candidates for the OER in acid media. Herein, we report a novel double mixed metal oxide BaIrO2.937/La3IrO7 with a surface of IrOx formed by Ba and La leaching as an efficient electrocatalyst for boosting the sluggish OER. In 0.1 M HClO4, a low overpotential of 290 mV is required for BaIrO2.937/La3IrO7 to achieve the benchmark of 10 mA cm(-2), comparable to commercial IrO2 and most reported acidic OER electrocatalysts. Moreover, a smaller Tafel slope of BaIrO2.937/La3IrO7 signifies fast reaction kinetics. Significantly important is that the iridium based mass activity was 561.6 A g(Ir)(-1) at 1.63 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode, which is 3.9 times as high as that of commercial IrO2. This work highlights the smart design of double mixed metal oxides with surface reconstruction as highly active and low cost electrocatalysts for the OER in acidic media.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000741538600001

The role of the macroradicals as the main oxygen trapping agents during the inhibition time is identified, and the absence of primary radical consumption by oxygen can be related to a high initiation efficiency at early times. The ratio of the termination reactions reveals that bimolecular termination remains the principal pathway for the cessation of macromolecule growth, even at high polymer conversion. Moreover, the evolution of the termination ratio during the polymerization can be correlated to both the diffusional control of the polymerization reactions as the polymer network grows and the photoinitiator consumption. Finally, the effect of the incident light intensity and the initial photoinitiator concentration on the termination reactions is assessed, and the validity of the steady-state assumption applied to the macroradical concentration discussed.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			0032-3861	1873-2291		WOS:000455024100028

In this paper, we propose a 1D convection-diffusion-reaction model concerning the transport and oxidation of oxalic acid (OA) and oxygen evolution in the flow-through electrochemical oxidation system with REM. It allows the determination of unknown parameters of the system by treatment of experimental data and predicts the behavior of the electrolysis setup. There is a good agreement in calculated and experimental data at different transmembrane pressures and initial concentrations of OA. The model provides an understanding of the processes occurring in the system and gives the concentration, current density, potential, and overpotential distributions in REM. The dispersion coefficient was determined as a fitting parameter and it is in good agreement with literary data for similar REMs. It is shown that the oxygen evolution reaction plays an important role in the process even under the kinetic limit, and its contribution decreases with increasing total organic carbon flux through the REM.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1				2077-0375		WOS:000666729000001	34200417

Different approaches have been proposed and several sources of randomness have been considered. We focus on the case in which the uncertainty arises due to both the initial condition and to point inputs of BOD along the river. No constraints are assumed about the probability distribution functions of the initial condition and inputs; moreover, both non-linear and linear decay reactions of the BOD along the stream are considered. Under these conditions, a stochastic differential approach of the point-process type is proposed and a general semi-analytical solution for the evolution of the BOD probability distribution is obtained. In particular, when the decay reaction is linear a simple analytical solution is deduced, and analytical expressions for the evolution of the moments is given. Some examples are presented in the last part of the work, which would suggest the usefulness of the proposed solution whenever the uncertainty of the inputs and initial conditions are predominant with respect to the randomness in the decay reaction.

However, few reports are available on exploring the PBAs-based materials in the field of water oxidation due to their poor conductivity and limited catalysis performance. Herein, a chemical corrosion strategy is proposed to in-situ hierarchically deposit Ni-Fe Prussian-blue analogue (NiFePBA) on Ni foam (NF) to fabricate the 3D self-supported electrode. Followed by acid etching and calcination at low temperature, this semisacrificial template derives a core-shell heterojunction, in which the undecomposed NiFePBA serves as the core and the surficial NiFe2O4 acts as the shell. This well-designed composite delivers a prominent performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low overpotential of 244 mV at the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and 304 mV at 100 mA.cm(-2). This hierarchical structure provides abundant active sites, facilitates electrolyte infiltration and promotes fast charge and mass transportation, which all contribute to the remarkable activity towards water oxidation. Additionally, the chemical corrosion strategy in this work opens a promising avenue to deposit PBAs or PBAs derivatives on the metal substrates to fabricate multiple 3D self-supported electrodes.

Engineering the band levels is a promising route to design and fabricate nonprecious earth-abundant semiconducting electrocatalysts for OER. Herein, p-type semiconductor electrocatalysts of ultrathin nickel-cobalt inorganic-organic hydroxide hybrid nanobelts [CoxNi1-x(OH)(BzO)center dot H2O, x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, BzO: benzoate] with favorable band structures are proposed. The CoxNi1-x(OH)(BzO)center dot H2O with the energetically favorable flat band level and well matched p-p junction exhibit remarkable OER performances in alkaline environment. The optimal Co0.8Ni0.2(OH)(BzO)center dot H2O nanobelt electrocatalyst with nearly 4 nm in thickness achieves the superior OER performance, showing earlier onset potential (E-onset: 1.50 V vs RHE), smaller overpotential (eta(10): 319 mV) as well as significantly enhanced stability compared with those of IrO2 reference (Eonset: 1.51 V vs RHE and eta(10): 343 mV) and most previously reported OER electrocatalysts. This electronic engineering strategy would provide a new insight to the fundamental understanding of underlying OER mechanism as well as open a new avenue to rational design of semiconducting electrocatalysts with high performances.

Progress in electrocatalytic reactions have shown that the future is limitless in many fields. However, it is urgent to develop efficient electrocatalysts. Here, the first graphdiyne-supported efficient and bifunctional electrocatalyst is reported using 3D graphdiyne foam as scaffolds, and NiCo2S4 nanowires as building blocks (NiCo2S4 NW/GDF). NiCo2S4 NW/GDF exhibits outstanding catalytic activity and stability toward both OER and HER, as well as overall water splitting in alkaline media. Remarkably, it enables a high-performance alkaline water electrolyzer with 10 and 20 mA cm(-2) at very low cell voltages of 1.53 and 1.56 V, respectively, and remarkable stability over 140 h of continuous electrolysis operation at 20 mA cm(-2). The results indicate that this catalyst has a bifunction that overcomes all reported bifunctional, nonprecious-metal-based ones.									152	17	0	0	8	0	157			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000407803500008	28612495

As a 3D OER electrode, this Cu-N-C NA/CF shows high catalytic activity, needing an overpotential of 314 mV to drive a geometrical current density of 20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. It also shows strong long-term electrochemical durability. This suggested that CuO nanoparticles as active species were in situ electrochemically converted from Cu nanoparticles and stably dispersed in the carbon matrix during electrocatalysis.									51	0	0	0	3	0	51			2052-1553			WOS:000432586100025

Understanding the effects of oxygen activating reactions on the cathode's surface during electrochemical cycling can lead to improvements in stability and performance. We used in situ surfaced-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to observe the oxygen-related surface reactions that occur during electrochemical cycling on lithium-rich cathodes. Here, we demonstrate the direct observation of Li2O formation during the extended plateau and discuss the consequences of its formation on the cathode and anode. The formation of Li2O on the cathode leads to the formation of species related to the generation of H2O together with LiOH and to changes within the electrolyte, which eventually result in diminished performance. Protection from, or mitigation of, such devastating surface reactions on both electrodes will be necessary to help realize the potential of high-capacity cathode materials (270 mAhg(-1) versus 140 mAhg(-1) for LiCoO2) for practical applications.									337	18	0	0	12	0	348			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000330202300036	24364760

However, the unsuitable inactive reactions at the air-electrode interface (the oxygen reduction reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction) in the metal-air battery are major challenges. In this study, we report nitrogen (N)doped iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni) bimetallic catalysts with a hollow structure (Fe-Ni nanocage) as outstanding bifunctional catalysts, which have not been reported previously. The open structure in the catalysts simultaneously has an active inner cavity and an outer shell; catalysts have a high active surface area, resulting in remarkable electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the electron transfer phenomenon due to the "ensemble effect" generates a higher catalyst activation. Nitrogen has a higher electronegativity than the metal cations, so doped nitrogen sources draw the electron into iron and nickel cations, and the deprived oxidation state of the metal cations accelerates the electrocatalytic performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000653539100071	33945273

Their chemical nature, potential for chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and possibly atomic layer deposition (ALD) are demonstrated. The development of nonoxidative CVD processes yielding high-quality Ru thin films is realized. Chemical analyses are exercised that vitiate the deceptive assumption of Ru(DAD)(Aryl) complexes being zero-valent through clear evidence for the redox noninnocence of the DAD ligand. Two different CVD routes for the growth of Ru films are developed using Ru((tBu2)DAD)(Cym). Ru thin films from both processes are subjected to thorough and comparative analyses that allowed to deduce similarities and differences in film growth. Ru thin films with a thickness of 30-35 nm grown on SiO2 yielded close-to-bulk resistivity values ranging from 12 to 16 mu Omega cm. Catalysis evaluation of the films in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) results in promising performances based on overpotentials as low as 240 mV with Tafel slopes of 45-50 mV dec(-1). Based on the degradation observed during electrochemical measurements, the impact of OER conditions on the layers is critically assessed by complementary methods.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-7350			WOS:000872161200001

When the alloy is anodized at 10 V, the OER activity in KOH electrolyte is highly enhanced on the alloy anodized at 15 and 20 degrees C, at which non-uniform film growth proceeds. The fraction of the locally thick film regions increases with anodizing time, enhancing the OER activity. Only thin porous films are formed at >= 30 degrees C even though the anodizing current is high because of the promotion of film dissolution at high electrolyte temperatures. Because of the thickness limitation, the OER activity is relatively low when the anodic films are formed at >= 30 degrees C. A good correlation is found between the OER activity and the electric double-layer capacitance; thicker porous anodic films enhance the OER activity. The anodic film formed at each temperature consists of a rutile-type (FeNiCo)F-2 phase, but in KOH electrolyte, it is converted readily to an oxyhydroxide phase, which is OER active. A similar to 2 mu m-thick film obtained under the optimum anodizing condition reduces the overpotential of OER to 245 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 mol dm(-3) KOH electrolyte.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000862699500002

In the present research, novel nanocomposites of 2D zeolitic imidazolate framework-9 (ZIF-9) combined with Colayered double hydroxide (Co LDH) were successfully synthetized through a controllable phase transition from ZIF-9(I). The 3D to 2D structural transformation of ZIF-9 was induced by deionized water, and the formation of 2D Co LDH was simultaneously realized during the one-step fabrication of ZIF-9(III)/Co LDH nanocomposites. Due to the high surface area, the presence of abundant metal sites, and the interactions between 2D ZIF-9(III) and 2D Co LDH, the as-optimized ZIF-9(III)/Co LDH nanocomposite exhibits great electrochemical activities for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (? = 297 mV at 10 mA cm-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution. The electrochemical performance of the ZIF-9(III)/Co LDH nanocomposite was superior to those of the pure Co LDH, ZIF-9(III), and commercial RuO2. The present work demonstrates that the proposed strategy can effectively boost catalytic activities and also design new routes to synthesize advanced MOF nanohybrids for various applications.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000641317500002

Inclusions form during liquid steel processing and are generally detrimental to downstream processing and steel properties. Models predicting inclusion evolution pathways have typically been applied to lower alloy content carbon steels. In this work we investigated a steel composition with alloying elements such as Cr, Co, Mo, and Nb, processed in the AOD, which utilized higher stirring rates and temperatures compared to ladle refining. Calculations were made with FactSage, with effective equilibrium reaction zone (EERZ) kinetic calculations made using the macro processing feature. Results were compared to plant sample compositions and automated inclusion analysis. The high temperatures and stirring rates present in AOD processing were observed to facilitate Mg transfer to the steel and inclusions. Modeling without the Mg*O associate in FactSage more closely fit the observed data. Additional alloying elements did not significantly change slag/metal reactions or inclusion compositions in modeling, but the strong stirring led to inclusion generation processes (reoxidation or slag entrainment) that were not accounted for in the present work. The reduction stage of AOD processing was found to be vital to inclusions in this process route.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0915-1559	1347-5460		WOS:000738077200004

In this study, we demonstrate a one-step wet-chemical strategy for co-engineering the hollow nanostructure and anion intercalation of nickel cobalt layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) to attain highly electrochemical active energy conversion and storage functionalities. Self-templated pseudomorphic transformation of cobalt acetate hydroxide solid nanoprisms using nickel nitrate leads to the construction of well-defined NiCo-LDH hollow nanoprisms (HNPs) with multi-anion intercalation. The unique hierarchical nanosheet-assembled hollow structure and efficiently expanded interlayer spacing offer an increased surface area and exposure of active sites, reduced mass and charge transfer resistance, and enhanced stability of the materials. This leads to a significant improvement in the pseudocapacitive and electrocatalytic properties of NiCo-LDH HNP with respect to specific capacitance, rate and cycling performance, and OER overpotential, outperforming most of the recently reported NiCo-based materials. This work establishes the potential of manipulating sacrificial template transformation for the design and fabrication of novel classes of functional materials with well-defined nanostructures for electrochemical applications and beyond.									19	3	0	0	1	0	19			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000431625200008	29573564

Accordingly, the alkaline water electrolyzer constructed with Ni3Se2/NF (anode) and NiCo2S4/NF (cathode), it requires 1.58 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) current density, with 500 h continuous operation in 1 M KOH. In addition, we demonstrate that the light-driven water splitting using solar panel, it can be a promising approach to facilitate true independence from electricity in H-2 fuel economy. Overall, this methodology is one of the appropriate energy efficient ways to reduce the cost of water splitting devices, as it may simplify the diverse process and equipment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The "as-synthesized" material has been annealed at different temperatures from 200 degrees C to 450 degrees C, under different atmospheres, air and nitrogen. The different samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry (capacitance, charges involved, etc.). The physicochemical and electrochemical characterizations have evidenced that the main effect of the annealing atmosphere is the modification of the transition temperature from an amorphous hydrated phase to a crystalline phase of ruthenium oxide (ca. 300 degrees C under air and ca. 350 degrees C under inert atmosphere according to XRD measurement). The activity of the different catalysts towards the oxygen evolution reaction was evaluated by linear scan voltammetry. In the high overpotential region (E> 1.6V vs. RHE), higher catalytic activities were obtained after annealing at high temperatures, i.e. 400-450 degrees C, independently on the annealing atmosphere. In the low overpotential region (E < 1.5 V vs. RHE), higher activity in terms of exchange current density j(0) was obtained for hydrated ruthenium oxide compounds, which was explained by the ability of materials to oxidize water molecules trapped in the ruthenium oxide lattice.

Here, a facile and scalable strategy was applied to synthesize the bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with high OER activity, and the effects of AC magnetic field on OER was also investigated. Results shows that the bimetallic MOFs (Co0.4Ni0.6-MOF-74) exhibited a three-dimensional flower-like morphology, and possessed a higher BET specific area of 905.39 m(2) g(-1) as well as a smaller median pore size of 0.49 nm as compared to single metal MOFs; It owned a lowest overpotential of 314 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 79.39 mV dec(-1), both are much lower than these of single metal MOFs, being due to the high specific area and more active sites derived from the distorted crystal structure; When AC magnetic field strength equaled to 5.50 mT, over potential at 10 mA cm-2 for Co0.4Ni0.6-MOF-74 reached minimum value of 201 mV, reduced by about 36% as compared to that without magnetic field, indicated that AC magnetic field could greatly improve OER process. These improvements resulted from the spin polarization effect, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) convection and improved active point temperature.

In this work, a dual-metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-assisted fabrication hierarchical and hollow N-doped carbon nanoframes (NCFs) decorated with Fe/Ni-codoped CoTe nanocomposite catalyst (Fe/Ni-CoTe@NCFs) is reported. Starting from MOF-in-MOF composite precursors, the design and fabrication of Fe/Ni-CoTe by the strategies: i.e, hydrothermal precipitation, chemical etching and low-temperature tellurization, and high-temperature pyrolysis steps. Newly designed catalyst (Fe/Ni-CoTe@NCFs) performs superior OER catalytic activity to afford 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 287 mV with a small Tafel slope of 52.3 mV dec(-1). The frame-like hollow core-shell nanostructures with ample channels into the internal volume and high double layer capacitance provide the large catalytic active surface area and increase more actives sites. The cooperative effects between alloy and metal telluride, as well as hollow carbon shell promote the activity of OER. Therefore, this study offers a catalyst with great potential for OER and provides the possibility for the application of transition metal tellurides in electrocatalysis.

The reactants self-assemble into a 3D porous structure with Ru nanoparticles embedded inside. With ultralow N and Ru contents of 2.40 and 1.21at%, the introduction of Ru and N in the 3D graphene aerogel gives rise to multifunctional catalytic performance in oxygen- and hydrogen-involved reactions. Particularly, its performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) surpassed those of commercial Pt/C and RuO2 in terms of both smaller potential (1.62V vs. RHE) to reach 10mAcm(-2) and larger current densities across the applied potential range of 1 to 2V (vs. RHE). Structural and chemical characterization revealed that the nanoparticle size and Ru/RuO2 ratio played decisive roles in determining the aerogel's electrocatalytic performance. Hence, this study demonstrates that the synergistic effect of nanosized Ru and a porous NGA can be applied to achieve effective multifunctional electrocatalysis, for which the Ru nanoparticles can be tailored to achieve optimized performance with the lowest-necessary doping concentration.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000426844600033

Its generation through water splitting is promising for sustainable production. The advancement of highly effective, stable, and profitable materials are the key challenges in catalyst design. In this direction, a novel single-step fabrication strategy employing micro-indented-mechanically-engineered (MIME) multinary (Ni-Fe-Mo-Cu) bare metallic material is an intriguing attempt to develop a highly efficient electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at lower overpotential. This novel idea is based on applying compressive load through a rolling mill to generate micro-indents that act as active sites for the hydroxyl ions for accelerating OER. The Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves showed 10 mA cm(-2) could be generated employing the MIME electrode of 1000 N load at a lower overpotential. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) revealed that the lowest polarization resistance (R-p) was obtained at the same load. The electrocatalytic activity of the electrode was sustained by the formation of the porous oxide film which eventually improved the overall electrochemical surface-area of the electroactive film composed of respective alloying elements confirmed by comprehensive X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis.

The ordered mesoporous carbon nitride (MCN) prepared by a nano hard-templating approach displayed a surface area as high as 648 m(2) g(-1) and a large pore volume of 0.7 cm(3) g(-1) and acted as both the ORR catalyst and the support for the in situ-formed OER catalyst of Pt particles with a diameter of 3-4 nm. The electrochemical performances of the electrode were examined in a solid-state lithium-air cell structured as Li/LATP-based electrolyte/cathode, which demonstrated a higher round-trip efficiency and lower overpotential compared with the Pt@AB and MCN electrodes. The combination of the OER and ORR catalysts is proved as an effective way to improve the performance of lithium-air batteries.

Oxygen vacancies synergistically attired nonstoichiometric and Mo-deficient and O-deficient Bi2Mo3-x(S, O)(12-y) oxysulfide (Mo-/O-deficient Bi2Mo3(S,O)(12)) is found by a one-pot facile method to enhance the photocatalytic H2 evolution and pollutant reduction via in-situ generated protons. The best Mo-/O-deficient Bi2Mo3(S,O)(12)) catalyst with x = 0.75 and oxygen vacancy content of 27.6 % produced 480.87 lmol/h H2 with 25 mg catalyst and achieved AQE of 14.26 % at k = 420 nm, whereas reduced 88.9 % 4-NP and 91.6 % RhB by in-situ generated protons. Bi-non-stoichiometry leads to Mo4+and oxygen vacancy formation and creates active reaction sites of oxygen vacancy and active surface oxygen. These enhancements benefit photogenerated carrier separation efficiency and fast electron transfer and achieve Mo-/O-deficient Bi2Mo3(S,O)(12) with superb PHER. Therefore, non-stoichiometry and sulfur doping into Bi2Mo3O12 bimetallic oxide is a promising approach for designing novel and synergistically defect -attired oxysulfide photocatalysts.

However, considering the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as the the bottleneck in its electrochemical activity, it is desirable to develop water oxidation electrocatalysts operating under alkaline conditions. Herein, in this study, an effective precursor conversion by a bimetallic metal-organic framework (MOF) is proposed for the first time for fabricating the NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) via spontaneously deriving process in the alkaline electrolyte without any additional treatments. The bimetallic MOF-74-derived NiFe LDH provided desirable hot spots for electrocatalizing OER in alkaline solution and facilitated electrolyte penetration within the uniform channel in an organized nanostructure to further increase the contact area between the active material and electrolyte. Compared to pristine NiFe LDH and commercial RuO2, MOF-74-derived NiFe LDH shows higher electroactivity with a promising overpotential of 299 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a lower Tafel slope of 48.7 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH.

There are electrostatic interactions between positive layers of CuTi-LDH and negatively charged inner g-C3N4 sheets. The nanocomposite and its precursors are characterized through various analytical techniques, which affirmed the presence of both g-C3N4 and CuTi-LDH characteristic features. The pore-enriched hybrid geometry of CuTi-LDH@g-C3N4 with high specific surface area (146 m(2)/g), and suitable band gap of 2.46 eV enables the nanocomposite to act as both an electrocatalyst and photoelectrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Both the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical studies are done using 1 M KOH (pH = 13.6) with applied potential of -0.2 V to 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The onset potential of CuTi-LDH@g-C3N4 for OER appears at eta = 0.36 V in dark and eta = 0.32 V under visible light illumination of 30 min. Also, Mott-Schottky analysis shows n-type semiconductor behaviour for CuTi-LDH@g-C3N4 and its precursors. The photoelectrochemical water oxidation proceeds by charge transfer across a Type II heterojunction formed between the CuTi-LDH and g-C3N4 materials. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, the choice of doping elements and methods needs further study. In this work for cobalt selenide, Ni is has been selected for isomorphic doping to NiCoSe2 with silver doped in bulk to obtain Ag-NiCoSe2 nanosheet on NF. The addition of nickel can form a eutectic phase with cobalt to obtain an effective synergistic catalytic effect. The addition of Ag can regulate the adsorption energy of the active site and conductivity. The as-prepared Ag-NiCoSe2/NF has good catalytic performance for OER, and a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) can be achieved with only 270 mV. Its catalytic ability is far superior to that of non-Ag-doped NiCoSe2, which is due to the fact that the sheet structure provides more active sites, and the metal doping modulates the electronic configuration, which effectively improves the intrinsic activity. Moreover, Ag-NiCoSe2/NF can maintain a long-term high-efficiency catalytic process for more than 20 h at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Therefore, this work proves that metal doping is of great significance for improving the catalytic activity of transition metal selenides.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The superior trifunctional electrocatalytic performance can be accredited to the synergetic effect of the rich CoFe alloy sites and the high-content doping of graphitic N, as evidenced with theoretical calculations and experimental results. The introduction of Co and Fe species in the synthesis of the CoFe@NC/NCHNSs catalyst plays the important roles of both anchoring N in the carbon matrix and generating graphitic N species, which critically promote the formation of high-content graphitic-N and therefore further boost the electrocatalytic activity. Impressively, with the as-prepared trifunctional catalyst, the assembled liquid Zn-air batteries and water electrolyzers exhibit excellent catalytic activity and durability, and the solid-state Zn-air batteries show a high-power density up to 125 mW cm(-2), demonstrating a great potential of this kind of devices for practical applications.									49	1	0	0	2	0	49			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000696918200003

Currently, understanding and adjusting the dynamic reconstruction of perovskite during the OER process remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report the artificial construction of a heterostructure by the cation exsolution of perovskite to control the active site formation and reconstruction. The deliberately made La deficiency in LaNiO3 perovskite facilitates the original segregation of NiO from the parent matrix and forms a well-defined interface between perovskite parent and NiO exsolution phase. The dynamic formation process of such heterojunction was studied by density functional theory computation and high quality imaging characterization. Due to the valence redistribution of Ni ions caused by the interfacial electron transfer, the in situ formed LaNiO3/NiO heterostructure displays high electroactivity. Therefore, the LaNiO3/NiO heterostructure exhibits a dynamic surface evolution feature with the generation of the highly active NiOOH layer under a low anodic potential (similar to 1.35 V vs RHE) during the OER process, which is very different from the conventional LaNiO3 with a stoichiometry and NiO catalysts. With the newly formed heterostructure, the reconstructed catalysts impart a 4.5-fold increase in OER activity and a 3-fold improvement in stability against La and Ni dissolution during the OER process. This work provides a feasible interface engineering strategy for artificially controlling the reconstruction of the active phase in high-performance perovskite-based electrocatalytic materials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000810000500001	35623054

Herein, based on a simple quasi chemical vapor deposition (Q-CVD) method, we fabricate a newly Ni3S2@3-D graphene free-standing electrode for efficient OER applications. The Ni3S2@3-D graphene integrates the advantageous features of 3-D graphene and Ni3S2 towards OER, such as more interfacial catalytic sites, pore-rich structure, N-doped structure and good electrical conductivity. Benefiting from the favorable features, the Ni3S2@(3)-D graphene (especially 900 degrees C sample) exhibits excellent OER performances in alkaline medium, which includes a low on-set potential (1.53 V), low overpotential of 305 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a smaller Tafel slope (50 mV dec(-1)). This catalyst also shows ultrahigh stability after chronoamperometry response at 10 mA cm(-2) for 48 h with 30% increase in the current density. The present work opens a new approach for the one-pot construction of hybrid materials between metal sulfide and graphene to increase the electrocatalytic activity of non-noble metal OER catalysts.

Herein, we report an in situ synthesis of dendritic dicobalt phosphide (Co2P) nanostructures with high purity on exfoliated graphene (EG), denoted as Co2P/EG, which show superior performances toward both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The abundant active sites featured by dendritic nanostructures, and fast electron transfer kinetics of EG as well as synergistic effects between active species and substrate contribute to the improved catalytic performances for HER and OER. In specific, for the HER, the CO2P/EG shows excellent activity with a low overpotentials of 163 mV and 157 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. While for the OER, it also exhibits high efficiency with an overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. More impressively, a Co2P/EG parallel to Co2P/EG two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.67 V, along with satisfied stability. An AA dry battery with a nominal voltage of 1.5 V can drive overall water splitting with obvious gas bubble release. Moreover, our synthetic approach might be applied for in situ synthesizing various metal phosphides/EG for electrolysis-based energy conversion. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, electrolytic hydrogen generation is energy intensive and the means to save energy have been widely studied, as for example, the use of proton exchange membranes to minimize the voltage drop across the electrolyte. This research focuses in developing inexpensive alternative anode materials for oxygen generation in order to substitute expensive conventional anodes such as dimensionally stable anodes (DSAA (R)). The geometric and electronic factors of the starting 'electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD) material' are modified to enhance its electrochemical activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction. This has been achieved while using different dopants as additives during electrodeposition of MnO2. The linear voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis showed an increase in the surface area for the modified EMD (MEMD). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) associated with elemental analysis (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)) illustrate a change in the oxygen composition and acidity which is correlated to the changes in electronic factor of the EMD. These results elucidate the improvement in overpotential observed for MEMDs when compared to that of DSAA (R) at the current density of 100 mA cm(-2).									15	0	0	0	3	0	15			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000351702700019

Herein,using the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a probe reaction, we deliberatelyintroduced base-soluble Zn(II) or Al(III) sites into NiFe layered double hydroxides(LDHs), which are one of the best OER catalysts. Then, the Zn(II) or Al(III) siteswere selectively etched to create atomic M(II)/M(III) defects, which dramaticallyenhanced the OER activity. At a current density of 20 mA.cm-2, only 200 mV overpotential was required to generate M(II) defect-rich NiFe LDHs, which is the best NiFe-based OER catalyst reported to date. Density functional theory(DFT) calculations revealed that the creation of dangling Ni-Fe sites (i.e., unsaturated coordinated Ni-Fe sites) by defect engineering of a Ni-O-Fe site at the atomic scale efficiently lowers the Gibbs free energy of the oxygen evolutionprocess. This defect engineering strategy provides new insights into catalysts atthe atomic scale and should be beneficial for the design of a variety of catalysts.									37	9	0	0	0	0	38			1998-0124			INSPEC:18603151

However, here we demonstrate that the electrolysis governing reaction in hydrothermal solutions is different from the electrolysis performed at atmospheric pressure and temperatures up to 100degreesC. Experimental electrolytic reaction of aqueous salt solution carried out inside a scaled 300-mL batch autoclave showed that; accumulation of hydrogen gas, oxygen gas and chlorine is highly suppressed under hydrothermal (250degreesC and 7 MPa) conditions. We have also observed that, when organics are present in the aqueous salt solution being hydrothermally electrolyzed, an effective oxidation of organics is accomplished. Furthermore, for hydrothermal electrolytic oxidation (HEO) with oxygen gas added, experimentally observed TOC removal profile demonstrates apparent anodic oxidation electrical current efficiency of almost 200% for high-concentrated acetic acid solutions.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0895-7959			WOS:000175022800052

Herein, we demonstrate a novel approach for the synthesis of a nitrogen and phosphorus dual-doped mesoporous carbon-encapsulated iron phosphide (FeP@NPC) nanostructure and its multifunctional electrocatalytic activity toward an oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction for zinc-air battery (ZAB) and alkaline water-splitting applications. FeP@NPC is obtained by the carbothermal reduction of the precursor complex [Fe(bpy)(3)](PF6)(2) in the presence of melamine without any traditional phosphidating agent. The PF6- counteranion is used for the phosphidation of Fe. FeP@NPC obtained at 900 degrees C (FeP@NPC-900) exhibits excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic performance with a very low potential gap (Delta E = E-1/2(ORR) - E-j10(OER)) of 670 mV. The ZAB device delivers a peak power density of 190.15 mW cm(-2) (iR-corrected), specific capacity of 785 mA h g(zn)(-1), and energy density of 706.5 Wh kg(zn)(-1) at SO mA cm(-2). The ZAB exhibits excellent charge-discharge cycling stability for over 35 h with negligible voltaic efficiency loss (0.9%). Three CR2032 coin-cell-based ZABs made of an FeP@NPC-900 air cathode connected in series power 81 LEDs for 15 min. FeP@NPC-900 also has promising electrocatalytic activity toward water splitting in acidic as well as in alkaline pH. The benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved with a two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzer at a cell voltage of 1.65 V. ZAB-powered water electrolyzer is made by integrating two rechargeable ZABs connected in series with the two-electrode water electrolyzer. The ZAB powers the electrolyzer for 24 h without a significant loss in the open-circuit voltage. The catalyst retains its initial structural integrity even after continuous water electrolysis for 24 h.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000800295400029	35344334

The modifications that hydrogen peroxide induces on the radical reaction mechanism and the consequences on the effluent ecotoxicity are analyzed. The synergistic effect between oxygen and hydrogen peroxide in the initiation step of the reaction is verified. Hydroperoxy radicals, produced by the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and adsorbed oxygen, initiate the reaction on the carbon and in the liquid phase. They are responsible for the increased initial activity which provokes a faster removal of phenol and aromatic intermediates and, therefore, of the toxicity. The adsorbed oxygen on the carbon is crucial for the efficient consumption of hydrogen peroxide. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a series of hybrid electrocatalysts by embedding FeSb alloy nanoparticles in nitrogen-doped carbon layers (FeSb-N-CLs) have been prepared by a facile pyrolysis of solid-phase precursor. The optimized FeSb-N-CLs-50 cathode catalyst exhibits excellent activity and stability to the ORR and OER in alkaline medium, which can be competitive with commercial Pt/C catalyst (20%). More importantly, the good performance and high stability of the primary and rechargeable zinc-air batteries employing FeSb-NCLs-50 as cathodes further demonstrate this hybrid catalyst is a favorable and promising candidate to replace noble metal-based catalysts for the application in zincair batteries.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000413763100025

Herein, Fe had been incorporated into cobalt silicate hydroxide nanosheets and the resulted material achieves a competitive OER catalytic activity. It is found that the doping state obviously affects the electrical transport property. Specifically, highly dispersed Fe atoms (low-concentration Fe doping) trigger slight electron transfer to Co atoms while serried Fe (high-concentration Fe doping) attract vast electrons. By introducing 6 at.% Fe doping, partial relatively inert Co sites are activated by atomically dispersed Fe, bearing an optimal metal 3d electronic occupation and adsorption capacity to oxygen intermediate. The introduced Co-O-Fe unit trigger the pi-donation effect and decrease the number of electrons in pi*-antibonding orbitals, which enhance the Fe-O covalency and the structural stability. As a result, the sample delivers a low overpotential of 293 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work clarifies the superiority of atomically dispersed doping state, which is of fundamental interest to the design of doped catalyst.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11				2575-0356		WOS:000687066600001

Here, it is found that the metallic nickel domains and high-valence reduced molybdenum ions of NiFeMo electrocatalysts grown on a 3D conductive and porous electrode without using binders enable ultrahigh performance in OER. High resolution-transmission electron microscope and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analyses show that metallic nickel domains with Ni-Ni bonds are generated on the catalyst surface via a dry synthesis using nitrogen plasma. Also, Mo K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy reveals that Mo6+ ions are reduced into high-valence modulating Mo4+ ions. With the metallic nickel domains facilitating the adsorption of oxygen intermediates to low-coordinated Ni-0 and the Mo4+ pulling their electrons, the catalyst exhibits about 60-fold higher activity than a Mo-free NiFe catalyst, while giving about threefold faster charge transfer along with longer stability over 100 h and repeated 100 cycles compared to a bare NiFeMo catalyst. Additionally, these metallic domains and high-valence modulating metal ions are exhibited to give high Faradaic efficiency over 95%.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000472198100002	30884157

Herein, Co3O4@LaCoO3 heterojunctions with abundant oxygen vacancies, subtle lattice distortion, and atomic-level coupled interfaces were synthesized in a nonequilibrium stoichiometric ratio. The synthesized product shows exceptional bifunctional catalytic activity and robust stability in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). As demonstrated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS), the heterojunction structure between Co3O4 and LaCoO3 was formed, which is beneficial for its electrocatalytic properties. The enhanced catalytic capacity is also evidenced by the results of experimental measurements and first-principles calculations. Furthermore, the Co3O4@LaCoO3 assembled Zn-air batteries (including routine liquid batteries and flexible solid-type batteries) exhibit a large peak power density, high open-circuit potential, and a long-term cycle life.

Herein, we develop a robust and hierarchical nano-island structured iron-cobalt phosphides nanostructures (NIs-FeCoP-B NS) on nickel foam (NF) electrode using a facile and single step electrochemical strategy. The self-activated and self-supported fabrication of NIs-FeCoP-B NS (where "B " represents the ratio of Fe and Co (1:1)) exhibits an excellent OER activity in terms of low onset potential (-1.37 V), low overpotential (?) (-0.197 V at 10 mA cm-2), small Tafel slope (-67 mV dec-1), and good durability (over 100 hr) among other electrodes developed in this study, overtaking the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst. The FeCoP-B nano-island electrode demonstrates the efficient catalytic performance and fast kinetics towards the OER. Such a boosted catalytic activity may be ascribed to the promotional effect of Fe and CoP that can assist the formation of FeCoP-OH and chemical adsorption of OH- groups, possessing abundant active sites. The present work would open new modes in design of Earth-abundance transition metal based high-performance electrocatalysts for emergent electrochemical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000870696700011

In principle, all the catalysts possessing such a transition might be active toward OER. However, current OER electrocatalysts are still mainly limited in metal oxides, (oxy)-hydroxides, phosphides, and chalcogenides, etc. Little attention is paid to the rational design of electrocatalysts based on the transformation-induced strategy. Herein, we demonstrated a Fe-based organic-inorganic hybrid strategy for the construction of OER electrocatalysts based on the in situ transformation. Hierarchically three-dimensional (3D) iron alkoxides of glycerol were synthesized in choline chloride (ChCl)/glycerol deep eutectic solvent (DES). During the OER, the as-prepared Fe-based organic-inorganic hybrid can transform into FeOOH, an active species for electrocatalysis, exhibiting sustainable electrocatalytic performance. It only requires 280 mV to offer a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and has a small Tafel slope of 47 mV decade(-1) in 1 M KOH solution, outperforming most reported Fe-based catalysts. This work provides the concept of DES-mediated organic-inorganic hybrid materials as transformation-induced catalysts toward OER, thus casting new light on the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts for water splitting.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2574-0962			WOS:000469885300042

Bulk experiments were performed under real discharged effluent conditions (pH and conductivity) in order to verify the applicability of direct and mediated electrochemical oxidation by applying 2.5 and 5.0 mA cm(-2). Results clearly showed that, a partial elimination of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was achieved, depending on applied current density. Using Pt/Ti, by applying 2.5 and 5.0 mA cm(-2), COD removal efficiencies of 25.2% and 30.49% were obtained. Under the same conditions, a minor COD removal was achieved by using BDD electrode. However, the removal efficiencies were improved when Cl-mediated oxidation approach was employed, obtaining 63.7% and 60% for Pt/Ti by applying 2.5 and 5.0 mA cm(-2), respectively; while for BDD electrode, COD removals were about 15% and 47%, under the same conditions. These figures are in agreement with the polarization curves obtained, where it was possible to confirm that the concentration of halide in solution increases the importance of Cl-2/oxy-chloro radicals system depending on the electrocatalytic material and this behavior plays an important role in relation with the oxygen evolution reaction, influencing on the efficiency of electrochemical approach adopted.

This catalyst exhibited 80% of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of a Sigma 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst; and 61% of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of a 20 wt% RuO2/C catalyst in alkaline solution. Extensive material characterizations by field-emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were undertaken to suggest some possible reasons for the good electrochemical performance. The catalyst also delivered good performance in full zinc-air cell tests where it was used in the air electrode. The MCF catalyst has effectively combined the ORR activity of manganese oxide, the OER activity of cobalt oxide; and the electronic conductivity of bulk Fe3O4 into an integrated bifunctional catalytic system; and its good contact with the N-rGO nanosheets also reduces the external transport resistance in oxygen electrocatalysis.									102	3	0	0	7	0	103			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000342079200067

Herein, we report a simple metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived synthetic strategy to fabricate low-dimensional (LD) nanohybrids formed by zero-dimensional (0D) ZrO2 nanoparticles (NPs) and heteroatom-doped two-dimensional (2D) carbon nanostructures. The 2D platforms controlled the electronic structures of interfacial Zr atoms, thus producing optimized electron polarization for boron and nitrogen-doped carbon (BCN)/ZrO2 nanohybrids. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and theoretical studies revealed the key role of the synergistic couple effect of boron (B) and nitrogen (N) in interfacial electronic polarization. The BCN/ZrO2 nanohybrid showed excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity, delivering an overpotential (eta(10)) of 301 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA-cm(-2) for the OER process and a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.85 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for the ORR process, which are comparable to the state-of-the-art LD nanohybrids. Furthermore, BCN/ZrO2 also showed competitive performances for water-splitting and zinc-air battery devices. This work establishes a new route to fabricate highly efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts by tuning the electronic polarization properties of 0D-2D electrochemical interfaces.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000743237600001	35014264

Herein, a multiple transition metal doping approach is developed through the incorporation of both Co and Nb into hierarchical MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets directly grown on micro-TiO2 hollow spheres (Co,Nb-MoS2/TiO2 HSs) to boost the hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The Co and Nb dual-doping effects modify the electronic structure of the host MoS2 towards maximizing the HER, OER, and ORR performance. Additionally, the unique hollow spherical structure and heterostructured synergistic effects between the TiO2 core and MoS2 shell provide effective channels for electron transfer and large surface area with abundant exposed void spaces for ion diffusion/penetration. Therefore, the Co,Nb-MoS2/TiO2 HSs catalyst demonstrates extraordinary activity and stability with small overpotentials of 58.8 and 260.0 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for the HER and OER, respectively. When employed as both cathodic and anodic electrode in an electrolyzer, the catalyst requires an operating voltage of 1.57 V to achieve 10 mA cm-2. The catalyst also exhibits great potential for the ORR with high onset potential of + 0.96 V and half-wave potential of +0.87 V, as well as direct four-electron transfer process.									102	3	0	0	5	0	104			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000634232200002

Fabrication of high-performance and well-stocked OER catalysts is the key to the large-scale implementation of these energy-related technologies. Two-dimensional (2D) materials get a lot of attention as OER catalysts due to their large specific surface area, abundant active sites, and adjustable structures and compositions. Here, an overview is presented for the latest achievements in design and synthesis of 2D materials (including layered double hydroxides, metal-organic frameworks and their derivatives, covalent-organic frameworks, graphene, and black phosphorus) for the OER, emphasizing novel strategies (including metal/nonmetal doping, defect engineering, interface engineering, lattice strain, and fabrication of heterojunction) for achieving high electrocatalytic activity. Peculiarly, the structure-function relationship is analyzed in detail to gain deeper insight into the reaction mechanism, which is crucial to rational design of more high-performance 2D materials for the OER. Finally, the remaining challenges to improve the OER performance of 2D electrocatalysts are put forward to indicate possible future development of 2D materials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000828939000001

Upon subsequent annealing, Fe3O4/C and Al-doped Fe3O4/C were obtained, respectively. In the two obtained calcined samples, Fe3O4 nanopolyhedra are not only anchored on the in-situ generated carbon material, but also coated by graphene-like ultrathin nanosheets. The carbon materials not only provide conductive networks to enhance the electrical conductivity of the composite material, but also prevent the aggregation of Fe3O4 nanopolyhedra. Al-doped Fe3O4/C shows outstanding long-term oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity during 60 h-electrolysis at 20 mA cm(-2) with overpotentials of only 215 and 359 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the rate-determining steps (RDS) on the Fe3O4 and Al-doped Fe3O4 surfaces are both the formation of *OOH, and the doping of Al3 thorn into Fe3O4 can lower the delta G (1.969 eV) and overpotential (0.739 V) of the RDS during the OER process, which is due to the fact that the d-band center of Al-doped Fe3O4 is positively shifted in comparison with that of Fe3O4, thus improving the affinity of the catalytic surface toward *OOH.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000794037600013

Deriving carbon support from waste materials is an environmentally green approach. In the present study, the pyrolysis of the heterogeneous mixture containing synthetic disposal material and nickel salt yields N-doped carbon fibers-supported nickel oxide (NiO@CFs) hybrid electrocatalyst. The NiO nanoparticles are well incorporated on the porous carbon base, which has densely packed sharp-edge carbon fibers (CFs). The unique carbon structure incorporated with the NiO nanoparticles that facilitates the adsorption of electrolyte ions, rushes the transfer of electrolyte ions, and thus enhances the electrochemical activity. The as-derived carbon support maximized the electrocatalyst active sites while utilizing low electrocatalyst mass loading. Specifically, the synthetic disposable material-derived-carbon fibers supported NiO (NiO@CFs) hybrid electrocatalyst exhibited remarkably higher surface area and lower charge transfer resistance when compared to that of bare NiO. Intriguingly, the NiO@CFs hybrid electrocatalyst exhibited desirable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance (? = 280 mV at 10 mA cm-2) and consistent durability for a 24 h continuous run. This study emphasizes that the utilization of synthetic disposal materials for deriving carbon support is an environmentally effective methodology to incorporate/hybridize electrochemically active materials for the various electrochemical applications.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000640909800006

In this work, we introduce a one-pot synthesis method to fabricate a series of mesoporous metal cobaltite (m-MCo2O4, M = Mn, Ni, and Zn) electrodes for the OER. The method involves preparation and coating of a homogeneous clear solution of all ingredients (metal salts and surfactants) over a fluorine-doped tin oxide surface as a thin lyotropic liquid crystalline film and calcination (as low as 250 degrees C) to obtain a 400 nm thick crystalline m-MCo2O4 electrode with a spinel structure. Mesophases and m-MCo2O4 films are characterized using structural and electrochemical techniques. All electrodes are stable during the electrochemical test in 1 M KOH aqueous solution and perform at as low as 204 mV overpotential at 1 mA/cm(2) current density; the m-MnCo2O4 electrode works at current densities of 1, 10, and 100 mA/cm(2) at 227, 300, and 383 mV overpotentials after compensating the IR drop, respectively. The Tafel slope is 60 mV/dec for the m-NiCo2O4 and m-ZnCo2O4 electrodes, but it gradually increases to 85 mV/dec in the m-MnCo2O4 electrode by thermal treatment, indicating a change in the OER mechanism.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2574-0962			WOS:000636714000082

Its derivative, the hierarchically structured Co3O4/NiCo2O4/Ni foam (CO/NCO/NF) composite, is successfully fabricated by the oxidation of ZIF-67/NiCo-LDH/NF, which exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance. When assessed as an electrode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the CO/NCO/NF electrode shows low overpotentials of 320 and 407 mV at 10 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively, in 0.1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte and an excellent long-term electrochemical durability with 88% current preservation during a 60 h test. It is also found that the OER activities of CO/NCO/NF electrode are superior to those of NCO/NF and CO/NF electrodes, demonstrating that the strong interaction of the interconnected interface of Co3O4 nanocages (CO NCs) and NiCo2O4 nanosheets (NCO NSs) is advantageous to increase the number of Co3+, improve conductivity, enhance structural stability, facilitate electronic transfer, and reduce reversible ion accumulation at the interface. In addition, the hierarchical architecture of the composite is binder-free and good for enhancing mass transport, boosting the dissipation of gases, as well as exposing catalytic active sites in the process of water electrolysis.									31	1	0	0	1	0	32			2168-0485			WOS:000475838100031

Several attempts have been undertaken in recent years to produce better electrocatalysts for the water oxidation process, with a focus on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes. A lot of work has gone into designing effective manganese-based heterogeneous catalysts for the water oxidation process, and a number of synthesized manganese oxides have been shown to have good alkaline OER activity. With the first-ever description of a natural material (rock varnish) constituted of birnessite (delta-MnO2) combined with clay minerals as a potential OER catalyst, the current work represents a typical scenario of the marriage between energy and the environment. This natural material having a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a lower overpotential (eta) of 312 mV and a Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1) exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic performance on par or better than its synthesized Mn-based electrocatalysts. Rock varnish paves the way for developing highly active as well as stable manganese-based water oxidizing catalysts and may serve as a model for the biomimetic inspired synthesis of novel classes of MnO2-clay based composite materials as efficient water electrocatalysts for our future clean energy needs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000789967800001

In this work, both the primary and rechargeable Zn-air batteries with NiCo2O4 nanosphere and carbon nanotubes hybrid (NiCo2O4-CNTs) as cathode catalyst are reported. The catalysts are synthesized through a facile one-pot precipitation reaction and hydrothermal process, which exhibited highly active bi-functional catalytic activity for both ORR and OER. Using NiCo2O4-CNTs hybrid as a cathode catalyst, the resulting practical primary and electrochemically rechargeable Zn-air batteries give a promising discharge peak power density as high as 320 mW cm(-2), and a high current density 210 mA cm(-2) at 1.0 V. Also, the rechargeable Zn-air batteries in a two-electrode configuration exhibits an unprecedented small charge discharge voltage polarization of similar to 0.75 V at 10 mA cm(-2), high reversibility and stability over long charge and discharge cycles. The high performance is believed to be induced by the hybrid effect (coupling effect) among NiCo2O4 and CNTs, which can produce a synergy enhancement for both catalytic ORR and OER.

Here, we elaborately prepared a cobalt sulfide catalyst to perform a comprehensive study of the OER performance under neutral/alkaline conditions. The combination of synchrotron-based operando X-ray spectroscopic investigations and electron microscopy observations captured a chameleon-like structural self-optimization on the cobalt sulfide oxygen evolution electrocatalyst in both neutral and alkaline electrolytes. Driven by the actual working conditions (pH gradient, electrical potential, etc.), distinct catalytic sites could be activated dramatically. In particular, the CoOOH supported on a single-walled carbon nanotube (CoOOH-SWCNT) with residual S species was identified as the true catalyst under alkaline conditions rather than the entirely transformed CoOOH-SWCNT, while the oxygenated CoS-SWCNT (O-CoS-SWCNT) was formed as the true catalyst under neutral conditions. Undoubtedly, such a mechanism of opening different locks with different keys and its microstructural advantages together guarantee the high catalytic activity in different electrolytes. This work provides a promising catalyst as well as sheds light on the very essence of the structural self-optimization process of catalysts. It makes a significant contribution to the advancement of OER relevant studies in the future while providing new ideas for the fields of chemistry and catalysis.									38	3	0	0	3	0	40			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000621101100030

Both the Pt loading and the thickness of WO3 interlayer between Pt nanoparticles and W metal surface were varied. The chemical and electrochemical stability tests in 0.1 mol dm(-3) HCIO4 solution were performed by cyclic voltammetry. These test revealed that the shape of cyclovoltammetric curves displayed relatively slight dependence on the number of cycles. The shape changes were attributed to a slight redistribution of WO3 over the composite surface. Tracking for the synergistic effects in the Pt/WO3 system, the influence of both WO3 thickness and Pt loading on the kinetics of both hydrogen evolution/oxidation (HER/HOR) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in acidic solution were investigated. The kinetics of HER was found to be a) independent on the WO3 thickness, and b) inversely proportional to the Pt loading. For ORR we found that the onset potential, approaching thermodynamic limit of 1.23 V vs. RHE, was almost independent on oxide thickness, while the reaction kinetics was commensurable to the Pt loading.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1452-3981			WOS:000405200600093

HER rate was enhanced in all the cases. The lowest overpotential, only 30 mV more than that at a Pt electrode at -15 mA/cm(2), was observed at Au electrode modified by BNNS decorated with Au-Ni NP. To confirm the importance of BNNS, the HER rates at Au electrode modified by rGO decorated with Au and Au-Ni NPs were also examined. Although the reduction of overpotential was observed even using rGO as a support, the effect was less than that using BNNS as a support by ca. 80 mV, showing the importance of BNNS for enhanced HER activity.

In this work, a detailed mechanistic study of the water oxidation mechanism of the [Ru-II(npm)(4-pic)(2)(H2O)](2+) (npm = 4-t-butyl-2,6-di(1',8'-naphthyrid-2'-yl)-pyridine, pic = 4-picoline) complex, [Ru-II-OH2](2+), reveals oxygen atom transfer from highly reactive ruthenium oxo intermediates to noncoordinating nitrogen atoms of the ligand as a novel route for oxygen evolution via storage of oxidizing equivalents as N-oxide groups on the ligand framework. Theoretical calculations show that the initial complex, [Re-II-OH2](2+), is transformed to a di-N-oxide [Ru-II-OH2,(-NO)(2)](2+) complex upon oxidation via facile OAT steps from Ru-V =O species and that [Ru-V =O-N,(-NO)(2)](3+) represents the most likely reactive species for the critical O-O bond formation. Furthermore, a new stepwise mechanism for oxygen evolution is introduced, which proceeds via coupling of Ru-O and N-O moieties producing a peroxide intermediate, [Ru-V-OO-N,(-NO)](3+), and can compete with the water nucleophilic attack pathway for the oxygen evolution reaction. In this mechanism, a water molecule is oxidatively activated to an "oxygen atom" which is "stored" at a noncoordinating pyridine. Oxidative activation of a second water molecule, facilitated by coordination expansion of the intermediate N-oxide, generates the second oxygen atom required to produce a dioxygen molecule.									9	0	0	0	0	1	9			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000530668400021	32314576

The concomitant presence of different mechanisms during the photodeposition of Pt nanoparticles onto TiO2 in the presence of water and alcohol is evidenced. According to the process, one can devise various complex mechanisms. The presence of nanoparticulated oxide anatase phase enhances the photodeposition process of metal nanoparticles via the so-called heterogeneous photocatalysis. A description and the effect of mixing of various chemicals in the reactor reveal interesting information, which allows controlling the size of nanoparticles by the photodeposition process.

A correlation is established between catalytic activity and cobalt entities that are present upon the surface. The existence of surface Co2+ and oxygen vacancies is essential for efficient WGSR It is observed that, at 200-300 degrees C, there is the transformation of Co3O4/CeO2 to CoO/CeO2-x, with the formation of extra surface oxygen vacancies. At 300-400 degrees C, a CoO1-x/CemCo1-mOn phase highly active for the WGS reaction is formed. According to DFT atomistic thermodynamics calculation, the reconstruction of active cobalt species at equal oxygen chemical potential facilitates the adsorption of CO and H2O at specific sites, resulting in the superior catalytic performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0888-5885			WOS:000500025600008

In this study, a diffusion-reaction model is developed for the internal sulfate attack (ISA) problem due to the oxidation of the pyrrhotite into the aggregates. The model takes into account the kinetics of the pyrrhotite oxidation under the two main oxidizers and the oxygen transport in the concrete. The dependence of the water content of the concrete is included in the analysis, which affects the reaction kinetics and oxygen diffusion. The developed model is applied to two real dams affected by the ISA. The results obtained validate the model and demonstrate its potential for evaluating and predicting the behavior of structures affected by the ISA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, utilizing ionic compound NaF and heteroatom-N-rich urea as morphology directing reagents, ultralong needle-like N-doped Co(OH)F supported on carbon fiber paper has been synthesized through a one-step hydrothermal method. Specifically, the hydrothermal kettle provides a stable environment for the formation of ultra-long needle-like structures. Meanwhile, with the addition of halogen anion F- and heteroatom N, a wealth of oxygen vacancies are obtained, and the OER activity is enhanced. The as-prepared N-doped Co(OH)F-CFP (N:Co(OH)F-CFP) has excellent hydrophilicity, which facilitates its contact with the electrolyte and then accelerates the passing of electrons back and forth between the surface of the material and the electrolyte. Under alkaline conditions, N:Co(OH)F-CFP's OER activity is superior to that of IrO2. Its potential can reach 1.540 V (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 69.75 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18				2052-1537		WOS:000448416200008

Here, an innovative electrode design strategy is proposed to build electron/proton transport nanohighways to ensure that the whole electrode meets the TPB, therefore significantly promoting enhance oxygen evolution reactions and catalyst utilizations. It is discovered that easily accessible/tunable mesoporous Au nanolayers (AuNLs) not only increase the electrode conductivity by more than 4000 times but also enable the proton transport through straight mesopores within the Debye length. The catalyst layer design with AuNLs and ultralow catalyst loading (approximate to 0.1 mg cm(-2)) augments reaction sites from 1D to 2D, resulting in an 18-fold improvement in mass activities. Furthermore, using microscale visualization and unique coplanar-electrode electrolyzers, the relationship between the conductivity and the reaction site is revealed, allowing for the discovery of the conductivity-determining and Debye-length-determining regions for water splitting. These findings and strategies provide a novel electrode design (catalyst layer + functional sublayer + ion exchange membrane) with a sufficient electron/proton transport path for high-efficiency electrochemical energy conversion devices.									30	1	0	0	0	0	30			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000516833300001

Herein, an N-engineering ultrathin bimetallic oxyphosphides nanosheets on Ni foam (CoNiOP/NF) as a multi-functional binder-free electrode was synthesized for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The catalytic activity of the composites could be improved through introducing N-doping via an in-situ transformation and heterogeneous metals by ion exchange. Both theoretical calculation and experimental investigations confirmed that electrons transferred from metal centers to anion at the interface, which was favor to accelerate the phase transformation to electrochemically active species and optimize the intermediates adsorption dynamics, thus providing greatly enhanced electrocatalytic activities. Assembled an electrolyzer using UOR replaced OER, it required only 1.42 V to achieve 50 mA cm(-2) with long-term stability, 214 mV less than that required for HER parallel to OER. This work would be beneficial for the exploitation of non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for simultaneous realization of energy-saving urea-assisted electrolytic hydrogen production and urea-containing wastewater purifying.

Pr6O11 has a unique 4f electronic structure and the highest oxygen ion mobility among rare earth oxides, exhibiting superior electronic, optical, and chemical properties. These unique properties might endow it with advanced catalytic activities for LOBs. This work reports two crystal forms of Pr6O11 as novel catalysts and regulates the oxygen vacancy (Vo) concentrations by feasible calcination. Thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirm the conversion from commercial Pr6O11 to cubic fluorite Pr6O11 and Vo-rich Pr6O11. Photographs, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction, XPS, and electron paramagnetic resonance robustly demonstrate the temperature-dependent evolution of V-o. Ex situ XPS, scanning electron microscopy, and electrochemical techniques are used to study the catalytic mechanism and electrochemical reversibility. It is found that an appropriate V-o concentration can boost O-2 adsorption/desorption, accelerate electron transport, and reduce the reaction energy barrier. Vo-rich Pr(6)O(11 )optimizes the reaction pathway by offering an intermediate Li2-xO2 (with metalloid conductivity) and adjusting Li2O2 into vertically staggered nanoflakes, effectively avoiding the suffocation of the catalytic surface and presenting excellent capacity, cycling stability, and rate performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000859343600001	36049121

This study reported a hierarchical lantern Ni-doped Co-MOF synthesized by simple stirring at room temperature, which further generated an efficient bifunctional Ni-doped CoP@carbon-nitrogen (Co-NiP@NC) water splitting electrocatalyst using a co-ordination confinement phosphating approach, and the Co-NiP nanoparticles (ca. 5 nm) were successfully embedded into the NC nanosheets. This catalyst shows excellent catalytic efficiency with 140 mV over -potential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Meanwhile, it can be used as an ideal catalyst for catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the overpotential of 280 mV under the same conditions. Thus, only a voltage of 1.67 V was required to realize the overall water splitting at the current of 10 mAmiddotcm-2 when the Co-NiP@NC catalyst could act as both electrodes. Additionally, the catalyst displays the excellent HER, OER, and over water splitting (OWS) sta-bilities after 24 h, and the potentials decrease are feeble 2.7%, 2.9%, and 1.7%.

However, it is still a challenge to in situ synthesize a-TMC-carbon nanocomposites at elevated temperature and figure out the exact advantages of the amorphous structure. Here, an amorphous iron-doped nickel phosphate-carbon hollow nanocomposite (a-NiFePO-C) has been simply prepared by coprecipitation of metal ions and phytic acid, followed by a controllable annealing process. The results show that a-NiFePO-C can achieve a low overpotential of 268 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and maintain 91.3% of the initial current density after a 9 h chronoamperometry test in a 1 M KOH solution with low mass loading of 0.1 mg/cm(2). The excellent performance of a-NiFePO-C is attributed to the low charge-transfer resistance, bulk self-reconstruction, and synergetic oxidation of the bimetallic sites during cyclic voltammetry (CV) activation, resulting in the formation of a highly OER-active Fe(III)Ni(oxy)hydroxide-carbon nanocomposite. Moreover, the rechargeable Zn-air batteries powered by the a-NiFePO-C + Pt/C electrode can present a lower charging voltage and superior cycle performance than that powered by a commercial RuO2 + Pt/C electrode.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2168-0485			WOS:000642355100012

Contrary to proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis, AEMWE requires further optimization of its cell design, particularly for the kinetically unfavourable oxygen evolution anode half-cell reaction (OER). In this work we optimize the commercial Fumatech fumion ionomer content in AEMWE anodes using nickel (Ni) nanoparticles (NP) synthesized by chemical reduction. The optimal ionomer content is then applied to Ni-iron (Fe)-based NPs with and without ceria (CeO2), all prepared using the same method. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of the resulting electrode surfaces, Particle-size Distribution (PSD) of the catalyst inks, and in-situ testing of the monometallic Ni NPs show that the best and most active catalytic layer is obtained using 15 wt% ionomer. AEMWE performance and short-term durability are evaluated in different concentrations of potassium hydroxide (KOH), where the Ni90Fe10 is the best performing Ni-based electrode showing 1.72 V at 0.8 A cm-2 in 1 M KOH after IR-correction, and a degradation rate of 3.3 mV h-1. The addition of ceria to the Ni-based catalysts shows more consistent mass transfer over time likely due to more efficient water transport and bubble release.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000708012900005

Here, as dual-functional catalysts, Co(2)FeO(4)nanosheet arrays having high electrocatalytic activities toward CO2RR and OER are developed. When the catalyst is applied to a complete OCO2S system driven by a triple junction GaInP2/GaAs/Ge photovoltaic cell, it shows a high photocurrent density of approximate to 13.1 mA cm(-2), corresponding to a remarkably high solar-to-CO efficiency of 15.5%. Density functional theory studies suggest that the Co sites in Co(2)FeO(4)are favorable to the formation of *COOH and *O intermediates and thus account for its efficient bifunctional activities. The results will facilitate future studies for designing highly effective electrocatalysts and devices for OCO2S.									67	8	0	0	3	0	67			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000540740300001

C. curvisetus was cultured with different amounts of dried G. lemaneiformis under controlled laboratory conditions. We measured the photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate and established the chlorophyll a fluorescence transient (OJIP) curve coupled with its specific parameters. We observed concentration-dependent and time-dependent relationships between dried G. lemaneiformis and inhibition of photosynthesis in C. curvisetus. Co-culture with dried G. lemaneiformis also resulted in a decrease in the light-saturated maximum photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate (P-max) in C. curvisetus, and a decrease in the OJIP curve along with its specific parameters; the maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m), the amount of active PSII reaction centers per excited cross section at t=0 and t=t(FM) (RC/CS0 and RC/CSm, respectively), the absorption flux per excited cross section at t=0 (ABS/CS0), and the efficiency with which a trapped exciton moves an electron into the electron transport chain (psi(0)). The dark respiration rate (R-d) increased in C. curvisetus co-cultured with dried G. lemaneiformis. The JIP-test and the oxygen evolution results indicated that dried G. lemaneiformis decreased the number of active reaction centers, blocked the electron transport chain, and damaged the oxygen-evolving complex of C. curvisetus. This result indicated that dried fragments of G. lemaneiformis could effectively inhibit photosynthesis of C. curvisetus, and thus, could serve as a functional product to control and mitigate C. curvisetus blooms.									4	1	0	0	4	0	5			0254-4059	1993-5005		WOS:000326628800002

Herein, we report in situ synthesized uniform Ru-doped FeCoP (FeCoRuP) nanoarrays as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for highly efficient overall water splitting. The introduction of Ru modifies the electronic interaction between cation active sites due to the electronegativity difference, which also introduces more active sites by creating lattice defects and distortion. Benefiting from the rich active sites and the strong electronic interaction, the optimized Ru-doped FeCoP exhibits excellent HER activities (45 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and OER activity (214 mV at 20 mA cm(-2)), together with excellent long-term durability (110 h) in alkaline media. An overall water splitting cell in which both anode and cathode are composed of the FeCoRuP catalyst exhibits an ultralow voltage of 1.47 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to the benchmark 20% Pt/C||IrO2 electrodes (1.68 V at 10 mA cm(-2)). The present work offers a simple but effective approach to promote the overall water splitting performance of transition metal phosphides by modulating the electronic structure of active sites.									11	2	0	0	0	0	12			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000598674500015

On stoichiometric FeO(111) monolayer-thick film, water undergoes reversible molecular adsorption. On stoichiometric FeO(111) monolayer-thick islands on Pt(111), water dissociates at coordination-unsaturated Fe(11) sites of the FeO(111)-Pt(111) interface to form OH following H2O + Fe-cus + FeO -> Fe-cus OwH + FeOH in which O-W means from H2O. Upon heating, H-2 evolution occurs above 500 K. On FeO(111) monolayer-thick films with oxygen vacancies, water dissociates and molecularly chemisorbs to form a mixed adsorbate layer of H(a), OH, and H2O(a) following both H2O + Fe-O-vacancy + FeO -> FeOWH + FeOH and H2O + 2 Fe-O-vacancy -> FeOwH + H(a)-Fe-O-vacancy Upon heating, besides the high-temperature H-2 evolution, additional H-2 desorption peaks appear simultaneously with the lowtemperature desorption features of adsorbed H2O(a), revealing novel low-temperature water splitting reactions. The formation of hydrated-proton surface species within a mixed adsorbate layer of H(a), OH, and H2O(a) on FeO(111) monolayer-thick films with oxygen vacancies is proposed to explain such novel low-temperature water splitting reactions. These results greatly enrich the surface chemistry of water on solid surfaces.									27	3	0	0	2	0	28			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000310482900032

This study showed that the calcination temperature should be maintained under 400 A degrees C to obtain a spinel copper - cobalt oxide structure without secondary oxide phases. The powder calcined at 250 A degrees C showed the highest current density at the oxygen evolution reaction. This was due mainly to the increased number of available active sites and the active surface area of the powders. Further systematic analyses of the electrochemical characteristics of Cu (x) Co3-x O-4 synthesized by using the fusion method were performed to assess it as potential anode material for use in alkaline-anion-exchange-membrane water electrolysis.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0374-4884	1976-8524		WOS:000385431400009

We estimate the mass density thresholds for the onset of nuclear reactions in the cores of massive WDs and study the impact of microscopic stability on the structure and stability of different WD constitutions. We focus on the properties of massive carbon and oxygen white dwarfs, taking into account the electron capture and pycnonuclear fusion reactions instabilities. Our results indicate that pycnonuclear reactions turn carbon WDs unstable while for oxygen WDs their instability is due to the inverse beta -decay (electron capture) process. We highlight that these dynamical nuclear processes are of great relevance for assessment of stability of these quantum complex systems of massive WDs, since they constrain their maximum masses.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0103-9733	1678-4448		WOS:000604190300001

Herein, we propose a facile surface nitridation stretgy for nickel-cobalt alloy (Ni2Co-N) nanocactoids grown on carbon cloth in substantially raising the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. Indeed, Ni2Co-N exhibits an ultralow OER overpotential of 214 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, together with a small Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1), which not only breaks the cap of theoretical overpotential limit, but also is remarkably lower than those of the state-of-the-art 3d transition metal alloys and their derivatives. A nearly 100 % Faraday efficiency with a low and stable cell voltage of 1.59 V is achieved by an alkaline water electrolyzer made of the bifunctional Ni2Co-N as both the anode and cathode catalysts. The chemical and structural origin of the high catalytic activity is established to root from the fast surface reconstruction of Ni2Co alloy precatalyst, peroxo O-2(2-) species-induced lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism, acceleration in electron transfer, as well as the large active surface area as a result of the surface nitridation. The present study provides a guideline to rationally design active and stable 3d transition metal catalysts towards water oxidation and splitting.									68	6	0	0	4	0	68			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000526110500044

A correlated microscopy approach, using scanning electron microscopy and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy, was used to study the local morphology and electrocatalytic activity of the nickel (oxy)hydroxide materials gradient. It was found that bipolar electrodeposition led to the formation of discrete nickel (oxy)hydroxide particles, while energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and local electrochemical surface area measurements showed that the amount of nickel on the surface increased with increasing deposition overpotential. An apparent turnover frequency was calculated for the oxygen evolution reaction as a function of electrode position enabling local electrocatalytic activity to be quantified. This new approach, combining bipolar electrochemistry with local electrochemical measurements, enables the screening of electrocatalytic materials gradients generated across the surface of heterogeneous bipolar electrode substrates.

Current strategies typically involve substitutions of alkyl halides with toxic cyanides or the use of strong oxidation reagents (oxygen or peroxide) under ammoxidation/oxidation conditions, setting considerable challenges in energy efficiency, sustainability, and production safety. Herein, we demonstrate a facile, green, and safe electrocatalytic route for selective oxidation of amines to nitriles under ambient conditions, assisted by the anodic water oxidation on metal-doped alpha-Ni(OH)(2) (a typical oxygen evolution reaction catalyst). By controlling the balance between co-adsorption of the amine molecule and hydroxyls on the catalyst surface, we demonstrate that Mn doping significantly promotes the subsequent chemical oxidation of amines, resulting in Faradaic efficiencies of 96% for nitriles under >= 99% conversion. This anodic oxidation is further coupled with cathodic hydrogen evolution for overall atomic economy and additional green energy production.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000848085600001	35948416

Zn- air batteries are one of the most promising candidates owing to abundant and inexpensive resources used, decent energy density, and the high reduction potential of Zn. The most significant challenge of primary and rechargeable aqueous Zn- air batteries is the relatively high overpotential due to the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reactions on the air cathode. Highly efficient oxygen catalysts derived from metal- organic framework ( MOF) precursors have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for facilitating the oxygen reactions. In this contribution, we review the recent progress in state- of- the- art MOF- derived materials for use as oxygen catalysts in primary and rechargeable Zn- air batteries. We first summarize the development of several important MOF derivatives, including transition metal- nitrogen- carbon ( TM N C) composites, carbon- based transition metal compounds, and metal- free carbons. The advantages and disadvantages of these MOF- derived catalysts are also discussed. Strategies for optimization of the gas- liquid diffusion and the long- range electronic transportation on the air cathode with these MOF- derived catalysts are also demonstrated. Finally, the main challenges and some perspectives for developing advanced MOF- derived catalysts applied in Zn- air batteries are provided.									86	4	0	0	1	0	87				2566-6223		WOS:000477087800002

Herein, seven kinds of aromatic molecules with designated single N species are used as model structures to investigate the explicit role of each common N group in both ORR and OER. Specifically, dynamic evolution of active sites and key adsorbed intermediate products including O-2 (ads), superoxide anion O-2(-)*, and OOH* are monitored with in situ spectroscopy. We propose that the formation of *OOH species from O-2(-)* (O-2(-)*+H2O -> OOH*+OH-) is a possible RDS during the ORR process, whereas the generation of O-2 from OOH* species is the most likely RDS during the OER process.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000596779800001	33151593

N-doped porous nanostructured carbon material with excellent permanent porosity and high surface area is produced through pyrolysis of Zn-MOF in inert atmosphere that further utilized as a support for the preparation of three bimetallic composites Pt-Ni@PCN920, Pt-Cu@PCN920 and Pt-Er@ PCN920. It is found that Pt-Ni@PCN920 with less than 10% Pt showed the same over potential (-42 mV) for HER as that of commercial 20%Pt/C at a current density 10 mAcm(-2) in basic solution. The performance of Pt-Ni@ PCN920 in terms of stability and efficiency is good and comparable with commercial 20%Pt/C for HER and with RuO2 for OER. The best of three has been analyzed for long term stability and durability which is stable up to nine hours with little variation of current. The active sites developed by N-doping in nanostructured carbon material along with alloying effect of second metal with Pt produced good results for HER and OER with less than 10% Pt.									52	3	0	0	4	0	52			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000449447800005

In this regard, compared to traditional three-dimensional materials, graphene-like two-dimensional materials offer many advantages such as ultra-high surface area for photochemical reactions and minimal migration distance for carriers. Herein, using density functional theory (DFT), we examine the potential of a new series of two-dimensional boron chalcogenides, B2X3 (X = S, Se, Te) as candidates for such photocatalysts. We show that B2Se3 and B2Te3 possess the ideal energy levels for photon excitation for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

The polyvinylpyrrolidone/transition metal acetates/N-N-dimethylformamide precursors are first woven into networks by electrospinning. The resultant precursor networks are transformed into the three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous material consisting of cross-linked and meso/macroporous CNSs (i.e., FeCo@NCNS) after pyrolysis. Characterization results prove that abundant ultrafine FeCo@NC units, N-C bonds, metal-nitrogen doped carbon (M-N-C) species and oxygen-containing functional groups disperse along the surfaces of the FeCo@NCNS, which act as electrocatalytic active sites for Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and Oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Due to the synergistic effect of the hierarchically porous structures and high-density active sites, the optimal FeCo@NCNS exhibits more positive onset potential (0.98 V relative to a reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE)) and half-wave potential (0.827 V vs. RHE) than Pt/C (0.97 V vs. RHE and 0.819 vs. RHE) for ORR. Meanwhile, the OER potential at 10 mA cm(-2) of the FeCo@NCNS (1.597 V vs. RHE) is more negative than RuO2 (1.631). Furthermore, the oxygen electrode activity (Delta E = E-10,E-OER E-1/2,E-ORR) of the FeCo@NCNS is as low as 0.772 V, which surpasses the state-of-the-art Pt/C(ORR)-RuO2(OER) catalyst combination (Delta E = 0.812 V). Experimental results prove that the FeCo@NCNS is among the best non-precious metal based bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a Schottky heterojunction nanosheet array composed of dispersed NiFe hydroxide nanoparticles and ultrathin NiS nanosheets (NiFe LDH/NiS) is proposed to regulate cooperatively mass transport and electronic structure for triggering oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity at high current. In catalytic systems, the rich porosity of the NiS nanosheet array contributes abundant catalytic sites and good infiltration of the electrolyte for fast mass transfer. Furthermore, theoretical calculations reveal the coupling of NiFe LDH onto the NiS could tune the d-band center of Ni(Fe) atoms and the binding strength of oxygen intermediates for favorable OER kinetics. Therefore, the NiFe LDH/NiS Schottky heterojunction exhibits a remarkable OER activity, delivering a current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) at the ultralow overpotential of 325 mV. Meanwhile, scaled-up NiFe LDH/NiS electrodes are implemented in an industrial water splitting electrolyzer and exhibit a stable cell voltage of 2.01 V to deliver a constant catalytic current of 8000 mA over 80 h, saving 0.215 kWh of electricity to generate more hydrogen per cubic meter than commercial Raney Ni electrodes.									26	1	0	0	1	0	27			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000710304800001

A foamlike architecture (Co-foam) is first generated from thermally treated sugar in the presence of Co as a catalyst. Co embedded in C (Co/C) is obtained by following a pyrolysis process. The material properties are extensively characterized and indicate a well dispersion of Co species (metallic and nanoparticles) in the C matrix. The developed material is successfully applied as a potential electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The optimized synthesis conditions for the electrocatalyst, Co/C-400, provide the best catalytic OER performance, with the lowest overpotential of 310 mV (10 mA.cm(-2)) after normalization using the electrochemically active area and a Tafel slope of 73 mV.dec(-1). The high content of metallic Co nanoparticles as active sites, well-dispersed in a C matrix, efficiently promotes reactivity. Compared with the reference material (IrO2), this developed material demonstrated a high electrocatalytic performance. It is promising because it exists out of nonprecious and abundant precursors. The facile fabrication method is also environmentally friendly because no additives are applied and no toxic and hazardous formations are generated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2574-0970		WOS:000818341000001

Herein, by means of swarm-intelligence structure search and density functional theory (DFT) computations, we proposed a novel kind of two-dimensional (2D) monolayer with hypercoordinate structure as electrocatalysts for ORR/OER, namely, transition dinitride (TMN2, TM = V, Co, Rh, Pd, W, Re, and Ir) monolayer. Our result revealed that these TMN2 monolayers have excellent thermal, dynamic and chemical stability, as well as inherent metallic nature for their practical applications in electrocatalysis. More interestingly, among all 2D TMN2 materials, the IrN2 monolayer was suggested to perform as an ideal bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR/OER with a low overpotential of 0.47 and 0.27 V, respectively, which is comparable to Pt and Ir- or Ru-based oxides. Furthermore, by examining the d-band centers of the active sites in different TMN2 monolayers, we well rationalized the superior catalytic activity of IrN2 monolayer for ORR/OER. Our findings not only further enrich 2D nanomaterials with hypercoordinate structure, but also open a new door to develop bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts with high efficiency.

It was shown that low concentrations chlorocholine chloride (0.02 g/l) affected insignificantly the photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence. The growth of the culture in the presence of higher chlorocholine chloride concentrations (0.2 and 2 g/l) led to a significant reduction in the rate of oxygen production, and photoinduced changes in chlorophyll fluorescence yield.

Herein, a simple modified hydrothermally (MHT) synthesized zinc and cobalt based hydroxyl double salt, that is, Zn4-xCoxSO4(OH)(6)center dot 0.5H(2)O (ZCS), has been exfoliated for the first time as an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. Morphology investigation suggests the evolution of unique hexagonal nanoplates of ZCS material. As OER catalyst, it requires only 370 and 450 mV overpotential to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) current density, respectively. More importantly, performance at the overpotential over 400 mV and durability of the designed material have been found to be superior to those of commercial RuO2 catalyst. In the designed ZCS material trace amounts of cobalt species lead to higher mass activity of 146 A g(-1), compared to that of the RuO2 catalyst (83 A g(-1)) at the same overpotential of 370 mV. The outstanding activity and stability of the cost-effective material emerges from the promotional effect of Zn ions, which are present as the principal constituent in the electrocatalyst, and they also protect the cobalt ions in the matrix during its long-term electrochemical test. It is important to note that an appropriate ratio of zinc and cobalt ions synergistically helps to create an economically viable and environmentally suitable electrocatalyst in comparison to other related transition metal based materials.									47	4	0	0	0	0	47			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000396186000030	28211670

The evolution of exceptionally active and durable non-noble-metal-based OER electrocatalyst as a prerequisite for practical applications is significant. In this paper, we report a facile one-pot hydrothermal method for synthesizing a porous Fe0.67Ni0.33OOH-Fe2O3@NF sheet-like nanoarray as an OER electrocatalyst. As expected, this Fe0.67Ni0.33OOH-Fe2O3@NF electrocatalyst exhibits desirable OER performance with low overpotential (232 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) current density, 34 mV dec(-1) Tafel slope, impressive durability over 1000 CV cycles, and 110 h continuous i-t response at 30 mA cm(-2) current density. These values exceed those observed from most reported non-/noble-metal-based OER electrocatalysts to date, and these observations are consistent with exposure of numerous intrinsically active sites, synergistic modulation of charge transfer, and intense interactions between Fe, Ni, and O, as well as increased mass transfer based on separation of bubbles generated on the integrated electrode surface. These results illustrate the potential for this strategy to provide a low-cost, highly-active OER electrocatalyst as a kind of renewable energy storage devices, such as metal-air battery and water oxidation.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000502007800068

The Pt layer of the catalyst was physically sputtered onto a TiOx-coated Si substrate (this TiOx layer was sputtered inbetween the Si substrate and Pt layer to improve their adhesion and prevent their mutual diffusion). On top of the Pt layer, another thin TiOx layer (similar to 60 nm) was spun before the electrochemical deposition of MnOx. The investigation focused primarily to evaluate the impact of the catalysts annealing in oxygen atmosphere on its catalytic activity toward OER. Interestingly, before the modification with MnOx, a large catalytic enhancement both in activity (similar to 228 mV negative shift at 20 mA cm(-2) if compared to conventional bare Pt catalysts) and stability was achieved at the catalyst annealed at 600 degrees C toward OER in 0.5 M KOH. Surprisingly, the addition of MnOx to the catalyst synergized a boosted activity amplifying the negative shift to 470 mV at the same current density. Bunch of materials and electrochemical techniques were combined to reveal important remarks about the catalysts morphology, structure, composition and intrinsic activity which was attributed to electronic rather than geometric factors.

First, Ni2+ is substituted for K+ in K-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) to prepare the binary metal ion precursor of Ni-3[Co(CN)(6)](2). Afterward, coating Co(OH)(2) on the surface of Ni-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) could not only maintain the cubic structure of Prussian blue analogue but also build a composite interface between two phases. After the Ni-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)/Co(OH)(2) precursor is sulfided, a porous NiCoSx/CoS2 composite catalyst material with a cubic structure is obtained. NiCoSx/CoS2 catalysts showed excellent oxygen evolution reactions and oxygen reduction reactions. The overpotential was only 310 mV to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and the half-wave potential can reach 0.80 V. During the exploration of the hydrogen evolution reaction, the catalyst exhibited 253 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2). When this catalyst was used in Zn-air batteries as the cathode, it showed excellent cycle stability (210 h) and small voltage gap (0.80 V) at 5 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, soft-pack flexible batteries assembled with NiCoSx/CoS2 can be charged and discharged stably at any bending angle.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1466-8033		WOS:000793305700001

Perovskite oxides involving lattice-oxygen oxidation are generally regarded as highly active OER catalysts, but the deprotonation of surface-bound intermediates limit the further activity improvement. Here, it is shown that this kinetic limitation can be removed by introducing Sr3B2O6 (SB) which activates a proton-acceptor functionality to boost OER activity. As a proof-of-concept example, an experimental validation is conducted on the extraordinary OER performance of a Sr(Co0.8Fe0.2)(0.7)B0.3O3-delta (SCFB-0.3) hybrid catalyst, made using Sr0.8Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta as active component and SB as a proton acceptor. This smart hybrid exhibits an exceptionally ultrahigh OER activity with an extremely low overpotential of 340 mV in 0.1 m KOH and 240 mV in 1 m KOH required for 10 mA cm(-2) which is the top-level catalytic activity among metal oxides reported so far, while maintaining excellent durability. The correlation of pH and activity study reveals that this enhanced activity mainly originates from the improved interfacial proton transfer. Such a strategy further demonstrated to be universal, which can be applied to enhance the OER activity of other high covalent oxides with close O 2p-band centers relative to Fermi energy.									65	3	0	0	2	0	65			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000468796000010

Here, we report a new Ru-modified cobalt-based electrocatalyst embedded in a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) matrix with rationally designed Mott-Schottky heterostructure to realize high activity and stability toward overall water splitting in a strongly acidic environment. Such a composite was facilely prepared by carbonization of cobalt-based MOF, followed by galvanic exchange between cobalt and Ru, and then controlled partial oxidation. The partial oxidation of 15 RuCo implanted inside the NC matrix led to the formation of a class of RuO2/Co3O4-RuCo@NC composites with rich metal-semiconductor interfaces to facilitate the charge-transfer process. As a result, the composite displayed remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward both oxygen/hydrogen evolutions in acidic media. Significantly, they also afforded low overpotentials of 247 and 141 mV for OER and HER, respectively, and a cell voltage of 1.66 V for overall water splitting at 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, excellent operation stability in 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions, comparable to those of them working in alkaline conditions, is demonstrated due to the protection of a coated carbon thin film. The presented work opens a new opportunity toward designing bifunctional electrocatalysts for acidic water electrolysis.									43	2	0	0	2	0	43			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000505626900023	31738508

Herein, ultrafine Co0.85Se nanoparticles encapsulated into carbon nanofibers (CNFs), Co0.85Se@CNFs, is reported as an integrated bifunctional catalyst for OER and ORR. This catalyst exhibits a low OER potential of 1.58V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) (E-J=10,E-OER) to achieve a current density (J) of 10mAcm(-2) and a high ORR potential of 0.84V vs. RHE (E-J=-1,E-ORR) to reach -1mAcm(-2). Thus, the potential between E-J=10,E-OER and E-J=-1,E-ORR is only 0.74V, indicating considerable bifunctional activity. The excellent bifunctionality can be attributed to high electronic conduction, abundant electrochemically active sites, and the synergistic effect of Co0.85Se and CNFs. Furthermore, this Co0.85Se@CNFs catalyst displays good cycling stability for both OER and ORR. This study paves a new way for the rational design of hybrid catalysts composed of transition-metal selenides and carbon materials for efficiently catalyzing OER and ORR.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000496289800001	31621137

Among these, the water splitting process has been considered a promising hydrogen production method, particularly, in alkaline media. The lack of information on the reaction active sites under the conditions of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) hinders establishing guidelines for catalyst development. In the case of powder catalysts, many operando techniques also measure bulk information, and therefore, extracting information on the reaction active sites is challenging. Accordingly, film electrodes were used in this study, and the electrochemical performance and reaction kinetics of perovskite-type La1-xSrxCoO3-delta films as OER catalysts synthesized by pulsed laser deposition were investigated. By combining ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and operando total-reflection fluorescence X-ray absorption spectroscopy (TRF-XAS), we succeeded in observing a significant oxidation state change on the surface of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta, which indicated that the active surface sites were formed upon applying the OER potential. This surface reconstruction resulted in numerous active sites at the reaction interface, thereby enhancing the OER activity. This study provides definitive evidence for the surface reconstruction of OER catalysts, which enhances the fundamental understanding of OER catalyst behaviors, and can inspire the design of active OER catalysts by suitable surface modulation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000813048200001

For electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, these analyses are usually performed considering only the thermodynamics of the reaction path, which typically consists of adsorbed OH*, O*, and OOH*. Scaling relationships between the stability of these intermediates lead to a limiting potential volcano whose optimum is constrained by the roughly constant offset between the binding energies of OH* and OOH*. In this work, we evaluate OER kinetics at rutile IrO2, RuO2, RhO2 , and PtO2 surfaces by computing reaction barriers with an explicit model of the electrochemical interface. We conclude that the kinetics of proton transfer between oxygen atoms at the surface and in the electrolyte is facile and that O-O bond formation is most likely rate-determining in all cases. Combining these results with a microkinetic model and a scaling relationship for the OOH* formation barrier, we construct a new activity volcano whose optimum is similar to that of the limiting potential volcano for typical current densities. This kinetic volcano is also shown to agree reasonably well with experimental observations. Based on this analysis, we propose a more precise requirement for improving OER catalysts beyond the state of the art: the transition state for OOH* formation must be stabilized as opposed to the fully formed OOH* final state as has been previously presumed.									83	0	0	0	5	0	83			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000480502300022

Precious iridium-based oxides are still the only oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with reasonable activity and stability in acid. Herein, we design iridium-tungsten composites with a metallic tungsten-rich core and an iridium-rich surface by the sol-gel method followed by hydrogen reduction. The thus obtained iridium-tungsten catalyst shows much higher intrinsic water oxidation activity (100 mA/mg(Ir) at an overpotential of 290 mV) and stability (100 h at 10 mA/cm(geom)(2)) together with reduced iridium content (33 wt % only) as compared with pure iridium oxide. An operando method using H2O2 as a probe molecule is developed to determine the relative adsorption strength of the reaction intermediates (*OH and *OOH) in the OER process. Detailed characterization shows that the tungsten-incorporated surface not only modulates the adsorption energy of oxygen intermediates on iridium but also enhances the stability of iridium species in acid, while the metallic tungsten core exhibits high electrical conductivity, all of which collectively give rise to the much enhanced catalytic performance of iridium-tungsten composite in acidic water oxidation. A single-membrane electrode assembly is further prepared to demonstrate the advantages and potential application of iridium-tungsten composite in practical proton exchange membrane electrolyzers.									15	1	0	0	1	0	16			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000541679900048	32428393

In this study, the first-principles method is applied to investigate the active sites of low-cost Ni metal-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), which is a promising alternative to expensive Pt metal-based catalysts. The adsorption of hydrogen on different sites of pristine and partially oxidized Ni(111) surface is investigated. All of the possible configurations have been systematically investigated here with the consideration of their Boltzmann distribution. Using the Gibbs free energy of intermediate H atoms (Delta G(H)*) as a descriptor, it is found that the AG,. increases with the increase of the coverage of oxygen atoms. The slightly oxidized surface Ni atoms are theoretically identified to be the best catalytic centers for the electrocatalytic HERS when the coverage of oxygen is considerably low. On the basis of the analyses of Bader charge distribution and density of states, our results reveal that the superior performance of the slightly oxidized surface Ni atoms can be ascribed to the optimal electronic properties.									24	1	0	0	0	0	24			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000451496000025	30362712

Nevertheless, one of the major bottlenecks lies in the fabrication of bifunctional catalysts with high electrochemical activity, high stability, low cost, and free of precious and rare metals. Herein, a high-performance metal-free bifunctional catalyst is synthesized in a single step by regulating radicals within the recently invented high-flux plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (HPECVD) system equipped with in situ plasma diagnostics. Thus-derived (N, O)-doped vertical few-layer graphene film (VGNO) is of high areal population with perfect vertical orientation, tunable catalytic states, and configurations, thus enabling significantly enhanced electrochemical kinetic processes of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with reference to milestone achievements to date. Application of such VGNO to aqueous ZABs (A-ZABs) and flexible solid-state ZABs (S-ZABs) exhibited high discharge power density and excellent cycling stability, which remarkably outperformed ZABs using benchmarked precious-metal based catalysts. The current work provides a solid basis toward developing low-cost, resource-sustainable, and eco-friendly ZABs without using any metals for outstanding OER and ORR catalysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2198-3844		WOS:000764962200001	35246956

Herein, 5d transition metal oxide WO2 and WO3 (denoted as WOx) nanoparticles are purposely integrated with a porous Ni nanosheet array grown on nickel foam (NF) to design a strongly coupled Ni/WOx/NF porous nanosheet array electrocatalyst. Through the anion exchange of Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets with tungstate, followed by hydrogenation treatment, abundant Ni(OH)(2) interfaces with strong coupling interaction are generated. Benefiting from the strong synergies between Ni and WOx and the unique nanostructure, Ni/O-x/NF only requires the overpotentials of 42 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 395.7 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to achieve the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, the Ni/WOx/NF can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.54 V in a two-electrode system. This work opens a novel avenue for the design of high-performance but low-cost electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000661306200061	34034489

Our strategy is straightforward, efficient, green, and easy to be scaled up. After wrapping pure CNTs with a certain class of electrochemically inert polymers (i.e. poly(ethylene-alt-maleic acid), poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(vinyl acetate), poly(ethylene glycol)) with polar oxygen-containing groups (i.e. -COOH, -OH, -COOCH3, -O-) through noncovalent interactions, a series of advanced metal-free composite membrane catalysts were easily achieved, which yielded unexpected, surprisingly high OER activity -on par with the commercial noble RuO2 catalyst, though pure CNTs have rather poor OER activity. Combined experimental and computational studies revealed that the observed superb OER activity could be attributed to a synergistic effect of intrinsic topological defects in the CNTs as active centers and the coated polymer layer as a co-catalyst to optimize the adsorption energies of intermediates for improving the OER energetics.									83	10	0	0	4	0	84			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000414774500003

Sulfur evolution from coal causes great harm to CLC system. In this research, combined CoFe2O4 oxygen carrier (OC) was synthesized and its reaction with a typical Chinese high sulfur coal as Liuzhi (LZ) coal was investigated with the research focus on the sulfur evolution from LZ coal during its reaction with CoFe2O4 OC. Analysis of LZ coal reaction with CoFe2O4 OC through thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA)-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) indicated that CoFe2O4 owned the desired reaction superiority over its reference oxide CoO or Fe2O3, and SO2 produced was mainly related to oxidization of H2S with CoFe2O4. Field emission scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (FESEM-EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the solid product from LZ coal reaction with CoFe2O4 indicated that CoFe2O4 were mainly reduced to Fe3O4 and Co, as verified by the related thermodynamic simulation. But most of sulfur present in 12 coal was converted to solid CO3S4 during LZ coal reaction with CoFe2O4. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of various carbon functional groups distributed in the solid product of LZ reaction with CoFe2O4 revealed that C-C or C-H functional group was the lowest reactive to limit the full conversion of LZ coal on the atomic scale. Finally, such sulfides as CoS and CO3S4 and various silicates, including Co2SIO4 and Fe2SiO4, should be well addressed and separated during reaction of LZ with CoFe2O4 to ensure the full regeneration of the reduced CoFe2O4.

To address this issue, synergistic hybrid catalysts are always designed by coupling them with metal (hydro)oxides. However, such hybrid systems usually suffer from long reaction path, high cost and complex preparation methods. Here, we discover a single-phase HER catalyst, SrTi0.7Ru0.3O3-delta (STRO) perovskite oxide highlighted with an unusual super-exchange effect, which exhibits excellent HER performance in alkaline media via atomic-scale synergistic active centers. With insights from first-principles calculations, the intrinsically synergistic interplays between multiple active centers in STRO are uncovered to accurately catalyze different elementary steps of alkaline HER; namely, the Ti sites facilitates nearly-barrierless water dissociation, Ru sites function favorably for OH* desorption, and non-metal oxygen sites (i.e., oxygen vacancies/lattice oxygen) promotes optimal H* adsorption and H-2 desorption. Efficient electrocatalysts are crucial for the sustainable hydrogen production as an alternative clean fuel. Here, the authors explore a single-phase perovskite oxide as a high-performance hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst via super-exchange induced atomic scale synergistic active sites.									60	1	0	0	5	0	59			2041-1723			WOS:000590821000003	33168812

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image showed that the active IrO2 layer was dispersed more uniformly at PEDOT intermediate layer than at bare ITO substrate. Voltammetric measurements indicated that the as-prepared IrO2 colloids are very active for both the oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and for reversible valance transition between lower and higher oxides. ITO/PEDOT/IrO2 electrodes perform enhanced electrochemical activity towards the oxidation of morphine, as compared with the un-modified ITO-based PEDOT electrodes (ITO/PEDOT) or the ITO electrodes directly coated with IrO2 (ITO/IrO2), suggesting that the composite electrode materials are one of the potential candidates for morphine detection.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000280596800015

Herein, we developed a facile self-assembly strategy for the one-step fabrication of core-shell Co2P nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen and phosphorus codoped porous carbon (Co2P@NPPC) via in situ carbonization and phosphorization. Due to the collaborative effect between NPPC and Co2P, the obtained Co2P@NPPC hybrid revealed robust electrocatalytic performance toward the HER and OER. Impressively, it exhibited a lower overpotential of 147 mV for HER and 316 mV for OER to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Remarkably, it only required a low cell voltage of 1.65 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with long-time reliable stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the introduction of phosphorus into cobalt can weaken the H-adsorption free energy and increase the electronic states of Co2P.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000637414200001

In this work, we address the usage of an implicit solvation model for describing hydrogen evolution reaction steps on Pt(111) and Pt(110) and compare with the "extrapolation" approach as well as single-crystal measurements. We find that both methods yield qualitatively similar results, which are in fair agreement with the experimental data. Care should be taken, however, in addressing spurious electrostatic interactions between periodically repeated slabs in the VASPsol implementation. Considering the lower computational cost and higher flexibility of the implicit solvation approach, we expect this method to become a valuable tool in electrocatalysis.									48	0	0	0	4	0	48			1932-7447			WOS:000459836900023

A model for the cytochrome structure that satisfies the cis-positive rule for membrane protein assembly consists of two short, non-identical hydrophobic membrane-spanning polypeptides (alpha and beta), each containing a single histidine residue, as ligands for the bridging heme prosthetic group that is on the side of the membrane opposite to the water splitting apparatus. The ability of the heterodimer, but not the single a-subunit, to satisfy the cis-positive rule implies that the cytochrome inserts into the membrane as a heterodimer, with some evidence implicating it as the first membrane-inserted unit of the assembling reaction center. The very positive redox potential of the cytochrome can be explained by a position for the heme in a hydrophobic niche near the stromal aqueous interface where it is also influenced by the large positive dipole potential of the parallel a-helices of the cytochrome. The requirement for the cytochrome in oxygenic photosynthesis may be a consequence of the presence of the strongly oxidizing reaction center needed for H2O-splitting. This may lead to the need, under conditions of stress or plastid development, for an alternate source of electrons when the H2O-splitting system is not operative as a source of reductant for the reaction center.									36	4	0	0	32	0	39			0031-9317	1399-3054		WOS:A1993LW02900025	28741778

We attempt "area-step" cyclic voltammetry to continuously measure the local electrocatalytic activity of the gradient alloys, by serially increasing the contact area between the electrolyte and the gradient surface. The local surface roughness can also be characterized using the same procedure. The parallel experiments consistently point to the same position where presents the highest intrinsic OER activity. Both the Fe content in the alloys and the surface roughness play important roles in the OER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-0216			WOS:000501380700009

Until now, a critical scientific challenge facing Li-O-2 battery is the high charge overpotential due to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the oxygen electrode, which results in low energy efficiency and poor cyclability. Here, we demonstrated that nitrogen-doped single layer graphene shell encapsulating non-precious metal Co can be used as a highly efficient catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. The catalyst showed significantly enhanced OER catalytic activity, with a charge overpotential of 0.58 V, which was remarkably lower compared with the corresponding N-free graphene encapsulating metal, metal oxide and metal-free carbon materials. DFT calculations revealed that the nitrogen dopants and enclosed metal clusters can synergistically modulate the electronic properties of the graphene surface, resulting in a dramatic reduction of the overpotentials. This study provides the possibility of the rational non-precious metal electrocatalysts designing for Li-O-2 batteries.

Herein, we created a porous iron phosphide and tungsten oxide self-supporting electrocatalyst with oxygen-containing vacancies on foam nickel (Fe2P-WO2.92/NF) through a facile insitu growth, etching and phosphating strategies. The sequence-controllable strategy will not only generate oxygen vacancies and improve the charge transfer between Fe2P and WO2.92 components, but also improve the catalyst porosity and expose more active sites. Electrochemical studies illustrate that the Fe2P-WO2.92/NF catalyst presents good OER activity with a low overpotential of 267 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 46.3 mV dec(-1), high electrical conductivity, and reliable stability at high current density (100 mA cm(-2) for over 60 h in 1.0 M KOH solution). Most significantly, the operating cell voltage of Fe2P-WO2.92/NF parallel to Pt/C is as low as 1.90 V at 400 mA cm(-2) in alkaline condition, which is one of the lowest reported in the literature. The electrocatalytic mechanism shows that the oxygen vacancies and the synergy between Fe2P and WO2.92 can adjust the electronic structure and provide more reaction sites, thereby synergistically increasing OER activity. This work provides a feasible strategy to fabricate high-efficiency and stable non-noble metal OER electrocatalysts on the engineering interface.

Flexible zinc-air batteries (ZABs) with high bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity and superb flexible can be employed as promising power supplies to fulfill these novel electronic devices. Considering the major challenges to the flexible ZABs such as low power density, poor energy efficiency and unsatisfactory mechanical stability, we propose a novel plasma-assistance strategy to prepare highly foldable self-supporting air-electrodes based on nitrogen-doped carbon layer encapsulated Co and FeCo nanoparticles hybrid nanowire arrays (Co-FeCo/N-G). The obtained Co-FeCo/N-G air-electrode show superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Thus, the flexible ZABs using Co-FeCo/N-G air-electrode achieve a high open circuit voltage of 1.419 V. Furthermore, it exhibits an outstanding peak power density of 82 mW cm(-2), a small discharge-charge voltage gap of 0.61 V at 1 mA cm(-2) and long-term durability. Specially, the flexible Co-FeCo/N-G ZAB displays excellent mechanical stability under large deformation conditions, which can be folded into 180 degrees without obvious decay of its performance. Thereby, our work offers a unique insight into design of highly flexible air electrodes with favorable electrocatalytic activity for emerging wearable and portable electronics.									60	4	0	0	0	0	60			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000483451200084

However, it is still a great challenge to illustrate their inherent catalytic mechanism for the "cocktail effect", and there is also a paucity of quantitative descriptors to characterize the specific catalytic activity and give logical design strategies for HE systems. Herein, the unexpected activation of all metal sites in HE Cu-Co-Fe-Ag-Mo (oxy)hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is reported, and it is found that metal-oxygen d-p hybridization, as an effective descriptor, can indicate the intrinsic activity of each metal site. According to the quantitative hybridization, introducing an electron donor (e.g., Ag) is raised and verified to reinforce the electrocatalytic activity of the HE system. Consequently, Ag-decorated Co-Cu-Fe-Ag-Mo (oxy)hydroxide (Ag@CoCuFeAgMoOOH) electrocatalysts are constructed by an electrochemical reconstruction method, and their OER performances are thoroughly characterized. The Ag@CoCuFeAgMoOOH is verified with a low overpotential (270 mV at 100 mA cm(-2)) and a small Tafel slope (35.3 mV dec(-1)), as well as good electrochemical stability. The favorable activity of the electron donor and underlying synergistic "cocktail effect" are demonstrated and disclosed.

In this paper, a novel one-dimensional cobalt nanoparticles embedded nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes nanocomposite (Co-NC CNTs) was successfully prepared via a simple and inexpensive method to achieve the electrocatalyst containing Co nanoparticles with abundant reaction activated sites. The Co-NC CNTs directly function as a bifunctional and flexible catalyst with a remarkable electrochemical performance, including the relatively positive half-wave potential (0.82 V vs RHE) compared to the commercial platinum carbon (Pt/C) (0.84 V vs RHE) for ORR and the lower overpotential (0.46 V) compared to ruthenium oxide (RuO2) (0.4 V) for OER.

Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) prepared by the conventional co-precipitation method, with a less active site density and a poor electrical transport, are often used as precursors for further preparation of PBA derivatives, such as metal oxides, metal alloys, metal phosphides, and so on, due to their poor OER activity. In this report, controllable synthesis of NiFe PBA with Fe2O3 byproducts on a Ni foam substrate was achieved through a facile one-step hydrothermal reaction by adjusting the amount of urea and potassium ferricyanide. After chemical etching and electrochemical activation, NiFe PBA was entirely transformed into amorphous superhydrophilic NiFe PBA (denoted a-NiHCF), which exhibited a remarkable OER performance at a large current density. To drive high current densities of 400 and 800 mA cm(-2), only ultralow overpotentials of 280 and 309 mV were required, respectively, which far exceed many recently reported OER catalysts. The superior performance can be attributed to the following: (1) in situ growth on a metal foam substrate can improve the structural stability and provide a faster charge transfer as well as oxygen bubble release; (2) chemical etching allows exposing more surface active sites; (3) an electrochemical activation-induced amorphous surface possesses a larger Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, more high-valent oxidation states, and higher intrinsic OER activity; and (4) the superhydrophilic surface structure is conducive to the adsorption of water molecules. These advantages make a-NiHCF a promising candidate for application in the field of electrocatalytic water splitting.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2168-0485			WOS:000644738000022

However, it is challenging to simultaneously generate doping and defects, and insights into the structure-property relationship in vacancy-rich and doped catalysts are lacking. Herein, a V-doped NiCoP electrocatalyst is developed through utilizing the V-doping effect enhanced by P vacancies via plasma treatment. The P vacancies can enhance the V doping effect to increase the electroactive sites and regulate the electron density of the active site center. Thus, an enlarged electrochemical active area, accelerated electron transportation and promoted electronic coupling effects can be achieved. As a result, the overpotentials at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) are 58 and 246 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH, respectively. When serving as a bifunctional electrode for overall water splitting, V-doped NiCoP with P vacancies can achieve a low voltage of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This work highlights a feasible strategy to explore efficient electrocatalysts via the heterogeneous atom doping effect enhanced by vacancies.									127	8	0	0	4	0	126			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000494830400036

Perovskite-type LaMnO3 shows excellent ORR performance, but poor OER activity. To improve the OER performance of LaMnO3, the element cobalt is doped into perovskite-type LaMnO3 through a sol-gel method followed by a calcination process. To assess electrocatalytic activities for the ORR and OER, a series of LaMn1-xCoxO3 (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5) perovskite oxides were synthesized. The results indicate that the amount of doped cobalt has a significant effect on the catalytic performance of LaMn1-xCoxO3. If x=0.3, LaMn0.7Co0.3O3 not only shows a tolerable electrocatalytic activity for the ORR, but also exhibits a great improvement (>200mV) on the catalytic activity for the OER; this indicates that the doping of cobalt is an effective approach to improve the OER performance of LaMnO3. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that LaMn0.7Co0.3O3 is a promising cost-effective bifunctional catalyst with high performance in the ORR and OER for application in hybrid Li-O-2 batteries.									46	1	0	0	4	0	46			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000426497800011	29319240

J	Secours, C.; Essiembre, S.; Marsan, B.; Celis, J.-P.						Savadogo, O.		Electrodeposition of Ni and spinel oxide particles for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline medium								New Materials for Electrochemical Systems IV. Extended Abstracts of the Fourth International Symposium on New Materials for Electrochemical Systems								76	7						2001	2001	The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is involved in several processes (e.g., electrolysis of water, recharge of metal-air batteries, zinc electrowinning). This reaction is of special interest because high anodic activation overpotentials are associated with it. In the authors' laboratory, the spinel oxide CuxCo3-xO4 is investigated as an anode material for the OER. When prepared by thermal decomposition of nitrate precursors on a Ni substrate, this oxide shows fairly low overvoltages in alkaline solution. Furthermore, they have demonstrated that partial substitution of Cu2+ species by Li+ in the oxide lattice enhances significantly its electrocatalytic properties. In this work, the authors substitute Co3+ species by Mg2+. On the other hand, they investigate an alternative method to prepare thin oxide film-based anodes to decrease the electrode production cost. The method consists in the electrodeposition of Ni and small spinel oxide particles on a Ni-covered mild steel substrate using a rotating disk electrode (RDE). The objectives of this work are: (i) the chemical and physico-chemical characterization of MgyCuxCo3-x-yO4 powders (x=l; 0 < y : 0.8) prepared by the thermal decomposition method; and (ii) the preparation and the chemical, physico-chemical and electrochemical characterization of composite anodes based on Ni and the spinel oxide particles containing 0 and 10% Mg (y = 0 and 0.2).

Herein, we report that ultrathin cobalt-based coordination polymers (Co-CPs) plates are exceptional electrocatalysts for the OER as they show one of the most lowest Tafel slopes among the cobalt-based OER catalysts reported to date. It has been found that the Co-CPs can be transformed into Co(OH)(2) hexagonal nanoplates and then further oxidized into CoOOH, which acts as a catalytic active site for the oxidation of water. Interestingly, when Ca2+, an inactive ion, was introduced into the precursors, thinner CoOOH nanosheets with more exposed active sites were formed, which displayed significantly higher OER activity than the Co-CPs. Furthermore, the content of Ca2+ in the Co-based coordination polymers (CoxCay-CPs) and the corresponding OER activity of these CPs were systematically investigated, and Co0.89Ca0.11-CPs exhibited highest OER activity. This study provides a fundamental understanding of the catalytic mechanism of cobalt-based coordination polymer electrocatalysts and the effect of inactive species, such as Ca2+, on the OER in an alkaline electrolyte, which may promote the design of highly active electrocatalysts.									20	1	0	0	2	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000482139000019		
J	Lu Chunju; Li Zongquan								Solid-gas reactions during ball milling of titanium powder under different atmospheres								Journal of the Chinese Ceramic Society				35	12			1618	21, 1629						Dec. 2007	2007	The structural evolution of titanium powder by ball milling under two different conditions (closed vial and open vial) with solid-gas reactions was investigated. The experimental results show that at the initial stage of ball milling, many more nitrogen atoms are adsorbed by titanium than oxygen atoms and a titanium solid solution phase fcc-Ti(O,N)x with higher nitrogen is formed first. It is then transformed into a titanium oxynitride phase fcc-Ti(O,N)y with the same crystal structure as that of fcc-TiN. However, the efficiency in a closed vial is higher than that in an open vial, and much more nitrogen and/or oxygen is adsorbed by titanium in a closed vial. After milling for 90 h in a closed vial, a nano-crystalline fcc-Ti4(O0.2N0.8)3 is obtained. When titanium is ball milled for the same time in an open vial, fcc-Ti(O,N)x, fcc-Ti(O,N)y, and rutile-TiO2 coexist.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0454-5648			INSPEC:10120901		
J	Zeng, Liming; Cui, Xiangzhi; Zhang, Jimei; Huang, Weimin; Chen, Lisong; Wei, Chenyang; Shi, Jianlin								A facile strategy to construct CoOx in situ embedded nanoflowers as an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				275				218	224		10.1016/j.electacta.2018.04.125				JUN 10 2018	2018	With a growing demand for clean and renewable energy associated with water splitting, regenerative fuel cells, metal-air batteries, etc., exploring an efficient and cost-effective electrocatalyst with superior durability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance. In this study, a unique CoOx embedded nanoflower microstructure (Co-0.6-PyNa) has been synthesized via an extremely facile one-step, highly scalable aqueous method under mild conditions, by using Co(COOH) 2 as the precursor and pyrrole as the structure-directing agent. The Co-0.6-PyNa exhibits the excellent electrocatalytic activity toward OER in 1M KOH solution with an overpotential of as low as 299 mV and a small Tafel slope of 67 mV dec (1), which is comparable to the commercial RuO2, along with superior operational stability to RuO2. The high OER catalytic performance of Co-0.6-PyNa has been reasoned to originate from the exposure of abundant CoOx active species uniformly dispersed on the nanoflakes due to its high specific surface area and the intrinsic extraordinarily high activity of CoOx active species. This work provides a promising strategy to fabricate efficient, stable and low-cost OER electrocatalyst, which is expected to promote the development of OER-related energy storage and conversion technologies.

To replace noble metal based electrocatalysts, exploring new counterparts is critical for their large-scale and widespread deployment. In this paper, we report the synthesis of nickel-cobalt selenite (Ni0.5Co0.5SeO3) networks on nickel foam with promising electrocatalytic performance through a facile electrodeposition method. The networked structure built with interconnected nanosheets along with the three-dimensional backbone of nickel foam is able to provide a large surface area for the reaction to take place and simultaneously offer connected channels for charge carriers to pass through, consequently realizing the enhancement of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity. Importantly, the hierarchical channel structure affords vast spaces to buffer the volume change during repeated redox reactions and offers feasible channels for gas release, leading to good electrochemical stability. The best sample with an optimized composition shows superior catalytic activity with a high current density of 243.6 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 500 mV and excellent stability.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000459580000018	30720840

In this work, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of corn stalk was carried out at reaction severity levels of 5.05-8.29. The effect of reaction severity on the solid yield, the chemical, energetic, and structural properties of hydrochar products were studied in detail. The hydrochar yield varied from 71 to 36%. The higher heating value increased from 20.8 MJ/kg at reaction severity of 5.05 to the maximum value of 29.79 MJ/kg at severity of 8.29. When the reaction severity was greater than 7.11, the hydrochar exhibited coal-like oxygen/carbon and hydrogen/carbon atomic ratios. The evolution of microcrystalline structure for hydrochar was examined by XRD and the results showed that the component degradation led to develop hydrochar structure. The functional group results revealed that the high aromatization performance and carbonization extent of the hydrochar could be achieved with reaction severity increasing. The correlations between solid yield, carbon content, oxygen content, HHV, relative peak intensity ratios of the functional groups for hydrochar and reaction severity were fit with the experimental data. The results indicated that the dose-response models fit these characteristics data well, which would be favorable to understand and design the hydrothermal carbonization process for corn stalk.

Ambiguous evidence for the coexistence of W/Ti oxides and their binary feature were extensively studied by different analytical tools and also affirmed using high-resolution microscopy. The existence of multiple defects in the binary material and their 2.68 eV optical band gap was evaluated using the room-temperature photoluminescence data and Tauc's plot, respectively. Nature of conductivity in WO3-TiO2 and its flat band potential was inferred using Mott-Schottky type electro-chemical impedance spectroscopic results. The enhanced photosensitivity in WO3-TiO2 was demonstrated using a flip-chip Schottky diode architecture and reasoned to the improved charge transfer kinetics across the same. Next, the potential of WO3-TiO2 for stable water splitting functions was examined. Here, WO3-TiO2 interface was found to provide an enriched surface area for effective charge transfer, complementing towards the effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. The results demonstrated a smaller overpotential of 270 mV, authenticating the oxide system as an effective anode material for water splitting reactions with excellent stability.					5th International Conference on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICONN)5th International Conference on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICONN)	JAN 28-30, 2019JAN 28-30, 2019	Shizuoka Univ; NCTUShizuoka Univ; NCTU	SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Chennai, INDIASRM Inst Sci & Technol, Chennai, INDIA	7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000488957400091

However, the kinetics of OER is typically sluggish, and conventional OER catalysts are scarce and expensive. Hence, inexpensive and effective catalysts that accelerate the OER kinetics and reduce the overpotential are urgently needed. In this paper, we reported multi-layer graphene-supported perovskite Ba0.95La0.05FeO3-delta (BLF-MLG) as a highly active OER catalyst. Electrochemical results showed that the BLF-MLG hybrid exhibited a high current density (similar to 23 mA/cm(2) at 0.60 V vs. mercury/mercury oxide electrode (MMO)) and a more negative onset potential (similar to 0.43 V vs. MMO). Furthermore, the hybrid showed a smaller Tafel slope (77 mV/decade) and improved long-term stability. The remarkable OER performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between BLF and graphene. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the sol-gel method is used to synthesize the CuxCo3-xO4 catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER),. The CuxCo3-xO4 is synthesized at various calcination temperatures from 250 degrees C to 400 degrees C for 4 h. The CuxCo3-xO4 synthesized at 300 degrees C has a perfect spinel structure without residues of the precursor and secondary phases, such as CuO. The particle size of CuxCo3-xO4 increases with an increase in calcination temperature. Amongst all the samples studied, CuxCo3-xO4, which is synthesized at 300?, has the highest activity for the OER. Its onset potential for the OER is 370 mV and the overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2) is 438 mV The tafel slope of CuxCo3-xO4 synthesized at 300 degrees C has a low value of 58 mV/dec. These results are mainly explained by the increase in the available active surface area of the CuxCo3-xO4 catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-0562	2287-7258		WOS:000460327500005

Catalysts powders obtained were characterized using different physico-chemical techniques (X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, N-2 physisorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) in order to determine their morphological and structural properties. Electrochemical measurements performed using cyclic voltammetry as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques have shown that these catalysts were liable to surface modifications induced by the applied electrode potential. These surface structural modifications as well as their effect on the electroactivity of the catalyst towards the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline medium are discussed. In particular, some activated Ni(x)CoyO(4) compositions showed remarkable catalytic ability towards the OER in alkaline electrolyte.

However, perovskite formation usually requires high-temperature annealing at 600 degrees to 900 degrees C in air, under which most of the used conductive frameworks (for example, carbon and metal current collectors) are reductive and cannot survive. We propose a preoxidization coupled electrodeposition strategy in which Co2+ is preoxidized to Co3+ through cobalt Fenton reaction in aqueous solution, whereas the reductive nickel framework is well maintained during the sequential annealing under nonoxidative atmosphere. The in situ-generated Co3+ is inherited into oxidized perovskites deposited on 3D nickel foam, rendering the monolithic perovskite electrocatalysts with extraordinary OER performance with an ultralow overpotential of 350 mV required for 10 mA cm(-2), a very small Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1), and superb stability in 0.10 M KOH. Therefore, we inaugurate a unique strategy for in situ hybridization of oxidative active phase with reductive framework, affording superb reactivity of perovskite electrocatalyst for efficient water oxidation.									84	18	0	0	6	0	84			2375-2548			WOS:000387991500010	27819040

The activities of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are significantly enhanced by the hollow structure and optimal composition.

When Ni4Cu2@C hollow spheres are employed as electrocatalysts for both the anode and cathode in an overall water splitting system, a cell voltage of only 1.49 V at 15 mA cm(-2) and long-term durability (50 h@40 mA cm(-2)) are achieved.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11				2052-1537		WOS:000519639900027

The determination of the mass activity of a given catalyst is associated with this parameter which can thus lead to materials benchmarking. Reliable and robust methods to measure ECSA are needed, and those have to accommodate different structures, morphologies and compositions. In this study, we investigate mercury underpotential deposition (Hg-UPD) as a way to estimate ECSA for ultraporous electrocatalysts based on iridium and iridium-molybdenum electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. Results reveal a clear agreement between physisorption measurements and Hg-UPD with excellent reproducibility. The method shows also that pre- and post-catalysis surface area measurements are not affected by the catalytic process on short timescale, opening the possibility of electrocalyst stability and degradation monitoring.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000683322100001

In this work, a series of bimetallic Fe-Co chalcogenophosphates were facilely prepared and used as bifunctional water electrolysis catalysts. The results have shown that the obtained catalysts showed high performances for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, and overall water splitting. For the optimum catalyst, only 260 and 365 mV of overpotential for HER and OER, and 1.59 V of cell voltage for water splitting was needed respectively in 1 M KOH when 10 mA cm(-2) of current density was reached. High stability and Faraday efficiency were also obtained, and the obtained results confirm that the catalyst is competitive in application in water electrolysis.

Powdery electrocatalysts loaded on current collectors by binders are often designed, but easily fall off due to strong attack by bubbles at an industrial large current density (>400 mA cm(-2)). A novel strategy is developed to construct a self-supported dual-phase porous Co2P-Co3O4 film for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and micro-nanoporous Co2P film for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) based on the electrodeposition of single-phase porous CoP film on gas-liquid-solid interface, phase separation to Co2P-Co, and selective oxidation/etching of the Co phase. The self-supported dual-phase Co2P-Co3O4 catalyst exhibits good electrocatalytic activity for OER. The overpotentials are 265 and 405 mV at 20 and 200 mA cm(-2), respectively. In addition, the self-supported micro-nanoporous Co2P catalyst shows high catalytic activity for HER due to large active area and good wettability. Both dual-phase Co2P-Co3O4 and micro-nanoporous Co2P possess ultrastability, even at a large current density of 500 mA cm(-2) due to the self-supported structure. The cell voltage of water electrolysis using a self-supported Co2P-Co3O4 parallel to Co2P electrolyzer at 500 mA cm(-2) is only about 3.36 +/- 0.01 V, which is much lower than that (4.31 +/- 0.05 V) of the IrO2-Ta2O5 parallel to Pt electrolyzer.									95	6	0	0	4	0	95			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000452401000019

It is demonstrated that the performance of this material depends strongly on the modifications of MnO2. All modifications investigated were found to be more active than the usual anode of lead alloyed with silver (PbAg) used in zinc electrowinning. A composite sample containing chemical manganese dioxide (CMD) was found to give an oxygen evolution overpotential 0.25 V lower than the standard PbAg anode material. In the second part of the article, we investigate the effect of varying several parameters of the composite electrode assembly, including the size of the catalyst particles and percentage of the catalyst material used. A model is proposed where the performance of the material is proportional to the total length of the boundaries between the lead matrix material and the MnO2 catalyst particles. Physicochemical processes contributing to the observed data are discussed.									41	11	0	0	2	0	49			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000271766000023

As demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry and XPS, the bromine adlayer used to protect Pt single crystals against ambient air and solvent vapor is desorbed in DMSO and does not affect the following measurements. Cyclic voltammetry, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), and rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) investigations with variation of the electrode surface roughness and atomically surface structure show, that on Pt electrodes the CaO2 adsorbate layer formation determines the ORR product distribution. On Pt electrodes, calcium peroxide is formed on the clean electrode, whereas calcium superoxide is formed at the adsorbate covered electrode. We furthermore identified four key parameters, which strongly affect the ORR product distribution: 1) The electrode oxide interaction: A strong interaction increases superoxide contribution; 2) The alkaline earth metal oxide interaction: A strong interaction increases peroxide contribution; 3) The electrode surface area: A large electrode surface area increases peroxide contribution; 4) Electrode surface defects: Defects increase superoxide contribution. Finally, reviewing earlier results of our group, we provide a more general mechanism for the oxygen reduction alkaline earth metal cation containing DMSO, for a variety of electrode materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000793122300001

The carbon to oxygen ratio increased from 1.46 in GO to 2.72 in r-GO. The electron rate transfer capabilities of Pt, Pd, Ru, Pt-Pd and Pt-Ru decorated r-GO were tested in ferri-ferro coupling reaction. Excellent electrochemical behaviour were observed in their ability to oxidize hydrazine, reduce H2O2, as well as oxygen reduction in alkaline medium and hydrogen evolution in acidic medium. These reactions represent diverse applications in energy production, storage, electrochemical sensing and electro catalysis, thus the method presented here can be quite useful in diverse applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2365-6549			WOS:000453917200019	30761354

Herein, a Co-doped Ni-Mo phosphide nanorod arrays fabricated on porous Ni foam was shown to be an efficient binder-free electrocatalyst for water splitting. This catalyst featured exceptional activity, exhibiting an overpotential of 29 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction, whereas the corresponding precatalyst exhibited an overpotential of 314 mV at a current density of 50 mA.cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction. The achieved electrocatalytic performance provided access to a simple water splitting system, affording a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) at 1.47 V in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Density functional theory results indicated that Co doping and phosphorization were responsible for the high electrocatalytic performance. Thus, this work paves the way for the development of novel noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for practical H-2 production via water splitting.									22	1	0	0	0	0	21			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000561979800004

Here, three-dimensional porous nanostructures anchored by metal nanospheres were successfully prepared based on low-cost biomass as a carbon-based material, which was modified with FeNi bimetallic nanospheres and treated through temperature-programmed annealing and nitridation of FeNi(x) precursors. Moreover, in this article, the influence of morphology and valence changes caused by different metal ratios on the performance of OER is explored. Specifically, FeNi(2)/NC-800 showed a lower over-potential as low as 250 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a slight Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1) OER in 1 M KOH, which is better than that of the noble metal catalyst. The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) test shows the most negligible diffusion resis-tance. Moreover, the anchoring of metal nanospheres on the nitrogen carbon substrate can provide more stable morphology characteristics for the catalyst, which shows excellent durability at 1.48 V. The excellent OER performance is attributed to the excellent electron transport efficiency provided by the unique morphology and the synergistic effect between FeNi-N-C.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, a series of peapod-like metallic MxPy/C (M = Co, Ni, and Cu) composites is developed as bifunctional catalysts toward hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. For the first time, the metallic property of Cu3P is confirmed through the theoretical calculation. The in-depth composition, structural and catalytic mechanism analysis of MxPy/C discloses that the comparable activity and considerable durability of these catalysts mainly result from the strengthened synergistic effect between metallic MxPy and carbon layer based on the unique peapod-like architecture. Especially, the atomic contact between MxPy and carbon not only provides an open channel for electronic transmission but also ensures the integrity of peapod-like structure. Furthermore, the high electric conductivity of the inner metallic MxPy and the outer carbon layer endows the MxPy/C catalyst with rapid charge migration during the electrocatalytic pathway. These findings shed light on the origin of high catalytic activity of MxPy/C and open a path for purposefully rationally synthesizing superior electrocatalysts.									32	1	0	0	0	0	32			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000399455900008	28165204

Proton reduction is well-understood, with catalysts achieving quantum yields of 34% when driven by visible light. Water oxidation, on the other hand, is much less advanced, typically involving expensive metal centers and rarely working in conjunction with a photochemically powered system. Before further progress can be made in the field of water splitting, significant developments in the catalysis of oxygen evolution are needed. Herein we present an iron-centered tetraamido macrocyclic ligand (Fe-TAML) that efficiently catalyzes the oxidative conversion of water to dioxygen. When the catalyst is combined in unbuffered solution with ceric ammonium nitrate, its turnover frequency exceeds 1.3 s(-1). Real-time UV vis and oxygen monitoring of the active complex give insights into the reaction and decay kinetics.									500	13	0	0	57	0	506			0002-7863			WOS:000280861300014	20698652

Bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts are often suggested to improve the stability during startup and shutdown of fuel cells. Furthermore, they have been proposed for the socalled unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFCs) that would allow a closed loop system to use and produce hydrogen on demand. We compare the electrocatalytic performance of conventional PtxIry alloy nanoparticles (NPs) with Pt-IrO2 NP composites (nanocomposites), both immobilized onto a commercial carbon support. The Pt-IrO2 nanocomposites thereby consist of a mixture of Pt NPs and IrO2 NPs. By probing the electrocatalytic performance before and after exposing the electrocatalysts to accelerated degradation tests (ADTs), it is shown that the Pt-IrO2 nanocomposite concept offers advantages but also some disadvantages over the conventional alloy concept. In particular, it is shown that while the nanocomposites are initially less active for the ORR because of an interparticle effect, their performance is less affected by the ADTs. However, all the tested catalysts experience a decline of the Ir/Pt ratio upon ADT treatment, highlighting the limiting value of Ir as an OER catalyst for startup-shutdown protection in fuel cells as well as the challenging stability requirements for URFCs.									20	1	0	0	2	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000611450000031

Herein, how the electrode conductivity affects the reaction sites of oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in acidic and alkaline solutions was investigated by employing visualization system and electrochemical testing. Inserting Au nanolayers greatly increased electrode conductivities, improved OER kinetics and reduced cell ohmic resistance, leading to excellent water splitting performances in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Furthermore, the in-situ visualization results showed more reaction sites and higher catalyst utilizations were achieved by augmenting the electrode conductivity, and reaction sites increased from 1-dimension to 2-dimension. It was discovered that electrical conductivities of acidic and alkaline solutions are insufficient to overcome the sharp drop of potential in the electrical double layer for activating OER uniformly on low-conductivity catalysts, indicating the importance of electrical conductivity of the electrode in acidic and alkaline water electrolyzers. This study provided a guidance on how to develop efficient and compact electrodes for acidic and alkaline water electrolyzer stacks and other electrochemical devices, such as fuel cell, N-2 reduction, CO2 conversion, etc. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a self-assembly method using silicon dioxide (SiO2) as template is proposed, in which tin dioxide (SnO2) and tin disulfide (SnS2) are constructed on the inner and outer walls of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) hollow nanospheres respectively, realizing the dual function of different interfaces controlled by g-C3N4 as the main body. Benefit from this design, the inner wall SnO2@g-C3N4 play a major contribution to oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while the outer wall g-C3N4@SnS2 contribute more to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Specifically, the adjustment of C element enhances the adsorption of *H at the edge S site, and the adjustment of N element optimizes the adsorption of OER reactant and the intermediate, thereby improving the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity. The test results show that the electrocatalytic material SnO2@g-C3N4@SnS2 & nbsp;exhibits an excellent electrocatalytic performance of OER and HER in alkaline medium. In addition, low voltage and 48 h stability of SnO2@g-C3N4@SnS2 are also demonstrated in the overall water splitting test.

Here it is shown that stainless-steel AISI316 is an appropriate support electrode for a co-electrodeposited Ni-CeOx catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions. Optimal OER performance is achieved via a cyclic voltammetric deposition protocol rather than constant potential deposition for the catalyst layer. An overpotential of 300 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is recorded with a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec(-1) while the catalyst also demonstrates long-term stability. It is also found that the catalyst layer changes significantly after the OER. This includes changes to the catalyst morphology, distribution of oxidation state, and speciation as well as the transformation from an entirely amorphous material into one containing crystalline regions. This simple one-step electrodeposition process on a cost-effective substrate should, in principle, facilitate the fabrication of low-cost electrolyzers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-709X			WOS:000702439800001

In this work, a series of core-shell nanostructure NiO-x@Co0.5Fe0.5P/CC have been fabricated by an easy synthetic strategy and served as bifunctional electrocatalytic electrode for overall water splitting. Owing to the heterostructure and interaction between the outer NiO nanoparticles shell and inner Co0.5Fe0.5P nanowires core, the optimal NiO-3@Co0.5Fe0.5P/CC catalytic electrode exhibits admirable catalytic performance both for HER and OER (73 mV and 262 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively) in 1 M KOH solution. As a result, the water electrolysis device based on NiO-3@Co0.5Fe0.5P/CC || NiO-3@Co0.5Fe0.5P/CC system only needs 1.585 V to offer the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and keeps excellent durability for 40 h, suggesting its great practical application value for overall water splitting.(C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, anion-modulation of 3D Ni-V-based transition metal interstitial compound (TMIC) heterojunctions supported on nickel foam (Ni3N-VN/NF and Ni2P-VP2/NF) as coupled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for efficient overall water splitting is demonstrated. The heterointerface in Ni3N-VN has a suitable H* absorption energy, being favorable for enhancing HER activity with onset overpotential (eta(onset)) of zero and Tafel slope of 37 mV dec(-1) in 1 m KOH (close to that of Pt/C/NF). For the OER, the synergy of Ni2P-VP2 with oxide species can give enhanced activity with eta(onset) of 220 mV and Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1). The good activity is ascribed to heterointerface for activating the intermediates, good conductivity of TMICs for electron-transfer, and porous structure facilitation of mass-transport. Additionally, the minimal mutual influence of Ni3N-VN/NF and Ni2P-VP2/NF allows easy coupling for efficient overall water splitting with a low driving voltage (>= 1.43 V), a voltage of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm(-2), and remarkable durability for 100 h. It can be driven by a solar cell (1.5 V), indicating its potential to store intermittent energy.									337	20	0	0	9	0	338			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000474087100020	30993780

These systems are typically limited to anaerobic conditions due to the inhibiting effects of O-2. Here, we report that sacrificial H-2 evolution with CdS quantum dots does not necessarily suffer from O-2 inhibition and can even be stabilised under aerobic conditions. The introduction of O-2 prevents a key inactivation pathway of CdS (over-accumulation of metallic Cd and particle agglomeration) and thereby affords particles with higher stability. These findings represent a possibility to exploit the O-2 reduction reaction to inhibit deactivation, rather than catalysis, offering a strategy to stabilise photocatalysts that suffer from similar degradation reactions.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000452614800017	29750379

Herein, the design of porous Zn-doped CoNiP arrays anchored on Ni foam (P-Zn-CoNiP/NF) as effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting is reported. The key to construct P-Zn-CoNiP is first the introduction of Zn species in NiCoP anchored on Ni foam (NF) followed by its selective etching in dilute HCl to leave pores and form doping in final CoNiP. The pores facilitate the mass of transfer and expose more active sites. The Zn doping can modulate the electronic structure of NiCoP. Benefited from the aforementioned characteristics, the P-Zn-CoNiP/NF possesses remarkable activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 m KOH, which can produce a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 177 and 396 mV for HER and OER, respectively, which is superior to most non-noble metal-based catalysts. The cell assembled using P-Zn-CoNiP/NF as both cathode and anode achieves a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.71 V and can be driven by a solar cell (1.51 V), indicating its potential for practical storage of solar energy.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000505960900019

Results indicated that the high temperature and pressure have effectively reduced the electrochemical resistance (R-ct) and solution resistance (R-s) for coal electrolysis. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) potentials for coal-water slurry electrolysis was obviously seen to increase with increasing temperature and pressure. What's more, the difference between the potential of OER and the equilibrium potential of OER (overpotential) also increased with the intensified condition, which was defined as the metastable zone width (MZW), indicating that HO center dot formation was improved by the high temperature and pressure. As expected, the elevation in temperature and pressure has successfully resulted in the decrease in cell voltage and the increase in coal desulfurization during the electrolysis.

Herein, in terms of theoretical predictions, we confirm that metallic Co exhibits HER catalytic selectivity, whereas Co2C has moderate binding energies for OER intermediates, thus boosting water splitting kinetics by the compatible integration. Experimentally, we present an interface engineering of Co nanoparticles and Co2C nanowires on carbon cloth (CC) resulting in a unique Co-Co2C/CC electrocatalyst. The resultant Co-Co2C/CC entails low overpotentials of only 261 mV for OER and 96 mV for HER at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which are one of the highest activities yet reported for cobalt carbide-based materials. Moreover, the assembled electrolyzer can be driven by a solar cell. This work enlightens a novel avenue for the rational design of metal carbide-based highly efficient electrocatalysts.									36	0	0	0	1	0	36			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000712107500003

USE - As rechargeable molten nitrate salt electrolyte battery (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The battery has significantly higher cell voltages and improved energy and power density. Additionally, harmful gas-evolution reactions are addressed by eliminating chloride ions, sodium ions, and moisture contaminants. The lithium anode when immersed in a nitrate electrolyte is able to form directly over its surface a solid electrolyte interface consisting of lithium oxide which protects and stabilizes the lithium metal. The higher temperatures made possible by the use of molten nitrates greatly increase the reaction rate for the oxygen cathode. This reduces or eliminates the need to employ expensive catalysts to maintain rapid cell dynamics for the reduction of oxygen gas. Furthermore, as the rates of the electrode reactions occurring will be larger at the elevated temperatures needed to maintain the electrolyte in a molten condition, cell voltage losses will be smaller for both the discharge and charging cycles.

Herein, we synthesize a new CoP(MoP)-CoMoO3 heterostructure coated by a N-doped carbon shell [CoP(MoP)-CoMoO3@CN] via thermal decomposition and phosphatizing of the CoMoO4.0.9H(2)O nanowires encapsulated in N-doped carbon. At 10 mA.cm(-2), this CoP(MoP)-CoMoO3@CN nanocomposite exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity at low overpotentials of 296 mV for OER and 198 mV for HER in alkaline media. More importantly, we achieve a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) at 1.55 V by using this CoP(MoP)-CoMoO3@CN as both cathode and anode for overall water splitting. This promising performance could be due to the high activity of CoP(MoP)-CoMoO3 and the good conductivity of the external mesoporous N-carbon shell, which makes the CoP(MoP)-CoMoO3@CN nanowires a competitive alternative to noble-metal-based catalysts for water splitting.									63	1	0	0	4	0	63			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000459642200021	30652462

The electrocatalytic properties of coating cathodes for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were investigated by cyclic polarization combined with scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The results showed that there existed TIN substrates on the electrodes and the electrode calcined at 420 degrees C exhibited the best electrocatalytic activity for HER. Electrode potential for hydrogen evolution on coating electrodes was - 0.26 V ( vs SCE). The Tafel slope was - 0. 04 V in the low overpotential region of HER. The structure of oxide electrodes was changed by a multitude of hydrogen atoms adsorbed on the electrode surface in the high overpotential region of HER, which restrained the cathodic reduction reaction of oxygen. These results suggest primarily that it is feasible using TiN as support for the IrO2-Ta2O5 coating cathode.									6	4	0	0	0	0	7			0253-9837	1872-2067		WOS:000242869300006

According to a set of electrochemical tests, the obtained FeCo@NC can function as a Janus to drive OER and ORR with desirable activities and stabilities in alkaline media. Specifically, the FeCo@NC presents an onset-potential of 1.45V, a potential of 1.49V at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1) as OER catalyst, and an Onset potential of 0.94V, a half-wave potential of 0.8V as ORR catalyst.

The key relationship between the spatial distribution of components and enhanced electrocatalysis performance still needs further elaborate elucidation. Here, CeO2 substrate supported CoS1.97 (CeO2-CoS1.97) and CoS1.97 with CeO2 surface decorated (CoS1.97-CeO2) materials are constructed to comprehensively investigate the origin of spatial architectures for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). CeO2-CoS1.97 exhibits a low overpotential of 264 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) due to the stable heterostructure and faster mass transfer. Meanwhile, CoS1.97-CeO2 has a smaller Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1) through enhanced adsorption of OH-, fast electron transfer, and in situ formation of Co(IV)O-2 species under the OER condition.

Here, we report the synthesis of mackinawite FeS nanosheets grown on iron foam, which can serve as an efficient pre-electrocatalyst for both HER and OER in alkaline media. During electrochemical HER testing, core@shell iron@iron oxysulfide nanoparticles as the catalytically active phase are generated in situ on FeS nanosheets. During electrochemical OER testing, FeS nanosheets totally transform into porous amorphous FeOx film that can mediate the OER efficiently. When assembled as the cathode and the anode in a single electrolyzer, the resulting Fe-based catalysts can give a good overall water splitting output that outperforms the one obtained from a noble-metal-based Pt/C-lrO(2)-coupled electrolyzer. These results provide new insights on the active sites of Fe-based catalysts as well as an impetus for further research on low-cost, iron-containing water-splitting electrocatalysts.									189	9	1	0	11	0	193			2451-9294			WOS:000432725000019

Low-energy electron microscopy and photoelectron spectromicroscopy studies of the real-space structure and composition of a Au-modified Rh(110) surface during water formation reveal reorganization processes due to Au mass transport triggered by the propagating reaction fronts. The temporal evolution of the surface reaction results in a 'patterned' surface consisting of separated Au-rich and Au-poor phases with different oxygen coverage, Rh surface structure, and reactivity. The experimental results are complemented by ab initio electronic-structure calculations of the O and Au adsorption phases, which demonstrate that the reorganization of the Au adlayer by the propagating reaction fronts is an energetically driven process. Our findings suggest that reaction-induced spatial inhomogeneity in the surface composition and structure is a common feature of metal catalysts modified with adatoms which become mobile under reaction conditions.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000227099400057	15713115

Long-term operating stability and activity of candidate electrocatalysts are important parameters for evaluating their commercial potential. However, long-term stability and activity parameters in electrocatalysis depend on various chemical factors (such as pH, composition and oxidation state of catalyst, etc.) and physical factors (such as particle size, morphology, conductivity, etc.). It is extremely difficult to evaluate and estimate which factor dominates the electrocatalytic stability, because electrocatalytic reactions occur via multistep processes, which contain chemical, electrochemical and mechanical treatments. In addition to advanced research methods that can provide accurate information about electrochemical systems, it is essential to develop data analysis methods in order to make significant progress. A new and powerful systematic approach is needed to determine the long-term stability of active and stable electrocatalysts. In this study, in order to evaluate and estimate to long term stability and activation loss of electrocatalysts, we propose data processing approach using a typical electrochemical measurement. A scientific software tool based on C++; ROOT, was used for the analysis and visualisation of data processing. Various statistical and mathematical functions are well integrated into the framework and this allows to operate data with a few simple commands. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It remains challenging to achieve efficient OER and ORR bifunctionality on a single lightweight and inexpensive electrode. In this article, a metal-free, and freestanding air cathode based on vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) functionalized with N, P heteroatoms doped carbon is first reported. In addition to the high catalytic activity caused by N, P heteroatoms doping, the importance of efficient gas diffusion and electron transfer provided by the VACNT-GF hierarchical structure is highlighted. The carbonization temperature has been identified to have pronounced effect on catalytic activity, and the samples with P-N bonds have smaller ORR and OER overpotentials, while the quantitative atomic ratio of either P or N has little effect on catalytic activity. The resulting air electrode achieved a high peak power density of 56 mW cm(-2) at a current density of 120 mA cm(-2), outperforming Pt/C- and IrO2-based rechargeable Zn-air batteries. The zinc air battery assembled with the air electrode also showed good cyclability, which exceeded that of cells with the Pt/CHIrO2 catalyst. The increase of voltage difference between the charge and discharge platform was 0.2 V for the cell assembled with N,P-doped VACNT-based freestanding air cathode after 75 h of operation at 10 mA cm(-2), which was less than half of that of cells with Pt/CHIrO2 catalyst. Impedance analysis further reveals the good performance results from the favorable mass transfer of the electrode.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2574-0962			WOS:000459948900067

We report a bifunctional electrocatalyst synthesized by a chemical deposition of palladium (Pd) nanoparticles on three-dimensionally ordered mesoporous cobalt oxide (Pd@3DOM-Co3O4) demonstrating extreme stability and activity towards electrocatalytic oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER). Pd@3DOM-Co3O4 exhibits a significantly positive-shifted ORR half-wave potential of 0.88 V (vs. RHE) and a higher OER current density of 41.3 mA cm(-2) measured at 2.0 V (vs. RHE) relative to non-deposited 3DOM-Co3O4. Moreover, in terms of durability, Pd@3DOM-Co3O4 demonstrates a negligible half-wave potential loss with 99.5% retention during ORR and a high current density retention of 96.4% during OER after 1000 cycles of accelerated degradation testing (ADT). Ab-initio computational simulation of the oxygen reactions reveals that the modification of the electronic structure by combining Pd and Co3O4 lowers the Pd d-band center and enhances the electron abundance at the Fermi level, resulting in improved kinetics and conductivity. Furthermore, it is elucidated that the enhanced electrochemical stability is attributed to an elevated carbon corrosion potential (U-corr,U-C) for the Pd@3DOM-Co3O4 surface and an increased dissolution potential (U-diss) of Pd nanoparticles. Meanwhile, synergistic improvements in the bifunctional activity resulting from the combination of Pd and 3DOM-Co3O4 were confirmed by both electrochemical and physical characterization methods, which highlights the practical viability of Pd@3DOM-Co3O4 as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for rechargeable metal-air batteries.									40	2	0	0	0	0	40			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000446283800068

Naturally, rational design of highefficiency and multifunctional electrocatalyst towards UOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of vital significance, but still a grand challenge. Herein, an innovative 3D Ru-modified NiFe metalorganic framework (MOF) nanoflake array on Ni foam (Ru-NiFe-x/NF) was elaborately designed via spontaneous galvanic replacement reaction (GRR). Notably, the adsorption capability of intermediate species (H*) of catalyst is significantly optimized by Ru modification. Meanwhile, rich high-valence Ni active species can be acquired by self-driven electronic reconstruction in the interface, then dramatically accelerating the electrolysis of water and urea. Remarkably, the optimized Ru-NiFe-(R)/NF (1.6 at% of Ru) only requires the overpotential of 90 and 310 mV to attain 100 mA cm(-2) toward HER and OER in alkaline electrolyte, respectively. Impressively, an ultralow voltage of 1.47 V is required for Ru-NiFe-(R)/NF to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in urea-assisted electrolysis cell with superior stability, which is 190 mV lower than that of Pt/C-NF parallel to RuO2/NF couple. This work is desired to explore a facile way to exploit environmentally-friendly energy by coupling hydrogen evolution with urea-rich sewage disposal. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Here, the hierarchical NiCo2S4 nanosheets/reduced graphene oxide (NiCo2S4/RGO) architecture composite was designed and synthesized. The constitution and morphology of NiCo2S4/RGO composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. Then, the electrochemical performance of as-prepared NiCo2S4/RGOs for OER was studied. The optimal composite (NiCo2S4/RGO-2) exhibited the best improved compared to raw NiCo2S4 on OER performance, which afforded a small overpotential (366 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and a low Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1) and good stability in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The hierarchical architecture of the NiCo2S4/RGO system endows more active sites and enhances charge transfer. This work provided a general strategy to design more efficient NiCo-based chalcogenide OER electrocatalysts.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000502332900023

Herein, Co3O4/Co nano-heterojunctions tailored in nitrogen-doped porous graphitized carbon frameworks (Co3O4/Co@NCs) are synthesized via annealing Co-based metal-organic-frameworks (Co-based MOFs). This structure for electrocatalysts with a combination of mixed metallic Co species and encapsulating porous graphitized carbon offers an efficient charge/mass transport environment. In addition, the Co3O4/Co nano-heterostructured interfaces serve as efficient reactive sites to enhance oxygen electrocatalysis. Furthermore, the strong binding forces between nanoparticles and carbon frameworks through Co-N covalent bonds prevent the loss of nanoparticles from the electmcatalysts, providing outstanding durability. Consequently, Co3O4/Co@NCs surpasses the performance of noble-metal catalysts with a positive half-wave potential of 0.92 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) for the oxygen reduction reaction and a low potential of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm 2 for the oxygen evolution reaction. Impressively, our assembled zinc-air batteries using Co3O4/Co@NCs as the rechargeable air electrode exhibit superior charge-discharge performance and ultra-stable cyclability with almost no increase in polarization even after 600 h (10 mA cm(-2)), possessing great potential for practical application in next-generation rechargeable batteries.									39	0	0	0	2	0	39			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000581738300078

Therefore, catalyst materials should be tailored to mitigate the low efficiencies of air-breathing batteries. A porphyrin-derived catalyst is optimized by introducing different metal-centered organometallic phthalocyanine (MPc) complexes and their potential application as redox mediators (RMs) for fabricating efficient Li-O-2 cells is investigated. The feasibility of each MPc is determined as a potential RM by calculating its orbital levels. The electrochemical properties of the Li-O-2 cells employing the diverse MPc-RMs are compared. The MPc-containing Li-O-2 cells exhibit improved cell performance, reduced polarization, and stable cyclability with auto-oxygenated properties as revealed by directly injecting superoxide species into the MPc-containing electrolytes. The synergistic effects of blended MPcs-a mixture consisting of the two most effective MPcs-in both the OER and ORR regions in ambient air atmosphere are also elucidated. The reaction mechanism of the MPc-containing cells is proposed based on first-principles calculations and experimental results. The introduction of natural functional catalysts provides a basis for developing effective eco-friendly catalysts for application to sustainable air-breathing batteries.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000738582200001

Composites of carbon/manganese oxide have emerged as a potential solution with high catalytic performance; however, the use of non-renewable carbon sources with tedious and non-scalable synthetic methods notably compromised the merit of being low cost. In this work, high quantity of carbon is produced from renewable source of readily available table sugar by a facile room temperature dehydration process, on which manganese oxide nanorods are grown to yield an electrocatalyst of MnOx@AC-S with high oxygen bifunctional catalytic activities. A Zn-air battery with the MnOx@AC-S composite catalyst in its air-cathode delivers a peak power density of 116 mW cm(-2) and relatively stable cycling performance over 215 discharge and charge cycles. With decent performance and high synthetic yield achieved for the MnOx@AC-S catalyst form a renewable source, this research sheds light on the advancement of low-cost yet efficient electrocatalyst for the industrialization of rechargeable Zn-air battery.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14				2073-4344		WOS:000516825000064

Depending on the amount of iron, the NiCoFeP nanocatalysts exhibit different surface topographies and chemical binding energies, which have a great influence on electrochemical performances. The optimal NiCoP-0.01 M Fe films show robust bifunctional electrocatalytic activities with an overpotential of 118 mV (10 mA cm(-2)) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 300 mV (50 mA cm(-2)) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The overall water splitting employing this proposed nanocatalyst at both electrodes only presents a cell voltage of 1.60 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), far lower than that (1.73 V) with the commercial Pt/C cathode and RuO2 anode combination.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			2196-0216			WOS:000616887800011

Here, we prepared cobalt-doped NiS@MoS2 core-shell nanorods (Co-NiS@MoS2) as bifunctional catalyst through a simple one-step hydrothermal method. Co-NiS@MoS2 catalyst could achieve brilliant electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and overall water splitting. And Co-NiS@MoS2 catalyst manifested small overpotentials at 50 mA cm(-2) for both HER (139.9 mV) and OER (170.6 mV) catalytic performance in 1 M KOH solution. In addition, it displayed a cell voltage of 1.54 V at 50 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting, which is comparable with or surpasses the reported catalysts in the literatures. And Co-NiS@MoS2 catalyst had superior stabilities for HER, OER and overall water splitting in 1 M KOH due to its unique core-shell structure and synergistic effects of NiS nanorods and MoS2 nanosheets.

A range of Pt depositions were used to determine the growth mechanism for the Pt-WC powder system. TEM imaging and Cu stripping voltammetry found that Pt ALD growth on WC powder substrates was similar to that on WC thin films. However, excess free carbon was found to affect Pt ALD by blocking adsorption sites on WC. The Pt-WC samples were evaluated for the oxygen reduction reaction using a rotating disk electrode to obtain quantitative activity information. The mass and specific activities for the 30 and 50 ALD cycle samples were found to be comparable to a 10 wt.% Pt/C catalyst. However, higher overpotentials and lower limiting currents were observed with ALD Pt-WC compared to Pt/C catalysts, indicating that the oxygen reduction mechanism is not as efficient on Pt-WC as on bulk Pt. Additionally, these Pt-WC catalysts were used to demonstrate hydrogen evolution reaction activity and were found to perform as well as bulk Pt catalyst but with a fraction of the Pt loading, in agreement with the previous work on Pt-WC thin film catalysts.

Subsequently, the thermal treatment in the presence of sodium hydrogen phosphite enabled the successful transition into metal phosphides with the hierarchical cube-on-plate structure. When used as electrocatalytsts, the obtained bimetal phosphides exhibited good bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions with good long-term stability. Thus, an enhanced performance for overall water splitting can be achieved, which could be ascribed to the hierarchical structure and favorable composition of as-prepared bimetal phosphide for rapid electron and mass transfer. The present study demonstrates a favorable approach to modulate the composition and structure of metal phosphide for enhancing the electrocatalytic ability toward water splitting.									10	2	0	0	0	0	11			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000524300900001	32167236

Here, we report a bifunctional catalyst comprising transition metal hydroxides (TMOHs) and transition metal sulphides (TMSs) grown on a nickel foam (NF) surface, denoted as NiFeOH/CoSx/NF, that delivers high electrocatalytic activity for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER: ultra-low overpotential of 211 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2)) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER: overpotential of 146 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline media, representing one of the best bifunctional catalytic performances yet reported for a non-noble metal based system. From our experimental observations, the significant improvement of the catalytic activity emanates from the synergistic effects of NiFeOH and CoSx, due to the optimization of their electronic configurations, thereby creating novel characteristics. Employing this catalyst system as both the anode and the cathode for overall water splitting in a water electrolyzer delivers 10 mA cm(-2)at a low cell potential of 1.563 V with excellent long-term electrocatalytic functionalities over 10 h of continuous operation. These findings represent the design principle for developing multi-component bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000548452100037

Herein, a convenient and simple in situ solvothermal method has been adopted to fabricate a selfsupported, binder-free 3D electrode (Mn-MOF/NF) by the direct growth of a newly synthesized carboxylate-based pristine Mn(II)metal-organic framework (Mn-MOF) upon the conducting substrate nickel foam (NF). The binder-free Mn-MOF/NF electrode exhibits excellent performances toward OWS with ultralow overpotentials of 280 mV@20 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 125 mV@10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with remarkable durability. Mn-MOF/NF can also attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a low cell voltage of 1.68 V in a 0.1 M KOH solution in a two-electrode system for OWS. The direct growth of nonconducting electroactive Mn-MOF materials upon conducting substrate NF provides an excellent mass transport of the electrolyte with a relatively low contact resistance due to the strong catalyst-substrate contact and enhances the efficient electron transport for OWS. The redox chemical etching of the self-sacrificial substrate NF during solvothermal synthesis introduces redox-active Ni2+ in MnMOF/NF. Thus, the excellent OWS electrocatalytic activity can mainly be attributed to the bimetallic synergistic collaboration of the two redox active metal centers (Mn2+ and Ni2+) along with the excellent support surface of NF, which provides a high specific surface area and maximum utilization of the electroactive metal ion sites by preventing the self-aggregation of the active sites. The Mn-MOF/NF electrode also exhibits superb stability and durability for a prolonged time throughout the multiple cycles of full water splitting reactions. Therefore, this work elucidates a convenient and smart approach for constructing MOF-based bifunctional electrocatalysts for OWS.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000818808900001	35735143

In this work, strontium doped lanthanum ferrite La1-xSrxFeO3-delta (x = 0; 0.1; 0.2; 0.3; 0.4; 0.6 and 1.0) powders were prepared by a self-combustion route. The oxides, in the form of carbon paste electrodes, were characterised by cyclic voltammetry in alkaline solutions. Data analyses lead to the selection of La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta to prepare gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs). Cyclic voltammetry and steady state polarization curves were used, respectively, to assess the electrochemical behaviour of GDEs and to obtain kinetic data for both OER and ORR. It is concluded that the oxide preparation conditions/electrode configuration determine the electrode performance. The bifunctionality of the electrodes was assessed, under galvanostatic control, using a cycling protocol within the potential domains for OER and ORR. The potential window, i.e., the total combined overpotential between OER and ORR was found to be of approximate to 770 mV, value which compares well with that obtained under potentiostatic control. Even though the potential window keeps constant during 140 cycles, the increase in cycling time and/or current density (>= 2.5 mA.cm(-2)) led to a gradual metallization of the GDE surface, as confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2372-0468	2372-0484		WOS:000445822900003

Nevertheless, current preparation methodologies suffer from uncontrolled thicknesses, uneven morphologies and area distributions, long processing times, and inferior quality. Here, a sonication-free and fast (in minutes) electrochemical cathodic exfoliation approach is reported that can prepare large-sized (typically approximate to 150 mu m(2)) and thinly layered (approximate to 70% monolayer) NiPS3 flakes with high crystallinity and pure phase structure with a yield approximate to 80%. During the electrochemical exfoliation process, the tetra-n-butylammonium salt with a large ionic diameter is decomposed into gaseous species after the intercalation and efficiently expands the tightly stratified bulk NiPS3 crystals, as revealed by in situ and ex situ characterizations. Atomically thin NiPS3 flakes can be obtained by slight manual shaking rather than sonication, which largely preserves in-plane structural integrity with large size and minimum damage. The obtained high quality NiPS3 offers a new and ideal model for overall water splitting due to its inherent fully exposed S and P atoms that are often the active sites for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Consequently, the bifunctional NiPS3 exhibits outstanding performance for overall water splitting.									40	2	0	0	4	0	40			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000477680900008	31172668

Herein, a versatile and potentially scalable route to gold-decorated manganese oxide-based OER electrocatalysts is reported. In particular, MnxOy(MnO2, Mn2O3) host matrices are grown on conductive glasses by plasma assisted-chemical vapor deposition (PA-CVD), and subsequently functionalized with gold nanoparticles (guest) as OER activators by radio frequency (RF)-sputtering. The final selective obtainment of MnO2- or Mn2O3-based systems is then enabled by annealing under oxidizing or inert atmosphere, respectively. A detailed material characterization evidences the formation of high-purity Mn(x)O(y)dendritic nanostructures with an open morphology and an efficient guest dispersion into the host matrices. The tailoring of Mn(x)O(y)phase composition and host-guest interactions has a remarkable influence on OER activity yielding, for the best performing Au/Mn(2)O(3)system, a current density of approximate to 5 mA cm(-2)at 1.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an overpotential close to 300 mV at 1 mA cm(-2). Such results, comparing favorably with literature data on manganese oxide-based materials, highlight the importance of compositional control, as well as of surface and interface engineering, to develop low-cost and efficient anode nanocatalysts for water splitting applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2366-7486			WOS:000572376000001

Thus, an efficient bifunctional catalyst for ORR and OER is highly desired. Herein, honeycomb-like MnCo2O4.5 spheres were used as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst. It was demonstrated that both ORR and OER catalytic activity are promoted by Mn-IV-induced oxygen vacancy defects and multiple active sites. Importantly, the multivalent ions present in the material and its defect structure endow stable pseudocapacitance within the inactive region of ORR and OER; as a result, a low charge-discharge voltage gap (0.43 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) was achieved when it was employed in a flexible hybrid Zn-based battery. This mechanism provides unprecedented and valuable insights for the development of next-generation metal-air batteries.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000623485700001	33491256

In this work, an excellent platform to realize the decoration of Fe coordinates at the subnanometer scale into nitrogen-doped carbon networks (designated as Fe-Fe@NC) is provided. X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed the precise configuration of Fe coordinates with Fe-Fe and Fe-N coordinations at the molecular level. As a cathode catalyst, the newly developed Fe-Fe@NC exhibited superior ORR performance and a higher peak power density of 175 mW cm(-2) in Zn-air batteries. Unlike most reported pristine Fe-based catalysts, Fe-Fe@NC also showed good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, with a low operating potential (1.67 V vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Calculations based on density functional theory revealed that the Fe-Fe coordination in Fe subclusters favored the 4e(-) transfer pathway and, thus, achieved highly active catalytic performance. This work reveals that iron clusters at the subnanometer scale provide an optimized electronic structure for enhanced ORR activity.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			2055-6756	2055-6764		WOS:000511441800014

To simplify the design of the water splitting devices and enhance its activity, a new thrust to develop low cost, stable, earth abundant electrocatalysts which can participate in both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the need of the hour. Here, we report the twostep hydrothermally synthesized nickel diselenide hexagonal flakes deposited on carbon cloth (NiSe2/CC) which has acted as efficient electrocatalyst for both HER and OER in alkaline medium. Necessary characterizations are performed. The NiSe2 sheet comprises small hexagonal flakes in nanoscale with numerous active sites having hydrophilic nature insist us to choose it as an electrocatalyst resulting in enhanced charge transfer mechanism. The binder free NiSe2/CC exhibits superior catalytic activity employing overpotential of -111 mV and 210 mV in HER and OER to draw 10 mA/cm2 current density, respectively in 1M KOH solution. Sustainability of electrocatalyst is also investigated in extreme pH. Thus, the water splitting device which consists of NiSe2/CC electrodes as cathode and anode in 1M KOH electrolyte, requires only 1.47 V to achieve 10 mA/cm2 current density.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1293-2558	1873-3085		WOS:000652970100001

However, systematic study of the effects of alloying on the catalytic reaction mechanism is still lacking. Here, a systematic study of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the 55-atom Pt-covered alloy nanoclusters was conducted. The addition of Co atoms can not only lead to different reaction mechanism for ORR, e.g., from the hydroperoxyl dissociation to the oxygen dissociation, but also increase the catalytic activity of the Pt-covered alloy nanoclusters. The energy barrier in the reaction-determining step and the excess energy of the 55-atom Pt-covered alloy nanoclusters suggest that among the 55-atom Pt-covered bimetallic and trimetallic alloy nanoclusters, the Pt42Co12Ni1 trimetallic catalyst possesses the highest catalytic activity and the best structural stability. On the basis of the "descriptor" (Delta G(OH)), a series of 55-atom trimetallic clusters are predicted to exhibit excellent catalytic activities for ORR. Our comprehensive study brings new insights into the ORR mechanisms associated with various forms of alloy nanocatalysts, which may offer guidance toward future design and synthesis of more efficient and robust trimetallic alloy nanocatalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2574-0970			WOS:000526396200046

Metal phosphides coupled with heteroatom doped carbon are promising candidates for oxygen electrodes. In this work, we demonstrate a facile strategy to synthesize cobalt phosphide anchored heteroatom (N,P) co-doped porous carbon (CoP/NP-HPC) through a one-step pyrolysis of bimetal-organic frameworks with a simplein situphosphorization process. In alkaline solution, the obtained CoP/NP-HPC catalyst exhibits high bifunctional catalytic activity toward ORR and OER, comparable to commercial 20% Pt/C or even better, which is attributed to the synergistic effect between the CoP active sites and N,P co-doped carbon, and the porous framework as a channel benefiting the diffusion of reaction species. Notably, a rechargeable Zn-air battery with CoP/NP-HPC as the cathode electrocatalyst delivers a high power density of 186 mW cm(-2), as well as good long-term charge/discharge cyclic stability, outperforming 20% Pt/C.

The corresponding industrial applications, however, have not yet been realized due to the unsatisfactory energy conversion efficiency in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with the potential limiting step being the formation of HOO*. In the present work, we report that the functionalization of metal oxide electrocatalysts with thiocyanate groups is a novel, general and effective strategy for improving the catalytic performance of OER. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations show that mechanistic origin of such fucntioanlization is that the potenital limiting step of HOO* formation can be promoted via a cyanate assisted water dissociation. As a result, the SCN-Ru-RuO2/C3N4 may achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the neutral electrolyte at an overpotential of 342 mV, which is significantly lower than that of commercial RuO2 (545 mV). In addition, the SCN-Ru-RuO2/C3N4 anode is observed to outperform the commercial IrO2-anode-embedded electrolyzer in the PEMWE, indicating significant potential in realistic applications. The generalization of the activity enhancement due to thiocyanate functionalization in neutral medium can be demonstrated SCN-Ir/C3N4 and/or SCN-Co3O4/C3N4.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000572164400001

Herein, heterogeneous MoS2-Ni(OH)(2) catalyst supported by Ni foam (MoS2@Ni(OH)(2)/NF) is developed, in which the Ni(OH)(2) nanorod array is grafted with MoS2 nanosheets. The hierarchical 1D/2D structures benefit not only the exposure of catalytic site but also the facilitated charge transfer. The heterointerfaces allow the synergism of electric structure modulation for improved catalytic activity and kinetics towards HER, OER, and overall water splitting. MoS2@Ni(OH)(2)/NF achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low over-potentials of 134 and 233 mV for HER and OER in 1 M KOH, respectively. Moreover, a cell voltage as low as 1.46 V is obtained to afford 10 mA cm(-2) in a tow-electrode electrolyzer using MoS2@Ni(OH)(2)/NF as bifunctional catalysts, assuring it superior to most of the reported noble-metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts. Such heterogeneous design of composite catalyst should shed light on the exploration of functional materials for energy applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Previous research has utilizing the light illumination to promote the charge process in non-aqueous electrolyte. However, the organic electrolyte has been blamed for the poor electrochemical stability and volatilization during illumination. For the first time, photo-enhanced aqueous LOBs have been promoted, where the reaction mechanism of OER is familiar with photo electrochemical (PEC) water-oxidation. The alpha-Fe2O3 nanorods and BiVO4 nanoplates are synthesized by the hydrothermal method combined with heat treatment, showing good photo-electrocatalytic property. Herein, the alpha-Fe2O3 electrode exhibits a superior longtime stability than the BiVO4 nanoplates, which suffer from the severe photo-corrosion. The photo-assisted hybrid Li-O-2 battery based on alpha-Fe2O3 electrode is realized with a discharge potential of 2.56 V. Compared with the traditional hybrid LOBs, the charge potential is reduced from 3.96 V to 3.15 V. This work indicates that most n-type semiconductors used in PEC water-oxidation can have positive effect on the charge process in hybrid LOBs.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			2405-8297			WOS:000576708800002

Here, we investigate nitrate molten salt electrolyte-based open and sealed LiO2 batteries with pristine and iron oxide catalysts. Through the systematic analysis of various Li-O-2 battery characteristics, we observe the irreversible electrochemical reactions of the open Li-O-2 battery with an iron oxide catalyst that erodes the battery performance due to the detrimental parasitic reaction of H-2 gas evolution from the Li anode. In contrast, the sealed Li-O-2 system with cathodes containing the iron oxide catalyst exhibits the formation and decomposition of Li2O discharge products without significant side reactions, which guarantees long cycle endurance, high-rate performance, and a gravimetric energy density. Thus, promising electrochemical results from the sealed Li-O-2 system with the iron oxide catalyst provide a viable strategy for the high-performance molten salt-based Li-O-2 battery.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000709458200039	34596374

Here we report facile synthesis of three-dimensional (3D) carbon nanotube (CNT)/carbon composites using earth-abundant coal as the carbon source, hydrogen reductant and heteroatom dopant to grow CNTs. The prepared composite featuring 3D structural merits and multiple active sites can efficiently catalyze both ORR and OER, affording high activity, fast kinetics, and long-term stability. With the additional incorporation of manganese, the developed catalyst afforded a potential difference of 0.80 V between ORR at the half wave potential and OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The optimized sample has presented excellent OER performance within a constructed solar-powered water splitting system with continuously generating oxygen bubbles at anode. Notably, it can be further used as a durable air-electrode catalyst in constructed Zn-air battery, delivering an initial discharge/charge voltage gap of 0.73 V, a remained voltaic efficiency of 61.2% after 160 cycles and capability to power LED light for at least 80 h. This study provides an efficient approach for converting traditional energy resource i.e. coal to value-added alternative oxygen electrocatalysts in renewable energy conversion systems.

In this work, the Cu2O cubes are first synthesized through a modified precipitation method, and it is subsequently selected as the Cu2+ source to synthesize 3D MOF (metal-organic framework, Cu-BDC) nanoarray by a facile and efficient bottom-up method. Next, porous Cu3P@C is prepared via the low-temperature phosphorization of 3D Cu-BDC nanoarray as a high-performance electrocatalyst for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER). In particular, the effect of reaction temperature on the morphology of 3D Cu-BDC precursor is studied in detail. Experimental results reveal that Cu3P@C-120 derived from sea urchin-like Cu-BDC exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance owning to the high special surface area, developed porous structure, and the uniform dispersion of Cu3P nanoparticles, which affords the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 300 and 124 mV for OER (alkaline medium) and HER (acidic medium) with Tafel slopes of 24 and 29 mV dec(-1), respectively. Remarkably, Cu3P@C-120 also exhibits an excellent durability for OER and HER, making it an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for application in the production of clean hydrogen fuel.									40	2	0	0	5	0	40			2196-7350			WOS:000478624200002

The Pt-Ir catalysts exhibit improved bi-functional activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and its electrocatalytic performance was clearly established using different physi-ochemical characterization techniques. The Pt-Ir composition of 2:1 has a higher electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of about 85.3 m(2)/g compared to other compositions (3:1 and 1:1) and Pt/MWCNT due to the effect of particle size distribution. The improved ORR/OER activity was found to be 139.4 and 740 mA/mg, respectively, for Pt-Ir(2:1)/MWCNT with the potential difference of 760 mV for oxygen bi-functional activity. Furthermore, Pt-Ir(2:1)/MWCNT showed much better stability for ORR compared to other compositions and Pt/MWNCT catalysts, i.e., around 76% of its initial ECSA retained with <20 mV shift in half-wave potential was obtained even after 10,000 potential cycles in acidic medium. It is believed that the Pt enriched surface, amount of Ir content, induced electronic and geometric effects play a vital role on the electrocatalytic activity enhancement of Pt-Ir(2:1)/MWNCT as effective bi-functional oxygen electrode.

A particular concern when designing the BOE is that the OER and ORR have differing catalytic requirements, which make it challenging to develop effective bifunctional electrocatalysts with single active sites. In this study, we focus on advancing the BOE performance using Pt-IrOx and Pt-NiCoOx electrocatalysts. Single-layer and dual-layer Pt-IrOx BOEs were made, with the dual-layer electrode leading to improved performance due to efficient catalyst utilization in both modes. Using the dual-layer oxygen electrode paired with a PtRu/C hydrogen electrode, a round trip efficiency (RTE) as high as 50% (62 %(iR-free)) was achieved at 500 mA/cm(2) and operation for more than 24 h, which included five one-hour-long H-2 generation and consumption cycles followed by one eight-hour-long cycle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest performance for AEM-URFCs reported to date. Lastly, the approach is extended to electrodes with a Pt loading of 0.5 mg/cm(2) and the IrOx substituted by NiCoOx.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000852581000001

In order to develop low-cost electrocatalysts, one of the effective strategies involves alloying noble metals with other transition metals. This strategy promises not only significant reduction of noble metals but also the tunability for enhanced catalytic activity and stability in comparison with conventional catalysts. In this report, some of the recent approaches to developing alloy catalysts for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells will be highlighted. Selected examples will be also discussed to highlight insights into the structural and electrocatalytic properties of nanoalloy catalysts, which have implications for the design of low-cost, active, and durable catalysts for electrochemical energy production and conversion reactions.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2073-4344			WOS:000362642600027

The lack of oxygen - hypoxia - is a main actor in the evolution of tumors and in their growth and appears to be just as important in tumor invasion and metastasis. Mathematical models of the distribution of oxygen in tumors which are based on reaction-diffusion equations provide partial but qualitatively significant descriptions of the measured oxygen concentrations in the tumor microenvironment, especially when they incorporate important elements of the blood vessel network such as the blood vessel size and spatial distribution and the pulsation of local pressure due to blood circulation. Here, we review our mathematical and numerical approaches to the distribution of oxygen that yield insights both on the role of the distribution of blood vessel density and size and on the fluctuations of blood pressure.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0065-2598	2214-8019	978-3-030-43093-1; 978-3-030-43092-4	WOS:000546515600005	32578171

The resulting Ni3S2 nanotube arrays exhibited higher catalytic activity than Ni3S2 nanosheets for hydrogen evolution reaction.

According to extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis, the substituted V ion is stabilized in highly distorted local symmetry whereas the substituted Co ion has regular octahedral local environment. Both the V- and Co-substituted alpha-MnO2 materials exhibit excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic functionalities with lowered overpotentials and enhanced current densities for oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), underscoring the beneficial role of cation substitution in enhancing the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of alpha-MnO2. The Co-substituted alpha-MnO2 shows higher bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst functionality than does the V-substituted homologue, which is attributable to the greater improvement of charge transfer kinetics upon the Co substitution than the V one. The poorer charge transfer property of V-substituted alpha-MnO2 can be ascribed to highly distorted local symmetry of V ion, which is unfavorable for increasing band width and depressing bandgap energy. Taking into account many advantages of the oxides of V, Mn, and Co elements such as low price, rich abundance, and environmentally benignity, the present study underscores that the partial substitution of neighboring 3d metal ion having regular octahedral symmetry can provide an effective and environmental friendly way of optimizing the oxygen electrocatalytic activity of manganese oxide.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000452936800050

However, shape-controlled synthesis of such kinds of HEA catalysts, especially those with high index facets, still faces great challenges, limiting further enhancement of their catalytic performance. Herein, one-pot synthesis of convex cube-shaped Pt34Fe5Ni20Cu31Mo9Ru HEA catalysts which possess rich (310) facets and a diagonal crystalline size of 38.5 nm is reported. Transmission electron microscopy measurements indicate cube-shaped nanocrystals are obtained first and further selective growth of pyramid on each facet of the cube-shaped nanocrystal results in a convex cube shape. Pt34Fe5Ni20Cu31Mo9Ru HEA catalysts show excellent electrocatalytic performance toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which exhibit a half-wave potential of 0.87 V for ORR in 0.1 m HClO4, and overpotential of 20 and 259 mV for HER and OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium. A control experiment and density functional theory calculation indicate that the Ru element plays a decisive role in both the formation of the convex cube shape and also the high catalytic performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000859097300001	36161488

Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results illustrate that surface oxygen vacancy can efficiently facilitate the electron transition across the forbidden band and enhance the surface adsorption ability with more negative adsorption energies of -0.82 to -2.85 eV for H2S and its fragments than that of 0.24 to -0.90 eV on the perfect surface. Importantly, the energy barrier is reduced by 1.58 eV in maximum along the reaction paths on the defected surface, and the changes of ratedetermining step lead to H-2 as the final product. In addition, the time-resolved fluorescence tests, photocurrent measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrate that the oxygen vacancies can effectively separate photo-generated electron-hole pairs. As a result, the photocatalytic activities of H-2 evolution from H2S on TiO2 {0 0 1} doped with oxygen vacancies have been significantly enhanced from 21.44 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) to 95.25 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). This enhanced photoactivity is due to the low recombination of photo-generated carriers, the favorable surface adsorption and reaction activity induced by oxygen vacancies.									18	4	0	0	1	0	18			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000531489100002

To resolve these issues, a new perovskite material, CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO), is proposed as an efficacious electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution/reduction reactions to develop zinc-air batteries (ZAB). Synthesis of this material adopted an effective oxalate route, which led to the purity in the electrocatalyst composition. The CCTO material is a proven potential candidate for energy applications because of its high dielectric permittivity (epsilon) and occupies an improved ORR-OER activity with better onset potential, current density, and stability. The Tafel value for CCTO was obtained out to be 80 mV dec(-1). The CCTO perovskite was also evaluated for the zinc-air battery as an air electrode, corresponding to the high specific capacitance of 801 mAh g(-1) with the greater cyclic efficiency and minimum variations in both charge/discharge processes. The highest power density (P-max) measured was 127 mW cm(-2). Also, the CCTO based paper battery shows an excellent performance achieving a specific capacity of 614 mAh g(-1). The obtained results promise CCTO as a potential and cheap electrocatalyst for energy applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2045-2322			WOS:000765922600020	35256700

Herein, crumpled Co3O4 and Co3O4/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with tunable 2D-in-3D structures were prepared by combining spray pyrolysis with a graphene oxide (GO) template. The 2D Co3O4 nanoplates were interconnected with each other to form a 3D ball with many wrinkles, resulting in defect enrichment on the abundant boundaries of the nanosheets, which provided more active sites for catalytic reactions. In addition, the unique 2D-in-3D structure allowed fast mass transfer and structural stability. Furthermore, the assembled structure could be understood as being composed of uniformly distributed oxygen-containing functional groups pinning metal cations on the GO surface through electrostatic interaction, and the 2D structure of the GO enabled the in situ converted Co3O4 to grow along the GO surface with excellent dispersion. Taking advantage of the above, the Co3O4/rGO balls demonstrated an excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance, an overpotential of 298 mV at a current density of 10.0 mA cm(-2) and a current density of 115.9 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of eta = 500 mV.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000536097300001	32217821

The porous Ni2P nanosheets exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low overpotential of 168 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH and a small Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1). The overpotential and Tafel slope of porous Ni2P nanosheets for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are 320 mV (10 mA cm(-2)) and 105 mV dec(-1), respectively. In addition, both the HER and OER measurements demonstrate that porous Ni2P nanosheets have superior electrochemical stability in alkaline solution. The desirable electrocatalytic properties of the porous Ni2P nanosheets may be due to their larger surface area and favorable electrical conductivity. The porous structures of the Ni2P nanosheets provide pathways for electron conduction, which facilitates electron transfer and accelerates bubble (H-2 and O-2) diffusion on the surface of the electrode.									103	8	0	0	5	0	104			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451380800044		
J	RICKERT, KW; SEARS, J; BECK, WF; BRUDVIG, GW								MECHANISM OF IRREVERSIBLE INHIBITION OF O2 EVOLUTION IN PHOTOSYSTEM-II BY TRIS(HYDROXYMETHYL)AMINOMETHANE								BIOCHEMISTRY				30	32			7888	7894		10.1021/bi00246a003				AUG 13 1991	1991	The dark reaction of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) with the O2-evolving center of photosystem II (PSII) in the S1 state causes irreversible inhibition of O2 evolution. Similar inhibition is observed for several other amines: NH3, CH3NH2, (CH3)2NH, ethanolamine, and 2-amino-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol. In PSII membranes, both depleted of the 17- and 23-kDa polypeptides and undepleted, the rate of reaction of Tris depends inversely upon the Cl- concentration. However, the rate of reaction of Tris is about 2-fold greater with PSII membranes depleted of the 17- and 23-kDa polypeptides than with undepleted PSII membranes. We have used low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to study the effect of Tris on the oxidation state of the Mn complex in the O2-evolving center, to monitor the electron-donation reactions in Tris-treated samples, and to observe any loss of the Mn complex (forming Mn2+ ions) after Tris treatment. We find that Tris treatment causes loss of electron-donation ability from the Mn complex at the same rate as inhibition Of O2 evolution and that Mn2+ ions are released. We conclude that Tris reduces the Mn complex to labile Mn2+ ions, without generating any kinetically stable, partially reduced intermediates, and that the reaction occurs at the Cl--sensitive site previously characterized in studies of the reversible inhibition Of O2 evolution by amines.									21	0	1	0	17	2	22			0006-2960			WOS:A1991GA94000003	1651110

Here, we developed a simple Ni foam self-templating route for V-doped Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays through in situ formation of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) combined with subsequent conversion. The as-prepared MOF-V-Ni3S2/NF catalyst delivers outstanding electrocatalytic performance in the alkaline solution, which requires low overpotentials of 118.1 mV @10 mA cm(-2) and 268 mV @10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. The V-doping and MOF-derived 3D hieratical nano structure play a vital role in the catalytic process, which provides efficient active sites and large surface areas. Furthermore, an alkaline electrolyzer was assembled with two pieces of MOF-V-Ni3S2/NF, which achieves efficient water splitting at 1.58 V @10 mA cm(-2). This strategy opens up new channels to synthesize MOF-based bifunctional electrocatalysts toward overall water spitting. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we synthesized nanoflower-shaped iron-nickel sulfide (FeNiS) over a nickel foam (NF) substrate using a facile hydrothermal method. The FeNiS electrode showed a high catalytic performance with a low overpotential value of 246 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), while it required 208 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The synthesized electrode exhibited a durable performance of up to 2000 cycles in stability and bending tests. The electrolyzer showed a lower cell potential requirement for a FeNiS-Pt/C system (1.54 V) compared to a standard benchmark IrO2-Pt/C system (1.56 V) to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). Furthermore, the FeNiS electrode demonstrated promising charge storage capabilities with a high areal capacitance of 13.2 F/cm(2). Our results suggest that FeNiS could be used for multifunctional energy applications such as energy generation (OER and HER) and storage (supercapacitor).									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2073-4344			WOS:000478652600004

However, their atomically precise structures remain undefined, complicating their optimization and limiting the understanding of their enhanced performance. Here, the underlying structure-property correlation is explored by using a well-defined cobalt-phosphate polyoxometalate cluster [{Co-4(OH)(3)(PO4)}(4)(SiW9O34)(4)](32-) (1), which may serve as a molecular model of multimetal hydr(oxy)oxides. The catalytic activity is enhanced upon replacing Co by Fe in 1, resulting in a reduced overpotential (385 mV) for oxygen evolution (by 66 mV) compared to that of the parent 1 at 10 mA cm(-2) in an acidic medium; this overpotential is comparable to that for the IrO2 catalyst. These abundant-metal-based polyoxometalates exhibit high stability, with no evidence of degradation even after 24 h of operation.

Herein, we deliberately designed novel Ag/WO3-x heterostructures through a supercritical CO2-assisted exfoliation-oxidation route and the subsequent loading of Ag nanoparticles. The ultrathin and oxygen vacancies-enriched WO3-x nanosheets are ideal substrates for loading Ag nanoparticles, which can largely increase the active site density and improve electron transport. Besides, the resultant WO3-x nanosheets with porous structure can form during the electrochemical cycling process induced by an electric field. As a result, the exquisite Ag/WO3-x heterostructures show an enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with a low onset overpotential of approximate to 30 mV, a small Tafel slope of approximate to 40 mV dec(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2), and as well as long-term durability. This work sheds light on material design and preparation, and even opens up an avenue for the development of high-efficiency electrocatalysts.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000493209500001	31631572

Herein, we report the facile synthesis of an amorphous film of the cerium doped cobalt oxide (CoOx(Ce)) and its prominent performance in catalysing the OER. The film was deposited by a scalable electrostatic spray deposition method. Cerium doping induces the variation of the crystal structure of cobalt oxide from crystalline to amorphous. Meanwhile, cerium-related oxygen vacancies were introduced with cerium doping, while the chemical state of the cobalt species was unmodified. These factors lead to a drastic increase in the electrochemical surface area and the intrinsic activity of the resultant CoOx(Ce) in the OER. As a consequence, the CoOx(Ce) shows a reduced activation energy of the OER. The amorphous CoOx(Ce) film produces a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 261 mV, and that of 100 mA cm(-2) at 302 mV. The performance is competitive to those of the reported electrocatalysts and commercially available RuO2.									51	1	0	0	0	0	52			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463819400021

Optimization of the calcination temperature has been performed to yield a single-phase HS-LSC. Rotating ring disk electrode measurements of HS-LSC in 0.1 M KOH exhibit two-fold higher (apex of limiting current is 4.974 mA cm(-2)) oxygen evolution reaction (OER) capability than that of the commercial RuO2 (1.84 mA cm(-2)). The excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and durability up to 5400 s of HS-LSC also registered as comparable to those of Pt/C. The organic medium OER and ORR activities of the catalyst were explored from a Li-O-2 battery perspective. The HS-LSC catalyst based Li-O-2 battery delivered a deep discharge capacity of similar to 4895 mA h g(-1) with high coulombic efficiency (similar to 82%), and rate capability. Excellent cycling stability is also evidenced for a limited capacity of 500 mA h g(-1). Unprecedentedly, the favourable structural and morphological features facilitate O-2 transport, electrolyte immersion and ion diffusion processes promoting the catalytic reaction kinetics on the electrode.									26	1	0	0	4	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000408592900033

Herein, we develop a novel porous 3D hybrid nanostructure decorated with nickel cobalt layered double hydroxides (NiCo LDHs) on the surface of the functional ZIF-67 template with rich oxygen vacancies (V-O) etched by O-2-Ar radio frequency (RF) plasma. The as-prepared NiCo LDH@ZIF-67-V-O/NF hybrid materials exhibit excellent OER performance evidenced by the competitive potential of 1.52 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline medium. Moreover, the Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1) is much lower compared to that of noble metal oxide and other counterpart catalysts. Our experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that incorporation of V-O into the NiCo LDH@ZIF-67-V-O/NF composite can efficiently tune the electronic structure and also increase the water adsorption energy, ultimately accelerating the OER process. The work presents a novel strategy for designing highly efficient composite electrode materials with rich oxygen vacancies for the effective, scalable electrocatalytic water oxidation.									48	3	0	0	4	0	49			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000460687400068

Herein, we demonstrate a glycine-assisted hydrothermal and probe sonication method for the synthesis of a mesoporous spherical La0.8Ce0.2Fe0.5Mn0.5O3 perovskite particle and embedded graphene nanosheet (LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS) composite and evaluate its bifunctional ORR/OER kinetics in Li-O-2 battery application. The physicochemical characterization confirms that the as-formed LCFM(8255)-gly perovskite catalyst has a highly crystalline structure and mesoporous morphology with a large specific surface area. The LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS composite hybrid structure exhibits an improved onset potential and high current density toward ORR/OER in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes. The LCFM(8255)-gly/GNS composite cathode (ca. 8475 mAh g(-1)) delivers a higher discharge capacity than the La0.5Ce0.5Fe0.5Mn0.5O3-gly/GNS cathode (ca. 5796 mAh g(-1)) in a Li-O-2 battery at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). Our results revealed that the composite's high electrochemical activity comes from the synergism of highly abundant oxygen vacancies and redox-active sites due to the Ce and Fe dopant in LaMnO3 and the excellent charge transfer characteristics of the graphene materials. The as-developed cathode catalyst performed appreciable cycle stability up to 55 cycles at a limited capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1) based on conventional glass fiber separators.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7				2079-4991		WOS:000643353300001	33923729

Fe(OH)(2)-Ni(OH)(2) and Fe(OH)(2)-Co(OH)(2) electrodes have been prepared through a urea-based chemical bath deposition (CBD) method that enables to control and optimize structure and loading. The effect of the spatial arrangement of the metals in the hydroxide deposits on the electrocatalytic activity in alkaline media has been evaluated. Ultrathin films formed by bilayers resulting from the deposition of submonolayer amounts of Ni or Co hydroxides on previously deposited Fe(OH)(2) layers were found to exhibit the best electrocatalytic behavior. The turnover frequency for O-2 generation increases drastically as the amount of either Ni or Co decreases, reaching maximum values 2.6 and 1.6 times higher than those for FTO/Ni(OH)(2) and FTO/Co(OH)(2) electrodes, respectively. This shows that the presence of underlying Fe(OH)(2) nanoparticles plays a crucial role in enhancing the electrocatalytic properties of Ni or Co sites. The fact that these ultrathin electrodes, formed by extremely small amounts of electrocatalysts, show good stability in alkaline media paves the way for their use as transparent electrodes or co-catalysts for water splitting photoanodes.

However, the kinetically slow and large energy-demanding procedures of oxygen electrocatalysis make the preparation of bifunctional catalysts difficult. In this work, we report a novel hierarchical GdFeO3 perovskite oxide of a spherelike nanostructure and surface modification with the group X heterometal oxides. The nanostructured GdFeO3 layer behaved as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in the oxygen electrocatalysis of OER and ORR. Moreover, the surface decoration with catalytically active PtOx + Ni/NiO nanoparticles enhanced the electrocatalytic performances substantially. Incorporation of mesoporous PtOx + Ni/NiO nanoparticles into the porous GdFeO3 nanostructure enlarged the electrochemically active surface area and provided the interconnected nanostructures to facilitate the OER/ORR. The nanostructures were visualized by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images, and the surface area and pore size of nanoparticles were analyzed from N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherms. Tafel analysis indicates that surface modification effectively improves the kinetics of oxygen reactions and accordingly increases the electrocatalytic efficiency. Finally, the 2 wt % PtOx + NiO vertical bar GdFeO3 (x = 0, 1, and 2) electrode achieved the enhanced OER performance with an overpotential of 0.19 Vat 10 mA/cm(2) in an alkaline solution and a high turnover frequency of 0.28 s(-1) at eta = 0.5 V. Furthermore, the ORR activity is observed with an onset potential of 0.80 V and a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.40 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000612551400060	33410321

Herein, a facile and effective hydro thermal route has been developed to synthesize hierarchical with controllable structures of manganese oxides (Mn2O3) and reduced graphene oxides supported Mn2O3 composites. The hierarchal metal oxides were formed by self-assembly of very small Mn2O3 nanoparticles as evident from transmission electron microscopy. The nature of chelating agents has found to be the key factor whose subtle variation can effectively control the morphology of the Mn2O3. Electrochemical investigations indicate that the both pure and supported Mn2O3 demonstrate bifunctional catalytic activity toward the four-electron electrochemical reduction of oxygen and evolution reaction in alkaline media. Due to the 3D assembled hierarchical architecture of Mn2O3 composed of rose- and petal-like nano-particle arrays and the interconnection of reduced graphene oxides (rGO) network, as well as the synergetic effects of rGO as a support, revealing the pronounce impact on the electrocatalytic activity the Mn2O3 composites with high current density and excellent durability as cathode material which is comparable with other electrocatalysts.

J	Katayanagi, Yuta; Yamazaki, Yohtaro								Effect of Fuel Flow Rate, Fuel Concentration, and O-2 Concentration of the Cathode Gas on the CO2 Evolution of a Direct Ethanol Fuel Cell								ELECTROCHEMISTRY				78	12			976	981		10.5796/electrochemistry.78.976				DEC 2010	2010	This paper presents an experimental study on anode reactions in direct ethanol fuel cells with the effect of cell operating conditions on the generation ratio of anode reaction products (i.e. carbon dioxide, acetic acid, and methane). Decreasing the ethanol concentration in the fuel increased the generation ratio of carbon dioxide. Additionally, lowering the fuel flow rate produced more carbon dioxide. Thus, we conducted a detailed experiment using acetaldehyde which is an intermediate product of the anode reaction of ethanol. Similar to using ethanol as a fuel, more carbon dioxide was produced at a lower fuel concentration and at a slower flow rate. Additionally, increasing the oxygen concentration in the cathode gas significantly increased the carbon dioxide generation ratio, which was likely because the oxygen from the cathode side reaches at the anode via the electrolyte membrane to promote the carbon dioxide production reaction. The amount of carbon dioxide produced greatly exceeded the amount of oxygen permeated, and comparing the amount of generated current with the amounts of acetic acid and carbon dioxide suggests that another oxide is present at the anode. The methane generation ratio was not affected by the oxygen concentration. It is assumed that the decreasing fuel concentration at the electrode surface due to a lower fuel flow rate increases the carbon dioxide generation ratio. Isotope analysis on the generated carbon dioxide confirmed that the detected carbon dioxide was due solely to the oxidation of fuel and not due to the oxidation of electrode materials such as the catalyst support.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1344-3542			WOS:000285273800004

To confirm their chemical and morphological properties, the as-prepared materials were methodically analyzed using solid state C-13 and N-15 NMR, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning and high resolution transmission electron microscopic techniques, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic activities of these electrocatalysts were thoroughly investigated under standard oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) conditions. The results show that all of the materials demonstrated significant activity in water splitting as well as displayed excellent stability (22 h) in both acidic (HER) and basic conditions (OER). Among the electrocatalysts reported in this study, Ni-ANIPOP-700 exhibited a lower overpotential eta(10) of 300 mV in basic medium (OER) and 150 mV in acidic medium (HER), as well as a lower Tafel slope of 69 mV/dec (OER) and 181 mV/dec (HER), indicating 30% lower energy requirement for overall water splitting.

Water splitting is a promising and appealing solution. In this work, we report Co(OH)(2) on the carbon nanotube/polyimide film (PI/CNT-Co(OH)(2)) as an efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The PI/CNT film allows intimate growth of Co(OH)(2) nanosheets on its surface. The nanosheet structure of Co(OH)(2) and the underlying PI/CNT film facilitate the good OER performance of the PI/CNT-Co(OH)(2) film. Co(OH)(2) nanosheets on the PI/CNT film afford an earlier onset of oxygen evolution, a low overpotential of 317 mV and a small Tafel slope of 49 mV per decade in alkaline media. This work applies the PI/CNT film in water splitting to enhance the OER electrocatalytic activity of Co(OH)(2), which opens up a promising avenue for the exploration of highly active electrocatalysts that can replace noble-metal based catalysts for the OER.									109	1	0	0	10	0	109			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000375799900025	27104298

The resulting NiFe-LDHs@MnO2 composite served as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, which combined the high catalytic activities of NiFe-LDHs for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and MnO2 for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), respectively. The as-fabricated NiFe-LDHs@MnO2 electrode manifests a high current density of 93 and 48 mA center dot cm(-2) recorded at 0.6 and - 0.3 V vs. Hg/HgO, respectively, comparable to that of commercial Pt/C catalyst (58 and 31 mA center dot cm(-2), respectively). Moreover, such a composite can serve as an air electrode in the rechargeable zinc-air battery. The as-assembled zinc-air battery using NiFe-LDHs@MnO2 cathode exhibits a discharge voltage at 1.08-1.15 V and charge voltage at 2.05-2.11 V after a cycle of 42 h at 25 mA center dot cm(-2), demonstrating a desired cycling stability.

Herein we report an improved scaffold concept to simultaneously stabilize the catalyst against particle growth and reduce the adverse effects of cell reversal by modifying Pt/C with suitable protic ionic liquids (PILs). The modified Pt/C catalysts show enhanced cell reversal tolerance because of their high activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER), up to 300 mV lower overpotential compared to the unmodified Pt/C. Moreover, the PIL modified catalysts show better resistance to the loss of electrochemical surface area (ECSA) under simulated cell reversal conditions. The results indicate that modification of Pt/C catalysts with PILs is a promising strategy to enhance the stability and durability of electrocatalysts in fuel cell applications with the risk of frequent fuel starvation events, such as automotive fuel cells.

In this work, we studied the effect of the disaccharide trehalose, which is unique in its physicochemical properties, on isolated PS 2 complex. It was found that trehalose significantly stimulated the steady-state rate of oxygen evolution. The study of single flash-induced fluorescence decay kinetics demonstrated that trehalose did not affect the rate of Q (A) (-) oxidation, although it led to an increase in the relative fractions of PS 2 reaction centers capable of Q (A) (-) oxidation. Trehalose also prevented PS 2 complexes from being inactivated on prolonged storage. We propose that in the presence of trehalose, which affects the extent of hydration, the protein can preferentially exist in a more optimal conformation for effective functioning.									14	0	0	0	14	0	14			0006-2979	1608-3040		WOS:000348148500007	25754040

In this work, Mo-/Ni-/Fe-based ternary transition-metal composites are uniformly anchored on the hierarchical nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs)/carbon cloth (CC) via a one-pot hydrothermal process, followed by hydrogenation and sulfurization to obtain the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts, respectively. The rationally designed hybrids with various crystalline structures, heteroatom dopants, and large accessible surface areas can form abundant heterojunction interfaces and rich active defects to adjust the local electronic structure and intrinsic electrocatalytic capability. Therefore, the H- MoNiFe/N-CNTs-2 electrode reveals a low OER overpotential of 259.0 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 44.3 mV dec(-1), while the S-MoNiFe/N-CNTs-1 electrode exhibits a good HER overpotential of 130.7 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the electrolysis device exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.58 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and maintains excellent catalytic activity under a high current for 12 h. This work provides a simple but rational composite electrode construction strategy with broad application prospects for electrocatalytic reactions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0888-5885			WOS:000693080800009

Here, Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2 film with micrometer thickness on bulk substrate was synthesized by a simple one-step hydrothermally assisted sulfurization of Ni3Fe alloy foam for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in basic media. Benefiting from the synergetic effect of the bicomponent, reduced interfacial resistance between electrocatalyst and metal substrate, and more exposed catalytic sites on the microstructured film, the as-prepared electrocatalyst (Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2Ni3Fe) behaves as a highly efficient and robust oxygen evolution electrode with felicitous current density in alkaline electrolytes (1 M KOH). It requires an overpotential of only 264 mV to drive 100 mA cm(-2) with its catalytic activity being maintained for at least 20 h in 1 M KOH. In the near future, this kind of synthesis strategy can be easily extended to investigate many electrocatalysts derived from 3D alloyed foam with various ratios of the different components, opening new avenue for understanding the relationship between material properties and electrochemical performance.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2046-2069			WOS:000466754600041	35520944

Unexpectedly, sodium peroxide is detected in the cubic-shaped discharge deposits associated with the often reported sodium superoxide. Analyses on the product distribution show a surface layer rich in decomposition products in contact with an O-deficient region enclosing the bulk of these cubes. In addition, we show that oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurs by a process that involves oxidation and re-dissolution of the bulk fraction, leading to a contraction of the discharge particles and a composition similar to that found in the intermediate phase of the deposits observed at the end of discharge. All these solid compounds are eventually removed at the end of recharge, but formation of these structures evidence possible irreversible pathways that need to be considered for the cycle life improvement.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000402704500025

In this work, we have successfully synthesized a multifunctional two-dimensional rare earth-based LaOCl@hcp-Ni heterostructure via a simple one-pot method. Here, the semiconductor LaOCl nanoparticles were well deposited on the metastable metal hcp-Ni, and the hexagonal close-packed structure of hcp-Ni matched the layered-structure LaOCl to form a highly active LaOCl@hcp-Ni Schottky catalyst. Furthermore, LaOCl@hcp-Ni were tested for Photoelectrochemical (PEC) oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media and the photocatalytic (PC) degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) in aqueous solution. LaOCl@hcp-Ni shows excellent PEC-OER catalytic activity and RhB degradation performance under artificial simulated sunlight. This enhancement of PEC and PC performance is due to the Schottky interface constructed by the coupling of hcp-Ni and LaOCl, which generates an interface electric field to effectively promote the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the semiconductor LaOCl to the metal hcp-Ni through the interface. Thus, energy band gap of LaOCl with oxygen defects is adjusted to the visible light region and their valence state of La is lowered, realizing high-efficiency visible light catalytic activity. Thus, it would be a potential rare earth-based Schottky catalyst, which can be used for the PEC oxygen evolution and the PC degradation of organic pollutants.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000797217800005

One of them involves the photocatalytic conversion of solar energy into the storable fuel molecular hydrogen via the water splitting process utilizing metal-oxide semiconductors as catalysts. Since photocatalytic water splitting is still a rather poorly understood reaction, fundamental research in this field is required.Herein, the photocatalytic activity for water splitting was investigated utilizing La-doped NaTaO3 as a model photocatalyst. The activity of La-doped NaTaO3 was assessed by the determination of the overall quantum yield of molecular hydrogen and molecular oxygen evolution. In pure water La-doped NaTaO3 exhibits rather poor activity for the photocatalytic H2 evolution whereby no O2 was detected.To enhance the photocatalytic activity the surface of La-doped NaTaO3 was modified with various cocatalysts including noble metals (Pt, Au and Rh) and metal oxides (NiO, CuO, CoO, AgO and RuO2). The photocatalytic activity was evaluated in pure water, in aqueous methanol solution, and in aqueous silver nitrate solution. The results reveal that cocatalysts such as RuO2 or CuO exhibiting the highest catalytic activity for H2 evolution from pure water, possess, however, the lowest activity for O2 evolution from aqueous silver nitrate solution.La-doped NaTaO3 modified with Pt shows the highest quantum yield of 33 % with respect to the H2 evolution in the presence of methanol. To clarify the role of methanol in such a photocatalytic system, long-term investigations and isotopic studies were performed. The underlying mechanisms of methanol oxidation were elucidated.

However, this technique requires electrolytes with low pH. All oxygen evolving electrodes working durably and actively in acids contain IrOx. Due to their scarcity and high acquisition costs, noble elements like Pt, Ru and Ir need to be replaced by earth abundant elements. We have evaluated a cobalt containing steel for use as an oxygen-forming electrode in H2SO4. We found that the dissolving of ingredients out of the steel electrode at oxidative potential in sulfuric acid, which is a well-known, serious issue, can be substantially reduced when the steel is electro-oxidized in LiOH prior to electrocatalysis. Under optimized synthesis conditions a cobalt-containing tool steel was rendered into a durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst (weight loss: 39 mu g mm(-2) after 50 000 s of chronopotentiometry at pH 1) that exhibits overpotentials down to 574 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density at pH 1. Focused ion beam SEM (FIB-SEM) was successfully used to create a structure-stability relationship.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000416825000024	29115339

Amorphous cobalt-manganese sulfide electrode for efficient water oxidation: Meeting the fundamental requirements of an electrocatalyst								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				405						126993	10.1016/j.cej.2020.126993				FEB 1 2021	2021	Design and development of efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remain a challenge due to high overpotential, low stability, and scalability issues. As a realistic solution, herein, amorphous (Co-Mn)S tailored into nanosheets is demonstrated as a highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst for OER. Thin films of (Co-Mn)S are deposited on stainless steel (SS) substrates via a scalable successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method for the first time. The stoichiometric tuning of composition has effectively augmented the electrocatalytic activity and OER performance by modification of electronic structure and binding strength with the intermediates. The tailored nanosheet like morphology resulted in achieving high current density at low overpotential. Benefited from the synergy of redox chemical properties and a binder-free deposition, (Co3Mn2)S thin film electrocatalyst achieved a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 243 mV in 1 M KOH electrolyte. On top of that, the electrocatalyst displayed excellent stabilities over 100 h of continuous water oxidation without any apparent change. In view of the simple yet scalable approach of synthesis, and excellent OER performance, amorphous (Co-Mn)S thin film electrocatalyst could be deliberated as a promising candidate for large application of OER.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000698115400011

However, the wide application of these ZABs is seriously hindered by the high cost and poor electrochemical stability of noble electrocatalysts. In this paper, we develop a facile method to prepare ultra-small iron-based nitride and nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (Fe2N/N-CNTs) hybrid materials as bifunctional electrocatalysts for ZABs. In the presence of CNTs with large surface areas, ultra-small Fe2N nanoparticles with the diameter of around 5 nm are successfully prepared. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Fe2N/N-CNTs is comparable to the Pt/C, while the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity is much better than the Pt/C. At last, the home-made ZABs with Fe2N/N-CNTs have significant rechargeable activities and cyclic stability. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

J	Zhang, Lei; Bi, Hai; Wang, Zhaoyang; Zhou, Gang								Insight into enhanced hydrogen evolution of single-atom Cu-1/TiO2 catalysts from first principles								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				47	7			4653	4661		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.115				JAN 22 2022	2022	Developing efficient catalysts of low-cost transition metals for hydrogen production is of great importance but remains a huge challenge. Motivated by the idea of engineering local atomic configuration, we propose to focus on single metal atom confined in the lattice oxygen environment, as a class of non-Pt catalysts for hydrogen production. By first principles calculations, we study the characteristics and mechanism of hydrogen evolution reaction of single-atom Cu supported on anatase TiO2 catalysts, Cu1/TiO2. Cu preferentially sits on the bridge-centre site between two 2-fold coordinated O atoms (O2c) on the surface. Cu and coordinated O2c function as copper oxide species (-Cu-O-) in the reaction. The reaction starts with two isolated H respectively positioned on Cu and O2c, proceeds with a transfer of H from O2c to Cu, and eventually forms a H2 molecule. The free energy profiles indicate that Cu1/TiO2 exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution activity even better than Pt and MoS2. This study not only shows that single-atom Cu1/TiO2 is an excellent hydrogen evolution catalyst, but also expands the understanding of oxide species in single-atom catalysis and proposes an engineering local atomic configuration strategy for optimizing the design of single-atom catalysts for enhanced hydrogen production.

However, designing and fabricating efficient electrocatalysts still remains challenging. By confinedly coordinating organic ligands with metal species in layered double hydroxides (LDHs), an innovative LDHs-assisted approach is developed to facilely synthesize freestanding bimetallic 2D metal-organic framework nanosheets (2D MOF NSs), preserving the metallic components and activities in OER. Furthermore, the research has demonstrated that the incorporation of carboxyl organic ligands coordinated with metal atoms as proton transfer mediators endow 2D MOF NSs with efficient proton transfer during the electrochemical OHads -> O-ads transition. These freestanding NiFe-2D MOF NSs require a small overpotential of 260 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). When this strategy is applied to LDH nanosheets grown on nickel foam, the overpotential can be reduced to 221 mV. This outstanding OER activity supports the capability of multimetallic organic frameworks for the rational design of water oxidation electrocatalysts. This strategy provides a universal path to the synthesis of 2D MOF NSs that can be used as electrocatalysts directly.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000803007900001	35638469

Herein, we put forward a general and controllable synthetic strategy to produce a series of hierarchical-structured porous Co-Ni bimetallic oxides (CoNiOx)viafacile topochemical transformation from various Co-Ni bimetallic coordination polymers. Our newly developed protocol can realize simultaneous manipulation over the chemical composition and architectural structure, thereby achieving abundant synergistically active sites, optimized electronic configuration, and favorable mass transfer for catalysis. With the above features, the resulting CoNiO(x)could manifest remarkable electrocatalytic performance towards the oxygen evolution catalysis, competing against the state-of-the-art transition metal-based catalysts reported to date and the noble metal benchmarks. This work presents a simple, yet an effective and comprehensive methodology to develop advanced noble metal-free OER electrocatalysts for future energy systems.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2052-1553			WOS:000552336100002

These nanoparticles showed excellent catalytic activity, giving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials (eta) of 300 and 330 mV for Ni(OH)(2) and NiOx, respectively. The catalytic activity was comparable to that of the best mixed metal oxide catalysts under the same conditions.

A Ni/NiCo2O4 composite coating was prepared by composite electrodeposition in a Ni plating solution by mixing with NiCo2O4 powder. The best plating conditions for the composite electrodeposition were investigated by changing factors such as the plating bath pH and the cathode current density j(k). The surface morphology, the NiCo2O4 content, and the structure of the Ni/NiCo2O4 composite coating were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). As a result, the NiCo2O4 content in the Ni/NiCo2O4 composite coating was found to be the highest (30.6%, w) for a bath pH of 6.2 and a cathodic current density j(k) of 100 mA . cm(-2). In 5 mol . L-1 KOH solution the electrocatalytic properties toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the Ni/NiCo2O4 composite electrode was studied using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical steady-state polarization, and electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS). Compared with the Ni electrode, the electrocatalytic properties for the OER of the Ni/NiCo2O4 composite electrode improved greatly and the apparent activation energy was reduced to 53.2 kJ . mol(-1). The apparent exchange current density of the Ni/NiCo2O4 composite electrode toward the OER was 7 times as high as that of a nickel electrode. An electrochemical impendence spectroscopy analysis indicated that the oxygen evolution reaction of the Ni/NiCo2O4 composite electrode was co-controlled by an electrochemical step and a diffusion step. Constant potential electrolysis over extended periods for the OER shows that the stability of the Ni/NiCo2O4 composite electrode is good.									8	13	0	0	0	0	15			1000-6818			WOS:000298618200019

For the development of sustainable energy, exploring cost-effective non-precious metal materials has therefore become an urgent task. As one of the promising candidates, the hybrid of transition metal sulfide and carbon-nitrogen skeleton attracts great attention due to variability, graded pore structure and high conductivity. Herein, a sustainable multifunctional electrocatalytic material has been designed and achieved by in-situ encapsulating Co9S8/Co in N-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT). Efficient multifunctional electrocatalysis towards oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions are realized. This work highlights the importance of rich Co-N and Co-N-C coupling centers generated by in-situ engineering transition metal sulfide into carbon-nitrogen skeleton for multifunctional catalytic conversion of sustainable energy. The results here may also be instructive for designing other complexes with perspective for catalysis, sensing, energy storage and conversion. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We present a kinetic modeling and simulation study of the lithium-oxygen cell cycling behavior. The model includes a multistep reaction mechanism of the cell reaction (2Li + O-2 reversible arrow Li2O2) forming lithium peroxide by precipitation, coupled to a 1D porous-electrode transport model. We apply the model to study the asymmetric discharge/charge characteristics and analyze the influence of a redox mediator dissolved hornogeneouSly in the liquid electrolyte. Model predictions are compared to experimental galvanostatic cycling data of cells without and with 2,2,6,6-tetratnethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) as redox mediator. The predicted discharge behavior shows good agreement with the experimental results. A spatiotemporal analysis of species concentrations reveals inhomogeneous distributions of dissolved oxygen and reaction products within the cathode during discharge: The experimentally observed charge overpotentials as well as their reduction by using a redox mediator can be qualitatively reproduced with a partially irreversible-reaction mechanism. However, the proposed models fail to reproduce the particular shape of the experimental charge curve with continuously increasing charge overpotential, which implies that part of the reaction mechanism is still open for investigation in future work.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			1932-7447			WOS:000387198400014

Physicochemical studies (IR and XRD) indicated the formation of almost pure spinel phase of the oxide. Morphological structure in the form of film on Ni-support was observed to be the same except CoFe2O4, which showed some aggregation on the surface of support. For electrochemical characterizations, the oxide powder was transfered to film electrode on the pre-treated Ni- support. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) recorded in 1M KOH at 25 degrees C in the potential region 0.0-0.7 V showed a pair of redox peaks, one anodic (E-Pa=512 +/- 12mV) and corresponding cathodic (E-Pc=359 +/- 10mV), prior to oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The anodic polarization study showed that the substitution of Co for Fe in the Fe3O4 lattice marginally improved the electrocatalytic activity of the materials and it is found to the greatest with 0.5 mol Co-substitution. The substitution of Co increased the Tafel slope value, but the order of reaction was almost unity with each electrocatalyst. The standard electrochemical enthalpy of activation (Delta H-el degrees#), standard enthalpy of activation (Delta H degrees(#)) and standard entropy of activation (Delta S degrees(#)) have been determined by recording the anodic polarization at different temperatures. The value of Delta H-el degrees(#) was found to be minimum with most active Co0.5Fe2.5O4 electrode.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1480-2422	2292-1168		WOS:000571433600005

The earth-abundant perovskite catalysts based on LaNiO3-delta show promise in OER catalysis because of their relatively low cost and their optimal electronic structure but suffer from low electrode-area normalized activity. In this work, we partially substituted La with Sr and Ni with Fe to enable a remarkably high OER activity with an ultra-low overpotential of 374 +/- 3 mV vs RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) normalized by electrode geometric area. This performance even surpasses the performance of benchmark RuO2. Our results show that Sr could promote OER-active sites including Ni (III), O-2(2-)/O-, and optimal Ni/Fe ratios, which significantly improve the surface intrinsic activity at the perovskite surface. Therefore, this work not only developed a highly efficient earth-abundant catalyst towards OER, but also demonstrated the effective modulation of catalyst surface interactions through A-site doping for perovskite oxides for key applications such as water splitting, CO2 electrochemical reduction and N-2 electrochemical fixations.

Increasingly challenging transformations can be accomplished only by means of certain metal catalysts. However, there still remains the need for a substantial decrease of the amount of catalyst, for better reuse or recycling of such active species, and for the avoidance of relatively toxic solvents in favour of environmentally friendly media. These facts apply to copper-, palladium-, and nickel-catalysed cross-coupling reactions, direct arylations, and oxidative processes.

However, as a result of the structural complexity of spinel oxides, systematic and in-depth studies on enhancing the OER performance of spinel oxides remain inadequate. In particular, the construction of active sites regarding the large number of unoccupied octahedral interstices has not yet been explored. Herein, more octahedral sites with high OER activities are constructed on the surface of spinel oxides via a cationic misalignment, which is induced by the defects in the spinel oxide solutions, i.e., MoFe2O4 and CoFe2O4 nanosheets supported on an iron foam (MCFO NS/IF). With increased active sites and modified electronic structure, the state-of-the-art electrocatalyst exhibits the excellent OER catalytic activity with an onset potential of 1.41 V versus RHE and an overpotential of 290 mV to achieve a current density of 500 mA cm(-2).

Ce-based MOF-76 (Metal Organic-Framework-76 family, formed by lanthanide ions coordinated to 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid ligand - H3BTC or simply BTC) was prepared with different percentages of graphene oxide (GO) in situ (named Ce-BTC-GO(X%)), then calcined to CeO2-rGO(X%). All obtained materials were characterized by physicochemical techniques. The presence of carbonaceous matrices in the composites improves their thermal stability, alters particles shape, and decreases their size. All materials underwent Cyclic Voltammetry tests and selected composites were evaluated by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, Hydrogen Evolution Reaction and Oxygen Evolution Reaction. The electron transfer between Ce3+/Ce4+ redox pairs is observed around 1.3 and 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl(sat.KCl) for oxidation and reduction, respectively. Among all produced materials, the Ce-BTC-GO(30%) presented the best electrochemical response, reaching 0.506 A g(-1) of anodic current and 19.92 C g(-1) of charge density. Its capacitance reaches 3340.8 mu F cm(-2), while its resistance to charge transfer decreases (2.4 Omega cm(2)) and Tafel equation slopes are 84.3 mV dec(-1) for HER and 60.5/127.9 mV dec(-1) for OER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1293-2558	1873-3085		WOS:000598852600007

The development of the scrolls is monitored by imaging the wave evolution cia a video camera and image acquisition software. Solutions for which the initial waves are initiated under an atmosphere of pure oxygen have a subexcitable or inhibited layer of typically 1 mm depth. Once the O-2 is replaced by N-2, this layer regains excitability and a scroll wave structure can develop. For waves initiated under air, the depth of the inhibited layer is less and scroll waves do not develop. A simple extension of the ZBKE model for the ferroin system is proposed and shown to predict the oxygen inhibition in reasonable agreement with experiment.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1463-9076			WOS:000079406000012

Understanding the direct correlations between the surface morphological evolution of catalytic cathodes at nanoscale and their catalytic activity during cycling has proved challenging. Here, using in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy, the dynamic evolution of the Pt nanoparticles electrode in a working Li-O-2 battery and its effects on the Li-O-2 interfacial reactions are visualized. In situ views show that repeated oxidation-reduction cycles (ORCs) trigger the increase in the size of Pt nanoparticles, eventually causing the Pt nanoparticles to fall off the electrode. In 0-80 ORCs, the grown Pt nanoparticles promote the conversion of the Li-O-2 reaction route from the surface-mediated pathway to the solution-mediated pathway during discharging and significantly increase the discharge capacity. After 250 ORCs, accompanied by the part of the Pt nanoparticles detaching from the electrode, the nucleation potential of reaction product decreases, and the reaction dynamic slows down, which cause the performance to degrade. Modification of a proper amount of Au nanoparticle on the Pt nanoparticles electrode could improve its stability and maintain the high catalytic activity. These results provide a direct evidence for clarifying the correlations between morphological evolution and surface reactivity of catalytic cathodes during cycling, which is critical for developing high-performance catalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000730353700001	34874155

Tuning composition and configuration of HEMs provides untapped opportunities for accessing better catalytic performance. Herein, we report three amorphous high-entropy transition metal oxides catalysts with uniform composition through a simple and control-lable liquid phase non-equilibrium reduction method. The self-made catalyst FeCoNiMnBOx exhibits excellent oxygen evolution performance, including a low overpotential (266 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), small Tafel slope (64.5 mV dec(-1)) and extremely high stability (only 3.71% increase of potential after 100 h test and no current decay after cyclic voltammetry of 31,000 cycles). The outstanding performance can be attributed to the in-situ electrochemical activation induced surface reconstruction to form a stable oxy-hydroxide surface layer, the cocktail effect (multi-metal synergy) brought by high entropy, and the advantages of amorphous structure itself. The outstanding catalytic properties of the new high-entropy amorphous metal oxide, as well as its advantages of low cost and simple preparation, suggest its great potential in water splitting.

Cobalt nitride (CoN) exhibits strong catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, its poor catalytic efficiency for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) hinders its application in rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) as the air cathode. In this work, we deploy the effective strategy of Mn doping to improve both OER and ORR activity of CoN nanowires as the cathode material for ZAB. Theoretical calculation predicts that moderate Mn doping in cobalt nitride results in a downshift of the d-band center and reduces the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates. With similar to 10 at% Mn dopants, stronger catalysis activities for both OER and ORR are achieved compared to pure CoN nanowires. Subsequently, both aqueous and flexible quasi-solid-state ZABs are constructed using the Mn-doped CoN nanowires array as additive-free air cathode. Both types of devices present large open circuit potential, high power density and long-cycle stability. This work pushes forward the progress in developing cost-effective ZABs.									24	1	0	0	1	0	23			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000528307100002

The nanofibers were calcined at different temperatures. All CoFe2O4 nanofibers show excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. The nanofibers calcined at 750 degrees C have a multi-particle nanochain structure. The nanochain exhibits excellent catalytic performance for OER in 1 M KOH (pH = 14) producing a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 0.34 V, and the small onset potential of 1.32 V versus RHE, better than that of the commercial Ir/C (20%) catalyst. Furthermore, the stability of CoFe2O4 multi-particle nanochains toward the OER decreases by only 0.78% even after a long period of 80 000 s. Our finding suggests that CoFe2O4 nanofibers with a multi-particle nanochain structure could serve as a new group of OER electrocatalysts with excellent performance.									41	2	0	0	1	0	41			2046-2069			WOS:000424024200031	35542389

Herein, iron-doped nickel cobalt phosphide nanoplate arrays grown on a carbon cloth (NiCoFexP/CC) are fabricated using a simple hydrothermal route, followed by phosphorization. The electrochemical analysis demonstrates that the NiCoFexP/CC electrode possesses high electrocatalytic activity for water splitting in alkaline medium. Benefits from the synergistic effect between the metal centers, two-dimensional porous nanoplates, and unique three-dimensional electrode configuration of NiCoFexP/CC provide small over potentials of 39 at 10 mA cm(-2) and 275 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. Furthermore, the assembled two-electrode (NiCoFexP/ CC iiNiCoFe(x)P/CC) alkaline water electrolyzer can achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density at 1.51 V. Remarkably, it can maintain stable electrolysis over 150 h. The excellent activity and stability of this catalyst is proved to be a economical substitute of commercial noble metal-based catalysts in technologies relevant to renewable energy.									90	6	0	0	0	0	93			2168-0485			WOS:000431927500053

However, the peroxide intermediate formed during the OER process could react with tungsten oxide to produce soluble species, thereby severely limiting its application. Herein, we construct Ir-W@Ir-WO3-x core-shell nanoparticles with an Ir-W metallic core and an Ir-doped WO3-x (Ir-WO3-x) shell, which can deliver an impressive overpotential of 261 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for acidic OER catalysis and extraordinary catalytic stability. Spectroscopic analysis manifests that Ir-W@Ir-WO3-x could substantially suppress peroxide species formation and effectively avoid peroxide-induced corrosion during the OER process. Theoretical studies reveal that the moderate O-binding capability on Ir-W@Ir-WO3-x not only accelerates catalytic kinetics, but also restrains hydroperoxide formation. This work sheds light on the rational design of OER catalysts by modulating the adsorption behavior of oxygen-containing intermediates.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2052-1537		WOS:000668352700001

High-ordered mesoporous monometallic or bimetallic tungstates are first synthesized via a soft template method combined with pH regulation of the reaction solution. The addition of buffer solution not only changes the phase composition but also adjusts the hydrolysis and condensation rate to promote the formation of a mesoporous structure with the help of the template. Mesoporous cobalt-doped iron tungstates deliver 320 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1), due to transformation of phase, the existence of a mesoporous structure, and the synergistic effect of metallic cations. Herein, it is confirmed that the simplicity and feasibility of rational structure design and purposive phase regulation provide vast opportunities and strategies for the research of novel oxygen evolution catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000512433500001

Herein, we developed a simple template-free approach to three-dimensional porous carbon networks codoped with nitrogen and phosphorus by pyrolysis of a supermolecular aggregate of self-assembled melamine, phytic acid, and graphene oxide (MPSA/GO). The pyrolyzed MPSA/GO acted as the first metal-free bifunctional catalyst with high activities for both oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution. Zn-air batteries with the pyrolyzed MPSA/GO air electrode showed a high peak power density (310Wg(-1)) and an excellent durability. Thus, the pyrolyzed MPSA/GO is a promising bifunctional catalyst for renewable energy technologies, particularly regenerative fuel cells.									654	47	0	0	28	0	668			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000369854700054	26709954

For seawater deoxygenation, acidic, neutral, or alkaline anolytes can be used. The effects of acidic, alkaline, and neutral buffered and non-buffered anolytes were studied in two compartment deoxygenation cells. The pH, conductivity, H2O2 production, and current were measured throughout the experiments. The optimum applied potentials for oxygen reduction were between 1.9 V-2.2 V, giving water as product; reducing the applied potential also resulted in the formation of H2O2. Analysis after the experiments using a scanning electron microscope with electron-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed that both the silver mesh and the cation exchange membrane remained stable during the experiments. The use of alkaline anolytes resulted in the maximum oxygen removal with minimal side reactions in the cell.									1	0	1	0	0	0	2				2076-3417		WOS:000451302800270

Furthermore, the development of these catalysts is of great importance in terms of energy security and solution of the environmental problems. To meet these requirements, herein, we describe the synthesis of a Ni-ion doped Birnessite@Cryptomelane (Ni2+/B@Cr) hybrid structure as a bifunctional efficient catalyst for the OER in neutral media and degradation of dye pollutants. The Ni2+/B@Cr catalyst exhibited a sharp onset potential at 390 mV (vs. RHE) and achieved a current density of 1 mA cm(-2) at a low q of 430 mV with a Tafel slope of similar to 96 mV dec(-1). The results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies indicated that Ni intercalation into birnessite layer and heterostructure of the hybrid electrocatalyst Ni2+/B@Cr increased the conductivity by lowering the resistance of charge transfer (R-ct = 4.82 Omega) and oxygen evolution processes (R-OER = 4.13 Omega). The durability assay identified Ni2+/B@Cr as stable electrocatalyst with 10% loss of activity after long-term stability tests (10 h, under 500-mV overpotential). In addition, the Ni2+/B@Cr achieved high (86.67 s(-1) g(-1)) and rapid (173 s) catalytic performance for the reduction of methylene blue (MB). Overall, this paper presents a low-cost production strategy for the design of highly efficient bifunctional catalysts, offering boosted electrocatalytic and degradation performance for water oxidation and organic dye contamination, respectively.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0268-2605	1099-0739		WOS:000692163700001

Samples investigated include the A-site cation deficient (La0.8Sr0.2)(0.95)MnO3-delta (ALSM) and the A-site cation deficient with the B-site cobalt-doped (La0.8Sr0.2)(1-x)Mn1-xCoxO3-delta (x = 0.05 and 0.1 for LSMC5 and LSMC10, respectively). X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) aided in physical characterizations. Electrochemical properties were tested in 0.1 M KOH solution by cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Our results indicate as compared to LSM, the lattice-shrunk ALSM with high oxygen vacancy displays enhanced OER performance, but its inferior ORR activity could be caused by reduced crystallinity. LSMC5 and LSMC10 show lowest total overpotential (0.93 and 0.91 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3.5 M)) with slightly less efficient ORR, despite their superior specific kinetic current density. Oxygen vacancy induces Fermi level upshift and reduced resistivity, while Co-doping increases orbital hybridization and enhances charge transfer. Understanding how the A-site non-stoichiometry and the B-site doping influence the B-O covalence is the key to the rational design of perovskite bifunctional oxygen catalysts. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Coupling FeNi alloys with hollow nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks results in exceptionally high electrocatalytic oxygen reduction and evolution activities. In 1 M KOH, the resulting new material exhibits a superior oxygen evolution activity with a low overpotential of 250 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) current density, at which the obtained oxygen reduction performance is also comparable to that of commercial Pt/C and the half-wave potential reaches as high as 0.87 V. As a result, the bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis performance thus obtained (0.61 V, 1 M KOH) ranks among the best of non-precious oxygen electrocatalysts. Using this new catalyst as an air electrode, the as-prepared rechargeable Zn-air battery shows a high current density of 215 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.0 V, large peak power density (310 mW cm(-2)), high potential efficiency (64.7% at 10 mA cm(-2)) and prolonged operation durability. This approach provides a means to control the surface features, thereby tuning the catalytic properties of the material, and may open up new possibilities for the rational design and synthesis of new materials for electrochemical applications.									28	1	0	0	1	0	28			2398-4902			WOS:000453816900024

Moreover, state of the art OER catalysts contain high amounts of expensive and low abundance noble metals such as Ru and Ir, limiting their large-scale industrial utilization. Therefore, the development of low-cost, highly active, and stable OER catalysts is a key requirement toward the implementation of a hydrogen-based economy. We have developed a synthetic approach to high surface-area chlorine-free iridium oxide nanoparticles dispersed in titania (IrO2-TiO2), which is a highly active and stable OER catalyst in acidic media. IrO2-TiO2 was prepared in one step in molten NaNO3 (Adams fusion method) and consists of ca. 1-2 nm IrO2 particles distributed in a matrix of titania nanoparticles with an overall surface area of 245 m(2) g(-1). This material contains 40 mol(M) % of iridium and demonstrates improved OER activity and stability in comparison to the commercial benchmark catalyst and state of the art high-surface-area IrO2. Ex situ characterization of the catalyst indicates the presence of iridium hydroxo surface species, which were previously associated with the high OER activity. Operando X-ray absorption studies demonstrate the evolution of the surface species as a function of the applied potential, suggesting the conversion of the initial hydroxo surface layer to the oxo-terminated surface via anodic oxidation (OER regime).									183	2	0	0	2	0	184			2155-5435			WOS:000398986700011

Recently, amorphous transition metal borides (TMBs) as OER pre-catalysts have acquired growing attention due to their favorable characteristics such as high conductivity, compositional and structural flexibility. Nevertheless, rational design of boride-based OER pre-catalysts remains an ongoing challenge. Herein, an efficient pre-catalyst derived from FeB with accelerated surface reconstruction and regulated intrinsic activity of evolved FeOOH is obtained by W and P co-doping. The obtained catalyst demonstrates an excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 209 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and good stability in alkaline electrolyte, which surpasses most of boride-based OER catalysts. Specifically, the anion etching facilitates the surface reconstruction and accelerates the mass/charge transfer. Density functional theory calculations suggest W doping can enhance intrinsic catalytic activity via optimizing the adsorption free energy of reaction intermediates and improving the conductivity. Additionally, the hierarchical structure and amorphous feature also benefit the OER process. This study provides a fundamental insight into the correlation between surface structure and catalytic activity, and a powerful strategy to construct efficient OER pre-catalysts.									46	3	0	0	2	0	47			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000627348400001

Benefitting from the synergistic effect between the robust hollow frameworks and in-situ grown dual-sided N-doped carbon nanotubes, the FNCHF electrocatalyst presents enhanced mass/electron transport with high structural stability. As a result, the FNCHFs based bifunctional oxygen electrode demonstrates a desirable oxygen electrocatalytic activity and stability with a half-wave po-tential of 0.863 V for oxygen reduction and an overpotential of 340 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution. The corresponding ZAB exhibits a high peak power density of 206 mW cm(-2), a high specific capacity of 781 mAh g(Zn)(-1), and a good cycling stability more than 300 h.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000854093600004

The structure characterizations indicated that 0D Fe-CQDs are evenly dispersed onto the NiMoO(4)sheets of the arrays. The contact angle analysis confirmed that the surface hydrophilia of the arrays is improved after the 0D Fe-CQDs are deposited 3D on the NiMoO(4)sheets. Here, both the activity and durability in electrochemical water splitting are significantly enhanced with the Fe-CQDs/NiMoO4/NF catalysts. At a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the resultant Fe-CQDs/NiMoO4/NF revealed an overpotential of only 117 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a relatively low overpotential of 336 mV toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and a Faraday efficiency of up to 99 %. This performance can be attributed to the unique 3D nanosheet array structure, the synergistic effect, and the optimal hydrophilia for gas evolution evolved from the electrode surface.									29	1	0	0	2	0	29			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000560919400001	32597520

In this context, production of hydrogen and oxygen from electrolysis of water is a smart approach. Its inputs are only water and potential. However, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via water splitting is a sluggish reaction. So, herein, we report the synthesis of a novel OER hybrid tetrametallic electrocatalyst (Co-Ni-Fe-Zn) that is cost affordable as compared to the traditional precious noble-metal-based catalysts. It was grown over the surface of fluorine doped tin oxide by a facile potentiodynamic method, and the surface modification was ensured from XRD, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy analyses. The OER catalytic activity of the designed electrocatalyst was examined through electrochemical techniques. Linear scan voltammetric results revealed that the as-prepared catalyst generates a signal of OER with a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of just 90 mV under alkaline conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on an OER catalyst that demands the lowest overpotential. Hence, the synthesized catalyst is a promising candidate for realizing the dream of rapidly producing sustainable and environmentally friendly fuel.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1941-7012			WOS:000519078800001

Here a low-cost and scaled-up chemical etching method is developed for transforming nickel foam (NF) into a highly active electrocatalyst for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The synthetic method involves a Na2S-induced chemical etching of NF in the presence of Fe, leading to a growth of ultrathin Fe-doped Ni(3)S(2)arrays on the NF substrate (FexNi3-xS2 @ NF). The combined experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the incorporated Fe cations significantly modulate the morphology and the surface electron density of Ni3S2, and thus significantly boost the electrochemically active surface area, electron transfer, and optimize the hydrogen/water absorption free energy. The developed Fe0.9Ni2.1S2 @ NF requires overpotentials of only 72 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)for HER and 252 mV at 100 mA cm(-2)for OER in 1.0mKOH, respectively, enabling an alkaline electrolyzer at a low cell voltage of 1.51 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2)for overall water splitting. More broadly, this synthetic approach is very versatile and can be used to synthesize other ultrathin metal sulfides (e.g., Fe-Cu-S, Fe-Al-S, and Fe-Ti-S).									117	8	0	0	7	0	118			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000572948600001

However, they suffer from sluggish electrons transfer accompanied by poor active sites. It is the common way that silicon dioxide (SiO2) engaged as a sacrificial core could be tightly wrapped by a shell to prepare the hollow/porous target products with satisfying specific surface area. But to reversely think it, using SiO2 as sacrificial shell could be another way to unlock the bottleneck of NiCo2O4 and Co3O4 in this direction. Herein, a facile encapsulated self-activation strategy coupled with partial reduction method is described to construct order mesoporous NiCo2O4 and Co3O4 microspheres with oxygen vacancies modulation (SA-NiCo2O4 (Ov) and SA-Co3O4 (O-v)), respectively. The specific surface area of SA-NiCo2O4 (O-v) and SA-Co3O4 (O-v) microspheres is significantly increased by a factor of three after introducing encapsulated self-activation strategy, respectively. The superior specific surface area could provide numerous electroactive sites and large electrode/electrolyte interfaces for fast ions diffusion and redox reaction. The oxygen vacancies could offer favorable conductivity and boost ions diffusion. In virtue of intrinsic characteristics and structural advantage, SA-NiCo2O4 (O-v) and SA-Co3O4 (O-v) demonstrate decent specific capacitance (448.2 C/g and 375.3 C/g), and the corresponding asymmetrical devices deliver favorable energy density (31.2 Wh/kg and 29.4 Wh/kg), respectively. Furthermore, SA-NiCo2O4 (O-v) and SA-Co3O4 (O-v) could efficiently catalyze HER with a low overpotential of 141.1 mV and 155.6 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and confirm beneficial dynamics, respectively. This present strategy of using self-activation and oxygen-vacancies to enhance electrochemical properties may open up new opportunities for developing high-performance metal oxide catalysts/electrodes for energy conversion and storage.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2352-152X		WOS:000780365800001

Herein, a novel hierarchical urchin-like cobalt-copper (hydr)oxide in situ grown on copper foam (CoCuOxHy(S)/CF) was synthesized through the electrochemical transformation of cobalt-copper sulfides (Co9S8-Cu1.81S) via anodization process. This CoCuOxHy(S)/CF anode exhibited a low overpotential (eta) of 274 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2)with a robust durability over a period of 40 h when operated at 10 mA cm(-2). Further investigations imply that the unique nanowires aggregated urchin-like structure of CoCuOxHy(S) derived from the in situ anion exchange process could facilitate the exposure of active sites and accelerate electron transfer. More importantly, the incorporation of copper resulted in an electronic delocalization around the cobalt species, which contributed to reach a high-valent catalytically active cobalt species and further improved the OER performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2192-6506			WOS:000544057700028	32578958

The carbon fiber and amorphous char models are generated by kinetic Monte-Carlo and liquid quench methods, respectively. The species formed in the simulation are characterized and carbon monoxide is found to be the primary product in both systems. The oxidation results are analyzed in terms of the lifetime of molecules and the reaction rates of various species. Oxygen is found to be adsorbed on the surface of both carbon fiber and amorphous carbon char. Since the amorphous carbon has a significantly larger surface area, the number of oxygen atoms adsorbed on the amorphous carbon surface is significantly higher than on the carbon fiber surface. Six reaction models are proposed to fit the simulation results from which reaction rates at various temperatures are obtained. Reaction rates of the key reactions: carbon oxidation and oxygen adsorption follow the Arrhenius law and the activation energy is extracted for these reactions. These reaction rates are used to predict the long-time evolution of these systems. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0008-6223	1873-3891		WOS:000703891700003

This is not only because it is the simplest way to produce high purity hydrogen and the fact that it is the side reaction in many other technologies. HER actually shaped current electrochemistry because it was in focus of active research for so many years (and it still is). The number of catalysts investigated for HER is immense, and it is not possible to overview them all. In fact, it seems that the complexity of the field overcomes the complexity of HER. The aim of this review is to point out some of the latest developments in HER catalysis, current directions and some of the missing links between a single crystal, nanosized supported catalysts and recently emerging, single-atom catalysts for HER.									31	0	0	0	4	0	31				2073-4344		WOS:000523500100041

However, it has been hindered by the sluggishness of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction. In this work, we fabricated Ru-Co-Mn trimetallic alloy nanoparticles on N-doped carbon support (RuCoMn@NC) via the pyrolysis-adsorption-pyrolysis process using ZIF-67 as a precursor. The RuCoMn@NC catalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over a wide range of pH and glucose oxidation reaction in alkaline media. It showed exceptional HER activity in alkaline medium, superior to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (20 wt%), and good electrochemical stability. Further, a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer pairing RuCoMn@NC as both cathode and anode was employed, and only a cell voltage of 1.63 V was required to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in glucose electrolysis, which is about 270 mV lower than that in the overall water-splitting electrolyzer. This paper provides a promising method for developing efficiently bifunctional electrocatalysts driving redox electrocatalysis, and it would be beneficial to energy-saving electrolytic H-2 production.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000684086800001

Electrochemical testing showed that the amorphous alloys possessed lower Tafel values for the OER compared to crystalline Ni and Ni95Co5. Anodic cycling of amorphous Ni742Co5Nb12.5Y8.3 resulted in a lower onset potential for the OER and decreased Tafel values while no changes were observed for amorphous Ni79.2Nb12.5Y8.3 and crystalline Ni95Co5. Pairing of in situ confocal Raman spectroscopy with anodic cycling showed that the amorphous Ni742Co5Nb12.5Y8.3 alloy formed reversible hydrous Co surface species instead of irreversible CoO2 typically seen on crystalline NiCo alloys in KOH. The formation of hydrous Co surface species upon cycling was also accompanied by increased formation of beta-NiOOH leading to enhanced catalytic performance of amorphous Ni742Co5Nb12.5Y8.3 alloy over the amorphous Ni79.2Nb12.5Y8.3 and the crystalline counterparts.

Their predicted oxygen isotopic ratios are compared to observationally inferred values in red giants to investigate how well standard evolutionary calculation reproduces available observations and to illustrate the role of convective mixing. We find that extra mixing beyond the convective boundary determined by the Schwarzschild criterion is needed to explain the observational oxygen isotopic ratios, particularly in low mass stars.

Herein, a composite of Co3O4 nanoparticles confined in three-dimensional (3D) N-doped porous carbon (Co-NpCs) was prepared by a simple freeze-drying and in situ pyrolysis method. The effect of different dosages of Co(NO3)(2) on the catalytic performance was discussed. The Co-NpC-12% exhibits the best catalytic performance (E-1/2 = 0.78 V, better stability than 20% Pt/C) in ORR and in OER among all the as-synthesized samples. Furthermore, it also exhibits the best bifunctional activity (Delta E = 0.849 V). The excellent properties of Co-NpCs are mainly due to the synergy between Co(3)O(4)and carbon. Firstly, a high Co3O4 loading amount can boost the defect level of the N-doped hierarchical porous carbon and expose more active sites. Secondly, the unique in situ pyrolysis guarantees a large-area contact between Co3O4 and carbon as well as a strong C-O-Co bonding, which promotes charge transfer, avoids the peeling of Co3O4 nanoparticles and effectively improves the stability of the material. This work is expected to offer a feasible strategy to produce metal oxide/carbon nanocomposite and push forward the development of bifunctional electrocatalyst with high activity and stability.									43	7	0	0	0	0	43			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000569289200001

Herein, by a facile one-pot redox process of Fe(III) and Cu(I), Fe(II) was successfully doped into the subsurface of CuS nanosheets (NSs) for the first time to obtain a novel electrocatalyst (Fe-sub-CuS NSs) that possesses not only subtle lattice defects but also an atomic-level coupled nanointerface, greatly enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances. Meanwhile, Fe(II) and Fe(III) coexisting in Fe-sub-CuS nanosheets are favorable to OER through valence regulation. As expected, by simultaneously controlling the abovementioned three factors to optimize Fe-sub-CuS nanosheets, they display a lower overpotential of 252 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) for OER, better than 389 mV for pristine CuS nanosheets. This discovery furnishes low-cost and efficient Cu-based electrocatalysts by metal doping. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further verify that Fe-sub-CuS(100) is thermodynamically stable and is more active for OER. This research provides a strategy for the atomic-scale engineering of nanocatalysts and also sheds light on the design of novel and efficient electrocatalysts.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000641156600022	33819032

The amorphous structure enabled the Co-Mo-PO electrocatalyst to have a high density of active sites, large electrochemical surface area (ECSA), fast water splitting reaction kinetics, and excellent conductivity. An electrochemical activation was performed on the as-electrodeposited Co-Mo-P-O to further enhance the activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This rendered the activated Co-Mo-P-O highly catalytically active CoOOH, and further enhanced the ECSA, reaction kinetics, and conductivity. Utilizing the activated Co-Mo-P-O as an OER electrocatalyst, small overpotentials of 168.5 and 333.1 mV were separately required for current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm(-2). The overpotential of 97.6 mV was required for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for the as-electrodeposited Co-Mo-P-O. The aselectrodeposited and activated Co-Mo-P-O electrocatalysts were paired in an integrated electrochemical cell for overall water splitting; a small cell voltage of 1.57 V was needed to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the system. The activity of our electrocatalysts was among the best in the previously reported bifunctional electrocatalysts toward full water splitting. In addition, the Co-Mo-P-O electrocatalyst exhibited excellent long-term stability.									34	1	0	0	1	0	34			2168-0485			WOS:000516665500027

This process promotes favourable band alignment and produces nanoscale CuO surface features from Cu20 with low density of interfacial defects. This electrode can operate without any transparent current collector, showing remarkable currents and stability towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (6 mA cm(-2) for 2 h at pH14) as well as photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity (-1.9 mA cm(-2) for 800 s at pH7). When the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution (OER) activity was measured for Cu2O/CuO electrode deposited on FTO substrate the currents increased to similar to 40 mA cm(-2) at 0.8 V vs SCE in 1 M KOH without compensating for the electrode electrolyte surface resistance (iR correction). The composite films also exhibited a high rate towards photo degradation of Methylene Blue (MB) and phenol in the visible spectra, indicating efficient charge separation. We modelled the electronic structure of this epitaxially grown Cu2O/CuO heterojunction using density functional theory. The calculations revealed the distinctive shifts towards Fermi level of the p-band centre of O atom in Cu2O and d-band centre of Cu atom in CuO at the interface contribute towards the increased catalytic activity of the heterostructure. Another factor influencing the activity stems from the high density of excited species in the plasma introducing polar radicals at the electrode surface increasing the electrolyte coverage. This work presents the potential of APPJ functionalization to tune the surface electronic properties of copper oxide based catalysts for enhanced efficiency in OER and HER water splitting.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000608496900006

A detailed study was conducted on the mechanism of the formation of metal-encapsulated N-doped CNT structures from the polymerization of melamine. The unique NiCoS@CNT structure renders high specific surface area (232.2 m(2)/g), large pore volume (0.92 cm(2)/g), and high lattice defect with abundant oxygen vacancies resulting in excellent performance for OER and HER in alkaline medium. The hybrid catalyst requires over-potentials of 198 mV and 295 mV to deliver a current-density of 10 mAcm(-2), respectively for HER and OER. A cell voltage of only 1.53 V was required to deliver a long-term stable current-density of 10 mAcm(-2) for water splitting when NiCoS@CNT was used as both anode and cathode. Superior performance of NiCoS@CNT could be ascribed to high surface area, abundant active sites, fast charge-transfer rate, high pyridinic-N content and the presence of highly conductive CNT architecture.

Here, authors enhance acidic oxygen evolution by introducing strong Bronsted acid sites into RuO2 to accelerate bridging-oxygen-assisted deprotonation.Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) consists of four sequential proton-coupled electron transfer steps, which suffer from sluggish kinetics even on state-of-the-art ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) catalysts. Understanding and controlling the proton transfer process could be an effective strategy to improve OER performances. Herein, we present a strategy to accelerate the deprotonation of OER intermediates by introducing strong Bronsted acid sites (e.g. tungsten oxides, WOx) into the RuO2. The Ru-W binary oxide is reported as a stable and active iridium-free acidic OER catalyst that exhibits a low overpotential (235 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and low degradation rate (0.014 mV h(-1)) over a 550-hour stability test. Electrochemical studies, in-situ near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory show that the W-O-Ru Bronsted acid sites are instrumental to facilitate proton transfer from the oxo-intermediate to the neighboring bridging oxygen sites, thus accelerating bridging-oxygen-assisted deprotonation OER steps in acidic electrolytes. The universality of the strategy is demonstrated for other Ru-M binary metal oxides (M = Cr, Mo, Nb, Ta, and Ti).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2041-1723		WOS:000842231900010	35982041

Here, using first principles simulations, we have explored the potential of silicon-doped nitrogen-coordinated graphene (Si-GN4) system as an efficient electrocatalyst for ORR in a fuel cell in acidic environment. Introduction of different electronegative atoms (Si, N) on graphene surface facilitates the activation of O-2 and desorption of H2O from the surface, which are the two key steps for a good ORR catalyst. The plausible reaction pathways are studied, and it is revealed that the reaction mainly occurs via 4e(-) reduction pathway following associative approach. Least stabilization of HOOH on Si-GN4 surface ruled out the possibility of 2e(-) reduction pathway. Hydrogenation of oxygen (O-2) is found to be the kinetically rate-determining step. Our computational study reveals that Si-GN4 surface is quite a promising catalyst with high efficiency for ORR in fuel cells.									40	0	0	0	0	0	40			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000452693300013

Reduction of Fe2O3 started at around 1100 degrees C, accompanied by the blackening of the clay body. Bloating was caused by the entrapment of oxygen that was released by iron oxides in closed pores, the formation of which started at about 1200 degrees C. Fe2+ that was formed in the clay body during the heating process migrated toward the surface layer during the cooling process, resulting in the enrichment of Fe in the surface layer. The results of thermodynamic calculations suggested that oxygen evolution was caused or at least assisted by the reaction of iron oxides with Al2O3 to form FeAl2O4, a stable spinel.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1882-0743	1348-6535		WOS:000088820100005

Robust, efficient, and cost-effective electrocatalysts are critical to overcome the sluggish kinetics and high overpotential of OERs. Herein, a simple co-precipitation method followed by solvothermal treatment is used to synthesize Fe-doped alpha-CoOOH at higher pH under optimum conditions for OER. The alpha-Fe0.24Co0.76OOH/NF illustrates superior OER electrocatalytic performance and requires an overpotential of only 280 mV to produce a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) with excellent stability. The detailed analysis reveals that the exceptional OER performance originates from thin nanorods and partially due to the replacement of Fe in alpha-CoOOH. This work illustrates the presence of interlayer chloride ions through energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0743-7463			WOS:000519337400007	32037838

Herein, a non-noble-metal catalyst with FeNi@nitrogen-doped graphene dispersed on a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (named FeNi@NGE/NC) is synthesized by a facile one-pot pyrolysis process. In this composite, FeNi alloy nanoparticles encapsulated with few-layer nitrogen-doped graphene are uniformly anchored on a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix. The FeNi@NGE/NC composite exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance for OER with a low overpotential of 275 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 41.2 mV dec(-1), and high stability in 1 M KOH solution. Even at the low concentration of basic solution (0.1 M KOH), it still displays good activity for OER with an overpotential of 372 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The outstanding OER performance of the FeNi@NGE/NC composite can be mainly attributed to the fast electron transfer from the FeNi alloy to nitrogen-doped graphene shells and the high structural stability due to the protection of graphene shells and the carbon matrix. This work may open a facile and low-cost way for large-scale synthesis of non-noble metals/nitrogen-doped carbon composite electrocatalysts for practical application.									26	4	0	0	2	0	27			2574-0962			WOS:000473116600016

Current studies generally aim at increasing active site amount and improving intrinsic activity. However, the ion diffusion kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface as a bottleneck has been rarely directly addressed. Here, a 3D holey-graphene framework is demonstrated as a catalyst-loading platform, with nanoscale holes that can be elaborately tuned via facile aqueous-phase chemical etching. This enables the ions to be efficiently transported to deeply buried active sites to mitigate their insufficient supply. With systematical electrochemical investigations tuned by varied pore structures, a series of models from a simplified equivalent circuit to complicate realistic one are proposed to figure out the modulation rules of weakened electrochemical diffusion domination and identify the ion transport resistance as well. Moreover, given the inevitable negative effect on the conductivity of graphene skeleton by introducing nanoscale holes, the balance between the outside ion transport and the inside charge transport of electrode is highlighted. Such a protocol represents a synergistic modulation of catalytic performance from both the supply side (reactive ion transport) and the consuming side (active site), and provides striking information for the precise design of catalyst electrodes toward further pushing the oxygen evolution reaction performance limit.									26	1	0	0	1	0	27			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000527337900001

Herein, an ultrasonic-assisted and coordination modulation strategy is developed to construct sandwich-like metal-organic framework (MOF) derived hydroxide nanosheet (NS) arrays/graphene oxide (GO) composite via one-step self-transformation route. Inducing from unsteady state, the dodecahedral ZIF-67 with Co2+ in tetrahedral coordination auto-converts into defect-rich ultrathin layered hydroxides with the interlayered ion NO3-. The self-transforming a-Co(OH)(2)/GO nanosheet arrays from ZIF-67 (Co(OH)(2)-GNS) change the coordination mode of Co2+ and bring about the exposure of more metal active sites, thereby enhancing the spatial utilization ratio within the framework. As monometal-based electrocatalyst, the optimized Co(OH)(2)-GNS exhibits remarkable OER catalytic performance evidenced by a low overpotential of 259 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) in alkaline medium, even exceeding commercial RuO2. During the oxygen evolution process, electron migration can be accelerated by the interfacial/in-plane charge polarization and local electric field, corroborated by the off-axis electron holography. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further studied the collaboration between ultrathin Co(OH)(2) NS and GO, which leads to lower energy barriers of intermediate products and greatly promotes electrocatalytic property.									37	3	0	0	2	0	38			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000515939700002

However, the slow anode reaction of water electrolysis is the bottleneck of limiting the efficient hydrogen production. Therefore, it is a key problem to explore an efficient and economical electrocatalyst to assist the anode reaction. Herein, a series of self-supporting M-NiCo2S4/Ni3S2 (M=Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn) nanostructures grown on a nickel foam (NF) skeleton were prepared through one-step hydrothermal strategy. In this process, doping engineering is employed to adjust the electronic structure of catalyst and improve the performance of the catalyst. Among them, the introduction of Fe not only greatly changed the morphology, but also provided rich active sites. Specifically, the Fe-NiCo2S4/Ni3S2 electrode can achieve current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 159 and 210 mV in alkaline media for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In addition, driving current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea only requires the ultra-small voltage of 1.37 and 1.39 V (vs. RHE) for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), indicating that UOR can well replace OER to reduce electrical energy consumption. The experimental results and density functional theory calculations (DFT) demonstrate that the superior activity of the catalyst can be attributed to the optimal water adsorption energy, faster electron transfer rate, more active site exposure and good electrical conductivity. This work extends the application of doping engineering in water electrolysis and provides a novel preparation method of efficient catalyst for OER and UOR. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Carbon-based nanomaterials, including simplex carbon materials, heteroatom-doped carbon materials, carbon-transition metal nanoparticle composites, and carbon-transition metal compound composites, are promising electrode materials because of their high conductivity and stable structure. Hollow carbon-based nanomaterials, which possess the features of the aforementioned materials, have become a research hotspot in electrochemical energy storage and electrocatalysis. The excellent characteristics of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) make them an ideal material for constructing hollow carbon-based nanomaterials. In this article, the process of preparing MOF-derived hollow carbon-based materials and their applications in electrochemical energy storage and electrocatalysis are reviewed. First, the various methods for preparing MOF-derived hollow carbon-based materials are introduced, and the characteristics of each method are analyzed. Second, the applications of MOF-derived hollow carbon-based materials in the oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, and supercapacitors are analyzed and summarized. Finally, research directions for further development of MOF-derived hollow carbon-based materials are proposed.									55	2	0	0	6	0	56			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000621407000007

X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis and voltammetric charges calculation were performed to explore the surface properties of the coating. The electrochemical behavior of the anodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammogram (LSV), Tafel lines and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The long-term stability of the anodes were evaluated using accelerated life test (ALT). It indicated that the compositions of the coating are rutile-type IrO2, RuO2 and IrO2-RuO2 solid solution. SiO2 existed in an amorphous state in the ternary oxide coating. The IrO2-RuO2-SiO2 ternary oxide coatings with compact structure and a large amount of acerose crystals of the IrO2-RuO2 solid solution dispersing were detected by FESEM analysis. The generation of the acerose crystals significantly increased the surface area that increased the electrocatalytic activity of the coating. The active surface area of the coating was "outer" active surface dominated. The rate-determining step of the coating for oxygen evolution reaction in sulphuric acid solution can be regarded as the rearrangement of the intermediate. An increase of Ru content can improve the electrocatalytic activity, however, decrease the service lifetime of the anodes. The anode with a molar ratio of Ir:Ru:Si - 9:21:70 is most suitable for OER due to its high electrocatalytic activity, a certain lifetime and low cost. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, novel heterostructures (Ni3S2/VS2) without nitrogen (N) and with N doping are reported as superior electrocatalysts for the OER and HER, respectively. The heterostructure without doping shows enhanced OER performance with an extremely low overpotential (227mV at 10 mA/cm(2)) due to increased active sites and fantastic interfaces as well as unique structure. Moreover, N-doped Ni3S2/VS2 (N-Ni3S2/VS2) shows high electrocatalytic HER performance with a low HER overpotential (151 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)), because the N-doping greatly improves conductivity and increases large amounts of catalytic active sites. Finally, we construct a two-electrode electrolyzer system (Ni3S2/VS2//N-Ni3S2/VS2) and it achieves a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at a low cell voltage of 1.648 V. Our findings demonstrate that structure design and doping can effectively improve the catalytic activities of nanomaterials for OER and HER. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However,it is important to explore the evolutionary mechanism for water quality protection and management. This paper systematically analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of water temperature and DO,as well as the water quality response to these factors,in the Panjiakou Reservoir,a large deep reservoir in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Results show that the reservoir has a significant seasonal thermal stratification during mid-April to the end of November,which creates a vertically specific environment for the DO stratification. Similar to the thermal stratification,the DO stratification also shows a three-layer structure from top to down,namely,the mixed layer,the oxycline and the oxygen-deficient layer. Different biochemical processes in each layer determinate the spatial variability DO evolution. Due to excessive planktonic algae,DO is supersaturated in the mixed layer. While in the oxycline layer,DO concentration declines sharply as a result of respiration and organic matter decomposition,becoming hypoxic (i.e.,DO<2 mg/L) in July and August. Due to the oxygen consumption of severely contaminated sediments in the oxygen-deficient layer,DO concentration declines continuously, potentially leading to hypolimnion at the bottom of the reservoir at the end of thermal stratification. Meanwhile,in this area, Mn reduction reaction occurs and the Mn-P is released to the hypolimnion. However,there is no Fe reduction reaction or Fe-P released. In summary,the Panjiakou Reservoir is approaching a critical point of hypoxia and massive release of endogenous pollutants. Special attentions should be paid on its water environment treatment.			深水水库溶解氧(DO)的演化成因目前尚不完全清楚,研究其演变机制对制定水库水质保护和管理策略十分重要.本文以我国京津冀地区重要的大型深水水源水库潘家口水库为例,系统分析了水库水温和DO浓度的时空分布特征、演化成因,以及水库的水质响应情况.结果表明: 4月中旬-11月底该水库存在显著的季节性热分层,水库热分层为DO层化结构的形成提供了垂向分异性物理环境;与热分层类似,DO层化表现为3层结构,本文从上至下将其分别定义为混合层、氧跃层和氧亏层.垂向各层不同生化过程的作用为DO浓度空间差异性演变提供了驱动力,其中混合层受浮游藻类过量生长的影响,DO往往处于过饱和状态;氧跃层受大量生物的呼吸及有机物分解等耗氧的影响,DO浓度急剧下降,7-8月一般处于缺氧状态(DO<2 mg/L);氧亏层受重污染沉积物耗氧的影响,DO浓度持续下降,热分层末期水库底部可能出现缺氧.热分层末期DO浓度降低的同时,沉积物中会发生Mn的还原、Mn-P解吸释放等现象,但沉积物中含量较高的Fe没有发生还原以及Fe-P的解吸释放现象.潘家口水库目前正在逼近缺氧、内源污染大量释放的临界点,其水环境治理应予以高度重视.						2	7	0	0	4	0	10			1003-5427			CSCD:6816374

Herein, Co2P/CoP hybrid is synthesized from cobalt carbonate hydroxide (CoCH) precursor, and further evaluated for the electrocatalytic HOR and HER in alkaline electrolytes. Specifically, benefiting from the reasonable hybrid structure that integrate suitable hydrogen adsorption energy of CoP and excellent conductivity of Co2P, Co2P/CoP hybrid exhibits excellent catalytic activities. The Co2P/CoP@NF hybrid has impressive HER activity, with a cur-rent density of -10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotentials of -61 mV and the Tafel slope of 55.1 mV dec(-1), which can compete with recently reported transition metal phosphides and cobalt-based catalysts. In addition, the exchange current density of Co2P/CoP@NF hybrid is -0.82 mA cm(-2) for HOR, which is close to commercial Pt/C catalyst (similar to 1.14 mA cm(-2)). (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

J	Mei, Yunjie; Feng, Yuebin; Zhang, Chengxu; Zhang, Yue; Qi, Qianglong; Hu, Jue								High-Entropy Alloy with Mo-Coordination as Efficient Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction								ACS CATALYSIS				12	17			10808	10817		10.1021/acscatal.2c0260410808				SEP 2 2022	2022	Electrochemical hydrolytic hydrogen production is the most promising method for renewable energy storage and conversion. However, the kinetic slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits the development of water electrolysis at the anode. The state-of-the-art OER catalysts face a dilemma of high content of noble metals and low OER activities. Herein, a strategy for achieving efficient and stable high-entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts by Mo-coordination is reported. The earth-abundant FeCoNiMo HEA catalyst provides an overpotential as low as 250 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline medium, which is 89 mV lower than that of state-of-the-art IrO2. The turnover frequency of 0.051 s(-1) at the overpotential of 300 mV of FeCoNiMo HEA is 3 times higher than that of commercial IrO2 catalyst and even 11 times higher than that of the FeCoNi alloy without Mo-coordination. Importantly, the FeCoNiMo HEA exhibits high OER stability at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Methanol molecular probe experiment and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses suggest that the electrons of Mo transfer to Fe, Co, and Ni in the FeCoNiMo HEA catalyst, which leads to a weakened OH* bonding and, as a result, enhanced OER performance of the FeCoNiMo HEA catalyst. Consistent with the methanol molecular probe analysis, the real-time OER kinetic simulation reveals that the coordination of Mo within FeCoNi can speed up the rate-determining OH* deprotonation step of OER. Our finding opens up a routine for designing efficient cost-effective electrocatalysts for OER, which could facilitate discoveries in OER catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000858841600001

In this work, we report a facile and scalable strategy for fabricating self-supporting boron carbon oxynitride nanofibrous (BCNONF) mats with controllable boron contents via electrospinning and subsequent thermal treatment. Notably, the optimal BCNONF mat affords outstanding OER performance in alkaline electrolyte with low overpotential of 403 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2), small Tafel slop of 72.9 mV.dec(-1), and high stability (88.1% current density retention after 10 h), outperforming the commercial Ir/C benchmark. Moreover, it can serve as a remarkable HER catalyst with better stability than that of the commercial Pt/C counterpart in the same electrolyte, indicating its bifunctional characteristics. When employed as both anode and cathode of an electrolyzer, the self-supporting BCNONF mats exhibit superior activities with a potential of only 1.79 V at 10 mA.cm(-2) and high long-term durability (90.6% current density retention after 50 h) for overall water splitting. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the remarkable OER and HER bifunctional performance of the BCNONF catalyst are originated from the reduced adsorption strength of O atom and the stronger H* adsorption on the BCNO surface as compared to those on CNO surface, which in turn facilitate efficient interfacial charge transfer between the electrocatalytic intermediates and the BCNONF catalyst.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000703955500002

In this communication, we report the in situ electrochemical conversion of a nanoarray of Cu(tetracyanoquinodimethane), Cu(TCNQ), an inorganic-organic hybrid, on Cu foam into CuO nanocrystals confined in a highly conductive nanoarray via anode oxidation. As a 3D catalyst electrode, the resulting CuO-TCNQ/CF shows high OER activity and demands an overpotential of only 317 mV to drive a geometrical catalytic current density of 25 mA cm(-2).

Developing inexpensive and highly efficient cathode materials without using noble metal-based catalysts is highly desirable for practical applications in lithium-oxygen batteries. Herein, a heterostructure of NiFe and NiCx inside of N-doped carbon (NiCx-NiFe-NC) derived from bimetallic Prussian blue supported on biochar was developed as a novel self-standing cathode for lithium-oxygen batteries. The specific discharge capacity of the best sample was 27.14 mAh.cm(-2) at a stable discharge voltage of 2.75 V. The hybridization between the d-orbital of Ni and s and p-orbitals of carbon in NiCx, formed at 900 degrees C, enhanced the electrocatalytic performance due to the synergistic effect between these components. The structure of NiCx-NiFe-NC efficiently improved the electron and ion transfer between the cathode and the electrolyte during the electrochemical processes, resulting in superior electrocatalytic properties in lithium-oxygen batteries. This study indicates that nickel carbide supported on N-doped carbon is a promising cathode material for lithium-oxygen batteries.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2190-4286			WOS:000597762200001	33335825

Special attention was paid to an analysis of the decline in electrode performance over time and to a more detailed understanding of the related degradation processes. Besides electrode blockage by Ca2+ and Mg2+ precipitates, an additional degradation process, resulting in an irreversible electrode surface modification reducing its salt adsorption capacity, was identified. The mechanism of electrode surface modification based on the anodic oxygen evolution reaction, as well as the interaction of the surface modified by on this way formed oxygen containing functional groups with charged species present in the treated water, were discovered. A method of preventing or at least reducing the above-mentioned degradation process is proposed.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			0011-9164	1873-4464		WOS:000582795900001

In this paper, NiFe-LDH@Ni3S2 arrays on nickel foam (NF) are prepared via a facile two-step hydrothermal approach. The catalyst with a special structure of on-chip epitaxial growth of sheet grown vertically on nickel foam not only provides enhanced interface connections and massive exposed active sites but also accelerates the transmission of electronics. The experimental results demonstrate that Ni1Fe10-LDH@Ni3S2/NF possesses exceptional electrocatalytic performance for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared to individual NiFe-LDH and Ni3S2. It demands 230 mV to drive a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) toward OER while it just needs 197 mV to afford 20 mA cm(-2) for HER. Additionally, Ni1Fe10-LDH@Ni3S2/NF as both cathode and anode in a two-electrode system just requires 1.65 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and still remains stable after a 12 h chronoamperometry measures. The as-synthesized electrocatalyst with improved electrocatalytic performance, outstanding long-term stability and low-priced is prospective for overall water splitting practical production.

Transition metal oxides are promising OER catalysts. In this work, Fe, W co-doped Co3O4 was grown on carbon fiber cloth (FeWCo3O4/CFC) and polypyrrole (PPy)/carbon fiber cloth (FeWCo3O4/PPy/CFC) through a simple anodic electrodeposition method. The FeWCo3O4/CFC free-standing electrode reached an electrocatalytic current density of 30.7mAcm(-2) at 400mV overpotential with a Tafel slope of 177mVdec(-1). The PPy can serve as conductive binder and improve the contact between FeWCo3O4 and substrate. The resulting FeWCo3O4/PPy/CFC free-standing electrode reached an electrocatalytic current density of 36.2mAcm(-2) at 400mV overpotential with a Tafel slope of 163mVdec(-1). The FeWCo3O4/PPy/CFC free-standing electrode shows low electric resistance and is able to catalyze OER at 10mAcm(-2) for 12h without obvious decay under the optimized electrodeposition conditions. This study provides new insight for design and synthesis of highly-efficient OER catalyst.[GRAPHICS]					17th Congress of Asian-Pacific-Confederation-of-Chemical-Engineering (APCChE)17th Congress of Asian-Pacific-Confederation-of-Chemical-Engineering (APCChE)	AUG 23-27, 2017AUG 23-27, 2017	Asian Pacific Confederat Chem EngnAsian Pacific Confederat Chem Engn	Hong Kong, HONG KONGHong Kong, HONG KONG	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000444477400012

A facile annealing of the alpha-Ni(OH)(2) films at 150 degrees C for 1 h is of extreme importance to enhance their electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Voltammetric analysis combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals that the induced structural evolution of the alpha-Ni(OH)(2) results in a strong improvement of electrical conductivity, which is a crucial factor for the highly enhanced activity. Moreover, the annealing accelerates the generation of active sites, which can even be further improved easily via electrochemical galvanostatic conditioning. Thus, the alpha-Ni(OH)(2) thin films exhibit an overpotential of 310 mV (at j = 10 mA cm(-2)) with a Tafel slope of 42.6 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH, which is much better than that for a commercial RuO2/Ti electrode. The active component at the applied electrode potential of 10 mA cm(-2) is characterized to be gamma-(NiO0.63)-O-2-O-.-O-63(OH)(1.)(37) showing an "apparent oxidation state" of +2.63 for the Ni. In addition, the annealed electrocatalyst exhibits only a negligible overpotential increase after 26 h of measurement. The overpotential even decreases to 292 mV in the first 3 h, demonstrating outstanding electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000743183000001

To address such issues, "cicada-wing-like" nitrogen-doped porous carbon-anchored Ni and CeO2 nanoparticles (CeO2/Ni/NC) were developed and manufactured as a bifunctional catalyst utilizing a modified electrospinning process for overall water splitting. It is worth mentioning that the resulting CeO2/Ni/NC catalyst had excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic performance, as well as superior alkaline electrolyte durability. Compared with other nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts, in the OER, it revealed with a lower OER overpotential of 390 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) and a smaller value of the Tafel slope (123 mV.dec(-1)), while in the HER, it showed an overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 150 mV.dec(-1). The metallic Ni was the main center of excellent catalytic activity, and the abundant oxygen vacancies and outstanding oxidation/reduction capabilities in CeO2 promoted the overall water splitting. Moreover, the porous nanoarchitecture of matrix material well controlled the size of Ni and CeO2, providing a wealth of active sites, facilitating the electron/ion transfer. This work provided ideas for non-metal-doped carbon-supported catalyst particles, and the catalytic material obtained by the cheap and simple preparation method had an ultrathin microscopic appearance like cicada-wing-like and excellent bifunctional catalytic activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2574-0970		WOS:000733839900001

The structural and textural properties of the catalysts with variable Co/Ni ratios were assessed by N-2 physisorption, powder X-ray diffraction, and electron microscopy. The obtained materials exhibit electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution. The highest activity was found for catalysts containing both transition-metal cations, Co and Ni. However, comparison of the LDH precursors and the calcined MMOs revealed a composition-dependent effect of calcination. Co-rich LDH tends to lose activity when calcined, whereas Ni-rich LDH gains activity. The optimal cation composition of the LDH was Co1.5Ni0.5Ga with an overpotential of 382 mV. The highest performance among the MMOs, on the other hand, has been encountered for the Co0.5Ni1.5Ga composition, reaching a similar overpotential.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2196-0216			WOS:000482102400012

Whereas a number of transition metal oxides and oxyhydroxides have been developed as promising OER catalysts in alkaline medium, the mechanisms of OER onco these catalysts are not well understood. Here we combine electrochemical and in situ spectroscopic methods, particularly operando X-ray absorption and Raman spectroscopy, to study the mechanism of OER on cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH), an archetypical unary OER catalyst. We find the dominating resting state of the catalyst as a Co(IV) species CoO2. Through oxygen isotope exchange experiments, we discover a cobalt superoxide species as an active intermediate in the OER. This intermediate is formed concurrently to the oxidation of CoOOH to CoO2. Combing spectroscopic and electrokinetic data, we identify the rate-determining step of the OER as the release of dioxygen from the superoxide intermediate. The work provides important experimental fingerprints and new mechanistic perspectives for OER catalysts.									181	3	0	0	18	0	181			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000550639000034	32539368

Dissolution of potassium-intercalated graphitic nanocarbons yields graphenide solutions with calibrated, small lateral size-reduced graphenes that are used subsequently as reducing agents of iron metal salts. This results in the strong binding of small size (2-5nm) nanoparticles on the carbon framework homogeneously within the composite material, accessibility of the catalytic centers, and good conductivity provided by the underlying carbon framework. The iron oxide nanocarbon electrocatalyst performances are highlighted by the overall overpotential of approximately 1V needed to reach the benchmark threshold of 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen reduction reaction and the particular activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (eta approximate to 0.4V at 10 mA cm(-2)), comparable to that of the precious RuO2 and IrO2 catalysts. This iron oxide/nanocarbon electrocatalyst is versatile, remarkably active, stable, and truly sustainable.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000414351400004	28868759

Understanding materials characteristics that affect OER activity is of paramount importance for the optimization of perovskite oxides for the OER. Herein, a series of Sr2Fe1.3Ni0.2Mo0.5O6-delta (SFNMs) decorated with oxygen vacancies and Fe-Ni alloy nanoparticles were designed to increase both the number and the reactivity of active sites in the perovskite catalysts. Theoretical calculations reveal that oxygen vacancies have a beneficial effect on the OER by increasing the adsorption energy of H2O, in line with the experimental results that the SFNM sample enriched with oxygen vacancies possesses a high intrinsic OER activity. SFNM decorated with metallic nanoparticles, which was prepared by reducing SFNM in 5% H-2/Ar, shows a Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1) and an OER overpotential of 0.36 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This performance is superior to that of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) and close to that of commercial IrO2. The outstanding performance is attributed to the fact that the oxygen vacancies together with the exsolved alloy nanoparticles on the perovskite backbone can increase both the number and the reactivity of active sites.									96	6	0	0	2	0	98			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000411739700033

By virtue of qualitative analyses on the effects of oxidant species (atomic-oxygen and its anion) toward the reaction-diffusion processes, it is found that a monotonically decaying function for either the reactive rate constant or the diffusion coefficient would provide a more realistic description of the reaction-diffusion mechanisms than the existing models. Nondimensional reaction-diffusion equations with a single adjustable parameter are then deduced. Good agreement between theoretical curves and experimental data validates the modified model developed in the present work. The estimations of the diffusivity, reactive rate constant, and adjustable parameter, together with the characteristic attenuation length are presented. The dependencies of those coefficients upon translational kinetic energy, flux, temperature, as well as the tangential flux of atomic-oxygen are explained. In addition, a procedure for evaluating time evolution of oxide-layer thickness by extending the curve fitting is proposed and demonstrated. The procedure would be a useful tool for predicting protective film thickness against the atomic-oxygen reacting with spacecraft surface materials in low Earth orbit.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-4650	1533-6794		WOS:000300206600012

The prepared BiOBr0.9I0.1 has distinct advantages, e.g. loose and rich porous structure, more oxygen vacancies (OVs), and a large specific surface area, which result in strong adsorption for dye molecules. Sensitized by Rhodamine B (RhB), the prepared BiOBr0.9I0.1 photocatalyst shows remarkably improved high activity for H-2 evolution, which is 27.9 times than that of the dense structured BiOBr0.9I0.1 under a direct photocatalytic process. By lowing the pH of RhB solution, the absorption ability is further improved because of the protonation of dye. At low pH, the prepared BiOBr0.9I0.1 can efficiently activate the molecular oxygen to produce superoxide radicals (O-center dot(2)), resulting a super high dye-sensitized degradation activity for tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) and methyl orange (MO) pollutants, outperforming most catalysts reported under similar conditions by the direct photocatalytic reaction. The present method represents a new direction in the development of dye-sensitization nanomaterials with good performance for energy and environment applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Hence, identifying appropriate materials with enhanced structural and fascinating morphological properties that can compete with the electrocatalytic properties of noble electrocatalysts is necessary. Herein, we report the electrocatalytic properties of nickel pyrophosphate (Ni2P2O7) microsheets with a novel architecture, which were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal route followed by thermal treatment. The prepared single-phase crystalline Ni2P2O7 with a unique morphology was found to be an active bi-functional electrocatalyst for efficient water splitting systems. The Ni2P2O7 microsheets with a highly porous surface promoted an enhancement in adsorption sites for the oxygen evolution reaction with a small overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Also, the dominant characteristics of the metal pyrophosphates boosted the catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction with a nominal overpotential requirement of 185 mV at the same current density. The uniformly distributed constitutional elements with an improved porous structure and enhanced surface roughness factor resulted in superior electrocatalytic activity for the prepared Ni2P2O7 electrode. Convincingly, a lab-scale water electrolyzer was fabricated and the tested electrode gave a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a low cell voltage of 1.61 V. Hence, the Ni2P2O7 material with excellent electrocatalytic properties and durability can be promoted as a potential electrode material.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2398-4902			WOS:000482057500023

So, it is a basic fundamental guideline that the preparation of higher-performance pseudocapacitive materials depends on achieving and accelerating more Faradaic reactions in the aspect of electrodes. In this work, based on the mentioned principle, we report a facile method that could significantly promote the capacity of NiCo2O4 nanoelectrode through annealing precursor nanowires (NWs) in different volume ratios of N-2 and O-2 condition. The pristine NCO (V-N2: V-O2 = 0: 1) only exhibited inferior performance with a specific capacitance of 0.88 F cm(-2) (338.5 F g(-1) at 2mA cm(-2)) and capacitive retention of 54% from 2 to 30mA cm(-2). While, for a comparison, the highest comprehensive performance of NCO-9 (V-N2: V-O2 = 9: 1) electrodes delivered superior specific capacitance of 3.8 F cm(-2) (1461 F g(-1) at 2mA cm(-2)), excellent rate retention of 77% and good cycling stability. These boosted pseudocapacitive properties both in capacity and rate capability are attributed to the severe oxygen vacancy defects introduced in nitrided NCO NWs. The involving richness-enabled oxygen defects significantly enhance the electron/ions transportation, and then efficiently alter the well-known capacitive surfacial reaction into bulk pattern in the charge-discharge cycles. This dramatically increased electron/ions kinetics and electrochemical cites for Faradaic reactions. These results provide a deep insight into correlating oxygen vacancies induced structural and chemical evolution on enhanced capacitive performances of redox-active-NiCo2O4 materials.

When these polymers were used as photoanodes under visible light irradiation, oxygen evolution occurred at over potential as low as +0.6 V vs. SCE. In the chronoamperometric (CA) measurements, the photo-current density generated at +0.6 V by P1 and P2 was 031 and 0.27 mu A/cm2, respectively. This is an excellent performance of a metal free and without the use of sacrificial electron donors polymer photoanodes. The higher photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of P1 was attributed to its narrow band gap and larger surface area. Moreover, the drastic quenching of the photoluminescence (PL) emission intensity of P1 suggested the recombination of charges was effectively suppressed, which is in excellent agreement with our experimental observations. In the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements, the onset potential was observed at around 0.73 V whereas the maximum current densities by P1 and P2 were realized at 039 mA/cm(2) and 0.15 mA/cm(2), respectively. Long-term stability testing via CA indicated that P1 was more stable than P2, which warranted its potential as photocatalyst for solar water splitting.In addition, the optical band gaps of P1 and P2, derived from the onset absorption edge, were found to be 2.51 and 2.62 eV, respectively, and the band gaps measured by Kubelka-Munk (KM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and computational methods were found to be consistent. These polymers are readily soluble in common organic solvents which make them potential candidates for photovoltaic devices application. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The OEC is a Mn4CaO5 cluster embedded in the PSII protein matrix, and it cycles through redox intermediates known as Si states (i = 0-4). Significant progress has been made in understanding the inorganic and physical chemistry of states S-0-S-3 through experiment and theory. The chemical steps from S-3 to S-0 are more poorly understood, however, because the identity of the substrate water molecules and the mechanism of O-O bond formation are not well established. In this review, we highlight both the consensuses and the remaining challenges of PSII research.									118	2	0	0	65	0	118			0066-426X		978-0-8243-1068-4	WOS:000401335600006	28226223

An ideal OER electrocatalyst should possess rich active sites and optimal binding strength with oxygen-containing intermediates. Although numerous endeavors have been devoted to the modification and optimization of transition-metal-based OER electrocatalysts, they are still operated with sluggish kinetics. Herein, an ion-exchange approach is proposed to realize the structure engineering of amorphous P-CoS hollow nanomaterials by utilizing the ZIF-67 nanocubes as the precursors. The precise structure control of the amorphous hollow nanostructure contributes to the large exposure of surface active sites. Moreover, the introduction of phosphorus greatly modifies the electronic structure of CoS2, which is thus favorable for optimizing the binding energies of oxygenated species. Furthermore, the incorporation of phosphorus may also induce the formation of surface defects to regulate the local electronic structure and surface environment. As a result of this, such P-CoS hollow nanocatalysts display remarkable electrocatalytic activity and durability towards OER, which require an overpotential of 283 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm-2, outperforming commercial RuO2 catalyst.

For small area solar cells (<0.1 cm(2)), a solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency of 5.4% is obtained using RuO2 catalysts. Using earth-abundant NiMoZn and Co3O4 catalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution, the efficiency is 4.9%. For larger area (1.7 cm(2)) solar cell devices the solar to hydrogen efficiency with RuO2 catalysts reduces to 3.6% as a consequence of an increased overpotential for water splitting. This shifts the operating point of the water splitting device beyond the maximum power point of the solar cell and reduces the photocurrent.									51	0	0	0	2	0	51			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000365205000035

X-ray diffraction analysis of samples indicates that the pure cubic structure was obtained for composition lower than x = 0.2. The OER studies indicate that substitution of iron by zinc increases the electrocatalytic activity of the resulting material significantly. The highest activity was achieved for x = 0.1, whereas the obtained current density was 9.02 mA cm(-2) at 0.66 V, which is approximately three times higher than that of the base oxide. The Tafel slopes values for OER on each oxide in 1 M KOH are found to be similar to 89, 52, and 64 mV dec(-1) for LaFeO3, LaFe0.9Zn0.1O3, and LaFe0.8Zn0.2O3, respectively. The stability of LaFe0.9Zn0.1O3 electrode is studied in the process of 1000 successive cycles at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) of the OER. A small change in overpotential was found, ranged between 11 and 19 mV, indicating clearly its long electrochemical durability. These results suggest clearly that LaFe0.9Zn0.1O3 electrode is a promising anode material for the OER in water electrolysis.Graphical AbstractLinear sweep voltammetry of LaFe1-xZnxO3 electrodes in 1 M KOH, at a scan rate of 50 mV/s; inset shows the OER current density at 0.66 V vs. Hg/HgO.[GRAPHICS].									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0928-0707	1573-4846		WOS:000554846400002

The formation of an amorphous Zr-rich oxide layer facilitates the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as confirmed by the decrease in the Tafel slope from 109 to 80 mV dec(-1) as well as conservation of its stability over 250 cycles and at long-term open circuit potential measurement, outperforming many of the precious and transition metal-based oxides and their composites. The evolution of additional binding energy at similar to 183.5 eV (Zr3d5 Zr-OH peak) indicates hydroxide ion insertion into the Zr-based metallic glass. The magnitude of impedance (cf. 625 omega cm(2) for as-spun vs 140 omega cm(2) for after-OER at 0.6 V and 100 Hz) and characteristic frequency (c.f. 80 degrees at 0.6 V for as-spun and 30 degrees at 0.9 V for after-OER) vs Ag/AgCl are relatively small for the post-OER electrode compared to the as-spun counterpart, corroborating enhanced kinetics of the post-OER electrode. Modifications in the oxide layer upon the OER yield an enormous increase in ion accumulation and electron transfer with a maximum true capacitance reaching similar to 0.0271 F cm(-2). Thus, a homogeneous combination of inexpensive Earth-abundant metals and an amorphous structure forms a highly active and stable oxide layer to be used for future renewable energy production materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000844518100001

To this end, a generally applicable, dedicated set of experiments has been devised and performed to deduce and correct for the surface stress change owing to oxygen reaction(s) at the (poorly-defined) back face of the specimen only. On this basis, it could be demonstrated that exposure of clean Si(111)-7 x 7, Si(100)-2 x 1 and a-Si surfaces to pure oxygen gas results in compressive surface stress changes for all three surfaces due to the incorporation of oxygen into Si backbonds. The measured surface stress change decreases with decreasing atomic packing density at the clean Si surfaces, which complies well with the less-densily packed Si surface regions containing more free volume for the accommodation of adsorbed O atoms.

In this work, CrFeO3 was synthesized as a new catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The structural and chemical properties of CrFeO3 were characterized by TEM, SEM, EDX, XRD, XPS, and BET analyses. The microscopy images reveal that CrFeO3 have wire-like morphology, which was formed by assembly of ca. 14nm nanocrystallites. Then, potential utility of the synthesized nanowires (NWs) as catalysts in OER has been investigated. The CrFeO3 NW-modified fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) electrodes exhibited promising OER performance with an onset potential of 1.63V vs RHE, overpotential of 737mV at 10mAcm(-2) current density, and Tafel slope of 57mVdec(-1). Additionally, CrFeO3 NWs are demonstrated to be very stable electrocatalyst during OER. The CrFeO3 NWs present an overall electrocatalytic performance that is comparable to the one of RuO2, and promise a great potential as an effective and affordable OER catalyst.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000473149900004

Replacing OER with electro-oxidation of organics driven at a low potential offers an effective way to accelerate the sluggish anode reaction, and thus increase hydrogen evolution in water-splitting. Herein, we have prepared a Ru nanoparticles on N-doped carbon nanotubes (Ru-NPs@NCNTs) to implement electro-oxidation of benzyl alcohol toward reducing the anodic potential in watersplitting. The potential of the anode reaction is remarkably decreased from 1.76 to 1.19 V vs RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with the assistance of a Ru-NPs catalyst. Furthermore, 100% selectivity and 95% yield of valuable benzaldehyde were achieved simultaneously. The Ru-NPs also exhibits good durability and wide applicability to other alcohols. The high performance of Ru-NPs is mainly attributed to the unique horizontal adsorption configuration of benzyl alcohol with surface atoms of the catalyst, shortening the distance between the center dot OH group and Ru atoms, and increasing the activation rate of the center dot OH group. This work presents a feasible strategy to boost water-splitting performance and concurrently produce value-added organics under mild conditions.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000737990400001	34958544

The gaseous byproducts liberated during each of the two distinctive photodecomposition reactions, denoted UV driven decomposition (UVDD) and NIR driven decomposition (NIRDD), were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The oxide films were analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and electrochemical methods. These analyses collectively indicate that the UVDD pathway proceeds through a succession of reactions mediated by light-induced ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) processes that produce a heptyl radical byproduct and a reduced metal that is reactive towards ambient dioxygen. NIRDD is shown to follow thermally driven decomposition pathways that do not produce radicals. The oxide layers formed using both processes are nonetheless strikingly similar in structure and properties, including electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000428847300034

However, the mechanism describing the photothermal effect is not clear and the range of suitable materials is not well developed, limiting the design and applicability of this technique. Herein, taking a series of (Co1-xNix)(3)C (x = 0, 0.1, and 0.2) oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts as model catalysts, the catalytic mechanism of the interfacial photothermal effect (IPE) via concentrated solar irradiation (CSI) is comprehensively uncovered. The temperature/solar irradiation dependence of the polarized cyclic voltammetry (CV) data proves that the chemical basis of the photothermal effects of the catalysts mainly involves enhanced OH- filling at the interface between the catalyst and electrolyte. Hall tests at variable temperatures illustrate that the physical basis for OER enhancement by CSI is that alloyed Ni can cause conversion of the carriers from electrons to holes in Co3C, leading to enhanced conductivity and light absorption and heat conversion abilities. As a result, (Co0.8Ni0.2)(3)C exhibits a 660.3% OER enhancement and requires only a 262 mV overpotential to produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under CSI, making it superior to most reported OER catalysts. Also, for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), (Co0.8Ni0.2)(3)C requires only 69 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under CSI conditions. Finally, this work gives insight into the roots of the photothermal enhancement of OER activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000770074000001

Herein, a facile polymerization-pyrolysis method is proposed to encapsulate Co2P nanoparticles in co-doped hollow carbon shell by using ZIF-67 and Pcontaining polymers as precursor. The unique construction not only effectively prevents nanoparticles from detaching, showing good stability after long-term testing, but also provides abundant active sites, large surface areas and large pore volumes, enabling the electrolyte and electrode material to full contact. As expected, the Co2P/NPSC-800 performs superior HER performance with low overpotential of 173 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability of 88% retention for 35 h and OER performance with low overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which endows Co2P/NPSC-800 with good catalytic activity in overall water-splitting. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the metallic property and the decreased reaction barriers of Co2P can promote the catalytic reactions. This work offers an effective route in synthesizing other transition metal phosphides with high catalytic properties. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We compare the IrO2@TiO2 catalyst to commercial TiO2 supported IrO2 catalyst (IrO2/TiO2) and pure IrO2 catalyst powder. A stability analysis via on-line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry based on the S-number, a descriptor considering both energy efficiency and catalyst utilization efficiency, shows that the IrO2@TiO2 catalyst shows high potential for practical applications. This was further confirmed by full-cell tests showing superior performance of the IrO2@TiO2 catalyst with moderate and low loadings of 1.2 mg(Ir) cm(-2) and 0.4 mg(Ir) cm(-2), respectively. The core-shell catalyst is synthesized via facile route suitable for large quantifies. Moreover, stable inks from the synthesized catalyst powder make this system appealing for large scale manufacturing of cells. Given the facile synthesis route, high activity, and good stability, the IrO2@TiO2 catalyst is potentially suitable for industry proton exchange membrane water electrolysis application.									45	2	0	0	3	0	46			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000532683200021

Herein, the interfacial CoRu-based metal-metal oxide heterostructures embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (RuCoOx-RuCo-NC) were rationally designed and synthesized by using a cobalt-based metal-organic framework (MIL-L-Co) as an effective synthetic platform. RuCoOx-RuCo-NC exhibited superior electrocatalytic OER performance in acidic environments by taking advantage of spatial confinement effect and metal-semiconductor interface. The optimal catalysts afforded a quite small overpotential of only 228 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm- 2 and showed excellent longterm durability within 12 h of operation. Specifically, RuCo-RuCoOx@NC enabled a mass activity as high as 0.933 A mgRu-1 at an overpotential of 300 mV, significantly outperforming the benchmark RuO2 catalyst. RuCoOxRuCo-NC is expected to be one of the best acidic OER electrocatalysts with high apparent and mass activities among Ru/Ir-based catalysts reported.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000674631000002

Heterogeneous materials coupled by transition metal and carbon exhibit high capability for OER in recent years. Here, three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon coupled with Ni and NiO hybrid nanoparticles (Ni-Cx-y, x and y are annealing temperature and time, respectively) is synthesized via high temperature pyrolysis and air annealing treatment. Redox reaction between carbon atoms and nickel ions during synthesis could achieve a high-level graphitization, which greatly enhances the corrosion resistance of catalyst in alkaline solution. The overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of Ni-C500-20 achieve 353 mV and 97 mV dec(-1), respectively. Increased defects and intrinsic activity induced by air annealing process and synergistic effect between carbon, Ni and NiO give rise to the enhanced OER performance of as-prepared catalyst, as confirmed by in-situ Raman spectra. The catalyst conforms to sustainable and economic development concept, being a potential material for OER.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000562342600004

In this work, we have theoretically investigated how ferroelectric polarization and its reversibility in direction can be utilized to modulate the band alignment and optical absorption properties. For this objective, 2D van der Waals heterostructures (HTSs) are constructed by interfacing monolayer MoS(2)with ferroelectric In2Se3. We find the switch of polarization direction has dramatically changed the band alignment, thus facilitating different type of reactions. In In2Se3/MoS2/In(2)Se(3)heterostructures, one polarization direction supports hydrogen evolution reaction and another polarization direction can favour oxygen evolution reaction. These can be used to create tuneable photocatalyst materials where water reduction reactions can be selectively controlled by polarization switching. The modulation of band alignment is attributed to the shift of reaction potential caused by spontaneous polarization. Additionally, the formed type-II van der Waals HTSs also significantly improve charge separation and enhance the optical absorption in the visible and infrared regions. Our results pave a way in the design of van der Waals HTSs for water splitting using ferroelectric materials.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2095-0462	2095-0470		WOS:000569873300001

However, the influence of micro-mixing efficiency during coprecipitation reaction on the oxygen vacancy concentration in CeO2-based catalysts was scarce. In this work, a rotating packed bed (RPB) reactor was employed to intensify the micro-mixing of reactants before crystal nucleation, aiming to increase the oxygen vacancy concentration of CeO2-based catalysts. The MOx-CeO2 (M = Cu, Co, Fe) catalysts prepared in the RPB reactor featured more M-O-Ce species and 1.3 - 1.4 times concentration of oxygen vacancy compared to those prepared in a stirred tank reactor (STR). The RPB-CuO-CeO2 catalyst showed an elevated reaction rate of CO (6.70 x 10(-4) mol g(cat)(-1) s(-1)) at 90 degrees C and remained unchanged after 8 cycles in CO oxidation. This work demonstrates a feasible "non-chemical" strategy to prepare the high-activity solid solution catalysts with increased oxygen vacancies. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

As a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, CuxCo1-xP/CP showed high HER activity at all pH values. To drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the optimized Cu0.075Co0.925P/CP required an overpotential of 47, 120, and 70 mV in acidic, neutral, and alkaline media, respectively. In addition, Cu0.075Co0.925P/CP exhibited excellent activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a small overpotential of 221 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, when Cu0.075Co0.925P/CP was used as both the cathode and anode for overall water splitting in 1.0 M KOH, the two-electrode electrolyzer only needed a cell voltage of 1.55 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to that of the noble metal-based Pt/C||IrO2 cell and most previously reported electrocatalysts. Moreover, this electrolyzer could be powered by a single AA battery with a voltage of 1.5 V. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further proved that the good catalytic activity of CuxCo1-xP/CP resulted from its smaller hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(H*)) and overpotential. This work provides a promising strategy to design high-performance and low-cost electrocatalysts for overall water splitting and other energy-related applications.									51	2	0	0	5	0	51			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472566400043

However, the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) underperforms in view of the wide band gap (BG) and fast charge recombination in In2O3. N-doping provides a sound method to narrow the BG and to prohibit the charge recombination by forming new energy levels between the valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB). In this work, an In-based organic framework sod-ZMOF was used as a precursor to prepare the N-doped In2O3. After calcination, sod-ZMOF is transformed into N-doped In2O3 nanocrystalline, in which the ligand within sod-ZMOF serves as the nitrogen source. In addition, sod-ZMOF acts as self-template during calcination to generate abundant nanopores within the In2O3 frameworks, providing large specific surface area and active sites for OER. The BG is narrowed to 2.9 from 3.7 eV of the pure In2O3 on account of the N-doping. N species are doped in both the substitutional and interstitial fashion, and the interstitial doping is believed to improve the photo-induced carrier separation by the formation of oxygen vacancies. As a consequence, the overpotential for OER is effectively decreased from the pure In2O3, and the electrocatalytic experiment proves superior catalytic activity with a high current density and long-term durability compared to the In2O3 nanoparticles obtained from In(OH)(3).									28	1	0	0	1	0	28			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000402640600018	28233355

Herein, conceptually new metallic non-metal atomic layers are proposed to overcome this drawback. Metallic single-unit-cell CoSe2 sheets with an orthorhombic phase are synthesized by thermally exfoliating a lamellar CoSe2-DETA hybrid. The metallic character of orthorhombic CoSe2 atomic layers, verified by DFT calculations and temperature-dependent resistivities, allows fast oxygen evolution kinetics with a lowered overpotential of 0.27 V. The single-unit-cell thickness means 66.7% of the Co2+ ions are exposed on the surface and serve as the catalytically active sites. The lowered Co2+ coordination number down to 1.3 and 2.6, gives a lower Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1) and higher turnover frequency of 745 h(-1). Thus, the single-unit-cell CoSe2 sheets have around 2 and 4.5 times higher catalytic activity compared with the lamellar CoSe2-DETA hybrid and bulk CoSe2.									154	8	0	0	6	0	157			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000363396000018	26235276

In this work, a HfS2/GaS van der Waals heterostructure (vdwH) has been designed to achieve efficient and spontaneous water decomposition. Through first-principles calculation, HfS2/GaS vdwH has been proved to be a stable and promising photocatalyst with the following obvious advantages: both water reduction and oxidation potentials are located in the band gap of HfS2/GaS vdwH (2.04 eV), ensuring that water splitting can occur. The type-II band structure and built-in electric field ensure the effective separation of photoelectron-hole, and the high mobility of electrons and holes can also predict high photocatalytic activity. By calculating the free energy of the oxygen evolution reaction on the surface of GaS and the hydrogen evolution reaction on the surface of HfS2 of the heterostructure, it's found that the water decomposition reaction can occur spontaneously under light. Furthermore, after 1-6% in-plane biaxial tensile strain was applied, the redox reaction of photocatalytic decomposition water can still occur on the HfS2/GaS vdwH, and the application of strain can effectively regulate the optical and electronic properties. Therefore, HfS2/GaS vdwH could be a promising candidate material for the photocatalytic decomposition of water.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1386-9477	1873-1759		WOS:000794945600001

Herein, we report nickel phosphide 40 (NixPy) catalysts with the controllable phases as the efficient bifunctional catalysts for water electrolysis. The phases of NixPy were determined by the temperatures of the solid-phase reaction between the ultrathin Ni(OH)(2) plates and NaH2PO2 center dot H2O. The NixPy with the richest Ni5P4 phase synthesized at 325 degrees C (NixPy-325) delivered efficient and robust catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the electrolytes with a wide pH range. The NixPy-325 catalysts also exhibited a remarkable performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a strong alkaline electrolyte (1.0 M KOH) due to the formation of surface NiOOH species. Furthermore, the bifunctional NixPy-325 catalysts enabled a highly performed overall water-splitting with similar to 100% Faradaic efficiency in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, in which a low applied external potential of 1.57 V led to a stabilized catalytic current density of 10 mA/cm(2) over 60 h.									165	7	0	0	6	0	166			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000375520700021	27064172

However, the direct thermolysis of CPs is prone to generate agglomerates, greatly reducing the electrical conductivity and active sites of their derived catalysts. The construction of well-ordered CP nanostructures is a promising strategy for alleviating the above issue, but it remains challenging. Here, a facile chemical etching approach is developed for the fabrication of well-aligned three-dimensional (3D) bimetallic Prussian blue-analogue nanosheet arrays. Impressively, the derived porous metal oxide (Fe-NiO) acts as a remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, which merely requires overpotentials as low as 218 and 270 mV to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 m KOH aqueous solution, respectively. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of Fe-NiO is ascribed to the 3D porous nanosheet array architecture, which endows the bimetallic catalyst with abundant electrocatalytic active sites, enhanced surface permeability, and high electronic conductivity. It is expected that the proposed strategy can pave a new way for fabricating highly efficient electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000449952200003	30179309

Here, we demonstrate that the characteristic (root 2x root 2)R45 degrees surface reconstruction formed on (001)-oriented magnetite single crystals is maintained after immersion in 0.1 M NaOH at 0.20 V vs. Ag/AgCl and we investigate its dependence on the electrode potential. We follow the evolution of the surface using in situ and operando surface X-ray diffraction from the onset of hydrogen evolution, to potentials deep in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) regime. The reconstruction remains stable for hours between -0.20 and 0.60 V and, surprisingly, is still present at anodic current densities of up to 10 mA cm(-2)and strongly affects the OER kinetics. We attribute this to a stabilization of the Fe(3)O(4)bulk by the reconstructed surface. At more negative potentials, a gradual and largely irreversible lifting of the reconstruction is observed due to the onset of oxide reduction.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000573357700001	32729209

We synthesized herein a kind of Co3O4 nano-microspheres by a two-step method. Pink cobalt glycerate nano-microspheres were firstly synthesized by solvothermal method, and then Co3O4 nanomicrospheres were synthesized by high temperature annealing. Four Co3O4 nano-microspheres composed of different nanoparticles were synthesized by adjusting annealing temperature accurately. Electrochemical tests showed that the Co3O4 nano-microspheres prepared at 300 degrees C exhibit the best catalytic activity for OER. The overpotential is only 356 mV to obtain 10 mA/cm2 current density. And the value of Tafel slope is 65 mV dec-1. Compared with the other Co3O4 nano-microspheres synthesized at higher temperature (400 ~ 600 degrees C), the outstanding catalytic activity could be due to the Co3O4 nano-microspheres synthesized at 300 degrees C are composed of smaller nanoparticles, which could offer lots of catalytic active sites for adsorption and oxidation of OH-. This work put forward valuable reference for the design of high-efficiency catalysts in the field of OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000817822800005

The emergence of the core-shell heterostructure has invoked new feasibilities to inspire the full potential of non-precious-metal candidates. The shells always have a large thickness, affording robust mechanical properties under harsh reaction conditions, which limits the full exposure of active sites with highly intrinsic reactivity and extrinsic physicochemical characters for optimal performance. Herein, a nanosized CoNi hydroxide@hydroxysulfide core-shell heterostructure is fabricated via an ethanol-modified surface sulfurization method. Such a synthetic strategy is demonstrated to be effective in controllably fabricating a core-shell heterostructure with an ultrathin shell (4 nm) and favorable exposure of active sites, resulting in a moderately regulated electronic structure, remarkably facilitated charge transfer, fully exposed active sites, and a strongly coupled heterointerface for energy electrocatalysis. Consequently, the as-obtained hydroxide@hydroxysulfide core-shell is revealed as a superior OER catalyst, with a small overpotential of 274.0 mV required for 10.0 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 45.0 mV dec(-1), and a favorable long-term stability in 0.10 M KOH. This work affords fresh concepts and strategies for the design and fabrication of advanced core-shell heterostructures, and thus opens up new avenues for the targeted development of high-performance energy materials.									200	31	0	0	6	0	202			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000456325900013	30515883

Herein, we demonstrate bio-inspired heterometallic LnCo(3) (Ln = Nd, Eu and Ce) clusters, which can be viewed as synthetic analogs of the CaMn4O5 cluster. Anchoring LnCo(3) on phosphorus-doped graphitic carbon nitrides (PCN) shows efficient overall water splitting without any sacrificial reagents. The NdCo3/PCN-c photocatalyst exhibits excellent water splitting activity and a quantum efficiency of 2.0% at 350 nm. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy revealed the transfer of a photoexcited electron and hole into the PCN and LnCo(3) for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively. A density functional theory (DFT) calculation showed the cooperative water activation on lanthanide and O-O bond formation on transition metal for water oxidation. This work not only prepares a synthetic model of a bio-inspired oxygen-evolving center but also provides an effective strategy to realize light-driven overall water splitting.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2095-5138	2053-714X		WOS:000701659300003	34691725

In this work, the FeCoP nanoparticles decorated on N-doped electrospun carbon nanofibers (FeCoP@NCNFs) was successfully synthesized through depositing Fe, Co-based Prussian blue analogue Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2)center dot 10H(2)O (FeCo-PBA) onto the electrospun PVP/PAN nanofibers via layer-by-layer approach, followed by carbonization and phosphorization treatments. Benefiting from the high electrical conductivity, abundant catalytic active sites and the synergistic effect between FeCoP nanoparticles and N-doped carbon nanofibers network, the obtained FeCoP@NCNFs displays good bifunctional electrocatalytic activity. In 1 M KOH, the FeCoP@NCNFs achieves 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 290, 226 mV for OER and HER, respectively. Moreover, it demands overpotential of 196 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4. The FeCoP@NCNFs is used as both anode and cathode for overall water splitting, it requires a low voltage of 1.65 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and maintains outstanding stability over 10 h. Herein, a strategy for preparing bifunctional electrocatalysts of compositing transition metal phosphides with carbon nanofibers is proposed, and the application of metal-organic framework in electrocatalytic field is further extended.

Water splitting is a large-scale and sustainable technology for high-purity hydrogen production. However, the substantial overpotential and unsatisfied stability of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts are great challenges for the widespread application of water splitting technology. Rational design of the structure of the OER electrocatalyst can significantly optimize its reaction thermodynamics and kinetics, thus improving the energy conversion efficiency of water splitting technology. The surface/interface is regarded as the main place where the electrocatalytic reaction occurs. The electrocatalysts, modified by surface/interface engineering, such as regulating intrinsic properties or designing synergistic interface, can improve their electrocatalytic efficiency and stability effectively. This review summarizes the application of surface/interface modulation strategies in OER, especially focusing on the research progress of layered double hydroxides, perovskite oxides, spinet compounds and alloy based materials. The design principles of high-efficient and stable electrocatalysts for OER are described. Based on the recent progress of surface/interface modulation applied in catalysts for OER, the effects of surface/interface modulation on the microstructure and electronic states of the catalysts are discussed. In addition, the challenges about modifications of above electrocatalysts are discussed. Finally, the opportunities of OER electrocatalysts via surface/interface modulation are prospected.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1005-281X			WOS:000793178300002

However, much of the structure-activity relationship is poorly understood. Herein, the comprehensive development of manganese cobalt oxide/nitrogen-doped multiwalled carbon nanotube hybrids (MnxCo3-xO4@NCNTs) is reported for highly reversible oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER, respectively). The hybrid structures are rationally designed by fine control of surface chemistry and synthesis conditions, including tuning of functional groups at surfaces, congruent growth of nanocrystals with controllable phases and particle sizes, and ensuring strong coupling across catalyst-support interfaces. Electrochemical tests reveal distinctly different oxygen catalytic activities among the hybrids, MnxCo3-xO4@NCNTs. Nanocrystalline MnCo2O4@NCNTs (MCO@NCNTs) hybrids show superior ORR activity, with a favorable potential to reach 3 mAcm(-2) and a high current density response, equivalent to that of the commercial Pt/C standard. Moreover, the hybrid structure exhibits tunable and durable catalytic activities for both ORR and OER, with a lowest overall potential of 0.93 V. It is clear that the long-term electrochemical activities can be ensured by rational design of hybrid structures from the nanoscale.									41	4	0	0	0	0	42			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000430914600005	29443459

However, the overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction process and consumption of Ir during charging in SPE water electrolysis will inevitably result in large energy loss and then high cost. Under these circumstances, we propose a novel 40IrO(2)/CoxSn(1-x)O2 (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) anode catalyst, where the CoxSn(1-x)O2 support is synthesized by a hydrothermal method and IrO2 is synthesized by a modified Adams fusion method. After modifying the component of CoxSn(1-x)O2, the 40IrO(2)/CoxSn(1-x)O2 exhibits an increased specific surface area, electrical conductivity and surface active sites. Moreover, a single cell is fabricated by Pt/C as cathode catalyst, 40IrO(2)/CoxSn(1-x)O-2 as anode catalyst and Nafion 117 membrane as electrolyte. The 40IrO(2)/Co0.2Sn0.8O2 exhibits the lowest overpotential (1.748 V at 1000 mA cm(-2)), and only 0.18 mV h(-1) of voltage increased for 100 h durability test at 1000 mA cm(-2). Consequently, CoxSn(1-x)O2 is a promising anode electrocatalyst support for an SPE water electrolyzer.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2054-5703			WOS:000466513900032	31183144

Here, a novel free-standing metal-free carbon-based bifunctional electrocatalyst (NFS-CNF) with uniform multiple heteroatom (N, F and S) doping and large specific surface area (1450.7 m(2) g(-1)), was firstly synthesized by direct pyrolysis of electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/polymerized ionic liquid (PIL) nanofibers. The as-prepared NFS-CNF presents superior oxygen catalytic performance as well as excellent durability, exhibiting a positive half-wave potential (0.91 V) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a low overpotential (380 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. Notably, the outstanding bifunctional ORR/OER activity (Delta E=0.70 V) endows remarkable Zn-air battery performance with a peak power density of 127.5 mW cm(-2), a high specific capacity of 826.4 mAh g(Zn)(-1) (corresponding to an energy density of similar to 991 Wh kg(Zn)(-1)), a stable cyclability after 600 cycles at 10 mA cm- 2 with a voltage gap increase as small as 0.1 V. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the N, F, S tri-doping contributes to the improvement in the electrochemical properties of our material. Our work firstly experimentally demonstrates a simple pathway of combining PIL precursor and electrospinning technology to achieve multiple heteroatom doping in metal-free nanofibrous bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts with greatly enhanced electrochemical activity and durability. Additionally, the realization of efficient rechargeable Zn-air batteries suggests the promising future of our NFS-CNF pieces as robust free-standing air cathodes in various sustainable energy applications.

However, the low thermal stability typically caused by detrimental oxygen release leads to significant safety concerns. Determining the pathways of oxygen evolution reaction is essential, as the ideal safety countermeasure is to break the reaction chain of thermal runaway. In this study, we demonstrate that two endogenous pathways of oxygen involved in strong exothermic reactions lead the NMC811|graphite pouch cell to an uncontrollable state, and we quantify the individual contribution of the pathways to thermal runaway. Approximately 41% of thermal-induced oxygen reacts aggressively with ethylene carbonate (EC) at the cathode/electrolyte interface with 16% heat generation, accelerating the self-heating rate and thereby further triggering thermal runaway. The residual oxygen that survives the reaction with carbonate spreads to the lithiated anode with major heat generation (65%), bringing the battery to the maximum destructive temperature during thermal runaway. By confirming the significant roles of EC and anode, a deeper understanding on battery fire was achieved. The revealed mechanism can help guide studies on stopping the two reaction pathways, allowing for the safer use of high-energy lithium-ion batteries in the future.									14	2	0	0	2	0	15			2405-8297			WOS:000655750300004

Two-dimensional (2D) metal organic frameworks (MOF) and their derivatives are widely regarded as promising electrocatalysts (EC) for OER due to its unique structural characteristics. Here, by optimizing the molar ratio of Ni to Co, bimetal 2-methylimidazole based 2D-MOF is synthesized and its derivatives are also obtained by phosphorization or oxidation. OER measurements prove that the original MOF structure with 5% Ni/Co molar ratio shows excellent activity with 310 mV overpotential (eta) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution for OER, as well as a fairly good electrochemical stability rather than their oxidation or phosphorus derivatives. This work introduces a facile method to prepare bimetal imidazole-based 2D-MOF directly applied in energy conversion field without transformation, making a contribution for opening a new window of widely application of 2D-MOF and improving the hydrogen production efficiency from water splitting.

The powder size of raw materials and sintering temperature have been changed to study the effect of these fabrication parameters on the pore structure and the electrochemical performance of the porous Mn5Si3 electrodes. The effect of Mn ions on the corrosion behaviours of the porous Mn5Si3 electrodes has also been investigated. The results indicated that lower sintering temperature in the investigated range led to higher porosity, smaller average pore size and better catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This phenomenon can be attribute to the larger active surface area of this pore structure. The average pore size increased with the incremental of powder size of Si, however, it appeared that porosity and catalytic activity were almost unchanged, which indicated that pore size has a weak effect on the catalytic activity. Presence of Mn ions in solutions can improve the corrosion resistance of the porous Mn5Si3 electrodes, for Mn ions help form an oxide film on the surface of the electrodes, blocking continuous dissolution of the inside Mn5Si3.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2053-1591			WOS:000471640600003

Ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) is an effective tool to study metal-oxygen reactions but has been limited to solid-state environments. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate in situ probing of potassium oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) via APXPS in ionic liquid-based air batteries. We reveal the formation and oxidation of K2O and K2O2 in K-O-2 batteries, highlighting new reaction pathways in addition to the widely established one-electron process in K-O-2 batteries. Importantly, we show that the formation and subsequent oxidation of K2O2 trigger irreversible cell chemistry, which could be responsible for capacity decay in K-O-2 batteries. We further show that common impurities in air such as H2O and CO2 reduce chemical reversibility of ORR and OER. This study reveals root causes of irreversible cell chemistry in K-air batteries via direct probing of ionic liquid-based air batteries via APXPS, which can be widely applied to study the chemistry of solid/liquid interfaces of metal-air batteries.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2405-8297			WOS:000697583100008

The electrochemical performance of the Ni3S2/MoSx nanosheets on NF has been investigated and exhibits superior OER electrocatalytic activity as well as excellent electrochemical durability. As a novel non-noble-metal OER catalyst operating in basic electrolytes, this 3D cathode exhibits an onset overpotential of as low as 165 mV, a Tafel slope of 67.5 mV dec(-1) and remarkable long-term stability. This catalyst maintains its catalytic activity for at least 14 h and only affords 50, 100, and 150 mA cm(-2) OER current densities at overpotentials of 215 mV, 265 mV and 305 mV respectively.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000413134600018

However, most of the well-developed electrocatalysts are semiconductors or insulators with poor conductivity, which has profoundly inhibited their overall OER efficiency. In this study, metallic cobalt nitrides (Co2N, Co3N and Co4N) arising from electron delocalization modulation have been investigated for OER electrocatalysts in alkaline solution for the first time. Benefiting from the synergistical engineering of the electrical conductivity and nitrogen content, the simple metallic Co4N catalyst without modifications exhibits a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 330 mV for OER with a Tafel slope as low as 58 mV dec(-1) in alkaline medium, which is superior to most of the unmodified metal oxide electrocatalysts reported to date.

Here, metal-ion (Fe, V, Co, and Ni)-doped MnO2 ultrathin nanosheets electrodeposited on carbon fiber paper (CFP) are fabricated using a facile anodic co-electrodeposition method. A high density of nanoclusters is observed on the surface of the carbon fibers consisting of doped MnO2 ultrathin nanosheets with an approximate thickness of 5 nm. It is confirmed that the metal ions (Fe, V, Co, and Ni) are doped into MnO2, improving the conductivity of MnO2. The doped MnO2 ultrathin nanosheet/CFP and the IrO2/CFP composite electrodes for OER achieve a low overpotential of 390 and 245 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH, respectively. The potential of the doped composite electrode for long-term OER at a constant current density of 20 mA cm(-2) is much lower than that of the pure MnO2 composite electrode.									145	9	0	0	10	0	147			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000416035400017

Perovskite oxides have been regarded as promising OER catalysts due to their superior activity and compositional flexibility. In this work, a nanofilm of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta deposited on nickel foam (BSCF-NF) was fabricated by pulsed laser deposition (PLD), and the real-time dynamic surface change was observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy. In addition, a surface reductive strategy is applied to BSCF-NF, which is then demonstrated to facilitate the formation of active species on B-site cations, resulting in enhanced OER activity. The reconstruction activation potential of BSCF-NF is reduced after the reductive treatment. The correlation between surface electron structure and catalytic activity is established and discussed. This work provides not only a facile strategy for promoting the formation of active species but also an in-depth understanding of the fundamental processes of surface reconstruction and the origins behind the improved OER performance for perovskite catalysts.

Herein, the flower-like phosphates were grown in situ on a porous microwave sintered CoCrFeNiMo high entropy alloy (HEA) by the hydrothermal-phosphorization method. The metal phosphates can promote the formation of hydroxides with high catalytic activity on the surface of the catalyst. The obtained porous HEA phosphates exhibit a low overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 30.3 mV dec(-1) and superior stability in 1.0 M KOH. Especially, after continuous cyclic voltammetry (CV) 5000 cycles, the catalyst only requires the overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The enhanced OER performance of this porous HEA is be attributed to 3D internal connected nanoporous structure, high conductivity, abundant metal (oxy)hydroxide nanosheets and the presence of phosphonates, that provides a sufficiently large surface exposure and allows the acceleration of the electron transfer rate between various species.

Both hydrothermally synthesized and electrodeposited, CoTe and CoTe2 show efficient electrocatalytic activities. CoTe shows better efficiency for OER with a low Tafel slope (43.8 mV dec(-1)) and lower overpotential (200 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) compared to CoTe2. DFT studies have also been performed which revealed that CoTe showed higher adsorption energy for intermediate -OH adsorption on the catalyst surface, which corresponds to the catalyst activation step. Comparison of the -OH adsorption energies (E-ads) on different catalyst surfaces with the observed overpotential also revealed that this Eads can be used as an appropriate descriptor for benchmarking catalytic efficiencies. Both CoTe and CoTe2 exhibited improved OER catalytic efficiency compared to Co3O4, confirming the primary hypothesis that decreasing anion electronegativity enhances catalytic efficiency by virtue of increasing lattice covalency around the catalytically active site. The difference in OER catalytic activity between CoTe and CoTe2 could be explained from fundamental materials chemistry concepts by comparing their lattice structures which showed different packing density of catalytically active Co sites as well as varying unsaturation of Co-terminated surfaces. Band structure calculations also corroborated such differences and could potentially explain the difference in activity due to observed differences in electron density distribution around the catalytically active Co site. The cobalt telluride compositions also showed moderate HER and ORR activity in alkaline medium, making them trifunctional catalysts which can be used in practical devices. Both CoTe and CoTe2 showed extensive functional and compositional stability for OER, HER, and ORR, under continuous operation in alkaline medium for over 24 h with less than 5% degradation of current density. The excellent compositional stability of each catalyst was revealed by detailed electrochemical measurements and surface and bulk analytical characterizations, which confirmed that there was no catalyst leaching even with long-term operation and no other impurity enrichment in the electrolyte.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2574-0962			WOS:000688250200077

The morphology and structure of nanostructural Pt/IrO2 composites were characterized by XRD, EDX and FE-SEM. The reduction of PtCl62- ions in sodium borohydride aqueous solu tion containing sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) additive leads to a fine dispersion and high loading of platinum nanoparticles on IrO2 without serious aggregation. A slight up-shift of the 20 values in XRD patterns indicates some interaction between IrO2 and Pt nanoparticles in the sizes of ca. 10-20 nm. As bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen electrode, IrO2-supported Pt exhibits slightly lower oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity but markedly higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity than a mixture of Pt and IrO2. It could be explained by the downshift of the d-band center (is an element of d) through the d-band coupling model and resulting weak O-2 molecule adsorption on Pt catalysts supported by IrO2.

The electronic properties, optical absorption, and mobility are calculated by using the obtained structures. The projected band edges and the interfacial built-in electric fields for the two monolayers demonstrate that the two configurations are type-II heterostructures that can match the conditions for photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water splitting, while the other two configurations have no satisfactory band edge for the overall water splitting. The corrected STH efficiency (eta '(STH)) is calculated based on the obtained overpotentials and bandgaps, which give 25.24% and 25.07% for the two configurations, respectively. The effects of strain engineering on eta '(STH) are also investigated but turn out to be not significant. In addition, the Gibbs free energy changes (delta Gs) are calculated to confirm the thermodynamic feasibilities of the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions. The obtained delta Gs in the redox reaction for the two configurations indicate that the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions are feasible from the view of thermodynamics. Apparently, the HfSe2/InSe heterostructure is a potential candidate for developing high STH efficiency photocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000859394100002

However, the substrates are usually metal oxides that are hardly capable of withstanding harsh OER conditions. Therefore, at present, it remains a critical challenge to design more effective and robust catalyst-support materials. Here, we synthesized cerium-decorated iridium dioxide (IrO2) on the surface of alpha-MnO2 nanorods through a two-step hydrothermal process. The performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM), pore size distribution analysis, and electrochemical measurements confirmed that the growth of IrO2 and CeO2 nanoparticles well covered the surface of the substrate alpha-MnO2. Additionally, X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses suggested Ce decoration causing lattice distortion in IrO2 and high 5d occupation, which resulted further in the OER activity enhancement. The specific mass activity of the prepared hybrid was found to be 5 times higher than that of IrO2 with excellent stability equivalent to that of non-Ce-modified catalyst. Thus, we demonstrate that surface engineering is a promising way to develop catalysts with more efficiency and robustness.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2574-0962			WOS:000537656400043

A series of novel semiconductive CoNi bimetal-organic framework (CoxNi3-x(HAB)(2) MOF) have been prepared using hexaaminobenzene (HAB) as an organic linker. The obtained series of CoxNi3-x(HAB)(2) MOFs were then explored as efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts for the non-Pt MOR and overall water splitting in alkaline medium. The basic characterizations of CoxNi3-x(HAB)(2) MOFs revealed that they comprised multiple metal valence states (Co-0/Co2+/Co3+ and Ni2+/Ni3+) and graphene-like nanostructures embedded with abundant CoNi alloy nanoparticles. Compared with the sole-metal MOFs (Co-3(HAB)(2) MOF and Ni-3(HAB)(2) MOF), the CoxNi3-x(HAB)(2) MOF with a mass ratio of Co:Ni = 1:3 (CoxNi3-x(HAB)(2) MOF-2) exhibited superior electrocatalytic performance for MOR. It gave a high current density of 92.8 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for MOR, along with the low overpotentials at the current density of 10 mV cm(-2) (eta(10)) and Tafel slopes toward hydrogen evolution reaction (eta(10) = 119 mV, Tafel slope = 46 mV dec(-1)) and oxygen evolution reaction (eta(10) = 1.35 V, Tafel slope = 26 mV dec(-1)). The analysis on the catalysis mechanism of MOR and water splitting in alkaline medium was also proposed. The voltages applied to the threeand two electrode systems based on the bifunctional CoxNi3-x(HAB)(2) MOF-2 catalyst for overall water splitting are 1.52 V vs. RHE and 1.45 V vs. silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl), respectively. This work provides a novel strategy for investigating the applications of promising two-dimensional semiconductive MOF as multi-functional electrocatalysts with boosted electrocatalytic activities in energy fields.

Here, mixed metal phosphides of Ni2P-CoP anchored on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (NiCoP/N-rGO) as efficient and earth-abundant electrocatalysts for water splitting are reported. The large active sites, synergism, and hybridization with N-doped rGO endow NiCoP/N-rGO electrocatalyst with outstanding oxygen evolution reaction activity that is better than benchmark RuO2 in alkaline electrolyte, as well as active hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic, neutral, and alkaline solution. NiCoP/N-rGO has further been employed as both anode and cathode in a two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzer towards overall water splitting, exhibiting advanced electrochemical performances with a low cell voltage of 1.57 V at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the overall water splitting in this two-electrode electrolyzer can be driven by a single-cell AA battery (nominal voltage of 1.5 V), making NiCoP/N-rGO as the promising efficient cost-effective catalysts for water electrolysis.

This is particularly important from the environmental perspective. Here we report a SBA-15 type, 2D-hexagonal functionalized mesoporous organosilica material as support for small Ag nanoparticles (NPs) by grafting the silica surface with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, followed by chemical impregnation of Ag NPs at its surface, to obtain a AgNPs@SBA-NH2 material. The AgNPs@SBA-NH2 has been thoroughly characterized using several instrumental tools, such as powder X-ray diffraction, ultra-high resolution transition electron microscopy, N-2 sorption, FT-IR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. High Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and fine dispersion of Ag NPs throughout the surface of the amine-functionalized mesoporous material could enhance the rate of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity for AgNPs@SBA-NH2 in the electrochemical water splitting reaction.									29	0	0	0	2	0	29			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000457874200033	30681679

Therefore, herein, a superiorly active and durable bifunctional electrocatalyst made of copper (Cu) and cobalt (Co) nanoparticle-co-decorated N-doped graphene nanosheets (CuCo@N-C) is reported, which shows the low oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) potential gap (E) of 0.65 V; the catalytic activity of CuCo@N-C is promoted by the co-decoration of copper and cobalt nanoparticles due to the strong electron transfer between Cu and Co, enhanced active surface area, and strongly facilitated reaction kinetics. Accordingly, the aqueous Zn-air battery (ZAB) assembled with CuCo@N-C as the air electrode exhibited the high voltage of 1.51 V, the maximum power density of 170 mW cm(-2) (1.48 V and 165 mW cm(-2) for Pt/C, respectively), and excellent device cycling stability. The solid-like ZAB thus constructed showed the low voltage gap of 0.76 V at 40 mA cm(-2) and the high energy efficiency of 72% at 10 mA cm(-2) with an excellent cyclic stability (50 h). In addition to increasing the application potential of ZABs in flexible devices, this study provides a new perception for the correlation between bi-metallic nanoparticles and N-doped graphene and a new avenue for the reasonable design of bifunctional electrocatalysts for ZABs.									37	3	0	0	5	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472219400048

However, the mechanism of the carbonization reaction remains largely unknown. Structural evolution of PAN during the preoxidation reaction, a stabilization reaction, is one of the most complicated stages because many chemical reactions, including cyclization, dehydration, and cross-linking reactions, simultaneously take place. Here, we report the stabilization reaction of single PAN chains within the one-dimensional nanochannels of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to study an effect of interchain interactions on the stabilization process as well as the structure of the resulting ladder polymer (LP). The stabilization reaction of PAN within the MOFs could suppress the rapid generation of heat that initiates the self-catalyzed reaction and inevitably provokes many side-reactions and scission of PAN chains in the bulk state. Consequently, LP prepared within the MOFs had a more extended conjugated backbone than the bulk condition.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000577727000027	34094338

Herein, we report a facile synthesis of Co/CoO hybrids with oxygen vacancies on carbon cloth (CC) via the calcination treatment of a Co3O4 precursor in a reducing atmosphere (H-2/Ar). Moreover, to avoid delamination and cracks during heat treatment and catalyst abscission during the HER test, the precursor of Co(OH)(2) was stabilized on CC by the anion intercalation method, resulting in robust adhesion between the film and substrate. The as-prepared Co/CoO hybrids rooted on the CC substrate possessed good charge transfer properties, favorable kinetics, abundant active sites, and robust adhesion. A suitable reducing atmosphere was crucial for high catalytic activity. By optimizing, the sample obtained in a 30% H-2/Ar atmosphere (Co/CoO-30) possessed an optimal balance between Co/CoO and oxygen vacancies, exhibiting optimum HER performance with the smallest overpotential of 158 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 68.1 mV dec(-1) as well as good stability, operating for at least 24 h.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2398-4902			WOS:000526855200036

Peptone was used as carbon and nitrogen source during the synthesis and NaCl presence as a template resulted in the formation of open mesopores interconnected by thin carbon sheets with nanosized Ni particles encapsulated in the carbon matrix. A low onset potential of 53 mV and a charge transfer resistance of 3.8 Omega with excellent cycling stability were demonstrated when the optimized catalyst Ni-2 was applied in HER. It was also shown that Ni-2 onset potential, charge transfer resistance, and durability in OER were comparable to those of a commercial RuO2 catalyst.

Thus, it is necessary to search and develop non-precious metal electrocatalysts with remarkable activity. In this work, copper is cleverly doped into the octahedral sites of Co9S8 to strengthen the Co-Co bond and then combined with nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres to achieve high catalytic activity and durability for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). The prepared Cu-Co9S8-NHCS-1 exhibits the potential gap of 0.788 V between E-j=10 of OER and E-1/2 of ORR. Moreover, the zinc-air battery with Cu-Co9S8-NHCS-1 cathode possesses a power density of 91.0 mW cm(-2) and long-term stability over 120 h. The MFC using Cu-Co9S8-NHCS-1 cathode exhibits a power density of 924 +/- 18 mW m(-2), higher than that of 862 +/- 20 mW m(-2) with Pt/C. These results indicate that the Cu-Co9S8-NHCS-1 is an excellent bi-functional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER, and has promising applications in energy conversion. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, to promote the net electron yield of alcohol oxidation, often it is necessary to incorporate one or more co-catalyst(s) with Ni. The material designs of such electrodes rely on adequately identifying the application-specific catalytic functions of Ni as well as the needs for co-catalysts. Using a Ni anode, we explore this topic for a model case of glycerol (Gly) oxidation in an alkaline (NaOH based) electrolyte. Scan rate-dependent voltammetry is used to determine the electron count of Gly oxidation, and the anode's electrochemical stability is checked by chronoamperometry. The results show that anodically formed nickel hydroxide on Ni catalyzes the rate-determining initial oxidation step of Gly to glyceraldehyde, where nickel oxyhydroxide is generated as an intermediate phase of the catalyst. The NiOOH surface species also acts as a catalyst for anodic oxygen evolution, and this interferes with further oxidation of Gly. These findings are further clarified using impedance spectroscopy and are discussed in view of designing Ni-based anodes for direct glycerol fuel cells.									6	1	0	0	0	1	6			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000418815500011

An established method to prepare Fe-free KOH electrolyte is by using particulate Ni(OH)(2) or Co(OH)(2) as absorbents to remove the Fe from KOH or other neutral-to-alkaline electrolytes. However, this method yields residual Ni or Co species in the electrolyte which can be redeposited on the working electrode. Thus, current methods of Fe removal could convolute studies of OER. In this work, we compared two different methods, continuous electrolysis and nano-filtration, to remove the Ni and/or Co species from Fe-free alkaline electrolyte. We found the best approach is to pass the Fe-free electrolyte through a hydrophilic 0.1 mu m polyethersulfone filter which decreases the Ni species concentration in 1 M KOH to single ppb levels. This result suggests the remaining Ni or Co species are primarily particulate in nature, consistent with their small solubility as ions. In comparison, extended pre-electrolysis of the electrolyte removed only a portion of the Ni/Co.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000824534600001

However, developing nonprecious metal oxides as splendid bifunctional electrocatalysts in alkaline conditions remains a great challenge. Herein, we developed a smart soaking strategy of sulfur/iron ion modification, by which we could activate Co3O4 to spontaneously form heterogeneous structure with excellent hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) performance. The nickel foam supported Co3O4 nanoarrays embellished with NiCoSx (NiCoSx@Co3O4 NAs/NF) was easily obtained via sulfur ion modification, which has rich oxygen vacancies and active sites, leading to an outstanding HER performance (eta 10 = 59 mV, eta 400 = 264.0 mV). Furthermore, Fe(II) ion modified NiCoSx@Co3O4 NAs/NF (FeNiCoS@Co3O4 NAs/NF) achieved superior OER performance (eta 10 = 226 mV, eta 400 = 302 mV) than other recently reported cobalt-based catalysts due to the synergistic activity of Ni-Fe-S-Co. More importantly, this work offered a facile and energy-free strategy for developing transition metal oxides as splendid bifunctional catalysts and contributed to the cost and energy savings and mass production for industrial applications as well as the design of advanced functional materials for energy chemistry.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000683029200004

Yet, atomically efficient preparation of specific surfaces and the characterization of their properties are impeding its applications towards a clean energy future. Here, we present the synthesis of single layered IrOOH nanosheets and investigations of their structure as well as their electrochemical properties towards oxygen evolution under aqueous acidic conditions. The nanosheets are synthesized by treating bulk IrOOH with a tetrabutylammonium hydroxide solution and subsequent washing. Electron diffraction shows that the triangular arrangement of the edge sharing Ir(O,OH)(6) octahedra found in the layers of bulk IrOOH is retained after exfoliation into single layers. When incorporated as an active component in Ti electrodes, the nanosheets exhibit a Tafel slope of 58(3) mV dec(-1) and an overpotential of eta(-2)(10 mA cm) = 344(7) mV in 0.1 M HClO4, while retaining the trivalent oxidation state of iridium. They outperform bulk rutile-IrO2 and bulk IrOOH as electrocatalytic water oxidation catalysts under the same conditions. The results of this study on the structure-property relationships of low valence IrOOH nanosheets offer new pathways for the development of atom efficient, robust and highly active oxygen evolution catalysts.									46	2	0	0	1	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000449701900035

Benefiting from outstanding mass transfer capability of Ni-Fe-P-WO3/NF heterogeneous structure, abundance of active sites in the amorphous architecture and etc., the Ni-Fe-P-WO3/NF shows extremely superb electrocatalytic properties compare to noble metal catalyst IrO2/NF for OER, which needs an overpotential of only 218 mV in 1.0 M KOH solution to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2. It also has remarkable OER activity at high current density that only needs 298 mV to attain 100 mA cm-2 current density. Moreover, the Ni-Fe-P-WO3/NF has low Tafel slope of 42 mV dec-1.

However, it suffers from poor conductivity and inadequate active sites. Herein, we have developed a series of hierarchical Fe-mediated Ni-based metal-organic frameworks (FexNi1-x-MOF) by an adjustable hydrolysis strategy, where the Ni-MOF is used as a template that is decorated with NiOOH active sites. Although Ni-MOF is dissociated during the ion exchange process, the structural integrity is kept for FexNi1-x-MOF as confirmed by the electron micrographs. Moreover, the optimized Fe0.38Ni0.62-MOF catalyst not only exhibits a remarkable OER catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) but also shows a small Tafel slope of 58.3 mV dec(-1) and stability. The excellent OER electrocatalytic activity can be attributed to the unique 3D flower-like structure decorated with NiOOH active sites induced by Fe3+ species. This novel methodology expands a new way for the construction of highly efficient alkaline catalytic materials.									26	2	0	0	0	0	26			2574-0970			WOS:000507667200029

Therefore, developing efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts to enhance sluggish kinetics remains a challenge. As an admittedly promising candidate catalyst for the OER, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are limited by weak conductivity and poor activity sites. Herein, an interface engineering strategy was utilized to increase the intrinsic activity of CoV-LDHs by coupling with FeOOH via a novel and inexpensive protocol. The hybrid catalyst CoV-LDHs@FeOOH/NF showed a low overpotential of 232 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, with a low Tafel slope of 16.7 mV dec 1 in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution, which is superior to that obtained for the individual CoV-LDHs/NF and FeOOH/NF counterparts. The enhanced OER activity mainly benefits from the electronic exchange among Co2+, V3+, and Fe3+. In addition, the heterostructure shows excellent catalytic durability of approximately 100 h. This work provides a novel method to synthesize V-based LDH materials and an excellent electrocatalyst for improving OER activity.									5	1	0	0	1	0	6			2452-2139			WOS:000704349400002

Here we successfully tailored the surface charge of silver delafossite AgCoO2 (ACO) and turn it into an efficient OER catalysts via tuning surface charge transfer state. XAFS and NEXAFS results evidenced an increased occupied Co 3d projected state in hybrid and a synergistic electronic interaction between Ag and ACO. The ACO/Ag catalyst requires an overpotential of 271 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is much smaller than that of pure ACO, most Co-oxide-based OER electrocatalysts and RuO2 (369 mV) or IrO2 (338 mV) catalysts. Moreover, density functional theory calculations show that the reduction of unoccupied Co 3d projected state in the hybrid brings optimized delocalized charge density of ACO and decreased reaction free energy barriers involved on the Co site in OER, which are essential for the unusual performance.									29	4	0	0	4	0	30			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000458419000080

Carbon and polymeric binder, widely used for the construction of Li-O-2 cathode, have recently been shown to decompose in the O-2 environment and thus cannot sustain the desired battery reactions. Identifying stable cathode materials is thus a major current challenge that has motivated extensive search for noncarbonaceous alternatives. Here, RuOx/titanium nitride nanotube arrays ( RuOx/TiN NTA) containing neither carbon nor binder are used as the cathode for nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries. The free standing TiN NTA electrode is more stable than carbon electrode, and possesses enhanced electronic conductivity compared to TiN nanoparticle bound with polytetrafluoroethylene due to a direct contact between TiN and Ti mesh substrate. RuOx is electrodeposited into TiN NTA to form a coaxial nanostructure, which can further promote the oxygen evolution reaction. This optimized monolithic electrode can avoid the side reaction arising from carbon material, which exhibits low overpotential and excellent cycle stability over 300 cycles. These results presented here demonstrate a highly effective carbon-free cathode and further imply that the structure designing of cathode plays a critical role for improving the electrochemical performance of nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries.									64	8	0	0	3	0	68				2198-3844		WOS:000368997300007	27980967

The best performing electrode material showed high stability after 10 h, at constant potential of 1.7 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) in a 0.1 M KOH solution and high electrocatalytic activity in OER with low overpotential (0.38 V vs RHE at 10 mA cm(-2)). The excellent electrocatalytic performance of the electrode is rationalized by the overall 3D macroporous structure and with the firmly integrated CNTs directly grown on the foam, resulting in a large specific surface area, good electrical conductivity, as well as an efficient electrolyte transport into the whole electrode matrix concurrent with an ability to quickly dispose oxygen bubbles into the electrolyte. The eminent properties of the three-dimensional structured carbon matrix, which can be synthesized through a simple, scalable and cost effective pyrolysis process show that it has potential to be implemented in large-scale water electrolysis systems.									22	1	0	0	1	0	22			2045-2322			WOS:000406285700020	28733585

Here, solution combustion-synthesized La2-xSrxNiO4+delta (x = 0-0.8) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) oxides were explored for an electrocatalytic methanol oxidation reaction. Optimal doping of bivalent Sr2+ in the A site enabled the tetragonal distortion and oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ that resulted ultimately in enhanced covalent hybridization of Ni 3d-O 2p with a closer proximity of the O 2p band to the Fermi level. The RP oxide La1.4Sr0.6NiO4+delta exhibited the highest methanol oxidation reactivity vis-a-vis the formation of HCO2H. The proposed mechanism over La1.4Sr0.6NiO4+delta considers a lattice oxygen-mediated methanol oxidation reaction, owing to Fermi-level "pinning" at the top of the O 2p band, which facilitated lattice oxygen atoms prone to oxidation. A high surface concentration of the key active species of Ni-OOH was observed to form during the methanol oxidation reaction with the help of lattice oxygen atoms and oxygen vacancies in La1.4Sr0.6NiO4+delta. The present study offers a uniquely comprehensive exploration of structural and surface properties of RP oxides toward methanol oxidation reactions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000742111900001

Herein, we synthesize a mesoporous Ni3S2 particle electrocatalyst on Ni foam that has appropriate surface sulfur chemistry and demonstrates excellent catalytic activity as well as rapid reaction kinetics. The optimized Ni3S2 electrocatalyst shows ultralow overpotentials of 213 and 283 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a very low Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1) in alkaline media. The ECSA normalized current density is 1.1 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 270 mV, nearly three times higher than that of pristine Ni3S2 (0.4 mA cm(-2)). It has been observed that the sulfur-engineered Ni3S2 electrocatalyst can promote more Ni3+ generation with a significant shift of the Ni center binding energy compared with pristine Ni3S2 during the OER. The findings propose a facile tactic to improve the intrinsic OER activity for water splitting by optimizing the surface sulfur chemistry of metal sulfide-based electrocatalysts.									51	3	0	0	2	0	51			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463819400024

The 3D HPG material is induced into NiCo2O4 as conductive support to increase the specific area and improve the poor conductivity of NiCo2O4. The activity of and stability of NiCo2O4 significantly are enhanced by a small amount of Au for OER.

The introduction of nitrogen is beneficial to the Ti3C1.6N0.4 flakes for more exposed active sites, accelerated charge transfer upon an electrochemical reaction, and improved wettability for more accessible sites. As a result, the as-obtained Ti3C1.6N0.4 catalyst exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic properties for OER, which include a small eta(onset) of 245.8 mV, low Tafel slope of 216.4 mV dec(-1), and relatively good catalytic stability. The present work not only deepens the understanding of in situ N-doped MXene electrocatalysts, but also provides a guideline for the preparation of other N-doped MXene-based hybrid materials for other renewable energy applications.									29	2	0	0	0	0	29			2516-0230			WOS:000521420400022

Herein, we report the significant enhancement of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of electrodeposited Co(OH)(2) on the Fe foil due to the in situ generated interfacial layer on the underlying metal substrate during the OER process. Experimental observations demonstrate that the OER electrocatalytic activity of Co(OH)(2) on various metal substrates decreases in the order Fe > Ni > Co > Cu > Ag > Ti in the high current density region. Density functional theory calculations and experimental investigations demonstrate that the interfacial (oxy)hydroxide/oxide layer on the surface of the metal substrate can affect total OER kinetics. We believe that theoretical understanding and experimental findings of the substrate effect can provide further insights into the catalyst-substrate interface for self-supported electrocatalysts. Thus, this work provides a new guideline to design high-performance electrodes, which can be achieved through the match of electrocatalytic species and the substrate.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000703338600083

Herein, a unique class of molybdate nanobelts (NBs) with high surface area, fast electron transportation, and fast diffusion of electrolyte were constructed for enhanced OER via electronic engineering. We discovered that introducing a third metal modifies the electronic environment of molybdate NBs, leading to favorable intermediate adsorption on the catalysts. The optimized Mo51Ni40Fe9 NBs exhibit an overpotential of 257 mV to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1). By combination with commercial Pt/C as the cathodic catalyst, the water electrolyzer only requires a potential of 1.55 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits superior stability with small current density decay after 18 h. On the basis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and surface valence band spectra, the enhanced OER performance is tightly connected with the appropriate binding energy between reactive intermediates and active sites. This work proposes an open avenue of electronic engineering strategy for the design of efficient electrocatalysts.									46	4	0	0	3	0	48			2155-5435			WOS:000458707000025

The in situ electrical conductivity for metal doped gamma-NiOOH correlates well with the trend in enhanced OER activities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to rationalize the in situ conductivity of the key intermediate states of metal doped gamma-NiOOH during OER. The simultaneous increase of OER activity with intermediate conductivity was later rationalized by their intrinsic connections to the double exchange (DE) interaction between adjacent metal ions with various d orbital occupancies, serving as an indicator for the key metal-oxo radical character, and an effective descriptor for the mechanistic evaluation and theoretical guidance in design and screening of efficient OER catalysts.									18	1	0	0	2	0	18			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000664758000001	33973312

The CuNi@Ni(ON)/CNTs-Gr material with tunable electronic properties and conductivity displayed favorite adsorption energies towards reactants, thus manifesting its remarkable bifunctional activities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) operating in 1.0 M KOH. To achieve current responses of 10 and 100 mA cm-2, small overpotential values of 42.1 and 410 mV were needed for HER and OER, respectively. An electrolyzer employing CuNi@Ni(ON)/CNTs-Gr electrodes delivered an exciting cell voltage of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm-2 and good stability over 25 h operation, surpassing performance of a commercial Pt/C//RuO2-based system. These achievements suggested the CuNi@Ni(ON)/CNTs-Gr is one of the most effective nonprecious catalysts for high-performance production of green hydrogen gas via water splitting.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663084500003

The lead ion dissolution was 16.6% of the conventional PbO2 electrode, which reduces the secondary pollution caused by lead ion dissolution. Besides, the synthesized electrode exhibited an outstanding degradation performance on the endocrine disruptor methylparaben (MePB). It can completely degrade 20 mg/L MePB within 1 h, and the COD removal can reach 91.4%. The excellent performance of the synthesized electrode was mainly due to the control of the electrode's crystal facet during the preparation of the PbO2 electrode. The crystal phase and morphology of the electrode were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that the assistance of surfactants SDS and Triton X-100 promoted formation of the low-index facet beta(101) and limited formation of the high-index facet beta(211), that show higher overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Besides, PbO2 had better crystallization and the obvious pyramid structure.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000653063700001

Herein, the design and fabrication of nanometer-sized Fe-modulated CoOOH nanoparticles by a novel conversion tailoring strategy is reported for the first time and these nanoparticles are assembled on graphene matrix to construct 2D nanohybrids (Fe-CoOOH/G) with ultrasmall particles and finely modulated local electronic structure of Co cations. The Fe components are capable of tailoring and converting the micrometer-sized sheets into nanometer-sized particles, indicative of ultrasensitive Fe-triggered behavior. The as-made Fe-CoOOH/G features highly exposed edge active sites, well-defined porous structure, and finely modulated electron structure, together with effectively interconnected conducting networks endowed by graphene. Density functional theory calculations have revealed that the Fe dopants in the Fe. CoOOH nanoparticles have an enhanced adsorption capability toward the oxygenated intermediates involved in OER process, thus facilitating the whole catalytic reactions. Benefiting from these integrated characteristics, the as-made Fe-CoOOH/G nanohybrids as an oxygen evolution electrocatalyst can deliver a low overpotential of 330 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent electrochemical durability in alkaline medium.

It is essential to develop facile and scalable synthetic methods to elevate the activity and stability of OER electrocatalysts. We report a precursor complexation method to prepare a Ir-IrOx OER catalyst with crystalline Ir skeleton and amorphous IrOx surface. The appropriate valence states of amorphous IrOx surface and Ir skeleton were the probable origins of high activity and durability for OER by tuning the complexes and calcination temperature. An increasing calcination temperature and a complex with high decomposition rates led to more fractions of oxide surface as well as high valence state of Ir. The Ir-IrOx catalyst only required an overpotential of 228 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm-2, surpassing most reported Ir-based catalysts. A PEMWE equipped with the Ir-IrOx OER catalyst reached a current density of 1 A cm-2 at a low cell voltage of 1.67 V at 80 degrees C, and the applied voltage was almost unchanged in the 100 h' chronopotentiometry test, suggesting the potential practicability of the catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000866263400001

Here, we report the surface modification of Ni(OH)(2)/nickel foam (NF)-based electrocatalyst with a trace amount of ferrocene formic acid (FFA) (FFA-Ni(OH)(2)/NF) for highly efficient OER. Owing to the strong electron interaction and synergistic effects of Fe-Ni heteroatoms, FFA-Ni(OH)(2)/NF exhibits an overpotential of 311 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Impressively, the overpotential of FFA-Ni(OH)(2)/NF at 100 mA cm(-2) is 108 mV less than that of bulk phase doped Ni/FFA(OH)(2)/NF, demonstrating the surprising effect of heteroatomic surface modification. In addition, by introducing a small amount of surface modifier into the electrolyte, the weak surface reconstruction process in the electrochemical process can be fully utilized to achieve obvious modification effects. Therefore, this work fully proves the feasibility of improving catalytic activities of FeNi-based catalysts by modifying surface heterogeneous atom pairs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4352		WOS:000872665300001

Here, a sophisticated electrode that uses the advantages of porous/hollow nanostructure, hierarchical nanostructure, and self-supported structure simultaneously is demonstrated for the first time. A self supported porous hierarchical core shell structure (PHCS) of cobalt oxide is synthesized by the combination of electrochemical deposition and electrochemical treatment. The treatment introduces numerous pores into the core of a core shell structure, and it decreases the particle size of cobalt oxide to <5 nm, markedly increasing the surface area of the resultant structures. The electrochemical surface area of PHCS is 1.6 greater than that of hierarchical core shell cobalt oxide, and is similar to 20 times greater than that of cobalt oxide nanowires. The PHCS is extremely active in the OER, with the overpotential required for a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) being as small as 300 mV. The Tafel slope is 40.3 mV dec(-1), and the PHCS can work stably for more than 40 h.									37	0	0	0	1	0	37			2155-5435			WOS:000417230500022

Expressions for both atomic oxygen (O) and ozone (O-3) are obtained applying a perturbative method and reduced to a compact form through the use of Green's functions. The latter are of great aid for studying the generation of ozone for pulsed and continuous operation regimes depending explicitly on initial and boundary conditions. It is shown that the behavior of O and O-3 densities is strongly dependent on time. Results reported here confirm the fact that, close to the electrodes, further production of high-concentration ozone can be obtained taking into account the time evolution.									6	2	0	0	0	0	8			0093-3813			WOS:000076226900037

Herein, we propose a single transition-metal (TM)-based defective AlP system to validate bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis by using the density functional theory (DFT) method. We found that the catalytic activity is enhanced by substituting two P atoms with two N atoms in the Al vacancy of the TM-anchored AlP monolayer. Specifically, the overpotential of OER(ORR) in Co- and Ni-based defective AlP systems is found to be 0.38 (0.25 V) and 0.23 V (0.39 V), respectively, showing excellent bifunctional catalytic performance. The results are further presented by establishing the volcano plots and contour maps according to the scaling relation of the Gibbs free-energy change of *OH, *O, and *OOH intermediates. The d-band center and the product of the number of d-orbital electrons and electronegativity of the TM atom are the ideal descriptors for this system. To investigate the activity origin of the OER/ORR process, we performed the machine learning (ML) algorithm. The result indicates that the number of TM-d electrons (N-e), the radius of TM atoms (r(d)), and the charge transfer of TM atoms (Q(e)) are the three primary descriptors characterizing the adsorption behavior. Our results can provide a theoretical guidance for designing highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts and pave a way for the DFT-ML hybrid method in catalysis research.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000736833200001	34941239

Don								Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation by Single Site and Small Nuclearity Clusters of Cobalt								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				165	4			H3028	H3033		10.1149/2.0041804jes				2018	2018	Cobalt oxides are an earth abundant material that exhibits high electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) across a wide pH range. Recent studies suggest that OER catalysis can proceed through an active site comprised of one or two cobalt atoms but that multiple adjacent cobalt centers are preferred to stabilize high valent cobalt oxo-intermediates by delocalization. Utilizing molecular precursors to prepare single, isolated cobalt atoms (SS-Co) and small clusters of Co3O4 we find that OER proceeds more efficiently on Co3O4. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), these results were rationalized at an atomic level. The EIS results support a hypothesis that charge transfer related to the formation of reaction intermediates proceeds more easily on Co3O4 than on SS-Co, which is attributed to the difficulty in forming Co(IV) = O and unlikely nucleophilic attack by water to form Co(II)-OOH.

For the first time, this work introduces electrochemical exfoliation as a surface modification method of graphite felt (GF) to enhance the mass transfer and reaction kinetics in RFBs. Anion intercalation and subsequent gas evolutions at room temperature for one minute expand the graphite layers that increase the electrode surface area. Meanwhile, sufficient oxygen functional groups are introduced to the electrode, resulting in enhanced reaction kinetics and improved hydrophilicity. Further, spin-polarized density functional theory is employed to reveal the role of oxygen functional groups in accelerating the vanadium redox reaction. Benefitting from sufficient oxygen groups, larger surface area, and superior wettability, the as-prepared exfoliated GF (E-GF) shows exceptional electrocatalytic activity with minimized overpotential, higher volumetric capacity, and improved energy efficiency. The redox flow battery assembled with the E-GF electrode delivers voltage and energy efficiencies of 89.72% and 86.41% at the current density of 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Remarkably, compared to the traditional GF treatment method, the elimination of the high temperature and long-time treatment processes make this approach much more energy and time efficient, scalable, and affordable for large-scale manufacturing.									38	1	0	0	1	0	38			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000481102100001

However, they are rarely used as an electrocatalyst in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to the poor HER activity. Herein, we present a facile two-step method to synthesize P doped CoMoO4/RGO (P-CoMoO4/RGO) with different atomic ratios of Co2+/Co3+ through a simple phosphorization strategy by changing the mass of NaH2PO2. The effective P-doping into CoMoO4/RGO can modify the electronic properties and modulate the atomic ratio of Co2+/Co3+, which promotes the electron transfer and creates more activity sites. Therefore, the optimized P-CoMoO4/RGO with a relatively larger atomic ratio of Co2+/Co3+ shows superior HER performances in alkaline media, which affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 90 mV and a low Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1 )along with having satisfactory long-term stability.

Herein, we develop a facile hydrothermal process to prepare nanoflowers by compounding Co-Mo-S and oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (denoted as Co1.5Mo1.0S/o-MWNTs) as efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. Oxidized MWNTs could enhance the hydrophilicity and electrical conductivity of the catalyst conductivity. Co and Mo charge transfer can be accelerated after the chemical hybridization of Co, Mo and highly conductive o-MWNTs. Co is easily oxidized into cobalt oxyhydroxide, which acts as the active site for OER. The electrocatalyst exhibits highly efficient electrocatalytic performances, achieving low overpotential of 311 mV for the OER at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and low Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1) in alkaline media. The catalyst maintains good stability even after 10 hours of chronoamperometry test at 1.60 V in alkaline solution. This work provides a new direction for boosting the electrocatalytic activity through coupling bimetallic sulfides and constructing with conductive substrate.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000654074200001

The direct manufacture of MOF nanosheets is still a challenge up to now. Here, we have developed a novel bottom-up approach to synthesize zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) nanosheets, which can be in situ converted into Co3O4 ultrathin nanomeshes after thermal treatment. Interestingly, the obtained Co3O4 nanomeshes are rich in oxygen defects, providing fruitful active sites for the faradaic reaction. The modified electrode exhibits a large specific capacitance (1216.4 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)), as well as a high rate capability (925.5 F g(-1) at 20 A g(-1)). Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor made of Co3O4//activated carbon shows an energy density of 46.5 Wh kg(-1) at 790.7 W kg(-1). Furthermore, the 2D Co3O4 ultrathin nanomeshes show an outstanding performance for the oxygen evolution reaction with an overpotential of 230 mV at the onset potential and a small Tafel slope of 74.0 mV dec(-1). The present method presents a facile avenue to the preparation of other 2D ultrathin metal oxide nanostructures with various applications in energy catalysis and conversion.									141	7	0	0	11	0	143			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000439528400033	29947226

However, sluggish kinematics of HER in alkaline media and its inability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hamper its development as bifunctional catalysts. The instability of 1T-MoS2 further impedes its applications for scaling up, calling an urgent need for simple synthesis to produce stable 1T-MoS2. In this work, the challenge of 1T-MoS2 synthesis is first addressed using a direct one-step hydrothermal method by adopting ascorbic acid. 1T-MoS2 with flower-like morphology is obtained, and transition metals (Ni, Co, Fe) are simultaneously doped into 1T-MoS2. Ni-1T-MoS2 achieves an enhanced bifunctional catalytic activity for both HER and OER in alkaline media, where the key role of Ni doping as single atom is proved to be essential for boosting HER/OER activity. Finally, a Ni-1T-MoS2||Ni-1T-MoS2 electrolyzer is fabricated, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an applied cell voltage of only 1.54 V for overall water splitting.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000768812800001	35289481	
J	Kress, Monika E.; Tielens, Alexander G. G. M.; Frenklach, Michael								The 'soot line': Destruction of presolar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the terrestrial planet-forming region of disks								ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH				46	1			44	49		10.1016/j.asr.2010.02.004				JUL 1 2010	2010	Interstellar material is highly processed when subjected to the physical conditions that prevail in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks, the potential birthplace of habitable planets. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are abundant in the interstellar medium, and they have also been observed in the disks around young stars, with evidence for some modification in the latter. Using a chemical model developed for sooting flames, we have investigated the chemical evolution of PAHs in warm (1000-2000 K) and oxygen-rich (C/O < 1) conditions appropriate for the region where habitable planets may eventually form. Our study focuses on (1) delineating the conditions under which PAHs will react and (2) identifying the key reaction pathways and reaction products characterizing this chemical evolution. We find that reactions with H, OH and O are the main pathways for destroying PAHs over disk timescale at temperatures greater than about 1000 K. In the process, high abundances of C2H2 persist over long timescales due to the kinetic inhibition of reactions that eventually drive the carbon into CO, CO2 and CH4. The thermal destruction of PAHs may thus be the cause of the abundant C2H2 that has been observed in disks. We propose that protoplanetary disks have a 'soot line', within which PAHs are irreversibly destroyed via thermally-driven reactions. The soot line will play an important role, analogous to that of the 'snow line', in the bulk carbon content of meteorites and habitable planets. (C) 2010 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Water electrolysis which produces hydrogen has high energy efficiency and stability but still has a large overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, Co3O4 catalysts with different morphology were prepared by spray pyrolysis from solutions which contain Co precursor and various organic additives (urea, sucrose, and citric acid), followed by post heat treatment. For the catalysts synthesized, Xray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed to identify their crystal structure. Morphology and surface shape of the catalysts were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Surface area and pore volume were examined by nitrogen adsortpion & desorption tests and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to confirm nitrogen doping. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carried out to investigate OER activity of Co3O4 catalysts. As a result, bare-Co3O4 which has high surface area and small particle size determined by spray pyrolysis showed high activity toward OER.				최근 화석연료를 대체할 친환경 신재생에너지에 대한 요구가 증가하면서 수소에너지가 미래 대체에너지원으로서 주목받고 있다. 수소를 생산하는 방법 중 수전해 기술은 에너지효율과 안정성이 뛰어난 장점이 있지만, 산소발생반응시발생하는 높은 과전압은 여전히 단점으로 지적되고 있다. 본 연구에서는 분무열분해 공정을 통하여 Co 전구체로부터Co3O4를 제조하였다. 또한, urea, sucrose, citric acid의 유기물첨가제를 사용하여 다양한 입자 크기와 표면형상을 가지는Co3O4를 제조하였고, 필요에 따라 추가로 열처리를 실시하였다. 합성한 Co3O4의 물리적 특성을 분석하기 위해 X-선회절 분석(XRD)으로 결정성을 조사하였고, 주사전자현미경(SEM)과 투과전자현미경(TEM)으로 입자형상 및 표면을분석하였다. 질소 흡Â·탈착 시험을 통해 촉매의 비표면적 및 기공부피를 측정하였고, 질소도핑을 확인하기 위해 X-선광전자 분광법(XPS)을 사용하였다. 촉매의 산소발생반응 활성을 알아보기 위해 3전극 셀에서 선형주사전위법(LSV)으로전기화학적 거동을 분석하였다. 첨가제를 사용하지 않은 Co3O4가 가장 우수한 활성을 보였고, 이는 분무열분해법을 통하여 상대적으로 작은 입자형성과 높은 비표면적의 영향인 것으로 판단된다.					1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0304-128X			KJD:ART002169994

In this paper, lignite collected from Ximeng mine was treated with hydrochloric acid and nitric acid. The oxidation performance and microstructure parameters of treated coal were analyzed by gas chromatograph, mercury intrusion, FTIR and XPS. According to test results, low-temperature (T < 200 degrees C) oxidation process of coal involves the slow oxidation and rapid oxidation stages owing to different apparent activation energy. HCl and HNO3 treatment improved the pore volume and porosity, and enhanced the oxygen adsorption capacity, thus both accelerating oxidation reaction of coal during slow oxidation stage with temperature below 100 degrees C. However, in the rapid oxidation stage above 100 degrees C, HCl treatment inhibited oxygen reaction because the number of oxygen-containing groups including ether and carbonyl band reduced and the hydrogen bonding force for strengthening the stability of coal molecular enhanced. Whereas HNO3 treatment exerted promoting effect on coal oxidation for its pre-oxidation effect and the decrease of coal molecular stability. Further, the conversion mechanism of main active functional groups in acid-treated coal was proposed.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000621191500004

Ni-based electrocatalysts have been actively pursued because of their promising activity and earth abundance. However, the OER efficiency for most of the developed Ni-based electrocatalysts has been intrinsically limited due to their low electrical conductivity and poor active site exposure yield. Herein, we report metallic Ni3N nanosheets as an efficient OER electrocatalyst for the first time. The first-principles calculations and electrical transport property measurements unravel that the Ni3N is intrinsically metallic, and the carrier concentration can be remarkably improved with dimensional confinement. The EXAFS spectra provide solid evidence that the Ni3N nanosheets have disordered structure resultant of dimensional reduction, which then could provide more active sites for OER. Benefiting from enhanced electrical conductivity with metallic behavior and atomically disordered structure, the Ni3N nanosheets realize intrinsically improved OER activity compared with bulk Ni3N and NiO nanosheets. Our finding suggests that metallic nitride nanosheets could serve as a new group of OER electrocatalysts with excellent property.									843	42	0	0	38	0	852			0002-7863			WOS:000352244800025	25761452

Herein, we synthesized CoP2/Fe-CoP2 yolk-shell nanoboxes (YSBs) as efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Initially, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67/CoFe-Prussian blue analogue (ZIF-67/CoFe-PBA) YSBs were prepared by the reaction of ZIF-67 and [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) ions in the presence of a small amount of water as an etching agent.

The combination results in synergy in producing nanomaterials with high surface area (>100 m(2) g(-1)), good conductivity, and rich intra-grain defect features, giving the oxides unique surface activities suitable for particular electrochemical applications. The phase compositions of the resulting powders are primarily determined by two process parameters, including the carbothermic carbon (C) content, expressed as the C-to-Ti molar ratio of the reactant powder, and the cooling protocol. Carbothermic C contents exceeding a threshold of C/Ti similar to 3.7 exclusively produced non-Magneli phase (MP) oxides including TiO and Ti2O3, while the MP oxides, Ti3O5 and Ti4O7, can be formed only with lower C contents combined with selected quenching protocols that kinetically limit oxygen replenishment during cooling. Examples of the resulting MP Ti4O7 powder exhibiting outstanding pseudocapacitive and oxygen evolution reaction catalytic behaviors are demonstrated.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			2168-0485			WOS:000427092900040

The special carbon encapsulation structure of nanohybrids promotes the synergistic effect of Co3Fe7 and Co5.47N, which could protect the nanoparticles from the harsh environments. Moreover, the ultrahigh specific surface areas and the hierarchical pore structure are beneficial for the exposure of catalytically active sites. Hence, FP-950 exhibits a robust trifunctional electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. For example, it exhibits an acceptable HER performance with an overpotential (E-over) of 299 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope value of 144 mV dec(-1). Meanwhile, FP-950 also displays impressive activity towards the OER with a low operating overpotential of 346 mV and a small Tafel slope value of 89 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, FP-950 also presents acceptable ORR performance in alkaline environments which makes it an excellent catalyst for rechargeable Zn-air batteries with a high specific capacity of 792 mA h g(Zn)(-1) and a super long life-time of 83 h (10 mA cm(-2)). By using FP-950 as the sole catalyst for full water splitting, an alkaline electrolyzer affords a cell voltage as low as 1.63 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Finally, this also revealed that FP-950 could be used for overall water splitting in a self-powered manner under ambient conditions with a high H-2 evolution rate of 569.5 mu mol h(-1). This work paves the way for the rational fabrication of a low-cost trifunctional electrocatalyst which could be further applied in sustainable energy technologies.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2398-4902			WOS:000714389700001

Here, we report a strategy doping with a small amount of phosphorus to make inactive and low-cost spinel CuCo2O4 (CCO) turn into high-efficiency and superior to the noble metal catalyst RuO2. The spinel CuCo2O4-P-0.5 (CCP0.5) shows the best OER performance with a small overpotential of 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 68 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline electrolyte. The phosphorus doping induces the production of an amorphous phase that provides a large number of active sites, and the synergistic effect of the crystalline phase and amorphous phase significantly improves the OER activity of CCO. It is also revealed that the conductivity of CCO is improved compared with pristine CCO. Our work highlights that non-metallic element doping is an effective strategy to greatly enhance the OER performance of spinel transition metal oxide electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2196-0216			WOS:000592481700001

Here, as a proof-of-concept experiment, a rapid one-step and very effective synthesis strategy is reported for the first time to produce a family of ionic liquid-modified AMH nanoparticles as highly efficient OER electrocatalysts. The ionic liquid-modified bimetallic FeNi hydroxide nanoparticles exhibit remarkable OER activity with a Tafel slope of 54.4 mV dec(-1)and an overpotential of 300 mV for 10 mA cm(-2)(loading: similar to 0.009 mg(FeNi)cm(-2)). Further, the universal applicability of this strategy for designing the AMH nanoparticles extends to other metallic hydroxide nanoparticles (Fe, Co, Ni, FeCo and NiCo). This work may provide a novel synthetic protocol to design amorphous metal hydroxide nanoparticle catalysts for the efficient OER.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000560225400031

In a first phase, oxygen coming from the surface layers of the ceria-zirconia mixed oxide is consumed and no structural variation of the support is observed. After this induction time, bulk reduction of Pt/ceria-zirconia takes place as a step-like process, while the CO2 production continues at a nearly constant rate. This behavior is totally different from that of the metal-free support in similar reaction conditions, that show a gradual bulk reduction. In repeated oxidation-reduction cycles, it was observed that the induction time in Pt/ceria-zirconia is a function of the thermal history, of the amount of supported Pt and of the structural evolution of the samples.

Herein, a modular strategy is used to decorate isolated cobalt sites into a multichannel carbon matrix (Co@MCM) with Co content of about 1.4 wt% for efficient electrochemical reduction of oxygen. As confirmed by X-ray absorption fine structure investigation, the pre-designed CoN4 configuration and geometric structure are well maintained in the newly developed Co@MCM. The decorated CoN4 units together with the multichannel carbon substrate with high conductivity and porosity endow the catalyst with excellent activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Our findings not only present some fundamental insights for the accurate modulation of nanostructured catalysts at the atomic scale, but also reveal the structural origin of the enhanced catalytic activity.									178	15	0	0	9	0	180			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000442262900004

We report a systematic computational investigation of the effects of Ov's on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential for beta-Ga2O3, a d(10) semiconductor that has been shown to exhibit high activity for water splitting. We investigated 18 beta-Ga2O3 surfaces/slabs, with and without Ov's and observed a clear dependence of OER activity on Ov's. A general finding emerged that the excess electrons associated with Ov's are found to participate in charge transfer to OER intermediates, making their bonds to the surface more ionic and stronger, depending on the amount of charge transfer. The OER reaction step free energies are significantly affected and the ensuing overpotentials are altered. The amount of charge transfer varies with the types of intermediates (OH*, dangling O*, surface-bound peroxo O*, and dangling OOH*), their open valencies, and their electronegativity. The work function and the position of the gap states of the excess electrons in the band gap are found to be useful descriptors of whether and how much Ov-induced charge transfer may occur and affect the overpotential. However, it was also found that the chemical environment of the O atom where the vacancy was created, may have a negating effect on the general observation. Specifically some Ov structures underwent a strong relaxation to form Ga-Ga bonds, trapping the vacancy electrons, and preventing them to engage in charge transfer. Oxygen vacancies are common defects in photocatalyst materials so that our investigation can provide guiding principles for designing efficient photocatalysts.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000450696100038

Measurements of the voltammetric charge, q*, and of iR-corrected polarisation curves up to current densities of 40 kA/m(2) Were recorded on new anodes and on aged anodes from 3 years of production in a chlorate plant. Anodic polarisation curves in chloride containing electrolytes bend towards a higher slope at approximately 1.2 V versus Ag/AgCl, likely due to oxidation of ruthenium. The potential and current density at which the curves bend have been defined as the critical potential, E-cr, and the critical current density, i(cr). New anodes that operate at a relatively high potential, > E-cr, obtain an increase in real surface area and thereby a decrease in anode potential and in the selectivity for oxygen formation during the first months of operation. Experiments at constant ionic strength under chlorate process conditions showed that E-cr decreased with increasing chloride concentration with a factor of -0.09 V/log Cl-, whereas i(cr) increased with increasing chloride concentration. The chlorine evolution reaction was of the first order with respect to chloride concentration. A possible reaction mechanism for chlorine formation is suggested. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

So far, only polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers under acidic conditions can cope with the intermittent supply of energy, requiring, however, noble metals at the cathode for the hydrogen (HER) and precious metal oxides at the anode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Prototypical oxides for the OER under acidic conditions are RuO2 and IrO2 that can meet the stringent requirements for long-term stability and high electrocatalytic activity. While RuO2 is substantially more active than IrO2, RuO2 is significantly less stable than IrO2 due to corrosion under OER conditions. Our microscopic understanding of the underlying processes of corrosion is, however, surprisingly poor, while the rate-determining steps in the OER over RuO2 and IrO2 are still under debate. In this perspective, I will be focusing on the discussion of the electrochemical degradation of ultrathin single-crystalline RuO2(110) and IrO2(110) films in the potential regions of both OER and HER. The single crystallinity of the model electrodes allows for identifying structure-property relationships and for a tight connection to theory. Since stability and activity in the OER are reported to be intimately coupled, I will also include a critical review of our present knowledge on the microscopic steps in the OER on RuO2 and IrO2, both from theory and experiments. Ultimately, from these atomic scale insights, the inherent material properties may be uncovered which underlie the observed electrochemical stability and activity of IrO2 and RuO2. It is the hope that these fundamental insights will aid the search for alternative more abundant electrode material systems for acidic water electrolyzers.									40	1	0	0	3	0	40			2155-5435			WOS:000674927200043

In this work, ultralow level of Fe(III) ion triggered Ni3S2 nanosheet grownon nickel foam (NF) for the enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards OER was reported for the first time. The OER electrocatalytic activity of the Fe(III)-Ni3S2/NF electrode was improved remarkably by adding only 2.1 (at.)% Fe(III) ion into the developed electrode and it merely requires an overpotential of eta=213 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), significantly lower than both the Ni3S2/NF electrode (eta=324 mV) and the benchmark RuO2/NF electrode (eta=240 mV). As far as we know, this is the lowest overpotential to achieve the same value based on the reported Ni-based sulfides. Meanwhile, the kinetic studies show that the Fe-2.1%-Ni3S2/NF electrode possessed a much smaller Tafel slope (33.2 mV dec(-1)) than that of Ni3S2/NF electrode (72.1 mV dec(-1)), demonstrating a fast reaction pathway. Further investigations attribute the enhanced OER activity to: (i) the addition of appropriate Fe(III) ions are favorable for the formation of interconnected Ni3S2 ultrathin nanosheets, rather than keeping the original wrinkled fusiform nanorods, thus leading to a 2-fold significantly enlarged electrochemical active surface areas,(ii) the improved surface wettability can result in an enhanced compatibility and affinity of the catalyst with the electrode, which is good for gas bubble evolution and (iii) the enhanced intrinsic electrocatalytic activity due to the electronic structure regulating effect of Fe(III) lead to a fast shuttling of charge transfers during OER between the electrode and the solution.									24	5	0	0	0	0	24			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000466791200022

Herein, a fluorine-doped nickel cobaltate spinel (NiCo2O4) is derived from the bimetallic nickel/cobalt metal-organic framework (CoNi-MOF) by a facile solvothermal approach and followed by an annealing process. It displays that the proposed NiCo2O4 nanostructure is combined with electro-catalytic active NiO and CoF2 nanoparticles. All of these nanoparticles are embedded homogeneously within the mesoporous carbon matrix to form abundant catalytic sites, leading to a strong synergetic effect with ionic/semi-ionic F and N atoms (denoted as NiCo2O4/NiO/CoF2@mC). It shows that the NiCo2O4/NiO/CoF2@mC hybrid obtained under 700 degrees C (denoted as NiCo2O4/NiO/CoF2@mC(700)) can be employed as efficiently bifunctional catalysts for hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in alkaline solution. The NiCo2O4/NiO/CoF2@mC(700) hybrid presents the faster and more efficient charge transfer, thus displaying an excellent electrocatalytic activity with low overpotentials of -45.3 mV and 1.47 V to reach a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) and Tafel slopes of 29 and 78 mV dec(-1) for the HER and OER, respectively. A two-electrode electrolyzer based on the NiCo2O4/NiO/CoF2@mC(700) catalyst as both the anode and cathode exhibits outstanding stability for sustained water splitting with a cell voltage of only 1.56 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This study not only opens a new avenue for designing efficient and flexible catalysts but also extends the application of metal organic frameworks in renewable energy resources.

Herein, a hybrid nanoarray structure of V-CoP@a-CeO2, where "a" represents amorphous, integrated into carbon cloth is fabricated for water splitting. The synergy effect between V and CeO2 can increase the electron density of Co atoms at active sites, further optimizing the Gibbs free energy of H* adsorption energy (Delta G(H*)). Besides, V-CoP@a-CeO2 possesses lower water adsorption/dissociation energies, enabling accelerated reaction kinetics in alkaline media. As expected, the V-CoP@a-CeO2 exhibits superior performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction. More importantly, a two-electrode electrolyzer combined with an electrocatalyst of V-CoP@ a-CeO2 only demands that voltages of electrolytic cell are 1.56 and 1.71 V to achieve the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively.

All experiments were carried out in homemade electrochemical cells using 0.1 M KOH as the electrolyte. The OER activities vary depending on the annealing conditions of the catalyst precursors, also reflected by different behaviours during the in situ spectroscopic experiments. The different activity of the Co/Ni oxides is most likely related to the formation of either gamma- or beta-NiO(OH), characterized by distinct features in the Raman spectra. Thus, a higher percentage of beta-NiO(OH) is present in the more active catalyst. A different behaviour of Co/Cu catalysts has been shown by in situ Raman spectroscopy too, but the active phase could not be identified because of missing spectral features. However, in situ EPR spectroscopy revealed the partial dissolution of Cu(II), suggesting the formation of a Co-enriched oxide/hydroxide surface.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000410498700044

Operando hard/tender/soft X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) techniques were used to investigate the function of the K/MnOx catalyst under working conditions. The Mn valency depended on the potential and the amount of K+ cation adsorption. Mn K-edge (hard X-ray) XAFS measurements for the K/MnOx catalyst suggested that the Mn in the catalyst was an Mn3+ species with an octahedral delta-MnO2 structure at a lower electrode potential, which changed reversibly to an Mn4+ species with a delta-MnO2 structure at higher potential during oxygen evolution. A similar result was obtained from operando O K-edge (soft X-ray) XAFS. The chemical state of K species was analyzed using operando K K-edge (tender X-ray) XAFS, which indicated that K+ cations were intercalated with hydrated states in the delta-MnO2 layers. These operando XAFS results demonstrated that the layered delta-MnO2 containing hydrated K+ cations functioned as efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalysts because of the presence of Mn3+ reaction sites.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000587720300015

IrO2 is a potential catalyst with sufficient activity and stability in acidic conditions to be applied in water electrolyzers. The redox properties and structural flexibility of amorphous iridium oxohydroxide compared to crystalline rutile-IrO2 are associated with higher catalytic activity for the OER We prepared IrOx OER catalysts by a simple hydrothermal method varying the alkali metal base (Li2CO3, LiOH, Na2CO3, NaOH, K2CO3, KOH) employed during the synthesis. This work reveals that the surface area, particle morphology, and the concentration of surface hydroxyl groups can be controlled by the base used and greatly influence the catalyst activity and stability for OER. It was found that materials prepared with bases containing lithium cations can lead to amorphous IrOx materials with a significantly lower overpotential (100 mV @a 1.5 mA.cm(-2) ) and increased stability compared to materials prepared with other bases and rutile IrO2. This facile method leads to the synthesis of highly active and stable catalysts which can potentially be applied to larger scale catalyst preparations.									16	1	0	0	3	0	16			2574-0962			WOS:000510104700088

Here, the bifunctional Co/Mo2C electrocatalysts encapsulated in 3D hierarchical nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers synchronously rooted with abundant carbon nanotubes (Co/Mo2C-NCNTs) were successfully fabricated by a facile electrospinning method. Due to the unique heterostructures and strong synergetic effects between Co and Mo2C nanoparticles to improve OH- affinity, moderate Mo-H bonds, and expose more active sites, the Co/Mo2C-NCNTs displayed a tiny overpotential for OER (eta(10)=310 mV) and HER (eta(10)=170 mV) and stably operated for 24 h. Moreover, the results of a water electrolysis device demonstrated that the faradaic efficiency was close to 100 %, which further proved that this method was feasible and effective to fabricate high-efficiency bifunctional non-noble electrocatalysts for water splitting.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000537252900001

However, theoretical techniques are still very time demanding because they require the consideration of many adsorption configurations of the reaction intermediates on the surface. Herein, we propose to use the metal-oxygen (M-O) bond ionicity as a descriptor for the photocatalytic activity of one of the best catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Ionicity is a bulk property and thus carries the advantage of being easily obtainable from a simple Bader charge analysis by using density functional theory (DFT). We will show that this criterion can be used successfully to design efficient dopants for NiOOH material. This catalyst is known to exhibit interesting photoelectrochemical properties for OER if it is doped with specific transition metals. Finally, we demonstrate that other electronic properties that relate to bulk calculation, such as oxidation states and density of states, are not alone sufficient to explain the photocatalytic activity of the material. Thus, M-O bond ionicity attracts significant interest compared with other bulk observables obtained by using DFT computations.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000381177700013	26945687

Here, we report transition-metal atoms coordinated in a graphene shell as active centers for aqueous CO2 reduction to CO with high faradic efficiencies over 90% under significant currents up to similar to 60 mA/mg. We employed three-dimensional atom probe tomography to directly identify the single Ni atomic sites in graphene vacancies. Theoretical simulations suggest that compared with metallic Ni, the Ni atomic sites present different electronic structures that facilitate CO2-to-CO conversion and suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction dramatically. Coupled with Li+-tuned Co3O4 oxygen evolution catalyst and powered by a triple-junction solar cell, our artificial photosynthesis system achieves a peak solar-to-CO efficiency of 12.7% by using earth-abundant transition-metal electrocatalysts in a pH-equal system.									262	19	0	0	14	0	265			2451-9294			WOS:000418335800008

The growth of GMTs follows a tip-growth mechanism with tube diameters up to a few micrometer. The hollow interiors of the GMTs are filled with carbon nanotubes and wrinkled graphene layers, which form a unique nanotube/graphene-in-microtube structure. As-formed GMTs are N,S-codoped with lots of Co9S8 nanoparticles encapsulated in their inner walls. These GMTs are room-temperature ferromagnets and can be loaded on Ni foams to work as binder-free electrocatalysts with low overpotential (310 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 284 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)) and long-term durability (continuous work for 120 h without loss in performance). Our research proves that metal sulfides can catalyze the growth of graphite microtubes and as-formed GMTs may potentially be used as functional building blocks to construct new kinds of electrochemical devices for various energy-related applications.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000455584900017	30303629

The number of sub-ground electrodes is less than that of traditional vertical grounding electrodes. Thus, the former has a favorable development prospect. However, given that the active part of a DWGE is buried in the deep earth, DWGE faces more complex gas exhaust problem than shallow-buried grounding electrodes. To research the gas evolution characteristics of DWGE, a U-shaped gas evolution experimental platform that can collect anode and cathode gases separately is designed. Carbon steel material is used as the electrode, and experiments have been conducted on water and saturated coke on the basis of the designed platform and a 30-m DWGE test. The results show that the operating environment and mode (anodic/cathodic) affect gas evolution. When inside water, only the reaction of Fe dissolution occurs at the anode, and Fe is transformed into Fe2+ while hydrogen evolution and oxygen consumption reactions occur simultaneously at the cathode. When in saturated coke, the gas production at the cathode increases with ampere-hours, thereby changing the contact resistance between the electrode and the coke and forming a "bubble resistance", then leading to a gas block. The test result of a 30 m well at 100 A further verifies the experimental results of the designed platform and confirms that a vent pipe plays a role in practical use.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2169-3536			WOS:000470253100001

Moreover, the alkaline electrolyzer with CF@CT-Ni4Mo NS electrodes as bifunctional catalysts can afford 20 mA cm(-2) toward overall water splitting at a cell voltage of 1.52 V. More importantly, a commercial solar cell can be used to drive the alkaline electrolyzer in general outdoor environment. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we report a Fe-O-P film on nickel foam (Fe-O-P/NF) via atomic layer deposition (ALD) of iron oxide and a subsequent phosphonation process, which acts as a superior bifunctional electrocatalyst for both urea evolution reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Benefiting from the synergetic effects, the Fe-O-P/NF exhibits a low potential of 1.34 V (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 57.2 mV dec(-1) for UOR. Combined with the high HER activity of Fe-O-P/NF, the urea-based overall water splitting can be performed with an low voltage of 1.43 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea, which is 200 mV lower than that for pure water splitting.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000424719500011

The results indicated that pure NiSe2, NiSe, and Ni3Se2 were obtained when the deposition potentials were -0.35, -0.46, and -0.60 V, respectively. The as-obtained products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that nickel selenide nanostructures exhibited clear phase-dependent electrocatalytic activities for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). NiSe2 presented the best HER and OER performances. The NiSe2/NF electrode required overpotentials of only 104 mV and 279 mV to obtain the current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and 20 mA cm(-2) for OER, respectively.

However, the relationship between anion species and their electrocatalytic performances of such materials in alkaline media has not been clearly known. Herein, a simple strategy is used to grow NiFe-based hydroxides/oxides/phosphides (NiFe-X, X = OH, O, P) nanosheet arrays directly on nickel foam (NF) as electrode materials for overall water splitting. We found that the electrocatalytic activity is strongly dependent on the composition of the prepared 3D composites. The electrochemical results reveal that the NiFeP-NF shows the highest electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with ultra-low overpotentials of 194 and 220 mV to reach the current densities of 20 and 50 mA cm(-2), while the NiFeO-NF has the highest catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with an overpotential of 162 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, both materials exhibit high long-term durability. Based on the excellent catalytic properties for OER and HER, the two catalysts are then assembled as cathode and anode, respectively, and only 1.58 V is needed to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting. This work presents a strategy to fabricate excellent OER and HER catalysts for electrochemical water splitting and demonstrates the effects of various anion species on the catalytic activities of transition metal-based nanosheet materials.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2053-1583			WOS:000539297000001

In this work, the influence of electron-deficient organic ligands on the electronic structures of catalytic sites and the OER performance of CoFe LDH are systematically elucidated. The experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the organic ligand triggers the p-d orbital hybridization at the interface of CoFe LDH/MIM, resulting in a downshift of the d-band center of CoFe LDH and the optimization of the binding strength of intermediates during the OER, which gives deep insights into understanding the excellent OER activity of metal-organic framework-derived LDHs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000849192100001

Firstly, a NiCo-SiO2 composite film was prepared via a potentiostatic electro-codeposition method. Then the SiO2 template was etched and the NiCo component was activated leading to the generation of a (N)iCoOx layer during consecutive CV scans in concentrated alkaline solution. The results show that this nanostructured NiCo alloy with the oxide layer can provide a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH at a low overpotential of 326 mV and exhibits good stability towards water oxidation.

However, their low activity is the main hindrance for their use in the practical OER application. In this study, a Ni-based core-shell material (Ni@Ni-NC) is produced through the heat treatment of a mixture of urea and NiCl2 center dot(H2O)(6). Multiple analysis data reveal that the Ni@Ni-NC consists of a Ni nanoparticle core and several tens of nanometer-thick, N-doped carbon (NC) shell materials, in which atomically attached Ni-based species were homogeneously distributed. Ni@Ni-NC exhibits excellent electrocatalytic OER performance with over- and onset potentials of 371 mV and 1.51 V, respectively, which are better than those of commercial IrO2. As control samples, structural and electrochemical properties of various composites (Ni nanoparticles + N-doped graphene, Ni nanoparticles + C3N4, atomically dispersed Ni on a C3N4 surface) and acid-treated Ni@Ni-NC are investigated. These experiments reveal that the well-dispersed Ni-NC species and core-shell structures play pivotal roles in improving the electrocatalytic OER performance. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest the dual-site OER mechanism of the Ni-NC active species with a significantly low reaction barrier. The mechanisms for the formation of core-shell structures are studied with control samples, which are produced from different heating times, and DFT calculation suggested that the core/shell structure formation is attributed to the cohesive energy of the Ni particles and strong bonds between the Ni and NC supports. This work provides a facile strategy for designing supported Ni catalysts with core-shell architecture for electrocatalytic reactions and other advanced applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2574-0970		WOS:000702079900078

Hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions are performed in the gas phase in cathode and anode compartments separated by a membrane. Anion exchange membranes show great promise for this type of solar hydrogen generator. They provide an alkaline environment enabling the use of earth abundant materials as electrocatalysts. In this work, a vapor-fed solar hydrogen generator with KOH-doped poly(vinyl alcohol) anion exchange membrane flanked with NiFe and NiMo catalysts is demonstrated. The device reached an average 15.1% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency at room temperature and 95% relative humidity. This first demonstration of gas phase water splitting with earth abundant catalysts and anion exchange membrane opens a pathway to low cost, autonomous, efficient and safe solar hydrogen generators.									26	0	0	0	2	0	26			2398-4902			WOS:000422798800003

Herein, the kinetic rele-vance between the interfacial pH and reaction rate is deciphered owing to the success in establishing the transport equations of H+/OH- in unbuffered solutions, and is charted as a current (j)-pH diagram in the form of an electrochemical response. The as-described j-pH interplay is experimentally verified by the oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions. This diagram serves to form a panoramic graphic view of pH function working on the interfacial reactions in conjunction with the Pourbaix's potential-pH diagram, and particularly enables a kinetic understanding of the transport effect of H+ and OH- on the reaction rate and valuable instruction toward associated pH control and buffering manipulation.

It is shown that oxidation and reconstruction of the catalyst surface during CER is a consequence of the interaction between RuO2 and water. The state of the RuO2 surface during the electrochemical reaction was analyzed in situ by using Raman spectroscopy to monitor vibrations of the crystal lattice of RuO2 and changes in the surface concentration of the adsorbed species as a function of the electrode potential. The role of the solvent was recognized as being crucial in the formation of an oxygen-containing hydrophilic layer, which is a key prerequisite for electrocatalytic Cl2 formation. Water (more precisely the OH adlayer) is understood not just as a medium that allows adsorption of intermediates, but also as an integral part of the intermediate formed during the electrochemical reaction. New insights into the general understanding of electrocatalysis were obtained by utilizing the vibration frequencies of the crystal lattice as a dynamic catalytic descriptor instead of thermodynamic descriptors, such as the adsorption energy of intermediates. Interpretation of the derived volcano curve suggests that electrocatalysis is governed by a resonance phenomenon.									38	1	0	0	2	0	38			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000310074200005	22893626

Herein, we report a novel strategy to prepare iridium single-atoms (Ir-SAs) on ultrathin NiCo2O4 porous nanosheets (Ir-NiCo2O4 NSs) by the co-electrodeposition method. The surface-exposed Ir-SAs couplings with oxygen vacancies (V-o) exhibit boosting the catalysts OER activity and stability in acid media. They display superior OER performance with an ultralow overpotential of 240 mV at j = 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability of 70 h in acid media. The TOFs of 1.13 and 6.70 s(-1) at an overpotential of 300 and 370 mV also confirm their remarkable performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the prominent OER performance arises from the surface electronic exchange-andtransfer activities contributed by atomic Ir incorporation on the intrinsic V-o existed NiCo2O4 surface. The atomic Ir sites substantially elevate the electronic activity of surface lower coordinated Co sites nearby V-o, which facilitate the surface electronic exchange-and-transfer capabilities. With this trend, the preferred H2O activation and stabilized *O have been reached toward competitively lower overpotential. This is a generalized key for optimally boosting OER performance.									133	8	0	0	4	0	134			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000582673500014	32955265

On metal oxides, the interaction between H2O and the surface can lead to the formation of oxygen vacancies (VOs) and alter the reaction pathway for overall H2O splitting. Herein, the free energy profiles of two different pathways on the In2O3 (110) surface are calculated based on density functional theory, and the relation between surface VO formation and the reactivity of surface VOs reveals that surface VOs with a lower formation energy are more unfavorable for H-2 evolution. Doping In2O3 with a transition metal can effectively enhance the electron transfer from the surface O atoms to the doped metal, benefitting the formation of surface VOs and causing the doped metal to become the active reaction center for H2O splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000696175400025

The current paradigm for describing the electrocatalytic activity of these oxides relies on the averaged oxidation state of the transition metal in the structure, which often fails to systematically describe activity. In addition, the current design strategies mainly focus on activity and often overlook oxide stability. Therefore, the development of robust criteria that rely on measurable oxide properties and can shed light on the electrochemical activity and stability of these oxides still remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate an approach for correlating experimentally measurable oxide properties (i.e., oxide surface reducibility) with the oxide activity and stability. This is demonstrated through the use of electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as a probe reaction. We show that the oxide surface reducibility describes the transition metal-lattice oxygen bond strength and captures effects from both the oxide composition and crystal symmetry on the binding energetics of the oxygenated intermediates and consequently the ORR activity and stability. Comprehensive design strategies for efficient ORR. on nonstoichiometric mixed metal oxides are devised. Such strategies have the potential to be extended to other oxygen-related catalytic reactions on these nonstoichiometric mixed metal oxides.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			2155-5435			WOS:000494549700084

Here, we take advantage of the oxygen functionalities present in GO to aid in anchoring the metal ions followed by epoxide -assisted Ni-FeOx@GO network formation.

The monoliths exhibited excellent OER activity yielding a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 350 mV versus RHE, Tafel slope of 38 mV decade(-1), and a TOF value of 50 s(-1) on par with the established Ni-Fe based electrocatalysts.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			0743-7463			WOS:000391898100002	28004940

The diversity of coordination geometric structures is limited to the traditional in-plane configuration, with only a little consideration paid to out-of-plane configurations due to the lack of suitable carriers and fabrication methods. This study reports out-of-plane coordination of Co-based single-atom catalysts mediated by the conjugated bipyridine-rich covalent organic framework (COF). The bipyridine nitrogen on the COF layer backbone of these catalysts serves as the linker center for cobalt sites anchoring, while the complementary moieties are coordinated at the other side of the Co metal and reside beyond the COF backbone plane, thus yielding out-of-plane coordination. The electrochemical experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that catalysts with multiple out-of-plane coordinations exhibit different electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activities and catalytic pathways. The out-of-plane coordination enabled by COFs provides a strategy for designing single-atom electrocatalysts, expanding the application of COFs in the field of electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000857620900001	36135721

Understanding the intrinsic catalytic activity provides insight into improved catalyst design. Experimental and computationally predicted activity trends, however, have varied substantially. Here we describe a new OER activity trend for nominally oxyhydroxide thin films of Ni(Fe)OxHy > Co(Fe)OxHy > FeOxHy-AuOx > FeOxHy > CoOxHy > NiOxHy > MnOxHy. This intrinsic trend has been previously obscured by electrolyte impurities, potential-dependent electrical conductivity, and difficulty in correcting for surface-area or mass-loading differences. A quartz-crystal microbalance was used to monitor mass in situ and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to measure composition and impurity levels. These new results provide a basis for comparison to theory and help guide the design of improved catalyst systems.									351	11	0	0	23	0	353			1948-7185			WOS:000361858800036	26722749

Herein, we report a novel and high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalystviainterface engineering within the NiCo2O4/NiCoP heterostructure. Such an interface-modulated strategy can significantly facilitate the generation of rich oxygen vacancies and enrich the active sites at the boundary of the prepared NiCo2O4/NiCoP heterostructure, leading to favorable electronic structure and fast charge-transfer capacity. For the OER, the NiCo2O4/NiCoP heterostructure exhibits an extremely low overpotential of about 295 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is much better than that of pristine counterparts. Impressively, a low overpotential of about 198 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)can meet the requirement for HER for this heterostructure in alkaline media. Furthermore, overall water-splitting can be realized through the functioning of the NiCo2O4/NiCoP heterostructure as the cathode and anode simultaneously with a cell voltage of only 1.66 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). This work provides a promising interface-regulated strategy to realize the transition metal heterostructure as an efficient electrocatalyst in energy-related applications.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000560593800015

Using in situ spectroelectrochemistry, we present herein a comprehensive discussion on the structural and morphological evolution of MOFs (zeolitic imidazolate framework-67, ZIF-67) during both cyclic voltammetry and amperometry. Dramatic morphological changes exposing electron-accessible Co sites are evident. The intense conversion from tetrahedral Co sites in ZIF-67 to tetrahedral alpha-Co(OH)(2) and octahedral beta-Co(OH)(2), and the formation of their corresponding oxidized forms (CoOOH), is observed during both the electrochemical treatments. Subsequent oxygen evolution reaction suggests the CoOOH produced from alpha/beta-Co(OH)(2) as the dominating active sites, not the metal nodes of ZIF-67. Specifically, the CoOOH from alpha-Co(OH)(2) is most active (turnover frequency = 0.59 s(-1)) compared to that from beta-Co(OH)(2) (0.06 s(-1)). Our study demonstrates the importance of examining the electrochemical stability of MOFs for electrocatalyst design.									125	3	0	0	11	0	125			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100011

A series of analytical techniques indicate formation of a layered uniform nanosheets from the underlying nickel foam which incorporate in situ generated FeOOH. Thanks to the synergistic interaction between Fe and Ni and the good electrical connection between the active catalyst and conductive substrate by the direct growth, the hierarchically structured electrode exhibits high electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution with low overpotential, small Tafel slope and excellent long-term durability. In 1 M KOH, a current density of 20 mA/cm(2) is achieved at an overpotential of only 210 mV with a Tafel slope of 29 mV/decade, which is competitive or superior to various electrocatalysts on the 3D nickel foam under similar conditions. Considering the simple and facile electrode preparation, the low cost and environmental friendliness of the electrode materials, and the excellent catalytic performance, the FeOOH-NF electrode would be a promising anode candidate for the OER in large scale water electrolysis.

The key measure is to develop efficient and sustainable WOCs that can support a sustainable photocatalyst to reduce over-potentials and thus to enhance reaction rate of water oxidation reaction. Cobalt has been indentified as active component of WOCs for photo/electrochemical water oxidation, and its performance relies strongly on the contact and adhesion of the cobalt species with photoactive substrates. Here, cobalt is homogeneously engineered into the framework of pristine graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) via chemical interaction, establishing surface junctions on the polymeric photocatalyst for the water oxidation reaction. This modification promotes the surface kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction by the g-C3N4-based photocatalytic system made of inexpensive substances, and further optimizations in the optical and textural structure of Co-g-C3N4 is envisaged by considering ample choice of modification schemes for carbon nitride materials.									246	19	0	0	17	1	250			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000350981000021	25302641

The samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), laser micro-Raman spectrometry, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron mi-croscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS). Due to the increased number of catalytic active sites, good conductivity and stability of porous carbon, N-doped carbon and Mo-Ni bonds, the Mo-0.003-Ni/NC composite exhibits outstanding catalytic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media.

Herein, rod-like S-doped g-C3N4 has been used as the nitrogen-rich precursor to synthesize an excellent oxygen electrocatalyst Co@bCNTs by a facile two-step route including cobalt-infiltration and subsequent pyrolysis. In Co@bCNTs, Co nanoparticles are encapsulated within N, S-doped bamboo-like carbon nanotubes (bCNTs), which further are tangled with the doped graphene and hybridized with a small amount of amorphous CoSx. Benefiting from its effective N dopant, highly graphitized carbon and the synergistic effects of its components with different functionalities, the as-prepared catalyst has superior bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalytic activities with a small potential difference of 0.72 V and outstanding durability. Its assembled liquid and all-solid-state flexible batteries show excellent performance with peak power densities up to 190.3 and 106.2 mW cm-2, respectively. This work provides a new dimension to design and prepare high-performance bifunctional oxygen eletrocatalysts using nitrogen-rich polymers for developing rechargeable zinc-air batteries.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000796201900003

Water splitting reaction is made up of two half electrochemical reactions - hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER). The principal components of these electrochemical reactions are electrode materials, which are currently facing challenges in performance improvement, thus developing advanced electrode materials or electrocatalysts is essential. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline porous materials that have recently exhibited great potential as precursor for designing excellent water splitting electrocatalysts. These MOF-derived materials are not attractive just because of high-performance in electrocatalysis but also owing to their fascinating nanostructures, which are difficult to achieve by other synthetic methods. Search for well-shaped nanostructured materials using MOF as a precursor for water splitting have attracted the attention in recent time and is a rapidly growing research area. This review summarizes the progress towards MOF-derived electrocatalysts for water electrolysis especially focusing on nanostructure engineering, structure-property correlations, and their bifunctional HER/OER performances. Performance of these bifunctional catalysts in two-electrode electrolyzers are also discussed. Finally, existing obstacles and the future prospects of MOF-derived bifunctional water splitting electrocatalysts are elaborated.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000678687300001

Compared to the commercial carbon-supported Pt catalysts, all Pt NWs exhibited better electrocatalytic activities towards both methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The MOR activity of the Pt NWs increased dramatically as the annealing temperature (T-A) increased, whereas the ORR activity followed the trend of 'as-prepared' > 600 degrees C > 400 degrees C > 200 degrees C. This phenomenon should be attributed to the NWs surface rearrangement during the annealing process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a method for the preparation of Ni2P, Fe2P, and FeP supported on N-doped graphene (NiP/NG and FeP/NG) is reported. The procedure uses metal salts, phosphorous oxide, and chitosan as precursors of metal phosphide and N-doped graphene, avoiding the use of undesirable and hazardous precursors, such as PH3 or NaH2PO2, and rendering a material with a strong metal phosphide-graphene interaction. Moreover, NiP/NG and FeP/NG electrodes are demonstrated to be more efficient than the benchmark catalysts Pt/C and RuO2, for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, at a large current density (300 mA/cm(2)). In addition, water electrolysis was carried out using NiP/NG//FeP/NG electrodes, also demonstrating improved efficiency and stability compared with Pt/C//RuO2 at a current density (400 mA/cm(2)) near industrial requirements.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2666-3864		WOS:000805830100005

Based on the systematic synthesis and Rietveld refinement results, the lattice constants were tunable depending on the ionic radius of the lanthanide used. Subsequently, Pr-based pyrochlore oxides containing Ru and Ir in different ratios were fabricated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, and the OER activity of these catalysts increased when the content of Ir and Ru was the same. Thus, the co-substitution of Ir and Ru in pyrochlore oxides is a novel synthesis strategy for electrocatalysts, which provides great potential for the fabrication of other pyrochlore oxides with various architectures and compositions for application in electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1996-1944		WOS:000851706100001	36079484

Using common nickel mesh as a substrate, Ni- Fe alloy with hierarchical pores is formed in-situ via one-step electrodeposition. The electrodeposition of Ni and Fe is accompanied by hydrogen evolution, the generated hydrogen bubble facilitate the formation of hierarchically porous structure. The particular porous structure of the Ni-Fe alloy is beneficial to OER in terms of charge transfer and gas bubble release. For this structure is formed under a very similar condition, i. e., gas evolution, it adapts well when working on OER. The Ni-Fe alloy catalyst with 15% Fe shows the best performance of an overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA·cm~(-2) and a low Tafel slop of 35 mV· dec~(-1). Furthermore, the Ni-Fe alloy catalyst presents remarkable durability under industrial alkaline water electrolysis conditions for 250 h. Therefore, the hierarchically porous Ni-Fe alloy prepared via onestep electrodeposition is a promising OER catalyst in alkaline water electrolysis.			以镍网为基底,通过一步电沉积方法成功制备出用于碱性水电解的多孔镍铁合金析氧反应(Oxygen Evolution Reaction, OER)电极。镍铁的沉积伴随强烈的析氢,此条件下构筑出的多级孔结构成为电极用于OER反应时液相中传质与气泡释放的适宜传递通道。在析氧反应中,电流密度为10 mA·cm~(-2)时的过电位仅为210 mV,Tafel斜率为35 mV·dec~(-1),催化活性超过商用的Ir催化剂和许多已报道的镍铁基催化剂。在60 ℃ 、30% KOH以及电流密度≥200 mA·cm~(-2)的工况下,电极稳定运行250 h,性能无明显衰减,表现出优异的稳定性。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1004-9533			CSCD:7219986

However, one of the major operational concern for the successful commercialization of Zn-air batteries lies in the cost of the electrodes required for oxygen catalytic activities. In this study, we report a series of inexpensive first row transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts that show excellent bifunctionality towards both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A bifunctional catalyst having efficiency both for ORR and OER would be highly desirable as it can not only reduce cost but also suppress undesired side reactions. Here, Fe-doped manganese oxide (MnO2) nanorods were synthesized by a one-step, low-cost, facile hydrothermal method. Different ratios of Fe-doping were invorporated in the MnO2 nanorods and their bifunctional ORR and OER activities were compared with the undoped MnO2, commercially available ORR catalysts (Pt/C) and OER catalysts (RuO2), respectively. The most efficient Fe-doped MnO2 showed an onset potential of 0.89 V (vs. RHE), which is very close to commercial Pt/C (onset potential = 1.01 V) for ORR. The optimal Fe-doped MnO2 material exhibited an overpotential of 660 mV for OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 58 mV per decade. The overall oxygen electroactivity Delta E = E-j(OER)=10 - E-1/2(ORR) = 1.17 V for the best Fe-doped MnO2 was lower than that of the various state-of-the-art bifunctional electrocatalysts. Finally, a solid-state zinc-air battery was made for powering a light-emitting diode. This work provides an easy strategy to develop low-cost doped oxide nanostructures with multiple functionality for energy conversion and storage devices.									32	2	0	0	2	0	32			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000460322700015

The scarce Ir is a crucial element for the synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Carbon supported Ir oxide catalysts obtained from surfactant-free colloidal Ir nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized in alkaline methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), and ethylene glycol (EG) are investigated and compared. The comparison of independent techniques such as transition electron microscopy (TEM), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and electrochemistry allows shedding light on the parameters that affect the dispersion of the active phase as well as the initial catalytic activity. The colloidal dispersions obtained are suitable to develop supported OER catalysts with little NP agglomeration on a carbon support. Due to the high dispersion of the active phase, initial catalytic activities of more than 400 A gIr(1) are reached at 1.5 V-RHE when using carbon as a model support. While the more common surfactant-free alkaline EG synthesis requires flocculation and re-dispersion leading to Ir loss, the main difference between methanol and ethanol as solvent is related to the dispersibility of the support material. The choice of the suitable monoalcohol determines the maximum achieved Ir loading on the support without detrimental particle agglomeration. This simple consideration on catalyst design can readily assist the implementation of more relevant support materials for technical applications and significantly improved catalysts.

Electrochemical testing showed that the amorphous alloy possessed a lower Tafel slope and enhanced kinetics for the OER compared to crystalline Ni and Ni95Co5. Anodic cycling of the amorphous alloy resulted in a lower onset potential for the OER and decreased Tafel values while no changes were observed for crystalline Ni95Co5. Pairing of in situ confocal Raman spectroscopy with anodic cycling showed that the amorphous alloy formed reversible hydrous Co oxy/hydroxides instead of irreversible CoO2 typically seen on crystalline NiCo alloys in KOH. The formation of hydrous Co oxy/hydroxides upon cycling was also accompanied by increased formation of beta-NiOOH leading to enhanced catalytic performance of the amorphous alloy over the crystalline counterparts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1938-5862			INSPEC:18500742		
J	Zhou, Xin; Dong, Hao								Density Functional Studies on Layered Perovskite Oxyhalide Bi4MO8X Photocatalysts (M = Nb and Ta, X = Cl, Br, and I)								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				121	38			20662	20672		10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b06576				SEP 28 2017	2017	Layered perovskite oxyhalides Bi4MO8X (M = Nb and Ta, X = Cl, Br, and I) have recently emerged as suitable photocatalysts for the photocatalytic water splitting reaction and degradation of organics. Here, we present a comparative study on the crystal structure, electronic structure, water adsorption, and oxygen evolution reaction of these systems. The calculated band gaps using hybrid density functional method HSE06 are smaller than 2.75 eV and increase with the increase of X atomic number, which is in excellent agreement with experimental data. All Bi4MO8X systems possess indirect band gaps, which benefits the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The density of states reveals that, for all the Bi4MO8X cases, the valence band maximum is mostly composed of O 2p states rather than X np states, which can explain the observed stability of these materials against photocorrosion. It is found that the molecular adsorption of water is energetically favorable on Bi4MO8X(001) surfaces. As a result, the computed free energy changes for every step in the oxygen evolution reaction show that the rate determining step is the first step of generating OH* species for all the cases. The computed overpotentials (0.69-0.77 V) of Bi4MO8X for the oxygen evolution reaction are comparable to and even lower than those of widely used photocatalysts for water oxidation, such as TiO2, WO3, BiVO4, and alpha-Fe2O3. The calculations suggest that Bi4MO8X (M = Ta and Nb, X = Cl, Br, and I) are potential photocatalysts for overall water splitting in the visible light region, and we hope that the results reported in this work will stimulate experimental tests of our predictions.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000412150500012

NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) intercalated with different dicarboxylate anions were tested among which suberate anion intercalated NiFe LDH was found to be a great OER catalyst which outperformed RuO2, especially when the current density was larger than 2 mA cm-2. The suberate anion intercalated NiFe LDH needed an overpotential of 387 mV to reach 1 mA cm-2 which is one of the lowest among all reported non-noble-metal OER catalysts on fluorine-doped tin oxide electrode and an overpotential of 420 mV to achieve 2 mA cm-2 which is much lower than that of RuO2. Moreover, this material showed great stability for at least 24 h. All the NiFe LDHs intercalated with dicarboxylate anions showed good OER performance, which could be attributed to the ldquostructural instabilityrdquo induced ldquoin-situ anion exchangerdquo process during OER.

The crystallization degree of hydrotalcite-like compound is high, and the lamellar structure is homogeneous with no agglomeration, which helps to build efficient mass-transfer layer channel of OH-ions. The NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH)/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) electrode shows good performance and stability for OER. The potential of NiFe LDH/CNTs electrode is only 0.592 V (vs HgO/Hg) at 200 mA center dot cm(-2) in 6 mol center dot L-1 potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte, which shows excellent catalytic activity for OER. The NiFe LDH/CNTs electrode works continuously for 620 hours at 200 mA center dot cm(-2), with the groove voltage only rises 0.1 V.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000465092800031

However, the energy efficiency is also critical for the possible industrialization of the process, as it specifies the energy recovered in the product. Here, we report that the energy efficiency is 35.6% when a Pt electrode is used as the anode, and it can increase to 42.1% when an IrxSnyRuzO2/Ti electrode with lower overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction is used as the anode, in spite of their faradaic efficiencies for producing formate are very close (85.1% and 84.8%). When the IrxSnyRuzO2/Ti electrode coated with Nafion membrane is used as the anode, the faradaic efficiency can maintain at 79.6% through a long time electrolysis of CO2 for 500 C.									19	1	0	0	1	0	20			2046-2069			WOS:000359568400053

Oxazole is a five-membered heterocycle with nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the ring. Oxazole is part of complex structures used in medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, and material chemistry. In the excited state, the oxazole ring can rearrange itself via several reaction mechanisms. In this paper, an extensive literature overview is given for photoisomerisations (phototranspositions) in oxazole, isoxazole, and benzisoxazole ring. A literature review is also given for phototransformations of the ring in the presence of oxygen (photooxygenation reactions), as well as for photoformation of the oxazole ring.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-9830	1334-9090		WOS:000428041600005

The effect of oxygen evolution as side anodic reaction on the figures of merit of the reactor is studied.

Here, based on a bioinformatic analysis of cyanobacterial oxygen evolution and reduction enzymes (photosystem II: PS II and cytochrome c oxidase: COX, respectively), the gene encoding the catalytic D1 subunit of PSII was found to be expressed individually across 38 phylogenetically diverse strains, which is in contrast to the operon structure of the genes encoding major COX subunits. Selective synthesis of the D1 subunit minimizes the repair cost of PSII, which allows compensation for its instability by lowering the turnover number required to generate a net positive energy yield. The different bioenergetics observed between PSII and COX suggest that in addition to the catalytic activity rationalized by the Sabatier principle, stability factors have also provided a major influence on the design strategy of biological multi-electron transfer enzymes.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1868-1743	1868-1751		WOS:000441004100004	29756682

Iridium is a well-accepted active and corrosion-resistant component of catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, its scarcity demands breakthroughs in catalyst preparation technologies to ensure its most efficient utilisation. This minireview focusses on the wet-chemistry synthetic methods of the most active and (potentially) durable iridium catalysts for acidic OER, selected from the recent publications in the open literature. The catalysts are classified by their synthesis methods, with authors' opinion on their practicality. The review may also guide the selection of the state-of-the-art iridium catalysts for benchmarking purposes.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2056-5135			WOS:000654244300008

However, noble metal catalysts are expensive and unstable, necessitating research into novel metal-organic framework (MOF)-based topologies that can catalyse oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). In this work, the synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C) is derived from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) and a novel Mn-doped Zn-N-C@rGO is synthesized using a self-templated solvothermal method and their performance in an alkaline medium for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is studied. The nanostructured composite outperformed the commercial Pt/C catalyst in terms of both material resources and application efficacy. The Mn/Zn-N-C @30% rGO exhibit outstanding performance for ORR in KOH, with a more positive cathodic peak of 0.78 V vs RHE and an onset potential of 0.97 V vs RHE, which are characteristics that suggest the possibility of reducing ORR overpotentials. The improved electrochemical performance, small Tafel slopes and methanol tolerance are ascribed to the interdependent effect of the N-doped carbon (N-C) and the Mn/Zn active sites. Novel architecture, tunable porosities, template directed growth and remarkable electrocatalytic performance of Mn-doped Zn-N-C@rGO make it a good aspirant for energy applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000795783300011

The energy conversion efficiency of the electrolysis systems is about 56-73% in practical application, and the low energy conversion efficiency greatly limits the large-scale application. Hence, the electrocatalytic water splitting has attracted much attention. Recently, a variety of heterogeneous catalysts have emerged, showing high catalytic water splitting performance. Among them, the heterojunction catalysts occupied a very important position in emerging catalysts. In the heterojunction catalysts, electrons can be rearranged on heterostructures interfaces to modify the properties of active sites, and synergy of different active sites is used to promote the reaction kinetics. The heterojunction catalysts often show a better activity of electrolysis water than single-component catalysts. Herein, we mainly summarize the design strategies and synthesis methods of various heterojunction catalysts and the related applications of these heterojunction catalysts in HER and OER, and further discusses the catalytical mechanisms in HER and OER processes respectively. Through the summary of present progress in electrocatalytic water splitting, this review provides a reasonable prospect on heterojunction catalysts in electrocatalytic water splitting.

Here we report an outstanding anodic catalyst consisting of threedimensional standing arrays of hetero-lateral Ni3S2/Co3S4 (NiCoS) nanosheets uniformly grown on Ni foam for alkaline seawater electrolysis, in which the in-situ derived Ni/Co (oxy)hydroxide surface layer endows abundant active sites and superior resistance to chloride corrosion. Combined with an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst of Ni/Mo sulfides, a two-electrode electrolyzer affords an industrial-level high current density up to 800 mA cm-2 at a super low voltage of 2.08 V for overall alkaline seawater splitting steadily over 100 h without chloride corrosion at room temperature. Furthermore, powered by a commercial single III-V triplejunction solar cell, the integrated system demonstrates light-driven overall seawater splitting with an impressive 15.13 % solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. This work is instrumental in the development of seawater electrolysis for sustainable hydrogen production by renewable energy sources.									50	4	0	0	0	0	51			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663271600004

Here, alkaline water-electrolysis full cells are developed with novel spongy catalysts for both anode and cathode reactions, such as Co3O4 nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (Co3O4/NrGO) composite sponge for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and nickel nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NiNrGO) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The performance of the developed OER catalyst, Co3O4/NrGO, is compared with that of the commercial one (IrO2) in alkaline medium with a common benchmark cathode catalyst (Pt) and an augmented full-cell performance is shown from this novel combination (320mAcm(-2) at an operating voltage of 1.9V for Co3O4/NrGO, with 199mAcm(-2) for IrO2). A water-electrolysis full cell is developed without the use of HER catalyst Pt, but rather using a porous spongy catalyst, NiNrGO, having a low operating potential with a high stability (270mAcm(-2) at an operating voltage of 1.9V with a stability tested for more than 9h). This work opens up the possibilities of designing lightweight water-electrolysis cells without the use of commercial benchmark precious-metal catalysts.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000416248600020

The limiting electrode in a classic two-terminal device such as a battery or fuel cell is difficult to discern without an internal reference electrode, but the flooded electrolyte characteristic of three-electrode electroanalytical cells negates the prime function of an air electrode-a void volume freely accessible to gases. The nanostructured catalysts that drive the energy-conversion reactions (e.g., oxygen reduction and evolution in the air electrode of metal-air batteries) are best evaluated in the electrode structure as-used in the practical device. We have designed, 3D-printed, and characterized an air-breathing, thermodynamically referenced electroanalytical cell that allows us to mimic the Janus arrangement of the gas-diffusion electrode in a metal-air cell: one face freely exposed to gases, the other wetted by electrolyte.									7	0	0	0	0	0	9			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000372797400003	26987282

Pulsed laser deposition was used to grow (100) IrO2 on a (100) SrTiO3 substrate at deposition temperature ranging from room temperature to 600 degrees C. Detailed structural and morphological characterization was performed using AFM, XRD, and X-ray reciprocal space mapping (RSM) to unravel the geometrical arrangement of [IrO6] octahedra in the (100) IrO2 thin films. It is shown that the symmetry mismatch between the substrate and the epitaxial thin film imposed an orthorhombic distortion of the tetragonal structure of IrO2 and, as a consequence, the [IrO6] geometry is distorted. These data were correlated to the OER characteristics established from electrochemical measurements. DFT modeling was employed to relate differences in surface relaxation of IrO2 films prepared at different temperatures with changes in OER activity. Vacancy formation leads to higher surface stability at temperatures around 500 degrees C, which corresponds to the deposition temperature at which the electrocatalytic activity of (100) epitaxial IrO2 film is maximal.									36	5	0	0	1	0	38			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100088

However, the impact of the rate and related phase transformation on OER intrinsic activity during the electrochemical activation process is often overlooked. Herein, we synthesized a kind of Co-MOF with a unique crystal structure in which the center metals were coordinated with the oxygen and nitrogen atoms from two water molecules and organic linkers. The bond strength between the center metals and the coordinated water molecules can be modulated by introducing Fe into Co-MOF, causing the expedited electrochemical activation. First-principles calculations suggest the electronic state of cobalt in CoFe-MOF can be modified to alter the free energy of adsorbed intermediates. Therefore, the obtained electrocatalyst possesses the optimal OER intrinsic activity, showing a low overpotential of 265 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1), and a long-term electrochemical durability with a period of 40 h. The findings are expected to help understand the fundamental principles of electrochemical activation.									142	7	0	0	5	0	142			2155-5435			WOS:000480503700078

We report herein a simple one-pot procedure for the synthesis of non-precious metals N-doped graphene composites employing urea as nitrogen source, and their application as bifunctional catalysts for both the ORR and OER in alkaline environment. In this study, the effects of the addition of Ti and Co on the structure and performance of the N-doped graphene composites are investigated. The incorporation of Ti leads to a composite with both anatase and rutile TiO2 crystalline phases as well as Ti3+ species stabilized upon hybridization with N-doped reduced graphene oxide. The ORR onset potential for the Ti-based composite is 0.85 V (vs. RHE) and the number of electrons transferred is 3.5, showing superior stability than Pt/C after accelerated potential cycling in alkaline solution. However, this composite shows low activity and stability for the OER. On the other hand, the composite consisting of metallic Co and Co3O4 nanocrystals grown on N-doped reduced graphene oxide exhibits the best performance as bifunctional catalyst, with ORR and OER onset potentials of 0.95 V and 1.51 V (vs. RHE), respectively, and a number of electrons transferred of 3.6 (ORR). The results reveal the presence of important structural features such as metallic Co as the predominant crystalline component, amorphous Co3O4 phase and the coordination of Co-N-doped graphene. All of them seem to be fundamental for the high activity and stability towards ORR and OER. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									38	1	0	0	0	0	38			0960-1481			WOS:000433648500016

Therefore, developing new economically and environmentally friendly methods of synthesizing Co-Ni-NPs has become a practical requirement. Co-Ni-NPs were produced by employing the liquid-phase reduction method. Nickel and cobalt sulfate solutions in hydrazine monohydrate with various mixing ratios were used as raw materials. Nickel plays an important role in the nucleation process via increasing the reduction reaction rate throughout the formation of Co-Ni-NPs. Furthermore, the acceleration of the Co-Ni-NPs formation process may be attributed to the partial dissolution of Ni(OH)(2) in the presence of N2H4 and/or citrate-anions and the formation of the Ni-N2H4 or Ni-Cit complexes in contrast to Co(OH)(2).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1687-9503	1687-9511		WOS:000737184800001

This review collects a selection of the recent breakthroughs that are related to the application of phosphorene in catalysis and electrocatalysis.

Once functionalized with transition metals nanoparticles (Co, Ni, Pd, Pt, Ag, Au), its catalytic activity has been evaluated in several processes, mainly hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions.

To date, a large number of electrocatalysts have been used for electrochemical water splitting (EWS). Nowadays, the quest for a universal pH stable bifunctional electrocatalyst that can efficiently enhance the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HERs and OERs) is gaining significant interest in the research community. This approach avoids the divergence in the pH of the electrolyte for OER and HER activity and effectively reduces the difficulty and system cost in practical EWS.

The shell exhibits atomically mixed Ru and Rh phases with an fcc atomic structure, although the hcp atomic structure is commonly found for the bulk Ru. We also report an unusually high catalytic activity of the Cu@RhRu octahedral nanocrystals toward the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000361675300006	26323248

Herein, an excellent platform to investigate the role of the strucutre in tuning catalytic activity is provided by varying Fe/Co ratio in a bismuth niobate pyrochlore oxide. Continuous Co-level from 0 to 100% was ingeniously designed on the basis of special phase diagrams and pryocholore-type pure samples were successfully fabricated by a modified sol-gel auto-combustion method. The effect of structural modulation on dielectric property and multi-functional catalytic activities were studied. Significantly, two opposing strucutral shifts were observed with increasing the Co-level, ascribled to the competition between displacive disorders on the Bi sites and strucutral distortions in the octahedral network. Tunable dielectric relaxation was exhibited by electrical modulus spectroscopy and one additional hidden relaxation process implies an outstanding thermal motion of electrons from variable oxidation states of Fe3+/ Co2+ ions when ionized oxygen vacancy becomes weak. For photocatalysis, the low-level Co showed a best visible-light-responsive photocatalytic activity by means of the RhB-dye decomposition, while the high-level Co exhibited a higher photoinduced current density. For electrocatalysis, the sample that maintains its structure with the coexistence of massive oxygen vacancies and low-spinstate Co2+ present a superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, with a lower OER overpotential (-300 mV at 10 mA/cm2) and a smaller Tafel slope (-70 mV/dec). Moreover, the underlying mechanism of the improved performances was analyzed in detail and the new insights were provied for constructing single-phase multi-functioning catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000822981300002

In this work, we systematically investigate the catalytic activity of single transition metal (TM) atom suppported on defective boron nitride nanoribbon (TMN4-BNNR, TM = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Mo, Ru and Rh) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by using density functional theory. Our computation demonstrated all TM atoms can bind strongly with uncoordinated four N atoms on N-doped defective BNNR. Furthermore, FeN4-BNNR and RhN4-BNNR are screened as the most efficient catalysts for both HER and OER, with the low HER/OER overpotential being 0.07/0.52 V and 0.18/0.27 V. The activity of TMN4-BNNR is constrained by the binding strength toward intermediates and depends on the electron-donating ability and d band center of catalyst. This work proposes a cost-effective and high-performance single atom catalyst for water electrochemical splitting.									9	2	0	0	0	0	9			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000670079000002

Herein, a highly conductive inverse spinel (Fe3O4) and anti-perovskite (Ni3FeN) hetero-structured nanocomposite is reported as a superior oxygen evolution electrocatalyst, which can be facilely prepared based on a one-pot synthesis strategy. Thanks to the strong hybridization between Ni/Fe 3d and N 2p orbitals, the Ni3FeN is easily transformed into NiFe (oxy)hydroxide as the real active species during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, while the Fe(3)O(4)component with low O-p band center relative to Fermi level is structurally stable. As a result, both high surface reactivity and bulk electronic transport ability are reached. By directly growing Fe3O4/Ni3FeN heterostructure on freestanding carbon fiber paper and testing based on the three-electrode configuration, it requires only 160 mV overpotential to deliver a current density of 30 mA cm(-2)for OER. Also, negligible performance decay is observed within a prolonged test period of 100 h. This work sheds light on the rational design of novel heterostructure materials for electrocatalysis.									30	1	0	0	0	0	30			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000544752900001	32602259

Herein, an interview of the progress achieved for the synthesis of noble metal-free high-entropy materials and catalytic mechanisms toward water splitting is provided. Some typical synthesis strategies have been systematically reviewed to highlight the advances in synthesizing highly efficient and noble-metal-free high-entropy catalysts. Next, the distinctive advantages of high-entropy materials for the electrochemical water splitting are also manifested to show their great promise for serving as advanced electrocatalysts. Moreover, some representative examples regarding the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and overall water splitting based on noble-metal-free high-entropy catalysts are also discussed. In the end, future directions and new energy conversion technologies that can be enabled by the application of noble-metal-free high-entropy materials are outlined.

J	Zhu, Chengfeng; Chen, Zhigang; Gong, Wenbin; Li, Hao; Liu, Xuejian; Gan, Xinxin; Yang, Guang; Di, Jiangtao; Cui, Yi								Direct detection of self-reconstruction-accelerated oxygen evolution activity in MoCoNi hydroxides								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				605						154669	10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.154669				DEC 15 2022	2022	The exploration of cost-effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is valuable for high-performance water electrolysis in alkaline electrolytes. Surface reconstruction can endow earth-abundant multimetal ox-ides/hydroxides with noble-metal-comparable OER activity, because their electronic structures can be spontaneously regulated towards favorable adsorption energies of oxygen-containing OER intermediates in electrolysis. However, the direct detection of subtly modified electronic structures is very challenging because of the rather rapid surface-reconstruction process. Herein, Mo-based CoNi hydroxide marked with the most universal surface -reconstructed OER catalyst is selected as a model material for investigating the surface-reconstruction -accelerated OER activity. The surface-reconstructed MoCoNi catalyst exhibits a superior OER activity with a low overpotential (282 mV) at 10 mA/cm(2) and a small Tafel slope of 49.3 mV/dec. Moreover, the oxygen -vacancy-rich catalyst shows a commercial RuO2-comparable stability for OER process over 100 h. Thanks to the advantage of vacuum-connected glove box and near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) system, the subtle changes of potential-dependent oxygen vacancies and neighboring metal centers are directly detected by NAP-XPS characterization, which clearly reveals the surface-reconstruction-induced evolution of oxygen vacancies and electronic structure of neighboring metal centers in MoCoNi catalyst. Based on the morphological observation and spectroscopy characterization, the DFT model of self-reconstructed Co-NiOOH catalyst with oxygen vacancy is established, and comprehensive theoretic simulations confirm that the surface-constructed oxygen vacancies benefit the regulation of electronic structure of neighboring metal atoms with favorable binding affinity to OER intermediates.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000863078500004

Herein, we report the electrocatalytic activity depending on the crystallinity of Mo-doped Co-3(PO4)(2) (PiMoCo). A series of PiMoCo with different crystalline structures were controllably preparedviaco-precipitation and heat treatment. The PiMoCos obtained at room temperature and 800 degrees C were crystalline, while those obtained at 300-500 degrees C were amorphous. The electrocatalysis of PiMoCo depended on their phase transformation, which can be controlled by the temperature of heat treatment. The electrochemical performances for oxygen evolution reaction show that the PiMoCos with the amorphous phase exhibit high activity and stability. This work provides an insight into the electrocatalysis performance depending on the crystallinity of catalysts and the water molecules in the lattice of PiMoCo.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1466-8033		WOS:000571346300008

Aqueous 0.1 M KOH was used as the electrolyte. All four catalysts were oxidized or converted to CuO and Cu(OH)(2) during a slow anodic sweep of cyclic voltammetry and exhibited similar activities for the OER A Raman peak at 603 cm(-1) appeared for all the four samples at OER-relevant potentials, >= 1.62 V vs RHE. This peak was identified as the Cu-O stretching vibration band of a Cu-III oxide, a metastable species whose existence is dependent on the applied potential. Since this frequency matches well with that from a (NaCuO2)-O-III standard, we suggest composition of the Cum oxide is CuO2- -like. The four catalysts, in stark contrast, did not oxidize the same way during direct chronoamperometry measurements at 1.7 V vs RHE. Cu-III oxide was observed only on the CuO and Cu(OH)(2) electrodes. Interestingly, these two electrodes catalyzed the OER similar to 10 times more efficiently than the Cu and Cu2O catalysts. By correlating Cu-III oxide and the extent of the OER activity, we propose that Cu-III species provides the intensity of the Raman band of catalytically active sites for the electrochemical water oxidation. The formation of Cu-III oxides on CuO films during OER was also corroborated by in situ XANES measurements of the Cu K-edge. The catalytic role of Cu-III oxide in the O-2 evolution reaction is proposed and discussed.									385	7	0	0	33	3	390			2155-5435			WOS:000373524400040

In particular, the reconstruction process of most of these electrocatalysts is either slow or occurs only on the surface, which thus restrains the OER performance of the electrocatalysts. Herein, we reveal a fast and deep reconstruction of the coprecipitated Fe phosphates on nickel foam, via in situ Raman spectroscopy together with electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical tests. The generated NiFe (oxy)hydroxide nanosheets after reconstruction behave as the real active sites for the OER in the alkaline condition, with a low overpotential and excellent durability. The present work provides deep insights on the reconstruction dynamics of OER electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1948-7185			WOS:000757522900009	35129340

In fact, a proper catalyst is needed in order to facilitate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode, and platinum is considered the best material due to its low overpotential for this reaction. Contrary to platinum, MnxOy is inexpensive, environmentally friendly and can be shaped into several nanostructures; furthermore, most of them show significant electro-catalytic performance. Several strategies have been carried out in order to increase their efficiency, by preparing light and high-surface area materials. In this framework, nanofibres are among the most promising nanostructures that can be used for this purpose. In this work, a study of the thermal, morphological and catalytic behavior of MnxOy nanofibres obtained through the electrospinning technique is proposed. Emphasis is given to the thermal evolution of the precursors, proposing a possible crystallization mechanism of the different manganese oxides obtained. It turns out that manganese oxide nanofibres exhibit good catalytic performance for the ORR, comparable to those obtained by using Pt-based catalysts.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000414243300030	29048084

The polarizable continuum model (PCM) is utilized to calculate energies in the aqueous phase. Both neutral and alkaline media are considered.

This process, however, is kinetically hindered by the oxygen evolution half-cell reaction (OER). Nickel (Ni)-based materials in combination with iron (Fe) have been considered a promising option to enhance activity toward OER in alkaline media. Studies have also shown that incorporating ceria (CeO2) into electrocatalysts can help promote the OER. This study investigates the OER activity of bimetallic Ni-Fe spherical nanoparticles, with and without ceria, synthesized by chemical reduction in ethanol using sodium borohydride. First, the iron content is studied for Ni100-xFex / 50 wt% CeO2 (x = 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 at%); then, the ceria content is studied for the best two iron compositions, namely, Ni80Fe20 / y wt% CeO2 and Ni90Fe10 / y wt%CeO2 (y = 0, 5, 7, 10, 20, and 50 wt%). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) characterization show spherical particles 4-6 nm in size, where Ni and Fe are co-distributed, and ceria is separately agglomerated. Electrochemical characterization in 1 M KOH shows that at 10 mA cm(-2), the Ni80Fe20 catalyst achieved the lowest overpotential for OER of 269 mV, which is better performing than the iridium black benchmark, as well as similar NiFe materials reported in literature. Stability testing indicates that the Ni90Fe10 catalyst is the most stable material with almost no change in overpotential over 12 h at 10 mA cm(-2). This study shows that the addition of CeO2 to the catalysts does not significantly improve or impede OER activity.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000662795800001

Herein, a novel strategy has been demonstrated for developing the OER electrocatalyst by doping Co(II) in to a three-dimensional Cd-based MOF that contains a naked pyridine moieties in the form of uncoordinated ligand. Electrochemically active CoCd-MOF was resulted through the doping of Co(II) into the inactive Cd-MOF. CoCd-MOF exhibited very high catalytic activity in water oxidation reaction.

It is highly desirable to develop efficient and stable OER electrocatalysts for the advancement of water-splitting. Herein, by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically investigated a series of two-dimensional (2D) dual-atom catalysts (DACs) on a novel synthesized covalent organic framework (COF) material as potential efficient catalysts toward the OER. The designed 6 homonuclear (2TM-COF) and 15 heteronuclear (TM1TM2-COF) DACs all exhibit good stability. There is a strong scaling relationship between the adsorption Gibbs free energies of HO* and HOO* intermediates, and the OER overpotential (eta(OER)) volcano curve can be plotted as a function of Delta G(O)* - Delta G(HO)*. RhIr-COF shows the best OER catalytic activity with a eta(OER) value of 0.29 V, followed by CoNi-COF (0.33 V), RuRh-COF (0.34 V), and Nilr-COF (0.37 V). These four OER DACs exhibit lower onset potential and higher current density than that of the IrO2(110) benchmark catalyst. Aided by the descriptor identification study, the Bader charge that correlated with the Pauling electronegativity of the embedded dual-metal atoms was found to be the most important factor governing the catalytic activity of the OER. Our work highlights a potentially efficient class of 2D COF-based DACs toward the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000814009600001

The colloidal amorphous IrOx nanoparticles are highly active for oxygen evolution reaction. However, their application for water splitting has a dilemma that the traditional annealing process could lead to low activities but the nanoparticles based electrode without annealing usually exhibited low stability. This nanostructured water splitting electrode exhibited both the high activities as the colloidal IrOx nanoparticles and comparable stability as a traditional thermal annealing fabricated electrode. The impedance study revealed that conformal TiO2 significantly inhibits the interface oxidation and maintains the high activity of colloidal IrOx nanoparticles catalysts. The conformal TiO2 interface engineering combined with nanocatalysts would be a promising strategy to achieve balanced activities splitting.									26	0	0	0	3	0	26			2168-0485			WOS:000414825900153

Due to high energy efficiency of microwave heating, microwave assisted solvothermal synthesis could play a major role in environmental friendly synthesis routes. This approach could also be a key step for sustainable production of highly active materials like electro-catalysts. Therefore, we developed a simplified and shortened solvothermal microwave assisted one pot synthesis to produce highly active NiFe-LDH supported on Vulcan XC-72R. The synthesis was studied for reproducibility in loading, composition and activity using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), X-ray diffraction and rotating ring disk electrodes (RDE) in a three electrode set-up.

In this work, hierarchical N-doped carbon-encapsulated Ni3S2 grown on a 3D porous Ni foam (H-Ni3S2@NC/NF) was controllably synthesized by a one-pot self-templated solvothermal method. Herein, we highlight the self-templated growth of multilayered Ni3S2 with N-doped carbon intercalation at a certain temperature. The unique H-Ni3S2@NC/NF shows enhanced active sites and a modulated electronic structure, which facilitates mass/electron transport. Thereby, the H-Ni3S2@NC outperforms a lower overpotential of 238 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1) than that of binary and ternary metal sulfides, suggesting an excellent mono-metal sulfide as a self-supporting electrode for oxygen evolution reaction.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2				2633-5409		WOS:000651234900001

The development of bifunctional electrocatalyst materials plays a key role in the rapid advancement of these hydrogen-based renewable energy strategies. This work proposes citrate-stabilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR and HER. The capping ligand has a great influence on their resulting electrocatalytic performance. A simple ligand exchange method based on concentration gradients has been optimized. The surface structure of the different ligand-stabilized AuNPs was inferred by lead underpotential deposition (Pb-UPD). Static and dynamic electrochemical studies for both ORR and HER have been performed using different ligand-stabilized AuNPs as electrocatalysts, demonstrating that the citrate ligand confers the best performance. This work suggests that non-doped chemically synthesized AuNPs may be suitable as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in fuel cells and hydrogen production.									34	0	0	0	2	0	34			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000489686400036

Oxidation of cobalt was carried out at 800degreesC and at different partial pressures of oxygen. The oxidation reaction at low partial pressures of oxygen can be described by a linear rate law during the initial stages of oxidation followed by parabolic behavior. The oxide layer in contact with the gas interface exhibits strong texture.

The approach involves a one-step conversion of metal supported on high surface area carbon to the metal phosphide utilising a very simple and scalable synthetic process. We use this approach to produce PdP2 and Pd5P2 particles dispersed on carbon with a particle size of 4.5-5.5 nm by converting a commercially available Pd/C powder. The metal phosphide catalysts were tested for the oxygen reduction, hydrogen oxidation and evolution, and formic acid oxidation reactions. Compared to the unconverted Pd/C material, we find that alloying the P at different levels shifts oxide formation on the Pd to higher potentials, leading to greater stability during cycling studies (20% more ECSA retained, 5k cycles) and in thermal treatment under air. Hydrogen absorption within the PdP2 and Pd5P2 particles is enhanced. The phosphides compare favourably to the most active catalysts reported to date for formic acid oxidation, especially PdP2, and there is a significant decrease in poisoning of the surface compared to Pd alone. The mechanistic changes in the reactions studied are rationalised in terms of increased water activation on the surface phosphorus atoms of the catalyst. One of the catalysts, PdP2/C is tested in a fuel cell as anode and cathode catalyst and shows good performance. (C) 2015 The Authors.

High efficiency of perovskite catalysts often suffers due to instability and poor conductivity issues. Thus, the integration of these perovskite materials with other active catalysts is be of great interest. In this article, a series of new nanocomposites of perovskite-iron oxide with different molar ratios has been developed by hydrothermal method. We have shown that double perovskite calcium copper titanate CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) supported iron oxide (Fe2O3) catalysts exhibit excellent activity as cathode catalyst for oxygen reduction reactions in fuel cells. Three different composites of CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) with Fe2O3 were prepared and the composites were analysed by various structural and microstructural characterization methods, such as XRD and FESEM. Microstructural investigations revealed cubic shaped iron oxide nanoparticles decorated over CCTO particles. Electrochemical analysis showed that the performance of composites improved drastically with increase in the amount of CCTO. Kinetic studies by rotating ring disc electrode method revealed that the composites exhibit four electron pathway for oxygen reduction reaction and generate hydrogen peroxide as an intermediate. This work demonstrates a new type of efficient metal oxide-perovskite composite for oxygen redution catalysis.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2046-2069			WOS:000385632400061

Extensive characterization using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, low-energy ion scattering, and Raman spectroscopy showed that microcrystalline MoO3 islands were formed on the bismuth tungstate surface that grew in height and lateral dimension with increasing loading.

Illumination of an FTO-In2S3-laccase electrode yields O-2 production at much lower applied potential in comparison to the previous example using the same laccase, where only electric energy was applied. The present system allows a diversification of the energy applied to accomplish the water splitting, taking a portion of it from the sun.

It serves as a model to split water by sunlight. Reports on the mechanism and structure of photosystem II provide a more detailed architecture of the oxygen evolving complex and the surrounding amino acids. One challenge in this field is the development of artificial model compounds to study oxygen evolution reaction outside the complicated environment of the enzyme. Calcium-manganese oxides as structural and functional models for the active site of photosystem II are explained and reviewed in this paper. Because of related structures of these calcium-manganese oxides and the catalytic centers of active site of the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II, the study may help to understand more about mechanism of oxygen evolution by the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II.

It consists of two half reactions: anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Developing electrocatalysts is an effective way to improve the efficiency of water splitting. Two-dimensional layered double hydroxides (LDHs), as abundant, cheap and bifunctional catalysts, have the similar electrocatalytic performance as precious metals, thereby receiving pretty much attention. Here, a facile flash nano-precipitation (FNP) synthetic strategy is presented to acquire NiFe LDH. Based on it, La-NiFe LDH is obtained by adding rare earth element lanthanum (La) with different contents using mechanical method. Owing to the synergistic effect between La and laminate metal, La-NiFe LDH shows an excellent water splitting performance, where the overpotential of OER activity is 340 mV and HER performance is 57 mV at the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) . Combined with characterization, performance and theoretical calculation, it is confirmed that the electronic structure of LDH laminates can be adjusted by La doping, reducing the Gibbs free energy in the reaction accordingly, which is beneficial to the water splitting reaction. In general, an easy-to-implement and rapid preparation method provides a convenient and green way to obtain water splitting catalyst with enhanced performance. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

From the exploration of 3D -transition metal based heterostructures, engineering at the nano-level brought more enhancements in active sites with reduced overpotentials for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, recent developments in 3D transition metal based heterostructures like direct growth on external substrates (Ni foam, Cu foam) gave highly impressive activities and stabilities. Research needs to be focused on how the active sites can be enhanced further with 3D heterostructures of transition metals by studying them with various counterparts like hydroxides, layered double hydroxides and phosphides for empowering both OER and HER applications. This perspective covers the way to enlarge the utilization of 3D heterostructures successfully in terms of reduced overpotentials, highly exposed active sites, increased electrical conductivity, porosity and high-rate activity. From the various approaches of growth of transition metal based 3D heterostructures, it is easy to fine tune the active sites to have a viable production of hydrogen with less applied energy input. Overall, this perspective outlines a direction to increase the number of active sites on 3D transition metal based heterostructures by growing on 3D foams for enhanced water splitting applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000694665900001	34617532

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as anodic reaction determines the overall efficiency of water electrolysis due to sluggish OER kinetics. Thus, it' s much desirable to explore the efficient and earth-abundant transition-metal-based OER electrocatalysts with high current density and superior stability for industrial alkaline electrolyzers. Herein, we demonstrate a significant enhancement of OER kinetics with the hybrid electrocatalyst arrays in alkaline via judiciously combining earth-abundant and ultrathin NiCo-based layered double hydroxide (NiCo LDH) nanosheets with nickel cobalt sulfides (NiCoS) with a facile metal-organic framework (MOF)-template-involved surface sulfidation process. The obtained NiCo LDH/NiCoS hybrid arrays exhibits an extremely low OER overpotential of 308 mV at 100 mA.cm(-2), 378 mV at 200 mA-cm(-2) and 472 mV at 400 mAcm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution, respectively. A much low Tafel slope of 48 mV.dec I can be achieved. Meanwhile, with the current density from 50 to 250 mA.cm(-2), the NiCo-LDH/NiCoS hybrid arrays can run for 25 h without any degradation. Our results demonstrate that the construction of hybrid arrays with abundant interfaces of NiCo LDH/NiCoS can facilitate OER kinetics via possible modulation of binding energy of O-containing intermediates in alkaline media. The present work would pave the way for the development of low-cost and efficient OER catalysts and industrial application of water alkaline electrolyzers.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000767033800007

In this work, nanocrystalline Ni5P4 is prepared as a pre-catalyst for the OER to gain insight into the in situ surface activation. We find that NiO nanosheets with abundant crystal defects are formed on the surfaces of Ni5P4 particles during the electrochemical process. The effects of the in situ P incorporation in surface reconstruction derived NiO for OER electrocatalysis are discussed. Theoretical calculations reveal that the heteroatom P substitution for O atoms of NiO crystals on the subsurface can weaken the binding strength of the OER intermediates, change the potential-determining step of the OER and achieve a lower theoretical overpotential. The present work provides a novel mechanism of the enhanced electrocatalytic performances of non-oxide materials for OER electrocatalysis by highlighting the effects of surface reconstruction induced in situ heteroatom doping in derived active materials.									21	1	0	0	3	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000631985900044

In the presence of DES, the reaction occurred at a lower temperature (500 degrees C) compared with that of the respective conventional solid-state synthesis of metal oxides and also with the calcination process involving the metal salts, thereby decreasing the overall formation energy. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed a 2-fold decrease in the endo effect of the thermodestruction of DES, which was observed at a low temperature. The structural pathway taken during the phase and morphology formation was investigated by in situ and ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The in situ XRD results confirmed the presence of high-temperature alpha-CoV2O6, which was finally converted to alpha-CoV2O6. On account of the metal speciation in DES similar to the biotemplate, well-defined octahedral CoV2O6 nanocrystals were obtained, which exhibited a remarkable OER catalytic activity at current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with an overpotential of a mere 324 mV, with excellent durability for greater than 24 h. Thus, a designer DES solvent with characteristics of biodegradability, cost-effectiveness, and renewability demonstrates potential for the synthesis of noble-metal-free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, which allows the present synthesis route to fit well within the merits of green chemistry.									37	1	0	0	1	0	38			2168-0485			WOS:000452344900040

Recently, layered double hydroxide (LDH)-based materials have gained increasing attentions as promising electrocatalysts for water splitting. Designing LDHs into hierarchical architectures (e.g., core-shell nanoarrays) is one of the most promising strategies to improve their electrocatalytic performances, owing to the abundant exposure of active sites. This review mainly focuses on recent progress on the synthesis of hierarchical LDH-based core-shell nanoarrays as high performance electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting. By classifying different nanostructured materials combined with LDHs, a number of LDH-based core-shell nanoarrays have been developed and their synthesis strategies, structural characters and electrochemical performances are rationally described. Moreover, further developments and challenges in developing promising electrocatalysts based on hierarchical nanostructured LDHs are covered from the viewpoint of fundamental research and practical applications.									23	8	0	0	0	0	25			2095-0179	2095-0187		WOS:000445220700023

The investigated samples were designed as electrodes for the electrochemical water oxidation process to produce clean energy in a half-cell fabrication. An excellent electrochemical water oxidation was demonstrated by La2Mo2O7 at pH7, which showed an outstanding 241 +/- 1 mA/g current density with very low (197 mV) overpotential. This is a quite good output obtained from such binary metal oxides. Furthermore, lower Tafel slope (59 mV/ dec) was observed for the same candidate along with early oxygen evolution reaction (OER) because of ion migrations. Interestingly, 99% activity retention was evidenced for the optimized candidate over 16 h in a half-cell design. The findings of this study may generate great interest among young researchers in developing novel bimetal oxides for robust and sustainable water electrolysis to produce clean energy.

Because of their high surface area and adjustable pore structure, metal-organic framework (MOF)based catalysts represent a promising alternative. During the OER in alkaline media, the initial MOF structure is susceptible to transformations including the decomposition of the organic backbone and/or the formation of oxide, hydroxide and oxyhydroxide intermediates. Hence, operando characterizations of MOF catalysts during OER are essential to understand the material's progressive changes and extract the OER catalytic mechanism. This article discusses existing operando Xray absorption spectroscopy studies of MOF(-derived) catalysts during OER and extracts important parameters for future research regarding operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy characterizations of MOFs during alkaline electrolysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2451-9103			WOS:000707501700002

We compare the results at the vacuum interface with the commonly used computational hydrogen electrode method, finding overall good agreement. The effect of the solvent is found to be twofold. First, the explicit treatment of the solvent can lead to equilibrium configurations differing from the relaxed structures without solvent. Second, the overpotentials can be affected by up to 0.5 eV. The energetics are subject to electrostatic effects at the interface rather than to modifications in the hydrogen bond network. These results provide a promising perspective on the of implicit models for treating the solvent.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000479326300037

In particular, high-efficiency oxygen catalysts are very important for the design of practical Li-O-2 batteries. Herein, we have synthesized heterogeneous crystalline-coated partially crystalline bimetallic organic coordination polymers (PC@C-BMOCPs), which are further pyrolyzed to obtain Co- and Fe-based nanoparticles embedded within rodlike N-doped carbon (Co/Fe@NC) as a bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) catalyst used in the Li-O-2 battery. Owing to excellent ORR/OER catalytic ability, the Co/Fe@NC bifunctional catalyst exhibits an efficient reversible reaction between O-2 and Li2O2. Additionally, a large number of mesoporous channels are present in the core-shell Co/Fe@NC nanoparticles. These channels not only promote the diffusion of Li+ and O-2, but also create ample room to store insoluble discharge product Li2O2. The Li-O-2 batteries utilizing the bifunctional Co/Fe@NC oxygen electrode exhibit a large capacity of 17,326 mAh g(-1), a long cycling life of more than 250 cycles, and excellent reversibility.

Therefore, introducing dynamically stable active sites in an alternative structure is urgent but challenging. Here, 1D 5H-polytype Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14-delta oxide with face-sharing motifs is identified as a highly active and stable candidate for alkaline OER. Benefiting from the stable face-sharing motifs with three couples of combined bonds, Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14-delta can maintain its local structures even under high OER potentials as evidenced by fast operando spectroscopy, contributing to a negligible performance degradation over 110 h. Besides, the higher Co valence and smaller orbital bandgap in Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14-delta endow it with a much better electron transport ability than its corner-sharing counterpart, leading to a distinctly reduced overpotential of 308 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 m KOH. Further mechanism studies show that the short distance between lattice-oxygen sites in face-sharing Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14-delta can accelerate the deprotonation step (*OOH + OH- = *OO + H2O + e(-)) via a steric inductive effect to promote lattice-oxygen participation. In this work, not only is a new 1D face-sharing oxide with impressive OER performance discovered, but also a rational design of dynamic stable and active sites for sustainable energy systems is inaugurated.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000688529200001	34436805

The HDFT method can reproduce the CCSD(T) results, in agreement with the experimental ones. The nature of the manganese-oxygen bonds in the Mn(VI)-O, Mn(IV)-O porphyrin (PP), and Mn(V)-O PP systems are examined in relation to possible mechanisms of oxygen evolution from H2O2 and H2O in native and non-native manganese complexes. It is found that the radical character of the high-valent (PP)Mn(V)-O bond is remarkable, showing the strong potential to generate molecular oxygen because of its high reactivity. The electronic structure and magnetic property of mu-oxo-bridged manganese porphyrin dimer (PPMn(III)OMn(III)PP) are investigated for further discussion of structure and reactivity of PPMn(X)O (X = II-IV). The potential curve for release of molecular oxygen from PPMn(II)O-2 is also examined to show weak affinity of O-2 in the Mn complex where the oxidation number (X) of Mn is low. Implications of the computational results are also discussed in relation to oxygen evolution reactions.

Here it is shown that an efficient OER catalytic substrate can be developed by roll-to-roll fabrication of electrodeposited Ni-Fe foils, followed by anodization. An amorphous oxyhydroxide layer directly formed on Ni-Fe foils exhibits high catalytic activity toward water oxidation in 1 m KOH solution, which requires an overpotential of 0.251 V to reach current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The developed catalytic electrode shows the best OER activity among catalysts with film structure. The catalyst also shows prolonged stability at vigorous gas evolution condition for 36 h. To demonstrate the monolithic photoassisted water splitting device, an amorphous silicon solar cell is fabricated on Ni-Fe catalytic substrate, resulting in lowering OER overpotential under light illumination. This monolithic device is the first demonstration that the OER catalytic substrates and the solar cells are integrated and can be easily applied for industrial scale solar-driven water electrolysis.									24	0	0	0	1	0	23			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000414918700024

So, development of facile synthesis procedures for ultrathin graphdiyne nanostructures is a challenge. Here, a prompt and simple method is proposed for polycondensation of 1,3,5-triethynylbenezene and synthesis of graphdiyne-like nanosheets, using bipolar electrochemistry assisted by copper grid electrode in the ethanol/acetonitrile solvent. The large scale of graphdiyne can be achieved with a series of bipolar electrodes in a single bipolar cell. The prepared nano sheets are characterized by various techniques, such as SEM, TEM, Raman and XPS. The as prepared material shows a remarkable photocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution (25 mA cm-2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE) as well as oxygen evolution (4.5 mA cm-2 at 1.1 V vs. RHE) activity at low overpotentials. The proposed method promised as a rapid and simple process for synthesis of graphdiyne-like nanostructures with remarkable electrocatalytic activity at less than 150 min. Furthermore, the presented procedure can be developed as applicable method for preparation of other grphdiyne-like nanostructures for fabrication of sensing and biosensing devices, optical imaging and nanoparticles loading.(c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

A quantitative analysis of the product distribution from the oxidative degradation of the C-2 compound, ethylene glycol, is elaborated and a reaction sequence is proposed. The Co-OEC is also found to be competent for oxidatively degrading C2+ compounds, including glucose and lignin, to carbon dioxide at consequential Faradaic efficiencies.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0276-7333	1520-6041		WOS:000462944200003

Here we prepare the nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene/carbon nanotube (NS-GR/CNT) with 3D architecture by one-step hydrothermal method, which presents good performance for OER. The as -prepared NS-GR/CNT exhibits more negative onset potential and lower Tafel slope (0.56 V, 103 mV decade (1) vs. S.C.E. in 0.1 M KOH) compared to single N doped graphene/carbon nanotube (0.65 V, 285 mV decade 1), which indicates S doping can significantly enhance the OER performance. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the thiophene-like S (C-S-C) is the dominant S species in all the S doped samples. NS-GR/CNT with C-S-C content of 0.26% has the Tafel slope of 151 mV decade 1 while the value for NS-GR/CNT with C-S-C content of 1.09% is 103 mV decade (1). The decreased Tafel slope demonstrates the catalytic kinetics are highly correlated with the content of C-S-C. Density functional theory calculations suggest that C-S-C may improve the catalytic kinetics by facilitating the adsorption of the OH intermediate. Besides, the 3D architecture composed of graphene and CNTs also contributes to the good performance and chronoamperometric measurement demonstrates the good durability of NS-GR/CNTs.

Here, we adopt a facile template method to synthesize bimetallic Mn-Fe oxyhydroxides. meso-Mn1Fe1Ox shows a large BET specific surface area of 212.4 m(2) g(-1) and an average pore diameter of 13.1 nm, which favor the exposure of many active sites for the reaction. meso-Mn1Fe1Ox exhibits excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 275 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1), and good long-term stability, and is superior to most Mn-based electrocatalysts. Kinetic studies indicate that Fe and Mn sites should synergistically catalyze the OER. Theoretical calculations reveal that the surface doping of Fe onto MnOOH can moderately destabilize the surface bridge O atoms and promote the generation of surface oxygen vacancies that can act as highly active sites for the OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2052-1553			WOS:000810075000001

OER was studied in 1 M K2CO3 at 50.C using an array of ionomer-silver catalyst inks deposited on Ni foam. Different ionomer modifications were investigated to optimize the OER performance. The AEI used in this work features a block copolymer backbone of polychloromethylstyrene-b-polycyclooctene-b-polychloromethylstyrene which was functionalized with either benzyltrimethylammonium (TMA) or benzylmethylpiperidinium (MPRD) quaternary ammonium cations. Using an MPRD quaternary ammonium cation shifted the rate determining step at high overpotentials, ultimately providing enhanced performance. Increasing the catalyst ink dilution was also found to substantially improve mass activity and catalyst utilization (increase from 35 to 88 A g 1 Ag), likely by reducing the ionomer thickness and decreasing transport resistances. In the final ionomer modification, the Ni foam substrate was leveraged to partially hydrogenate the polycyclooctene midblock to be polyethylene-like at the Ni interface. A significant increase in the electrochemical surface area (Cdl increased from 8.8 to 20.8 mF cm 2) and performance (by 47 mA cm 2 or 29 A g 1 Ag) was observed with the incorporation of polyethylene. Kinetic results from half-cell experiments were validated via single-cell anion exchange membrane electrolysis experiments, where the optimized electrode displayed enhanced performance in both 1 M K2CO3 and DI H2O.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000779067400001

Not only the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution has to be overcome, but also the adsorption of the gas bubble product which significantly contributes towards the energy consumption in water splitting. Here, we report an amorphous iron borate film deposited on nickel foam with significant catalytic activity and surface wettability which enables fast gas bubble dissipation. Through exposing a highly hydrophilic electrocatalyst surface via borate functionalization and the inclusion of Fe active sites, a low-adhesion oxygen evolution electrode with a porous and roughened surface, exhibiting significantly improved mass transfer and outstanding performance compared to unfunctionalized iron and iron hydroxide systems, is prepared. The proposed electrocatalyst shows strong oxygen evolution behavior by delivering current densities of 20 and 100 mA cm(-2) at small overpotentials of 232 and 268 mV in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. The proposed electrode also displays good durability in particular at large current densities where vigorous gas bubble evolution occurs.									29	2	0	0	2	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000473054500028

One of the most significant of these, is the use of these electrodes for water treatment, especially in solutions with low electrical conductivity, and for use in ozone production. The stability of diamond electrodes is discussed. As of now, these electrodes are used in water electrolysers, for disinfection and in electroanalysis.

Herein, tip-welded bimetallic iron-cobalt sulfide nanotube arrays with tunable morphology and composition were fabricated via a template-free method and directly grown on carbon cloth (FeCo2S4 NTA/CC) as a flexible binder-free catalytic electrode. Based on the well-defined hollow nanotube structure, more abundant active sites are exposed, which accelerates the charge transfer process. In addition, the composition of the catalysts also plays an important role in the electrochemical behavior. Benefited from the unique structure and synergistic effect of bimetallic sulfides, the obtained FeCo2S4 NTA/CC exhibits an outstanding electrocatalytic activity toward the OER with an extremely low overpotential of 317 mV to drive a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1), and excellent durability during the alkaline water electrolysis in 1.0 M KOH.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			2168-0485			WOS:000503330400012

Compared to conventional cobalt oxide prepared hydrothermally, this bridged-multi-octahedral NC structure exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic performances towards oxygen evolution and reduction reactions, which is attributed to their preferential exposure of the Co-terminated {111} facets with a low Co coordination number, high electrochemically active surface area, and the reduced charge transfer resistance from the catalytic active sites to the underlying electrode, thus suggesting the tuning of crystal growth for the electrocatalytic enhancement.									18	3	0	0	0	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000399390300021

Both catalysts are bifunctionally active towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline pH. Co-N-C-TET has excellent OER activity and delivers the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at a remarkably low overpotential of 0.28 V. The Co-N-C-Phen catalyst is superior in terms of overall bifunctional activity and durability. The nitrogen and cobalt content of the catalyst controls the overall oxygen electrocatalytic performance. The nitrogen content, and its chemical nature in the catalyst, decides the ORR activity, whereas the metal content of the catalyst regulates the OER activity. Cobalt-rich Co-N-C-TET has significantly high OER activity compared to Co-N-C-Phen. The enhanced OER activity of the Co-N-C-TET catalyst is ascribed to the presence of a high cobalt content. The graphitic-N- and pyridinic-N-rich Co-N-C-Phen catalyst has enhanced ORR activity. An aqueous rechargeable Zn-air battery (ZAB) is fabricated using the Co-N-C-Phen-based air-cathode. The ZAB shows an open-circuit voltage of 1.40 V and power density of 128.2 mW cm(-2)with >48 h of galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling stability. It outperforms the reference ZAB made of Pt and IrO(2)catalysts.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2196-0216			WOS:000548290600021

However, there have been no studies of the effect of fluoride in Ni-based oxides/hydroxides on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as these materials are generally considered inactive for HER. Recently the HER activities of Ni-based oxides/hydroxides have been improved by doping with anions (-P, -S, and -Se). However, these compounds are chemically unstable during HER and can be converted into the corresponding oxides/hydroxides. In this paper we discovered an interesting phenomenon: the NiFe hydroxide can be turned into an active HER material by incorporating fluoride into it. In 1 M KOH, a significant shift of similar to 91 mV was observed in the HER overpotential at -10 mA/cm(2) due to the enhanced charge transfer ability triggered by fluoride. This discovery provides a new approach to turning normally inactive materials, whose catalytic activity is hindered by low intrinsic conductivity, into electrocatalysts, and will lead to the discovery of new catalysts.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000419834400024

Herein, we explored a facile synthesis of NiFe-LDH (layered double hydroxide) grown on Cu3P nano-array by simply solvothermal method. Thanks to the synergistic effect of NiFe-LDH and Cu3P array, the as-synthesized Cu3P@NiFe-LDH/CF exhibited a high electric conductance and a larger double-layer capacitance, which makes it an excellent nonprecious OER catalyst.

The free energies of four proton-coupled electron transfer steps and the OER overpotential were calculated, and the trend in activity was analyzed. For the (100) orientation, two adsorbate-adsorbate distances were studied. Interestingly, a very low overpotential of 0.52 V was found for the (100) surface with a bridge site (adsorbate on a bridge of two Fe atoms) configuration that benefited from adsorbate-adsorbate interactions.									34	2	0	0	3	0	34			1932-7447			WOS:000390735600034

Herein, an electrocatalyst of a Co/MoC-nanoparticles embedded N-doped carbon (Co/MoC@N-C) was prepared via the in-situ encapsulation of Co-2(CO)(8) and Mo(CO)(6) in ZIF-8 using ball-milling, followed by pyrolysis under an Ar atmosphere. When used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, the as-prepared Co/MoC@N-C showed an ORR half-wave potential of 0.824 V in an alkaline medium and an overpotential of only 290 mV for the OER at 10 mA cm(-2), which was 70 mV lower than RuO2. The Co/MoC@N-C was also evaluated as a cathode in a solid-state Zn-air battery and delivered a higher peak discharge power density and better cycling stability (over 1600 min) than Pt/C-RuO2. Most importantly, our work provides a new strategy to prepare bifunctional catalysts and promotes their applications in the energy conversion field.

Various compositions of homogeneously blended Ni-Fe oxide nanoparticles with a primary particle size of around 8 nm were simply prepared by using pore confinement of the tea leaves template. Based on the similar physical properties, including particle size and surface area, for all samples, it was verified that the OER activity in alkali electrolyte was mainly governed by the metal stoichiometry, where a maximum current density was obtained with a Ni/Fe ratio of 32/1. The higher catalytic performance of Ni32Fe oxide was attributed to lower reaction resistance and higher intrinsic activity, which are confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and surface area analysis, respectively. The lowest overpotential (0.291 V-RHE at 10 mA/cm(2)) as well as the highest current density (over 600 mA/cm(2) at 1.7 V-RHE) was achieved with Ni/Fe = 32/1 loaded on nickel foam due to (i) an uniform distribution of Fe into NiO, (ii) a high conductivity, and (iii) an activation of Ni by neighboring Fe under applying bias. The environmentally benign surfactant-free synthetic procedure and the electrocatalytic system consisting of earth-abundant elements only (Fe, Ni, and O) should be attractive for the development of practical and economical energy conversion devices to split water.									47	1	0	0	1	0	47			2574-0962			WOS:000459948900032

In this work, we perform an in-depth study of Nafion ionomer functions in both catalyst inks and catalyst layers (CL) for high-efficiency OER in alkaline media. Based on cyclic voltammetry results, an analysis method is developed to characterize pseudocapacitance and EDL charging capacitance independently. This enables accurate quantification of interfacial charge transport behavior and active sites for OER. Zeta potential measurements confirm that Nafion ionomer serves as a stabilizing and binding agent in catalyst-solvent inks. The data obtained from the half-cell tests in 1 M KOH reveal that increasing ionomer content in CL reduces OER performance due to higher mass transport resistance and less active sites. The sample with I/C = 1/24 (weight ratio of Nafion ionomer to IrOx catalyst) exhibits an approximately 1.7-times higher OER activity than that of I/C = 2/1. Furthermore, the ionomer blocking effect is found to be a common phenomenon, which was observed in a wide range of catalyst loadings and three different catalyst materials. Nevertheless, as demonstrated by Nafion-free samples, the addition of Nafion is indispensable for efficient catalyst utilization. Our study shows that the optimized ionomer content in the CL is 10-30 wt % of catalyst loading. Within this range, Nafion, catalyst particles, and electrolyte solution form efficient interaction, resulting in good connectivity of the charge conduction paths without inhibiting the gas diffusion.									36	1	0	0	4	0	36			2155-5435			WOS:000453491100069

Herein, the doping and vacancy double control strategy for the design of bifunctional catalysts is firstly demonstrated for the significant enhancement of HER/OER catalytic performances by constructing Fe doped-Ni5P4/Fe-doped Ni(OH)2 (Fe-Ni5P4/NiFeOH) hybrid nanosheets with rich oxygen vacancies. The experimental studies and first-principle calculations both prove that the combined effects of Fe doping and oxygen vacancy can easily regulate the electronic structure and accordingly optimize the adsorptions/desorptions of intermediates. The bifunctional Fe-Ni5P4/NiFeOH-350 shows small overpotentials of 197 and 221 mV for HER and OER, respectively, along with a low cell voltage of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm-2 and excellent long-term stability for water splitting.

Highly active nitrogen - doped carbon nanostructures as electrocatalysts for bromine evolution reaction: A combined experimental and DFT study								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				413				1005	1016		10.1016/j.jcat.2022.08.002				SEP 2022	2022	Electrocatalytic bromine evolution reaction (BER) is significant for bromine production, energy storage, and wastewater treatment applications. Previously reported electrocatalysts for BER either include unsta-ble graphite anodes or precious metal-containing materials. To overcome their disadvantages, this work has proposed, for the first time, the use of nitrogen-doped carbon nanostructures (CNx) as anode catalysts for BER in acidic medium. In terms of BER activity, CNx outperforms both Vulcan Carbon and commercial 10 % Pt/C at bromide concentration as low as 0.025 M. CNx also exhibits high BER selectivity and remark-able stability at highly oxidizing potentials. Tafel slope was measured to be ti 120 mV/dec supporting a first electron transfer limiting step for BER on CNx. The high activity and stability of CNx is attributed to several nitrogen-doped carbon sites in its graphitic matrix, which have been examined using DFT. The inclusion of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates is critical to identify BER active sites accu-rately, as the most active sites (zigzag pyridinic, zigzag oxide, and pyrrolic oxide) proceed via a OH* -mediated Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. For these sites, DFT predicts that the potential determining step is the first electron transfer to form Br* in agreement with the experimental Tafel slope. Comparison to post-reaction XPS shows good agreement between DFT predicted Br* structures. This work thus provides a direction for the rational design of CNx electrocatalysts for BER.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

A comprehensive understanding of the hydrogen reaction kinetics and mechanisms is critical for the catalyst design and development. Especially pH-dependent hydrogen evolution and oxidation reaction (HER/HOR) kinetics receives increasing interest, and understanding its origin adds new knowledge to fundamental hydrogen electrocatalysis. Here, a detailed description of kinetic analysis and reaction mechanisms for HER/HOR, and a brief summary about recent development of highly efficient and cost-effective hydrogen electrocatalysts are presented. Lastly, recent advances in the fundamental understanding of pH-dependent hydrogen electrocatalysis are discussed.									232	22	0	0	12	0	236			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000484129400010	30932265

This approach effectively reduced the synthesis temperature of phase-pure pyrochlore catalysts from 1000 degrees C to 550 degrees C, and greatly suppressed the sintering of catalyst particles. The supported nanocrystalline Y2Ru2O7-delta catalysts showed enhanced activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic electrolyte and were stable at 1.50 V for the comparative study (>20 h) under the current density of 10 mA/cm(geo)(2) in chronopotentiometry testing. This is equivalent to an overpotential value of 270 mV, about half of that of the reference IrO2 catalyst. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed that the high-surface-area Y2Ru2O7-delta catalyst had an oxygen-deficient structure. This study provides a route to the synthesis of fine ceramic (or oxide)-based electrocatalysts for making high-performing electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2199-692X			WOS:000526687100001

Motivated by a recent discovery that sub-nanometer PdMo bimetallenes can realize exceptional performance in the oxygen reduction reaction [Nature2019,574, 81-85], we explore the potential of 2D bimetallenes for catalyzing the CO(2)electroreduction reaction (CO2RR). Following extensive first-principles calculations on more than a hundred bimetallenes, we identify 17 Cu- and Ag-based bimetallenes, which are highly active and selective toward the formation of formic acid and simultaneously suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Equally important, we find that CO2RR productsviaintermediates of COOH and CO are disfavored on these bimetallenes. Although surface strains are developed on the bimetallenes, their contribution to the catalytic activities is moderate as compared to that of the alloying effect. This work opens the door to future applications of bimetallenes as active and selective catalysts for the CO2RR.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000544719500023

Extensive characterization reveals that the calcination step leads to agglomerates with a metallic core that is encapsulated by the mixed RuxIr1-xO2 oxides. In the composition range of 21 up to 74 mol % ruthenium, the metal core reveals a miscibility gap with an Ir-rich fcc structure and a Ru-enriched hcp structure. Quite in contrast, the mixed oxide particles form a well-defined RuxIr1-xO2 solid solution throughout the entire composition range. Catalytic activity tests of the mixed RuxIr1-xO2 oxide catalysts are conducted with the prototypical CO oxidation reaction under oxidizing and under both stoichiometric reaction conditions; note that the metallic core is buried and does therefore not contribute to the activity. The least active catalyst is pure IrO2. At moderate reaction temperatures above 100 degrees C, the most active oxidation catalyst is identified with the Ir0.125Ru0.875O2 mixed oxide. All mixed RuxIr1-xO2 oxide catalysts are bulk-stable under the reaction conditions considered. However, upon CO oxidation reaction, the Ir4+ concentration at the mixed oxide surface is significantly enhanced with respect to its bulk composition. This information may be important for other catalytic oxidation reactions as well, such as the anodic oxygen evolution reaction in the electrocatalytic water splitting.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000566481000028

A dedicated electrochemical cell was prepared for this study. As a model experiment, an electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was observed in alkaline solution (0.1M NaOH) on the surface of a Pt thin film working electrode. With positive potential shift, the XAS signal at K-edge of oxygen, whose peak position is close to that of gas-phase O-2, increased in correlation with the electrode potential.

The introducing step is carried out by reducing volume flow rate of oxygen during feeding and replenishing reduced oxygen flow with inert gas in amount so that integrity of jet flow and its penetration into melt is unchanged. USE - The method is useful for melting and refining molten steel. ADVANTAGE - The method: utilizes a mixed gas blowing technique that makes it possible to add iron oxide units during the blow without affecting optimum performance of the BOF; avoids high carbon monoxide contents in the off-gas and/or high bonnet pressures to maintain the designed integrity of the jet stream assuring that penetration of the gas jet into the bath and bath turbulence are not reduced, and thus avoids the problems of reduced melting rate, reduced reaction with iron oxides and increased iron oxide in the slag resulting from conventional methods of simply turning down the oxygen flow during pellet feeding; and utilizes low cost iron oxide containing material which reduces the need for higher cost scrap additions and dependence on hot metal from the blast furnace while still maintaining the productive capacity of the vessel, and thus enhances the flexibility of the BOF process, produces hot metal as repeatedly and economically, and improves the operator's ability to control chemistry and produce higher quality heats of steel.															0						DIIDW:2013B47508

The CCPC film formation is surface process in which the dissolution of hydroxyapatite and the deposition of CCPC film concurrently occur on the electrode surface without the mass transfer of phosphate ions into the bulk solution. Elemental, crystallographic, and morphological analyses (EDX, ICP-AES, XPS, and XRD) indicate that the CCPC is composed of amorphous cobalt oxide with calcium and phosphate. The film exhibits durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic properties under neutral and basic aqueous condition.

The Pd decoration yields a higher specific surface area as loading concentration increases and leads to the formation of more porous active sites for efficient activity. Both aqueous and organic media are used to study the electrocatalytic activity of the prepared Pd-LSC composite. In aqueous media, the Pd-LSC materials exhibit higher ORR and OER activities than native LSC and RuO2. For example, as Pd loading increases in aqueous media (5 < 10 < 20 < 30 wt.%), the performance improves and becomes comparable to the that of a conventional Pt/C catalyst, whereas 20 wt.% loading establishes better OER activity. This interesting result in aqueous media logically alerts us to study the electrocatalytic activity in organic medium toward Li-O-2 battery application. Similar to the aqueous media, the Pd-LSC composite outperformed the native materials, like LSC and ketjen black. More specifically, 30 wt.% loading delivers the highest discharge capacity and longest cycle life compared to the other compositions.

J	Sullivan, Mark M.; Bhan, Aditya					Sullivan, Mark/0000-0002-1765-4129			Effects of oxygen coverage on rates and selectivity of propane-CO2 reactions on molybdenum carbide								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				357				195	205		10.1016/j.jcat.2017.11.004				JAN 2018	2018	Mo2C catalyzes propane dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis at 823 K; carbon selectivity can be tuned to >95% propylene via dehydrogenation in absence of H-2, >95% CH4 via hydrogenolysis with H-2 co-feed, or >80% CO via reforming pathways with H-2 and CO2 co-feed. The changes in selectivity are mediated by an evolution in the coverage of oxidized (O*) and carbidic (*) surface sites which results in an evolution of O*-O*, O*-*, and *-* site pairs that catalyze propane dehydrogenation. The fraction of O* in relation to * was assessed from measured CO2/CO ratios because reverse water gas shift equilibrium exists under H-2/CO2 co-feed steady state reaction conditions. Kinetic models based on the two-site dehydrogenation mechanism could be used to quantitatively describe measured rates of propane dehydrogenation at steady state with or without H-2 and/or CO2 co-feed and the transient evolution in dehydrogenation rates upon removing H-2 or CO2 in the influent stream to note that O*-* site pairs exhibit the highest rate per gram. This model also provides a rationale for O* inhibition of H-activated hydrogenolysis pathways and for promotion of oxidative dehydrogenation rates with the introduction of hydrogen into CO2-propane influent streams. This study extends concepts developed for examining the catalytic effects of O* coverage on oxidative light alkane conversion from transition metal catalysts to also include carbidic formulations.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results reveal that the morphology, hollow and spinel structures of the cobalt ferrites remain unchanged with doping. The electrocatalytic activity of the Ni-doped CoFe2O4 with different doping contents has been studied and compared with the pure CoFe2O4 hollow nanospheres in alkaline solution by using rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. For ORR, the Ni0.5Co0.5Fe2O4 (x = 0.5) exhibits as the most active catalyst with the highest diffusion limited current density and more positive onset potential. Whereas, the Ni0.75Co0.25Fe2O4 (x = 0.75) shows the best catalytic activity for OER with more negative onset potential (0.27 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and maximum current density (36.0 mA/cm(2) at 1.0 V). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurements reveal that the oxygen vacancy on the oxide surfaces increases, while the cations occupied ratio on octahedral/tetrahedral sites in spinel structures decreases along with the increasing of the Ni doping content. Combining with the charge transfer resistance measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), these three factors work synergistically on the catalytic activities of the Ni-doped CoFe2O4 hollow nanospheres.

However, the intrinsic OER activities of surfaces with defined crystallographic orientations are not well-established experimentally. Here we report that the (100) surface of IrO2 and RuO2 is more active in alkaline environments (pH 13) than the most thermodynamically stable (110) surface. The OER activity was correlated with the density of coordinatively undersaturated metal sites of each crystallographic facet. The surface-orientation-dependent activities can guide the design of nanoscale catalysts with increased activity for electrolyzers, metal-air batteries, and photoelectrochemical water splitting applications.									380	9	0	0	26	0	380			1948-7185			WOS:000336199000003	26270358

In this work, Barium Titanate Oxygen-deficiency (BTO) (BaTiO3-x) has been synthesized with a sol-gel method followed by a variation of sintering period to discover an effect to the formation of oxygen vacancies related to the optical bandgap. This review is started to proof the formation of barium titanate oxygen-deficiency with TGA and DSC to understand the thermal habit of BTO formation, then using FTIR and Raman to understand any remain organic compound and any kind of configuration BTO formed, and UV-Vis to understand the bandgap of BTO as a function to reduce the activation energy.

Using electrocatalytic acetone to propane hydrogenation (APH) as a model reaction and common commercial Pt/Pt-based materials as catalysts, we found local H+ concentration can significantly influence the adsorption mode of acetone reactant, for example, in vertical or flat mode, and target product selectivity. Electrocatalytic measurement combined with in situ spectroscopic characterizations reveals that the vertically adsorbed acetone is favorable for propane production while the flatly adsorbed mode suppresses the reaction. DFT calculations indicate that the H coverage on catalyst surface plays a decisive role in the adsorption configuration of acetone. The increased local acidity can facilitate the adsorption configuration of acetone from flat to vertical mode and suppress the competing hydrogen evaluation reaction, which consequently enhances the APH selectivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000730661800001	34825452

Moreover, the activity of phosphide catalysts can be further enhanced by the cationic vacancy engineering.Experiments: The self-growth Ni2P nanosheet arrays with abundant cationic vacancy defects (V-Ni2P/NF) has been synthesized via a facile multi-step reaction process involving hydrothermal, phosphorization and acid-etching of Mn which was doped in Ni2P nanosheets as a sacrificial dopant. Furthermore, the experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to evaluate its electrochemical performance.Findings: The chemical and electrocatalytic property of Ni2P were successfully optimized by cationic vacancy engineering and the obtained V-Ni2P/NF catalyst exhibited superior bifunctional catalytic performance for both hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to pristine Ni2P and Mn-doped Ni2P in alkaline electrolyte. The V-Ni2P/NF can afford the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 55 mV for HER and 250 mV for OER. Additionally, the water electrolysis device assembled by the V-Ni2P/NF electrode as both the anode and cathode just requires a small voltage of 1.59 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and shows no obvious attenuation for 50 h.

The g-CN-CNF catalyst shows high catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in half-cell, with low overpotentials and low Tafel slopes. The high activity is attributed to the synergistic effect of abundant active sites and the electrical conductivity following the pyrolysis of g-CN and CNF. As a result, AEMWE with the g-CN-CNF anode, the first application of a carbon-based catalyst, exhibits outstanding performance that is the highest record in the literature for AEMWE using a non-noble metal catalyst. In addition, the performance and durability of Zn-air cells with g-CN-CNF cathode outperform those fabricated with commercial platinum.									43	1	0	0	3	0	43			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000442973700016

Despite nearly a century of research, the factors governing the activity of OER catalysts are not well understood. In this Perspective, we discuss recent advances in understanding the OER in alkaline media for earth-abundant, first-row, transition-metal oxides and (oxy)hydroxides. We argue that the most-relevant structures for study are thermodynamically stable (oxy)hydroxides and not crystalline oxides. We discuss thin-film electrochemical microbalance techniques to accurately quantify intrinsic activity and in situ conductivity measurements to identify materials limited by electronic transport. We highlight the dramatic effect that Fe cations added either intentionally or unintentionally from ubiquitous electrolyte impurities-have on the activity of common OER catalysts. We find new activity trends across the first-row transition metals, opposite of the established ones, and propose a new view of OER on mixed-metal (oxy)hydroxides that illustrates possible design principles and applications.									761	27	0	0	31	0	765			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000365465600002

As an alternative to high-priced materials, carbon offers considerable potential. However, carbon is limited as an electrode material for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), owing to its thermodynamic instability against electrochemical oxidation. In this study, we investigated the electrochemical degradation of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) under the acidic OER environment. Electrochemical oxidation of MWCNTs induces structural changes and the formation of oxygen-containing functional groups on the carbon surface. As a consequence, the electrochemical and physicochemical properties of the MWCNTs are changed during electrochemical oxidation. We carried out electrochemical, microstructural, and spectroscopic analysis to investigate the degradation of MWCNTs. By changing of the electrochemical properties of MWCNTs during the oxidation process, the carbon electrode is initially activated and can then be kinetically stabilized with prolonged oxidation under the OER conditions.									62	6	0	0	5	0	62			2196-0216			WOS:000368364700011

Here, graphene frameworks with heteroatom-doped carbon dots (CDs) are developed via a hydrothermal route followed by pyrolysis. The CDs are rationally prepared with careful selection of heteroatoms, embedded on the substrate to provide enriched active sites. Structural characterizations (e.g., transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) reveal the successful addition of CDs with nitrogen and sulfur species. Especially, a heat-treated N,S codoped sample, NS-CD@gf_a900, exhibits the optimum oxygen electrocatalysis, even closer to noble-metal counterparts, as a result of the effect of active sites of the CDs and the synergistic behavior of N and S. Considering the importance of size and dopants of the material, this approach not only suggests a straightforward preparation route of nanocarbons, but also appoints the utilization of a new class of non-metal species as efficient oxygen electrocatalysts.									51	2	0	0	4	0	51			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000467263300011	30908886

In this work, two alpha-Mn2O3 with different morphologies and crystal facets were successfully prepared by solvothermal method and investigated as ORR/OER bifunctional catalysts for the first time. The results showed that the catalytic performance is affected by the crystal facet of alpha-Mn2O3, and the alpha-Mn2O3-cubic has better bifunctional activity than alpha-Mn2O3-octahedra. As revealed by catalyst characterization, the enhanced activity is originated with the nature of the exposed alpha-Mn2O3 (100) facet. The (100) facet with abundant low-coordinated surface oxygen sites makes the formation of more oxygen vacancies, which can improve the charge transfer and optimize the adsorption energies for intermediates, thereby enhancing the bifunctional activity for ORR/OER. This work high-lights the correlation between OER/ORR activities and exposed crystal planes of alpha-Mn2O3 catalysts and it may deepen the understanding of facetdependent activity of alpha-Mn2O3 and points out a strategy to improve their catalytic activity by crystal facet engineering.

However, the high cost and poor stability of noble metal catalysts for the oxygen redox reactions limit their practical large-scale application. On contrast, low-cost transition metal oxide ( TMO)-based composite materials exhibit considerable bifunctional activity for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution, and excellent stability, which holds great potential over the precious metal-based catalysts. This work briefly introduces the recent advances in TMO-based composites as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for Li-air and Zn-air batteries. After a brief introduction into the research field of air batteries, metal oxides ( including Co-and Mn-based oxides) and polymetallic oxides ( mainly spinel and perovskite types) are reviewed. In consideration of the poor electronic conductivity of metal oxide catalysts, composites including additional conductive materials are also introduced. Finally, challenges and perspectives of bifunctional TMOs are emphasized to stimulate innovations for the future development of practical Li-air and Zn-air batteries.									113	5	0	0	0	0	113				2566-6223		WOS:000477087800006

However, a sluggish anodic reaction, namely oxygen evolution reaction (OER), requires the use of an efficient electrocatalyst for achieving economic hydrogen production. Transition-metal-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are promising electrocatalysts for reducing the overpotential of OER in alkaline electrolyte, which is essential for efficient water electrolysis. Nickel-iron-based LDHs (Ni-Fe LDH) have been regarded as the best OER electrocatalysts under alkaline conditions. Hence, a number of research studies have been conducted on further improving the electrocatalytic performance of Ni-Fe LDH. Although the chemical blending of other transition metals with Ni-Fe-LDH is a simple and reliable strategy to enhance the OER activity of Ni-Fe-LDH, a systematic investigation on designing Ni-Fe-LDH with different additional elements is still lacking. In addition, the design of multi-metallic LDH compound via only experimental method is very costly and time-consuming process. In this study, atomic-scale computational and experimental studies are performed to design OER electrocatalysts including unary, binary, and ternary LDH compounds consisting of Ni, Fe, Al, and Co. Density functional theory calculations predict that Ni-Fe-Co ternary LDH can lead to the lowest overpotential for alkaline OER among various computationally modeled LDH systems. Further, experimental verifications successfully demonstrate the computational prediction wherein Ni-Fe-Co-LDH exhibits superior catalytic performance compared with Ni-Fe-LDH and benchmark IrO2 catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000789564500001

Silver nanoparticles catalyzed oxygen reduction cathode (Ag NPs ORC) is employed to substitute conventional cathode (hydrogen evolution cathode: HEC). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shows that silver nanoparticles ranging from 15 to 50 nm are evenly distributed on the surface of the carbon support. The constant current electrolysis indicates that the cell voltage of Ag NPs ORC electrolysis of Na2CO3 is as low as 1.52 V and correspondingly the electrical energy consumption is saved up to 39.8% as compared to HEC electrolysis at the same current density of 100 mA cm(-2).

Here we investigate thecatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) onsurfaces of the layered Carpy-Galy oxides Sr2Ta2O7and Sr2Nb2O7.Wefind that the (010) surface parallel to the layering shear plane isnot relevant for photocatalysis. The (100) surface perpendicular tothis plane, on the other hand, can catalyze the OER, at least forSr2Ta2O7, whereas Sr2Nb2O7is inactive for the OER without acocatalyst, both in agreement with experiment. The OER activity ofSr2Ta2O7(100) is, however, only retained while the surface does not assume a reconstructed stepped structure via Sr dissolutionwhich we predict to be thermodynamically favored. Engineering Sr2Ta2O7into long-lasting photoelectrodes thus has to focus onexposing (100) facets as well as preventing Sr dissolution, for example, via a high Sr concentration in the electrolyte.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000793809600002

Scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that the assynthesized Co(OH)F crystallites consisted of different rhombohedral, octahedral, and decahedral shapes, 0.3-0.5 mu m in size. The desired Co(OH)F catalyst synthesized in this study delivered a lower overpotential of 273 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, with a smaller Tafel slope of only 45 mV dec- 1, compared to other fluoride-containing catalysts because of their unique structural features, higher double-layer capacitance, and rapid charge transfer. Furthermore, a stable potential was maintained for more than 20 h during the chronopotentiometry test at a constant current density of 10 mA cm-2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-577X	1873-4979		WOS:000729372400010

Here we report a platelet graphitic nanofiber-carbon nanotube (PGNF-CNT) hybrid electrocatalyst prepared by chemical vapor deposition. The material is composed of interconnected CNTs and nanofibers consisting of graphitized carbon layers stacked at different angles to the fiber axis with a large number of exposed edges. These unique structural characteristics give the hybrid a high density of active sites, fast electron transfer and a large number of mass transport paths. As a result, the material has an excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER with an overpotential of 0.28V at a current density of 10mAcm(-2), which is much better than those of Ir/C and previously-reported carbonaceous catalysts.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000497229900001

However, the poor bulk charge-separation ability and slow surface oxygen evolution reaction (OER) dynamics of photoelectrodes impede the performance. We construct In- and Zn/In-doped SnS2 nanosheet arrays through a hydrothermal method. The doping induces the simultaneous formation of an amorphous layer, S vacancies, and a gradient energy band. This leads to elevated carrier concentrations, an increased number of surface-reaction sites, accelerated surface-OER kinetics, and an enhanced bulk-carrier separation efficiency with a decreased recombination rate. This efficient doping strategy allows to manipulate the morphology, crystallinity, and band structure of photoelectrodes for an improved PEC performance.									100	4	0	0	5	0	100			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000471977400049	30907040

Herein, we investigated the effect of addition of transition metal complexes with macrocyclic ligands, such as porphyrins and phthalocyanines, for OER in aprotic Li ion electrolytes. Electrochemical experiments using a three-electrode system revealed that such complexes functioned as efficient OER catalysts, in which the center metal in the complex played an essential role in the catalytic process. Among the metal complexes studied, cobalt tert-butylphthalocyanine was found to be the best catalyst: the charging potential was lowered from 4.1 V to about 3.4 V at 1 mu A/cm(2) by addition of 1 mM catalyst									37	1	0	0	4	0	37			1932-7447			WOS:000346321700012

At present, the facile and efficient synthesis of high-quality Au-core noble metal-shell nanowires still maintains the challenge. Herein, we develop a feasible one-pot chemical-reduction strategy to rapidly synthesize high-quality Au@Ir core-shell nanowires (Au@Ir CSNWs) in 1-naphthol ethanol solution and explore their potential application in electrocatalysis. Expermattial results show the formation core-shell structure originates from the deposition-growth of Ir atoms at preferentially generated Au nanowires surface. When using as an electrocatalyst towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, Au@Ir CSNWs show Pt-like ORR electroactivity due to the compositional synergism effect and structural advantages of 1D nanowires, accompanying with excellent durability and extremely enhanced methanol tolerance towards ORR.									19	0	0	0	3	0	18			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664129700002

Electrochemical properties such as the electrochemical surface area (ECSA), ORR, mass activity specific activity, as well as the durability of the electrocatalyst is evaluated. ESCA is determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in 1 M KOH at 30 degrees C, using scanning rates of 5-100 mV s(-1). The active CO3+ present in the surface of the (CuCoO)(x) lattice acts as a donor-acceptor in the reduction sites during the ORR. The oxygen reduction activity for (CuCoO) x catalysts is evaluated at various rotation rate in the range 400-3000 rpm. The data are analysed using the Koutecky-Levich relationship; parallel lines indicate first-order kinetics. The number of electrons transfer favours a 4(e)(-) pathway oxygen reduction process, the rate constant of the reaction is in the range 0.07-0.11 mol L-1 s(-1) at CL 0.05 mg cm(-2).									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1452-3981			WOS:000384908100056

Despite this fact there appears to be little published work on the optimisation of the anode material for this application. Although titanium coated with iridium dioxide is widely used for its long lifetime under oxygen evolution conditions, it appears that not consideration has been given to the effect of this oxide on other electroplating parameters, for example the oxidation of additives, pulse plating etc.This paper reviews the materials that have been employed as insoluble anodes in acid sulphate electrolytes including those used for electrodeposition, electrowinning operations, and other electrochemical processes. In considers the factors that affect the materials performance under oxygen evolving condition sand collates values from the literature for the oxygen evolution potential and Tafel slopes for this reaction that have been obtained for various metal oxides.From these data, a set of criteria lis established which an insoluble anode material should meet if it is to be successfully employed in an acid copper horizontal electroplating machine.									14	0	0	0	1	0	15			0020-2967	1745-9192		WOS:000169518400017

Although some progress has been made in the synthesis of transition-metal selenide nanostructures, the preparation of metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived transition-metal selenide electrode materials with more active sites and nanosheet structures remains a significant challenge. Herein, on the basis of the MOFs, the hierarchical CoSe2-160 microcube with sheetlike nanoarchitectures was successfully prepared. In addition, the morphology of cobalt selenides was controlled by adjusting the hydrothermal reaction temperature. Electrochemical experiments show that the CoSe2-160 microcube has a splendid electrocatalytic performance with 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 156 mV and a small Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1) (in 0.5 M H2SO4) for hydrogen evolution reaction as well as 328 mV and a small Tafel slope of 73 mV dec(-1) (in 1 M KOH) for oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. This arises from the nanosheet structures, large surface areas, and abundant active sites. This strategy provides a neoteric synthesis route for the MOF-derived transition-metal selenides with a striking electrocatalytic performance.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000570979900096	32838527

Herein, we prepared the oxidized graphene aerogel supported cubic manganese carbonate composites (GO(x)/MnCO3) with different GO and MnCO3 ratio through a simple co-precipitation/in-situ coating method. The GO(x)/MnCO3 composites, with uniformly wrapping of GO on the surface of MnCO3 cubic, display high conductivity and abundant catalytic sites for 2-electron ORR. The G(0.2)M shows the best ORR catalytic performance, onset potential of 0.635 VRHE, high H2O2 production selectivity and high stability in 3.5% NaCl electrolyte. Based on this, G(0.2)M as oxygen reduction electrocatalyst, has good antibacterial effect at 0.55 VRHE on the stainless-steel. The antibacterial mechanism is mainly due to the electrocatalytic oxygen reaction of H2O2 and the side reaction of center dot OH and O-2(center dot-). This provides an impressive, effective and environmentally friendly electrochemical approach for antibacterial and antifouling applications.

Structural and voltammetric analysis of the intersecting composition series LaSrNi1-yFeyO4+delta and La2-xSrxNi0.7Fe0.3O4+delta show that tuning different cation sites uniquely affects structure and behavior. Correlations between X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy results reveal that structural changes in the a-b plane are uniformly matched by the c-axis following La-Sr exchange, while Ni-Fe exchange distorts the structure by expanding the crystal c-axis and generating oxygen defects with a distinct signature in Raman spectra. Correlations between rotating ring-disk electrode voltammetry results and structural parameters show that only Fe substitution has a direct effect on the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction. We link systematic changes observed for onset of electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction, Tafel slope, and selectivity to distortions in the B-site environments. This analysis demonstrates that correlational analysis linking electrochemical behavior parameters to multiple structural characterization techniques is an effective means to probe the effect of individual compositional substitution on electrocatalytic behavior.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000763261000001

Herein, a new RuO2-based composite catalyst Co-Ru-Py@500 has been designed with abundant pore spaces formed by the stacking of nanoparticles, where the nanoparticle comprises CoOx/RuO(2 )hybrid species and an encased carbon layer involving holey space. The CoRu-Py@500 possesses a relatively large specific surface area and a higher proportion of hydroxyl species than Ru-Py@500 without the introduction of CoO(x )species. The catalyst Co-Ru-Py@500 shows a smaller onset potential of 1.39 V vs. RHE and overpotential (230 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) than Ru-Py@500, and significantly favorable tafel slope, electrochemical impedance. In addition, the Fe-Ru-Py@500 and Ni-Ru-Py@500 introduced with FeOx or NiOx species are still inferior to Co-Ru-Py@500, but both of them show a better OER activity than Ru-Py@500. Through introducing Co, Fe, and Ni oxidation state species, the catalytic activity of RuO2 can be promoted to varying degrees. The design strategy in this work provides a significant guidance for the rational design of efficient OER catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000780330700006

In contrast to noble-metal catalysts, heteroatom-doped carbons have recently emerged as new-generation electrocatalysts because of their low cost and high stability/activity. Although unique features of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) including high surface areas, adjustable apertures, and easy introduction of diverse heteroatoms render them promising precursors for heteroatom-doped carbons, development of electrocatalysts derived from COFs with simultaneously high activities of ORR/HER is still at an early stage. Here, we report the creation of metal-free heteroatom-doped carbon catalysts derived from four types of newly designed nanoporous two-dimensional COFs with ordered pores smaller than 1 nm. Both preincorporated N in the pristine COFs and postdoped P heteroatoms are uniformly distributed into the graphitized carbons and functioning as effective active sites for electrocatalysis. Furthermore, the obtained heteroatom (N, P) codoped carbons possess nanoporosity beneficial for efficient introduction of reactants. Therefore, the N, P codoped nanoporous carbons demonstrate robust electrochemical performances for both ORR and HER with a half-wave potential of 0.81 V in alkaline medium and low overpotential of 260 mV in acid solutions. In addition, their catalytic activities are not changed after a long-time cycle. These findings will promote creation of robust COF-derived carbon catalysts in energy storage and conversion as well as development of new COFs with tunable nanopores.									21	2	0	0	1	0	21			2574-0970			WOS:000545689000057

Herein, hydrothermally synthesized Ti3+ self-doped TiO2, labeled as Ti3+/TiO2, was first used as a light absorber in a powder visible light-driven photocatalytic water oxidation reaction. When an iron-containing polyoxometalate Na-27[Fe-11(H2O)(14)(OH)(2)(W3O10)(2)(alpha-SbW9O33)(6)] (Fe11) was used as a cocatalyst, an amorphous layer of active species was wrapped outside the initial Ti3+/TiO2 nanorod and the in situ formed composite was labeled as F/Ti3+/TiO2. When the composite F/Ti3+/TiO2 was tested as a photocatalytic water oxidation catalyst, dramatically improved oxygen evolution performance was achieved. The composite F/Ti3+/TiO2 showed an oxygen evolution rate of 410 mu mol/g/h, which was about 11-fold higher than that of prism Ti3+/TiO2. After 24 h of illumination, an O-2 yield of 36.4% was achieved. The contrast experiments, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization demonstrated that FeOx is the true cocatalyst that enhanced the oxygen evolution activity of TiO2. A recycling experiment proved that the composite F/Ti3+/TiO2 has favorable stability in the oxygen production process.									21	0	0	0	2	0	19			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000474670100025	31252488

Moreover, metallic oxides are emerging for their unique potential for electrocatalysis. Herein, we report the synthesis of N-CDs for the selective detection of Fe3+ with a limit of detection of 2.57 mu M in the range of 5-60 mu M using ethylenediamine and H2O2 by a hydrothermal method. The obtained N-CDs displayed a spherical morphology with a particle size range of 2-7 nm and emitted blue luminescence at 394 nm under excitation at 319 nm. Meanwhile, we have demonstrated the fabrication of cost-efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium, employing N-CDs. Owing to the successful incorporation of N-CDs into NiO nanospheres, the resulting N-CDs/NiO with large surface areas, fast charge transfer, and increased conductivity vastly improved the catalytic activity. Remarkably, the optimal of N-CDs/NiO composite requires the overpotential of only 380 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a relatively low Tafel slope of 57.96 mV dec(-1) compared with pure NiO. These results open up a facile route for the application of N-CDs and offer prospects for CD-metal hybrids as high OER catalysts in electrochemical energy devices.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1976-4251	2233-4998		WOS:000648376100001

However, the use of precious metals as anode catalysts increases the cell stack price and hinders the practical implementation. Therefore, MnO2 has been introduced as a catalytic support material to maximize the utilization of precious metals at a given loading. However, their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities remain unsatisfactory owing to lack of precise structural control. Here, Ru and F incorporation successfully modulates the electronic structure of MnO2 for application to proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Optimization of the synthesis conditions produced a (Mn0.94Ru0.06)O-2:2.5F catalyst, which showed a high mass activity. X-ray spectroscopic and electrochemical characterizations revealed that the OER activity increased with the Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio and oxygen vacancies. In addition, practical applicability was demonstrated by applying (Mn0.94Ru0.06)O-2:2.5F as the anode catalyst in a PEMWE cell.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000863201400001

In this study, we have employed rigid epitaxial, flexible freestanding, and van der Waals La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (LSMO) to investigate the strain effects on OER, which are different in stress strength and range via lattice mismatch and curvature change. It was found that the OER performances as a function of strain exhibited volcano and monotonous trends in rigid and flexible LSMO, respectively. The findings suggest that distinguished oxygen activation energy in varied lattice fields also plays a crucial role in the epitaxial LSMO in contrast to the pure strain effect in the flexible LSMO. Our results not only fundamentally clarify the effort of strain but also technologically provide an effective route to engineer the electronic structure for modified OER performance by perovskite complex oxides.									2	0	0	0	0	0	1			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000844036700001	35976127

In this work, a pyrolysis-free strategy is put forward to fabricate a series of atomically dispersed catalysts by simply immersing the covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) into solutions of various transition metal salts. Electrochemical measurements verify that, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), atomic cobalt is the champion transition metal center (overpotential is 420 mV) to boost the OER activity of CTFs compared to atomic nickel, iron, and copper. Furthermore, the Comodified CTFs exhibit slightly enhanced activity when the potential is fixed at 1.7 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) for 90 000 s, suggesting its superior stability. Theoretical calculations reveal that incorporation of cobalt into CTFs is most conducive to the adsorption of oxygen intermediates and requires the lowest limiting energy barrier for the rate-determining step, thus giving rise to high intrinsic activity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000819217500001

In this work, Fe3N nanoparticles encapsulated into N-doped graphene nanoshells (Fe3N@NG) as OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media were reported. Both the experimental and theoretical comparison between Fe3N@NG and Fe3N/NG, specifically including in situ Mossbauer analyses, demonstrated that the NG nanoshells improved interfacial electron transfer process from Fe3N to NG to form high-valence Fe4+ ions (Fe-4(+)@NG), thus modifying electronic properties of the outer NG shells and subsequently electron transfer from oxygen intermediate to NG nanoshells for OER catalytic process. Meanwhile, the NG nanoshells also protected Fe-based cores from forming OER inactive and insulated Fe2O3, leading to high OER stability. As a result, the as-formed Fe4+@NG shows one of the highest electrocatalytic efficiency among reported Fe-based OER electrocatalysts, which can as well highly improve the photoelectrochemical water oxidation when used as the cocatalysts for the Fe2O3 nanoarray photoanode.

Herein, we report a solvent substitution strategy to prepare the iron-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (Fe-NDC) coordination complex. Through the crystalline state transformation of Fe-NDC from the crystalline to the amorphous phase, the catalytic performance of the prepared catalyst for OER at high current density can be significantly improved under alkaline conditions. Profiting from exposed metal active sites and expanded electron transport channels, amorphous-phase Fe-NDC (AP-Fe-NDC) exhibits stable electrocatalytic activity, with 225 and 333 mV overpotentials at 10 and 500 mA/cm(2), respectively. Moreover, AP-Fe-NDC displays high oxygen yield and faraday efficiency. This rapid and facile strategy will be of immediate benefit to guide the preparation of other high-performance and low-cost OER catalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The rational design of multicomponent materials with seamless interfaces having robust stability, facile scalability, and low-cost electrocatalysts is a grand challenge to produce hydrogen by water electrolysis. Herein, we report a superhydrophilic homogeneous bimetallic phosphide of Ni2P-CuP2 on Ni-foam-graphene-carbon nanotubes (CNTs) heterostructure using facile electrochemical metallization followed by phosphorization without any intervention of metal-oxides/hydroxides. This bimetallic phosphide shows ultralow overpotentials of 12 (HER, hydrogen evolution reaction) and 140 mV (OER, oxygen evolution reaction) at current densities of 10 and 20 mA/cm(2) in acidic and alkaline mediums, respectively. The excellent stability lasts for at least for 10 days at a high current density of 500 mA/cm(2) without much deviation, inferring the practical utilization of the catalyst toward green fuel production. Undoubtedly, the catalyst is capable enough for overall water splitting at a very low cell voltage of 1.45 V @10 mA/cm(2) with an impressive stability of at least 40 h, showing a minimum loss of potential. Theoretical study has been performed to understand the reaction kinetics and d-band shifting among metal atoms in the heterostructure (Ni2P-CuP2) that favor the HER and OER activities, respectively. In addition, the catalyst demonstrates an alternate transformation of solar energy to green H-2 production using a standard silicon solar cell. This work unveils a smart design and synthesizes a highly stable electrocatalyst against an attractive paradigm of commercial water electrolysis for renewable electrochemical energy conversion.									104	3	0	0	5	0	104			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000634569100166	33625208

A thorough understanding of structure- activity relationships of low-dimensional Pd-based nanostructures plays a critical role in the pursuit of high-efficiency electrocatalysts. In this review, we first summarize the state-of-the-art research on the synthesis and rational design of low-dimensional Pd-based nanostructures, including one-dimensional nanowires and two-dimensional nanosheets. Next, by correlating the properties of materials with the structure, relevant strategies toward advanced Pd-based electrocatalysts including alloying, surface engineering, defect engineering, interface engineering and strain engineering are classified. We also discuss the promotion role of various strategies in different applications, including electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR), methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), as well as some heterogeneous reactions.

However, its electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is inferior. Here, we report a novel strategy for substantially improving the HER electrocatalytic activity of NiFe-LDH as well as retaining its OER performance through facile and low-consumption NH3-inducing at room temperature. The representative sample (NiFe-LDH2.18) shows a unique hierarchical architecture and a modulated electronic state, exhibiting more available active sites, more unobstructed channels for gas release, and faster electron/ion transfer rate. In an alkaline medium, NiFe-LDH2.18 exhibits excellent HER catalytic activity with an overpotential of 95 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), being much superior to that of original NiFe-LDH. Moreover, its impressive OER performance is well retained, requiring an overpotential of 227 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Thanks to the excellent HER/OER performance of NiFe-LDH2.18, remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward full water splitting has been achieved.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000852664500001

The commonly used method to synthesize these nanocatalysts is the colloidal synthesis, during which ligands are necessary. The problem in the colloidal synthesis is that post treatments (such as thermal annealing) are usually needed to remove the residual ligands to clean the surface of nanocatalysts. These post treatments could alter the surface structure of the prepared NPs and deactivate the catalytic performance. Therefore, it is interesting to directly prepare the catalysts with ligand-free properties. In fact, ligand-free synthesis of noble metal nanocatalysts has attracted much attention during the past decade. In this review we comprehensively overview the ligand-free synthesis of noble metal nanocatalysts and their electrocatalytic applications. Three synthetic methods for ligand-free synthesis (stabilization by small molecule, stabilization by modified support and constructing self-supported NPs) are classified and typical examples are given. The advantages and disadvantages of these synthetic methods are compared. Different approaches to characterize the ligand-free property of synthesized noble metal nanocatalysts are introduced and compared. Because of the ligand-free property of the synthesized nanocatalysts, they often exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activities. Therefore, the applications of as-synthesized ligand-free nano -catalysts for energy-related electrochemical reactions are summarized: liquid fuel oxidation reaction (LFOR), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Ligand-free synthetic process is often simple and efficient, which largely reduces the cost of catalyst synthesis, and can be more suitable for industrial production. However, there are still some problems to be solved in the future. Therefore, we point out the current underlining problems and give the perspectives in this emerging field.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000861034600003

However, their development for real application is restricted mainly due to the sluggish rates of the oxygen- reduction reaction ( ORR) and oxygen- evolution reaction ( OER) in the positive electrode. Thus, searching a facile way to attain highly efficient ORR and OER electrocatalysts are highly desirable. The key factors to improve the electrochemical performance of materials are to optimize their low- dimensional feature and adjust effective compositions. Prussian blue and its analogues ( PB/ PBAs) with open framework have attracted growing attention as hopeful precursors and templates to diverse transition metal- based materials and carbon hybrids for ORR and OER. Compared to other precursors, PB/ PBAs are more feasible for large- scale application due to their easy preparation, low cost, tuneable compositions and great environmental friendliness. In this review, recent progresses in the utilization of PB/ PBA to rationally design and synthesize complex composites with controlled morphologies, sizes, and compositions for ORR, OER and metal- air batteries are described in detail. Afterwards, a brief summary of the synthetic methods to complex transition metal- based compositions with nanostructures converted from PB/ PBAs are provided. Lastly, the research challenges and possible development direction of open framework materials for metal- air batteries are outlined through analysing the merits and drawbacks of using PB/ PBAs as precursors.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26				2566-6223		WOS:000477087800003

Here, we report a controlled synthesis of the nanocomposite, Co3O4 nanohorns coated with MnO2 nanosheets on a Ni foam (Co3O4@MnO2/Ni). It integrates the catalytic activities of oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions and functions as a carbon-and binder-free cathode catalyst for rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries. This nanocomposite catalyst presents a small discharge/charge voltage gap of 0.76 V (a low polarization) and a long cycle life of 170 cycles at 300 mA g(-1), coupled with an ionic liquid-based electrolyte, 0.5 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (EMITFSI), which are much better than those based on the individual Co3O4 and MnO2 cathodes. The enhanced electrochemical performance is ascribed to the integrated bifunctional catalytic activities and the porous micro/nanostructure of the Co3O4@MnO2/Ni nanocomposite, as well as the ionic liquid-based electrolyte, indicating its promising application in rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries.									48	7	0	0	0	0	50			2052-1553			WOS:000378516300014

In this work, we studied the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide by peroxynitrite, which led to oxygen evolution. Oxygen yields increased at alkaline pH with an apparent pK(a) of 7.05 +/- 0.04. The maximum yields were 16% and 32% of added peroxynitrite at pH 5.9 and 1.4, respectively, assuming that two molecules of peroxynitrite are needed to produce one of oxygen. Hydroxyl radical scavengers (dimethyl sulfoxide, mannitol, ethanol, formate, and acetate) inhibited oxygen evolution to a similar extent to that predicted from their rate constants with hydroxyl radical. The apparent rate constant of peroxynitrite decomposition was zero-order in hydrogen peroxide at acidic pH. At neutral and alkaline pH, the rate of peroxynitrite disappearance decreased in the presence of millimolar concentrations of hydrogen peroxide by up to 50%. The apparent activation enthalpy and entropy for peroxynitrite decomposition increased by 1.7 kcal mol(-1) and 4.7 cal mol(-1) K-1, respectively, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. We propose that an activated intermediate of peroxynitrous acid is responsible for hydrogen peroxide oxidation at acidic pH, while at more alkaline pH the formation of a stabilizing complex between hydrogen peroxide and trans-peroxynitrite anion is involved.									70	0	0	0	45	0	70			0893-228X	1520-5010		WOS:A1995RU20500006	7492735

High-performance oxygen evolution reaction activity at low and higher current densities using nanostructured CeO2 and Plasma-assisted Bi@CeO2 electrocatalysts								MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING B-ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL SOLID-STATE MATERIALS				286						116014	10.1016/j.mseb.2022.116014				DEC 2022	2022	Herein, pristine nanostructured cerium oxide (CeO2) electrode (HC) was fabricated via an alkali-free hydrothermal, exhibiting high OER behaviors at low current density. The HC electrode displayed a low overpotential of 0.32 V, low Tafel slope of 61.6 mV dec-1, and high stability of 99.6 % for 15 h at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. To accelerate the kinetic of OER at high current density, a binary Bi@CeO2 plasma-activated electrode (PBC) was prepared as an effective electrocatalyst to evolve larger oxygen gas. The PBC electrode exhibited a low overpotential (0.42 V and 0.46 V) at higher current densities of 50 mA cm-2 and 250 mA cm-2, a small Tafel slope of 47.4 mV dec-1, and excellent stability of 99 % for 15 h at a current density of 100 mA cm-2.

Herein, we report a heterogeneous Fe3O4-blended Ni/NiO composite fabricated through a salt-template method as highly active bifunctional catalysts for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the Ni/NiO/Fe3O4 requires low overpotential of 258 mV for OER in alkaline media and 206 mV for HER in acidic media, respectively, much lower than those of Ni/NiO, Fe3O4 and other Ni-based oxides. The excellent electrocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the enhanced charge-transfer kinetics between Ni and Fe sites and improved active sites resulted from the large nano-interface between Ni compounds and Fe3O4. This work provides a new method to design high-performance non-noble metal Ni-based electrocatalysts by incorporating Fe-doping and nano-interface-fabrication together, which can also be applied to develop other novel hybrid electrocatalysts for practical application.

The entire surface of the H-TiO2 NWs is covered uniformly by amorphous MnOx with an average thickness of 7.0 nm. The H-TiO2 NWs are poorly active for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the MnOx as a major potential feasible electrocatalyst shows a considerable activity. The onset potential shifts negatively and the current density improves not only by the enlarged surface area of the MnOx support on the H-TiO2 NWs, but also by a synergistic effect between TiO2 and MnOx. The presence of three manganese oxides with different valences such as MnO, Mn2O3 and MnO2 in the H-TiO2/MnOx NWs is apt to effect the OER due to electron transfer. The percentage of Mn2+ increases and the percentages of Mn3+ and Mn4+ decrease after the test, which proves the assumption that Mn4+ is first reduced to Mn3+ by electron injection from H2O, and then Mn3+ is further reduced to Mn2+ when the O-2 evolution occurs during the OER in alkaline media at pH >= 9.									37	2	0	0	2	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000363163200056

The catalyst shows excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media after further coating with polyaniline (PANI). For electrochemical performance, the optimized catalyst exhibits a potential gap, Delta E, of 0.75 V to achieve a current of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER and -3 mA cm(-2) for the ORR in 0.1 M KOH solution. Extensive characterization methods were applied to investigate the structure property of the catalyst for correlations with activity (e.g., XRD, BET, SEM, HRTEM, FIB-TEM, XPS, TGA, and Raman). The high electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst closely relates to the good electrical conductivity of PANI, accessible mesoporous structure, high surface area, as well as the synergistic effect of the specific core shell structure. This work opens a new avenue for the rational design of core shell structure catalysts for energy conversion and storage applications.									71	4	0	0	5	0	74			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000418204300029	29161503

Depending on synthesis temperature (115, 155 or 180 degrees C) and NaOH mineralizer mass (1.0, 1.6, 2.0 or 2.4 g) amount, the delafossites were composed of either mixed-phase 3R/2H-AgFeO2 or single-phase 3R-AgFeO2 crystals. Higher temperatures and NaOH mass were helpful to the growth of mu m-sized 3R (space group of R-3m) crystals while lower temperatures and mineralizer mass produced nm-sized 2H (space group of P63/mmc) crystals. The comparison of different delafossite samples revealed that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) current was larger in mixed-phase materials. Also, the transition from two-phase system to single-phase system was accompanied with a sudden drop in OER current. On the other hand, the difference between the electrochemical behavior of 3R and 2H phase delafossite is discussed in detail by considering similar studies in the literature.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1302-0900	2147-9429		WOS:000740125800001

Herein, we explored the possibility of using micelles of mesoporous silica (MCM-48) as the carbon source to generate porous carbon under the confinement of MCM-48 channels. The complexes formed by Co2+ and 4,4'-bipyridine were in situ incorporated into the micelles to derive Co-related active sites (Co-N-x, Co, and Co3O4) for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). After pyrolysis in the N-2 atmosphere and subsequent removal of the MCM-48 skeleton, the target porous carbon electrocatalyst was obtained, which exhibited promising performance for both ORR and OER and has great potential as the cathode material for Znair battery application. This work not only confirms the effectiveness of using the micelles of MCM-48 as the carbon source for preparing the porous carbon materials, but also provides a new platform for design and synthesis of structurally controllable materials for energy-related electrocatalytic applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000712069300049	34523919

The methods of absorption spectrum, fluorescence spectrum were used in the research. Results showed that Ce3+ treatment at low concentration could suitably change PS H microenvironment, increase the absorbance of visible light, improve the energy transfer among amino acids within PS II protein-pigment complex, and accelerate energy transport from tyrosine residue to chlorophyll a.

However, its practical application is restricted by the low energy conversion efficiency and poor stability of photocatalysts. Herein, we report the realization of highly efficient overall water splitting promoted by bifunctional bimetallic phosphide (Ni0.5Co0.5P) nanowire arrays vertically grown on carbon paper (Ni0.5Co0.5P/CP) and driven by highly stable all-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The Ni0.5Co0.5P/CP electrocatalysts can provide abundant active sites, high electrical conductivity, and good contact interface with the electrolyte, thus showing remarkable activity and great durability for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrolyzer assembled with both the Ni0.5Co0.5P/CP anode and cathode can afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at only 1.61 V and allow consecutive water splitting. The all-inorganic PSCs based on a CsPb0.9Sn0.1IBr2 light absorber and a nanocarbon electrode exhibit remarkable stability. When driven by all-inorganic PSCs, the electrolyzer delivers a high overall energy conversion efficiency (3.12%) and good long-term durability.									35	6	0	0	0	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448412700020

In this study, we adopted a high throughput method to prepare bi-metallic catalysts for oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions (OER/HER). A series of NieMo alloy electrocatalysts with tunable compositions were prepared by a simple co-sputtering method. Due to the synergistic effect between Ni and Mo, the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of the NieMo alloy electrocatalysts is improved, resulting in excellent HER and OER performances. The Ni90Mo10 electrocatalyst shows the best HER performance, with an extremely low overpotential of 58 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), while the Ni40Mo60 electrocatalyst shows an overpotential of 258 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in OER. More significantly, the assembled Ni40Mo60//Ni90Mo10 electrolyzer only needs a cell voltage of 1.57 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

As the only route towards energy utilization, the carriers with the characteristics of low carbon are regarded as the future choice, e.g., hydrogen and ammonia. To this end, electrocatalysis provides a green way to access these substances. However, the unfulfilled conversion efficiency is the bottleneck for practical application. In this review, the promising characteristics of amorphous materials and the amorphous-induced electrocatalytic enhancement (AIEE) were emphasized. In the beginning, the characteristics of amorphous materials are briefly summarized. The basic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalytic reactions is illustrated, including the hydrogen/oxygen evolution and oxygen/nitrogen reduction. In the third part, the electrocatalytic performance of amorphous materials is discussed in detail, and the mechanism of AIEE is highlighted. In the last section of this review, the challenges and outlook for the development of amorphous enhanced electrocatalysis are presented.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000723823100001	34846414

Herein, we present a robust iron-based catalyst (Fe-cat) that exhibits a fast ligand-induced regeneration ability, allowing for stable production of oxygen even in a 5.0 M NaOH electrolyte containing iron-2,2'-bipyrimidine (Fe-bpym). Using electrochemical methods and in situ UV-vis and electron paramagnetic resonance, we revealed the coordination configuration transition between the Fe-bpym in electrolytes and the Fe-cat on the electrode during the whole catalyst deposition-solution ligand repairing-catalyst regeneration process. The fast regeneration ability of the active Fe sites endures a long-term OER activity over 200 h with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 1.0 mA cm(-2). This study provides an important strategy to design the robust OER catalysts through in situ regeneration of active metal sites on an electrode.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2380-8195			WOS:000651810400003

The graphene-Idli was first prepared in a domestic microwave oven using heteroatom-doped (boron, nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorous) graphene and rice flour and calcined to produce graphene foam which was used as a metal-free bifunctional catalyst for oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions. The performance of heteroatom-doped foams (nitrogen, sulphur, boron and phosphorous) was studied and it was found that sulphur-doped graphene foam (s-DGF) shows better performance as electrocatalyst, in terms of high BET surface area (499 m(2)/g), electrochemical surface area (0.271 cm(2)), high roughness factor (0.690) and high porosity. As a bifunctional electrocatalyst, it possess a lowest onset potential (0.29 V vs Ag/AgCl), highest current density (497 mA cm(-2)), lowest overpotential (128 mV) and lowest Tafel slope (35.71 mV/dec) for oxygen evolution reaction and an onset potential of (-0.02 V), current density (-125 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (49.83 mV/dec) for oxygen reduction reaction. The obtained values are best among other reported metal-free electrocatalyst and superior to several metal-based electrocatalysts. The prepared foams were free from any methanol cross-over effect and show a good stability in all the aspect i.e. performance, storage etc. Being a bifunctional catalyst, the S-DGF was successfully implemented for the fabrication of rechargeable zinc-air battery also. This finding offers a straightforward environment-compatible route for synthesizing attractive bifunctional electrocatalyst material as promising candidates for the large-scale commercialization of regenerative fuel cells and rechargeable metal-air batteries. In addition, the proposed metal-free foam based catalyst are able to overcome the multiple disadvantages of the existing electrocatalyst like high cost, poor stability, low selectivity and detrimental environmental effects.									38	3	0	0	1	0	39			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000390636100015

The main focus was given to the role of reactant mixture (methanol + oxygen) composition at different surface temperatures. Freshly deposited PtOx changes its chemical state and morphology during the initial reaction leading to strongly corrugated metallic Pt layer with small amounts of stable Pt2+ cations providing a crucial ingredient for its specific catalytic properties. With growing temperature or methanol-to-oxygen molar ratio the reaction selectivity of such catalyst generally shifts from pathways producing water to those generating hydrogen. The efficiency for a given reaction route can be thus maximized via independent tuning of the fuel-oxygen ratio and surface temperature. The most intensive hydrogen evolution with the lowest relative amount of CO by-product (but relatively high abundance of methanolic residuals) was achieved with mildly oxygen lean feed above 500 K. The highest selectivity for partial oxidation of methanol pathway (>80%) can be, on the other hand, obtained with stoichiometric or oxygen rich mixture. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

At high O-2/C3H8 ratios, the platinum nanoparticles are saturated with oxygen and the reaction rate is zero-order with respect to the oxygen partial pressures in this regime. As the oxygen coverage decreases with decreasing O-2/C3H8 ratio, the reaction rate increases and the reaction order changes from zero-order to negative-order in the oxygen partial pressure. The reaction rate is controlled to a large extent by the oxygen coverage on the platinum nanoparticles. However, at lower temperatures and higher oxygen pressures there is a slow deactivation of the catalyst that cannot be explained by a slow change in the oxygen coverage. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of adsorbed CO was performed to track the evolution of the nanoparticle structure over the course of the propane oxidation reaction and to determine whether the slow deactivation was caused by reconstruction of the platinum nanoparticles. We found that the platinum nanoparticles are significantly reconstructed during the course of the reaction, including the formation of a platinum oxide (PtO) which has a characteristic CO-DRIFTS band at 2123 cm(-1). The extent of PtO formation decreases with increasing temperature and, as a result, deactivation of the catalyst is less severe at higher temperatures. Unexpectedly, increasing the oxygen partial pressure resulted in less PtO formation. We believe that a different platinum oxide phase (e.g. PtO2 or Pt3O4) is formed at higher oxygen pressures, which is reduced to metallic platinum during CO exposure at 25 degrees C, and therefore is not detectable by CO DRIFTS. These results are unique because they show how the nanoparticle structure evolves over many hours of propane oxidation, and how the temperature and oxygen pressure influence the reconstruction of the nanoparticles, which has implications for a wide range of reactions not limited to propane oxidation.

Here, a new method is used for developing Cu-doped ZIF-67 (Cu/ZIF-67) nanoparticles and carbonizing at various temperatures (500-900 degrees C). Benefiting from the doping of Cu nanoparticles on the surface of the ZIF-67 and the synergistic interaction between Cu and the underlying Co atoms, the Cu/Co-NC-800 electrocatalyst exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for both ORR (E-o 0.98, E-1/2 0.84 V) and OER (overpotential 0.278 V) and superior alkaline media stability relative to both prepared and commercial Pt/C (E-o 0.96 V). These insightful findings inspire new perspectives for economical-practical bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts to be designed and synthesized rationally.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1380-2224	1573-4854		WOS:000638558400002

The efficiency of electrolysis is limited by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which requires an efficient, low-cost, and acid-stable catalyst for proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis. In this work, we designed a highly active, acid-stable catalyst involving iridium-tungsten trioxide (Ir:WO3/Ir). Our theory predicts that high-valence Ir atoms are active sites for the OER and they can be stabilized in the WO3 matrix. Experimentally, we showed that the Ir:WO3/Ir catalyst achieves a high mass activity of 13.8 A mgIr-1 at 10 mA cm-2 and a stability in 0.5 M H2SO4 for 32 days; such a performance originates from the stabilized high-valence Ir sites with optimized binding energies to oxygen species. Our work demonstrates an effective strategy to obtain low-cost, durable, and efficient OER catalysts to potentially broaden the adoption of PEM electrolyzers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2380-8195			WOS:000821179900001

Although considerable effort has been devoted to increasing the OVs concentration in electrocatalysts, limited OVs have been created by current techniques so far. Here, we, for the first time, engineered (i.e., created) abundant OVs into perovskites by element doping and plasma treatment. The results revealed that more OVs were manufactured by combination of Sr doping with Ar plasma treatment, leading to improved OER activity and high stability of LaCoO3 perovskite. The La1-xSrxCoO3-delta(x = 0.3) sample with Ar plasma treatment (denoted as Sr-0.3-p) showed high OER activity and stability due to the existence of rich OVs, which provided large amounts as well as high intrinsic activity of active sites in OER The combination of two OV-creating techniques provides an efficient strategy to develop OV-rich catalysts for various applications.									64	4	0	0	0	0	64			2168-0485			WOS:000458086100006

Although plasma processing is an attractive option for polymer surface modification, plasma-surface interactions are complex and the process design is usually based on a trial-and-error procedure. Toward a comprehensive process design, a hybrid modeling framework, addressing both effects of plasmas on polymeric surfaces, is developed and applied to an investigation of the oxygen-plasma-induced surface roughening of poly(methyl methacrylate). A kinetic Monte Carlo surface model, considering the synergy of neutral species and ions, is used for the calculation of the local etching rate. The novel element of the model is that it takes into account the surface morphology through the calculation of the trajectories of the species joining the surface reactions. The local etching rate is utilized by a profile evolution module based on the level set method to predict the surface roughness evolution. A method for tracking the local variables of the evolving surface profile (e.g. surface coverage), treating a fundamental weakness of the level set method, is proposed and used to effectively reduce the computational time. The results of the framework are validated by comparison to a theoretical model. The prediction of roughness evolution is consistent with measurements vs time and at different operating conditions. The potential of the framework to additionally handle the chemical composition (oxidation) of the surface is demonstrated, enabling the study of the wetting behavior of plasma-etched polymeric surfaces.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000621501800001

Combined with a theoretical and experimental comparison, it was confirmed that B doping as well as its synergistic effect with N-doping in CNTs can effectively reduce the adsorption energy of the H intermediate at Ru site, improving the catalytic activity of the Ru cluster/CNT material for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from the synergistic effect of multi element doping and a porous tubular structure, the as-formed Ru@B,N-CNTs show excellent electrocatalytic activity for both HER and OER in alkaline conditions. An overpotential of 54 mV and 315 mV is needed to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which exceeds requirements for commercial Pt/C and RuO2. Furthermore, when assembled into an electrolyzer with Ru@B,N-CNTs as both the anode and the cathode, the cell requires a cell voltage of only 1.57 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium and has excellent catalytic stability for over 40 hours.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2052-1553			WOS:000749113500001

Enriching edge defects is proven a remarkably effective strategy to enhance the exposure of active sites and thus improve the electrocatalytic performance. This paper reports an edge-rich Mo-doping cobalt iron oxide nanomeshes (NMs) vertically supported on nickel foam (NF) by means of the straightforward hydrothermal synthesis technique. The synthesized Co1Fe1Mo1.8O NMs@NF exhibits an outstanding OER performance with super low overpotential of 210 mV and HER activity with low overpotential of 157 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), as well as long-term cycle durability after 24 h. Significantly, as a bifunctional electrode, Co1Fe1Mo1.8O NMs@NF displays a low potential of 1.68 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) coupled with a long-term water splitting stability in an alkaline electrolyte. This work may pave the way to a rational design of prospective bifunctional electrocatalysts for practical applications of electrochemical process. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The test samples are deposited on glass substrates upon 25 nm thick adhesive titanium layer. The thickness of the underlying Au is 240 nm and that of the top functional metal (Pt or Ir) is 10 nm. The properties of the sputtered films are studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical methods of cyclic voltammetry and quasi steady state polarization curves. The performed morphological and electrochemical investigations reveal that the specific catalytic efficiency of the composite Au-Pt and Au-Ir films is superior compared to that of the pure metals which allows for essential reduction of the catalytic loading at preserved performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0324-1130			WOS:000377707900006

In this work, through computational design, we have studied both ORR and CO2 RR for RuN4 doped graphene (RuN4-Gra) and modified RuN4-Gra by an oxygen atom (RuN4/O-Gra). For ORR, our calculations indicated that RuN4/O-Gra has better catalytic performance both kinetically and thermodynamically. The calculated energy barrier is 0.39 eV at the rate-determining step, much smaller than 0.80 eV for pure Pt and 0.56 eV for FeN4-Gra. The predicted working potential is 0.54 V, larger than 0.38 V for FeN4-Gra. For CO2 RR, the formation of HCOOH is prevented due to the strong adsorption of CO and strong hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for RuN4-Gra. However, after the modification of RuN4-Gra with an oxygen atom, the reaction pathway is changed and the formation of CO is prevented. RuN4/O-Gra has high selectivity toward HCOOH, and HER is also prevented. Therefore, RuN4/O-Gra is a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst for both ORR and CO2RR.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			2168-0485			WOS:000467351200016

The FTO was more stable in 0.1 M HNO3 and 0.1 M NaCl solutions under both anodic and cathodic polarization conditions. Cathodic polarization in 0.1 M HCl solution resulted in a reduction of SnO(2 )to lower valent species. The semiconductivity of FTO, which was n-type at low anodic potentials, was p-type at high anodic potentials possibly due to the formation of a SnO-type surface layer by the removal of lattice oxygen during the oxygen evolution reaction. Cyclic stability of the FTO was evaluated by conducting CV between -2.0 and vbn 2.0 V-Ag/AgCI at 1 V/s. Intergranular corrosion was observed and the stability was completely lost after 215 cycles in the 0.1 M HCl solution. The stability of FTO was better in the 0.1 M NaOH solution, wherein the electro-catalytic activity degraded after 500 cycles, the electrical connectivity was maintained even after 4500 cycles.

Nanoporous metal electrodes are promising to boost hydrogen production efficiency while challenging in synthesis. Here, a phosphorus-doping assisted electrochemical etching strategy is developed to construct highly nanoporous surfaces on metal electrodes, leading to a remarkable catalytic performance for overall water splitting under lab-level or industrial electrolysis conditions. Specifically, the nanoporous FeCo-NiCu foil shows 46 times higher electrochemical surface area, lowering the overpotentials by 102 mV for oxygen evolution reaction and 157 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction. The viability of the strategy is further demonstrated in the prevailing industrial electrodes of nickel meshes, enabling a cell voltage of only 1.931 V under the harsh industrial electrolytic condition (80 degrees C, 30 wt% KOH, and a current density of 500 mA cm(-2)). It is 126 mV lower than that of a bare nickel mesh-based electrolyzer and corresponds to a similar to 4% improvement in energy-conversion efficiency. This work offers a facile and ease-to-scale-up approach for the upgrading of widespread metal electrodes, possessing great prospects in energy conversion and storage devices including electrolyzers, fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000828039800006

Here, we develop an atomically dispersed Fe-based catalyst on N-doped carbon nanosheets (AD-Fe NS) which exhibits an exceptional catalytic NOR capability with a record-high nitrate yield of 6.12 mu mol mg(-1) h(-1) (2.45 mu mol cm(-2) h(-1)) and Faraday efficiency of 35.63%, outperforming all reported NOR catalysts and most well-developed NRR catalysts. The isotopic labeling NOR test validates the N source of the resultant nitrate from the N-2 electro-oxidation catalyzed by AD-Fe NS. Experimental and theoretical investigations identify Fe atoms in AD-Fe NS as active centers for NOR, which can effectively capture N-2 molecules and elongate the N.N bond by the hybridization between Fe 3d orbitals and N 2p orbitals. This hybridization activates N-2 molecules and triggers the subsequent NOR. In addition, a NOR-related pathway has been proposed that reveals the positive effect of O-2 derived from the parasitic OER on the NO3- formation.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000736560600001	34936346

Herein, two different morphologies of FeNi/NiFe2O4 supported over hierarchical N-doped carbons were achieved via carbonization of the polymer nanofibers by controlling the ratio of metal salts to melamine: a mixture of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene nanotubes (GNTs) supported over carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with spherical FeNi encapsulated at the tips (G/CNT@NCNF, 1:3), and graphene sheets wrapped CNFs with embedded needle-like FeNi (GS@NCNF, 2:3). G/CNT@NCNF shows excellent ORR activity (on-set potential: 0.948 V vs. RHE) and methanol tolerance, whilst GS@NCNF exhibited significantly lower over-potential of only 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER. Such high activities are due to the synergistic effects of bimetallic NPs encapsulated at CNT tips and N-doped carbons with unique hierarchical structures and the desired defects.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2046-2069		WOS:000498519000011	35539072

Herein, a controlled one-step alginate biomass carbonization strategy is presented to prepare the FeCox alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped porous carbon/multi-walled carbon nanotubes composites (FCx-NC/CNTs). Benefiting from the particular core-shell structure, high dispersion of active sites (FeCox alloy nanoparticles) and fine conductive network (CNTs and N-doped porous carbon), the optimized FCx-NC/CNTs-10 (containing 10 wt% CNTs in FCx-NC/CNTs) hybrid displays a remarkable bifunctional activity and long-term stability for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Notably, the corresponding bifunctional activity parameter (Delta E) is as low as 0.80 V, outperforming most state-of-the-art reported bifunctional electrocatalysts.

In this work, we design and realize FeNi-HD nanotube arrays (FeNi-HDNAs) on Ni foam via an in-situ reaction and Kirkendall effect. The obtained catalysts possess higher specific surface area, more catalytic active sites and better chemical stability for OER. Electron migrations from the Fe 3d orbitals to Ni sites in the FeNi-HDNAs lead to more unoccupied Fe 3d states and a higher oxidation state. As expected, FeNi-HDNAs exhibit lower overpotential as well as lower Tafel slope and better durability than the Fe- or Ni-HD peers. DFT calculations elucidate that FeNi hydroxides lower the energy barrier of rate-determining step in OER. Moreover, a high current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is obtained at a low potential of 1.49 V using FeNi-HDNAs as the bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in basic solution.									72	2	0	0	8	0	72			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000496897000015

The effective hydrogen energy production through lower energy consumption is considered as a promising approach to access the world's clean energy demand. Herein, an extraordinary bifunctional electrocatalytic activity on hydrogen energy production via urea electro-oxidation reaction in the alkaline electrolyte is evaluated by the highly dispersed tiny nickel palladium bimetallic nanoparticle-incorporated ordered mesoporous carbon (Ni(10%)Pd(10%)/OMC). The systematic electrocatalytic studies on the Ni(10%)Pd(10%)/OMC bifunctional electrocatalyst shows a very low required overpotentials [1.346 and -0.117 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 1 M KOH +0.33 M urea] to achieve urea electro-oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions at a respective electrocatalytic current density of 30 mA cm(-2), which is comparatively very lower overpotential than the oxygen evolution reaction (1.585 V vs RHE) in the water electrolysis system. Moreover, there is no remarkable electrocatalytic activity losses even after 5000 voltammetric cycles on urea electro-oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions. The Ni(10%)Pd(10%)/OMC bifunctional electrocatalyst exhibits highly efficient and faster reaction kinetics on urea electrolysis than the other three individual electrocatalysts and reasonable performance with the benchmark Pt-20%@C and IrO@C catalysts. Notably, the presence of nonprecious nickel metal promotes good electron density at palladium active sites of Ni(10%)Pd(10%)/OMC, which in turn facilitates efficient electrocatalytic reduction reactions to enhance the rate of overall urea electrolysis. Overall, the superior bifunctional ability of Ni(10%)Pd(10%)/OMC could be an appropriate energy efficient electrocatalyst to produce clean energy from wastewater treatment and fuel cell applications.									23	1	0	0	0	0	25			2168-0485			WOS:000486565900042

We have designed highly stable and active bifunctional catalysts for reversible oxygen electrodes by oxidative thermal scission, where we concurrently rupture nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes and oxidize Co and Mn nanoparticles buried inside them to form spinel Mn-Co oxide nanoparticles partially embedded in the nanotubes. Impressively high dual activity for oxygen reduction and evolution is achieved using these catalysts, surpassing those of Pt/C, RuO2, and IrO2 and thus raising the prospect of functional low-cost, non-precious-metal bifunctional catalysts in metal air batteries and reversible fuel cells, among others, for a sustainable and green energy future.									252	14	0	0	16	0	257			0002-7863			WOS:000336635400007	24815686

Sequential mechanistic analyses of activity enhancement and electron transfer pathways for the ORR, at different stages of controlled catalyst engineering, elucidated the crucial role of active sites and overall catalyst nature in tuning the ORR mechanism. Co@NC-600 also exhibited high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity under alkaline conditions which makes it one of the most efficient non-precious metal bifunctional catalysts, capable of catalyzing complex 4e(-) reduction processes like the ORR and OER.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000591084100030	33170196

However, the oxygen redox reaction is universally confronted with concomitant issues such as irreversible lattice oxygen loss and parasitical electrolyte degradation, thus debilitating cycling stability. Herein, a novel F-substituted layered structure P2-Na(0.65)Li(0.22)MnO(199)F(001 )cathode is designed, which exhibits superb capacity retention (183.6 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at 0.05C, 87.8% of the highest discharge capacity) and rate capability (105.5 mAh g(-1) at 5C) in Na half-cells. Such results are nontrivial as this system only contains the low-cost Mn transition metal element. Moreover, by systematic bulk/surface spectroscopy evidence (hard and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry), we explicitly corroborate that the irreversible oxygen evolution and notorious Jahn-Teller distortion are effectively subdued by trace F-substitution. In addition, a higher oxygen vacancy formation energy for the F-substituted structure was demonstrated via density functional theory calculations. Anionic substitution could therefore be an impactful solution to boost reversible oxygen redox chemistry for layered sodium oxide cathodes.									15	2	0	0	0	0	16			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000611066000031	33378178

Apart from Coulomb forces, quantum spin exchange interactions (QSEI) are part of the potentials that differentiate the activity of magnetic oxides, strongly correlated electrocatalysts, in electron transfer reactions. Ferromagnetic (FM) cobalt oxides can show low overpotentials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the La1-XSrXCoO3- (0 X 1) family of perovskites is good ground to gain understanding of the electronic interactions in strongly correlated catalysts. In this case, Sr-doping raises the OER activity and the conductivity and increases FM spin moments. The efficiency of electrocatalysts based on Earth-abundant 3d-transition metals correlates with the interrelated factors: mild-bonding energies, the reduction of the electronic repulsions because of the QSEI in the open-shells, and enhanced spin delocalization in FM ordering. The reason for the outstanding OER activity of SrCoO3- is the accumulation of FM holes in the 3d-2p bonds, including the ligand orbitals, thus facilitating spin-selected charge transport and production of triplet O-2 moieties from the oxidation of diamagnetic precursors. Spin-polarized oxygen atoms in the lattice can participate in O-O coupling and release of O-2 in a Mars-Van Krevelen mechanistic fashion. We show that the stabilizing FM QSEI decrease the adsorption and activation energies during oxygen evolution and spin-dependent potentials are one of the factors that govern the catalytic activity of magnetic compositions: spintro-catalysis.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000459584900012	30672534

Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to explore the exact active centers of the bifunctional catalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a bifunctional catalyst of ultra-thin porous delta-FeOOH modified Ni3S2 nanosheets exhibits a relatively low overpotential of 187 mV for the OER and 106 mV for the HER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. In addition, the overall water splitting unit provides a potential of 1.525 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and maintains a performance of 96.85% after 24 h continuous testing. Multispectral analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclose that the constructed interface between delta-FeOOH and Ni3S2 has two functional groups of Ni-O-Fe and Fe-S bonds to boost the OER and HER performance, respectively, thereby accelerating the overall electrochemical water splitting process in alkaline solution.									26	1	0	0	0	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000581598800034

However, experimental studies regarding the effects of undissolved, remaining S are rare. Herein, we experimentally elucidate the influence of S in an Ni-based material in enhancing the OER performance. The Fe- and Co-doped sulfurized Ni catalyst prepared using a simple impregnation method with heating under an H2S atmosphere exhibited superior OER activity (271.2 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) compared to that of the non-sulfurized analogues while S remained. In situ/operando Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that S at the outermost surface dissolved and accelerated the regeneration of the NiOOH phase during the OER. The remaining S increased the Ni-O bond length of the regenerated NiOOH, thus boosting the OER catalytic activity. These findings provide an understanding of sulfurized catalysts and new perspectives in the development of materials for use in the OER.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000722718500001

However, hydrogen production by photoelectric coupling remains a challenge. Here, by the cooperative coupling of heteroatoms and a heterojunction interface engineering strategy in a limited space, a honeycomb porous Co2P/Mo2C@NC catalyst was obtained for the first time. In contrast most traditional chemical syntheses, this method maintains excellent electrical interconnections among the nanoparticles and results in large surface areas and many catalytically active sites. Theoretical calculations reveal that the construction of a heterostructure can effectively lower the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction barriers as well as improve the electrical conductivity, consequently enhancing the electrochemical performance. Significantly, the overall water-splitting hydrolytic tank assembled using AsGa solar cells enabled the system to achieve a stable solar hydrogen conversion efficiency of 18.1%, which provides a new approach for facilitating large-scale hydrogen production via portable water hydrolysis driven by solar cells.									4	1	0	0	1	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000798991800003

Herein, the two-dimensional ZnCo2O4 nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies (OV-ZnCo2O4 nanosheets) have been constructed by facile hydrothermal approach and NaBH4 reduction treatment. The experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the as-prepared materials possess enhanced electrical conductivity, modulated electronic structure, increased active sites, and optimal adsorption energies for intermediates. As a supercapacitor electrode, the OV-ZnCo2O4 nanosheets deliver inspiring specific capacitance of 2110.6F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1). Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled by OV-ZnCo2O4 nanosheets//active carbon (AC) exhibits a high energy density of 34.6 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 160 W kg(-1). As an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the OV-ZnCo2O4 nanosheets only need remarkably low overpotential of 324 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) largely determines the energy efficiency in PEC water-splitting. Hematite, which is a cheap and sustainable semiconductor material with excellent chemical properties, a favourable band gap (2.1 eV) and composed of earth abundant elements is a suitable model photoanode material for studying OER. To understand the design of energy efficient anodes, it is highly desirable to have mechanistic insight into OER at an atomistic level which can be directly connected to experimentally measured quantities. We present a multiscale computational model of OER which connects the thermodynamics and kinetics of elementary charge transfer reactions in OER to kinetics of OER at laboratory length and time scales. We couple density functional theory (DFT) and DFT based molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations with solvent effects at an atomistic level with kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations at a coarse-grained level in our multiscale model. The time and applied bias potential dependent surface coverage, which are experimentally not known, and the O-2 evolution rate during OER at the hematite-water interface are calculated by the multiscale model. Furthermore, the multiscale model demonstrates the effect of explicitly modelling the interaction of water with the electrode surface via direct adsorption.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000656622300005	33735341

Herein, a universal pH-controlled wet-chemical strategy is reported followed by thermal and phosphorization treatment to prepare large-size, porous and ultrathin bimetallic phosphide (NiCoP) nanosheets, in which graphene oxide is adopted as a template to determine the size of products. The thickness of the resultant NiCoP nanosheets ranges from 3.5 to 12.8 nm via delicately adjusting pH from 7.8 to 8.5. The thickness-dependent electrocatalytic performance is evidenced experimentally and explained by computational studies. The prepared large-size ultrathin NiCoP nanosheets show excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for overall water splitting, with low overpotentials of 34.3 mV for HER and 245.0 mV for oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, at 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the NiCoP nanosheets exhibit superior photocatalytic HER performance, achieving a high HER rate of 238.2 mmol h(-1) g(-1) in combination with commonly used photocatalyst CdS, which is far superior to that of Pt/CdS (81.7 mmol h(-1) g(-1)). All these results demonstrate large-size porous ultrathin NiCoP nanosheets as an efficient and multifunctional electro/photocatalyst for water splitting.									85	9	0	0	8	0	87			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000515852800001		
J	Hwang, Eun Hye; Ryu, Seung Min; Kim, Sung Jin								Mechanistic Studies on the Hydrogen Evolution and Permeation of Ultra-Strong Automotive Steel in Neutral Chloride Environments								KOREAN JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH				28	7			428	434		10.3740/MRSK.2018.28.7.428				JUL 2018	2018	Hydrogen evolution on a steel surface and subsequent hydrogen diffusion into the steel matrix are evaluated using an electrochemical permeation test with no applied cathodic current on the hydrogen charging side. In particular, cyclic operation in the permeation test is also conducted to clarify the corrosion-induced hydrogen evolution behavior. In contrast to the conventional perception that the cathodic reduction reaction on the steel in neutral aqueous environments is an oxygen reduction reaction, this study demonstrates that atomic hydrogen may be generated on the steel surface by the corrosion reaction, even in a neutral environment. Although a much lower permeation current density and significant slower diffusion kinetics of hydrogen are observed compared to the results measured in acidic environments, they contribute to the increase in the embrittlement index. This study suggests that the research on hydrogen embrittlement in ultra-strong steels should be approached from the viewpoint of corrosion reactions on the steel surface and subsequent hydrogen evolution/diffusion behavior.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1225-0562	2287-7258		WOS:000454009100010

However, the role of excessive amounts of doped elements on ORR performance is unclear. In this work, PtNi octahedra were synthesized with and without excess Mo dopant. Also, spherical PtNi nanoparticles containing excess Co dopant were synthesized. The ORR performance revealed that PtNiMo octahedra and PtNiCo nanoparticles showed inferior ORR activities compared to bimetallic PtNi octahedra. Based on the electrochemical analysis, we found that unfavorable oxygen-binding strengths of PtNiMo and PtNiCo catalysts decrease the ORR performances.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0253-2964	1229-5949		WOS:000823722400001

The obtained MOF-CoSe2 exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance: it shows a small Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1), a low onset potential of 150 mV; it delivers a high current density and excellent long-term stability. Such enhancement can be attributed to the unique N-doped MOFs derived architecture with high conductivity, which can not only provide abundant active reaction sites, but also ensure robust contact between the CoSe2 nanoparticles and N-doped carbon matrix, leading to outstanding electrocatalytic activity for HER. This study provides a route to prepared non-noble-metal catalyst with high efficiency and excellent electrocatalytic activity for HER. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The anodizing current J(T) within the oxide includes ionic current j(ion) and electronic current j(e) during the anodizing process. The j(ion) is used to form an oxide and the j(e) is used to give rise to oxygen gas or sparking. The j(e) results from the impurity centers within the oxide. For a given electrolyte, the j(e) is dependent on the impurity centers and independent of the J(T). The formation of nanopores can be ascribed to the oxygen evolution within the oxide. Oxygen gas will begin to be released at the critical thickness d(c). The manner of the development of PAA is in accordance with that of BAA. The differences between PAA and BAA are the magnitude of j(e) or the continuity of oxygen evolution. There are two competitive reactions, i.e. oxide growth (2Al(3+) + 3O(2-) -> Al2O3) and oxygen evolution (2O(2-) -> O-2 up arrow + 4e). The former keeps the wall of the channel lengthened, the latter keeps the channel open. By controlling the release rate of oxygen gas under different pressures, the shape of the channels can be adjusted. The present results may open up some opportunities for fabricating special templates.									125	7	0	0	6	1	126			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000271268600007	19875874	
J	Sun, Guowei; Wang, Chan; Gu, Wenxiu; Song, Qijun								A facile electroless preparation of Cu, Sn and Sb oxides coated Ti electrode for electrocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				772						144908	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144908		FEB 2021		JUN 10 2021	2021	Electrocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants is an encouraging technology for wastewater treatment. To achieve practical application, electrode plate with cost effective fabrication, high catalytic efficiency and long service life is urgently required. This work prepared a CuO-SnO2-SbOx electrode on Ti substrate, which is achieved by ultrasonic assisted deposition of Cu layer, followed by electroless deposition of Sn-Sb layer and finalized by calcination at 500 C. The obtained electrode (Ti/CuO-SnO2-SbOx) exhibited high catalytic degradation activity and a high oxygen evolution potential (OEP) of 2.13 V, which is 0.4 V greater than that of the widely recognized Ti/SnO2-SbOx electrode. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) models of active oxygen intermediate adsorption was optimized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results revealed that (1) the Delta G of the OER rate-determining step was raised to 2.30 eV after Cu doping on 101 plane; (2) binding energies of the optimized surface with reactive oxygen species (ROS) were substantially decreased. Furthermore, the as-prepared electrode has a high yield of hydroxyl radical generation as evidenced by terephthalic acid detection. The potential for hydroxyl radical generation was measured to be 1.8 Vat pH = 12 and 2.6 V at pH = 2.The catalytic degradation rate of methylene blue (MB) follows pseudo first order reaction kinetics, and the reaction constant K value reached 0.02964 -k/min(-1), twice as much as that obtained from electrodeposition electrode (Ti/Cu/SnO2-SbOx). A degradation rate of 94.6% was achieved for MB in 100 min in the first run, and the value remained over 85% in the subsequent 10 runs. At the same conditions, the degradation rate of p-nitrophenol was over 90% in 100 min and complete mineralization was achieved in 4 h. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report a novel concept that layered double hydroxides (LDHs) can be used as a precursor to form bimetals and their oxides simultaneously. Co3O4-doped Co/CoFe nanoparticles integrated with graphitic shells are derived from the thermal decomposition of a CoFe LDH bonded with urea as the carbon precursor. The composite material shows a surprisingly high bifunctional (ORR/OER) catalytic activity. The realized core-shell structure synergistically promotes the ORR performance while cobalt oxide doped on the metal surface boosts the OER performance. In addition, the carbon shell ensures high electrical conductivity and effectively impedes the aggregation and the further oxidation of Co/CoFe nanoparticles. When integrating the catalyst into a rechargeable Zn-air battery, the battery performance shows a higher discharge potential and cycling stability (over 65 h of cycling) and a lower charge plateau compared with a Zn-air battery based on a Pt/C and RuO2 catalyst mixture. This work demonstrates a new efficient air cathode material which could be practically applied to rechargeable metal-air batteries or other fuel cells.									78	6	0	0	1	0	79			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000425623600048

The effects of reaction parameters on morphologies and corresponding electrochemical performances of NiSe/Ni3Se2/NF are investigated in detail. As a newfangled three-dimensional bifunctional electrocatalyst, the electrocatalyst synthesized at 180 degrees C with 12 hours reaction time (denoted as NiSe/Ni3Se2/NF-12) demonstrates the most regular morphology and best electrochemical properties. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between NiSe and Ni3Se2, and the large surface area of the highly conductive Ni foam, the novel 3D hybrid electrode provides predominant electrocatalytic performances towards both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. In addition, when used for full water splitting, NiSe/Ni3Se2/NF-12 can drive a 10 mA cm(-2) current density at approximate to 1.6V in 1 M KOH, which is competitive to the best electrocatalysts to our knowledge, with robust durability. Theoretical calculations confirm that the significant activity of the obtained material due to the unique 3D nanosheet architecture and interface reconstruction between NiSe and Ni3Se2 through Ni-Se bonding, which results in the re-distribution of charge and thus reduces the energy barrier of hydrogen desorption during the water decomposition.									58	2	0	0	3	0	58			2196-7350			WOS:000430660700008

Herein, we report the synthesis of Co/CoOx supported on coal-derived N-doped carbon via a simple microwave-assisted method and demonstrate its application as an efficient catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). With the optimal amount of cobalt introduced into the N-doped coal-derived, the developed catalyst achieved overpotentials of 0.370 and 0.429 V during water oxidation at current densities of 1 mA cm(-2) and 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. There was no noticeable loss in the activity of the catalyst during continuous galvanostatic polarization at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for a test period of 66 h. The synergistic interaction of the Co/CoOx moieties with the pyridinic and pyrollic nitrogen functional groups in the N-doped carbon, as well with the other heteroatoms species in the pristine coal favored enhancement of the OER electrocatalytic performance.

Reported herein is a unique Pt-branched structure, a multicube, whose surface is mostly enclosed by {100} facets but contains high-index facets at the small junction area between the adjacent cubic components. The synthesis is accomplished by a Ni2+-mediated facet evolution from high-index {311} to {100} facets on the frameworks of multipods. Despite the high {100} facet coverage, the Pt multicubes exhibit impressive ORR activity in terms of half-wave potential and current density nearly to the level of the most active Pt-based catalysts, while the durability of catalysts is well retained. The facet evolution creates a set of samples with tunable ratios of high-index to low-index facets. The results reveal that the excellent ORR performance of Pt multicubes is a combined result of active sites by high-index facets and low resistance by flat surface. It is anticipated that this work will offer a new approach to facet-controlled synthesis and ORR catalysts design.									75	7	0	0	1	0	76			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000354193300026	25756931

However, the HER in alkaline medium exhibits sluggish kinetics because of the difficulty of hydrogen adsorption and hydrolysis. Herein, a hierarchical nanoporous Ni/NiO catalyst with self-supported structures is prepared through dealloying followed by partial electro-oxidation. The catalytic activity for HER in alkaline medium is significantly enhanced by very short time electro-oxidation. The Ni/ NiO-3 s sample (subjectied to 3 s of electro-oxidation) exhibits the outstanding catalytic performance with an overpotential of 25 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The synergic effect of NiO and Ni improves the kinetics of Volmer and Heyrosky steps. The nanoporous structure provides more active sites and facilities for the transfer of substances and charges. The self-supporting structure ensures long-term stability.

In this work, we propose a two-dimensional CdS/SnS2 heterostructure (CSHS) as a possible water splitting photocatalyst by first-principles calculations. The CSHS enhances the absorption of visible and infrared light, and the type-II band alignment guarantees the spatial separation of the photoinduced carriers. The induced built-in electric field across the CSHS interface efficiently separates the photoexcited carriers and extends their carrier lifetimes. All these properties make the CSHS a direct Z-scheme system with the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions occurring, respectively, at the CdS and SnS2 layers. More encouragingly, the introduction of a S-vacancy into SnS2 could effectively lower the overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction, thus ensuring the overall water redox reaction to be achieved spontaneously under light irradiation. Our findings suggest that the CSHS is a promising water splitting photocatalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000749716100001	35084406

Nature communications				13	1			179	179		10.1038/s41467-021-27788-2				2022 Jan 10	2022	The three-dimensional (3D) distribution of individual atoms on the surface of catalyst nanoparticles plays a vital role in their activity and stability. Optimising the performance of electrocatalysts requires atomic-scale information, but it is difficult to obtain. Here, we use atom probe tomography to elucidate the 3D structure of 10nm sized Co2FeO4 and CoFe2O4 nanoparticles during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We reveal nanoscale spinodal decomposition in pristine Co2FeO4. The interfaces of Co-rich and Fe-rich nanodomains of Co2FeO4 become trapping sites for hydroxyl groups, contributing to a higher OER activity compared to that of CoFe2O4. However, the activity of Co2FeO4 drops considerably due to concurrent irreversible transformation towards CoIVO2 and pronounced Fe dissolution. In contrast, there is negligible elemental redistribution for CoFe2O4 after OER, except for surface structural transformation towards (FeIII, CoIII)2O3. Overall, our study provides a unique 3D compositional distribution of mixed Co-Fe spinel oxides, which gives atomic-scale insights into active sites and the deactivation of electrocatalysts during OER.									16	0	0	0	0	0	15				2041-1723		MEDLINE:35013310	35013310

Herein, heterostructural Ni3N-NiMoN nanowires supported on carbon cloth (Ni3N-NiMoN/CC) are successfully fabricated, and they can act as bifunctional electrocatalysts, exhibiting a low overpotential of 74 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and a low potential of 1.39 V at 50 mA cm(-2) for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR), respectively. The HMFOR//HER device constructed by Ni3NNiMoN/CC achieves a very low cell voltage of similar to 1.29 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which is 0.32 V lower than that of the OER//HER device. Specially, a value-added product of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid is obtained. Additionally, density functional theory calculations are carried out. This work provides a promising strategy to further reduce the cell voltage to generate hydrogen by replacing OER with biomass oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2574-0970		WOS:000820216300001

A thorough examination of the data shows, that there is no volcano once the oxide-covered metals are left out. We examine the factors that govern the reaction rate in the light of our own theory and conclude, that Sabatier's principle is only one of several factors that determine the rate. With the exception of nickel and cobalt, the reaction rate does not decrease for highly exothermic hydrogen adsorption as predicted, because the reaction passes through more suitable intermediate states. The case of nickel is given special attention; since it is a 3d metal, its orbitals are compact and the overlap with hydrogen is too low to make it a good catalyst.									318	8	0	0	15	1	320			2190-4286			WOS:000337811200001	24991521	
J	Mondal, Biswajit; Sen, Pritha; Dey, Abhishek								Proton reduction in the presence of oxygen by iron porphyrin enabled with 2nd sphere redox active ferrocenes								CHINESE JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				42	8	SI		1327	1331		10.1016/S1872-2067(20)63761-5				AUG 2021	2021	Hydrogen evolution in the presence of atmospheric level of oxygen is a significant barrier in the quest for an alternative, sustainable and green source of energy to counter the depleting fossil fuel sources and increasing global warming due to fossil fuel burning. Oxygen reduction is thermodynamically more favourable than proton reduction and it often produces reactive oxygenated species upon partial reduction which deactivates the catalyst. Thus, catalyst development is required for efficient proton reduction in the presence of oxygen. Here, we demonstrate an iron porphyrin having triazole containing 2nd sphere hydrogen bonding residues appended with redox active ferrocene moieties (alpha(4)-Tetra-2-(3-ferrocenyl-1,2,3-triazolyl)phenylporphyrin (FeFc(4))) as a bifunctional catalyst for fast and selective oxygen reduction to water and thus, preventing the proton reduction by the same catalyst from oxidative stress. Fe(0) is the active species for proton reduction in these iron porphyrin class of complexes and it is observed that the kinetics of proton reduction at Fe(0) state occurs at much faster rate than O-2 reduction and thus, paving the way for selective proton reduction in the presence of oxygen.

B	Regmi, Y.N.								Electrocatalysis using transition metal carbide and oxide nanocrystals								Electrocatalysis using transition metal carbide and oxide nanocrystals								152 pp	152 pp						2015	2015	Carbides are one of the several families of transition metal compounds that are considered economic alternatives to catalysts based on noble metals and their compounds. Phase pure transition metal carbides of group 4-6 metals, in the first three periods, were synthesized using a common eutectic salt flux synthesis method, and their electrocatalytic activities compared under uniform electrochemical conditions. Mo2C showed highest hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities among the nine metal carbides investigated, but all other metal carbides also showed substantial activities. All the metal carbides showed remarkable enhancement in catalytic activities as supports, when compared to traditional graphitic carbon as platinum support. Mo2C, the most active transition metal carbide electrocatalyst, was prepared using four different synthesis routes, and the synthesis route dependent activities compared. Bifunctional Mo 2C that is HER as well as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active, was achieved when the carbide was templated on a multiwalled carbon nanotube using carbothermic reduction method. Bimetallic carbides of Fe, Co, and Ni with Mo or W were prepared using a common carbothermic reduction method. Two different stoichiometries of bimetallic carbides were obtained for each system within a 60 degC temperature window. While the bimetallic carbides showed relatively lower electrocatalytic activities towards HER and ORR in comparison to Mo2C and WC, they revealed remarkably higher OER activities than IrO2 and RuO2, the state-of-the-art OER catalysts. Bimetallic oxides of Fe, Co, and Ni with Mo and W were also prepared using a hydrothermal synthesis method and they also revealed OER activities that are much higher than RuO2 and IrO2. Additionally, the OER activities were dependent on the degree and nature of hydration in the bimetallic oxide crystal lattice, with the completely hydrated, as synthesized, cobalt molybdate and nickel molybdate showing the highest OER activities.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-13-393-9172-4	INSPEC:16190814

Bimetallic transition metal phosphides (TMPs) display improved performance than monometallic transition metal phosphides due to their synergistic effects. Moreover, research has proven that supporting them on conductive substrates can further enhance their electrochemical performance. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are incorporated into bimetallic TMPs for enhanced performance. This review starts with a synopsis of the reaction mechanisms and performance parameters of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts. Moreover, the strategies for enhancing the performance of bimetallic TMPs and improving the hydrophilicity of TMPs are also discussed. In conclusion, the challenges and perspectives of bimetallic transition metal phosphides are discussed. This review analyses the extensive progress in this research domain and proffers insights that can aptly guide the future development of more excellent TMPs and other transition metal electrocatalysts for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-6549			WOS:000810720300001

Electrocatalysis of hydrogen evolution reaction is a promising way to produce hydrogen since it can be powered by renewable energy such as solar and wind energy. However, the mainstream electrocatalyst is noble metal (Pt/Ru/Ir), which is expensive and rare. It is necessary to develop non-noble metal catalysts toward HER from the perspective of sustainable development and long-term environmental conservation. Therefore, this paper provides a cheap and feasible way to synthesize the Fe-Ni bimetallic N-doped carbon framework (Fe-Ni@NCF). The prepared Fe-Ni@NCF exhibits the desired overpotential of 219 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and 259 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic solution, respectively. Besides, it exhibits similar current density loss as commercial Pt/C after 10,000 segments of CVs, which suggests satisfactory durability. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, a number of methodologies have been proposed for Li metal surface protection, but evaluation of the stability of the protective materials is insufficient. Therefore, in this study, we fabricated an NCL (Nafion-based composite layer) as a mechanically and chemically stable protective layer for Li metal in Li-O-2 batteries. In addition, comparative experiments were conducted to investigate the mechanical and chemical stability of protective layers. Li-O-2 batteries using NCL-coated Li metal exhibited reversible oxygen reduction and evolution without any side reactions caused by reactive oxygen species that decompose chemically unstable protective materials. The NCL also exhibited effective mechanical strength which was verified with not only a Li stripping and plating test but also using a large scale Li-O-2 pouch cell which had has severe operating conditions with high current and capacity values.									50	4	0	0	1	0	49			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000459331600038

Nickel iron layered double hydroxides (NF-LDHs) are considered the most promising electrocatalysts for alkaline water oxidation among various low-cost transition metal-based electrocatalysts although exact mechanisms are still on debate. Herein, we disclose that quaternary multimetallic Ni-Fe-Al-Co LDHs (NFAC-MELDHs) function as one of the best catalysts for alkaline as well as seawater oxidation due to the synergetic effects among the four different redox-flexible metals. The multimetallic Ni-Fe-Al-Co LDHs are prepared via the metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived electrochemical incorporation of fourth transition metal (Co) into ternary Ni-Fe-Al LDHs grown by a hydrothermal reaction. Moreover, we reveal an exact electrocatalytic mechanism for the OER in NFAC-MELDHs via ex situ spectroscopies in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Redox-flexible Fe is identified with a real active site in synergy with the neighboring metals stabilizing adsorption of oxygen intermediates and simultaneously facilitating charge transfer. In consequence, NFAC-MELDHs exhibit one of the lowest overpotentials of 220 and 280 mV for affording a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and simulating seawater solutions, respectively. More importantly, activity and stability merits in electrocatalysis for the OER are improved in the sequence of unary, binary, ternary, and quaternary LDHs, implying that catalyst design using multimetals for LDHs is a highly promising strategy.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000712912900001		
J	Ventura, P.; D'Antona, F.					Ventura, Paolo/0000-0002-5026-6400			Does the oxygen-sodium anticorrelation in globular clusters require a lowering of the Na-23(p,alpha)Ne-20 reaction rate?								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				457	3			995	1001		10.1051/0004-6361:20065481				OCT 2006	2006	Context. The chemical content of the ejecta of Asymptotic Giant Branch stars (AGBs) is important to understand whether intermediate mass stars played a role in the "self-enrichment scenario", to explain the chemical anomalies observed among Globular Clusters stars. One difficulty of this model is that it is not fully consistent with the observed oxygen-sodium anticorrelation.Aims. We look for the combinations of the input-physics parameters by which the yields of massive AGBs are sodium-rich and oxygen-poor.Methods. Many evolutions from the early evolutionary phases until the mass of the envelope drops below similar to 0.5 M-circle dot are calculated for a 5 M-circle dot Z = 0.001 model for various assumptions concerning the extra mixing from the bottom of the envelope and the relevant cross sections involving sodium.Results. A modest amount of extra mixing from the bottom of the surface convective zone leads to ejecta that are moderately sodium rich and oxygen depleted. A different but appealing modelization allows us to reproduce the observations of stars with a lower oxygen content: extra mixing is not included, but the cross sections of the reaction Na-23(p, alpha)Ne-20 must be a factor of similar to 4 lower than the recommended values. If the initial neon content of the star is not solar-scaled but enhanced as the other a elements by a factor similar to 2, the afore mentioned cross section must be lessened by only a factor similar to 2.									30	1	0	0	0	0	30			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000240785500025

In this communication, we present the exploitation of Ni3S2 @Co(OH)(2) which directly grown on nickel foam (Ni3S2@Co(OH)(2)/NF) as a robust and stable electrocatalyst for OER. Such Ni3S2@Co(OH)(2)/NF-5h demanding overpotential of only 290 mV is less than that of Ni3S2@Co(OH)(2)/NF-10h (310 mV), Ni3S2@Co(OH)(2)/NF-2h (320 mV) and Ni3S2/NF(350 mV), respectively, to drive a geometrical catalytic current density of 35 mA cm(-2), which is also better than that of noble metal catalyst IrO2/NF (320 mV). In addition, the Ni3S2@Co(OH)(2)/NF-5h presents a superior longterm electrocatalytic stability, keeping its activity at 26 mA cm(-2) for 40 h. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, we report the finding in the development of a hexagonal Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF-H) perovskite as an OER electrocatalyst. Prepared by a sol-gel method, the BSCF-H perovskite displays excellent OER efficiency and stability in a harsh alkaline solution. The overpotential of BSCF-H reveals 360 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH solution, and its catalytic activity for the OER is even comparable to that of the commercial Ir/C (20%) catalyst. Furthermore, BSCF-H possesses more operational stability with slight current reduction than cubic Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF-C) and RuO2 catalysts. This high activity is explained by a faster charge transfer rate, higher electrochemical surface area and a larger amount of oxygen species (O-2(2-)/O-). The Co d-band center and O p-band center of BSCF-H move to the Fermi level, which indicates the better OER performance of BSCF-H. This study demonstrates the new type of hexagonal Co-based perovskite catalyst that could be a low-cost alternative for electrochemical energy technology.									9	1	0	0	0	0	8			2052-1553			WOS:000587892200017

To overcome this problem, a highly active and low-cost bifunctional electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial to satisfy industrial criteria. Layered double hydroxides (LDH) attracted significant interest in several fields, including catalysis, storage of energy, delivery of druges, etc. A simple coprecipitation method for the preparation of highly active electrochemical Fe-x/CoNi LDH catalysts at room temperature was described here. In alkaline media, from series of prepared catalysts, the Fe-8%/Co-Ni LDH shows superior electrocatalytic activity with an overpotential of 232 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), andE(o)91 V andE(1/2)0.83 V versus RHE comparable to both noble metal-based and noble-metal-free OER/ORR catalysts recorded. Proper electronic structure and charging resistance that can facilitate the reduction of electron movement in the ORR/OER, are considered as two main factors in reducing the over-potential catalytic reaction.[GRAPHICS].									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1735-207X	1735-2428		WOS:000539497700001
