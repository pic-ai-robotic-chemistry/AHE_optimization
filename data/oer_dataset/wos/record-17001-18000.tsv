Oxygen Electrode Rechargeability in an Ionic Liquid for the Li-Air Battery								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS				2	19			2420	2424		10.1021/jz201070t				OCT 6 2011	2011	Oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) and oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) on glassy carbon (GC) and gold electrodes were investigated in a neat and Li(+)-containing room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(triflouromethanesulfonyl)imide (EMITFSI). The presence of Li(+) significantly changes the ORR mechanism. While similar one-electron O(2)/O(2)(center dot-) reversible couples result on both electrodes in neat EMITFSI, in the presence of added LiTFSI, the initially formed LiO(2) decomposes to Li(2)O(2). In addition, the ORR and OER in the Li(+)-doped solution exhibit strong distinctions between the Au and GC electrodes. The voltammetric data on the Au electrode revealed a highly rechargeable ORR, yielding LiO(2) and Li(2)O(2), which underwent multiple cycles without electrode passivation.SECTION: Energy Conversion and Storage									144	7	0	0	3	0	147			1948-7185			WOS:000296893500008

Herein, a facile nanostructured electrode, composed of porous Co2P films coated on carbon fiber (CF@PeCo(2)P), is designed and prepared. The unique three-dimensional interconnected pore structure of Co2P and the close contact between porous Co2P and CF not only increase specific surface areas to expose abundant catalytic sites but also stimulate the transport of electron, mass and gaseous products in catalytic process. Benefit from the reasonable electrode structure, the self-supported CF@PeCo(2)P electrodes present perfect performance with only needing overpotentials of 107.7/175.5/141.8 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic/neutral/alkaline solution and 269.4 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution to get current density of 20 mA cm(-2). In addition, alkaline electrolyzer equipped with CF@PeCo(2)P bifunctional electrodes only needs a cell voltage of 1.657 V to get water-splitting current density of 20 mA cm(-2). Even better, the electrolyzer can continuously electrolyze over 50 h with negligibly decreasing current density and the Faraday efficiency is close to 100% toward both HER and OER.

Here we report that excellent HER activity has been achieved with three-dimensional core/shell Co/Co3O4 nanosheets composed of a metallic cobalt core and an amorphous cobalt oxide shell. A benchmark HER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) has been achieved at an overpotential of similar to 90 mV in 1 M KOH. The excellent activity is enabled with the unique metal/oxide core/shell structure, which allows high electrical conductivity in the core and high catalytic activity on the shell. This finding may open a door to the design and fabrication of earth-abundant, low-cost metal oxide electrocatalysts with satisfactory hydrogen evolution reaction activities.									393	16	0	0	11	0	397			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000361252700054	26295904

However, the current electrocatalytic systems still exhibit a grand challenge to simultaneously boost their eNRR activity and selectivity under ambient conditions. Herein, we construct Pd/PdO electrocatalysts with a controlled oxygen level by a facile electrochemical deposition approach at different gas atmospheres. Theoretical calculation results indicate that the introduction of an oxygen atom into a pure Pd catalyst would modulate the electron density of the Pd/PdO heterojunction and thus influence the adsorption energy for nitrogen and hydrogen. The calculation results and experiments show that the Pd/PdO heterojunction with a moderate oxygen level (O-M) exhibits optimal eNRR performance with a high NH3 yield of 11.0 mu g mg(cat)(-1) and a large Faraday efficiency (FE) of 22.2% at 0.03 V (vs RHE) in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The moderate affinity of Pd to N in the Pd/PdO heterojunction and the inhibition of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can facilitate the breaking of the triple bond of N-2 and promote the protonation of N, which is confirmed by ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further disclose that the O-M catalysts prefer the distal association pathway during the eNRR process. This work opens a new way to construct heterostructures by controlling the oxygen level in other electrochemical fields.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000813151900001	35485647

The overpotential to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for HER on the selenized Ni-Fe foam was 181 mV, which was about 35 mV lower than that on the selenized Ni foam. Meanwhile, the iron doping NiSe2 catalyst anchored on the Ni-Fe foam had desirable stability for HER, and the overpotential to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) showed no obvious increase or even slight decrease after the stability measurement of 1 h. This work provides new insights for designing highly efficient non-noble transition metal-based electrocatalysts with excellent electrocatalytic performance in H-2 production.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2211-3797			WOS:000485104100004

Physicochemical characterization shows that this nonstoichiometric oxide possesses a spinel structure (Cu0.9Co2.1O4) and that it is also highly porous. FTIR spectroscopy indicates that the oxide is not decomposed in 5 M KOH at room temperature. The highest electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction is obtained when the electrode is prepared at 300 degrees C from a solution containing 0.5 M Cu(NO3)(2) . 2.5H(2)O and 1.0 M Co(NO3)(2) . 6H(2)O, with a catalyst loading of 52 mg cm(-2). The activity is reduced when an excess of either Co or Cu is present in the spinel oxide film beyond the stoichiometric ratio of the precursors, probably due to some phase change. Cyclic voltammetry indicates that a quasi-reversible Co-IV/Co-III surface redox transition occurs prior to the onset of oxygen evolution; this process is diffusion controlled at low OH-concentration and at high scan rate when [OH-] greater than or equal to 1 M. in the negative potential domain, a Cu-II/Cu-I surface redox transition is observed.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			0008-4042			WOS:000071518100019

Prepared with a simple hydrothermal method, the electrocatalyst is simultaneously active towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (overpotentials of 269, 301, and 312 mV at 100, 300, and 500 mA cm(-2) respectively) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (overpotentials of 82, 184, and 224 mV at 10, 100, and 200 mA cm(-2) respectively). Besides, when it was used as both cathode and anode for overall water splitting, the cell voltages at 10, 50, 100, and 200 mA cm(-2) are as low as 1.502, 1.642, 1.691, and 1.748 V, respectively. Furthermore, its cell voltage can remain constant at 50 mA cm(-2) for 12 h. The hierarchical heterostructure nanoarrays have some advantages acting as a bifunctional water-splitting electrocatalyst: (1) the high electrical conductivity of core material and high intrinsic activity of shell material can function simultaneously to compensate each other's drawbacks in the heterostructure; (2) since the sulfur within the core material will be selectively removed under OER potential window if directly contacting with the electrolyte, the shell material ensures the durability of this catalytic system by acting as a protective layer; (3) the superhydrophilic features of carbon cloth support is beneficial to the uniform growth of catalysts and accelerating mass transport.

Herein, a simple two-step procedure involving hydrothermal synthesis and subsequent annealing treatment was applied to synthesize porous WO2 hexahedral networks supported on nickel foam (WO2 HN/NF). The porous WO2 HN/NF composite reached a current density of -10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 48 mV for the HER and 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 300 mV for the OER in an alkaline electrolyte (1.0 M KOH). According to the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the high catalytic performance of this materials towards the HER could be attributed to the electronic structure of WO2 within the composite. Based on the remarkable electrochemical performance for both the HER and OER, we constructed a symmetric electrochemical water-splitting device. To afford a water-splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the alkaline water electrolyzer based on WO2 HN/NF needed a cell voltage of 1.59 V. In addition, this water electrolyzer remained stable over 48 h under continuous operation, which is as good as the performance of commercial Pt/C-based electrolyzers.									60	0	0	0	0	0	60			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000401930100021

Herein, N-doped carbon nanoflower embedded Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared using a simple and scalable method. The obtained electrocatalyst exhibits excellent activity and stability toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as well as a small potential gap of 0.72 V between the half-wave potential of ORR and the onset potential of OER potential, which is superior to the most previously reported bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts. The corresponding zinc-air battery exhibits good charged/discharge cycle performance as well as excellent discharge property, with a power density of 136.8 mW cm(-2) at 200 mA cm(-2) outperforming commercial Pt/C (96.5mW cm(-2)). Experiment results and density functional theory demonstrate that the high catalysis activity is mainly caused by the surface oxygen vacancy of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. This study sheds new light on the ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst design.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000743569700001

Herein, we report a bifunctional electrocatalyst synthesized by anchoring individually dispersed Ni single atoms on N-doped carbon nanosheets (Ni SAs-NC), which exhibits an outstanding overall performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Based on that, a conceptual urea-assisted rechargeable ZAB by coupling ORR with UOR of a low thermodynamic potential is demonstrated to have significantly decreased charging voltage and high urea elimination rate. The high bifunctional electrocatalytic activities of Ni SAs-NC endow the urea-assisted ZAB with a dramatically increased energy conversion efficiency of 71.8%, which is improved by 17.1% as compares with the conventional ZABs. The successful implementation of Ni SACs based urea-assisted rechargeable ZABs with an improved energy conversion efficiency may prompt ZAB technology towards practical applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000803806500001

The metal (M) doping strategy and inorganic/organic composite are two common strategies to improve the performance of electrocatalysts for overall water splitting (OWS). In this paper, two strategies are subtly used to prepare Mo-Ni3S2 quantum dots (QDs) with rich sulfur defects through Mon+ doping Ni3S2 and introduction of trisodium citrate by a two-step hydrothermal reaction. Results show that high sulfur defects can be controllably prepared as the lattice mismatch and active sites can be efficiently increased via Mon+ doping. Moreover, the introduction of trisodium citrate with carboxyl functional groups not only enhances the degree of sulfur defects around the metal center, changes the morphology of sulfide to distribute the active centers evenly, but also endow the metal center with strong valence changing ability with organic characteristics. The in situ Raman study reveals that O-C=O promotes the formation of the real active site M-OOH by the way of self-sacrifice during the OER process. Mo-Ni3S2 QDelectrocatalyst shows excellent performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotentials of 115 mV and 222 mV with very good chemical stability, superior than that of most of the reported materials. The OWS reaction can provide a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and 50 mA cm(-2), which only needs 1.53 V and 1.74 V with excellent industrial application prospects.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000634386900001	33885543

Interactions between well-defined active sites and supports are known to affect electron transfer and dramatically accelerate the reaction.

The interfacial reaction between molten steel and the CaP-Al2O3 MgO flux causes the aluminum pick-up from the liquid slag into the steel melt, resulting in a decrease in the oxygen content in the steel. The aluminum originating from the slag modifies the preexisting Mn-silicate inclusions into alumina-rich inclusions in the steel. Because the oxygen content in the steel decreases as it reacts with the CaO-Al2O3 MgO flux, the degree of supersaturation for alumina formation is too low to precipitate new-born alumina particles in the steel. By analyzing the population density function (PDF) results for inclusions, it can be observed that the growth of spinel-type inclusions occurs by the diffusion of aluminum and magnesium in the steel. On the other hand, the composition of the steel, as well as the evolution of inclusions, is negligibly changed when the CaO SiO2 MgO flux is added to the molten steel. Furthermore, the computational simulation for predicting the evolution of inclusions in molten steel during a continuous casting tundish process was carried out based on a refractory-slag-metal-inclusion (ReSMI) multiphase reaction model.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0915-1559	1347-5460		WOS:000738077200017

Electrochemical fixation of carbon dioxide in molten salts by using a Mo-plate cathode and a Ni-Cr anode is herein demonstrated to produce a cathodic Mo2C film and anodic oxygen. The molten salt electrochemical method offers an efficient modulation of thickness, adhesion and more importantly, interfacial confinement between the Mo2C film and Mo. The resulting Mo2C-Mo binder-free electrode hence shows enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution, as rationalized by the lower hydrogen adsorption energy at the Mo2C-Mo interface. The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide over a metal substrate is therefore a generic method integrating fixation of carbon dioxide and surface carbonization of a metal to functional films.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2052-1537		WOS:000653085700001

We found that after cycling within the double layer regime, up to 0.64 V vs RHE, there is a dramatic effect on the HER activity of gold nanoparticles: 128 mV drop of the overpotential, a decrease of 23 mV/dec for the Tafel slope as well as a nearly twenty times increase of the turn-over frequency (TOF). This enhanced activity is tentatively assigned to the formation of stepped like structures by the consecutive electrochemical cycling in the double layer region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, based on our previous attempts, we developed a bi-functional electro-catalyst utilizing co-doped manganese dioxide nanotube/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite to improve the catalytic activity toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A simple characterization of the morphology and physicochemical properties of various Co3O4/MnO2/CNT (CMC) composites was performed by employing various techniques (SEM, TEM, and XRD). More importantly, using CMC composite as the bifunctional cathode catalysts, we thoroughly investigated the effects of catalyst loading, bonding layer loading, and spraying area in catalyst layer (CL) on cell performance and charge-discharge cyclic ability for rechargeable zinc-air batteries. The highest peak power density of 400.3mWcm(-2) can be reached when the catalyst loading is 3mgcm(-2), the spraying area is 1cm(2) and the binder content is 80L. The rechargeable zinc-air batteries with the air electrodes containing different spraying areas and bonding layer loadings are stably operated for 22h at a high current density (100mAcm(-2)) and show a maximum voltage gap of 1.5V between charge and discharge voltages. All these optimization efforts are particularly important to future large-scale applications in ZAB.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000450111000016

In this work, an amorphous/crystalline layered manganese oxide (ACMO) was designed, and its unique amorphous/crystalline homogeneous structure activated its oxygen reduction activity with a positive half-wave potential of 0.81 V and oxygen evolution activity with a moderate overpotential of 407 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the amorphous/crystalline structure endowed ACMO with excellent stability. While employed as the air-electrode material for rechargeable zinc-air batteries, ACMO overcame the poor cycling stability of manganese oxide and cycled stably for 1000 cycles (approximate to 17 days) at 10 mA cm(-2). Besides, it delivered a high power density of 159.7 mW cm(-2) and a narrow voltage gap of 0.66 V. This work gives an insight into designing oxide materials with amorphous/crystalline structure and feasible guidance for harmonizing electrochemical activity and stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000819673600001	35686961

However, such a multiple-electron-involved reaction is complicated and kinetically slow, leading to high overpotential. Herein, OER is replaced with photoelectrocatalytic phenol oxidation reaction (PECPOR) that provides electrons for ECCO2R. In an integrated cell, ECCO2R is conducted on the cathode of Cu nanowires and PECPOR is performed on the anode of SnO2 and Sb coated TiO2 nanotubes. Significant improvement of ECCO2R into CO and hydrocarbons is realized when PECPOR is conducted at a high current density. The use of this integrated system results in the reduction of the specific energy consumption by a factor of 51.33%, compared with the utilization of two half-cells for individual ECCO2R and PECPOR. This study thus proposes a novel strategy to couple ECCO2R with PECPOR and eventually to tackle the problems of environmental pollution and energy crisis.									27	1	0	0	7	0	27			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000468778800009

Although major progress in finding effective catalysts has been made, the reasons for the activity enhancement in alkaline conditions remain to be elucidated. Herein, we report the fabrication of alloyed PdNi thin films as a tool to study the HOR and ORR reactions. Annealing of physically evaporated PdNi thin films at different temperatures results in different surface compositions and a range of HOR and ORR activities in 0.1 M KOH. Moreover, annealed samples were acid treated to remove the surface Ni and the HOR and ORR were investigated to elucidate the effect of surface and subsurface Ni. For the HOR, it was found that the addition of Ni decreases the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) of Pd through an electronic effect, which results in an increase in activity. In addition, it was found that the HOR activity was further increased by the bifunctional effect induced by surface Ni, which provides OHF adsorption sites. In contrast to HOR, it was concluded that surface Ni was disadvantageous for the ORR. However, subsurface Ni was found to induce an electronic effect on Pd that resulted in a somewhat improvement of the ORR kinetics by improving its oxygen desorption. These results provide insights for more tailored design of electrocatalysts in alkaline media by shedding new light on the mechanisms through which the HOR and ORR kinetics are improved in alkaline media.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000805428700004

Soft ionization were adopted to enable the fragment-free detection of volatiles generated from initial pyrolysis products. Temperature-evolved profiles of main products are visible via scanning of the ion current of individual compound measured during the pyrolysis processes. The obtained mass spectra of volatiles from pyrolysis of eight coal samples reveal predominantly molecular ions with four categories: alkenes, benzenes, phenols and diphenols. Furthermore, the analysis of different coal samples demonstrates that both alkyl and oxygen-containing groups attached on the benzene rings can reduce the peak temperatures of main products' evolution, and the effect of oxygen-containing group is stronger than that of alkyl group. The difference of peak temperature with maximum evolution, which is used as an indicator to measure the effect of the functional groups, were correlated with carbon content and volatile content of coal samples. The influence degree of functional groups on evolution temperature was found to be negative correlated with the carbon content and positive correlated with the volatile content, respectively. Based on the experimental observations and theoretical calculations, the overall results allowed to reveal the influence of the functional groups on the volatile organic compounds during coal pyrolysis. Analogous to reported setups with online studies of coal pyrolysis, PyPI-TOF MS may be a good option for monitoring the evolution characteristics and reaction pathways of coal pyrolysis process.									32	3	0	0	2	0	35			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000491885400021

Herein, ultrafine iridium oxide nanoclusters (approximate to 1 nm) are anchored on vanadium oxide support (IrO2/V2O5) via SOSI. The as made catalyst, with a unique distorted IrO2 structure, is discovered to significantly boost the performance for pH-universal oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Based on experimental results and theoretical calculations, the distorted IrO2 active sites with flexible redox states in IrO2/V2O5 server as electrophilic centers balance the adsorption of oxo-intermediates and effectively facilitate the process of O-O coupling, eventually propelling the fast turnover of water oxidation. As a result, IrO2/V2O5 demonstrates not only ultralow overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2) (266 mV, pH = 0; 329 mV, pH = 7; 283 mV, pH = 14) for OER, but also high-performance overall water electrolysis over a broad pH range, with a potential of mere 1.50 V (pH = 0), 1.65 V (pH = 7) or 1.49 V (pH = 14) at 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, SOSI can simultaneously secure the distorted active sites and thus remarkably improving the catalytic stability, making it a promising strategy to develop high-performance catalytic systems.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2198-3844		WOS:000754330500001	35152570

The OCP transient of the Zn/steel couple was divided into two stages. The first stage consisted of sacrificial dissolution of zinc. At low concentrations of NaCl (0.01 mol/dm(3)), the cathodic reaction on the couple surface was an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). With increasing concentrations of NaCl, the cathodic reaction at the steel surface changed from an ORR to the combination of an ORR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In addition, the precipitation morphology of zinc corrosion products differed as a function of NaCl concentration, suggesting that the pH distribution on the couple surface depended on the relationship between the cathodic reactions and the hydrolysis of Zn2+. Furthermore, the findings demonstrated that both the ORR and HER were inhibited at the steel underlying precipitated zinc corrosion products. The second stage consisted of steel corrosion. The location of the onset of steel corrosion was related to the pH distribution just prior to the extinction of the galvanic action of zinc.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0915-1559	1347-5460		WOS:000297491900020

Herein, a high-valence state tantalum (Ta) was incorporated into the pristine NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) by hydrothermal method. Interestingly, as revealed by structural characterizations, Ta doping causes the lattice expansion of LDH and electronic structure modification through electron transfer from Fe to Ta. DFT calculations further verified that the modulated electronic structure among Ni, Fe and Ta and the modified e(g) orbital of Ta induced by charge transfer are beneficial for the adsorption of OH species on Ta site in Ta-doped NiFe LDH and increasing the intrinsic metallic property of NiFe LDH. Consequently, the Ta site has lower overpotential compared with other sites on NiFe LDH including the pristine oxygen vacancies, which can improve the electrocatalytic activity for OER. Furthermore, the optimized Ta-NiFe LDH (0.5:6:1.5) exhibited a superior OER activity in contrast to bimetallic LDH, with a low overpotential of 260 mV to drive the current density of 50 mA.cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 58.95 mV.dec(-1). This work provides the theoretical basis for the enhancement of electrochemical OER activity by doping LDH with high-valence state foreign metal.									63	0	0	0	4	0	63			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000579752500034

The adsorption and desorption behaviors of the solvents on the graphene electrode surface were evaluated by an intrinsically surface-selective vibrational spectroscopy of sum frequency generation (SFG) during the ORR and OER. After the initial ORR depositing lithium peroxide (Li2O2) on the graphene electrode surface in a LiCIO4/DMSO solution, the SFG spectroscopy revealed that the subsequent OER oxidizing the Li2O2 preferentially proceeds at the interface between the Li2O2 and graphene rather than that between the Li2O2 and bulk solution. Therefore, the OER tends to reduce the electric conductivity between the Li2O2 and graphene by decreasing their contact area before a large part of the deposited Li2O2 was oxidized, which elucidates the origin of the high overpotential for the OER.									44	0	0	0	0	0	44			0002-7863			WOS:000451496800004	30398327

Currently, the development of high-performance carbon-based non-precious-metal (NPM) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts in acidic media still remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a highly active meso/microporous Fe-N-doped carbon nanofiber (Fe-N-CNF) catalyst prepared via a SiO2-protected shell mediated template method. The SiO2-protected shell not only restricts the free migration of iron species but also traps volatile gaseous substances during the pyrolysis process at high temperature, thus leading to a simultaneous optimization of both the surface functionalities and porous structures of the Fe-N-CNF catalysts. Compared to catalysts prepared without a SiO2-protected shell, the Fe-N-CNF catalysts exhibit a much enhanced ORR activity in an acidic medium, along with a superior long-term stability.									156	18	0	0	4	0	158			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000442262900028

Exploring electrocatalysts with high-efficiency and at low cost is vital to widespread utilization of this technology, but is still a big challenge. Here we report an effective strategy based on an expanding interlayer of layered structures to realize a great enhancement of the catalytic performance of the oxygen evolution reaction from water splitting. Well-defined nanobelts of layer structured cobalt benzoate hydroxide (Co(OH)(C6H5COO).H2O) are successfully prepared in terms of a simple hydrothermal process. Intercalation with benzoate ions induces the interlayer expansion of the cobalt hydroxide, which is useful for the accommodation of more electrolyte ions and favorable for their diffusion and transport. The as-prepared Co(OH)(C6H5COO)center dot H2O nanobelts need significantly smaller overpotential (similar to 0.36 V) to reach 10 mA center dot cm(-2) of current density compared with their Co(OH)2 (similar to 0.44 V) and Co3O4 (similar to 0.387 V) counterparts, and even favorably compare with most of the layered hydroxide-based electrocatalysts. Moreover, the Co (OH)(C6H5COO)center dot H2O nanobelts retain a much higher stability than the RuO2 reference in alkaline solution. This approach would be utilized to design and develop high-performance layered hydroxide-based electrocatalysts.									78	1	0	0	3	0	78			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000395494200041	28117968

Typically, the preparation of hierarchical TMPs involves the utilization of expensive or dangerous phosphorus sources, and, in particular, the understanding of topotactic transformations of the precursors to crystalline phases-which could be utilized to enhance electrocatalytic performance-remains very limited. We, herein, report a controllable preparation of CoP/CoP2 nanoparticles well dispersed in flower-like Al2O3 scaffolds (f-CoP/CoP2/Al2O3) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the HER and OER via the phosphorization of a flower-like CoAl layered double hydroxide precursor. Characterization by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) monitored the topotactic transformation underlying the controllable formation of CoP/CoP2 via tuning the phosphorization time. Electrocatalytic tests showed that an f-CoP/CoP2/Al2O3 electrode exhibited a lower onset potential and higher electrocatalytic activity for the HER and OER in the same alkaline electrolyte than electrodes of flower-like and powdered CoP/Al2O3. The enhanced electrochemical performance was experimentally supported by measuring the electrochemically active surface area. The f-CoP/CoP2/Al2O3 composite further generated a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.65 V when used as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting. Our results demonstrate that the preparation route based on the LDH precursor may provide an alternative for investigating diverse TMPs as bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting.									101	8	0	0	1	0	104			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000400865500037	28426060

Reaction products between BaO vapour and TiO2 (rutile) single crystals with different orientations, obtained at different temperatures, were investigated by XRD texture analysis, HRTENI and EELS. BaTiO3 was found in reactions performed at temperatures between 700 and 900 degrees C. Using Pt markers, in-diffusion of Ba ions was detected at 800 and 850 degrees C. Ti-rich phases were found after the reaction at 850 degrees C. At 900 degrees C, BaTiO3 forms at the Surface of the reaction layer with a well-defined orientation to the rutile substrate. In addition, pores and Ti-rich phases were identified at the BaTiO3-TiO2 interface. The pore formation is explained by an out-diffusion of titanium and oxygen ions from the BaTiO3-TiO2 interface through the reaction layer to the surface. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Comprehensive insight into the characteristics of the bimetallic Ir/Pt(poly) catalysts was obtained by a combination of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and classical electrochemical techniques. HER investigations have shown that the presence of spontaneously deposited Ir enhances the activity of bare Pt(poly) in alkaline solution. This was attributed to the heterogeneity of the active surface sites and to the electronic interaction between two metals in close contact which together facilitated the adsorption of the H intermediate species.

However, the overall OER performance of the transition metal oxides/hydroxides is largely jeopardized by their inherent low electrical conductivity. Mesoporous carbon has been a commonly used as a carrier material for these oxides/hydroxides to promote the electrical conductivity and provide a large specific surface area. However, most of the available mesoporous carbon carriers are amorphous. It has been very challenging to synthesize graphitic mesoporous carbon owing to the extremely high graphitization temperature. In this work, we report a new strategy used to prepare graphitic mesoporous carbon (GMC) by employing Fe metal as the graphitization catalyst. The graphitic carbon was obtained at 1000 degrees C, at which it retained its mesoporous structure. The conductivity of the obtained GMC was approximately 550 Sm-1, which was almost ten times higher than that of amorphous carbon. The GMC was further loaded with Fe-Ni hydroxide to fabricate the OER catalyst. The obtained catalyst showed good OER activity with an overpotential of 320 mV at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 57 mVdec(-1). The synthesized catalyst also possessed excellent stability, with almost no current drop even after 2000 cycles and at a constant voltage for 2 h.									30	3	0	0	1	0	31			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000382584300011	27312811

Here, we provide a comparative study of transition metals (TMs) and oxygen redox activities by directly accessing their oxidation states in Li-rich materials operated at very different current rates. Our data reveal that the oxidation of oxygen in the near-surface region is at the same level for electrodes cycled with a wide range of current rates, indicating a reaction gradient of lattice oxygen redox reactions. The oxidation process of lattice oxygen is found to be dynamically compatible with that of the TMs. Combining the results of first principles calculations and complementary experimental findings, we propose a detailed mechanism of structural distortion from octahedral Li to tetrahedral Li and the role of oxygen vacancy in Li+ diffusion. It is found that fast delithiation occurring at high current densities can easily cause local structural transformation, leading to a limited Li+ diffusion rate and consequently suppressing rate capability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000842604400001

The 2% Pt-1% H2WO4-based electrode was found to perform better than the 10% Pt-based electrode, and it was shown that the higher performance of the 2% Pt-1% H2WO4-based electrode is not related to its electrochemically active surface area or to the lowering of the activation energy of the ORR. The reaction order, the Tafel slope, the number of electrons involved in the reaction, and its rate-determining step are the same for both electrodes. Also, the mechanism of the ORR was found to be the same for the 10% Pt, the 2% Pt-1% H2WO4, and the platinum plate electrodes, indicating that the performance of the ORR on 2% Pt-1% H2WO4 is not related to a change in the reaction mechanism.									24	1	0	0	0	0	25			0013-4651			WOS:A1995QX76500008

SAs immobilized on oxygen vacancies (O-V) of MXene are predicted to have excellent catalytic performance; however, they have not yet been realized experimentally. Here Pt SAs immobilized on the OV of monolayer Ti3C2Tx flakes are constructed by a rapid thermal shock technique under a H2 atmosphere. The resultant Ti3C2Tx-PtSA catalyst exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, including a small overpotential of 38 mV at 10 mA cm-2, a high mass activity of 23.21 A mgPt (-1), and a large turnover frequency of 23.45 s(-1) at an overpotential of 100 mV. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations demonstrate that anchoring the Pt SA on the OV of Ti3C2Tx helps to decrease the binding energy and the hybridization strength between H atoms and the supports, contributing to rapid hydrogen adsorption-desorption kinetics and high activity for the HER.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000757543700001	35041435

The predictor for active ORR catalysis at 20 degrees C in alkaline solution is not applicable at 700 degrees C; the adsorbed water on the oxide catalyst surface is lost. In a SOFC, the ORR is split between the fuel and the oxygen electrode; in an alkaline air battery, the entire ORR occurs at the oxygen electrode. On the other hand, the OER reaction occurs by a similar process at the oxygen electrode in a R-SOFC at 700 degrees C and in an air battery or room-temperature fuel cell in an alkaline solution. A proposed condition for both the ORR and the OER occurring at the same oxoperovskite surface at 700 degrees C is a transition-metal cation of the perovskite at its equilibrium oxidation state at the operating temperature and pO(2).									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000425840500012

The proposed laser preparation mechanism of infocus and underfocus modes confirms that the laser induced stress and local high temperature controllably and rapidly prepared the patterned Ni/MoN/rNS electrodes in large size. The designed Ni/MoN/rNS presents outstanding catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low overpotential of 67 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a small overpotential of 533 mV to deliver 200 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) further verify that the constructed interface of Ni/MoN with small hydrogen absorption Gibbs free energy (Delta G(H*)) (-0.19 eV) and similar electrical conductivity between Ni and metallic MoN, which can explain the high intrinsic catalytic activity of Ni/MoN. Further, the constructed two-electrode system (-) Ni/MoN/rNS||Ni/MoN/rNS (+) is employed in an industrial water-splitting electrolyzer (460 mA cm(-2) for 120 h), being superior to the performance of commercial nickel electrode.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4				2198-3844		WOS:000750342400001	35112811

In this work, the MoS2 film electrode prepared by electrochemical deposition-annealing method was applied into the electrochemical reduction of Cr(VI), with the aim to suppress the over-potential of the reduction and improve the utilization of electrons. Results demonstrated that the 2H/1T' heterostructure of MoS2 enhanced the reduction efficiency of Cr(VI) up to 99% at a lower potential of -1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The insitu electrochemically generated hydrogen peroxide was found to play a critical role in accelerating the reduction of Cr(VI). Selective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via a two-electron pathway on the MoS2 cathode was responsible for the formation of hydrogen peroxide, where the MoS2 film electrode annealed at 700 degrees C can obtain a high productivity of 360 mu M hydrogen peroxide within 60 min. The plenty of preserved interfaces between 2H and 1 T' in the heterophase MoS2 were crucial to the selective electrocatalytic activity. In addition, this electrode also presented an excellent electrocatalytic activity in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which could form atomic hydrogen on the surface of cathode to facilitate the reduction of Cr(VI) under the anoxic condition. This study paves a novel pathway to in-situ deposit the MoS2 film electrode for the sustainable electrochemical reduction and treatment of Cr(VI)-containing wastewater.									12	0	0	0	4	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000600983600007

It was confirmed that the reactivity of the surrounding active sites is enhanced by the influence of isolated fluorine. The mechanism of this phenomenon was investigated, focusing on the electron migration and structural changes. In the MXene family, the Ti2C-based MXene best utilized the isolated fluorine effect.

However, the poor cycling performance and low round-trip efficiency deriving from the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics severely impede their practical application. Ingenious design of cathode catalysts is imperative to overcome these challenges. Here, we report ultrathin porous NiCo2O4 nanosheets with abundant oxygen vaccines as an efficient cathode catalyst toward both OER and ORR for Li-O-2 batteries. From combined theoretical calculation with experimental results, a unique enhanced solution mechanism is proposed in the ether-based electrolyte system. Benefiting from the porous 2D architecture of the cathode and the hierarchical toroidal products, the Li-O-2 batteries using NiCo2O4 cathodes deliver a high discharge capacity of 16 400 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) and an excellent cycling performance up to 150 cycles with a restricted capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1).									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2574-0962			WOS:000473116600033

These copies are widely distributed throughout the 4.6 Mbp genome with only one copy colocalizing with other PSII subunits, in marked contrast to all other psbA genes in all publicly available sequenced genomes. A clustering of two other psb genes around psbA3 (glr2322) is unique to Gloeobacter. We provide experimental proof for the transcription of a psbA3DC operon, encoding three of the five reaction center core subunits (D1, D2, and CP43). This is the first example of a transcribed gene cluster containing the D1/D2 or D1/D2/CP43 subunits of PSII in an oxygenic phototroph (prokaryotic or eukaryotic).

Here, it is proposed that, distinct from the most studied perovskites and spinels, Mn-based mullites with equivalent molar ratio of Mn3+ and Mn4+ provide a unique platform to maximize the role of Mn valence in facile ORR kinetics by introducing modest content of oxygen deficiency, which is also beneficial to enhanced catalytic activity. Accordingly, amorphous mullite SmMn2O5-delta nanoparticles with finely tuned concentration of oxygen vacancies are synthesized via a versatile top-down approach and the modest oxygen-defective sample with an Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio of 1.78, i.e., Mn valence of 3.36 gives rise to a superior overall ORR activity among the highest reported for the family of Mn-based oxides, comparable to that of Pt/C. Altogether, this study opens up great opportunities for mullite-based catalysts to be a cost-effective alternative to Pt/C in diverse electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems.									59	6	0	0	1	0	60			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000399455900012	28195444

Due to the electronic modulation effect, Cr-CoP/CP exhibits preeminent activity toward pH-universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with low overpotentials of 47, 131 and 67 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) in acidic, neutral, and alkaline medium, respectively. Cr-CoP/CP also shows outstanding performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 251 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte. And the voltages of 1.59 and 1.73 V are required to achieve 10 and 100 mA.cm(-2) for the Cr-CoP/CP(+,-) cell. Importantly, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations confirmed the activation process of active sites for transition metal phosphides. In the early stage of electrocatalysis, M-P bonds of transition metal phosphides undergo the transformation from covalent to ionic bonds, and finally form metal cations as active sites. This work is of great significance for understanding the process of electrochemical water splitting catalyzed by transition metal phosphides.									25	1	0	0	1	0	24			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707126000113

Herein, vertically aligned oxygenated-CoS2-MoS2 (O-CoMoS) heteronanosheets grown on flexible carbon fiber cloth as bifunctional electrocatalysts have been produced by use of the Anderson-type (NH4)(4)[CoIIMo(6)O(2)4H(6)]center dot 6H(2)O polyoxometalate as bimetal precursor. In comparison to different O-FeMoS, O-NiMoS, and MoS2 nanosheet arrays, the O-CoMoS heteronanosheet array exhibited low overpotentials of 97 and 272 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution for the HER and OER, respectively. Assembled as an electrolyzer for overall water splitting, O-CoMoS heteronanosheets as both the anode and cathode deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a quite low cell voltage of 1.6 V. This O-CoMoS architecture is highly advantageous for a disordered structure, exposure of active heterointerfaces, a "highway" of charge transport on two-dimensional conductive channels, and abundant active catalytic sites from the synergistic effect of the heterostructures, accomplishing a dramatically enhanced performance for the OER, HER, and overall water splitting. This work represents a feasible strategy to explore efficient and stable bifunctional bimetal sulfide electrocatalysts for renewable energy applications.									205	9	0	0	13	0	205			2155-5435			WOS:000431727300097

Nevertheless, the electrocatalysts with highly exposed active sites, fast electron/charge and mass transfer capabilities and long-term stability are still requisite. An efficient strategy of electrochemical activation is presented to fabricate the graphite-graphene Janus architecture and further stabilize the ultrafine Co3O4 nanoparticles for OER. The wrinkled and cross-linked graphene sheets that are in-situ formed and firmly bonded on the conductive graphite foil, act as pillared spacer for fast mass transport and anchoring sites for nucleation and growth of uniform distributed Co3O4 active species. The interlayer graphite contributes to the fast charge transfer as conductive substrate/framework. Benefitting from these merits, the resultant electrocatalyst achieves the outstanding OER performance with small overpotential (301 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), low Tafel slope (47 mV dec(-1)) and long-term durability in basic medium.

Herein, atomic-scale insight into the TiO2/Ti interfacial reaction was obtained by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. It is found that a large amount of oxygen in TiO2 diffuses into metallic Ti while limited Ti atoms in metallic Ti diffuse into TiO2 after the interfacial reaction, leading to a decrease in the concentration of oxygen in TiO2 as well as the formation of defective TiO2. With the enlightenment of the simulation results, defective TiO2 was efficiently synthesized by the TiO2/Ti interfacial reaction method, and its band gap was modulated from 3.26 to 2.54 eV. Additionally, chronoamperometry tests demonstrate that the synthesized defective TiO2 has an outstanding photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution. Therefore, the TiO2/Ti interfacial reaction method is an effective approach to reduce the band gap of TiO2 and enhance its photocatalytic activity.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2468-0230			WOS:000764898100003

Particularly, a three-dimensional (3D) porous architecture with a high surface area enhances electrolyte transport and the charge transfer efficiency. Herein, 3D porous microspheres composed of Ni nanoparticle-embedded bamboo-like carbon nanotubes (bCNTs) with a high surface area are prepared via spray pyrolysis and post-treatment with dicyandiamide (DCDA). During the heat treatment, the thermally stable MgO matrix restricts the crystal growth of the metallic Ni nanocatalysts, which controls the thickness and length of the bCNTs. A higher MgO ratio in the MgO-Ni microspheres leads to smaller metallic Ni nanocrystals, resulting in the growth of thinner and shorter bCNTs. Through thickness and length control of the bCNTs, morphology-optimized microspheres with a high surface area exhibit a high electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and improved oxygen redox activity, especially for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To compensate for the low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, flower-like Co3O4 nanoparticles are decorated on the microspheres by a simple bottom-up process. The resultant composite microspheres (Co/CNT_10Mg/Ni) exhibit superior ORR and OER activities in KOH-based electrolyte compared to those of Pt/C and RuO2, respectively. Furthermore, as an air cathode for ZABs, Co/CNT_10Mg/Ni shows lower polarization, higher power density (181 mW cm(-2)), and a more stable cycle performance (250 h) than those of the Pt/C-RuO2 system.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000714701500001

However, the layered hydrotalcite and brucite structure hydroxides usually possess inferior activity and poor stability. Herein, we developed layered cobalt-based serpentine nanosheets with a tuned electronic structure and stable active phase by using Ge-O and Si-O tetrahedron slabs to coordinate with Co-(O)OH octahedron slabs for efficient OER. Theoretical calculations reveal that Co-(O)OH octahedron slabs that coordinate with Ge-O tetrahedron slabs possess an optimal electronic structure and smaller reaction energy barriers for OER. Inspired by the calculations, the layered Co3Ge2O5(OH)(4), Co3Si2O5(OH)(4) and brucite Co(OH)(2) nanosheets are synthesized. The coordination of Ge-O tetrahedron decreases the size and crystallinity of Co-(O)OH octahedron slabs, simultaneously enhancing the stability of Co-(O)OH octahedron slabs during OER, thus improving the activity and stability. As a result, Co3Ge2O5(OH)(4) nanosheets present an outstanding OER activity (overpotential is 287 mV at 10 mA cm(-1), lower than that of Co3Si2O5(OH)(4) and Co(OH)(2)) and a remarkable stability for water splitting (working continuously more than 100 h without decay, much higher than that of Co(OH)(2) (<36 h)). The solar driven water splitting process achieves a high Faradaic efficiency of 98.8%, and the solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency is 7.2%. Such a strategy of tuning the electronic structure of Co-O(OH) octahedron by coordination with a Ge-O tetrahedron offers an effective method for designing highly efficient Co-based electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000799615000001

Herein, we fabricated cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanoparticles embedded in P and N co-doped carbon (PNC) matrix (CoP@PNC) to fully realize the high activity of CoP by maximizing its conductivity. Simply a carbonization coupled phosphidation approach was utilized where Co ions and organic ligands of Co-MOF were transferred into CoP and P and N co-doped carbon. The synthesized material shows an ideal electrical conductivity, excellent HER (overpotential of -84 mV and -120 mV@10 mA cm(-2) in acidic and alkaline medias, respectively) and OER (overpotential of 330 mV@10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media) performances. Further, CoP@PNC acts as a superior catalyst for both anode and cathode to catalyze overall water splitting and only requires an voltage of 1.52 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), superior to the noble-metal catalysts system (Pt/C//IrO2) and the reported noble-metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts.

Herein, we developed a hierarchically-structured self-supported electrode by directly electrodepositing low-crystallinity mesoporous NiGaFe hydroxide nanosheets onto macroporous nickel foam. Benefiting from the favorable mass transport ability of the hierarchical structure, abundant active sites and relatively high conductivity from low crystallinity, and optimized energetics for OER intermediates by introducing Ga and Fe on the basis of density functional theory simulations, the Ni0.65Ga0.30Fe0.05 hydroxide delivers superior OER electrocatalytic performances with very low overpotential (only 200 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (42 mV dec(-1)), outperforming most of the reported OER electrocatalysts. Moreover, this hybrid electrode exhibits a high faradaic efficiency of 96% and superior durability for 100 h at 20 mA cm(-2) without obvious degradation, showing great potential for application in low-cost and high-efficiency OER electrocatalysis.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000631985900023

In this paper, the variation of particle size and differences in microstructure of calcination and fragmentation were measured under different fluidizing medium in the same equipment. The effects of temperature, reaction rate, SO2 and CO(2 )atmosphere, firing exhaust gas atmosphere on the calcination and fragmentation of limestone with different properties in the fluidized bed were studied. It was found that the size evolution of larger limestone was more obvious than that of finer ones. Under the condition of fragmentation, the particle size evolution of limestone was more intense than that in calcination. The particle size was smaller under the condition of a higher reaction rate. Higher temperature can promote the calcination reaction and reduce the particle size to a certain extent. The coarser fragmentation products at high temperature may be related to the enhancement of agglomeration between particles. SO2 and CO2 can inhibit the fragmentation of limestone and lead to coarsening of products, which further confirms the main contribution of calcination reaction to limestone size evolution. The main chemical reaction in a given atmosphere is direct sulphation reaction and the primary fragmentation is restrained by the high concentration of CO2 in firing exhaust gas, which is more obvious in the oxygen-enriched exhaust gas.

It is well accepted that water oxidation on hematite is mediated by surface trapped holes, characterized to be the high valent -Fe=O species. However, the mechanism of the subsequent rate-limiting O-O bond formation step is still a missing piece. Herein we investigate the reaction order of interfacial hole transfer by rate law analysis based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement and probe the reaction intermediates by operando Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Distinct reaction orders of similar to 1 and similar to 2 were observed in near-neutral and highly alkaline environments, respectively. The unity rate law in near-neutral pH regions suggests a mechanism of water nucleophilic attack (WNA) to -Fe=O to form the O-O bond. Operando observation of a surface superoxide species that hydrogen bonded to the adjacent hydroxyl group by FT-IR further confirmed this pathway. In highly alkaline regions, coupling of adjacent surface trapped holes (I2M) becomes the dominant mechanism. While both are operable at intermediate pHs, mechanism switch from I2M to WNA induced by local pH decrease was observed at high photocurrent level. Our results highlight the significant impact of surface protonation on O-O bond formation pathways and oxygen evolution kinetics on hematite surfaces.									92	6	0	0	14	0	93			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000427203600019	29455534

We find that axion cooling suppresses nuclear reactions in carbon, oxygen, and silicon burning phases because of the extraction of the energy. As a result, larger amounts of the already synthesized neon and magnesium remain without being consumed to produce further, heavier elements. Even in the case with axion-photon coupling constant g(a gamma) = 10(-11) GeV-1, which is six times smaller than the current upper limit, the amount of neon and magnesium that remain just before the core-collapse supernova explosion is considerably larger than the standard value. This implies that we could give a more stringent constraint on g(a gamma) from the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in massive stars.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1550-7998	1550-2368		WOS:000361672600004

To further verify our assumption, the Fe3O4 microspherical nanomaterials were synthesized and the relative Fe-based catalyst (Fe-N-X/C) was successfully obtained by the ionothermal polymerization method. Fe-N-X/C exhibits an extraordinary oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in acidic solution, with a half-wave potential of only 25 mV negative shifts compared with Pt/C, while the power density is approximately 56% of that of Pt/C catalysts under the proton exchange membrane fuel cell testing condition.

Their catalytic activity depends on the electronic structure. In a spinel oxide lattice, each oxygen anion is shared amongst its four nearest transition metal cations, of which one is located within the tetrahedral interstices and the remaining three cations are in the octahedral interstices. This work uncovered the influence of oxygen anion charge distribution on the electronic structure of the redox-active building block Co-O. The charge of oxygen anion tends to shift toward the octahedral-occupied Co instead of tetrahedral-occupied Co, which hence produces strong orbital interaction between octahedral Co and O. Thus, the OER activity can be promoted by pushing more Co into the octahedral site or shifting the oxygen charge towards the redox-active metal center in CoO6 octahedra.									151	21	0	0	10	0	153			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000465413400041	30860633

In this study, In-situ generated trimetallic molybdate nanoflowers on Ni foam by a straightforward and time-saving solvothermal method assisted with microwave, not only bring synergistic effect into full play between multiple metals, but also construct a well-defined nanoflower-like structure accompanied by larger specific area (273.3 m(2) g(-1)) and smaller size than the pristine NiMoO4. The resulting Ni0.9Al0.1MoO4-NF requires a relatively low overpotential of 266 mV for OER at 10 mA cm(-2), which outperforms commercial RuO2 catalysts (274 mV). Such excellent performance compares favorably to most previously reported NiMoO4-based electrocatalysts for OER. This work not only supplies a facile method to construct a well-defined nanoflower-like structure on foam, but also broadens our horizons into the mechanism of OER in alkaline conditions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000651982300001	33861489

We report here a simple methodology to synthesize 2D thin nickel hydroxide/nickel oxyhydroxide sheets that show efficient activity towards OER. Further, by doping with a heteroatom, Fe, thinner sheets of nickel hydroxide/nickel oxyhydroxide are developed, which exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards OER with high durability. Fe-doped Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH requires only 200 mV overpotential to produce 10 mA/cm(2), whereas bare Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH needs 290 mV overpotential. Moreover, Fe-doped nickel hydroxide/nickel oxyhydroxide shows a minimal Tafel value of 48 mV/decade, which is even lower than RuO2/CC (82 mV/decade). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates that in the case of Fe-doped Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH, the Ni3+ signal enhances, which indicates the favourable stabilization of Ni3+ in the presence of Fe3+ dopant. Under electrochemical OER conditions, in Fe-doped Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH, Fe3+ species help to generate more Ni3+, which function as the active species. Fe0.06Ni0.94(OH)(2)/NiOOH shows long-term stability for at least 24 hours in alkaline medium. This work unveils a green strategy for Fe-doping in 2D thin sheets of Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH, which show improved electrocatalytic activity compared to bare Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH. The mechanism of OER activity enhancement after Fe-doping is proposed here.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			2196-0216			WOS:000475512500033

Herein, a high-performance OER catalyst of NiFe0.2 (oxy)hydroxide (NiFe0.2-OxHy) was developed through topotactic transformation of a Prussian blue analogue in an alkaline solution, which exhibits a low overpotential of only 263 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 35 mV dec(-1). Ex-situ/operando Raman spectroscopy results indicated that the phase structure of NiFe0.2-OxHy was irreversibly transformed from the type of alpha-Ni(OH)(2) to gamma-NiOOH with applying an anodic potential, while ex-situ/operando Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopic studies evidenced the in-situ production of abundant high-valent iron species under OER conditions, which effectively promoted the OER catalysis. Our work elucidates that the amount of high-valent iron species in-situ produced in the NiFe (oxy)hydroxide has a positive correlation with its water oxidation reaction performance, which further deepens the understanding of the mechanism of NiFe-based electrocatalysts.

However, lattice oxygen loss and derived structure distortion would induce serious capacity loss and voltage decay, further hindering its practical application. Herein, a novel Li-rich cathode material, O3-type Li-0.6[Li0.2Mn0.8]O-2, is developed with the pristine state displaying both a Li excess in the transition metal layer and a deficiency in the alkali metal layer. Benefiting from stable structure evolution and Li migration processes, not only can high reversible capacity (approximate to 329 mAh g(-1)) be harvested but also irreversible/reversible anionic/cationic redox reactions are comprehensively assigned via the combination of in/ex situ spectroscopies. Furthermore, irreversible lattice oxygen loss and structure distortion are effectively restrained, resulting in long-term cycle stability (capacity drop of 0.045% per cycle, 500 cycles). Altogether, tuning the Li state in the alkali metal layer presents a promising way for modification of high-capacity Li-rich cathode candidates.									36	2	0	0	2	0	37			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000595204400001	33270286

Substituting noble metal-based electrocatalysts by decidedly effective and low-cost metal-based oxygen electrocatalysts is imperative for the commercial application of these technologies. Herein, a novel strategy is presented to fabricate selenized and phosphorized porous cobalt-nickel oxide microcubes by using a sacrificial ZnO spherical template and the resulting microcubes are employed as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. The selenized samples manifest desirable and robust OER performance, with comparable overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (312 mV) as RuO2 (308 mV) and better activity when the current reaches 13.7 mA cm(-2). The phosphorized samples exhibit core-shell structure with low-crystalline oxides inside amorphous phosphides, which ensures superior activity than RuO2 with the same overpotential (at 10 mA cm(-2)) yet lower Tafel slope. Such a surface doping method possibly will provide inspiration for engineering electrocatalysts applied in water oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000508218900001	31691411

Exploring an alternative channel of evolution towards SNa Ia explosion								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				448	3			2100	2125		10.1093/mnras/stv084				APR 11 2015	2015	In this paper, we explore the possibility that isolated carbon-oxygen-WDs (white dwarfs) with mass smaller than the Chandrasekhar limit may undergo nuclear runaway and supernova (SNa) explosion, triggered by the energy produced by underbarrier pycnonuclear reactions between carbon and light elements. Such reactions would be due to left over impurities of the light elements, which would remain inactive until the WDs transit from the liquid to the solid state. We devise a simple formulation for the Coulombian potential and the local density in an ionic lattice affected by impurities and introduce it in the known rates of pycnonuclear reactions for multicomponent plasmas. Our semi-analytical results indicate that the energy generated by these pycnonuclear reactions exceeds the WD luminosity and provides enough energy to elementary cells of matter to balance the energy cost for C-ignition at much younger ages than the age of the Universe, even for WDs with masses as low as similar or equal to 0.85 M-circle dot. A thermonuclear runaway may thus be triggered in isolated WDs. The explosion would occur from few hundred thousand to a few million years after the WD formation in the mass interval 0.85-1.2 M-circle dot.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000351507000010

Electrocatalytic test results indicate that Co-OMS-2 has excellent catalytic activity (V-onset: 0.905 V, V-half: 0.806 V vs. RHE), rapid reaction kinetics, and favorable stability. The obvious improvement in catalytic behavior correlates with the enhancement of conductivity and oxygen adsorption capacity studied by specific experiments. On the one hand, ions fill the tunnels as efficient electron conduits to accelerate the electron transfer and interconversion of Mn3+/ Mn4+ couple enhance intrinsic conductivity of OMS-2. On the other hand, ions in the tunnels act as regulatory substances to regulate the oxidation state requirements and coordination geometry of MnO6 octahedron, which is helpful to stabilize Mn3+ and enhance O-2 adsorption. It is essential to understand the mechanisms that regulate the oxygen reduction activity of manganese oxides by filling the metal cation. And the roles of Co-ion in the tunnels of OMS-2 for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were studied in depth. All the experimental studies are confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) computations. This work shows for the first time there is an explicit correlation between OMS-2 and tunnel cation for the ORR in alkaline medium.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000566454400001

A synergetic effect has been detected since the combination of copper and ZrO2 significantly facilitates the methanol decomposition with the facile evolution of H-2 and CO species at much lower desorption temperature. In conjunction with DRIFTS and H-2-TPD measurements of the Cu/ZrO2 sample reduced at elevated temperatures, methanol decomposition over Cu/ZrO2 is suggested to occur primarily on ZrO2 with the aid of the presence of oxygen anions and oxygen vacancies generated by species-spillover between copper and zirconia. The interface between copper and zirconia is also evidenced to be crucial to the decomposition of methanol, with the main role of metallic Cu being to provide sites for H, removal by efficiently recombining the hydrogen atoms formed during the dehydrogenation of species located on zirconia.

The temperature at which the CO was desorbed from the catalyst surface (detected by recovery in the H-2-D-2 exchange activity of the catalyst) was used as a descriptor for the CO binding energy to the active site. The differences in the CO desorption temperature between the different catalysts showed that the rhodium sulfide active site is not metallic rhodium. Using density functional theory, the binding energy of CO to the Rh sites in rhodium sulfide is found comparable to the binding energy on Pt. Coupled with experiment this supports the proposition that rhodium rather than sulfur atoms in the rhodium sulfide are the active site for the hydrogen reaction. This would indicate the active sites for hydrogen evolution/oxidation as well as oxygen reduction (determined by other groups using X-ray absorption spectroscopy) may be the same.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0743-7463			WOS:000336414500039	24773379

Electrolyzers are used to generate hydrogen, and fuel cells consume hydrogen as a fuel. These devices rely on hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions. Catalysts are required to accelerate the reactions. Pt is the best hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction (HOR/HER) catalyst to date. However, the scarcity of Pt hinders its applications. Various processes have been developed to increase the catalyst activity in order to reduce the amount of Pt, or to develop non-precious metal catalysts to replace Pt. In this review, we focus on electrocatalysts for the hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions. The reaction mechanism, factors influencing the catalyst activity, and the influence of the electrolyte (acid vs. base) are discussed. The recent advances in catalyst development, especially of non-precious metal catalysts, are also summarized. Due to the different reaction conditions and catalytic activities associated with the different electrolytes, the catalysts are classified into two categories: active in acid or in base.									118	27	0	0	10	0	120			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000383102100007

Although some advanced synthetic methods have been reported, the development of a facile and general strategy to fabricate porous hollow nanostructures of transition metal chalcogenides, especially with enhanced electrocatalytic performance, still remains highly challenged. Herein, we report a facile chemical transformation strategy to prepare nanoporous hollow Co3S4 nanosheets via the anion exchange reaction of Co(OH)(2) with sulfide ions. The chemical transformation mechanism involves the as-formed layer of nanoporous cobalt sulfide on Co(OH)(2) driven by the anion-exchange-reaction and lattice mismatch induced quick strain release, a following diffusion-effect-dominated core-shell hollow intermediate with hollow interiors, and subsequent Ostwald ripening growth of hollow nanosheets at elevated temperatures. This anion-exchange strategy of transition metal hydroxides with chalcogenide ions is also suitable for fabricating nanoporous hollow nanosheets of other metal chalcogenides (e.g., CoSe2, CoTe2, CdS, and NiS). The as-prepared nanoporous hollow Co3S4 nanosheets are found to be highly active and stable for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction.									182	8	0	0	5	0	183			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000343952600130	25283816

Lithium-excess, cation-disordered rocksalt (DRX) materials are a new class of transition metal oxides that display high capacity and environmental friendly composition. These materials achieve their high capacities partially through oxygen redox, which leads to oxygen loss and detrimental reactivity with the electrolyte. It has previously been shown that oxygen loss can be suppressed by partial substitution of the lattice oxygen for fluorine, but the explicit mechanism behind this effect remains unknown. In this work, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and titration mass spectrometry are used to quantify the primary electrochemical reactions occurring during the first cycle in DRX materials. Comparing a DRX oxide and a DRX oxyfluoride, it is shown that fluorination limits oxygen redox and suppresses oxygen loss. Additionally, DEMS is coupled with fluoride-scavenging to demonstrate that small amounts of fluorine dissolve from DRX oxyfluorides during the first cycle. Finally, these techniques are extended over the first several cycles, demonstrating that CO(2)evolution persists and fluoride dissolution continues to a diminishing extent during the first few cycles. These findings motivate surface modifications to control interfacial reactivity and improve long-term cycling.									19	1	0	0	2	0	19			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000554488600001

Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) as a promising OER electrocatalyst have attracted more attention due to their surface reconstruction to form active oxyhydroxides layer during the continuous OER process. However, the research on how to optimize the surface reconstruction of PBAs is still lacking. Herein, Ni-doped Co-Fe PBAs nanocubes were designed as an efficient OER catalyst to promote surface-selective etch and reconstruction into metal oxyhydroxides during the activation process. Structural characterization and analysis indicated that the incorporation of Ni enhanced the surface reconstruction, and the resulted metal oxyhydroxides acted as the major active sites for OER electrocatalysis. The rate-determining step is converted to the final O-2 release step after the activation process, which significantly accelerates OER kinetics. As a result, the NiCo-Fe PBAs electrode exhibits excellent catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 274 mV under a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1).									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000618190800033

In this work, a time- and energy-saving approach to directly grow NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanosheets on nickel foam under ambient temperature and pressure is reported. These NiFe-LDH nanosheets are vertically rooted in nickel foam and interdigitated together to form a highly porous array, leading to numerous exposed active sites, reduced resistance of charge/mass transportation and enhanced mechanical stability. As self-supported electrocatalyst, the representative sample (NF@NiFe-LDH-1.5-4) shows an excellent large-current-density catalytic activity for OER in alkaline electrolyte, requiring low overpotentials of 190 and 220 mV to reach the current densities of 100 and 657 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 38.1 mV dec(-1). In addition, NF@NiFe-LDH-1.5-4 as an overall water splitting electrocatalyst can stably achieve a large current density of 200 mA cm(-2) over 300 h at a low cell voltage of 1.83 V, meeting the requirement of industrial hydrogen production. This exceedingly simple and ultrafast synthesis of low-cost and highly active large-current-density OER electrocatalysts can propel the commercialization of hydrogen producing technology via water splitting.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000717620100001	34766722

However, the reasonable design of the two to facilitate OER collaboratively is challenging. Herein, a convenient and novel one-step molten salt decomposition strategy is proposed to fabricate segregated-Mo doped nickle nitrate hydroxide with substantial GBs on MoNi foam (Mo-NNOH@MNF). When processed in molten salt, the Mo species on the conductive substrate migrates unevenly to the surface of Mo-NNOH@MNF, which not only induces the formation of abundant GBs to modulate electronic structure, but also improves the intrinsic activity as high-valence dopants, synergistically elevating OER activity. As verification, the optimized MoNNOH@MNF-10h exhibits low overpotential of 150 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which can be attributed to the reduced valence charge transition energy of Ni by high-valence Mo dopant, coupled with the finetuning of d-band center bond and corresponding local electron density by induced GBs and Mo doping, as DFT calculations revealed. Moreover, the intrinsic robustness and strong adhesion ensure the longterm stability of 6 h at 500 mA cm(-2). This work provides a promising molten salt decomposition approach to synthesize advanced materials with unique structures. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

By using the ordered mesoporous structure as a model system and afterward elevating the optimal catalysts composition, it is shown that, with a simple electrochemical activation step, the performance of nickel cobalt oxide can be significantly enhanced. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results indicated that charge transfer resistance increases for Co3O4 spinel after an activation process, while this value drops for NiO and,especially for CoNi mixed oxide significantly, which confirms the improvement of oxygen evolution kinetics. The catalyst with the optimal composition (Co/Ni 4/1) reaches a Current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with an overpotential of a mere 336 mV and a Tafel slope of 36 mV/dec,outperforming benchmarked and other reported Ni/Co-based OER. electrocatalysts. The catalyst also demonstrates outstanding durability for 14 h and maintained the ordered mesoporous Structure.The cyclic voltammograms along with the electrochemical measurements in Fe-free KOH electrolyte suggest that the activity boost is attributed to the generation of surface Ni(OH)(2) species that incorporate Fe impurities from the electrolyte: The incorporation of Fe into the structure is also confirmed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry.									75	4	0	0	0	0	75			1944-8244			WOS:000404807200020	28582615

Metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived electrocatalyst materials have become a rapidly rising research area for solving the challenges associated with energy conversion technologies. This is due to unique features of MOF materials such as unique composition, structural diversity, large surface area, tunability, highly porous nature, and the secondary building units. They are often crystalline, ordered, and uniform solids, which are beneficial to engineering valuable features in rational ways. These advantages over other electrocatalysts have enabled MOFs to be notably utilized to overcome the sluggish kinetics and intrinsic thermodynamic barriers. Based on this, numerous attention has been devoted to the employment of various MOFs in HER, OER, ORR and water splitting. However, a comprehensive dataset showing the empirical analysis of these electrocatalysts for these applications becomes necessary to understand how closer or farther to industrial/commercial applications. The realization of this will enable the development of novel electrocatalysts and electrolyte media to successfully overcome the intrinsic barriers of meeting the industrial and commercial expectations in the field. To efficiently describe this empirical analysis, this study started by presenting the value of data with the momentous needs and reasons for this analysis. Since the study uses the electrocatalytic performance of different MOF-derived electrocatalysts, different experimental parameters for evaluating the performance of these MOF-derived were described. It critically compares different MOF-derived electrocatalysts based on the mechanistic criteria for energy -conversion involving rate-determining steps (RDS) using Tafel, Heyrovsky, and Volmer slopes of-30,-40, and-120 mV/dec, respectively. The overpotential or half-wave potential of these catalysts was also evaluated for further recommendations. A borderline of 50 h stability tests was drawn to gain more insight into the stability/durability performance and prospects of MOF-derived materials for HER, OER and ORR, which reflects that many of these materials performed below 50 h steady-state (durability) tests. This study further discussed some features of stability and stability under electrochemical conversion conditions. Also, in term of electrolytes for research on energy conversion, 1 M KOH, 0.1 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4, and 1 M KOH were prevalent, accounting for 73.53%, 88.24%, 58.49%, and 67.39% for OER, ORR, HER, and overall water splitting, respectively.

Leveraging these advances requires efficient and earth-abundant electrocatalysts to accelerate the kinetically sluggish hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). A large number of advanced water-splitting electrocatalysts have been developed through recent understanding of the electrochemical nature and engineering approaches. Specifically, strain engineering offers a novel route to promote the electrocatalytic HER/OER performances for efficient water splitting. Herein, the recent theoretical and experimental progress on applying strain to enhance heterogeneous electrocatalysts for both HER and OER are reviewed and future opportunities are discussed. A brief introduction of the fundamentals of water-splitting reactions, and the rationalization for utilizing mechanical strain to tune an electrocatalyst is given, followed by a discussion of the recent advances on strain-promoted HER and OER, with special emphasis given to combined theoretical and experimental approaches for determining the optimal straining effect for water electrolysis, along with experimental approaches for creating and characterizing strain in nanocatalysts, particularly emerging 2D nanomaterials. Finally, a vision for a future sustainable hydrogen fuel community based on strain-promoted water electrolysis is proposed.									275	8	0	0	20	0	277			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000465600000007	30773741

One of the critical bottlenecks for the reaction is the development of highly efficient electro-catalyst to decrease the high overpotentials of four-electron transfer process of OER. Recently, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been widely investigated among the most promising electrocatalysts for OER due to their high intrinsic activity, excellent stability as well as low-cost. However, it remains unclear how the exposed facet of the LDHs affects their electrocatalytic activity. Here we elucidate the active edge facet of LDHs towards OER by combining the finely control of edge facet ratio coupled with molecular probe method and computational calculation. The LDHs with higher edge facet area ratio show superior activity with low onset potential as well as decreased Tafel slope. The active edge site is further proved by blocking the unsaturated edge sites with cyanate probe anion, of which the adsorption largely inhibits OER activity. Furthermore, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculation, two-dimensional map of theoretical overpotentials as a function of Gibbs free energy reveals that the edge (100) facet exhibits a much higher OER activity than basal plane (001) facet.(c) 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Herein, a promising lattice-matching growth strategy is demonstrated for conductive MOF/layered double hydroxide (cMOF/LDH) heteronanotube arrays with highly ordered hierarchical porous structures enabling an ultraefficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). CoNiFe-LDH nanowires are used as interior template to engineer an interface by inlaying cMOF and matching two crystal lattice systems, thus conducting a graft growth of cMOF/LDH heterostructures along the LDH nanowire. A class of hierarchical porous cMOF/LDH heteronanotube arrays is produced through continuously regulating the transformation degree. The synergistic effects of the cMOF and LDH components significantly promote the chemical and electronic structures of the heteronanotube arrays and their electroactive surface area. Optimized heteronanotube arrays exhibit extraordinary OER activity with ultralow overpotentials of 216 and 227 mV to deliver current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 34.1 mV dec(-1), ranking it among the best MOF and non-noble-metal-based catalysts for OER. The robust performance under high current density and vigorous gas bubble conditions enable such hierarchical MOF/LDH heteronanotube arrays as promising materials for practical water electrolysis.									73	6	0	0	1	0	74			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000608229000001	33458883

Here, we present an excellent OER catalytic system consisting of pulse-electrodeposited Ir/Ni oxides in Fe3+-spiked 1 M KOH. In pure 1 M KOH electrolyte, the optimized catalyst, which had an Ir:Ni atom ratio of 1:1.49, could catalyze 10 mA/cm(2) of O-2 production at a small overpotential (eta) of 264 mV. Remarkably, we found that its OER performance could be significantly improved by adding 0.3 mM Fe3+ into the electrolyte. At an eta of just 343 +/- 3 mV, a huge current of 500 mA/cm(2) was achieved. Furthermore, this catalytic system exhibited a small Tafel slope of 31 mV/dec and a large iridium mass-normalized current of 1260 mA/mg(Ir) at eta = 280 mV. We also discovered that the durability of the Ir/Ni oxide catalyst during OER (at 10 mA/cm(2) with eta < 280 mV) could be maintained for more than 4.5 days by simply spiking Fe3+, Ir3+, and Ni2+ into the KOH electrolyte. The figures-of-merit in this work, in terms of both activity and stability, compare favorably against values from several state-of-the-art catalysts. Hypotheses for the outstanding performance of the Ir/Ni catalyst are proposed and discussed.									42	0	0	0	0	0	42			1944-8244			WOS:000378984800014	27323252

Thus far, tremendous scientific efforts have been applied to improve the catalytic activity of the catalyst, whereas the scale-up fabrication of morphology-controlled catalysts while maintaining their desired performance remains a great challenge. Herein, we present, a facile and scalable approach to fabricate the macroporous Ni2P/nickel foam electrode. The obtained electrocatalyst exhibits superior bifunctional catalytic activity and durability, as evidenced by a low overpotential of 205 and 300 mV required to achieve a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. Such a spray-based strategy is believed to widely adapt for the preparation of electrodes with uniform macroporous structures over a large area (e.g., 100 cm(2)), which provides a universal strategy for the mass fabrication of high performance water-splitting electrodes.									55	3	0	0	2	0	55			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000412149800044	28875698

The nanocomposite electrocatalyst Ni-Fe-P-FeMnO3/NF presents a more remarkable electrocatalytic performance than Pt/C noble metal catalysts towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which demands a quite low overpotential of 16.62 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) current density in 1 M KOH. The prepared Ni-Fe-P-FeMnO3/NF electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity as well, which requires only 297 mV and 219 mV of overpotential at 50 mA cm(-2) and 10 mA cm(-2) current density, respectively. Moreover, the overall water splitting activity of Ni-Fe-P-FeMnO3/NF as both anode and cathode achieves a low potential of 1.63 V (vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, OER is a four-electron and slow reaction, which is also a bottleneck for water splitting. To find the role of Pt and PtO2 on the OER in the presence of Fe, the electrochemistry of Pt foil and PtO2 is investigated in the absence/presence of K2FeO4 as a soluble Fe salt at pH approximate to 13. After the addition of K2FeO4, a remarkable increase in the OER is recorded in the presence of Pt or PtO2. The obtained catalysts were characterized by operando visible spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, electron-spin resonance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical methods. KOH solutions usually contain Fe and/or Ni impurities. It is found that neither Pt nor PtO2 is an OER catalyst in a Ni/Fe-free KOH, and even at an overpotential of 570 mV in purified KOH (pH approximate to 13), no clear OER was observed.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000731590400001	34902241

In situ transmission electron microscopy at atmospheric pressure provides a great opportunity to uncover dynamic structure and composition changes of ternary alloy nanoparticles. In this work, the atomic-scale elemental diffusion and surface reconstruction of ternary octahedral Pt2CuNi alloy nanoparticles in an oxidative environment at elevated temperatures are reported. Combining them with multiple characterizations and numerical simulation, it is revealed that the oxidative condition induced the lattice atom diffusion, which leads to the NiOx major/CuOx minor surface oxide layers accompanied by surface restructuring and lattice rearrangement. Further analysis helped to establish the numerical model and visualize the atom distribution variation in the restructuring process. Also, the model catalytic test of the oxygen reduction reaction demonstrates that the catalytic performance of ternary Pt2CuNi alloy nanoparticles can be tuned through oxidative treatment.									22	1	0	0	1	0	22			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000461532700030

For this purpose, amorphous MnOx films anodically deposited on F:SnO2/glass and annealed at different temperatures (to improve film adherence and crystallinity) were tested in neutral and alkaline electrolytes. Differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy showed that the anodic current correlated well with the onset of the expected oxygen evolution, where in 1 M KOH, the anodic current of crystalline alpha-Mn2O3 films was determined to onset at an overpotential (eta) of 170 mV(RHE) (at J = 0.1 mA/cm(2)) with current densities of ca. 20 mA/cm(2) at eta = 570 mVRHE. Amorphous MnOx films heated at 573 K (MnOx-573 K) were found to improve their adherence to F:SnO2/glass substrate after heat treatment with a slight crystallization detected by Raman spectroscopy. The onset of water oxidation of MnOx-573 K films was identified at eta = 230 mV(RHE) (at J = 0.1 mA/cm(2)) with current densities of ca. 20 mA/cm(2) at eta = 570 mV(RHE) (1 M KOH). The least active of the investigated manganese oxides was Mn3O4 with an onset at eta = 290 mVRHE (at J = 0.1 mA/cm2) and current densities of ca. 10 niA/cm(2) at eta = 570 mV(RHE) (1 M KOH). In neutral solution (1 M KPi, a similar tendency was observed with the lowest overpotential found for alpha-Mn2O3 followed by MnOx-573 K and Mn3O4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that after electrochemical treatment, the surfaces of the manganese oxide electrodes exhibited oxidation of Mn II and Mn III toward Mn IV under oxygen evolving conditions. In the case of alpha-Mn2O3 and MnOx-573 K, the manganese oxidation was found to be reversible in KPi when switching the potential above and below the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) threshold potential. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images displayed the presence of an amorphous phase on top of all manganese oxide films here tested after oxygen evolution. The results indicate that structural changes played an important role in the catalytic activity of the manganese oxides, in addition to oxidation states, a large variety of Mn-O bond lengths and a high concentration of oxygen point defects. Thus, compared to Mn3O4, crystalline alpha-Mn2O3 and MnOx-573 K are the most efficient catalyst for water oxidation in the manganese oxygen system.									388	9	0	0	30	0	392			1932-7447			WOS:000338693600002

In this work, with the introduction of the plasmonic effects by design of the Au-MnO2 hybrid catalysts, it is demonstrated that this photophysical phenomenon could largely promote the confinement of the outer electrons of Mn cations by plasmonic "hot holes" generated on gold surface. These "hot holes" work as the effective electron trapper to form the active Mnn+ species which could provide active sites to extract electrons from OH- and eventually facilitate the electrochemical OER catalysis under low laser power. By tuning the laser intensity from 100 to 200 mW, the overpotential is decreased from 0.38 to 0.32 V, which is comparable to IrO2 and RuO2 catalysts. These findings may provide insights into activation of plasmon-promoted electrocatalysis under low power laser irradiation/treatment and the design of novel composite electrocatalysts.									48	0	0	0	2	0	48			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000440283900012

Compared with the benchmark IrO2, the higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance brought by IrOxOHy was normally considered to be associated with the pristine Ir-III-containing species. However, such a conclusion conflicts with the opinion that high-valence metals can create excellent OER activity. To resolve such contradictions, we synthesized a pure amorphous Lu1.25IrOxOHy (Lu = lutetium) catalyst in this work. In combination with the comprehensive electrochemical evaluation in alkaline and acidic media, ex situ Ir L3-edge and O K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed that the ultrahigh OER performance of reconstructed IrOx/Lu1.25IrOxOHy in acidic media was identified to be driven by the more d-hole-containing electronic state of Ir-V created by cationic vacancies. The pristine properties of Ir-III-containing Lu1.25IrOxOHy conversely inhibit the OER activity in alkaline media. Additionally, the high edge-shared [IrOx]-[IrOx] motif proportion structure in amorphous Lu1.25IrOxOHy achieves a stable OER process, which exhibits a high S-number stability index similar to IrO2. We demonstrate that the key factor of the edge-shared [IrOx]-[IrOx] motif with cationic vacancies in could rationally reveal the source for most of the high-performance Ir-based materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000820956800001	35695736

In this work, three-dimensional NiCo2O4 nanowire-decorated NiO nanosheets (NiO@NiCo2O4) on a Ni foam were fabricated by a two-step solvothermal process. The product exhibited efficient catalytic performance for Li-O-2 batteries. This three-dimensional NiO@NiCo2O4 hierarchical structures grown on Ni foam forms a porous catalytic surface for the uniform growth of discharge products. First, NiCo2O4 is a promising catalyst for improving the oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) processes for the Li-O-2 batteries. Second, NiO can provide a porous scaffold for the further deposition of NiCo2O4 nanowires to avoid their aggregation. Furthermore, NiO can promote the decomposition of by-products containing carbonate/carboxylate species. As a result, the Li-O-2 system with NiO@NiCo2O4 as a carbon-free cathode showed a maximum in-depth-specific discharge capacity of 9361.4 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) and 176 cycles of stability under a limited capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g(-1). The reported strategy regarding a multicomponent hierarchical structure may provide a new approach for effective electrocatalyst design for Li-O-2 batteries.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000712440800001

The porous structure can facilitate rapid O-2 and electrolyte diffusion, as well as forming a continuous conductive network throughout the whole energy conversion process. It shows a favorable cycle performance in the full discharge/charge model, owing to the high catalytic activity of the Pt-Gd alloy composite and 3D porous nickel foam structure. Specially, excellent cycling performance under capacity limited mode is also demonstrated, in which the terminal discharge voltage is higher than 2.5 V and the terminal charge voltage is lower than 3.7 V after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2).

The Influence of Sulfur on Dephosphorization Kinetics Between Bloated Metal Droplets and Slag Containing FeO								METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS B-PROCESS METALLURGY AND MATERIALS PROCESSING SCIENCE				48	5			2343	2353		10.1007/s11663-017-1002-0				OCT 2017	2017	The bloating behavior of metal droplets and the dephosphorization behavior of bloated droplets at 1853 K (1580 A degrees C) were investigated using X-ray fluoroscopy coupled with constant volume pressure change measurements and chemical analysis of quenched samples. The effect of sulfur content on dephosphorization kinetics was studied during the decarburization period. The slag foamed during the reaction forming a foamy layer over a dense layer. After a short incubation period, the droplets became bloated due to internal decarburization. The bloated droplets floated from the dense slag into the foamy slag. The behavioral changes are directly related to the effect of sulfur on the incubation time for swelling. The dephosphorization reaction was very fast; droplets with low sulfur contents experienced phosphorus reversion shortly after entering the foamy slag, while those with higher sulfur content took a longer time to swell and went through reversion before they entered the foam. The dephosphorization rate and maximum phosphorus partition were higher at lower CO evolution rates because the dynamic interfacial oxygen potential increased with the decreasing oxygen consumption rate. The rate controlling step for dephosphorization was initially a combination of mass transport in both the metal and the slag. As the iron oxide in the slag was depleted, the rate control shifted to mass transport in slag.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000408947600013

The impact of cycling temperature, electrolyte concentration, and cycling history on these different electrodes resulted in alterations in the usable capacities of the electrodes and/or the efficiency of the charging reaction. The cobalt level in the active material, the KOH concentration of the electrolyte, and the cycling temperature were all found to impact the position of the charging peaks of the beta and the gamma charging reactions. The position of the oxygen evolution characteristic was found to be mainly a function of the cycling temperature. The findings of these studies resulted in recommendations for selecting certain cell design factors and charging protocols that will lead to improved cycle lives and higher levels of usable cell capacities.

Herein, a facile and low-cost in situ self-assembly strategy for preparing a Ce-doped NiFe-LDH nanosheets/nanocarbon (denoted as NiFeCe-LDH/CNT, LDH = layered double hydroxide and CNT = carbon nanotube) hierarchical nanocomposite is established for enhanced OER, in which the novel material provides its overall advantageous structural features, including high intrinsic catalytic activity, rich redox properties, high, flexible coordination number of Ce3+, and strongly coupled interface. Further experimental results indicate that doped Ce into NiFe-LDH/CNT nanoarrays brings about the reinforced specific surface area, electrochemical surface area, lattice defects, and the electron transport between the LDH nanolayered structure and the framework of CNTs. The effective synergy prompts the NiFeCe-LDH/CNT nanocomposite to possess superior OER electrocatalytic activity with a low onset potential (227 mV) and Tafel slope (33 mV dec(-1)), better than the most non-noble metal-based OER electrocatalysts reported. Therefore, the combination of the remarkable catalytic ability and the facile normal temperature synthesis conditions endows the Ce-doped LDH nanocomposite as a promising catalyst to expand the field of lanthanide-doped layered materials for efficient water-splitting electrocatalysis with scale-up potential.									183	12	0	0	13	1	185			1944-8244			WOS:000426143900031	29384365

Many LDH properties affecting the OER have been studied to reach the optimal efficiency, but no systematic studies concerning the influence of the interlayer space have been developed. In this context, these materials allow a large tunability in their chemical composition enabling the substitution of the interlayer anion and therefore modifying exclusively the basal space. Here, we synthesize by anion exchange reactions a surfactant-intercalated family of NiFe-LDHs with increasing basal spacing ranging from 8.0 to 31.6 angstrom (one of the largest reported so far for a NiFe-LDH), while the electrochemical OER performance of this family of compounds was explored to analyze the interlayer distance effect keeping similar morphology, dimensions, and metallic composition. Results show the increase of the LDH basal space undergoes to lower Tafel slopes, higher electrochemical surface area, and a reduction of the resistance related to the chemisorption of oxygen leading to better kinetic behavior, showing an optimum enhancement of the electrocatalytic performance for the NiFe-dodecyl sulfate (basal space of 25 angstrom). Interestingly, the NiFe-dodecyl sulfate exhibits optimum proton diffusion values; indeed, a further increment in the basal space compromises the onset potential, a fact that could be related to an increase in the hydrophobicity between the layers. Moreover, by judicious tuning of the interlayer space, it is possible to reach a Tafel slope value for the most spaced LDH (NiFe-octadecyl sulfate, basal space of 31.6 angstrom) similar to the one obtained for exfoliated NiFe nanosheets, showing a much better long-time stability due to the three-dimensional robustness of the catalysts. This work illustrates the importance of molecular engineering in the design of novel highly active catalysts and provides important insights into the understanding of basic principles of oxygen evolution reaction in NiFe-LDHs.									46	1	0	0	2	0	47			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000485830300048

Since there are many types of carbon supports and transition metals, the accurate prediction of the components with high activity through theoretical calculations can greatly save experimental time and costs. In this work, the ORR catalytic properties of 180 types single-atom catalysts (SACs) composed of the eight representative carbon-based substrates (graphdiyne, C2N, C3N4, phthalocyanine, C-coordination graphene, N-coordination graphene, covalent organic frameworks and metal-organic frameworks) and 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal elements are investigated by density functional theory (DFT). The adsorption free energy of OH* is proved a universal descriptor capable of accurately prediction of the ORR catalytic activity. It is found that the oxygen reduction reaction overpotentials of all the researched SACs follow one volcano shape very well with the adsorption free energy of OH*. Phthalocyanine, N-coordination graphene and metal-organic frameworks stand out as the promising supports for single metal atom due to the relatively lower overpotentials. Notably, the Co-doped metal-organic frameworks, Ir-doped phthalocyanine, Co-doped N-coordination graphene, Co-doped graphdiyne and Rh-doped phthalocyanine show extremely low overpotentials comparable to that of Pt (111). The study provides a guideline for design and selection of carbon-supported SACs toward oxygen reduction reaction.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000677250200001

Experiments were initially carried out at a Pt electrode in alkaline media, in which case, in the absence of mediating effects, a slow electroxidation was observed. However, with halides, the rate of the electrochemical incineration was increased significantly, following the order F- >= Br- > Cl-, and the rate of the mediated process was practically independent of applied current density. An explanation has been attempted for the role of halides, in relation with the oxygen evolution reaction, concomitant with the electrochemical incineration.

Electrocatalytic character of the coatings was tested for their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH medium, alongside with their corrosion behaviours. Cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentio-metry study revealed that the deposition current density has a prominent role on the alkaline water splitting behaviour of the coatings, depending on their phase structure, composition and surface morphology. It was found that the c.d. has an inverse dependence on HER and OER. The Cu-Ni alloy coatings developed, respectively at 3.0 and 4.0 A dm(-2), were found to be the best coatings for HER and OER, depending on the surface morphology. The electrocatalytic activity of Cu-Ni alloy coating for HER, deposited at 3.0 A dm(-2) (optimal), was further improved through electrochemical dissolution of the as-deposited coating. The increase in the electrocatalytic activity for HER has been attributed to the enhancement in the exposed surface area of Ni active sites due to the leaching of Cu from the alloy matrices, evidenced by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The dependencies of HER and OER on to the surface of Cu-Ni alloy coatings were analysed in terms of deposition c. d. of the coatings, and the results are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1068-3755	1934-8002		WOS:000410542000007

Compared with water electrolysis which involves oxygen/hydrogen evolution reaction (OER/HER), the introduction of urea not only improves the energy conversion efficiency of water electrolysis but also involves the urea-rich wastewater treatment. In this work, a promising and novel bifunctional electrocatalytic material, bimetal nickel-cobalt sulfide nanosheet arrays on Ni Foam (NCS/NF), is developed as an electrocatalyst for water splitting. Benefiting from the sulfuration effect, which facilitates the formation of the high-valence states of Ni and Co during the oxidation process, the NCS/NF demonstrates a low potential of 1.46 V for the OER and 1.31 V for the UOR at 10 mA cm(-2). When utilized in a water-splitting system with urea, the voltage is further reduced to 1.397 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The result lays the foundation for exploring the feasibility of low energy-intensive and large-scale hydrogen production in the future.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2052-1553			WOS:000692359300001

In this work, cobalt phosphides were prepared using a one-step, scalable, and direct gas-solid phosphidation of commercially available cobalt salts. It was found that the effectiveness of the phosphidation reaction was closely related to the state of cobalt precursors at the reaction temperature. For instance, a high yield of cobalt phosphides obtained from the phosphidation of cobalt(II) acetate was related to the good stability of cobalt salt at the phosphidation temperature. On the other hand, easily oxidizable salts (e.g., cobalt(II) acetylacetonate) tended to produce a low amount of cobalt phosphides and a large content of metallic cobalt. The as-synthesized cobalt phosphides were in nanostructures with large catalytic surface areas. The catalyst prepared from phosphidation of cobalt(II) acetate exhibited an improved catalytic activity as compared to its counterpart derived from phosphidation of cobalt(II) acetylacetonate, showing an overpotential of 160 and 175 mV in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Both catalysts also displayed an enhanced long-term stability, especially in the alkaline electrolyte. This study illustrates the direct phosphidation behavior of cobalt salts, which serve as a good vantage point in realizing the large-scale synthesis of transition-metal phosphides for high-performance electrocatalysts.									50	3	0	0	1	0	52			1944-8244			WOS:000432205800039	29671569

Herein, the novel defect-induced nitrogen-doped carbon-supported Co(3)O(4 )nanoparticles is successfully fabricated as OER electrocatalyst (denoted as Co3O4/CN HNPs) through a wetness-impregnation treatment of Co/polyaniline (PANI) followed by a thermal annealing. This advanced architecture of Co3O4/CN HNPs can not only improve its conductivity and electrocatalytically active sites but also generate a large number of oxygen-vacancy defects and crystal defects, which effectively exert the preponderance in facilitating interfacial electronic transfer and optimizing the adsorption energy for intermediates, thus imparting the extraordinary activities in catalyzing OER. In addition, there are evidences demonstrating the formation of C-N coordination bonds through the strong interaction of the interconnected interface and the generation of pyridinic-N species after the annealing treatment, which enables the structural stability to get further strengthened and accelerates oxygen releasing for reduction of OER overpotential, respectively. Benefiting from the above desirable properties, the Co3O4/CN HNPs affords a lower overpotential of 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) as compared to those of pure Co(3)O(4 )and PANI, outperforming commercial IrO2 and the representative Co3O4-based OER electrocatalysts as recently reported. Moreover, the Co3O4/CN HNPs also exhibits long durability with negligible activity degeneration at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for 20 h.-.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000566866700013

The reaction interface is studied by using isotope-labeling techniques combined with time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and on-line electrochemical mass spectroscopy (OEMS) under practical cell operation conditions. Isotopically labelled microsized Li2O2 particles with an (Li2O2)-O-16/electrode interface and an (Li2O2)-O-18/electrolyte interface were fabricated. Upon oxidation, O-18(2) was evolved for the first quarter of the charge capacity followed by O-16(2). These observations unambiguously demonstrate that oxygen loss starts from the Li2O2/electrolyte interface instead of the Li2O2/electrode interface. The Li2O2 particles are in continuous contact with the catalyst/electrode, explaining why the solid catalyst is effective in oxidizing solid Li2O2 without losing contact.									25	5	0	0	0	0	27			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000476423300021	30903671

Herein, a novel efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst based on binary active sites engineering of NiFe alloy embedded in hierarchical nanoporous nitrogen-doped carbon nanocage (NiFe@NC) is successfully synthetized by pyrolysis of urea and Prussian blue analogues coated with polydopamine. Profiting from strong synergetic between NiFe alloy and nitrogen-doped carbon, abundant Fe/Ni-N-C bond, this unique hierarchical yolk-core-shell structure provides an integration of superior OER and ORR property, half-wave potential of 0.86 V for ORR and a small overpotential of 277 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER in O-2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. Consequently, the liquid ZABs based on the electrocatalyst exhibits a high open-circuit voltage of 1.50 V, a low-polarization voltage of 0.68 V after 370 hat 10 mA cm(-2), as well as superior stability for up to 750 h (10 mA cm(-2)) and 450 h (20 mA cm(-2)).

Composition was changed in 10 mol.% steps and the surface was characterized in situ by cyclic voltammetry (cv). Surface properties are governed by the RuOx features at low PtOx content (< 30%), while at higher PtOx content they are controlled by PtOx. A single Tafel line of 31 +/- 1 mV slope was observed at all compositions. The reaction order is zero with respect to H+ and 1.5 with respect to Cl-. At high PtOx content and low Cl- concentration (<1 mol dm(-3)) O-2 formation appears to control the gas evolution process. An inhibition of Cl-2 evolution is observed for PtOx greater than or equal to 30mol.%. On the whole, morphological effects predominate over electronic effects.

Herein, employing iron foam (IF) as an object, we closely monitor related morphologies and composition evolution under 300 mA cm(-2) at 40 degrees C (IF-40-t)/80 degrees C (IF-80-t) in 6 M KOH and find that the OER activity first increases and then decreases with the continuous generation of FeOOH. Moreover, the reasons for different tendencies of Tafel slope, double-layer capacitance, and impedance for IF-40-t/IF-80-t have been investigated thoroughly. In detail, the OER activity of IF-40-t is governed by electron and mass transport, while for IF-80-t, the dominating factor is electron transfer. Further, to improve the stability, guided by the above results, two versatile methods that do not sacrifice electron and mass transport have been proposed: surface coating and dynamic interface construction. The synchronous improvements of stability and activity are deeply revealed, which may provide inspiration for catalyst design for industrial applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000797959300023	35385258

Here we provide a micro- and nanostructural characterization of the olivine/water interface during the carbonation of forsteritic olivine at 150 degrees C and p(CO2) = 100 bar. When the reaction starts under oxic conditions, the observed temporal sequence of interfacial layers consists of: a hematite/SiO2(am) assemblage, Fe-rich phyllosilicates with mixed Fe valence and a non-passivating Fe-free amorphous SiO2 layer, which allows the formation of ferroan magnesite. In contrast, starting at micro-oxic conditions, carbonation rates are much faster, with no real evidence of interfacial layers. Separate deposits of goethite/lepidocrocite in the early stages of the reaction and then formation of magnetite are observed at these conditions, while precipitation of siderite/magnesite proceeds unhindered. The evolution of the redox conditions during the reaction progress controls the sequence of the observed reaction products and the passivating properties of Fe-Si-rich interfacial layers. These findings have important implications for modeling the carbonation of ultramafic rocks under different oxygen fugacity conditions as well as for understanding the technological implications of adding accessory gases to CO2 in carbon capture and storage mineralization processes involving ultrabasic rocks.									24	0	0	0	3	0	24			0003-004X	1945-3027		WOS:000365374400030

Therefore, studying the correlation between work function and BEF is crucial for understanding the intrinsic reaction mechanism. Herein, we present a Pt@CoOx electrocatalyst with a large work function difference (Delta Phi) and strong BEF, which shows outstanding hydrogen evolution activity in a neutral medium with a 4.5-fold mass activity higher than 20 % Pt/C. Both experimental and theoretical results confirm the interfacial charge redistribution induced by the strong BEF, thus subtly optimizing hydrogen and hydroxide adsorption energy. This work not only provides fresh insights into the neutral hydrogen evolution mechanism but also proposes new design principles toward efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production in a neutral medium.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000756499400001	35072330

In this work, by focusing on the surface chemistry of monometallic Ru oxide in acidic and alkaline environments, we found that the kinetics of the OER are almost entirely controlled by the stability of the Ru surface atoms. The same activity-stability relationship was found for more complex, polycrystalline and single-crystalline SrRuO3 thin films in alkaline solutions. We propose that the electrochemical transformation of either water (acidic solutions) or hydroxyl ions (alkaline solutions) to di-oxygen molecules takes place at defect sites that are inherently present on every electrode surface. During the OER, surface defects are also created by the corrosion of the Ru ions. The dissolution is triggered by the potential-dependent change in the valence state (n) of Ru: from stable but inactive Ru4+ to unstable but active Run>4+. We conclude that if the oxide is stable then it is completely inactive for the OER. A practical consequence is that the best materials for the OER should balance stability and activity in such a way that the dissolution rate of the oxide is neither too fast nor too slow.									64	1	0	0	3	0	66			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000350894400009	25490237

Herein, we assembled novel, tubular carbon nitride (D-TCN450) with nitrogen defects/boron dopants via a self-supramolecular reaction and NaBH4 thermal reduction approach. Advanced characterization results suggested that introducing the nitrogen defects/boron dopants can effectively promote light trapping, charge separation, and valance-band downshift. Density functional theory and electron spin resonance results further proved that the fusion of cyano groups (nitrogen defects) into the framework of D-TCN450 can facilitate oxygen adsorption to form superoxide radicals. As a result, D-TCN450 exhibited dramatically improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and photodegradation of tetracycline hydrochloride at a 4- and 9-fold enhancement compared to pristine g-C3N4, respectively. This integrated engineering strategy might provide a unique paradigm for the rational design of novel photocatalysts for sustainable remediation and energy innovation.									32	0	0	0	7	0	32			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000727812600001

Herein, the rational design and controllable fabrication of unique heterostructured inter-doped ruthenium-cobalt oxide [(Ru-Co)O-x] hollow nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth is reported. Benefiting from the desirable compositional and structural advantages of more exposed active sites, optimized electronic structure, and interfacial synergy effect, the (Ru-Co)O(x)nanoarrays exhibited outstanding performance as a bifunctional catalyst. Particularly, the catalyst showed a remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with an overpotential of 44.1 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and a small Tafel slope of 23.5 mV dec(-1), as well as an excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an overpotential of 171.2 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). As a result, a very low cell voltage of 1.488 V was needed at 10 mA cm(-2)for alkaline overall water splitting.									107	7	0	0	5	0	106			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000553454100001	32495389

Although electrocatalysts based on transition metal sulfides (TMSs) are widely studied as efficient (pre)catalysts toward OER under alkaline media, their HER performances are far less than the state-of-the-art Pt catalyst. Herein, the synthesis of nitrogen doped 3D dandelion-flower-like CoS2 architecture directly grown on Ni foam (N-CoS2/NF) is reported that possesses outstanding HER activity and durability, with an overpotential of 28 mV to obtain the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), exceeding almost all the documented TMS-based electrocatalysts. Density functional theory calculations and experimental results reveal that the d-band center of CoS2 could be efficiently tailored by N doping, resulting in optimized adsorption free energies of hydrogen (Delta G(*H)) and water , which can accelerate the HER process in alkaline electrolyte. Besides, the resulting N-CoS2/NF also displays excellent performance for OER, making it a high-performance bifunctional electrocatalyst toward overall water splitting, with a cell voltage of 1.50 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2).									84	7	0	0	2	0	84			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000478628400007	31207102

In this report, we synthesized a Ni(OH)(2) cocatalyst on a hematite photoanode and showed that, as has been proposed in other studies, the current density varies as a function of scan rate, which arises due to a photoinduced capacitive charging effect. We discovered that this photoinduced charging of Ni2+/3+ can be overcome by mixing cerium nitrate into the Ni precursor solution. Under illumination, the NiCeOx cocatalyst on a hematite photoanode exhibited an approximately 200 mV cathodic shift in onset potential and a similar to 53% enhancement in photocurrent at 1.23 V vs RHE. Material characterization by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that the Ni species create a p-n junction across the charge space region, which facilitates collection of the photogenerated holes by the cocatalyst layer, and core level X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that Ce incorporated into the Ni-based cocatalyst layer may possibly induce the oxidation of the Ni species. In addition, we observed a reduction in binding energies of Ni after photoelectrochemical water splitting reactions, which suggests that the lattice oxygen of the NiCeOx is consumed in the catalytic cycle, forming oxygen vacancies. The NiCeOx cocatalyst, however, was incapable of passivating the surface recombination centers of the hematite photoanode, as indicated by the unaltered flat-band potential determined with Mott-Schottky analysis.									47	2	0	0	1	1	47			1944-8244			WOS:000411043600045	28813595

Herein, we developed a room-temperature plasma topology conversion of Fe3+ doping Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets to porous hcp Ni engineered by FeOx clusters. X-ray absorption fine spectra established that they were formed via Ni-O-Fe bonds. The metal oxide-metal interfaces with benign geometry and electronic structures enable it to be applied as efficient electrocatalyst, exhibiting overpotential of 226 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). In situ Raman spectra show that the interfacial action of FeOx cluster with Ni can stimulate the generation of active intermediate of gamma-NiOOH, effectively promoting OER rate. DFT calculation further demonstrates the interaction accelerates desorption of O-2 molecules on the surfaces. This work provides a simple and robust strategy to synthesize oxide clusters engineering metastable metal nanocatalysts, offering new platform to explore efficient catalysts in various fields.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000623591500002

Metal oxides are promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER); their phase transformation is a key step for the multi-electron OER, and requires extra overpotential. However, little attention has been paid to accelerating and enhancing the phase transformation. Here, we report for the first time that single-atom Pt incorporated into the bulk crystalline phase of porous NiO nanocubes (0.5wt% Pt/NiO) can greatly promote the active phase (NiOOH) evolution. The Pt doping was achieved by a scalable nanocasting approach using SiO2 as the hard template. In comparison with Pt/NiO samples with PtO2 nanoparticles segregated at the NiO surface (1 wt% Pt), as well as atomistic Pt atoms solely bound at the surface by atomic layer deposition, the bulk Pt doping shows the strongest power in facilitating active phase transformation, which leads to improved OER activity with reduced overpotential and Tafel slope. Experiential data revealed that the charge-transfer from Pt to Ni through O leads to a local weaker Ni-O bond. First principles calculations confirmed that rather than acting as an active site for the OER, monatomic Pt effectively increases the phase transformation rate by reducing the migration barrier of nearby Ni atoms. Our discoveries reveal the relationships of the heteroatom doped structure and phase transformation behavior during the electrochemical process and offer a new route for designing high-performance electrocatalysts.									65	4	0	0	4	0	67			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000443270300008	30310613

Herein, a spiral-tube-shaped carbon nitride photocatalyst (named as PACN) with phosphorus (P)/oxygen (O) co-doping was developed, which can be successfully used in the simultaneous visible-light-driven water splitting and biorefinery. The unique structure and P/O co-doping of PACN significantly enhanced the visible light absorption range and accelerated the migration/separation of photo-generated carriers. The hydrogen evolution rate over PACN reached 6437.65 mu mol g(-1)h(-1), which is 10.08 times higher than that of pristine carbon nitride. Meanwhile, the yield of lactic acid was as high as 93.01%. The universality of hydrogen evolution from various biomass-derived monosaccharides was demonstrated. Pentoses were more suitable for lactic acid production. Moreover, .O-2(-) played a primary role in the oxidation half-reaction. This study presents a novel co-production of hydrogen and biomass-derived chemicals that fully utilizes photocatalysis.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000779492400001

Here we report a CO2/carbonate mediation approach to steering the WOR pathway from 4e(-) to 2e(-). Using fluorine-doped tin oxide electrode in carbonate solutions, we achieved high H2O2 selectivity of up to 87%, and delivered unprecedented H2O2 partial currents of up to 1.3 A cm(-2), which represents orders of magnitude improvement compared to literature. Molecular dynamics simulations, coupled with electron paramagnetic resonance and isotope labeling experiments, suggested that carbonate mediates the WOR pathway to H2O2 through the formation of carbonate radical and percarbonate intermediates. The high selectivity, industrial-relevant activity, and good durability open up practical opportunities for delocalized H2O2 production.Electrochemical H2O oxidation to H2O2 is challenged by the competitive O-2 evolution reaction. Here, the authors report a CO2/carbonate mediation approach to steering the H2O oxidation pathway from O-2 evolution to H2O2 generation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2041-1723		WOS:000795204200024	35562346

Their properties can be further tailored by functionalizing them with metals and nonmetals. However, the potential applications of metal-functionalized hydrogels for electrocatalysis have rarely been investigated. In this work, we report the synthesis of transition-metalfunctionalized polyaniline-phytic acid (PANI-PA) hydrogels that show efficient electrocatalytic activities for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among the many transition metals studied, Fe is accommodated by the hydrogel the most due to the favorable affinity of the PA groups in the hydrogel for Fe. Meanwhile, those containing both Fe and Co are found to be the most effective electrocatalysts for OER. The most optimized such hydrogel, NF@HgelFe0.3Co0.1, which is made using a solution that has a 3:1 ratio of Fe and Co, needs an overpotential of only 280 mV to catalyze OER in 1 M KOH solution with a current density of 10 mV cm-2. Furthermore, these metal-functionalized PANI-PA hydrogels can easily be loaded on the nickel foam or carbon cloth via a simple soak-and-dry method to generate free-standing electrodes. Overall, this work demonstrates a facile synthesis and fabrication of sustainable and efficient OER electrocatalysts and electrodes that are composed of easily processable hydrogels functionalized with earth-abundant transition metals.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000813074800001	35500300

In this work, nano-petal N-doped bi-metal (Ni, Co) and bi-valence (+2, +3) (Ni1-xCox)2+Co23+O4 compounds have been in situ grown on the surface of Ni foam. The N3- atoms originate from the amino group in urea and doped in the compound during annealing. The as-synthesized N-doped (Ni1-xCox)2+Co23+O4 nano-petals demonstrate commendable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bi-functional catalytic efficiency and stability. Electrochemical measurements confirm that the nitrogen doping significantly improves the catalytic kinetics and the surface area. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the improved HER and OER kinetics is not only due to the synergistic effect of bi-metal and bi-valence, as well as the introduction of defects such as oxygen vacancies, but also it more depends on the shortened bond length between the nitrogen N3- atoms and the metal atoms, and the increased electron density of the metal atoms attached to the N3- atoms. In other words, the change of lattice parameters caused by nitrogen doping is more conducive to the catalytic enhancement than the synergistic effect brought by bi-metal. This study provides an experimental and theoretical reference for the design of bi-functional electrocatalytic nanomaterials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2046-2069		WOS:000607364700044	35423675

Pt and RuOx catalysts were fabricated by soaking inexpensive graphite electrodes (pencil-lead graphite rod: PGR) in catalyst precursor solutions and using a simple flame-annealing method, which results in lower amount of Pt and RuOx catalyst layers. From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure analysis, it has been found that platinum and ruthenium were deposited as zero-valence metal (Pt) and oxide (RuOx), respectively. Catalytic activities of Pt/PGR and RuOx/PGR for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were evaluated using neutral 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte, respectively. Although HER and OER currents using PGR without catalysts were -16 mA cm(-2) (at -1.5 V vs Ag/AgCl) and +20 mA cm(-2) (at +2.0 V vs Ag/AgCl), they were improved to -110 and +80 mA cm(-2) with catalysts (Pt and RuOx), respectively. Such an inexpensive and rapid catalyst electrode preparation method on PGR using flame-annealing is a very significant method in the initial catalyst activity evaluation requiring a large amount of trial and error.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2470-1343			WOS:000521782400058	32226892

After calcination at low temperature, the nitrogen and phosphorus were co-doped into bimetal NF@NM nanowires. The hollow nanowire structure could be obtained after low-temperature calcination and nonmetallic doping. The as-synthesized hollow NF@NiMoO4/N/P (NF@NM-NP) nanowires exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction performance (with an overpotential of -164 mV at -100 mA cm(-2)) due to the existence of planar defects and the hollow structure. To further improve the catalytic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction, amorphous lamellar NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) was deposited onto the NF@NM-NP nanowires via an electrochemical method to form core-shell NF@NM-NP@NiFe LDH, which deliver an overpotential of 218 mV at 100 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, an asymmetric setup composed of NF@NM-NP hollow nanowires and core-shell NF@NM-NP@NiFe LDH electrode were fabricated for overall seawater splitting, which can deliver potentials of 1.46 and 1.70 V at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in simulated alkaline seawater (1 M KOH and 0.5 M NaCl), respectively. This may provide an effective path for the formation of a green energy conversion system.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000783326300001

Herein, c-oriented NiFe-LDH films (NiFeLDH-F) and Ni(OH)2 films (Ni(OH)2-F) were successfully fabricated by a colloid self-assembly method. The electrocatalytic oxidation properties of the resulting c-oriented NiFe-LDH-F and Ni(OH)2-F were studied towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the ethanol electrooxidation reaction (EOR), respectively. Due to orderly stacking c-oriented superlattices, the NiFe-LDH-F and Ni(OH)2-F both showed high proton diffusion coefficients, which significantly improved the electrocatalytic activities. The NiFe-LDH-F on the glassy carbon electrode showed an excellent OER electrocatalytic activity with a small overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a low Tafel slope of 53.3 mV dec-1. The Ni(OH)2-F showed a superior EOR performance without obvious passivation.

Herein, by directly etching Ni3S2 nanosheets through potassium ferricyanide, a novel self-sacrificing template strategy is proposed to realize the in situ growth of NiFe-based Prussian blue analogs (NiFe PBA) on Ni3S2 in an interfacial redox reaction. The well-designed Ni3S2@NiFe PBA composite as precursor displays a unique spherical magic cube architecture composed of nanocubes, which even maintains after a phosphating treatment to obtain the derived Ni3S2/Fe-NiPx on nickel foam. Specifically, in alkaline seawater, the Ni3S2/Fe-NiPx as OER precatalyst marvelously realizes the ultralow overpotentials of 336 and 351 mV at large current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively, with remarkable durability for over 225 h, outperforming most reported advanced OER electrocatalysts. Experimentally, a series of characterization results confirm the reconstruction behavior in the Ni3S2/Fe-NiPx surface, leading to the in situ formation of Ni(OH)(2)/Ni(Fe)OOH with abundant oxygen vacancies and grain boundaries, which constructs the Ni3S2/Fe-NiPx reconstruction system responsible for the remarkable OER catalytic activity. Theoretical calculation results further verify the enhanced OER activity for Ni3S2/Fe-NiPx reconstruction system, and unveil that the Fe-Ni2P/FeOOH as active origin contributes to the central OER activity.									22	0	0	0	4	0	22				2198-3844		WOS:000764170700031	35243823

Additionally, SOECs have potential to integrate with processes that require high-temperature pure oxygen produced at anode and CO2 utilization at cathode. Despite this advantage, CO2 utilization via SOEC has been extensively studied only for the practical use and development of CO2 electrolysis electrodes. In this study, we propose novel strategy that synergistically integrates both CO2 electrolysis and OCM in single apparatus. A previous study on OCM using SOEC resulted in low C-2 yield, highlighting the difficulty to develop anode electrode that satisfies the MIEC property to promote the oxygen evolution reaction as well as the catalytic activity to improve CH4 conversion and C-2 selectivity. Herein, CO2 electrolysis coupled with the OCM reaction (C-2 yield of 25.4% at 825 degrees C) was achieved through reactor capable of independently controlling operating conditions of two reactions in one apparatus. Furthermore, thermodynamic simulation analysis demonstrated that the conversion efficiency of the proposed OCM-SOEC system is superior to that of the conventional OCM-air separation unit (ASU) system.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000799774900001

Herein, a rationally designed strategy is developed to join the merits of metal phosphate and carbonaceous materials for the fabrication of novel hybrid electrocatalysts. Through the self-polymerization of organophosphonic acid and cobalt salts on graphene oxide (GO) under a hydrothermal process to form cobalt phosphonate, and subsequently high-temperature pyrolysis, the N,P-codoped three-dimensional (3D) reduced-graphene-oxide-aerogel-supported (rGOA-supported) Co2P2O7 (CoPi) fine particles (CoPi/NPGA) are obtained. The pyrolysis of cobalt phosphonate introduces abundant heteroatom defects and the in situ formed CoPi particles on rGOA, wherein the rGOA permits enhanced electric conductivity and corrosion resistance. Thereby, these two aspects possess different abilities, and together endow the obtained hybrid material with enhanced electrocatalytic performance. In 0.1 M KOH, CoPi/NPGA affords a positive onset and half-wave potentials in catalyzing oxygen reduction, close to that of the Pt/C benchmark, along with impressive durability. In addition, it also exhibits considerable oxygen evolution electrochemical performance, and renders a potential of 1.57 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Impressively, employed as the air cathode of the assembled Zn-air battery, this synthesized bifunctional catalyst enables high open-circuit potential, large powder density, and impressive cycling durability, holding great potential in practical rechargeable batteries.									40	6	0	0	0	0	40			2168-0485			WOS:000441475500033

Using ZIF-67 as a Co source and Cu-BTC as a Cu source, hexagonal MOF-derived CuCoO2 (MOF-CCO) nanocrystals with the size of similar to 288 nm were prepared through a one-step solvothermal method. The influence of the content of the precursor solvents (absolute ethanol and deionized water), reaction temperature, mass ratio of reactants, NaOH addition, and reactant concentration of precursors on the structure and morphology of the products was investigated. The optimal CuCoO2 nanocrystals (MOF-CCO1) around 288 nm present the highest OER activity, such as a low overpotential of 364.7 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 64.1 mV dec(-1), and attractive durability in 1.0 M KOH solution. The XPS results showed that the higher catalytic efficiency of MOF-CCO1 nanocrystals could be due to the oxygen vacancies caused by lattice oxygen loss, the increase of OH- content on the surface, and the synergistic effect of Cu2+/Cu+ and Co2+/Co3+ redox pairs. Finally, a possible OER mechanism for MOF-CCO nanocrystals of water splitting was proposed. This study provides a new approach for the preparation of delafossite nanomaterials and for the improvement of their OER performances.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000774807200001	35352083

Promising non-noble candidates for OER are often based on transition metal oxides, while carbon-based electrocatalysts typically receive little attention due to their relatively poor performance. In this work, we present a novel method to significantly activate carbon cloth for OER by creating oxygen-containing functional groups on its surface with the assistance of peroxovanadium complexes, which have been seldom used to oxidize carbon materials. Compared to pristine carbon cloth (P-CC), the activated carbon cloth (A-CC) exhibits higher specific surface area and faster electron transfer rate. Particularly, the overpotential of A-CC (310 mV) to afford a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) is much lower than that of P-CC and even comparable to that of noble RuO2/C (280 mV), ranking A-CC among the best reported nonmetal catalysts for OER. Moreover, densely distributed VO2 (B) nanoplates in the intermediate product of VO2 (B)/CC can prevent the highly active A-CC from degrading in air for two months, which endows another excellent feature for this fabrication method.

The electrocatalysts have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the presence of cationic surfactant (SF), PBAs-based electrodes showed enhanced redox current, high surface area and robust stability compared to the recently reported PBAs. SF[Fe-Tol-Co] hybrid catalyst shows superior electrochemical OER activity with a much lower over-potential (610 mV) to attain the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with the Tafel slope value of 103 mV center dot dec(-1) than that for SF[Fe-Tol-Ni] and SF[Fe-Tol-Mn]. Moreover, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) unveiled that SF[Fe-Tol-Co] exhibits smaller charge transfer resistance, which results in a faster kinetics towards OER.

We propose a thermodynamic form of the energetic span (delta E) as a rate-determining term for electrocatalytic reactions, which allows the essential factors such as the coverage of the stable intermediates and the energetics of the most demanding steps to be included in the rate equations and therefore overcomes the weakness of the current electrocatalytic VRs derived from kinetic models using the maximum standard free energy (Delta G(max)degrees) of elementary reaction steps as rate-determining terms. The Delta G(max)degrees-based VRs are shown to be applicable only at large overpotentials, where the intermediates involved in delta E and Delta G(max)degrees converge. At small overpotentials, where the excellent catalysts function, the Delta G(max)degrees-based VRs may give improper predictions by missing the effects of the surface phases of stable adsorbates and their evolution with the potential. As well as revealing new features of electrocatalytic VRs and reasonably explaining some recent experimental results on efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen and oxygen electrode reactions, the delta E-based rate models provide rich information about the catalytic mechanism and kinetics, e.g., the evolution of surface phases of stable intermediates, rate-determining transition states, and Tafel slopes.									37	1	0	0	2	0	37			2155-5435			WOS:000449723900073

In- and O-added NiS2 (NiInOS) extended its bandgap for harvesting visible light and showed as a distorted pyrite structure with a molecular formula of (Ni0.872In0.128)[(O0.2S0.8)1.5()0.5]. (Ni,In)(O,S)2-x with active oxygen vacancy and a partial Ni3+-to-Ni2+ conversion achieves excellent PHER. The best (Ni,In)(O,S)2-x with an oxygen vacancy content of 16.8 % could produce 496.8 mu mol/h H2 under visible light, while it was 7.63 mu mol/h H2 at a content of 2.12 %. The DFT calculation predicts that surface oxygen vacancies of (Ni,In)(O,S)2-x have a strong interaction with H2O to reach a high water adsorption energy of -0.896 eV. Here, the conversion of NiS2 into photocatalyst indicates that defect engineering by forming solid solution with incorporation of indium and oxygen to have bimetal and bichalcogen (Ni,In)(O,S)2-x is a promising approach for novel materials design to extend material application.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000702311200004

Here, a novel amorphous CoFeOx(OH)(y)/CoOx(OH)(y) nanosphere (CFOH/COH) with unique core/shell structure was produced through a simple one-step solvothermal reaction, which exhibited enhanced activity for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) across the water splitting process. Benefited from the unique core/shell character, the amorphous structure as well as the amorphous interface, the active sites of CFOH/COH were well optimized, thus finally leading to the activity enhancement. The CFOH/COH-1 catalyst (with the Co/Fe ratio of about 1) displayed the best performance among the tested catalysts, exhibiting the overpotentials of 0.324 V and 0.263 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH solution, respectively, smaller than those of pure Fe- or Co-based amorphous catalysts. Furthermore, the CFOH/COH-1 exhibited robust catalytic activity with a voltage of 1.59 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), when adopted as the bifunctional catalyst for full water splitting. This work highlights the important role of amorphous transition metal based heterostructure for boosting the HER and OER performance.

Herein, we employ a novel plasma-assisted strategy to rapidly and conveniently synthesize the three-dimensional (3D) porous composite nanosheets assembled on monodispersed Co nanoparticles encapsulated in a carbon framework (CoNPs@C) on a carbon cloth. Such a novel 3D hierarchical porous nanosheet improves the exposure and accessibility of active sites as well as ensures high electroconductibility. Moreover, the coating of a few graphene layers on the surface of catalysts favors improvement of the catalytic activity. Benefited from these multiple merits, the CoNPs@C composite nanosheets enable a low overpotential of 153 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction. Furthermore, they are also capable of catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction with high efficiency to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 270 mV. Remarkably, when assembled as an alkaline water electrolyzer, the bifunctional CoNPs@C composite nanosheets can afford a water-splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.65 V.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			1944-8244			WOS:000411771400073	28849642

Herein, we reported a ldquoone for twordquo strategy to prepare NiCo2S4 nanorods directly grown on carbon cloth (NiCo2S4@CC) via a simply modified MOFs-derived approach for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors and efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As an electrode for asymmetric supercapacitors, the NiCo2S4@CC electrode showed excellent electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance and good rate capability. The asymmetric supercapacitor using NiCo2S4@CC as a cathode electrode and N-doped porous carbon nanosheets grown on the CC (NC@CC) as an anode electrode achieved a superior energy density and power density and a long cycle life. Furthermore, the NiCo2S4@CC exhibited a notable electrocatalytic activity as an electrocatalyst for OER. The remarkable electrochemical performance of as-prepared NiCo2S4@CC could be mainly attributed to its hierarchical structure, sufficient active sites and low metal-anion bond energy after sulfuration reaction. This work could provide an unprecedented opportunity to fabricate functional materials under rational design for various applications.

However, the morphology modulation of nano-arrays generally involves complex optimization of synthetic conditions including surfactants, pH, and solvent. In this work, we synthesize a NiMoO4 H2O nano-array by a simple hydrothermal method under mild conditions (pH = 6.47, aqueous solution, and without the aid of surfactants). The morphology modulation of the NiMoO4H2O nano-array is realized by simply changing the hydrothermal temperature. When the hydrothermal temperature below 150 degrees C, a NiMoO4H2O nanorod array is obtained. While the hydrothermal temperature is as high as 180 degrees C, the array on Ni foam is nanosheet instead of nanorod. The NiMoO4H2O nanorod array synthesized at 150 degrees C shows a superior water splitting activity compared to the NiMoO4H2O nanosheet array, affording a large current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of <240 and 200 mV toward oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively. Furthermore, the electrolyzer using NiMoO4H2O nanorod array as both anode and cathode electrodes for catalyzing overall water splitting exhibits great performance, obtaining a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.67 V, comparable to the integration of commercial noble-metal Pt/C and IrO2 electrodes.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16				2046-2069		WOS:000448348600041	35547067

In this work, we report a Mn-0-doped CoNx on N-doped porous carbon (Mn-CoNx/N-PC) composite from carbonizing metal-organic framework (MOF) derivative as the dual-functional catalyst to boost both the ORR and OER performances. Owing to the strong coordination effect between nitrogen and metal elements, the introduction of N can obviously improve the content of Co-N-C active sites for ORR. Meanwhile, the Mn-doping significantly regulates the electronic structure of the Co element and increases the content of Co-0 which provide efficient OER active sites. Mn-CoNx/N-PC catalyst delivers super dual-functional activity with a half-wave potential of 0.85 V, better than the 20% Pt/C catalyst (0.82 V). When used in Zn-air batteries for testing, Mn-CoNx/N-PC electrocatalyst shows a high power density (145 mW.cm(-2)) and good cycle performance.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000696453200001		
J	Wang, Baowen; Cai, Zhongyuan; Li, Heyu; Liang, Yanchen; Jiang, Tao; Ding, Ning; Zhao, Haibo								Reaction characteristics investigation of CeO2-enhanced CaSO4 oxygen carrier with lignite								CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING				42				319	328		10.1016/j.cjche.2021.02.016				FEB 2022	2022	Calcium sulfate (CaSO4) has been verified as a promising oxygen carrier (OC) in the chemical looping combustion (CLC) for its high oxygen capacity, abundant reserve and low cost, but its low reactivity and deleterious sulfur species emission from the side reactions of CaSO4 should be well considered for its wide application in CLC. In order to promote the reactivity of CaSO4 and increase its potential to inhibit the gaseous sulfur emission, a CeO2-enhanced CaSO4 OC mixed OC of core-shell structure was prepared using the combined template synthesis method. Reaction characteristics of the prepared CaSO4-CeO2 mixed OC with a typical lignite was first conducted and systematically investigated, and an improved reactivity of the prepared CaSO4-CeO2 mixed OC was demonstrated than its single component CaSO4 or CeO2 due to the fast transfer and exchange of oxygen from the CaSO4 substrate to coal via the doped CeO2. Furthermore, the solid products formed from the mixed CaSO4-CeO2 OC with the selected coal were collected and analyzed. Especially, evolution and redistribution of the sulfur species of different forms were focused. At the latter reaction stage of YN reaction with the CaSO4-CeO2 mixed OC, the SO2 emitted from the side reactions of CaSO4 was greatly diminished and the doped CeO2 was proven effective to directionally fix the SO2 released to turn into different solid sulfur compounds, which were determined as Ce2O2S, Ce2S3 and Ce-2(SO4)3 center dot 5H(2)O and formed through the different pathways. In addition, good regeneration of the reduced CaSO4-CeO2 mixed OC could be reached in spite of the unavoidable interaction between the included minerals in coal and the reduced mixed OC. Overall, the combined template method-made CaSO4-CeO2 mixed OC reported herein was not only endowed with enhanced reactivity for coal conversion, but also owned the potential to directionally fix the gaseous sulfur emission, which is quite applicable as OC for simultaneous decarbonatization and desulfurization in the real CLC process.

In this work, the multi-component oxide catalyst (Ni(VO3)(2) and Co2V2O7 on Ni foam, referred to as NiCoVOx@NF) is formed by hydrothermal doping of V element into NiCo-based precursors followed by co-oxidation. In the catalyst NiCoVOx@NF, all three components of Ni, Co and V are particularly tightly coordinated, exhibiting an integrated structure of keel flower-like arrays. The catalyst NiCoVOx@NF's contact surface with water is increased thanks to this unusual structure, exposing a high number of active sites. Furthermore, NiCoVOx@NF owns efficient electronic pathways, which greatly enhances the electron transport ability. To generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction, just a 107 mV overpotential is required. The electrode exhibits a low overpotential of 217 mV to deliver 50 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction. In addition, the total water splitting performance of NiCoVOx@NF is also excellent, which could be achieved by only one 1.5 V AA battery. This study provides a feasible heteroatom doping route to design bifunctional catalysts with improved performances. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The Mn3O4/C composites are fabricated using ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) with organic surfactants as the carbon sources. The physical and electrochemical performance of the composites is characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, particle size analysis, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurements, elemental analysis, galvanostatic charge-discharge methods and rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurements. The electrochemical tests demonstrate that the Mn3O4/C composite that is prepared using Trition X-114 (TX114) surfactant has higher activity as a bi-functional catalyst and delivers better oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance in Li-O-2 batteries because there is a larger surface area and particles are homogeneous with a meso/macro porous structure. The rate constant (k(f)) for the production of superoxide radical (O-2(center dot-)) and the propylene carbonate (PC)-electrolyte decomposition rate constant (k) for M3O4/C and Super P electrodes are measured using RRDE experiments and analysis in the 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF(6))/PC electrolyte. The results show that TX114 has higher electrocatalytic activity for the first step of ORR to generate O-2(center dot-) and produces a faster PC-electrolyte decomposition rate.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2079-4991			WOS:000390103400013

We demonstrate herein that decayed Li-MnO2 cells can be further utilized as rechargeable lithium-air cells with admitted oxygen. We further investigated the effects of lithiated manganese dioxide on the electrocatalytic properties of oxygen-reduction and oxygen-evolution reactions (ORR/OER). The catalytic activity was found to be correlated with the composition of LixMnO(2) electrodes (0< x < 1) generated in situ in aprotic Li-MnO2 cells owing to tuning of the Mn valence and electronic structure. In particular, modestly lithiated Li0.50MnO2 exhibited superior performance with enhanced round-trip efficiency (ca. 76%), high cycling ability (190 cycles), and high discharge capacity (10 823 mA h g(carbon)(-1)). The results indicate that the use of depleted Li-MnO2 batteries can be prolonged by their application as rechargeable lithium-air batteries.									89	12	0	0	4	0	96			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000351679600035	25678148

We have included dispersion correction to get accurate adsorption energy on the individual catalytic surface (top site). Using binding energy calculation, arsenene is shown to be a potential candidate for HER. Here we investigate the stability and electronic properties of the honeycomb structure of the arsenene system using first-principles calculation to find the effect of different dopants on the fundamental band gap, which is one of the primary parameters in the photocatalytic water splitting. Further, we sieved the dopant for better HER catalytic activity by substituting one of the arsenene (As) atoms by B, N, O, Ge, Ga and Se atoms to make arsenene a better candidate for HER. Our studies depict that HER activity is increased by 82% for O-doped arsenene and OER activity by 87% for B-doped arsenene as compared to pristine arsenene. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Here, using CeO2 nanorods as model photocatalyst we studied the critical role of oxygen vacancies in photo catalytic water oxidation. First CeO2 nanorods with similar morphology but different concentration of oxygen vacancies were fabricated by one-step hydrothermal method with in-situ reducing treatment. The optical absorption, charge transfer efficiency, and photocatalytic activity in oxygen generation were found closely dependent on the concentration of oxygen vacancies. Then density functional theory calculations were conducted to unveil the role of oxygen vacancies and understand the water oxidation mechanism. It was found the presence of oxygen vacancies narrows the bandgap and modulates the electronic structure for accelerating the charge transfer, in good agreement with the experimental observations. The overall oxygen generation pathway was screened and the oxygen vacancies were found to lower the barrier energy for the rate limiting step of O-O bond formation and restrain the reverse reaction of O and H, thus the O-2 generation kinetics on oxygen-defective CeO2 are improved significantly. This study provides in-depth understanding on the critical role of oxygen vacancies in photocatalytic water oxidation and is helpful for designing highly efficient photocatalyst to overcome the bottleneck of water splitting.									132	5	1	0	17	0	133			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000424960700012

The straightforward application becames possible to the case of the O-17(n, gamma)O-18 reaction with a substantial reliance.					10th International Symposium on Origin of Matter and Evolution of Galaxies10th International Symposium on Origin of Matter and Evolution of Galaxies	DEC 04-07, 2007DEC 04-07, 2007	Hokkaido Univ, Dept Cosmosci; Natl Astron Observ Japan; Univ Tokyo, Ctr Nucl Study; RIKEN; Okasa Univ, Res Ctr Nucl Phys; KEK; Univ Tokyo, Dept Astron; Sci Council Japan; Phys Soc Japan; Astron Soc JapanHokkaido Univ, Dept Cosmosci; Natl Astron Observ Japan; Univ Tokyo, Ctr Nucl Study; RIKEN; Okasa Univ, Res Ctr Nucl Phys; KEK; Univ Tokyo, Dept Astron; Sci Council Japan; Phys Soc Japan; Astron Soc Japan	Sapporo, JAPANSapporo, JAPAN	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0094-243X		978-0-7354-0537-0	WOS:000256349600033

Hydrogen is considered to play a major role in the urgently required reorganization of our current energy sector. Water can be split into hydrogen and oxygen and therefore presents an in principle inexhaustible and environmentally friendly hydrogen source. However, electrochemical approaches for the cleavage of H2O remain challenging, especially considering that the experimentally required potential at which oxygen evolves is substantially higher than the theoretically required potential. This results in significant overpotentials (eta) on the anode side, which limits the widespread applicability of this technique. Here, we have applied a two-step activation procedure of a Co-containing steel, which led to a significant reduction of eta for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) down to almost zero. The enhanced electrochemical behavior comes as a result of Li-ion doping, which leads to Li intercalation into the Co3O4 containing surface layer of the steel-ceramic composite material. Thus, our results indicate that additional metal doping and resulting surface modification is a promising strategy for achieving substantial OER at pH-neutral conditions close to the thermodynamic limit.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000449723900104

Observing oxygen distortions is key to understand the redox process. Electron ptychography is a phase-reconstruction method in 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy, providing atomic-resolution phase images with high signal-to-noise ratio and dose efficiency. Herein, we use electron ptychography to image the oxygen shift in Li(1.2)Ni(0.13)Mn(0.54)Co(0.13)O(2 )during the first cycle. The picometer-scale precision measurement shows distinct oxygen shifts in the bulk and surface after charging and compares with various theoretical anionic redox models. The shift after discharging is not seen to recover in the bulk accounting for voltage hysteresis; however, it recovers close to the surface, although with a phase change. We suggest that Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.54Co0.13O2 proceeds distinct oxygen redox in the bulk and surface. The altered oxygen sublattice after first cycle potentially explains the changed voltage profiles of following cycles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2542-4351			WOS:000804710900016

Here, we demonstrate that the A-site substituent in yttrium ruthenium pyrochlores Y1.8M0.2Ru2O7-delta (M = Cu, Co, Ni, Fe, Y) controls the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies (V-O) in these materials whereby an increased concentration of V-O sites correlates with a superior OER activity. DFT calculations rationalize these experimental trends demonstrating that the higher OER activity and V-O surface density originate from a weakened strength of the M-O bond, scaling with the formation enthalpy of the respective MOx phases and the coupling between the M d states and O 2p states. Our work introduces a novel catalyst with improved OER performance, Y1.8M0.2Ru2O7-delta, and provides general guidelines for the design of active electrocatalysts.									108	4	0	0	6	0	109			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000529959000021	32216262

Here, a fibrous bifunctional 3D electrocatalyst is reported for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with high performance. The remarkable electrochemical performance is attributed of the catalysts to a number of factors: the metallic character of the three components (i.e., Ni3N, CoN, and NiCo2O4); the electronic structure, nanoflake-nanosphere network with abundant electroactive sites, and the electric field effect at the interfaces between different components. The oxide-nitride/graphite fibers have the lowest overpotential requirements of 71 and 183 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER in alkaline medium, respectively. These values are comparable to those of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) and RuO2. The electrodes also show a response to HER and OER in both neutral and acid media. Furthermore, the 3D structure can be highlighted by all-round electrodes for overall water splitting. The calculations on the changes in electrons transfer and the Femi level from oxides to oxides/nitrides reveal that the observed superb electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the presence of Ni3N and CoN derived from the in situ nitridation of NiCo2O4.									96	8	0	0	5	0	96				2198-3844		WOS:000460374300012	30886805

Herein we report a facile method for the in situ synthesis of monometallic Co LDH ultrathin nanosheets (UTNSs) through a one-step reaction between cobalt(II) nitrate and 2-methylimidazole (2MI) in water-methanol solution without the pre-synthesis of zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67). The as-prepared Co LDH UTNSs possess atomic thickness, abundant oxygen vacancies and three-dimensional (3D) porous features. The best sample exhibits an outstanding OER performance on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with an overpotential (eta) of 340 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1) and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.801 s (1) at eta = 350 mV in 1 M KOH. A two-electrode cell with the Co LDH UTNSs as the anode catalyst and commercial Pt/C as the cathode catalyst achieves a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at the applied voltage of 1.625 V during the long-term electrolysis test. This work demonstrates a novel strategy based on water-methanol solution which is promising for the design and synthesis of ultrathin LDHs as highly active and stable catalysts applied in clean energy production.									76	3	0	0	4	0	76			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431506600060		
J	Fang, Yiyun; Li, Xinzhe; Li, Feng; Lin, Xiaoqing; Tian, Min; Long, Xuefeng; An, Xingcai; Fu, Yan; Jin, Jun; Ma, Jiantai								Self-assembly of cobalt-centered metal organic framework and multiwalled carbon nanotubes hybrids as a highly active and corrosion-resistant bifunctional oxygen catalyst								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				326				50	59		10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.06.114				SEP 15 2016	2016	Metal organic frameworks (MOF) derived carbonaceous materials have emerged as promising bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. But previous attempts to overcome the poor electrical conductivity of MOFs hybrids involve a harsh high-template pyrolytic process to in situ form carbon, which suffer from extremely complex operation and inevitable carbon corrosion at high positive potentials when OER is operated. Herein, a self-assembly approach is presented to synthesize a non-precious metal-based, high active and strong durable Co-MOF@CNTs bifunctional catalyst for OER and ORR. CNTs not only improve the transportation of the electrons but also can sustain the harsh oxidative environment of OER without carbon corrosion. Meanwhile, the unique 3D hierarchical structure offers a large surface area and stable anchoring sites for active centers and CNTs, which enables the superior durability of hybrid. Moreover, a synergistic catalysis of Co(II), organic ligands and CNTs will enhance the bifunctional electrocatalytic performance. Impressively, the hybrid exhibits comparable OER and ORR catalytic activity to RuO2 and 20 wt% Pt/C catalysts and superior stability. This facile and versatile strategy to fabricating MOF-based hybrids may be extended to other electrode materials for fuel cell and water splitting applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the endeavor to advance their performance towards overall water splitting has been largely impeded by the limited activities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we present a CoFeNi ternary metal-based oxide (CoFeNi-O) with impressive hierarchical bimodal channel nanostructures, which was synthesized via a facile one-step dealloying strategy. The oxide shows superior catalytic activities towards both HER and OER in alkaline solution due to the alloying effect and the intrinsic hierarchical porous structure. CoFeNi-O loaded on glass carbon electrodes only requires the overpotentials as low as 230 and 278 mV to achieve the OER current densities of 10 and 100 mA center dot cm(-2), respectively. In particular, extremely low overpotentials of 200 and 57.9 mV are sufficient enough for Ni foam-supported CoFeNi-O to drive the current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) towards OER and HER respectively, which is comparable with or even better than the already-developed state-of-the-art non-noble metal oxide based catalysts. Benefiting from the bifunctionalities of CoFeNi-O, an alkaline electrolyzer constructed by the Ni foam-supported CoFeNi-O electrodes as both the anode and the cathode can deliver a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) at a fairly low cell-voltage of 1.558 V. In view of its electrocatalytic merits together with the facile and cost-effective dealloying route, CoFeNi-O is envisioned as a promising catalyst for future production of sustainable energy resources.									42	5	0	0	1	0	42			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000485041800027

The model takes into account different geometrical parameters of the PEM cell, the kinetics of the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, the electro-osmotic drag of water molecules, the permselectivity of the solid polymer electrolyte and associated gas cross-over phenomena. The role of various operating parameters (such as pressure, temperature, current density, flow rate of water) on cell efficiency, faradaic yield and heat produced during water electrolysis is evaluated and discussed. The model is also used for the purpose of optimizing the performances of PEM cells. In particular, optimal values of some critical operating parameters (current density, rate of water supplied to the anodes) are recommended.					8th European Symposium on Electrochemical Engineering8th European Symposium on Electrochemical Engineering	AUG 24-28, 2008AUG 24-28, 2008		Prague, CZECH REPUBLICPrague, CZECH REPUBLIC	69	1	0	0	1	0	69			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000276505900006

Herein, based on the different molar ratio of P/B precursor, a series of nanocotton-like Co-B-P/BCCNF electrocatalysts have been designed and prepared via a simple electroless deposition. When the molar ratio of P/B precursor is 3/7, nanocotton-like Co-B-P/BCCNF catalyst exhibits prominent catalytic performances, delivering the current density of 10 and 50 mA cm-2 at low overpotentials of only 262 and 391 mV, respectively. Besides, it exhibits long-term stability for durative OER in alkaline solution.

In this study, oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on mesoporous MnCo2O4 spinel was studied for rechargeable Zn-air battery. Comparing the prepared spinel oxides containing Fe, it was found that the ORR/OER activity of MnCo2O4 was reasonably high and stably cycled. Mesoporous MnCo2O4 was successfully prepared by using a hard template method with mesoporous silica (SBA-15) for an inorganic template. The obtained mesoporous MnCo2O4 showed the BET surface area of 108 m(2)/g and the average pore size of 2 nm. By increasing the surface area with mesoporous structure, overpotential of MnCo2O4 to ORR/OER was much decreased. Zn-air battery was prepared by using mesoporous MnCo2O4 as air electrode and 4 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, the stable discharge potential and capacity were exhibited at 1.05 V and 700 mAh/g-Zn, respectively. In addition, stable charge/discharge cycles were also sustained more than 200 cycles. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.									18	1	0	0	0	0	19			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000458488200054

In this work, Ni-modified MoS2 hybrid catalysts are grown on carbon cloth (Ni-Mo-S@CC) through a one-step hydrothermal treatment. The optimized Ni-Mo-S@CC catalyst shows excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with a low overpotential of 168 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 m KOH, which is lower than those of Ni-Mo-S@CC (1:1), Ni-Mo-S@CC (3:1), and pure MoS2. Significantly, the Ni-Mo-S@CC hybrid catalyst also displays outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with a low overpotential of 320 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and remarkable long-term stability for 30 h at a constant current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Experimental results and theoretical analysis based on density functional theory demonstrate that the excellent electrocatalytic performance can be attributed mainly to the remarkable conductivity, abundant active sites, and synergistic effect of the Ni-doped MoS2.

The core complex fraction contained one Ca2+ per PSII, while another Ca2+ was found in the solubilized major light-harvesting Chl a/b-proteins (LHCII). LHCII isolated with Triton X-100 or dodecylmaltoside also contained Ca2+ in an amount corresponding to one per PSII. The Ca2+ bound to LHCII could not be removed by treatment with Chelex 100, which effectively sequestered extraneous Ca2+ bound to LHCII, or by preparation of LHCII in the presence of 40 mM citrate. Localization of the two Ca2+ in different functional domain of PSII membranes conclusively indicates that the number of the bound Ca2+ that can function in oxygen evolution is one per PSII. The results also suggest that one Ca2+ has a structural role in the peripheral antenna assembly.									37	0	0	0	32	0	38			0032-0781			WOS:A1993LH18800011

Herein, a simple process is developed for preparing a new type of low-cost iron-cobalt oxide (FeCoOx) as an efficient co-catalyst to suppress the surface charge recombination on bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoanodes. The new FeCoOx/BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a high photocurrent density of 4.82 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5 G illumination, which corresponds to >100% increase compared to that of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode. The photoanode also demonstrates a high charge separation efficiency of approximate to 90% with excellent stability of over 10 h, indicating the excellent catalytic performance of FeCoOx in the PEC process. Density functional theory calculations and experimental studies reveal that the incorporation of Fe into CoOx generates abundant oxygen vacancies and forms a p-n heterojunction with BiVO4, which effectively promotes the hole transport/trapping from the BiVO4 photocatalyst and reduces the overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in remarkably increased photocurrent densities and durability. This work demonstrates a feasible process for depositing cheap FeCoOx as an excellent OER cocatalyst on photoanodes for PEC water splitting.									179	8	0	0	12	1	179			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000442205200022

However, owing to their high density of metal centers, MOFs derived metal-carbon based catalysts exhibit seriously aggregated metal nanoparticles, which greatly hinders their electrochemical performance. In this work, we synthesize a hollow Co@CN-P catalyst using in situ N,P-doped Co-MOF as a template and then post-treat it using a fast acid-leaching strategy [denoted as Co@CN-P-H+(D)] to remove aggregated, inefficient and unstable metal nanoparticles. In constrast, an impregnation acid-leaching strategy [denoted as Co@CN-P-H+(12 h)] is also investigated in this work. The optimal Co@CN-P-10-750-H+(D) catalyst exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance, with a potential difference between the ORR and OER of only 0.734 V. When used as a cathode catalyst, the Co@CN-P-10-750-H+(D) based liquid Zn-air battery (ZAB) exhibits the highest maximum power density and specific capacity (204.8 mW cm(-2), 790.4 mA h g(-1)). Moreover, the liquid ZAB also delivers a long-term cycling stability (>800 cycles). The Co@CN-P-10-750-H+(D) based solid-state battery also exhibits ultra-high maximum power density, specific capacity and long-term charge-discharge stability. In addition, the ZAB also displays strong practical application.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2052-1537		WOS:000729538000001

Herein, the N-doped graphene wrapped Fe3C/Fe2O3 heterostructure has been designed as a bifunctional oxygen catalyst for zinc-air batteries. In the synthesis process of the catalyst, graphene oxide (GO) can assemble with graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and FeOOH nanorods by the pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bonds, respectively. The assembly of GO, g-C3N4 and FeOOH nanorods results in nanostructure of carbon layers coated iron species and leads to outstanding durability in both alkaline and acidic media. The synergistic effect of nitrogen doping and Fe3C/Fe2O3 heterostructure allows the catalyst (Fe3C/Fe2O3@NGNs) to display high oxygen reduction and evolution reaction activities. The liquid zinc-air battery assembled with the catalyst presented a remarkable peak power density (139.8mWcm(-2)), large specific capacity (722 mAh g(-1)) and excellent charging-discharging cycling performance. The quasi-solid-state zinc-air battery with the catalyst exhibited an impressive open-circuit voltage and a peak power density. Therefore, the Fe3C/Fe2O3@NGNs catalyst is expected to have a bright future for practical applications in energy conversion devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, the masterly CoNi2S4@CoS2/NF 3D microspheres assembled by peapod-like nanorods with a mass of CoS2 particles are successfully prepared on nickel foam. The well-preserved 3D porous materials with unique heterostructure have various merits including more electronic channels, small electrons transfer resistance and open interior space. Besides, the unique peapod-like structure endows the catalyst plentiful, dispersive and exposed reactive sites, which is vital important to significantly increase the electrochemical performance. Notably, the as prepared CoNi2S4@CoS2/NF catalysts achieve optimized electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at low overpotentials of 259 mV and 173 mV while deliver 10 mA cm(-2) current density, respectively. It can be anticipated that it is a potential alternative catalyst for rational utilization in electrolytic water splitting fields. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman results suggested that the main phase of the samples gradually evolved from perovskite phase R3c to orthorhombic phase Pbnm with increasing Eu content and that the optical band gap gradually narrowed from 2.09 to 1.70 eV. Along with the structural change, the ferromagnetic properties were transformed, and interesting double hysteresis loops were observed for the sample where x = 0.1. All the bismuth ferrite (BFO) samples demonstrated extremely strong adsorbability, with the adsorption rate of refractory methyl orange reaching 90% in 5 min. These samples also exhibited superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, with a desirable onset potential of approximately 1.50 V vs. RHE. For the sample where x = 0.15, to support a current density of 100 mA/cm(2), an overpotential of only 294 mV was required, which is much better than that of pure Ni foam (330 mV). More experiments are needed to verify and explore the source and mechanism of the OER performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-424X			WOS:000772171100001

Forming active species (metal oxide/hydroxide) on the surface of metal non-oxide compounds is proven to be an effective strategy for improving activity. In this work, O-2 plasma-assisted strategy is employed to controllably construct 4-6 nm NiFeOx amorphous layer on the surface of NiFeP. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between NiFeP and NiFeOx, large electrochemical surface area, and favorable three-dimensional hierarchical nanostructure, the resulting NiFeOx/NiFeP/NF catalyst exhibits extraordinary water oxidation performance in alkaline media. A current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved at a low overpotential of 165 mV with good stability, which outperforms most of the transition-metal-based electrocatalyst reported. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the improved electrochemical performance of NiFeOx/NiFeP can be understood as a result of the optimized electronic structure and increased active catalytic sites. This work might shed light on the design and fabrication of efficient and durable electrode materials for a variety of electrochemical applications. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, we report the design and synthesis of co-doped Fe-Co4N@N-C nanosheet array derived from MOF precursor on carbon cloth as the dual-functional electrocatalyst to boost the reaction kinetics. The Fe, N co-doping significantly promotes the generation of abundant Pyridinic-N-M active sites for ORR due to the strong coordination effect between metal center and pyridinic nitrogen. The enriched Co3+ sites concurrently motivate the formation of targeted *OOH intermediates during OER with decreased charge transfer resistance. Such electrocatalyst therefore delivers high catalytic activity for both ORR and OER. When applied as air cathode for liquid Zn-air battery, the device exhibits a high specific energy density of 934 Wh kg(-1) with excellent cycling stability, which is superior to the referenced Pt and Ru-based Zn-air batteries. Flexible solid-state Zn-air battery can also achieve a high volumetric power density of 72 mW cm(-3) and good cycling durability under different bending states. This work gives a facile and cost-efficient strategy to construct bifunctional flexible electrode with enriched active sites for Zn-air batteries.									125	12	0	0	2	0	126			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000483451200086

Distinctive morphologies are obtained: nanowire-like structures, with mean diameter d=33nm (Pd-NW), forming an entangled network; nanocubes (Pd-NC) 64nm in side, and PdCo(NS) nanospheres 60nm in diameter. Pd:Co feed mol ratios (2:1) and (5:1) are used. Pd and Pd-Co nanostructures both crystallize in an fcc structure. A glassy carbon (GC) electrode is then modified with these colloidal dispersions, and further characterized by electrochemical methods. The modified Pd-NW/GC, Pd-NC/GC, and PdCoNS/GC electrodes are applied in the oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions, in a phosphate buffer pH 7 and 0.1M NaOH solution. Voltammetric measurements are consistent with a diffusion-controlled mechanism, with a four-electron reduction process in each Pd and PdCo nanoelectrode. Resulting values of kinetic parameters indicate that the relative effectiveness of these solutions in ORR may be ordered as PdCo (5:1)(NS)/GCPdCo (2:1)(NS)/GC>Pd-NC/GCPd(NW)/GC>GC. For the OER, Tafel slopes are measured for the nanosized electrodes in both types of supporting electrolytes. Turnover frequencies estimated in alkaline solution for the OER indicate that nanostructured bimetallic PdCoNS/GC electrodes exhibit better activity than Pd/GC ones.[GRAPHICS].									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000456211400001

Two composites with different axial bonding types between FePc and NGA, including a coordinate covalent bond (FePc/NGA-c) and non-covalent pi-pi stacking interaction (FePc/NGA-pi), are fabricated by reflux and physical mixing methods, respectively. Systematical characterizations confirmed the FePc/NGA-c composite using axial coordination between FePc and NGA substrate via the Fe-N-C bond exhibited more thermal stability and less stack and aggregation of FePc molecules in the composite. Combining the bifunctional catalytic activity of the FePc molecule with oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) processes and a flexible porous 3D structure and N-doping in NGA, the electrochemical test demonstrated both FePc anchored on NGA composites display higher activity as bifunctional catalysts for O-2 electrodes in Li-O-2 batteries. However, the FePc/NGA-c electrode displays better electrochemical performance than the FePc/NGA-pi composite due to the axial covalent connection of the FePc catalyst with NGA substrate, leading to higher electrocatalytic activity and exceptional structural durability during cycling for FePc/NGA-c. This work provides new insight into the steric effect of the coordination bond between FePc and NGA on the electrocatalytic activity of O-2 electrodes. These results indicate our unique structural design of FePc/NGA-c using solid FePc axially anchored on NGA via covalent bonding is a promising cathode material for high performance of rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries.

After times of evolution, it has been widely realized by the electrocatalytic process on anode nowadays. However, the anode applied in production contains a large amount of precious metal, increasing the cost. It is thus an opportunity to apply sub-nano catalysts in this field. By regulating the tip effect (TE) of the catalyst, it was discovered that the oxidized sub-nano iridium clusters supported by titanium carbide exhibit much higher efficiency than the single-atom one, which demonstrates the significance of modifying the electronic interaction. Moreover, it exhibits a approximate to 20 % decrease of the electricity, approximate to 98 % selectivity towards chlorine evolution reaction, and high durability of over 350 h. Therefore, this cluster catalyst performs great potential in applying in the practical production and the comprehension of the tip effect on different types of catalysts is also pushed to a higher level.									22	0	0	0	0	0	21			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000760142500001	35118786

Herein, we report a facile strategy for constructing Ni nanotube arrays (NTAs) on a Ni foam (NF) substrate through cathodic deposition of NiCu alloy followed by anodic stripping of metallic Cu. Based on Ni NTAs, the as-prepared NiSe2 NTA electrode by NiSe2 electrodeposition and the NiFeOx NTA electrode by dipping in Fe3+ solution exhibit excellent HER and OER performance in alkaline conditions. In these systems, Ni NTAs act as a binder-free multifunctional inner layer to support the electrocatalysts, offer a large specific surface area and serve as a fast electron transport pathway. Moreover, an alkaline electrolyzer has been constructed using NiFeOx NTAs as the anode and NiSe2 NTAs as the cathode, which only demands a cell voltage of 1.78 V to deliver a water-splitting current density of 500 mA cm(-2), and demonstrates remarkable stability during long-term electrolysis.

Using a consensus map, catalysts that showed high activity for both reactions and good resistance to anodic corrosion were identified in the Pt-Ru rich region of the Pt-Ru-Ir ternary. The ternary catalyst R4.5Ru4Ir0.5 (subscripts indicate atomic ratios) is significantly more active than the previously described Pt1Ir1 bifunctional catalyst for both reactions. While the best ternary catalyst is close to Pt1Ru1 in composition, the latter is unstable with respect to anodic corrosion. A detailed kinetic comparison of anodically stable catalysts Pt4.5Ru4Ir0.5 and Pt1Ir1 showed that the addition of the oxophilic element Ru increases the reaction rate by stabilizing S-O bonds (S drop surface atom) and accelerating the oxidative deprotonation of S-OH groups.

A special place is occupied by materials in the form of very thin films ( < 1 mu m) that reveal catalytic activity for various chemical and electrochemical processes. Such catalytic films open the way for new designs of structured reactors as well as constructions of electrodes for fuel cells and systems for water splitting. In this paper, a brief review of the research conducted in our laboratory on plasma-deposited nanocatalytic films based on cobalt oxides-their production, molecular and nano structure, and catalytic properties-is presented. The main attention is focused on the catalytic activity of the films in such processes as (1) volatile organic compounds (VOCs) combustion, (2) CO2 methanation, (3) CO2 hydration, (4) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) used in hydrogen fuel cells, and (5) oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which plays a key role in the water splitting process. The wide range of the PECVD method in the production of thin-film nanocatalysts, resulting from the possibility of a wide selection of suitable precursors and the manufacturing process conditions, the co-deposition from two or more precursors, and the preparation of sandwich-like systems, is particularly emphasized.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000482179500006

In this study, 4-ethylphenylacetylene-functionalized iridium (Ir-C , 1.7 +/- 0.3 nm in diameter) nanoparticles are found to exhibit markedly enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) in acidic and alkaline media, in comparison to the nanoparticles capped with mercapto and nitrene derivatives. Remarkably, the HER and OER performances in alkaline media are even better than those of commercial Ir/C and Pt/C benchmarks. This is accounted for by the formation of Ir-C C- conjugated interfacial linkage that leads to significant intraparticle charge delocalization and hence manipulation of the electron density of the Ir nanoparticles and interactions with key reaction intermediates. This is indeed confirmed by results from both spectroscopic measurements and density functional theory calculations. With Ir-C nanoparticles as both the cathode and anode catalysts for electrochemical water splitting, a low cell voltage of 1.495 and 1.473 V is needed to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and acidic media, respectively. Such a performance is markedly better than that of commercial Ir/C (1.548 and 1.561 V) and relevant catalysts reported in recent literature, highlighting the significance of interfacial engineering in the development of high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000618540300014

Regrettably, achieving the desired performances has remained a significant challenge in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report the synthesis of the xAu-Cu2O/carbon nanotube (CNTs) catalysts. In the case of 0.52Au-Cu2O/CNTs, the Au atoms are incorporated into the Cu2O lattice and an atomically dispersed Au is distributed on the outer shell regions of Cu2O microsphere, and it exhibits a superior ORR activity among the as-prepared catalysts due to strong interfacial coupling interaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the adsorption of O-2 on Au-Cu2O is the bridge mode between Cu and adjacent Au atoms, which can accelerate the kinetics of the O-O bond split and increase the dissociation of O-O bonds. The study evidences the significant role of interfacial coupling interaction in binary or multi-component electrocatalysts.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0009-2509	1873-4405		WOS:000782772200003

Spain). Kinetics and petrological significance								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MINERALOGY				28	2			337	353		10.1127/ejm/2016/0028-2518				MAR-APR 2016	2016	Kyanite is directly replaced by andalusite in quartz-plagioclase veins included within graphite-bearing micaschists of the Alpine Benamocarra Unit (Betic Cordillera, Spain). Electron back-scattered diffraction indicates that: i) precursory kyanite contains planar defects; andalusite growth was crystallographically controlled by the kyanite; and iii) the structure of both Al2SiO5 phases shares nearly the closest-packed oxygen array and chains of edge-sharing octahedra. The small entropy difference of the kyanite andalusite polymorphic inversion makes it difficult to overcome the energy barrier of this transformation. The driving force needed for the kyanite-to-andalusite reaction was a temperature (7) increase during a pre-Alpine tectonometamorphic evolution. The low-P/medium-T metamorphic conditions that affected the rocks studied took place in relation to a late Variscan extensional collapse. The reaction pathway proposed here corresponds to the first part of a poly-orogenic tectonometamorphic evolution, consisting of a pre-Alpine metamorphism of high thermal gradient with mainly static growth of porphyroblasts, followed by an essentially dynamic metamorphism during the Alpine orogeny.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0935-1221	1617-4011		WOS:000377922500010

Despite tremendous research efforts aimed at identifying earth-abundant 3d transition-metal-based catalysts, their insufficient catalytic efficiencies continue to jeopardize their real-world application. Herein, we introduce amorphous cobalt-iron phyllosilicates (ACFPs) as highly efficient OER catalysts. The ACFPs were designed by tailoring the metal chemistry of the phyllosilicate framework which consists of laminations of silicate (SiO4) layers and layered Co-Fe (oxy)hydroxide motifs, and prepared using a facile room-temperature precipitation method. It is demonstrated that the OER properties/mechanisms are sensitively affected by the Co/Fe ratio, with an exceptionally low overpotential (eta similar to 329 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) delivered at the optimized composition of 40 at% Fe. This catalytic efficiency is greater than that of the structurally analogous Co-Fe (oxy)hydroxide as well as those of pure Co or Fe phyllosilicate, suggesting the beneficial role of the phyllosilicate framework along with the synergistic interplay of Co and Fe ions in the framework. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the introduction of Fe at the surface of Co phyllosilicate perturbs the local structural environment of oxygen sites, providing additional active sites. This work proposes a valid strategy for the design of high-performance catalysts by chemically tuning both the redox-active and redox-inert elements concomitantly in novel multinary phyllosilicate-based OER catalysts.									13	2	0	0	0	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000479056700017

Herein, we illustrate the high-temperature transformation of bimetallic LDH to semicrystalline 2D metal oxide nanoplates that can maneuver their electronic properties and thereby accelerate the water dissociation reactions. The nanoplates prepared at 300 degrees C require only 280 +/- 13 and 177 +/- 7 mV overpotentials for oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER) to achieve a current density of +/- 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, respectively. In a two-electrode water splitting cell, while this bifunctional catalyst needs 1.69 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the LDH precursor demands a cell voltage of 1.93 V. However, both the catalysts demonstrate excellent durability for more than 200 h. When the bifunctional metal oxide electrolyzer is connected to perovskite solar cells for unassisted solar-driven water splitting, impressively, such an integrated photovoltaic-electrolyzer can achieve a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 9.3%. The predominantly superior catalytic activity of the nanoplates is due to the abundance of unsaturated oxygen which decreases the free energy of adsorption of the intermediates.									10	2	0	0	0	0	11			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000484073400017	31365230

This study reports a novel and facile approach to the hierarchical-structured sheet-on-sheet sandwich-like nanocomposite of CoNiOx/reduced graphene oxide as highly active electrocatalysts for water oxidation. Notably, the as-prepared composite can operate smoothly both in 0.1 and 1.0 M KOH alkaline media, displaying extremely low overpotentials, fast kinetics, and strong durability over long-term continuous electrolysis. Impressively, it is found that its catalytic activity can be further promoted by anodic conditioning owing to the in situ generation of electrocatalytic active species (i.e., metal hydroxide/(oxy)hydroxides) and the enriched oxygen deficiencies at the surface. The achieved ultrahigh performance is unmatched by most of the transition-metal/nonmetal-based catalysts reported so far, and even better than the state-of-the-art noble-metal catalysts, which can be attributed to its special well-defined physicochemical textural features including hierarchical architecture, large surface area, porous thin nanosheets constructed from CoNiOx nanoparticles (approximate to 5 nm in size), and the incorporation of charge-conducting graphene. This work provides a promising strategy to develop earth-abundant advanced OER electrocatalysts to replace noble metals for a multitude of renewable energy technologies.									89	4	0	0	7	0	89			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000398057000014

NO release varied time-dependently, similarly for the two inflammatory reactions. A first, but transient, peak was reached in 30 min while a second peak, more sustained, began at the fourth hour and was maximum at the tenth. Kinetic evolution of NO release was consistent with activation, in a first step, of a constitutive NO synthase probably from endothelial origin (inhibited by 2-Methyl-2-Thiopseudourea sulfate but not by dexamethasone) and with activation, in a second wave, of inducible NOS from endothelial and exudative cells. NO release was potentiated by administration per os of L-Arginine and seems to be involved in the evolution of acute inflammatory reactions and oxygen metabolite production.									7	1	0	0	6	0	8			0360-3997			WOS:A1996VZ42100003	8979150

We include the effects of accretion of supergiant envelope material during the common-envelope phase and re-accretion of material ejected during the nova outbursts of the semi-detached phase. We use the recent results of Prialnik & Kovetz (1995), concerning the effect of accretion onto a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, and Kovetz & Prialnik (1997), who calculated the isotopic abundances of the ejecta material in their nova outburst models. Our models give us the detailed composition of the secondary star throughout its whole evolution, since we use an extended nuclear reaction network. Using the data concerning the isotopic and element abundances on the surface of the secondary star, we show how the isotopic ratios C-12/C-13, N-14/N-15 and O-16/O-17 and the abundances of C and N are affected by accretion during the common-envelope phase and re-accretion of nova ejecta material during the semi-detached phase.

J	Coffey, GW; Pederson, LR; Rieke, PC								Competition between bulk and surface pathways in mixed ionic electronic conducting oxygen electrodes								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				150	8			A1139	A1151		10.1149/1.1591758				AUG 2003	2003	Two parallel pathways have been identified for oxygen reduction and evolution on mixed ionic electronic conductors (MIECs). Charge transfer may proceed by reaction at the triple-phase boundary to consume or produce oxygen adsorbed on the surface of the MIEC. Alternatively, charge transfer may proceed by reaction of oxygen with oxygen vacancies and electronic holes from the bulk of the MIEC with subsequent exchange of vacancies with the purely ionic conducting electrolyte. A continuum mass-transport model is developed describing the competition between these two charge-transfer pathways. Key to the model is treatment of the boundary condition at the MIEC-electrolyte interface. The absolute potential across this interface is used to relate the surface overpotential of each pathway in terms of the other and terms arising from the concentration overpotentials. The current attributable to each of the two pathways can be determined. Results show that the two pathways have different dependence on cell overpotential and competition for reagents creates complex mass-transport dependencies. One pathway may dominate at low overpotentials and the other at high overpotentials. The dependence of current on oxygen partial pressure is shown to transit from +1/2 power dependence to zero or negative power dependence as pressure increases, or to transit from zero or negative to +1/2 power depending on which pathway dominates.

In particular, the effect of the presence of a very low quantity of electro-deposited cobalt on a porous Ni electrode directly interfaced with a commercial anionic membrane was evaluated. The modified Ni-Co structure was investigated by XRD, SEM, EDS and XPS, and showed different characteristics compared to the starting Ni structure with a surface ratio of Co equal to Ni. The catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the electrode/membrane interface increased considerably compared to pure nickel and reached the same level as a Ni/Pt reference electrode. We believe that this methodology, if further optimized, could open a new way to find an effective improved doping of the nickel anode able to work with alkaline membrane electrolysers.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000514749800091

However, the practical application of LOB cells is largely blocked by the poor cycling performance of cathode materials. Herein, an ultralong 440-cycle life of an LOB cell is achieved using CeO2 nanocubes super-assembled on an inverse opal carbon matrix as the cathode material without any additives. CeO2 is proved to be effective for the complete and sensitive decomposition of loosely stacked Li2O2 films during the oxygen evolution reaction process and full accommodation of volume changes caused by the fast growth of Li2O2 films during the oxygen reduction reaction process. The super-assembled porous CeO2/C frameworks satisfy critical requirements including controlled size, morphology, high Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio, and efficient volume change accommodation, which dramatically increase the cycle life of LOB cell to 440 cycles. This study reveals the design strategy for high performance CeO2 catalyst cathodes for LOB cells and the generation mechanisms of Li2O2 films during the discharge process by using density functional theory calculations, showing new avenues for improving the future smart design of CeO2-based cathode catalysts for Li-O-2 batteries.									70	5	0	0	2	0	71			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000486846200001

However, the real properties of a single MOF are highly dependent on the morphology and surface chemistry for specific applications. Herein, an in situ confined interface transformation process to spontaneously manipulate the diverse morphology and surface composition of a single bulk MOF electrodeposited was realized via a mass transport limited deposition process. The regulation of the mass transport process including electromigration, diffusion and forced diffusion allows the manipulation of interfacial ion-ligand concentrations for the conversion between dissolution and precipitation, which endows the interface with the ability to regulate the morphology and composition for diverting chemistry. In particular, interfacial etching and in situ precipitation processes enable the formation of Fe-trimesic acid nanodot-embedded nanorods with superior oxygen evolution activity and remarkable long-term durability over 800 h. Operando probing of intermediates via reactions with nucleophiles verifies that the favorable surface chemistry of hierarchical composite structures would optimize the binding energy for intermediate formation. The uncoordinated carboxylates serve as proton transfer relays, accelerating the proton transfer process and boosting the oxygen evolution performance. Furthermore, to address the potential safety hazard, ferricyanide was used as a proton-independent electron reservoir to decouple water electrolysis for favorable energy conversion in an electrolyzer design. This facile, scalable, and cost-effective interface transformation strategy offers spontaneous control over the MOF structure and composition for desirable electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000818963200001

Herein, a trifunctional electrocatalyst based on iron-doped metal-organic framework assisted cobalt vanadate integrated with cobalt oxide (Fe doped MOF CoV@CoO nanoflakes) is described in a facile synthetic approach. This synthetic strategy provides a unique nanoflakes heterostructure, an abundant porous structure, high specific surface area, and extremely large active sites. Additionally, the nitrogen element is also incorporated into the MOF scaffold during the pyrolysis under the nitrogen environment, greatly facilitating the electrochemical behavior. The prepared Fe doped MOF CoV@CoO nanoflakes catalysts possess excellent and stable electrochemical activity for ORR, OER, HER, and overall water splitting reaction. The rechargeable zinc-air battery is fabricated using Fe doped MOF CoV@CoO nanoflakes as an air cathode having excellent charge-discharge performance and high cyclic stability. Eventually, the developed zinc-air battery is used as self-power water splitting for the overall water splitting under room temperature.

Structural and morphological characterizations of RuO2 are investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TG-DTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS) and Raman spectroscopy. The TEM images of as prepared material show the uniform distribution of RuO2 nanoparticles with mean diameter of ca. 1.5 nm. Analysis on as prepared material indicates the structural formula as [RuO2 center dot 2.6H(2)O] 0.7H(2)O with low crystallinity. The influence of annealing temperature on RuO2 is studied in light of electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and capacitance. Electrochemical performances of RuO2 electrodes are followed by current-potential curves, galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles and evolved oxygen measurements. The amount of oxygen gas evolved during the OER by the crystalline RuO2 is found to be consistent with the electrical energy supplied to the catalyst. The cyclic voltammogram of RuO2 exhibits the typical capacitance behavior with highly reversible nature. The specific capacitance of hydrous RuO2 is found to be 737 Fg(-1) at the scan rate of 2 my s(-1), by the balanced transport of proton through the structural water and electron transport along dioxo bridges, which makes a suitable material for energy storage. The specific capacitance decreases with increase in the crystallinity of RuO2. The present study shows the potential method to synthesize rapid and uniform nano particles of RuO2 for water electrolysis and supercapacitors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	MEI, R; YOCUM, CF								CALCIUM RETARDS NH2OH INHIBITION OF O2 EVOLUTION ACTIVITY BY STABILIZATION OF MN2+ BINDING TO PHOTOSYSTEM-II								BIOCHEMISTRY				30	31			7836	7842		10.1021/bi00245a025				AUG 6 1991	1991	Calcium is required for oxidation of water to molecular oxygen by photosystem II; the Ca2+ demand of the reaction increases upon removal of 23- and 17-kDa extrinsic polypeptides from detergent-derived preparations of the photosystem. Employing the manganese reductant NH2OH as a probe to examine the function of Ca2+ in photosystem II reveals that (1) Ca2+ slows the rate of NH2OH inhibition Of O2 evolution activity, but only in photosystem II membranes depleted of extrinsic proteins, (2) other divalent cations (Sr2+, Cd2+) that compete for the Ca2+ site also slow NH2OH inhibition, (3) Ca2+ is noncompetitive with respect to NH2OH, (4) in order to slow inhibition, Ca2+ must be present prior to the initiation of NH2OH reduction of manganese, and (5) Ca2+ appears not to interfere with NH2OH reduction of manganese. We conclude that the ability of Ca2+ to slow the rate of NH2OH inhibition arises from the site in photosystem II where Ca2+ normally stimulates O2 evolution and that the mechanism of this phenomenon arises from the ability of Ca2+ or certain surrogate metals to stabilize the ligation environment of the manganese complex.									34	1	0	0	25	0	36			0006-2960			WOS:A1991FZ96500025	1907848

By using a powder metallurgy based process, where metallic titanium and nickel powders are pressed and thermally treated to form "brown compacts", we obtain electrodes that benefit from a 1000-fold increase in the electrochemical surface area (ECSA). In addition, active catalytic species for water oxidation (i.e.NiOOH) are generated during the processing converting these electrodes as ideal candidates for evaluation in oxidation reactions. Excellent OER performance is obtained with overpotentials below 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), exceeding those of commercially available alternatives. The current work paves the way for a generic method that will be extended to other electrochemical reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000552930600016

In the process of hydrothermal reaction, g-C3N4 nanosheets were oxidized by hydrogen peroxide and then dehydration reaction occurred between C-OH groups to form the C-O-C groups, resulting in a relatively stable oxygen doped g-C3N4 nanosheets wrapped on the surface of ZnO nanoparticles. The photocatalytic performance of ZnO/oxygen-doped g-C3N4 sample showed significant photocatalytic activity, higher than ZnO, g-C3N4 nanosheets and ZnO/g-C3N4 samples. The PL spectra indicated that the stable core-shell heterojunction of ZnO/oxygen-doped g-C3N4 composite could block the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs effectively and remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity.

In order to improve the efficiency and conductivity, these molecular catalysts need to be immobilized on conductive electrode materials. Herein, a facile "one-pot" strategy was developed to coat a covalent metalloporphyrin polymer on a carbon nanotube (CNT) as bifunctional catalysts [denoted as MTIPP@CNTs, H2TIPP = 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-(imidazole-1-yl)phenyl)porphyrin)] for water splitting in alkaline solution. MTIPP@CNTs have shown excellent electrocatalytic activities for both the HER and OER when metalloporphyrin's central metal is optimized as well as the amount of catalysts that is loaded on the CNT. The overpotential (eta(10)) of NiTIPP@CNT-2 for the OER is only 320 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, and CoTIPP@CNT-1 exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic activity for the HER (eta(10) = 450 mV for 10 mA cm(-2)). Furthermore, the remarkable bifunctional electrocatalytic performance (a cell voltage of 2.04 V with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) was also explored in the overall water splitting test.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000818688100001	35737475

Cobalt and Li-doped cobalt oxides were obtained by different preparation techniques and were applied to chemically-pickled nickel plates. The obtained phases were structurally characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, The electrodes were subjected to electrochemical measurements, before and after electrochemical ageing (21 days, 150 mA cm(-2)). The correlation between the coating preparations and their electrocatalytic activity was investigated. The efficiency of the studied electrodes seems to depend on the preparation method. Two Tafel slopes for the OER were observed in most cases. This behaviour was interpreted on the basis of a change in the valence state of the surface oxide.

Herein, we report a composite bifunctional catalyst, Co3O4 nanoparticles-decorated carbon nanofibers (CNFs), working as an efficient air-cathode in high performance rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZnABs). The particles-on-fibers nanohybrid materials were derived from electrospun metal-ion containing polymer fibers followed by thermal carbonization and a post annealing process in air at a moderate temperature. Electrochemical studies suggest that the nanohybrid material effectively catalyzes oxygen reduction reaction via an ideal 4-electron transfer process and outperforms Pt/C in catalyzing oxygen evolution reactions. Accordingly, the prototype ZnABs exhibit a low discharge-charge voltage gap (e.g. 0.7 V, discharge-charge at 2 mA cm(-2)) with higher stability and longer cycle life compared to their counterparts constructed using Pt/C in air-cathode. Importantly, the hybrid nanofiber mat readily serves as an integrated air-cathode without the need of any further modification. Benefitting from its efficient catalytic activities and structural advantages, particularly the 3D architecture of highly conductive CNFs and the high loading density of strongly attached Co3O4 NPs on their surfaces, the resultant ZnABs show significantly improved performance with respect to the rate capability, cycling stability and current density, promising good potential in practical applications.									199	6	0	0	5	0	201			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000348348300036	25522330

A comprehensive study based on statistical design of experiments is presented to investigate and optimize the surfactant-assisted structure and the resultant bifunctional ORR/OER activity of anodically deposited manganese oxide (MnOx) catalysts. Three classes of surfactants are studied: anionic (sodium,dodecyl sulfate, SDS), non-ionic (t-octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol, Triton X-100), and cationic (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB). The adsorption of surfactants has two main effects: increased deposition current density due to higher Mn2+ and Mn3+ concentrations at the outer Helmholtz plane (Frumkin effect on the electrodeposition kinetics) and templating of the MnOx nanostructure. CTAB produces MnOx with nanoneedle (1D) morphology, whereas nanospherical- and nanopetal-like morphologies are obtained with,SDS and Triton, respectively. The bifunctional performance is assessed based on three criteria: OER/ORR onset potential window (defined at 2 and -2 mA cm(-2)) and separately the ORR and OER mass activities. The best compromise among these three criteria is obtained either with Triton X-100 deposited catalyst composed of MnOOH arid Mn3O4 or SDS deposited catalyst containing a combination of alpha- and beta-MnO2, MnOOH, and Mn3O4.The interaction effects among the deposition variables (surfactant type and concentration, anode potential, Mn2+ concentration, and temperature) reveal the optimal strategy for high-activity bifunctional MnOx catalyst synthesis. Mass activities for OER and ORR up to 49 A g(-1) (at 1556 mV(RHE)) and -1.36 A g(-1) (at 656 mV(RHE)) are obtained, respectively.									23	2	0	0	0	0	23			1944-8244			WOS:000408178400015	28718625

However, as the key reactions in renewable metal-air batteries and fuel cells, the energy conversion efficiencies of ORR and OER are greatly affected by their reaction kinetics. In addition to designing excellent electrocatalysts, new methods to stabilize the electrolyte/electrode interfaces are urgently needed. Herein, a hierarchical Co(OH)F/CuCo2S4 hybrid was created as an efficient catalyst for OER and ORR in alkaline media. Combining spinel ferrite with the hydroxide can greatly boost their catalytic performance. The optimal Co(OH)F/CuCo2S4 hybrid exhibits superior OER performance and durable stability, as demonstrated by an ultralow overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2). The onset potential and the half-wave potential in 0.1 M KOH solution for ORR are 0.88 and 0.80 V, respectively. Furthermore, the Co(OH)F/CuCo2S4 hybrid served as a catalyst in Zn air batteries catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 1.12 V at 50.0 mA.cm(-2), large power density of 144 mW.cm(-2), and a long electrochemical lifetime of 118 h (118 cycles), which is even better than those of the Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. The rational integration of spinel and hydroxide at the interface can provide multifunctional electrocatalysis and possess a high reactivity for oxygen conversion. Synergistic coupling effect and interfacial electronic interaction between Co(OH)F and CuCo2S4 can significantly enhance the electron transfer rate, and these synergistic advantages enable the heterogeneous structure of the multifunctional electrocatalyst to produce excellent catalytic performance.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000491219700014	31507165

Compared with the pristine alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode, the presence of surface oxygen vacancies can improve the water oxidation activity and stability of the alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode simultaneously, but the bulk oxygen vacancies have a negative effect on the water oxidation performance of the alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode. In thermodynamics, our investigations revealed that the presence of surface oxygen vacancies narrows the space charge region width of the alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode, which could boost the charge separation and transfer efficiency of the alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode during water oxidation. Because the surface property and hydrophilicity of alpha-Fe2O3 are modified owing to the presence of surface oxygen vacancies, the water oxidation kinetics of the alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode with surface oxygen vacancies is obviously boosted. Our findings in the present work provide comprehensive understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic differences for alpha-Fe2O3 photoanodes with and without oxygen vacancies for solar water oxidation.									26	0	0	0	3	0	26			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526609100032	32073812

Herein, trifunctional electrocatalysts comprising cobalt nanoparticles uniformly embedded in porous carbon networks were fabricated using a spent tea leaves (STL) template via a one-step carbothermal-reduction strategy at different temperatures. STL played a synthetic dual role in constructing nanocatalysts by acting as efficient scavengers to trap cobalt cations via electrostatic interactions and as carbon sources to generate a porous carbon matrix. Full characterization of the as-synthesized materials revealed the crucial effect of temperature on the crystallinity, surface area, number of surface defects and interfacial charge distribution properties. Furthermore, the trifunctional catalytic activity of the nanoparticles can be finely tuned by varying the carbonization temperature. Co@PC-7 displayed a superior trifunctional catalytic activity exhibiting an excellent performance for hydrogen production with an overpotential of 153 mV (vs.,RHE) to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), and an impressive bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity with an ultralow potential difference between OER and ORR (Delta E=eta(10)-E-1/2) of 0.69 V, which is one of the lowest values reported in the literature for transition metal nanocatalysts. The remarkable performance of Co@PC-7 is mainly ascribed to its unique structural properties, which give rise to highly desirable charge distributions at the metal/carbon electrochemical interfaces to perform efficient trifunctional water splitting electrocatalysis.									26	0	0	0	8	0	26			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000579757000025

Herein, a nitrogen-doped CoP nanorod array over 3D porous Co foam (CoP-N/Co foam) is proposed as a bifunctional high-performance catalyst for the water splitting reaction. It can afford a current density of 50 mA cm 2 with an overpotential of 100 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction and 260 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction; as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water-splitting, to reach a current density of 50 mA cm 2, the CoP-N/Co foamkCoP-N/Co foam catalyst system requires a cell voltage of 1.61 V, significantly lower than the value of 1.78 V required for the RuO2/Co foamkPt/C/Co foam electrode system assembled using the state-of-the-art commercial catalysts, and also outperforming most of the analogous catalysts reported recently. This electrolyzer can retain a current density of 50 mA cm 2 over 25 h of continuous operation without obvious performance degradation. Even under strongly corrosive and high oxidation potential conditions, the morphology and structure of the N-CoP nanorods strongly coupled with the Co foam were well retained after the electrocatalytic process. In order to deeply understand the catalytic contribution from doping and the morphology and support effects, Co foam, Pdoped Co foam, CoP/Co foam and CoP-N/Co foam as catalysts were comparatively evaluated by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques. It is found that simple doping of non-metallic nitrogen into CoP can greatly increase its catalytic activity, stability, kinetics and catalytic efficiency for water splitting both in the anode and cathode reaction. The present work provides an efficient approach for performance enhancements of metal phosphide catalysts and a promising electrode for energy-efficient water electrolysis.									102	4	0	0	8	0	103			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000471010900032

However, the in-depth understanding of the relationship among the amorphous structure, vacancy defect, and catalytic activity is still obscure. Herein, a facile strategy was proposed to prepare ultrathin and amorphous Mo-FeS nanosheets (NSs) with abundant sulfur defects. Benefited from the ultrathin, amorphous nanostructure, and syner effect of Mo-doping and sulfur defect, the Mo-FeS NSs manifested excellent electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium, as shown by an ultralow overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope of SO mV dec(-1), and retaining such good catalytic stability over 30 h. The efficient catalytic performance for Mo-FeS NSs is superior to the commercial IrO2 and most reported top-performing electrocatalysts. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the accelerated electron/mass transfer over the oxygen-containing intermediates can be attributed to the amorphous structure and sulfur-rich defects caused by structural reconfiguration. Furthermore, the S vacancies could enhance the activity of its neighboring Fe-active sites, which was also beneficial to their OER kinetics. This work integrated both amorphous structures and sulfur vacancies into ultrathin 2D NSs and further systematically evaluated the OER performance, providing new insights for the design of amorphous-layered electrocatalysts.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000592923100072	33164498

A single site computational description assumes a 4-step electrochemical mechanism with coupled H+/e(-) transfers between 4 intermediates (M-*, M-OH, M=O, M-OOH). We also consider bifunctional routes, in which an unstable M-OOH species converts via a proton shuttling pathway to a thermodynamically more favourable bare M-* site, O-2 and a hydrogenated acceptor site; the acceptor site takes up the proton forming a hydrogenated acceptor site after recombination with an electron from the catalyst material. Here, we combine pure metal gamma-M(O)(OH) edge sites (M=Fe, Co, Ni) with as proton-acceptor sites different threefold coordinated oxygens on beta-(M,M')(O)(OH) terraces (M,M'=Fe, Co, Ni). The acceptor sites on these terraces have of a M'2MO motif. Our combinatorial study results in a ranking of the bifunctional OER activity on a 3D-volcano plot. By studying various bi- and tri-metallic oxy hydroxide combinations, we show that their excellent experimental OER activity results from bifunctionality and provide a roadmap to construct innovative low overpotential OER catalysts.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000505822700001

This study explores the potentiostatic electrodeposition process of Ni onto polycrystalline Ir (Ir-poly) and assesses the electrocatalytic properties of the resulting bimetallic surfaces. The electrodeposition resulted in bimetallic Ni overlayer (OL) structures and in combination with controlled thermal post-deposition annealing in bimetallic near-surface alloys (NSA). The catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of these two different Ni-modified catalysts is assessed and compared to a pristine, unmodified Ir-poly. An overlayer of Ni on Ir-poly showed superior performance in both acidic and alkaline milieu. The reductive annealing of the OL produced a NSA of Ni, which demonstrated enhanced stability in an acidic environment. The remarkable activity and stability improvement of Ir by Ni modification makes both systems efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation. The roughness factor of Ir-poly is also reported. With the amount of deposited Ni determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and a degree of coverage (monolayer) in the dependence of deposition potential is established. The density functional theory (DFT) assisted evaluation of H adsorption on Ir-poly enables determination of the preferred Ni deposition sites on the three low-index surfaces (111), (110), and (100).									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2571-9637		WOS:000717431400001		
J	Meng, Jiao; Zhao, Yue; Li, Haining; Chen, Ruiping; Sun, Xun; Sun, Xuan								Metalloporphyrin immobilized CeO2: in situ generation of active sites and synergistic promotion of photocatalytic water oxidation								CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				11	7			2560	2569		10.1039/d0cy02409k				APR 7 2021	2021	Inhibiting photo-generated charge recombination on molecular catalysts (MCs) and accelerating reaction kinetics on semiconductor catalysts are desired for promoting photocatalytic water oxidation. Coupling MCs with semiconductors to mimic natural photosynthetic systems may provide a smart strategy to simultaneously achieve the above targets. However, the lack of understanding for the interface interaction between the MCs and the semiconductors remains a key challenge to unlock the photocatalytic performance. Herein, we coupled two nonprecious-metal catalysts, cobalt porphyrin (CoTCPP) and cerium oxide (CeO2 nanotubes), that are well matched in energy levels, to form CoTCPP@CeO2 composites by facile solution synthesis. The interface interaction was systematically evaluated in terms of charge transfer and surface catalytic reaction. It was found that CoTCPP acts initially as a charge transporter to transfer photoexcited electrons to CeO2 by d-f electron coupling, which effectively suppresses the charge recombination. Furthermore, the interfacial charge transfer results in reduction on CeO2 accompanied with the creation of oxygen vacancies (OVs) and oxidation on CoTCPP that transforms into CoOOH. The in situ generated OVs and CoOOH species both act as the active sites to synergistically accomplish the photocatalytic water oxidation, thereby resulting in significantly boosted oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance and long-term stability in neutral or even acidic environments. The CoTCPP@CeO2NTs with an optimized composition ratio exhibit superior catalytic water oxidation characteristics in a neutral environment triggered by light, including a high oxygen production of 30 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) and ultralong durability, which highly prevail over the performance of analogous systems such as H2TCPP@CeO2 NTs, Co3O4@CeO2 NTs and TCPP@Co3O4@CeO2 NTs under the same conditions. These findings disclosed the interfacial interactions between the heterogeneous components in terms of charge transfer and surface catalytically active sites, demonstrated the necessity of d-f electron coupling for effective charge transfer to inhibit charge recombination, and provided a smart strategy that highlights the in situ generation of catalytically active species, for instance, the OVs and oxyhydroxide, for promoting the photocatalytic OER and improving the catalytic durability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000639998200019

However, large overpotential and poor long-term stability still prohibit their usage in many reactions (e.g., oxygen evolution/reduction). With regard to the low natural abundance, the improvement of their overall electrocatalytic performance (activity, selectivity, and stability) was urgently necessary. Herein, strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) was modulated through an unprecedented time-dependent mechanical milling method on Pd-loaded oxygenated TiC electrocatalysts. The encapsulation of Pd surfaces with reduced TiO2-x overlayers is precisely controlled by the mechanical milling time. This encapsulation induced a valence band restructuring and lowered the d-band center of surface Pd atoms. For hydrogen peroxide electrosynthesis through the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), these electronic and geometric modifications resulted in optimal adsorption energies of reaction intermediates. Thus, SMSI phenomena not only enhanced electrocatalytic activity and selectivity but also created an encapsulating oxide overlayer that protected the Pd species, increasing its long-term stability. This SMSI induced by mechanical milling was also extended to other noble metal systems, showing great promise for the large-scale production of highly stable and tunable electrocatalysts.									15	1	0	0	0	0	14			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000766221400030	35094512

The composite oxides have been anodically deposited according to two different procedures: (i) the electrolysis of suspensions of RuO2 particles in Pb2+ -containing electrolytes, or (ii) the electrolysis of solutions containing both Pb2+ and Ru3+. Both procedures are essentially successful, as the passivation of Ti (previously etched in aqueous HF) does not prevent oxide deposition. The former route leads to more active materials than the latter. Considering the oer overpotential and service life, the performance of these layers deposited on Ti is comparable to or better than those of oxides grown on a noble substrate (described in a previous paper).

The potential decay curves of the anode measured every 0.1 mu sec and 0.4 msec after the interruption of a high polarization current density differentiated discharges of the oxide condenser and the electrochemical double layer. The potential measured by galvanostatic polarization was the sum of the potential drop based on the solution resistance, the overpotential for the electrochemical reaction, the equilibrium potential of the reaction and the potential drop based on the oxide resistance. The potential difference, Delta E-j, at individual current density, j, between galvanostatic polarization curves of an anode after and before electrolysis showed a linear increase beginning from the origin of the coordinate axes with current density, j, the gradient, partial derivative Delta E-j/partial derivative(j), of which corresponded to the difference in the oxide resistance after and before electrolysis at the high current density. The linear increase of the potential difference after and before electrolysis with current density of galvanostatic polarization and the gradient increase with time of electrolysis indicated the electric resistance increase by electrolysis at the high current density without change in the electrochemical properties of the anode surface. The oxide resistance for the anode examined became about 0.8 m Omega m(2) after oxygen evolution for 430 h at 2000 A m(-2). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, a group of hydrothermal growth of CoCu bimetallic active center organic frameworks on three-dimensional graphene sponge (3DGS-CoCu-MOF) were designed, and fabricated as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A series of electrochemical experiments showed that in the 0.1 mol L-1 KOH electrolyte, the overpotential of the optimal 3DGS-Co(3.0)Cu1.0-MOF was 460 mV, the slope of Tafel curve was 172 mV dec(-1), the charge transfer resistance (Rct) was 16.38 Omega cm(-2), ECSA was 12.5 cm(-2), and R-f was 176.06. After the test of 20000 s, the current density still maintains 95.07%. The better electrocatalytic performance and the long-term electrochemical durability indicated that the 3DGS-Co3.0Cu1.0-MOF material possessed good OER performance. The optimal 3DGS-Co3.0Cu1.0-MOF employed three-dimensional graphene sponge as the conductive substrate, bimetallic active center acted as the main body of the catalyst, and made full use of the synergistic effect of the bimetallic center.

We report the reversible control of coordination structure in atomically dispersed electrocatalysts via ligand exchange reactions to reversibly modulate their reactivity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The CO-ligated atomically dispersed Rh catalyst exhibited ca. 30-fold higher ORR activity than the NHx-ligated catalyst, whereas the latter showed three times higher H2O2 selectivity than the former. Post-treatments of the catalysts with CO or NH3 allowed the reversible exchange of CO and NHx ligands, which reversibly tuned oxidation state of metal centers and their ORR activity and selectivity. DFT calculations revealed that more reduced oxidation state of CO-ligated Rh site could further stabilize the *OOH intermediate, facilitating the two- and four-electron pathway ORR. The reversible ligand exchange reactions were generalized to Ir- and Pt-based catalysts.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000681754500001	34263519

Herein, carbon cloth (CC)-supported Earth-abundant CoS2 nanosheet arrays (CoS2/CC) are presented as ideal substrates for ultrafine Pt deposition (Pt-CoS2/CC) to achieve remarkable performance toward the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) in alkaline solutions. Notably, the Pt-CoS2/CC hybrid delivers an overpotential of 24 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a mass activity of 3.89 A Pt-mg(-1), which is 4.7 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C, at an overpotential of 130 mV for catalyzing the HER. An alkali-electrolyzer using Pt-CoS2/CC as a bifunctional electrode enables a water-splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of 1.55 V and can sustain for more than 20 h, which is superior to that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C+RuO2 catalyst. Further experimental and theoretical simulation studies demonstrate that strong electronic interaction between Pt and CoS2 synergistically optimize hydrogen adsorption/desorption behaviors and facilitate the in situ generation of OER active species, enhancing the overall water-splitting performance.

Herein, we have developed a facile approach to nanoscale Co-doped iron phosphide (CoFe-P) with spindle-like morphology via topological conversion of a bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOF). It is found that the morphology of nanospindle together with Co-doping induced downsizing is beneficial for the increase of electrochemical active surface area to expose more active centers for catalysis and, meanwhile, promoting mass transportation. Significantly, incorporation of Co species in Fe-P host can favorably modulate the local electronic structure of the electrocatalytic active sites, giving rise to enhanced intrinsic activity. Consequently, the spindle-like Co engineered Fe-P presents remarkable OER performance, making it on par with the state-of-the-art OER catalysts reported so far. Impressively, this approach is versatile; other transition metals such as Mn, Ni, Cu, La, and Ce can be doped into the Fe-P host to achieve tunable electrocatalytic activities. This work not only provides a cost-effective advanced Fe-based electrocatalyst by Co doping but also highlights that the rational architectural design and electronic modulation is an effective protocol to significantly boost performance of the electrocatalysts for future renewable energy technologies.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2168-0485			WOS:000543715400034

Sur-face characterisation revealed controlled cooling rate results in compact coatings. E-oc data and CV spectra support surface electrochemistry of mixed oxides of as prepared electrodes is controlled by the Ir(III)/Ir(IV) redox couple, being the relative surface composition given by a(Ir(III)) congruent to 5a(Ir(IV)). A minimum in the active surface area and electrochemical porosity was observed for the 40-50 mol% IrO2-contents. Kinetics were studied recording polarisation curves for different conditions of temperature and supporting electrolyte. Tafel slope data showed the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/electrochemical ozone production (EOP) processes to depend on both nominal electrode composition and nature of the supporting electrolyte. The anomalous dependence on temperature of the Tafel slope is attributed to anion adsorption and gas bubble adherence. The activation energy for the OER process depends on electrode composition and nature of the supporting electrolyte. Current efficiency data for EOP (Phi(EOP)) were calculated at 0 degreesC for all electrodes and supporting electrolytes investigated and showed low performance for this reaction.

Because of the sufficient active sites in edge of the holes, high specific surface area, porous framework and high conductivity of NF substrate, Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites show the outstanding activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and benzylamine oxidation reaction (BOR) in alkaline electrolyte. Importantly, Ni2P-UNMs/NF nanocomposites can directly act as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the electrochemical water-splitting in two electrode system in the presence of benzylamine, which only requires an electrolysis voltage of 1.41 V to achieve the 10 mA cm(-2) current density in alkaline electrolyte, accompanying with H-2 production at cathode and value-added benzonitrile production at anode. Obviously, the BOR boosted electrochemical water-splitting provides an energy-saving and cost-competitive H-2 production method.									61	2	0	0	3	0	61			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000521513300038

Although the enhanced performance has commonly been attributed to bulk effects such as increased conductivity, recent studies have noted an impact of doping on the efficiency of the interfacial transfer of holes involved in the oxygen evolution reaction. However, the methods used were not able to elucidate the origin of this improved efficiency, which could originate from passivation of surface electron-hole recombination or catalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction. The present study used intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS), which is a powerful small amplitude perturbation technique that can de-convolute the rate constants for charge transfer and recombination at illuminated semiconductor electrodes. The method was applied to examine the kinetics of water oxidation on thin solution-processed hematite model photoanodes, which can be Sn-doped without morphological change. We observed a significant increase in photocurrent upon Sn-doping, which is attributed to a higher transfer efficiency. The kinetic data obtained using IMPS show that Sn-doping brings about a more than tenfold increase in the rate constant for water oxidation by photogenerated holes. This result provides the first demonstration that Sn-doping speeds up water oxidation on hematite by increasing the rate constant for hole transfer.									134	2	0	0	10	0	134			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000344249400053	25310963

Herein, we report a novel cobalt-ion-exchange and pyrolysis strategy with the well-designed bio-MOF-1 as the self-template to prepare ultra-small cobalt nanoparticles embedded into N-doped hierarchical porous carbon (Co@N-HPC-800) with excellent electrical conductivity, high surface area and abundant Co-N-4 active sites. The electrochemical test results verify the outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic activity and stability of Co@N-HPC-800 in alkaline condition, even outperforming the commercial Pt/C + RuO2 electrocatalysts. The in situ Raman technique demonstrates the ORR and OER catalytic process occur through the redox of Co(II) and Co(III) species. The rechargeable Zn-air battery (ZAB) assembled with Co@N-HPC-800 cathode deliveries an open circuit voltage of 1.42 V, a specific capacity of 129 mAh cm(-2), a peak power density of 89.1 mW cm(-2), and stable cyclability over 85 h at 5 mA cm(-2) by refreshing the electrolyte. The Co@N-HPC-800 cathode in a flexible quasi-solid-state ZAB exhibits good flexibility and stability under different bending states. This work paves a simple and valuable way for designing non-noble high-efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts in Zn-air batteries and related energy storage and conversion technologies.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000774907500006

In this work, the electronic properties (band structure, density of states (DOS), and band edge placement) of (MMIII)-M-II-LDHs (M-II = Mg, Co, Ni and Zn; M-III = Al and Ga) were studied in detail. The thermodynamic mechanism toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was investigated by using the density functional theory plus U (DFT + U) method. The calculation results of band structure indicate that Mg and Zn-based LDHs (band gap energies larger than 3.1 eV) are ultraviolet responsive, while Co and Ni-based LDHs are responsive to visible light (band gap energies less than 3.1 eV). The DOS calculations reveal that the photogenerated hole localizes on the surface hydroxyl group of LDHs, facilitating the oxidization of a water molecule without a long transportation route. The band edge placements of (MMIII)-M-II-LDHs show that NiGa-, CoAl-, ZnAl-, and NiAl-LDHs have a driving force (0.965 eV, 0.836 eV, 0.667 eV, and 0.426 eV, respectively) toward oxygen evolution. However, the thermodynamic mechanism of these four LDHs reveal that only CoAl-LDH can overcome the reaction barrier (0.653 eV) via the driving force of photogenerated hole (0.836 eV). Experimental observations of MgAl-, CoAl-, and ZnAl-LDHs further prove that only CoAl-LDH is an efficient oxygen evolution photocatalyst (O-2 generation rate: 973 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)), agreeing well with the theoretical prediction. Therefore, this work provides an effective theoretical and experimental combined method for screening possible photocatalysts, which can be extended to other semiconductor materials in addition to LDHs.									135	10	0	0	14	0	138			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000360026200001

Here, we show a wet-chemistry-based synthesis of dendritic Au@PtIr nanowires (NWs) with core-shell constructions regarding Te NWs as sacrificial templates for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Regarding the synthesis of Au@PtIr NWs, Au NWs are firstly obtained through galvanic replacement with Te templates, followed by growth of alloy PtIr shells in subsequent seed-mediated growth. The as synthesized core-shell Au@PtIr nanowires combine the advantage of one-dimensional (1D) dendritic feature that facilitate fast electron transport and provide more interfaces and interstices between catalytic active sites and electrolyte, with the synergistic interactions in alloy shells. Consequently, the as-prepared Au@PtIr NWs show good catalytic properties in MOR and HER in terms of higher activity, larger electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) and better anti-toxicity than commercial Pt/C.

However, the influence of doped metal ions on their catalytic characteristic and inactivation mechanism for the OER at large current densities (> 500 mA cm(-2)) are rarely studied. Here, carbon fiber paper (CFP) possesses three-dimensional (3D) macroporous structure, excellent electrical performance and high stability, which is employed as the substrate material. Homogeneous CoxNi3-xO4, CoxMn3-xO4 and CoxCe3-xO4 nanowire arrays grown on CFP (CoNiO-NWs/CFP, CoMnO-NWs/CFP and CoCeO-NWs/CFP, respectively) are successfully fabricated by using the facile methods of hydrothermal synthesis and thermal decomposition. The CoNiO-NWs/CFP electrode at a current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) achieve high OER stability of approximately 130 h, which is higher than that of clean Co3O4 nanowire array, CoMnO-NWs/CFP and CoCeO-NWs/CFP electrodes. The incorporation of the Ni in the spinel Co3O4 nanowires improves its electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability at large current densities. In contrast, the doping of the Mn and Ce to spinel Co3O4 nanowires has the opposite effect. This research shows that the inactivation mechanism of nanoarray electrodes for the OER of large current densities differs from traditional metal-oxide electrodes.

In this work, the catalytic efficiency of Fe-N-C for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under a small structural perturbation has been comprehensively investigated with density functional theory calculations. The results suggest that the subtle local environment of a single atom can significantly modulate the catalytic reactivity. Further analysis demonstrates that the energy level of the TM d(Z)(2) orbital center, rather than the d-band center, is responsible for the OER catalytic efficiency as the d(Z)(2) orbital participates mainly in the reactions. Essentially, the d-band theory can be extended to the sub-d orbital level, and a small perturbation of the crystal field, induced by lattice strain or Z-direction displacement of the TM atom, can prominently change the sub-d orbital associated with the reaction and in turn affect the catalytic activity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1948-7185			WOS:000818719800001	35735355

The electronic rearrangements, which describe the mechanism of oxetane formation via carbon-oxygen attack (C-O), comprises of the electronic activation of formaldehyde and accumulation of pairing density on the O once the reaction system is approaching the conical intersection point. Our theoretical evidence based on the ELF topology shows that the C-O bond is formed in the ground-state surface (via C-O attack) returning from the S-1 surface accompanied by 1,4-singlet diradical formation. Subsequently, the reaction center is fully activated near the transition state (TS), and the ring-closure (yielding oxetane) involves the C-C bond formation after the TS. For the carbon-carbon attack (C-C), both reactants (formaldehyde and ethylene) are activated, leading to C-C bond formation in the S-1 excited state before reaching the conical intersection region. Finally, the C-O formation occurs in the ground-state surface, resulting from the pair density flowing primarily from the C to O atom.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000700835600001	34549490

In spite of much progress in gas-phase catalysis, applying such catalysts in the field of renewable energy coupled with electrochemistry remains a challenge due to their limited durability in electrolyte. Here, we report a robust and atomically dispersed hybrid catalyst formed in situ on a hematite semiconductor support during photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution by electrostatic adsorption of soluble monomeric [Ir(OH)(6)](2-) coupled to positively charged NiOx sites. The alkali-stable [Ir(OH)(6)](2-) features synergistically enhanced activity toward water oxidation through NiOx that acts as a "movable bridge" of charge transfer from the hematite surface to the single iridium center. This hybrid catalyst sustains high performance and stability in alkaline electrolyte for > 80 h of operation. Our findings provide a promising path for soluble catalysts that are weakly and reversibly bound to semiconductor-supported hole-accumulation inorganic materials under catalytic reaction conditions as hybrid active sites for photoelectrocatalysis.									29	1	0	0	3	0	30			2041-1723			WOS:000414534700005	29116238

In this work, a cubic sodium chloride (NaCl) crystal-templated strategy is proposed for coupling Co9S8 nanoparticles to nitrogen-and sulfur-doped carbon nanosheets (Co9S8/N,S-CNS) by facile pyrolysis. The nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped carbon nanosheets can effectively prevent the aggregation of Co9S8 nanoparticles and greatly improve the conductivity of the hybrid structure. The well-dispersed Co9S8 nanoparticles could provide more active sites. When evaluated as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, an overpotential of 350 mV could yield 10 mA cm(-2) current density for OER and a high onset potential around 0.90 V vs. RHE was obtained with a four-electron pathway for ORR, which is comparable to that of a Pt/C catalyst. The remarkable electrochemical performance can be attributed to the synergistic catalytic effect of Co9S8 nanoparticles and the N,S-doped carbon nanosheets. Considering the simplicity, low cost and scalability of the approach, the strategy presented here can be extendable to the preparation of other nanoparticles/carbon hybrid nanosheets, which may potentially be applied in the fields of high-performance supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, catalysts, sensors, adsorbents and so on.									114	6	0	0	4	0	117			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000409215300025	28809417

It attracts tremendous attention to obtain 2D nanostructures via simple preparation methods. Herein, a facile pyridine-modulated solvothermal synthesis of Ni/Co bimetallic MOF nanoplates (NixCoy-bpy (PyM)) is reported with well-defined 2D morphology with a thickness as thin as 20 nm and an aspect ratio larger than 50.

The development of non-noble-metal-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity, long-term durability, and high OER selectivity is crucial for large-scale seawater electrolysis but remains a significant challenge. Here we develop a three-dimensional core-shell dendritic catalyst by vertically growing NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets on dendritic NiCo branches (denoted as NiCo@NiFe LDH). The dendritic NiCo@NiFe LDH is highly active and stable in alkaline seawater due to its large surface area, fast charge transfer and effective mass transfer, and excellent corrosion resistance. It requires only a small overpotential of 222 mV to achieve current densities of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH seawater. To deliver a large current density of 500 mA cm(-2), the NiC-o@NiFe LDH catalyst requires a record-low overpotential of 266 mV. The nearly 100% OER Faradaic efficiency and the absence of ClO- in the electrolyte following seawater electrolysis indicate the high OER selectivity of our catalyst. The stability of NiCo@NiFe LDH in seawater is proven by its small overpotential fluctuation at a constant current density of 500 mA cm-2 over 100 h.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2542-5293			WOS:000862060100002

Here, we report Ca3GaMn2O8 and SrCa2GaMn2O8, where the ordering of oxygen vacancies leads to cation and polyhedral order, resulting in a remarkable array of electrochemical properties coexisting in the same compound. Neutron and X-ray diffraction have been utilized to study the structure of these materials that feature simultaneous defect order and cation order. Remarkably, both materials show very high electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) of water splitting in bulk form, without the need for composite formation or nanofabrication. The HER overpotential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) is as low as eta(10) approximate to 315 mV. In addition, detailed pseudocapacitive studies show that both compounds are capable of energy storage as anion-based pseudocapacitors, arising from oxygen ion intercalation. The symmetric pseudocapacitor cells fabricated based on these materials show a combination of high energy density and power density. These pseudocapacitor cells are also extremely stable, maintaining their high activity over 1000 cycles of charge-discharge. Electrical charge-transport studies indicate that these compounds have semiconducting properties in a wide temperature range, 25800 degrees C. Magnetic studies using both magnetometry and neutron scattering indicate a transition to an antiferromagnetic state, with a G-type arrangement of spins, where the moment on each Mn is aligned antiparallel to all nearest neighbors. This combination of properties indicates the great potential of this class of defect-ordered systems and their importance to energy research.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2574-0962			WOS:000595488500074

The surface structure and electronic structure of the iron oxide films were investigated by various surface analytical techniques. The results indicate surface structural transformations from metastable FeO(111) and O-terminated Fe2O3(0001) to Fe3O4(111) films, respectively. The former depends strongly on the oxygen pressure and substrate temperature, and the latter relies mostly upon the annealing temperature. Our experimental observations are helpful in understanding the mechanisms of surface structural evolution in iron oxides. The model surfaces of Fe-oxide films, particularly O-terminated surfaces, can be used for further investigation in chemical reactions (e.g., in catalysis).									39	2	0	0	1	0	40			0743-7463			WOS:000285560400003	21141845

Kinetic parameters of the AOE reaction have also been calculated. nhe surface coverage by ferric hydroxo species adsorbed from the electrolyte was shown to exhibit behaviour similar to the Henry adsorption isotherm type reaching, nevertheless, significant values (up to the complete coverage in the limiting case). Its independence from electrode potential (at given concentrations of ferric hydroxo complexes in the electrolyte) throughout the AOE potential region studied (0.50-0.65 V vs Hg/HgO/8 M KOH) has been noted. In situ Mossbauer spectroscopic investigation in the transmission mode on the nhe containing the ferric hydroxide additive on its surface did not reveal any highly oxidized iron states during anodic polarization in the AOE potential region. This does not exclude the possibility of the existence in minor quantities and/or in a scarcely detectable form a highly oxidized iron state (eg in the form of mobile unstable intermediates giving no or negligibly small Mossbauer effect).									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0013-4686			WOS:A1992HG82300005

However, the low efficiency of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) hampers the overall water-splitting catalytic performance. Here, a hybrid catalyst was constructed from N-doped CoS(2)nanoparticles on N,S-co-doped graphene nanosheets (N-CoS2/G) using a facile method, and the catalyst exhibited excellent bifunctional activity. Introduction of N atoms not only promoted the adsorption of reaction intermediates, but also bridged the CoS(2)nanoparticles and graphene to improve electron transfer. Moreover, using thiourea as both N- and S-source ensured synthesis of much smaller-sized nanoparticles with more surface active sites. Surprisingly, the N-CoS2/G exhibited superior catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 260 mV for the OER and 109 mV for the HER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The assembled N-CoS2/G : N-CoS2/G electrolyzer substantially expedited overall water splitting with a voltage requirement of 1.58 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to most reported Co-based bifunctional catalysts and other non-precious-metal catalysts. This work provides a new strategy towards advanced bifunctional catalysts for water electrolysis.									31	1	0	0	2	0	31			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000559439200001	32672900

Therefore, development of highly active and durable non-noble-metal OER catalysts is of great significance to promote their industrialization process. Herein, we electrodeposit amorphous CoSe2 ultrathin nanosheet arrays which exhibit a low overpotential of-0.287 V at 10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope of similar to 62 mV/dec toward the OER in 1 M KOH. This catalytic activity is superior to their crystalline counterpart, commercial RuO2 , and most of the reported Co-based catalysts. It can be mainly attributed to the lowered adsorption free energy of OER intermediates and improved charge transfer ability with a phase transformation from the crystalline state to the amorphous state, besides the intrinsic catalytic activity of CoSe2. When serving as an air cathode in a zinc-air battery, the amorphous CoSe2 also realizes a larger power density and a better long-term cyclability compared with those of crystalline CoSe2 and Pt/C-RuO2 electrodes. This work offers a new underpotential deposition strategy to fabricate high-activity amorphous catalysts and demonstrates its great potential for practical applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Although these effects have long been studied in animal models with perturbed ROS, their actions under physiological conditions are less clear. I propose that some of the apparent uncertainty may be due to confusion of ROS with endogenously generated reactive sulfur species (RSS). ROS and RSS are chemically similar, but RSS are more reactive and versatile, and can be stored and reused. Both ROS and RSS signal via oxidation reactions with protein cysteine sulfur and they produce identical effector responses, but RSS appear to be more effective. RSS in the form of persulfidated cysteines (Cys-S-S) are produced endogenously and co-translationally introduced into proteins, and there is increasing evidence that many cellular proteins are persulfidated. A number of practical factors have contributed to confusion between ROS and RSS, and these are discussed herein. Furthermore, essentially all endogenous antioxidant enzymes appeared shortly after life began, some 3.8 billion years ago, when RSS metabolism dominated evolution. This was long before the rise in ROS, 600 million years ago, and I propose that these same enzymes, with only minor modifications, still effectively metabolize RSS in extant organisms. I am not suggesting that all ROS are RSS; however, I believe that the relative importance of ROS and RSS in biological systems needs further consideration.									25	0	2	0	18	0	27			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000541821000001	32102833

The interaction of the two elements and their contribution to the catalytic activity are of fundamental interest. An iridium-ruthenium oxide catalyst was therefore prepared hydrothermally and characterised by cyclic voltammetry, steady state polarisation measurements, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The catalysts were shown to be solid solutions. Due to significant surface segregation of IrO2 the range of surface compositions was much narrower than the bulk composition-range. The charge-normalised current densities at constant potential for these surface-segregated solid solutions were found to be similar to those obtained at catalysts prepared by physically mixing corresponding ratios of the end-member oxides IrO2 and RuO2. Tafel slopes were in the order of 40 mV dec(-1) for the end members and slightly higher for intermediate compositions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the stability of complicated structures and active sites during a long-term process is also a challenge. Herein, we fabricate a novel approach to create sufficient atomic defects via N-2 plasma treatment onto parallel aligned NiMoO4 nanosheets, followed by refilling of these defects via heterocation dopants and stabilizing them by annealing. The parallel aligned nanosheet arrays with an open structure and quasi-two-dimensional long-range diffusion channels can accelerate the mass transfer at the electrolyte/gas interface, while the incorporation of Fe/Pt atoms into defect sites can modulate the local electronic environment and facilitate the adsorption/reaction kinetics. The optimized Pt-NP-NMC/CC-5 and Fe-NP-NMC/CC-10 electrodes exhibit low overpotentials of 71 and 241 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, and the assembled device reveals a low voltage of 1.55 V for overall water splitting. This plasma-induced high-efficiency defect engineering and coupled active site stabilization strategy can be extended to large-scale fabrication of high-end electrocatalysts.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000695939300018	34432425

Due to the great number of factors affecting the dissolved oxygen, the prediction of the temporal evolution of this element requires the use of mathematical tools. In the case of shallow estuaries with extensive intertidal zones, the complexity of this task increases since the water domain varies continuously. This work describes a numerical model which solves the vertical integrated transport equation including the effect of extensive tidal flats. The model makes use of the tidal velocities computed by a previous run of a hydrodynamic model. This procedure allows the dissolved oxygen modelling to be performed using a larger time step than that used for the velocity field calculation. The numerical scheme developed for the model guarantees that even in the drying and wetting of intertidal areas the water column dissolved oxygen concentration is not modified by numerical errors. The representations of the processes included in the model (advection, dispersion and reaction) have been validated successfully in several theoretical cases. An application to the Urdaibai Estuary, a shallow estuary in the Basque Country, Northern Spain, is also presented.									13	2	1	0	9	0	15			0018-8158			WOS:000178252700017

Existing catalysts often contain a high percentage of noble metals such as Pt and Pd. One important approach to this challenge involves alloying noble metals with other transition metals in the form of a nanoalloy, which promises not only significant reduction of noble metals in the catalyst but also enhanced catalytic activity and stability in comparison with traditional approaches. In this article, some of the recent insights into the structural and electrocatalytic properties of nanoalloy catalysts in which Pt is alloyed with a second and/or third transition metal (M/M' = Co, Fe, V, Ni, Ir, etc.), for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction and ethanol oxidation reaction in fuel cells, and oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in rechargeable lithium-air batteries are highlighted. The correlation of the electrocatalytic properties of nanoalloys in these systems with the atomic-scale chemical/structural ordering in the nanoalloy is an important focal point of the investigations, which has significant implications for the design of low-cost, active, and durable catalysts for sustainable energy production and conversion reactions.									26	0	0	0	0	0	27				2046-2069		WOS:000342199000060

Here, we report an ultrafast (7 ms) synthesis technique for transition metal chalcogenide nanoparticles assisted by high temperature treatment. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that cobalt sulfide (20 nm in diameter)@ few-layer graphene (2 nm in thickness) core-shell nanoparticles embedded in RGO nanosheets exhibit remarkable bifunctional electrocatalytic activity and stability for overall water splitting, which is comparable to commercial 40 wt.% platinum/carbon (Pt/C) electrocatalysts. After 60 h of continuous operation, 10 mA center dot cm(-2) water splitting current density can still be achieved at a low potential of 1.77 V without any activity decay, which is among the most active for non-noble material based electrocatalysts. The presented study provides prospects in synthesizing highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for large-scale energy conversion application via a simple yet efficient technique.									63	11	0	0	3	0	62			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000485041800024

The results show that both SnO2 and SnO2@C are capable of catalyzing oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) at the cathode of Li-air batteries, but the battery with SnO2@C displays better performance due to its unique higher conductivity, larger surface area, complex pore distribution, and huge internal space.									29	1	0	0	0	0	29			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000376825800030	27152996

In particular, the coverage dependence and possible adsorption-induced segregation phenomena are addressed by investigating segregation energies (the difference in calculated total free energy between surface sites and bulk-like sites) of isolated Co in CoNi (111) alloy. In agreement with previous experimental and theoretical investigations, segregation of Co is found to be oxygen-coverage dependent. While for `clean' CoNi (111), Co prefers to be in the bulk. In the presence of more than 2/9 ML of oxygen, Co segregates to the surface. The analysis of oxygen adsorption trends and surface electronic structures explains the change in the local atomic arrangement which is expected to occur on the surface of alloys under reaction conditions. Our predictions for the high oxygen coverage cases are particularly relevant in underlining the importance of segregation phenomena to the hydrogen evolution performance of CoNi alloy hydrogen evolution electrode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0255-5476			INSPEC:16400438

Here, we demonstrate a synthetic route toward carbon-free ternary rock salt oxide (i.e., NiO/CoO/FeO) hollow spheres with silver decoration on the surface for durable operation in bifunctional cells. These Ag-decorated ternary oxides exhibit an overall bifunctional potential gap (Delta E = E-j10(,) (OER) - E-jh(alf,) (ORR)) of 0.89 V. Operando Raman studies show that the rock salt structure shows the phenomenon of a highly reversible local environment during the charge-discharge OER cycles, a key characteristic for high durability in bifunctional devices. At equivalent content between Ni and Co, NiOOH is the main OER-active species with CoOOH and/or CoO2 as the cocatalyst, where the presence of the FeO dopant facilitates structural activation and reversibility. With the proof-of-concept performance in anion-exchange membrane (AEM) devices, the catalysts achieve a durable cyclic operation with a high current density (1000 mA cm(-2)) at smaller potentials (2.03 V) than RuO2 (2.16 V) under the electrolyzer mode, while it can yield two times greater power density (96.98 mW cm(-2)) than Pt/C (S3.58 mW cm(-2)) in the fuel cell mode.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2574-0962			WOS:000644737800049

Studies found that the synegistic effect of trimetals and the introduction of P heteroatoms contributed to the optimization of porous morphology, amorphous properties and tuned electronic configuration of CoCuMo-P, which increased the number of exposed active sites and accelerated the mass/electron transfer rate, thereby enhancing the OER electrocatalytic activity of CoCuMo-P. In addition, the in situ formed (oxy)hydroxides and oxides of CoCuMo generated more defective sites and adsorbed OH in the alkaline electrolyte, which further helped to improve the OER catalytic performance of CoCuMo-P. When the applied current density was 10 mA.cm(-2), the overpotential obtained on CoCuMo-P lowered to 309 mV and the Tafel slope as low as 76 mV.dec(-1). A 25 h durabilitly was also obtained. The seldomly reported amphorous and porous Cu-containing phosphide enriched the scope of OER electrocatalyst and the underlying reasons for the enhanced OER activity of CoCuMo-P was revealed, which further provided references for the design of novel electrocatalysts.

Iron phosphide (FeP) was highlighted for an attractive Pt substitute benefitting from the richness and cheapness. Encapsulating FeP by doped carbon can endow the metal phase improved conductivity, durability and particularly enhanced catalytic activity by bilateral electronic coupling. Herein, by a facile one-pot strategy, natural DNA was first explored to prepare FeP embedded N, P-codoped carbon (NPC) composite with large surface areas, high graphitization and abundant high-quality dopants simultaneously. Strikingly, the long-chain DNA macromolecule confines the grown the of FeP to deliver the ultrafine but high crystalline nanoparticles. Thus, the newly-obtained FeP/NPC displays superior alkaline ORR performance comparable to Pt/C together with excellent alkaline HER activity. Density function theory computations reveal the interfacial electron transfer between FeP and NPC induces the optimal adsorption/desorption energies of key reaction intermediates on C sites adjacent to N for ORR and P sites of carbon for HER. The as-fabricated rechargeable zinc-air battery based on current FeP/NPC has large specific capacity and energy density with excellent charge-discharge stability, outperforming most of recently reported Fe-based counterparts.

Herein, a precise and inexpensive laser-induced annealing (LIA) strategy, which eliminates particle aggregation and rapidly generates uniform structures with a high exposure of active sites, is introduced to carbonize MOFs on conductive substrates under ambient conditions within a few minutes. By systematically considering 8 substrates and 12 MOFs, a series of LIA-MOF/substrate devices with controllable sizes and good flexibility are successfully obtained. These LIA-MOF/substrate devices can directly serve as working electrodes. Remarkably, LIA-MIL-101(Fe) on nickel foam exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 225 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability over 50 h for facilitating the oxygen evolution reaction, outperforming most recently reported transition-metal-based electrocatalysts and commercial RuO2. Physical characterizations and theoretical calculations evidence that the high activity of LIA-MIL-101(Fe) arises from the favorable adsorption of intermediates at its Ni-doped Fe3O4 overlayer that is formed during the laser treatment. Moreover, the LIA-MOF/substrate devices are assembled for overall water splitting. The proposed LIA strategy demonstrates a cost-effective route for manufacturing scalable energy storage and conversion devices.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000655786200001

By modelling, numerical fitting, and validation procedure, equivalent circuits in particular ranges of potentials were established. The values of elements of these were determined and their potential dependence analysed. Results of both the experimental and modelling procedures show that: (i) at passive potentials, between +0.50 and +0.70 V, the electrode impedance exhibits pure capacitative behaviour due to the non-separable film, and Helmholtz double-layer capacitance, with a low ion transfer anodic current density, i(a); (ii) at E greater than or equal to +0.75 V, the pure capacitance model is complemented by surface (adsorbed) state impedance; (iii) at potentials between +0.95 and + 1.05 V the impedance data and a steep increase in i(a) point towards two-step kinetics of the OER, in which surface (adsorbed) states mediate electron transfer. Comparison of impedance data for Fe80B20 with those obtained for Fe indicates a lower rate constant for the formation of surface (adsorbed) states, a different control step and a lower electrocatalytic efficiency for the OER on Fe80B20.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0013-4686			WOS:A1994MP17200017

Since the 2000s, there has been a rapid rise in the use of first-row transition metal (hydr)oxides for the OER. However, there is still a need to design and synthesize an efficient and stable catalyst for the OER. The present paper aims to design and synthesize an OER catalyst based on "a look at nature" strategy. In a simple and chemical evolution-like experiment, for the first time, a solution composed of various perchlorate cations, namely, Li(I), Mg(II), Ca(II), Al(III), Mn(II), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), Ba(II), and Na2SiO3, at a concentration of 1.0 mM at pH=4 and a potential of 1.40 V vs. NHE, which was under stirring for 15 days, was investigated. The stable OER catalyst on the electrode was characterized by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Based on the extrapolation of the Tafel plot, the onset of the OER in the presence of this catalyst was 130 mV lower than a bare electrode without it. This approach could be a roadmap to design and synthesize new and stable catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000728757600031

The majority of the state-of-the-art anode catalysts have been tested in half-cells; however, it is highly desirable to design an anode catalyst that can be effectively employed in a real electrolyzer. Herein, a new structural design strategy is proposed as an effective pathway for constructing efficient and stable PEMWE anodes. The developed self-standing electrode with hierarchical structure comprises porous and defective RuO2 nanosheets aligned on carbon fiber (RuO2-NS/CF) with several structural advantages, including large electrochemically active surface area, abundant defects, and exposed atoms/edges, and enhanced mass transfer capacity. Therefore, RuO2-NS/CF exhibits outstanding performance and durability for oxygen evolution reaction in acidic condition, and its mass activity is 60 times greater than that of commercial RuO2 at an overpotential of 300 mV. Furthermore, the RuO2-NS/CF anode produces 2.827 A cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.7 V-cell during a single cell test, which considerably exceeds other reported catalysts. This work illustrates the significance of catalyst layer structure in electrocatalysis and sheds new light on the structural engineering of advanced catalysts.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000703998700002

Our simulations show that local distortions in graphene induced by bond formation with adatoms indirectly lead to a "symbiotic" behavior of co-adsorbed oxygen atoms. Namely, the adatoms tend to mutually stabilize the adsorption and possibly migrate on graphene in groups of some small number of atoms.

This is especially true for N-doped nanocarbons used in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and supercapacitors. Here, we report a low-cost, environmentally friendly, large-scale mechanochemical method of preparing N-doped porous carbons (NPCs) with hierarchical micro-mesopores and a large surface area via ball-milling polymerization followed by pyrolysis. The optimized NPC prepared at 1000 degrees C (NPC-1000) offers excellent ORR activity with an onset potential (E-onset) and half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.9 and 0.82 V, respectively (vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode), which are only approximately 30 mV lower than that of Pt/C. The rechargeable Zn-air battery assembled using NPC-1000 and the NiFe-layered double hydroxide as bifunctional ORR and oxygen evolution reaction electrodes offered superior cycling stability and comparable discharge performance to RuO2 and Pt/C. Moreover, the supercapacitor electrode equipped with NPC prepared at 800 degrees C exhibited a high specific capacity (431 F g(-1) at 10 mV s(-1)), outstanding rate, performance, and excellent cycling stability in an aqueous 6-M KOH solution. This work demonstrates the potential of the mechanochemical preparation method of porous carbons, which are important for energy conversion and storage.									53	5	0	0	4	0	53			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000510847700006	34138057

Here, a partial sulfidation route to construct Ni2Fe-LDH/FeNi2S4 heterostructure on nickel foam (Ni2Fe-LDH/FeNi2S4/NF) by adjusting the hydrothermal duration is reported. The heterostructures afford abundant hydroxide/sulfide interfaces that offer plentiful active sites, rapid charge and mass transfer, favorable adsorption energy to oxygenated species (OH- and OOH) evidenced by the density functional theory calculations, which synergistically boost the alkaline water oxidation. In the 1.0 m KOH solution, Ni2Fe-LDH/FeNi2S4/NF exhibits an excellent OER catalytic activity with a much smaller overpotential (240 mV) to reach the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) than single-phase Ni2Fe-LDH/NF (279 mV) or FeNi2S4/NF (271 mV). More impressively, 2000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry scan for water oxidation results in the formation of a sulfate layer over the catalyst. The corresponding post-catalyst demonstrates better OER activity and durability than the initial one in the alkaline simulated seawater electrolyte. The post-Ni2Fe-LDH/FeNi2S4/NF delivers smaller overpotential (250 mV) at 100 mA cm(-2) and longer stability time than the original form (260 mV). The post-formed sulfate passivating layer is responsible for the outstanding corrosion resistance of the salty-water oxidation anode since it can effectively repel chloride.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000787731900001

Nevertheless, the scalable and effective preparation of 2D materials constructed hierarchical structures, such as unique 2D/1D structure, is rarely achieved. Herein, we report a facile alkali-soaking strategy for the preparation of 2D transition metal hydroxide/oxide nanosheets-assembled hierarchical structures, in which the rational designed bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are annealed followed by a simple alkali soaking. Our method is capable of preparing various hierarchical structures based on 2D materials, including Co(OH)(2), Ni(OH)(2), and Mn3O4 nanosheets. Moreover, a high yield of similar to 2.2 g was achieved for a batch of Co(OH)(2) nanosheet-assembled structure. Impressively, the as-synthesized Co(OH)(2) hierarchical structure shows excellent electrocatalytic performances toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 267 mV with a small Tafel slope of 62.0 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, it delivers a small charging/discharging voltage gap of 1.2 V at 75 mA cm(-2) and high stability for over 240 h, when used as an air cathode for rechargeable Zn-air batteries.									22	1	0	0	0	0	23			2574-0962			WOS:000458706900071

However, the constraint of MoS2 lies on the inactive basal planes, and the catalytic activity is limited to the active edge sites only. In this work, we are incorporating different defects into the multilayered MoS2 nanoflakes by the nonthermal oxygen (O-2) plasma technique to improve its catalytic activity. A mild O-2 plasma technique has been used to introduce different concentrations of dopants to improve the HER of 2D-MoS2 and to enhance the electron mobility of MoS2 nanosheets for fast electron transfer. Oxygen has been incorporated in MoS2 nanosheets which formed the nanocomposite material MoS2-xOx with sulfur-vacancies by controlled oxygen (O) plasma exposure. The best performance is obtained after irradiation of 30 s of O-2 plasma with an overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). By employing density functional theory (DFT), it has also been shown that optimized insertion of oxygen in MoS2 can influence the electron density of states, leading to the faster charge transfer and consequent increase in catalytic activity. Our experimental (XRD, XPS, TEM) and theoretical (DFT) calculations show that O-doped 2D-MoS2 with S-edge termination exhibits superior activity and stability for the HER activity with low overpotential due to the fast electron transfer. The synergism between the optimal defect concentration along with the enhanced electron mobility increases the electrochemical activities in an acidic medium.									11	1	0	0	2	0	11			2574-0962			WOS:000543715100029

Herein, amorphous bimetallic selenide (Ni-Fe-Se) hollow nanospheres electrodeposited on nickel foam (Ni-Fe-Se/NF) are developed as a bifunctional catalyst for the HER and OER. The HER and OER bifunctional activity of Ni-Fe-Se/NF outperforms those of monometallic Ni-Se/NF and Fe-Se/NF owing to the synergy of Ni and Fe in Ni-Fe-Se/NF. Moreover, the amorphous hollow spherical morphology of Ni-Fe-Se/NF increases the active site density and facilitates the mass transfer of electrolytes and H-2/O-2 products. Ni-Fe-Se/NF drives a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of similar to 85 mV for the HER and 100 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of similar to 222 mV for the OER. As the HER and OER bifunctional catalyst, Ni-Fe-Se/NF can split alkaline water with total voltages of similar to 1.52 V and similar to 1.66 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, and remain stable over 50 hours of operation in 1 M KOH.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000537869500026	32374312

In this study, a water soluble Robson-type macrocyclic dicopper(II) complex has been used for the first time as a catalyst precursor for the generation of a copper-based bifunctional heterogeneous catalyst film, which can be used for both HER and OER at a near neutral pH. In sodium borate buffer at pH 9.20, this complex decomposed to give a Cu(OH)(2)/Cu2O-based thin film on FTO that catalyzes both hydrogen production and water oxidation. The morphology, nature and composition of the thin film were fully characterized by scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopies. The catalyst film showed high stability during the course of electrolysis in either the cathodic or the anodic direction for more than 4 h. Faradaic efficiencies of similar to 92% for HER and similar to 96% for OER were achieved. The switch between the two half-reactions of catalytic water splitting was fully reversible in nature.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000408690500026	28671221

MnO2 is a promising candidate material for this purpose. However, it dissolves at high overpotentials. Using first-principles calculations, a strategy to mitigate this problem by decorating undercoordinated surface sites of MnO2 with a stable oxide is developed here. TiO2 stands out as the most promising of the different oxides in the simulations. This prediction is experimentally verified by testing sputter-deposited thin films of MnO2 and Ti-MnO2. A combination of electrochemical measurements, quartz crystal microbalance, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry measurements, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is performed. Small amounts of TiO2 incorporated into MnO2 lead to a moderate improvement in stability, with only a small decrease in activity. This study opens up the possibility of engineering surface properties of catalysts so that active and abundant nonprecious metal oxides can be used in acid electrolytes.									135	3	0	0	13	0	136			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000365271000006

Electrochemical synthesis technology provides a feasible route for the preparation of independent OER electrodes with high utilization of active sites, fast mass transfer, and a simple preparation process. A comprehensive review of the electrochemical synthesis of nano/microstructure transition metal-based OER materials is provided. First, some fundamentals of electrochemical synthesis are introduced, including electrochemical synthesis strategies, electrochemical synthesis substrates, the electrolyte used in electrochemical synthesis, and the combination of electrochemical synthesis and other synthesis methods. Second, the morphology and properties of electrochemical synthetic materials are summarized and introduced from the viewpoint of structural design. Then, the latest progress regarding the development of transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts is reviewed, including the classification of metals/alloys, oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, phosphides, selenides, and other transition metal compounds. In addition, the oxygen evolution mechanism and rate-determining steps of transition metal-based catalysts are also discussed. Finally, the advantages, challenges, and opportunities regarding the application of electrochemical techniques in the synthesis of transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts are summarized. This review can provide inspiration for researchers and promote the development of water splitting technology.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000789325600001	35485940

Crystal phase control is vital for tailoring their ORR performances. Herein, hexagonal (h-FeSe) and tetragonal FeSe (t-FeSe) ultrafine nanocrystals are jointly encapsulated in a N-doped carbon matrix without agglomeration. Their phase evolution at different pyrolysis temperatures is explicitly elucidated. The resultant material that contains the highest amount of h-FeSe nanocrystals exhibits remarkable performances with a positive onset potential of 0.97 V, large limiting current density of 5.4 mA cm(-2) and low H2O2 yield of 6.6%. The material also delivers outstanding catalytic stability and methanol crossover tolerance. Theoretical studies confirm that h-FeSe outperforms t-FeSe in O-2 adsorption and O-O bond dissociation of *OOH intermediates on active Fe-sites. Thus, h-FeSe is more efficient than t-FeSe towards alkaline ORR. We believe it will provide great inspiration for designing other ORR-efficient transition metal-based electrocatalysts by controlling crystal phases.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000618794400024

The experiments were performed behind reflected shock waves at temperatures of 1270-1820 K and a pressure of similar to 1 bar. The time evolution of the luminescence intensity of the electronically excited C-2*, CH*, and OH* radicals and CO2* molecule was monitored photometrically. The measured temperature dependence of the ignition delay time was found to be in satisfactory agreement with the published data and the results of simulations within the framework of the ChemphysMech_v.1 (Tereza et al., 2010) and AramcoMech_1.3_C-4 (Metcalfe et al., 2013) reaction mechanisms. The possible reaction pathways of formation of C-2*, CH*, OH*, and CO2* were analyzed. It was shown for the first time that, along with the recombination reaction CO + O CO2*, CO2* is formed by the reaction CH + O-2 CO2* + H, which dominates during fuel burnout, whereas the former becomes the main channel of CO2* formation at later stages. The contribution from the reaction C2H + O-2 was demonstrated to play a minor role in the formation of CH* as compared to the C2H + O reaction, at least under the conditions tested.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000395194900006

Doping heteroatom into catalysts is regarded as an effective strategy to regulate electronic configuration and improve the catalytic performance of water oxidation. In this work, N-doped CoS2 on carbon cloth is fabricated by one-step synthesis, in which thiourea acts as both sulfur and nitrogen sources. The N-doped cobalt disulfide shows superior catalytic activity for oxygen evolution, with a low over potential of 240 mV for 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope (56 mV dec(-1)) and high turnover frequency due to the modification with electronic structure after incorporation of N atom. Moreover, the incorporation of N atom provides a distinctive perspective of doping other heteroatom into the material for modifying the electrochemical properties.

Here cobalt nano chains are prepared by. a direct-current (DC) arc-discharge method under the gaseous mixture of He and H-2. The Co nanochains can range up to several micrometers. When H-2 is replaced by CO2, the sample shows a phase evolution from Co nanochains to CoO nanocubes. The ratio of CoO/Co can be effortlessly altered by varying the partial pressure of CO2 in the reaction gas mixture. CoO nanocubes are attained in the pure CO2. The prepared samples are explored as catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The catalytic activity is highly dependent on the phase proportion of Co and CoO. The sample prepared under CO2:He = 1:7 unveils the optimal OER performance with an onset point of 1.50 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The high OER performance can be attributed to synergistic effect and charge transfer process between Co and CoO. Co can inject electrons into CoO, which manipulates the work function of CoO to make it more suitable for oxygen evolution. The good OER performance can also be ascribed to the defective structure of CoO. The CoO/Co composite shows good robustness with less than 8% current loss throughout the long-term test.									83	7	0	0	3	0	85			2380-8195			WOS:000401500200039

It was confirmed that in oxidation reactions of more complex mechanism than simple electron transfer, these electrodes are active only at potentials of simultaneous oxygen evolution. At IrO2 electrodes, the reaction is mediated by chemisorbed oxygen, probably forming IrO3-type active sites, and yields highly selective oxidation products at low overpotentials and with moderate current efficiency. At diamond electrodes, mediation at high overpotentials is due to physisorbed . OH radicals leading to complete combustion of the organic compound with high current efficiency.

In this work, we report nickel foam (NF) supported low-crystalline NiCoFe nanosheet array electrocatalysts derived from NiCo layered double hydroxide via spontaneous cation exchange reaction. Driven by the redox properties of NiCo layered double hydroxide and iron salt precursors, the entire cation exchange reaction process is completed without extra energy input. The chemical composition and catalytic properties of the as-prepared NiCoFe/NF catalysts are strongly dependent on the valence state of the Fe cation in the iron salt precursors. The NiCoFe/NF-FeSO4 catalyst with FeSO4 as the iron salt precursor exhibits satisfactory OER activity with a much lower overpotential of 293 mV to reach a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) as compared with NiCoFe/NF-Fe-2(SO4)(3) (eta(100) = 333 mV), NiCo/NF (eta(100) = 425 mV) and commercial RuO2 (eta(100) = 399 mV) catalysts. Moreover, NiCoFe/NF-FeSO4 also exhibits impressive long-term durability for the OER. The current density remains nearly unchanged during the 95 h of continuous OER test, demonstrating a promising application in actual industrial water electrolysis. These findings indicate that the iron ion valence states in the iron salt precursors have a significant impact on the composition of the catalysts and thus affect their catalytic performances. This work is instructive for the rational design and preparation of highly efficient Earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2052-1553			WOS:000616372900015

The GO-Cu2+ hybrid materials were characterized by cyclic voltammetry in sodium acetate buffer solution. The morphology of the hybrid GO-Cu2+ was characterized by atomic force microscopy. The GO-Cu2+ hybrid electrodes show good electrocatalytic activity for HER with low overpotential in acidic solution. The Tafel slope for the GO-Cu2+ hybrid electrode implies that the primary discharge step is the rate determining step and HER proceed with Volmer step.

Herein, we synthesized the ternary pyrite-type boron sulfide in situ coated by amorphous FeCoNiBx as an efficient and durable heterogeneous catalyst for OER. The spherical aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy clearly shows that the adjacent crystals exhibit different phases with an approximately 2 nm amorphous layer on the external surface of the catalysts. This hybrid catalyst exhibits the superior OER activity with an attractive overpotential of 419.4 mV vs. RHE at 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution and excellent stability over 10 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the B atoms can attract the electrons from metals, resulting in the expansion of the unoccupied d orbitals of metals, which is beneficial to attract the electrons from OH- groups, thus improving the OER performance of the catalyst combined with its special heterostructure. This study provides an advantageous method for engineering the electrical structure of pyrite-type sulfides for high OER activity and long durability.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000651135600001

In this work, free-standing Ni/Ni-M (M = Fe, Co, Mo) bimetallic oxides core/shell nanorod arrays (Ni/Ni-M NRAs) were prepared through electroless deposition of transition metal species on black nickel sheet (nickel nanorod arrays (Ni NRAs)) followed by electrochemical oxidation. All three types of Ni/NiM NRAs demonstrated enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reactions (OER). Especially, Ni/Ni-Fe NRAs electrode exhibit small onset potential of 1.535 V at current density of 10 mA.cm(-2). In contrast, the OER durability of these three samples was distinct. At 500 mV constant overpotential, the current density loss in OER of Ni/Ni-Fe NRAs was merely 13.5% for a period of 20000 s; but Ni/Ni-Mo and Ni/Ni-Co NRAs had almost disappeared catalytic activity under the identical conditions. According to many reports, the results were different for the superior OER stability of Ni-based bimetallic catalysts. Electrochemical analysis revealed that the NRAs structure dramatically improves charge transfer efficiency and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The present study might provide a new insight to design and fabricate more practical and high-performance Ni-based electrodes for OER. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, a new 2D layered Co-MOF was synthesized as the precursor for fabricating Napoleon-like Co3O4 (NL-Co3O4). The monolayer thickness of NL-Co3O4 is approximately 70 nm. The unique structure of layered porous of NL-Co3O4 derived from Co-MOF plays an important role in improving electrochemical and electro-catalysis properties. As lithium ion battery anode material, NL-Co3O4 shows out-bound cycling performance and rate capacity, which has an unprecedented high reversible capacity of 1120.5 mA h g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) after 300 cycles and high rate capacities of 579.4 mA h g(-1) under the current density of 6.4 A g(-1). NL-Co3O4 still exhibits capacity of 679 and 576 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at high current densities of 1 and 4 A g(-1), respectively. Moreover, NL-Co3O4 has efficient oxygen evolution reduction (OER) catalytic performance (overpotential, ca. 420 mV), comparable with commercial RuO2. During the process of continuous catalysis of OER, NL-Co3O4 shows good durability for about 15 h.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2199-692X			WOS:000583996400001

Compared with IrO2, universally accepted as the current state-of-the-art OER catalyst, Ca2IrO4 showed an excellent OER catalytic activity in an acidic environment, whereas CaIrO3 did not. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra showed that the oxidation of iridium in Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3 was slightly beyond + 4. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra illustrated that the IrO6 octahedral geometric structure in Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3 showed differences. The IrO6 octahedral is asymmetrically distorted and uniformly compressed in Ca2IrO4 and CaIrO3. Therefore, we propose that the IrO6 octahedral distortion plays an important role in the OER activities.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			2470-1343			WOS:000427939400048	31458561

An understanding of the chemical and electronic state of hydrogen adsorbed on the electrocatalyst surface is crucial because hydrogen-substrate interaction determines oxygen reduction efficiency. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) has shown to be a highly efficient technique for interface characterization and kinetic parameter determination for different reactions carried out on interfaces. In this work, the application of EIS for characterizing electrodes under HER by implementing a rotating disc electrode with different Pt/C loadings and different potentials in acidic solutions was carried out. By adjusting an electric circuit to experimentally collected data, the parameters of charge transference (R-ct, C-dl) and proton adsorption on the cathode surface (R-p, C-p) were determined. A statistical analysis of the parameters showed that the only significant differences were between R-inf and R, when they were evaluated at different catalysts loads. This statistical analysis allowed us to establish a tendency between the data and a polynomial which describes its behavior.					7th Congress of the Mexican-Hydrogen-Society/3rd Conference of the Iberoamerican-Network-for-Fuel-Cells-and-Hydrogen7th Congress of the Mexican-Hydrogen-Society/3rd Conference of the Iberoamerican-Network-for-Fuel-Cells-and-Hydrogen	SEP 26-28, 2007SEP 26-28, 2007	Mexican Soc Hydrogen; Iberoamer Network Fuel Cells & HydeogenMexican Soc Hydrogen; Iberoamer Network Fuel Cells & Hydeogen	Chihuahua, MEXICOChihuahua, MEXICO	7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1480-2422			WOS:000256740700012

Water electrolysis is useful for producing ultrapure hydrogen (>99.9%), and alkaline water electrolysis is industrially adopted for large-scale hydrogen production. However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains as the bottleneck for achieving efficient hydrogen generation because of its multielectron pathways and sluggish kinetics. Additionally, the OER is crucial for other renewable energy conversion and storage systems, such as CO2 reduction and metal-air batteries. In this regard, high-performing, durable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts are essential for achieving the desired hydrogen production efficiency. Recently, transition metal carbonate hydroxides (TMCHs) have been investigated as electrocatalysts for alkaline water splitting because of their layered structure, rich redox properties, and high accessibility to electrolytes. Furthermore, the electronic, morphological, and structural modulations in mixed TMCHs, due to the presence of multiple metal centers, offer more accessible active sites for the OER. Considering these aspects, the present review focuses on the application of mixed transition metal carbonate hydroxide (MTMCH)-based nanostructured electrocatalysts to OER in alkaline media. This review will benefit the understanding and evaluation of OER activity and the development of MTMCH-based electrocatalysts for practical application to the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2699-9412			WOS:000819968100001

Water electrolysis in conjunction with renewable electricity (from wind, photovoltaics, tides, etc.) can provide a zero emission source of hydrogen. However, water electrolysis is severely hampered by its slow kinetics, especially that of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the cathode. Recently, an alternative strategy for water splitting, the chemical-assisted hydrogen electrocatalytic evolution reaction (CAHER), has been developed and shows promising activity. This strategy enables the substitution of a relatively facile chemical oxidation reaction (COR) for the sluggish cathodic OER. The COR is not only kinetically faster, but also can produce high value products. Efforts have been made to identify suitable chemicals and correspondingly efficient catalysts. Understanding the mechanisms of CAHER is highly beneficial for system design, chemical selection and catalyst optimization. Therefore, the most recent progress in CAHER is introduced in this mini-review from the aspects of basic principles, the diverse auxiliary reductive chemicals and the development of electrocatalysts. Possible mechanisms for the hydrogen evolution at the cathode and oxidation/degradation of chemicals at the anode are proposed to elucidate the CAHER process. Finally, promising strategies for improving CAHER performance with regard to future developments are outlined.									61	3	0	0	2	0	61			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000439283200003

Noble metallic Pt is usually used as a co-catalyst to catalyze this reaction. However, Pt can also act as an active center for H-2 and O-2 recombination reverse reaction, which results in the low photocatalytic efficiency for H-2 generation. Herein, the H-2 and O-2 recombination can remarkably be inhibited by incorporating amide-functionalized groups onto graphene surface and edge, which act as the oxygen adsorbent site and reduce migration of O-2 molecules in the dye-sensitized PHE system. Theoretical studies verify that the adsorption energy of oxygen change remarkable due to orbital hybridization by N 2p in amide group with O 2p in O-2 molecule, leading to redistribution the electron structure of graphene, and change of electrical properties of sensitized matrix. By amide-functionalized graphene (AF-RGO), we achieved high H-2 evolution activity over AF-RGO/Pt nanohybrid catalyst under visible light irradiation. The quantum efficiency of AF-RGO/Pt (AF-RGO prepared at 140 degrees C) achieved 36.4% at 430 nm. This superior photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the repression of H-2 and O-2 recombination and the synergy of electrical properties. This work is helpful to design high active catalyst for solar hydrogen generation.									13	2	0	0	1	0	14			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000434004300041

In this work, single crystalline, nanoporous nickel oxide (NiO) was prepared using a hydro thermal, soft-templated synthesis route followed by calcination at different temperatures. It is shown that the NiO crystals have a cubic lattice, and the pore size can be tuned from similar to 1 to similar to 70 nm by varying the calcination temperature, i.e. variation from micro to macroporosity. The NiO's catalytic performance as electrocatalysts was evaluated in OER, both thermodynamically and kinetically. Mesoporous NiO with calcination temperature of 400 degrees C had the lowest overpotential (335 mV) required @ 10 mA/cm(2) accompanied with the highest turnover frequency value and mass activity among of the obtained NiO electrocatalysts. The study shows that the electrocatalytic activity of nanoporous NiO outperforms that of commercial catalyst Ir/C (similar to 360 mV @ 10 mA/cm(2)). Microporous NiO possess the highest specific surface area and electrical double layer capacitance, while the nonporous NiO particles have the highest specific activity and BET activity of the catalysts. It is concluded that the minimization of voltage losses by the nanoscale enlargement of the electrocatalyst surface area shows the coherence between gas adsorption and electrocapacitive measurements. Conversely, the OER kinetics showed deterioration with surface area maximization due to the impediment of ionic transport inside the micropores. This work demonstrates the importance of morphology optimization to obtain an efficient OER electrocatalyst with low required overpotential and kinetic loss.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1387-1811	1873-3093		WOS:000761774400001

The as-constructed catalyst shows the stable CoN3C1-TeN1C3 coordination structure before and after HER and ORR. The *OOH/*H intermediate species are captured by in situ Raman and in situ attenuated total reflectance-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, indicating that the reactant O-2/H2O molecule has a strong interaction with the Co site, revealing that Co delta+ is an effective active site. Theoretical calculations show that the Co delta+ has adsorption-activation function and the neighboring Te delta+ acts as an electron donor adjusting the electronic structure of Co delta+, promoting the dissociation of H2O molecules and the adsorption of H and oxygen-containing intermediates in HER and ORR. In the meanwhile, the nearest C atom around Co also profoundly affects the adsorption of H atoms. This results in the weakening of the OH adsorption and enhancement of H adsorption, as well as the more stable water molecule dissociation transition state, thus significantly boosting ORR and HER performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000806005600001	35666000

The C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction is particularly important for the study of low- and intermediate-mass stars as it determines the final C/O ratio in the core which influences the white dwarf (WD) cooling evolution. Thus, there is a need for a study of how the computations of WDs and their progenitors that are made to date may be affected by the uncertainties of the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction rates. In this work, we compute fully evolutionary sequences using the mesa code with initial masses in the range of 0.90 <= M-i/M-circle dot <= 3.05. We consider different adopted reaction rates, obtained from the literature, as well as the extreme limits within their uncertainties. As expected, we find that previous to the core helium burning (CHB) stage, there are no changes to the evolution of the stars. However, the subsequent stages are all affected by the uncertainties of the considered reaction rate. In particular, we find differences to the convective core mass during the CHB stage which may affect pulsation properties of subdwarfs, the number of thermal pulses during the asymptotic giant branch and trends between final oxygen abundance in the core and the progenitor masses of the remnant WDs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000790961400003

In this paper, we design a series of C6H4NO2/g-C3N4 composites by combining a polar nitrobenzene molecule with g-C3N4 monolayer using density functional theory calculations. The electrocatalytic performances during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are substantially improved thanks to the electron redistributions of g-C3N4 substrate. One composite specimen exhibits the lowest bi-directional OER/ORR overpotentials of 0.14/0.14 V, and the most stable composite specimen has OER/ORR overpotentials of 0.27/0.39 V. The number of active electrons in active atom, as descriptor of catalytic activity, can accurately estimate the OER and ORR activity of metal-free electrocatalysts. The modification strategy would be extended to design high-efficiency metal-free electrocatalysts. [All rights reserved Elsevier].									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332			INSPEC:20019501

A Bonding Evolution Theory Analysis								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A				118	31			6092	6103		10.1021/jp504172g				AUG 7 2014	2014	In this research, a comprehensive theoretical investigation has been conducted on oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reactions from Mimoun complexes to sulfides and sulfoxides. The joint use of the electron localization function (ELF) and Thom's catastrophe theory (CT) provides a powerful tool to analyze the evolution of chemical events along a reaction pathway. The progress of the reaction has been monitored by structural stability domains from ELF topology while the changes between them are controlled by turning points derived from CT which reveal that the reaction mechanism can be separated in several steps: first, a rupture of the peroxo O-1-O-2 bond, then a rearrangement of lone pairs of the sulfur atom occurs and subsequently the formation of S-O-1 bond. The OAT process involving the oxidation of sulfides and sulfoxides is found to be an asynchronous process where O-1-O-2 bond breaking and S-O-1 bond formation processes do not occur simultaneously. Nudeophilic/electrophilic characters of both dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl sulfoxide, respectively, are sufficiently described by our results, which hold the key to unprecedented insight into the mapping of electrons that compose the bonds while the bonds change.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000340222500040	25010751

While the general interest in developing non-toxic, high-performance, and economically feasible catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is noteworthy, there is also significant interest in water splitting research. Recently, perovskite-type oxides have performed as an alternative to non-precious metal catalysts and can act as a new class of effective catalysts in water splitting systems. Herein, a perovskite-structured FeTiO3 was prepared via a facile one-step solvothermal method using ionic liquid as templates. The results of structural and morphological studies have supported the formation of FeTiO3 perovskite. Furthermore, FeTiO3 perovskite demonstrated OER activity with a lower onset potential of 1.45 V vs. RHE and Tafel slope value of 0.133 V.dec(-1) at 1 M KOH solution using mercury/mercurous oxide (Hg/HgO) were used as working electrodes.									6	0	0	0	0	0	5				2073-4344		WOS:000699098900001

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode of electrolysis is the key factor affecting the reaction efficiency, which involves the transfer of four electrons and can slow down the overall reaction process. In this work, using nickel foam coated with MXene (Ti3C2Tx) as the carrier, a three-dimensional flower-shaped layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) is grown on Ti3C2Tx by a hydrothermal method to fabricate a NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2Tx/NF hybrid electrocatalyst for enhanced OER performance. The results reveal that the hybrid electrocatalyst has excellent OER activity in alkaline solution, in which a low overpotential of 223 mV and a small Tafel slope of 47.2 mV dec(-1) can be achieved at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). The interface interaction and charge transfer between Ti3C2Tx and NiCo-LDH can accelerate the electron transfer rate during the redox process and improve the catalytic activity of the overall reaction. This NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2Tx/NF hybrid electrocatalyst may have important research significance and great application potential in catalytic electrolysis of water.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2046-2069		WOS:000634931200061	35423758

The phase transitions and morphology evolutions of the samples obtained at different temperatures after reacting for different time were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that molybdenite concentrate was oxidized directly to MoO3 in pure oxygen atmosphere. There were remarkable changes of the morphologies of products with the increase of the roasting temperature. It was also found that sintering phenomenon occurred during the roasting process in pure oxygen when the temperature was above 873 K. The composition of sintered sample was mainly comprised of MoO3 and some unreacted MoS2.									44	11	1	0	0	0	49			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000368066200037

In the research reported herein, the oxygen-transfer mechanism of CuFe2O4 prepared through the sol gel method combined with combustion synthesis, along with the characteristics of its reaction with a typical coal of high sulfur and high ash contents (abbreviated as LZ), were systematically investigated at different final reaction temperatures, with the research focused on the effect of reaction temperature. H-2-temperature-programmed reduction of CuFe2O4 indicated that the first reduction of the Cu2+ ion in CuFe2O4 was advantageous in the later transmission of atomic oxygen from the Fe3+ reduction, while temperature programmed decomposition of CuFe2O4 under a N-2 atmosphere validated the potential of CuFe2O4 to emit O-2 through its direct decomposition. Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed better reaction performance between CuFe2O4 and LZ coal than other ferrite oxygen carrier (OC) candidates, such as MnFe2O4, NiFe2O4, and CoFe2O4, which we studied previously. Comprehensive characterization of the solid products from reaction of CuFe2O4 with LZ coal by field emission scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that CuFe2O4 was mainly reduced to Cu and Fe3O4. At the same time, some oxygen-deficient CuFe2O4 was also formed through disintegration of the original CuFe2O4 spinel with more Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions occupying the octahedral sites, which benefited the transmission of the atomic oxygen involved in the CuFe2O4. Finally, XPS analysis of the LZ coal residue after its reaction with CuFe2O4 indicated that the main obstacle to fully utilizing LZ coal at the molecular scale in CLC was the dominance of C-C/C-H groups, with the highest relative content over 62% at the 700 degrees C reaction temperature. Increasing the reaction temperature was quite effective to promote the efficient utilization of LZ coal from the molecular perspective during the reaction between LZ coal and CuFe2O4.									35	5	0	0	2	0	39			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000402023600069

There are proven examples of this technology being implemented in a society like Iceland, where electrolytic hydrogen generation powered by renewable energy has been developed to support the demand of the transportation sector. Hydrogen generation via electrolysis consists of the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. Conventional electrode materials used for the electrolysis belong to the platinum group metals that are expensive. In this work, Raney cobalt as an alternative which is inexpensive, electrodeposited from a Watts bath is reported. In addition, modifying the Watts bath composition and combining two types of Raney have also been investigated and reported. We have identified overpotentials of -349 mV for the best Raney cobalt sample and -270 mV when Raney nickel is combined with Raney cobalt for hydrogen evolution in alkaline medium at 100 mA cm(-2). Another objective of this work is resolving the difficulties found in interpreting the electrochemical impedance data for Raney type materials. The nickel binder competes with Raney cobalt during the reaction, these interactions exhibit different impedances. The electrodeposited electrodes have been tested for energy efficiency with overpotential curves and electrochemical impedance measurements. Additional tests including X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive analysis have also been undertaken that support the results of the catalyst surfaces under study.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1452-3981			WOS:000366177700048

In this study, Pt was deposited via atomic layer deposition (ALD) onto TiO2-Y which allowed a good control of the particle size through the number of ALD cycles. During the ALD process, a thin-film of reduced titania is formed on the Pt surface, which leads to SMSI effects. With increasing Pt particle size, the fraction of the titania-covered Pt surface decreases. As a result, the extent of platinum oxide formation in cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements scales with the size of the Pt particles. The influence of these thin titanium oxide films, which cover the Pt surface, on the catalytic behavior with respect to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), CO oxidation and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is investigated by using an RDE setup. The covering TiOx thin-films reduce the ability to catalyze ORR, OER and CO oxidation, while it does not influence the HOR and Pt H-UPD formation. These findings indicate that proton and hydrogen transport are possible through the thin TiOx film, while oxygenated species suffer from transport limitations through the thin-film. Due to this selective permeability, these materials are able to oxidize hydrogen well beyond 1.2 V-RHE. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

The intrinsic catalytic activity could be improved by adjusting the electronic structure of the catalyst through interface modification engineering. In this work, Fe ion-chelated tannic acid was coated on Ni-WOx nanowires to form TA-Fe@Ni-WOx hierarchical structure by the interfacial coordination assembly process. The hierarchical structure has abundant active sites and good electrical conductivity, which exhibits extraordinary OER performance in alkaline electrolytes. Specifically, the TA-Fe@Ni-WOx catalyst requires low over-potentials of 240 and 260 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results confirm that the electronic structure of TA-Fe@Ni-WOx is more beneficial to OER than Ni-WOx due to the introduction of the TA-Fe nano-sheets overlayer on the surface of Ni-WOx nanowires. Furthermore, the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy results confirm that the TA-Fe@Ni-WOx hierarchical structure has an upward-moving Fermi energy and a smaller ionization potential, providing a more electron-rich environment. It is demonstrated that this simple interfacial coordination assembly coating strategy is an effective way to reasonably adjust the surface properties of metal oxides for promising applications.

Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)								e2207494	e2207494		10.1002/adma.202207494				2022-Oct-03	2022	Nanocrystalline or amorphous cobalt oxyhydroxides (CoCat) are promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While having the same short-range order, CoCat phases possess different electrocatalytic properties. This phenomenon is not conclusively understood, as multiple interdependent parameters affect the OER activity simultaneously. Herein, a layered cobalt borophosphate precatalyst, Co(H2 O)2 [B2 P2 O8 (OH)2 ]·H2 O, is fully reconstructed into two different CoCat phases. In contrast to previous reports, this reconstruction is not initiated at the surface but at the electrode substrate to catalyst interface. Ex situ and in situ investigations of the two borophosphate derived CoCats, as well as the prominent CoPi and CoBi identify differences in the Tafel slope/range, buffer binding and content, long-range order, number of accessible edge sites, redox activity, and morphology. Considering and interconnecting these aspects together with proton mass-transport limitations, a comprehensive picture is provided explaining the different OER activities. The most decisive factors are the buffers used for reconstruction, the number of edge sites that are not inhibited by irreversibly bonded buffers, and the morphology. With this acquired knowledge, an optimized OER system is realized operating in near-neutral potassium borate medium at 1.62±0.03VRHE yielding 250mAcm-2 at 65°C for 1month without degrading performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1521-4095		MEDLINE:36189873	36189873

Herein, ternary phosphides in the palladium-nickel-phosphorus system developed via a simple reduction approach as hollow and dense nanostructures (PdNiP-H and PdNiP-D, respectively) are shown to overcome the kinetic drawbacks of Pd and deliver superior alkaline OER activity. The PdNiP-H showed OER activity at a significantly lower overpotential (300 mV) and Tafel slope (48 mV dec(-1)) in addition to having a longer stability than the corresponding dense particles (PdNiP-D) (330 mV and 49 mV dec(-1)) and the commercial benchmark, RuO2 (360 mV and 67 mV dec(-1)), in half-cell conditions. While combining experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, these enhancements are shown to arise from surface properties and the modified electronic environment of the ternary phosphide as well as by the enhanced charge transfer sites due to the hollow architecture. DFT calculations identify the density of states (DOS) and support Pd lattice alteration, the shift in the d band center, and the subsequent modification electronic properties of Pd that is favorable for OER. The phosphodization methodology adopted here highlights an efficient strategy for generating a range of morphologies of ternary phosphides as sustainable and stable energy conversion/storage materials.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2574-0962			WOS:000510104700096

Herein, we report a facile method for the synthesis of 3D-hierarchical porous iridium oxide/N-doped carbon hybrid (3D-IrO2/N@C) and its superior OER and HER activity in acid. In 0.5 M HClO4, this catalyst exhibited remarkable activity towards OER with a low overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) current density, a low Tafel slope of 45 mV/dec and similar to 98% faradaic efficiency. The mass activity (MA) and turnover frequency (TOF) are found to be 833 mA/mg and 0.432 s(-1) at overpotential of 350 mV which are similar to 32 times higher than commercial (comm.) IrO2. The HER performance of this 3D-IrO2/N@C is comparable with comm. Pt/C catalyst in acid. This 3D-IrO2/NOC catalyst requires only 35 mV overpotential to reach a current density 10 mA/cm(2) with Tafel slope 31 mV/dec. Most importantly, chronoamperometric stability test confirmed superior stability of this catalyst towards HER and OER in acid. This 3D-IrO2/NCPC catalyst was applied as both cathode and anode for over-all water splitting and required only 1.55 V overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in acid. The outstanding activity of the 3D-IrO2/N@C catalyst can be attributed to a unique hierarchical porous network, high surface area, higher electron and mass transportation, synergistic interaction between IrO2 and carbon support.

Resistive switching devices were fabricated from single-crystal rutile TiO2 substrates through focused ion beam milling and lift-out techniques. Defect evolution and phase transformations in rutile TiO2 were monitored by diffraction contrast imaging inside the TEM during electrical biasing. Reversible bipolar resistive switching behavior was observed in these single-crystal TiO2 devices. Biased induced reduction reactions created increased oxygen vacancy concentrations to such an extent that shear faults (Wadsley defects) and oxygen-deficient phases (Magneli phases) formed over large volumes within the TiO2 TEM specimen. Nevertheless, the observed reversible formation/dissociation of Wadsley defects does not appear to correlate to resistive switching phenomena at these length scales. These defect zones were found to reversibly reconfigure in a manner consistent with charged oxygen vacancy migration responding to the applied bias polarity.					47th Annual Congress of the Portuguese-Society-for-Microscopy47th Annual Congress of the Portuguese-Society-for-Microscopy	DEC 09-10, 2013DEC 09-10, 2013	Portuguese Soc MicroscopyPortuguese Soc Microscopy	Monte de Caparica, PORTUGALMonte de Caparica, PORTUGAL	33	0	0	0	3	0	33			1431-9276	1435-8115		WOS:000351763500014	25529361

All alternatives to platinum thus far are based on nonprecious metals, and, to our knowledge, there is no report about a catalyst for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution beyond metals. Here we couple graphitic-carbon nitride with nitrogen-doped graphene to produce a metal-free hybrid catalyst, which shows an unexpected hydrogen evolution reaction activity with comparable overpotential and Tafel slope to some of well-developed metallic catalysts. Experimental observations in combination with density functional theory calculations reveal that its unusual electrocatalytic properties originate from an intrinsic chemical and electronic coupling that synergistically promotes the proton adsorption and reduction kinetics.									1585	73	0	0	103	1	1600			2041-1723			WOS:000335375400002	24769657

This electrode shows a significantly higher activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and longer lifetime than the IrO2/Ti electrodes without a TNTs layer. The influence of IrO2 amount and calcination temperatures on oxygen evolution as well as morphology and phase characteristics were studied by electrochemical measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. The results show that the catalytic properties of oxide electrodes highly depended on the loading amount of IrO2 and calcination temperatures. The electrode fabricated at calcination temperature of 600 degrees C showed a weak electrocatalytic activity due to high degree of crystallinity, grain growth, accumulation of active component and the collapse of TNTs. On the contrary, the IrO2/TNTs/Ti electrode prepared at low calcination temperature (400 degrees C) possesses extremely more surface active sites and high activity for oxygen evolution in the initial stage, but its service life is very short. The IrO2/TNTs/Ti electrode was found to achieve the lowest film resistance and the charge transfer resistance at an optimal loading amount of 6 g/m(2). By simply optimizing both calcination temperature and IrO2 loading amount, IrO2/TNTs/Ti electrode with high activity and long lifetime can be fabricated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We have developed an efficient lanthanum-doped alpha-Ni(OH)(2) bifunctional catalyst with a 1D-2D-3D hierarchical nanostructure. It shows superior activity and stability in the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Enrichment of the edge sites and conducting La doping in alpha-Ni(OH)(2) phase enable formation and stabilization of abundant local Ni3+ ions. This guarantees ultralow onset potentials in electro-oxidation reactions. The 1D-2D-3D hierarchical nanostructure significantly boosts the in situ generation of high-valence active species, which results in efficient and stable OER and UOR performances, and the synergistic merit of doping-induced facile reaction kinetics. Because of the structural benefits of a large surface area, charge-transfer promotion, good structural stability, and bifunctionality, a 1% La-doped alpha-Ni(OH)(2) hierarchical nanostructure gives superior OER and UOR performances with low overpotentials, large catalytic current densities, and excellent operational stability. It is therefore a promising catalyst for use in simultaneous alkaline wastewater treatment and hydrogen production.

Despite this large variation in oxygen partial pressure, there was almost no change in the concentration of incorporated oxygen. However, increasing the oxygen partial pressure significantly enhanced the photoluminescence of the oxygen-related transition at 1.9 eV. The evolution of lattice constants, as determined by high-resolution x-ray diffraction, appeared to follow Vegard's law for ideal substitutional alloys for ZnTeO films prepared at 10(-7) Torr and 10(-6) Torr, while a pronounced deviation occurred at 10(-5) Torr. Channeling nuclear reaction analysis further revealed the complexity of oxygen incorporation, as no significant shadowing was observed from the epitaxial films. The evidence suggests that the oxygen location in ZnTeO is more complicated than O-Te substitutional defects in a homogeneous solid solution, and that the configuration of the oxygen dopant might play an important role in the band structure and optical properties of the alloys.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000334182700015

The photocatalytic performance of the prepared materials was evaluated in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) following UV-LED irradiation of aqueous solutions containing iron ions as sacrificial electron acceptors. The highest activity for water oxidation was obtained with the photocatalyst thermally treated at 700 degrees C (TiO2-700). Photocatalysts with larger anatase to rutile ratio of the crystalline phases and higher surface density of oxygen vacancies (defects) displayed the best performance in OER. The oxygen defects at the photocatalyst surface have proven to be responsible for the enhanced photoactivity, acting as important active adsorption sites for water oxidation. Seeking technological application, water oxidation was accomplished by immobilising the photocatalyst with the highest OER rate measured under the established batch conditions (TiO2-700). Experiments operating under continuous mode revealed a remarkable efficiency for oxygen production, exceeding 12% of the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 384 nm (UV-LED system) compared to the batch operation mode.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2045-2322			WOS:000712891800016	34716398

Here we describe hybrid electrocatalysts that have strongly coupled metal (Co-Fe) polyphenolic networks (MPNs) and Fe3O4 nanoparticles for catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with exceptional activity. These catalysts were produced by a tannic acid (TA) mediated conversion process that selectively converts the surface layers of pre-synthesized zeolitic imidazole framework-67 (ZIF-67)@Fe3O4 core-shell nanoparticles to uniformly wrapped organic MPN layers. The MPN layers are composed of metal-phenolic complexes that are rich in molecular metal hydro(oxy)oxide (M-OH, M-O-M) centers that not only increase the electrochemical surface area by approximately four times but also serve as highly active sites for the OER. As a result of the structural and compositional benefits, the hybrid catalysts only require an overpotential of 260 mV to produce oxygen at 10 mA cm(-2) and have a Tafel slope of only 33.6 mV dec(-1) in alkaline electrolytes, which are the lowest when compared with pristine ZIF-67@Fe3O4, Fe3O4 and the benchmark IrO2 catalysts.									30	1	0	0	2	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472566400046

A set of ruthenium high surface area CeO2 oxides, with two different Ru loadings, was prepared for studying the evolution of Ru and Ce species during CO oxidation reaction, using a reaction mixture of 1 % CO, 0.5 % O-2, N-2 balance and a contact time W/F-CO = 7.4 g(cat) h mol(CO)(-1). The samples were characterized by S-BET, XRD, DRS UV-vis, TPR, Raman spectroscopy, and XPS. Furthermore, the samples were investigated by FTIR measurements during CO oxidation under reaction conditions. The catalysts with low Ru loading (1.5 wt.%) presented higher catalytic activity than those containing a higher Ru loading (3 % wt.). The catalytic activity test results strongly depend on electronic changes observed at the interface/surface of ceria support. The characterization results and FTIR investigation during CO oxidation show that the presence of ruthenium species modifies the electronic properties of the ceria surface promoting a change at their surface where a redox-mechanism was detected. This causes the formation of surface oxygen vacancies which promotes oxygen mobility from the ceria lattice contributing to the CO oxidation. The ruthenium incorporation drastically favors the CO adsorption (carbonyl and dicarbonyl species). However, our FTIR data not shown a direct correlation between the ruthenium-carbonyl species (linear and bridged form) on the CO transformation. Further, the presence of ruthenium enhances the formation of surface oxygen vacancies, which favor the oxygen mobility from the ceria lattice toward the CO oxidation. It was found that at low temperatures (close down to the maximum conversion), the CO oxidation preferably happened on oxygen vacancy sites.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2468-8231			WOS:000555573300035

Developing highly efficient and non-noble metal based dual-functional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting to generate hydrogen and oxygen has become more critical. In order to fulfill the requirements of efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), herein, we report novel hierarchical Co(OH)F@CoFe-LDH heterostructured nanorod arrays fabricated via a facile two-step approach. The resultant Co(OH)F@CoFe-LDH displays exceptional electrocatalytic OER and HER activity with a small overpotential of 240 mV and 130 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Further, the electrocatalyst revealed excellent long-term stability during a recyclability test for 37 h. The superior performance of Co(OH)F@CoFe-LDH can be attributed to the synergistic effect at the interface of the Co(OH)F nanorods and the covered CoFe-LDH nanosheets. Meanwhile, Co(OH)F@CoFe-LDH as a water electrolyzer to produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) requires a small voltage of 1.58 V. This work paves the way for the design and construction of low cost and highly efficient 3D hierarchical electrodes for practical applications in electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1466-8033		WOS:000838186500001

Among the different families of materials, catalysts based on transition metals supported on a nitrogen-containing carbon matrix have been found to be effective catalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with high potential to replace conventional precious metal-based catalysts. In this work, we developed a facile synthesis strategy to obtain a Fe-N-C bifunctional ORR/HER catalysts, involving wet impregnation and pyrolysis steps. Iron (II) acetate and imidazole were used as iron and nitrogen sources, respectively, and functionalized carbon black pearls were used as conductive support. The bifunctional performance of the Fe-N-C catalyst toward ORR and HER was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, rotating ring disk electrode experiments, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in alkaline environment. ORR onset potential and half-wave potential were 0.95 V and 0.86 V, respectively, indicating a competitive performance in comparison with the commercial platinum-based catalyst. In addition, Fe-N-C had also a good HER activity, with an overpotential of 478 mV @10 mAcm(-2) and Tafel slope of 133 mVdec(-1), demonstrating its activity as bifunctional catalyst in energy conversion and storage devices, such as alkaline microbial fuel cell and microbial electrolysis cells.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4				2073-4344		WOS:000736043100001

There is a dire need to develop cost-effective and easily accessible methods to make metal oxides, aiming to execute the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at low overpotential and high stability for long-term activity. Thin-film metal oxides for water oxidation are prepared via aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) on simple substrates as shown here. Catalytic films (CFs) of CoOx, NiOx, CuOx, and FeOx are phase pure oxides, smooth, and of nanoparticulate type, and are highly crystalline. Water oxidation catalysis is initiated at low onset potentials and achieves 10 mA cm(-2) just at the potentials of 250-330 mV in 1.0 m KOH solution. All catalysts present impressive kinetics behavior for boosting OER activity, signifying their inherent potential for propelling water oxidation at lower energy demands. Excitingly, stable current densities remain sustained during prolonged period water catalysis. Promising behavior of the ultrafine CFs is attributed to the exploitation of the elegant synthetic strategy under controlled conditions to realize a high redox potential and cyclic M2+/3+ couple activation with sustainable catalytic active sites. Nanoscale and porous features of the highly pure and crystalline films further promote the electrocatalytic process and remain intact even after long-term catalytic investigations.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000618627200001

Nowadays, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water splitting is crucial to the cost-effective production of the pure hydrogen fuel, while oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells has been suffering from sluggish reaction kinetics even if a high loading of platinum is applied. In this context, it is of great urgency to develop new catalysts comparable to traditional noble metal catalysts in electrocatalytic activity but composed of earth-abundant elements. In the past decade, 2D layered MoS2-based materials have demonstrated great potential as non-noble metal catalysts for both HER and ORR to meet the two aforementioned requirements. To this end, we conduct this survey aimed at summarizing the recent efforts in addressing electrocatalytic issues involved in HER and ORR activities using 2D MoS2 materials. Starting from an introduction on the superiorities of MoS2-based electrocatalysts for HER and ORR in this review, we then discuss the critical obstacles faced by MoS2 nanosheets with respect to their catalytic activities. Subsequently, we summarize the recent strategies for improving the catalytic activity of MoS2-based materials and the updated advances. In the end, we suggest potential pathways for high-catalytic performance comparable to those of their noble-metal counterparts and give some perspectives on practical applications of MoS2-based materials in the future. The insightful views from this review are believed to be greatly beneficial for accomplishing a better understanding on 2D layered MoS2-based material catalysts in electrocatalytic activities.									135	10	0	0	6	0	138			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000417063200001

Despite achieving great progress, fabricating 2D nanostructures of non-layered ternary thiospinels remains a great challenge, and their bifunctional electrocatalytic properties toward both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) have not been explored. In this paper, 2D nanostructures of an earth-abundant non-layered ternary thiospinel compound - CuCo2S4 nanosheets (NSs) - with their (111), (022) and (004) planes mainly exposed, are synthesized via a "leveling metal activity and structure-directed one-pot sulfurization" strategy. The electrocatalytic tests in alkaline solution show that such CuCo2S4 NSs can efficiently catalyze both the ORR and OER, whose bifunctional catalytic properties are superior to binary metal sulfide nanostructures, Pt/C, CuCo2S4 nanoparticles, and recently reported some bifunctional oxygen-electrode catalysts (e.g. CoxSy@C-1000, N-doped G/CNTs, Co3O4/NBGHSs, CoFe2O4, Cox Mn3-xO4, MnOx, NiCo2S4 hollow spheres, NiCo2S4@N/S-rGO, etc.). Combined with spin-polarized density functional theory computations based on a computational hydrogen electrode model, their excellent bifunctional catalytic properties originate from the presence of the two special facets, (022) and (004), which have different preferences in terms of the ORR/OER. This work not only enriches the current 2D material family but also paves the way for rational design of advanced multifunctional 2D electrocatalysts for use in renewable energy fields.									57	2	0	0	3	0	58			2052-1553			WOS:000388757700001

In this work, we synthesize isolated Co sites supported on colloidal WS2 nanosheets and develop a synthetic strategy to rationally control the first-shell coordination environment surrounding the adsorbed Co active sites. By studying Co-WS2 materials with a range of Co-S coordination numbers, we are able to identify the optimal active site for pH 7 oxygen reduction catalysis, which comprises cobalt atoms bound to the WS2 support with a Co-S coordination number of 3-4. The optimized Co-WS2 material exhibits an oxygen reduction onset potential of 0.798 V vs. RHE, which is comparable to the most active bulk phases of cobalt sulfide in neutral electrolyte conditions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000656562300001

We found that the work function of GO exposed in UV shows a notable decrease with increasing irradiation time, which is proposed to be attributed to the gradual disappearance of oxygen-containing functional groups in GO during the UV-induced reduction reaction process. Fourier transform infrared spectrum and Raman spectrum were used to confirm the reduction of GO under UV irradiation. Our study would give an insight into understanding the transformation of GO's electronic structures during the reduction process.

It was shown that the evolution of the solid solution could always take place whether with or without water vapor and oxygen. When water vapor is present in the atmosphere, the evolution temperature of the intermediate phase was lower than the one without vapor. The intermediate phase of Y2Cu2O5 with the vapor was observed at 680 A degrees C. By calculating the changes of Gibbs free energy of reactions possibly involved in the IHP, the priority reaction with water vapor was CuF2 > YF3 > BaF2 when CuF2, YF3, and BaF2 coexisted while CuF2 and YF3 prefer to react with BaO to form BaF2 while they coexisted. The appearance of intermediate phase features could be illustrated through the calculation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1557-1939	1557-1947		WOS:000379347200006

This approach involves the interpretation of post-activation temperature programmed desorption (TPD) spectra. The procedure involves first forming oxygen complexes on a carbon surface by oxygen gasification. Subsequently, the sample temperature is raised in a low-pressure inert carrier gas (helium) at a programmed heating rate, during which the rates of evolution of CO and CO2 are measured. A comparison of gas evolution results and surface areas determined from nitrogen adsorption isotherms using the alpha (s)-plot method, show that there exist strong correlations between the nature of the resultant porosity and its development, and post-reaction desorption features of oxygen surface complexes formed during the activation process. It is demonstrated that the surface area of the larger pores and the total CO2 evolved upon TPD are correlated. It is concluded that the GO-evolving complexes are formed over the entire surface area of the chars during activation, but that the surface area in the larger porosity is primarily responsible for the formation of CO2-evolving surface complexes. The relationship between micropore surface area and the CO evolution 'corrected' for the expected contribution from carboxylic acid anhydride surface complexes in the larger porosity, indicates that these latter types of complexes may be responsible for much of the CO2 evolution under conditions when oxygen is the activating agent.

However, impurities present in the seawater, especially chloride ions (Cl-), cause corrosion of the electrode material, and its oxidation competes with the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By carefully tuning electrode substrate and electrolyte solutions, the CoFeOxHy/Ti electrode with high double-layer capacitance actively and stably electro-catalyzed the OER in potassium borate solutions at pH 9.2 in the presence of 0.5 mol kg(-1) Cl-. The electrode possesses an active site motif composed of either a Co- or Fe-domain and benefits from an enlarged surface area. Selective OER was demonstrated in Cl--containing electrolyte solutions at an elevated reaction temperature, stably achieving 500 mA cm(-2) at a mere potential of 1.67 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 353 K for multiple on-off and long-term testing processes with a faradaic efficiency of unity toward the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000848440100001	35921042

In this report, a unique catalyst of free-standing sandwiched NiFe nanoparticles encapsulated by graphene sheets is first devised and fabricated. In this method, we use low-cost, sustainable, and environmentally friendly glucose as a carbon source, ultrathin Fe-doped Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets as a precursor, and a sacrificial template. This special nanoarchitecture with a conductive network around active catalysts can accelerate electron transfer and prevent NiFe nanoparticles from aggregation and peeling off during long-time electrochemical reactions, thereby exhibiting an excellent OER activity and stability in basic solutions. In this work, our sandwiched catalyst presents well activities of a low onset of similar to 1.44 V (vs RHE) and Tafel slope of similar to 30 mV/decade in 1 M KOH at a scan rate of 5 mV/s.									82	3	0	0	3	0	83			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000354338800032	25875900

Quantum requirement measurements of the photosynthetic oxygen evolution resulted in about 12 quanta for excitation of chlorophylls a and d and 18 for phycocyanin. The data also revealed that these pigments are involved in energy absorption for photosynthetic oxygen evolution. Energy is transferred efficiently and equally well between the chlorophylls. Light absorbed by phycocyanin which is organized in phycobiliprotein aggregates (marquardt et al., 1997), results in a less efficient energy transfer to the reaction center chlorophylls.									18	0	0	0	14	0	18			0939-5075			WOS:A1997YE46700010

The key dilemma for efficient large-scale production of hydrogen by splitting of water via the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER, respectively) is the high overpotential required, especially for the OER. We report an exceptionally active and durable OER catalyst yielding current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of only 259 mV and 289 mV in alkaline electrolyte, respectively, fulfilling the commercial criteria of the OER process. Together with a good HER catalyst, we have achieved the commercially required current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2) at 1.586 and 1.657 V, respectively, with very good stability, dramatically Lower than any previously reported voltage. This discovery sets the stage for large-scale hydrogen production by water splitting using excess electrical power whenever and wherever available.									296	15	0	0	13	0	296			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000448339100032

Herein, metal-organic framework-derived N-doped carbon nanotubes (MOF-NCNTs) were first employed as electrocatalysts for hybrid sodium-air batteries (SABs), which exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to commercial Pt/C. The battery using MOF-NCNTs displayed the voltage gap of 0.30 V at a current density of 0.1 mA.cm(-2), which is the lowest among all the tested catalysts including commercial Pt/C (0.50 V), RuO2 (0.50 V), Co-CNTs (0.67 V), NCNTs (0.77 V), MWNTs (0.90 V), and carbon paper (1.18 V). In addition, the average discharge plateau and round trip efficiency of the battery was 2.81 V and 87% during 35 cycles at a current density of 0.1 mA.cm(-2), respectively. The remarkable electrocatalytic activity is mainly ascribed to the synergistic effect between the N dopants and confined Co nanoparticles in the CNTs, the hollow structure of NCNTs, and the robust porous cage structure. The N dopants and confined Co nanoparticles in the CNTs induce more catalytic active sites and promote electron transfer for the ORR and OER. The hollow framework structure of NCNTs not only offer structural defect sites for O-2 adsorption, but also improves mass transport and electronic conductivity, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity. The robust porous cage structure contributes to the stability of the catalysts. The highly efficient and inexpensive metal-organic framework-derived NCNT is a promising bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for practical applications in hybrid SABs and other metal-air batteries.									70	7	1	0	4	0	73			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000449444000042

Transition metals are ideal candidates because of their high abundance, impressive activities, and easy accessibility. However, a facile method leading to improved performance and stability is still needed. Herein, a highly efficient carbon-encapsulated bimetal catalyst derived from Ni-based metal-organic-frameworks (MOF) was successfully prepared through the low-temperature (350 degC) pyrolysis of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) precursors under H2/Ar atmosphere. Cube-structured PBA as template and precursor, parameters during the pyrolysis process including temperature and calcination atmosphere can be tuned to control the structure and properties of the catalysts. Benefiting from the porous three-dimensional (3D) cubic structure and abundant defect-rich amorphous N-doped carbon shell, Ni3Fe@NC-350 exhibits excellent OER activity. The as-prepared catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic performance for OER in 1.0 M KOH with an overpotential of 237 mV to achieve 10 mA cm-2. More importantly, the presented catalyst has an extremely good durability. All rights reserved Elsevier.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1873-4669			INSPEC:21910326

Herein we report a soft-oxometalate (SOM)-based heterogeneous photocatalytic system which effectively performs water oxidation giving oxygen. In the present work we placed a double sandwich type manganese -based polyoxometalate (POM), Na-17(Mn6P3W24O94(H2O)(2)]center dot 43H(2)O, on an electroactive graphene oxide matrix and synthesized a new SOM [Na-17[M(n)6P(3)W(24)O(94)(H2O)(2)].43H(2)O@graphene oxide] 1 and performed water oxidation with it. The efficiency of photocatalytic water oxidation by SOM 1 is almost double than in the case of NavIMn P W (H2O)(2)]center dot 43H(2)O alone. The rationale behind this lies in the electron accepting reaction nature of the graphene sheets which effectively relay the electrons generated in the water oxidation reaction, thus facilitating the forward reaction and increasing the oxygen yield. Variation of catalyst loading, pH-dependent and time -dependent experiments are performed to study their effects on photocatalytic water-splitting. The reaction kinetics is sigmoidal in nature, suggesting the heterogeneous nature of catalysis. The composite catalyst system is observed to be stable towards the reaction conditions.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000371559000016

Herein, a series of Pd-Ru alloyed nanoparticles encapsulated in porous carbon nanosheets (CNs) were synthesized and employed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both ORR and HER. The TEM measurements showed that Pd-Ru nanoparticles, with a size of approximately 1-5 nm, were uniformly dispersed on the carbon nanosheets. The crystal and electronic structures of the PdxRu100-x/CNs series were revealed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The as-prepared samples exhibited effective ORR activity in alkaline media and excellent HER activity in both alkaline and acid solutions. The Pd50Ru50/CNs sample displayed the best activity and stability among the series, which is comparable and superior to that of commercial 10% Pd/C. For ORR, the Pd50Ru50/CNs catalyst exhibited an onset potential of 0.903 V vs. RHE (Reversible Hydrogen Electrode) and 11.4% decrease of the current density after 30,000 s of continuous operation in stability test. For HER, the Pd50Ru50/CNs catalyst displayed an overpotential of 37.3 mV and 45.1 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively.

Here, a resultful strategy is proposed for fabricating nitrogen-doped 1D beaded-like structure carbon nanofibers uniformly decorated with nitrogen-doped CuCo2O4 nanoparticles (N-CuCo2O4 @CNFs) toward boosting oxygen evolution reaction/oxygen reduction reaction (OER/ORR) catalysis. Taking advantage of the synergistic effect between interconnected 1D hierarchical porous carbon nanofiber structure and high catalytic activity of N-doped CuCo2O4 nanoparticles derived from bimetallic MOFs, the N-CuCo2O4 @CNFs catalysts possess enhanced reaction kinetics and preferable charge transfer ability. Impressively, the obtained catalysts exhibit prominent electrocatalytic ability and superior stability for OER/ORR, even surpass the commercial RuO2 and Pt/C. More significantly, the Zn-air batteries employing the N-CuCo2O4 @CNFs-800 as cathode display a higher power density of 175.6 mW cm(-2), a lower chargedischarge voltage gap of 0.82 Vat 10 mA cm(-2), as well as a better cycling stability with respect to those of Pt/C + RuO2 mixture, demonstrating the great potential of N-CuCo2O4 @CNF as a high-efficiency catalyst for clean energy devices.

Herein, we present the construction of a three-dimensional cobalt sulfide/multi-heteroatom co-doped carbon composite as a trifunctional electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) through one-step sulfidation of zeolitic-imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) using sulfur powder as a sulfur source. By virtue of the distinct periodic metal-nitrogen coordination structure and the abundant micropores within the ZIF precursor, sub-10 nm Co9S8 nanoparticles (NPs) are homogenously anchored on a Co, S and N multi-heteroatom co-doped carbon framework with a large specific surface area that exposes sufficient reactive sites for these electrocatalytic reactions. The optimized Co9S8/CoNSC exhibits outstanding ORR, OER and HER performance, comparable or even superior to those of commercial Pt/C and RuO2. The small Co9S8 NPs and Co-N-x species embedded in the carbon matrix cooperatively catalyze the OER and ORR, while the HER catalysis is mainly contributed by Co9S8 NPs. Furthermore, the Co9S8/CoNSC shows outstanding anti-poisoning capability towards sulfur species during ORR catalysis with no obvious activity degradation observed in 0.1 M KOH containing 50 mu M SO32- species, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C. The assembled rechargeable Zn-air battery using the Co9S8/CoNSC as a cathode shows a high power density (150 mW cm(-2)) and the assembled water electrolyzer only requires 1.585 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) when using this material as an anode and a cathode. This work provides an effective strategy to design and synthesize efficient, durable and anti-poisoning cobalt chalcogenide-based trifunctional electrocatalysts for the large-scale application of clean energy conversion devices.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000820381700001	35772340

To address these two issues, a facile and economical strategy is demonstrated for the preparation of the bimetallic sulfides anchored three-dimensional (3D) nitrogen-doped graphene foam (MoS2-NiS2/NGF) hybrid for efficient overall water splitting. As a result, strong interactions occur between MoS2-NiS2 nanoparticles and NGF with unique 3D interconnected tubular hollow structure, leading to the superior performance towards HER and OER. The overpotential and charge transfer resistance of the hybrid are much lower than those of the bare NGF, MoS2/NGF, NiS2/NGF, and physically mixed MoS2-NiS2 + NGF, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of NGF and bimetallic sulfides with hetero interfaces, thus endowing MoS2-NiS2/NGF abundant active sites and diversified pathways for highly-efficient transport of mass and electron. This bifunctional catalyst also exhibits excellent overall water splitting capability with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.64 V, which provides a platform for the synthesis of large-scale and cost-efficient catalysts for water splitting.									167	15	0	0	8	0	169			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000472697500003

Herein, a controlled direct electrodeposition strategy is developed to deposit the heterogeneous crystalline NiFe (cNF)/ amorphous NiFe-(oxy)hydroxide (aNFO) standing nanosheets on the NiMo modified substrate (NM@cNF/aNFO) as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The precise control of electrodeposition voltage can tune the component ratio of cNF and aNFO and the yield of cNF/aNFO nanosheets, and-3.5 V is the optimal voltage. The ultrafine NiFe nanocrystals with good electronic conductivity and abundant edges, the amorphous NiFe-(oxy)hydroxide support with rich nanosized pores and defects, and the firm grasp of the NiMo alloy toward the standing nanosheets generate complex synergistic effects, rendering abundant active sites, fast charge and mass transfer, and excellent electrochemical stability. NM@cNF/aNFO can achieve 20 mA cm-2 at a low overpotential of 133.2 mV with a small Tafel slope of 19.9 mV dec(- 1) for oxygen evolution reaction and 91.9 mV with 59.9 mV dec-1 for hydrogen evolution reaction. Accordingly, NM@cNF/aNFO as both anode and cathode delivers 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.45 V and prominent stability for over 100 h even at 100 mA cm(-2). Our work demonstrates a facile voltage-controlled electrodeposition strategy for the design of highly active, cost-effective, stable, and bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000817886300007

Heat-treatment temperature plays a crucial effect on improving the ORR electrocatalytic performance in alkaline electrolyte: the higher the heat-treatment temperature the better the electrocatalytic performance. Generation of defects arising from the removal of oxygen-containing group as a consequence of heat-treatment plays an essential role. Both XRD and Raman indicate that the higher heat-treatment temperature the greater defective nature of graphene, indicating the significant contribution of carbon intrinsic defects to its ORR activity. XPS of GO-800 distinctly shows the only presences of Cls and Ols without any other element, especially metal signal, namely the dopant-free graphene. This work confirms graphene without interruption by any other dopants can be applied as an efficient ORR electrocatalyst.

Herein, we firstly introduced a multifunctional electrocatalyst of rose-like Cu-doped Ni3S2 nanoflowers decorated with thin NiFe LDH nanosheets (Cu-Ni3S2@NiFe LDH) with excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and water electrolysis performance. More impressively, CuNi3S2@NiFe LDH-200 target catalyst shows the huge potential to replace the slow OER with urea electrolysis when it is used to catalyze urea oxidation reaction (UOR). In addition, the structure-function relationship of material was highlighted and the performance of target catalyst was well revealed by analyzing the growth law of NiFe LDH on Cu-doped Ni3S(2). It's worth noting that Cu-Ni3S(2)@NiFe LDH-100 performs well for HER, while Cu-Ni3S2@NiFe LDH-200 stands out for OER and UOR. The resulting Cu-Ni3S2@NiFe LDH-200(+)//Cu-Ni3S2@NiFe LDH-100(-) electrode couple only requires 1.502 V and 1.413 V to deliver the same current density of 10 mA cm-2 for water electrolysis and urea electrolysis and catalyzed stably for over 20 h, which is one of the best catalytic activities reported so far. Our work will open a new idea to enhance the catalytic activity and stability of transition metal sulfides with layered double hydroxides.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000775632700002

However, due to the complicated electronic structures of metal oxides, the correlation of the binding energies of reaction intermediates (*OH, *O, and * OOH) in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with experimentally controllable properties of metal oxides has not been well established. Here we demonstrate that excess electrons are the essential factor that governs the binding properties of intermediates on the surfaces of reducible metal oxides. We propose that the number of excess electrons (NEE) is an essential activity descriptor toward the OER activities of these oxides, which perfectly reproduces the volcano curve plotted using the descriptor Delta G(O) - Delta G(OH), so that tuning NEE can effectively tailor the OER activities of reducible metal oxide based catalysts. Guided by this descriptor, we predict a novel non-precious catalyst with an overpotential of 0.54 eV, which could be a potential alternative to current Ru or Ir based catalysts.									40	2	0	0	2	0	40			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000461228400021	30996921

However, the performance of ZABs in such flexible environment is significantly hindered by the kinetically sluggish rate of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the air electrode, especially upon large deformation due to the lack of highly active and squeezable electrode materials. Herein, we present an advanced electrode by directly depositing Fe-doped Co3O4 nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon foams (Fe-Co3O4 NWs@NCFs) with superior bifunctional catalytic performance (E-j=10 (OER) - E-1/2 (ORR) = 0.61 V) in an alkaline medium. As a proof-of-concept application, a highly squeezable all-solid-state ZAB was assembled with Fe-Co3O4 NWs@NCFs as the air electrode and Zn NSs@NCFs (electrodeposited Zn nanosheets on NCFs) as the Zn electrode, which is shown to possess a high open circuit potential (1.51 V), a low discharge/charge voltage gap (0.657 V at 5 mA cm(-2)) and a large power density (260 mW cm(-2)). Furthermore, the great squeeze-ability (up to 60% strain) and mechanical endurance properties (tested by repetitive compressions for 500 cycles) in particular make the ZAB a potentially promising power source for compression-tolerant electronics.									33	0	0	0	0	0	33			2405-8297			WOS:000495867200036

Herein, we propose an original material combination to selectively trigger oxygen evolution from seawater at expenses of chlorine generation. The target systems, based on MnO2 or Mn2O3 decorated with Fe2O3 or Co3O4, are fabricated by plasma enhanced-chemical vapor deposition of manganese oxides, functionalization with Fe2O3 and Co3O4 by sputtering, and annealing in air/Ar to obtain Mn(IV)/Mn(III) oxides. Among the various options, MnO2 decorated with Co3O4 yields the best performances in alkaline seawater splitting, with an outstanding Tafel slope of approximate to 40 mV x dec(-1) and an overpotential of 450 mV, enabling to rule out chlorine evolution. These attractive performances, resulting from the synergistic contribution of catalytic and electronic effects, open the door to low-cost hydrogen generation from seawater under real-world conditions, paving the way to eventual large-scale applications.									31	1	0	0	1	0	31			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000623591500008

However, what is the active site and how to promote the active species generation remain unclear and are still under debate. Here, the in situ synthesis of CoNi incorporated Fe3N nanotubes (CoNi-Fe3N) on the iron foil through the anodization/electrodeposition/nitridation process for use of boosted OER catalysis is reported. The synergistic CoNi doping induces the lattice expansion and up shifts the d-band center of Fe3N, which enhances the adsorption of hydroxyl groups from electrolyte during the OER catalysis, facilitating the generation of active CoNi-FeOOH on the Fe3N nanotube surface. As a result of this OER-conditioned surface reconstruction, the optimized catalyst requires an overpotential of only 285 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)with a Tafel slope of 34 mV dec(-1), outperforming commercial RuO(2)catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the Ni site in CoNi-FeOOH modulates the adsorption of OER intermediates and delivers a lower overpotential than those from Fe and Co sites, serving as the optimal active site for excellent OER performance.									20	2	0	0	0	0	21			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000561764000001	32830455

However, the traditional optimized designs for nanostructure are complicated, low-efficient and underperform for wide-scale applications. Herein, a novel hierarchical framework of hollow Ni/NiFe2O4-CNTs composite microsphere forcibly-assembled by zero-dimensional (0D) Ni/NiFe2O4 nanoparticle (< 16 nm) and one-dimensional (1D) self-supporting CNTs was fabricated successfully. Benefitted from the unique nanostructure, such monohybrids can achieve remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in alkaline media with a low overpotential and superior durability, which exceeds most of the commercial catalysts based on IrO2/RuO2 or other non-noble metal nanomaterials. The enhanced OER performance of Ni/NiFe2O4-CNTs composite is mainly ascribed to the increased catalytic activity and the optimized conductivity induced by the effects of strong hierarchical coupling and charge transfers between CNTs and Ni/NiFe2O4 nanoparticles. These effects are greatly boosted by the polarized heterojunction interfaces confirmed by electron holography. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicates the epitaxial Ni further enriches the intrinsic electrons contents of NiFe2O4 and thus accelerates absorption/desorption kinetics of OER intermediates. This work hereby paves a facile route to construct the hollow composite microsphere with excellent OER electrocatalytic activity based on non-noble metal oxide/CNTs.									28	3	0	0	1	0	28			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000519298200016

Particularly, Pt-based materials having heterostructures have shown excellent electrocatalytic performance. However, there are only few investigations on the transformation from an alloy to a heterostructure and the main reason for superior activity. Herein, we demonstrated that Pt-Ni heterostructures could be formed by only introducing NaOH in the synthesis of Pt-Ni alloys. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the added OH- can influence the energy barriers of atomic reduction and migration, thus driving the formation of a heterostructure with atomic segregation. Moreover, it was proved that the enhanced HER performance is attributed to favorable H and OH energetics arising from the atomic segregation. Acid treatment emphasized the key factors in determining the activity. This work proves that adding OH- can lead to the formation of nanocatalysts with atomic segregation, and tuning the atomic segregation of Pt-Ni catalysts is an effective way to optimize their H and OH adsorption abilities, thus enhancing the alkaline HER performance.									30	2	0	0	0	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463824300037

Herein, high OER activity is achieved using hollow meso-porous NiCo2O4 nanocages synthesized via a Cu2O-templated strategy combined with coordination reaction. The NiCo2O4 nanostructures with a hollow cavity, large roughness and high porosity show only a small overpotential of similar to 0.34 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 75 mV per decade, which is comparable with the performance of the best reported transition metal oxide based OER catalysts in the literature. Meanwhile, the positive impacts of the nanocage structure and the Ni incorporation on the electrocatalytic performance are also demonstrated by comparing the OER activities of NiCo2O4 nanocages with Co3O4 nanocages, NiCo2O4 nanoparticles and 20 wt% Pt/C. Moreover, the NiCo2O4 nanocages also manifest superior stability to other materials. All these merits indicate that the hollow mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanocages are promising electrocatalysts for water oxidation.									124	5	0	0	7	0	125			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000349993400030	25623183

Up to now, most attention has been focused on the ORR performance, but the disproportion of OER proficiencies results in poor cycling capabilities and energy waste during charging process. Herein, a dual-active site hierarchical composite (Co-NC@LDH) is constructed by anchoring high OER-active NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanosheets on the surface of ORR-active ZIF-derived carbon-based framework. This design fully utilizes their advantages and synergistic effects, such as good conductivity, hierarchical structure, ORR-active sites of Co, N-codoped carbon (Co-NC) substrate and OER-active sites of NiFe-LDH, to optimize bifunctional catalytic performance and durability in Zn-air batteries. The Co-NC@LDH demonstrates a lower overpotential of 819 mV than single component Co-NC (893 mV), NiFe-LDH (1178 mV) and noble-metal catalysts (957 mV for Pt/C and 1118 mV for RuO2) in alkaline media. Impressively, a high peak power density (107.8 mW cm-2) and excellent durability (over 300 h) are exhibited by Zn-air batteries based on Co-NC@LDH as electrocatalyst. This work provides a facile, low-cost and environmental-friendly strategy to synthesize bifunctional catalysts for efficient and durable zinc-air batteries.									52	4	0	0	4	0	51			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000561593400005

Cu-based catalysts have been attracting tremendous attention in gas-phase catalytic reactions, such as the water-gas shift, CO oxidation and NOx reduction reactions. In particular, the C-O bond hydrogenation reaction is an economical and environmentally friendly way to produce alcohols. However, the instability of Cu-based catalysts has become a great challenge for industrial application. The majority of publications discuss the instability of Cu-based catalysts for reactions involving the hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate, methyl acetate, furfural, or CO2 to alcohols. This review briefly summarizes the roots of Cu-based catalyst deactivation and introduces five strategies for improving their stability, as well as the evolution of copper species during preparation and reaction and a novel Cu-based catalyst technology.									66	10	0	0	2	1	71			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000438934700001

Electrocatalytic two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) are the source of electrochemical hydrogen peroxide generation. Various electrocatalysts have been used for the same and were characterized using several electroanalytical, chemical. spectroscopic and chromatographic tools. Though there have been a few reviews summarizing the recent developments in this field, none of them have unified the approaches in catalysts' design, criticized the ambiguities and flaws in the methods of evaluation, and emphasized the role of electrolyte engineering. Hence, we dedicated this review to discuss the recent trends in the catalysts' design, performance optimization, evaluation perspectives and their appropriateness and opportunities with electrolyte engineering. In addition, particularized discussions on fundamental oxygen electrochemistry, additional methods for precise screening, and the role of solution chemistry of synthesized hydrogen peroxide are also presented. Thus, this review discloses the state-of-the-art in an unpresented view highlighting the challenges, opportunities, and alternative perspectives. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wang, Jie; Wang, Gui-Chang								pubs.acs.org/JPCC Article Dynamic Evolution of Methane Oxidation on Pd-Based Catalysts: A Reactive Force Field Molecular Dynamics Study								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				126	33			14201	14210		10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c0484114201				AUG 25 2022	2022	Studying the dynamic evolution of the reaction process that identifies the key intermediate is important for elaborating the reaction mechanism, but it is still challenging from the point of view of the experiment. Methane oxidation over Pd-based catalysts including Pd (111) with different oxygen coverages and PdO (101) is studied by reactive force field molecular dynamic simulations in this work to explore the dynamic character of oxygen species like chemisorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen on the C-H bond activation and the C-O bond formation. The results show that methane oxidation on the Pd (111) surfaces is initiated by the direct dissociation of methane molecules (CH4 -> CH3 + H) rather than the oxygen-assisted dissociation (CH4 + O -> CH3 + OH), which is in agreement with the first-principle electronic structure calculation results. A comparison of methane oxidation at different oxygen coverages shows that the catalytic activity increases with the increase of oxygen pressure in general: There is no CO at low oxygen coverage and CO is formed at higher oxygen coverage up to 3/9 ML, but no CO2 is formed. This is because the C-O bond formation barrier is higher than the H- O bond formation barrier. Therefore, it is in favor of the formation of OH species instead of the CO2 formation for methane oxidation on metallic Pd. On the PdO (101) surface, we notice that the lattice oxygen species are more active compared to the chemisorbed oxygen species in both the activation of methane and the oxidation of CHx species due to its strong hydrogen affinity and high electron density, leading to high methane oxidation activity and ultimately CO2 formation. Importantly, a novel path for the CO2 formation via a dioxymethylene (H2COO) intermediate (CH2O + O -> H2COO) or a hydroxymethoxy (H2COOH) intermediate (CH2O + OH -> H2COOH) has been identified from our present reactive force field molecular dynamic simulations, which is generally ignored in the static electronic structure scheme like density functional theory. It is hoped that the present results would be a guide for the rational design of the methane oxidation catalysts by controlling the active phase of Pd (or Pt) or provide more essential knowledge for a better understanding of the methane oxidation or methane reformation reaction mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000848542100001		
J	Cai, Jingjing; Liu, Huijun; Luo, Yulin; Xiong, Yuqing; Zhang, Lizhu; Wang, Sheng; Xiao, Kang; Liu, Zhao-Qing								Single-phase bimetal sulfide or metal sulfide heterojunction: Which one is better for reversible oxygen electrocatalyst?								JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY				74				420	428		10.1016/j.jechem.2022.07.023				NOV 2022	2022	Bimetallic sulfides, integrating the merits of individual components, are ideal structures for efficient elec-trocatalysis. However, for bimetallic sulfides including metal sulfide heterojunctions (MSH) and single-phase bimetallic sulfides (SBS), it is still unclear about which one has better catalytic activity toward reversible oxygen catalysis and its difference on catalytic mechanism. In this work, we demonstrate a bimetallic sulfide electrocatalyst that could transform from metal sulfide heterojunction (CoS/FeS) to single-phase bimetallic sulfide (CoFeS2) through a facile temperature control strategy. The single-phase bimetallic sulfide (CoFeS2) affords high intrinsic activity, fast reaction kinetics and superior durability toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that the (CoFeS2) has homogeneous electron distribution of the CoFeS2 structure, improves the central energy level of d band, and optimizes the O* and OOH* intermediate and efficiently reduces the energy barrier of the reaction rate-determining step (RDS). The assembled rechargeable zinc -air battery is more stable than the Pt/C and IrO2 assemblies due to the excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability of CoFeS2/NC, suggesting that it has potential for use in practical applications.

This catalyst possesses a thin, porous and open layered structure, which makes the system more efficient and accessible for a better electrochemical water oxidation reaction. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrated that incorporation of Zn via a single-step solvothermal method provides an easy approach to obtain plenty of exposed gamma -NiOOH phases to make the system more viable for OER with a small overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 44 mV per decade. In addition to this, the oxophilic nature of Zn in the (Zn) Ni-LDH/N-rGO catalyst helps to improve the long-term stability of the whole system. The obtained results open up possibilities for the design of future robust OER electrocatalysts by the use of very cheap and abundant materials like Ni and Zn in place of expensive Ir and Ru in the present commercial electrocatalysts.									45	3	0	0	2	0	45			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000409215300043	28820209

The materials were characterized by structural, morphological, and electrochemical techniques. The oxides with higher Co : Mn molar ratio presented a lower electron transfer resistance, and consequently the most promising OER activities. Pure Co3O4 shows an overpotential at j = 10 mA cm(-2) of 761, 490, and 240 mV, at pH 1, 7, and 14, respectively, and a high TOF of 1.01 x 10(-1) s(-1) at pH 14. Tafel slopes around 120 mV dec(-1) at acidic pH and around 60 mV dec(-1) at alkaline pH indicate different OER mechanisms. High stability for Co3O4 was achieved for up to 15 h in all pHs, and no change in the structure and morphology after the electrocatalysis was observed. The reported excellent OER activity of the Mn-Co oxides in a wide pH range is important to broaden the practical applicability in different electrolyte solutions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000858538200001	36320853

Electrochemical measurements show that cobalt modified NiFe LDH possesses an enhanced activity for the OER relative to pristine NiFe LDH. The Co-modified NiFe LDH exhibits overpotentials in the range of 290-322 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)), depending on the degree of cobalt content. The best catalyst, cobalt intercalated NiFe LDH achieved a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of,similar to 265 mV (compared to 310 mV for NiFe LDH), with a near unity (99%) faradaic efficiency and long-term stability. Density functional theory calculations revealed that enhanced activity of Co-modified NiFe LDH could be attributed to the ability of Co to tune the electronic structure of the NiFe LDH so that optimal binding of OER reaction intermediates could be achieved.									64	4	0	0	8	0	64			1520-6106			WOS:000423140600056	28880559

Here, we proposed a facile strategy to construct in situ a novel hierarchical heterostructure composed of 0D-2D CoSe2/MoSe2 by the selenization of CoMoO4 nanosheets grafted on a carbon cloth (CC). In such integrated structure, CoSe2 nanoparticles dispersed well and tightly bonded with MoSe2 nanosheets, which can not only enhance kinetics due to the synergetic effects, thus promoting the electrocatalytic activity, but also effectively improve the structural stability. Benefiting from its unique architecture, the designed CoSe2/MoSe2 catalyst exhibits superior OER and HER performance. Specifically, a small overpotential of 280 mV is acquired at a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) for OER with a small Tafel slope of 86.8 mV center dot dec(-1), and the overpotential is 90 mV at a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) for HER with a Tafel slope of 84.8 mV center dot dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. Furthermore, the symmetrical electrolyzer assembled with the CoSe2/MoSe2 catalysts depicts a small cell voltage of 1.63 V at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) toward overall water splitting.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2296-2646			WOS:000538426500001	32509725

A CoN4-ZnN4/C catalyst composed of adjacent Co and Zn sites anchoredon nitrogen-doped graphene was predicted by first-principle calculations to exhibitpromising bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions with an overpotential of 0.225 and 0.264 V, respectively, which is superior toCoN4/C catalysts and outperforms commercial Pt/C and IrO2benchmarks. Theimpressive catalytic activity originates from the remarkable asymmetric deformation and strong pseudo-Jahn-Teller vibronic coupling effect, through which the Zn siteacts as a modulator to induce the symmetry-breaking phenomenon and tune the d-band structure and binding strength between key intermediates and the Co site.

However, owing to the high overpotential and sluggish kinetics of the OER, an efficient electrocatalyst is necessary to lower the overpotential and accelerate the reaction. In this paper, we report a cobalt phosphide (CoP)/carbon dots (CDs) composite as an electrocatalyst for the OER for the first time. A facile two-step method was used to synthesize the CoP/CDs composite and the concentration of CDs in the composite was further regulated. The experimental results show that when the amount of CDs in the composite is 6 mg (28.79 wt%C), the obtained CoP/CDs composite exhibits optimal electrocatalytic activity (with an overpotential of 400 mV in 1 M KOH at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and high stability towards the OER. The good electrocatalytic activity of the composite is attributed to the small size of CoP and CDs and rapid electron transfer of CDs.									41	1	0	0	1	0	41			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000430328100040	29595849

The catalyst has exhibited extremely high electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline solution with an overpotential of 0.21 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to the current record (approximate to 0.20 V in Fe-Co-Ni metal-oxide-film system) and superior to all other non-noble metal catalysts. Also, it possesses outstanding kinetics (Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1)) for the reaction. Interestingly, the NiFe LDH-NS@DG10 hybrid has also exhibited the high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in an alkaline solution (with an overpotential of 115 mV by 2 mg cm(-2) loading at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2)) in contrast to barely HER activity for NiFe LDH-NS itself. As a result, the bifunctional catalyst the authors developed can achieve a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) by a voltage of only 1.5 V, which is also a record for the overall water splitting. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the synergetic effects of highly exposed 3d transition metal atoms and carbon defects are essential for the bifunctional activity for OER and HER.									715	51	0	0	26	0	721			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000400344800033	28256771

The electrocatalytic activities for both reactions were observed to depend strongly oil the Mn content in CuCo2O4. An opposite trend was observed for the apparent and intrinsic electrocatalytic activities for the ORR the simultaneous presence of Cu and Mn was found to be detrimental to the intrinsic charge density, but beneficial to the geometric charge density with a maximum for Mn0.6Cu0.4Co2O4. The latter was characterized by the highest total number of electrons exchanged per O-2 molecule, n, close to 4, greater k(1) (4e(-) process)/k(2) (2e(-) process) ratios, and by a unique and low Tafel slope (-41 mV dec(-1)). The results obtained for the OER showed that the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity is determined by the number of active sites (Co4+) electrochemically formed at the oxide surface prior to the OER. from Co3+ cations. The partial substitution of Cu by Mn in CuCo2O4 was found to decrease the OER activity. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This article reports the recent findings in the performance enhancement of R-PCECs using a novel heterostructured air electrode, consisting of a double perovskite PrBaCo1.6Fe0.2Nb0.2O5+delta backbone covered with in situ exsolved nanoparticles of Nb-deficient PrBaCo1.6Fe0.2Nb0.2-xO5+delta.

Scalable, highly stable Si-based metal-insulator-semiconductor photoanodes for water oxidation fabricated using thin-film reactions and electrodeposition								NATURE COMMUNICATIONS				12	1					3982	10.1038/s41467-021-24229-y				JUN 25 2021	2021	Metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structures are widely used in Si-based solar water-splitting photoelectrodes to protect the Si layer from corrosion. Typically, there is a tradeoff between efficiency and stability when optimizing insulator thickness. Moreover, lithographic patterning is often required for fabricating MIS photoelectrodes. In this study, we demonstrate improved Si-based MIS photoanodes with thick insulating layers fabricated using thin-film reactions to create localized conduction paths through the insulator and electrodeposition to form metal catalyst islands. These fabrication approaches are low-cost and highly scalable, and yield MIS photoanodes with low onset potential, high saturation current density, and excellent stability. By combining this approach with a p(+)n-Si buried junction, further improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is achieved with an onset potential of 0.7 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and saturation current density of 32 mA/cm(2) under simulated AM1.5G illumination. Moreover, in stability testing in 1 M KOH aqueous solution, a constant photocurrent density of similar to 22 mA/cm(2) is maintained at 1.3 V versus RHE for 7 days.									8	0	0	0	0	0	7			2041-1723			WOS:000687320200031	34172754

The Mn K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) of the 1/MK10 hybrid suggested that the oxidation state of the di-mu-oxo Mn-2 core could be Mn-III-Mn-IV. However the pre-edge peak in the XANES spectrum of 1 adsorbed on MK10 is different from the neat 1 powder. The kinetic analysis of O-2 evolution showed that the catalysis requires cooperation of two equivalents of 1 adsorbed on MK10. The reaction of the [(bpy)(2)Mn(mu-O)(2)Mn(bpy)(2)](3+) (bpy=2,2'-bipyridine) (2)/MK10 hybrid with a Ce-IV oxidant evolved O-2. However, the turnover number value was less than unity for 2/MK10, showing that 2 adsorbed on MK10 does not work as a catalyst. The terminal water ligands could be an important for the catalysis by adsorbed 1.

Herein, we prepare an electrocatalyst of ultra-small Ru nanoparticles embedded on Fe-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets in situ grown on a Ni foam (RuFe@NF) by a one-pot room temperature immersion method. The RuFe@NF only needs an overpotential of 28 mV to attain 10 mA cm(-2) towards the HER and an overpotential of 265 mV to deliver 50 mA cm(-2) for the OER in 1 M KOH solution. When RuFe@NF is used as both the cathode and anode for an overall water splitting electrolytic cell, it exhibits a relatively low cell voltage of 1.54 V to obtain 10 mA cm(-2). Impressively, the RuFe@NF based electrolytic cell exhibits ultra-long stability over 680 hours at 10 mA cm(-2) and even at larger current density up to 100 mA cm(-2), which is obviously superior to the noble "Pt/C||IrO2" couple (i.e., 180 mV voltage increase at 50 mA cm(-2) after 36 h), ranking the top among the water splitting catalysts previously reported thus far. The integrated electrode possesses different highly active HER and OER sites and a robust in situ network structure, which collectively improves the electron transport and therefore achieves high activity and stability of the RuFe@NF at an elevated current density. This work offers an alternative bifunctional electrocatalyst, which can be widely extended to large-scale water splitting technology.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000753078400001

The obtained catalyst exhibits robust HER, HOR, andORR performance. For the HER, amuch low overpotential of 8mV is required to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) compared with Pt/C (22 mV). For the HOR, its mass activity (MA) at an overpotential of 40 mV is 2.3-fold over that of the Pt/C catalyst. Interestingly, PtP2@ PNC also shows exceptional ORR MA which is 2.6 times higher than that of Pt/C and has robust stability in alkaline solutions. Undoubtedly, this work reveals that PtP2@PNC can be employed as nanocatalysts with an impressive catalytic activity and stability for broad applications in electrocatalysis.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19				2589-0042		WOS:000600670000039	33294800

The recently proposed light-assisted strategy is an effective way to improve round-trip efficiency; however, the high-potential photogenerated holes during the charge would degrade the electrolyte with side reactions and poor cycling performance. Herein, a synergistic interaction between a polyterthiophene photocatalyst and a redox mediator is employed in Li-O-2 batteries. During the discharge, the voltage can be compensated by the photovoltage generated on the photoelectrode. Upon the charge with illumination, the photogenerated holes can be consumed by the oxidization of iodide ions, and thus the external circuit voltage is compensated by photogenerated electrons. Accordingly, a smaller bias voltage is needed for the semiconductor to decompose Li2O2, and the potential of photogenerated holes decreases. Finally, the round-trip efficiency of the battery reaches 97% with a discharge voltage of 3.10 V and a charge voltage of 3.19 V. The batteries show stable operation up to 150 cycles without increased polarization. This work provides new routes for light-assisted Li-O-2 batteries with reduced overpotential and boosted efficiency.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000808179900001	35678600

Here, we developed a novel 3D hybrid electrocatalyst consisting of core- shell structured CoS2/ CoS2 embedded into N- doped carbon supported on electrochemically exfoliated graphene foil (EG/ CoS2/ CoS2- NC) by sulfurization treatment of EG/ Co(OH) 2/ zeolitic imidazolate framework- 67 (ZIF- 67) as precursor. The thickness of the CoS2- NC shell derived from ZIF- 67 is 10 nm and the CoS2 core generated from Co(OH) 2 nanosheet arrays has a particle size of 20 nm. Benefiting from the unique 3D core- shell structure and synergistic effects, the EG/ CoS2/ CoS2- NC hybrid enormously promotes electrocatalytic OER activity with a low overpotential of 210 mV at a current density of 10 mAcm 2 and a small Tafel slope of 61.9 mVdec 1. These values are far superior compared to the commercial Ir/ C catalyst, and even better than other reported state- of- the- art CoS2- based materials. In- situ Raman spectroscopy together with ex- situ XRD patterns reveal that the active centers of EG/ CoS2/ CoS2- NC hybrid are proven to be Co- OOH species that are derived from Co S groups during the OER process. The superb catalytic performance is also reflected in boosting electrochemical urea oxidation and hydrazine oxidation, where the accelerated oxidation reaction could be observed.									17	2	0	0	0	0	18				2566-6223		WOS:000477087800007

Numerous techniques have been developed in last three decades to enhance the efficiency of the catalyst systems, control over the composition, structure, surface area, pore size, and moreover morphology of the particles. In this respect, metal organic framework (MOF) derived catalysts are emerged as the finest materials with tunable properties and activities for the energy conversion and storage. Recently, several nano- or microstructures of metal oxides, chalcogenides, phosphides, nitrides, carbides, alloys, carbon materials, or their hybrids are explored for the electrochemical energy conversion like oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction, or battery materials. Interest on the efficient energy storage system is also growing looking at the practical applications. Though, several reviews are available on the synthesis and application of MOF and MOF derived materials, their applications for the electrochemical energy conversion and storage is totally a new field of research and developed recently. This review focuses on the systematic design of the materials from MOF and control over their inherent properties to enhance the electrochemical performances.									251	14	0	0	16	0	253			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000445327500001	29984451

They are semiconductors with indirect band gaps of 1.25, 0.78, and 1.32 eV, respectively, and exhibit ultrahigh carrier mobilities of up to 9455 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). Band edges enclosing the redox potentials of water enable photocatalytic water splitting. Importantly, the large intrinsic electric fields of the Janus structures facilitate the migration of photo-generated carriers, which enhances the carrier utilization and, therefore, the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. The obtained efficiencies of 30.1% for Pd4S3Se3, 38.6% for Pd4S3Te3, and 23.8% for Pd4Se3Te3 surpass the conventional theoretical limit of 18%. In addition, the materials are predicted to catalyze the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. Application potential is identified in electronics, optoelectronics, and photocatalytic water splitting.									24	0	0	0	1	0	24			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000661521800025

However, rational design and construction of SACs active sites remain enormously challenging due to the superficial understanding of their structure-function relationship. In this contribution, we provide new insight into the link between the catalytic effects of catalysts and the detailed nucleation/delithiation mechanisms of Li2O2 during the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER). Here, a CuN2C2 SACs electrocatalyst is tailored for LOBs by a confined self-initiated dispersing strategy. The exposed Cu-N-2 moieties as the driving force centers can promote the formation of micron-sized flower-shaped lithium peroxide and further accelerate the decomposition kinetics of lithium peroxide via a one-electron transfer way in turn. Under the catalysis of CuN2C2 SACs, the LOB can operate with low discharge/charge polarization and long-term cycle stability. These encouraging results provide guidance to future design and activity promotion of efficient catalysts for LOBs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000731486700003

NiCo2O4 spinel, synthesized via direct impregnation on carbon nanofibers or nickel powder and characterized by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction experiments, shows high activity toward oxygen evolution reaction with low charge potentials of < 2.0 V vs. Zn/Zn2+. La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 perovskite exhibits bifunctional activity and outperforms the NiCo2O4 spinel in long-term stability tenfold. By combining the catalysts in one bi-catalyzed bifunctional air electrode, stable performances of more than 1000 h and 450 cycles are achieved when supplied with oxygen and over 650 h and 300 cycles when supplied with synthetic air. In addition, the pulse charging method, which is beneficial for compact zinc deposition, is successfully tested on air electrodes during long-term operation. The oxygen evolution potentials during pulse, i.e. at tripled charge current density of 150 mA cm(-2), are only 0.06-0.08 V higher compared to constant charging current densities. Scanning electron microscopy confirms that mechanical degradation caused by bubble formation during oxygen evolution results in slowly decreasing discharge potentials. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Heteroatoms doping and structure defects creation in graphene matrix could enhance the electrocatalytic activity effectively. In this work, a nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene is synthesized and then activated by KOH to involve a porous structure. The atomic ratios of doped heteroatoms are found increased surprisingly. This should be due to the better thermal stability of doped heteroatoms compared with the origin carbon atoms. More carbon atoms will be removed, thus leading to the increased heteroatoms doping percentages. The increased surface area, larger heteroatoms ratios, and abundant structure defects result in the improved catalytic activity towards electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The overpotential for OER could achieve as early as 281 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA.cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, better than most of the metal free catalysts. The obtained sample is active over a wide pH range in electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), thus could be used as bifunctional materials for water splitting. This work provides a simple and low-cost approach to increase the ratios of doped heteroatoms, and thus should have great potential both for carbon materials synthesis and hydrogen production.

Quantitation of PSI by photooxidation of P-700 and chromatographic assay of vitamin K-1 showed that, on the basis of chlorophyll, the mutants have higher concentrations of PSI than the wildtype rice, Greater increases were observed in the PSII contents measured by photoreduction of Q(A), binding of a radioactive herbicide and atomic absorption spectroscopy of Mn. Consequently, the PSII to PSI ratio increased from 1.1-1.3 in the wild-type rice to 1.8 in chlorina 2, which contains no Chi b, and to 2.0-3.3 in chlorina 11 and chlorina 14, which have chlorophyll a/b ratios of 9 and 13, respectively. Measurement of oxygen evolution with saturating single-turnover flashes revealed that, whereas at most 20% of PSII centers are inactive in oxygen evolution in the wildtype rice, the non-functional PSII centers amount to about 50% in the three mutant strains, The fluorescence induction kinetics was also analyzed to estimate proportions of the inactive PSII in the mutants. The data obtained suggest that plants have an ability to adjust the stoichiometry of the two photosystems and the functional organization of PSII in response to the genetically induced deficiency of chlorophyll b.									17	0	0	0	16	0	17			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:A1996UJ28900009

In this regard, meticulous design of active sites and probing their catalytic mechanism on both cathode and anode with different reaction environment at molecular-scale are vitally necessary. Herein, a coordination environment inheriting strategy is presented for designing low-coordination Ni(2+)octahedra (L-Ni-8) atomic interface at a high concentration (4.6 at.%). Advanced spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-matching electron delocalization and localization state at L-Ni-8 atomic interface enable an ideal reaction environment at both cathode and anode. To improve the efficiency of using the self-modification reaction environment at L-Ni-8, all of the structural features, including high atom economy, mass transfer, and electron transfer, are integrated together from atomic-scale to macro-scale. At high current density of 500 mA/cm(2), the samples synthesized at gram-scale can deliver low hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials of 262 and 348 mV, respectively.									23	7	0	0	0	0	22			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000555721200004

Herein, we reported a feasible strategy for preparing a trimetallic (NiCoFe) superior electrocatalyst with a novel open-cage/3D frame-like structure for an oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is prepared by consequent thermal treatments of a CoFe Prussian blue analogue frame/cage-like structure under an argon (CoFeA-TT) atmosphere and then electrochemical deposition of nickel-cobalt sulfide nanosheets as a shell layer on it. The electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the deposition of NiCo-S on CoFeA-TT (NiCo-S@CoFeA-TT) has the best catalytic performance and can drive the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 268 mV with a Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1) and an excellent long-term catalytic stability in an alkaline medium. Its outstanding electrocatalytic performances are endowed from frame/cage-like structures, highly exposed active sites, accelerated mass and electron transport, and the synergistic effect of multiple hybrid components. The NiCo-S@CoFeA-TT showed a better performance than most advanced nonprecious catalysts and the noble commercial RuO2 catalyst.

Electrochemical results reveal that the electrocatalyst prepared by pyrolysis at 1000 degrees C (CoNC-CNF-1000) exhibits excellent catalytic activity toward ORR that favors the four-electron ORR process and outstanding long-term stability with 86% current retention after 40 000 s. Meanwhile, it also shows superior electrocatalytic activity toward OER, reaching a lower potential of 1.68 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a potential gap of 0.88 V between the OER potential (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and the ORR half-wave potential. The ORR and OER performance of CoNC-CNF-1000 have outperformed commercial Pt/C and most nonprecious-metal catalysts reported to date. The remarkable ORR and OER catalytic performance can be mainly attributable to the unique 1D structure, such as higher graphitization degree beneficial for electronic mobility, hierarchical porosity facilitating the mass transport, and highly dispersed CoNxC active sites functionalized carbon framework. This strategy will shed light on the development of other MOF-based carbon nanofibers for energy storage and electrochemical devices.									211	9	0	0	10	0	213			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000436238500006	29741813

On the other hand, the sluggish water oxidation kinetics of BiVO4 photoanodes when used individually make it necessary to use a hole blocking layer as well as water oxidation catalysts to overcome the high kinetic barrier for the PEC water oxidation reaction. Here, we describe a very simple synthetic strategy to fabricate nanocomposite photoanodes that synergistically address both of these critical limitations. In particular, we examine the effect of a SnO2 buffer layer over BiVO4 films and further modify the photoanode surface with a crystalline nickel tungstate (NiWO4) nanoparticle film to boost PEC water oxidation. When NiWO4 is incorporated over BiVO4/SnO2 films, the PEC performance of the resultant triple-layer NiWO4/BiVO4/SnO2 films for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is further improved. The enhanced performance for the PEC OER is credited to the synergetic effect of the individual layers and the introduction of a SnO2 buffer layer over the BiVO4 film. The optimized NiWO4/BiVO4/SnO2 electrode demonstrated both enriched visible light absorption and achieves charge separation and transfer efficiencies of 23% and 30%, respectively. The photoanodic current density for the OER on optimized NiWO4/BiVO4/SnO2 photoanode shows a maximum photocurrent of 0.93 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE in a phosphate buffer solution (pH similar to 7.5) under an AM1.5G solar simulator, which is an incredible five-fold and two-fold enhancement compared to its parent BiVO4 photoanode and BiVO4/SnO2 photoanodes, respectively.

Herein, we have synthesized an electrode-posited cobalt hydroxide on nickel foam and subsequently annealed in an air atmosphere at 400 degrees C for 2 h. In-depth characterization of all the films using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron emission spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) techniques, which reveals major changes for their structural, morphological, compositional and electrochemical properties, respectively. The cobalt hydroxide nanosheet film shows high catalytic activity with 290 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) and 91 mV dec(-1) Tafel slope and robust stability (24 h) for OER in 1 M KOH electrolyte compared to cobalt oxide (340 mV). The better OER activity of cobalt hydroxide in comparison to cobalt oxide originated from high active sites, enhanced surface, and charge transport capability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, a unique metal-organic-framework-based pine-needle-like nanocluster hierarchical architecture has been rationally designed and prepared on a nickel foam skeleton via a simple solvothermal method based on the Co(OH)F intermediate and directly adopted as an optimum bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The Co-MOF/NF exhibited enhanced catalytic performance for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The optimized catalyst reveals the highest electrocatalytic characteristics, affording current densities of 50 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 266 mV for the OER and 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 115 mV forthe HER in 1 M KOH. Meanwhile, the catalyst exhibits an ultrastability in the OER process and long-term test at 20 mA cm(-2) for 100 h led to only a 9.4% increase in overpotential. Furthermore, an electrolytic cell assembled from the bifunctional Co-MOF/NF delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.548 V. This excellent performance is believed to be the result of the exotic pine-needle-like nanocluster structure with effective accessibility of dense catalytically active sites, as well as the high specific surface area and the promotion of reversible chemisorption for oxygen species due to the linkers interacting with Co ions. Further SEM, TEM, and XPS analyses of the catalyst after OER stability tests reveal that the formation of Co3O4 on the surface and unconsolidated architecture within the electrode materials are responsible for the high catalytic activity. This work extends the applications of MOFs in the field of electrocatalysis.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000630142600057	33666413

Herein, for the first time, self-assembled heterogeneous CoFe-Co8FeS8 nanoparticles embedded in CNT networks (CoFe/Co8FeS8/CNT) are synthesized via a facile microwave-assisted sulfidation and annealing process. Compared to CoFe/CNT or Co8FeS8/CNT, the CoFe/Co8FeS8/CNT delivers much better performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER): it shows an Ultralow Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1); it affords a large current density of 10 mA cm(-2) only requiring a small overpotential of 290 mV; in addition, it demonstrates good long-term stability. The outstanding OER performance of CoFe/Co8FeS8/CNT is attributed to its unique porous nanoarchitecture constructed by heterogeneous CoFe-Co8FeS8 nanoparticles homogenously embedded in highly conductive CNT networks, which can not only enable full utilization of electrocatalytic active sites and provide conductive pathways for efficient charge transfer between nanoparticles and CNT, but also accelerate gas bubbles evolving and releasing. This work provides insight into microwave-assisted synthesis of highly efficient non-precious transition metal sulfide based electrocatalysts with rationally designed nanoarchitecture for OER.									65	6	0	0	3	0	65			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000480670200012

The role of NiCoO2 in the composite electrode (BiVO4/NiCoO2) is twofold: OER cocatalyst and band structure modifier. It improves surface reaction kinetics for PEC OER and enhances charge separation efficiency simultaneously, which is believed to be a determining factor for the unprecedentedly high PEC OER performance of this BiVO4/NiCoO2 nanocomposite. The photocurrent density of 3.6 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus RHE in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffered (pH = 7) electrolyte by BiVO4/NiCoO2 is three times that of BiVO4 and significantly higher than most literature values. The BiVO4/NiCoO2 nanocomposite shows/possess a high charge separation efficiency ((surface)) of approximate to 72% as compared to only 23% for pure nanoporous BiVO4 at 1.23 V versus RHE, which demonstrates convincing role of NiCoO2 in the composite electrode. Both the excellent photocurrent density and great operational stability of this BiVO4/NiCoO2 nanocomposite makes it a promising photocatalytic material for practical applications.									73	3	0	0	5	0	73			2196-7350			WOS:000412603100011

The well-aligned and nanoporous identity of the desirable hybrid Mo2C/NPCNFs by an electrospun approach provides the good conductivity and rich active sites addressing excellent HER catalytic performance with an onset potential of -85 mV, a Tafel slope of 68 mV dec(-1), and an exchange current density of 0.178 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4. It is noting that the Mo2C/NPCNFs also shows remarkable ORR catalytic activity with an onset potential of similar to 0.9 V, a half-potential of similar to 0.77 V and a Tafel slope of 60.2 mV dec(-1) at 1600 rpm in 0.1 M KOH. In addition, the experimental results demonstrate the core-shell 1D nanostructures boost the Mo2C/NPCNFs' stability of the durable catalytic activity over 10 h for both HER and ORR.

The pc-NiFe-LDH can spontaneously grow in situ on the Ni foams (NF) at room temperature and does not consume any extra energy. The 3D structure of the pc-NiFe-LDH/NF with more active sites was confirmed by SEM, TEM and the calculated large electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of 118 cm(2), which endowed the pc-NiFe-LDH/NF with an outstanding OER performance in 1.0 M KOH. The overpotentials of 133 mV and 153 mV (vs. RHE, with 95% iR compensation) at the current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2) were obtained, respectively. The pc-NiFe-LDH/NF showed rapid OER kinetics and efficient mass and electron transfer with a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec(-1), and excellent endurance for 17 h long-term continuous OER operation at 1.609 V (vs. RHE, without iR correction) with 2.6% enhancement of the current density. The performance was superior to those of most reported NiFe-based catalysts, which made it grand feasibility in practical industrial applications. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Non-noble-metal catalysts with high activity, stability, but low cost are prerequisites for practical application. In this work, sucrose char was synthesized and then chainmail catalysts were produced by in situ growth method, defined as M@C (M = Fe, Co and FeCo). FeCo@C showed great OER performance in both catalytic activity and durability tests. The overpotentials were 302 mV (at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and 423 mV (at 50 mA cm(-2)), with a lowest Tafel slope of 75 mV dec(-1). The electrochemical surface area of catalysts were also analyzed by calculating the capacitance of the double layer to further investigate the catalytic activity. Furthermore, FeCo@C showed superior stability after 30 h test or 10,000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry. Theoretical calculation based on density functional theory (DFT) demonstrated that the overpotential of OER was determined by the Gibbs free energies of reaction intermediates HO*, O* and HOO*. The adsorption of HO* radicals onto the FeCo@C was weaker than Fe@C, which was favorable for reducing the overpotential, as the rate-determining step of the OER process over these catalysts was that HO* dehydrogenated to form O*.

In this study, a reduced graphene oxide-Co3O4 yolk-shell nanocage (rGO-Co3O4 YSNC) composite material is prepared through a facile precipitation reaction with subsequent calcination and hydrothermal treatment. A strong chemical interaction formed between Co3O4 YSNCs and r-GO nanosheets is vital to produce a well wrapped composite material. This specific composite structure combines the high conductivity of r-GO together with the promising catalytic properties of the highly porous Co3O4 YSNCs, therefore the enhanced OER activity and stability is realized. The Tafel slope, current density at an overpotential of 450 mV and the overpotential at 10.0 mA cm(-2) for the rGO-Co3O4 YSNC composite electrode are 84.9 mV dec(-1), 19.9 mA cm(-2) and 410 mV, respectively. Moreover, the composite electrode exhibits 2.8% attenuation of the current density after the 500th cyclic voltammetry test. These results are comparable to the currently reported high-performance OER catalysts, which prove that the rGO-Co3O4 YSNC composite material is a potential catalyst for oxygen evolution reactions.									100	1	0	0	4	0	101			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000382656500022

Herein, we report a powerful combined wet chemical method to fabricate a novel binder-free NiFe layered double hydroxide@Ni3S2 (NiFe LDH@Ni3S2) heterostructure as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The hydrothermal-synthesized NiFe LDH nanosheets are uniformly coated on the Ni3S2 nanosheet skeleton forming 3D porous heterostructure arrays. By virtue of its synergistic advantages, including its binder-free characteristics, increased catalysis sites and structural stability, the as-obtained NiFe LDH@Ni3S2/NF electrode exhibits low overpotentials of 184 and 271 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER in 1 M KOH, respectively. Notably, a low operation potential of 1.74 V at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) is achieved for overall water splitting with a stable cycling life. In addition, the intimate composite structure and sensitive interface of NiFe LDH@Ni3S2 are responsible for the good electrocatalytic activity with a low Tafel slope, fast reaction kinetics and high stability. The versatile fabrication protocol and heterostructure interface engineering provide a new way to construct other bifunctional and cost-effective electrocatalysts for electrocatalysis.									30	3	0	0	1	0	30			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000487729300001	31430739

The electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.1 M KOH was studied using a rotating disk electrode. Lead and bismuth ruthenate pyrochlores showed significantly lower overpotentials for the OER than the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst. Specific activities (at 1.5 V vs. RHE) of 3.0 +/- 0.2 A m(-2), 1.3 +/- 0.2 A m(-2) and 0.06 +/- 0.01 A m(-2) were obtained for Pb2Ru2O6.5, Bi2.4Ru1.6O7, and IrO2 respectively. Specific activities for iridate-based pyrochlores (0.3-0.5 A m(-2)) were 5-10 times lower than those for ruthenate-based pyrochlores. Lead osmate pyrochlore showed the lowest OER activity among all the pyrochlores evaluated, with a specific activity of 0.10 +/- 0.07 A m(-2). It is proposed that the reaction path for the OER involves several oxygen intermediate species (-O2-, -OOH, -OO2(-), -OH) bonded to the B-site (Ru, Ir or Os) in the pyrochlore, and that the catalytic activity depends on the bonding strength between the B-cation site and the oxygen species. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that OER activity correlated with Ru concentration in lead-rich lead ruthenate pyrochlores. The decrease of the specific OER activity depended on the occupancy of the 3d orbitals and on the period in the periodic table occupied by the B-cation. The OER activity decreased for pyrochlores with B cations having more d electrons than Ru, and when the B cation occupied period 6. The observed trend in activity was similar to that observed for the oxygen reduction reaction on transition metals, and was related to the strength of the bonding between the adsorbed oxygen species and the B-cation. The exceptional OER activity and stability of lead ruthenate pyrochlore catalysts were evaluated in a solid-state alkaline water electrolyzer. The overpotentials obtained were 0.1-0.2 V lower than for IrO2 and the performance was stable for at least 200 h.									79	1	0	0	7	0	80			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000354395400026

Herein, using a facile hydrothermal reaction and low-temperature calcination process, we synthesize ultrathin carbon coated, nitrogen and iron modified cobalt carbonate hydroxide needle arrays on carbon cloth (C@NFeCoCH/CC). The synergistic effect of Fe and N modification induces high OER activity of C@NFeCoCH/CC and a conversion of rate determining step for OER, which mainly benefits from highly active Co/Fe-N-C species in situ formed on the interface of carbon layer and needles. Thin carbon layer, N and Fe modification, along with continuous conductive carbon cloth guarantee fast and stable charge transfer from bulk of free-standing porous catalyst film to its interface. It is found that the optimized C@NFe1Co1CH/CC exhibits a low overpotential of 235 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a mass activity of 681.4 A g(-1) and a superior stability over 30 hat 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the Co/Fe sites possess higher OER activity than the N-C sites, while the Co/Fe-N (-C) sites can obviously outperform the Co/Fe-O sites.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000517663800025

The catalyst has a noticeably improved OER performance of the nanocarbon in acid solution. The resilience of the catalyst in acid solution is due to the greater protection of the nitrogen-containing OER active sites in a graphitic shell. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid solution is very challenging for metal-free catalysts based only on heteroatom-doped carbon nanomaterials which have thus far shown relatively low catalytic activity and poor stability.

The catalyst prepared as such has a noticeably improved OER performance of the nanocarbon in acid solution (1.70 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) in comparison with the few metal-free OER electrocatalysts reported to date.

However, how to increase the specific activity area and improve their poor intrinsic conductivity is still challenging, which significantly limits the overall OER rate and largely prevent their utilization. Thus, developing effective OER electrocatalysts with abundant active sites and high electrical conductivity still remains urgent. In this work, a scrupulous design of OER electrode with a unique sandwich-like coaxial structure of the three-dimensional Ni@[Ni(2+/3+)Co2(OH)(6-7)](x) nanotube arrays (3D NNCNTAs) is reported. A Ni nanotube array with open end is homogeneous coated with Ni and Co co-hydroxide nanosheets ([Ni(2+/3+)Co2(OH)(6-7)](x)) and is employed as multifunctional interlayer to provide a large surface area and fast electron transport and support the outermost [Ni(2+/3+)Co2(OH)(6-7)](x) layer. The remarkable features of high surface area, enhanced electron transport, and synergistic effects have greatly assured excellent OER activity with a small overpotential of 0.46 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and high stability.									315	10	0	0	8	0	321			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000340461400015

Overproduction and accumulation of ROS results in metabolic disorders and can lead to the oxidative destruction of the cell. Several stress factors cause ROS overproduction and trigger oxidative stress in crops and weeds. Recently, the involvement of the antioxidant system in weed interference and herbicide treatment in crops and weeds has been the subject of investigation. In this review, we address ROS production and plant mechanisms of defense, alterations in the antioxidant system at transcriptional and enzymatic levels in crops induced by weed interference, and herbicide exposure in crops and weeds. We also describe the mechanisms of action in herbicides that lead to ROS generation in target plants. Lastly, we discuss the relations between antioxidant systems and weed biology and evolution, as well as the interactive effects of herbicide treatment on these factors.									50	0	0	0	36	0	52				1422-0067		WOS:000462542300085	30832379

As a semi-reaction in the electrochemical reaction of water splitting, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has limited the development and practical application of water electrolysis technology due to its slow kinetic speed and high overpotential. Through different doping options, defect engineering, and interface coupling effects, the activity of the catalyst can be improved. By using low-priced transition metals, composites such as iron-based, cobalt-based and nickel-based phosphorus-doped or nitrogen-sulfur doped composite materials are designed and synthesized to achieve large overpotentials and current densities, thus the performance could be improved. In this work, the synthesis of Ni2P/rGO nano-hybrids by phosphating Ni(OH)(2)/rGO precursors at low temperature was investigated. It is worth noting that the synthesized Ni2P/rGO hybrid can be used as an OER catalyst under alkaline conditions and remains active for more than 12 h. It has an initial potential at 221 mV and the Tafel slope is 105.7 mV/dec. Present research works provide new ideas for the preparation of alternative precious metal electrocatalysts used for OER.									31	0	0	0	2	0	31			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000615368500001

Cerium (Ce) anomaly in marine sediments has been used to distinguish oxic versus anoxic depositional environments in the Paleo-ocean. Previous studies suggested that dissolved oxygen is indispensable to cerium oxidation. Therefore, this reaction can be thermodynamically modeled to quantify oxygen contents in the ocean. This study presents a series of thermodynamics-based models to relate Ce anomaly to dissolved oxygen level. We then evaluated these models in two representatively settings, including an oxic ocean and anoxic basin. Finally, we examined the modeled relationship on a compiled dataset of cerium anomaly and dissolved oceanic oxygen content. These models suggest that the cerium anomaly is quantitatively related to oceanic oxygen, pH, and phosphate concentration. Notably, the results suggest that cerium anomaly is not sensitive to changes in dissolved oxygen in oxic environments. By contrast, Ce anomaly is well correlated with dissolved oxygen in anoxic environments, and it was less affected by pH and phosphate concentration. This research has significant implications for using lanthanide patterns in ancient marine carbonates to quantify dissolved oxygen level, especially during anoxic events in the Paleo-ocean.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2296-6463		WOS:000856049300001

Herein, through a facile one-step solvothermal method, iron-doped nickel MOF nanosheets in situ grown on conductive nickel foam (Fe-Ni MOF NSs/NF) were conveniently fabricated as efficient OER catalyst, using only one kind of metal salt precursor. The ultrathin 2-dimensional sheet structure possesses highly exposed surface area and numerous metal sites which are beneficial to electrocatalytic OER performance. The Fe-Ni MOF NSs/NF presents superior OER activity in 1 M KOH, requiring overpotentials of 258 and 270 mV to deliver the current density of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2), along with a low Tafel slope of 40.8 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the durability of the Fe-Ni MOF NSs/NF catalyst is also outstanding, exhibiting only minor chronoamperometric decay after 24 h continuous operation at 50 mA cm(-2). The excellent OER activity could be ascribed to the coupling effects of ultrathin-nanosheet structure, favorable charge transfer kinetics, high conductivity and excellent intrinsic catalytic activity. This facile and economical strategy might be advantageous to prepare other high-performance MOF-based OER catalysts.									43	4	0	0	1	0	45			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000564392000006

Ionic liquids (ILs), as a unique class of metal salts with melting point below 100 degrees C, present themselves as ideal modulators for manipulations of the interfacial structures. Due to their excellent properties such as good chemical stability, high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical windows and tunable solvent properties the performance of electrocatalysts can be substantially improved through ILs. In the current minireview, we highlight the critical role of the IL phase at the microenvironments created by the IL, the liquid electrolyte, catalytic nanoparticles and/or support materials, by detailing the promotional effect of IL in electrocatalysis as reaction media, binders, and surface modifiers. Updated exemplary applications of IL in electrocatalysis are given and moreover, the latest developments of IL modified electrocatalysts following the "Solid Catalyst with Ionic Liquid Layer (SCILL)" concept are presented.

However, their synthetic methods are rather complicated and time-consuming. In this work, for the first time, with FeNi2S4 hollow balloons (FNSH) as the quintessential example, a template-free solvothermal method has been developed to synthesize ternary transition metal sulfide hollow balloons. The corresponding formation mechanism is deeply investigated, and the main factors affecting the formation of the hollow balloons are confirmed to be reaction time and temperature. FNSH/graphene aerogel (FNSH/GA) is further fabricated, which has been proven to be a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The FNSH/GA exhibits excellent performance for the OER with a small overpotential of 273 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, which is even superior to the typical RuO2 catalyst. Furthermore, the FNSH/GA maintains the excellent performance for the OER even after a 10 h chronoamperometric test. Moreover, the synthetic method is universal and can be widely extended to other ternary transition metal sulfide hollow balloons.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448413100012

Here we show a reliable and tunable polyoxometalate template-based synthetic strategy to atomically engineer metal doping sites onto metallic 1T-MoS2, using Anderson-type polyoxometalates as precursors. Benefiting from engineering nickel and oxygen atoms, the optimized electrocatalyst shows great enhancement in the hydrogen evolution reaction with a positive onset potential of similar to 0 V and a low overpotential of -46 mV in alkaline electrolyte, comparable to platinum-based catalysts. First-principles calculations reveal co-doping nickel and oxygen into 1T-MoS2 assists the process of water dissociation and hydrogen generation from their intermediate states.

Herein, a newly constructed porous Co(ii)-metal organic framework (MOF) has been utilized for the synthesis of cobalt nanoparticles embedded in N-doped porous carbon, (Co@NPC), via a facile MOF-annealing strategy, at an optimum temperature of 800 degrees C under an argon atmosphere. DMF molecules present in the form of solvated guests and cations within the 3D-framework serve as a source for N-doping during the formation of the porous graphitic carbon upon carbonization. The nanocomposite was found to encapsulate homogeneously dispersed cobalt nanoparticles within the N-doped porous carbonaceous matrix. The synergistic effect of cobalt nanoparticles and the heteroatom-doped carbon framework makes Co@NPC electrochemically active towards both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under alkaline conditions. Furthermore, Co@NPC exhibits outstanding performance as a bifunctional electrocatalyst towards electrochemical water splitting with remarkable stability and durability. It achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.66 V in 1 M NaOH solution which is comparable with that of most of the self-templated ZIF-derived non-noble metal electrocatalysts.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			2516-0230			WOS:000472766100019	36131968

To solve these problems, in addition to the development of efficient precious-metal catalysts, an effective strategy is proposed to replace the OER by the selective methanol oxidation reaction. Ni-Co hydroxide [NixCo1-x(OH)(2)] nanoarrays were obtained through a facile hydrothermal treatment as the bifunctional electrocatalysts for the co-electrolysis of methanol/water to produce H-2 and value-added formate simultaneously. The electrocatalyst could catalyze selective methanol oxidation (approximate to 1.32 V) with a significantly lower energy consumption (approximate to 0.2 V less) than OER. Importantly, methanol was transformed exclusively to value-added formate with a high Faradaic efficiency (selectivity) close to 100 %. Specifically, a cell voltage of only approximately 1.5 V was required to generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the Ni0.33Co0.67(OH)(2)/Ni foam nanoneedle arrays presented an outstanding stability for overall co-electrolysis.									46	3	0	0	0	0	46			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000508211900001	31808618

Here, the cobalt phosphide (CoP) as an ideal candidate was synthesized for the catalyzed hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes, where the incorporation of dual-metal species (W and Fe) was further used to modulate the electronic structure of the pristine CoP nanosheets to accelerate the electrocatalytic kinetics. As expected, the trimetallic phosphide W,Fe@CoP/CNTs catalyst shows remarkable electrocatalytic performances in terms of small overpotentials of 130 mV for HER and 290 mV for OER and superior stabilities for more than 18 h. It is worth noting that the electro-derived self-reconstruction happened to generate the true catalytically active sites, which results in the cobalt oxy/hydroxides after the OER process and metallic cobalt species after the HER process. This work highlights a rational design of phosphide-based electrocatalysts via the incorporation of multimetal species, which could facilitate the oxidation and reduction of as-prepared catalyst and enhance the performances in the electro-derived processes.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2574-0962			WOS:000500038900036

As a credible technology for the synthesis of functional materials, electrodeposition has attracted widespread attention, especially suitable for non-noble transition metal-based catalysts (TMCs). Recently, lots of researchers have been devoted to this hot research direction with plentiful achievements, however, a comprehensive review towards this area is still missing. Hence, we summarize the past research progress, presents the technical characteristics of electrodeposition from the viewpoint of fundamental theory and influence factors for the electrochemical deposition behavior, and introduce its application in various of TMCs with versatile nanostructures and compositions. Except a deeper and more comprehensive cognition of electrodeposition, we further discuss the catalyst's optimized hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance as well as overall water splitting that combined with the synthetic process. Finally, we conclude the technical advantages towards electrodeposition, propose challenge and future research directions in this promising field.

The lateral size of the nanosheets is about a few hundreds of nanometers with the thickness of approximate to 10 nm. Among all molar ratios investigated, the Ni0.75Fe0.125V0.125-LDHs/NF electrode depicts the optimized performance. It displays an excellent catalytic activity with a modest overpotential of 231 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 125 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1.0 m KOH electrolyte. Its exceptional activity is further shown in its small Tafel slope of 39.4 and 62.0 mV dec(-1) for OER and HER, respectively. More importantly, remarkable durability and stability are also observed. When used for overall water splitting, the Ni0.75Fe0.125V0.125-LDHs/NF electrodes require a voltage of only 1.591 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution. These outstanding performances are mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of the ternary metal system that boosts the intrinsic catalytic activity and active surface area. This work explores a promising way to achieve the optimal inexpensive Ni-based hydroxide electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.									220	16	0	0	6	0	223			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000425744600010	29280276

Such electrocatalysts are in high demand for renewable technologies, such as solar fuel development and fuel cells, as well as energy storage devices and lithium ion batteries. Herein, we present a simple wet chemical method for synthesizing trimetallic (AuAg/Cu) nanoparticles that can be utilized as an efficient electrocatalyst for OER. The prepared nanocomposite material delivers effective water splitting at a low overpotentials. The OER kinetics of the trimetallic composite material were analyzed experimentally in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, revealing a Tafel slope of 82 mV/dec corresponding to an overpotential of 300 mV and a resistance of 177.9 Omega. These values provides the functional material for OER activity and can be used for electrochemical water splitting properties due to synergetic effects produced for the development of other functional materials composite material exhibiting excellent stability and durability over the 40 hours test duration. Therefore, this study demonstrates a safe and clean route toward fabricating efficient electrocatalysts comprising mixed-metal alloys that are suitable for renewable energy applications. The proposed synthesis method protocol is cost-effective and simple, and opens a new pathway for the preparation of efficient electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2288-6559			WOS:000643290000006

Herein, we develop a facile strategy for fabricating the heterojunction Co/Co2P nanocrystals that are confined in bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotubes (Co/Co2P@NCNTs) on a large scale. In particular, operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements were conducted to investigate the dynamic structural evolution of the precatalyst during electrocatalytic operation. Active state self-reconstruction from the Co/Co2P heterojunctions into Co3+ octahedral site (Oh)-containing CoOx(OH)(y) active species is observed. Consequently, the high degree of graphitization of NCNTs with optimized N species and the completely triggered cross-linked CoOx(OH)(y) both contribute to the outstanding bifunctional ORR/OER activity (E-gap = 0.68 V vs RHE) and durability. Meanwhile, the Co/Co2P@NCNTs as a precatalyst exhibits an ultralong cycling stability (cycling life of >1000 h) in rechargeable zinc-air flow batteries.									38	2	0	0	3	0	38			2380-8195			WOS:000639063800001

Herein, both cyanamide and triazole functional groups are first incorporated into a heptazine-based carbon nitride (CN) polymer, resulting in a mesoporous conjugated cyanamide-triazole-heptazine polymer (CTHP) with different compositions by increasing the quantity of cyanamide/triazole units in the CN backbone. Varying the compositions of CTHP modulates its electronic structures, mesoporous morphologies, and redox energies, resulting in a significantly improved photocatalytic performance for both H(2)and O(2)evolution under visible light irradiation. A remarkable H(2)evolution rate of 12723 mu mol h(-1)g(-1)is observed, resulting in a high apparent quantum yield of 11.97% at 400 nm. In parallel, the optimized photocatalyst also exhibits an O(2)evolution rate of 221 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), 9.6 times higher than the CN counterpart, with the value being the highest among the reported CN-based bifunctional photocatalysts. This work provides an efficient molecular engineering approach for the rational design of functional polymeric photocatalysts.									14	3	0	0	1	0	14			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000558656000001	32790004

To date, various investigations of model reaction systems under thermal conditions have been performed, but most of the studies have been carried out with cerium(IV) salts as oxidants under acidic conditions. Herein we report a novel reaction system based on the combination of triarylaminium radicals as oxidants and pyridines as bases, where some ruthenium complexes work as effective catalysts. We believe the novel reaction system described in this paper provides a new approach to develop effective water oxidation catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0366-7022	1348-0715		WOS:000478691200002

The infiltrated Pd-YSZ electrodes show good electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. For example, the electrode polarization resistance (RE) for 2.0 mg cm(-2) Pd infiltrated YSZ is 0.36 Omega cm(-2) at 800 degrees C. RE is not significantly affected by co-infiltrating Pd with Mn and Co, but is enhanced by co-infiltration of Ce and Gd. The co-infiltration of low concentrations of metals in particular Co, Ce and Gd significantly enhances the microstructure and performance stability of the Pd-YSZ electrodes. The results demonstrate that the addition of dopants to the Pd in the form of either an alloy (Co) or a separate phase (Ce and Gd) is beneficial to enhance the performance and stability of Pd based oxygen electrodes of SOECs.

Herein, in this work, waste grapefruit peels with wrinkled hollow structure and abundant reactive groups were used to fabricate a series of multifunctional nickel nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen self-doped graphene-like carbon nanocomposites (Ni-x @NGC, where "x" represents the amount of Ni) via a simple and convenient impregnation-carbonization strategy. The reaction temperature and Ni amount were tuned to investigate their influences on structure and performance. When evaluated as electrocatalysts in alkaline oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions, the optimal Ni-0.20 @NGC-700 exhibits low overpotentials of 350 and 165 mV and moderate Tafel slopes at current densities of 20 and 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Also, the as-prepared Ni-0.20 @NGC-750 shows an excellent magnetic ability with a high saturation magnetization strength of 47 emu g(-1) and a low coercivity of 83 Oe. This study may provide a simple and sustainable approach for the development of environmental and cost-effective nanocomposites with excellent electrical and magnetic performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000725680100007

Herein, a Janus electrode with asymmetric wettability has been prepared by modifying two sides of a porous stainless-steel mesh electrode, with superhydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and Pt/C (or Ir/C) catalyst with well-balanced hydrophobicity, respectively, affording unidirectional transportation of as-formed gaseous hydrogen and oxygen from the catalyst side to the gas-collecting side during water splitting. "Bubble-free" electrolysis was realized while "floating" the Janus electrode on the electrolyte. Antibuoyancy through-mesh bubble transportation was observed while immersing the electrode with the PTFE side downward. The wettability gradient within the electrode endowed sticky states of bubbles on the catalyst side, resulting in efficient bubble-free gas transportation with 15-fold higher current density than submerged states.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000537394100125	32348671

In this study, 3D porous g-C3N4@carbon (CN@C) microflowers composed of carbon-coated g-C3N4 nanosheets were prepared by a facile bio-inspired method. At first, cyanuric acid-melamine (CAM) supermolecules were assembled into 3D microflowers with the mediation of sucrose molecules through a hydrothermal process, and then isomorphically converted into 3D CN@C microflowers upon calcination. By varying the saccharide species, it was found that the formyl groups of saccharide molecules and their self-polycondensation behavior could govern the CAM assembly and subsequent formation of microflower structure. The resultant CN@C microflowers exhibit high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with a potential of 1.68 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) due to efficient mass and charge transfer, which is close to the reported value for the state-of-the-art metal catalyst IrO2/C (1.60 V, 0.1 mol L-1 KOH) and much superior to that of pure g-C3N4.									38	8	0	0	6	0	41			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000427616900032

Electrochemical energy storage devices with the ability to store sustainable energy, electrochemical-sensing and electrocatalysis technologies such as O-2 reduction reaction (ORR), O-2 evolution reaction (OER), H-2 evolution reaction (HER), CO2 reduction reaction (CRR), and N-2 reduction reaction (NRR) are highly desired. The performances of these devices tightly rely on the electrode materials, which has aroused extensive attention on the exploitations of novel electrode active substances. Due to the outstanding structural designability, large specific surface area and adjustable active sites, electrically conductive metal-organic frameworks with redox-activity (ECMOFs) are regarded as the capable candidates of active substances for those electrochemical applications. This review introduces the conductive mechanisms of ECMOFs, provides the design strategies of ECMOFs electrodes and summarizes the recent advances on ECMOFs in electrochemical sensing, electrochemical energy storage and electrocatalysts in detail. Finally, the challenges and outlook of ECMOFs in the practical applications are systematically emphasized, which will open an avenue to the development of ECMOFs-based electrochemical devices.

By fixing the seeding process, the scaffolding function of ZnO nanorods was studied by varying deposition times (30 s, 60 s, and 90 s) of Co3O4 at a nucleation current of -1.0 mA cm(-2). The amount of deposited Co3O4 has a strong influence on the oxygen evolution performance with ZnO scaffolds. To deliver a current density of 10.0 mA cm(-2) in neutral solutions (0.5 M K2SO4), the presence of ZnO scaffold electrodes negatively shifted the overpotential by similar to 200 mV. In particular, the Co3O4/ZnO hybrid nanostructured electrode (60 s) exhibits the lowest onset potential of 1.5 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). Electrochemical impedance spectra and double layer capacitance showed that the enhanced oxygen evolution activities originated from the improved charge transfer capability and the increased electrochemically active interface between Co3O4 and ZnO.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2192-6506			WOS:000449679700008	31950612

Three different scavengers were used: dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), histidine (His), and n-propyl gallate (nPG). As result of the UV-B treatment of isolated membranes, the flash oxygen yields were considerably affected - the amplitudes decreased and the oscillation pattern was lost. The analysis of the flash oxygen yields and initial oxygen burst showed alterations of a number of oxygen evolving centers in the S0 state as well as changes of decay kinetics of the oxygen burst under continuous irradiation. ROS scavengers exhibited more or less expressed protective effects, nPG being the most effective against UV-B induced damages of the flash oxygen yields. At both the temperatures, photosystem II (PS II) mediated electron transport was more sensitive to the UV-B treatment in comparison with photosystem I (PS I). The analysis of 77 K fluorescence spectra showed that the fluorescence ratio F735/F685 increased by the UV-B treatment probably due to a redistribution of excitation energy between both photosystems most likely caused by partial unstacking and due to a decrease of PS II fluorescence resulting from reaction center-type quenching. The nPG was the most powerful scavenger which protected the oxygen evolution capacity of PS II in the absence and presence of an exogenous electron acceptor to the highest extent.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0006-3134	1573-8264		WOS:000335328100014

For such an approach, in the anode-side the electro-leaching of metals and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were monitored using a titanium plate in a HNO3 solution. Whereas, in the cathodic-side three di fferent cathodes (smooth-Pt, titanium coated with ruthenium oxide (RuO2 |Ti) and titanium coated with platinum nanoparticles (nPt /C |Ti)) were used in a solution of H2SO4. From the current versus potential characteristics, it has been demonstrated in this work that the modified electrodes promote a better cathodic current for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) decreasing the cell potential and then, increasing the current density of the induced metallic electro-leaching in the anodeside. The calculated space-time yield (STY) was ca. 123.4 and 64 mol.L-1.h(-1).cm(-2) for (nPt /C |Ti) and RuO2 |Ti catalysts, respectively. These results put in clear that the use of catalysts at the nano-metric scale could be an interesting alternative to increase the selectivity and conversion of the electro-leaching process at relative low cost.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1665-2738			WOS:000721369900001

In this paper, one-pot solid phase synthesis was employed to synthesize Pt (P)-V2O5/CNs catalyst, and it is shown that the addition of photo-responsive V2O5 and the doping of P are successfully achieved. Electrochemical measurements show that the Pt (P)-V2O5/CNs exhibits attractive bi-functional electrocatalytic property for ORR and HER, in comparison with the commercial PtRu/C-JM catalyst. More importantly, Pt (P)-V2O5/CNs presents much better electro-photo synergistic catalysis both for ORR and HER due to its excellent photoresponsive properties of V species in Pt (P)-V2O5/CNs, resulting in drastically enhanced catalytic activity and stability under the simulated sunlight irradiation.

Herein, we report a redox process sculpturing commercial NiFe foams with dual-scale porosities as high efficient catalysts for water oxidation reactions. Through the oxidation-reduction process, many pores of few micrometres in size were formed on a porous NiFe backbone with a pore size of 50-300 mu m. The pore morphology can be reasonably controlled by varying the oxidation temperature. Electrochemical measurement demonstrates that redox-NiFe foam exhibits greatly enhanced activity towards oxygen evolution reaction. Specifically, the redox-NiFe foam oxidized at 900 degrees C yields the best catalytic activity with an overpotential of 294 +/- 3 mV to achieve the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, which is much lower than 402 +/- 2 mV of initial NiFe foam. This work highlights the formation of highly porous microstructure in the original skeleton of NiFe foam. Furthermore, the redox sculptured NiFe foams can also function as effective skeletons for the loading of active catalysts, which thus can find wide applications in electrocatalysis and energy storage.

In this work, in order to combine the advantages of these two different active centers, a solid-phase interface reaction (SPIR) strategy is proposed, which simultaneously introduces oxygen vacancies (V-O) and metal centers (Ru) into the 2D Mo-based catalyst. Briefly, this SPIR occurs at the interface between MoS2 and RuO2 nanoparticles of the RuO2/MoS2 precursor when overcoming the kinetic barriers at a suitable temperature under an Ar atmosphere. Since the adjacent parts of RuO2 and MoS2 are converted to Ru and MoO2 in situ, a composite system MiSC-1 containing a large amount of active Ru and V-O on MoO2 plane is obtained. Furthermore, theoretical calculations confirm the proposed mechanism of SPIR. MiSC-1 shows excellent stability and catalytic performance in the HER, with an overpotential value of 12 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Additionally, MiSC-1 exhibits excellent performance in the hydrolysis of ammonia borane. This report will provide a versatile platform for the preparation of a multi-component catalyst with high total activity as well as the identification of the structural details of the catalysts.									35	0	0	0	2	0	35			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000649790200001

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as an exciting class of porous materials that received considerable interest in many research fields including electrocatalysis. However, amorphous MOFs have been rarely investigated directly as electrocatalysts compared with crystalline ones. In this study, amorphous bimetallic NiFe-MOF with a three-dimensional (3D) macroporous structure was successfully prepared on nickel foam via one-step bottom-up solvothermal reactions and exhibited the potential as efficient OER (oxygen evolution reaction) electrocatalysts. The prepared self-supporting electrode can provide a 10 mA cm-2 current density at an overpotential of 211 mV, as well as remarkable operational stability and nearly 100% Faraday efficiency. This performance is superior to most previously reported MOF electrocatalysts and well exceeds the corresponding crystalline NiFe-MOF. The greatly enhanced activity of amorphous NiFe-MOF was originated from the abundant active metal sites and improved charge transfer due to unsaturated coordination as well as increased contact area with the electrolyte and good mass transfer benefitting from the unique 3D macroporous structure. This work will stimulate widespread interest in the study of amorphous MOF nanostructures with abundant active sites for improved electrocatalysts and beyond.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000634105800003

It causes individual cell voltage reversal, yielding water electrolysis and carbon corrosion reactions at the anode, ultimately leading to catastrophic cell failure. A popular material-based mitigation strategy is to employ a reversal tolerant anode (RTA) that includes oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst (e.g., IrO2) to promote water electrolysis over carbon corrosion. Here we report that RTA performance surprisingly drops under not only water-deficient but also water-excess conditions. This presents a significant technical challenge since the most common triggers for cell reversal involve excess liquid water. Our findings from detailed electro-chemical diagnostics and nano-scale X-ray computed tomography provide insight into how automotive fuel cells can overcome critical vulnerabilities using material-based solutions. Our work also highlights the need for improved materials, electrode designs, and operation strategies for robust RTAs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Developing an efficient OER catalyst is very important for improving the energy efficiency of electrochemical reduction of CO2; however, only few reports are concerned with this problem for now. Herein, N-doped multiwalled carbon nanotubes surface modified IrOx nanoparticles (IrOx /CNx NTs) as a highly active catalyst for OER at neutral pH was prepared by solvothermal method. The obtained lowest overpotentials for OER in a HCO3-/CO2 system at neutral pH are 171 and 472 mV at the current densities of 1 and 10 mA cm(-2) separately, which are better than the most catalysts those were reported for neutral media. No obvious current density decay was observed after 12-h electrolysis testing. The energy efficiency is a key factor which can reflect the real energy input for CO2 conversion. By using IrOx /CNx NTs as the anode catalyst, the energy efficiency for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate on Sn cathode can achieve 44.7%.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000419950900020

The study of electronic structures and surface chemical states before and after OER testing reveals that the strong electronic coupling between single-atom Ru and Co(OH)F induces the charge redistribution in SA-Ru/Co(OH)F and suppresses the excessive oxidation of Ru into higher valence state (more than +4) under high OER potential. This work provides a strategy to stabilize single-atom Ru by Co(OH)F that can enhance the activity and durability for OER under large current densities.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000645985900009		
J	Guo, HF; An, MZ; Xu, S; Huo, HB								Formation of oxygen bubbles and its influence on current efficiency in micro-arc oxidation process of AZ91D magnesium alloy								THIN SOLID FILMS				485	1-2			53	58		10.1016/j.tsf.2005.03.050				AUG 1 2005	2005	Micro-arc oxidation (MAO) of metals is a complicated process combining concurrent partial process of oxide film formation, dielectric breakdown, dissolution of pre-existing film and anodic gas evolution. The probability of domination for any of these partial processes in the overall process depends on the nature of the substrate metal, the constituents and concentration of the electrolyte, as well as on the applied current density. Thus, MAO is an energy-consumption process, always accompanied by plasma chemical, electrochemical and physics chemical reactions in the micro-arc discharge channels. Under those circumstances the subject of current efficiency becomes very important. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the oxide film growth efficiency during MAO process. A series of experiments based on different operating conditions have been performed and the current efficiency has also been calculated. The possible reasons leading to the low current efficiency have also been evidenced as anodic oxygen gas evolution, metal anodic dissolution and chemical dissolution of pre-existing oxide films in the electrolyte. Among these reasons oxygen gas evolution associated with electronic current during sparking is considered to be the dominating one for the low current efficiency, and the factors contributing to formation of oxygen bubbles have also been categorized.

Among various candidates, Li-O-2 battery has been recognized as one type of the next generation lithium battery to achieve the energy density goal of 350-500 Wh kg(-1) due to its extremely high theoretical energy density. However, there are gaps in terms of achievable energy density, rate-capability and cycling performance with respect to practical applications. One of the main reasons is the sluggish reaction kinetics of oxygen electrochemistry at the cathode caused by the insolubility and insulation of the discharge product Li2O2. Considering the advantage of mobility in Li-O-2 battery over general solid catalysts, soluble catalytic redox mediators have been introduced into aprotic Li-O-2 battery to facilitate the kinetics of both oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction on the cathode and extensively investigated. In this paper, recent progress on the application of soluble catalytic redox mediators in non-aqueous Li-O-2 battery is systematically reviewed with focus on the underpinning chemical and electrochemical reaction mechanisms, after a brief discussion on the electrolyte solvent which plays a crucial role on the battery performance. The challenges and future opportunities of Li-O-2 battery containing soluble catalytic redox mediators are also summarized and analyzed in this paper.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2405-8297			WOS:000701750600001

These pathways revolve around a theme of coupling oxidation-reduction reactions to the formation of membrane potential and subsequent ATP synthesis. Although the basic principles underlying bioenergetics are universally conserved, the constituents of the bioenergetic pathways in different organisms have evolved unique aspects to fill an evolutionary niche. Three-dimensional structures of all of the membrane-spanning components of the electron-transfer chain of oxygenic photosynthesis have revealed those unique aspects of this fascinating process, including the unique metallocofactor for catalysis, the determinants of the uniquely high voltage cofactor, and the numerous photoprotective mechanisms that guard against radical damage.									31	1	0	0	18	0	33			1367-5931	1879-0402		WOS:000237000700002	16504567

The catalyst shows a breakthrough oxygen evolution rate (40.6 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) with apparent quantum yield of 10.4% at 400 nm, which is 1353 times higher than the low crystalline PDI-NH. The highly crystalline structure comes from the ordered self-assembly process in molten imidazole solvent via pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bonding. Further, the excellent performance ascribes to the robust built-in electric field induced by its high crystallinity, which greatly accelerates the charge separation and transfer. What is more, the PDI-NH is quite stable and can be reused over 50 h without performance attenuation. Briefly, the crystalline PDI-NH with strong built-in electric field throws light on photocatalytic oxygen evolution, showing a new perspective for the design of organic photocatalysts.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000748792100001	34989031

To generate abundant active edge sites on graphene-based electrocatalysts for superior electrocatalytic activity, rather than at their basal plane, has been a challenge. A new type of ORR electrocatalyst produced using fluidization process and based on a three-dimensional hybrid consisting of horizontally-aligned carbon nanotube and graphene (CNT-G), featured abundant active edge sites and a large specific surface area (863 m(2) g(-1)). The Pt-doped CNT-G exhibited an increase of about 55% in mass activity over the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C and about 164% over Pt/N-graphene in acidic medium, and approximately 54% increase in kinetic limiting current than the Pt/C at low overpotential in alkaline medium. The higher mass activity indicates that less Pt is required for the same performance, reducing the cost of fuel cell electrocatalyst. In hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), both the metal-free CNT-G and Pt/CNT-G exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity compared to N-doped graphene and commercial Pt/C, respectively.

However, the current photocatalysts suffer from inefficient photoabsorption, rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, and inadequate surface reactive sites. Introduction of oxygen vacancies (OVs) in photocatalysts has been demonstrated to be an efficacious strategy to solve these issues and improve photocatalytic efficiency. This review systematically summarizes the recent progress in the oxygen vacant semiconductor photocatalysts. Firstly, the formation and characterizations of OVs in semiconductor photocatalysts are briefly introduced. Then, highlighted are the roles of OVs in the photocatalytic reactions of three types of typical oxygen-containing semiconductors, including metal oxides (TiO2, ZnO, WO3, W18O49, MoO3, BiO2-x, SnO2, etc), hydroxides (In(OH)(3), Ln(OH)(3) (Ln=La, Pr, and Nd), Layered double hydroxides) and oxysalts (bismuth-based oxysalts and others) photocatalysts. Moreover, the advanced photocatalytic applications of oxygen vacant semiconductor photocatalysts, such as pollutant removal, H-2 production, CO2 reduction, N-2 fixation and organic synthesis are systematically summarized. Finally, an overview on the current challenges and a prospective on the future of oxygen vacant materials is proposed.									87	2	0	0	10	1	88			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000635877100001

As a result, a high quantum efficiency for overall water splitting of about 30% has been accomplished. In addition, recent progress in the understanding of the reaction mechanism is briefly introduced.On the other hand, mechano-catalytic overall water splitting reaction has been recently discovered by the authors.

Herein, enhanced electro-oxidation performance of FeCoLDH with hydrophilic structure was designed and exhibited efficient removal efficiency of tetracycline. Theoretical calculation and characterization results consistently elucidated that the electronic structure of FeCoLDH is optimized by doping phosphorus and depositing copper nanodots (NDs). In addition, the obtained Cu NDs/P-FeCoLDH shows higher degradation ability of tetracycline in all-pH conditions than pristine FeCoLDH. That's because it owns smaller barrier with 0.6 eV to generate hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) than pristine FeCoLDH. Furthermore, it can effectively degrade organic pollutants in seawater, river water and pharmaceutical wastewater samples. This work provides novel and rational electrode materials for electro-oxidation system with practical application potential, which could offer new insights into the fundamental understanding of electrochemistry.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000762598100006	35176697

This work first presents a comprehensive thermodynamics study of the formation of N 2 O and its simultaneous destruction using the density functional theory (DFT). In addition, the kinetics is reported in a 0-D batch reactor using the rate parameters computed based on the transition state theory (TST). The armchair configuration with pyridine nitrogen is selected as the char(N) model. This work emphasizes the effect of chemisorption mode, temperature, and oxygen form on N 2 O evolution during the NO + char(N) reaction. There are two modes (N -N-O -C and N -O-N -C) for the chemisorption of NO on char surface leading to the generation of N 2 O. By comparison, N 2 O formation is more favorable under the N -O-N -C mode, which can avoid the largest barrier caused by the N -O antibonding node. The involvement of ether oxygen promotes low-temperature generations of N 2 O ( < 673 K), while that of ketone oxygen facilitates moderate-temperature generations of N 2 O (673-873 K). In oxygen-free conditions, N 2 O is released at relatively high temperatures (973-1073 K). Once the temperature is higher than 1073 K, a large amount of N 2 O will be decomposed to gaseous N 2 and CO. The results can explain why the available N 2 O formation mechanisms from char combustion considering the involvement of oxygen species, how different types of oxygen affect the N 2 O formation, and the well-known temperature inflexion point in N 2 O evolution. These findings will advance our understanding of the reaction and help develop a more accurate kinetics model to predict N 2 O emission. (c) 2021 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

S-containing Tdc and N-containing Bpy not only trigger the growth of Co-MOFs nanocrystals with a fixed S/N atomic ratio of 1:2.4 on GO sheets in the presence of Co2+ in H2O/NaOH system, but also provide S, N doping sources in the pyrolysis process of Co-MOFs to form Co/Co9S8 core-shell structure and S, N co-doping in graphene. The results demonstrate that the obtained Co/Co9S8@SNGS at 1000 degrees C (Co/Co9S8@SNGS-1000) by pyrolysis of Co-MOFs@GO exhibits superiorly bifunctional catalytic activities of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, affording an overpotential of 290 mV for OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and 350 mV for HER at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2).

Specifically, an Fe doped Co(OH)(2) shell was electrodeposited on the electrode with a Cu particle core simultaneously. Interestingly, it is found that Fe-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets grew around the Cu particle core. As a result, a novel electrocatalyst with the Cu cube core and the Fe-Co(OH)(2) nanosheet shell was successfully formed in one step. After subsequent thermal oxidation treatment, the CuO microcube@Fe-Co3O4 nanosheet core-shell composite was obtained on the electrode. Benefiting from the one-step electrodeposition, the composite electrode with a smart 3D hierarchical structure as well as the intrinsic activity of Fe-Co3O4 nanosheets showed a remarkably enhanced catalytic performance for OER, which revealed a low overpotential of 232 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density.									32	1	0	0	0	0	33			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000413734800015

In the process of oxidation degradation of dye wastewater, chromogenic groups can be broken firstly, the happening of bleaching reaction is easier than that of benzene ring-opening reaction. Further prolongs degradation time, wastewater can be mineralized completely into carbon dioxide and water.					11th IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)11th IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)	AUG 03-06, 2014AUG 03-06, 2014	IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Tianjin Univ Technol; Kagawa Univ; Beijing Inst Technol; Harbin Inst Technol; State Key Lab Robot & Syst; Chinese Assoc Automat; Robot Soc Japan; Japan Soc Mech Engineers; Japan Soc Precis Engn; Soc Instrument & Control Engineers; Harbin Engn Univ; Univ Electro Commun; Univ Elect Sci & Technol China; Changchun Univ Sci & TechnolIEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Tianjin Univ Technol; Kagawa Univ; Beijing Inst Technol; Harbin Inst Technol; State Key Lab Robot & Syst; Chinese Assoc Automat; Robot Soc Japan; Japan Soc Mech Engineers; Japan Soc Precis Engn; Soc Instrument & Control Engineers; Harbin Engn Univ; Univ Electro Commun; Univ Elect Sci & Technol China; Changchun Univ Sci & Technol	Tianjin, PEOPLES R CHINATianjin, PEOPLES R CHINA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1					978-1-4799-3979-4	WOS:000366848100271

Among these pigments, pyranoanthocyanins linked directly to flavanol dimers have been detected and identified in aged Port wine but not in dry red wine. These pigments are very important with regard to the wine color evolution since they are involved in wine color evolution and stabilization. During this investigation, the occurrence in dry red wine of two pyranomalvidin-procyanidin dimer has been established by low and high resolution HPLC-UV-MS analysis. Moreover, the impact of acidity and oxygen levels on their formation in red wine has been estimated. After four months of evolution, the results showed that, for the same pH, the quantity of this pigment was correlated with oxygen concentrations. Moreover, for the same quantity of oxygen, the concentration of this pigment was related to the acidity level.									17	0	0	0	13	0	17			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000331779400034	24476064

A numerical two-phase model based on the Euler-Euler approach was adopted to describe bubbly two-phase flow during the cell's operation. The numerical model was first validated against experimental data obtained for a wide range of current densities (up to 2.0 A/ cm2). Subsequently, the effect of two-phase flow on the AWE performance was determined by conducting a comparative study in which various cell scales and operating conditions were considered. In particular, the initiation of two-phase flow and the effect of bubble coverage of the electrodes were examined for various electrolyte flow rates, operating current densities, and cell sizes. Simulation results showed that the nucleation of bubbles and the subsequent development of two-phase flow occurred at low electrolyte flow rates and/or for large-sized cells and that they increased the ohmic and activation overpotentials.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000747410000002

TMP nanostructures typically involving binary or ternary TMPs tuned by cation or anion doping are suggested to be promising low-cost and durable OER catalysts. Herein, the preparation of CoP/CoP2 composite nanoparticles encapsulated within N,P-doped carbon nanotubes (CoP/CoP2@NPCNTs) is demonstrated as a synergistic electrocatalyst for OER via the calcination of a CoAl-layered double hydroxide/melamine mixture and subsequent phosphorization. Facile visualization by scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with electron backscatter diffraction demonstrates the encapsulation of the CoP/CoP2 nanoparticles within the N,P-codoped CNTs. Electrocatalytic evaluation shows that the composite electrode requires a low overpotential of 300 mV for the OER at 10 mA cm(-2) in a 1.0 m KOH solution and, in particular, exhibits an excellent long-term durability of approximate to 100 h, which is superior to that of the state-of-the-art RuO2 electrocatalyst. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the synergistic effect of CoP and CoP2 can enhance the electrocatalytic performance. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the generated O-2 molecules can readily diffuse out of the CNTs. Both the effects give rise to the observed OER enhancement.									90	2	0	0	5	0	90			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000432032800026	29633498

Two coal samples from Bulianta and Yuwu collieries were collected for simultaneous thermal analysis in O-2/N-2 (21 vol%/79 vol%) and O-2/N-2/CO2 (15 vol%/80 vol%/5 vol%) at-mospheres. Based on the TG-DTG curves, five evolution stages were analyzed. A delay phenomenon occurred for coal lean-oxygen combustion in O-2/N-2/CO2, which was obvious at IV stage with a high staged temperature and a wide temperature range. Furthermore, the kinetic parameters were obtained after determining the most probable mechanism function, showing an increased apparent activation energy at III stage and a decreased one at IV stage in O-2/N-2/CO2 compared with in O-2/N-2, which indicated that the low heat conduction coefficient of CO2 played a dominant role on these changes. The study also showed the relationship between the thermal formation rate and reaction rate constant. (C) 2021 Energy Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, hierarchically hollow VOOH nanostructures are rationally constructed by partial iron substitution and systematically investigated for electrocatalytic water splitting. Benefiting from the hierarchically stable scaffold configuration, highly electrochemically active surface area, the synergistic effect of the active metal atoms, and optimal adsorption energies, the 3% Fe (mole ratio) substituted electrocatalyst (VOOH-3Fe) exhibits a low overpotential of 90 and 195 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, respectively, superior than the other samples with a different substituted ratio. To the best of current knowledge, 195 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) is the best value reported for V or Fe (oxy)hydroxide-based OER catalysts. Moreover, the electrolytic cell employing the VOOH-3Fe electrode as both the cathode and anode exhibits a cell voltage of 0.30 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with a remarkable stability over 60 h. This work heralds a new pathway to design efficient bifunctional catalysts toward overall water splitting.									79	3	0	0	4	0	79			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000487518200001	31544337

The large extrinsic loop E of this protein has been shown to interact with the oxygen-evolving site. Previously, Vermaas and coworkers have produced a number of deletions within loop E which yielded mutants which were unable to grow photoautotrophically and which could not evolve oxygen at normal rates. During the course of our site-directed mutagenesis program in Synechocystis 6803, we have altered all of the conserved charged residues which were present within six of these deletions. All ten of these mutants were photoautotrophic and evolved oxygen at normal rates. We speculate that the severe phenotypes of the deletion mutants observed by Vermaas and coworkers is due to large structural perturbations in the extrinsic loop E of CP 47.									15	0	0	0	14	0	15			0167-4412	1573-5028		WOS:A1996WD34400023	9002620

Herein, nickel-cobalt-titanium (NCT) alloy is directly grown on a high corrosion resistance titanium foil by a simple, single, and rapid electrochemical deposition at room temperature. The electrocatalytic activity of NCT alloy electrodes is evaluated for both HER and OER in aqueous electrolyte. Our NCT electrocatalyst exhibits low overpotentials around 125 and 331 mV for HER and OER, respectively, in 1 M KOH. In addition to this outstanding activity, the bifunctional catalyst also exhibits excellent OER and HER electrode stability up to 150 h of continuous operation with a minimal loss in activity. Further, the NCT alloy directly grown on titanium foil is used to directly construct membrane electrode assembly (MEA) for alkaline electrolyte membrane (AEM) water electrolyzer, which make the practical applicability. This single-step electrodeposition reveals NCT on titanium foil with high activity and excellent electrode stability suitable for replacing alternative commercial viable catalyst for the alkaline water splitting.									55	1	0	0	2	0	55			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000399354100030	28337912

This repot explores the design of two-dimensional (2D) MOFs with redox-active metal centers (Ni(II), Co(II), and Cu(II)) containing two types of electron-rich linkers such as bis(5-azabenzimidazole), linear L-1 and angular L-2, and aromatic dicarboxylates. The electron-rich linkers are considered to stabilize the higher oxidation state of the redox-active metal centers in the course of the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. The 2D MOFs of L-1 and L-2 with Co(II) (1 and 3) and Ni(II) (2 and 4) have been produced via the conventional hydrothermal synthesis, while the MOFs of Cu(II) (Cu@1 and Cu@3) are obtained by the postsynthetic transmetallation reaction of MOFs 1 and 3. The electrocatalytic OER activities of the six MOFs have been studied to explore the influence of the redox potential of the transition-metal quasi-reversible couples and the coordination environment around the redox-active metal centers in the electrocatalytic activity. The lowest overpotential of 370 mV exhibited by MOF 2 with the highest current density and TOF value indicates the importance of the presence of coordinated water molecules and the lowest redox potential value of the most favorable quasi-reversible couple Ni+2/Ni+3. These catalysts exhibit a remarkable stability up to 1000 OER cycles. These studies pave the way for the design of MOF materials toward the development of a promising heterogeneous OER electrocatalyst.									30	0	0	0	1	0	30			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000557854700023	32633480

With this special structure of CFO-ns and the covalent coupling between CFO-ns and rGO in the CFO-ns/rGO hybrid, more active sites are exposed and the transport of O-2 and electrolyte is faciliated when the CFO-ns/rGO hybrid is employed as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The CFO-ns/rGO hybrid demonstrates high catalytic activity for both the ORR and OER. It shows a more positive onset potential of -0.11 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for the ORR, which is 50 mV higher than that of CFO-ns + rGO physical mixture (-0.16 V). Meanwhile, the onset potential of CFO-ns/rGO hybrid (0.56 V) for the OER is 40 mV lower than that of CFO-ns + rGO mixture (0.60 V). The high activity of the CFO-ns/rGO hybrid is attributed to the special structure of CFO-ns, the covalent coupling between CFO-ns and rGO as well as the suppressed agglomeration of CFO-ns and restacking of rGO in the hybrid. Moreover, the covalent coupling between CFO-ns and rGO endows the hybrid with excellent electrochemical stabilities for both the ORR and OER.									36	3	0	0	1	0	36			2046-2069			WOS:000367250900037

In this study, various electrocatalytic reactions were investigated for Pd and Pt SACs. The single atoms were immobilized on thin layers of graphitic carbon nitride with carbon black (for simplicity, C@C3N4) to produce an electrochemically efficient and stable SACs. Single atomic structure was confirmed by high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and CO stripping experiments were conducted, and the results were compared with the corresponding nanoparticle catalysts. Lack of ensemble sites in the SACs resulted in two-electron pathway for ORR; single atomic Pd on C@C3N4 (C@C3N4-Pd-1) showed high activity and selectivity for H2O2 formation. DFT calculations showed that C@C3N4-Pd-1 follows a downhill path for H2O2 formation unlike single atomic Pt on C@C3N4 (C@C3N4-Pt-1), resulting in enhanced H2O2 selectivity. Weaker adsorption of oxygen intermediates on C@C3N4-Pd-1 resulted in enhanced ORR activity. The SACs showed no interaction with CO as confirmed by no CO stripping peak. This resulted in no activity for formic acid oxidation following indirect pathway or methanol oxidation, which necessitates COads as reaction intermediates. SACs can be efficient electrocatalysts with high activity and unique selectivity.									35	4	0	0	3	0	35			2196-0216			WOS:000475249600001

However, the underlying mechanism of the facet effect and the influence of lattice oxygen on beta-PbO2 for electrochemical ozone production (EOP) remain unclear. Here, beta-PbO2-120 nanorods (beta-PbO2-120 NRs) were prepared to investigate the mechanism of the facet effect and the influence of lattice oxygen during the EOP process. The beta-PbO2-120 NRs assembled as an anode in a membrane electrode assembly show a remarkable EOP performance. Measurements using in situ(18)O isotope-labeling differential electrochemical mass spectrometry confirm that all three oxygen atoms in the ozone originate from the lattice oxygen of beta-PbO2. Theoretical calculations verify that the EOP reaction pathway on beta-PbO2 follows the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM), and surface lattice oxygen migration and coupling to O-2/O-3 are favorable on the (101) and (110) surfaces of beta-PbO2. Different reaction mechanisms are proposed on the two surfaces, and (101) exhibits higher reactivity for O-2 and the formation of O-3. This valuable insight into the facet effect and LOM of metal oxide-based electrocatalysts can be extended to other applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000631586700001

Their phase composition, morphology and electrochemical performance were characterized by X-ray diffractometry, transmission electron microscopy and electrochemical properties test techniques, respectively. The result of XRD indicates that the catalyst sample IrO2 is a single crystal nanorod rutile oxide with a diameter in the range of 10-20 nm and a length of around 90 nm. The results of cyclic voltammetries show that, when the electrode potential is lower than 0.3 V or higher than 1.2 V, a water electrolysis reaction can be detected on the catalyst samples. The transforming process of catalytic activity center ion pair Ir(III)/Ir(IV) takes place at electrode potential of about 0.83 V. Finally, linear sweep voltammetry reveals that the oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity of IrO2 nanorods is superior to that of the commercial IrO2 catalysts, which is about 1.38 times as much as that of the commercial catalysts at electrode potential of about 1.7 V.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1004-0609			INSPEC:14323785

Because of the limited availability and climatic issues associated with non-renewable energy sources like fossil fuel consumption, researchers are in search of a replacement for such unsustainable energy systems. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is one of the proficient techniques for its utilization in energy conversion and fuel cell applications. Designing an efficient electrocatalyst with an admirable activity is very challenging. Herein, we report a 2D covalent organic framework (COF), namely TRIPTA-COF having a moderately better capability towards ORR in basic medium (0.1 M KOH). The heteroatom-containing microporous material possesses a high surface area (1064 m(2) g(-1)) as well as 2D porous channel. This catalyst was successfully utilized for electrochemical ORR, which attained 0.68 V of half-wave potential with considerable stability in alkaline media. Copyright (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Mass-selected Au-9 clusters were deposited on a glassy carbon substrate under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions, and the model electrode was transferred to an electrochemical cell with the rotating disk electrode (RDE) configuration. Cyclic voltammetry exhibited a significantly lower oxide-reduction peak potential of the Au clusters than that of bulk Au in the first cycle, thus confirming the exceptionally higher oxophilicities for the former. After performing cyclic voltammetry with an upper limit potential of 1.8 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode, the ORR activity of the Au clusters was lower than that of bulk Au and bulk Pt. This result was partially ascribed to aggregations of Au clusters during the potential cycles.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000434639900006

Here, we report the preparation of hexagonal spinel-type Mn2AlO4 nanosheets with a high BET surface area of up to 164 m(2) g(-1) through a dealloying-annealing strategy. The Mn2AlO4 catalyst shows a good catalytic activity towards ORR in the alkaline solution, as well as much better methanol tolerance than the commercial Pt/C. Moreover, both the electrochemical measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations (adsorption energy, density of states, H2O2 decomposition) demonstrate that the ORR on Mn2AlO4 is a four-electron pathway.

Herein, atomically thin FeCoNi ternary (oxy)hydroxide nanosheets (FeCoNi-ATNs) are developed as efficient and robust bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 m KOH solution (pH = 14). The electrocatalyst shows remarkably high apparent catalytic performance (400 mA cm(-2) at 350 mV for OER and 240 mV for HER) and mass activities at modest overpotentials (1931 A g(-1) at 330 mV for OER; 1819 A g(-1) at 200 mV for HER). Moreover, the OER and HER performance of FeCoNi-ATNs are fully reversible and electrochemically switchable, due to the interconversion attribute of two catalytic states for OER and HER. Using the dual functional properties of this catalyst, a fully reversible water electrolyzer cell is fabricated, exhibiting a robust reversibility between two half reactions in water electrolysis under a high current density (100 mA cm(-1)), which can effectively overcome the stability issues caused by electrode depolarization during frequent power interruptions, an inevitable phenomenon commonly brought about by the usage of intermittent renewable energy supplies.									75	2	0	0	5	0	75			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000484274000009

Despite great progress has been achieved, synthesis of defect-rich (DR) bimetallic nitride nanocrystals or related nanohybrids remains a challenge, and their electrocatalytic application for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has not been fully studied. Herein, the DR-Ni3FeN nanocrystals and N-doped graphene (N-G) nanohybrids (DR-Ni3FeN/N-G) are fabricated through temperature-programmed annealing and nitridation treatment of NiFe-layered double hydroxides/graphene oxide precursors by controlling annealing atmosphere. In the nanohybrids, the DR-Ni3FeN nanocrystals are anchored on N-G, and mainly show twin crystal defects besides approximate to 10% of stacking faults. Such nanohybrids can efficiently catalyze OER in alkaline media with a small overpotential (0.25 V) to attain the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a high turnover frequency (0.46 s(-1)), superior to their counterparts (the nearly defect-free Ni3FeN/N-G), commercial IrO2, and the-state-of-art reported OER catalysts. Except for the superior activity, they show better durability than their counterparts yet. As revealed by microstructural, spectroscopic, and electrochemical analyses, the enhanced OER performance of DR-Ni3FeN/N-G nanohybrids originates from the abundant twin crystal defects in Ni3FeN active phase and the strong interplay between DR-Ni3FeN and N-G.									153	10	0	0	8	0	154			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000431614500003

Survival and growth of progenies from each parental and hybrid lineages were compared across contrasted conditions of oxygen availability (this factor is suspected to influence habitat utilization of each form of the complex). Whereas growth and development were strongly affected by constant hypoxic conditions in the R. ridibunda lineage, they were not altered in the R. lessonae lineage. Because the performance of the hybrid (R. esculenta) lineage proved to be intermediate between the parental species, no heterosis effect was detected. These results supported the intermediate niche hypothesis as an alternative to the heterotic hybrid superiority hypothesis. The ecological and evolutionary implications are then discussed.									26	0	0	0	27	0	28			1010-061X	1420-9101		WOS:000084708100003

The Ni nanowires were fabricated by a direct-current pulse electrodeposition technique using an anodic aluminum oxide template, followed by selective removal of the supporting pore walls. Scanning Electron Microscope images revealed structural stabilities and X-ray diffraction pattern indicated a polycrystalline fcc phase. In current-potential (i-V) polarizations, the Ni nanowires with longer exposed lengths demonstrated larger current responses. Analysis from impedance spectroscopy confirmed increasing double-layer capacitances with longer Ni nanowires. in galvanostatic lifetime experiments, the freestanding Ni nanowires exhibited a reduced overpotential over that of supported ones. Similar procedures were performed for the oxygen evolution reaction in both i-V and lifetime measurements. For the Ni nanowires of 45 pm length, we estimated the energy cost for hydrogen production was 5.24 x 10(5) J/mole. (C) 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In an attempt to engineer the active sites in Co3O4 spinel for oxygen electrocatalysis in alkaline electrolyte, herein, controllable synthesis of surface-tailored Co3O4 nanocrystals including nanocube (NC), nanotruncated octahedron (NTO), and nanopolyhedron (NP) anchored on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO), through a facile and template-free hydrothermal strategy, is provided. The as-synthesized Co3O4 NC, NTO, and NP nanostructures are predominantly enclosed by {001}, {001} + {111}, and {112} crystal planes, which expose different surface atomic configurations of Co2+ and Co3+ active sites. Electrochemical results indicate that the unusual {112} plane enclosed Co3O4 NP on rGO with abundant Co3+ sites exhibit superior bifunctional activity for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, as well as enhanced metal-air battery performance in comparison with other counterparts. Experimental and theoretical simulation studies demonstrate that the surface atomic arrangement of Co2+/Co3+ active sites, especially the existence of octahedrally coordinated Co3+ sites, optimizes the adsorption, activation, and desorption features of oxygen species. This work paves the way to obtain highly active, durable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts for practical clean energy devices through regulating the surface atomic configuration and catalytic active sites.									202	12	0	0	8	0	206			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000429535300004

Nanostructure engi-neering of electrocatalysts and hybridizing active species with a conductive support represent powerful strategies to enhance the electrocatalytic performance. Herein, we report a facile one-step solvothermal method to directly grow 3D CoNi-layered double hydroxide (LDH) flower-like architectures onto porous and conductive Ni foam (NF) sub-strate (denoted as CoNi-LDH(2:1)@NF hereafter). The flower-like hierarchical architecture of CoNi-LDHs with open configurations endows CoNi-LDH microflowers with sufficient accessible active sites and efficient mass diffusion paths. Moreover, the in situ direct growth manner ensures an intimate contact between the electroactive CoNi-LDHs and NF substrate and thus the charge transfer resistance is reduced. Consequently, the as-formed self-supported and binder-free electrode of CoNi-LDH(2:1)@NF exhibits an outstanding OER performance with a small overpotential of 283 mV at a relatively large current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and a remarkable long-term electrochemical durability in 0.1 M KOH solution, holding great promise in practical scale-up water electrolysis. The present study may open a new avenue to design and fabricate cost-effective and high-efficiency electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Transition metal sulfides have been considered as efficient catalysts for both OER and HER, but their real active species in operation condition are still controversial. Herein, self-supported Ni3S2/FeNi2S4 nanosheets (Ni-Fe-S) are synthesized and in-situ Raman measurement is conducted to monitor the phase transformation under realistic conditions. Combined with a series of ex-situ technologies, it can be concluded that, Ni-Fe-S nanosheets function as pre-catalysts which undergo dynamically structural reconstruction during electrolysis. The active species are determined to be gamma-NiOOH for OER and metallic Ni0 for HER in 1 M KOH media, respectively. As-converted products only need overpotentials of 50 mV for HER and 201 mV for OER to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2, respectively. A two-electrode electrolyzer can afford a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a low cell voltage of 1.55 V. This work provides new perspectives to recognize the catalytic evolution process of nickel-based sulfides for water splitting and sheds light on the rational design of bifunctional materials in energy devices.									34	0	0	0	1	0	34			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000718343600005

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a bottleneck for the development of efficient PEC devices. Here we report a photoelectrochemical method to homogeneously deposit a cobalt-iron oxide (CoFeOx) catalyst on a nanostructured hematite photoanode. An ultrathin catalyst layer (<1 nm) yielded a 200 mV cathodic shift of onset potential and a photocurrent density of 1.6 and 2.5 mA cm(-2) at 1.0 V and 1.23 vs. RHE in 1 M KOH, respectively. We investigated the enhancement of photoactivity induced by the addition of the CoFeOx layer by impedance spectroscopy, photoluminescence, and by using H2O2 as a hole scavenger. This work points to the effective utilization of subnanometric coatings as efficient catalyst overlayers to enhance the OER activity of photoanodes.									40	2	0	0	2	0	40			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463970400009

A series of CoPPi nanostructures including nanowires, nanobelts, nanoleaves, and nanorhombuses are prepared and exhibit very promising electrocatalytic properties toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Acting as both reactant and pseudo-surfactant, the existence of excess Na4P2O7 is essential to synthesize CoPPi nanostructures for unique morphologies. Among all CoPPi nanostructures, the CoPPi nanowires catalyst renders the best catalytic performance for OER in alkaline media, achieving a low Tafel slope of 54.1 mV dec(-1), a small overpotential of 359 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and superior stability. The electrocatalytic activities of CoPPi nanowires outperform the most reported non-noble metal based catalysts, even better than the benchmark Ir/C (20%) catalyst. The reported synthesis of CoPPi gives guidance for morphology control of transition metal pyrophosphate based nanostructures for a high-performance inexpensive material to replace the noble metal-based OER catalysts.									34	2	0	0	0	0	34			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000440561400010	29966041

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a significant step for highly efficient water splitting because OER involves the four electron transfer, overcoming the associated energy barrier that demands a potential greater than that required by hydrogen evolution reaction. Therefore, an OER electrocatalyst with large surface area and high conductivity is needed to increase the OER activity. In this work, we demonstrated an effective strategy to produce a highly active three-dimensional (3D)-printed NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) pyramid electrode for OER using a three-step method, which involves direct-ink-writing of a graphene pyramid array and electrodeposition of a copper conducive layer and NiFe-LDH electrocatalyst layer on printed pyramids. The 3D pyramid structures with NiFe-LDH electrocatalyst layers increased the surface area and the active sites of the electrode and improved the OER activity. The overpotential (eta) and exchange current density (i(0)) of the NiFe-LDH pyramid electrode were further improved compared to that of the NiFe-LDH deposited Cu (NiFe-LDH/Cu) foil electrode with the same base area. The 3D-printed NiFe-LDH electrode also exhibited excellent durability without potential decay for 60 h. Our 3D printing strategy provides an effective approach for the fabrication of highly active, stable, and low-cost OER electrocatalyst electrodes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2045-2322			WOS:000741645800013	35013468

Transition metal compounds, particularly layered double hydroxides (LDHs), are considered as the most promising electrocatalysts owing to their unique two-dimensional layer structures and tunable components. However, heir poor intrinsic electrical conductivities and the limited number of active sites hinder their performances. The regulation of the electronic structure is an effective approach to improve the OER activity of LDHs, including cationic and anionic regulation, defect engineering, regulation of intercalated anions, and surface modifications. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the regulation of the electronic structures of LDHs used as electrocatalysts in OERs. In addition, we discuss the effects of each regulation type on OER activities.

Herein, a facile solvothermal strategy for construction of Prussian-blue analogue (PBA) hollow cages with an open framework was developed. The as-obtained CoFe and NiFe hollow cages (CFHC and NFHC) can be directly utilized as electrocatalysts towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with superior catalytic performance (lower electrolysis potential, faster reaction kinetics and long-term durability) compared to their parent solid precursors (CFC and NFC) and even the commercial noble metal-based catalyst. Impressively, to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution, the CFHC catalyst required an overpotential of merely 330 mV, 21.99% lower than that of the solid CFC precursor (423 mV) at the same condition. Meanwhile, the NFHC catalyst could deliver a current density as high as 100 mA cm(-2) for the urea oxidation electrolysis at a potential of only 1.40 V, 24.32% lower than that of the solid NFC precursor (1.85 V). This work provides a new platform to construct intricate hollow structures as promising nano-materials for the application in energy conversion and storage.									24	0	0	0	1	0	24			2045-2322			WOS:000493898100073	31685920

Attempts to solve this problem have received wide attention recently. However, accessing and stabilizing high-oxidation-state catalytically active species to further improve the high performance for the OER has been considered a huge challenge. Here, we report a Ni-Fe oxide-based nanotube array electrode, novel in design, with strong durability and excellent and synergistically enhanced catalytic performance for the OER. The OER electrode, with a nanotube array nanostructure, shows the remarkable features of a small overpotential of 0.28 V, favourable electrode kinetics and high stability, comparing favorably with the reported performances of the best OER electrocatalysts (IrO2), which is attributed to the formation and stabilization of the favourable OER catalytically active species NiOOH that is produced and reinforced by the introduction of Fe into nanostructured materials. This feasible strategy affords a new strategy for the development of effective and robust OER electrodes.									80	4	0	0	1	0	81			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000351552300058

Herein, ultrafine cobalt-iron bimetallic phosphide nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanosheets are synthesized using two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as the precursor. The 2D morphology of the carbon matrix and the ultrafine character of Co1-xFexP nanoparticles make contributions to OER catalysis. By optimizing the molar ratio of Co/Fe atoms in MOFs, a series of Co1-xFexP/C catalysts are prepared. Among them, Co0.7Fe0.3P/C shows the best OER performance with an overpotential of 270 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and an ultralow Tafel slope of 27 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline electrolyte. Moderate iron doping preserves the catalytically active sites and improves the ability to be oxidized of the surface of Co1-xFexP nanoparticles, and thus enhances the OER activity. Our finding paves the way to the rational design of the morphology and chemical composition of OER catalysts.									26	4	0	0	1	0	27			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000449699400011	30328456

The FeO@CuCo2S4 film is fabricated using a two-step synthesis procedure. First, CuCo2S4 was grown on 3D porous nickel foam substrate using a mild hydrothermal growth technique, onto which FeO was then deposited via a magnetron sputtering. The FeO@CuCo2S4 film shows a cordillera-like morphology with a uniformly distributed island-like nanospheres on its surface. The optimized FeO@CuCo2S4 electrode delivers an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 3213 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1). This FeO@CuCo2S4 electrode shows superior capacity retention and coulombic efficiency of similar to 116% and similar to 99%, respectively, after 10 000 charge/discharge stability cycles. Moreover, this superior electrode is also serves as an OER electrocatalyst in alkaline solution (1 M aqueous KOH), demonstrating better catalytic activity by attaining a low overpotential of similar to 240 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1). This FeO@CuCo2S4 catalyst has excellent current rate performance and endurance properties at a high current density rate of up to 100 mA cm(-2) even after 25 hours. The post-measurement HR-TEM, EDS-STEM mapping, and Raman analysis reveal the phase transformation of FeO@CuCo2S4 upon electro-oxidation.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000503343300001

Here, we report the synthesis of defective metal oxide NPs interconnected with porous nanofibers via a unique space confined strategy. Central to this strategy is encapsulating Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cubes into polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers. Due to the distinct pyrolysis behaviors of PBAs and PAN (i.e., expansion outwards, and contraction inwards, respectively), PAN confers a space confined effect on the PBA-derived metal oxides during calcination in air, resulting in the formation of various lattice defects and unsaturated metal sites on the metal oxides. Consequently, with unsaturated metal sites and an advantageous architecture (i.e., 1D porous nanofibers), the resulting nanofibers with P dopants display good performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Notably, as bifunctional electrocatalysts, the nanofibers deliver an overall water-splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small voltage of 1.52 V. This work paves new pathways toward utilizing distinct pyrolysis behaviours of metal-organic compounds and polymers to construct defective nanomaterials with advanced architectures.									35	2	0	0	3	0	35			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000599751100036

Herein, the hybrid of cobalt encapsulated by N, B codoped ultrathin carbon cages (Co@BCN) is first introduced as a highly active and durable nonprecious metal electrocatalysts for HER, which is constructed by a bottom-up approach using metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursor and self-sacrificing template. The optimized catalyst exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen production from both both acidic and alkaline media. Stability investigation reveals the overcoating of carbon cages can effectively avoid the corrosion and oxidation of the catalyst under extreme acidic and alkaline environment. Electrochemical active surface area (EASA) evaluation and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the synergetic effect between the encapsulated cobalt nanoparticle and the N, B codoped carbon shell played the fundamental role in the superior HER catalytic performance.									368	14	0	0	16	0	371			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000369115800072	26649629

The rate controlling reduction reaction is the one capable of supporting the largest corrosion rate at a given potential. In the case of heterogeneous corrosion, in which the anodic and cathodic sites are spatially distinct and stable, as is found in a galvanic couple; the ability of the noble metal to support a reduction reaction strongly influences the corrosion of the active metal. For aircraft alloys having received conversion coatings and topcoats to control self-corrosion due to precipitate phases, high-strength fasteners made of stainless steel or titanium alloys are the most obvious point of attack for galvanic corrosion. In atmospheric electrolytes, droplet chloride concentrations can exceed 4M, and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is frequently the dominant reduction reaction driving corrosion. Novel binary titanium alloys that had been developed using density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations that predicted oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) rates on the metal oxides, were coupled to structural aluminum alloy (AA7075-T6) panels and exposed to a simulated tropical rainforest environment to compare predicted galvanic corrosion rates with actual galvanic corrosion in an environment in which Cl- ions were applied in a controlled manner.					232nd Fall Meeting of the-Electrochemical-Society (ECS)232nd Fall Meeting of the-Electrochemical-Society (ECS)	OCT 01-05, 2017OCT 01-05, 2017	Electrochem SocElectrochem Soc	National Harbor, MDNational Harbor, MD	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1938-5862	1938-6737	978-1-60768-827-3	WOS:000576947000050

It was found that NiCo2S4/CB was more suitable to be synthesized using ethylene glycol as the dispersing agent than water, and had better ORR/OER catalytic activities than the NiCoS composites with other Ni/Co ratios. In particular, NiCo2S4 showed significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activities when incorporated with CB to form NiCo2S4/CB, with superior ORR/OER electrocatalytic activities compared to NiCo2O4/CB. Even though, the ORR electrocatalytic activity was lower compared to Pt/C, NiCo2S4/CB showed a significantly superior OER activity (similar to 0.75 V @ 10 mA cm(-2)), de-monstrating better overall bifunctional characteristics towards the ORR and OER. The NiCo2S4/CB based bifunctional air electrode in a Zn-air single cell exhibited a higher stability (<= 1.0 V charge/discharge plateau separation for 400 cycles) and longer cycle life (> 500 cycles) than Pt/C (similar to 250 cycles), and so has potential commercial viability.

Lanthanum-based perovskites containing different transition metal active sites (LaBO3, B = Ni, Ni0.75Fe0.25, Co, Mn) are synthesized by a general colloidal method, yielding phase pure catalysts of homogeneous morphology and surface area (8-14 m(2)/g). Each perovskite's ability to catalyze the OER and ORR is examined using thin film rotating disk electrochemistry (RDE). LaCoO3 supported on nitrogen-doped carbon is shown to be similar to 3 times more active for the OER than high-surface-area IrO2. Furthermore, LaCoO3 is demonstrated to be highly bifunctional by having a lower total overpotential between the OER and ORR (Delta E = 1.00 V) than Pt (Delta E = 1.16) and Ru (Delta E = 1.01). The OER and ORR pathways are perturbed by the introduction of peroxide disproportionation functionality via support interactions and selective doping of the catalyst. LaNi0.75Fe0.25O3's ability to disproportionate peroxide is hypothesized to be responsible for the similar to 50% improvement over LaNiO3 in catalytic activity toward the ORR, despite similar electronic structure. These results allow us to examine the pathways for OER and ORR in context of support interactions, transition metal redox processes, and catalytic bifunctionality.									185	9	0	0	17	0	187			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000337199400007

In the presence of CaCl2 and K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] the complexes evolved oxygen at rates exceeding 1000 mu mol (mg of chl)(-1) h(-1). The particles contained 40 chlorophylls a and had properties very similar to those of PSII isolated from higher plants.

J	Lang, Sandra M.; Fleischer, Irene; Bernhardt, Thorsten M.; Barnett, Robert N.; Landman, Uzi								Water Deprotonation via Oxo-Bridge Hydroxylation and O-18-Exchange in Free Tetra-Manganese Oxide Clusters								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				119	20			10881	10887		10.1021/jp5106532				MAY 21 2015	2015	One of the fundamental biological reactions, the catalytically activated water-splitting, takes place at an inorganic tetra-manganese monocalcium penta-oxygen (Mn4CaO5) cluster which together with its protein ligands forms the oxygen evolution complex (OEC) of the membrane-bound pigment protein photosystem II (13511) of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. In the first step of a new hierarchical approach to probe fundamental concepts of the water-splitting reactions, we present the gas-phase preparation of an isolated tetra-manganese oxide cluster ion, Mn4O4+, as a simplified model of the OEC. Reactivity studies with (D2O)-O-16 and (H2O)-O-18 in a gas-phase ion trap experiment reveal the exchange of the oxygen atoms of the cluster with water oxygen atoms. This provides direct experimental evidence for the ability of Mn4O4+ to dissociate water via hydroxylation of the oxo-bridges. The rate of oxygen exchange in the free cluster agrees well with the conversion rate of substrate water to O-2 in photosystem II, thus supporting the involvement of bridging oxygen atoms in this process. First-principles spin density functional theory calculations reveal the molecular mechanism of the water deprotonation and oxo-bridge exchange.					17th International Symposium on Small Particles and Inorganic Clusters (ISSPIC)17th International Symposium on Small Particles and Inorganic Clusters (ISSPIC)	SEP 07-12, 2014SEP 07-12, 2014		Fukuoka, JAPANFukuoka, JAPAN	18	0	0	0	3	0	18			1932-7447			WOS:000355158400012

The polarization curves of oxygen evolution and high density (4 A/cm(2)) lifetime of Ti/SnO2+ Sb2O4/MnO2 and Ti SnO2+Sb2O4/PbO2 anodes were determined in 1.0 mol/L H2SO4 Solution. Their potentials of initial oxygen evolution were lower than those of moble metals, and their lifetimes reached 18 h and 86 h, respectively.

Amongst, Ru@Co3O4-1.0 exhibited the optimum electrocatalytic behavior with an ultra-low potential gap (0.84 V) between the OER potential (1.61 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) and ORR half-wave potential (0.77 V). The zinc-air battery using Ru@Co3O4-1.0 as a cathode presented high specific capacity (788.1 mAh g(-1)) and power density (101.2 mW cm(-2)). Meanwhile, this battery possessed relatively lower voltage gap and higher cycling stability compared with the commercial Pt/C-based one. Ruthenium incorporation induced remarkable lattice expansion of Co3O4 and engineered more oxygen vacancies, promoting the lattice oxygen mobility from the subsurface/bulk phase onto surface. All these properties were recognized to be the crucial parameters for electrocatalytic activity improvement. This work provided a facile approach to design highly active metal oxide with broad potentiality for rechargeable metal-air batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, the sluggish OER kinetics and the utilization of precious metal catalysts are key obstacles in the broad deployment of these energy technologies. Herein, inexpensive supported 4 nm Ni-Fe nanoparticles (NiyFe1-yOx/C) featuring amorphous structures have been prepared via a solution-phase nanocapsule method for active and durable OER electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolyte. The Ni-Fe nanopartide catalyst containing 31% Fe (Ni0.69Fe0.31Ox/C) shows the highest activity, exhibiting a 280 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (equivalent to 10% efficiency of solar-to-fuel conversion) and a Tafel slope of 30 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH solution. The achieved OER activity outperforms NiOx/C and commercial Ir/C catalysts and is close to the highest performance of crystalline Ni-Fe thin films reported in the literature. In addition, a Faradaic efficiency of 97% measured on Ni0.69Fe0.31Ox/C suggests that carbon support corrosion and further oxidation of nanoparticle catalysts are negligible during the electrocatalytic OER tests. Ni0.69Fe0.31Ox/C further demonstrates high stability as there is no apparent OER activity loss (based on a chronoamperometry test) or particle aggregation (based on TEM image observation) after a 6 h anodization test. The high efficiency and durability make these supported amorphous Ni-Fe nanoparticles potentially applicable in the (photo)electrochemical cells for water splitting to make H-2 fuel or CO2 reduction to produce usable fuels and chemicals.									200	9	0	0	8	0	203			0743-7463			WOS:000338806500033	24914708

The astrophysical S factor of such a heavy-ion fusion strongly depends on energy at corresponding stellar temperatures. For the O-16 + O-16 reaction cross section, there are larger discrepancies among di fferent experimental data as the energy decreases, and a complete lack of data below E-c.m. = 7 MeV.We aim to determine the cross sections for the two main exit channels, alpha + 2(8)Si and p + P-31, toward stellar energies. The measurements were performed indirectly by the Trojan horse method (THM) via the O-16(Ne-20, alpha alpha)Si-28 and O-16(Ne-20, p alpha)P-31 three-body reactions, respectively. We performed measurements twice using 20Ne beams at Heavy Ion Laboratory (E-20Ne = 45 MeV) and at Gumilyov Eurasian National University (E-20Ne = 35 MeV). We discuss the applicability of the THM to such a heavy nuclear system showing preliminary results of the momentum distribution of alpha-O-16 intercluster motion in the TH nucleus Ne-20 observed for the first time, which implies a possibility of a multi-step breakup of the TH nucleus.					14th International Symposium on Nuclei in the Cosmos (NIC)14th International Symposium on Nuclei in the Cosmos (NIC)	JUN 19-24, 2016JUN 19-24, 2016	Natl Astron Observ Japan; RIKEN Nishina CtrNatl Astron Observ Japan; RIKEN Nishina Ctr	Niigata, JAPANNiigata, JAPAN	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-4-89027-118-4	WOS:000566261100101

In this study, oxygen vacancy-rich amorphous porous nickel iron hydroxide nanolayers supported on carbon paper (NiFe(OH)(x)/CP) are rationally prepared through a facile approach involving the sequential electrochemical deposition of a Prussian blue (PB) nanocrystal layer and Ni(OH)(x) layer on carbon paper followed by an alkaline etching process, where PB nanocrystals act as an Fe source and template for the formation of an amorphous porous NiFe(OH)(x) layer. NiFe(OH)(x)/CP with an ultralow loading of 0.8 mg cm(-2) exhibits outstanding OER activities, showing a low overpotential of 303 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 33.8 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline electrolyte, which are superior to the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalysts, and among the best results compared to the reported bimetallic compounds. Moreover, NiFe(OH)(x)/CP exhibits excellent long-term stability with negligible degradation after water splitting for 50 h. Its superior electrocatalytic OER performance benefits from the massive oxygen vacancies derived from the amorphous and distorted structures, the synergistic effect between Ni and Fe species with an optimized Ni/Fe ratio, and the efficient electron and mass transfer of carbon paper. This work paves a new avenue for the rational design and preparation of amorphous porous structures with abundant oxygen vacancies to improve the intrinsic activities for energy storage and conversion applications.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000534337900020	32315004

Here, multiple-interfacial Ni/molybdenum carbide hybrid nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon nanosheets (Ni/Mo2C@NC) electrocatalyst were fabricated via a solid-state co-reduction method. The as-synthesized catalyst exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with an overpotential of 91 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope of 74 mV/dec in alkaline solution, and outstanding stability owing to the high conductivity, abundant interfacial active sites, and synergistic effect between Ni and Mo2C nanoparticles. This electrocatalyst as bifunctional electrode possesses an applied voltage of 1.64 V at 10 mA/cm(2) and long-term durability in an electrolysis cell. Moreover, density functional theory calculations reveal that the electron transfer across Ni/Mo2C heterointerfaces could optimize the water adsorption/dissociation and H adsorption/desorption capacities, thereby boosting the intrinsic HER activity.

Calculations are performed for Population I stars of 15, 19, 20, 21, and 25 M-circle dot using the most recently available experimental and theoretical nuclear data, revised opacity tables, neutrino losses, and weak interaction rates and taking into account mass loss due to stellar winds. A novel "adaptive" reaction network is employed with a variable number of nuclei ( adjusted each time step) ranging from similar to700 on the main sequence to greater than or similar to2200 during the explosion. The network includes, at any given time, all relevant isotopes from hydrogen through polonium (Z = 84). Even the limited grid of stellar masses studied suggests that overall good agreement can be achieved with the solar abundances of nuclei between O-16 and Zr-90. Interesting discrepancies are seen in the 20 M-circle dot model and ( so far, only in that model) are a consequence of the merging of the oxygen, neon, and carbon shells about a day prior to core collapse. We find that, in some stars, most of the "p-process" nuclei can be produced in the convective oxygen-burning shell moments prior to collapse; in others, they are made only in the explosion. Serious deficiencies still exist in all cases for the p-process isotopes of Ru and Mo.									755	5	0	0	5	0	760			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000177589100029

Herein, we provide a simple hydrothermal method to synthesize delaminated-Ti3C2/V2O5 (d-Ti3C2/V2O5) hybrid nanostructures. d-Ti3C2/V2O5 hybrid nanostructures are highly active in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with 90 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Superior oxygen evolution activity is observed for d-Ti3C2/V2O5 with 240 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2). Impressively, d-Ti3C2/V2O5 could efficiently drive water splitting into H-2 and O-2 at a voltage of 1.45 V at 10 mAcm(-2) in a two-electrode configuration and a long-term stability was verified for 24 h with a negligible loss in the current density. This is owing to catalytic activity may be due to synergistic effect between d-Ti3C2 MXene and V2O5 nanostructures. The present study highlights different hybrid nanostructures of d-Ti3C2 MXene with metal oxides which can beneficially accelerates electron transfer during the water splitting process and are useful to improve electrocatalytic performance of various MXenes.

In this paper, we investigated the feasibility and universal applicability of hydrogen evolution from different oxygen-containing volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) such as methanol, formaldehyde, formic acid, ethanol, acetic acid, acetone and ethyl acetate steam reforming over NiO/NaF catalysts. The reaction processes and catalytic mechanism of OVOCs steam reforming by 4 wt%NiO/NaF catalyst were analyzed by FESEM, H2-TPR, in situ DRIFTS, XRD characterization and Density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The results showed that different OVOCs could achieve high-efficiency hydrogen production in steam reforming over 4 wt%NiO/NaF catalyst. The order of conversion easiness was formic acid > formaldehyde > methanol > acetic acid > ethanol > acetone > ethyl acetate. Single-carbon organics such as formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol, had H2 selectivity exceeding 100% at 350, 450 and 500 C, respectively. The effective reforming temperature rose with the increasing of carbon contents of reactants. Further investigation confirmed that hydrogen production from different OVOCs steam reforming over 4 wt%NiO/NaF catalyst was a rapid surface reaction. And NaF played a key role, which not only promoted the adsorption of the catalyst to the reactants, but also generated local electric field induced by F- ion that weakened the Ni-O bond and reduced the activation energy. As a result, NiO/NaF had better low-temperature redox properties and hydrogen evolution performance than other nickel-based catalysts with big specific surface area.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0196-8904	1879-2227		WOS:000784293100006

In this study, composite materials consisting of electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO)/sulfur-doped copper oxide supported with carbon cloth (CC) was successfully synthesized as an efficient OER electrocatalyst in NaOH electrolyte. The results of the X-ray diffraction pattern revealed the effect of sulfur on copper as dopant and a transformation from GO to reduced GO through an electrochemical route, respectively. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy micrographs showed the dendritic structure that had a high surface area to be used for electrochemical applications. Moreover, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed the uniformly-successive distribution of Cu and sulfur throughout the structure that enabled a high rate of diffusion of ions and electrons across the electrode and electrolyte interface. As a matter of fact, the prepared electrocatalyst in this work (ERGO/S-doped Cu/CC) showed a small overpotential of 390 mV to reach a current density of 30 mA cm(-2). The ERGO/S-doped Cu/CC demonstrated good durability under conditions of high applied potential of 0.7 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and robust alkaline solution. The good OER activity of ERGO/S-doped Cu/CC is related to the presence of the graphene and sulfurized copper, enhancing the electrochemical surface area as well as the synergetic effects of sulfurized copper and ERGO sheets. This efficient and cost-effective electrocatalyst suggests that the prepared electrode can be a candidate for an OER electrode.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000741383200008

The resultant simultaneous nitrogen-doping and presence of dangling bonds on SRFG prompted us to study the evolution of structural changes with refluxing time. It is shown that the removal of oxygen-containing functional groups leaves dangling bonds during the solvothermal reduction, which are responsible for the nitrogen-doping with longer refluxing time. The relationship between the defects of SRFGs and their lithium ion storage performances are also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, metallic Ni4Mo nanoalloys are firstly implanted on the surface of NiMoOx nanowires array (NiMo/NiMoOx) as metal/metal oxides hybrid. Inspired by the superiority of carbon conductivity, an ultrathin nitrogen-doped carbon sheath intercalated NiMo/NiMoOx (NC/NiMo/NiMoOx) nanowires as integrated core-shell architecture are constructed. The integrated NC/NiMo/NiMoOx array exhibits an overpotential of 29 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1) for HER due to the abundant active sites, fast electron transport, low charge-transfer resistance, unique architectural structure and synergistic effect of carbon sheath, nanoalloys, and oxides. Moreover, as OER catalysts, the NC/NiMo/NiMoOx hybrids require an overpotential of 284 mV at 10 mA cm(-2).

Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials have emerged as a competitor to Pt catalysts for the HER; however, the HER catalytic activity of TMD materials depends on various parameters including their fabrication route. Herein, we present a one-step powderless deposition growth process of 2H-MoS2 and 2H-WS2 materials on their native metals which serve directly as electrodes. The 2H phase TMDs were subsequently partially converted to the 1T-phase by a tert-butyllithium immersion treatment. The 2H and 2H/1T phase TMD foils were utilized for electrochemical hydrogen evolution, and we show that these TMD foils outperform or rival other MoS2 and WS2 materials in the literature fabricated by powder-based deposition/growth techniques. These findings highlight the importance of developing new scalable fabrication routes for HER catalysts in the race toward clean energy production.									9	1	0	0	2	0	9			2168-0485			WOS:000489986400066

The initial voltammetric features suggest that the oxides are inactive toward ORR. The evolution of the ORR voltammograms and potential-dependent H2O2 generation features on the PdO catalyst suggest gradual and parallel in situ reduction of the bulk PdO phase below similar to 0.4 V in the hydrogen underpotential deposition (H-upd) region; the reduction of the bulk PdO catalyst is confirmed from the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. The potential-dependent H2O2 generation features originate due to the presence of surface oxides and adsorbed hydrogen; this is further confirmed using halide ions (Cl- and Br-) and peroxide as the external impurities.									50	0	0	0	1	0	50			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000355632900011	25991432

The strong degeneracy of the massive WD prevents the expansion of the gas and drives the temperatures in the nuclear burning region to values exceeding 10(8)K under all circumstances. As a result, a major fraction of the CNO nuclei in the envelope are transformed into beta-decay nuclei. The energy released from the decay of these nuclei is responsible for ejecting 10(-5)M. to 10(-4)M. of gas at high velocities. A major fraction of novae in outburst are observed to form dust in the ejected matter and we review the infrared (IR) observations which reveal the onset and evolution of this dust formation phase. We discuss the characteristics of nova dust and show that it may be the most interesting dust produced by any astrophysical object. IR observations show, in addition, that novae appear capable of condensing dust with at least four different chemical and mineral compositions. We argue that the class of ONeMg novae may form dust grains that carry the Ne-E and Mg-26 anomalies observed in meteoritic grains. We also report on the results of new calculations of thermonuclear runaways on both carbon-oxygen and oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarfs using our one-dimensional, fully implicit, hydrodynamic stellar evolution code that includes a large nuclear reaction network. We have updated both the nuclear reaction network and the nuclear reaction rates. Our results show that the changes in the reaction rates and opacities produce quantitative changes with respect to our earlier studies. The causes are (1) that the new opacities are larger than those we previously used, which results in less mass being accreted onto the white dwarf, and (2) that the proton-capture reaction rates for some of the intermediate mass nuclei near Al-26 have increased so that the evolution to higher mass nuclei is enhanced.

During the process of charging and discharging, the two key processes viz. oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limit their efficiency. In general, the noble metal-based electrocatalysts (ORR: platinum (Pt); OER: iridium (IV) oxide [IrO2] and ruthenium oxide [RuO2]) have long been used. Nonetheless, these noble metal electrocatalysts also have their limitations owing to high cost and poor stability. As alternatives, polymers are found to be most promising on account of their tunable structure, uniform network, high surface morphology and strong durability. Polymers are capable catalysts. In this review, recent advances as well as insight into the architecture of covalent organic polymers (COPs), metal coordination polymers (MCPs) and pyrolysis-free polymers (PFPs) are duly outlined.

Single-crystal-like MCM-48 nanospheres, synthesized via a new and simple route in a dilute and alkaline solution of benzylcetyldimethylammonium chloride, are applied as the hard template. A facile process of molten salt impregnation followed by hydrogen reduction is developed to replicate both the mesostmcture and morphology of the hard template and to form mesoporous Pt nanospheres. The high-surface-area mesoporous Pt nanospheres are thermally stable in air up to 300 degrees C without showing significant metal sintering. Electrocatalytic studies reveal that mesoporous Pt nanospheres have a large fraction of {110} facets and exhibit high activity for the ORR The excellent electrocatalytic performance may be mainly attributed to the facet-dependent ORR activities as well as the presence of 3D interconnected mesopores to facilitate mass transport.									55	1	0	0	5	0	55			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000327045000016

Unlike common strategies for adjusting the proportion of metal centers in a multi-metal organic framework (MOF), herein, we designed and synthesized bifunctional electrocatalysts using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-capped ultra-low content platinum (Pt) (<= 0.5 wt.% Pt) and copper (Cu) nanoparticles and doped on the surface of zinc-based MOF (Zn-MOF-74) and calcinated at 900 degrees C. According to the electrochemical activity, the Pt/Cu/NPC-900 exhibits superior catalytic activities towards both the ORR with the onset (E (0)) and half-wave (E (1/2)) potentials were 1.0 V and 0.89 V versus RHE, respectively, and OER (E (o) = 1.48 V versus RHE and overpotential (eta) = 0.265 V versus RHE) in an alkaline electrolyte at ambient temperature. Also, Pt/Cu/NPC-900 catalyzes through a 4(-) electron process and exhibits superior stability. Such insightful findings, as well as a newly developed approach, provides rational design and synthesis of an economical and efficient strategy for bifunctional electrocatalyst development.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000655587000001	33902017

It is also established experimentally that corrosion of metal oxides can, in fact, promote catalytic activity for OER owing to the formation of a surface hydrous amorphous layer. However, the mechanistic interplay between corrosion and OER across metal-oxide catalysts and to what degree these two processes are correlated are still debated. Herein, we employ ab initio molecular dynamics-based blue moon ensemble approach in combination with OER thermodynamic analysis to reveal a clear mechanistic coupling between Ru dissolution and OER at the RuO2(110)/water interface. Specifically, we demonstrate that (i) dynamic transitions between metastable dissolution intermediates greatly affect catalytic activity toward OER, (ii) dissolution and OER processes share common intermediates with OER promoting Ru detachment from the surface, (iii) the lattice oxygen can be involved in the OER, and (iv) the coupling between different OER intermediates formed at the same Ru site of the metastable dissolution state can lower the theoretical overpotential of OER down to 0.2 eV. Collectively, our findings illustrate the critical role of highly reactive metastable dissolution intermediates in facilitating OER and underscore the need for the incorporation of interfacial reaction dynamics to resolve apparent conflicts between theoretically predicted and experimentally measured OER overpotentials.									47	1	0	0	0	0	47			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000486360900034

Here, through the combination of the hot filtration experiment together with the recently developed identical location transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM) method, the delicate structure evolution of highly dispersed Pd NPs supported on oxygen-functionalized carbon nanotubes (Pd/oCNTs) as well as the kinetics properties of derived dissolved species in liquid phase were systemically investigated in the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction. The result indicates that the leached Pd components caused by the strong adsorption of reactants might have a significant contribution to the coupling products, and the degree for different substrates follows the order of iodobenzene > phenylboronic acid > bromobenzene. Meanwhile, the typical three sequential behaviors of supported Pd NPs, including dissolution, deposition, and growth, along with the increase of the conversion throughout the reaction were spatiotemporally observed by tracking the evolution of individually identifiable NPs. The performed work not only provides direct evidence for the interaction between Pd NPs surface with reactants on atomic scale but also gives a valuable reference for fundamentally understanding the mechanism of the heterogeneous Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling process as well as rational design of next-generation catalysts with high efficiency and reusability for synthetic applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000656994100061	33960778

The 3DOM structure was achieved using the colloidal-crystal template method. The 3DOM material had a spinel-like crystal structure with a Mn0.5Ni0.5Co2O4 trimetallic composition and a BET surface area of 67.74 m(2) g(-1). The presence of three different metals with multiple valences in the same crystalline structure, the distribution of pores that facilitate mass transport, and the promotion of oxygen vacancies (O-v) resulted in a highly active bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution (OER) reactions. The 3DOM material presented a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.76 V (vs. RHE) for the ORR and 1.63 V @ 10 mA cm(-2) during the OER, obtaining a differential potential (Delta E = E-j=10 - E-1/2) of Delta E = 0.87 V. In addition, the 3DOM catalyst possessed stability; it maintained 100% of its original current after 10 h for the ORR. It was found during the Zn-air battery tests that the use of a trimetallic spinel enabled to obtain an open circuit voltage of 1.38 V and a maximum power density of 117 mW cm(-2). Additionally, this spinel displayed excellent bifunctional behavior, with superior stability to benchmarked Pt/C and IrO2/C catalysts after being operated for 21 h during charge-discharge processes.

To date, the rare crustal abundant platinum group metals rule this sector with Pt-alloys being the best for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and ruthenium oxides for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic solution. However, they show poor stability and are too expensive for large scale applications. Moreover, oxygen reduction in basic solutions can otherwise be catalysed by metal oxide with non-precious earth abundant transition metals (e.g. Fe, Co, Ni). Hence, there is a massive demand to explore noble metal free bifunctional electrocatalysts. In this work, we present the electrocatalytic activity of three cobalt based sodium phosphates namely NaCoPO4 (with one phosphate), Na2CoP2O7 (with two phosphate) NaFe2Co(PO4)(3) (with three phosphate). Synthesized by solution combustion route, all these phosphates confirmed phase purity. NaCoPO4 and Na2CoP2O7 adopted orthorhombic structure with Pnma and Pna2(1) space group respectively; whereas NaFe2Co(PO4)(3) crystallized in monoclinic (C2/c) framework. Electrocatalytic activity of these cobalt phosphates were inspected by linear sweep voltammetry with rotating disk electrode (RDE). All three showed promising bifunctional activity. In fact, the ORR activities of both orthorhombic cobalt phosphates are comparable to Vulcan carbon and Pt/C. OER activity of Na2CoP2O7 overrode other phosphates. The bifunctional activity and good stability of these sodium cobalt phosphates stem from cobalt ions and stabilization of the catalytic centres by the phosphate frameworks. The present work builds a detail structure-property correlation in these phosphate systems and also demonstrates the possibility of utilizing these sodium cobalt phosphates as alternate cost-effective, novel electrocatalysts for efficient OER/ORR activity in alkaline solution.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2059-8521			WOS:000431033500003

Cobalt bis(terpyridine) (Co(Terp)(2)) was investigated as a mediator of the Li-O-2 charging reaction using electrochemical, XRD, and mass spectrometry measurements and benchmarked against tetrathiafulvalene (TTF). Significant reductions in reversible potential versus Li+/Li are measured for Co(Terp)(2) and TTF from diglyme to Pyr(14)TFSI:diglyme to Pyr(14)TFSI; attributable to upward shift in the electrode, due to weakening Li+ solvation in this solvent order. Lowering of the reversible potentials has noticeable gains on the kinetics of the charge reaction, and greater reduction in charge overpotential are observed with the cobalt complex: However, using differential electrochemical mass spectrometry reveals that less than 25% of the O-2 consumed on discharge is recovered on charge in the presence of Co(Terp)(2), while TTF enables up to 32% O-2 recovery on charge, CO2 is a significant charging product at voltages greater than 4.0 V vs Li+/Li because of electrolyte decomposition. Further work is:required in order to develop mediators with 100% of oxygen evolution efficiency, and the present finding of the possibility to tune the reversible redox potential of the mediator by changing the solvent will be very useful to achieve this formidable task.									44	3	0	0	7	0	45			1932-7447			WOS:000381236100003

Herein, a reduction-induced dissolution-recrystallization (RIDR) strategy was developed to fabricate a defect-rich yolk-shell Prussian-blue analogue (YS-PBA) by a solvothermal process in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The experimental result indicated that the defect-rich YS-PBA was formed via phase transformation from Co-3[Fe-III(CN)(6)](2) to Co2FeII(CN)(6) induced by the reduction potential of the IPA-PVP couple. The newly synthesized YS-PBA exhibited outstanding OER performance with a low overpotential of 293 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term durability (120 h) in alkaline media.

Developing a non-precious metal oxide catalyst with good electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is very challenging. In this work, nanostructured ZnxCo3-xO4 has been shown as an efficient catalyst with a low overpotential for the OER in 0.1 M KOH solution. Substitution of Co2+ in the spinel oxide Co3O4 with Zn2+ creates a higher number of high-spin Co3+, which is found to be directly correlated with the OER activity of ZnxCo3-xO4. Zn0.8Co2.2O4 (x = 0.8) with the optimum amount of Co2+/Co3+ and high-spin Co3+ content showed a very low overpotential of approximate to 250 mV, at 10 mA cm(-2), with a turnover frequency of approximate to 3 x 10(-3) s(-1) for the OER. The high Faradaic efficiency along with the stability of Zn0.8Co2.2O4 and electrocatalytic activity comparable with that of precious metal oxides indicate that this composition is a promising catalyst for water oxidation.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000453935400045	30456399

In-situ incorporation of Cu, Fe2O3 as well as nitrogen into the carbon matrix using a single gel precursor simplified the synthetic route and divulged bifunctional activity assisting chlorine evolution at anode and oxygen reduction reaction at cathodic counterpart during HCl electrolysis. As a result of synergy between Cu and Fe2O3 in N- doped carbon matrix, enhanced activity and stability is stimulated. Catalyst optimization was executed by varying the weight percentage of metal reactants added during precursor synthesis (2, 5 and 10 wt. %), which rendered different composition of Cu, Fe2O3 and N in the composite with flake-like morphology at same thermal treatment conditions. Electrochemical studies were performed in 0.4 M HCl analogous to industrial waste HCl, to investigate the bifunctional activity of catalyst where Cu-Fe2O3 (5 %)/NC came out to be the most active and exhibited long term stability for 24 hours at onset potential of chlorine evolution. It offered a higher current density of 92.1 mA cm(-2) at 1.7 V vs. RHE during chlorine evolution and comparable activity to that of benchmark noble metal based catalyst along with more positive onset potential and high diffusion limiting current density of 0.78 V vs. RHE and 6 mA cm(-2) during oxygen reduction respectively.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000690906100017

The performance and life of the oxygen carrier play pivotal roles in determining the feasibility and economy of the CL-SMR process. The present research was focused on the evolution of the structure and reducibility of a CeO2-Fe2O3 oxygen carrier during the CL-SMR redox process to further understand the sustainability of the oxygen carrier. The investigated CeO2-Fe2O3 complex oxide exhibited satisfactory performance in the CL-SMR process because of the chemical interaction between Ce and Fe species. A Ce-Fe-O phase equilibrium based on a stable composition of CeO2, Fe3O4, and CeFeO3 formed in the recycled samples. Surface oxygen was removed, which was accompanied by an increase in the concentration of oxygen vacancies and a decrease in the surface area of the recycled samples; these effects resulted in an increase in the high-temperature reducibility and syngas selectivity of the samples. Oxygen mobility was intensified by the Ce-Fe chemical interaction via the formation of CeFeO3 and a micromorphological transformation. These properties counteracted the sintering of the materials and guaranteed the stability of the oxygen carrier in the CL-SMR process.									123	12	0	0	2	0	128			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000331861800003

The RE phosphate minerals were observed and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron back-scattered diffraction analysis, and by transmission electron microscopy. The textures and chemistries of RE phosphate minerals have revealed that monazite-[light RE elements (REE)] and xenotime-(Y) at the rims of apatite and pores are secondary products. Monazite-(light REE) and xenotime-(Y) were found to have been formed by either of two mechanisms: the direct formation during metasomatism occurring after weathering or the formation of rhabdophane containing light REE and Y during weathering and its subsequent decomposition into monazite-(light REE) and xenotime-(Y) during metasomatism. If the latter was the actual reaction pathway, the Ce contents in the secondary monazite suggest a very low atmospheric oxygen level at similar to 2.45 Ga.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1345-6296	1349-3825		WOS:000265599500005

Remarkable progress in the rate of reaction has recently been achieved mainly by using semiconducting organic polymer photocatalysts. In view of the use under harsh oxidative conditions, the development of robust inorganic photocatalysts is highly desired. Here we present a photocatalyst with the unit consisting of a single Au particle and an interconnected cluster of SnO2 nanocrystals with the surface modified with SbCl3 (Au@SnO2-Sb(iii)). Under visible-light irradiation (lambda(ex) = 420 nm), Au@SnO2-Sb(iii) stably produces H2O2 with a rate of 6.1 mM g(-1) h(-1) and an external quantum yield of 1.1%. This striking photocatalytic activity of Au@SnO2-Sb(iii) originates from the action of SnO2-Sb(iii) as a "light antenna" and "electron transporter", the electrocatalytic activity of Au NPs for the two electron-oxygen reduction reaction, the visible-light induced activity of SnO2-Sb(iii) for the oxygen evolution reaction, the weak adsorptivity for H2O2, and the robustness.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000852662100001

Herein, we propose a novel strategy embracing electrospinning and hot-pressing to develop Co-based composites embedded in porous nitrogen-rich carbon nanofibers (ZnCo-NC/NCF) as a freestanding cathode for Li-O-2 batteries. The fabricated electrode is obtained through pyrolysis of bimetallic (ZnCo) zeolitic imidazolate frameworks/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers (BMZIF/PAN). Benefiting from outstanding mechanical strength of electrospun carbon matrix and abundant porosity originated from decomposition of ZIFs as well as fully exposed Co-N-x active sites, the achieved cathode is capable of excellent flexibility, high specific surface area, great conductivity and good catalytic behaviors towards both oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. Consequently, the corresponding Li-O-2 batteries exhibit remarkably decreased voltage gap (0.49 V), high specific areal capacity (9.52 mAh cm(-2)) and long-term cycling capability (around 42 cycles under a curtailing capacity of 0.25 at 0.04 mA cm(-2)). Besides, the evolution of the morphology and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at various reaction states are further investigated, which confirms that ZnCo-NC /NCF cathode enables formation and decomposition of lithium peroxide during charge-discharge period.

We herein report a Co metal-organic framework (MOF, denoted as Co-BTC-IMI), which was synthesized from Co ions, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acids and imidazoles through a hydrothermal reaction. The MOF was studied as an unpyrolyzed bifunctional electrocatalyst in an alkaline half-cell, where it delivered an ORR half-wave potential of 0.80 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an OER potential of 1.59 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2). Co-BTC-IMI possessed good structural stability against hydroxide corrosion and great pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions and, therefore, excellent bifunctional catalytic durability. Structure characterizations demonstrated that one of the Co(ii) ions in Co-BTC-IMI was connected by two O atoms from two different deprotonated 1,3,5-benzenecarboxylic acids, leaving the coordination of Co(ii) largely unsaturated. Further modeling simulations shed light on the advantage of the unsaturated coordination by significantly promoting the interactions with molecular water and oxygen and improving the electronic conductivity, leading to enhanced mass and charge transfer properties. The moderate affinity of oxygen and higher valent Co after water adsorption contributed to the enhanced bifunctional catalytic activity of Co-BTC-IMI as compared to Co-BTC. The overall bifunctional activity of Co-BTC-IMI is promising as compared to the recently reported unpyrolyzed MOFs, as well as the commercial platinum-group metals.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000585127100017

However, inert kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction process generate low round-trip efficiency and poor cyclability. NiO materials are recognized as efficient and low-cost catalysts for Li-O-2 battery. Here, we report a controllable approach to synthesize metal oxide decorated highly conductive Ti3C2 composite as cathode catalyst for rechargeable Li-O-2 battery. In this composite, multi-layered Ti3C2 MXene enacts a superior host to load NiO nanoparticles on account of the open layered structure, the good electronic conductivity and the excellent chemical stability. Serving as Li-O-2 battery cathode catalyst, NiO/Ti3C2 nanomaterials deliver a high initial capacity of 13350 mAh g(-1) and good cycling performance of over 90 rounds at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) and 500 mA g(-1), respectively. Such properties of the prepared composite are attributed to the excellent conductivity of MXene and the high catalytic activity of NiO. As far as we know, this is the prior report that MXenes based materials are made into Li-O-2 battery cathodes catalyst and proved to have a potential application in cathode materials of Li-O-2 battery.

Effect of g-C3N4 on the structure and OER performance of NiFeCr-LDHs are investigated in detail. g-C3N4 can promote the formation of thin NiFeCr-LDHs nanosheets, thereby enhancing both the number of active sites and OER activity. X-ray photoelectron spectra measurements confirm the electronic interaction between g-C3N4 and NiFeCr-LDHs nanosheets. The OER performance of NiFeCr-LDHs/g-C3N4 hybrids highly relates to the weight ratio of g-C(3)N(4 )to NiFeCr-LDHs. When the weight ratio of g-C3N4 to NiFeCr-LDHs is 5%, the corresponding electrocatalyst shows the best OER activity. The component optimized NiFeCr-LDHs/g-C3N4 hybrids display the overpotential of similar to 223 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 89 mV dec(-1) for OER in 1 M KOH solution, which is better than that of pristine NiFeCr-LDHs, bare g-C3N4, and commercial RuO2.									10	2	0	0	0	0	10			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000487212100001	31443099

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key electrochemical process of metal-air batteries. The sluggish nature of ORR kinetics and the high cost of Pt-based ORR catalysts have severely hindered their large-scale application. As earth-abundant elements, the iron group elements have a variety of hybrid orbitals, and their incorporation into the carbon skeleton achieves good ORR catalytic activity, giving them great potential for substituting for Pt-based catalysts. Here, their uses for ORR and the function of each active site in the ORR process are summarized. The relationship between the microstructure and performance of these catalysts may help us fully understand the role of iron group elements in ORR and provide basic insight into the design of cheap catalysts with outstanding ORR catalytic performance in the future.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1872-5805		WOS:000686551900002

Herein, a new family of TMDs, Janus TMDs, as ORR catalyst has been investigated by employing the density functional methods. Our results indicated that the pristine Janus TMDs (MoXY, X, Y=S, Se, Te; X not equal Y) and MoXY with X vacancy have poor ORR activity. In contrast, MoXY with Mo vacancy, i. e., MoXY-SV-Mo are good ORR catalysts due to the moderate adsorption strength of the ORR intermediates. In particular, MoSeS-SV-Mo possess the highest ORR activity with a low overpotential of 0.51 V. In addition, the ORR activity is slightly improved under tensile strain, while the compressive strain reduces the ORR activity. These results demonstrated that creating Mo vacancy in MoXY can modulate the ORR activity of Janus TMDs effectively.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			2196-0216			WOS:000582951400010

Because of intrinsic oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) via water splitting, aqueous batteries possess narrow electrochemical stability windows (ESWs, theoretical ESW is 1.23 V), leading to low output voltage and low delivered capacity, and thus low energy density. Meanwhile, the parasitic side reactions of electrode materials dissolution, gas evolution, and dendrite growth can shorten cyclic stability of aqueous batteries. The above deep-seated challenges are closely related to the solvation structure of metal ions, which can be settled by adjusting and regulating the solvation structure. This review summarizes the research progress in solvation structures in metal-ion batteries. First, the design principles of the solvation structure and its impact on battery performance are introduced. Second, the regulation of the solvation structure and the research progress are introduced from three points of view: high concentration salt strategies, MOF modification and electrolyte additives. After that, the commonly used characterization methods for solvation structure are summarized. Finally, the existing problems and challenges in the frontier research of solvation structure research are summarized.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000839399000001

Glassy Carbon Substrate Oxidation Effects on Electrode Stability for Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalysis Stability Benchmarking								ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS											10.1021/acsaem.2c01690		SEP 2022			2022	Employing benchmarking metrics to capture the activity and stability of electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid is a critical practice that enables meaningful comparison of catalyst material candidates reported throughout the literature. In this work, we find that ubiquitously used glassy carbon electrode substrates oxidize under typical OER operating conditions, forming a pacified, electrically insulating, and oxygen-rich surface layer that causes drastic loss of current density over the course of extended chronoamperometric stability tests at an anodic potential of 1.7 VRHE. We show that the experimentally observed stability of glassy carbon-based electrodes is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that expected solely from dissolution-based catalyst intrinsic stability of Ir-based catalysts. We additionally find that glassy carbon-based electrode stability measured by chronoamperometric holds is greatly impacted by catalyst loading, with high catalyst loadings improving the stability of the overall electrode via a protective effect on the glassy carbon substrate. Overall, our investigation highlights that glassy carbon is not electrochemically inert under OER conditions on the timescale of common stability tests, which can cause electrodes to exhibit performance losses that do not reflect the intrinsic stability of the actual catalyst material being investigated. In light of our findings, we underscore the usefulness of metrics, such as the S-number, to reflect intrinsic catalyst material stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000860691800001

Herein, a 2D self-supporting catalytic electrode with stability is designed to obtain hydrogen on a large scale from alkaline sim-ulated seawater (1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl, pH = 14). Specifically, the amorphous NiB active materials are modified on the surface of Ti plate by electroless plating with different time without adding binders and other additives, and Ti@NiB bifunctional catalytic electrode is simply prepared at room temperature.

In this work we have filled this gap by experimentally and theoretically examining the growth and detachment dynamics of oxygen bubbles from hydrogen peroxide decomposition catalyzed by gold. We measured the bubble radius R(t) as a function of time by confocal microscopy and find R(t) alpha t(1/2). This diffusive growth behavior demonstrates that the bubbles grow from an oxygen-oversaturated environment. For several consecutive bubbles detaching from the same position in a short period of time, a well-repeated growing behavior is obtained from which we conclude the absence of noticeable depletion effect of oxygen from previous bubbles or increasing oversaturation from the gas production. In contrast, for two bubbles far apart either in space or in time, substantial discrepancies in their growth rates are observed, which we attribute to the variation in the local gas oversaturation. The current results show that the dynamical evolution of bubbles is influenced by comprehensive effects combining chemical catalysis and physical mass transfer. Finally, we find that the size of the bubbles at the moment of detachment is determined by the balance between buoyancy and surface tension and by the detailed geometry at the bubbles contact line.									26	0	0	0	2	0	26			1932-7447			WOS:000412150500026	28983387	
C	Herzig, A.; Johlitz, M.; Lion, A.						Lion, A; Johlitz, M		Modelling of reaction-diffusion induced oxidation of elastomers in two spatial dimensions by means of ADI method								CONSTITUTIVE MODELS FOR RUBBER X								33	38						2017	2017	In the majority of applications ageing of elastomers is affected by heterogeneous effects. Probably the most important one is the influence of oxygen from the ambient environment. Oxygen molecules are absorbed by the surface layer and get transported into the interior by diffusion before reactions with the elastomer structure occur. Besides the mechanical properties, thermo-oxidative reactions affect the diffusion process itself and hence the prediction of oxidation is a current challenge when modelling ageing. This work provides a reaction-diffusion approach based on Fick's second law of diffusion. Diffusivity is described as a function of temperature and ageing to simulate the decreasing permeability by progressing oxidation. In order to describe the reaction rate of oxidation an Arrhenius approach is chosen which considers the available amount of oxygen. The progress of ageing is given by an evolution equation depending on temperature and reaction rate. Since heterogeneous oxidation is influenced by the shape and size of the elastomer sample, the model is solved and visualized in two spatial dimension using Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method. This numerical algorithm is able to solve the developed model with unconditional stability and sufficient accuracy. This work illustrates the effect of ageing on diffusivity and is able to simulate Diffusion-Limited-Oxidation (DLO) which is a key factor of heterogeneous oxidation.					10th European Conference on Constitutive Models for Rubber (ECCMR)10th European Conference on Constitutive Models for Rubber (ECCMR)	AUG 28-31, 2017AUG 28-31, 2017	Springer; Netzsch; Michelin; Endurica; Brabender; Boge Rubber & Plast; SynoptSpringer; Netzsch; Michelin; Endurica; Brabender; Boge Rubber & Plast; Synopt	Munich, GERMANYMunich, GERMANY	1	0	0	0	0	0	1					978-1-315-22327-8; 978-1-138-03001-5	WOS:000582430100004

Herein, a series of quantum-sized metal nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on nickel metal-organic framework nanohybrids (M@Ni-MOF, M=Ru, Ir, Pd) are rationally developed through a spontaneous redox strategy. The metal-oxygen bonds between the NPs and Ni-MOF guarantee structural stability and sufficient exposure of the surface active sites. More importantly, such precise interfacial feature can effectively modulate the electronic structure of hybrids through the charge transfer of the formed Ni-O-M bridge and then improves the reaction kinetics. As a result, the representative Ru@Ni-MOF exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at all pH values, even superior to commercial Pt/C and recent noble-metal catalysts. Theoretical calculations deepen the mechanism understanding of the superior HER performance of Ru@Ni-MOF through the optimized adsorption free energies of water and hydrogen due to the interfacial-bond-induced electron redistribution.									73	1	0	0	7	0	72			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000694627200001	34427019

In this report, 3D mesoporous NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) microclusters with a hierarchical architecture are in situ grown on Ni foam through a facile and cost-effective one-step hydrothermal method by using Ni foam as both a Ni source and support. Thanks to the unique architecture and strong synergistic electronic effect between Ni and Fe, the as-synthesized NiFe LDH exhibits remarkable catalytic OER performance with a small overpotential of 211 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which outperforms most of the reported non-noble metal-based catalysts and almost all the documented LDH-based electrocatalysts.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2052-1553			WOS:000442606200005

Herein, electrocatalysts of NiNx@Pt nanoparticles deposited on surface of functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been prepared by simple sintering and reduction reaction, and then applied as electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Under alkaline medium, a current density of 610.4 mA mg(Pt)(-1) for MOR is demonstrated which is 1.35 times higher than that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C (451.2 mA mg(Pt)(-1)) catalysts. Besides, the NiNx@Pt/CNT electrocatalyst exhibits more excellent ORR electrocatalytic activity with an onset potential of 0.986 V and half-wave potential of 0.862 V, and an overpotential of 530 mV and low potential gap of 0.89 V for OER. The deposited NiNx nanoparticles not only serve as the center of catalyst with favorable electronic structure, but also effectively prompt the electron transport from Pt nanoparticles to carbon nanotubes. Overall, extraordinary electrocatalysis activity is presented for the versatile NiNx@Pt/CNT electrocatalyst for multiple electrochemical reactions.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0925-9635	1879-0062		WOS:000702866900007

Surface oxides can play a critical role in tuning the surface oxidation state of metal catalysts for a proper binding with CO2RR reaction intermediates, which may significantly improve the catalytic activity and selectivity. Here, we demonstrate the importance of surface-bonded oxygen on silver nanoparticles in altering the reaction pathways and improving the CO2RR performances. A comparative investigation on air-annealed Ag (Air-Ag) catalyst with or without the post-treatment of H-2 thermal annealing (H-2-Ag) was performed. In Air-Ag, the subsurface chemically bonded O species (O-Ag delta+) was identified by angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy techniques, and contributed to the improved CO selectivity rather than H-2 in CO2RR electrolysis. As a result, though the maximal CO Faradaic efficiency of H-2-Ag is at similar to 30%, the Air-Ag catalyst presented a high CO selectivity of more than 90% under a current density of similar to 21 mA/cm(2).									45	2	0	0	3	0	46			2168-0485			WOS:000412382700006

Co4Mo8, H(4)TC4A = p-tert-butylthiacalix[4]arene) was obtained by a solvothermal reaction. Co4Mo8 features a sulfur modified polyoxometalate Mo-8 cluster capped by a Co-4-TC4A unit. Co4Mo8 clusters directly fabricated on nickel foam (NF) were used as working electrodes, giving drastically improved electrocatalytic activities for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 302.8 mV at 10.0 mA cm(-2) in basic media. Upon replacing Co in Co4Mo8 clusters with Ni or Zn, component controlled investigations indicated that the extraordinary OER performance originated from the Co-Mo synergistic effect. Furthermore, the deliberately incorporated sulfur atoms at the lower rim of Co4Mo8 clusters facilitated the adherence between the clusters and NF, resulting in a binder-free electrocatalyst with efficient and ultra-stable OER performance (366.8 mV at 40.0 mA cm(-2) for more than 150 hours).									28	2	0	0	2	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472219400052

As a result, the development of clean energy systems is becoming an urgent focus for the research community. Metal air batteries have attracted much attention due to their extremely high energy density, and the rechargeability which is directly governed by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we present a new class of hybrid bi-functional catalyst consisting of porous nanorod perovskite La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (LSCF-PR) combined with nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NRGO) active towards both ORR and OER. The novel morphology of LSCF-PR is prepared by an electrospinning method, and incorporated into NRGO sheets. Electron microscopy reveals interesting composite morphology in which LSCF-PR is embedded between the sheets of NRGO, forming an efficient LSCF-PR/NRGO composite morphology for the electrochemical oxygen reactions. Electrochemical testing of the LSCF-PR/NRGO composite in alkaline medium results in excellent ORR and OER catalytic activities, verifying the effective combination for bi-functionality. LSCF-PR/NRGO presents not only a comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst for ORR or OER, respectively, but also better durability. These results highlight the applicability of LSCF-PR/NRGO composite having unique and efficient morphology as a promising bi-functional catalyst for metal air battery applications.

However, due to harmful effects of cobalt ions on the cathodic reaction in some processes, these benefits are limited to the electrowinning of copper. Efforts to develop a way of introducing cobalt at the anode-electrolyte interface without interfering with the cathodic reactions are reviewed in this paper. The use of lead-cobalt alloy anodes has had limited success due to issues arising from the low solubility of cobalt in lead, segregation during casting of the alloys, and nonuniform distribution of cobalt which affects the integrity of the anodes. This has been overcome in part lately by inclusion of cobalt into only the surface layer of a lead or lead alloy substrate, by thermal treatment of a cobalt salt to form a catalytic cobalt oxide surface species, or by electrodeposition of composite lead-cobalt oxide anodes. The last approach in particular has been actively investigated by several groups, but to our knowledge it is yet to find application in the industry. The review also critically examines the likely reaction mechanisms involved.									26	5	0	0	0	0	30			0882-7508	1547-7401		WOS:000277668000002

Single-atom catalysts (SAC) with atomic utilization efficiency are among the most promising candidates for oxygen reactions. Focusing on the controllable and efficient synthesis of SACs, we develop a direct rapid pyrolysismethod that shortens the synthesis process from several hours to 1 min. This method can be applied to the synthesis of SACs with transition metals (Fe, Ni, Co, and Mn) with concentrations higher than 2.5 wt %. The optimized Fe, Ni-dual metal catalyst delivers excellent ORR and OER activity and stability. Significantly, the gap between the half-wave potential (E-1/2) of ORR and the potential at 10 mA cm(-2) of OER is only 0.69 V in 0.1 M KOH, which is one of the best results ever reported. The enhanced performance in dual-metal SAC is ascribed to the synergic effects between Fe and Ni atoms. Both breaker and solid-state zinc-air batteries based on the optimized catalysts show high powder densities and long-term cycling performance. This study opens up a new method to synthesize SACs and provide guidance for materials design.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2096-5745		WOS:000864453100012

Particulate IrO2 can agglomerate easily, which can decrease substantially the catalytic surface area required for oxygen evolution reaction, causing the loss of catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, agglomerated IrO2 nanoparticles can have an adverse effect on the oxygen reduction reaction by covering the active surface area of the Pt/C cathode catalyst, which is a damaging factor for the intrinsic performance of PEMFC. Carbon-supported iridium oxide, IrO2/C, which can prevent the agglomeration of Ir nanoparticles more effectively, was synthesized to overcome these problems.Compared to the cell with the Pt/C cathode only, the cell with 10 wt.% IrO2 particles and Pt/C cathode showed stronger durability during fuel starvation but the cell performance at normal operation decreased severely by 35%. The cell with the same amount of IrO2 dispersed on a carbon support, 10 wt.% IrO2/C, showed similar durability during fuel starvation maintaining the cell performance comparable to the cell using a Pt/C cathode only.Carbon-supported IrO2, IrO2/C, was more effective than IrO2 particles in both maintaining the intrinsic performance and improving the cell durability during fuel starvation.

Systematic investigations disclosed that these features had arose from those doped sites, opened porosity and large interface.

This O2 evolution was inhibited completely by 10 mM pyrophosphate or 1.6 mM pyridoxal-5'-phosphate. In contrast to pyrophosphate, the inhibition by pyridoxal-5'-phosphate occurred only when it was added to the reaction system before the onset of light. When PGA-dependent O2 evolution had already commenced the addition of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate had no inhibitory effect. These results suggest that the uptake of PGA by the chloroplasts is a carrier-mediated process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0006-8055			WOS:A1991FZ60800008

The best of these catalysts exhibited a nanosheet-like morphology with an onset potential of 0.95 V and a half-wave potential of 0.87 V in alkaline media, which are comparable to those of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) catalysts. In addition, this catalyst exhibited high stability and methanol resistance. This work not only reveals the effect of L-cysteine amount on the growth process of ZIF, but also provides a strategy for designing various excellent catalysts in the fuel cell field.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2365-6549			WOS:000771395600038

Strong chemical reactions have been observed due to aluminum deposition onto the Alq substrate. The subsequent oxygen exposure releases some of the Alq molecules from the interaction with aluminum. Finally, the deposition of the top Alq layer leads to an asymmetry in the electronic energy level alignment with respect to the AlOx interlayer.

Herein, we proposed a synthesis strategy for the self-assembly of maize-like CoP nanorod arrays with abundant active sites via a combination of conventional hydrothermal reaction and low-temperature phosphorization. This unique architecture exhibited remarkable catalytic performance for the HER, with a low overpotential of 130 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, as well as good stability as verified by chronoamperometry measurement for 10 h. Density functional theory calculations further revealed that these maize-like CoP nanorod arrays with dense active sites and a high phosphorization degree could boost the HER performance in terms of low adsorption energy and free energy.

Herein, a comprehensive investigation was conducted on various NixCoyMnzO4 replicated from large pore KIT-6 silica. The materials were calcined at different temperatures to study the influence of the oxide formation and the resulting pore structure ordering, as well as surface properties, on the electrochemical activity and stability of the catalysts. After a comprehensive characterization, electrocatalytic performances of the materials were investigated in detail for OER to find a structure-activity relationship. In OER, a correlation was established between calcination temperature, pore and surface properties, and the overall efficiency and stability. The best sample, NixCoyMnzO4 calcined at 300 degrees C, provided a reasonable current density (25 mA/cm(2) at 1.7 V vs RHE) and an overpotential of 400 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), and demonstrated increased current density (above 200 mA/cm(2) at 1.7 V vs RHE) once loaded into a Ni foam compared to the bare foam. This sample also remained stable over 15 h. Our results indicate that the calcination temperature greatly affects the porosity, crystalline structure, phase composition, and the activity of the catalysts toward OER.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2574-0962			WOS:000543715100056

Their kinetic properties towards oxygen reduction reaction were studied by a rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique in a temperature range from 1 to 50 degrees C. The SnO2 content of catalyst samples was 5 and 10 wt.%. A quick evaluation of the catalyst activity, electrochemical behavior and average number of transferred electrons were performed using the RDE technique. It has been shown that the use of x-SnO2 (through modification of the carbon support) in a binary system together with Pt does not reduce the catalyst activity in the temperature range of 1-30 degrees C. The temperature rising up to 50 degrees C resulted in composite catalyst activity reduction at about 30%.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000736280200001

Herein, the crystal phase of palladium-copper nanoparticles (PdCu NPs) is controlled to modulate their surface atomic arrangement, which will govern the growth dynamics of discharge products on their surfaces and thus the catalytic performances in non-aqueous lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) batteries. First-principles calculations and experimental validations reveal that homogeneous nucleation and distribution of discharge products are observed on the surface of body-centered cubic PdCu NPs, promoting the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) activities in Li-O-2 batteries. However, the agglomerates formed on the surface of its face-centered cubic homologue deteriorates ORR/OER activities, which worsen the battery performances. For the first time, this work theoretically and experimentally demonstrates how the crystal phase modulation regulates the nucleation behaviors and growth dynamics of discharge products for ORR/OER.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000507320900001

The catalyst synthesized at 500 degrees C (Co-S/NS-rGO500) exhibits the best ORR catalytic activity compared to the other samples, together with high fourelectron selectivity and excellent stability in alkaline medium. Moreover, the Co-S/NS-rGO-500 composite also manifests good ORR activity and selectivity in acid solution. The facile synthesis approach and superior ORR performance in both alkaline and acid electrolytes make the Co-S/NS-rGO catalysts promising as an alternative to commercial Pt/C catalyst for fuel cells.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			2046-2069			WOS:000413944200054

A significant evolution of the catalytic behavior occurs while the working catalyst is in the course of its reorganisation to a Keggin structure. Precisely, a particular species formed in situ and presenting intermediate characteristics between those of Wells-Dawson and Keggin structures exerts a beneficial effect on the selectivity to methyl-ethyl-ketone. This high selectivity towards the oxidative dehydrogenation was however found to be ephemeral and the selectivity decline was correlated to a no proper stabilization of this most active intermediate.

With the growing requirement for clean and renewable energy generation and storage systems, progress in the replacement of expensive noble-metal catalysts with CxNy-based materials as efficient electrocatalysts has expanded considerably, and the demand for these materials has increased. The modified CxNy architectures are beneficial to electrocatalytic applications, improving their moderate electrical conductivities and capacity loss. The present review strives to highlight the recent advances in the research on the aforementioned identities of CxNy-derived materials and their structurally modified polymorphs. This review also discusses the use of CxNy-based materials in fuel cells, metal-air batteries, water splitting cells, and supercapacitor applications. Herein, we deal with electrocatalytic oxidation and reduction reactions such as hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction, CO2 reduction, nitrogen reduction, etc. Each device has been studied for a clearer understanding of the patent applications, and the relevant experiments are reviewed separately. Additionally, the role of CxNy-derived materials in some general redox reactions capable of being exploited in any of the relevant devices is included.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000813180900001

However, most reported bifunctional electrocatalysts feature poor electrocatalytic activity and stability toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we have reported the first-ever study of an effective one-step reduction-assisted exfoliation method to exfoliate bulk vanadium-doped cobalt hydroxide (V-doped Co(OH)(2), denoted as V-Co(OH)(2)) into ultrathin nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies (V-Co(OH)(2)-O-v) and simultaneously anchor them with highly dispersed ultrafine Pt nanoparticles (NPs) with a nominal size of 0.8-2.4 nm (denoted as Pt/V-Co(OH)(2)-O-v). The Pt/V-Co(OH)(2)-O-v catalyst exhibits improved catalytic performance in ORR/OER. X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis and theoretical calculations reveal the strong interfacial electronic interactions between Pt NPs and VCo(OH)(2)-O-v, which synergistically improves oxygen intermediates' adsorption/desorption, enhancing the ORR and OER performance. Using Pt/V-Co(OH)(2)-O-v as a catalyst in the air cathode, a hybrid sodium-air battery displays a record value of an ultralow charging-discharging voltage gap of 0.07 V at a current density of 0.01 mA cm(-2) with remarkable stability of up to 1000 cycles. This reduction-assisted exfoliation approach provides a new strategy to generate oxygen vacancies in metal hydroxides, which act as anchoring sites for deposition of sub-nanometal NPs via a strong interfacial effect.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2574-0962			WOS:000563784400026

Therefore, taking the double particles as an example to explore the conversion process offers a reference for developing sub-models that available for reactor-scale gasification simulation. In this study, a CFD-based model was developed to describe the reaction of double coal char particles in O2/CO2 atmospheres. The influence of Reynolds number and oxygen mole fraction on the flame morphology evolution, the Stefan flow, and the carbon consumption rate were discussed to understand the conversion of the double particles. The results show that the severe reaction area around the double particles gradually migrates towards the front of particle 1 with the increase of oxygen mole fraction, and the area of high-temperature zone decreases multi-modally with the increase of both factors. Reynolds number is the main factor affecting mass transfer. The overall carbon consumption rates of the double particles grow linearly with the increase of the oxygen mole fraction, and the rate of particle 1 is greater than that of particle 2. The Reynolds number has a greater effect on intensifying the difference between the carbon consumption rates of the double particles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000868945500007

This study reports a facile and eco-friendly method to synthesize micro-/mesoporous Co2P/Co-embedded P/N co-doped carbon (Co/P/N-CNP) material through H3PO4-selective-etching ZIF-67 precursor and subsequent pyrolysis. H3PO4 not only acts as an etching agent to engineer ZIF's porosity but also is an ideal phosphorus source for P-doping in carbon matrix and the formation of Co2P, which greatly enriches the electrocatalytic active sites for obtained carbon catalysts. Pyrolyzed hybrid carbon nanomaterial (Co/P/N -CNP) is decorated by multiwalled carbon nanotubes and possesses micro- and mesopores simultaneously, which facilitate the exposure for more active sites and the diffusion of reactive species in the ORR/OER electrocatalytic process. Thanks to the promising physicochemical characteristics, finely-tuned Co/P/N-CNP catalyst manifests excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity compared with commercial Pt/C (for ORR) and RuO2 (for OER) in alkaline media. This simple strategy paves a new avenue for its further application in catalyst fabrication for energy storage and conversion. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a class of CuS/NiS2 interface nanocrystals (INs) catalysts with atomic-level coupled nanointerface, subtle lattice distortion, and plentiful vacancy defects is reported. The results from temperature-dependent in situ synchrotron-based X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy and electron spin resonance spectroscopy demonstrate that the lattice distortion of 14.7% in CuS/NiS2 caused by the strong Jahn-Teller effect of Cu, the strong atomic-level coupled interface of CuS and NiS2 domains, and distinct vacancy defects can provide numerous effective active sites for their excellent bifunctional performance. A liquid Zn-air battery with the CuS/NiS2 INs as air electrode displays a large peak power density (172.4 mW cm(-2)), a high specific capacity (775 mAh g(Zn)(-1)), and long cycle life (up to 83 h), making the CuS/NiS2 INs among the best bifunctional catalysts for Zn-air battery. More remarkably, the flexible CuS/NiS2 INs-based solid-state Zn-air batteries can power the LED after twisting, making them be promising in portable and wearable electronic devices.									163	11	0	0	3	0	167			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000414719300016

In particular the effect of the oxidising or annealing temperature on the properties of Ir0.6Sn0.4O2 nanocrystalline powders has been examined. The synthesised powders were characterised by XRD and electrochemical methods such as cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance. It is believed that a solid solution between iridium oxide and tin oxide has been synthesised. The results show that the annealing temperature influences the crystallinity, electrochemically active surface area, electrode capacity and particle porosity. The best performance overall at low current is achieved when the material has been annealed at 450 degreesC for 30 minutes. More tests need to be completed to find the performance and stability at high currents in PEM electrolysers.									30	1	0	0	0	0	31			1480-2422			WOS:000223927700006

Cobalt-molybdenum bimetal oxide (Co2Mo3O8), as a kind of non-noble transition-metal oxides, is broadly employed as a good OER catalyst due to its abundant active sites. However, the relatively low conductivity of Co2Mo3O8 limits further improvement in its electrocatalytic performance. Herein, the cobalt nanoparticle-modified Co2Mo3O8 flakes are embedded into the flower-like N-doped carbon (NC) microspheres to effectively improve the electrocatalytic OER performance. The combination of Co2Mo3O8 and NC with a flower-like structure effectively improves the conductivity of the material while enhancing the electrolyte penetration. More importantly, the Co nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of Co2Mo3O8 flakes have the capability to furnish more active electrocatalytic active sites. The obtained Co NP-modified Co2Mo3O8 embedded flower-like NC microspheres (Co/Co2Mo3O8@NC) exhibited an overpotential of 288 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2), which was relatively low in comparison to that of commercial RuO2. Besides, the Co/Co2Mo3O8@NC also shows long-term durability almost without attenuation after the 44 000 s I-T test.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2168-0485			WOS:000689137600009

MV enhances the Mehler reaction, i.e. electron transfer from Photosystem I (PSI) to O-2, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the chloroplast. To study the MV tolerance of rcd1, we first addressed chloroplast thiol redox enzymes potentially implicated in ROS scavenging. NADPH-thioredoxin oxidoreductase type C (NTRC) was more reduced in rcd1. NTRC contributed to the photosynthetic and metabolic phenotypes of rcd1, but did not determine its MV tolerance. We next tested rcd1 for alterations in the Mehler reaction. In rcd1, but not in the wild type, the PSI-to-MV electron transfer was abolished by hypoxic atmosphere. A characteristic feature of rcd1 is constitutive expression of mitochondrial dysfunction stimulon (MDS) genes that affect mitochondrial respiration. Similarly to rcd1, in other MDS-overexpressing plants hypoxia also inhibited the PSI-to-MV electron transfer. One possible explanation is that the MDS gene products may affect the Mehler reaction by altering the availability of O-2. In green tissues, this putative effect is masked by photosynthetic O-2 evolution. However, O-2 evolution was rapidly suppressed in MV-treated plants. Transcriptomic meta-analysis indicated that MDS gene expression is linked to hypoxic response not only under MV, but also in standard growth conditions.This article is part of the theme issue 'Retrograde signalling from endosymbiotic organelles'.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000531411500016	32362253	
J	Meng, Tao; Cao, Minhua								Interfacial Electronic and Structural Reorganization in Mn2Co2C/MnO for Enhancing Oxygen Evolution Kinetics and Active Sites								ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING				8	35			13271	13281		10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c03462				SEP 8 2020	2020	Interface electronic and structural reorganization in metal-based/support catalysts will unlock great potential for realizing their high efficiency electrocatalytic activities. Herein, we employ Mn2Co2C/MnO as a model catalyst to highlight the important role of charge distribution and atomic disorder at the interface for realizing high-performance water splitting. Mn2Co2C/MnO with abundant atomic interfaces was first prepared by the carbonization of Mn-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)center dot 9H(2)O/polyvinyl pyrrolidone via a one-step pyrolysis strategy. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy in combination with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy discloses a negative charge transfer from MnO to Mn2Co2C, thus endowing MnO with a high oxidation state, and meanwhile, extended X-ray absorption fine structure further confirms that there also exist disordered Mn/O atoms and/or dangling bonds in the interface region. On the one hand, MnO with a high oxidation state is more electrophilic, which is particularly favorable for initial electrochemical adsorption of OH- for achieving accelerated oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. On the other hand, the disordered Mn/O atoms and/or dangling bonds in the interface region could act as extra active sites for adsorption and catalysis. Benefiting from the electronic and structural advantages, Mn2Co2C/MnO displays excellent OER performances in terms of a small overpotential (320 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), fast kinetics, and robust stability. This work opens the door for deep understanding of the atomic interface-performance relationship in water splitting, and meanwhile, this concept can be extended to design other energy-related electrode materials.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2168-0485			WOS:000571390000017

This review mainly describes the recent development of these catalysts for use in anode and cathode of PEFCs and PEM water electrolyzers. Performance of the developed catalysts and strategies of the development are summarized. This review aimed to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the metallomacrocycle-based catalysts compared to conventional Pt electrocatalysts, and to emphasize their functions that the Pt catalyst does not have.

J	Bowker, Michael								Sustainable hydrogen production by the application of ambient temperature photocatalysis								GREEN CHEMISTRY				13	9			2235	2246		10.1039/c1gc00022e				2011	2011	Hydrogen production by water splitting is a holy grail of science, being one route to a non-fossil fuel and a potential source of clean energy. It is essential to use a non-polluting energy source to drive the reaction and one way is to utilise sunlight energy, combined with a way to overcome the kinetic limitations of the reaction. The production of hydrogen by the photocatalytic cleavage of water can overcome these energetic hurdles. This area of science is briefly reviewed here, focussing on two routes, namely i) the use of sacrificial agents such as alcohols to act as oxygen scavengers and liberate hydrogen only and ii) by direct water splitting to produce both hydrogen and oxygen. The factors which are important in determining the characteristics of effective photocatalytic water splitting systems are elucidated.									131	5	0	0	10	0	132			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000294437300001

The nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)(2)) and nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) redox pair is one of the most attractive materials for electrocatalytic oxygen evolving reaction (OER) with low overpotential. However, its reaction mechanism has not yet been fully understood. Their band structures and visualized pseudo-charge density contributions indicate hydrogen interaction between the layers in the beta-Ni(OH)(2). In the experimental electrocatalytic OER reaction, the Fe atom is required; the structure is called NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH). We report the Fe effect in the monolayer Ni(OH), framework as the surface model of NiFe-LDH. The Fe atom is suitable for receiving electrons from substrate waters. This study provides crucial basic information for the OER mechanism on the surface of Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox pairs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447			WOS:000415140400027

Currently, 3D foam (such as Ni foam, Cu foam, and graphene foam) based heterogeneous catalysts have been intensively explored for actively catalyzing the electrode reactions. Their inherent characteristics of stereonetwork structure, high specific area and large pore volume not only provide better mass transport of reactants to electrode surfaces, but also pave 3D electron transport pathways. Herein, recent significant progress and rational design of foambased electrocatalysts are reviewed. In addition, some insights into current challenges and future directions of foams for efficient electrocatalysis are proposed and discussed.									208	7	0	0	7	0	209			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000403016400002

Renewable production of hydrogen, via electrolytic water splitting, could be key to moving beyond fossil fuel reliance, but research has mainly focused on maximising efficiency to increase the performance of the electrolysis process. Access to cheap, renewable earth abundant materials to produce hydrogen could be argued to be of equal importance. Electron-coupled proton buffers (ECPBs) have been shown to separate the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions of water electrolysis (OER and HER) in space and time, but have previously relied on precious metal catalysts to produce H-2. Herein, we report the use of four earth abundant catalysts capable of spontaneously evolving hydrogen from reduced ECPBs. The hydrogen production rate was found to be influenced by both the onset potential of the HER for a particular catalyst, and the redox potential of the ECPB used. The catalysts were shown to evolve hydrogen at rates up to 9.4 mmol H-2 per h per mg catalyst and up to 60% of the theoretical maximum hydrogen capacity of the ECPBs.									21	2	0	0	2	0	22			2398-4902			WOS:000422789600011

However,, catalyst :With high activity, easy fabrication process, and low cost is still a daunting challenge. In this work, low-cost BaCO3 nanorods have been demonstrated as efficient electrocatalysts toward the ORR in alkaline media for the first time. The activity of. BaCO3 nanorods can be further enhanced by hybridizing with reduced: graphene oxide (BaCO3/rGO). The mechanism-of ORR on the surface of BaCO3 catalyst was investigated via in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy.(in situ EC-Ratrian). Our findings suggest that the barium ions on the surface of catalyst play a key role in the adsorption of oxygen Molecules and the formation/decomposition of intermediates. This work provides ail important insight into the catalytic activity of BaCO3 for ORR, which can serve as a guide for the design of alkali-earth metal carbonate-based. catalyst.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1932-7447			WOS:000385607000015

In this work, sulfur-rich colloidal nickel sulfides (NiSx) are prepared as OER/ORR bifunctional catalysts via a two-step hydrothermal process. The NiSx nanoparticles (NPs) with large surface area show high OER activity and excellent stability, as evidenced by low overpotential of 301 mV, small Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1) and high stability over 20 h of chronopotentiometry test. Due to their sulfur-rich nature (i. e. Ni3S4 and NiS2), the obtained NiSx also exhibit good ORR activity. The introduction of graphene oxide (GO) in the starting materials leads to the formation of a composite catalyst composed of conductive sulfur-doped reduced graphene oxide (S-rGO) and NiSx. A high ORR onset potential of 0.91 V (vs. RHE) is obtained from the sulfur-rich NiSx NPs coupled with the S-rGO which facilitates the electron-transfer and furnishes the bifunctional catalytic activity. Rechargeable Zn-air batteries with NiSx/S-rGO bifunctional catalyst deliver stable charge and discharge voltages of 2.1 and 1.1 V over 590 cycles. Furthermore, all-solid-state and foldable Zn-air batteries using pliable and robust air cathodes of NiSx/S-rGO show similar voltage profile as their non-foldable counterparts. The foldable batteries exhibit stable cycling performance for up to 120 discharge/charge cycles at either flat or folded state, proving their high electrochemical and mechanical stability.									30	4	0	0	2	0	30			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000459333500010

The development of efficient, durable, Earth-abundant and cheap electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction is a scorching area of research. The oxygen evolution reaction has huge potential for fuel cell and metal-air battery applications. Herein, we reported interfacially interacted and uniformly decorated Co3O4-NiO hybrid nanostructures formed by a metal-organic framework (Co-2-BDC(OH)(2)) using BDC as a linker to the metal center. The fine nanosheets of Co-2-BDC(OH)(2) were first uniformly grown over the honeycomb-like structure of nickel foam (NF). After controlled calcination of these nanosheets/NF composites, a uniformly decorated, binder-free Co3O4-NiO/NF electrocatalyst was synthesized. The transformation of Co-2-BDC(OH)(2)/NF into Co3O4-NiO/NF was characterized by several techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, etc. The catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 311 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) current density. The catalyst also shows long-term stability (24 h) with a Tafel slope value of 90 mV dec(-1).

The surface redox process commences at about 0.75 V in acid solution and is related to the initial oxygen-containing species reversibly electroadsorbed on platinum. Platinum coated with an oxide layer formed through a potentiodynamic routine presents a reversible charge storage process at about 1.6 V in acid solution. The corresponding reaction can be interpreted as a reversible redox couple involving Pt(II)-Pt(IV) and proton injection in the platinum oxide matrix. The charge contribution of the second redox system is smaller than the total oxide charge accumulated on the substrate.

USE - The membrane-free electrochemical reactor and fuel-cell is used for producing H2O2. ADVANTAGE - Provided are electrochemical advanced oxidation process devices and catalysts for efficient, stable, scalable, and decentralized H2O2 production; ideally that can operate in either a fuel cell mode or an electrolyzer mode. The decomposition of H2O2 product is minimized. As H2O2 can be readily decomposed by transition metals and reductive organic compounds, the main body of the device is composed of an inert plastic of a relatively simple design that will also help reduce manufacturing costs. The device is operated at sufficiently high current densities and low applied cell potentials to achieve a large production rates with high current efficiency. Thus, in addition to the proper H2O2 production catalyst at the cathode, the anode is highly active for oxidation reaction and stable during operation. The device is stable and product crossover is minimized to prevent oxidation of H2O2 on the anode. The membrane-free system can also prevent product crossover which is essential for cell durability. Membrane removal may further reduce the applied potential by lowering the overall ohmic loss. These advantages allow the device to be highly practical and readily scalable for use in de-centralized applications, e.g. in developing areas for clean drinking water. Optimization using a continuous flow configuration and stabilizer additives is underway to prevent the self-decomposition of H2O2 and to increase the product concentration. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A membrane-free electrochemical reactor and fuel-cell comprises (i) a collection chamber disposed between a first chamber and a second chamber, where the first chamber and the second chamber are sealably connected to the collection chamber; (ii) a mesoporous carbon paper cathode, and a mesoporous carbon paper anode, where the mesoporous carbon paper cathode is disposed between the first chamber and the collection chamber, where the mesoporous carbon paper anode is disposed between the second chamber and the collection chamber, where the mesoporous carbon paper cathode is coated with an Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) catalyst, where the ORR catalyst imparts a two-electron partial reduction reaction to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), where the mesoporous carbon paper anode is coated with an Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) coating or a Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction (HOR) coating; (iii) an oxygen/air input port, and an oxygen/air output port, where the oxygen/air input port is connected to the first chamber, where the oxygen/air output port is connected to the first chamber; (iv) a KOH/water input port, and a KOH/water output port, where the KOH/water input port is connected to the second chamber, where the KOH/water output port is connected to the second chamber, where the KOH/water input port and the KOH/water output port are in an open state under an electrolyzer operation mode; (v) a H2/water input port, and a H2/water output port, where the H2/water input port is connected to the second chamber, where the H2/water output port is connected to the second chamber, where the H2/water input port and the H2/water output port are in an open state under a fuel-cell operation mode; (vi) a second KOH/water input port connected to the collection chamber; and (vii) a H2O2/KOH/water output port connected to the collection chamber.

J	Sasidharachari, Kammari; Cho, Kuk Young; Yoon, Sukeun					YOON, SUKEUN/0000-0002-2018-9504			Mesoporous ZnMn2O4 Nanospheres as a Nonprecious Bifunctional Catalyst for Zn-Air Batteries								ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS				3	4			3293	3301		10.1021/acsaem.9b02294				APR 27 2020	2020	The rapid and effective transfer of chemical reactants to solid surfaces through a mesoporous structure is essential for enhancing the catalytic performance of nanomaterials. Such materials are essential for realizing durable, nonpreciousmetal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Herein, highly reactant-accessible and mesoporous ZnMn2O4 nanospheres have been prepared via solvothermal synthesis. The nanospheres demonstrate excellent catalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction in an aqueous alkaline solution. Moreover, compared with commercial 20 wt % platinum on carbon black, IrO2, and RuO2, the mesoporous ZnMn2O4 catalyst exhibits lower charge- discharge voltage gaps, good cycling stability, and improved round-trip efficiency. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the developed catalyst is attributed to the high specific surface area, numerous reaction sites by defective O-2(-) (O-ads) species, and sufficient structural stability of the ZnMn2O4 material. The achievements presented in this work are of great importance for the development of outstanding non-noble spinel electrocatalysts for Zn-air batteries.									12	0	0	0	2	0	11			2574-0962			WOS:000529190300023

Here, density functional theory is applied to investigate the oxidative decomposition of the electrolyte component, ethylene carbonate (EC), on layered LixMO(2) oxide surfaces. We compare adsorption energy trends of atoms and small molecules, on both surface oxygen and metal sites, as a function of the Li content of the surface. The oxygen sites are identified as the reactive site for the electrolyte oxidation reaction (EOR). We report reaction energies and NEB-calculated kinetic barriers for the initial oxidative decomposition of EC, and correlate both with the reaction energy of hydrogen adsorption on oxygen. The hydrogen adsorption energy scales with the distance between the Fermi level and the O-2p band center. We expect this model of the EOR to be valid for other organic electrolytes and other Li metal oxide surfaces, due to its simplicity, and the model leads to simple design principles for protective coatings.									42	0	0	0	2	0	42			1932-7447			WOS:000432753700016

Pyrolysis temperature and time have a remarkable impact on the content and the type of the nitrogen-containing functional groups in the NMCC catalysts, which affect their catalytic activity and stability. Based on the analysis of the nitrogen functional groups before and after the stability tests, the ORR active sites of the NMCC catalysts are proposed to be pyridinic-N and quaternary-N functional groups. However the pyridinic-N group is not stable in the acidic environment due to the protonation reaction. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

CaCl2 and NH4Cl activators were utilized to corrode the cornstalks in order to create a mesopore N-doped hybrid structure that was sufficiently stable under the high -temperature pyrolysis process, which prevented neighboring aggregates of transition metals. The synergistic effect of N, B and Fe, Co within the hierarchical biochar structures guaranteed a favorable ORR activity of 0.848 V and OER activity of 393 mV for the CaCl2 sample, showed better stability than commercial Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1566-7367	1873-3905		WOS:000873989900003

A comparative study								INDIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY SECTION A-INORGANIC BIO-INORGANIC PHYSICAL THEORETICAL & ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				58	12			1295	1301						DEC 2019	2019	The present study is concerned with the preparation of perovskite-type oxide film electrodes of La, Cu and Co having composition La1-xCuxCoO3 (0 <= x <= 0.8) on Ni conducting support and study of their electrocatalytic properties towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. Materials have been synthesized by using malic acid sol-gel route at pH 4.00. X-ray diffraction study of the material indicated the formation of almost pure perovskite phase with hexagonal crystal geometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the material has been determined in three electrode single compartment glass cell. Techniques used in the electrochemical studies are cyclic voltammetry (CV), oxide roughness factor and anodic polarization (Tafel plot). Each cyclic voltammogram exhibits an anodic and a corresponding cathodic peak prior to the oxygen evolution reaction. The observed anodic and cathodic peak potential values are 553 +/- 31 and 312 +/- 27 mV, respectively. The study of anodic polarization curve indicates that the oxide with 0.6 mol Cu-substitution (j(a) = 182.4 mA cm(-2) at 750 mV) shows highest electrocatalytic activity with lowest Tafel slope value (b = 65 mV decade(-1)) towards OER. Thermodynamic properties of the material have also been investigated by recording the anodic polarization curve at different temperatures. The value of electrochemical activation energy has been found to be lowest with most active 0.6 mol Cu-substituted oxide material. Electrocatalytic activities of the oxide electrodes, so obtained, have been compared with the similar oxide prepared at 3.75 pH.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0376-4710	0975-0975		WOS:000518085700001

The combustion experiments were carried out using a fluidized-bed reactor connected online to a FTIR gas cell. Spectra were collected every 2 s during the transient combustion reaction, and with this information, very detailed and quantitative evolution profiles for NO, N2O, and CO2 were determined. This approach is an option for tracking combustion products in very fast reactions, such as those that take place in combustion reactions with enriched oxygen. The analytical methodology described herein includes sample preparation, selection of experimental parameters, and data processing. The procedure used in this research can be applied to the characterization of gaseous effluents in any continuous process.									14	2	0	0	0	1	17			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000283111000029

The oxygen defective support can be employed as traps to capture metal species, which provides an effective pathway to synthesize SACs. Here, we propose a counterions-assisted oxygen-driven defect capture (CODC) strategy to fabricate a series of atomically dispersed Co-based catalysts with different electronic and coordination environments. When serving as cathode for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), the triiodine reduction reaction (IRR) activity is very sensitive to the coordination structure. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the intrinsic electronic distributions, electron-donating ability, and energy level position determine the coordination behavior and catalytic performance of SACs. Our findings not only define an efficient synthetic strategy to a broad class of M-NxCy based SACs for highly-efficient IRR, but also provide an insight for exploring coordination-sensitive reaction from the atomic view.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000703208000006

As a research hotspot of transition metal phosphides, exploring their mechanism of catalytic activity and the influence of unique morphology is of great significance. In this study, a series of yolk-shell structure catalysts are fabricated only by pyrolyzing cyclophosphazene microspheres and metal salt without using any other templates, which M2P (M =Fe, Co, Ni) act as the core and N, P co-doped carbon as the shell. The yolk-shell structures aim to overcome the inferior conductivity and aggregation problems traditionally existed in application of transition metal phosphides through combination of transition metal phosphides and doped carbon materials. The prepared Fe2P/NPC, Co2P/NPC and Ni2P/NPC catalysts exhibit excellent ORR catalytic activity through the four-electron pathway, together with large electrochemically active surface area, superior stability and admiring methanol tolerance.									21	2	0	0	0	0	21			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000463960000020

This finding is used to develop a theory for the chain oxidation of metal sulfides to form oxysulfide complexes MSO x and gaseous SO. The main steps of the metal sulfide oxidation via a chain mechanism are thermodynamically characterized. The Gibbs energies of the oxidation reactions are shown to decrease in the absolute value relative to the type of sulfide as follows: FeS, Ni3S2, CoS, NiS, ZnS, PbS, CdS, CuS, and Cu2S. The thermodynamic probability of all steps of the chain oxidation of the monosulfides with the evolution of gaseous atomic oxygen and sulfur is estimated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0036-0295			INSPEC:10910609

Furthermore, it is plausible that the relative spallation rates in the halo and the disc could lead to the beryllium-oxygen relationship observed at higher metallicities.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0035-8711			WOS:A1995QK65900025

The modern energy conversion and storage devices required high efficient and stable electrocatalysts to fulfil the market demands. In previous years, we are witness for considerable developments of scientific attention in Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) and their derived nanomaterials in electrocatalysis. In current review article, we have discussed the progress of optimistic strategies and approaches for the manufacturing of MOF-derived functional materials and their presentation as electrocatalysts for significant energy related reactions. MOFs functioning as a self-sacrificing template bid different benefits for the preparation of metal nanostructures, metal oxides and carbon-abundant materials promoting through the porous structure, organic functionalities, abundance of metal sites and large surface area. Thorough study for the recent advancement in the MOF-derived materials, metal-coordinated N-doped carbons with single-atom active sites are emerging candidates for future commercial applications. However, there are some tasks that should be addressed, to attain improved, appreciative and controlled structural parameters for catalytic and chemical behavior.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1527-8999	1528-0691		WOS:000750915600001	35119193

The total concentration of hydrogen peroxide used in the treatment would be the contribution of the stoichiometric concentration that reacts with the organic matter ([H2O2](0) = 2.0 mM) and the excess of oxidant that decomposes to oxygen, through radical mechanisms, according to a ratio of 0.8164 mmol H2O2 mg(-1) O-2. When operating at concentrations lower than [H2O2](0) = 2.0 mM, oxygen is not released because there is no excess of oxidant. Moreover, it is verified that the ferrous ion catalyst is oxidized to ferric ion and its subsequent regeneration to ferrous ion. Working at concentrations higher than [H2O2](0) = 2.0 mM, oxygen is released in the water, verifying that the catalyst remains as ferric species, which does not regenerate. The reaction time in which oxygen evolution happpens depends on the concentration of catalyst used in the oxidation, verifying that the highest oxygen generation rates are obtained when applying [Fe](0) = 10.0 mg L-1. Once generated in the water, the maximum concentration of oxygen begins to decrease as the hydrogen peroxide is consumed, until reaching a constant value. The stages of formation and decrease of oxygen are adjusted to zero-order kinetics, estimating the kinetics constants as a function of the catalyst concentration: k(f) = 29.48 [Fe](0)(-1.25) (mg O-2 L-1 min(-1)) and k(d) = -0.006 [Fe](0) (2.0) + 0.244 [Fe](0)-3.69 (mg O-2 L-1 min(-1)).[GRAPHICS].									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0959-3330	1479-487X		WOS:000475007000001	31264511

I see ibid., vol.118, no.11, 1870 (1971). Electrochemical machining (ECM) of mild steel in NaCl, NaClO4, and NaNO3 solutions was studied in a closed-cell system. The anodic processes are found to be different in the various solutions. In NaCl, the anodic reaction is essentially iron dissolution. In NaNO3, however, most of the current is expended for oxygen generation due to the presence of an electronically conductive oxide film. A small amount of oxygen (less than approximately 10% of the current) is observed in the NaClO4 system. The cathodic reaction in both NaCl and NaClO4 solutions is hydrogen evolution. In the case of NaNO3, little or no hydrogen is observed-the current is mainly consumed in reducing NO3- ions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651			INSPEC:354307

Aside from the search for new electrocatalytically active materials, in-depth understanding of electrode surface properties may contribute to more efficient utilization of known electrocatalysts. SECM is applied in the sample generation/tip collection mode to determine the spatial distribution of electrocatalytic activity during Cl-2 evolution at the solid/liquid interface of dimensionally stable anodes.

The overpotential of cobaltite electrodes was found to decrease with time, while cyclic voltammetry shows the appearance of redox peaks characteristic of Co(OH)(2)/CoOOH. This is accompanied with increasing effective capacitance estimated from the impedance spectroscopy data, because of roughening of the ceramic surface. The steady-state polarization curves of (La,Sr)CoO3-delta in the OER range, including the Tafel slope, are very similar to those of model Co(OH)(2)-La(OH)(3) composite films where the introduction of lanthanum hydroxide leads to decreasing electrochemical activity. La2NiO4-based anodes exhibit a low electrochemical performance and poor stability. The effects of oxygen nonstoichiometry of the perovskite-related phases are rather negligible at high overpotentials but become significant when the polarization decreases, a result of increasing role of oxygen intercalation processes. The maximum electrocatalytic activity to OER was observed for A-site-deficient (La0.3Sr0.7)(0.97)CoO3-delta, where the lanthanum content is relatively low and the Co4+ concentration determined by thermogravimetric analysis is highest compared to other cobaltites. Applying microporous layers made of template-synthesized nanocrystalline (La0.3Sr0.7)(0.97)CoO3-delta leads to an improved anode performance, although the effects of microstructure and thickness are modest, suggesting a narrow electrochemical reaction zone. Further enhancement of the OER kinetics can be achieved by electrodeposition of cobalt hydroxide- and nickel hydroxide- based films.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1432-8488			WOS:000253682800004

Herein, LSM-YSZ:PrOx composite is developed as an active electrocatalyst for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. A single step PrOx infiltration into LSM-YSZ lowers the polarization resistance (R-p) 10-20 times depending on the test temperature. Distribution of relaxation times (DRT) calculation reveals that adding PrOx affects surface exchange between adsorbed/desorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen, and oxygen dissociative adsorption/desorption. A symmetrical cell with a thin YSZ electrolyte sandwiched between thick LSM-YSZ:PrOx electrode-supports is developed and its oxygen generation performance and stability are evaluated under various current densities and temperatures. Reversible solid oxide cell (ReSOC) performance is also reported for LSM-YSZ:PrOx supported cells with the oxide fuel electrode Sr-0.95(Ti0.3Fe0.63Ni0.07)O3-delta (STFN).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000790382400003

The anolyte and catholyte are separated by an alkali-metal-ion (Li+-ion or Nation) solid-electrolyte separator in which the alkali metal ion serves as an ionic mediator to sustain the redox reactions at the anode and cathode. Coupling the acidic air cathode with the alkaline iron anode demonstrates a voltage-enhanced Fe-air battery. To reduce the cell overpotential, the Fe-air battery is operated with decoupled bifunctional air cathodes comprising an IrO2/Ti (iridium oxide on titanium mesh) electrode for the oxygen evolution reaction and a Pt/C (carbon-supported platinum) electrode for the oxygen reduction reaction.									29	0	0	0	1	0	29			2380-8195			WOS:000401500200015

Our review focuses on recent work on robust earth-abundant heterogeneous catalysts for the oxygen-evolving reaction (OER). We point out that improvements in the performance of OER catalysts will depend critically on the success of work aimed at understanding reaction barriers based on atomic-level mechanisms. We highlight the challenge of obtaining acid-stable OER catalysts, with proposals for elements that could be employed to reach this goal. We suggest that future advances in solar fuels science will be accelerated by the development of new methods for materials synthesis and characterization, along with in-depth investigations of redox mechanisms at catalytic surfaces.									984	49	0	0	68	2	991			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000388913000014	27797490

However, it is still challenging to modulate the coordination structure of metal atoms with heteroatoms on carbon supports. Herein, an innovative and facile bridging strategy to regulate the coordination structure of cobalt with nitrogen atoms on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets was developed by the interfacial complexation of amino-rich folic acid with cobalt ions on graphene oxide sheets and the subsequent thermal treatment. Typically, the actual coordination interaction between cobalt and nitrogen species was revealed by using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), exhibiting the Co-N-4 coordination structure well-dispersed on reduced graphene oxide. Such unique structure enables the efficient oxygen reduction and evolution reactions via the favorable adsorption and desorption of intermediates. With the enhanced bifunctional electrocatalytic activities, the fabricated Zn-air battery exhibited the excellent performance with large power density of 319.8 mW cm(-2) and good long-term stability (over 300 h). This work establishes the synthesis strategy for bridging metal atom with heteroatom on graphene sheets to enhance the bifunctional electrocatalysis toward Zn-air batteries.

Unfortunately, the bottleneck factors in electrolytes that largely limit the working life and energy efficiency of ZABs have long been relatively neglected. Herein, an alkaline gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is fabricated through multiple crosslinking reactions among poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(acrylic acid), and graphene oxide followed by intense uptake of an alkali and the KI reaction modifier. The prepared GPE exhibits essentially improved properties compared to traditional PVA gel electrolyte in terms of mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and water retention capability. In addition, the introduced reaction modifier I- in the GPE changes the path of the conventional oxygen evolution reaction, leading to a more thermodynamically favorable path. The optimized GPE enables flexible ZABs exhibiting an exceptionally low charge potential of 1.69 V, a long cycling time of 200 h, a high energy efficiency of 73%, and rugged reliability under different extreme working conditions. Moreover, the successful integration of ZABs in a variety of real wearable electronic devices demonstrates their excellent practicability as flexible power sources.									111	3	0	0	7	0	111			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000526173700001	32301217

Usually, metal nanoparticles could form simultaneously during synthesis process, whereas these nanoparticles received very little attention since they were often removed by acid etching. Here, we designed and synthesized an active-N-dominated Co, N co-doped carbon layers supported Co nanoparticles material (denoted as CoNPs@CoNC) by annealing the composites of Co-Phen confined in porous carbon supports together with urea at 900(degrees)C. Compared with the acid etching CoNC catalyst without the surface Co nanoparticles, CoNPs@CoNC catalyst exhibited a higher Co content and slightly positive shifting of the main peak of Co 2p3/2 that is closely associated with the tuned electronic structure. Additionally, the as-prepared CoNPs@CoNC catalyst provided a superior performance (E-j=1/2=0.86V versus RHE, eta(j=10)=0.36V) than that of CoNC catalyst (E-j=1/2=0.81V, eta(j=10)=0.44V), which led to a lower reversible overvoltage of 0.73V for CoNPs@CoNC. Furthermore, the superior performance enabled the CoNPs@CoNC-based Zn-air battery catalyst with a more admirable charge-discharge performance in terms of open-circuit voltage, energy density and power density, unveiling its immense potential in realistic utilization.Boosting bifunctional electrocatalysis with surface/subsurface Co nanoparticles decorated Co, N co-doped defective graphene/carbon-tube hybrid catalysts for rechargeable Zn-air batteries.

The catalyst was precisely tuned using Co metal (M) and suitably integrated with P and S by a simple method of thioureaphosphate-assistance, followed by reductive annealing at 700 degrees C. The possible P-S interactions simultaneously altered the cobalt phosphide crystallinity and improved the defective CPS nanocrystal's interface in the CPS@GN, S,P catalyst. Theoretical investigation demonstrated that doping can induce imbalanced charge distortion on the graphene network and yield thermodynamically-favorable O2 adsorption and dissociation. The nonstoichiometric CPS nanoparticles with M-P-S unit that had been appropriately phase-engineered by controlling the Co3+/Co2+ couple activation with effective electronic structure tuned, could enhance the multiple oxygen-adsorption electroactive sites for catalyzation. Such integrated catalyst can yield an efficiently synergistic ORR with high mass/charge transfer, excellent methanol stability and durability comparable to commercial Pt/C in alkaline medium. CPS@GN,S,P is a promising alternative to Pt as a catalyst for ORR in fuel cells and metal-air batteries.									7	2	0	0	0	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000683031200002

When x increased to 1.0, a well designed integration (SrCoO2.5@Co3O4) was obtained which displayed the optimal OER activity with an overpotential of 330 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 66.7 mV dec(-1) and terrific durability in alkaline media. This excellent performance can be attributed to the auxiliary of the in-situ generated Co3O4 for SrCoO2.5 which modifies the chemical states of Co cations, compensates for the unsatisfactory electrical conductivity of SrCoO2.5 while preserves oxygen vacancies, boosts the content of lattice oxygen and exposes more active sites. This work is expected to provide a new mind to design effective electrocatalysts towards water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Ca2+-binding is associated with a functional water splitting complex of PS II. In the presence of the activator, a low affinity site of Ca2+-binding is converted into a high affinity binding site. Following removal of the extrinsic proteins (17 and 23 kDa), any effect of the activator is no longer observed. Ca2+ channel inhibitors can inhibit the Ca2+-dependent reactivation of oxygen evolution. The activator partially protects against this type of inhibition. It is suggested that the extrinsic proteins form a Ca2+ channel-like structure at the donor side of PS II.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0014-5793			WOS:A1995RG18300016	7796914

Herein, yolk-shell L1(0)-PdFe@C nanoreactors are constructed to enhance the anticorrosive performance and activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Benefited from engineering supports and location of L1(0)-PdFe nanoparticles, the stability toward ORR is significantly improved during accelerated degradation tests (ADT) in both acidic and alkaline mediums, outperforming that of state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts. As evidenced by the structural characterizations, the active Pd sites in porous L1(0)-PdFe@C nanoreactors are well reserved with structure ordered PdFe intermetallics and redeposited Pd nanoparticles, while carbon supported Pd/C and PdFe/C nanoparticles go through severe corrosion and growth after ADT. This work provides a strategy to enhance the durability of catalysts through combining the merits of nanoreactors and ordered intermetallics.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000813882100001

Although much attention has been made to develop efficient catalysts for ORR and OER, it is still highly desired to create new bifunctional catalysts. In this study, Co3O4 hollow polyhedrons are synthesized as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for ORR and OER by simple one-step annealing Co-centered metal-organic frameworks (ZIF-67). Due to the large specific surface areas and high porosity, the as-prepared Co3O4 hollow polyhedrons exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activities for ORR and OER in alkaline media. Co3O4 hollow polyhedrons show higher peak current density (0.61 mA cm(-2)) with four-electron pathway than Co3O4 particles (0.39 mA cm(-2)), better methanol tolerance and superior durability (82.6%) than commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst (58.6%) for ORR after 25 000 s. In addition, Co3O4 hollow polyhedrons also display excellent OER performances with smaller overpotential (536 mV) for 10 mA cm(-2) than Co3O4 particles (593 mV) and superior stability (86.5%) after 25 000 s. This facile one-step strategy based on metal-organic frameworks self-sacrificed templates can be used to develop the promising well-defined porous hollow metal oxides electrode materials for energy conversion and storage technologies.									40	3	0	0	0	0	42			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000390797500004

The effect of the platinum particle size on the electrode performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was studied. The electrocatalytic properties for the ORR, e.g., exchange current density, mass activity and specific activity of a 2% Pt-1% H2WO4-based electrode fabricated from 5% Pt, were found to be several times higher than those of 10% Pt-based electrocatalysts. It was shown that the performance of this electrode is not related to an increase in its electrochemically active surface area, but to its chemical composition. Based on the concept of synergistic process of the ORR on materials we have previously emphasized, it is shown that a 2% Pt-1% H2WO4-based electrocatalyst is a synergistic system due to an increase of the active sites at the electrocatalyst surface.									34	0	0	0	0	0	34			0013-4651			WOS:A1996UQ66200019

Herein, a self-templated strategy is presented for the synthesis of a hydrangea-like superstructure of open carbon cages through morphology-controlled thermal transformation of core@shell metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Direct pyrolysis of core@shell zinc (Zn)@cobalt (Co)-MOFs produces well-defined open-wall nitrogen-doped carbon cages. By introducing guest iron (Fe) ions into the core@shell MOF precursor, the open carbon cages are self-assembled into a hydrangea-like 3D superstructure interconnected by carbon nanotubes, which are grown in situ on the Fe-Co alloy nanoparticles formed during the pyrolysis of Fe-introduced Zn@Co-MOFs. Taking advantage of such hierarchically porous superstructures with excellent accessibility, synergetic effects between the Fe and the Co, and the presence of catalytically active sites of both metal nanoparticles and metal-N-x species, this superstructure of open carbon cages exhibits efficient bifunctional catalysis for both oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction, achieving a great performance in Zn-air batteries.									124	5	0	0	6	0	125			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000486340100001	31517402

The comparison reveals that identical host rock lithologies develop radically different mineralogies within the fault zones, resulting in fundamentally different deformation histories. Oxygen and hydrogen isotope analyses coupled to microstructural characterisation show that infiltration of meteoric water occurred into both fault zones. The smaller Virgin Fault shows evidence of periodic closed system behaviour, which promoted the growth of hydrothermal K-feldspar, whilst the more open system behaviour of the adjacent Ciao Ciao Fault generated a weaker muscovite-rich fault core, which promoted a step change in fault evolution. Effective crustal permeability is a vital control on fault evolution and, coupled to the temperature (i.e. depth) at which key mineral transformations occur, is probably a more significant factor than host rock strength in controlling fault development. The study suggests that whether a fault in granitic basement grows into a large structure may be largely controlled by the initial hydrological properties of the host rocks.

In this study, we successfully developed a novel hybrid coming from thin NiO-NiSe2 nanosheet-based heterostructure shelled high-conductive titanium nitride nanoarrays (TiN@NiO-NiSe2) supported on carbon cloth (CC) via an optimized in-situ synthesis strategy. The hybrid possesses unique physicochemical properties due to the combination of merits from individual components and their synergistic effects, thereby boosting number and type of electroactive sites, reasonably adjusting Gibbs free adsorption energy, and promoting charge/mass transfers. As a potential bifunctional electrocatalyst, the hybrid requires low overpotentials of 115 and 240 mV to reach a current response of 10 mA cm(-2) towards hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Therefore, an electrolyzer of the TiN@NiO-NiSe2 on CC exhibits a low operation voltage of 1.57 V at 10 mA cm(-2) together with a prospective durability, which exceed behaviors of Pt/CHRuO2 as well as recently reported bifunctional electrocatalysts. The results suggest a promising approach for developing cost-effective catalyst towards green hydrogen production via water splitting. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Synthetic lipids with different alkyl chains and spacer lengths bearing functionalized headgroups were specifically designed to bind the Q, site and to anchor this large photosynthetic complex (240 kDa) in order to attempt two-dimensional crystallization. Among the series of different compounds that have been tested, oxygen evolution measurements have shown that dichlorophenyl urea (DCPU) binds very efficiently to the Q, site of PSII CC, and therefore, that moiety has been linked covalently to the headgroup of synthetic lipids. The analysis of the monolayer behavior of these DCPU-lipids has allowed us to select ones bearing long spacers for the anchoring of PSII CC. Oxygen evolution measurements demonstrated that these long-spacer DCPU-lipids specifically bind to PSII CC and inhibit electron transfer. With the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM), it was possible to visualize domains of PSII CC bound to DCPU-lipid monolayers. SNOM imaging has enabled us to confirm that domains observed by AFM were composed of PSII CC. Indeed, the SNOM topography images presented similar domains as those observed by AFM, but in addition, it allowed us to determine that these domains are fluorescent. Electron microscopy of these domains, however, has shown that the bound PSII CC was not crystalline.									9	2	0	0	5	0	11			0006-3495	1542-0086		WOS:000169587400049	11423438

In order to enhance the HER activity, tremendous effort has been made to engineer MoS2 catalysts with either more active sites or higher conductivity. However, at present, synergistically structural and electronic modulations for HER still remain challenging. In this work, we demonstrate the successfully synergistic regulations of both structural and electronic benefits by controllable disorder engineering and simultaneous oxygen incorporation in MoS2 catalysts, leading to the dramatically enhanced HER activity. The disordered structure can offer abundant unsaturated sulfur atoms as active sites for HER, while the oxygen incorporation can effectively regulate the electronic structure and further improve the intrinsic conductivity. By means of controllable disorder engineering and oxygen incorporation, an optimized catalyst with a moderate degree of disorder was developed, exhibiting superior activity for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In general, the optimized catalyst exhibits onset overpotential as low as 120 mV, accompanied by extremely large cathodic current density and excellent stability. This work will pave a new pathway for improving the electrocatalytic activity by synergistically structural and electronic modulations.									1788	115	0	0	121	0	1812			0002-7863			WOS:000328099400039	24191645

Herein, two kinds of cobalt-hybridized Cu3P nanostructure array electrocatalysts (including highly mesoporous 2D nanosheets and sugar gourd-like 1D nanowires) were controllably grown on a nickel foam substrate through a simple hydrothermal method combined with a subsequent phosphating treatment method. An electrocatalytic test indicated that the as-prepared 2D nanosheet array exhibited excellent activity and stability toward hydrogen evolution reaction under alkaline conditions, which offered a low overpotential of 99 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and a small Tafel slope of 70.4 mV/dec, whereas a competitive overpotential of 272 mV was required for oxygen evolution reaction. In addition, the 2D nanosheet array delivered a low cell voltage of 1.66 Vat 10 mA/cm(2) in a symmetric two-electrode system, implying its huge potential in overall water decomposition. The electrocatalytic performance is superior to the as-prepared 1D nanowire array and most of the Cu3P-related electrocatalysts previously reported. Experimental measurements and first-principles calculations show that the excellent performance of the 2D nanosheet array can be attributed to its unique 2D mesoporous structure and hybridization of cobalt, which not only provide a large electrochemically active surface and fast electrocatalytic reaction kinetics but also weaken the binding strength of electrocatalytic reaction intermediates. The present study provides a simple and controllable approach to synthesize Cu3P-based bimetallic phosphide nanostructures, which can be used as boosting Janus electrocatalysts for water decomposition.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000753441100093	34802232

However, to solve severe problems such as cation mixing, oxygen evolution, and transition metal dissolution in LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes, in this study, F-doped LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCMF) was synthesized by solid-state reaction of a NCM and ammonium fluoride, followed by heating process. From X-ray diffraction analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the oxygen in NCM can be replaced by F- ions to produce the F-doped NCM structure. The substitution of oxygen with F- ions may produce relatively strong bonds between the transition metal and F and increase the c lattice parameter of the structure. The NCMF cathode exhibits better electrochemical performance and stability in half- and full-cell tests compared to the NCM cathode.									10	2	0	0	1	0	10				1996-1073		WOS:000581467200001

In this study, cobalt-based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks wrapped by graphene oxide-water (denoted as ZIF-67/GO-W) were successfully prepared by a simple precipitate reaction using water as solvent. Due to the high dispersion of GO in aqueous solution, the synthesis of ZIF-67/GO-W enabled a smaller particle size of ZIF-67 to be attained, also resulted in a more homogeneous distribution between ZIF-67 and GO. Furthermore, a novel hybrid nanostructure comprised of hollow Co3O4-embedded carbon/reduced graphene oxides (Co(3)O(4)eC/rGO-W) is achieved through a facile synthetic route involving the calcination-oxidation of ZIF-67/GO-W. The resulting nanocomposites were found to combine the high conductivity of graphene, the promising catalytic properties of the hollow Co3O4 nanoparticles and a homogeneous distribution of the ZIF-67/GO-W precursor. Enhanced OER activity and improved stability was therefore realized. The hollow Co(3)O(4)eC/rGO-W was found to exhibit a low overpotential (382 mV) and a low tafel slope (62 mV dec(-1)) in 0.1 M KOH, rendering them comparable to the commercial RuO2 catalyst and an improvement to Co3O4 nanoparticles. This work presents an alternative strategy for the development of uniformly distributed ZIF-67/GO-W using water as solvent and suggests hollow Co(3)O(4)eC/rGO-W as potential electrocatalysts for the OER in energy-related applications.

It was shown that their reactions to the MIS 5e and MIS 1 interglacial conditions were fundamentally different, which does not allow us to make direct extrapolations in predicting the reaction of modern fauna to future climate changes. Mountain fauna in MIS 3 and the first half of MIS 2 combined high biological diversity with high resistance. Maintenance of the relative homeostasis of species richness was probably facilitated by the high functional redundancy of the communities, combined with the high ecological diversity of mountain biotopes.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1062-3590	1608-3059		WOS:000525463300006

Thisprocess is generally thought to start by adsorbing and activating one O2through an oxygenvacancy on the TiO2(110) surface, and then an O of O2adsorbed at the vacancy combineswith CO to form CO2. However, it is not a sustainable catalytic process because oxygenvacancies would befilled after the reaction. Here, we reveal a new mechanism, where COphoto-oxidation proceeds on the defect-free TiO2(110) surface in a sustained catalyticcycle, by using density-functional theory calculations with a hybrid functional.Interestingly, wefind that the hole acts as catalysts in this process, which significantlyreduces energy barriers and is not consumed after a reaction cycle. This is significant because it shows that we can use p-type dopingto provide holes. Ourfindings deepen the understanding of CO photo-oxidation and other exothermic photocatalytic reactions andprovide promising strategy to design catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000793809600003

Reduction and oxygen evolution of the bifunctional catalyst. Firstly, the microstructures were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The catalysts were found to have a unique layered mesoporous structure. The formation of spinel tetraoxide with spinel structure in the catalyst was verified by X-ray electron spectrometer (XPS) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that the content of nitrogen-doped graphene and tricobalt tetroxide in the catalyst was 68.43% and 31.57%(w/w), respectively. Electrochemical tests such as rotating disk electrodes showed that the catalyst exhibited superior oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution catalytic properties. In an alkaline environment, the initial potential, half-wave potential, and limiting current density were 1.171 V, 0.718 V, and 4.3 mA.cm(-2), respectively. The Koutecky-Levich equation shows that the catalyst directly reduces oxygen by a four-electron process. In water, the catalytic efficiency was high. The oxygen evolution catalytic performance test showed that the overpotential at the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) was 1.789 V, and the Tafel slope was 134 mV.dec(-1), which had good oxygen evolution kinetics. The difference of overpotential (Delta E) was 1.071 V, which was superior to common dual-function catalysts.									3	3	0	0	0	0	3			1001-4861			WOS:000539209200003

Briefly, an aqueous solution containing Ni2+ and Fe3+ is added dropwise to an aqueous formamide solution at 80 degrees C and pH 10, with the PM-LDH product formed within only 10 min. This fast synthetic strategy introduces an abundance of pores in the monolayer NiFe-LDH nanosheets, resulting in PM-LDH containing high concentration of oxygen and cation vacancies, as is confirmed by extended X-ray absorption fine structure and electron spin resonance measurements. The oxygen and cation vacancies in PM-LDH act synergistically to increase the electropositivity of the LDH nanosheets, while also enhancing H2O adsorption and bonding strength of the OH* intermediate formed during water electrooxidation, endowing PM-LDH with outstanding performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). PM-LDH offers a very low overpotential (230 mV) for OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with a Tafel slope of only 47 mV dec(-1), representing one of the best OER performance yet reported for a NiFe-LDH system. The results encourage the wider utilization of porous monolayer LDH nanosheets in electrocatalysis, catalysis, and solar cells.									122	8	0	0	11	0	122			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000477778000003

The catalysts are irradiated in parallel by visible light from an overhead projector in solutions containing tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)) and persulfate. The array of reaction solutions is held in a 96-well plate, and absorbance readings are taken intermittently using a bioassay plate reader. The absorbance at 430 nm is indicative of the amount of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) remaining in solution. The best catalysts give the most persistent absorbance, because the oxygen evolution reaction is kinetically competitive with decomposition of Ru(bpy)(3)(3+). Reagent concentrations were varied using a factorial design-of-experiment approach in order to optimize reaction conditions for a IrO2.xH(2)O colloidal catalyst. A higher colloid concentration, a lower Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) concentration, and a higher pH buffer doubled the number of turnovers relative to the original conditions. Metal oxide colloids consisting of IrO2.xH(2)O doped with varying amounts of Pt, Ru, and Os were made using a parallel microwave synthesis technique and were tested both by the parallel screening method and by direct measurement of oxygen evolution. The correlation between the two methods was good, with Ir-Pt-Os oxide compositions showing the highest activity. The effect of adding small amounts of Pt and Os to IrO2.xH(2)O appears to be predominantly to reduce the particle size of the colloids.									119	6	0	0	16	1	121			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000178019700045	12224959

In 0.5 M H2SO4 deformation of the metal decreased the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction rate by half compared to the annealed sample. In weakly alkaline borate buffer (pH 9.8) neither the oxygen nor hydrogen peroxide reduction rates were influenced by deformation, while in chloride solutions the effect was similar to that for hydrogen evolution. This indicates that the reduction of both oxygen and peroxide take place at the passive film-solution interface which is not influenced by bulk metal deformations, while for reactions occurring at the metal-solution interface changes of structure, induced by deformation, inhibit the cathodic processes to a small degree.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:A1992HN34100013

The vibrational modes of the detected intermediates were assigned based on DFT calculations of solvated model clusters such as Ge-bound superoxides and peroxides. ATR-IR shows the Ge-bound superoxide with a transition dipole moment oriented at (28 +/- 10)degrees with respect to the surface normal. At slightly negative potentials, the surface-bound peroxide is identified by an OOH bending mode as a further intermediate, oriented at a similar angle. At strongly negative potentials, a surface-bound perchlorate is found. The findings indicate a multistep mechanism of the ORR. The reaction is furthermore coupled with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).									29	3	0	0	1	0	31			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000316803500006	23361398

Cyclic voltammetry and scanning tunneling microscopy are employed to carry out and monitor a "quasi-perfect," two-dimensional growth of up to 35 monolayers of Ag on Au(111) by repetitive galvanic displacement of underpotentially deposited Tl and Pb monolayers. A complementary kinetic study of Pb and Tl UPD layer stability at open-circuit potential identifies the oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction as key oxidative competitors of Ag in the proposed displacement protocol. Analysis of the morphology evolution during the growth of Ag by displacement Pb and Tl UPD layers suggests the one-to-one exchange scenario (Ag-Tl) as more efficient for longer maintenance of a layer-by-layer silver deposition. The excellent quality of layers deposited by monolayer-restricted galvanic displacement is manifested by a steady UPD voltammetry and ascertained by an overall flat and uniform surface morphology maintained during the entire growth process. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis finds no traces of Pb and Tl in the Ag deposit.

However, it still suffers from extremely low ammonia yield for the lack of effective electrocatalysts and shows low Faraday efficiency due to competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we firstly synthesized needle-like K0.33WO3.16 (K-WO3) by molten salt method, then K0.33WO3.16 with surface defect structure (WO3-OV) was successfully obtained through ion-exchange of H+ and dehydration process. An obvious absorption enhancement in the near infrared region exhibited in UV-vis absorption spectra and a significant ESR signal at g=2.003 proves the existence of O vacancies. The abundant oxygen vacancies ensure that Faraday efficiency of WO3-OV gets improved to 25.45 % at -0.3 V (vs RHE), much superior to K-WO3 (FE: 9.33 %). It is worth noting that defect-rich WO3-OV also shows high electrochemical stability.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000600776600001

Recently, the preparation of oxide-matrix composites in which both the matrix and the dispersed phase are metal oxides has been also investigated and produced active electrocatalytic materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).The structure of some composites with PbO2 as the matrix and in which the dispersed phase is an oxide (Fe2O3, Bi2O3, SnO2) have been prepared and characterised by SEM pictures, EDX and atomic absorption measurements. The reactivity of the PbO2/Fe2O3 electrode for the OER has been pointed out with overvoltage measurements and Tafel plots in a solution of Na2SO4 0.5M pH=7. The pure PbO2 electrode has been compared with the PbO2/Fe2O3 Ones when the volume fraction of the dispersed phase Fe2O3 (alpha) increases. Our results have shown that PbO2/Fe2O3 composites are more active electrode materials for the OER then PbO2, the oxygen evolution overvoltage (etaO(2)) is proportionally reduced by increasing the amount of the incorporated Fe2O3.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			0252-9289			WOS:000166370700003

In addition to the chemistry related to the zinc electrode, efficient and stable bifunctional catalysts are required for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, for discharging) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER, for charging) on the air-electrode side. Herein, a family of non-precious metal catalysts is investigated as possible bifunctional composite: metal-nitrogen-carbon (MNC) catalysts for ORR, and metal oxyhydroxides as OER catalysts (Ox). The effect of transition metal and metal loading in these composite MNC + Ox catalysts on ORR and OER activities in half-cell measurements is discussed. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy to identify their phase composition. For the most active material, a potential gap of 0.79 V between OER and ORR was obtained, respectively. In a zinc-air cell, this catalyst moreover showed a peak power density of 62 mW cm(-2) and a charge-discharge gap of 0.94 V after 26 h of charge-discharge cycling.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000656192400001

This experimental blueprint is mimicked in renewable energy technology, such as fuel cell. However, the harsh chemical conditions encountered in fuel cells have restricted the direct use of fragile biological ORR catalysts: the copper-based oxidase enzymes. Thus, a number of homogeneous synthetic ORR catalysts were developed in the past few years that can be used directly as an alternative cathodic substance in fuel cell. In this review, we have depicted the rationale behind the evolution of various ORR catalysts along with their developmental history.					Advances in Spectroscopy: Molecules to Materials.

The preparation of such catalysts, however, is often complicated and in low yield. Herein we report a robust approach for easy synthesis of M/N-C hybrids in high yield, which includes a mussel-inspired polymerization reaction at room temperature and a subsequent carbonization process. With the introduction of selected transition metal salts into an aqueous solution of dopamine (DA), the obtained mixture self-polymerizes to form metal-containing polydopamine (M-PDA) composites, e.g. Co-PDA, Ni-PDA and Fe-PDA. Upon carbonization at elevated temperatures, these metal-containing composites were converted into M/N-C, i.e. Co-PDA-C, Ni-PDA-C and Fe-PDA-C, respectively, whose morphologies, chemical compositions, and electrochemical performances were fully studied. Enhanced ORR activities were found in all the obtained hybrids, with Co-PDA-C standing out as the most promising catalyst with excellent stability and catalytic activities towards both ORR and OER. This was further proven in Zn-air batteries (ZnABs) in terms of discharge voltage stability and cycling performance. At a discharge-charge current density of 2 mA cm(-2) and 1 h per cycle, the Co-PDA-C based ZnABs were able to steadily cycle up to 500 cycles with only a small increase in the discharge-charge voltage gap which notably outperformed Pt/C; at a discharge current density of 5 mA cm(-2), the battery continuously discharged for more than 540 h with the discharge voltage above 1 V and a voltage drop rate of merely 0.37 mV h(-1). With the simplicity and scalability of the synthetic approach and remarkable battery performances, the Co-PDA-C hybrid catalyst is anticipated to play an important role in practical ZnABs.									91	2	0	0	7	0	91			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000371479000031	26864616

Herein, a convenient and general strategy is presented for preparation of highyield FeCo-nitrogen-carbon nanotubes with porous and hollow structure (FeCo-NCNTs), in which the chlorinated metals were initially chelated with 2,4,6-tris(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine (TPTZ), followed by ultimate pyrolysis and acid treatment. The resulting FeCo-NCNTs exhibited outstanding catalytic property for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, E-1/2 = 0.90 V) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 320 mV of overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline surroundings. Besides, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the porous structure created abundant active sites and active Fe-centered FeCo sites greatly reduced the OOH* energy barrier to promote the ORR. Moreover, the FeCo-NCNTs based rechargeable Zn-air battery exhibited high open circuit voltage (1.55 V), large output power density (148 mW cm(-2)), and robust stability (115 h, 345 cycles), surpassing the mixed Pt/C + RuO2 derived battery. Furthermore, the alternative FeNi-NCNTs and FeMn-NCNFs systems also displayed superior performances in the same environment. This strategy offers a new avenue for rational design of advanced metal-nitrogen-carbon materials with high electrocatalytic performances.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707037200115

Herein, a uniform distribution of NiCo alloy nanoparticles wrapped by B,N-codoped carbon nanosheet networks (core-shell structure) through a novel self-template strategy is developed (designated as NiCo@BNC). The optimal NiCo@BNC prepared at 800 degrees C (NiCo@BNC-800) shows an outstanding bifunctional ORR/OER activity with an extremely small potential difference of 0.61 V between E-ORR1/2 and E-OER10, which is the best record so far. Theoretical calculation reveals reaction intermediates were liable to absorbed to B sites, and Gibbs free energetics (Delta G) of NiCo@BNC-800 are more close to the ideal pathway. This facile and general strategy provides a promising avenue for rational design of transition-metal compounds for oxygen-involving reactions.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2168-0485			WOS:000484071600011

Herein, a novel electrocatalyst composed of amorphous Ni (OH)S nanosheets was prepared by hydrolysis of NiCl2(CH3CSNH2)4 at room temperature. From spectroscopic characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the Ni(OH)S catalyst contains a Ni3+-rich phase, which can significantly accelerate the reaction kinetics. The anode electrocatalyst shows excellent OER activity, generating 10 mA cm-2 with only 250 mV overpotentials. When employed as a UOR anode, it could reach 10 mA cm-2 at 1.34 V, 140 mV lower than OER. Notably, the Ni(OH)S/NF anode exhibits decent bifunctional UOR and OER activities and presents the lowest overpotentials compared to a NiFe-PBA/NF UOR catalyst and a typical RuO2/NF OER catalyst. This work provides a novel strategy for synthesizing amorphous Ni (III)-based sulfides nanosheets for bifunctional OER/UOR electrocatalysts, which is significant for efficient and stable hydrogen production by using urea-containing wastewater.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000798989400005

We demonstrate that Pt nanoclusters (NCs) anchored on porous TiO2 nanosheets with rich oxygen vacancies (V-O-rich Pt/TiO2) and deficient oxygen vacancies (V-O-deficient Pt/TiO2), display significantly different catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which V-O-rich Pt/TiO2 shows a mass activity of 45.28 A mg(Pt)(-1) at -0.1 V vs. RHE, which is 16.7 and 58.8 times higher than those of V-O-deficient Pt/TiO2 and commercial Pt/C, respectively. DFT calculations and in situ Raman spectra suggest that porous TiO2 with rich oxygen vacancies can simultaneously achieve reversed charge transfer (electrons transfer from TiO2 to Pt NCs) and enhanced hydrogen spillover from Pt NCs to the TiO2 support, which leads to electron-rich Pt NCs being amenable to proton reduction of absorbed H*, as well as the acceleration of hydrogen desorption at Pt catalytic sites-both promoting the HER. Our work provides a new strategy for rational design of highly efficient HER catalysts.									49	2	0	0	3	0	48			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000663855100001	34002464

Herein, we report the in-situ generation of electrodeposited black phosphorous (BP) based nanocomposites at the liquid/liquid interface for the first time and their catalysis in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The catalytic HER activities of these catalysts have been investigated electrochemically and also chemically by two-phase reactions. The BP/MoSx, BP/Cu, and BP/Pt nanocomposites were formed by reducing the catalyst precursors such as (NH4)(2)MoS4, (NH4)(2)PtCl4, and CuCl2 salts, respectively on the BP nanosheets by decamethylferrocene (DMFc) electron donor during the catalytic HER. The electrodeposited nanocomposites were collected from the interface and characterized by using advanced analytical techniques. Among them, the BP/MoSx nanocomposites showed the highest HER activity with a reaction rate constant of 0.202 min(-1) was about 230- and 7-times greater than the ones obtained by non-catalytic reaction and the free-MoSx catalyst. Moreover, the nucleation of the catalysts and the HER mechanisms were also explained in detail. The BP/MoSx also showed higher HER activity compared to that of carbon nanotubes CNTMoSx and reduced graphene oxide rGOMoS(x) nanocomposites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000848138200003

Transitional metal sulfides and N-doped carbon materials are widely reported as effective electrocatalysts of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), respectively. Herein, an 3D-array-structured catalyst composed of Co1-xS nanoneedles enwrapped by nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) is in-situ grown on carbon fibre paper substrate. It is revealed that the meta-stable hexagonal Co1-xS itself possesses attractive electrocatalytic activities toward both OER and ORR. Additionally, owing to the wrapping-protection effect of polydopamine-derived NC on Co1-xS, the strong electron coupling between Co1-xS and NC, and the 3D array structure, Co1-xS@NC presents excellent OER/ORR catalytic activities and long-term stabilities, superior to Co@NC, Co1-xS, and NC, and comparable to noble metals and other reported state-of-the-art bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. A small energy gap (Delta E) of 0.66 V between the ORR half-wave potential (0.86 V vs RHE) and OER potential (1.52 V vs RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a diffusion-limit ORR current density of 11.37 mA cm(-2) are achieved. Notably, the flexible ZAB using the catalyst exhibits a markedly higher peak power density of 242 mW cm(2), and a small charge/ discharge voltage gap of similar to 0.68 V with a high round-trip efficiency of similar to 64% when cycling at 5 mA/cm(2).									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000702829200005

Although bimetallic phosphides show great potential in electrocatalytic water splitting, the synergistic effect between different active sites has not been investigated to date in detail, which implies lack of an effective strategy to optimize the water splitting performance in a reasonable way. Here werealize robust oxygen evolution (OER) performance with an extremely low overpotential (500 mA cm(-2)@255 mV), low Tafel slope (29.1 mV dec(-1)), and superior stability by controlling the Fe sites on the Ni-Fe-P surface. The prepared OER electrode employs non-noble metal catalysts for superior oxygen evolution performance and meets the requirements of commercial water electrolyzers. In addition, remarkable hydrogen evolution (HER) performance with prominent stability is also achieved by reducing the content of Fe dopant. Our theoretical calculations reveal that improved chemisorption of O-containing intermediates induced by Fe doping contributes to the enhanced OER performance and water molecule chemisorption, which is sensitive to the Fe content, is the primary cause affecting alkaline HER performance. This work highlights controllable water splitting performance on the Ni-Fe-P surface by precisely manipulating the surface active Fe-sites.									52	0	0	0	2	0	52			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000449701900022

The particles have been characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX). Gelatin plays an important role in the formation of the nano-NiO. TEM image shows the formation of nano-NiO with average particle size 16 nm, which agrees well with the XRD data. Moreover, efficient and stable nano-NiO-based anodes were fabricated by casting of the nano-NiO and multi-walled carbon nanotube solution (NiO-MWNT) on glassy carbon (NiO-MWNT/GC), platine (NiO-MWNT/Pt), and carbon paste (NiO-MWNT/CP) electrodes. The electrocatalysis of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at modified electrodes has been examined using linear scanning voltammetry (LSV). The OER is significantly enhanced upon modification of the electrodes with NiO-MWNT, as demonstrated by a negative shift in the LSV curves at the NiO-MWNT-modified electrodes compared to that obtained at the unmodified ones. The maximum electrocatalytic activity toward the OER was obtained in alkaline media. The values of energy saving of oxygen gas at a current density of 5 mA cm(-2) Pt, CP, and GC electrodes are 14.1, 16.0, and 21.6 kW h kg(-1), respectively. The low cost as well as the marked stability of the modified electrodes makes them promising candidates in industrial water electrolysis process.									33	0	0	0	1	0	33			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000332487200017

Generally, the lack of active and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits the practicability of water splitting as a renewable source of energy. In this work, interconnected 3D structure of cobalt oxides nanoparticles (Co3O4 NPs) derived from ZIP-67 with nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) of polypyrmle (PPy) origin is successfully synthesized as OER electrocatalysts. Impressively, the highly conductive N-CNTs that run through the Co3O4 NPs not only endow the resulting product Co3O4/N-CNTs with large active surface area and enhanced charge transfer between Co3O4 NPs, but also prevent Co3O4 NPs from aggregation. As a result, the as-synthesized Co3O4/N-CNTs electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding OER activity with a low onset potential of similar to 1.37 V (vs RHE), overpotential of only 200 mV to attain a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in basic media and very small Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the enhanced nitrogen-content also improves the OER kinetics by proficient charge transfer. The superb electrocatalytic performance and higher stability make the Co3O4/N-CNTs a proficient non-precious electrocatalyst for the OER. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The excellent electrocatalytic activity of ZIF67@MoO3 NSs@NF are demonstrated. It can use the overpotential (n) of 178 mV and 386 mV respectively to drive 10 mA cm(-2) and 50 mA cm(-2). It is also observed that the ZIF67@MoO3 NSs@NF electrode has the highest initial current density (45.7 mA cm(-2)) at 1.618 V and can maintain more than 90% of the initial current density after 20,000 s. The ZIF67@MoO3 NSs@NF electrode also shows the small HER overpotential of 135 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the voltage of ZIF67@MoO3 NSs@NF as a bifunctional overall water splitting catalysts is 1.58 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to another noble metal electric catalyst combination RuO2/ NF(+)//Pt-C/NF(-). And the ZIF67@MoO3 NSs@NF(+)//ZIF67@MoO3 NSs@NF(-) combination can maintain more than 90% of the initial current density after 65,000 s at 1.58 V. The main reason is the composite interface of MoO3 NSs and ZIF67 phases with Co-O bonds, C-O-Mo bonds and oxygen vacancies defects facilitates the increase of the active sites and efficient electron transfer rate.

Here, we aim toward single-atom Au supported on NiFe LDH (Au-s/NiFe LDH) to clarify the activity origin of LDHs system and a 6-fold OER activity enhancement by 0.4 wt % Au-s decoration. Combining with theoretical calculations, the active behavior of NiFe LDH results from the in situ generated NiFe oxyhydroxide from LDH during the OER process. With the presence of Au-s, Au-s/NiFe LDH possesses an overpotential of 0.21 V in contrast to the calculated result (0.18 V). We ascribe the excellent OER activity of sAu/NiFe LDH to the charge redistribution of active Fe as well as its surrounding atoms causing by the neighboring Au-s on NiFe oxyhydroxide stabilized by interfacial CO32- and H2O interfacing with LDH.									578	53	0	0	31	0	583			0002-7863			WOS:000428356000015	29518310

The specimens were as-received or preoxidized in water vapor (425 degrees C/10,7 MPa) to simulate the reactor conditions. Then the specimens were exposed to hot water vapor (0,1 MPa) and high temperatures (950-1200 degrees C) for variable time intervals, which simulated the Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA). The specimens were quenched in water with ice. Both SIMS and TEA quantitative results were in good agreement and were correlated with the mechanical properties (microhardness, residual ductility), which depend on the oxygen concentration and are important for the safety analyses assessment. The ceiling concentration of oxygen in the beta-phase was established based on the experimental results of SIMS and TEA. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The metal substrate for NiFeOx(OH)(y) catalyst does not merely perform the physical role of loading the catalyst, but actively participates in the activation process of the catalyst phase by controlling the charge transfer during the OER. The Ni foam substrate is found to be the best to make NiFeOx(OH)(y)/Ni foam the most active and the most stable electrode for OER in an alkaline medium due to its multiple functions. The nickel substrate forms the thinnest oxide layer on its surface to allow facile charge transfer, and stabilizes the M-O-x(OH)(y) structure of high oxidation degree of metals and balanced O-x/(OH)(y) responsible for excellent OER performance. The high intrinsic corrosion resistance of Ni and its ability to stabilize a thick layer of M-O-x(OH)(y) structure can also minimize the metal dissolution during the OER and provide superior long-term stability. Finally, oxidation of the Ni substrate itself results in more NiOOH phase formation to achieve an optimum NiFe composition. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, proliferating and undifferentiated cells from different plant tissues were found to reside in endogenously generated hypoxic niches. Thus, stress-associated acute hypoxia may be distinguished from constitutively generated chronic hypoxia. The Cys/Arg branch of the N-degron pathway assumes a central role in integrating oxygen levels resulting in proteolysis of transcriptional regulators that control different aspects of plant growth and development. As a target of this pathway, group VII of the Ethylene Response Factor (ERF-VII) family has emerged as a hub for the integration of oxygen dynamics in root development and during seedling establishment. Additionally, vegetative shoot meristem activity and reproductive transition were recently associated with oxygen availability via two novel substrates of the N-degron pathways: VERNALISATION 2 (VRN2) and LITTLE ZIPPER 2 (ZPR2). Together, these observations support roles for molecular oxygen as a signalling molecule in plant development, as well as in essential metabolic reactions. Here, we review recent findings regarding oxygen-regulated development, and discuss outstanding questions that spring from these discoveries.									35	0	0	0	25	0	35			0028-646X	1469-8137		WOS:000596072400006	31943217

As-prepared porous Ni-based foams were characterized by various electrochemical measurements, namely, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The prepared Ni foam has a cauliflower morphology, whereas the Ni/Cu foam obtained upon doping with Cu has a dendritic morphology. The latter foam layer possesses a higher exposed electroactive surface area and electrocatalytic performance than the undoped Ni foam, which depends on the percentage of Cu content. Additionally, the porous Ni/Cu foam shows marked performance as a dual catalyst towards cathodic and anodic reactions, i.e., hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs), oxygen evolution reactions (OERs), urea oxidation reactions (UORs), and glycerol oxidation reactions (GORs) in an alkaline medium. The co-deposition of Cu within the matrix of the Ni foam increases its intrinsic catalytic activity as evidenced by the enrichment of the Ni surface by electro-active species (catalytic mediators) as well as increasing the dispersion (and thus active surface area) of Ni within the porous foam layer. This Ni/Cu foam catalyst layer requires reduced overall energies of 1.71, 1.46, and 1.44 V to support 10 mA cm(-2) during overall water splitting, urea electrolysis, and glycerol electrolysis, respectively. Oxalate is the main byproduct resulting from glycerol electrolysis as revealed by the FTIR analysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000620730300007

It has been found that the methanol thermal evolution is initiated by a breaking of the O-H bond, fort-ning an upright (C-3 nu symmetry) methoxy species (CH3O). This reaction requires annealing to about 180 K and, for dense layers, proceeds in parallel to molecular desorption. At 220 K, methoxy is found to be the dominant surface species. However, its decomposition into CO + 3H already starts at this temperature, as deduced from the appearance of the nu(CO) mode of CO; that is, methoxy is stable in a narrow temperature range only. Yet, CH3O formed at 220 K can be stabilized up to 320-340 K by means of surface site blocking through CO coadsorption. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide, the resulting reaction products from methoxy decomposition, desorb at 330-350 and 470 K, respectively. No other reaction intermediates have been identified. An entirely new interpretation is presented regarding the production of water detected in thermal desorption at about 190 K. On the basis of experiments with different methanol and oxygen isotopes, we demonstrate that it is the hydrogen of the hydroxyl group of methanol and residual surface oxygen (most likely at steps and a relict of the surface cleaning procedure with oxygen) which contributes to the formation of water. As intermixing of abstracted hydrogen with coadsorbed deuterium is found to be negligible, the hydrogen abstracted from methanol is suggested to react directly with surface oxygen, that is, without adsorbing on the surface in between. C-O bond breaking, long believed to act as the primary reaction step toward water formation, can definitely be ruled out.									25	3	0	0	1	0	25			1932-7447			WOS:000274354800039

Measurements and kinetic analyses of laser flash induced 820 nm absorption changes (reflecting the turnover of P680) led to the following results: (a) the pattern of multiphasic P680(+.) reduction is basically the same in both species, (b) the activation energy of the "fast" nanosecond kinetics is 20 +/- 5 kJ mol(-1) and 14 +/- 5 kJ mol(-1) for the samples from T. elongatus and S. oleracea, respectively, (c) the activation energies of this reaction are nearly the same in complexes with water oxidizing complex (WOC) in redox states S-1 and S-2, (d) the activation energy of the "slow" nanosecond kinetics ascribed to "local" relaxation processes is larger by almost a factor of two compared to that of the "fast" nanosecond kinetics, and (e) the normalized amplitudes of the "fast" and "slow" nanosecond kinetics are virtually independent of temperature in the physiological range for PS II core complexes from both organisms. Based on these findings the energetics and kinetics of P680(+.) reduction in fully competent PS II is briefly discussed within the framework of a dynamic model of sequential relaxation processes. The protein dynamics are inferred to provide the major contribution to the driving force of the redox reaction.									29	0	0	0	23	0	29			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000224755500015

A Ru-V = O 7-coordinate intermediate is implicated in the reactivity of the fastest water oxidation catalysts. Previously we reported in situ characterization of the 7-coordinate [Ru-V = O (L)(2) (bda)](+) stabilized on the electrode. Here we use ligand protection to stabilize [Ru-V = 0(pic) 2 (dpp)](3+). We report the transformation of [Ru-II (pic)(2)(dpp)](2+) (dpp = 2,9-di-(pyrid-2'-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline, pic = 4-picoline) water oxidation catalyst using a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray diffraction, resonance Raman (RR) and density functional theory (DFT). We observe the generation of [Ru-V = O(pic)(2)(dPP)](3+) and its chemical reactivity in solution. Lag phase in the oxygen evolution by [Ru-II(pic)(2) (dpp)] (2+) is due to catalyst activation via an oxygen atom transfer from [Ru-V = O (Pic)(2)(dPP)](3+) to the polypyridine dpp ligand and formation of [Ru-III (pic)(2)(dpp-NO,NO)](3+). Detailed information regarding catalyst activation during the reaction will enable the design of more active and stable catalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, several key issues such as high cost, poor stability, and detrimental environmental effects limit the catalytic activity of these noble metal- and metal oxide-based catalysts. Herein, we have designed and synthesized macroporous carbon nanofiber arrays by using a natural crab shell template. Subsequently, spinel MnCo2O4 nanoparticles were embedded into the nitrogen-doped macroporous carbon nanofiber arrays (NMCNAs) by a hydrothermal method. Accompanied by the good conductivity, large surface area and doping of nitrogen, the as-prepared MnCo2O4/NMCNA exhibited remarkable catalytic performance and outstanding stability for both ORR and OER in alkaline media. The macroporous superstructures play vital role in reducing the ion transport resistance and facilitating the diffusion of gaseous products (O-2). Finally, rechargeable Zn-air batteries using the MnCo2O4/NMCNA catalyst displayed appreciably lower overpotentials, higher power density and better stability than commercial Pt/C, thus raising the prospect of functional low-cost, non-precious-metal bifunctional catalysts in metal- air batteries.									35	2	0	0	1	0	37			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000407336600020	28749503

Acetylene and oxygen gases under varying conditions of initial concentrations are injected into an inductively coupled argon plasma where complete molecular dissociation occurs. The evolution of chemical species is investigated along the plasma flow reactor as a function of temperature and residence time. Atomized species of C, H, and O cool from 5000 to 1000 K within 30 ms at atmospheric pressures. We employed optical emission and infrared absorption spectroscopy to measure the reaction intermediates (e.g. C-2) and products (e.g. C2H2). Chemical equilibrium models are inadequate to describe the evolution of carbon molecular products, and thus a chemical kinetics model is developed. In both experiments and kinetic modeling, we find that the addition of oxygen in 1:1 proportion to carbon strongly favors the formation of CO, preventing the formation of acetylene (an important soot precursor) in less than 10 milliseconds. The kinetics model is also used to perform reaction sensitivity and a rate of production analyzes to identify the rate determining steps and the major chemical pathways that control the acetylene production/consumption. The results demonstrate the feasibility of chemical-based strategies for eliminating the formation of carbonaceous particles in fusion energy reactors.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0741-3335	1361-6587		WOS:000460527900003

In the present study, alpha-Bi2O3 and tantalum powders were used as the starting powders for the formation of high-temperature bismuth oxide phase via mechanochemical synthesis by high energy ball milling. (Bi2O3)(80)(Ta)(20) and (Bi2O3)(95)(Ta)(5) in weight concentrations were milled in either an oxygen-free argon-filled glove box environment or an ambient atmosphere to investigate the effects of oxygen concentration and tantalum addition. The as-milled powders were examined using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry to reveal the structural evolution. The experimental results showed that for (Bi2O3)(95)(Ta)(5) powder mixtures milled within the glove box, tantalum gradually reacted with the alpha-Bi2O3 phase and formed a beta-Bi7.8Ta0.2O12.2 phase. For (Bi2O3)(80)(Ta)(20) milled under the same conditions, Ta and alpha-Bi2O3 mechanochemically reacted to form delta-Bi3TaO7 and bismuth after 10 min of high energy ball milling, whereas milling (Bi2O3)(80)(Ta)(20) under the ambient atmosphere with a much higher oxygen concentration accelerated the mechanochemical reaction to less than five minutes of milling and resulted in the formation of high-temperature delta-Bi3TaO7 phase.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1996-1944			WOS:000473759400066	31212915

For metallic Sn films, the stresses and stability of the films are controlled by Li alloying reactions. Small, non-contacting separated Sn particles exhibit higher electrochemical stability relative to more continuous polycrystalline films with larger particles. Metallic Sn particles develop tensile stress during LiySn de-alloying as porous structures are formed. The amount of stress associated with lithiation and delithiation of well-separated metallic particles decreases as a porous, easy to lithiate, material forms with cycling. During the lithiation of oxides, conversion reactions (SnOx [RIGHTWARDS ARROW] Sn) and the lithiation of the metallic Sn control the stress responses of the films, leading to highly potential-dependent stress development. In particular, evidence for a multistep electrochemical mechanism, in which partially reversible lithiation of the oxygen-containing phases is conjoined with a fully reversible lithiation of the metallic phases of the Sn, is found. The electrochemical stress analysis provides new insight into these mechanisms and delineates the extent of the reversibility of lithiation and conversion reactions of oxides.									24	2	0	0	2	0	26			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000347534800001

Herein, a facile one-step reduction method is proposed to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) amorphous NiCoFe catalysts with nanowires@nanosheets (NiCoFe NW @NSs) core-shell nanostructures. The unique 3D and amorphous features can accelerate the transfer process of relevant active species and provide more accessible active sites. Coupled with synergistic effects resulting from the ternary metals and core-shell nanostructures, the as-prepared Ni1Co1Fe1NW@NSs exhibits the ultralow overpotential of 220 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 36.42 mV dec(-1), which is superior to the benchmark RuO2 catalyst (290 mV and 127.93 mV dec(-1)). Furthermore, the catalyst displays remarkable long-term stability with negligible degeneration of only 9 mV after 24 h chronopotentiometry test. This work provides insight into the rational design of catalysts to achieve intrinsically high activity and stability in the alkaline electrolyte for water-splitting devices.

Carbonaceous fuels, being front-line suppliers of energy, adversely affect the environment with greenhouse gas emission. Considering the electrocatalytic way of splitting water, it is one of the finest ways for producing pure hydrogen with a fast rate with no other undesired by-products; hence, researchers across the world have focused maximum attention to make them commercially applicable. To replace the noble metals, transition metal-based catalysts are promising. In this review, we have chosen to highlight solely the importance of Cu-based nanostructures as effective electrocatalysts for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Moreover, various synthetic approaches with Cu nanostructures such as mono-, bi-, and tri-metallic catalysts as oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, selenides, tellurides, and phosphides were studied for OER and HER in different pH conditions. Hence, this review gives a brief understanding of Cu-based nanostructures in electrocatalytic water splitting and based on this, it can be applied with other advancements in catalysts development for viable hydrogen generation with electrocatalytic water splitting.									50	0	0	0	2	0	50			2052-1553			WOS:000605454900021

It is critical to search for high performance of OER catalysts with different chemical compositions and structures. Herein, we report a new CoFe selenite with NH4+ cation, further, an amorphous N-doped CoFe selenite can be obtained by an environmentally friendly in situ-method, further, by adjusting the ratio of Co and Fe and calcination temperature, the optimal electrocatalyst shows the lowest overpotential of 242 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) on glassy carbon and a small Tafel slope of 59.1 mV dec(-1), respectively, besides, this catalyst maintains the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for at least 24 h when applying overpotential of 242 mV. N-doping into this CoFe selenites can tailor its electronic structure, moreover, its mesoporous structure favors the mass transfer, electrolyte diffusion and O-2 release, in addition, the electrochemical oxidation processes can provide more active sites due to the surface modification of this CoFe selenites, consequently, exhibiting superior OER performance. This study provides an effective strategy to explore highly active and durable electrocatalysts for water splitting.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000620252400006

Photocatalytic testing for water oxidation revealed extremely high activity for PEC water splitting and photocatalytic water oxidation under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm) with a benchmark IPCE for BiFeO3 of 23% at 400 nm. The high activity is ascribed to the ultrafine morphology achieved via the LPCVD process. The performance was enhanced by over four times when the BiFeO3 photoanode is coupled to a Ni-B surface OEC.									47	3	0	0	3	0	48			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000362350700026	26383028

Oxygen uptake rate has been measured by applying a modified dynamic method and a kinetic model is proposed, obtaining the kinetic parameter values: specific maintenance and yield coefficients. The volumetric mass transfer coefficients under inert conditions, k(L)a, and during the bioprocess, K(L)a, have been determined. The values obtained are different and a biological enhancement factor E, has been considered. These parameters have been predicted by the theoretical model and good agreement with experimental data under the conditions studied has been found. The oxygen limitation has been expressed by a modified dimensionless Damkohler number, Da, the relationship between transport and biological reaction rates. This number decreases with increasing stirrer speed; that is, when mass transport resistance decreases. The efficiency of oxygen utilization can be determined by a film effectiveness factor, eta. The effectiveness factor was found to be a strong function of Damkohler number and decrease with increasing Da. Furthermore, oxygen concentration into culture depends on the mass transfer and consumption rates. The theoretical model proposed is able to reasonably predict the evolution of dissolved oxygen concentration with time of cultivation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report the design of two-dimension on two-dimension growth of hierarchical Ni0.2Mo0.8N nanosheets on Fe-doped Ni3N nanosheets supported on Ni foam (Ni0.2Mo0.8N/Fe-Ni3N/NF) via hydrothermal reaction and nitridation treatment. In the hierarchical structures, small Ni0.2Mo0.8N nanosheets were uniformly anchored on Fe-Ni3N nanosheets. Due to enhanced electron transfer between Ni0.2Mo0.8N and Fe-Ni3N, Ni0.2Mo0.8N/Fe-Ni3N/NF exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). After stability tests for 50 h, Ni0.2Mo0.8N/Fe-Ni3N/NF exhibits negligible degradation of the current density for the OER (91% remain) and HER (95% remain), suggesting excellent stability.

In order to increase the electro-capacitive properties and reduce the intrinsic impedance of the metal oxides, the samples were consecutively modified by reduction in hydrogen to obtain highly dispersed Ni-Fe alloys into ceria matrix. By exploiting the high permeability of carbon inside ferrous alloys, the metal phase has been further modified into ferrous carbides and metal alloys encapsulated within carbon nanofibers. For this purpose, a reaction, already widely studied for the production of hydrogen, was used, that is the decomposition of methanol vapors. In fact, this decomposition, in addition to producing syn-gas and methane, changes the catalysts in use through a chemical vapor deposition-carbon coating process. This fact, has been used by us to demonstrate how the newly obtained metal-carbon nanocomposites can be used for electrocatalytic purposes. The modified phases of the two molar ratios of the Fe-Ni-Ce catalysts were tested in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) in an alkaline environment (1 M KOH), showing a satisfactory and progressive increase in activity and a surprising decrease in the overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 of current density. The morphological, textural and physicochemical properties of the samples were characterized in details by XRD, N2- physisorption, TG-TPO, TEM, EDX, FTIR, XPS, Raman and Moessbauer spectroscopies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0008-6223	1873-3891		WOS:000799144800005

Such electrocatalyst with a Pt loading of 14.7 wt.% displays remarkable performance with low overpotentials of approximately -25 and -44 mV at the current density of -10 and -100 mA cm(-2) as well as excellent cycling stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

Their activities can be further tuned by delamination into single-layer oxide sheets or by means of doping. The active site for the reaction and how doping and delamination promote the intrinsic activity, however, remain elusive. To shed light on these open questions, we have undertaken a systematic analysis of the stability, catalytic activity, and electronic conductivity of Ni and Co ox-hys ranging from bulk (3D) to single-layer (2D) catalysts. In both cases, we investigate the role of terrace and edge sites and use stability, catalytic activity, and electronic conductivity as evaluation criteria to pinpoint the best catalysts. We arrive at several important conclusions: the ox-by surface is fully oxidized under oxygen evolution conditions, bulk terraces are ostensibly the most active sites, and Ni ox-hy sheets are more electronically conductive in comparison to their Co equivalents. Furthermore, we examine 25 different doped Co and Ni ox-hy nanosheets (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co/Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, Pt, Ag, Al, Ga, In, Sn, Pb, Bi, Mg, Sc, Y, Ti, Nb, Zn, and Cd) to further tailor the catalytic performance. We establish the dependence of the electronic conductivity and activity on potential and find that it is more energetically favorable to dope Ni in comparison to Co ox-hys, with first-row transition and noble metals being the most stable dopants. Finally, we extend the analysis to include bulk terminations and reveal that most dopants, which are stable in the nanosheets, have a large propensity to segregate to the surface of bulk materials, and those that are less prone to segregation (Fe or Cr) are not electronically conductive in the bulk. Overall, we identify Rh-doped Ni ox-by to be the best catalyst material.									41	1	0	0	3	0	41			2155-5435			WOS:000417230500064

Herein, a bicontinuous nanoporous FeCoNiMg alloy is prepared by high heat sintering method based on the nanoscale Kirkendall effect and the surface is codoped with nitrogen and carbon elements by the nitrocarburizing method (denoted NC-FeCoNiMg). The three-dimensional (3D) nanoporous NC-FeCoNiMg alloy electrode achieves superior electrocatalytic performance for the OER in alkaline media, delivering a low Tafel slope (34.6 mV dec(-1)) and small overpotentials (235 and 290 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively). Under consecutive high current densities, the NC-FeCoNiMg electrode still exhibits excellent long-term stability, and the OER activity even increases after testing for 100 h at a high current density of 1000 mA cm(-2). Comprehensive studies reveal that the N/C codoping of the inner and outer surfaces dramatically improves the electrocatalytic activity of the NC-FeCoNiMg electrode. This work demonstrates an efficient nanoarchitectural construction and a surface modulation strategy to increase the electrocatalytic activity and stability of transition-metal-based electrodes for the OER, holding great promise for fulfilling the requirements for the large scale production of clean hydrogen energy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000741098900001	35021578

Herein, we report a powerful puffing method to fabricate hierarchical porous N-doped carbon with numerous embedded Ni nanoparticles. Interestingly, during the puffing and annealing process, rice precursor with N and Ni sources can be in situ converted into Niembedded N-doped porous carbon (N-PC/Ni) composite. The obtained N-PC/Ni composite possesses a cross-linked porous architecture containing conductive carbon backbone and active Ni nanoparticles electrocatalysts for OER. The pore formation in N-PC/Ni composite is also proposed because of carbothermic reduction. The N-PC/Ni composite is fully studied as electrocatalysts for OER. Due to increased active surface area, enhanced electronic conductivity and reactivity, the designed N-PC/Ni composite exhibits superior OER performance with a low Tafel slope (-88 mV/dec) and a low overpotential as well as excellent long-term stability in alkaline solution. Our proposed rational design strategy may provide a new way to construct other advanced metal/heteroatom-doped composites for widespread application in electrocatalysis.

Herein, we firstly prepared bimetallic oxyhydroxide NiFeOOH layer on Fe2O3 photoanode through a simple electroless ligand-regulated oxidation method in order to build highly-matched semiconductor/cocatalyst interface. Benefited from the accelerated OER kinetics and low overpotential of bimetallic oxyhydroxide NiFeOOH, the resultant Fe2O3/NiFeOOH core-shell with strongly-bound heterojunction interface possesses better visible light absorption, enhanced photocurrent density (1.83 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V-RHE) and good stability than bare Fe2O3 and semi-FeOOH or NiOOH decorated Fe2O3 photoanodes. We believe this work provides a new pathway for designing high-quality contact interface of various photoelectrode/catalyst.									119	6	0	0	4	0	119			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000514218900027

In these batteries, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurs on the air electrode during charging. This study proposes a method for improving the OER electrode performance. The method involves sequentially depositing a Ni underlayer, Sn whiskers, and a Ni protection layer on the metal mesh. Small and uniform gas bubbles form on the Ni/Sn/Ni mesh, leading to low overpotential and a decrease in the overall resistance of the OER electrode. The results of a simulated life cycle test indicate that the Ni/Sn/Ni mesh has a life cycle longer than 1,300 cycles when it is used as the OER electrode in 6M KOH.									10	0	1	0	0	0	10			2090-3529	2090-3537		WOS:000404192200001

In this research, a catalyst of continuous cobalt-cobalt oxide (Co-CoO) lateral heterostructures implanted with well-dispersed rhodium (Rh) atoms and shelled over conductive porous 1D copper (Cu) nano-supports for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in both freshwater and seawater under alkaline condition is proposed. It is found that synergistic effects coming from uniform Rh atoms at doping level and Co-CoO heterostructures afford rich multi-integrated active sites and excellent charge transfer, thereby effectively promoting both HER and OER activities. The material requires overpotentials of 107.3 and 137.7 mV for HER and 277.7 and 260 mV for OER to reach an output of 10 mA cm(-1) in freshwater and mimic seawater, respectively, surpassing earlier reported catalysts. Compared to a benchmark a Pt/C//RuO2-based two-electrode electrolyzer, a device derived from the 1D-Cu@Co-CoO/Rh on copper foam delivers comparable cell voltages of 1.62, 1.60, and 1.70 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in freshwater, mimic seawater, and natural seawater, respectively, together with robust stability. These results evidence that 1D-Cu@Co-CoO/Rh is a promising catalyst for green hydrogen generation via freshwater and seawater electrolysis applications.									14	1	0	0	0	0	15			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000704757500001	34623752	
J	Amin, Hatem M. A.; Baltruschat, Helmut					Baltruschat, Helmut/0000-0003-3111-1427			How many surface atoms in Co3O4 take part in oxygen evolution? Isotope labeling together with differential electrochemical mass spectrometry								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				19	37			25527	25536		10.1039/c7cp03914j				OCT 7 2017	2017	Understanding the mechanism underlying the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on oxides is crucial for the development of many energy storage systems. Here, the mechanism of OER on a Co3O4 spinel catalyst is investigated in alkaline media using O-18-labeling combined with differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). This work unravels the role of surface oxygen of the oxide in the OER. It is shown that in (H2O)-O-18-containing electrolyte the amount of (18OO)-O-16 evolved increases from cycle to cycle together with a concomitant decrease of the amount of O-16(2) with each cycle before reaching a steady-state value. (OO)-O-18-O-16 is also evolved from a (H2O)-O-16 solution on a Co3O4 electrode pre-treated in (H2O)-O-18-containing solution, indicating the formation of the O-18-labeled oxide in the previous step. Therefore, the oxide layer takes part in OER via an oxygen exchange mechanism. The total number of oxygen atoms of the oxide participating in OER is 0.1 to 0.2% of the total oxide loading, corresponding to about 10-30% of the surface atoms; these represent the catalytically active sites. Moreover, the real surface area of the catalyst is estimated using different methods (namely the ball model, double layer capacitance method, redox peak method, isotope exchange), and compared to the BET data. The surface areas calculated from the BET data, ball model and redox peak method are similar for small particles, which indicates their smooth surface; however they are smaller than that estimated from double-layer capacitance. For larger particles, the much larger surface area estimated from the redox peak in comparison to that expected from the ball model seems to be due to their roughness. Thus, this work highlights the importance of probing the mechanism when investigating the OER activity of a catalyst.									40	2	0	0	0	0	40			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000412271600031	28900635

In this study, we developed a series of porous cobalt-iron bimetal phosphide nanoarchitectures (p-CoFeP-x) with tunable contents and pore structures to act as catalysts for electrochemical oxygen evolution. A reasonable intrinsic activity and high density of the active site could be realized by adjusting the amount of zinc in a Prussian blue analogue precursor. The optimized catalyst (pCoFeP-0.35) exhibited a low overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 48.8 mV.dec(-1). Moreover, the p-CoFeP-0.35+Pt/C electrode pair used in a water splitting cell exhibited a performance comparable to that of the commercial RuO2+Pt/C cell, along with a higher stability. Furthermore, the p-oFeP-0.35+Pt/C mixture applied in a rechargeable zinc-air battery as oxygen electrocatalyst outperformed the RuO2+Pt/C mixture. The presented findings can provide guidance for optimizing porous bimetal phosphide catalysts for energy related applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Particularly, the active alloy species can be tuned to be Fe(0.64)Ni(0.36 )and FeNi(3 )and the microscopic structures of the catalysts show to be nanotubes, nanoflowers and nanosheets upon different atomic ratio of Fe2+ to Ni2+. In an alkaline media, the FeNi3@ NC (1 : 3) catalyst exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activities, which only requires an overpotential of 277 mV to reach a current density of 20 mA/cm(2). At the same time, FeNi3@ NC(1 3) displays no obvious activity loss after continuous running for 30 h at 20 mA/cm (2), indicating a good durability. The excellent performances of the alloy catalysts in alkaline solution can be ascribed to their microstructural features : (1) The composites made by NC shell and alloy cores create copious active sites; (2) The NC coating layer prevents the erosion of alloy nanoparticles which thus improves the durability; (3) The three-dimensional structures well promote mass transfer and effectively suppress the gas peeling effect.									4	2	0	0	0	0	5			0251-0790			WOS:000539095800027

All samples were grinded into size of les 63 mum and pelletized using 2.5 g mixture of ilmenite ore with coke based on C/O molar ratio of 1:3 (carbon to reducible oxygen). The carbothermal reduction was conducted in a horizontal tube furnace using 0.1 L/min of argon gas flow at temperature of 1200degC. The ultimate and proximate analysis of carbon reductant was investigated using carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur (CHONS) analyzer. The phase evolutions and chemical composition analysis was conducted using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) for raw ilmenite and reduced ilmenite with coke, respectively. The reduction time was set with 2, 3 and 4 hours to understand the phase evolutions. It was found that Langkawi ilmenite ore contained mainly higher TiO2 and hematite, Fe2O3 where the phases of FeTiO3 and titanomagnetite, (Fe2TiO4-Fe3O4) were detected using XRD. The phase of FeTiO3 evolved into the production of Fe, FeO, TiC, TiO2 and Fe3C when increased the reduction time from 2 to 4 hours. The amount of Fe2O3 production was decreased from 59.16 to 47.02 wt%, while higher value of TiO2 was obtained, increasing from 25.2 to 29.1 wt% due to the reduction of TiO2 to Ti3O5 as the reduction time increased. TiC content is also detected when the reduction time increased by reducing TiCxOy into TiC.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0255-5476			INSPEC:21710660

Herein, we report a hybrid photocatalyst consisting of Ag-3 PO4 nanoparticles in situ grown on the surface of two-dimensional MoSe2 nanoarchitectures acting as a noble-metal-free cocatalyst for photocatalytic oxygen evolution under LED-light irradiation. The MoSe2/Ag3PO4 heterojunctions exhibited an obviously enhanced activity for photocatalytic O-2 generation compared with pure Ag3PO4 or the physical mixed samples with the same component, and the MoSe2/Ag3PO4 composite with an optimal ratio of cocatalysts demonstrated the highest O-2 evolution rate of 182 mu mol.L-1.g(-1).h(-1). The highly photocatalytic performance could be mainly ascribed to the formation of close and large contact interface between MoSe2 and Ag3PO4 via in situ preparation method, leading to ultrafast interfacial charge migration and highly efficient charge separation. More importantly, introduction of MoSe2 cocatalyst not only could promote light harvesting and provide more active adsorption sites, but also prevent the photocorrosion of the Ag3PO4 during the photocatalytic reaction. This work may open up new insights for the introduction of a noble-metal-free MoSe2 as an effective cocatalyst for solar energy conversion to achieve O-2 generation.									78	7	0	0	5	0	78			2168-0485			WOS:000467351200051

The catalysts were identified using X-ray diffractometry (XRD), specific surface measurement (BET), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), UV-Vis diffusion refraction spectroscopy (DRS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The photocatalytic activity of 2% WO3-TiO2 with different oxygen vacancies was investigated employing splitting of water for O-2 evolution. The results indicate that appropriate oxygen vacancies can obviously improve the photocatalytic activity of 2% WO3-TiO2 catalysts, and using Fe3+ as an electron acceptor under UV irradiation in 12 It, the maximum rate for O-2 evolution is 667 mu mol/(L.h).

The electrochemical activities of these two electrodes for oxygen evolution (OE) reaction were examined by electrochemical tests. In comparison with F-PbO2, PTFE-F-PbO2 electrode exhibited larger active surface area and higher oxygen vacancy deficiency, which resulted in its higher electrocatalytic activity for OE. In addition, both exchange current density and activation energy of the electrodes for OE were calculated in terms of active surface area. The values of exchange current density and activation energy in 0.5 mol.L-1 H2SO4 aqueous solution were 1.125x10(-3) mA.cm(-2) and 18.62 kJ.mol(-1) for PTFE-F-PbO2, and 8.384x10(-4) mAcm(-2) and 28.98 kJ.mol(-1) for F-PbO2, respectively. Because these values are calculated on the basis of the active surface areas of the electrodes, the enhanced activity of PTFE-F-PbO2 can be attributed to an increase in oxygen vacancy deficiency of PbO2 due to doping by PTFE. The influence of PTFE adulteration on the activity of PbO2 film electrode for OE was investigated in detail in this study.									11	7	0	0	2	0	16			1004-9541	2210-321X		WOS:000262274100011

Herein, Fe-doped Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets directly grown on commercial Ni foam (FeNiOH/NF) were fabricated through a facile hydrothermal method in (NH4)(2)S2O8 aqueous solution containing iron salts. The integrated architecture with hierarchical pores is beneficial for exposing sufficient catalytically active sites and providing evaluated structural and electrical properties. In particular, the Fe-induced partial-charge-transfer greatly modifies the electronic structure of Ni(OH)(2), which evidently promotes the electrocatalytic activity of the as-fabricated FeNiOH/NF for OER and HER. Thus, as an electrocatalyst for OER, FeNiOH/NF exhibits excellent activity with overpotentials of 271 and 318 mV to deliver current densities of 20 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a small Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH, demonstrating the very high level of novelty and sufficient improvement over the current state-of-the-art IrO2 electrocatalyst. Most importantly, there is an increase in overpotential by only 23 mV during continuous reaction for over 20 h at an applied potential of 1.62 V to deliver current density of 500 mA cm(-2). The as-fabricated electrocatalyst also enables high HER activity with robust stability. Finally, an overall water splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can be obtained at a cell voltage of 1.67 V in a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer using FeNiOH/NF as both anode and cathode, along with impressive operation stability. This development with significant over the state-of-the-art IrO2 electrocatalyst can be widely extended to large-scale fabrication of versatile electrocatalysts for efficient water splitting technology.									107	9	0	0	1	0	107			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000434692000036	29845142

Herein, a strong-coupling 0D/2D NiS/Bi2WO6 heterogeneous electrocatalyst was successfully synthesized through a facile hydrothermal and calcination route. Electrochemistry results revealed that the NiS/Bi2WO6-4 catalyst not only exhibited competitive OER catalytic activity with smaller overpotential (527 mV) and lower Tafel slope (238 mV dec(-1)) but also delivered long-term stability (at 1.73 V vs. RHE for 13 h). Such excellent properties are mainly due to (1) the substantial active sites are provided by NiS nanoparticles evenly anchored on Bi2WO6 nanosheets, (2) the O-Ni-S bond structure acts as the bridge in heterointerface, which improves the charge and mass transfer rate as well as stabilizes the heterostructure, (3) Most importantly, the bonding of Ni and O changes the valence-bond environment around the nickel species, which is more conducive to balance between the adsorption of OH- and the desorption of O-2 in the oxygen evolution reaction. This non-precious NiS/Bi2WO6 heterojunction catalyst is designed with the 0D/2D heterointerface engineering, which may open a new train of thought to design new promising and highly efficient OER electrocatalysts.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000568785900005

Nevertheless, it is an effective strategy to explore high efficient OER electrocatalyst and replace OER with hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) of low theoretical potential. Herein, we report a bifunctional CoSe-3 catalyst with nanoporous structure via one-step electrodeposition. In comparison with CoSe-2 and CoSe-4, CoSe-3 catalyst shows outstanding catalytic performance and stability towards OER with a low overpotenial of 254 mV vs RHE to achieve 10 mA cm(-2)and a high durability (16 h at 100 mA cm(-2)). CoSe-3 further shows excellent performance towards HzOR with an enomous current density of 278 mA cm(-2)at 0.4 V vs RHE and a high stability (24 h at 200 mA cm(-2)). Specially, the mechanism reason of the remarkably enhanced catalytic performance of bifunctional CoSe-3 electrocatalyst was revealed. This can be associated with its uniformly distributed nanoporous structure, high conductivity induced by the excess of Se content, large ECSA and its superaerophobic surface caused by nanoporous structure of CoSe-3.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000570808800001

Finding cost-effective and robust catalysts to replace the state-of-the-art noble metal materials is hence urgent. In this work, we develop a molecular iridium complex that selectively and uniformly anchors on the surface of manganese oxide which is interconnected with a nitrogen-doped carbon forming a nanorod material. In the subsequent pyrolysis step, isolated Ir atoms are created on the manganese oxide surface and they strongly interact with the adjacent Mn. Through physicochemical characterization and computational studies, we demonstrate that the incorporation of Ir single-atom species in the MnOx/N-C composite promotes the electrochemical water oxidation catalysis. The new material shows excellent activity in the oxygen evolution reaction in 0.1 M KOH with an overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Importantly, compared to a sample conventionally prepared with H2IrCl6, the novel Ir-MnOx/N-C catalyst not only is more efficient, but also demonstrates improved redox stability without suffering from Ir leaching. Our approach opens up new opportunities for the rational design of site-isolated materials for catalysis in the field of energy applications.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000490983100030

Copper matte with 59% Cu and 22.6% S in weight was oxidized at 1523K by bubbling of AT + O-2 gas through a submerged nozzle. The effects of oxygen partial pressure and flow rate of gas on the oxidation rate of matte were discussed. The desulfurization rate and the evolution rate Of SO2 gas of copper matte were significantly influenced by the oxygen partial pressure, but the dependence on gas flow rate was, rather complicated. The desulfurization rate and evolution rate Of SO2 gas of copper matte, were described by the mass transfer rate through the gas film around the rising gas bubbles. Thermodynamic correlation equations between the partial pressure of gaseous species and matte composition were incorporated to the kinetic calculation. The present model shows that the reaction path starts to transiently cross over an isobar line Of P-SO2 to asymptotically approach to the particular isobar line drawn in a matte composition plane of %S and %O.

J	Zhang, Xiao; Ma, Huizhong; Zhang, Min; Ma, Yuchen								Interfacial Charge-Transfer Excitons Help the Photoreduction of CO2 on TiO2								ACS CATALYSIS				12	18			11024	11035		10.1021/acscatal.2c03795		AUG 2022		SEP 16 2022	2022	Photoreduction of CO2 into organic molecules under the catalysis of anatase TiO2 has aroused great attention. Its reaction mechanism is still far from understood. It is generally thought that the redox reactions take place after exciton dissociation, and hence previous investigations only consider the role of isolated photoelectrons in the reduction reactions. Our first-principles calculations identify that interfacial charge-transfer (CT) excitons might play a crucial role in the reduction reactions. CT excitons can not only simplify the previously proposed two-electron processes in the reduction of CO2 -> HCOOH and HCOOH -> HCO to one-electron processes but also cut down substantially the reaction barriers that have been predicted to be insurmountable. Stability of the key intermediate radical CO2 center dot- can also be greatly enhanced with the help of the CT exciton. We also discover that the remaining holes after the reduction of CO2 to HCOO can promote the dissociation and the oxidation of H2O at the bridging oxygen atom with an extremely low barrier. This can not only provide a timely supply of protons for the reduction reactions but also lead to the formation of the bridging oxygen vacancy. The oxygen vacancy could be the active site for either further H2O dissociation or the reduction of CO2 to CO. Our work reveals the synergism between the reduction and the oxidation half-reactions and demonstrates that the role of excitons before their dissociation might require attention in designing photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. Depositing hole acceptors with specific features onto the anatase surface might be beneficial for the utilization of excitons and therefore improving the photocatalytic efficiency of CO2 reduction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000848422500001

The preparation of this highly interesting porous material, inaccessible by common synthetic procedures, occurs in a solvent-free reaction upon addition of an easily detachable template molecule, yielding single crystals of MUV-3. This methodology can be extended to other metals and imidazolate derivatives, allowing the preparation of ZIF-8, ZIF-67, and the unprecedented iron(II) ZIFs Fe(2-ethylimidazolate)(2) and Fe(2-methylbenzimidazolate)(2). The different performance of MUV-3 toward NO sorption, in comparison to ZIF-8, results from the chemisorption of NO molecules, which also causes a gate-opening behavior. Finally, the controlled pyrolysis of MUV-3 results in a N-doped graphitic nanocomposite that exhibits extraordinary performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with low overpotential at different current densities (316 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), low Tafel slope (37 mV per decade), high maximum current density (710 mA cm(-2) at 2.0 V vs RHE), and great durability (15 h).									44	2	0	0	2	0	45			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000466987900049	30973716

Analysis showed that the surface area of the synthesized IrO2 was higher than that of high-surface-area Pt black. During fuel cell operation, IrO2 increased the overpotential slightly; however during water electrolysis, the mixed Pt-IrO2 electrocatalyst had a considerably higher activity for oxygen evolution. The addition of only a small amount of IrO2 (10-30 mol %) to the oxygen electrode was sufficient for the unitized regenerative fuel cell. (C) 2000 The Electrochemical Society. S0013-4651(99)09-093-X.

Herein, a hypersaline-protected pyrolysis strategy is presented for preparing 3D honeycombed cobalt, nitrogen co-doped carbon nanosheets (Co/N-CNS) by using eco-friendly biomass as a carbon and nitrogen source. During the hypersaline-protected pyrolysis, the pyridinic nitrogen-rich biomass facilitates the formation of highly active Co/N active sites among the resultant Co/N-CNS, while the templating-washing-drying cyclic utilization of salts creates honeycombed pore structures among the Co/N-CNS. Due to the structural features of honeycombed pores and uniform distributed active sites, the Co/N-CNS catalyst offers excellent ORR activity, high durability and methanol-tolerant performance in an alkaline electrolyte. As a demonstration, a primary Zn-air battery using the Co/N-CNS cathode delivers a high power density and excellent operating stability beyond that of commercial Pt/C cathode.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000544637400001	32470954

In this communication, we demonstrate that developing an amorphous borate shell on a NiCo2O4 surface can boost its OER activity in alkaline media. As a 3D catalyst electrode, a NiCo2O4@Ni-Co-B nanoarray on carbon cloth needs an overpotential of only 270 mV to achieve a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, which is 100 mV less than that for a NiCo2O4 nanoarray. Notably, this electrode also demonstrates strong electrochemical durability, maintaining its activity for at least 100 h. The superior activity of NiCo2O4@Ni-Co-B is attributed to the amorphous Ni-Co-B shell on NiCo2O4 favoring the in situ electrochemical generation of more active species during water oxidation.									29	1	0	0	1	0	29			2052-1553			WOS:000410296700015

A three-dimensional petal-like and hierarchically connected nano-structured Ni-Co-S-O composite catalyst was obtained on a nickel foam (NF) substrate by a hydrothermal method. When w(Ni):w(Co)=1:2, the prepared Ni-Co-S-O/NF(1:2) catalyst has a larger electrochemically active area (ECSA) and the best oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance in alkaline water electrolysis. In 1 mol.L-1 KOH alkaline solution, Ni-Co-S-O/NF(1:2) only need 61 and 313 mV to achieve the current density of 10 and 100 mA.cm(-2) respectively. At the same time, its Tafel slope was 155 mV.dec(-1). After tested at a high current density of 100 mA.cm(-2) for 24 h in the alkaline solution, the Ni-Co-S-O/NF(1:2) could still maintain sheet structure and displayed a good durability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-4861			WOS:000649559600019

However, how the OER activity of TMPs varies with the catalyst composition has not been systematically explored. Here, we report the alkaline OER electrolysis of a series of nanoparticulate phosphides containing different equimolar metal (M = Fe, Co, Ni) components. Notable trends in OER activity are observed, following the order of FeP < NiP < CoP < FeNiP < FeCoP < CoNiP < FeCoNiP, which indicate that the introduction of a secondary metal(s) to a mono-metallic TMP substantially boosts the OER performance. We ascribe the promotional effect to the enhanced oxidizing power of bi-and tri-metallic TMPs that can facilitate the formation of MOH and chemical adsorption of OH- groups, which are the rate-limiting steps for these catalysts according to our Tafel analysis. Remarkably, the tri-metallic FeCoNiP pre-catalyst exhibits exceptionally high apparent and intrinsic OER activities, requiring only 200 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) and showing a high turnover frequency (TOF) of >= 0.94 s(-1) at the overpotential of 350 mV.									332	17	0	0	8	0	334			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000429203500006	29780476

However, the bulk NiFe LDHs nanosheets with a large lateral size and bulk thickness hindering the exposure of active sites and reducing the electrocatalytic activity of reactive sites. Herein, the bulk NiFe LDHs nanosheets were successfully exfoliated into 2D ultrathin NiFe LDHs nanosheets by one-step Ar plasma. This unique structure of NiFe LDH increased the surface area and the exposure of active sites improving the electrocatalytic performance for OER. Moreover, Ar plasma also further etched the basal planes of 2D crystals leading to production of more edge and corner sites which had much higher catalytic activity than positions in the basal planes. Therefore, this ultrathin NiFe LDHs nanosheets with rich edges and corners as electrocatalyst showed a good OER activity with a low overpotential of 278 mV at 10 mA/cm(2).					232nd Fall Meeting of the-Electrochemical-Society (ECS)232nd Fall Meeting of the-Electrochemical-Society (ECS)	OCT 01-05, 2017OCT 01-05, 2017	Electrochem SocElectrochem Soc	National Harbor, MDNational Harbor, MD	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1938-5862	1938-6737	978-1-60768-827-3	WOS:000576947000096

Importantly, the CoSe2/Se-rGO showed an enhanced catalytic activity for ORR in alkaline medium with an onset potential of 0.903 V vs. RHE and a half-wave potential of 0.803 V vs. RHE. Its stability and methanol tolerance ability were significantly improved as compared to 20 wt% Pt/C, respectively.

In this work, we report a facile soft template method to synthesize nanosized iridium oxide for electrocatalytic OER in acidic medium. The fabrication process involves thermal treatment of iridium complex and polypyrrole in air.

The nanostructured iridium oxide synthesized at optimal 450 degrees C exhibits low overpotential (291.3 +/- 6 mV) to reach 10 mA/cm(2) current density towards OER, which is better than the commercial iridium oxide. Further investigation indicates that nanosized iridium oxide synthesized at 450 degrees C has high electrochemical active surface area to expose abundant accessible active sites, which can accelerate the OER rate. This method can also provide new guidance to prepare other metal oxide nanoparticles for various applications. (c) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, an amorphous mixed cobalt-iron hydroxide (CoFe(OH)(x)) with a uniform hollow hierarchical structure is exploited and applied in the OER. The amorphous structure can supply abundant defects and reaction sites, and the hollow hierarchical microspheres with numerous vertically grown nanosheets on the shell can provide sufficient contact between electrolyte and active species, thus exposing abundant accessible active sites for electrocatalysis. As a result, the as-prepared CoFe(OH)(x) exhibits a superior electrocatalytic OER activity in alkaline medium with a low overpotential of 293 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 67.4 mV dec(-1). CoFe(OH)(x) also shows significantly enhanced OER activity compared to Co(OH)(2) owing to its optimized electronic structure and conductivity tuned by the introduction of Fe. The turnover frequency of CoFe(OH)(x) (55.7 x 10(-3) s(-1)) is 8.8 times larger than that of Co(OH)(2) (6.3 x 10(-3) s(-1)).

Here, we prepare Kx approximate to 0.25IrO2 catalyst that exhibits an excellent OER activity compared to IrO2, which is univerally acknoweledged as a state-of-the-art OER catalyst. The prepared catalyst reflects a small overpotential 0.35 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a lower Tafel slope (65 mV dec(-1)) compared to that for IrO2 (74 mV dec(-1)). The performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray adsorption (XAS) experiments indicate that the Ir-site of Kx approximate to 0.25IrO2 has a lower valence and more Ir-5d occupied states, suggesting more electrons on the Ir site. The extra electrons located on the Ir site and distorted IrO6 octahedral symmetry have a significant effect on the 5d orbital energy distribution which is verified by our DOS calculation. The performed DFT calculations state that the Kx approximate to 0.25IrO2 essentially obtains good OER performance because it has a lower theoretical overpotential (0.50 V) compared to IrO2 (0.61 V).									60	5	0	0	6	0	61			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000368563000097	26694881

To produce hydrogen energy through seawater electrolysis, highly active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are required. Here, we report the development of a Ni-doped FeOOH anode for high-efficiency anion exchange membrane alkaline seawater electrolysis. The Ni-doped FeOOH anode showed an overpotential of only 301 mV in half-cell tests, reaching a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH + seawater. An anion exchange membrane electrolyzer catalyzed by Ni-doped FeOOH exhibited a current density of 729 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH + seawater with an energy conversion efficiency of 76.35%. Compared to the reported AEM electrolyzer operated in 1.0 M KOH, our AEM electrolyzer catalyzed with Ni-doped FeOOH operated in 1.0 M KOH + seawater exhibited higher performance.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000641896800047

In this study, a macroporous catalyst layer (macroporous_CL) was proposed as an anode design for AEMWE to enhance the catalyst utilization. A macroporous_CL contains pores of two main size ranges: hundreds of nanometers and hundreds of micrometers. It is prepared using a spraying method to form nanometer-sized pores. The use of a stainless-steel (SUS) porous transport layer (PTL) as the substrate of the spraying method produces micrometer-sized macropores. In an investigation of the effects of the macroporous_CL and conventional catalyst layer (plain_CL) on AEMWE using two different kinds of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, the macroporous_CL exhibited higher performance with lower ohmic and charge-transfer resistances compared to the plain_CL. This performance enhancement was attributed to the improved catalyst utilization and electron transport. Also, the macroporous_CL showed better durability compared to the plain_CL. Therefore, the macroporous_CL has been considered as an alternative anode design for AEMWE. (c) 2022 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Here a universal strategy for the facile synthesis of bimetallic Fe2P-Ni2P heterostructure has been developed. And the catalytic activity of the obtained bimetallic heterostructure had further studied. The sample was obtained by hydrothermal method through mixing the nickel-iron precursors followed by direct phosphating annealing. The catalyst has flower ball morphology that provides a massive active surface area with more active sites. At the same time, the Fe2P-Ni2P bimetallic heterostructure sample has excellent OER catalytic performance under alkaline electrolyte with an overpotential of 317 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution and a low Tafel slope of 58.71 mV dec(-1).

Here, synthesis of Ti3C2@MoO3 nanocomposite by hydrothermal method with improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for overall water splitting is reported. In Ti3C2@MoO3 nanocomposite, Ti3C2 acts as a conductive material to facilitate rapid electron transfer whereas; MoO3 provides long-term stability and prevents Ti3C2 nanosheets from restacking. These combined properties of Ti3C2 nanosheets and MoO3 nanobelts exhibited improved HER and OER performance at a low overpotential of 91 mV and 190 mV at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) with long term durability for 50 h. The strong electronic coupling effect between Ti3C2 MXene and MoO3 nanobelts can accelerate HER/OER kinetics.

The aim is to investigate the influence of the Au sub-layer on the catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of water electrolysis. The properties of the sputtered films are studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrochemical methods of cyclic voltammetry, quasi steady state polarization and chronoamperometry. It is found that by proper variations in the films thickness it is possible to realize synergetic effects leading to essential decrease in Ir loading and the cost of catalysis without sacrifice in efficiency.

IrO2 nanocatalysts with high activity as well as long-term catalytic stability, particularly at high current densities, are highly desirable for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEM-WE). Here, we report a simple and cost-effective strategy for depositing ultrafine oxygen-defective IrOx nanoclusters (1-2 nm) on a high-surface-area, acid-stable titanium current collector (H-Ti@IrOx), through a repeated impregnation-annealing process. The high catalytically active surface area resulting from the small size of IrOx and the preferable electronic structure originating from the presence of oxygen defects enable the outstanding OER performance of H-Ti@IrOx, with low overpotentials of 277 and 336 mV to deliver 10 and 200 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4. Moreover, H-Ti@IrOx also shows an intrinsic specific activity of 0.04 mA cm(catalyst)(-2) and superior mass activity of 1500 A g(Ir)(-1) at an overpotential of 350 mV. Comprehensive experimental studies and density functional theory calculations confirm the important role of oxygen defects in the enhanced OER performance. Remarkably, H-Ti@IrOx can continuously catalyze the OER in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 200 mA cm(-2) for 130 hours with minimal degradation, and with a higher IrOx loading, it can sustain at such a high current density for over 500 hours without significant performance decay, holding substantial promise for use in PEM-WE.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000597647100045

The deposits are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS), Ultroviolet (UV) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The electrochemical characteristics of deposits are explored by cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The effect of copper content in the Cu-Co oxides on the surface morphology, electrochemical and crystallographic properties has been investigated. The introduction of Cu element makes the Cu-Co oxides deposit fine and further lead to high roughness of deposits, which is helpful for the oxides' electrochemical performance. Based on the electrochemical determination, the binary oxide electrodes exhibit better catalysis activity than that of CuO and CO3O4 electrodes for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The increase OER activity has been attributed to the enlarged surface roughness and the new active sites of deposits, according to the results of EIS.

Herein, the one-pot electrodeposition synthesis of hybrid NiFe-phosphate/ phosphide (NiFe-Pi/P) nanosheet arrays on Ni foam (NF) as bifunctional catalytic electrode is freshly proposed. Through electrodeposition process, nano morphology and bimetallic synergism of NiFe-Pi\P can be well controlled, resulting in hybrid micro crystallization, nanosheet array structure, superhydrophilicity and superareophobicity characteristics, all of which guarantee high activity, rich active sites and quick mass transfer process on electrode surface. The fabricated electrode exhibits excellent activity on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the optimum one displays overpotential of 97 mV and 185 mV to acquire current responses to 20 mA cm-2 and 100 mA cm-2 respectively, which are close to those of Pt/C catalyst in alkaline medium. Besides, the electrode shows good activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to deliver 20 mA cm-2 at 255 mV as well. More importantly, in long-term multi-step current electrolysis over 27 h, the symmetrically assembled cell adopting NiFe-Pi/P@NF electrode needs only 1.57 V to get 10 mA cm-2, and negligible voltage elevation is revealed with current density cyclic variations. This work provides practical insights into synthesis of hybrid nanosheet array OWS catalysts in efficient approach and on a large scale.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000817822800003

Substitution experiments of the spinach 33-kDa manganese stabilizing protein by a homologue protein, isolated either from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Phormidium laminosum, or from Escherichia coli as a recombinant thermophilic cyanobacterial protein, showed a significant increase in tolerance to heat inactivation of the oxygen-evolving activity. The results allow us to suggest that thermal inactivation of oxygen evolution in higher plant PSII membranes is due to dissociation of the 33-kDa protein as a consequence of temperature-induced conformational changes, and stabilization can be provided by substitution by a thermostable homologue whose secondary structure and binding to PSII remain unaltered at moderately high temperatures.

Variation of pore structure in coal char particles is too complex to be described only by the invariable structure parameter psi when the random pore model (RPM) is used to describe reaction process. In this paper, the structural parameter psi in random pore model was modified by the pore properties and evolution characteristics of structural parameter were clarified and a new model, modified random pore model (MRPM), was developed. Compared with the simulation results of RPM, it was found that modified random pore model was more satisfied to explain the reaction processes of char, especially at the end of stage. The value of psi changes with specific characteristic which could be explained by the pore structure feature. Using the MRPM, isotherm reactive characteristics of coal chars were analyzed at different temperatures under O2/CO2 atmosphere.					2010 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC 2010)2010 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC 2010)	28-31 March 201028-31 March 2010	IEEE Power Energy Soc.IEEE Power Energy Soc.

Herein, we synthesized a cobalt single atom catalyst anchored on a N-doped carbon framework by a doping-adsorption-pyrolysis strategy. The optimized Co SAs/CN-3 catalyst showed excellent HER and ORR bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, which could be attributed to the highly dispersed Co-N-4 active sites, large specific surface area and abundant pore structure. Density functional theory shows that the isolated active Co-N-4 site shows low hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy, and promotes the adsorption of H and oxygen-containing intermediates in HER and ORR. This work not only provides a new idea for the construction of transition metal catalysts with atomic accuracy but also provides powerful guidance for the development of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000825709800001	35919148

Using these data, the vibrational temperature T-v behind the front of shock waves was measured at temperatures 4000-10 800 K in undiluted oxygen. Determination of T-v was based on the measurements of time histories of absorbance for two wavelengths behind the shock front and on the results of detail calculations of oxygen absorption spectrum. Solving the system of standard quasi-one-dimensional gas dynamics equations and using the measured vibrational temperature, the time evolution of oxygen concentration and other gas parameters in each experiment were calculated. Based on these data, the oxygen dissociation rate constants were obtained for thermal equilibrium and thermal non-equilibrium conditions. Furthermore, the oxygen vibrational relaxation time was also determined at high temperatures. Using the experimental data, various theoretical and empirical models of high-temperature dissociation were tested, including the empirical model proposed in the present work.

To enable efficient PEM-WE in acidic media, iridium (Ir)- or ruthenium (Ru)-based catalysts are indispensable to drive the thermodynamically and kinetically demanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, developing Ir/Ru catalysts with high efficiency and long-term durability still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report one-pot hydrothermal synthesis of ultrafine IrRu intermetallic nanoclusters loaded on conductive, acid-stable, amorphous tellurium nanoparticle support (IrRu@Te). Benefiting from the large exposed electrocatalytically active surface of ultrafine IrRu clusters and the strong electronic coupling between IrRu and Te support, the as-obtained IrRu@Te catalysts show good catalytic performance for the OER in strong acidic electrolyte (i.e., 0.5 M H2SO4), requiring overpotentials of only 220 and 303 mV to deliver 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) and able to sustain continuous OER electrolysis up to 20 h at 10 mA cm(-2) with minimal degradation. Moreover, IrRu@Te exhibits high specific activity, illustrating intrinsically better performance compared with that of unsupported IrRu and other commercial Ir- and Ru-based catalysts. It also demonstrates unprecedentedly high mass activity of 590 A g(IrRu)(-1) at an overpotential of 270 mV, outperforming most Ir- and Ru-based OER catalysts reported in the literature. Furthermore, IrRu@Te catalysts reveal good OER performance in neutral electrolyte as well, holding great potential to be used for PEM-WE in environmentally friendly conditions.

Herein, the synthesis of self-supported directional flake oxygen-incorporated cobalt phosphide arrays (O-CoP) with efficient bifunctional catalytic active sites was achieved by in situ oxidation followed by phosphorization of cobalt metal-organic framework nanosheet arrays (Co-MOF). By controlling the phosphating time, the P/O atomic ratio in the oxygen-incorporated cobalt phosphide could be adjusted, leading to the change of Co3+/Co2+ couples, and thus affecting the electronic environment of the cobalt active site. Benefiting from the tunable electronic structure and unique array architecture, the synthesized catalysts exhibited excellent electrocatalytic water decomposition for both HER and OER. Moreover, in the HER and OER couple system (HER||OER), the optimal O-CoP-40 catalyst delivers a low overpotential of only 1.54 V to obtain the 10 mA cm(-2) and stably-running for 36 h. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the electron-rich P-3p and O-2p orbitals could co-modulate the electronic environment of Co sites, which boosted water dissociation in the HER process and balanced the adsorption/ desorption of intermediates in the OER pathway, resulting in a good overall water splitting. This research provides an effective strategy for the construction of efficient bifunctional phosphide electrocatalysts, as well as contributes to the understanding of anion incorporating to regulate the electronic structure of phosphides.

Herein, we synthesize three novel heterometallic TOCs with the formula of [Ti6Cu2O7(Dmg)(2)(OAc) (4)(iPrO)(6)][H2Ti6Cu2O7(Dmg)(2)(OAc)(4)(iPrO)(8)] ({Ti6Cu2}), [Ti8Cu2O9(Dmg)(2)(OAc)(2)(iPrO)(12)] ({Ti8Cu2}), and [Ti10Co2O6(Dmg)(2)(Pdc)(4)(iPrO)(18)Cl-3] ({Ti10Co2}, DmgH 2 = dimethylglyoxime; PdcH(2) = pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid) using dimethylglyoxime and different carboxylates as the synergistic ligands. By depositing the clusters {Ti6Cu2} and {Ti10Co2} on carbon cloth as electrodes, we investigated the electrocatalytic performance of TOCs for full water splitting for the first time. To reach a 10 mA cm(-2) current density in an alkaline solution, the {Ti10Co2}@CC electrode needs an overpotential as low as 120 and 400 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. In addition, full water-splitting equipment with {Ti10Co2}@CC as a cathode and an anode need only 1.67 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Our work confirmed the potential of noble metal-free TOCs as bifunctional cluster-based electrocatalysts for water splitting, and their activities can be tuned by doping with different metal ions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000818842900001	35748673

The electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the composite anode was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic polarization method. The results indicate that Pb/Pb-MnO2 composite deposit containing 1%~10% (mass fraction, %) MnO2 particles can be obtained in the fluoborate solution of lead plating. In the stimulant evaluation of industrial electrowinning, the composite anode prepared under the optimal conditions is about 300 mV, more active than the pure lead anode at the initial stage of electrolysis, and the stable potential after 24 h is 100 mV lower than that of pure lead anode, which is equal to that of Pb-Ag (0.6%) anode.									8	6	0	0	1	0	13			1004-0609			INSPEC:12250219

Herein, we report a unique bimetallic diphosphide pair (FeP2-NiP2) forming spherical nanocages encapsulated in P-doped carbon layers (FeP2-NiP2@PC) as advanced bifunctional electrocatalyst synthesized by a very facile phosphorization approach. The obtained FeP2-NiP2@PC electrocatalyst exhibits an outstanding OER activity with an ultralow overpotential of 248 mV in 1 M KOH and a low overpotential of 117 mV for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 (@10 mA.cm(-2)). Also it gives an exceptional long-term durability toward OER (60 h) and HER (20 h). Differently from the electrocatalysts as reported, after successive 3000 cycles CV acceleration, its overpotential decreases about 10 mV. Further investigation unveils that the electrochemical activation process boosts in situ phase transformation of oxides and phosphides to oxyhydroxides as the vital intermediates in FeP2-NiP2@PC during OER electrocatalysis. The direct observation of vital intermediates has been rarely reported on Fe/Ni-based phosphide electrocatalysts. Our exploration demonstrates an extraordinarily efficient and stable nonprecious TMP bifunctional electrocatalyst and provides a novel prospect to shed light on the intrinsic OER electrocatalytic behavior of Fe/Ni-based phosphide electrocatalysts.									70	3	0	0	3	0	70			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000507146100068	31841300

The Cu-1c atom with one dangling bond is considered to be a reaction active center. The active center has three kinds of functions: adsorbing oxygen, creating free electrons and catalyzing the redox reaction between the adsorbed oxygen and the detected gas. The findings can deepen comprehending gas sensing mechanisms and give guidance to design high performance sensing material. In addition, the hydrogenation surface-engineering strategy can be employed to enhance sensing performances of other materials.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13				0925-4005		WOS:000519306300032

Our results demonstrate that TTF definitely reduces the overpotential for the OER process and restrains the decomposition of the carbon electrode and solvent during the OER, while the functionality of the redox mediator can change with the electrode materials and morphologies. No free TTF+ was observed in solution during a round-trip galvanostatic ORR/OER cycle on the gold electrode surface. The electrochemically generated TTF+ was mainly consumed by the oxidative decomposition of lithium superoxide (LiO2) in solution but not lithium peroxide (Li2O2) on the electrode surface formed during the ORR, different from that previously proposed. On the other hand, Li2O2 and Li2CO3 were observed during the ORR on the porous carbon electrode surface both in the TTF-free and TTF-containing solutions. The TTF+ can mediate the oxidation of the Li2O2 during the OER. Furthermore, the accumulation of free TTF+ was observed in solution during a round-trip galvanostatic ORR/OER cycle on the porous carbon electrode. The amount of the excess TTF+ in solution well corresponds to that of the byproduct of Li2CO3 formed on the carbon electrode surface. TTF is unlikely to work as an ideal redox mediator at the porous carbon electrode as expected. A better understanding for the mechanism and surface reactions for the ORR/OER cycle on these electrodes has been achieved by the present study.									60	2	0	0	1	0	61			1932-7447			WOS:000380735300035

In the limited studies to date, elemental metallic species are found to be the initial products, which limits the variety of MOF-derived nanomaterials. Here, the pyrolysis of a manganese triazolate MOF is examined carefully in terms of phase transformation, reaction pathways, and morphology evolution in different conditions. Surprisingly, the formation of metal is not detected when manganese triazolate is pyrolyzed in an oxygen-free environment. Instead, a direct transformation into nanoparticles of manganese nitride, Mn2Nx embedded in N-doped graphitic carbon took place. The electrically conductive Mn2Nx nanoparticles show much better air stability than bulk samples and exhibit promising electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction. The findings on pyrolysis mechanisms expand the potential of MOF as a precursor to derive more functional nanomaterials.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				2198-3844		WOS:000604281100001	33643801

Different types of nanoscale MnO2, varying from nanosheets to nanoneedles, are synthesized and assembled on the anode to investigate their catalytic effect on the nonlinear kinetics of the MnO2-catalyzed OER at high current. For -MnO2 nanosheets, periodic current oscillations (PCO) occurr and occupy up to 40% of the total energy consumption. The PCO can help to reduce the energy consumption under constant current conditions. Its amplitude could be twice of that for the previously reported MnO2 grown by an in situ electrochemical method. If the amount of -MnO2 nanoneedles increases, the oscillation disappears. For different Mn oxides, the rate constants of H2O2 decomposition differ, resulting in changes in oscillation features. The results of this study may enable new ideas to improve the efficiency of industrial electrolysis and charging-discharging of supercapacitors.									15	2	0	0	3	0	17			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000347239200017	25382485

However, the serious photocorrosion limits its application in photocatalysis. Here we report a novel strategy to overcome the disadvantage of CdS photocorrosion by fabricating peroxide decomposing active MnO2 thin-layer over CdS nanowires (NWs) and assembling oxygen separation artificial gill to remove nascent formed oxygen in the dispersion. In the meantime, the using non-noble metal NiSe quantum dots (QDs) co-catalyst, NiSe/MnO2-CdS photocatalysts shows excellent photocatalytic over-all water splitting activity and remarkable stability under visible light irradiation without addition of any sacrifice reagent, 455.0 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate and 5.20% of apparent quantum efficiency (AQEs) at 430 nm. Removing nascent formed O-2 from water by artificial gill can prevent the oxygen leading CdS photocorrosion. Photoluminescence spectra and photoelectrochemical measurements indicate that loading NiSe QDs and coating MnO2 thin-layer can also improve transfer of the photogenerated charges in CdS. MnO2 thin-layer can decompose formed hydrogen peroxide and enhance water splitting. Our results could potentially provide a new method for designing and fabricating more stable and efficient CdS-based nanocomposite photocatalysts toward versatile solar energy conversion.

NixSy with different phases are controlled by mass of thiourea from 1 g, 1.5 g, 2 g, 2.5 g-3 g. XRD shows the presence of NiS2, NiS and Ni3S2 in NixSy. Pure Ni3S2 synthesized by 2.5 g thiourea implies easy access to pristine NixSy phase. Notably, only one sample (synthesized by 2 g of thiourea) contains unique NiS phase with special flake accumulation morphology, owning superior performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by electrochemical measurements. It suggests that NiS phase outperforms other NixSy, probably the best phase for OER in NixSy phases. All data confirm the achievement of altering crystal structure of NixSy by tiny changes of sulfurization degree, which may provide a new strategy to prepare enhanced electrocatalysts for OER.

This work reports on novel halogen (X = F, Cl, and Br)-doped carbon dots modifying amorphous cobalt phosphide (X-CDs/CoP), which can be tuned by the choice of X-CDs to have urchin, Pinus bungeana, and Albizia julibrissin type structures. The different characteristics of the various X-CDs led to different formation mechanisms and final structures. As a bifunctional catalyst, urchin-shaped F-CDs/CoP crystals achieve superior electrocatalytic performance, exhibiting excellent HER/OER activity and sustained stability in an alkaline solution. For overall water splitting, they provide current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and require a low cell voltage of 1.48 V in 1 (M) KOH. In addition, the catalytic performance shows negligible degradation after 100 h, thus demonstrating excellent long-term cycling stability. Density functional theory calculations show that the improved electrocatalytic performance of F-CDs/CoP catalysts is due to the coupling interface between CoP and F-CDs, which optimizes the hydrogen/oxygen adsorption energy and accelerates the water splitting kinetics. This work provides guidance for the rational design of transition metal phosphide electrocatalysts with outstanding performance.									23	1	0	0	2	0	23			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000745994300001

Finally, the optimized rose-like mesoporous CuCo2O4/rGO exhibits the best electrochemical properties including catalytic activity and electrochemical stability. Electrochemically, the electrocatalyst exhibits an excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 284 mV for a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and a small Tafel slope of 71.1 mV/dec at a scan rate of 5 mV/s in 1 M KOH. The 8 h time-current test shows the excellent stability. The morphological control method provides an effective solution for improving the performance of the catalyst that can be widely applied to various fields.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000502007800025

Here, we demonstrate that the ultrathin amorphous cobalt-vanadium hydr(oxy)oxide we synthesized is a highly promising electrocatalytic material for the OER with a low overpotential of 0.250 V (even lower down to 0.215 V when supported on Au foam) at 10 mA cm(-2) and a long stable operation time (170 h) in alkaline media. In combination with in situ X-ray absorption spectral characterization and first-principles simulations, we reveal that the ultrathin, amorphous and alloyed structural characteristics have enabled its facile transformation to the desirable active phase, leading to a dramatically enhanced catalytic activity. Our finding highlights the remarkable advantages of the two-dimensional amorphous material and sheds new light on the design of high-performance electrocatalysts.									216	12	0	0	8	0	217			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000438392400008

Here, we present a simple approach to the preparation of cobalt sulfide particles in in situ grown on a nitrogen and sulfur codoped graphene oxide surface. The particle size and phase were controlled by changing the treatment temperature. Cobalt sulfide nanoparticles dispersed on graphene oxide hybrids were successfully prepared by a solid-state thermolysis approach at different temperatures (400, 500, and 600 degrees C) using cobalt thiourea and graphene oxide. X-ray diffraction studies revealed that hybrids prepared at 400 and 500 degrees C result in pure CoS2, phase, whereas the hybrid prepared at 600 degrees C exhibits Co9S8 phase. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies revealed that nitrogen and sulfur simultaneously codoped on the graphene oxide surface, and these sites act to anchor the CoS2 nanoparticles strongly on the GO surface. The strong coupling between CoS2 and N,S-GO was reflected in the improvement of the oxygen electrode potential. CoS2(400)/N,S-GO showed an outstanding oxygen electrode activity with a potential of about 0.82 V against a reversible hydrogen electrode in alkaline medium, which is far better than the performance of precious catalysts such as Pt/C (1.16 V), Ru/C (1.01 V), and Ir/C (0.92 V).									508	18	0	0	17	0	509			2155-5435			WOS:000355964300050

It occurs in NiCo2O4 nanoplatelets., synthesized by the coprecipitation decomposition method using sodium hydroxide as the precipitant. The yield of core-ring hexagonal NiCo2O4 nanoplatelets is greater than 80% at 200 degrees C. A high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy investigation reveals the typical core-ring nanostructure, which shows a strong enrichment of Co in the core with a Co content higher than 80%. A mechanism for the core-ring structure formation is proposed. The core-ring NiCo2O4 can be used as an electrocatalyst for an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline water electrolysis. Compared with the electrodes of ordinary NiCo2O4 and Co(3)O4, or other NiCo2O4 electrodes prepared by alternate methods, the electrode coated by core-ring NiCo2O4 nanoplatelets exhibits the greatest electrocatalytic properties, with an over-potential of 0.315 V at a current density of 1.00 mA cm(-2).									393	20	1	0	18	1	400			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000256231800010

In 1 M KOH, such hollow nanospheres showed an overpotential of 352 mV at a benchmark oxygen evolution reaction (OER) current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which was lower than that of RuO2 (364 mV), Co3O4 hollow nanospheres (410 mV) and C-Co/Co3O4 nanoparticles (462 mV). Importantly, the C-Co/Co3O4 hollow spheres exhibited a small onset potential (1.49 V) due to their more active sites, higher electrical conductivity, larger specific surface area, and excellent electron and ion diffusion permeability. This work provides a strategy to design and fabricate earth-abundant, low-cost electrocatalysts for water splitting in practical applications.									50	4	0	0	3	0	51			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000402734600044

Herein, a feasible strategy is developed for boosting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (LSCF) perovskite oxide by encapsulation of conductive metal-organic frameworks (MOF) of Ni-3(HITP)(2) on the surface via electrospinning and its further implemented post-annealing treatment. The as-prepared La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3@Ni-3(HITP)(2) (LSCF@Ni-3(HITP)(2)) nanofibers (NFs) ex-hibits enhanced OER performance and long-term stability towards OER, delivering a low overpotential of 272 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slope as low as 95 mV dec(-1). It outperforms the pristine LSCF NEs (345 mV, 188 mV dec(-1)), bare Ni-3(HITP)(2) (378 mV, 197 mV dec(-1)), as well as the state-of-the-art RuO2 (314 mV, 129 mV dec(-1)). The advanced OER activity is mainly attributable to the synergistic effect of unique 1D (dimensional) NEs structure and the coupled conductive MOF, which endows intrinsic electrical conductivity, fast charge transfer kinetics and favorable mass transportion. Our approach represents a solid step toward exploration of perovskite oxide-based catalysts for high-efficient water oxidation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent advances of metal-organic frameworks and their composites toward oxygen evolution electrocatalysis								MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY				19						100597	10.1016/j.mtener.2020.100597		JAN 2021		MAR 2021	2021	Electrolyzed water technology for environmentally friendly hydrogen production and rechargeable metal-air batteries has become a research hotspot in the scientific research community to solve the energy crisis and environmental pollution. The key step in these energy conversion processes is the typical four-electron involved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with intrinsically sluggish kinetics, urgently needed to accelerate. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have the characteristics of strict topology, homogenous dispersed metal ions or metal ion cluster, and ultra-high specific surface area for providing abundant active sites for OER electrocatalysis. In this review, the recent progresses of MOFs and MOF-based composites for OER electrocatalysis are presented. Materials design strategies, including metal ion doping, ligand modification, two-dimensional morphology, and the active center optimization of MOF electrocatalysts are firstly summarized to enhance the catalytic activity. This highlight will then focus on the MOF-based heterostructural catalyst hybrid with hydroxide/oxide, sulfide, and noble metal units. This review will also figure out the correlation between microstructure and electrocatalytic performance and provide the new insight to increase the active sites number and enhance the intrinsic activity of MOFs and MOF-based electrocatalysts. Lastly, some scientific challenges and outlooks are also proposed to promote the next-generation advanced MOFs and MOF-based electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy conversion devices.

However, the electrocatalytic process on semiconductor-based heterostructures such as carbon-supported g-C3N4 still suffers from a huge energy loss because of poor electron mobility. Here, we demonstrated a concept that the conjugation of g-C3N4 with crystalline carbon can improve the in-plane electron mobility and make interior triazine units more electro-active for ORR and OER. As a result, the Co metal coordinated g-C3N4 with crystalline carbons (CoC3N4/C) showed a remarkable electrocatalytic performance toward both ORR and OER. For example, it displayed an onset potential of 0.95 V for ORR and an overpotential of 1.65 V for OER at 10 mA cm(-2), which are comparable and even better than those of benchmark Pt, RuO2, and other carbon nitride-based electrocatalysts. As a proof-of-concept application, we employed this catalyst as an air electrode in the rechargeable aluminum-air battery, which showed more rechargeable and practicable than those of Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts in two-electrode coin battery. The characterization results identified that the good performance of Co-C3N4/C was primarily attributed to the enhanced in-plane electron mobility by crystalline carbon conjugation and the Co-coordinated g-C3N4 along with nitrogen-doped carbons.									124	3	0	0	11	0	124			2155-5435			WOS:000426804100038

Aqueous Zn batteries are considered a promising technology to meet the safety requirements, but are limited by their inferior electrochemical properties. Combining with zinc-air batteries is an effective way to improve the energy density of Zn batteries by introducing the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction into the whole electrochemical process. Hence, Ni3S2 nanosheets were utilized as a novel cathode for both Zn batteries and hybrid Zn-air-metal batteries (ZAMBs), of which the energy storage mechanisms were clearly demonstrated. The hybrid ZAMBs exhibited an evident two-stage charge and discharge process and displayed highly stable discharge platforms of 1.7 V and 1.1 V, and could work for more than 300 hours, uninterruptedly. More importantly, sodium polyacrylate served as the separator for the flexible hybrid Zn battery prototype, which shows superior electrochemical properties in an alkaline environment to other hydrogel membranes. This work could introduce a novel method to greatly improve the energy density of Zn batteries and further promote the development of hybrid Zn battery systems.									37	2	0	0	1	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000481578000017

However, the mechanisms on how Mn deficiency and cerium (Ce) addition affects the photosynthetic carbon reaction of plants under manganese deficiency are still poorly understood. In this study, the main aim was to determine Mn deficiency and cerium addition effects in key enzymes of CO2 assimilation of maize. Maize plants were cultivated in Hoagland's solution. They were subjected to Mn deficiency and to Ce administered in the Mn-present Hoagland's media and Mn-deficient Hoagland's media. The growth condition, chlorophyll synthesis, and oxygen evolution were significantly destroyed by manganese deficiency, the activities of ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate caroxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), and Rubisco activase, and their genes expressions were inhibited by Mn deficiency. However, Ce treatment promoted the chlorophyll synthesis, oxygen evolution, and the activities of two key enzymes in CO2 assimilation. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was carried out, and the results showed that the mRNA expressions of Rubisco small subunit (rbcS), Rubisco large subunit (rbcL), and Rubisco activase subunit (rca) in the cerium-treated maize were obviously increased. One of the possible mechanisms of carbon reaction promoted by Ce is that the Ce treatment resulted in the enhancements of Rubisco and Rubisco activase mRNA amounts, the protein levels, and activities of Rubisco and Rubisco activase, thereby leading to the high rate of photosynthetic carbon reaction and enhancement of maize growth under Mn-deficient conditions. Together, the experimental study implied that Ce could partly substitute for magnesium and increase the oxidative stress-resistance of spinach chloroplast grown in Mn-deficiency conditions, but the mechanisms need further study.									20	2	0	0	15	0	21			0163-4984	1559-0720		WOS:000290727800032	20480399

Herein, the strategy of doping a metal boride with a rare earth metal oxide has been explored to develop a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst. The novel electrocatalyst CeOx-NiB consists of CeOx-doped NiB supported on nickel foam, and was fabricated by a one-step mild electroless plating reaction. Remarkably, the CeOx-NiB@NF electrode delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of only 19 mV and 274 mV for the HER and OER, respectively. Two-electrode electrolyzers with the CeOx-NiB@NF electrode require only 1.424 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting in 1.0 M KOH, outperforming the Pt-C/NF parallel to IrO2/NF electrolyzer. Meanwhile, the electrode also has good stability (can work for 100 hours at 10 mA cm(-2)) and industrial-grade current density. This work provides a new idea for the development of efficient and durable non-precious metal catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000730298300001	34908068

The materials design uses the thermal conversion of a metal organic framework (ZIF-67) functionalized with molecular vanadium oxide clusters ([V10O28](6-)) to give a nanostructured composite where redoxactive crystalline Co-V-oxide nanoparticles (similar to 5 nm) are firmly embedded in a high surface-area N-doped graphitic carbon matrix. The composite shows high activity, efficiency and stability for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline conditions. In addition, proof of concept studies show fast and reversible Li storage behavior. Based on this new materials design principle, the divergent fields of electrocatalysis and battery materials design could be linked to enable a more efficient, converging materials design approach.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000471010900015

The phase structure of Co-Ni mixed oxide was measured by XRD. The electrocatalytic behavior of Co-Ni mixed oxide for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was investigated with cyclic voltammetry, steady-state polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The electrode-posited Co-Ni mixed oxide exhibited higher catalytic activity and stability. The optimum OER performance was obtained on the Co-Ni mixed oxide with spinel-type NiCo2O4 phase deposited from the solution with n (Co2+) / n (Ni2+) = 1. The OER on Co-Ni mixed oxide showed two Tafel slopes, one (b = 40 similar to 48 mV/(degrees)) at low over-potential and the other (b = 110 - 120 mV/(degrees)) at high overpotential. The second order of reaction order with respect to [OH-] at low overpotential changed to first order at high overpotential. The standard electrochemical enthalpy of activation for OER was determined. A possible mechanism involving the formation of a physisorbed H2O2 intermediate in a slow electrochemical step for OER was presented, which could account for the values of the experimental results.									7	8	0	0	0	0	13			0253-9837	1872-2067		WOS:000221271900016

We report here the electrochemical stability and metal composition of these electrocatalyst films when subjected to sustained electrolysis in strong base at 200 mA/cm(2), conditions that are better aligned with practical commercial-scale electrolysis. We found that most of the iron in the film was liberated during the first 24 hr of electrolysis and deposited on the cathode. We confirmed these observations by interrogating the relative metal content of the electrodes before and after electrolysis by using X-ray fluorescence, energy-dispersive X-ray, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. The rate at which iron was leached from FeNiOx anodes was reduced at 10 mA/cm(2) but was still significant. These results highlight that one must account for the instability of this mixed-metal composition when drawing structure-property relationships and when considering the scale-up of electrocatalysts.									69	2	0	0	1	0	72			2451-9294			WOS:000408620500021

However, the poor oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR and OER) activities in discharge and charge processes cause low energy efficiency, poor electrolyte stability and short cycle life. This requires the development of efficient cathode catalysts to dramatically improve the Li-O-2 battery performances. MnO2-based materials are recognized as efficient and low-cost catalysts for a Li-O-2 battery cathode. Here, we report a controllable approach to synthesize hierarchical porous delta-MnO2 nanoboxes by using Prussian blue analogues as the precursors. The obtained products possess hierarchical pore size and an extremely large surface area (249.3 m(2) g(-1)), which would favour oxygen transportation and provide more catalytically active sites to promote ORR and OER as the Li-O-2 battery cathode. The battery shows enhanced discharge capacity (4368 mA h g(-1)@0.08 mA cm(-2)), reduced overpotential (270 mV), improved rate performance and excellent cycle stability (248 cycles@500 mA h g(-1) and 112 cycles@1000 mA h g(-1)), in comparison with the battery with a VX-72 carbon cathode. The superb performance of the hierarchical porous delta-MnO2 nanoboxes, together with a convenient fabrication method, presents an alternative to develop advanced cathode catalysts for the Li-O-2 battery.									70	7	0	0	4	0	71			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000360831100011	26290962

Subsequent in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis can dynamically track the conversion from inactive Co-OH and Co-O species into active CoN4 sites. The critical transition occurs at 700 degrees C and becomes optimal at 900 degrees C, generating the highest intrinsic activity and four-electron selectivity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). DFT calculations elucidate that the ORR is kinetically favored by the thermal-induced compressive strain of Co-N bonds in CoN4 active sites formed at 900 degrees C. Further, we developed a two-step (i.e., Co ion doping and adsorption) Co-N-C catalyst with increased CoN4 site density and optimized porosity for mass transport, and demonstrated its outstanding fuel cell performance and durability.									58	5	0	0	0	0	59			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000626964500001	33492674

Here, hierarchical NixCo1-xSe2 porous nanosheets are synthesized on Cu nanowire arrays (CNW) to fabricate highly efficient core/shell structure integrated OER electrode. Highly conductive CNW arrays are first obtained via the reduction of the pre-prepared CuO nanowire arrays. NixCo1-x precursor nanosheets are then grown on CNW via hydrothermal route, and the following selenylation led to in situ formation of NixCo1-xSe2 porous nanosheet. In the integrated electrode, the highly conductive CNW core can realize efficient electron transport. The hierarchical core/shell nanoarray structure can provide abundant catalytic active sites and more void space to release gas bubbles, and meanwhile prevent the underneath Cu nanowire core from oxidation. The synergistic effects of optimized components and smart structure of the integrated electrode afford a remarkable OER activity with a low potential of 1.423 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) current density, a small Tafel of 58 mV dec(-1), and excellent stability in alkaline electrolyte. The present fabrication approach offers a direction in the design and synthesis of integrated catalysts on conductive substrates for promising electrocatalytic applications.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			2196-7350			WOS:000468010200012

Pristine CaCu3Fe4O12 powder sample was synthesized under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions of 8 GPa and 1000 degrees C, and a portion was treated by ball milling for 120 min to obtain a powder sample with smaller particle size. The specific surface area significantly increased from 0.38 to 10.30 m(2)g(1) by ball-milling, leading to increased OER activity. However, it was found that the milling did not improve the OER activity efficiency in proportion to that expected from the increase in specific surface area as determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis of adsorption/desorption isotherms measured with nitrogen gas because the crystallinity was lowered by ball milling, which suppressed the catalytic activity. This study provides important information on how to achieve the best OER catalytic performance in terms of both size and crystallinity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1345-9678	1347-5320		WOS:000575859300051

Decahedral BiVO4 was synthesized through a facile hydrothermal process, which exhibited superior charge injection efficiency to the nanoporous counterpart prepared by the traditional method. More importantly, the crystal size and facet proportion of BiVO4 decahedrons were facilely controlled. The charge separation efficiency can be significantly improved with a reduction in the crystal size and an increase in (040) facet exposure. A new method was developed for rate law analysis: illumination intensity-modulated oxygen evolution reaction rate versus open circuit potential difference, which suggested that the surface reaction kinetics was not affected by facet regulation. Furthermore, after decorating the FeOOH and NiOOH as dual oxygen evolution cocatalysts, an enhanced photocurrent density of 3.2 mA c(-2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and interfacial charge injection efficiency of 97.0% can be reached. Our work inspires the development of facet-regulated BiVO4 photoanodes with high charge injection efficiency in the PEC field and provides a feasible route to enhance its charge separation efficiency.

Exploring bifunctional catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with high efficiency, low cost, and easy integration is crucial for future renewable energy systems. Herein, we report the in situ controllable synthesis of hierarchical MoP/Ni2P heterostructures on 3D Ni foam (MoP/Ni2P/NF) and their application as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting. The hierarchical heterostructures are achieved by a facile hydrothermal approach to obtain the Mo-based/NF precursor, followed by a subsequent in situ phosphorization procedure. Through manipulating the concentration of ammonium molybdate for the preparation of the precursor as well as the phosphorization temperature, the optimal MoP/Ni2P/NF can be achieved which can efficiently catalyze both the OER and HER in alkaline electrolytes. The superior performance with robust durability is mainly attributed to unique hierarchical heterostructures and collaborative advantages of bimetallic phosphides, as well as the 3D porous conductive substrate. As an integrated high-performance non-noble electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, the MoP/Ni2P/NF electrode requires a cell voltage of only 1.55 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution. This work highlights the importance of the design and construction of hierarchical heterostructures for efficient overall water splitting.									225	11	0	0	4	0	227			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000406672400052

Herein, Au/h-BN(O) and Pt/h-BN(O) nanohybrids are thoroughly analyzed in CO oxidation and CO2 hydrogenation reactions. The nanohybrids differ in catalytic particle size and particle distribution. The particles are smaller (1-6 nm) and display a narrower size distribution in the case of Pt-based nanomaterials. The Pt/h-BN(O) nanohybrids exhibit high catalytic activity in CO conversion and carbon dioxide hydrogenation reactions. For both systems, the oxidative state of BN support affects the catalytic activity. The possible catalytic reaction mechanisms are proposed based on DFT calculations. A charge density distribution at the Pt/h-BN interface increases oxygen absorption, thereby accelerating oxygen-associated chemical reactions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000720466800002

Here, an atomically dispersed Ru/Co dual-sites catalyst is reported anchored on N-doped carbon (Ru/Co-N-C) for outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The Ru/Co-N-C catalyst requires the overpotential of only 13 and 23 mV for HER, 232 and 247 mV for OER to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(geo)(-2) in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 1 m KOH, respectively, outperforming benchmark catalysts Pt/C and RuO2. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Co-N4 sites into Ru/Co-N-C efficiently modify the electronic structure of Ru by enlarging Ru-O covalency and increasing Ru electron density, which in turn optimize the bonding strength between oxygen/hydrogen intermediate species with Ru sites, thereby enhancing OER and HER performance. Furthermore, the incorporation of Co-N4 sites induces electron redistribution around Ru-N4, thus enhancing corrosion-resistance of Ru/Co-N-C during acid and alkaline electrolysis. The Ru/Co-N-C has been applied in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer and steady operation is demonstrated at a high current density of 450 mA cm(geo)(-2) for 330 h.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000786440900001	35384087

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been regarded as superior electrocatalysts due to their atomically dispersed metal ions. Currently, MOFs have been widely studied as templates to fabricate electrocatalysts through thermal annealing. Here, we report a novel synthetic approach to fabricate a Ni-S/MIL-53(Fe) electrode by electrodepositing sulfur-engineered amorphous nickel hydroxides on MIL-53(Fe) nanosheets. The obtained binder-free, self-supported Ni-S/MIL-53(Fe) shows high OER activity with overpotentials of 256 and 298 mV to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, it also exhibits excellent electrochemical stability with no obvious degradation at 100 mA cm(-2) for at least 40 h.

To date, the only well-established active oxygen-evolution catalysts stable under operating conditions and at rest in acidic aqueous media contain Ru or Ir, two of the scarcest non-radioactive elements on Earth. We report herein a nickel-manganese antimonate electrocatalyst with a rutile-type crystal structure that requires an initial voltammetric overpotential of 672 +/- 9 mV to catalyze the oxidation of water to O-2(g) at a rate corresponding to 10 mA cm(-2) of current density when operated in contact with 1.0 M sulfuric acid. Under galvanostatic control, the overpotential initially rose from 670 mV but was then stable at 735 +/- 10 mV for 168 h of continuous operation at 10 mA cm(-2). We additionally provide an in-depth evaluation of the stability of the nickel-manganese antimonate electrocatalyst, including elemental characterization of the surface, bulk, and electrolyte before and after electrochemical operation.									102	5	0	0	4	0	107			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000412765600005

Here, for Zn-air batteries (ZABs), we propose an innovative binderless noble-metal-free hierarchical nanostructured bifunctional air cathode in which high-density MnOx nanorods (NRs) are directly grown on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) themselves synthesized on a microfibrous carbon paper (CP) substrate. All carbon/MnOx air cathodes achieved specific capacities very close to the theoretical value of 820 mAh gzn(-1). A very stable voltage gap between the charge and discharge processes along hundred cycles was obtained, demonstrating the stability and good bifunctional electrocatalytic activities of these cathodes toward the oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction in a real ZAB device. As a proof-of-concept for handheld electronic applications, a ZAB assembled with CP/MnOx NRs as the air electrode and a Zn plate anode operated a timer for 14 days successfully, whereas two ZAB-based CNTs/MnOx cathodes connected in series powered a 2 V light-emitting diode (LED) bulb and a 3 V multimeter. The proposed strategy and results may pave the way for the rational design of hierarchical free-standing bifunctional electrocatalysts for ZABs, other metal-air batteries, and fuel cells.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000734449500001	34927435

Herein, a facile one-step approach is developed to synthesize a new type of well-dispersed iridium (Ir) incorporated cobalt-based hydroxide nanosheets (nominated as CoIr) for OER. The Ir species as clusters and single atoms are incorporated into the defect-rich hydroxide nanosheets through the formation of rich Co-Ir species, as revealed by systematic synchrotron radiation based X-ray spectroscopic characterizations combining with high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy measurement. The optimized CoIr with 9.7 wt% Ir content displays highly efficient OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 373 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 m phosphate buffer solution, significantly outperforming the commercial IrO2 catalysts. Further characterizations toward the catalyst after undergoing OER process indicate that unique Co oxyhydroxide and high valence Ir species with low-coordination structure are formed due to the high oxidation potentials, which authentically contributes to superior OER performance. This work not only provides a state-of-the-art OER catalyst in neutral media but also unravels the root of the excellent performance based on efficient structural identifications.									211	11	0	0	10	0	212			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000431615100026	29575370

Herein, a novel hybrid electrocatalyst of Ni-Fe-Ru-based phosphide heterostructures directly grown on nickel foam (Ni2P-Fe2P-Ru2P/NF) is synthesized by a simple two-step strategy. When assessed as a bifunctional catalyst toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the resultant Ni2P-Fe2P-Ru2P/NF electrode shows remarkable electrocatalytic performance and long-time durability in alkaline electrolytes due to the collaborative contributions of abundant heterointerfaces, good conductivity, and 3D porous architecture. As expected, to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the as-prepared Ni2P-Fe2P-Ru2P/NF merely requires low overpotentials of 195 and 78.6 mV for the OER and HER, respectively, comparable to most bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. The Ni2P-Fe2P-Ru2P/NF//Ni2P-Fe2P-Ru2P/NF electrolyzer demonstrates a low voltage of 1.49 V for 10 mA cm(-2) along with excellent stability, exceeding that of Pt-C/NF//IrO2/NF (1.64 V). Furthermore, the H-2 generation driven by commercial solar cells is evaluated to stimulate practical applications in the future.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000730271600001

Among photothermocatalysts, attention is presently focused on composites of noble metal/metal oxide or metal oxide/metal oxide. Instead, in this work, we present a case of single oxide WO3 subjected to hydrogen treatment as photothermocatalyst. With the increase of hydrogen treatment temperature, the color of WO3 changes from yellow to blue to dark blue and a phase transition from WO3 to W0232 to WO2 is accompanied, suggesting an increase of concentration of oxygen vacancy. Photothermocatalytic test against degradation of gaseous acetaldehyde at 60 degrees C under UV light shows that WO3-x sample with low concentration of oxygen vacancy displays the most significant synergetic effect between photocatalysis and thermocatalysis. Its photothermocatalytic activity in terms of CO2 evolution rate is 5.2 times higher than that of photocatalytic activity. However, WO3 -W02.72 and WO2 with high degree of oxygen deficiency show insignificant synergetic effect between photocatalysis and thermocatalysis. The reason for the different synergistic effect over above samples is believed to lie in balance between decreased activation energy of lattice oxygen and recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes induced by oxygen deficiency.

The rational design of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with high catalytic activity is critical to the development of efficient and durable metal air batteries. Herein, we propose a novel strategy to mass synthesize nonprecious transition-metal-based nitrogen/oxygen codoped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on carbon-nanofiber films (MNO-CNT-CNFFs, M = Fe, Co, Ni) via a facile free-surface electrospinning technique followed by in situ growth carbonization. With a combination of the high catalytic activity of Fe-catalyzed CNTs and the efficient mass-transport characteristics of 3D carbon fiber films, the resultant flexible and robust FeNO-CNT-CNFFs exhibit the highest bifunctional oxygen catalytic activities in terms of a positive half-wave potential (0.87 V) for ORR and low overpotential (430 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)) for OER. As proof-of-concept, newly designed hybrid Li-air batteries fabricated with FeNO-CNT-CNFFs as air electrode present high voltage (similar to 3.4 V), low overpotential (0.15 V), and long cycle life (over 120 h) in practical open-air tests, demonstrating the superiority of the freestanding catalysts and their promising potential for the applications in fuel cells and flexible energy storage devices.									86	8	0	0	3	0	89			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000395358600025		
J	Liu, Huan; Gong, Li-Ge; Wang, Chun-Xiao; Wang, Chun-Mei; Yu, Kai; Zhou, Bai-Bin								{Cu2SiW12O40}@HKUST-1 synthesized by a one-step solution method with efficient bifunctional activity for supercapacitors and the oxygen evolution reaction								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				9	22			13161	13169		10.1039/d1ta01503f		MAY 2021		JUN 14 2021	2021	The combination of polyoxometalate (POM) and metal-organic framework (MOF) composite materials (POMOFs) is desirable, due to their applications in efficient supercapacitors and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution, but it is still challenging. Herein, we successfully synthesized {Cu2SiW12O40}@HKUST-1 through a one-step solution method. Synergy between {Cu2SiW12O40} and HKUST-1 can promote mass/charge transfer and the adsorption/desorption of intermediates on {Cu2SiW12O40}@HKUST-1. In a three-electrode system, {Cu2SiW12O40}@HKUST-1 as the electrode material has a specific capacitance of 5096.5 F g(-1) when the current density is 1 A g(-1). After 6000 cycles, the retention rate is 92%, which is much higher than values reported in the literature. A symmetrical electrode assembled with foamed nickel as the current collector has a power density of 510.81 W kg(-1) and an energy density of 15.31 W h kg(-1), in a 1.0 V voltage window. At the same time, the electrode material in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, when the scanning speed is 5 mV s(-1), exhibits an overpotential for the electrocatalytic water oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of 340 mV (without iR compensation). Especially at high current densities, {Cu2SiW12O40}@HKUST-1 shows better performance than commercial RuO2. Further, it has excellent catalytic durability. This work provides a basis for the further application of POMOFs.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000653780400001

The surface effects of Pt-Ir alloy nanocatalysts for oxygen electrode reaction in acidic solution were intensively investigated. Pt-Ir alloy nanocatalysts showed enhanced catalytic activities for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which were 1.6 to 2.0 times those of the commercial Ir/C catalyst and the Pt/C-Ir/C mixture at an overpotential of 0.25 V. The catalytic activity for the OER exhibited a positive correlation with the proportion of surface IrOx species, but was restricted by the surface alloying effect. Besides the change of the intermediate adsorption state, the dissociation of water was also confirmed to be effective as the rate-determining step of the Pt-Ir alloy nanocatalysts. The catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) decreased with the increase of surface IrOx species. Pt-Ir nano-short-chains (NSCs) exhibited 1.3 times the catalytic activity as that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst at 0.80 V and 0.85 V, owing to the higher proportion of the (110) facets with irregular step sites exposed after the annealing treatment at 350 degrees C. The unique structure could prevent the mass transfer process from being obstructed by adsorbed bisulfate anions and oxidized species on the surfaces. Pt-Ir NSCs exhibited a catalytic efficiency of 46.7% and were considered to be a promising URFC catalyst.									52	6	0	0	0	1	55			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000394781100020	28009923

On the other hand, alpha-type hydroxides, with cations in controllable mixed octahedral/tetrahedral coordination, have been rarely investigated. Here, we report a general approach to prepare novel Co(II)(4)Fe(III)(1) hydroxide nanocones (NCs) with both features of alpha-type mixed octahedral(O-h)/tetrahedral(T-d) coordination and LDH-analogous mixed di-/trivalences, i.e., mix-O-h/T-d LDH. Specifically, Co(II)(4)Fe(III)(1) hydroxide NCs in such a mix-O-h/T-d LDH structure were synthesized and tested as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and were found to be capable of delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of similar to 263 mV, with a remarkable turnover frequency (TOF) that is 1 order of magnitude higher than that of Co(II)(4)Fe(III)(1) LDH nanoplatelets with octahedral coordination only. It was also found that the NCs exhibited a very high electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) due to their hollow conical morphology and large interlayer spacing. More importantly, spectroscopic characterizations of the samples after the electrochemical reaction, associated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, proved that mix-O-h/T-d LDH NCs are more likely to form oxyhydroxides with cobalt and iron toward higher oxidation states. As a result, the ability to adsorb oxygen free radicals may be significantly enhanced and the energy barrier of OER is substantially lowered.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000537657500012

Herein, "diamond necklace"-like N-coordinated cobalt phosphate nanocrystals coupled with carbon nanotubes (CoPiC-DP/CNTs) are synthesized through the facile hydrothermal-carbonization approach and employed as the bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER. The CNTs act like the "chain" as support, the "diamond"-like N-coordinated cobalt phosphate nanocrystals serve as catalytic active sites, and the N-doped carbon derived from the phosphonate ligand-like "linker" can not only protect the "diamond" from leaching but also promote the mass transfer. Such advanced structure and composition features endow CoPiC-DP/CNTs with impressive ORR and OER electrochemical activities. To probe the active contribution of CoPiC-DP/ CNTs toward ORR, a series of cobalt phosphate-carbon hybrids are prepared by adjusting the types of phosphonate ligands of the cobalt phosphonate precursor to rationally control their active components. The comprehensive investigation from structural characterizations and electrochemical measurements of these cobalt phosphate-carbon hybrids verifies that both N-coordinated cobalt sites and the suitable carbon substrate are essential for the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the liquid- and solid-state zinc-air batteries with these fabricated CoPiC-DP/CNTs employed as the air cathode exhibit decreased charge-discharge potential gaps, high power density, and considerable cycling durability, which are beneficial for the potential development of flexible/portable electronic devices.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2168-0485			WOS:000617925200041

This has provoked a range of discussions on the role of water and its impact on batteries. In this work, a distinct battery chemistry that prevails in water-contaminated aprotic lithium-oxygen batteries is revealed. Both lithium ions and protons are found to be involved in the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, and lithium hydroperoxide and lithium hydroxide are identified as predominant discharge products. The crystallographic and spectroscopic characteristics of lithium hydroperoxide monohydrate are scrutinized both experimentally and theoretically. Intriguingly, the reaction of lithium hydroperoxide with triiodide exhibits a faster kinetics, which enables a considerably lower overpotential during the charging process. The battery chemistry unveiled in this mechanistic study could provide important insights into the understanding of nominally aprotic lithium-oxygen batteries and help to tackle the critical issues confronted.									98	6	0	0	7	1	101			2041-1723			WOS:000393340300001	28165008

However, challenges remain in the development of ZnAB electrode materials due to the lack of efficient air-electrode catalysts for solving the problems regarding slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) and poor durability. Here, we report the formation of Co3O4 nanosheets with rich oxygen-vacancy defects grown on zeolite-templated carbon (ZTC) for electrocatalytic application in a ZnAB. Hydrophobic ZTC serves as a substrate for the growth of the Co3O4 nanosheets. Oxygen vacancies are generated by the borohydride reduction of Co2+, followed by oxidation with oxygen in atmospheric air. The resultant oxygen-vacancy defective Co3O4 nanosheets on ZTC (Co3O4 NS/ZTC) exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity towards the ORR/OER and high durability, compared with commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. The high bifunctional electrocatalytic activity is attributed to the sheet-like structure and oxygen-vacancy defects of Co3O4 and the high surface area and uniform microporosity of ZTC. The ZnAB with the bifunctional electrocatalyst exhibits excellent discharge performance and long-term charge/discharge cycling stability.									46	4	0	0	3	0	47			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000467249200057

Herein, one-dimensional porous LaFe1-xNixO3 (LFNO) perovskite oxide nanofibers (LFNO NFs) are fabricated with a feasible electrospinning route and its further post-calcination treatment. By tailoring the atomic percent of Fe and Ni in the perovskite oxide, we determined that LaFe0.25Ni0.75O3 (LFNO-III) NFs afford the best OER activity among all the prepared perovskite oxides. Especially remarkable is that the further selenide-doped LaFe0.25Ni0.75O3 (LFNOSe-III) NFs exhibit outstanding OER activity with a low overpotential of 287 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 87 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution, markedly exceeding that of the parent perovskite oxide and the commercial RuO2. It also delivers decent durability with no significant degradation after 22 h of stability test. In the meanwhile, density functional theory calculations are also conducted to justify the optimized adsorption features of *OH, *O, and *OOH intermediates and unveil that the electrocatalytic active sites are the Ni atoms adjacent to Fe in the Ni- and Se codoped perovskite. This work provides an effective method for the development of highly efficient perovskite oxide catalysts.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000572965700028	32841005

The results reveal that the applied flow regime during the cathodic polarisation process has a direct effect on the corrosion behaviour of steel. The cathodic polarisation of steel under static conditions increases the oxygen reduction rate and shifts the corrosion potential towards nobler potentials. Under dynamic conditions, depending on the regime of the applied fluid flow during cathodic and anodic polarisation, the oxygen reduction rate can increase, causing the corrosion potential of the cathodically polarised steel to shift towards more positive direction. On the contrary, the oxygen reduction rate can decrease and the corrosion potential of the cathodically polarised steel shifts towards more negative potentials.									6	1	0	0	1	0	6			0334-6005	2191-0316		WOS:000360858400003

The composition of the alloys was varied by changing the concentration of dissolved nickel ([Co] = 0.04M) in the preparation bath. It was observed that the structure of the coatings is closely related to the applied cathodic current density (0.005 < i(c) < 0.5 A cm-2) during the alloy electrodeposition; the effect of the coating composition on its structure is small. Both the potentiodynamic behavior at low potential and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have been investigated on such coatings in 40wt% KOH at 70-degrees-C. For the OER measurements, the anodes were preanodized for 0.5 h at 2 A cm-2 before depolarization. Both the electrocatalytic behavior at low potential and the characteristics associated with the OER are linked to the structure of the coating and its composition.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0360-3199			WOS:A1993LE48700001

To date, the best performing electrocatalysts for OER in acidic solutions, IrO2 and RuO2, are expensive and scarce. Herein, we develop a systematic theoretical framework to investigate the OER activity performance of diverse and complex acid-stable oxides. By determining the most stable oxide surfaces, accounting for realistic surface coverages under OER conditions, and using theoretical OER overpotential as an activity descriptor, we identified Co(SbO3)(2), CoSbO4, Ni(SbO3)(2), Fe(SbO3)(2), FeSbO4, FeAg(MoO4)(2), MoWO6, and Ti(WO4)(2) as promising materials, some of which have already been experimentally found to have good OER performance, and some are new for experimental validation, thus expanding the chemical space for efficient OER materials. On the basis of the activity analysis, we further discuss strategies to improve the OER catalytic activity and the remaining challenges.									39	0	0	0	2	0	39			2380-8195			WOS:000599605500014

JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				150	4					041729	10.1063/1.5063771				JAN 28 2019	2019	Nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) is known to increase the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of hematite (Fe2O3) photoanodes. In recent experimental studies, it has been reported that the increased OER activity is related to the activation of the hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) surface by NiOOH rather than the activity of NiOOH itself. In this study, we investigate the reason behind the higher activity and the low overpotentials for NiOOH-Fe2O3 photoanodes using first principles calculations. To study the activity of possible catalytic sites, different geometries with NiOOH as a cluster and as a strip geometry on hematite (110) surfaces are studied. Density functional theory + U calculations are carried out to determine the OER activity at different sites of these structures. The geometry with a continuous strip of NiOOH on hematite is stable and is able to explain the activity. We found that the Ni atoms at the edge sites of the NiOOH cocatalyst are catalytically more active than Ni atoms on the basal plane of the cocatalyst; the calculated overpotentials are as low as 0.39 V.

Chelate confinement not only prevents the aggregation of MoP/Mo2C quantum dots, but also synchronously produces a carbon sheet network doped with N and P without the requirement for post-atom doping. The prepared MoP-Mo2C/NPC exhibited a large specific surface area, a high electron conductivity, and abundant active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result, MoP-Mo2C/NPC with a low calculated Gibbs free energy for H adsorption exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic activity and an ultrahigh stability for both the HER and OER processes in an alkaline medium. In addition, the assembled MoP-Mo2C/NPC || MoP-Mo2C/NPC alkaline electrolyzer delivered a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of only 1.55 V, and maintained > 95% of the initial current density after 168 h (1 week) of activity, which is superior to that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C || RuO2/C system in the overall water splitting process.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000771552800001

Here, we report a simple and scalable low-temperature sulfuration method to achieve simultaneous modulation of disorder and defects in pyrite-type RuS2 nanoparticles to dramatically enhance the HER and OER catalytic activity. The disordered structure can increase the electrochemically active surface area, while defect engineering can effectively regulate the electronic structure and thus improve the intrinsic activity, as revealed by combined experimental and theoretical density functional theory (DFT) investigations. Through controllable disorder and defect engineering, the optimized RuS2-500 catalyst (with a sulfuration temperature of 500 degrees C) supported on a glassy carbon electrode exhibits ultra-efficient bifunctional electrocatalytic activity with eta(-10) = 78 mV for the HER and eta(10) = 282 mV for the OER, superior to various Ru-based and pyrite-type catalysts. Remarkably, when used as both the anode and the cathode in an alkaline water electrolyzer, RuS2-500 delivers 10 mA cm(-2) at an ultralow cell voltage of 1.527 V with long-term stability, outperforming the benchmark Pt/C//RuO2 couple and most state-of-the-art overall-water-splitting electrocatalysts ever reported. This work thus provides a new and facile way for improving the catalytic activity through a synergistic modulation strategy.									31	1	0	0	1	0	31			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472566400037

Prussian blue analogues (MM'-PBAs, A(x)M(y) [M'(CN)(6)], -nH(2)O: A = alkali metal; M/M' = transition metals), as a kind of potential electrocatalyst candidate for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), are rarely studied. Herein, by a facile coprecipitation method, CoFe-PBAs were in-situ grown on the surface of highly conductive vanadium nitride (VN) particles. The hybrid CoFe-PBAs/VN achieves the amelioration of the poor conductivity of bare CoFe-PBAs and the increase in the density of Co2+ active sites due to electron interaction. Compared with bare CoFe-PBAs (over-potential of 398 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 78.35 mV dec(-1)), the CoFe-PBAsNN manifests a remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER (lower overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a smaller Tafel slope of 39.72 mV dec(-1)), which is superior among PBAs and PBAs-derived materials reported as electrocatalysts for OER. Besides, this hybrid material behaves an excellent long-term durability. High conductivity of VN and electron interaction between VN and CoFe-PBAs contribute to the promoted catalytic performance. This study provides a novel strategy using VN substrates to support PBAs-based catalysts so as to obtain highly active and stable electrocatalysts towards practical applications.

The material belongs to a monoclinic crystal system and has a layered structure. The nitrogen content is determined by a thermogravimetric method. The flat band of the material is determined with a Mott-Schottky plot and is located at +0.3 V vs. RHE. Cyclic voltammograms and XPS spectra prove that the material catalyzes a self-transformation, forming NiOOH at the surface, which acts as the active oxygen evolution site. Under simulated sunlight, the material exhibits stable hydrogen (62.4 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) and oxygen (29.6 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) evolution rates from water without any sacrificial reagent and without any additional co-catalyst. The open-circuit photovoltage measurement indicates that the low concentration of photogenerated charge carriers limits the performance of the material as a photoelectrode. Furthermore, two different sacrificial reagents are applied to show that the hydrogen evolution reaction is the rate-determining step in water splitting under visible light. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, efficient and durable systems are not yet available, mainly owing to limited chemical stability and durability of bifunctional air electrodes, that undergo poorly understood changes in chemical state and space distribution of the electrocatalytic materials. Manganese oxides (MnOx) are popular non-precious oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts due to their low cost and relatively high activity. Unfortunately, the stability of MnOx under ORR conditions and its performance in the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) are not completely satisfactory. Previous work in our group has shown that mixed Mn-Ni oxides exhibit a notably improved ORR activity and durability, strongly enhanced by dispersing the oxides in a polypyrrole (PPy) matrix. Moreover, PPy exhibits high stability as well as catalytic activity in the OER. This study thus focuses on the ORR/OER behaviour of Mn-Ni/PPy nanocomposite and is aimed at following the changes in chemical state distribution of dopant Ni at the submicroscale. These changes result from the cathodic and anodic operation of this material under conditions relevant to the oxygen electrode of Zn-air batteries. Our study is based on quasi-in situ identical-location soft-X ray absorption microspectroscopy at the Ni L-edge, complemented by spectroscopy performed through ptychography for the case of ORR. Electrochemical operation results in a space-and potential-dependent rearrangement of the distribution of elemental and oxidized Nickel and in a change of their ratios. Operation under ORR conditions is accompanied by an increase of the oxidized Nickel fraction owing to the presence of an oxidizer in the electrolyte. As expected, oxidizing OER conditions cause an increase of the oxidized Nickel fraction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2468-6069			WOS:000439097500015

For the metal deposition, two methodologies were tested: alternate and simultaneous Sn and Sb electrodepositions. Metals were deposited onto titanium foil or titanium foil covered with platinum or copper. For both preparation methods, the SnO2 crystalline phase was identified, with Sb2O3 or Sh(2)O(4) only present when alternate Sn and Sb electrodepositions were performed. The roughness factor depends on the electrodeposition method and on the substrate morphology. The introduction of a Pt or Cu metallic interlayer increases the current intensity for equal applied potential due to the increases in the substrates' conductivity and real surface area. The presence of composite Sn and Sb oxides leads to lower current intensity because the existence of distinct phases introduces resistance in the grain boundaries. Concerning the apparent activation energy for the oxygen evolution reaction, values of 73, 74 and 63 kJ mol(-1) were found for Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb, Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb and Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb2O3, respectively, pointing to HO- adsorption as the rate determining step at these electrodes' surfaces. For Ti/SnO2-Sb, Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4 and Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb2O4, much higher apparent activation energies were obtained. Of the tested materials, the most appropriate for oxygen evolution is Ti/Cu/SnO2-Sb.

Although many electrocatalysts based on transition metal dichalcogenides have been developed, rational design and controllable synthesis of fine nanostructures with subtle morphologies and sequential chemical compositions related to these materials remains a challenge. This study reports a series of peapod-like composites with component-controllable Co(SxSe1-x)(2) nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon fibers, which are obtained by using Co(CO3)(0.5)(OH)center dot 0.11H(2)O nanowires as a precursor followed by coating carbon fiber and an adjustable sulfuration/selenylation process. Due to its increased exposure of active sites and improved charge and mass transport capability derived from the unique structure and morphology, the Co(SxSe1-x)(2) samples display favorable catalytic activities. It is found that Co(S0.71Se0.29)(2) exhibits the best hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance and Co(S0.22Se0.78)(2) shows the highest activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). When using Co(S0.71Se0.29)(2) as a cathode and Co(S0.22Se0.78)(2) as an anode, it demonstrates a durable activity for overall water splitting to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.63 V, thus offering an attractive cost-effective earth abundant material system toward water splitting.									189	14	0	0	7	0	192			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000404019400014

Here, we report a class of stable PtFe-Fe2C Janus-like nanoparticle (NP) interface catalysts with an unrevealed barrier-free interface electron-transfer property that greatly boosts ORR catalytic activity and stability. The PtFe-Fe2C Janus-like NPs showed much higher catalytic activity for ORR than either PtFe or Fe2C NPs in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Density functional theory simulations revealed that a barrier-free interface electron transfer on the interface of PtFe-Fe2C Janus-like NPs is the main factor in enhancing ORR activity. This interface electron-transfer property makes them the most active for ORR among all reported PtFe-based nanocatalysts. We further demonstrate that this barrier-free interface electron-transfer property can be readily generalized to other systems, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction and H2O2 reduction electrocatalysis, to achieve better electrocatalytic enhancement.									61	2	0	0	2	0	61			2451-9294			WOS:000432725000020

The prepared samples were investigated for photocatalytic and electrochemical behavior using various characterization techniques. The crystal structure, stretching frequencies, and surface morphology were studied using X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The electrochemical performances of the samples were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Kinetics of hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions in a basic electrolyte were also investigated. From the above characterization techniques, it has been revealed that NaTaO3 (or, NT), c-NaTaO3 (or, cNT), and s-NaTaO3 (or, sNT) have a cubic crystal structure in the perovskite phase and possess direct band gaps of energies 3.9 eV, 3.8 eV, and 3.7 eV, respectively. The average crystallite size of NT, cNT, and sNT is calculated as 15 nm, 12 nm, and 20 nm, respectively. sNT has higher capacitive properties than NT and cNT, but it cannot be considered a typical supercapacitor electrode material. However, all the samples have shown optimal performance in hydrogen and oxygen evolution processes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000698102000001

However, porphyrin has the disadvantages of decomposition, self-polymerization and deactivation in catalysis, and unrecyclability in homogeneous catalysis, which limit its wide application in catalysis. With the development of single-atom catalysis, it is found that porphyrin-like single-atom catalysts (SACs) mimic the porphyrin molecules and biological enzymes in many catalytic systems due to their high similarity to porphyrin. In contrast, porphyrin-like single-atom heterogeneous catalysts possess good recyclability compared with small-molecule porphyrin homogeneous catalysts. Therefore, as an important family member of SACs, porphyrin-like SACs are widely studied in various reactions. Herein, the synthesis methods for porphyrin-like SACs and their applications in many important reactions, including electrochemical reactions and organic synthesis reactions, are summarized. Finally, the challenges and prospects of porphyrin-like SACs in the further applications are provided.									42	3	0	0	2	0	42				2688-4062		WOS:000704605100005

The preparation method involved a charging step in which electrons were charged into WO3 under negative bias, and a subsequent reducing step in which the stored electrons were used to reductively deposit Au on the surface of WO3. The electron-charged WO3 (c-WO3) exhibited tunable reducibility that could be easily controlled by varying the charging parameters, and this property makes this method a universal strategy to prepare metal/WO3 composites. The obtained Au/WO3 nanocomposite showed greatly improved photoactivity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) when compared with WO3. After Au decoration, the OER photocurrent was improved by a percentage of over 80% at low potentials (< 0.6 V vs. SCE), and by a percentage of over 30% at high potentials (> 1.0 V vs. SCE). Oxygen evolution measurements were performed to quantitatively determine the Faraday efficiency for OER, which reflected the amount of photocurrent consumed by water splitting. The Faraday efficiency for OER was improved from 74% at the WO3 photoanode to 94% at the Au-8/WO3 composite photoanode, and this is the first direct evidence that the Au decoration significantly restrained the anodic side reactions and enhanced the photoelectrochemical (PEC) OER efficiency. The high photoactivity of the composite photoanode toward OER was ascribed to the plasmon resonance energy transfer (PRET) enhancement and the catalytic enhancement of Au nanoparticles (NPs).									66	3	0	0	2	0	66			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000376652300018

Therefore, gasification reactions of carbonaceous materials with CO2 may take place in addition to reactions with O-2. A thermodynamic analysis of both reactions was carried out through electronic structure calculations in order to evaluate the previous hypothesis. In most cases, the evaluated CO2 adsorption reactions are thermodynamically favorable, while CO evolution reactions from oxidized carbonaceous material are endothermic although exergonic at high temperatures. Our results indicate that simultaneous occurrence of combustion and gasification reactions is possible, at least from a thermodynamic point of view.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000438752900002

Nature's photosynthetic machinery deploy manganese-based complex in the photosystem II to oxidize water. Inspired by nature, herein, we synthesized a high performing manganese-based OER catalyst using an electrochemically active and iron-rich bacterium, Geobacter sulfurreducens. The as-synthesized biohybrid catalyst (amorphous Geobacter-Mn2O3) produced a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 290 +/- 9 mV versus a reversible hydrogen electrode with a low Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1). The catalyst exhibited remarkable stability, evidenced through a long-term chronopotentiometry experiment. Multiple evidence showed that G. sulfurreducens contributed OER active elements (iron and phosphorus) to the biohybrid catalyst, and the as-synthesized Geobacter-Mn2O3 is amorphous. The amorphous structure of the biohybrid catalyst provided a large electrochemically active surface area and excess catalytic sites for the OER catalysis. In addition, Mn3+ present in the biohybrid catalyst is believed to be the precursor for oxygen evolution. The OER activity of the biohybrid catalyst outperformed commercial-Mn2O3, commercial-IrO2 and most of the benchmark precious OER catalysts, thus supporting its suitability for large-scale applications. The proposed green approach to synthesize a biohybrid catalyst paves a new avenue to develop robust and cost-effective electrocatalysts for energy-related applications.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000563999100028

In this work, we synthesized a self-supporting heterogeneous NiSe@Co0.85Se/NF electrocatalyst using a facile in situ selenization of transition metal precursors that coated on the nickel foam (NF) in polyol solution. The NF was used as both conductive substrate and nickel source, ensuring superior electronic conductivity for catalyzing. The NiSe@Co0.85Se/NF exhibited remarkable bifunctional electrocatalytic activities with HER overpotential of 168 mV and OER overpotential of 258 mV to achieve 10 mA.cm(-2). The water splitting system using NiSe@Co0.85Se/NF as both anode and cathode electrodes achieved a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2)at 1.61 V with nearly 100% faradaic efficiency and impressively long-term stability. The efficient bifunctional catalytic performance of NiSe@Co0.85Se/NF should be attributed to the electronic modulation and synergistic effect between NiSe and Co0.85Se, the intrinsic metallic conductivity and the enlarged active sites exposure. This work provides a facile method for developing heterogeneous bifunctional catalysts for advanced electrochemical energy conversion technologies.									55	12	0	0	0	0	59			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000559442700001

Herein, a phase-pure pentlandite Ni4.3Co4.7S8 bifunctional electrocatalyst was synthesized via a hydrothermal process using a commercial nickel foam as the nickel source. The active metallic nickel source and the chelating agent ethylenediamine play important roles in the formation of phase-pure pentlandite Ni4.3Co4.7S8 binary sulfide. Physicochemical characterizations, electrochemical measurements and density functional theory (DFT) computations illustrate that the material has an exposed high-indexed (022) surface with a biomimetic hydrogenase-like structure, and that the pentlandite phase has metallic characteristics, with next-nearest neighbor metal-metal bonds, as well as there being a high overlap of density of state (DOS) at the Fermi-level due to the synergistic effect between Ni and Co ions. In addition, there is an elevation of the d-state center (from -2.84 to -1.52 eV) with high occupation of the anti-bonding e(g) (d(x2-y2) and d(z2)) d-orbitals. These properties endow the Ni4.3Co4.7S8 bifunctional electrocatalyst with higher catalytic activity for OER than RuO2, with comparative activity for HER to commercial Pt/C and with a low over-potential for all water splitting in an alkaline electrolyte. The studies here provide a novel strategy to synthesise phase-pure pentlandite nickel cobalt binary sulfides and boost their applications in electrochemical water splitting.									62	4	0	0	3	0	62			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000434692000020	29796565

Herein, Ag3PO4/WO3 S-scheme heterojunction was synthesized via a simple deposition-precipitation pro-cess, and its photocatalytic activity was evaluated by monitoring water splitting and pollutant degrada-tion under visible light. As a result, Ag3PO4/WO3 with optimized ratio photocatalyst showed enhanced photocatalytic activity in oxygen production (306.6 mu mol.L-1.h(-1)) relative to pure Ag3PO4 (204.4 lmol.L-1.h(-1)). Additionally, it also exhibits rapid toxicity elimination efficiency over hexavalent chromium ions (Cr6+) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) with degrading rate of 72% and 83% within 30 min, respectively. According to a series characterization, a possible S-scheme photocatalytic mechanism of Ag3PO4/WO3 was demonstrated in detail, which endowed the heterojunction with strong redox abilities to provide powerful diving force towards the photocatalytic reaction. This work presents an innovative perspective to construct Ag3PO4-based S-scheme heterojunctions for boosting photocatalytic performance for various applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, the issues of metal dendrite formation and air electrode failure have been impeding the development and application of ZABs. Herein, we designed a novel dendrite-resistant ZAB system by adopting multiphase electrolytes to conduct the zinc deposition and the oxygen evolution reaction. The oxygen reduction reaction electrode is kept out of the zinc deposition region to extend the lifespan. The ZABs show an energy density of 1,050.9 Wh kg(-1) based on the mass of zinc consumption, with an average Coulombic efficiency of similar to 97.4% in 2,000 h discharge and charge cycling. More impressively, even if a short circuit occurs while charging, the battery can maintain the cycle performance without irreversible failure, which is conducive to the reliability of battery modules and its application in other energy storage/conversion devices.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11				2589-0042		WOS:000548238500001	32480127

Both types of harsh reactions are chemically similar: The main concern is catalyst stability, and in both cases the best catalyst contains RuO2 as the catalytically active component so that a critical comparison may provide new insights into the underlying physicochemical processes. It is the primary scope of this review addresses atomic scale information on the RuO2-catalyzed HCl oxidation reaction either in electrochemical or in gas phase environment. In particular, the involved reaction mechanisms and the reason for the extraordinary stability of RuO2 under such harsh reaction conditions will be discussed, emphasizing similarities and differences in the Deacon process and the CER and what can be learnt from this comparison. The distinct properties of RuO2, which are responsible for its extraordinary catalytic performance in both the CER and the Deacon process, are highlighted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Similar to homogeneous catalytic ligands, the support in SACs plays a vital role in the catalytic properties. Herein, we present a series of transition-metal atoms (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir and Pt) anchored on a vanadium diselenide (VSe2) monolayer as electrocatalysts through density functional theory calculations. Pd@VSe2 stands out among the considered SACs with a low overpotential of 0.38 V, exhibiting the excellent performance of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Meanwhile, a liner trend between the adsorption Gibbs free energy of the OH (Delta G(OH)*) and the predicted eta(ORR) is revealed, which may serve as a simple descriptor for the inherent ORR catalytic activity of SACs. Particularly, Pt@VSe2 shows extraordinarily low theoretical overpotential of -0.04/0.47 V for hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction, which transcends the state-of-the-art Pt and IrO2 and thereby can be exploited as highly-efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. This work broadens the perception of designing multifunctional electrocatalysts based on two-dimensional VSe2 material and offers a new paradigm for investigating advanced SACs.

Herein, we report the electrochemical formation of a thin film of nickel-based Prussian blue analogue hexacyanoferrate (Ni-HCF) through the anodization of a nickel substrate in ferricyanide electrolyte. As compared to the traditionally used Nafion-binder-based bulk film, the anodically obtained binder-free Ni-HCF film demonstrates superior performance in the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is highly competitive with that shown by a Pt-plate electrode. The HER onset and the benchmark cathodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) were achieved at small overpotentials of 15 mV and 0.2 V (not iR-corrected), respectively, in 1 M KOH electrolyte, together with the long-term electrochemical durability of the film. Further, a metal-HCF-electrode-based full water-splitting device consisting of the binder-free Ni-HCF film on a Ni plate and a one-dimensional Co-HCF film on carbon paper as the electrodes for the HER and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, was designed and was found to demonstrate very promising performance for overall water splitting.									48	1	0	0	4	0	48			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000402691600039	28485974

In this letter, a high entropy (Cr0.2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2)(3)O-4 (S-HEO) with Fd3m spinel structure, is prepared by solid-state reaction. Importantly, without the presence of entropy stabilization behavior, single spinel-structure of S-HEO can be retained through the re-heat treatment process. Benefiting from abundant electroactive species and various chemical valance, excellent Li+ storage capability and favorable performance toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are achieved with S-HEO. As anode material for Li ion batteries, S-HEO presents a high specific capacity of 560 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and superior capacity retention of 100% after 5000 cycles. In-situ EIS, ex-situ TEM and XRD analysis were conducted to probe insight into the diffusion kinetic and structural evolution of S-HEO upon cycling. Efficient water oxidation with an overpotential of 332 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) are achieved with S-HEO. With comparison to spinel-type moderate entropy oxides (S-MEOs), the synergic effect between five species highlight the merits of high-entropy feature, manifesting a better OER kinetic and higher stability in KOH solution. This research demonstrates the significant importance of high-entropy concept to boost the performance of high entropy materials for electrochemical application.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773003000003

While water adsorbs molecularly on the anatase (101) surface, the reaction with O-2 results in water dissociation and formation of terminal OH groups. We show that these terminal OHs are the final and stable reaction product on reduced anatase. We identify OOH as a metastable intermediate in the reaction. The water dissociation reaction runs as long as the surface can transfer enough electrons to the adsorbed species; the energy balance and activation barriers for the individual reaction steps are discussed, depending on the number of electrons available. Our results indicate that the presence of donor dopants can significantly reduce activation barriers for oxygen reduction on anatase.									53	0	0	0	6	0	53			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000381062600039	27374609

In this work, we have systematically investigated a series of potentially efficient and stable single late transition metal atom doped phthalocyanines (TM@Pcs, TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir and Pt) as single-atom catalysts (SACs) for applications toward the OER and ORR through a computational screening approach. Our calculations indicate that TM atoms can tightly bind with Pc monolayers with high diffusion energy barriers to prevent the isolated atoms from clustering. The interaction strength between intermediates and TM@Pc governs the catalytic activities for the OER and ORR. Among all the considered TM@Pc catalysts, Ir@Pc and Rh@Pc were found to be efficient OER electrocatalysts with overpotentials eta(OER) of 0.41 and 0.44 V, respectively, and for the ORR, Rh@Pc exhibits the lowest overpotential eta(ORR) of 0.44 V followed by Ir@Pc (0.55 V), suggesting that Rh@Pc is an efficient bifunctional catalyst for both the OER and ORR. Moreover, it is worth noting that the Rh@Pc catalyst can remain stable against dissolution under the pH = 0 condition. Ab initio molecular dynamic calculations suggest that Rh@Pc could remain stable at 300 K. Our findings highlight a novel family of two-dimensional (2D) materials as efficient and stable SACs and offer a new strategy for catalyst design.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2516-0230			WOS:000517128400011	36133246

The electrochemical performances are evaluated by measuring the current density-voltage characteristics and impedance spectra of the SOCs. The activity of hydrogen and air electrodes is investigated by recording overpotential versus current density in symmetrical electrode cells, respectively in hydrogen and air, using a three-electrode method. Conventional hydrogen electrode, Ni-YSZ, and oxygen electrode, LSCF (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-(delta))-GDC, are tested as comparison. The results show that, as an oxygen electrode, Ag-GDC is more active than LSCF-GDC in catalyzing both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an SOFC and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an SOEC. As a hydrogen electrode, Ag-GDC is more active than Ni-YSZ in catalyzing hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in an SOFC and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an SOEC, especially in high steam concentration.

Studies have shown that heteroatom doping and structural optimization are efficient strategies. Herein, a single-atom-like B-N-3 configuration in carbon is designed for efficient oxygen reduction reaction catalysis inspired by the extensively studied transition metal M-N-x sites, which is supported on the ordered macroporous carbon prepared by utilizing a hydrogen-bonded organic framework as carbon and nitrogen sources and SiO2 spheres as a template. The co-doping of B/N and ordered macroporous structures promote the metal-free material high oxygen reduction catalytic performance in alkaline media. DFT calculations reveal that the B-N-3 structure played a key role in enhancing the oxygen reduction activity by providing rich favorable *OOH and *OH adsorption sites on the B center. The promoted formation of *OH/*OOH intermediates accelerated the electrocatalyst reaction.

It is discovered that the incorporation of the dual Fe and Mn cations can simultaneously modulate the morphology and optimize the electron density of the obtained catalysts. As a result, the full sulfidation product of FM-NS NSAs display a much-enhanced activity for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of 188 mV. The NiFeMn-LTH/FM-NS HNSAs obtained from partial sulfidation demonstrate an enhanced HER activity with a lower overpotential of 110 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The FM-NS NSA anode and the NiFeMn-LTH/FM-NS HNSA cathode were coupled in an alkaline medium for overall water splitting and exhibited a much lower cell voltage of 1.48 V at 10 mA cm(-2), superior to most of the reported noble-metal-free electrocatalysts.

The degradation rate of oxalic acid was followed as a function of the potential of the Ti/TiO2 electrode, the oxygen concentration and the light intensity. The presence of oxalic acid caused an increase in the measured photocurrent by one order of magnitude which is due to its reaction with photogenerated holes. The degradation rate increased with increasing potential up to 0.5 V vs SCE, then the increase was more gradual. Electrochemically assisted photocatalytic degradation of oxalic acid also proceeded in the absence of oxygen. The photogenerated electrons caused hydrogen evolution (low oxygen concentration) or predominantely oxygen reduction (high oxygen concentration) on the Pt counter electrode.									29	3	0	0	3	0	32			0021-891X			WOS:000177837200002

Herein, we successfully prepare porous Fe-Mo oxide hybrid nanorods through a hydrothermal method followed by annealing at high temperature. They exhibit excellent catalytic activity for OER and HER in alkaline media, and produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 200 and 66 mV. Besides, they work as bifunctional electrode materials for overall water splitting, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.52 V, and maintaining a current density of 60 mA cm(-2) for 60 h. The unique morphology with self-supported structure can expose more active sites and facilitate charge transfer, and is not easy to peel off, thus it improves the catalytic activity and stability. This work therefore provides a valuable route for designing and fabricating inexpensive and high-performance catalytic materials for overall water splitting.									23	1	0	0	3	0	23			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000524947900019	32191232

In bacteria, the procedure is both sequence- and stereo-specific. We reconstituted the PT reaction using purified DndCDE from Salmonella enterica and IscS from Escherichia coli. We determined that the in vitro process of PT was oxygen sensitive. Only one strand on a double-stranded (ds) DNA substrate was modified in the reaction. The modification was dominant between G and A in the GAAC/GTTC conserved sequence. The modification between G and T required the presence of PT between G and A on the opposite strand. Cysteine, S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and the formation of an iron-sulfur cluster in DndCDE (DndCDE-FeS) were essential for the process. Results from SAM cleavage reactions support the supposition that PT is a radical SAM reaction. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) promoted the reaction but was not essential. The data and conclusions presented suggest that the PT reaction in bacteria involves three steps. The first step is the binding of DndCDE-FeS to DNA and searching for the modification sequence, possibly with the help of ATP. Cysteine locks DndCDE-FeS to the modification site with an appropriate protein conformation. SAM triggers the radical SAM reaction to complete the oxygen-sulfur swapping.									4	0	1	0	3	0	5			0950-382X	1365-2958		WOS:000502307700001	31749226

Herein, a noble-metal-free sandwich-structured catalyst, prepared with facile hydrothermal method and phosphorization process, in which the amorphous MoSx serves as an intermediate layer between the Fe-doped Ni2P and Ni foam substrate (Fe-Ni2P/MoSx/NF) is reported. The obtained free-standing catalyst performs an enhanced electrochemical activity compared with Fe-Ni2P/NF and MoSx/NF. The Fe-Ni2P/MoSx/NF catalyst only requires overpotentials of 246 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and 277 mV to reach 50 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction process with a low Tafel slope of 59.7 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solution. Meanwhile, an overpotential of 112 mV is demanded to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction. When the Fe-Ni2P/MoSx/NF is used as two electrodes for overall water splitting, it requires 1.61 V to attain 10 mA cm(-2) with prominent durability. This approach provides a versatile strategy to construct excellent bifunctional catalysts for effective water electrolysis.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2196-7350			WOS:000528856800001

In last decade, MXenes, a family of emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials with unique physiochemical properties, enticed scientists because of their use in different applications. However, insufficient electron transport, lower intrinsic chemical activity and limited active site densities are the factors inhibiting their use in electrocatalytic cells for hydrogen production. Here, we have presented material design to address this issue and introduced carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on V2CTx MXene sheets for conductive network channels that enhance the ion diffusion for enhanced electrochemical activity. The SEM reveals the uniform dispersion of the MWCNTs over the MXene surface that resulted in the formation of conductive network channels and enhances reaction kinetics. The as-synthesized electrocatalyst was subjected to linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The hybrid catalyst M2 exhibited an enhanced HER activity with a lower over-potential of 27 mV which is comparable to commercially available Pt-based catalysts (32 mV). Similarly, an enhanced OER activity was observed with a lower over-potential of 469 mV as compared to pristine V2CTx MXene. The electrocatalyst was subjected to a durability test through chronoamperometry and was observed to be stable for 16 hours. Hence, this study opens a new avenue for future cost-effective efficient catalysts for overall water splitting as a solution to produce clean hydrogen.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2046-2069		WOS:000769551900001	35424786

In this report, a simple method has been proposed to synthesize chromium vanadate (CrVO4) nanoparticles. The prepared CrVO4nanoparticles were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. The thoroughly characterized CrVO4 nanoparticles were coated on the nickel foam (NF). Electrochemical performance of the CrVO4towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is evaluated for the first time. The CrVO4/NF exhibits 50 mA cm-2at an overpotential of ~605 mV and this observed overpotential is significantly lower than the overpotential exhibited by bare NF (775 mV). The observed low overpotential demonstrates good OER performance of the prepared CrVO4nanoparticles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1938-6737			INSPEC:22061469

The presence of selenium accelerates and modifies the decomposition of the carbonyl precursor converging in a cluster-like ruthenium chalcogenide compound.

In this study, binder-free and self-made Ni-Fe-Co nanostructure electrode was developed using electrodeposition method, and its electrocatalytic properties were investigated for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. The fabricated electrocatalyst exhibited excellent properties for the evolution of H-2 and O-2. Ni-Fe-Co nanostructure film required overpotentials of 91 mV for HER and 316 mV for OER in order to create a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the Tafel slope for HER and OER was measured as 86 and 43 mV/dec, respectively. In addition, the resulting electrode showed outstanding electrocatalytic stability, in which following a long period of electrolysis, the necessary overpotential to maintain a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) remained constant. This bifunctional electrode enables alkaline water electrolyzers, which can provide a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under a cell voltage of 1.6 V. Such desirable performance of fabricated electrode as an electrocatalyst for full water splitting can be attributed to high active surface area factor, the synergistic effect of the elements, and rapid separation of bubbles from the electrode surface. This study provides a new method for the rapid construction of efficient electrocatalyst for renewable energy sources. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A typical water electrolysis device is comprised of a cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and an anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Unfortunately, the OER consumes most of the overall electricity supply while generating negligible economic value, which inhibits the large-scale deployment of the water electrolysis technology. Here, we explored alternatives to the OER and demonstrated that electrooxidation of glycerol (a cheap byproduct of biodiesel and soap production) could lower anodic electricity consumption by up to 0.27 V while producing high-value formic acid with 96.2% faradaic efficiency (FE). Further, glycerol electrooxidation was combined with the photoelectrochemical HER to diminish the electricity requirement to 1.15 V, reducing the electricity consumption by similar to 30% relative to typical water electrolysis. This study suggests that solar-assisted co-electrolysis of high-volume block chemicals and water may be an energy efficient and economically viable strategy to realize the sustainable production of value-added chemicals and hydrogen energy.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000678216600001

Rice-straw-derived Cdots possess oxygen-containing functional groups that act as an electron-donating source to reduce Au3+ to Au-0 without the use of chemical reagents for the reduction of Au precursors. Additionally, the strong Au-carbon interaction promotes a high electron transfer of the Au/Cdot nanohybrid electrocatalyst, resulting in enhanced performance of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The overpotential is 150 mV at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) and the TOF value is 0.06s(-1), representing the most outstanding HER performance among Au-based catalysts as a non-Pt HER electrocatalyst. The HER activity is stably maintained for 2000 cycles as well as for 48 h. The synthesis of Cdots, the hybridization of Au/Cdot electrocatalyst, and the production of clean hydrogen fuel using Au/Cdots are zero CO2 emission strategies, not only preventing the emission of pollutants but also satisfying the energy needs of humankind.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000640492200001

However, precise manipulation of lattice defects in a 2D heterostructured material is still a challenge. Herein, through pyrolytic sulfurization of a layered Fe-doped Ni/Mo MOF precursor, a series of defect-rich Fe-doped NiS/MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets were obtained. For 0.1Fe-NiS/MoS2, abundant lattice defects induced by Fe atoms provide more water adsorption sites, and intimate interface between NiS and MoS2 can optimize the adsorption energy of a HER/OER intermediate. As a result, both HER and OER activities are significantly enhanced. The respective overpotential is 120 mV and 297 mV for the HER and OER. Small Tafel slopes of 69.0 mV dec(-1) and 54.7 mV dec(-1) indicate favorable electrochemical reaction kinetics. The catalytic performance of this material can be compared with those of 20% Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts and top-rated MoS2-based materials. For overall water splitting, only 1.66 V voltage is required to deliver 10 mA cm(-2). Long-term stability of 0.1Fe-NiS/MoS2 presents a prospect for its practical application.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000772508900001	35322819

Herein, we report a novel strategy for the synthesis of sulfur-doped mesoporous conducting carbon nitride supported defect-rich cobalt sulfide (O-Co3S4@S-MCN). Mesoporous silica material (MCM-41) is used as a template for the synthesis, and it performs dual functions: introducing porosity and providing in situ oxygen to fill the defects. O-Co3S4@S-MCN is highly crystalline and shows characteristic diffractions indicating the formation of defect-rich Co3S4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy proves the presence of Co-S (777.9 eV) and Co-O (782.4 eV) bonds in O-Co3S4@S-MCN. Further, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy clearly indicates the presence of C.N (1620 cm(-1)) and C.S (1090 cm(-1)) bonds. This composite material, OCo3S4@S-MCN, shows a low onset potential (1.6 V for 10 mA cm(-2)), high mass activity (71 A/g at 1.7 V), high rate (Tafel slope, 52 mV/dec), and excellent stability (only 5% decrease in current density after 2 h continuous electrolysis) for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction in 1.0 M KOH.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000580511100009

The experiment was carried out at 1100 degrees C with a 3:7 M ratio of Na2TiF6 to Al. Quasispherical TiAl alloy powder with an oxygen content of 0.32% could be achieved after vacuum ball milling of the reduction product. The thermal analysis results demonstrated that the aluminothermic reduction reaction was an exothermic process. Moreover, the kinetic parameters and the equation for the exothermic reaction rate of the reduction process were calculated by a thermoanalytical technique. According to XRD, SEM, and EDS analyses, the reduction mechanism and the evolution process of the products were discussed. Experimental evidence indicated that TiAl3 and TiF3 could be generated as intermediate products during reduction. TiAl could be produced through further reduction reactions between TiAl3 and TiF3.

Regardless of great efforts devoted to investigating its reaction mechanism, no unified conclusion has been reached to explain the pH-dependent kinetics. In this study, a full atomistic Pt(111)/water interfacial model is constructed where pH-dependent behaviors of HER, including Pt-H vibrations, hydrogen binding energy (HBE), and reaction kinetics are examined. In good accordance to previous experimental results, weaker HBE and Pt-H vibration are observed as pH increases. The thermodynamic and kinetic simulations of HER at Pt(111)/water interfaces indicate that HER in acidic media follows the Volmer-Tafel/Heyrovsky pathway with the second step being the rate-determining step (RDS), while it proceeds via the Volmer-Tafel pathway with water dissociation being the RDS in alkaline. The different proton sources and surface properties in acid and alkaline solutions alter HBEs and reaction pathways as well as activation energy barriers. Our full atomistic simulation mimics the electrochemical interface effectively and provides adequate understandings of HER mechanisms at universal pHs, which can be extended into studying other electrochemical reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000819372000002

Cerium dioxide (CeO2), an abundant rare-earth metal oxide, is famous for its easy formation of V-O and high oxygen mobility, which is believed to be conducive to its application in electrocatalytic HER. Herein, this study reports a facile modification strategy using rGO as a conductive support for CeO2 nanocrystals and introducing the transition metal Ni as the active dopant, resulting in the construction of the Ni-rGO/CeO2 electrocatalyst. It is found that rGO decoration prevents the aggregation of CeO2 NCs and increases the V-O concentration in the CeO2 nanocrystals as well, while the introduced Ni leads to further formation of V-O and serves as the active site for the HER reaction. Thus, the Ni-rGO/CeO2 electrocatalyst shows relatively low overpotential, a low Tafel slope, and great stability for HER, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of rGO decoration and Ni doping. This kind of facile strategy is promising for the design of noble-metal-free and low-cost electrocatalysts by the functional modification of CeO2-based nanocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1466-8033		WOS:000780873200001

Herein, we simply tailor the quantity and distribution of oxygen vacancies, as one of typical defects, on surface or bulk of thermal-treated WO3 in the different H-2 concentration. The quantity of bulk oxygen vacancies on WO3 consistently rises with the increased H-2 concentration, while that of surface oxygen vacancies presents a volcano type variation. The sample of WO3-H20, thermal-pretreated in 20% H-2, contains the largest amount of surface oxygen vacancies. Our results show that both surface and bulk oxygen vacancies on WO3 can promote the visible light photocatalytic activity in water splitting, however, in different ways. Bulk oxygen vacancies mainly promote the visible light harvesting and slightly restrain the electrons and holes recombination by narrowing band gap energy (E-g), while surface oxygen vacancies significantly increase the charge-carriers separation efficiency by lowering valence band edge (VBE). Compared with the light absorption, the separation of electrons and holes is more critical in photocatalytic oxygen evolution over WO3, revealing the more decisive role of surface oxygen vacancies than bulk oxygen vacancies. Expectedly, WO3-H20 shows the highest charge-carriers separation efficiency and visible light photocatalytic performance. Our work provides a new insight into designing of efficient defect-engineered semiconductors for the related solar light utilization processes.									125	7	0	0	9	0	127			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000446283800042

As a result of synergetic interactions among the hydroxides, rGO and NF, enhanced catalytic sites with improved charge transport between the electrode and electrolyte were perceived, resulting in significantly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with low overpotentials of 270 and 320 mV at 100 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively, in a 1.0 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. This performance is superior to those of the hydroxide-based electrode without incorporating rGO and the IrO2-benchmark electrode. Furthermore, when the conventional OER is substituted with urea decomposition (UOR) as a proxy anodic reaction, the electrolyzer achieves 100 and 500 mA cm(-2) at a lower potential by 150 and 120 mV, respectively than the OER counterpart without influencing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at the cathode. Notably, the rGO-incorporated electrode delivers a spectacularly high UOR current density of 1600 mA cm(-2) at 1.53 V vs. RHE, indicating the decomposition of urea at an outstandingly high rate.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000802297500001	35622073

In this communication, we report a versatile and one-step electrodeposition of NiFe nanosheets film on Ni foam (NiFe/NF) as a bifunctional catalytic material with high activity and stability for overall water splitting in basic electrolytes. The two-electrode electrolyzer using NiFe/NF as both anode and cathode can afford current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.64 V, which stimulates the design and development of transition metal alloy nanostructures as attractive bifunctional catalysts for electrochemical production of hydrogen fuels.

The efficiency of the electrode degradation of phenol was explored by a combination of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), total organic carbon (TOC) detector and chemical oxygen demand (COD) digestion device. Results show that the electrochemical reaction of phenol on Ti/IrO_2-Ta_2O_5 electrode mainly occurs in the oxygen evolution reaction zone, whereas a small amount of irreversible direct electrochemical oxidation reaction happens at higher concentration of phenol. The larger oxidation peak current and higher charge efficiency are obtained when the concentration of support electrolyte is 5 g·L~(-1) and the initial concentration of phenol is 100 mg·L~(-1). Under the suitable operating conditions of initial phenol concentration of 100 mg·L~(-1), electrolyte concentration of 5 g·L~(-1), reaction time of 120 min and current of 40 mA, the removal rate of phenol,COD,TOC and average current efficiency (ACE) can reach 82%,49%,39% and 24.5%, respectively.			采用循环伏安法研究了苯酚在Ti/IrO_2-Ta_2O_5电极上的电化学反应行为,通过高效液相色谱(HPLC)、总有机碳(TOC)测定仪、化学需氧量(COD)消解装置研究了该电极降解苯酚的效能。结果表明: 苯酚在Ti/IrO_2-Ta_2O_5电极上的电化学反应主要发生在析氧反应区,而较高浓度苯酚可发生少量的不可逆的直接电化学氧化反应。在支持电解质浓度为5 g·L~(-1)、苯酚初始浓度100 mg·L~(-1)时,可获得较大的氧化峰电流和较高的电荷利用率。在苯酚初始浓度100 mg·L~(-1),电解质浓度5 g·L~(-1),反应时间120 min,电流40 mA的适宜操作条件下,苯酚、COD、TOC去除率和平均电流效率(ACE)可分别达82%、49%、39%和24.5%。						0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1006-9941			CSCD:5676248

A test rig with an industrial scale electrochemical cell has been constructed and tested with filtrated oxygen rich seawater. The electrochemical cell was comprised of a silver mesh cathode and an iridium oxide anode with a cation exchange membrane. The effects of flow rate, pressure, and applied voltage on oxygen removal efficiency and resulting current were studied. Also, the differential pressure between the anode and cathode chambers affected the performance of the cell, and an overpressure of 0.20-0.30 bar in the anode chamber was optimal in order to obtain maximum oxygen removal. It was possible to achieve an oxygen concentration lower than 5 ppb in seawater at a flow rate of 5 L min(-1). No scaling or biofilm problems were observed during a 200 h test period.					252nd National Meeting and Exposition of the American-Chemical-Society (ACS)252nd National Meeting and Exposition of the American-Chemical-Society (ACS)	AUG 21-25, 2016AUG 21-25, 2016	Amer Chem SocAmer Chem Soc	Philadelphia, PAPhiladelphia, PA	3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0888-5885			WOS:000407540100020

Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a self-supported Ni2P/WO2.83 heterointerface microsphere as a highly active and low-cost catalyst for alkaline HER, which has simultaneously addressed these key issues by a joint application of heterointerface construction and defect and architecture engineering strategies. Our density functional theory calculations revealed Ni2P and WO2.83 optimized by the interface coupling effect work in concert to improve the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Importantly, the metalloid Ni2P in an intimate combination with the oxygen-defect-rich WO2.83 species endowed the electrocatalyst with high conductivity. Furthermore, the Ni2P/WO2.83 electrocatalyst presented a superhydrophilic nanostructure, ensuring abundant active sites and their accessibility. Benefiting from these attributes, the obtained Ni2P/WO2.83 heterointerface electrocatalyst exhibited excellent activity along with favorable stability for alkaline HER, especially at high current density, surpassing the most reported non-precious catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000812811200001	35417130

One of the prerequisites to overcome these challenges is maintaining the nature and intrinsic properties of individual graphene sheets while in the state of bulk material. Thus, in this Perspective contribution, the fabrication/synthesis of the monolithic polymeric and three-dimensional (3D) cross-linked bulk materials (3DGraphene) with (doped) 2D graphene sheets as the building block will first be briefly summarized. Then, the second part will cover the redox catalytic application of these bulk materials including doped 3DGraphene, the graphene-like material polymeric C3N4 and their hybrid materials. These will include mainly oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), and CO2 reduction for their latest development.

New reaction mechanisms are proposed involving solid-solution regions within both cubic and tetragonal spinel phases in addition to a continuous phase transition between them. In operando NPD is an ideal tool to follow the light elements such as lithium and oxygen in cathode materials which are often the key to fully understand their structural evolutions. Here, we report a novel methodology to prepare an extremely thick electrode with similar to 378 mg.cm(-2) loading density suitable for the in operando NPD studies. Enabled by such thick electrode, we find that the metal oxygen M-O (M = Li and Mn) bond lengths in both end members LiMn2O4 and Li2Mn2O4 experience pronounced changes larger than dictated by the change in lattice parameters because of the locally formed Jahn-Teller distorted Mn3+. First-principles density functional theory calculations confirm these metastable intermediates and further propose atomistic reaction pathways for the phase transition by coupling a global structure search algorithm. These findings redefine the conventional understandings on two-phase reactions of this spinel material.									18	3	0	0	0	0	18			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000455558100014

A four-factor and three-level orthogonal experiment is designed to optimise the preparation process of Ti/IrO2 + MnO2 anodes for oxygen evolution in 0.5M Na2SO4 solution. Surface characteristics and electrocatalytic activity of Ti/IrO2 + MnO2 anodes are investigated by a field emission scanning electron microscope and cyclic voltammetry. The orthogonal analysis indicates the order from the main to minor factor is thermal decomposition temperature, matrix etching time, Ir4+/Mn2+ mole ratio and total metal concentration of the precursor. Further optimisation experiments are also performed for the two main factors (thermal decomposition temperature and matrix etching time) based on the orthogonal experimental result. As a result, an optimal technological combination of 400 degrees C x 45 min x 6 : 4 x 0.3 mol L-1 is obtained. Moreover, a brief morphological verification is carried out.									2	5	0	0	0	0	6			1432-8917	1433-075X		WOS:000337146600085

Here, highly efficient acidic overall water splitting is realized by utilizing ultrasmall, monodispersed Iridium (Ir)-based nanoclusters (NCs) as the candidate, via a surfactant-free, wet-chemical, and large-scalable strategy. Benefiting from the high specific surface area, clean surface, and strong binding between NCs and supports, the IrM NCs exhibit attractive activities and durability for both oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic electrolytes, with IrNi NCs showing the best performance. More significantly, in the overall water splitting, IrNi NCs reach 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of only 1.58 V in 0.5 m H2SO4 electrolyte, holding promises for potential implementation of PEM water electrolysis. This work opens a new avenue toward designing bifunctional "acidic stable" catalysts for efficient overall water splitting.									230	9	0	0	6	0	232			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000405926800010

Here, Rh-Sn bimetallic nanocrystal catalysts supported on single-walled carbon nanotubes (RhxSny/SWNTs) are reported, and the Rh1Sn2/SWNTs electrocatalyst show best multifunctional electrocatalytic performance. Strong electron synergy between Rh and Sn is the source of high catalytic activity.Sn transfers electrons from Rh to Sn, forming a unique positive environment around Rh, which effectively optimizes the binding energy of the reaction intermediate and further improves the catalytic activity. An alkaline electrolyzer using Rh1Sn2/SWNTs catalyst demands an ultra-low cell voltage of 1.56 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting. In addition, Rh1Sn2/SWNTs demonstrates good oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance, making it an excellent catalyst for long-life Zn-air batteries.

In this work, a novel nanostructure of Fe-doped CoP hollow triangle plate arrays (Fe-CoP HTPAs) with unique mesoporous shells is designed and synthesized through a room-temperature postsynthetic ligand exchange reaction followed by a facile phosphorization treatment. The mild postsynthetic ligand exchange reaction of the presynthesized ZIF-67 TPAs with K-4[Fe(CN)(6)] in an aqueous solution at room temperature is of critical importance in achieving the final hollow nanostructure, which results in the production of CoFe(II)-PBA HTPAs that not only determine the formation of the interior voids in the nanostructure, but also provide the doping of Fe atoms to the CoP lattice. As expected, the as-prepared mesoporous Fe-CoP HTPAs exhibit pronounced activity for water splitting owing to the advantages of abundant active reaction sites, short electron and ion pathways, and favorable hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(H*)). For the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions with the Fe-CoP HTPAs in alkaline medium, the low overpotentials of 98 and 230 mV are observed, respectively, and the required cell voltage toward overall water splitting is only as low as 1.59 V for the driving current density of 10 mA cm(-2).									197	10	0	0	8	0	199			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000429579100022	29473308

Herein, a Co(OH)F material as a new electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is reported. The as-prepared 3D Co(OH)F microspheres are built by 2D nanoflake building blocks, which are further woven by 1D nanorod foundations. Weaving and building the substructures (1D nanorods and 2D nanoflakes) provides high structural void porosity with sufficient interior space in the resulting 3D material. The hierarchical structure of this Co(OH) F material combines the merits of all material dimensions in heterogeneous catalysis. The anisotropic low-dimensional (1D and 2D) substructures possess the advantages of a high surface-to-volume ratio and fast charge transport. The interconnectivity of the nanorods is also beneficial for charge transport. The high-dimensional (3D) architecture results in sufficient active sites per the projected electrode surface area and is favorable for efficient mass diffusion during catalysis. A low overpotential of 313 mV is required to drive an OER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) on a simple glassy carbon (GC) working electrode in a 1.0 m KOH aqueous solution.									290	24	0	0	7	0	294			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000406030900015	28585357

The simulations incorporated a potential dependent proton transfer (i.e. ion transfer, IT) step from the water (w) to organic (o) phases along with two homogeneous reactions (C1C2) occurring in the organic phase - an IT-C1C2 mechanism. The reaction of DMFc with H+( o) to form DMFc-hydride (DMFc-H+) was considered the first step (reaction 1), while reaction of DMFc-H+ with oxygen to form a peroxyl radical species, HO2, and DMFc(+) was deemed the second step (reaction 2). Subsequent reactions, between HO'2 and either DMFc or 1-1*, were considered to be fast and irreversible so that 2 was a 'proton-sink', such that further reactions were not included; in this way, the simulation was greatly simplified. The rate of 1, k(cf), and 2, k(chem), were determined to be 5 x 10(2) and 1 x 104 L mol(-1) respectively, for DMFc as the electron donor. Similarly, the rates of biphasic ORR for 1,1'-dimethylferrocene (DFc) and Pc were considered equivalent in terms of this reaction mechanism; therefore, their rates were determined to be 1 x 10(2) and 5 x 10(2) L mol(-1) s(-1) for 1 and 2, respectively. The reactive and diffusive layer thicknesses are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000342269300007

Herein, Fe-doped NiS2 nanoparticles on a carbon matrix (Fe-NiS2/C) are facilely prepared via a two-step solvothermal process, where Ni-containing metal organic frameworks (Ni-MOFs) are vulcanized in situ and carbonized by a solvothermal method to form abundant NiS2 nanoparticles homogeneously distributed on a carbon matrix (NiS2/C), followed by doping with ferric ions via a similar solvothermal treatment. The resulting Fe-NiS2/C nanoparticle composites show a rougher surface than the NiS2/C parent, likely due to the formation of more structural defects after ferric ion doping, which maximizes the exposure of active sites. Moreover, ferric ion doping can also regulate the surface electronic state to reduce the activation energy barrier for OER on NiS2/C sample. With these merits, the best sample Fe-NiS2/C-30 only requires a potential of +1.486 V (vs. RHE) to reach an OER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and can retain 96.85% of its initial current after continuous working for about 10 h in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, along with a small Tafel slope of 45.66 mV/dec, outperforming a commercial RuO2 catalyst. The results in this work enrich the method to tailor the catalytic activity of transition metal sulfides for electrochemical energy technologies.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9				2073-4344		WOS:000472678500067

On the atomic scale, a scaling relation between the OH and OOH intermediates has been recognized as main limitation for the development of highly active OER catalysts. Breaking scaling relation is considered as a universal remedy to obtain OER materials with enhanced electrocatalytic activity. While it is a well-accepted paradigm that the optimum OER catalyst reveals a symmetric thermodynamic free-energy landscape, recently, it was suggested that the thermodynamic ideal may correspond to a free-energy landscape with asymmetric shape, allowing thermoneutral stabilization of the key intermediate at the target overpotential. In the present manuscript, we analyze breaking scaling relation in the OER to the symmetric and asymmetric thermodynamic free-energy landscapes by statistical methods at different applied overpotentials. Our analysis reveals that breaking scaling relation to the asymmetric rather than to the symmetric picture is statistically more significant as soon as an overpotential is applied, calling for a change in mindset when thermodynamic considerations are used for catalyst optimization.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000778913400003

In fact, the surface tension is strongly influenced by the presence in the surrounding atmosphere of reactive gases through solution, adsorption mechanisms and/or surface reactions. In particular, oxygen, which shows a high surface activity towards a large number of metallic systems, is the most important contaminant of liquid metals and alloys.Theoretical approaches for estimating the oxygen mass transfer at the liquid-vapour interface under inert atmosphere and vacuum have been developed already in order to relate the observed physical properties to the real surface composition data.In the present work a model of the interfacial transport of a liquid metal-oxygen system under Knudsen conditions that foresees the temporal evolution of the interfacial composition is presented. The diffusion characteristic times for reaching steady-state conditions are evaluated in order to define two system "sizes" depending on the different oxygen transport mechanisms in the liquid phase.An experimental study of the interface evolution is at present under way and preliminary results show a satisfactory agreement with theoretical studies.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0022-2461			WOS:000071337900003

In this work, it is demonstrated that the layered structure makes bulk NiFe LDH intrinsically not stable in OER and the deactivation mechanism of NiFe LDH in OER is further revealed. Both operando electrochemical and structural characterizations show that the interlayer basal plane in bulk NiFe LDH contributes to the OER activity, and the slow diffusion of proton acceptors (e.g., OH-) within the NiFe LDH interlayers during OER causes dissolution of NiFe LDH and therefore decrease in OER activity with time. To improve diffusion of proton acceptors, it is proposed to delaminate NiFe LDH into atomically thin nanosheets, which is able to effectively improve OER stability of NiFe LDH especially at industrial operating conditions such as elevated operating temperatures (e.g., at 80 degrees C) and large current densities (e.g., at 500 mA cm(-2)).									167	12	0	0	8	0	169			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000483933000001	31461181

Herein, N and O dual-doped carbon fiber (CF-O-N) has been hydrothermally synthesized as a three-dimensional (3D) electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The co-doping of N and O atoms acts as dual-active-site to improve OER properties, while the rough surface and large pores in CF-O-N electrode may expose abundant active sites and sufficient contacting in catalyst/electrolyte interfaces. CF-O-N electrode behaves excellently for OER with only 130 and 590 mV to generate 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. The superior OER property of CF-O-N electrode than single N- or O-doped CF implies the synergistic effect between N and O dopants that may further enhance OER activities. More importantly, dual-doped CF-O-N electrode displays roust stability in 10,000 cycles of cyclic voltammogram (CV) and 12 h chronoamperometry test with unchangeable structures proved by post physical characterizations. It may provide a facile and rational design of self-supported and metal-free materials with excellent activities for water oxidation and holds promising for further industrialization.

However, the accompanying anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reduces the energy efficiency of the process without providing a salable product. Replacing OER with alternative organic oxidation reactions (OORs) is an emerging strategy to reduce the full-cell potential and generate valuable products on both sides of the cell. We pursue carbon monoxide reduction that avoids carbonate formation and benefits from highly alkaline anode conditions favorable for 00R. This coelectrolysis strategy achieves a cathodic C2+ product stream (719, FE) and an anodic C-3 product stream (75% FE) at 180 mA cm(-2) with a full-cell potential of 1.34 V. The integrated system reduces the CO-to-C2H4 energy requirement by 5590 (to similar to 72 GJ/ton_C2H4), halving the projected energy cost of ethylene production from CO2.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2380-8195			WOS:000707987500019

Herein, we report ultra-low ruthenium (Ru) doped defective CoFe-MOF (Ru@CoFe/D-MOF) hollow nanorods by the NaBH4 reduction strategy at room temperature for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The partial reduction process endowed the catalysts with rich oxygen vacancies (O-v) and low coordinated CoFe nanoparticles (CoFe NPs), which have advantages in exposing abundant active sites. In addition, benefiting from the defective features and heterostructure surfaces, an ultra-low amount of Ru could be stabilized on the surface of CoFe/D-MOFs to further enhance their catalytic activity. Consequently, the well-designed Ru@CoFe/D-MOFs demonstrated excellent OER performance with a low overpotential (eta = 265 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), good overall water splitting activity (1.56 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) and long-term stability for more than 40 hours in alkaline solution. The mechanistic analysis validated that the ultra-low amount of Ru was able to optimize the electronic configuration of CoFe/D-MOFs and tailor the adsorption between the OER intermediates and the heterostructure surface, thus leading to enhanced OER performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000865944700001

Here, an investigation of the catalyst layer morphology is presented with respect to the bifunctional ORR/OER activity and durability of MnO2-LaCoO3 catalyst in 6M KOH. Graphene, N-doped graphene and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), alone and in combination, were studied as catalyst layer support. The graphene and N-doped graphene microsheets were prepared by ionic liquid-assisted electrochemical exfoliation of graphite. It was found that the hybrid support composed of graphene and MWCNT (1:1 wt) generated up to an order of magnitude higher ORR and OER current densities for MnO2-LaCoO3, compared to either graphene or MWCNT supports individually. The 3D scaffold-like architecture of the graphene microsheets and MWCNT pillars enhances the catalyst layer utilization efficiency and also improves the catalyst anchoring. The latter effects, together with the lower rates of carbon corrosion in the OER region and peroxide generation in the ORR region on the graphene-based supports compared to the reference Vulcan XC-72, contribute to the improved activity of the hybrid catalyst layer as demonstrated using accelerated potential deep cycle experiments.[GRAPHICS].									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000459178400005

In its presence, the temperature for half-maximal inactivation (t(1/2)) was generally shifted downward by 3-12 degrees C. Glycinebetaine stabilized photoinduced oxygen evolving reactions of PS2 by protecting the tetranuclear Mn cluster and the extrinsic proteins of this complex. A weaker, although noticeable, stabilizing effect was observed in photoinduced PS2 electron transport reactions that did not originate in the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). This weaker protection by glycinebetaine was probably exerted on the PS2 reaction centre. Glycinebetaine protected also photoinduced electron transport across PS1 against thermal inactivation. The protective effect was exerted on plastocyanin, the mobile protein in the lumen that carries electrons from the integral cytochrome b(6)f complex to the PS1 complex.									6	0	0	0	7	0	7			0300-3604			WOS:000086891700006

In the Y-Ba-Cu-O system, P(O-2) ranged from 0.02 to 1 atm, and the following reaction occurred during heating: YBa2Cu3O6+delta (Y123) --> Y2BaCuO5 (Y211) + L. With an increase of oxygen partial pressure or decrease of pulling rate, the morphology of the solidified interface changed from mushy to equiaxed, cellular, and planar. The continuous Y123 grains were readily obtained under high oxygen partial pressure. Based on the constitutional supercooling theory and combining the result of the yttrium solubility Limit for different oxygen partial pressures, the influences of oxygen partial pressure on Y123 morphological evolution were clarified.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0884-2914			WOS:A1996VT78400008		
J	KOOP, MJ; RAND, DAJ; CULPIN, B								A GUIDE TO THE INFLUENCE OF BISMUTH ON LEAD-ACID-BATTERY PERFORMANCE - DISCUSSION								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				45	3			365	377		10.1016/0378-7753(93)80025-K				JUL 1993	1993	A review is given of the literature that deals with the influence of bismuth on the microstructure, oxygen/hydrogen evolution kinetics and anodic corrosion of lead and lead alloys with regard to their performance in lead/acid batteries. Analysis shows that there is considerable disagreement as to the effect of bismuth on lead microstructure. For example, the various investigators report an increase, a decrease, or negligible change in grain size. In general, it is concluded that the oxygen overpotential on PbO2 is lowered in the presence of bismuth. The effect is enhanced as the bismuth content is increased. It is postulated that the behaviour results from the formation of a mixed oxide, PbO2. BiO(x). By contrast, cathodic hydrogen evolution is reported widely to be largely unaffected by bismuth. Nevertheless, there is evidence that the reaction is particularly sensitive to the surface characteristics of electrodes and that these features can induce either a suppression or an enhancement of the hydrogen-gassing rate. Many studies have shown that bismuth accelerates the anodic corrosion of lead alloys, especially at high concentrations of bismuth. At 0.1 wt.% bismuth and below, the effect on the corrosion rate is negligible. The authors of this discussion are of the opinion that much of the conflicting evidence in the areas reported is caused by spurious differences in grain structure that are introduced by variations in sample preparation, rather than by the action of bismuth itself. In battery-related tests, bismuth has usually been found to exert little influence on performance, but there is some suggestion that cycle life is increased. The present body of knowledge is insufficient to confirm the correctness of any currently specified maximum level for bismuth with respect to a given battery design.									14	3	0	0	0	0	19			0378-7753			WOS:A1993LQ33200010

Photochemical activity of photosystem II and hydrogen photoproduction in sulfur-deprived Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutants D1-R323D and D1-R323L								Biophysics				50	6			924	30						Nov.-Dec. 2005	2005	The role of photosystem II in hydrogen photoproduction by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells was studied in mutants with modified D1-protein. In D1-R323D and D1-R323L mutants, the replacement of arginine with aspartate or leucine, respectively, resulted in the disruption of electron transport at the donor side of photosystem II. The rate of oxygen evolution in D1-R323D decreased twice as compared to the pseudowild type (pWt), and no oxygen evolution was detected in D1-R323L. The latter was incapable of photoautotrophic growth. The dynamics of changes in oxygen content, the reduction of active reaction centers of photosystem II (DeltaF/Fm'), and hydrogen production rate in pWt were found to be similar to the wild type, if cultivated under sulfur deprivation in a closed bioreactor. The observed gradual decrease in DeltaF/Fm' turned to a sharp drop almost to zero followed by a partial recovery during which the production of hydrogen began. The transition to the anaerobic phase in D1-R323D cultured in a sulfur-free medium occurred earlier than in pWt grown under the same conditions. However, the partial recovery of photosystem II activity and hydrogen production started later, and the rate of hydrogen production was low. The D1-R323L mutant incapable of oxygen evolution rapidly entered anaerobiosis but produced no oxygen. The kinetics of photoinduced redox transitions in P700 was similar in all investigated strains and was not affected by diuron. This implies that the mutants had a pool of reducers, which could not donate an electron via the quinone pool or cytochrome to photosystem I. However, in the D1-R323L mutant lacking the active photosystem II, this condition was not sufficient to support hydrogenase activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0006-3509			INSPEC:8961345

It provides high current density (0.6-2.0 A cm(-2) at 1.75-2.20 V per cell) and high energy conversion efficiency (80-90%). Ir-Based catalysts are the current state-of-the-art electrocatalyst materials, and have been widely utilized because they offer high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and moderate resistance to acidic corrosion. However, the OER durability of Ir-based catalysts does not meet the practical demands. At low pH values the anodic potential (1.8-2.2 V) driving the OER usually oxidizes Ir-based catalysts and makes them vulnerable to dissolution, which in turn degrades the electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability. In order to address the problems associated with these Ir-based catalysts, a number of multimetallic compositions have been investigated, and, notably, increases in mass activity and durability compared with Ir-based catalysts have been accomplished. Here, notable recent advances in the development and understanding of multimetallic electrocatalysts toward the OER in acidic media are presented. Synthetic strategies, synergies in multimetallic systems, and their catalytic performances are systematically discussed in an attempt to advance the development of economical and eco-friendly hydrogen production. Lastly, the challenges and the outlook for further development are discussed.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2052-1537		WOS:000640991000001

Herein, a series of novel Fe and Nb co-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2)nanosheet arrays were successfully grownin situon Ni foamviaa chlorine etching method. The representative NiFe3Nb2-OH displayed outstanding OER performance with an overpotential of 294 mV to deliver 100 mA cm(-2)in an alkaline electrolyte, outperforming other Ni related electrocatalysts. NiFe3Nb2-OH exhibited a stability of 90 h without obvious potential change at 50 mA cm(-2). Significantly, the doped Fe and Nb effectively enhanced the electrochemical active area and electronic transfer capability of beta-Ni(OH)(2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the Gibbs free energy of the OER intermediates on the Fe, Nb co-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2)electrode was optimized. The tuned electronic interactions between Fe, Nb and Ni apparently boosted the OER performance of NiFe3Nb2-OH. These results demonstrated that Fe and Nb co-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2)is a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst in alkaline media.									7	1	0	0	1	0	8			2052-1553			WOS:000569507700017

However, the mechanical properties of these materials, formed incrementally or layer-by-layer by photopolymerization, remain unclear. One critical issue is the strength of the interfaces between adjacent layers. During free radical photopolymerization, these interfaces are exposed to atmospheric oxygen, which is detrimental to the polymerization reaction due to radical inhibition. The influence of oxygen on the interfacial properties, however, is still not well understood. This paper investigates the effect of oxygen on the mechanical behavior of interfaces. In order to facilitate mechanical tests, the interfacial strength is investigated using a part-by-part method that mimics the conventional layer-by-layer photopolymerization process. The experiments found that oxygen enhances the interfacial strength by improving interfacial bridging macromolecular links. A theoretical model is developed to capture the interfacial evolution. Numerical studies further illustrate the role of several processing parameters such as curing condition and resin component. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

After leaching in dilute acid and annealing in air at mild temperature, the cathode dismantled from the battery discharged to 0.8 V is converted from -MnO2 into epsilon-MnO2, which features abundant defects, a porous structure and a high surface area and shows high activity in catalyzing the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER). Remarkably, the recycled manganese oxide from one ZMB is estimated to sustain 1000 coin-type ZABs, which could potentially deliver a total capacity of 675 A h and an energy of 810 W h. Additionally, a rechargeable ZAB assembled with the recycled epsilon-MnO2 exhibits a considerable charge-discharge voltage separation of 0.65 V at 2 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, we show that the hydrothermally prepared -MnO2 serves initially as a cathode in a ZMB and directly functions as an efficient air electrode in a ZAB at its discharged states. This study offers a unique way to synthesize active manganese oxide electrocatalysts and a promising strategy to recycle spent batteries.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2052-1553			WOS:000445217200011

The use of NMC as a template improves the electronic conductivity of the catalyst, while the high specific surface area increases the number of active sites and the highly ordered mesoporous structure enables fast mass transfer. As a result, the Ni3S4/NMC catalyst shows a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.89 V vs. RHE for the ORR in 0.1 M KOH and a potential of 1.57 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) (E-j=10) for the OER in 1.0 M KOH. The potential gap Delta E (Delta E = E-j=10 - E-1/2) is 0.68 V, which is significantly lower than the 0.8 V for 10 wt% Pt/C + IrO2. The primary Zn-air battery shows a maximum power density of 186 mW cm(-2) and an energy density as high as 805 W h kg(-1) at 100 mA cm(-2). The battery also exhibits favorable long-term cycling behaviour (the polarization voltage increased by only 0.05 V after 300 charge/discharge cycles for 100 h). This work provides an effective strategy for the design of metal-carbon nanohybrid electrocatalysts for low-cost energy storage and conversion devices.									31	1	0	0	3	0	31			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000483565400028		
J	BARTSEVICH, VV; PAKRASI, HB								MOLECULAR-IDENTIFICATION OF AN ABC TRANSPORTER COMPLEX FOR MANGANESE - ANALYSIS OF A CYANOBACTERIAL MUTANT STRAIN IMPAIRED IN THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC OXYGEN EVOLUTION PROCESS								EMBO JOURNAL				14	9			1845	1853		10.1002/j.1460-2075.1995.tb07176.x				MAY 1 1995	1995	During photosynthesis, the photosystem II (PSII) pigment-protein complex catalyzes oxygen evolution, a reaction in which a four-manganese ensemble plays a crucial role. Using a newly developed selection scheme, we have isolated BP13, a random photosynthesis-deficient mutant strain of the cyanobacterium, Synechocystis 6803. This mutant grew slowly under photoautotrophic conditions, and had a low oxygen evolution activity. Biochemical analysis revealed that the lesion in this mutant strain had specifically affected the Mn ensemble in PSII. Interestingly, incubation of BP13 cells with micromolar levels of added Mn induced rapid recovery of oxygen evolution activity. The mutant could be complemented with a fragment of wild-type chromosomal DNA containing three closely linked genes, mntA, mntB and mntC. These gene products showed significant sequence similarities with polypeptide components of bacterial permeases that are members of the 'ABC (ATP binding cassette) superfamily' of transporter proteins. We determined that in the BP13 strain, a single nucleotide change had resulted in the replacement of an alanine by an aspartic acid residue in MntA, a soluble protein containing ATP binding motifs. These results suggest that the mntCAB gene cluster encodes polypeptide components of a Mn transporter, the first such protein complex identified in any organism.									116	0	0	0	107	1	121			0261-4189	1460-2075		WOS:A1995QX74400001	7743991

Microbial growth was best controlled in samples stored in high O-2 (70-80 kPa) and high CO2 (20 kPa). Physicochemical parameters (pH, total soluble solids, and firmness) were affected by the different atmospheres, but changes occurred faster in samples stored in air. Retention of vitamin C was at least 65% in the studied atmospheres and its evolution was modeled using a first-order reaction. The contents of the main anthocyanins found in strawberries, pelargonidin3-O-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, and pelargonidin-3-O-rutinoside, showed transient increases up to 40-50% over storage time in some atmospheres, especially in 70 kPa O2 20 kPa CO2, and anthocyanin evolutions were modeled using a consecutive reaction mechanistic kinetic model. The antioxidant capacity retained by samples stored in all the atmospheres remained above 80% after storage at 5 degrees C. The storage of fresh-cut strawberries in high O-2 and high CO2 atmospheres, especially in 70 kPa O2 20 kPa CO2, may extend product shelf-life for at least 20 d with adequate control of microbiological decay, maintaining fruit quality and enhancing anthocyanin content.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0925-5214	1873-2356		WOS:000797911200008

However, formation of the YSZ-CGO solid solution with low ionic conductivity and the SrZrO3 (SZO) insulating phase still happens during cell production and long-term operation, causing poor performance and degradation. Unlike many experimental investigations exploring these phenomena, consistent and quantitative computational modeling of the microstructure evolution at the oxygen electrode-electrolyte interface is scarce. We combine thermodynamic, 1D kinetic, and 3D phase-field modeling to computationally reproduce the element redistribution, microstructure evolution, and corresponding ohmic loss of this interface. The influences of different ceramic processing techniques for the CGO interlayer, i.e., screen printing and physical laser deposition (PLD), and of different processing and long-term operating parameters are explored, representing a successful case of quantitative computational engineering of the oxygen electrode-electrolyte interface in SOFCs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2057-3960		WOS:000683357500002

All these rate processes have been analyzed using the congruent dissociative vaporization of the participating solid reactants or catalysts and are described by similar mechanistic schemes. The possible role of atomic oxygen evolution in oxidation catalysis is discussed. Quantitative proofs of the common mechanism of these reactions were provided by agreement between calculated reaction enthalpies and the Arrhenius E parameters, the retardation effect of gaseous products on the reaction rates, and the accordance between experimental and theoretical ratios of isobaric to equimolar values of the E parameter. In conclusion, milestones in the history of the thermochemical approach during the last century are discussed.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000321784900020

In order to overcome this burgeoning issue, worldwide research efforts have been carried out to find alternative, and efficient electrocatalysts. Due to its cheap and abundant sources, FeCo-based materials are considered as better candidate electrocatalysts for OER. Herein, a nanocomposite catalyst consisting of FeCoSe2 nanoparticles and Co0.85Se nanosheets was synthesized via a one-pot hydrothermal method. The resultant FeCoSe2/ Co0.85Se heterostructure catalysts can further used as a self-supported catalytic electrode to drive the OER, which exhibits the overpotential of 0.33 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 50.8 mV dec(-1). Raman spectroscopy was employed to explore the intrinsic active species of as-prepared hybrid catalyst during the OER process, and test result shows that metal selenides was acting as the precursor of the real reaction species. This work provides a possibility to develop cheap and effective OER electrocatalysts to replace the costly noble metal catalysts for OER in electrochemical devices. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, MnCo2S4 is grown on nickel foam by a two-step method, hydrothermal and sulfuration method. Experiments have shown that the resulting MnCo2S4/NF exhibits a low overpotential of 310 mV to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M potassium hydroxide for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In addition, the MnCo2S4/NF exhibits a low overpotential of only 167 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, MnCo2S4/NF is acted as a bifunctional water splitting catalyst, and in 1.0 M potassium hydroxide, in order to maintain a current of 10 mA cm(-2), a low battery voltage of 1.61 V is required. The nanostructure, which provides a large specific surface area, which in turn increases the reactive sites, facilitates contact of large areas of water with the catalyst, and rapid transfer of electrons. At the same time, through a series of characterization (XRD, SEM and XPS), it is proved that the catalyst is efficient and stable under alkaline condition.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2365-6549			WOS:000466520000011

Herein, we have constructed one-dimensional (1D) cobalt sulfide and vanadium sulfide heterojunction nanowires arranged on carbon cloth (Co9S8-V3S4/CC) as bifunctional electrocatalysts for the efficient overall water splitting. The 1D wire-structured Co9S8-V3S4 heterojunctions possess large surface area, plentiful active sites and rapid transport of electrons/reactants and the release of gas. Importantly, the electron transfer from Co9S8 to V3S4 occurs at the interface due to the strong electronic coupling effect in Co9S8-V3S4 heterojunction, in which the electron-attracting V3S4 (V2+) optimizes the adsorption of H* active species for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while the electron-losing Co9S8 (Co3+) responds to the enhancement of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Co9S8-V3S4/CC exhibits low overpotentials of 85 and 232 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slopes of 51 and 59 mV dec(-1) for HER and OER, respectively. Especially, the electrolyzer with Co9S8 V3S4/CC as both the anode and cathode requires low onset voltage of 1.35 V and cell voltage of 1.53 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits high Faradaic efficiencies and robust stability. It can be driven by a solar cell (1.53 V) for continuous production of hydrogen and oxygen. This study highlights the design of 1D sulfide heterojunction in pursuit of highly efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									18	2	0	0	0	0	18			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000607768700001

Herein, we report a flexible electrode based on Co-CoO chi/N-C nanosheet arrays (NSAs) directly grown on a carbon cloth fabricated by pyrolysis of the core-shell CoAl-LDH@polydopamine (CoAl-LDH@PDA) NSA precursor. The as-synthesized Co-CoO chi/N-C NSAs exhibit excellent bifunctional electrochemical activity for the ORR and OER, with a small potential gap (0.678 V) and excellent durability. Furthermore, a high power density (20.7 mW cm(-2)), superior flexibility, and cycling stability for flexible all-solid-state zinc-air battery is achieved on Co-CoO chi/N-C NSAs. The excellent performance of Co-CoO chi/N-C NSAs comes from its integrated nanosheet array architecture and the synergetic effect between Co-CoO chi and N-C. This in situ synthesis strategy builds up a general approach for fabricating other multifunctional electrodes toward a large variety of important electrochemical processes.									20	1	0	0	2	0	21			2168-0485			WOS:000507429100051

As a potential electrochemical energy storage device,zinc-air batteries (ZABs) received considerable interest in the field of energy storage because of their high energy density and environmental friendliness. However,the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions limit the commercial development of ZABs,so there is an urgent need to develop efficient and low-cost non-noble metal bifunctional catalysts. Electrospun one-dimensional (1D) nanofibers with unique properties such as high porosity and large specific surface area have a profound impact on providing more active sites,shortening the diffusion pathways for ions/electrons,and improving the kinetics vis-a-vis intercalation/de-intercalation of the active substrate,which endow them with promising application in the field of energy storage devices,especially ZABs. This review first introduces the electrospinning technique and the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction activity of electrospun nanofibers with a self-supported structure,as well as the application of electrospun nanofibers in the liquid and flexible solid-state ZABs,which would demonstrate the superiority of electrospinning technique towards ZABs. Finally,the remaining challenges and research directions of ZABs based on electrospun nanofibers electrocatalysts are shortly discussed.			日益严重的环境污染与能源危机成为人类社会可持续发展进程中的最大阻碍。锌-空气电池作为一类很有发展潜力的电化学储能装置,因其高能量密度和环境友好等特点在能源领域引发了广泛关注,然而空气电极中的氧还原反应和析氧反应动力学缓慢,严重限制了它的商业化应用,因此当前迫切需要开发高效廉价的非贵金属双功能催化剂。静电纺丝制备的一维纳米纤维具有高孔隙率和大比表面积等优点,缩短了离子扩散距离并提供了更多的反应活性位点,有效改善了活性物质的嵌入/脱出反应动力学,在储能器件领域尤其是锌-空气电池中有广阔的应用前景。首先简要介绍了静电纺丝技术,然后探讨了电纺纤维及其自支撑结构的氧还原/析氧反应的催化反应活性,并通过经典的文献案例讨论了电纺纤维在液态和柔性固态锌-空气电池中的应用研究最新进展,最后,对基于电纺纤维催化剂的锌-空气电池应用面临的挑战和未来的发展方向进行了展望。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-3962			CSCD:6813553

This composite material is used as a flexible asymmetric supercapacitor positive electrode and oxygen evaluation reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. Integrated carbon foams with controllable three-dimensional pores are easily obtained and served as conductive backbones for the growth of the flower-like NiMn-LDH nanoarrays. The as-prepared flexible electrode, combining a highly open scaffold-like structure with well-designed electron transfer channels, shows significantly enhanced cyclic stability (99.6% of the initial activity maintained after 5000 cycles) and high energy density (41.0 Wh.Kg(-1)) in aqueous electrolyte. The as-prepared SC@NiMn-LDH@G//NPC asymmetric supercapacitor can lighten a LED indicator for more than 10 minutes. Additionally, this composite presents extremely low overpotentials (220 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2)) and low Tafel slopes (30 mV.dec(-1)) in alkaline medium.

The amphiprotic characteristics of sulfamic acid are due to its amine and sulphonic acid functional groups. Metal-based catalysts can be utilized to fabricate bimetallic and dual-ligand linked FeCo-SA/DABCO nanosheets with improved catalytic performance. The crystal structure of bimetallic FeCo-SA/DABCO consisted of alternating organic hydrocarbons SA and DABCO and inorganic metal-oxygen layers. FeCo-SA/DABCO provided an overpotential (eta(10)) of 290 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) together with a small Tafel slope of 112.79 mV dec(-1) and also exhibited long-term durability. Electrochemical results showed that FeCo-SA/DABCO was superior to FeCo-SA and Co-SA/DABCO. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the theoretical overpotential of FeCo-SA/DABCO is 0.62 eV, which was lower than that of FeCo-SA. The introduction of composite SA/DABCO ligands can change the rate-determining step, which can improve the conductivity and reduce the reaction barrier for the formation of intermediates, thereby affecting the catalytic activity and changing the overall electron transfer capacity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1466-8033		WOS:000843494500001

Journal of the American Chemical Society											10.1021/jacs.2c05247				2022-Nov-04	2022	The highly efficient bifunctional catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the key to achieving high-performance rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Non-precious-metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted intense interest due to their low cost and very high metal atomic utilization; however, high-activity bifunctional non-precious-metal SACs are still rare. Herein, we develop a new nanospace-confined sulfur-enamine copolymerization strategy to prepare a new type of bifunctional Mo SACs with O/S co-coordination (Mo-O2S2-C) supported on the multilayered, hierarchically porous hollow tubes. The as-prepared catalyst can not only expose more active sites and facilitate mass transfer due to their combined micropores, mesopores, and macropores but also have the S/O co-coordination structure for optimizing the adsorption energies of the ORR intermediates. Its ORR activity is among the highest, and it shows a low overpotential of 324 mV for the OER at 10 mA cm-2 in all of the reported Mo-based catalysts. When assembled in a Zn-air battery, it exhibits a high maximal power density of 197.3 mW cm-2 and a long service life of 50 hours, superior to those of Zn-air batteries using commercial Pt/C+IrO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1520-5126		MEDLINE:36331111	36331111

So exploring an ideal electrocatalytic valorization reaction to replace the sluggish OER and boost H-2 production is desirable. Methanol, as the most important liquid C1 resource with huge production capacity, is rather inexpensive and practical for utilization. In this work, in situ synthesized carbon nanofibers@NiSe (CNFs@NiSe) core/sheath nanostructures act as robust and stable electrocatalysts for highly selective methanol conversion to value-added formate with a high production rate and faradaic efficiency. Notably, the methanol conversion replaces the sluggish OER to boost H-2 production at a high generation rate that is 7.5 times that in the absence of methanol, thus lowering the energy consumption. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the high electrocatalytic selectivity is attributed to the unique exposed NiSe (102) facets, which facilitate the methanol conversion to formate by suppressing further oxidation to the greenhouse gas CO2.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000509471800013

Therefore, a large surface area, rich in exposed surface atoms, and mesoporosity are very effective parameters in electrochemical reactions. Herein, we have, for the first time, synthesized free-standing mesoporous Fe3S4 nanosheets with a large surface area of 129.65 m(2) g(-1) through a microwave-assisted synthetic technique. Our present synthesis strategy demonstrates a facile and cost-effective method to overcome the obstacles of fabricating ultrathin two-dimensional graphene-like transition metal sulfide nanosheets. The as-synthesized Fe3S4 nanosheets are applied as both cathodic and anodic electrodes for full water electrolysis. Remarkably, Fe3S4 nanosheets can exhibit a small overpotential (eta = 103 mV) to provide the required 10 mA cm(-2) current density during the HER process. Meanwhile, a low overpotential of 230 mV is also exhibited for the OER process to allow a 10 mA cm(-2) current density. Furthermore, the assembled full water splitting device can achieve potentials of 1.43 and 1.65 V at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) current densities, respectively, in an alkaline electrolyte with excellent cycling stability over 24 h. Our current study may provide an advanced channel for transition metal sulfide catalysts towards commercial water splitting applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000778356600001	35380141

The chemical composition, surface structure and morphology are characterized by EDX, SEM, and XRD analysis. The activity toward the partial electrode reaction of oxygen evolution (OER) is assessed in aqueous alkaline media at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry and steady state polarization curves are used to obtain information about the reactions proceeding on the catalysts surface, to determine the potentials of oxygen offset and the corresponding current densities and thus, to assess the OER catalytic efficiency. The results obtained showed that the Co-based MPT-supported catalysts are stable at the agressive conditions of the alkaline water electrolysis. The metal content influences the structure and morphology. Among the tested samples the one with 30 wt.% metal content (Co30) demonstrates superior performance and best catalyst utilization. The OER starts at 0,64V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and reaches current density of about 55 mA cm(-2) already at 0,75V. This is explained with size effects (smallest Co particles) ensuring largest electrochemically active surface area.					10th International Symposium on Electrochemical Impedance Analysis10th International Symposium on Electrochemical Impedance Analysis	JUN 01-05, 2014JUN 01-05, 2014		Borovets, BULGARIABorovets, BULGARIA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0324-1130			WOS:000377711500015

Here, nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon/N-CNTs frameworks (Co@NC-m) with the vital graphitization and defect engineering, which encapsulated with cobalt nanoparticles and fabricated by a simple carbonization of Co/Zn zeolitic benzimidazole framework. The as-prepared optimal Co@NC-0.75 shows outstanding catalytic performance for both ORR and OER, the potential gap between the ORR potential with a current density of -3mAcm(-2) and the OER potential with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is 0.78V, illustrating that it is one of the best MOFs-derived bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts reported to date. More importantly, the Co@NC-0.75 demonstrates comparable catalytic performance and durability to those of commercial Pt/C for ORR and commercial RuO2 for OER. The superior bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity is mainly attributed to the vital balance between the degree of graphitization and defect engineering, which is proposed to enhance the electron transfer efficiency and conductivity. This work provides more opportunities for understanding and designing other porous graphitized carbon-based electrocatalysts.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000459734900027

However, the limited number of active sites severely hinders its application in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Black phosphorus quantum dots (BP QDs), with large exposed surface areas and a mass of active edge sites, are suitable for loading on MoS2 nanosheets to form type-II heterojunctions, resulting in additional active sites and higher mobility, thereby improving the OER performance of MoS2. In addition, photo-assistance was applied to reduce high energy barriers and the energy loss, thus improving the overall efficiency of energy conversion. Here, BP QDs and MoS2 nanosheets were prepared by liquid phase exfoliation and mixed-dimensional BP QDs/MoS2 heterojunctions were constructed. The experimental results show that the BP QDs/MoS2 heterojunctions have been successfully synthesized and the OER performance of the heterojunctions outperform pure MoS2 and BP QDs, with lower onset potentials and Tafel slope. Meanwhile, both photo-assistance and changing KOH concentration can adjust the OER performance of BP QDs/MoS2 heterojunction. Furthermore, the as-prepared heterojunctions demonstrated strong stability in KOH aqueous solution. This work identifies that constructing BP QDs/MoS2 heterojunctions and photo-assistance are effective strategies to facilitate the electrocatalytic OER performance.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000663740100003

Herein, a facile two-step method involving Prussian blue nanocubes as template is introduced to synthesize coral-like Ni3S2@MIL-53(NiFeCo) core-shell nanowires array as an excellent OER electrocatalyst. The metal sulfides as a core in the core-shell structure could effectively adjust the morphology of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in the shell layer forming ultrathin 2D MOFs nanosheets. The synthesized Ni3S2@MIL-53 (NiFeCo)/NF nanowires exhibit excellent activity, which needs overpotential of only 236 mV to drive high current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. This excellent catalytic performance can be attributed to the following aspects: 1) The synergy between the metal sulfides and the MOF contributes substantially to the OER performance. 2) The compact three-dimensional nano-array structure increases the electrochemically active surface area of Ni3S2@MIL-53(NiFeCo)/NF nanowires; which promotes electrolyte permeation and gas overflow. 3) The tight integration of the vertically aligned nanowires structure with the conductive substrate ensures rapid electron transport and ultra-high structural stability of the electrode material. We anticipate that our research will extend the strategy for assembling advanced materials as an effective electrocatalyst for OER.									14	3	0	0	1	0	15			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000518874300077

Herein, a Fe-doped CoS2 nanoparticles supported CoS2 microspheres@N-doped carbon (Fe-CoS2/CoS2@NC) is prepared as an efficient OER electrocatalyst. The Fe-CoS2/CoS2@NC composite is derived by sulfurizing the metanilic-intercalated Co(OH)(2) microspheres decorated with binary active CoFe-Prussian blue analogue (CoFe-PBA) nanoparticles. The obtained composite combines the advantageous characteristics for enhancing electrocatalytic performances: binary active Fe-CoS2 derived from CoFe-PBA, active CoS2, N-doped carbon scaffold to improve electronic conductivity, the appropriate specific surface area and meso/macroporous size distribution to afford rich active sites. The Fe-CoS2/CoS2@NC requires an overpotential of 300 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH, outperforming those of NC/CoS2, NC/Fe-CoS2 and CoS2. Furthermore, the enhancement is experimentally supported by the low charge-transfer resistance and the large electrochemical active surface area during the OER. The synthesis approach could be extended to provide a tunable hydroxide/PBAs precursor-based approach for designing and preparing hierarchical structures as electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000724164800001

However, inadequate understanding of Co@CoOx synergy prohibits further pursuit of catalytic performance enhancement. Herein, a Co zeolitic-imidazolate framework was converted into metallic Co, followed by controlled air treatment to form Co@CoOx. The composition and structure evolution as a function of air treatment temperature were studied thoroughly through conventional and synchrotron (both ex-situ and in-situ) characterizations, confirming the coexistence of CoO and Co3O4 in the shell. The optimal catalyst showed an ORR half-wave potential of 0.87 V (vs. RHE) in an alkaline half-cell and delivered high discharge capacity in an aprotic Li-O-2 battery (7,124 mAh g(Cat+C)(-1)) and an aqueous Zn-air battery (694 mAh g(Zn)(-1)) with good performance retention after durability test. Modeling simulation and density functional theory calculation confirmed the charge donation from metal core to oxide shell and shed light on new insights of how metal@metal oxide synergy impacted the ORR via tuning the charge conductivity, oxygen affinity and intermediate transfer pathway. This work opens up a venue to boost ORR catalytic activity from an interfacial synergy perspective.									12	2	0	0	0	0	13			2196-0216			WOS:000525948800012

The principal objective of this paper is to clarify whether TEGDME is truly stable and suitable for Li-O-2 battery operation. To accomplish the objective, oxygen efficiency and by-product gas evolution during five discharge/charge cycles were determined in a real-time and quantitative manner by in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). The amide-based electrolyte dimethylacetamide (DMA), which has recently been considered a promising electrolyte for Li-O-2 cells, was also investigated and compared. The quantitative DEMS data during five cycles clearly show that DMA is more stable and exhibits better performance than TEGDME, suggesting that DMA is a more favorable electrolyte for Li-O-2 battery applications. DMA exhibits 19% greater oxygen efficiency at charge, 5.1% lower CO2 evolution, and 5% higher energy efficiency than TEGDME during the first cycle. As the discharge/charge operation process continues, the performance gap between the two electrolytes becomes wider. In particular, the gap in the oxygen efficiency at charge grows to 32% at the fifth cycle. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV)-DEMS analysis with Li2O2-deposited Li-O-2 cells demonstrates that the evolutions of O-2 and CO2 largely overlap, indicating that the oxidation of Li2O2 is inevitably accompanied by a parasitic reaction during the charge process with the TEGDME electrolyte.									26	2	0	0	2	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000374862600013

Combing both transition metal phosphides and oxides into one catalyst system can generate a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. Still, the synthesis of such a catalyst has always been very challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis of Cu3P-Cu2O Janus bifunctional catalysts into a N, P co-doped 3D hierarchically porous carbon framework (Cu3P-Cu2O/NPC). Simple carbonization of Cu2+-containing ion-exchange resins with KOH make hundred-gram scale production of this superior catalyst possible. The Janus Cu3P-Cu2O hetro-structure within a N, P-doped hierarchically porous carbon framework provides increased mass transport, enhanced electrocatalytic activity, and promoted cycling durability. As an electrocatalyst, the designed Cu3P-Cu2O/NPC delivers superior bifunctional activity for both the HER and OER in 1 M KOH, including extremely low overpotentials (138 mV for HER and 286 mV for OER) to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slopes (62.64 mV dec(-1) for HER and 79.02 mV dec(-1) for OER). More impressively, the Cu3P-Cu2O/NPC-assembled electrolyzer needs drive voltages of only approximately 1.57 and 1.81 V to achieve current densities of 10 and 50 mV cm(-2) , respectively, demonstrating a superior electrocatalytic activity compared to the state-of-the-art electrolyzer (Pt/C parallel to RuO2/C), and exhibits ultrahigh stability over a week of continuous overall water splitting reaction. This work highlights the significance of nanoengineering on the production of highly efficient electrocatalysts and provides a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for future industrial implementation.									26	0	0	0	2	0	26			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729805000002

In the present paper I describe recent experiments allowing the discrimination between photosynthetic water splitting and the light induced peroxide decomposition, the latter showing a strong dependence on the oxygen partial pressure in the suspension. Under appropriate conditions a clear period-2 oscillation of a flash sequence is observed. This fits into the interpretation, as the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide requires only two light quanta and S-2 has been shown to be the most reactive redox state within the S-state system. Comparison of the relaxation kinetics of the first two flashes of a sequence with the steady state signals as well as the detailed analysis of the mass spectrometric signals revealed completely different time constants for both water splitting and peroxide decomposition. These observations can be correlated to the suggestion that a peroxide might be involved in the higher oxidation states (Renger, G. (1987) Photosynthetica 21, 203-224). Moreover, the phenomena can be specifically and independently influenced and stimulated e.g. by the addition of various salts which strongly increases the water splitting reaction. In the present discussion on the participation of hydrogen peroxide the reaction sequences described for Oscillatoria in this and in previous papers might be the linking condition between oxygenic photosynthesis and the type of anoxygenic photooxidations such as the photooxidation of ferrous or sulfide ions which prevailed earlier. From the evolutionary point of view these two mechanisms might have been linked by the involvement of a quasi semireduced component like hydrogen peroxide.									25	1	1	0	22	0	27			0005-2728	0006-3002		WOS:A1994QG26500003

Here this work introduces hierarchical heterostructures into a NiMo@NiS/MoS2@Ni3S2/MoOx (NiMoS) composite by one-pot controlled moderative sulfidation. The optimal solvent composition and addition of NaOH enable NiMoS to own loose and porous structures, smaller nanoparticle sizes, optimal phase composition and chemical states of elements, improving the OER activity of NiMoS. To achieve current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2), small overpotentials of 275 and 306 mV are required respectively, together with a minor Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1), which outperforms most reported sulfide catalysts and IrO2. The synergistic effects in the hierarchical heterostructures expose more active sites, adjust the electronic band structure, and enable the fast charge transfer kinetics, which construct an optimized local coordination environment for high OER electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the hierarchical heterostructures suppress the distinct lowering of electrical conductivity and collapse of pristine structures resulted from the metal oxidation and synchronous S leaching during OER, yielding competitive catalytic stability.

In this paper, a nano-composite of Cu2Se@CoSe was synthesized using a colloidal method. This synthetic approach was capable for the synthesis of Cu2Se, CoSe and Cu2Se@CoSe. The nano-composite of Cu2Se@CoSe exhibited electrocatalytic OER activity, with low overpotential of 251 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 320 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), and even beat the RuO2 at high current density (i.e.> 80 mA cm(-2)). Long-term electrolysis test revealed the chemical and electrochemical stability over 20 h at high current density (150 mA cm(-2)). Furthermore, post-electrolysis experimental analyses indicated that CoOOH/Cu(OH)(2) on Cu2Se@CoSe played an important role in OER electrocatalysis, and they were readily oxidized from Cu in Cu2Se and Co2+ in CoSe before the onset potential of OH- oxidation. The CoOOH/Cu(OH)(2) served as both catalytic material and protective layer of Cu2Se@CoSe, thus leading to enhanced OER catalytic activity and stability. It is believed that Cu2Se@CoSe can be a potential candidate for fabricating sustainable OER electrocatalytic electrode. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	WILKINSON, M; CROWLEY, SF; MARSHALL, JD				Marshall, Jim/AAP-1726-2020				MODEL FOR THE EVOLUTION OF OXYGEN ISOTOPE RATIOS IN THE PORE FLUIDS OF MUDROCKS DURING BURIAL								MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY				9	1			98	105		10.1016/0264-8172(92)90007-2				FEB 1992	1992	The determination of oxygen isotopic ratios in authigenic silicates and pore fluids provides vital information on the nature of water- rock interactions in the subsurface and the origin of porosity-occluding phases in reservoir rocks. The delta-O-18 values of pore fluids generally increase during burial through water-rock interaction. The transformation of detrital smectite to illite is thought to have a major influence on the isotopic evolution of pore fluids, but previous attempts to model this effect have failed to accurately reproduce the observed water-rock isotopic trends with depth. A revised model has been developed which incorporates an empirical rate equation for the illitization reaction. The input variables include the initial mineral and pore water isotopic compositions, time-porosity-depth functions and geothermal histories, and the assumption is made that the isotopic equilibration of the solid phases with pore waters only takes place during reaction. The model is tested against the most complete data set available from the Texas Gulf Coast (USA) and produces a good fit with the available pore fluid and mineral data. The sensitivity of the model is tested for variations in the following parameters: the illite-water fractionation factor; the fractionation of oxygen isotopes between the smectitic and illitic components of the detrital illite-smectite; the oxygen isotope fractionation between pore waters and the interlayer water within the smectite; and the porosity-depth function. The results of the model are shown to be strongly dependent on the porosity-depth function. The best fit between the model and real data is provided by the Dickinson equation for undercompacted shale modified to have a constant porosity below 2600 m to simulate the effects of overpressuring. The model is also sensitive to the degree of oxygen isotopic fractionation between the illite and smectite within the sediment at the time of burial, but not to the extent of fractionation between interlayer water within smectite and the adjacent pore waters. The uncertainty within the illite-water fractionation factor has only a minor effect on the results of the model. Although only incorporating a single mechanism for water-rock interaction, the model provides a tool for testing the interpretations of subsurface pore fluid evolution trends during sediment diagenesis.									38	2	0	0	1	0	39			0264-8172			WOS:A1992HA98500006

In this study, an integrated electrode with vertically aligned ionomer-incorporated nickel-iron layered double hydroxide nanosheet arrays, used on one side of the liquid/gas diffusion layer, is fabricated for the OER. Transport highways in the fabricated integrated electrode, significantly improve the transport of liquid/gas, hydroxide ions, and electron in the anode, resulting in a high current density of 1900 mA cm(-2) at 1.90 V in pure-water-fed AEMWE.

Platinum is the most efficient catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but its mass activity should be boosted further. Herein, we deposited platinum on nitrogen-doped vertical graphene through an atomic layer deposition method. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the platinum was highly dispersed on the array substrate. On account of the array structure and high dispersion of platinum, the synthesized catalyst exhibited high HER performance with a low overpotential of 42 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 52.2 mV dec(-1). Significantly, the synthesized catalyst exhibited a high mass activity of 4.45 A mg(-1) (Pt), which was similar to 13 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2053-1583			WOS:000829573200001

This work demonstrates the cerium carbonate hydroxide (CeCO3OH) in situ grown on nickel foam (NF) supported NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) as a novel promoter in OER process. The hybrid material (Ni0.75Fe0.15Ce0.10/NF) possesses excellent performance for OER where the overpotentials at the current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2) are 228 mV and 270 mV, respectively, along with the Tafel slope of 38.3 mV dec(-1). Such performance is comparable in activity to many state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. The enhanced performance in the NiFe LDH can be ascribed to the synergetic interaction between CeCO3OH and NiFe LDH by utilizing the advantages of cerium and carbonate in OER. The novelty of our work is the exploration of CeCO3OH as a promoter to enhance the OER performance, which expands the application of cerium-based compounds in energy storage and conversion.

We compared the electrochemical properties of the 2D-NC Fe2Ni2N/rGO NHSs as non-precious-metal nitride and graphene nanohybrid electrocatalysts for an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with those of NiFe-based composition. The overpotential and Tafel plot of the 2D-NC Fe2Ni2N/rGO NHSs had their lowest values of 290 and 49.1 mV dec(-1), respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (0.1 M, KOH). The 2D-NC Fe2Ni2N/rGO NHS catalyst was stable under OER conditions, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed the stability of the catalysts after electrochemical testing (24 h). The synergistic interactions between the transition-metal nitride and graphene represent unique 2D nanostructured, metallic properties, and graphene sheets with nanocrystalline Fe2Ni2N on them are significantly more efficient and active electrocatalysts. The presented strategy of transition-metal nitride/graphene hybrid nanostructures provides potential for more efficient and outstanding OER electrocatalysts.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2574-0962			WOS:000504953500020

Here, a volcano-shaped correlation between the OER activity and the Cr substitution amount was found for spinel oxides ZnFe2-xCrxO4 (x = 0-2), in which Zn2+ resides in tetrahedral (Td) sites while Fe3+ and Cr3+ occupy octahedral (Oh) sites. Such a relationship probably is because Cr substitution tunes the e(g) occupancy of Oh-site transition metals (TMoh) via the Oh-Oh superexchange effect. Density functional calculations further revealed the hybridization degree between the TMoh 3d and the O 2p states, and a volcano-shaped trend was also found in the variation of TMoh 3d-O 2p hybridization with the amount of Cr substitution. The good correlation between the OER activity and the hybridization highlights the important role of metal-oxygen hybridization in determining the OER activity of these spinel oxides.									39	3	1	0	0	0	40			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000447237800027

However, sluggish kinetics of water dissociation in alkaline electrolyte impedes the formation of reactive intermediates by discharge of water. Here, oxygen-incorporated NiMoP2 nanowire arrays are engineered on Ni foam substrate (denoted as ONiMoP2/Ni) by controllable partial phosphorization of metal oxide precursors to boost HER activity under alkaline environment. The incorporation of oxygen can significantly modify the electronic structure of NiMoP2 and optimize both HER Gibbs free-energy change (Delta GH.) and water adsorption energy change (AGH20.). Results demonstrate that the O-NiMoP2/Ni nanowire arrays require quite low HER overpotentials of 31 and 134 mV to drive the geometrical catalytic current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. The activity and stability in 1 M KOH are also superior to those of the state-of-the-art transition-metal phosphides (TMPs).									23	3	0	0	0	0	25			2574-0962			WOS:000458706600042

Herein, we demonstrate CoO nanoparticles anchored on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (CoO/N-rGO) with an excellent bifunctional catalytic activity and stability and facile redox kinetics of ORR and OER for high-performance rechargeable ZABs. The CoO/N-rGO catalysts are featured with the abundant active sites, a large accessible area, and high electrochemical conductivity, which are associated with increased oxygen vacancy surface, reduced valence, and mesoporous architecture. The half-wave potential (E-1/2) and electron transfer number for ORR are 0.79 V and 3.72 at 0.40 V (vs RHE), respectively, while OER potential at 10 mA cm(-2) (E-j = 10) is 1.61 V (vs RHE). Remarkably, the ZAB cell with CoO/N-rGO achieves high specific capacity of 545 mAh g(zn)(-1), power density of 41 mW cm(-2), and cyclic stabilities with high energy efficiency of 64.44% at 2 mA cm(-2). In addition, postmortem analysis validates that the oxidation and aggregation of CoO/N-rGO catalyst is mitigated while the inactivation of Zn anode is inhibited.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000595042600001

Herein, we prepared an unique wheat-like porous carbon nanofibers embedded with Co nanoparticles as a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for ORR and OER, which was obtained by carbonizing the zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-Co and polyacrylonitrile electrospun nanofibers. The unique wheat-like porous structure not only provides a large specific surface area for the catalyst, but also facilitates the transport of electrolyte and oxygen during the electrocatalytic process, improving its catalytic activity. Meanwhile, the unique wheat-like structure with metal nanoparticles wrapped into the carbon nanofibers can avoid corrosion caused by alkaline electrolyte. The bifunctional catalyst displays excellent electrocatalytic performance for OER with a positive overpotential of 440 mV at 10 mA-cm(-2) and ORR with a positive half-wave potential of 825 mV. Furthermore, the maximum power density of the assembled ZABs with catalyst Co@N-PCNF-1.0 serving as the air electrode is 118.41 mW.cm(-2), and this ZABs are able to cycle 200 h in galvanostatic discharge test. This work can offer some interesting design concepts for the construction of outstanding bifunctional catalysts toward rechargeable Zn-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000780226800005

A range of metalloenzymes achieve these challenging tasks in biology by activating water and dioxygen using cheap and abundant transition metals, such as iron, copper, and manganese. High-valent metal-oxo/oxyl, metal-superoxo, and/or metal-(hydro)peroxo species are common reactive intermediates that are found in the O-O bond formation and activation reactions. The transient nature of the metal-oxygen intermediates has, however, prevented their isolation and characterization in most cases. As a consequence, unambiguous mechanistic assignments in the O-O bond formation and cleavage processes in biological and chemical entries remain elusive, especially for the intermediates and mechanisms involved in the O-O bond formation reactions. This viewpoint article aims at summarizing the information obtained to date in enzymatic and biomimetic systems that fuels the debate regarding the nature of the active oxidants and the mechanistic uncertainties associated with the transition metal-mediated O-O bond formation and cleavage reactions.									51	8	0	0	4	0	52			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000644663800002	33657202

Process economization is mostly affected due to larger consumption of precious iridium as an anodic catalyst. Therefore, effective utilization of noble metal remains a major challenge to be overwhelmed. Comprehensive theoretical and experimental studies show electronic dependency on different structural motifs of IrOx. However, due to lack of suitable non-noble host structures for iridium substitution there is hindrance in implementation. In current study, we explored inverse spinel, nickel cobaltite, as a host structure that provides OER beneficial structural motif to iridium sites on account of relatively higher IrO6 edge sharing than in rutile IrO2. Compact presence of octahedras in host structure reduces Ir-Ir bond length for neighboring IrO6 octahedral units in it that further intrinsically improves the iridium sites due to electronic modulations. Specifically, composite comprising 20 mol% iridium in NiCo2-xO4 rendered acid stable 15 folds enhancement in mass specific OER activity relative to IrO2 resulting in substantial reduction of iridium content. Fabricated composite displayed an onset potential and tafel slope of 1.425 V and 40.4 mV dec(-1), respectively in relative to 1.475 V and 68.1 mV dec(-1) for pure IrO2. Current approach for effectively utilizing precious metal will lead in future for economizing hydrogen production via water splitting.									73	3	0	0	3	0	73			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600030

Transmission electron microscopy confirms the high dispersion of ultrafine IrO2 particles with an average particle size of 1.47 nm. The IrO2/KB electrode exhibits remarkable catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as indicated by the voltammetric measurements. And, the IrO2/KB electrode decreases the recharge overpotential by ca. 400 and 200 mV compared to the electrodes with pure KB and a mechanical mixture of KB and pre-synthesized IrO2, respectively. Li-O-2 battery with IrO2/KB achieves high-capacity retention and stable cyclability, maintaining a long cycle life for 70 cycles without sharp decay under a limited discharge-charge depth of 500 mAh g(-1) (ca. 1100 mAh g(C) (-1)). X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope analysis reveal that this excellent rechargeability is based on the reversible formation and decomposition of toroid-shaped lithium peroxide. Therefore, the uniform distribution of ultrafine IrO2 particles, with extraordinary OER catalytic activity, on KB carbon enables the IrO2/KB to be a promising electrocatalyst for Li-O-2 batteries.									15	1	0	0	2	0	15			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000350481600021

Herein, NiO nanosheets engineered by oxygen vacancy growing vertically on carbon clothes (NiO-Vo@CC) was developed as viable catalyst for both CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and CO2 evolution reaction (CO2ER) in Li- CO2 system. The oxygen vacancy decorated by surplus electron will not only work as electron donor (Lewis base) surface to activated the electron-deficient carbon atom in CO2 but also narrow the band gap of NiO, therefore optimized CO2 conversion kinetic can be obtained by using defective NiO-Vo@CC electrode. The utilization of defect engineering to achieve performance improvement in aprotic Li-CO2 battery is still in its infancy at current stage and thus our research initially corroborates that modulation of the surface property via defect engineering can serve as valid strategy to design high performance electrodes for Li-CO2 battery.

So, the fabrication of the 3D-graphene nanocomposite is promising for advanced energy production and storage application. The structure of the 3D-graphene nanocomposite was characterized by various techniques. Then, 3D-graphene was decorated with Pd nanoparticles. Morphological characterization shows the porous structure of 3D-Pd/rGO, so it has a high electroactive surface area. The function of the electrocatalyst toward the supercapacitor, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were investigated. The obtained results as a supercapacitor displayed that the supercapacitor on 3D-Pd/rGO has a high specific capacitance of 582.0 F g(-1), the high energy density of 180 (W h Kg(-1)), high power density of 3750 (W Kg(-1)), long potential window of 1.00 V and long life. The electrocatalyst shows the small onset potential of -0.08 V (us. RHE), Tafel slope of 29 mV dec(-1) and high durability. Also, in the electro analytical application of the nanocompound as an electrocatalyst for ORR shows an excellent onset potential of 0.90 V (us.

However, the catalytic activity effected by interlayer water molecules is ignored and rarely reported. Herein, Ni(OH)(2), NiFe LDHs vertically aligned Ni foam are designed for OER. As a contrast, the corresponding electrocatalysts with the removal of the interlayer water molecules (Ni(OH)(2)-AT, NiFe LDHs-AT) are developed to probe into the influence of the interlayer water molecules towards OER. As expected, NiFe LDH nanoplates exhibit excellent catalytic performance and durability for water electrolysis in alkaline conditions with lower overpotential and smaller Tafel slope compared to those of NiFe LDHs-AT, which are influenced mainly by stability of crystal structure due to the existence of interlayer water molecules. The discovery opens up a similar pathway by controlling the amount of water molecules to boost catalytic performance for studying other electrocatalysts with heteroatom dopant.

However, corrosive issues in the alkaline environment impede its applications. Here, we explore the corrosion-resistant multiphase Ni3Al-based intermetallic alloy (Ni3Al alloy) as self-supported OER catalysts for the first time. A two-step treatment, annealing at high-temperature followed by acid oxidation is performed to improve the catalytic activity. Further investigations demonstrate that the annealing process can tune the size of gamma' precipitates, which will modify the strain effects caused by gamma/gamma' lattice mismatch to boost the OER activity. The oxidation of Ni during the acid pretreatment can facilitate the formation of active high-valent Ni sites during the OER process, and further enhance the OER performance. The optimized electrode exhibits a low overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 73.5 mV dec(-1) and long-term stability of 180 h in 1 M KOH solution. The findings in this paper will inspire the exploration of high stability OER catalysts and the functional application of Ni3Al alloy. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, ZIF-derived Co9S8/C coated with conductive graphene nanosheet (Co9S8/GN) was synthesized by a simple solvothermal method and formed a stable double-carbon structure. As expected, the prepared Co9S8/GN catalyst exhibits a high catalytic activity (Delta E: 0.88 V) and long-term durability toward both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR and OER), which is even superior to the Pt/C + Ir/C mixture (0.91 V). In addition, the Zn-air battery with the Co9S8/GN catalyst showed higher power density (186 mW cm(-2)) and more stable charge-discharge cycling performances (2000 cycles) than the Pt/C + Ir/C (118 mW cm(-2)). Based on these analysis results, the favorable catalytic performance of ORR/OER should be illustrated by the following reasons: (i) large specific surface area and unique mesoporous structure, providing abundant active sites; (ii) good conductivity, accelerating the electrons transfer; and (iii) the unique stable "double-carbon" structures (metal-S-C-C), preventing the agglomeration of metal sulfide, building new quick transfer pathway, and forming the strong electron coupling ability and synergistic effect.									22	2	0	0	1	0	23			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000566662000040	32805974

Herein, we report the growth of undoped and Cr-doped NiCo2O4(Cr-NiCo2O4) nanoneedles (NNs) on nickel foam (NF) as bifunctional electrocatalysts for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We demonstrate that Cr-doping significantly improves activity for HER and OER by increasing the conductivity of NNs and allowing more active sites on NNs electrochemically accessible. When amorphous FeOOH is electrodeposited on the surface of Cr-NiCo(2)O(4)NNs, the resulting FeOOH/Cr-NiCo2O4/NF exhibits itself as an excellent bifunctional catalyst for OWS. In the two-electrode cell where FeOOH/Cr-NiCo2O4/NF is used both as cathode and anode for OWS, a cell voltage of only 1.65 V is required to achieve an electrolysis current density of 100 mA center dot cm(-2). In addition, the catalyst shows a very high stability for OWS, the two-electrode cell can operate at a consist current density of 20 mA center dot cm(-2)for 10 h OWS with the cell voltage being stable at ca. 1.60 V. These results demonstrate that FeOOH/Cr-NiCo2O4/NF possesses an OWS performance superior to most of transition-metal based bifunctional electrocatalysts working in alkaline medium. The excellent bifunctional activity and stability of FeOOH/Cr-NiCo2O4/NF are attributed to the following reasons: (i) The NN structure provides a large specific surface area; (ii) the high conductivity of Cr-NiCo(2)O(4)enables more active centers on the far-end part of NNs to be electrochemically reached; (iii) the deposition of FeOOH supplies additional active sites for OWS.									46	6	0	0	2	0	47			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000560402100002

Immediately after treatment, observation of CO2 evolution and O-2 consumption were performed. Significant quantities of CO2 were released during reaction of chromium (K2Cr2O7) containing solutions with wood or brown rotted wood. Nevertheless, during reaction of cellulose with these preservatives we did not observe evolution of CO2. The presence of copper did not influence on concentration of CO2. Opposite to CO2 evolution, treatment of wood and brown rotted wood resulted in O-2 consumption. The oxygen concentration decrease in the measuring chamber was approximately 5 times greater than increase of concentration of carbon dioxide. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) observations of chromium fixation showed that chromium is reduced from Cr(VI) to Cr(III) with Cr(V) as an intermediate on wood, brown rotted wood and cellulose. However, the reduction on wood and brown rotted wood was faster than the reduction on cellulose, as determined from changes of Cr signals in EPR spectra. So, evolution of CO2 and consumption of O-2 as well as EPR signals of Cr species thus indicate that brown rotted wood, consisting of lignin and hemicelluloses in contact with Cr(VI) reacts more intensively than cellulose, and possibly, oxidation mechanisms of lignin and cellulose with Cr(VI) are different.									9	0	0	0	5	0	9			0043-7719			WOS:000177614600002

IrO2 is the best-known catalyst in acid medium due to its good activity and stability, but its too expensive to be used in large amounts. To overcome this economical constraint, the use of low amount of iridium electrocatalyst is required. Recently, ruthenium pyrochlore oxides (A(2)Ru(2)O(7)-delta) as OER catalysts have drawn extensive interests due to reduced content of precious metal relative to RuO2 or IrO2, though their OER catalytic activity still needs to be further improved. In this work, we, for the first time, developed a highly active and stable Y1.85Zn0.15Ru2O7-delta electrocatalyst, the A site doped yttrium ruthenate pyrochlore for OER. The mechanism of A site doped ruthenate pyrochlore improving OER performance is revealed. The partial substitution of Y3+ ions by smaller Zn2+ leads to a formation of oxygen vacancies and mixed valences of Ru (Ru4+ and Ru5+), which, in turn, significantly alter the electronic properties and thus the electrocatalytic activity and electrical conductivity of the developed electrocatalyst for OER. The Y1.85Zn0.15Ru2O7-delta/acetylene black (AB) electrocatalyst exhibits sevenfold higher activity than the IrO2/AB reference catalyst; twofold higher activity than Y2Ru2O7-delta/AB, with a Tafel slope of 36.9 mV dec(-1); and higher stability than IrO2/AB in acidic media. Using a home-made proton exchange membrane electrolyser device, a high cell performance is achieved at 25 degrees C with an electrolysis current density of 0.46 A cm(-2), confirming a promising prospect of Y1.85Zn0.15Ru2O7-delta electrocatalyst for practical water electrolysis applications.									72	3	0	0	4	0	73			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600050		
J	Yang, Huan; Gao, Shuai; Rao, Dewei; Yan, Xiaohong								Designing superior bifunctional electrocatalyst with high-purity pyrrole-type CoN4 and adjacent metallic cobalt sites for rechargeable Zn-air batteries								ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS				46				553	562		10.1016/j.ensm.2022.01.040				APR 2022	2022	Developing cost-effective and high-efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for rechargeable Zn-air battery application. However, achieving high-active dual sites for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis in a single catalyst, as well as determining the decisive active sites for OER and ORR to explore the synergistically catalytic mechanism remain challenges. Herein, we propose a catalyst consisting of high-purity pyrrole nitrogen anchored cobalt single-atom (CoN4) and adjacent metallic cobalt sites (Co-p @CoNC) for explicit research of dominated active sites. The obtained Co-p @CoNC exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity with a small overpotential difference of 0.68 V between OER potential at 10 mA cm- 2 and ORR half-wave potential, outperforming commercial noble-metal based catalysts. Electrochemical measurements and theoretical simulations verify the pyrrole-type CoN4 and adjacent metallic cobalt are separately decisive active sites for ORR and OER activities. Simultaneously, metallic cobalt regulates electron distribution of CoN4 moiety to improve ORR activity. Importantly, the rechargeable liquid and flexible solidstate Zn-air batteries using Cop @CoNC as air electrode catalysts possess high peak power densities of 188.8 and 121.8 mW cm(-2), respectively. Our findings provide a feasible strategy to design high-performance multifunctional catalysts for rechargeable Zn-air batteries application.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2405-8297			WOS:000783315600007

Herein, a facile design is developed for one-pot fabrication of Co2P nanoparticles encapsulated into doped carbon nanotubes (Co2P@NPCNTs) by a self-catalyzed growth strategy. Notably, this methodology can avoid not only the use of organic solvents and toxic alkyl phosphines, but also the requirement of complicated operations, sophisticated instruments and costly precursors. More importantly, the unique encapsulation structure between the NPCNTs and Co2P nanoparticles can endow the hybrids with fast electronic transport and favorable stability for both the ORR and OER. The obtained catalysts show low Tafel slopes (49.8 mV dec(-1) for the ORR and 62.4 mV dec(-1) for the OER) and considerable bifunctional catalytic performance. Impressively, as the air-cathode catalysts for zinc-air batteries, the Co2P@NPCNTs also show excellent open-circuit voltage, good charge-discharge performance and stability. Overall, an efficient and scalable method together with good catalytic performance endows the Co2P@NPCNT catalysts with enormous potential for large-scale electrochemical energy applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				1466-8033		WOS:000613496600025

The capability of a real-time characterization of the charge/discharge electrochemical pathways and the reactivity of the electrolyte is critical to decipher the underlying chemistries and improve the battery performance. Yet, adapting operando techniques for new chemistries such as metal-oxygen (i.e. metal-air) batteries introduces challenges in the cell design due notably to the requirements of an oxygen gas supply at the cathode. Herein a simple operando cell is presented with a two-compartment cylindrical cell design for NMR spectroscopy. The design is discussed and evaluated. Operando Li-7 static NMR characterization on a Li-O-2 battery was performed as a proof-of-concept. The productions of Li2O2, mossy Li/Li dendrites and other irreversible parasitic lithium compounds were captured in the charge/discharge processes, demonstrating the capability of tracking the evolution of the anodic and cathodic chemistry in metal-oxygen batteries.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0926-2040	1527-3326		WOS:000654029000003	33823328

Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of porous perovskite nanostructures, LaCo0.97O3-delta, with systematic Ni substitution in Co octahedral sites. Their electrocatalytic activity during the water oxidation reaction was studied in alkaline electrolytes. The electrocatalytic OER activity and stability of the perovskite nanostructure was evaluated using the rotating disk electrode technique. We show that the progressive replacement of Co by Ni in the LaCo0.97O3-delta perovskite structure greatly altered the electrocatalytic activity and that the La(Co0.71Ni0.25)(0.96)O3-delta composition exhibited the lowest OER overpotential of 324 and 265 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH and 1 M KOH, respectively. This value was much lower than that of the noble metal catalysts, IrO2, Ru/C, and Pt/C. Furthermore, the La(Co0.71Ni0.25)(0.96)O3-delta nanostructure showed outstanding electrode stability, with no observable decrease in performance up to 114th cycle in the auxiliary linear sweep voltammetry that lasted for 10 h in chronoamperometry studies. The excellent oxygen evolution activity of the La(Co0.71Ni0.25)(0.96)O3-delta perovskite nanostructure can be attributed to its intrinsic structure, interconnected particle arrangement, and unique redox characteristics. The enhanced intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of the La(Co0.71Ni0.25)(0.96)O3-delta catalyst was correlated with several parameters, such as the electrochemical surface area, the roughness factor, and the turnover frequency, with respect to variation in the transition metals of the perovskite structure. Subsequently, La(Co0.71Ni0.25)(0.96)O3-delta was utilized as the air cathode in a zincair battery application.									83	3	0	0	4	0	86			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000371945700031	26887571

The obtained results are then closely compared with its analogue Sr0.9Y0.1CoO3-delta (SYC10) of different crystal structures to establish structure-activity relationships. The comparison shows that both SYC30 and SYC10 consist of alternate layers of oxygen-deficient Co1-polyhedra and oxygen-saturated Co-2-octahedra with Co1-polyhedra being responsible for V-o(center dot center dot) migration. It is also found that the distribution and concentration of oxygen vacancies within the Co1-layer are, respectively, less symmetrical and lower in SYC30 than those in SYC10, making the former unfavorable for oxygen transport. A molecular orbital energy analysis reveals that the energy gap between Fermi level and O 2p level in the active Co1-polyhedra is larger in SYC30 than that in SYC10, further suggesting that SYC10 is a better oxide-ion conductor and thus a better electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction, which is unambiguously confirmed by the subsequent electrochemical measurements.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000448754500033	30251821

Herein, we present the synthesis of non-precious bimetallic Ni1-xFex-layered hydroxide nanosheet films by using a chemical-bath deposition technique for use as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for electrochemical water electrolysis. Remarkably, the optimized Ni0.50Fe0.50-layered hydroxide electrode exhibited excellent OER activity in 1 M potassium hydroxide electrolyte while having a low overpotential of 239.7 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 38.02 mV dec(-1). It was electrochemically stable over 100 hours of continuous OER operation, thereby showing its excellent electrochemical stability. The results from a post-OER study reveal that catalytically active OER sites are associated with the formation of a nickel oxyhydroxide intermediate on the surface of the electrode. The maximum synergy among good electronic conductivity, high diffusion coefficient, and enlarged electrochemically active sites was obtained by optimizing the Ni/Fe ratio and thereby, the OER activity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000658035400001

Remarkably, this catalyst also shows strong long-term electrochemical durability with the preservation of its catalytic activity for at least 85 h. Density functional theory calculations suggest that P doping brings the optimization of hydrogen adsorption free energy to a more thermo-neutral value.									176	7	0	0	7	0	176			2168-0485			WOS:000429285800008

Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)											10.1039/d2dt02729a				2022-Nov-01	2022	Developing efficient, environmentally friendly and cost-effective non-precious metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential to alleviate the energy crisis and environmental pollution. Herein, we report a simple and practical method to prepare non-precious metal catalysts, namely iron-modulated Ni3S2 (Fe-Ni3S2/NF) on nickel foam, by growing a Ni-MOF directly on 3D porous conductive nickel foam, followed by the formation of Ni-MOF-based Prussian blue analogs (Ni-MOF@PBA) via in situ cation exchange reactions, which are further sulfidated to iron-modulated Ni3S2. Based on a series of characterization results, it is confirmed that iron acts as a modulator at the Ni active site, leading to electron depletion, thereby modulating the electron spin state and optimizing the binding energy of key reaction intermediates, resulting in highly exposed active sites and acceleration of OER reaction kinetics. The synthesized Fe-Ni3S2/NF exhibits excellent activity in alkaline media, which needs overpotentials of only 232 mV and 287 mV to drive current densities of 10 mA cm-2 and 50 mA cm-2, respectively. Additionally, Fe-Ni3S2/NF exhibits excellent stability for at least 24 h during the OER process. This work presents a rational design and synthesis of transition metal-based catalysts with nanocone structures, providing a new strategy for assembling advanced materials and insights for exploring various energy storage and conversion systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1477-9234		MEDLINE:36317563	36317563

The microstructure was analyzed by FESEM and EDX, and the electrochemical properties were investigated by electrochemical testing including cyclic voltammetry (CV), anode polarization curves, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results indicate that the Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5-G anodes possess rugged surface morphology with tiny cracks, offering more active centers for oxygen evolution reaction and have larger electrochemically active surface area and better electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution, compared with the traditional Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5 anode. The Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5-G anode with 0.4 g.L-1 graphene content presents the best electrochemical performance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1002-185X			WOS:000375490600024

The addition of rhodium to the coating leads to both an overall improved stability of the electrode, and an increase of the electrochemically active surface area. The service-life of a Rh-Ru coating polarized at 0.12 A cm(-2) in 0.5 mol dm(-3) sulphuric acid is improved by at least two orders of magnitude, while deterioration of the electroactive surface area never exceeds 30%. The rotating ring-disc electrode measurements show the dissolution of the coating at potentials above the onset of the oxygen evolution reaction at 1.1 V versus SCE.

To achieve high-performance and low-cost OER electrocatalysts, great effort has been devoted to the development of noble-metal-free OER nanocatalysts. While nanostructured materials have been shown effective at improving the catalytic activity, the stability of the nanocatalyst has yet to be significantly improved. Furthermore, nanocatalyst syntheses are typically complex, limiting their practical application. Herein, we design a noble-metalfree nanocatalyst which has a CoFePx core and an in situ Fe coating layer to enhance the materials catalytic activity and durability for OER. We utilize the vapor pressure difference of Fe and Co at high temperature to synthesize the CoFePx-Fe core-shell nanoparticles via a one-step high-temperature shock technique. The high-temperature method strongly anchors the CoFePx nanoparticles onto a carbon substrate. The thin Fe shell layer (similar to 2 nm) coated on the CoFePx greatly enhances the durability of the CoFePx, catalyst without hampering its activity due to the geometric effect. This nanocatalyst with an in situ Fe shell demonstrates a successful nanocoating approach for fabricating catalytically active protection layers on catalysts with improved activity and durability.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000480422400051

However, the bulk layers and congested interlayers block the active sites and avoid the electrolyte access to the internal space. In this work, we report a simple coprecipitation coupled with the hydrothermal method for the direct growth of bimetallic NiCo-LDHs (5.01 nm), NiMn-LDHs (3.45 nm) and trimetallic NiCo-Mn-LDHs nanosheets (1.26 nm) on Ni foam and these fabricated electrodes exhibit the superior performance for OER. Notably, the NiCoMn-LDHs nanosheets exhibit the lowest overpotential of 290 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) and the smallest Tafel slope of 87 mV dec(-1), reducing by 20-40 mV and 31-39 mV dec(-1) in comparison with those of bimetallic NiCo-LDHs (310 mV, 118 mV dec(-1)) and NiMn-LDHs (330 mV, 126 mV dec(-1)). This excellent performance is attributed to the 2D structure of the nanosheets and an abundance of exposed active sites, especially oxygen vacancies. Additionally, NiCoMn-LDHs nanosheets exhibit the smallest charge transfer resistance (R-ct) of 6.3 Omega and the largest electrochemical double layer capacitance (C-dl) of 5.52 mF cm(-2) than those of the bimetallic NiCo-LDHs (11.0 Omega, 4.85 mF cm(-2)) and NiMn-LDHs (30.6 Omega, 3.00 mF cm(-2)). Furthermore, NiCoMn-LDHs nanosheets maintain good durability over 10 h and cyclic stability without distinct change. This work offers a facile strategy to design various types of bimetallic and trimetallic LDHs boosting for OER process. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Through its conversion, it is possible to obtain carbon-based molecules with a high economic value. Commonly, the oxidation reaction coupled to CO2 reduction is the oxygen evolution from water, which guarantees the flow of electrons and protons needed to the CO2 conversion. However, the oxygen evolution reaction has many disadvantages such as the negligible economic value of dioxygen and the high energetic requirements of the catalytic process. Few solutions to this issue have been proposed until now. The present review aims to analyze them, showing the impact of tandem reactions on the entire system. A detailed analysis of the oxidation processes is carried out with a particular focus on the catalysts employed and on the possibility of improving their performance, basing the discussion on the present literature. Future perspectives are here proposed, even looking at a more sustainable power generation for the electro-catalytic systems, since we believe this road will lead to a second generation of tandem catalytic reactions with high added-value products and a great impact in both economy and science.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2212-9820	2212-9839		WOS:000701902900003

In such a case, to display good performances they should possess electrical conductivity which can be ensured by the presence of metals able to give reversible redox reactions in a proper potential window. The metal centers can act as redox mediators to catalyze reactions for which the required overpotential is too high, and this is a key aspect for the development of processes and devices where the control of charge transfer reactions plays an important role. In order to act as redox mediator, a material can be present in solution or supported on a conductive support. The most commonly used methods to synthesize LDHs, referring both to bulk synthesis and in situ growth methods, which allow for the direct modification of conductive supports, are here summarized. In addition, the most widely used techniques to characterize the LDHs structure and morphology are also reported, since their electrochemical performance is strictly related to these features. Finally, some electrocatalytic applications of LDHs, when synthesized as nanomaterials, are discussed considering those related to sensing, oxygen evolution reaction, and other energy issues.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7				2079-4991		WOS:000633995000001	33805722

In this work, we developed self-supported Zn-incorporated mesoporous cobalt phosphide nanowire arrays (Zn-Co-P) on Ni foam as an efficient HER electrocatalyst. Electrochemical tests show that the HER catalytic activity of Zn-Co-P has been improved by Zn incorporation and the measured overpotentials are 167 and 172 mV at a geometric catalytic current density of 100 mA.cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Further characterizations reveal that the mesopores exposed on the surface induced by Zn incorporation play a key role in the enhanced HER performance of Zn-Co-P by providing more active sites. Moreover, Zn incorporation can promote the formation of a CoP phase, which is also beneficial to the overall catalytic activity.									17	2	0	0	0	0	18			2574-0970			WOS:000488423900065

Herein, we design and synthesize a novel ZnS-ZnO heterostructure sheets by combining solid-state Z-scheme for photocatalytic O-2 and H-2 evolution. Electron spin resonance result confirms that a solid-state Z-scheme is successfully introduced into the ZnS-ZnO heterostructure. Thanks to the rapid separation and migration of photoinduced electron/hole according to the Z-scheme mechanism, ZnS-ZnO heterostructure exhibits efficient H-2 evolution without using any sacrificial agent, far beyond the comparative values reported by currently ZnS/ZnO-based photocatalysts. Especially, the as-synthesized photocatalyst presents the ability of O-2 evolution for pure water splitting using Pt as cocatalyst, which is too difficult to be realized for previously reported ZnO/ZnS-based photocatalysts. Therefore, this work presents a new idea to design other semiconductor photocatalysts for simultaneous H-2 and O-2 evolution.									43	2	0	0	1	0	43			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000507465200012

In this study, LAGP is prepared by a sol-gel process using comparatively low-cost GeCl2 as one of the reactants. The final product (LAGP) is obtained by sintering the dry precursor gel at 900 degrees C for 6 h. The influence of the duration of water evaporation during polymerization on the microstructure of LAGP has been examined. The structure, morphology, and electrochemical properties of LAGP are investigated by employing X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. XRD studies confirm the formation of Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)(3) as a primary phase along with small amounts of AlPO4 and Li2O as impurity phases. LAGP specimens have ionic conductivities in the range of 10(-4) to 10(-5) Scm(-1) at room temperature. In addition, LAGP also exhibits electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen-reduction and evolution reactions. These results demonstrate the potential of LAGP prepared by sol-gel processes as a solid electrolyte for lithium-ion conduction in solid-state lithium-oxygen batteries.									13	0	1	0	0	0	14			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000338352500011

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key process in water splitting devices and metal-air batteries. Herein, we report conductive metal-organic framework (CMOF) nanowire arrays on carbon cloth as a promising electrocatalyst for OER. The pyrolysis-free C-MOF electrocatalyst can maintain intrinsic molecular active sites in the MOFs. The as-prepared electrode possesses overpotentials of -213 and 300 mV at 10 and 150 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability in 1 M KOH, respectively. Control experiments and Fourier-transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and Mossbauer spectra indicate that the Fe doped in the Ni-based MOFs may serve as highly effective OER active sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal an unusual self-adaptable property of the Fe active sites, which enables the OER intermediates to generate additional hydrogen bonds with the neighboring layer, thus lowering the free energy in the OER process. Our findings may provide an alternative method for developing MOF electrocatalysts in frontier potential applications.									81	4	0	0	3	0	82			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472183200029

Nickelocene (NiCp2) is used as an inexpensive metal precursor with oxygen plasma as the oxidant. The film growth rate saturates with both nickel precursor and plasma exposure. An ALD window is observed between 225 and 275 degrees C. Linear growth is achieved at 250 degrees C with a growth rate of 0.042 nm per cycle. The thickness is highly uniform and the surface roughness is below 1 nm rms for 52 nm thick films on Si(100). Substrates with aspect ratios up to 1:10 can be processed. As-deposited, the films consist of polycrystalline, cubic NiO, and are transparent over the entire visible range with an optical bandgap of 3.7 eV. The films consist of stoichiometric NiO and contain approximate to 1% of carbon impurities. Two promising applications of these films are showcased in renewable energy conversion and storage devices: The films are pinhole-free and exhibit excellent electron blocking capabilities, making them potential hole-selective contact layers in solar cells. Also, high electrocatalytic activity of ultrathin NiO films is demonstrated for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction, especially in electrolytes containing Fe3+.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			2196-7350			WOS:000442489600001

The kinetics of the decomposition of tert-BuOOH catalysed by Fe-III-oapc were studied in buffered solutions between pH 5 to 12 using gas chromatography analysis. The rate of catalytic decomposition of tert-BuOOH followed second-order kinetics in tert-BuOOH concentrations. The second-order rate constant (k(2)) had a maximum value at pH 11. Oxygen evolution was observed at high tert-BuOOH concentration, while oxygen consumption was observed at low tert-BuOOH concentration. The former indicates plural radical chain reactions of the tert-butoxyl radical and the latter suggests decomposition of the tert-butoxyl radical to acetone and methyl radical. By the electron spin resonance spin trapping method using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide and alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone it was found that the radical species generated in the reaction system is tert-butoxyl radical, which plays crucial roles in bactericidal activities.

Efficient, stable, and cost-effective electrodes are critical for energy efficient chlorine production, water disinfection, and wastewater treatment. These practical applications require an indepth understanding of the catalytic mechanism of chlorine evolution, the need for lower-cost electrode materials, and improvements in electrode design at the atomic scale. Herein, we examine factors controlling activity, selectivity, and stability of alternative CER electrodes and provide mechanistic insights for achieving improvements in performance and durability. Steric effects of crystal structure and intermetallic electron polarization provide insights for understanding and tuning the electrode activity and selectivity. Additional insight into electrode deactivation mechanisms was gained by employing model material systems under controlled conditions.

Based on the characterization of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption-desorption measurement, scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM), Cu-MnO2 had a typical long range ordered mesoporous structure and Cu was successfully introduced in octahedral framework. It exhibited excellent catalytic activity and stability for the phenol degradation by PMS. Phenol was always efficiently degraded over Cu-MnO2 at a pH range of 3.5-9.0. For example, the reaction rate constant at pH 7.0 was 0.073 min(-1), which was two times higher than that of MnO2 (0.039 min(-1)). Importantly, 102 was identified as the primary reactive species in CuMnO2/PMS system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed that more exposed surface oxygen defects due to Cu doping were responsible to the enhancement of PMS activation for phenol degradation. The results of PMS decomposition and oxygen evolution indicated that surface oxygen defects lower the reaction energy barrier of PMS decomposition by generating O-1(2) via the energy trapping by oxygen. Finally, the heterogeneous PMS activation mechanism over Cu-MnO2 was proposed.									59	2	0	0	28	0	61			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000446144600033	30125746

However, accumulation of insoluble discharge products and failure of catalysts often result in poor performance of Na-O-2 batteries and limit their cycling life. In this work, electrochemical reactions of Na-O-2 batteries were directly investigated in situ by assembling a solid-state Na-O-2 nanobattery in an aberration-corrected environmental transmission electron microscope. During discharge, NaO2 hollow spheres formed and expanded continuously, accompanying their partial decomposition into Na2O2. These spheres shrank and collapsed into Na2O2 nanoparticles during the charging process. Carbon nanotubes doped with Pt and bimetallic Pt/Ir nanoscale catalyst can promote product formation and reversible evolution.

However, the electrocatalytic hydrogen-evolving activity is still hindered by its moderate conductivity, arising from semiconducting property and the thermodynamically stable basal plane. It is anticipated that the integration of 2D MoSe2 nanosheets with a highly conductive large-area 2D substrate enables the accelerated interfacial electron transfer and the enhanced HER performance. We report herein a facile and scalable fabrication of 2D MoSe2/2D Ti3C2 MXene heterostructured architecture, where the layered MoSe2 nanosheets are in situ decorated on the exfoliated oxygen-terminated Ti3C2 MXene flakes. In comparison to pristine MoSe2 and the MoSe2/unmodified Ti3C2 MXene hybrids, the composite electrocatalysts of MoSe2 nanosheets and oxygen-terminated Ti3C2 MXene exhibited improved HER activities, owing to higher electrochemically active surface areas, an oxygen-substituted surface, and the synergy effect between nanosized MoSe2 and oxygen-terminated MXene nanosheets. This study serves to promote continuous efforts toward low-cost, high-performance HER electrocatalysts by taking advantage of merits of transition metal dichalcogenides and 2D nanostructures.									29	1	0	0	4	0	29			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000626769200084

The conformal graphene coating on the nanosheets significantly increased the conductivity and surface area of the Ni-Co double hydroxide electrodes. As the OER electrocatalyst, the Ni-Co graphene hybrids show a superior catalytic activity with a small Tafel slope of 67 mV per decade due to the synergy between the abundant active sites of the Ni-Co hydroxides and the conductive graphene coating, and a modest overpotential of 280 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Impressively, the electrodes exhibit an excellent stability evaluated by chronopotentiometry under a high current density of 30 mA cm(-2) for 12 h. As Li-ion battery anode, the materials show a high specific capacity of 373 mA h g(-1) up to 500 cycles even at a high current density of 1000 mA g(-1). This study provides a new strategy to develop robust and affordable alternative OER catalyst and anode material for high-performance lithium ion batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The highly dispersed Mo2C wires were composed of 10-15 nm nanocrystals with a mesopore size of 3.3 nm. The properties of nano-Mo2C wires were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and N-2 adsorption/desorption porosimetry. The highly active surface area and enriched nanoporosity for nano-Mo2C wires are unique features that make them a high-performance electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction in an alkaline medium. The electrocatalysis and reaction kinetics results show that nanoMo(2)C-based materials can be developed as new catalysts with high activity at low cost for electrochemical energy conversion applications.									41	5	0	0	1	0	42			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000335924800034	24519082

Using a typical Co-based metal-organic framework, ZIF-67, nanocrystals were precisely synthesized with tunable size and morphology. Nitrogen-doped carbon nano polyhedrons decorated with cobalt nanoparticles were fabricated via pyrolysis of ZIF-67 and the carbonized products inherited the nanosize and shape of the MOF precursor. The intense effect of size on the electrocatalytic activity and transport properties was systematically investigated. The catalyst derived from the smallest MOF (300 nm), exhibited superior performance towards oxygen reduction with an onset potential of 0.86 V and a half-wave potential of 0.71 V in acidic solution, which are comparable to the best carbon-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts. This work will pave the way for the development of MOF-derived energy materials in various fields such as fuel cells and Li-air batteries, and opens new avenues for the design of MOFs in electrochemical applications.									375	19	0	0	32	0	380			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000339535100011

Two phases, Ru and RuO2, could be deposited using the same source and reaction gas. The phase of the as-deposited film was found to be critically dependent on the deposition process parameters such as precursor partial pressure, oxygen partial pressure, and substrate temperature, A decrease in precursor partial pressure by either reducing carrier gas flow rate or bubbler temperature led to RuO2 formation while a decrease in oxygen partial pressure resulted in Ru formation. It was also identified that there exists a substrate temperature range in which a Ru Film is deposited at a given processing condition. When the temperature is either higher or lower than this temperature range, RuO2 Film deposition results. From careful analysis of the film deposition rate in conjunction with the evolution of the film phase, we conclude that film deposition occurs by two independent processes. One is the source gas decomposition process resulting in Ru him deposition, and the other is the oxidation of the Ru film resulting in RuO2 deposition. (C) 2000 The Electrochemical Society.

Herein, well-distributed nanopolyhedron (NP) Co3O4 grown on iron (Fe) encapsulated in graphitic layers on a nitrogenated, porous two-dimensional (2D) structure, namely, a C2N matrix, (NP Co3O4/Fe@C2N), presents an outstanding bifunctional catalytic activity with a comparable overpotential and Tafel slope to those of benchmark Pt/C and IrO2. The rationally designed atomic configuration of Co3O4 on the C2N matrix has a well-controlled NP morphology with a (111) plane, leading to bifunctional activities for the ORR and OER. Interestingly, the specific interaction between the NP Co3O4 nanoparticles and the C2N matrix introduces synergistic coupling and changes the electronic configuration of Co atoms and the C2N framework. Benefiting from the synergistic coupling of Co3O4 with the C2N matrix, the NP Co3O4/Fe@C2N electrocatalyst exhibits exceptionally high stability and an even lower charge-discharge overpotential gap of 0.85 V at 15 mA cm-2 than that of the Pt/C+IrO2 catalyst (1.01 V) in Zn-air batteries. This work provides insights into the rational design of a metal oxide on a C2N matrix for bifunctional, low-cost electrochemical catalysts. copy 2019 American Chemical Society.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1936-0851			INSPEC:19445436

Here, we report a self-templating method for the design of porous, edge-site-rich hybrid nanomaterials via the selective etching of layered double hydroxide precursors that contain an amphoteric metal by alkali treatment, followed by vapor phase selenization. The obtained hexagonal nickel selenide nanoplates anchored over nitrogen-doped graphene showed highly efficient and robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis due to the inherent in situ electrochemical oxidation property of selenides demonstrating low overpotential of 311 mV to achieve the 10 mA cm' water oxidation current density in 1 M KOH. The faster reaction kinetics and long-term stability of the catalyst encouraged us to demonstrate a real alkaline water electrolyzer, which enables high-performing overall water splitting with a low overpotential of 460 mV from theoretical potential of 1.23 V to generate sufficient amounts of H-2 and O-2 by achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This study thus provides a valuable strategy to tailor the surface texture of the catalyst as well as its effectiveness in developing robust multifunctional electrocatalysts, promoting the efficient design of porous materials for catalytic applications.									23	0	0	0	2	0	24			2574-0962			WOS:000458706600044

Herein, we propose a novel multilevel structure of Co/ Co3O4-Ni/NiO doped macroporous interconnected hollow carbon nanofibers (Co/Co3O4-Ni/NiO@MHCNFs) as a self-standing and binder-free cathode catalyst for Li-O2 batteries. We employed poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (SAN) as a self-sacrificial template to fabricate hollow nanofibers by coaxial electrospinning and pyrolysis. Furthermore, macroporous interconnected hollow carbon nanofibers were achieved by fine-tuning the particle size of ZIF-8 and electrospinning parameters. Remarkably, as a proof-of-concept application, the Co/Co3O4-Ni/ NiO decorated self-standing macroporous interconnected hollow carbon nanofibers (MHCNFs) electrodes exhibited significantly electrochemical performance, including a long-term cyclability (163 cycles) and maximum capacity (16623 mAh/g). This work rationally designs a scalable preparation of Co/Co3O4-Ni/NiO doped macroporous interconnected hollow carbon nanofibers, which provides a new idea for the design of self-supporting and binder-free oxygen electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000862592500001

Hereby, a bimetallic phosphide embedded in a N and P co-doped porous carbon (FeCoP2@NPPC) material was synthesized by using sustainable biomass-derived N- and P-containing carbohydrates and non-noble metal salts as precursors. The obtained material exhibits good catalytic activities in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting. The bimetallic alloy phosphide (FeCoP2) is the active site for electrocatalysis. Theoretical calculation indicates that the sub-layer Fe atoms and top-layer Co atoms in FeCoP2 exhibit a synergistic effect for enhanced electrocatalytic performance. The carbon matrix around the FeCoP2 can prevent the corrosion during the catalytic reactions. The hierarchically porous structure of the FeCoP2@NPPC material can promote the transfer of electrons and electrolyte, and increase the contact area of the active sites and electrolytes. N- and P-containing functionalities improve the wetting and conductivity properties of the porous carbon. Due to the synergistic effects, FeCoP2@NPPC requires a low overpotential of 114 and 150 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, and an overpotential of 236 mV for OER in 1.0 M KOH solution, which are much lower than those of FeP@NPPC and CoP@NPPC. Based on the density functional theory calculation, FeCoP2 yields the smallest Gibbs free energy change of rate-determining step among the samples, which leads to better electrochemical performances. In addition, when FeCoP2@NPPC was used as a bifunctional catalyst in water splitting, the electrolyzer needed a low voltage of 1.60 V to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, this work provides a strategy for preparing sustainable, stable, and highly active electrocatalysts for water splitting.									29	1	0	0	0	0	29			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000623228500094	33587587

The prepared Ag/Ag2O@MCOF(Co) is composed of irregular nanosheets, which are embedded with large amounts of Ag2O/AgNPs. Compared with MCOF(Co) and Ag/Ag2O@MCOF, the obtained Ag/Ag2O@MCOF(Co) catalyst displays superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance due to the synergistic effect among Co-O, Co-N, Ag2O, Ag, and the graphene-like nanostructure. The Ag/Ag2O@MCOF(Co) catalyst demonstrates an impressive half-wave potential of 0.76 V [vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] and an average kinetic current density of -4.8 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline solution toward ORR. As expected, the primary zinc-air battery is developed using Ag/Ag2O@MCOF(Co) as an air electrode achieved maximum peak power density (170.8 mW cm(-2)), a specific discharge capacity of 829 mAh g(-1), and stable long-term operation for 100 cycles.

Possible regimes of reaction wave propagation are identified for stoichiometric hydrogen-oxygen and hydrogen-air mixtures in a wide range of initial pressures and temperature levels, depending on the initial non-uniformity steepness. The limits of the regimes of reaction wave propagation depend upon the values of the spontaneous wave speed and the characteristic velocities of the problem. It is shown that one-step kinetics cannot reproduce either quantitative neither qualitative features of the ignition process in real gaseous mixtures because the difference between the induction time and the time when the exothermic reaction begins significantly affects the ignition, evolution, and coupling of the spontaneous reaction wave and the pressure wave, especially at lower temperatures. We show that all the regimes initiated by the temperature gradient occur for much shallower temperature gradients than predicted by a one-step model. The difference is very large for lower initial pressures and for slowly reacting mixtures. In this way the paper provides an answer to questions, important in practice, about the ignition energy, its distribution, and the scale of the initial nonuniformity required for ignition in one or another regime of combustion wave propagation.									46	4	1	0	0	0	50			1539-3755	1550-2376		WOS:000304482900003	23004867

These fragile elements disintegrate readily in the hot dense conditions present in the Big Bang and stellar evolution. Thus, their synthesis must occur in a cold, dilute cosmological environment. Reactions of Il and He ions with CNO nuclei during the passage of galactic cosmic rays through the interstellar medium can account for most of the LiBeB abundances. The isotope Li-7 requires production in the Big Bang and other sources. Because Be and B formation requires the existence of CNO formed during stellar evolution, their presence in old halo stars serves as a signal for nucleosynthesis. Measurements of cross sections for LiBeB production can now be combined with highly sensitive new measurements of the elemental abundances of these elements to gain new insights into the chemical evolution of the universe.

Herein, we combined nickel iron phosphide (NiFe-P) nanosheets with three-dimensional porous graphene foam (3DGF) as a substrate to design a bifunctional electrocatalyst NiFe-P@3DGF with excellent catalytic activity towards oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER, respectively) under alkaline conditions. At a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotentials for the OER and HER are less than 189 and 131 mV, respectively, and the stabilities exceed 50 h. Furthermore, this bifunctional catalyst also exhibits excellent water-splitting capability with a cell voltage of 1.57 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The special structure of the 3DGF substrate with its large surface area, high conductivity, and robust skeleton, as well as the unique core-shell structure of NiFe (oxy)hydroxides/phosphide formed throughout the reaction promote the high activity of the electrocatalyst. Therefore, this work provides a new perspective to exploit the efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst using porous 3DGF as the substrate.									10	1	0	0	0	1	10			2196-0216			WOS:000488690900001

Herein, a Co(II)-porphyrin/pyrene-comprised conjugated microporous polymer Co-MPPy-1 has been developed which shows efficient OER in alkaline medium. The material was characterized by Fourier transform infrared, solid-state C-13 cross-polarization magic angle spinning nuclear I magnetic resonance, N-2 volumetric adsorption/desorption analysis, scanning electron microscopy, ultra high resolution-transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and other physical studies. Co-MPPy-1 showed Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of similar to 501 m(2) g(-1).Co-MPPy-1 achieved a current density of 1 and 10 mA/cm(-2) at 340 and 420 mV, respectively. The turnover frequency calculated for the OER is 0.43 s(-1). The heterogeneity of this electrocatalyst was tested by chronoamperometric measurement and 1000 cycle recyclability test with retainment of the excellent electrochemical catalytic activity. This can be attributed to the presence of high density of Co(II) porphyrin unit and efficient charge transport in the Tr-conductive conjugated polymeric backbone.									44	2	0	0	3	0	44			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000455561200163	30547587

However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is a half-reaction of water electrolysis, is kinetically sluggish, and many active earth-abundant OER catalysts have been investigated. In this study, we prepared a NiFe oxide/nanocarbon composite using a simple solution process. An ethanol solution of Ni nitrate and Fe nitrate was added to commercial carbon black, and the mixture was calcined in air at 350 degrees C. During this simple process, amorphous NiFe oxide was deposited onto the carbon black. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicated that the Ni and Fe were well dispersed on the carbon black. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry indicated that Ni and Fe were located adjacent to each other, and that the NiFe species had formed. The NiFe oxide/nanocarbon composite catalysts exhibited high OER activity that was comparable to that of state-of-the-art Ir/C catalysts. This study demonstrated that the simple solution process produced a NiFe oxide/nanocarbon composite catalyst that efficiently catalyzes the OER. This process could be used to synthesize active and cost-effective OER catalysts for the production of green hydrogen.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000789214800001

The time evolution of theta H under CH4 exposure, in pressure and temperature ranges of 1X10(-8)-5x10(-7) Torr and 600-800 degrees C, reveals that the CH4 adsorption is a first-order reaction. The isothermal H-2 desorption is conducted in a temperature range of 1095-1270 degrees C. The time evolution of theta(H) shows that the isothermal H-2 desorption is also a first-order reaction. From Arrhenius plots of the reaction coefficients, the activation energies of CH4 adsorption and H-2 desorption are evaluated to be 7.3+/1.7 and 21+/-4.9 kcal/mol, respectively. Atomistic kinetics model for CH4 adsorption and H-2 desorption are discussed, especially in connection with a recent finding of gas source molecular beam epitaxy of diamond (001) with pure CH4 without any hydrogen or oxygen radicals.

However, the mechanism, especially how photogenerated holes participate in, behind the reaction remains highly debated. It is fundamental to identify the capability of groups at the TiO2/water interface to attract photogenerated holes. In this work, we applied the first-principles many-body Green's function theory to investigate the behaviors of free photo generated holes and coupled electron-hole pairs at three kinds of TiO2/water interfaces. Our calculations show that interaction between TiO2 and water elevates their respective valence band edges significantly. The groups derived from water, including Ti-OH, OH-, and H2O, cannot be oxidized by holes from photons at the optical absorption edge of TiO2. With higher-energy UV light, holes may be trapped by Ti-OH and OH-. However, these holes might eventually decay onto three-coordinated lattice O atoms both with and without the presence of photoelectrons if they cannot participate in the oxygen evolution reaction in time. Species related to water may only act as reactants in the photooxidation reaction. There must be some other configurations on TiO2(110), which are unknown yet and may emerge with the excited-state dynamics process, that provide active sites for holes to promote the photooxidation reaction.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			1932-7447			WOS:000447471700015

Both laccases, when immobilized on graphite electrodes either by direct physical adsorption or covalently attached via gold nanoparticles, were capable of both non-mediated and mediator-based bioelectroreduction of molecular oxygen at low overpotentials. GreeDo exhibited higher open circuit potential values and onset potentials for oxygen bioelectroreduction compared to OB-1. However, even though in homogeneous catalysis GreeDo outperforms OB-1 in terms of turnover numbers and catalytic efficiency, when exposed to high redox potential substrates, direct electron transfer based bioelectrocatalytic currents of GreeDo and OB-1 modified electrodes were similar. High operational stability of freely diffusing GreeDo and also the immobilized enzyme in the acidic electrolyte was registered, in agreement with high storage stability of GreeDo in acidic solutions.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000484836800005

Herein, Fe-MOF nanocones array on nickel foam are synthesized by introducing sodium hypochlorite, leading to Cl substitution of terephthalic acid in Fe-MOFs (Fe-MOF-Cl/NF). Experimental results show that Fe-MOF-Cl/NF exhibits enhanced OER activity over Fe-MOF/NF, lowering eta (50) from 292.4 to 222.7 mV. In combination with density function theory calculations, the improved OER performance is attributed to engineering electronic structure of Fe sites which accelerate the third step from *O to *OOH, and promote OER kinetics. Additionally, Fe-MOF-Cl/NF can retain catalytic activity for 100 h.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000727003600001

The search for highly active and cost-effective bifunctional catalysts to reduce the consumption of noble metals is necessary for efficient electrochemical water splitting. Using noble metal quantum dots has drawn increasing attention. Herein, we developed flower-like Pt-Fe2O3 thin film nanosheets on Ni foam (NF) as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in alkaline electrolyte. X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques were used to characterize the electrocatalyst. The unique design of Pt (111) quantum dot decorated flower-like Fe2O3 (104) thin film nanosheets exhibited a quantum size effect and possessed many active sites. Pt-Fe2O3/NF electrodes which were loaded with a small amount of Pt quantum dots exhibited low overpotentials for the OER (304 mV@50 mA cm(-2)) and HER (90 mV@10 mA cm(-2)), and a low voltage of 1.51 V for overall water splitting in 1 M KOH. Moreover, excellent stability was observed. Therefore, the flower-like nanosheet Pt-Fe2O3/NF electrode is a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst with the quantum size effect for overall water splitting in alkaline solution.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472225200056

Bifunctional electrocatalysts are actively pursued to simultaneously drive the two key reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), for hydrogen production by electrolysis water. One of the most promising candidates based on bimetallic layered double hydroxide salts (LHSs) and cobalt-based organic framework (ZIF-67) suffer from poor interface coupling. Herein, we present a new approach based on fusing NiCo LHSs nanowire arrays with ZIF-67 to fabricate three-dimensional flower-like structures on a Ni-Fe foam support. To improve interfacial coupling and catalytic performance, simple oxidation, carbonization, sulfurization, and selenization are performed to study the effects of different post-treatments and discover the optimum bifunctional electrocatalysts. The optimized S-doped catalyst reveals the highest electrocatalytic characteristic quantified by the low overpotentials of 170 and 100 mV for OER and HER at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, respectively. This outstanding electrocatalytic property is ascribed to strong interfacial coupling between the NiCo-LHSs and ZIF-67 derivatives, as well as the rational electronic structures, dense catalytic active sites, and large specific surface area. This work opens new prospects for fabricating efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for renewable hydrogen energy production.									28	1	0	0	1	0	28			2168-0485			WOS:000467351200028

In an effort to overcome this critical issue, a variety of catalysts have been introduced, but much room still remains for further advancement in catalyst design. By benchmarking hemoglobin in red blood cells that carry oxygen at a well-defined center of the molecular cage, herein, we report heme as an air-cathode catalyst with iron (Fe) active sites. Furthermore, the coordination of electron-withdrawing ligands, such as thiocyanate (S-C N) and azide (N-3), to the Fe center enhances its Lewis acidity to weaken the binding of oxygen intermediates (O-2*) towards more facile decomposition of the main discharging product (Li2O2). Density functional theory calculations and surface energy analysis of Fe coherently support the advantageous role of the ligand engineering in enhancing the reversibility of a Li-O-2 battery.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2405-8297			WOS:000469207500002

Herein, it was found that the catalytic performance of iron-nickel LDHs for OER can be largely boosted by a facile and controllable fluoridation approach at low temperatures. Temperature dependence of the crystal structure and surface chemical state was observed for the simple fluoridation of the iron-nickel LDH. However, no significant surface roughness and electrochemical active surface area increases were found, which was probably owing to the structure change from nanosheets to nanorods. Significant improvements in the performance, including the catalytic activity, stability, efficiency, and kinetics, were found compared with the pristine iron-nickel LDH. Specifically, iron-nickel fluoride obtained at 250 degrees C afforded the lowest overpotential of 225 mV (no iR correction) to drive 10 mA cm(-2) loaded on an inert glassy carbon electrode with a small Tafel slope of 79 mV dec(-1), outperforming the noble-metal IrO2 catalyst and most of the similar Fe-Ni based catalysts. The performance improvement could be mainly attributed to the phase-structure transfer from metal-O bonding in the FeNi-LDHs to metal-F bonding after fluoridation, which means it is easier to form the real active sites of Fe-doped high-valence Ni-(oxy)hydroxide over the iron-nickel fluoride surface.									49	2	0	0	7	0	49			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000479334300001	31225718

Accompanying the long experimental practice to optimize the catalyst, atomic simulations, mainly based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, have been performed in recent years to reveal the atomic structure of NiOOH and the reaction mechanism in catalysis. Due to both the structural complexity and the difficulty in computing the electronic structure, there are great concerns over the accuracy of first-principles methods and the validity of the structure models. This Perspective serves to overview the current status of atomic simulation on the structure and catalysis of NiOOH. We first present NiOOH phases and structures obtained by the latest global optimization methods in combination with machine learning potentials. The electronic structures of NiOOH are then described by comparing the performance of different theoretical levels, in particular, those based on PBE+U and hybrid functionals in DFT calculations. Finally, taking the oxygen evolution reaction of water splitting as the example, we elaborate the catalytic mechanism on pure, defective, and Fe-doped NiOOH surfaces and provide insights into the exceptional activity of the doped system. The further directions for theoretical investigations on NiOOH are also discussed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000755081200001

Here, we report the multilevel architecture optimization of Co-based nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in hollow N-doped carbon polyhedra for boosting the ORR and OER, which are fabricated by a two-step pyrolysis-oxidation strategy with a Co-based MOF (ZIF-67) as precursor. The key for this strategy lies in the precise and effective control of the oxidation processes of Co NPs, which enables the synthesis of a series of Co-Co3O4-based nanoarchitectures that are embedded in hollow nitrogen doped carbon polyhedra (HNCP), including core-shell Co/Co3O4, yolk@shell Co@Co3O4, and hollow Co3O4 NPs. Benefiting from its abundant oxygen vacancies and tetrahedral Co2+ and potential synergies of CoO, species and nitrogen-doped carbon as well as the efficient mass transfer of hollow and yolk-shell structures, the optimal yolk@shell Co3O4/HNCP-40 exhibits high activity for the OER with a low overpotential of 333 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 69 mV dec(-1), which is better than those of commercial IrO2 (its overpotential and Tafel slope are 409 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 104 mV dec(-1), respectively). Meanwhile, the catalyst also exhibits comparable ORR catalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.834 V but better stability and methanol tolerance relative to commercial Pt/C (20 wt %), making it a potential bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the OER and ORR. This MOF-templated strategy for multilevel nanostructures provides insights into the development of highly efficient and low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for the OER/ORR.									269	20	0	0	22	0	274			2155-5435			WOS:000444364800015

In this work, various Ag/MnO2-X (X indicates the pH value of wetness impregnation, i.e., 1, 5, 9, 13) were prepared and applied to room-temperature formaldehyde reforming reaction. In acidic condition, the Ag species were well dispersed and partially replaced K+ cations in the tunnels of MnO2. With the increase of pH, the Ag species aggregated into clusters (diameter of 2 similar to 5 nm). The difference in the geometric and electronic structure of Ag species resulted in variable catalytic performance. The turnover frequency of Ag/MnO2-1 (26,382 h(-1)) for hydrogen production was 4.48-fold to that of Ag/MnO2-13 (5,882 h(-1)). In Ag/MnO2-1, the formed Ag-O-Mn bond in the tunnels acted like an electron transfer channel, promoting for the reduction of chemisorbed oxygen and its subsequent proton capture from formaldehyde. Furthermore, this unique structure also benefited for the dissociation of water molecules, accelerating the combination of two protons (one is from formaldehyde, the other is from water) for hydrogen production. This work clearly explains the Ag size/structure-dependent effect on formaldehyde reforming at atomic level, providing guidance for the design of high-efficient catalysts for aqueous-phase hydrogen evolution reactions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000776696700004

OER is a complex four-electron transfer process, and to sustain the spontaneous generation of hydrogen at the cathode, it is urgent to develop some earth-abundant, low-cost electrode materials. Recently, use of cobalt-based hydroxide as the electrode substrate has taken much consideration and has been fabricated over various substrates. Because of various structural disorders, internal resistance, and dependence on the electrode, the binder substrate makes their applications limited. Here, in this work, to remove structural disorder and to increase electrical conductivity, we have incorporated silver ions into amorphous Co(OH)(2), which turns to be a highly active OER electrocatalyst. Also, for the first time, we have developed hydroxide-based materials by using DNA as a stabilizer, and most importantly, using DNA gives an immense opportunity to run long-term OER applications without using an external binder such as nafion. Moreover, for the first time, these DNA-based materials were coated on nickel foam mainly to eliminate the low conductive nature of Ag2O. The synthesized catalyst showed a very high OER activity, and to reach 50 mA/cm(2) current density, it needs only 260 mV as overpotential. The amorphous nature of hydroxide-based materials gives a higher opportunity toward the electrolyte to bind on the surface of a catalyst to run the OER with less applied overpotentials.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000620345400059	33534570

In this work, bimetallic Ni-Fe phytates are rapidly in situ grown on the surface of nickel foam (Ni-Fe-phy@NF) based on the robust complexation ability of the phytate ion. The phytate ion with multiple complexation sites promotes the formation of large cross-linking networks, which enhances the synergistic effect between Ni, Fe and P and the interaction between active materials and the nickel foam substrate. Besides, the partial dissolution of the phosphorus in the cross-linking networks induces the formation of abound porous structures during the OER process. This process is accompanied by the transformation from metal phytates to amorphous Ni-Fe-based oxides and hydroxides with a high valence state as efficient active sites for the OER. Therefore, the Ni-Fe-phy@NF electrode shows robust OER catalytic activity and enduring stability. Note that the synthetic strategy based on ligands with multiple complexation sites can be further used to rapidly design and prepare other novel three-dimensional electrode materials with improved catalytic performance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2052-1553			WOS:000810893200001

The catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 79 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and 326 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) for OER in freshwater under an alkaline condition. The formation of an open 3D channel architecture derived from highly conductive ZnP@Ni2P-NiSe2 nanorods attached nickel foam generates more exposed active sites and promotes fast mass transport. In addition, density functional theory study reveals a synergistic effect between Ni2P and NiSe2 phase to reduce adsorption free energy and increase the electronic conductivity, thereby accelerating the catalytic reaction kinetics. An electrolyzer of the ZnP@Ni2P-NiSe2(+,-) requires only cell voltages of 1.54 V (1.43 V) and 1.51 V (1.44 V) to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in freshwater and mimic seawater at 25 degrees C (75 degrees C), respectively, along with prospective long-term stability. Furthermore, the solar energy-assisted water splitting process demonstrates a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 19.75%, implying that the catalyst is an effective and low-cost candidate for water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000796764100001

IrO2 is known to be one of the most active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a PEM electrolyzer, but the HER activity of IrO2 is rarely studied because of its low cathodic current compared to platinum. Herein, an IrO2-Fe2O3 composite oxide was prepared by a thermal decomposition method. The physical and electrochemical characterization of the material was achieved by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Compared to that of IrO2, the CV curves of the IrO2-Fe2O3 electrode reveal that hydrogen is more easily adsorbed on the surface, which would lead to the H underpotential deposition (H-UPD) redox current increasing significantly. Therefore, the IrO2-Fe2O3 electrode exhibits higher HER activity than that of the IrO2 electrode in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution as shown by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). It is attributed to the electronic structure modification of IrO2 and synergetic effect between Ir and Fe in the IrO2-Fe2O3 electrode. In addition, the Tafel slope of 36.2 mV dec(-1) suggests that the mechanism for the IrO2-Fe2O3-catalyzed HER is Volmer-Heyrovsky.									24	1	0	0	1	0	24				2046-2069		WOS:000399244200024

Herein, hierarchical nanoporous and single-crystal Zn3V3O8 nanosheets are adopted to anchor in situ formed RuO2 clusters. X-ray photoelectron analysis reveals significant binding energy changes of both Ru and V due to the creation of strong Ru-O-V bonding interaction, which would lead to the reconstruction of the electronic structure of the Zn3V3O8 matrix and RuO2 clusters. The ultrastrong electronic interaction also results in superior OER activity, indicated by a small overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (228 mV) and a shallow Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1). First-principles simulation further reveals the synergistic effect derived from the unique RuO2@Zn3V3O8 couple, which effectively regulates the electronic structure for the OER process. In addition, the created interfacial chemical bond and the confined microporous structure of the Zn3V3O8 substrate could prevent the RuO2 clusters from detachment and aggregation, making the nanocomposite a promising long-term stable OER electrocatalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000751884800028	34781674

High-performance and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are urgently required. Bimetallic (oxy)hydroxides have been widely used in alkaline OER as electrocatalysts, but their activity is still not satisfactory due to insufficient active sites. In this research, A unique and efficient approach of sacrificial W to prepare CoFe (oxy)hydroxides with abundant active species for OER is presented. Multiple ex situ and operando/in situ characterizations have validated the self-reconstruction of the as-prepared CoFeW sulfides to CoFe (oxy)hydroxides in alkaline OER with synchronous W etching. Experiments and theoretical calculations show that the sacrificial W in this process induces metal cation vacancies, which facilitates the in situ transformation of the intermediate metal hydroxide to CoFe-OOH with more high-valence Co(III), thus creating abundant active species for OER. The Co(III)-rich environment endows the in situ formed CoFe oxyhydroxide with high catalytic activity for OER on a simple flat glassy carbon electrode, outperforming those not treated by the sacrificial W procedure. This research demonstrates the influence of etching W on the electrocatalytic performance, and provides a low-cost means to improve the active sites of the in situ self-reconstructed bimetallic oxyhydroxides for OER.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000750921800001	35119186

Here, we quantified the exchange kinetics of oxygen isotopes between five Pi isotopologues (P18O4, P18O316O, P18O216O2, P18O16O3, and P16O4) and water using Raman spectroscopy and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) during the PPase-catalyzed 18O-16O isotope exchange reaction in Piwater and PPi-water systems. At a high PPi concentration (300 mM), hydrolysis of PPi by PPase was predominant, and only a small fraction of PPi (???1%) took part in the reversible hydrolysis-condensation reaction (PPi <-> Pi), leading to the oxygen isotope exchange between Pi and water. We demonstrated that Raman and NMR methods can be equally applied for monitoring the kinetics of the oxygen exchange between the Pi isotopologue and water. It was found that the isotope exchange determined by the spectroscopic methods was detectable as low as 0.2% 18O abundance, but the reliability below 1% was much lower. Given that high P concentrations (>= 1 mM) are required in these methods, environmental application of these methods is limited to rare high P conditions in engineered and agricultural environments.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2472-3452			WOS:000813480200001

However, the most challenging issue for ZABs is the sluggish kinetics and unsatisfactory stability for the oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) on the air electrode. Herein, a flexible, large-area 3D N-doped graphene-like full carbon air electrode with an O-rich functional group (NO-G@CP) was successfully synthesized using a cotton pad as a templateviaa scalable, low-cost and one-step pyrolysis process. Benefitting from the 3D porous N-doped graphene structure and rich Cxe001;O group, the as-prepared NO-G@CP air electrode exhibits superior ORR/OER bifunctional catalytic activity and stability. Impressively, the integrated NO-G@CP can be directly used as an efficient air cathode for flexible solid-state ZABs. An open-circuit voltage of up to 1.328 V and a maximum power density of 65.1 mW cm(-2)for the flexible solid-state ZABs have been obtained. This work provides valuable guidance toward the development of emerging flexible and wearable devices in practice.									26	2	0	0	1	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000541615200008

Nickel loading is varied from 1.5 to 40 wt % in a highly controlled fashion by simply tuning Ni2+ to graphene oxide ratio in the hydrothermal reaction mixture. In fact, graphene aerogel loaded with 40 wt % Ni has a BET surface area of 560 m(2) g(-1) due to the preservation of the porous structure with the aid of supercritical CO2 drying. The thermal reduction applied for the growth of nanoparticles induces deoxygenation of graphene aerogel structure simultaneously. Valence band spectroscopy results reveal an increase in metallicity with a gradual increase in the nickel loading, which has a direct impact on the final electrocatalytic performance. For the evaluation of the electrocatalytic activity of Ni/NiO loaded aerogels toward oxygen evolution reaction, cyclic voltammetry (coupled with a rotating disk electrode) is utilized. In fact, 40 wt % Ni loaded graphene aerogel requires a low overpotential of 320 mV for the supply of 10 mA cm(-2) (with a Tafel slope of 61 mV dec(-1) and a TOF of 0.11 s(-1)), which outperforms most of the Ni-based electrocatalysts reported in the literature.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000499737700016

In this study, iron manganite (FeMnO3) nanomaterials were synthesized as an affordable electrocatalyst for water oxidation reactions. The structural and chemical properties of FeMnO3 nanomaterials were studied by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analyses. The microscopy analyses show that the synthesized material has wire morphology, and assembly of approximately 70 nm nanocrystallites forms the wires. XRD patterns confirmed the bixbyite structure of FeMnO3. The potential utility of the synthesized FeMnO3 nanowires (NWs) as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was investigated in alkaline medium. The FeMnO3 NW modified fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) electrodes demonstrated promising OER activity with onset potential of 1.60 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and overpotential of 600 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) catalytic current density. FeMnO3 NW modified FTO electrode was also observed to be stable during long-term constant potential electrolysis. Therefore, this new material can be considered as a cost-effective alternative to noble metal electrocatalysts for water oxidation and other possible catalytic reactions.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000487946000017

Original (laminated as received) and polished surfaces of six specimens were examined using conventional polarization methods in acid zinc sulfate electrolyte with MnSO4 at 38 degrees C. The potential during polarization showed that the original and polished surface of specimens Pb-0.52%Ag (#1) had the highest potential, followed by Pb-0.52%Ag (#2), Pb-0.57%Ag (#3), Pb-0.6%Ag (#4), Pb-0.67%Ag (#5) and Pb-0.68%Ag (#6). Higher silver content leads to lower overpotentials. Duplicate experiments of original and polished surfaces confirmed this trend.

The porous carbon cathode exhibits a higher discharge capacity and average discharge potential compared to a typical carbon black cathode. This superior electrochemical result can be attributed to the triple hierarchical pores of the cathode: micropores that act as channels for oxygen to flow without interruption by the accumulated discharge product, abundant mesopores that shape the size of the discharge product and transport the electrolyte, and macropores that easily accommodate the accumulation of discharge product. To further promote Li2O2 formation/decomposition, the cathode can be decorated with a Ru catalyst, which strongly influences the oxygen evolution reaction performance. Conspicuously, triple hierarchical porous carbon spheres exhibit a homogeneous distribution of the Ru catalyst and thus provide an appropriate architecture. The synergistic effect from the unique structure and catalytic competence of Ru increases the capacity and rate capability with lower over-potential, and facilitates the formation of Li2O2. This can be decomposed at a low potential during recharge and thus contributes to the very high energy efficiency.

Despite tremendous efforts, the development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with high activity and low cost under mild conditions remains a great challenge. In this work, we develop a hybrid consisting of Co3O4 nanocrystals supported on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) via a simple self-assembly approach. A Co3O4/SWNTs hybrid electrode for the OER exhibits much enhanced catalytic activity as well as superior stability under neutral and alkaline conditions compared with bare Co3O4, which only performs well in alkaline solution. Moreover, the turnover frequency for the OER exhibited by Co3O4/SWNTs in neutral water is higher than for bare Co3O4 catalysts. Synergetic chemical coupling effects between Co3O4 nanocrystals and SWNTs, revealed by the synchrotron X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) technique, can be regarded as contributing to the activity, cycling stability and stable operation under neutral conditions. Use of the SWNTs as an immobilization matrix substantially increases the active electrode surface area, enhances the durability of catalysts under neutral conditions and improves the electronic coupling between Co redox-active sites of Co3O4 and the electrode surface.									246	12	0	0	10	0	249			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000307398100002

A clear understanding of the surface reactions and the growth mechanism of Li2O2 requires probing dynamic changes on the surface of the positive electrodes in situ during the discharge of a Li-O-2 battery. To investigate this, we establish an experimental system by adopting a multi-beam optical sensor (MOS) and developing a custom-made battery cell. First, the accuracy and reliability of the system was demonstrated by analyzing the stress accumulation on the Au negative electrode during Li plating/stripping, and the results were consistent with an earlier single-beam scanning deflectometry report. Then, the Li-O-2 battery was discharged in LiNO3 in diglyme electrolyte by applying either linear sweep voltammetry or by applying constant current under an O-2 environment. Control experiments in Argon-saturated electrolytes indicate surface stress generation due to charge-induced stress. The stress generation on Au positive electrode is attributed to the formation of Li2O2 reaction products on the Au surface and charge-induced stress.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000722734600001

Herein, a simple electrospinning strategy combining subsequent annealing process for the construction of Co3O4/CeO2 p-n heterojunction in-situ embedded in Co/N-doped carbon nanofiber (Co3O4/ CeO2@Co/N-CNF) derived from metal-organic framework (MOF) is developed. The coupled heterogeneous interface and highly concentrated oxygen vacancies ensure a rapid charge transfer between Co3O4 and CeO2, leading to and changed electronic state and rich defect sites. Accordingly, the prepared Co3O4/CeO2@Co/N-CNF catalyzed Li-O2 battery delivers a low voltage gap (0.87 V at a middle capacity of 500 mAh/g), high discharge/ charge specific capacities (9667.3/9317.3 mAh/g at 100 mA g-1), and improved cycling lifespan (exceed 70 cycles at 100 mA g-1). In addition, interface engineering of heterostructure electrocatalysts can effectively regulate the morphology of discharge products. This research offers a new insight into the construction of het-erojunction to boost the electrocatalytic performance of Li-O2 batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000863246300004

Currently lithium-air batteries still have quite a few problems and challenges to overcome, as for cathode electrodes, the development of lithium-air battery technology is hindered by air electrode with improved activity. Thus, the preparation of the high-efficiency cathode materials is still challenging. As one of the most attractive cathode materials for lithium-air batteries, carbon-based catalysts(cathode materials) have received extensive attention and research in recent years. In this paper, based on the comprehensive analysis of our group's achievements, the recent progress of cathode catalyst for non-aqueous lithium-air batteries is briefly introduced, including porous carbon-based materials, graphene-based materials, and doped carbon materials. In every section, we also attempt to propose the future development of carbon-based cathode materials for the next stage.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			1005-281X			WOS:000493993000007
