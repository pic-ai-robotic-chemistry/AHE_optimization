The influence of substrate bias V-b(|V-b|<= 50 V) on the film properties was investigated. The results obtained by fitting ellipsometry spectra in the 1.5-6 eV range, using a three-sublayer physical model, are in good agreement with the film morphology when no bias is applied or V-b=-10 V. The refractive indices in the transparent range are enhanced at V-b=-50 V, according to a physical model which only includes a homogenous layer and a top roughness layer. Scanning electron microscopic views show that all the films exhibit a columnar structure, but layer compactness and organization increase with the bias. The film structure evolution as a function of V-b is also evidenced on the refractive index dispersion curves. Complementary X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements show that films are basically amorphous mixed with a small amount of anatase at the floating potential (V-b=0), whereas applying a bias voltage leads to the enhancement of anatase phase and the appearance of rutile phase (V-b=-50 V).

(2002) FEBS Lett. 523, 138-142]. This mutant completely lacks the PsbO-1 protein and overexpresses the PsbO-2 protein. To further study the effect of PsbO-1 deficiency on the function of photosystem II, the polyphasic chlorophyll a fluorescence rise and flash fluorescence induction and decay of the relative fluorescence quantum yield were measured in whole leaves from wild type and the psbo1 mutant. Additionally, flash oxygen yield experiments were performed on thylakoid membranes isolated from wild type and the psbo1 mutant. The results obtained indicate that during fluorescence induction the psbo1 gene exhibited an enhanced O to P transition. Additionally, while the J to I transition in wild type accounted for more than 30% of the total fluorescence yield, in the mutant it accounted for less than 2% rise in the total. Analysis of the flash-induced fluorescence rise in the presence of DCMU indicated that in wild type the ratio of PS II alpha to PS II beta reaction centers was similar to 1.2 while in the mutant the ratio was similar to 0.3. Fluorescence decay kinetics in the absence of DCMU indicated that electron transfer to Q(B) was significantly altered in the mutant. Fluorescence decay kinetics in the presence of DCMU indicated that the charge recombination between Q(A)(-) and the S-2 state of the oxygen-evolving complex was retarded. Furthermore, flash oxygen yield analysis indicated that both the S-2 and S-3 states exhibited significantly longer lifetimes in the psbo1 mutant than in wild type. Our data indicate that while PsbO-1-deficient plants can grow photoautotrophically (although at a reduced growth rate) the photochemistry of PS II is significantly altered.									27	1	1	0	27	0	28			0006-2960			WOS:000247340300029	17542616	
J	MACLACHLAN, DJ; NUGENT, JHA								INVESTIGATION OF THE S3 ELECTRON-PARAMAGNETIC-RESONANCE SIGNAL FROM THE OXYGEN-EVOLVING COMPLEX OF PHOTOSYSTEM-2 - EFFECT OF INHIBITION OF OXYGEN EVOLUTION BY ACETATE								BIOCHEMISTRY				32	37			9772	9780		10.1021/bi00088a032				SEP 21 1993	1993	An S3 electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal is observed in a variety of photosystem 2 (PS2) samples in which the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) has been inhibited. These signals have been proposed to be due to an interaction, S2X+, between the manganese cluster in an oxidation state equivalent to S2 and an organic radical, either oxidized histidine [Boussac et al. (1990) Nature 347, 303-3061 or the tyrosine radical Y(z)+ [Hallahan et al. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 4562-45731. We report that treatment of PS2 with acetate at pH 5.5 leads to a slowing of the reduction of Y(z)+ and allows the trapping of an S3-type state on freezing to 77 K following illumination at 277 K. The S3 EPR signal in acetate-treated PS2 has a broader and more complex line shape but otherwise has similar properties to other S3 signals. The addition to acetate-treated samples in the S1 state of the herbicide 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), which allows only a single turnover of the reaction center, causes a large reduction in the yield of the S3 signal. Various anion and cation treatments change the S3 signal line shape and are used to show that acetate probably acts by binding and displacing chloride. We propose that a variety of treatments which affect calcium and chloride cofactor binding cause a modification of the S2 state of the manganese cluster, slow the reduction of Y(z)+ and allow an S3 EPR signal to be observed following illumination. The origin of the S3 signal, whether a modified S3 or S2X+ where X is an organic radical, remains in doubt as the involvement and identity of the organic radical is still uncertain.									78	0	0	0	55	0	78			0006-2960			WOS:A1993LY29400032	8396970	
J	Yuasa, Hajime Julie; Hasegawa, Tetsuo; Nakamura, Takahiro; Suzuki, Tomohiko								Bacterial expression and characterization of molluscan IDO-like myoglobin								COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				146	4			461	469		10.1016/j.cbpb.2006.11.028				APR 2007	2007	The indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-like myoglobin (Mb) is a unique type of N4b isolated from the buccal mass of several archgastropod species. Here, we expressed Sulculus diversicolor IDO-like Mb as a GST-fusion protein in bacteria. The visible spectrum of GST-fusion fDO-like Mb shows characteristic alpha- and beta-peaks, indicating that it binds oxygen. To identify residues important in heme and oxygen binding, we constructed site-directed mutants. We initially replaced each of the 7 histidines of S. diversicolor IDO-like W with alanine. The spectra of three mutants (H74A, H288A, and H332A) revealed a remarkable loss of absorbance around 414 nm, indicating that they cannot bind heme. HiS(74), HiS(288), and His(332) were also replaced by arginine or tyrosine. Neither H332R nor H332Y contains heme, suggesting that His(332) is the proximal ligand of IDO-like Mb. In contrast, both H74R and H288Y mutants were isolated in the heme-binding oxy-form. The autoxidation rates of these two mutants showed that they can bind oxygen as stably as wild-type. His 74 and His 288 might be partially associated with heme-binding, but do not act as the distal ligand. The S. diversicolor IDO-like Mb seems to stably bind oxygen in a different manner from normal myoglobins. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

J	Gou, X; Li, N; Lian, LS; Yan, DW; Zhang, H; Wu, CX								Hypoxia adaptation and hemoglobin mutation in Tibetan chick embryo								SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES C-LIFE SCIENCES				48	6			616	623		10.1360/062004-116				DEC 2005	2005	Tibetan chick lives at high altitudes between 2600 and 4200 m with a high hatchability and low land breeds survive rarely with a hatchability of 3.0% under hypoxia of simulated 4200 m. Under hypoxia of whole 21 cl, the hatchability of Tibetan chick and Recessive White Feather broiler differed with a greatest disparity from day 4 to 11 and also significantly in other stages except from day 1 to 3. Hypoxia in each stage did not reduce significantly survival rate of this stage except hatchability. These two results indicated that the hypoxia in the early stage had an adverse effect on the later stage. All exons encoding chick hemoglobins were sequenced to analyze gene polymorphism. The functional mutation Met-32(B13)-Leu, related with hypoxia, was found in alpha(D) globin chain and the mutation frequency increased with increased altitude. In addition, under hypoxic conditions, the population with higher mutation frequency had a higher hatchability. The automated homology model building was carried out using crystal structure coordinates of chick HbD. The results indicated that the substitution Met-32(B13)-Leu provides a more hydrophobic environment which leads to higher stability of heme and oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. The occurrence of the mutation Met-32(B13)-Leu is related to the origin of Tibetan chick.									16	1	0	0	12	0	17			1006-9305			WOS:000235013600010	16483141

In our study, BiOBr/C Schottky junctions with two stack forms, the parallel and vertical junctions, were prepared controllably via CVD. Their applications in photocatalytic H-2 generation and overall water splitting have been investigated systematically. Both the parallel and vertical junctions show a breakthrough in light response and H-2 generation under visible light (lambda > 420 nm). The high H-2 generation rate of the parallel junctions can reach up to 2850 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which is 18 times more than that of the vertical ones, because of the greatly enhanced efficiency of carrier separation. In particular, the parallel junctions exhibit excellent photocatalytic overall water splitting, with an H-2 generation rate of 240 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) and oxygen generation rate of 110 mu mol h(-1) g(-1). The active site of the H-2 reduction reaction of the two junctions is determined, and the transfer of photogenerated carriers is monitored by Kelvin probe force microscopy. On this basis, the mechanism of carrier separation of parallel and vertical junctions has been analyzed. This work pushes the series of ternary layered materials of BiOBr toward the applications of photocatalytic H-2 generation and overall water splitting.									19	0	0	0	5	0	19			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000693105500056

The deposition of iron oxide via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or atomic layer deposition (ALD) under mild conditions necessitates a precursor that comprises good volatility, stability, and reactivity. Here, a versatile iron precursor, namely [bis(N-isopropylketoiminate) iron(II)], which possesses ideal characteristics both for low-temperature CVD and water-assisted ALD processes, is reported. The films are thoroughly investigated toward phase, composition, and morphology. As-deposited ALD grown Fe2O3 layers are amorphous, while the CVD process in the presence of oxygen leads to polycrystalline hematite layers. The nanostructured iron oxide grown via CVD consists of nanoplatelets that are appealing for photoelectrochemical applications. Preliminary tests of the photoelectrocatalytic activity of CVD-grown Fe2O3 layers show photocurrent densities up to 0.3 mA cm(-2) at 1.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and 1.2 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V versus RHE under simulated sunlight (1 sun). Surface modification by cobalt oxyhydroxide (Co-Pi) co-catalyst is found to have a highly beneficial effect on photocurrent, leading to maximum monochromatic quantum efficiencies of 10% at 400 nm and 4% at 500 nm at 1.5 V versus RHE.									25	1	0	0	0	0	25			2196-7350			WOS:000411525700006

Despite recent grand advances in the development of synthetic techniques, the overall performance of electrocatalytic processes enters the bottleneck stage through focusing only on the design and modification of bifunctional catalyst materials. Herein, we report a simple yet robust strategy to markedly boost the performance of ZABs via capitalizing on the photothermal effect. Concretely, a bifunctional electrocatalyst comprising Co3O4 nanoparticles encapsulated within N-doped reduced graphene oxide (denoted as Co3O4/N-rGO) acted as both active material and photothermal component. Upon light illumination, the compelling photothermal effect of Co3O4/N-rGO rendered a localized and instant heating of the electrode with more active sites, enhanced electrical conductivity and improved release of bubbles. As such, a prominently reduced indicator Delta E of 0.635 V was realized, significantly outperforming recently reported systems (usually >0.68 V). Corresponding rechargeable ZABs based on Co3O4/N-rGO air electrodes possessed an excellent maximum power density of 299 mW cm(-2) (1.8 times that of Pt/Ru-based ZABs) assisted by the photothermal effect with a superb cycling stability (over 500 cycles). This intensification strategy opens vast possibilities to ameliorate the performance of catalysts via innovatively and conveniently utilizing their photothermal feature, which may advance future application in high-performance ZABs and other energy conversion and storage systems.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000671844000001

The intrusive rocks exposed in the Nuri ore district consist of quartz diorite, granodiorite, monzogranite, granite porphyry, quartz diorite porphyrite and granodiorite porphyry, all of which intrude in the Cretaceous strata of the Bima Group. Owing to the intense metasomatism and hydrothermal alteration, carbonate rocks of the Bima Group form stratiform skarn and hornfels. The mineralization at the Nuri deposit is dominated by skarn, quartz vein and porphyry type. Ore minerals are chalcopyrite, pyrite, molybdenite, scheelite, bornite and tetrahedrite, etc. The oxidized orebodies contain malachite and covellite on the surface. The mineralization of the Nuri deposit is divided into skarn stage, retrograde stage, oxide stage, quartz-polymetallic sulfide stage and quartz-carbonate stage. Detailed petrographic observation on the fluid inclusions in garnet, scheelite and quartz from the different stages shows that there are four types of primary fluid inclusions: two-phase aqueous inclusions, daughter mineral-bearing multiphase inclusions, CO2-rich inclusions and single-phase inclusions. The homogenization temperature of the fluid inclusions are 280 degrees C386 degrees C (skarn stage), 200 degrees C340 degrees C (oxide stage), 140 degrees C375 degrees C (quartz-polymetallic sulfide stage) and 160 degrees C280 degrees C (quartz-carbonate stage), showing a temperature decreasing trend from the skarn stage to the quartz-carbonate stage. The salinity of the corresponding stages are 2.9%49.7 wt% (NaCl) equiv., 2.1%7.2 wt% (NaCl) equiv., 2.6%55.8 wt% (NaCl) equiv. and 1.2%15.3 wt% (NaCl) equiv., respectively. The analyses of CO2-rich inclusions suggest that the ore-forming pressures are 22.1 M Pa50.4 M Pa, corresponding to the depth of 0.9 km2.2 km. The Laser Raman spectrum of the inclusions shows the fluid compositions are dominated in H2O, with some CO2 and very little CH4, N2, etc. dD values of garnet are between -114.4% and -108.7% and d18OH2O between 5.9% and 6.7%; dD of scheelite range from -103.2% to -101.29% and d18OH2O values between 2.17% and 4.09%; dD of quartz between -110.2% and -92.5% and d18OH2O between -3.5% and 4.3%. The results indicate that the fluid came from a deep magmatic hydrothermal system, and the proportion of meteoric water increased during the migration of original fluid. The d34S values of sulfides, concentrated in a rage between -0.32% to 2.5%, show that the sulfur has a homogeneous source with characteristics of magmatic sulfur. The characters of fluid inclusions, combined with hydrogen-oxygen and sulfur isotopes data, show that the ore-forming fluids of the Nuri deposit formed by a relatively high temperature, high salinity fluid originated from magma, which mixed with low temperature, low salinity meteoric water during the evolution. The fluid flow through wall carbonate rocks resulted in the formation of layered skarn and generated CO2 or other gases. During the reaction, the ore-forming fluid boiled and produced fractures when the pressure exceeded the overburden pressure. Themeteoric water mixed with the ore-forming fluid along the fractures. The boiling changed the pressure and temperature, oxygen fugacity, physical and chemical conditions of the whole mineralization system. The escape of CO2 from the fluid by boiling resulted in scheelite precipitation. The fluid mixing and boiling reduced the solubility of metal sulfides and led the precipitation of chalcopyrite, molybdenite, pyrite and other sulfide.									32	8	0	0	1	0	39			1344-1698	1751-3928		WOS:000298591200004		
J	Markl, G; Marks, M; Wirth, R								The influence of T, a(SiO2), and f(O2) on exsolution textures in Fe-Mg olivine: An example from augite syenites of the Ilimaussaq Intrusion, South Greenland								AMERICAN MINERALOGIST				86	1-2			36	46						JAN-FEB 2001	2001	Two samples from the augite syenite unit of the 1.13 Ga alkaline to peralkaline Illimaussaq intrusion in South Greenland contain olivine (Fa(75.85))With micrometer-sized exsolution lamellae of intergrown augite and magnetite. The exsolved olivine contains only about 0.6 wt% CaO, whereas the reintegrated magmatic composition contained about 1.4% CaO corresponding to about 3 mol% of a larnite (La) component. The exsolved olivine bears no measurable Na, Al, or Ti, but the reintegrated magmatic olivine contained up to 0.4 wt% Na2O, 0.2 wt% Al2O3, and 0.3 wt% TiO2. Magmatic baddeleyite in the same samples indicates an extremely low silica activity of below 0.4 during the early stages of magmatic crystallization at > 900 degreesC and 1 kbar. According to the equilibrium Ca2SiO4 (La in Ol) + SiO2 = 2 CaSiO3 (Wo in Cpx), the low silica activity is thought to be responsible for the unusually Ca-rich compositions of the primary olivines, which, in these samples, formed at 875 +/- 15 degreesC and at oxygen fugacities between 1.2 and 2.3 log units below the QFM buffer. The composite exsolution lamellae formed during cooling due to an overstep of the schematic reaction Fa + Kst (Ca-rich component in olivine) + 1/3 O-2 = Hd + 2/3 Mt. Phase equilibria indicate temperatures between 300 and 750 degreesC and oxygen fugacities close to QFM for this exsolution process. The lamellae only developed in samples where the olivines were both especially high in Ca and presumably rapidly cooled (although not chilled!), as the lamella-bearing samples were collected at the outermost rim of the augite syenite unit and close to the top of the Ilimaussaq intrusion. Schreinemakers analysis shows that Ca-rich olivine of the kirschsteinite-monticellite solid solution series [Ca(Fe,Mg)SiO4] would exsolve from Ca-bearing olivine of the fayalite-forsterite series only at unusually low silica activities. whereas at higher silica activities, the observed exsolutions of clinopyroxene with magnetite are more stable. Hence, both cooling history and evolution of intensive variables during: cooling are important for the formation of olivine exsolution textures.									33	0	0	0	1	0	33			0003-004X			WOS:000166355700005

Ionomer acts as the binder, facilitates proton transport, and thereby drastically improves catalyst utilization and effectiveness. However, advanced morphological and functional characterizations have revealed that up to 60% of Pt nanoparticles can be trapped in the micropores of carbon support particles. Ionomer clusters and oxygen molecules can hardly enter into micropores, leading to low Pt utilization and effectiveness. Moreover, the ionomer thin-films covering Pt nanoparticles can cause significant mass transport loss especially at high current densities. Ionomer-free ultra-thin catalyst layers (UTCLs) emerge as a promising alternative to reduce Pt loading by improving catalyst utilization and effectiveness, while theoretical issues such as the proton conduction mechanism remain puzzling and practical issues such as the rather narrow operation window remain unsettled. At present, the development of PEFC catalyst layer has come to a crossroads: staying ionomer-impregnated or going ionomer-free. It is always beneficial to look back into the past when coming to a crossroads. This paper addresses the characterization and modeling of both the conventional ionomer-impregnated catalyst layer and the emerging ionomer-free UTCLs, featuring advances in characterizing microscale distributions of Pt particles, ionomer, support particles and unraveling their interactions; advances in fundamental understandings of proton conduction and flooding behaviors in ionomer-free UTCLs; advances in modeling of conventional catalyst layers and especially UTCLs; and discussions on high-impact research topics in characterizing and modeling of catalyst layers.									61	5	0	0	3	0	65			2095-1701	2095-1698		WOS:000410770500012

Drought stress induced increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase was higher in PR202 and VL315, while the activity was lower in the varieties PES400 and VR708. Ascorbate peroxidase : superoxide dismutase ratio, which is a crucial factor in alleviating drought stress, was higher in varieties PR202 and VL315, whilst the varieties PES400 and VR708 exhibited a lower ratio under stress. The variety PES400 recorded maximum stress induced damage, as indicated by higher accumulation of malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide; whereas the variety PR202 recorded least stress induced cytotoxic damage. The results clearly indicate that better drought tolerance of the variety PR202 is positively related to the capacity of its antioxidant system to scavenge reactive oxygen species, resulting in a reduced incidence of oxidative damage. Ascorbate peroxidase : superoxide dismutase ratio is found to be a critical factor governing the stress tolerance potential of different varieties.

In the complexes of pyrimidine-2-carboxylic acid of the general formula M(2PCA)(2)center dot xH(2)O (where 2PCA-pyrimidine-2-carboxylate; M = Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn; x = 0 for Mn and Cu; x = 2 for Co, Ni and Zn) coordination of metal ions occurs through nitrogen atom from pyrimidine ring and carboxylate oxygen atom. The complexes of pyrimidine-5-carboxylic acid of the general formula M(5PCA)(2)center dot xH(2)O (where 5PCA-pyrimidine-5-carboxylate; M = Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn; x = 6 for Cu and 4 for remaining complexes) were obtained as monomeric isostructural compounds. Coordination of metal centers occurs through two nitrogen atom from different pyrimidine-5-carboxylate ligand and four oxygen atoms from water molecules. The IR and Raman spectra of free acids as well as obtained metal(II) complexes were described in detail. Aromaticity (HOMA, EN, GEO and I-6) of complexes was determined and discussed. The investigated compounds decompose in air in two main stages connected with dehydration and decomposition/burning of anhydrous compounds to the suitable metal oxides. Thermal decomposition in nitrogen leads to the evolution of water, carbon oxides, ammonia and pyrimidine molecules.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000499703500042

Grown nanowires were well aligned and had good crystallinity with evolution of preferred orientation (0 0 2). Both EDX and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) results revealed that phosphorus atoms were incorporated in the ZnO nanowires with the content of less than 1%. The XRD results confirmed an increase in lattice spacing which is attributed to substitution of P on oxygen sites. The photoluminescence spectra of grown nanowires showed a strong emission peak at 3.248 eV with a shoulder at 3.184 eV, corresponding with FA (free electron to acceptor) and DAP (donor-acceptor pair) levels of P-doped ZnO. The lattice spacing from HRTEM agrees with the achieved results from XRD measurement. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

Here, by using wild-type, Asc-overproducing, and -deficient Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants (miox4 and vtc2-3, respectively), we investigated the physiological role of Asc as PSII electron donor in heat-stressed leaves (40 degrees C, 15 min), lacking active oxygen-evolving complexes. Chlorophyll-alpha fluorescence transients show that in leaves excited with trains of saturating single-turnover flashes spaced 200 ms apart, allowing continual electron donation from Asc to PSII, the reaction centers remained functional even after thousands of turnovers. Higher flash frequencies or continuous illumination (300 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) gradually inactivated them, a process that appeared to be initiated by a dramatic deceleration of the electron transfer from Tyr(Z) to P680(+), followed by the complete loss of charge separation activity. These processes occurred with half-times of 1.2 and 10 min, 2.8 and 23 min, and 4.1 and 51 min in vtc2-3, the wild type, and miox4, respectively, indicating that the rate of inactivation strongly depended on the Asc content of the leaves. The recovery of PSII activity, following the degradation of PSII proteins (D1, CP43, and PsbO), in moderate light (100 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), comparable to growth light), was also retarded in the Asc-deficient mutant. These data show that high Asc content of leaves contributes significantly to the ability of plants to withstand heat-stress conditions.									96	5	3	0	89	0	104			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000290207100030	21357184

Here, the authors present an in situ dual doping strategy to construct efficient CO2-to-methanol electrocatalysts.Methanol is a highly desirable product of CO2 electroreduction due to its wide array of industrial applications. However, the development of CO2-to-methanol electrocatalysts with high performance is still challenging. Here we report an operationally simple in situ dual doping strategy to construct efficient CO2-to-methanol electrocatalysts. In particular, when using Ag,S-Cu2O/Cu as electrocatalyst, the methanol Faradaic efficiency (FE) could reach 67.4% with a current density as high as 122.7 mA cm(-2) in an H-type cell using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate/H2O as the electrolyte, while the current density was below 50 mA cm(-2) when the FE was greater than 50% over the reported catalysts. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the anion S can effectively adjust the electronic structure and morphology of the catalysts in favor of the methanol pathway, whereas the cation Ag suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction. Their synergistic interactions with host material enhance the selectivity and current density for methanol formation. This work opens a way for designing efficient catalysts for CO2 electroreduction to methanol.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2041-1723		WOS:000782204100005	35413956

We investigate constraints on explosive conditions derivable from measured amounts of nickel and iron after radioactive decays using nucleosynthesis networks with parameterized thermodynamic trajectories. The Ni/Fe ratio is for most regimes dominated by the production ratio of Ni-58/(Fe-54 + Ni-56), which tends to grow with higher neutron excess and with higher entropy. For SN 2012ec, a supernova (SN) that produced a Ni/Fe ratio of 3.4 +/- 1.2 times solar, we find that burning of a fuel with neutron excess eta approximate to 6 x 10(-3) is required. Unless the progenitor metallicity is over five times solar, the only layer in the progenitor with such a neutron excess is the silicon shell. SNe producing large amounts of stable nickel thus suggest that this deep-lying layer can be, at least partially, ejected in the explosion. We find that common spherically symmetric models of M-ZAMS less than or similar to 13 M-circle dot stars exploding with a delay time of less than one second (M-cut < 1.5 M-circle dot) are able to achieve such silicon-shell ejection. SNe that produce solar or subsolar Ni/Fe ratios, such as SN 1987A, must instead have burnt and ejected only oxygen-shell material, which allows a lower limit to the mass cut to be set. Finally, we find that the extreme Ni/Fe value of 60-75 times solar derived for the Crab cannot be reproduced by any realistic entropy burning outside the iron core, and neutrino-neutronization obtained in electron capture models remains the only viable explanation.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000358945200110

To better understand the biology of the gray whale Eschrichtius robustus (Lilljeborg, 1861), we sequenced the genome and produced an assembly that contains similar to 95% of the genes known to be highly conserved among eukaryotes. From this assembly, we annotated 22,711 genes and identified 2,057,254 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Using this assembly, we generated a curated list of candidate genes potentially subject to strong natural selection, including genes associated with osmoregulation, oxygen binding and delivery, and other aspects of marine life. From these candidate genes, we queried 92 autosomal protein-coding markers with a panel of 96 SNPs that also included 2 sexing and 2 mitochondrial markers. Genotyping error rates, calculated across loci and across 69 intentional replicate samples, were low (0.021%), and observed heterozygosity was 0.33 averaged over all autosomal markers. This level of variability provides substantial discriminatory power across loci (mean probability of identity of 1.6 x 10(-25) and mean probability of exclusion >0.999 with neither parent known), indicating that these markers provide a powerful means to assess parentage and relatedness in gray whales. We found 29 unique multilocus genotypes represented among our 36 biopsies (indicating that we inadvertently sampled 7 whales twice). In total, we compiled an individual data set of 28 western gray whales (WGSs) and 1 presumptive eastern gray whale (EGW). The lone EGW we sampled was no more or less related to the WGWs than expected by chance alone. The gray whale genomes reported here will enable comparative studies of natural selection in cetaceans, and the SNP markers should be highly informative for future studies of gray whale evolution, population structure, demography, and relatedness.									19	0	0	0	17	0	19			0006-3185	1939-8697		WOS:000410562000004	28898601

The thylakoid membranes used as starting material were isolated from cells treated with red light to increase the relative PS II content. The cell walls were broken in a glass-bead cell disruptor. The isolated thylakoids were pretreated with 0.01% dodecyl beta-maltoside, followed by solubilization in 2.5% Triton X-100 to selectively extract photosystem I. The membrane residue, still containing PS II, was collected by a rapid differential centrifugation. The isolation PS II membranes possess rates of oxygen evolution as high as 2800-3200-mu-mol O2/Mg Chl h, and a low proportion of contaminating photosystem I. The yield of PS II is 30-35% on a PS II activity basis. Typically, PS II membranes corresponding to 2 mg of chlorophyll could be obtained within 6 h of preparative work, including the cell breakage. The purity and high intactness of the material allowed EPR analysis of various PS II parameters, including signal II(slow) and the S2 state multiline signal. Considering the simplicity of the subfractionation procedure, the high yield and functional intactness, this preparation should have the potential of playing the same important experimental role for studying PS II in Synechocystis 6803 as the so called BBY-preparation has played for studies on PS II from plants. In particular, the preparation should be essential for studies on structure-function relations after site-directed mutagenesis of various PS II subunits in Synechocystis 6803 cells.									14	0	0	0	12	0	14			0006-3002			WOS:A1992JB81500004

The influences of calcination temperature on morphology, crystalline structure, purity and the atomic compositions of samples were studied. The photocatalytic performance of LaFeO3 was evaluated though the photodegradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light. In this research, the orthorhombic LaFeO3 nanoparticles showed band gaps in the range of 2.15-2.30 eV. The particle size increased with increasing in the calcination temperature, leading to the decreasing in the surface area. The LaFeO3 sample calcined at 900 degrees C showed the highest photodegradation of 77.8% and the apparent rate constant of 0.0077 min(-1) within 180 min because of the narrower of band gap and the higher crystalline degree and oxygen adsorption.									40	0	0	0	2	0	40			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000458228200082

Based on the results, a mechanism for the catalytic activity of the composite is proposed.

Here a group of P450BM3 mutants (R47I/A82F/A328F, R47L/YS1F/F87V/L188P/I401P, R47I/YS1F/F87V, R47L/YS1F/F87V/L181Q/L188P/I401P, and R47I/F87V/L188P) were developed as unique catalysts for the p-hydroxylation of m-alkylphenols la-e with high regioselectivity (91-99%) and conversion (95-99%) to produce the corresponding useful and valuable m-alkylbenzene-1,4-diols 2a-e, respectively. The mutated hydroxylases were developed by protein engineering of P450BM3 monooxygenase via site-directed mutagenesis based on designed mutations to reshape the substrate binding pocket and access channel. Several engineered P450BM3 mutants showed good catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K-M of 234-381 mM(-1) min(-1)) for the p-hydroxylations of m-alkylphenols la-e, respectively. Molecular docking and simulation gave some insights into the structure-based understanding of the enhanced regioselectivity and activity for the developed P450BM3 mutants, including the shorter distance between heme-oxygen atom and C4-carbon (p-position) of substrates than the wild-type enzyme in the catalytic pockets. Preparative biohydroxylations of malkylphenols 1a-e were demonstrated by using E. coli cells coexpressing individual P450BM3 mutants and glucose dehydrogenase GDH, giving high-yielding synthesis of useful and valuable m-alkylbenzene-1,4-diols 2a-e.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000821349700001

It can be activated by either chemical catalysis or electrochemical processes, both of which are limited by low catalytic efficiency. In this study, electrochemical oxidation and advanced oxidation of PMS on a NiCo2O4 nanoarray cathode were integrated to decompose Rhodamine B (RhB). The combined method exhibited faster decolourisation rates and increased reaction efficiencies compared to systems using either electrochemistry or PMS alone. The effects of pH, PMS dosage, initial RhB concentration, and current density were investigated. The activation of PMS (2 g.L-1) under a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) at neutral pH showed a high decolourisation efficiency of 99.7 % for the RhB solution (100 mg L-1) in 60 min. The corresponding total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency was 28.9 %. The electrode could be reused for at least four cycles while maintaining its high activity. Furthermore, scavenging experiments were conducted with various radical scavengers to identify the major ROSs. Our mechanistic study suggested that O-2(center dot)- and O-1(2) play key roles in the degradation process. A synergistic effect was promoted by combining electrochemical and chemical processes for PMS activation. The results presented herein provide fundamental insight into advanced oxidation processes with PMS.									19	0	0	0	6	0	19			2214-7144			WOS:000575571500006

Electron microscopic observations show that clay mineral flakes were generated in all experiments. In komatiite/peridotite reaction systems, fibrous actinolite was generated in experiments conducted at higher temperatures (>400 degrees C). Different carbonate species were produced in experiments conducted at temperatures no higher than 400 degrees C. Formation of these carbonates and their diverse crystal habits may indicate varied extraction rates of calcium, magnesium and SiO2 from the original ultramafic rocks resulted from different experimental temperatures. Our results imply that clay minerals and carbonates could probably be formed extensively in the early Hadean by the intense interaction between the ultramafic rocky crust and the H2O-CO2 atmosphere before the formation of the earliest ocean. Rapid sequestration of the atmospheric CO2 caused by the massive precipitation of carbonates might have led to the rapid cooling of the Earth's atmosphere and the formation of the earliest oceans.									4	2	0	0	1	0	4				2296-6463		WOS:000454080600001

Even though significant efforts have been devoted to fabricate advanced nanocomposite materials, the main challenge persists, which is lower efficiency and selectivity towards H-2 evolution under solar energy. In this review, recent developments in photo-catalysts, fabrication of novel heterojunction constructions and factors influencing the photocatalytic process for dynamic H-2 production have been discussed. In the mainstream, recent developments in TiO2 and g-C3N4 based photo-catalysts and their potential for H-2 production are extensively studied. The improvements have been classified as strategies to improve different factors of photocatalytic water splitting such as Z-scheme systems and influence of operating parameters such as band gap, morphology, temperature, light intensity, oxygen vacancies, pH, and sacrificial reagents. Moreover, thermodynamics for selective photocatalytic H-2 production are critically discussed. The advances in photo-reactors and their role to provide more light distribution and surface area contact between catalyst and light were systematically described. By applying the optimum operating parameters and new engineering approach on photoreactor, the efficiency of semiconductor photocatalysts for H-2 production can be enhanced. The future research and perspectives for photocatalytic water splitting were also suggested. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Stoichiometric ALN films without oxygen impurities can be prepared by adding 10 % H-2 to reactive gas, which is proven by Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RES). The bonding aspects of Al, N, O and H atoms in AW:H films have been examined by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) to understand the effects of Hz addition. The chemical shift of the binding energies of Al, N and O atoms in AlN:H films from XPS analysis and the change of N-H bonding in FTIR with respect to different partial pressures of H-2 gas have been confirmed. The role of H atoms is suggested to facilitate bonding with unbound N atoms in AlN:H films and hinder N-O bonding, thus, reducing oxygen concentration in AlN:H films. Also, the activation energy for the evolution of H-2 gas from AIN:H film has been determined to be 0.11 eV/atom through a Kissinger-type analysis by a thermal desorption test using Gas Chromatograph(GC). This result implies that the hydrogen atom in film forms the hydrogen bond.

Here, the electronic structures as well as the optical properties of pristine, mono-doped (N/P/Sb) and codoped (Sb, N/P) anatase TiO2 have been systematically investigated based on density functional theory calculations. It is found that mono-doped TiO2 exhibits either unoccupied or partially occupied intermediate state within the energy gap, which promotes the recombination of electron-hole pairs. However, the presence of (Sb, N/P) codopant not only effectively reduces the width of bandgap by introducing delocalized occupied intermediate states, but also adjusts the band edge alignment to enhance the hydrogen evolution activity of TiO2. Moreover, the optical absorption spectrum for (Sb, N/P) codoped TiO2, which is favored under oxygen-rich condition, demonstrates the improvement of its visible light absorption. These findings will promote the potential application of (Sb, N/P) codoped TiO2 photocatalysis for water splitting under visible light irradiation.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			0217-9792	1793-6578		WOS:000396118100005

The evolution of the pyramidal defects is dominated by the growth rate of an emergent core of inversion domain (typically 100 nm in size). The inversion domains nucleate at a thin band of oxygen containing amorphous material (2-5 nm in thickness), being remnant contamination from the mechano-chemical polishing technique used to prepare the substrates prior to growth. Apart from pyramidal hillocks, the flat-topped hillocks art: also formed. The arguments are presented on the association between these features and the core dislocations, which constitute the source of the growth steps. Improvement in the substrate polishing procedures allowed the effective elimination of these surface hillocks. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Herein, we report the integration of NiSe2 nanoparticles on the surface of Fe2O3 films for the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. The resulting heterostructure photoanode exhibited significantly enhanced PEC performance with a current density enlarged by 50%. The investigations on mechanism reveals that a built-in electric field was formed to accelerate the charge transfer and separation, the charge carrier concentration was significantly enhanced by the formation of oxygen vacancies induced by NiSe2, the lifetime of photogenerated electrons and holes were substantially prolongated due to the suppression of recombination by the surface passivation and promoted surface kinetics for water oxidation by of Se-O species. This work brings inspiration to integrate multifunctional modifiers on photoelectrodes that allows for addressing several issues simultaneously and consequently improving the PEC performance for hydrogen production via water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2352-9407			WOS:000824142200002

In the present study, we discovered a novel manganese superoxide dismutase (PmMnSOD) gene from the marine dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum, examined its molecular characteristics, and evaluated its transcriptional responses to the oxidative stress-inducing contaminants, CuSO4 and NaOCl. Its cDNA was 1238 bp and contained a dinoflagellate spliced leader sequence, a 906 bp open reading frame (301 amino acids), and a poly (A) tail. The gene was coded on the nuclear genome with one 174 bp intron; signal peptide analysis showed that it might be localized to the mitochondria. Real-time PCR analysis revealed an increase in gene expression of MnSOD and SOD activity when P. minimum cells were separately exposed to CuSO4 and NaOCl. In addition, both contaminants considerably decreased chlorophyll autofluorescence, and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species. These results suggest that dinoflagellate MnSOD may be involved in protecting cells against oxidative damage.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0301-4851	1573-4978		WOS:000503243500027	31407247

Herein, we implemented a decoupling scheme of light harvesting and electrocatalysis by employing a back-buried junction (BBJ) PEC cell design, which enables >95% front side light-harvesting, whereas the electrochemical reaction in conjunction with carrier separation/transport/collection occurs on the back side of the PEC cell. The resultant silicon BBJ-PEC half-cell produces a current density of 40.51mAcm(-2) for hydrogen evolution by minimizing optical, electrical, and catalytic losses (as low as 6.11, 1.76, and 1.67mAcm(-2), respectively). Monolithic fabrication also enables three BBJ-PEC cells to be connected in series as a single module, enabling unassisted solar water-splitting with a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 15.62% and a hydrogen generation rate of 240 mu gcm(-2) h(-1). The simultaneous management of optical, electrical, and catalytic properties is challenging for photoelectrochemical devices. Here, authors design Si back-buried junction photoelectrodes that can be series connected for unassisted water-splitting with a high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 15.62%.									29	0	0	0	2	0	29			2041-1723			WOS:000561122000007	32764537

The room temperature structure and its evolution with temperature was investigated using both electron microscopy (TEM and HREM) and powder diffraction (X-ray and neutron) techniques combined with DSC measurements. HfV2O7 exhibits two temperature-induced phase transitions between room temperature and 480 K. Over the highest transition (370 K), HfV2O7 crystallizes in a cubic system with a cell parameter of 8.75 Angstrom and Pa(3) over bar space group. A negative thermal expansion is observed in this high temperature phase and can be correlated to anisotropic oxygen atom displacements. On the other hand, the room temperature structure of HfV2O7 is also described in a cubic symmetry, but the existence of superstructure reflections leads to a cell parameter three times larger than for the high temperature structure (similar to 26.25 Angstrom) Moreover, HREM calculations have shown that the atomic positions, usually used to describe the superstructures of the ZrV2O7 compounds, cannot be used in the case of HfV2O7 at room temperature.									23	4	0	0	0	0	25			1286-0042	1286-0050		WOS:000087323700003

In recent years a great progress has been made to realize both the higher nitride phase (Zr3N4) and the higher oxynitride phase (Zr2ON2) in more ordered crystal structures. In this work the above-mentioned two phases are realized by RF magnetron sputtering technique. The characterization results, illustrated in the present paper, push towards the evidence of an evolution from zirconium N-rich nitride to the oxynitride films by introducing a very small percentage (0.5%) of water vapor in a sputtering atmosphere made only of nitrogen gas. In particular, structural analysis identified zirconium N-rich nitride as c-Zr3N4 and zirconium oxynitride as c-Zr2ON2. The formation of zirconium oxynitride is due to oxygen presence, coming from the water dissociation in the plasma. Both phases request an additional energy supplied by substrate bias assistance for c-Zr3N4 and by more energetic particles reflected by the Zr target for c-Zr2ON2. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

An overall picture of the interface chemistry evolution as a function of the growth parameters in relation to the effects of the postgrowth reoxidation process is reported. The films were grown in an N(2)O environment at temperatures higher than 900 degrees C and subsequently reoxidized at 1000 degrees C in a dry oxygen environment. The results show that the chemistry of the oxynitride layer progressively changes by moving toward the silicon interface and, after the reoxidation process, the interface chemical configurations are strongly affected by the initial specific oxynitridation process. In particular, the application of the final reoxidation plays a significative role in determining the distribution of the oxidized O-N-Si(2) bonds near the interface.

Diphase stoichiometry was confirmed by the phase analysis, for undoped composition presence of ferromagnetic SrM with complex magnetoplumbite structural phase and hexagonal structural phase with P63/mmc space group was confirmed. Further, doping of BCZT suppressed the secondary phase appeared (Fe2O3) and caused increase in lattice constants. Fourier Transform Infra-Red study revealed the presence of absorption bands of phases.

In this work, crude glycerol was evaluated as biofuel for fuel cells applications on PdBi nanomaterials synthesized by a green chemical method involving protic ionic liquids. Bismuth at different concentrations (15, 55, 70 and 83%) promoted electronic and morphological shifts. Atomically-dispersed Pd catalyst was found in the Pd85Bi15/C material. While, the increase of Bi content formed hemispherical nanoparticles and then, in a composition of Pd17Bi83/C, 2D materials were found. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that bismuth was in form of Bi2O3 and Bi(OH)(3). Pd30Bi70/C and Pd17Bi83/C were the two electrocatalysts with the highest activity for the crude glycerol electro-oxidation reaction, achieving current densities of 244.17 and 237.67 mA mg(Pd)(1). These two current densities values represented 207 and 88% of that obtained for pure glycerol oxidation. Additionally, these current densities were higher than those values reported for Pd-based materials, and Pd17Bi83/C was the most stable material retaining the activity during 500 cycles, being most stable than other materials found in literature based on Pt-group metals. The results herein presented reveal that bismuth is a strong candidate as an economically viable and functional co-catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000861070000004

In this study, a model powder system of Y2O3 and Ti was designed to investigate the formation and evolution mechanism of Y-Ti-O oxides. The morphology of powders tended to be stable after high energy ball milling for 240 min in Ar. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results suggested that there was no formation of new phase after mechanical milling. Thermo-gravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) was applied to analyze physical and chemical reactions of milled powders respectively in Ar and air. The corresponding annealing and XRD were performed to study the types and structures of oxides at different temperatures. It shows that oxygen concentration and temperature are the critical factors affecting the formation of oxides. Ti was evolved into Ti6O, Ti3O and TiO2 in turn with temperature increasing. Then only TiO2 was reacted with Y2O3 to form Y2Ti2O7. The formation of Y2Ti2O7 began at around 500 celcius and was completed around 1004 celcius. A maximum formation rate occurred at about 779 celcius. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) suggested that the main phase in powders sintered at 1100 celcius was identified as pyrochlore structure Y2Ti2O7.(c) 2021 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

The size and crystal phase of Fe-based NPs were characterized using DLS and HR-TEM techniques, respectively. The metastable suspension of FeO, Fe3O4, and Fe2O3 nanoparticles was used to the decoration of anodized TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2-NTs) by means of the ultrasonic bath. SEM inspection confirms preservation of the ordered morphology even upon 60 min long exposition to the ultrasounds whereas TOF SIMS indicated penetration of iron species down to the TiO2-NTs base. Finally, the electrochemical investigation of decorated and bare TiO2-NTs has shown a response typical for Fe2+/Fe3+ iron species and the boosted activity towards oxygen evolution reaction in the anodic regime. As of high importance, for the 30 min long ultrasound-assisted modification, the photocurrent was enhanced almost 2.5 times comparing to the pristine material exposed to the solar light, although differences in optical properties were negligible. Taking into account outstanding activity namely response upon irradiation and effectiveness of water splitting, the proposed approach can be regarded as a facile one generating much less waste in comparison to typical wet-chemistry methods.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000562344700001

In order to predict the behavior under normal conditions, which is difficult to be obtained within a relative short period for the slow reaction between the glasses and aqueous medias, the static leaching method(PCT) was employed to accelerate the corrosion evolution of the glass with S/V=6 000 m-1 at 150 ℃.SEM-EDS and XRD, respectively, were used for the analysis of the glass surface micro-morphological characterization and the secondary minerals produced by the alteration of the glass, and ICP-AES for the concentration determination of the elements in the leaching solution. In our experiments, the aluminosilicates and phyllosolicates with honeycomb structure rich in Mg and Fe were found to form on the simulated HLW glass surface when it was subjected to a long-term leaching in the high brine groundwater.

Asynchronous and synchronized by light/dark regime (14/10 h) cultures of D. subspicatus were used to explain the effects of CM/2 on photosynthesis as well as growth and reproductive processes of cell cycle of the producer. During the light period, all control cells attained three commitment points (CP) triggering the reproductive processes and 20% of them, additionally the fourth one. This resulted in the formation of mainly eight and partly 16 autospores released from the parent cell during the dark period of the cell cycle. CM/2 markedly increased the number of cells that attained the fourth CP. Chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, measured by OJIP test (O, J, I, and P-different steps of fluorescence induction curve), were applied to explain stimulatory effect of CM/2 on the rate of oxygen evolution. The number of cells as well as the parameter of their "vitality" (P.I) determined by OJIP analysis were equally enhanced by CM/2. The maximum yield of electron trapping and transport, as well as the fraction of active reaction centers, was also significantly higher in CM/2. The cells quickly produced and released CM factor (CMF) to the culture medium; its highest activity was observed in the middle light phase of the cell cycle. Dialysis, ion exchange chromatography, and solid-phase extraction with C-18 allowed reproducible extraction of the active compound from CM. Subjecting the extract to reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography led to one active fraction eluted as a peak with the shortest retention time indicating its hydrophilicity.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			0921-8971	1573-5176		WOS:000279592900018

Herein, we report a facile anaerobic catalytic combustion method using a volatile organic compound (CH2Cl2) as a reactant for controllable construction of oxygen vacancies (V-O) in TiO2 for enhanced solar-to-hydrogen conversion. This strategy has the general applicability for the preparation of V-O enriched metal oxides including TiO2 (001), rutile TiO2, MoO3, ZnO, and WO3. The results of photocatalytic tests show V-O-dependent photocatalytic H-2 production activities under both visible light and solar light irradiation. The surface V-O on TiO2 enable the visible light harvesting of TiO2 and provide adsorption sites for H-2 evolution, and most importantly, they as charge carrier traps facilitate the separation of the photogenerated charges by intrinsic excitation with UV light irradiation, leading to greatly enhanced overall solar light activity of TiO2. However, bulk V-O as the recombination centers hamper the photogenerated charge separation process, causing significantly decreased visible light and solar light photocatalytic activities. Moreover, we find that the synergistic effects of Pt cocatalysts and V-O further enhance the solar-to-hydrogen conversion over TiO2. This work provides a general guide for constructing V-O on various metal oxide semiconductors and offers scope for the future development of V-O enriched metal oxide photocatalysts for efficient solar energy conversion.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2398-4902			WOS:000487670300018

In oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, CtpA catalyzes C-terminal processing of the D1 protein of photosystem II, an essential event for the assembly of a manganese cluster and consequent light-mediated water oxidation. We introduced site-specific mutations at 14 conserved residues of CtpA in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to examine their functional roles. Analysis of the photoautotrophic growth capabilities of these mutants, their ability to process precursor D1 protein and hence evolve oxygen, along with an estimation of the protease content in the mutants revealed that five of these residues are critical for in vivo activity of CtpA. Recent x-ray crystal structure analysis of CtpA from the eukaryotic alga Scenedesmus obliquus (Liao, D.-I., Qian, J., Chisholm, D. A., Jordan, D. B. and Diner, B. A. (2000) Nat. Struct. Biol. 7, 749-753) has shown that the residues equivalent to Ser-313 and Lys-338, two of the five residues mentioned above, form the catalytic center of this enzyme. Our in vivo analysis demonstrates that the three other residues, Asp-253, Arg-255, and Glu-316, are also important determinants of the catalytic activity of CtpA.									23	3	1	0	19	0	26			0021-9258			WOS:000170558000067	11408480

In recent years, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have demonstrated great potential for the targeted creation of single/dual-atom and cluster catalysts, featuring the distinctive advantages of high metal loadings, porous structures and tailorable catalytic sites. In this review, we discuss the key roles and the critical issues of single/dual-atom and cluster catalysts, and the great opportunities furnished by MOFs for the construction strategy. The accessible characterization techniques for single/dual-atom and cluster catalysts will be showcased. Furthermore, we highlight recent advances in the construction and energy applications of MOF-based single/dual-atom and cluster catalysts by taking advantage of structural features of MOFs. Current issues, promising ideas and future prospects for MOF-based single/dual-atom and cluster catalysts are given.									176	14	0	0	10	0	177			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000544033100006

Mixed metal oxides anodes are particularly attractive due to their low cost and specific catalytic properties. Here, we report the synthesis of a new Ti/RuO2-IrO2 anode fabricated through an innovative eco-friendly methodology using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as the solvent. Comparative anodes were also prepared by the conventional method of polymeric precursors. For both methods, anodes were calcined at 300, 400, and 500 degrees C. X-ray diffraction data confirmed the formation of RuO2 and IrO2 in the ruffle-type structure for all conditions. Moreover, compared to conventional polymeric precursor method, PVA-made anode obtained at 300 degrees C presented increased voltammetric charge (210%), besides reduced charge-transfer resistance (1.8-fold lower). Electrochemical degradation of the Reactive Blue 21 dye showed that the PVA-made Ti/RuO2-IrO2 anode has the highest degradation efficiency, and its kinetic rate constant is until 2 times greater than the conventional anode. Besides, due to rougher and more compact surfaces, the better adhesion of the film observed for the PVA-made anodes, the accelerated service lifetime of the anode was prolonged 4.3-fold.

High-resolution compositional analysis in combination with high lateral resolution are presented in the format of a 2D map with 50 nm resolution for Ni, Y, Ce, Gd, La, Sr, Co, Fe. We report on the different elements that are diffusing already during the sintering process as well as their evolution after long-term operation. In both type of cell, Co is the element that is highly segregating from the LSCF electrode during the electrochemical reaction. The CGO barrier does not prevent the diffusion of Sr in the electrolyte of the CSC cell while it does in the ESC cell. In addition, the contact layer between the hydrogen electrode and the electrolyte in the ESC cell seems to prevent the Ni depletion. A high concentration of gadolinium from the CGO layer is visible at the CGO/electrolyte interface on the oxygen electrode side as well as on the hydrogen electrode side in the ESC cell. The gadolinium concentration significantly increases during the cell operation to form a layer of a few micrometers.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000464487000013

Ore bodies mainly consist of gold-bearing hydrothermal veins, mineralized basalt and tuff with disseminated sulfides. Hydrothermal process could be identified based on ore petrographic studies: quartz-albite-sulfide-native gold (stage I), arsenopyrite-calcite-native gold (II), and pyrite-calcite (III). Microthermometric and laser Raman spectroscopic analysis of fluid inclusions in quartz demonstrate the ore-forming fluid at stage I was moderate temperature (360-398 degrees C), low salinity (0.5-5.1 wt% NaCI equiv), and H2O-CH4-dominant, which evolved to low-salinity (0.2-1.2 wt% NaCl equiv) with insignificant content of CH4 at 219-267 degrees C (stage III). Contents of ore elements (As, Au, Cu, Sb, Ba, Cs, Rb) in mineralized basalt are higher than those in fresh basalt. Phase analysis for the Au-As-Fe-S system using SUPCRT92 software package with the updated database of slop98.dat indicates that a decrease of H2S activity and oxygen fugacity, caused by phase separation and fluid-rock reactions, induced native gold precipitation at stage I. The decrease of H2S activity triggered by arsenopyrite crystallization caused native gold deposition at stage II. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For the efficient hydrogen generation from water, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has to be optimized, which requires a highly efficient electrocatalyst. In this work, a hybrid structure of the ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate (C(2)mim TfO) and (TiO2)(n) nanoclusters with n = 2-12 has been investigated in the pursuit of new catalyst materials for effective HER. We have employed state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) computations to depict the HER catalytic performance of IL/(TiO2)(n) hybrid systems through Gibbs free energy (Delta G) and an exchange-current-based "volcano" plot. We have explored the effect of the TiO2 nanoclusters on the structural and electronic characteristics of the IL, calculating the adsorption energy, the energies of the highest occupied (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO), the HOMO-LUMO band gap E-g, and the work function phi. The variation in size of the TiO2 nanocluster in the IL/(TiO2)(n) hybrid system was found to have a significant influence on the electronic properties. The obtained results suggest that the Delta G of the hydrogen adsorption is remarkably close to the ideal value (0 eV) for the IL/(TiO2)(5) system, which also reflects from the volcano plot, suggesting that this complex is the best HER catalyst among the studied systems; it might be even better than the traditional Pt-based catalyst. Thus, the present work suggests ways for the experimental realization of low-cost and multifunctional IL-based hybrid catalysts for clean and renewable hydrogen energy production.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000636918400026	33734710

A shift in primary carbon metabolism is the fastest response to oxidative stress. A (CO2)-C-14 evolution study, expression of glucose transporters together with consumption assays, indicated a shift in metabolic flux of the parasites from glycolysis toward pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) when exposed to different oxidants in vitro/ex vivo. Changes in gene expression, protein levels, and enzyme activities all pointed to a metabolic reconfiguration of the central glucose metabolism in response to oxidants. Generation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) (similar to 5-fold) and transaldolase (TAL) (similar to 4.2-fold) overexpressing Ld cells reaffirmed that lethal doses of ROS were counterbalanced by effective manipulation of NADPH:NADP(+) ratio and stringent maintenance of reduced thiol content. The extent of protein carbonylation and accumulation of lipid peroxidized products were also found to be less in overexpressed cell lines. Interestingly, the LD50 of sodium antimony gluconate (SAG), amphotericin-B (AmB), and miltefosine were significantly high toward overexpressing parasites. Consequently, this study illustrates that Ld strategizes a metabolic reconfiguration for replenishment of NADPH pool to encounter oxidative challenges.									30	1	0	0	28	0	31			0892-6638	1530-6860		WOS:000354114600040	25690656

Hydrogen at high pressures in fast hydropyrolysis aids in improving the H/C ratio of bio-oil through deoxygenation pathways such as dehydration, decarboxylation and decarbonylation. The main objectives of this study are to understand the composition of organics and the time evolution of various functional groups during fast hydropyrolysis of pine sawdust at different temperatures, pressures, and in the presence of a catalyst. Analytical fast pyrolysis experiments were conducted in a Pyroprobe(R)reactor interfaced with a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. At high hydrogen partial pressures (10 and 20 bar), significant production of hydrocarbons, in contrast to undesirable oxygen-containing compounds at low pressures, was observed. Moreover, it resulted in a minor increase in the yield of pyrolysates and char, while the yields of pyrolysates and char increased and decreased, respectively, as the temperature was increased at high hydrogen partial pressures. The overall yield of condensable pyrolysates from hydropyrolysis was notably higher as compared to that from pyrolysis in inert atmosphere. The use of a stainless steel catalyst tube in the Pyroprobe(R)improved the formation of hydrocarbons as compared to that of a quartz tube at high pressures. Upgradation of pyrolysis vapors evolved from hydropyrolysis of pine sawdust at 500 degrees C and 20 bar over the catalyst bed maintained at 500 degrees C resulted in selective production of aromatic hydrocarbons (12% C-6, 32% C-7, 20% C-8, 9% C-9, 7% C-10, and 4% C-11). The isothermal mass loss data at short residence times were obtained using the analytical Pyroprobe(R), and the apparent rate constants were determined using a 3D-diffusion model. Pyrolysis-FTIR data substantiate the significant increase in methane production with the increase in pressure. Pyrolysate composition data from Py-FTIR and Py-GC/MS techniques at various pressures were assimilated to develop a reaction scheme to describe non-catalytic and catalytic hydropyrolysis of biomass.									10	0	0	0	3	0	10			2058-9883			WOS:000552882200011

Herein, self-supported hierarchical electrodes comprising nickel foam (NF) and porous molybdenum phosphide (MoP) nanoflakes are fabricated by first growing MoO2 nanoflakes on Ni foam and then further phosphorization treatment. Remarkably, serving as both anode and cathode catalysts in a two-electrode alkaline water-electrolysis system, the designed electrodes only require a potential of 1.62 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This performance is close to that of the noble-metal-based electrodes, that is, integrated RuO2/Ni foam and Ni foam supported Pt/C electrodes. The low cost, facile preparation method, and desirable performance make this MoP/NF electrode a potential electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.									101	10	0	0	6	0	103			2366-9608			WOS:000432035000006

A systematic study of the influence of the VI/II ratio and precursor flow-rates on the morphology of ZnO nanorod arrays has been carried out, taking advantage of the ability of MOCVD to individually control the precursor partial pressures. Growth mechanisms are discussed to understand the evolution of the nanostructures morphology for different growth conditions. In particular, the influence of the gas phase supersaturation on the vertical alignment and aspect ratio of the nanorods is emphasized. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The surface became rougher partially resulted from the nucleation of TiN layer after RTA. Experimental results also indicated that the oxygen content in the HfO2 was desorbed and the remaining Hf was crystallized. Also, the TiN and Al2O3 layers were intermixed and partially re-crystallized at this high temperature. Very clear morie fringes could be observed in the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) micrographs. Also, the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) results indicated that the nitrogen in TiN was desorbed and the TiN was phase transformed to TiO2.

The prepared samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The impact of pH on structure, surface morphology, visible-light photocatalytic activity, and light absorption performance of BiVO4 is explored and discussed. During the synthesis process, neither extremely acidic (low pH) nor basic (high pH) conditions are desirable for the formation of BiVO4 in monoclinic phase. The highest photocatalytic performance on the degradation of a methylene blue solution is observed under pH = 7.0 for BiVO4 in monoclinic scheelite, which is attributed to its small grain size and marked surface oxygen evolution ability.									26	0	0	0	2	0	26			1110-662X	1687-529X		WOS:000307663800001

X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy provide useful information about crystallinity and morphology of the samples. It was found that crystal sizes do not necessarily decrease after calcination-reconstruction. Furthermore, aluminum coordination is studied by (27)Al MAS nuclear magnetic resonance and by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), revealing significant differences in the relative populations of tetrahedral aluminum in the surface and the bulk of the calcined sol-gel LDHs. Magnesium and oxygen structural environments are also studied by XPS. A possible correlation between crystal sizes of calcined LDHs and the amount of O(2)(-) Surface species is discussed. Differences in the structural environment of magnesium in the as-synthesized and the reconstructed LDH are presented and analyzed.									66	2	0	0	4	0	66			1932-7447			WOS:000274269700019

Soft X-ray photoemission (SXPS) is used to analyze the oxidation state of the ceria and the evolution of the SO2-derived species, while thermal desorption spectroscopy is used to analyze the desorption products. The principle interaction is chemisorption of SO2 at oxygen anions, which reversibly desorbs as SO2 over a broad temperature range from 200 to 600 K. This interaction is characterized as a Lewis acid-base interaction and occurs with approximately equal facility if the surface is hydroxylated or sulfided. On reduced ceria the adsorption is more heterogeneous, suggesting a variety of local bending environments, including a small, distinguishable amount of adsorption at Ce3+ sites. A significant portion of the chemisorbed SO2 converts to sulfide above 300 K, and the resulting sulfide then equilibrates between bulk and surface sites above 600 K. Adsorption at a sulfide site leads to a 1.5 eV shift in the sulfide S 2p state toward higher binding energy. Thermal conversion of chemisorbed SO2 to sulfate is not observed. The results are compared with previous studies of NO adsorption on ceria films and with similar studies of SO2 chemisorption on titania.									59	0	0	0	2	0	59			1089-5647			WOS:000084601400012

Herein, atomically controlled synthesis is combined with theoretical calculations, electrochemical studies, and detailed characterization measurements to show that the interface between an oxide catalyst and the solid products is key to selectively control discharge product distribution, consequently affecting charge overpotentials. A surface structure-dependent electrochemical performance for nonprecious metal-containing, nanostructured lanthanum nickelate oxide (La2NiO4+delta, LNO) electrocatalysts is demonstrated. LNO nanostructures with (001) NiO-terminated surfaces exhibit lower charge overpotentials, as opposed to irregularly terminated polyhedral-shaped oxides of the same composition. It is found that these LNO nanostructures, with controlled surface structure, enhance the performance by providing a platform for stabilization of Lideficient oxide species during discharge, consequently lowering overpotential losses associated with their oxidation during charge. Periodic density functional theory modeling of the solid-solid interface between the oxide catalyst and the lithiumdischarge products suggests that stabilization of the Li-deficient products is due to the formation of a lithiated oxide surface, which is in turn facilitated by an electron transfer from the near surface Li to the surface lattice oxygen atoms. The potential-dependent stability of these lithium-oxygen species on LNO is predicted and confirmed experimentally. These results provide a framework for probing and engineering catalysis at solid-solid interfaces, and strategies for improving the efficiency of nextgeneration energy storage systems using nonprecious, nanostructured mixed metal oxide catalysts.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000487859200022

Here, using first-principles-based density functional theory (DFT), we have computationally screened the potential and feasibility of transition-metal phosphorous trisulfides (TMPS3) (100) surfaces as efficient ORR electrocatalyst in acidic fuel cell application. MnPS3(100) surface emerges to be the best among TMPS3 surfaces with optimal O-2 activation resulting in very low overpotential. The study reveals that ORR occurs on the MnPS3 surface via 4e reduction associative pathway where the kinetically rate-determining step (RDS) is the formation of O*+H2O with an activation barrier of 0.66 eV. Additionally, high CO tolerance and easy desorption of H2O make MnPS3 a robust catalyst. Substitution in half of the Mn sites of MnPS3(100) surface with Co considerably enhances the ORR activity. Mn0.5Co0.5PS3(100) surface exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 0.39 V vs RHE switching ORR pathway from associative to dissociative. Spontaneous dissociation of H2O2 on Mn0.5Co0.5PS3 proves 4e reduction pathway excluding 2e one. Electronic structure analysis reveals that pristine MnPS3(100) surface is a narrow band gap semiconductor which upon Co substitution transforms into a conducting metallic surface enhancing ORR activity. Besides, Mn0.5Co0.5PS3(100) surface obtains the apex of the volcano plot due to its optimal position of the d-band center which further justifies the improved ORR activity. With Pt-like onset potential, facile H2O desorption ability, and robust dynamic and thermal stability, this CO tolerant Mn0.5Co0.5PS3 catalyst can be a potential alternative to Pt with encouraging practical viability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000808238800001	35467795

In-situ growth of CoP wrapped by carbon nanoarray-like architecture onto nitrogen-doped Ti3C2 Pt-based catalyst for efficient methanol oxidation								MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY				26						101041	10.1016/j.mtchem.2022.101041				DEC 2022	2022	Herein, we report an efficient bottom-up approach to construct the carbon encapsulated CoP nanoarray-like architectures onto the nitrogen-doped Ti3C2 MXene Pt-based catalyst (Pt-CoP@CNT NA/N-Ti3C2) by employing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as the sacrificial template. Benefiting from the catalytic effect for metals into MOFs and synergistic effect of Ti3C2 substrate, homogenous nanotubes nanoarray-like structure is obtained on Ti3C2 nanosheet. The unique heteroatom-doped 3D connected structure endows the catalyst with distinct structural merits, such as the carbon and nitrogen-enriched structures, large specific surface areas and excellent conductivity, leading to the high dispersion of ultrafine metallic Pt and efficient electronic/mass transfer, contributing to more exposed active sites of Pt surface. The fabricated CoP and doped nitrogen especially for those lattice nitrogen derived from the pristine MOFs can present exceptional co-catalytic effect, resulting in obtaining strong anti-CO poisoning capacity for catalyst. Therefore, the ultrahigh catalytic activity of per Pt active site for methanol oxidation reaction can be preserved. Besides, owing to the strong stability of carrier, the catalyst delivers a reliable long-term stability during the test. This work gives new ideal for the design of novel cost-effective 3D Ti3C2-based nanomaterial catalyst with excellent catalytic activity for methanol oxidation. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Various energy technologies like regenerative fuel cells, zinc-air batteries, and overall water-splitting devices have a huge scope in the growth of green energy. The efficiency of these devices is reliant upon the multifunctional electrocatalysts, which include both bifunctional and trifunctional electrocatalysts. Among the different categories of the materials used for such multifunctional electrocatalysis, metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs) occupy a very consolidated place because of their high surface area, porosity, and many other unique physicochemical properties. However, the use of MOFs for the trifunctional electrocatalytic applications is in the budding phase and needs to be explored more. Further, most of these MOF-based trifunctional electrocatalysts are derived by pyrolyzing MOFs at high temperatures. Therefore, there is a need to develop more conductive MOFs which can be directly utilized for the trifunctional applications. In this frontier article, we present the latest reports on the MOF-based materials for trifunctional applications. The material design strategies of the MOF-based materials for trifunctional electrocatalysis have been discussed. The progressive improvements made with MOFs in electrocatalytic applications have been provided with emphasis on the structural, active site and compositional requirements. Finally, the challenges and viewpoints on the future development of the MOF-based materials for trifunctional electrocatalysis have been provided.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000843652700001	36000481

Metal molybdates have gained great attention because of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These products still need to be improved for practical applications. In this work, SrMoO4 nanostructures were successfully synthesized via trouble-free co-precipitation method. Scheelite-type tetragonal-phase SrMoO4 nanostructures were substantiated using X-ray diffraction. Raman spectra confirmed existence of MoO42- group whereas Fourier transform infrared spectra corroborated different functional groups in well-crystallized SrMoO4 material. Morphologies of the prepared SrMoO4 nanostructures were identified by using the scanning electron microscopy images. The high surface area and porosity of electrocatalysts significantly enhanced the electro-chemical performance. Then, the surface area, pore diameter and pore volume of SM2 were 13 m(2)/g, 4.474 nm and 0.004 cc/g, respectively. The existence of unique flower like morphology and spindle-like rods of SrMoO4 material confirmed the OER activity with elevated 409 F/g specific capacitance. Compared to different molar ratios of SrMoO4 materials, 1:5 M ratios of SrMoO4 nanostructures showed outstanding catalytic action toward OER performance with 187 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and a small 20.5 mV/dec Tafel slope. In addition, SM2 electrode showed better durability in 16 h chronoamperometry test without any decay. Therefore, optimizing the proper molar ratio of SrMoO4 material is one of the important parameters to obtain a good candidate for electrochemical water-splitting applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000706517600004		
J	Siegert, Michael; Tan, Allen								Electric Stimulation of Ammonotrophic Methanogenesis								FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH				7						17	10.3389/fenrg.2019.00017				FEB 28 2019	2019	Reduced nitrogen compounds like ammonium or amines are ubiquitous constituents of wastewater. As a source of electrons, they can be oxidized without producing CO2. This makes them ideal for biogas upgrading in microbial power-to-gas processes in wastewater treatment plants as well as for energy storage. Here, we tested the hypothesis whether ammonium can be oxidized to N-2 while producing energy-rich chemicals such as H-2 or methane. First, we show that ammonium oxidation can be coupled to H-2 production in microbial electrolysis cells. We show that with ammonium and water as the only sources of electrons, N-2 gas was produced at potentials between +550 and +150 mV vs. a standard hydrogen electrode. Since H-2 can neither be stored, nor transported without major upgrades of our infrastructure, we further tested the hypothesis whether wastewater nitrogen can be oxidized and used to produce methane. At a potential of +500 mV, N-2 was produced from domestic wastewater while total nitrogen was removed. We compared two different types of anodes, graphite granule drums and carbon brushes, and found that both were comparable in terms of performance. The drums were slightly better in removing chemical oxygen demand, whereas the brushes produced methane faster. Our research shows that nitrogen contained in wastewater can replace water oxidation in electrolytic biogas upgrading.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			2296-598X			WOS:000467005200002

The thin layers composed of highly dispersed and very small nanoparticles of ca. <= 2 nm were formed for IrOx films derived by Pluronic P123 and Brij 58, both of which act as a 'spacer' between the Ir-building-blocks to inhibit further agglomeration of the nanoparticles. Pluronic F127 with relatively longer hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide) blocks stabilizes Ir-complexes in the precursor solution due to stronger interaction between its longer ED-units and Ir-complexes, affording the organized mesoporous structures of ca. 8 nm pores templated by micelles formed in the IrOx film derived by Pluronic F127. The cyclic voltammetry revealed the catalytic currents for water oxidation for the SDAs-derived IrOx films were 1.3-1.8 times higher than the IrO, film without SDA. The higher water oxidation activity observed is attributed to the higher intrinsic catalytic activity of Ir-sites on very small nanoparticles in the Pluronic P123 and Brij 58-derived IrOx films, whereas it is attributed to the increased number of active Ir-sites due to the organized mesoporous structures of the Pluronic F127-derived IrOx film.

The temperatures assayed ranged from 5 to 45-degrees-C, the cells being grown at 25-degrees-C. The ZR(25), and even more so the ZR(250) cells, displayed shifts to lower temperatures of the breakpoints characterizing the changes of either oxygen evolved, or ratios of variable to constant fluorescence (F(v)/F(o)). The phenomena of chlorophyll redistribution, as a function of the temperature, were accompanied by modifications of the antenna sizes. The breakpoints in the changes of the different fluorescence parameters might correspond to critical temperatures for the lipid phase behaviour within the chloroplast membranes. As a matter of fact when compared with the control Z cells, the thy-lakoids of cells resisting to 25 and 250-mu-M had been shown (Troton et al., Phytochemistry, 25 (1986) 393-399) to contain, on a per chlorophyll basis, lower proportion of MGDG to the benefit of DGDG, and lower proportions of the sum 16:0 + 16:1-trans in phosphatidylglycerol. Such differences might be correlated to the observed chilling-resistance of the diuron-adapted cells.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0168-9452			WOS:A1990EP44700009

In this work, BiVO4 quantum dots with size of similar to 4.5 nm were synthesized through a sodium oleate modified hydrothermal process. The quantum dots show enhanced photocatalytic activity in converting CO2 to CO or CH4 compared with that in bulk. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to their evaluated conduction band when the material size reduces to nanoscale. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity can be further improved by combing with reduced graphene oxide. The reduced graphene oxide serves as a superior electron collector and transporter. Our results show a significantly improved photocatalytic activity (3.5 times) in CO2 reduction. This work would provide a feasible strategy to improve the photocatalytic activity of catalysts by using quantum structures, especially some catalysts which have a lower conduction band.									24	1	0	0	2	0	24			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000477637200002

Herein, the versatility offered by the organometallic approach for the synthesis of metal-based nanostructures allowed preparing electrodes of tailored nanocatalyst-support interactions. A set of OER working electrodes based on CoOH)(2) nanoparticles (NPs) and carbon microfibers (CFs) were prepared. The so-obtained systems differ in either the stabilizer present at the surface of the NPs (THF or 1-heptanol), the surface functionalization of the used CFs (bare CFs or oxidized-CFs) or the growth of the NPs in the presence (in situ) or the absence (ex situ) of the carbonaceous support. Correlation of a detailed structural and compositional analysis with the electroactivity of the tested nanomaterials allows extracting valuable insights about the influence of the metal-support interface on the OER performance of the studied anodes.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000550578100032

The studies of photocatalytic properties show that 1 can be used as photocatalyst to achieve efficient removal of methyl orange (MB) in the aqueous phase under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation.

There has been rapidly growing interest in a paradigm enabled by the construction of heterostructured TMCs over the past decades because it can increase the charge transport and storage capabilities of TMC-based electrodes. The introduction of defects is a critical tool that allows the manipulation of heterostructures by altering the electronic structure and stress field. In this way, the electrochemical performance of the material can be optimized. Herein, recent progress in the development of heterostructured TMCs from the perspective of defects is comprehensively discussed. It is emphasized the mechanisms by which defects influence the electrochemical performance of heterostructures and effective strategies to incorporate the 0D to 2D defects (vacancies, elemental doping, lateral hetero-interface, lattice mismatch, etc.) around the hetero-interface, which is a focus that differs from previous reviews of heterostructured TMCs. Related problems and future directions in the defect chemistry of heterostructured TMCs are also discussed. This review highlights the significance of defects for guiding the rational design of TMC electrodes for use in advanced energy storage devices.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2688-4062		WOS:000811802100001

It's therefore extremely desirable to establish a relatively unified structure-function relationship using a single performance indicator. This work luckily finds a defined/composite performance indicator (S-micro/S-BET), which can uniformly influence the capacitor performances. Such analysis is based on the characterization of the as-assembled symmetric electrochemical double-layer capacitors using a series of samples as electrodes (obtained by a dual-activator strategy with C3N3Na3S3 and KOH as dual activators and egg yolk as precursor). All the electrochemical performances (the specific capacitance, rate capability, energy storage performance, etc.) have the same tendency with S-micro/S-BET changes and the peak for all the performances can be obtained when the S-micro/S-BET value is 53.53% in this research. Herein, S-micro/S-BET is expected to be one composite performance indicator to reflect the structure-function relationship and in turn judge the whole performances of the materials through the relationship of S-micro/S-BET and a single performance, thus greatly simplifying the screening of electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.									93	4	0	0	1	0	95			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000443118300033		
J	Guelcher, SA; Solomentsev, YE; Sides, PJ; Anderson, JL								Thermocapillary phenomena and bubble coalescence during electrolytic gas evolution								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				145	6			1848	1855		10.1149/1.1838566				JUN 1998	1998	Oxygen bubbles evolved in potassium hydroxide solution during, electrolysis have been reported to be mutually attractive. A model based on thermocapillary flow and migration can explain the effect. A temperature gradient directed perpendicular to the electrode's surface into the liquid phase arises during electrolysis on a thin-layer electrode because of reaction overpotentials on the surface and ohmic losses within the electrode itself. This temperature gradient acts on a bubble at the electrode to produce a gradient of surface tension that drives flow of the adjacent liquid. Fluid next to the bubble flows away from the electrode, thus drawing liquid near the electrode laterally toward the bubble. A neighboring bubble is entrained in the thermocapillary flow and is convected toward the first bubble and vice versa. Furthermore, the presence of a bubble on a heated surface engenders a temperature gradient with a component parallel to the electrode's surface; neighboring bubbles undergo thermocapillary migration toward the bubble generating the gradient. Our theoretical model is compared with experimental data, and the agreement is good both qualitatively and quantitatively. The mutual approach of pairs of equal-size bubbles on the electrode can be modeled by considering only entrainment in each other's thermocapillary flow, because thermocapillary migration is unimportant; however, the motion of a smaller bubble toward a larger "collector" bubble can be described only when both entrainment and thermocapillary migration of the smaller bubble are included in the model.									32	0	0	0	0	0	32			0013-4651			WOS:000073705200006

Our study revealed that among the tested dyes, the raw ones (AM in ESS+OM) and those subjected to electrooxidation with the use of an iron anode and a copper cathode [AM(Fe/Cuox) in ESS+OM (OECD medium is a medium recommended by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development for Lemna sp. Growth Inhibition Test)] were the most phytotoxic for L. minor. No phytotoxicity was detected for the tested plants in solution after electrooxidation with graphite anode and cathode (AM(Cox) in ESS+OM). Quantitative identification of acid mixture removal was carried out by supplementary UPLC/MS-MS (Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography/tandem Mass Spectrometry) and UV-VIS (UltraViolet-Visible spectroscopy) instrumental analysis. The final removal after electrochemical and biological treatment of AV90 and AR357 dye components was 98 and over 99%, respectively. The results suggest that it may be a suitable replacement/addition for the generally used wastewater treatment methods.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2076-3417		WOS:000850972200001

However, the stability of the PEC water splitting devices is still a huge challenge in this field. Herein, the effect of different alkaline electrolytes on 5 nm Ni/SiOX/n-Si/Ti photoanodes by PEC, chemical, and morphologic characterizations is studied. Although the photoanode at 1 m potassium hydroxide (KOH) (pH 14) shows low onset potential, it starts to decay after approximate to 141 h PEC tests due to the formation of pinholes. However, PEC tests in the mixture electrolyte of KOH and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) (pH 12.5) or the mixture electrolyte of K-borate and Li-borate (pH 9.5) show a stability of >264 h due to the presence of lithium ions. Compared with the measurement at pH 9.5 with the Li ions electrolyte, a 5 nm Ni/SiOX/n-Si/Ti photoanode tested at pH 12.5 shows a lower onset potential of 1.254 V versus that with the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for water oxidation, indicating an overpotential of 0.024 V. The pH 12.5 solution made of KOH and LiOH can be an attractive electrolyte to enhance the activity and lifetime of silicon-based photoanodes for PEC water splitting devices.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2367-198X			WOS:000478418500001

Compared to the corresponding photochemical Fenton-like (P-FL) system and sonochemical Fenton-like system (S-FL) system, it was found that the SP-FL system could achieve synergistic degradation of antibiotic sulfamethazine (SMZ). A synergy factor of 2.2 based on pseudo-first-order degradation rate constant (k(obs)) was observed, along with great improvements in organic mineralization and waste-water detoxification. Examining the evolution of dissolved iron species and reactive oxygen species (H2O2 and center dot OH) in the three systems revealed that the SMZ degradation strongly relied on the "in-situ" photochemical generation of H2O2 and fast regeneration of dissolved Fe(II) species. Identification of the organic intermediates and released inorganic ions suggested that the cleavage of S-N bond in the SMZ molecule was dominant under center dot OH attacking. The important synergistic role of ultrasound (US) in promoting SMZ degradation was proposed. Herein US could affect the system at multi-folds: (1) accelerating the goethite-chelating dissolution by reducing mass transfer barriers, (2) enhancing the radical reactions in the bulk solution with sonochemical cavitation effect, and (3) possible direct hydrolysis of amine intermediates inside the cavitation bubbles.

Golden Leaves.								BMC plant biology				2				2	2		10.1186/1471-2229-2-2				2002 Apr 02	2002	BACKGROUND: The tropical plant Ficus microcarpa L. f. cv. Golden Leaves (GL) is a high-light sensitive tropical fig tree in which sun-leaves are yellow and shade-leaves are green. We compared the response of photosynthetic activities to strong light between GL and its wild-type (WT, Ficus microcarpa L. f.).RESULTS: Field measurements of maximum photosystem II (PSII) efficiency (Fv/Fm) of intact sun-leaves in GL showed that photo synthetic activity was severely photoinhibited during the daytime (Fv/Fm = 0.46) and subsequently recovered in the evening (Fv/Fm = 0.76). In contrast, WT did not show any substantial changes of Fv/Fm values throughout the day (between 0.82 and 0.78). Light dependency of the CO2 assimilation rate in detached shade-leaves of GL showed a response similar to that in WT, suggesting no substantial difference in photosynthetic performance between them. Several indicators of photoinhibition, including declines in PSII reaction center protein (D1) content, Fv/Fm value, and O2 evolution and CO2 assimilation rates, all indicated that GL is much more susceptible to photoinhibition than WT. Kinetics of PAM chlorophyll a fluorescence revealed that nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) capacity of GL was lower than that of WT.CONCLUSION: We conclude that the photosynthetic apparatus of GL is more highly susceptible to photoinhibition than that of WT.									11	1	0	0	10	0	12				1471-2229		MEDLINE:11926968	11926968

The composite material has good photocatalytic activity of removing As(III) in the presence of oxalate. CZS@FeOOH@CC can completely degrade 10 mg/L As(III) within 10 min under visible light irradiation. The influence factors of CZS@ FeOOH@CC composite material on catalytic oxidation of As(III) were also studied in the oxalate system. The photocatalytic oxidation efficiency of As(III) is affected by the oxalate concentration in the reaction system, and the atmosphere plays a major role in the degradation of As(III). Under visible light, oxalate first combines with Fe(III) on the surface of iron oxide to form Fe(III)-oxalate complex, and then the Fe(III)oxalate composite is activated to producemiddotC2O4-. In the presence of oxygen, Fe(II) readily reacts with O2 and oxidizes to Fe(III). The introduction of CdZnS promoted the separation of interfacial electron holes, and accelerated the REDOX cycle of Fe(II)/Fe(III). This study provides a feasible and simple method for accelerating the catalytic removal of heavy metals from wastewater by iron-based materials.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000797655000002

Ni-Co sulfide based materials (NCS) were created in the presence of Tioglycolic acid (TGA) as both sulfur source and capping agent. Altering of synthesis parameters involving metal salt type, TGA and NaOH amount help to control the sulfidebased materials features. The obtained 3D hierarchical N-GQD/NCS/CS core-double shell spheres were considered in terms of morphology, dimension and porosity. Different formed Ni-Co sulfide structures were evaluated for hydrogen storage capacity. The achieved 3D microspheres could be utilized as a favorable candidate in electrochemical hydrogen storage, incorporating the prominent electro-conductivity of N-GQDs and CSs carbonic materials and high capacity of sand-rose shaped NCS nanostructures. Carbon microspheres formed through rapid sonochemical approach and various linear amines were applied as conductive support. It was discovered that the presenting of N-GQDs prominently improves the discharge efficiency of the core-double shell spheres from 930 to 1244 mAh g-1 because of trap positions formed by both Nitrogen dopants and edge conditions which can adsorb charge transporters to rise the storage proficiency.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000743183800001

In this review, we provide an overview on recent progress in tuning the functional properties of TMO thin films via defect engineering. We begin with a brief introduction to the defect chemistry of TMOs, including types of defects and their effects on local atomic structure, electron configurations and electronic structure, etc. We then review recent research efforts in engineering defects in TMOs for novel functionalities, such as ferroelectricity, magnetism, multi-ferroelectricity and dielectricity, two-dimensional electron/hole gas, metal-insulator transitions, resistive switching, ionic conductivity, photo-electrocatalysis, etc. We also provide insights into understanding the defect-structure-property relationship from the perspective of electronic structure. Finally, challenges and perspectives on control of defects for design of novel devices are discussed.									42	0	0	0	2	0	42			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000584313600002

The as-prepared electrocatalysts were physically characterized using XRD, Raman, EDX, SEM, TEM and HRTEM analysis techniques. Very fine nanoparticles were shown in TEM image and their chemical identity was proved in XRD pattern by three crystal indices of nickel oxide species as (111), (200) and (220). The electrocatalytic activity of NiO/MC electrocatalysts was investigated for oxidizing urea molecules in 0.5 M NaOH solution. Adding variable nickel oxide loading values during the electrocatalyst preparation method appreciably affected the obtained oxidation current density. Increasing the deposited oxide weight percentage would enhance the activity of formed nanocomposite to attain its optimum performance at the electrocatalyst containing 17.5 wt% NiO. The effect of altering urea concentration and scan rate during the oxidation process on the resultant electrocatalyst activity was studied. Chronoamperograms displayed improved steady state oxidation current density values after 1800 s revealing stable nanocatalysts. This promising electrocatalytic behavior of NiO/MC elects its application as an active component for urea electro-oxidation in many potential applications including hydrogen production, fuel cells and water purification.

It is subdivided into an outer Unbanded Division and an inner Banded Division. The Banded Division contains abundant centimetre- to decimetre-thick bands dominated by fine-grained mafic minerals, with a morphology evolving from almost planar to deeply scalloped and fingered with increasing distance from the intrusion margin. The morphology of these bands is reminiscent of the reaction fronts described in sedimentary basins infiltrated by reactive fluids. We propose that the banding in the Skaergaard Marginal Border Series is produced by chemical disequilibrium resulting from the suction of primitive liquid from the main magma body into the crystal mush, driven by shrinkage of the mush during solidification. Liquid porous flow results in partial dissolution of evolved pre-existing mafic minerals in the mush. This changes the mush liquid composition to one capable of crystallizing mafic rocks with a very minor plagioclase component. Abrupt solidification of this liquid, resulting in the formation of the colloform bands, is explained by supersaturation of some mafic mineral components (e.g. olivine, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides) in the infiltrating melt. We suggest that the morphological evolution of the colloform bands is a consequence of increasing crystal mush thickness with progressive differentiation.									20	0	0	0	1	1	20			0022-3530	1460-2415		WOS:000318572300007

Photoassembly of the manganese cluster in mutants perturbed in the high affinity Mn-binding site of the H2O-oxidation complex of photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				46	47			13648	13657		10.1021/bi700761v				NOV 27 2007	2007	The light-driven, oxidative assembly of Mn2+ ions into the H2O-oxidation complex (WOC) of the photosystern II (PSII) reaction center is termed photoactivation and culminates in the formation of the oxygen-evolving (Mn-4-Ca) center of the WOC. Initial binding and photooxidation of Mn2+ to the apoprotein is critically dependent upon aspartate 170 of the D1 protein (D1-D170) of the high affinity Mn Site [Nixon and Diner (1992) Biochemistry 31, 942-948]. Three O-2-evolving mutant strains of Synechocystis, D1-D170E, D1-D170H, and D1-D170V, were studied in terms of the kinetics of photoactivation under both continuous and flashing light. Photoactivation using single turnover flashes revealed D1-D170H and D1-D170V, but not D1-D170E, were prone to form substantial amounts (similar to 40-50%) of inactive centers ascribed to photoligation of aberrant nonfunctional Mn based upon the reversibility of the inactivation and similarity to previous in vitro results [Chen, C., Kazimir, J., and Cheniae, G. M. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 13511-13526]. On the other hand, D1-D170E lowers the quantum efficiency of photoactivation compared to the wild-type by the largest amount (80% decrease) versus D1-D170H and D1-D170V, which do,not produce measurable decreases in quantum efficiency. The low quantum efficiency of photoactivation in D1-D170E is due to the destabilization of photoactivation intermediates. Numerical analysis indicates that the PSII centers in D1-D170E are heterogeneous with respect to photoactivation kinetics and that the majority of centers are characterized by intermediates that decay similar to 10-fold more rapidly than the wild-type control. Additionally, the kinetics of O-2 release during the S-3-S-0 transition was markedly retarded in D1-D170E, in contrast to D1-D170H and D1-D170V, which did not exhibit a discernible slow-down compared to the wild-type.									16	0	1	0	13	0	17			0006-2960			WOS:000251150000018	17975894

Based on the ore-forming geological characteristics, this paper focus on the sulfur, carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of the ores and surrounding rocks, and discuss the sources and evolution processes of the ore-forming materials. The Cu-Fe deposit occurs in the contact zone between the early Yanshanian Yueshan diorite and Triassic marble, with clear horizontal zonings in the skarns and ore bodies. The garnet skarn and thick massive magnetite ore body commonly occur within the external contact zone, which have clear boundaries with the surrounding rocks; whereas the diopside skarns with disseminated copper sulfide commonly occur within the internal contact zone and show gradual and transitional relations with the diorite. The delta~(34)S values of the ores range from -6.5 to 10.6, and show a V-shaped trend from the diorite to the outer marble. This compositional variation indicates that most of the sulfur may come from magma, with involvement of some pre-Triassic clastic strata sulfur and Triassic marine sulfates in the later stage. The delta~(13)C values of the gangue minerals range from -5.5 to 2.0, which decrease from the external contact zone to internal contact zone, indicating that the carbons of the ore-forming fluids may be mainly derived from magma, with some Triassic carbonate stratigraphic carbon involved. The marbles nearby the orebody show delta~(18)O values lower than those of the Triassic strata, indicating that they have been remolded by the low delta~(18)O magmatic hydrothermal fluids. The magnetite have some magma filling geological features and extremely low delta~(18)O value, may be the result from the filling of the high temperature iron-rich fluids along the contact zone and fault. This study shows that the ore-magma filling type and hydrothermal-metasomatic type ore bodies coexist in the Anqing Fe-Cu deposit. The immiscibility between iron oxide and silicate melt occurred in magma chamber, which resulted in the formation of iron-rich fluid. The fluid migrated upward and eventually precipitated in a favorable tectonic area or contact zone, and the magnetite ore bodies were formed in the outer contact zone. By the later fluid mixing, filling metasomasis, and water-rock reaction between the differentiated hydrothermal solutions and diorite, the copper ore bodies and the copper-bearing altered diorite were formed in the internal contact zone.			安庆铁铜矿床是安徽沿江地区具代表性的大型铁铜矿床之一,其形成机制一直存在较大争议。本文在分析成矿地质特征的基础上,研究了矿石和围岩的硫、碳、氧同位素组成特征,探讨了该矿床的成矿物质来源与成矿过程。研究结果表明,矿床具有显著的水平分带特征。矿石硫化物delta~(34)S值范围为-6.5~10.6,变化大,闪长岩浆为成矿提供了大部分硫,前三叠纪碎屑地层和三叠纪围岩提供了部分硫;从闪长岩体到围岩, delta~(34)S值呈V字型变化,是不同来源硫混合的结果。碳酸盐矿物delta~(13)C范围为-5.5~2.0,从外带到内带呈下降趋势,表明碳主要源自岩浆热液,混入了部分地层碳。近矿围岩中delta~(13)C和delta~(18)O值相对地层偏低,是流体改造作用的结果。外接触带致密块状磁铁矿体具有最低的delta~(18)O值和部分贯入成因地质特征,可能为高温流体沿接触带和断层贯入充填的产物。综合研究认为,该矿床可能存在流体贯入充填与热液交代两种成矿形式。高温富铁流体贯入接触带形成了外带块状磁铁矿体,其分异热液与闪长岩体的交代作用、地层流体混入等综合作用形成了矽卡岩型铜矿体和含铜蚀变闪长岩,二者在空间上的叠加构成了矽卡岩型铁铜矿床,不同成矿方式的叠加导致了矿床分带及元素迁移特征有别于典型矽卡岩矿床。						1	2	0	0	0	0	3			1001-1552			CSCD:6318402

Observed by scanning electron microscopy, the fabricated samples were structured with aligned columns whose diameter and height was 8 mu m and 12 mu m, respectively, and the minimum interval of neighboring columns was 2 mu m. The results of electrochemistry measurement showed that the columnar BDD array electrode possessed high oxygen evolution potential and low background current. Besides that, comparing with flat BDD electrode, the columnar BDD array electrode showed higher electrochemical activity (due to its inner active surface being up to 4.25 cm(2)), lower impedance of electric double layer, and especially enhanced electrical response signal (2.12 mu A/mu M, 4 times of flat BDD in glucose detection as a sample).

In the present study, muscle structure was found to be related to haemoglobin phenotype in a coastal population of Atlantic cod from the Saltenfjord region of Northern Norway. The maximum number of fast muscle fibres ( FNmax) was reached at approximately 39 cm fork length and was 15% greater in the HbI-(1/1) than in the HbI-(2/2) phenotypes whereas the average fibre diameter for fish of the same fork length was significantly lower. Theoretically, the higher oxygen affinity of the HbI-(2/2) phenotype in the cold water of northern latitudes could have resulted in a relaxation of diffusional constraints at the level of individual muscle fibres, permitting the observed increase in fibre diameter. The results support the optimal fibre number hypothesis which envisages a trade-off between diffusional constraints and the energy cost of maintaining ionic homeostasis with fewer larger diameter muscle fibres in the HbI-(2/2) phenotype contributing to a lower routine metabolic rate.									20	0	0	0	19	0	20			1744-9561	1744-957X		WOS:000242686500030	17148296

In this work, potassium iodate (KIO3), an edible salt additive, was used as a critical waste-free modifier in the thermal polymerization of g-C3N4, leading to a fast and coordinated co-modification of g-C3N4 photocatalysts. The final g-CN-KIO3 photocatalyst demonstrated a superior and balanced optical absorption ability and semiconductor band structure. In visible-light-driven photocatalytic model tests, g-CN-KIO3 showed a 3.25 times higher Cr(vi) photoreduction rate and five orders of magnitude lower residual bacteria in a photocatalytic sterilization within 120 min compared with raw g-C3N4. The photocatalytic performance of g-CN-KIO3 also outperformed all of the controls without maximized K-I-O co-modification (CN-K, CN-I, CN-O, and CN-KI). Photocurrent and electrochemical impedance experiments suggest that the co-modified photocatalysts have a faster charge separation ability, which is attributed to the multiple K-I-O co-modifications inducing an optimized surface electronic structure and slower carrier recombination. This work provides a new way to simplify and coordinate complex multi-factor regulation of materials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2052-1553			WOS:000747891500001

The large-scale deployment of electrolyzers for energy storage is hampered by catalyst efficiencies as well as high capital costs. Herein we report a rapid prototyping methodology to accelerate the development of complex flow plate architectures as a means of lowering electrolyzer capital costs. This process involves the electroplating of nickel onto 3D-printed plastic flow cells, which enable the rapid production of experimental flow plates with different flow channel geometries. The test cells containing these metal-coated plastic components matched the performance of conventional metal electrodes. The ability to electroplate 3D-printed parts offers the opportunity to rapidly prototype flow-field geometries to more rapidly evaluate fluid and gas flow through the electrolyzer.									38	0	0	0	3	0	38			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000387862100009

XRD results along with Rietveld refinement reveal that the co-deposited phases on the DSA exhibit a tetragonal crystal structure (P4/mmm) for RuO2 and monoclinic structure (P2/m) for ZrO2. Degradation tests conducted in solutions containing 0.64 mM IC and 0.05 M NaCl using a filter-press reactor (FM01-LC) show that the degradation rate is faster and more efficient at 200 Am-2 with a flow rate of 5 L min(-1), although the energy consumption is moderately higher. Under this condition, the pollutant is efficiently removed, and converted to aliphatic acid compounds of low molecular weight, as indicated by 90 % Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), 22 % Total Organic Carbon (TOC) elimination, along with an Average Oxidation State (AOS) value equal to 3.0. The energy consumptions revealed that it is feasible to carry out the IC degradation under reasonable operating costs. Topological and Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analyses are computed using density functional theory (DFT), and combined with experimental results to propose a reaction pathway for IC abatement.

Co-Pi catalyst films exhibit EPR signals corresponding to populations of both Co(II) and Co(IV). As the deposition voltage is increased into the region where water oxidation prevails, the population of Co(IV) rises and the population of Co(II) decreases. The changes in the redox speciation of the film can also be induced, in part, by prolonged water oxidation catalysis in the absence of additional catalyst deposition. These results provide spectroscopic evidence for the formation of Co(IV) species during water oxidation catalysis at neutral pH.									422	13	0	0	57	0	425			0002-7863			WOS:000277999700008	20433197

ACS Materials Au				2	4			505	515		10.1021/acsmaterialsau.2c00025				2022-Jul-13	2022	The ongoing transition to renewable energy sources and the implementation of artificial photosynthetic setups call for an efficient and stable water oxidation catalyst (WOC). Here, we heterogenize a molecular all-inorganic [CoIIICoII(H2O)W11O39]7- ({CoIIICoIIW11}) Keggin-type polyoxometalate (POM) onto a model TiO2 surface, employing a 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) linker to form a novel heterogeneous photosystem for light-driven water oxidation. The {CoIIICoIIW11}-APTES-TiO2 hybrid is characterized using a set of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques to reveal the POM integrity and dispersion to elucidate the POM/APTES and APTES/TiO2 binding modes as well as to visualize the attachment of individual clusters. We conduct photocatalytic studies under heterogeneous and homogeneous conditions and show that {CoIIICoIIW11}-APTES-TiO2 performs as an active light-driven WOC, wherein {CoIIICoIIW11} acts as a stable co-catalyst for water oxidation. In contrast to the homogeneous WOC performance of this POM, the heterogenized photosystem yields a constant WOC rate for at least 10 h without any apparent deactivation, demonstrating that TiO2 not only stabilizes the POM but also acts as a photosensitizer. Complementary studies using photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy elucidate the charge transfer mechanism and enhanced WOC activity. The {CoIIICoIIW11}-APTES-TiO2 photocatalyst serves as a prime example of a hybrid homogeneous-heterogeneous photosystem that combines the advantages of solid-state absorbers and well-defined molecular co-catalysts, which will be of interest to both scientific communities and applications in photoelectrocatalysis and CO2 reduction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2694-2461		MEDLINE:35856075	35856075

The efforts made on these configurations in terms of design principle, advanced characterization, performances and theoretical studies, are critically reviewed. A clear roadmap with the correlations between the single-TM-site-based structures (coordination and geometric structure, TM species, support), and the catalytic performances in water oxidation is provided. The insights bridging SMMCs with SACs are also given.

A new transparent mesoporous IrOx film consisting of small interconnected nanoparticles has been developed by simple drop-casting of a homogeneous solution containing a very low concentration of a hydroxyiridate complex and a polymer surfactant Pluronic F127 followed by annealing. The intrinsic activity of catalytic Ir-sites in the mesoporous IrOx-F127 film was higher than that of the IrOx-untemplate film at the same annealing temperature as indicated by cyclic voltammetry. Electrochemical impedance measurements suggested faster electron transport through interconnected nanoparticles of the mesoporous network in the former film compared with the discrete nanoparticulate structure in the latter. The high intrinsic activity of Ir-sites and efficient electron transport in the novel mesoporous structure contributed to the high electrocatalytic performance observed for the IrOx-F127 film annealed at 400 degrees C. The catalytic current of the IrOx-F127 film for water oxidation with respect to the iridium amount (I-cat/Gamma(cov)) was 5.3 and 4.3 times higher than those of the transparent and efficient electrocatalyst films of the hitherto-reported 2D-hexagonal mesoporous IrOx (ChemSusChem, 2015, 8, 795-799) and nanoparticle IrOx(OH)(y) (ACS Catal., 2016, 6, 3946-3954), respectively.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000498612600024

In this work, the effect of lower layer (a perovskite type dielectric BaTiO3) on PbO2 electrodeposition and its electrochemical performance evaluation was enrooted. BaTiO3 was deposited on pretreated Ti in highly basic 4 M KOH medium resulted in needle shaped BaTiO3 crystals of length 4.79 mu m and width 0.43 mu m Co-deposition with nano-PbO2 (BaTiO3-NPb) and Pb(NO3)(2) (BaTiO3-Pb) produced a flower- and fur tree-like structures, respectively. Further, the upper layer of PbO2 deposited in acid medium on BaTiO3-NPb and BaTiO3-Pb completely changed the shape to cauliflower-like shapes and cauliflower-like shapes with rock-like shapes, respectively. XRD result demonstrated the BaTiO3 structure orientation was influenced to achieve mostly beta-PbO2 orientation. Electrochemical impedance and cyclic voltammetry analyses of BaTiO3NPb/PbO2 and BaTiO3-Pb/PbO2 electrodes demonstrated smooth and porous morphological surfaces, respectively. When BaTiO3-NPb/PbO2 electrode was applied as an anode for the direct oxidation of phenol, it was found a considerable impact on its catalytic activity. An accelerated stability test result demonstrated BaTiO3-NPb/PbO2 is stable for more than 3000 h in H2SO4 medium.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1452-3981			WOS:000412639500028

However, along with the improvement in the electrochemical properties in Ni-based cathode materials, the thermal stability has been a great concern, and thus violent reaction of the cathode with the electrolyte needs to be avoided. Here, we report a heterostructured Li[Ni0.54Co0.12Mn0.34]O-2 cathode material which possesses both high energy and safety. The core of the particle is Li[Ni0.54Co0.12Mn0.34]O-2 with a layered phase (R3-m) and the shell, with a thickness of < 0.5 mu m, is a highly stable Li1+x[CoNixMn2-x](2)O-4 spinel phase (Fd-3m). The material demonstrates reversible capacity of 200 mAhg-1 and retains 95% capacity retention under the most severe test condition of 60 degrees C. In addition, the amount of oxygen evolution from the lattice in the cathode with two heterostructures is reduced by 70%, compared to the reference sample. All these results suggest that the bulk Li[Ni0.54Co0.12Mn0.34]O-2 consisting of two heterostructures satisfy the requirements for hybrid electric vehicles, power tools, and mobile electronics.									168	5	0	0	5	0	174			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000295140100017

Many of the post-Variscan fluorite-barite-quartz veins are considered to have precipitated through mixing of a deep saline brine with meteoric, low salinity waters. This hypothesis was tested using carbon, sulfur, and oxygen isotope data of sulfides, sulfates and calcite, coupled with fluid inclusion studies. Primary hydrothermal calcites from the deposits show a positive correlation of their delta C-13 (V-PDB) and delta O-18 (V-SMOW) values, which range from -12 to -3 parts per thousand and from 12 to 18.5 parts per thousand, respectively. Carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of paragenetically young, remobilized calcite types are shifted towards higher values and range from -12 to -1%, and from 20 to 25%., respectively. We developed an improved calculation procedure for modeling the covariation of carbon and oxygen isotopes in calcite resulting from mixing of two fluids with different isotopic compositions and total carbon concentrations. In our model, the carbon speciation in the two model fluid end-members and the fluid mixtures are calculated using a speciation and reaction path code. The carbon and oxygen isotope covariation of primary Schwarzwald calcites can effectively be modeled by a mixing trend of a deep saline brine and a meteoric, low salinity water. Sulfur isotope data of barites from 44 hydrothermal fluorite-barite-quartz veins vary from 9 to 18%. (CDT), sulfide ore minerals show delta S-34 values between -14.4 and 2.9 parts per thousand. Calculated sulfide-sulfate equilibrium temperatures are in the range between 300 and 350 degrees C. These temperatures differ significantly from the formation temperatures of 150 to 200 degrees C of most of the deposits as estimated from fluid inclusions, and are interpreted as preserved paleotemperatures of the deep aquifer. This assumption has been carefully checked against possible contamination of an equilibrated sulfide-sulfate system from the deep aquifer with sulfate from surface-derived sources, considering also the kinetics of the sulfide-sulfate isotope exchange. A combination of the S isotopic results with microthermometric fluid inclusion data and constraints on the temperature of the meteoric water was used to calculate mixing ratios of the two fluid end-members. The results indicate that mass fractions of the deep saline brine in the mixed fluid were between 0.5 and 0.75. Considering all geologic, geochemical and isotopic information, we propose that the majority of the post-Variscan hydrothermal veins in the Schwarzwald area were precipitated by district-scale mixing of a homogeneous deep saline brine with meteoric waters.

During heat treatment companied by the transformation of NTA to TiO2, a kind of single-electron-trapped oxygen vacancy (V-O(center dot)) could be formed contributing to the visible light absorption of catalysts. The morphology, phase and chemical structure, optical and electronic properties, and so on of the produced catalysts with various HPW loadings are characterized. The size range of synthesized photocatalyst nanoparticles are about 10 similar to 50 nm. Taking aqueous rhodamine B (RhB) dye as model pollutant, we carried out photocatalytic activity test of the achieved catalysts, revealing that the hybrid photocatalysts display significantly enhanced visible light-driven (lambda >= 420 nm) photocatalytic activity for degradation of RhB. Among various catalysts, HPWN0.1-120 composite with nominal loading of 0.1 g HPW and heat treatment temperature of 120 degrees C possesses the highest photocatalytic performance in visible light, which is closely related to the co-effect of phase heterojunction of rutile/anatase, surface heterojunction of anatase/HPW, and oxygen vacancy (V-O(center dot)). The two types of heterojunction promote greatly the separation efficiency of photoelectrons and photoholes and oxygen vacancy lures response of catalysts to visible light.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000434710600001

In this study, the geochemistry of Mo and W in a sediment-porewater system was investigated using a core sample collected from sediment containing hydrothermal minerals (Izena Hole, Okinawa, Japan). The Mo contents in the sediment and the porewater were quantified to calculate the partition coefficient K-d (concentration ratio of the solid phase to the aqueous phase) for Mo. However, the W concentration in the porewater was exceedingly low to be detected. Thus, we also conducted laboratory experiments simulating the sediment-porewater system to clarify the partitioning behaviors of Mo and W under redox conditions. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra were obtained to determine the chemical species of Mo and W in sediment at different depths to understand the chemical processes of Mo and W. In particular, high-sensitivity XANES spectroscopy using wavelength-dispersive fluorescence mode was applied to W L-3 edge XANES spectra to reduce the interference signals from coexistent elements (Zn and Ni). This step thereby facilitating the identification of oxygen- and sulfur-coordinated species for W in the sediments.The collected core sample covered a broad range of redox conditions under various hydrogen sulfide (H2S) concentrations depending on the depth. The presence of iron oxides in the upper layer suggested an oxic condition above within 4 cm depth below the seafloor (cmbsf). Iron and Zn sulfide minerals were found in deeper layers (16-24 cmbsf) and indicated the reductive conditions formed in such layer. Hydrogen sulfide was also observed in the porewater of the deeper layer. Analyses for Mo in the natural sediments, as well as XANES analyses, revealed that the K-d was higher in the deeper layer, with high pyrite and H2S contents, than in the upper layer. These results implied that Mo was removed from the porewater under reductive and/or sulfidic conditions. The chemical species of Mo was also an oxygen-coordinated species in the upper layer (0-8 cmbsf). Meanwhile, the detection of sulfide in the deeper layer suggests that Mo sulfidation is an important reaction in Mo enrichment in sediments.On the other hand, at all the depths, W formed oxygen-coordinated species in the sediment. The subtle change of K-d for W with depth suggested that H2S did not affect the W adsorption in our samples. Hence, the Mo/W ratio in the sediments increased with the development of reducing conditions and vice versa in the coexistent porewater. Speciation analysis revealed that the high stability of oxygen-coordinated species of W was responsible for the variations of the Mo/W ratio under various redox conditions.									9	1	0	0	2	0	9			0009-2541	1872-6836		WOS:000413540400003		
J	CLAUSMEYER, S; KLOSGEN, RB; HERRMANN, RG								PROTEIN IMPORT INTO CHLOROPLASTS - THE HYDROPHILIC LUMENAL PROTEINS EXHIBIT UNEXPECTED IMPORT AND SORTING SPECIFICITIES IN SPITE OF STRUCTURALLY CONSERVED TRANSIT PEPTIDES								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				268	19			13869	13876						JUL 5 1993	1993	Plastocyanin and the 16-, 23-, and 33-kDa polypeptides of the oxygen-evolving complex associated with photosystem II are hydrophilic, nuclear encoded components of the photosynthetic machinery that are all located in the lumen of thylakoid membranes. All four proteins are therefore imported into chloroplasts and, in addition, translocated across the thylakoid membrane. They share functionally equivalent, bipartite transit peptides, which are removed in two steps during or after import into the organelle and translocation across the thylakoid membrane, respectively. The transit peptides lack any homology at the sequence level but possess remarkably similar predicted secondary structures. We have studied the targeting potential of the authentic precursor molecules and all possible chimeric combinations generated by a specific, commonly applicable cassette system, which facilitates codon-correct reciprocal exchanges of transit peptides and mature parts. An unexpected specificity of import and sorting processes was found. All constructs can be imported into the organelle, though with greatly differing efficiency. On the other hand, the lumen-targeting parts are essential but not in all cases sufficient for correct intraorganellar routing. This implies that translocation across the thylakoid membrane appears not to depend merely on simple interactions of charged or hydrophobic regions between protein and membrane but requires an additional quality of information that includes the functional co-evolution of a transit peptide with its mature protein. Signaling and sorting appear to be essential at almost every step of the entire process for proper traffic regulation since distinct steps can be impaired (rate-limiting or arrested) in the individual combinations: the transfer across the envelope membranes (e.g. 16/PC) and the interaction with (e.g. 16/33) or the translocation across the thylakoid membrane (e.g. 33/23).									75	2	0	0	62	0	76			0021-9258			WOS:A1993LJ82500018	8314754

However, severe surface recombination and slow water oxidation kinetics hinder the realization of its highly theoretical PEC performance. Single-atom catalyst-like metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derived metal oxides have been broadly investigated to enhance the kinetics of BiVO4 photoanodes. According to the principle of catalysis, only coordinatively unsaturated atoms can participate in the catalytic reaction. Herein, a defective cobalt-based MOF (d-CoMOF) with missing linker defects is modified onto the surface of N-doped BiVO4 (N:BVO) photoanodes. The photocurrent density of d-CoMOF/N:BVO is 3.59 times higher than that of pristine BVO (0.56 mA/cm2) at 1.23 VRHE. The onset potential of d-CoMOF/ N:BVO shows a cathodic shift of 300 mV relative to BVO. The roles of the d-CoMOF overlayer and N doping are experimentally revealed. The d-CoMOF modification and N doping could increase the electron density, passivate the surface states, and promote the catalysis kinetics of BVO. Thus, the kinetic parameters, such as the charge separation/injection efficiency, onset potential, and photocurrent density, are significantly enhanced. This work provides a way to use MOFs for PEC water splitting by the introduction of defects.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000734172600007

J	Cachet, H; Zenia, F; Froment, M								Corrosion-induced activation of SnO2 films promoted by the electrochemical oxidation of chloride ions								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				146	3			977	983		10.1149/1.1391708				MAR 1999	1999	At potentials more positive than the flatband potential, tin dioxide electrodes are normally passivated with respect to charge transfer because of an electron-depleted surface. Nevertheless, such a passivated state can be lost by the occurrence of a corrosion process. In the potential region 0.9-1.3 V/saturated calomel electrode close to the thermodynamic potential for chloride oxidation, sprayed SnO2 thin film electrodes present a loss of mass, determined in situ by quartz crystal microbalance experiments. This phenomenon is characterized by a peak-shaped corrosion rate curve, the amplitude of which depends on the pH, the chloride concentration, the presence of metallic traces, and the type of the dopant. From data obtained at pH 8, and in natural seawater, it is apparent that the corrosion rate is (i) amplified by the presence of metallic traces, and (ii) strongly dependent on the Cl- content, becoming almost negligible for [Cl-] > 0.3 M. These results are tentatively explained by considering the electrochemical production of OH. and Cl-. radicals, able to break Sn-O surface bonds by electron capture (chemical steps), in competition with chlorine and oxygen evolution. The corrosion process is also responsible for a positive shift of bandedges due to charged corrosion intermediates, allowing the SnO2 electrode to become active with respect to anodic charge transfer reactions.

In this work, a Z-scheme Cu3V2O7(OH)(2).2H(2)O/Cu/Cu2O (denoted as CVO/Cu/Cu2O) heterojunction was successfully fabricated for the first time and used as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. It was demonstrated that successively loading metallic Cu and Cu2O nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of CVO could significantly improve the photocatalytic performance of CVO, and the highest CO evolution rate of 6.97 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1) was obtained over the optimized CVO/Cu/Cu2O, which was 25.6 and 2.3 times higher than those of CVO and CVO/Cu2O, respectively. Moreover, CVO/Cu/Cu2O maintained a high stability even after five cycle reactions as compared to the binary CVO/Cu2O. The improved photocatalytic performance of CVO/Cu/Cu2O was mainly attributed to the enhanced visible-light absorption capability and the efficient Z-Scheme heterojunctions, which would boost the generation, migration, and separation of photogenerated charge carriers. This work may provide a strategy to design and fabricate copper vanadate-based Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts with high efficiency for CO2 reduction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000848391800001

The primary (Mg,Fe)CO3 solids undergo a dissolution-recrystallization process driven by two forces: the preferential partition of Fe2+ toward the (Mg,Fe)CO3 solid solution and the oxidation of aqueous Fe2+ species to form Fe(III)-bearing solids. Under limited oxygen supply, the oxidation of Fe2+ is a slow process, particularly in the presence of chlorine and inorganic carbon. In absence of oxidation, the initial solid solution should become increasingly Fe-rich as the supersaturation decreases and the system approaches equilibrium. Here, the secondary (Mg,Fe)CO3 solids become the wrong way round, Mg-rich. The gradual oxidation of the aqueous Fe2+ species eventually leads to precipitation of magnetite, which is also metastable because the aqueous solution is maximally supersaturated with respect to hematite. In most computer implementations, the aqueous activities of Fe2+ and Fe3+ are adjusted to redox equilibrium, and the supersaturation with respect to Fe-bearing solids is determined from these activities. Unfortunately, this approach does not provide supersaturation values in real time. Reactions between aqueous species are actually not instantaneous and can be slower than the dissolution/precipitation of related solids. Considering this fact is essential in modeling the artificial carbonation of ferromagnesian minerals for CO2 sequestration purposes.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000407089600017

The anodic oxidation of ethylene glycol on Rh/TiO2 leads to glycolaldehyde, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde as primary products. Glycolaldehyde is further converted via oxidative C-C-cleavage to formaldehyde and formic acid. Formaldehyde is oxidized to formic acid forming CO2 and H-2. Acetaldehyde is oxidized to acetic acid, which decarboxylates to CO2 and CH4. Two catalytically active sites are proposed. On terminal Ti-IV-OH groups, oxygenates are oxidized via direct hole transfer to alkoxy-radicals prior to beta-C-C-bond cleavage. Bridged [Ti center dot center dot O-center dot center dot center dot Ti](+) sites, in contrast, cleave a C-H bond, forming carbon centered radicals, which are further oxidized by transferring an electron to the conduction band of the semiconductor. On Rh/GaN:ZnO, glycolaldehyde is the main product, forming higher oxidized C2-oxygenates in turn by reaction with free oxygen radicals formed as product of OH- photocatalytic oxidation. The overall rates of photoreforming and, hence, H-2 evolution, depend mainly on the surface concentration of the compounds which are oxidized, while the nature of the oxygenate is of less importance.

In this contribution we report a detailed study on surface and structure modification of the recently developed ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) via a liquid-phase chemical oxidation approach. The structure and surface evolution of OMCs like CMK-5 and CMK-3 have been investigated using nitric acid with varying concentrations, at different oxidation temperatures and for different oxidation periods. The physical parameters as well as the chemical nature of the modifications were investigated with low-temperature nitrogen adsorption, FTIR, TG-MS, TEM, XPS and XRD analysis. After oxidation, the surface of OMCs has a high-concentration of oxygen-containing groups. The presence of carboxylic functional groups on the carbon surface was confirmed by FTIR and XPS analyses. As compared to CMK-5, CMK-3 carbon is structurally more stable during the oxidation treatment. In addition, controlled surface functionalization and pore size manipulation can also be achieved by an esterification reaction between the surface carboxyl groups and 1-butanol. The pore size of the modified carbons was decreased by about similar to 1-1.2 nm. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									186	11	2	0	18	1	193			1387-1811	1873-3093		WOS:000252529400030

Groundwater infiltrates through the soil and limestone then flows along the top of the aquitard and into a freshwater lens before discharging along the coast. Discrete recharge takes place through sinkholes, drainage wells and dry valley beds. Soils influence recharge because of varying infiltration rates. Soils occurring at higher elevations are generally more permeable than those at lower elevations. Consequently, there is greater potential for diffuse recharge through soils at higher elevations on the island. Recharge was quantified by comparison of groundwater and rainwater Cl concentrations and oxygen isotopic compositions. The results indicate that recharge (1) is due to rapid infiltration, (2) occurs only during the wettest months of the year, and (3) represents 15-30% of annual rainfall.Major and trace element and isotopic variations in Barbados groundwaters are used to constrain the relative influences of (1) mineral-solution reactions with aquifer and aquitard rock, (2) ion exchange in soils, (3) seawater mixing, (4) anthropogenic inputs, and (5) variations in recharge. Major element compositions of groundwater reflect the effects of limestone dissolution and fresh groundwater-seawater mixing in coastal areas, whereas elevated nitrate concentrations indicate a widespread anthropogenic impact. Groundwater Sr isotopic variations are used to trace soil and rock sources of dissolved constituents. Aquitard influences appear to be associated with low hydraulic gradients.					3rd International Symposium on Tropical Hydrology / 5th Caribbean Islands Water Resources Congress3rd International Symposium on Tropical Hydrology / 5th Caribbean Islands Water Resources Congress	JUL 12-16, 1998JUL 12-16, 1998	Amer Water Resources Assoc; Water Resource Res Inst; U.S. Geolog Survey, water Res Div; Water Resources Res CtrAmer Water Resources Assoc; Water Resource Res Inst; U.S. Geolog Survey, water Res Div; Water Resources Res Ctr	SAN JUAN, PRSAN JUAN, PR	3	0	0	0	0	0	3					1-882132-43-2	WOS:000079025600002

In these compounds, a photosensitizer, ruthenium(II) tris(bipyridyl) complex (to mimic the function of P-680 in PSII), was covalently linked to a manganese(II) ion through different bridging ligands. The structures of the compounds were characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance measurements and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The interaction between the ruthenium and manganese moieties within the complex was probed by steady-state and time-resolved emission measurements. When the binuclear complexes are exposed to flash photolysis in the presence of an electron acceptor such as methylviologen (MV2+), it could be shown that after the initial electron transfer from the excited state of Ru(II) in compound 7, forming Ru(III) and MV+., an intramolecular electron transfer from coordinated Mn(II) to the photogenerated Ru(III) occurred with a first-order rate constant of 1.8 x 10(5) s(-1), regenerating Ru(II). This is believed to be the first supramolecular system where a manganese complex has been used as an electron donor to a photo-oxidized photosensitizer, Possible extensions to develop the manganese donor, and thus to approach the function of reaction center in PSII, are indicated.									110	3	0	0	13	0	114			0002-7863			WOS:A1997XN52500007

The use of fuel performance codes by the industry to predict operational behavior is widespread. A primary source of uncertainty in these codes is thermal conductivity, and optimized fuel utilization may be possible if existing empirical models are replaced with models that incorporate explicit thermal-conductivity-degradation mechanisms during fuel burn up. This approach is able to represent the degradation of thermal conductivity due to each individual defect type, rather than the overall burn-up measure typically used, which is not an accurate representation of the chemical or microstructure state of the fuel that actually governs thermal conductivity and other properties. To generate a mechanistic thermal conductivity model, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of UO2 thermal conductivity including representative uranium and oxygen defects and fission products are carried out. These calculations employ a standard Buckingham-type interatomic potential and a potential that combines the many-body embedded-atom-method potential with Morse-Buckingham pair potentials. Potential parameters for UO2+x and ZrO2 are developed for the latter potential. Physical insights from the resonant phonon-spin-scattering mechanism due to spins on the magnetic uranium ions are introduced into the treatment of the MD results, with the corresponding relaxation time derived from existing experimental data. High defect scattering is predicted for Xe atoms compared to that of La and Zr ions. Uranium defects reduce the thermal conductivity more than oxygen defects. For each defect and fission product, scattering parameters are derived for application in both a Callaway model and the corresponding high-temperature model typically used in fuel-performance codes. The model is validated by comparison to low-temperature experimental measurements on single-crystal hyperstoichiometric UO2+x samples and high-temperature literature data. Ultimately, this work will enable more accurate fuel-performance simulations and will extend to new fuel types and operating conditions, all of which improve the fuel economics of nuclear energy and maintain high fuel reliability and safety.									38	1	0	0	1	0	38			2331-7019			WOS:000390233800002

The oxygen isotope composition of quartz from early quartz - carbonate auriferous veins ranges from 9.4 parts per thousand to 14.4 parts per thousand whereas later quartz-tourmaline-carbonate veins have delta(18)O(quartz) values ranging from 9.2 parts per thousand to 13.8 parts per thousand. Quartz-carbonate veins have carbonate (delta(18)O: 6.9 - 12.5 parts per thousand; delta(13)C: - 6.2 - -1.9 parts per thousand) and pyrite (delta(34)S: 1.2 and 1.9 parts per thousand) isotope compositions comparable to those of quartz-tourmaline-carbonate veins (delta(18)O: 7.9 - 11.7 parts per thousand; delta(13)C: - 8.0 - - 2.4 parts per thousand; delta(34)S: 0.6 - 6.0 parts per thousand). delta(18)O(quartz) values in quartz-tourmaline-carbonate veins have a variance comparable to analytical uncertainty at the scale of one locality, irrespective of the type of structure, the texture of the quartz or its position along strike, across strike or down-dip a vein. In contrast, the oxygen isotope composition of quartz in quartz-tourmaline-carbonate veins displays a regional distribution with higher delta(18)O values in the south-central part of the vein field near the Cadillac Tectonic Zone, and which delta(18)O values decrease regularly towards the north. Another zone of high delta(18)O values in the northeast corner of the region and along the trace of the Senneville Fault is separated by a valley of lower delta(18)O values from the higher values near the Cadillac Tectonic Zone. Oxygen isotope isopleths cut across lithological contacts and tectonic structures. This regional pattern in quartz-tourmaline-carbonate veins is interpreted to be a product of reaction with country rocks and mixing between (1) a deep-seated hydrothermal fluid of metamorphic origin with minimum delta(18)O = 8.5 parts per thousand, delta(13)C = 0.6 parts per thousand and delta(34)S = - 0.4 parts per thousand, and ( 2) a supracrustal fluid, most likely Archean seawater with a long history of water-rock exchange and with maximum delta(18)O = 3.9 parts per thousand, delta(13) C = - 5.6 parts per thousand and delta(34)S = 5.0 parts per thousand.									60	7	0	0	0	0	65			0026-4598			WOS:000230353900005

So far, the H-2 generation by water electrolysis research field did not manage to break the efficiency barrier in order to consider H-2 production as a technology that sustains financially its self-development. However, given the complexity of this technology and the overall environmental impacts, an up-to-date research and development status review is critical.

We report here, the preparation of alpha-Fe2O3/Fe3O4 composite films via a single-step chemical vapor deposition of [Fe((OBu)-Bu-t)(3)](2) and their use as efficient photoanode materials in PEC setups. Film thickness and phase segregation was controlled by varying the deposition time and corroborated through cross-section Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The highest water oxidation activity (0.48 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs RHE) using intermittent AM 1.5 G (100 mW/cm(2)) standard illumination was found for hybrid films with a thickness of 11 mu m. This phenomenon is attributed to an improved electron transport resulting from a higher magnetite content toward the substrate interface and an increased light absorption due to the hematite layer mainly located at the top surface of the film. The observed high efficiency of alpha-Fe2O3/Fe3O4 nanocomposite photoanodes is attributed to the close proximity and establishment of 3D interfaces between the weakly ferro- (Fe2O3) and ferrimagnetic (Fe3O4) oxides, which in view of their differential chemical constitution and valence states of Fe ions (Fe2+/Fe3+) can enhance the charge separation and thus the overall electrical conductivity of the layer.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2574-0970			WOS:000464491500036

Here we report the growth of Hf-12-porphyrin metal organic frameworks (MOFs) on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for electrocatalytic proton reduction. Covalent attachment of MOF nanoplates to conductive CNTs improves electron transfer from the electrode to Co-porphyrin active sites, which leads to effective proton reduction via protonation of a Co-I-H intermediate. The Hf-12-CoDBP/CNT assembly afforded a turnover number of 32 000 in 30 min with a turnover frequency of 17.7 S-1, placing it among the most active Co-based molecular electrocatalysts.									93	3	0	0	10	0	93			0002-7863			WOS:000451496800009	30392362

During the electrodepositing, a special potential waveform, consisted of a potential step and a potential ramp, was continuously applied on a Pt disk electrode. Various parameters such as potential scan rate, and potential of step were optimized to obtain higher capacity and stability for the formed lead oxide layer. Depend on the potential waveform condition, the morphology and connectivity of the oxide film was changed. The energy storage ability of the prepared lead acid batteries shows a close relation with the morphology of cathode materials. Maximum current efficiency was observed when the potential scan rate reaches to 5 V s(-1). The electrode surface was characterized by SEM. The results showed the high surface area as well as high connectivity between particles resulted at optimum scan rate. Analysis of FFTCCV data of obtained PbO2 in H2SO4 revealed that the electrocatalytic properties, and as well stability of PbO2 layer amplified by increasing scan rates up to an optimum value. In addition, a larger over potential for oxygen evolution reaction was also observed for the electrodes by application of this method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

These generated gases are stored as chemical energy and can later be used as fuels. Among many reported photoactive materials, tin disulfide (SnS2)offers unique advantages due to the earth abundance of tin and its appropriate bandgap. Here, we report the fabrication of high-density two-dimensional vertically aligned SnS2nanoflakesanchored on a conductive substrate for photoelectrochemical water splittingapplication. The as-fabricated nanoflakes were carefully studied, where crystalline,hexagonal SnS2flakes can clearly be observed; their crystal structure has beenindexed with the assistance of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.For photoelectrochemical testing, a Solartron potentiostat was used to perform theindicative electrochemistry tests, including linear polarization, electrochemicalimpedance spectroscopy, and potential static with a light on-offcurrent. A HoribaHal-320 solar simulator was used as a light source to illuminate the active samples placed in a 0.5 M Na3PO4aqueous electrolyte.The incident photon to converted electronfigure was also calculated and was found to have 2.66% efficiency at zero bias (i.e.,spontaneous evolution reaction) and 20.53% efficiency at 1 V bias. This high efficiency is probably due to both the high optical gapof similar to 2.4 eV obtained from these 2D nanostructures and their physical structure that maximizes light trapping of the incident source.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000791598700011

We propose a Cu@Cu2O nanospheres embedded B and N co-doped mesoporous carbon (BNDC) nanoelectrocatalyst to assay dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh). The Cu@Cu2O-BNDC catalyst has been prepared through a single step polymerization, followed by a carbonization. TEM results revealed that Cu@Cu2O nano-particles appeared as nanospheres (size = 30 +/- 5) entrapped on the mesoporous BNDC. Further, the catalyst possesses a specific surface area of 1025 m(2) g(-1) along with a pore size of 4 nm offers enormous active surface area for electrochemical sensing applications. The Cu@Cu2O-BNDC catalyst was employed in electrochemical sensing of DA and ACh in a working range of 0.004-542 mu M and 0.3-2602 mu M, and detection limits of 0.5 nM and 17 nM, respectively. The practicality of the developed sensor has been assessed via DA (pH 7) and ACh (0.1 M NaOH) spiked in human blood serum samples, and satisfactory recovery was obtained. On top of this, the proposed synthetic protocol of the catalyst can be a versatile route to achieve heteroatom doped carbon nanomaterials possessing an enormous surface area and desirable morphology.									40	0	0	0	12	0	40			2168-0485			WOS:000461978200010

However, the synergistic effect between different host metal ions on the electrochemical behavior of LDHs is rarely studied. We prepared a series of LDHs with different host metal combinations and investigated their physiochemical properties and redox behaviors to study the synergistic effects between different active metal ions. According to the experimental and theoretical calculation results, LDHs with dual transition metals possessed lower band-gap energies and higher conductivities than mono-transition metal-based samples. The reduced band-gap energy and enhanced conductivity should be ascribed to the hybridization between 3d-orbitals of different transition atoms. As a result, LDHs with dual transition metals exhibited lower charge transfer resistances and redox potentials as well as longer electron lifetime, implying that they could be oxidized or reduced more easily during the redox process. The lowest charge transfer resistance and longest electron lifetime of NiMn-LDHs signify that the synergistic effect between Ni and Mn is the best. From in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results, more than 50% Ni atoms in NiMn-LDHs can be oxidized under 0.45 V, which also demonstrates the excellent redox efficiency of NiMn-LDHs.

The multiphase approach allows us to consider multiple cell types and multiple chemical species (oxygen and/or nutrients) that are consumed by the tumor. Compared to classical two-phase tumor growth models, the multiphase model can be used to describe a stratified tumor exhibiting several layers of tissue (e.g., proliferating, quiescent and necrotic tissue) more precisely. Our model consists of a convective Cahn-Hilliard type equation to describe the tumor evolution, a velocity equation for the associated volume-averaged velocity field, and a convective reaction-diffusion type equation to describe the density of the chemical species. The velocity equation is either represented by Darcy's law or by the Brinkman equation. We first construct a global weak solution of the multiphase Cahn-Hilliard-Brinkman model. After that, we show that such weak solutions of this system converge to a weak solution of the multiphase Cahn-Hilliard-Darcy system as the viscosities tend to zero in some suitable sense. This means that the existence of a global weak solution to the Cahn-Hilliard-Darcy system is also established.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0360-5302	1532-4133		WOS:000692294200001

Orebodies occur in lenticular and veinlet forms in skarn. The hydrothermal processcan be divided into four stages: garnet skarn stage (Ⅰ), epidote-garnet skarn stage (Ⅱ), magnetite stage (Ⅲ)and quartz-sulfide stage (Ⅳ). The copper mineralization is hosted in the stage Ⅳ quartz-sulfide veins and shows amineral assemblage of quartz-pyrite-chalcopyrite-pyrrhotite. Three types of garnet was recognized in skarn, i. e.,yellow green garnet in garnet skarn, colorless garnet replacing the first type, and colorless garnet with zonation inepidote-garnet skarn. The compositions of garnets of different types are also distinct. With the evolution of the hydrothermalsystem, the average w(Al_2O_3) content in garnet increased from < 1% to ~ 5%, while the Fe~(3+) aupf ingarnets decreased from 2. 15 to 1. 57, indicating the decrease of oxygen fugacity and increase of Al content in theore-forming system. The compositions of garnet and pyroxene in skarn are very similar to those from world-classskarn Mo-Cu-Au deposits. Based on geological characteristics, mineral assemblages and chemistry of skarn minerals,the authors have reached the conclusion that the mineralization of the Sayak skarn copper ore district was generatedby the reaction between magmatic water and limestone. The increase of pH, decrease of temperature and oxygenfugacity induced the deposition of magnetite, pyrite, chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite.			哈萨克斯坦萨亚克铜矿田产于晚石炭世闪长玢岩、石英闪长玢岩或花岗闪长玢岩与中石炭统灰岩的接触带上,铜矿体呈透镜状、脉状产于矽卡岩中。其成矿期可以划分为4个阶段:石榴子石矽卡岩阶段(Ⅰ)、绿帘石-石榴子石矽卡岩阶段(Ⅱ)、磁铁矿阶段(Ⅲ)和石英-硫化物阶段(Ⅳ)。铜矿化主要发生在石英-硫化物阶段,形成石英、黄铁矿、黄铜矿、磁黄铁矿,呈浸染状或脉状产于不同类型的矽卡岩或块状磁铁矿中。矽卡岩中的石榴子石有3种类型:石榴子石矽卡岩中的钙铁榴石(Grt-a)、交代钙铁榴石的含Al钙铁榴石(Grt-b)和绿帘石-石榴子石矽卡岩中具有环带结构的石榴子石(Grt-c)。从第一类到第三类石榴子石,平均w(Al_2O_3)从<1%逐渐升高至~5%;分子式中平均Fe~(3+)原子数从2.15逐渐降低至1.57,显示成矿体系中Al的摩尔浓度逐渐升高、氧逸度逐渐降低。绿帘石-石榴子石矽卡岩中发育少量辉石,属于钙铁辉石-透辉石系列,在辉石分类图中落于普通辉石范围内。矽卡岩的地质特征、矿物组合和矿物化学特征表明,萨亚克矽卡岩是与花岗岩类侵入岩有关的岩浆热液与灰岩通过接触交代反应形成的钙质矽卡岩,随着矽卡岩化和成矿作用的进行,成矿体系的温度和氧逸度逐渐降低、pH值升高,导致磁铁矿和黄铁矿-磁黄铁矿-黄铜矿矿物组合依次发生沉淀。						5	5	0	0	0	0	7			0258-7106			CSCD:5173759

The incomplete remains are those of a young male, aged around 21-35 years at death. The remains show osteological evidence of lepromatous leprosy (LL) and this was confirmed by lipid biomarker analysis and ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis, which provided evidence for both multi-copy and single copy loci from the Mycobacterium leprae genome. Genotyping showed the strain belonged to the 3I lineage, but the Great Chesterford isolate appeared to be ancestral to 3I strains found in later medieval cases in southern Britain and also continental Europe. While a number of contemporaneous cases exist, at present, this case of leprosy is the earliest radiocarbon dated case in Britain confirmed by both aDNA and lipid biomarkers. Importantly, Strontium and Oxygen isotope analysis suggest that the individual is likely to have originated from outside Britain. This potentially sheds light on the origins of the strain in Britain and its subsequent spread to other parts of the world, including the Americas where the 3I lineage of M. leprae is still found in some southern states of America.									27	0	0	0	15	0	27			1932-6203			WOS:000354544200035	25970602

The results indicated that the senescence-induced loss in pigment content, thylakoid membrane integrity and carotenoid-to-chlorophyll (Car-to-Chl) energy transfer efficiency was intensified by exposure to UV-B radiation. Different parameters for the measurement of PS II activity, such as Chl a fluorescence, O-2-evolution and thermoluminescence intensity, were altered during senescence and these alterations were furthered by UV-B irradiation. The damage of photosynthetic apparatus by UV-B exposure in the presence of PAR was less than the damage in absence of PAR. The activation of molecular defense mechanisms could be a factor in the alleviation of UV-B damage in the presence of PAR.									15	3	0	0	11	1	16			0301-634X	1432-2099		WOS:000240062900008	16850336

In nanostructure forms, they have received tremendous attention during the past decade, especially for their applications in high-value organic compound synthesis and fabrication of energy storage devices. While the presence of multivalent cations is an attractive feature for catalytic and energy storage applications of metal ferrite nanostructures, the inherent magnetic nature is another attractive feature for their catalytic applications. With the current surge in the utilization of metal ferrite nanostructures in different technologies, it has become necessary to make a balanced assessment of the progress made in their design and synthesis over the past 20 years, and analyze the performance of these newly designed nanostructures in catalysis and energy storage devices.

Thus, anode gas diffusion electrodes should be selected carefully due to its effect on the overpotentials like mass transfer limitations and ohmic losses inside the cell. In this study, to reduce the cost of polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzers systems, stainless steel mesh electrodes (SS316) were used for a cheaper option as an anodic gas diffusion electrode for the polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzers. Pressure change measurement experiments were conducted to select the best mesh electrode pore size. In the pressure change measurement experiments, the M1 sample had the lowest pressure drops around 1.02 kPa. After the pressure change experiments, the M1 sample was coated by Pt noble metal in different molar ratios using electrodeposition method, like 1 mM (Case 1), 2 mM (Case 2), and 3 mM (Case 3). At 1.9 V, the current density was improved around 300% compared to the uncoated electrode in Case 3 sample. According to the results, it was seen that the Pt coated stainless steel electrode could be used as an alternative cost-effective gas diffusion electrode in polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzer system.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000824743000002

In this work, a facile two-step hydrothermal-annealing method was adopted to synthesize hierarchical core-shell NiCo2O4@NiMoO4 nanoarrays on nickel foam substrate, and by controlling the growth time (2 h, 5 h and 8 h) of NiMoO4 precursor, three different morphologies and sizes of NiMoO4 nanosheets were obtained, and their morphology-dependent electrochemical performance was investigated. The results revealed that NiCo2O4@NiMoO4/NF (5 h) hybrid electrode exhibits a much enhanced specific capacitance of 2806 F g(-1) at 5 A g(-1), nearly three times than that of pristine single-composition NiCo 2 0 4 electrode (974 F g(-1)). The superior performance was attributed to the porous hierarchical structure and reasonable morphology and nanosheets thickness, which could lower electrons transfer resistance and alleviate the strain during repeated redox reactions. Furthermore, the assembled NiCo2O4@NiMoO4 (5 h)//Activated carbon asymmetric supercapacitor shows a high energy density of 64.2 Wh kg(-1) (750 W kg(-1)), and good cycling durability of 87.7% specific capacitance retention over 5000 cycles. This work provides a novel morphology-controllable approach for the synthesis of high performance core-shell electrodes for supercapacitors.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000608512500004

Ultra-thin polyacrylate (PAA) surface coatings with an estimated thickness of less than 5 nm were integrated onto Li-rich Li(NixCoyMnz)O-2 cathodes through a solution-casting method. Obvious improvements of specific charge - around 20 mA h g(-1) at the 1st cycle and up to 50 mA h g(-1) at the 100th cycle - as well as enhanced capacity retention were achieved post the integration of a lithium polyacrylate (LiPAA) surface coating. A fundamental understanding of the role of PAA coatings was systematically achieved by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron microscopy (TEM, SEM/EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS). Physically adhesive coatings on the active sites of cathodes were observed, which might contribute to impeded surface reconstruction of active materials during cycling. Furthermore, in OEMS analysis reduced CO2 evolution was detected from coated electrodes, indicating that the LiPAA coating could interrupt electrolyte decomposition reactions and enhance the cathode/electrolyte interfacial stability at high anodic potentials. This functional polymer coating acts as a stable artificial polymeric interphase to mitigate electrode and electrolyte decomposition during long-term cycling.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448147200056

The 3D macroporous structures were created via templating of polystyrene spheres, followed by infiltration of the desired precursor solution and annealing at high temperature. Using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, it was determined that the use of this 3D transparent conducting oxide with a hematite surface catalyst allowed for a 7-fold increase in active surface area for water splitting with respect to its 2D planar counterpart. This ratio of surface areas was evaluated based on the presence of oxidized trap states on the hematite surface, as determined from the equivalent circuit analysis of the Nyquist plots. Furthermore, the presence of nc-ATO 2D and 3D "underlayer" structures with hematite deposited on top resulted in decreased charge transfer resistances and an increase in the number of available active surface sites at the semiconductor-liquid junction when compared to hematite films lacking any nc-ATO substructures. Finally, absorption, transmission, and reflectance spectra of all of the tested films were measured, suggesting the feasibility of using 3D disordered structures in photoelectrochemical reactions, due to the high absorption of photons by the surface catalyst material and trapping of light within the structure.									66	1	0	0	3	0	65			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000319856300063	23581965

Without typical series-metal interfaces between Si and MoS2, our p-Si/SiOx/MoS2 photocathode showed efficient and stable operation in hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs). The resulting performance could be explained by spatially genuine device architectures in three dimensions (i.e., laterally homo and vertically heterojunction structures). The ALD-grown MoS2 overlayer with the mixed-phase 1T and 2H homojunction passivates light absorber and surface states and functions as a monolithic structure for effective charge transport within MoS2. It is also beneficial in the operation of p-i-n heterojunctions with inhomogeneous barrier heights due to the presence of mixed-phase cocatalysts. The effective barrier heights reached up to 0.8 eV with optimized MoS2 thicknesses, leading to a 670 mV photovoltage enhancement without employing buried Si p-n junctions. The fast-transient behaviors via light illumination show that the mixed-phase layered chalcogenides can serve as efficient cocatalysts by depinning the Fermi levels at the interfaces. A long-term operation of similar to 70 h was also demonstrated in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			2073-4344			WOS:000454711500012

Dipoles formed near the surface of semiconductors induces energy band bending at the interface. Energy band bending control has been demonstrated by employing charged molecules and piezoelectric materials. However, chemical and piezoelectric approaches have demerit of chemical instability and inducement of instantaneous dipole, respectively. To overcome these problems, we adopted the ferroelectric material for PEC water splitting, where spontaneous dipoles in the material can be oriented by applying external electric field. In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized vanadium (V)-doped ferroelectric ZnO nanosheets and employed to systematically investigate the dipole effect on performance of V-doped ZnO PEC for water oxidation. Consequently, positively polarized V-doped ZnO photoanode exhibits 125% enhanced water splitting efficiency compared to negatively polarized ones due to favorable band bending for carrier transport from semiconductor to water.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000409932800002	28721942

Melamine and thio-urea are chosen as precursors for mono and co-doping, respectively. A series of samples with pristine and pretreated CNTs are prepared and characterized physicochemically by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electrochemically by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The obtained results show that co-doping is an effective way for improving ORR activity, due to the synergistic effect of N and S for changing the charge and spin density, respectively. Moreover, thio-urea favors the proportion of pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen configurations within doped samples. As a consequence, our synthesis method gives samples with superior ORR activity. The maximum ORR activity is obtained for NS-OX-CNTs which shows an over potential of 0.95 V vs RHE at 0.1 mA/cm(2), which is comparable to Pt/C (0.98 V vs RHE). The electron transfer number (n) is calculated as 3.9 at 0.4 V which suggests that the ORR proceeds through a dominant 4 e(-) path. These comparable half-cell results to that of Pt/C pave the way for further testing as cathode materials for anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFC).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000849677500001

Among of ZIFs family, the zinc-based imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) and cobalt-based imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) have considered as promising ZIFs materials, which attributed to their tunable porosity, stable structure, and desirable electrical conductivity. To date, various ZIF-8 and ZIF67 derived materials, including carbon materials, metal oxides, sulfides, selenides, carbides and phosphides, have been successfully synthesized using ZIFs as templates and evaluated as promising electrode materials for secondary batteries and electrocatalysis. This review provides an effective guide for the comprehension of the performance optimization and application prospects of ZIFs derivatives, specifically focusing on the optimization of structure and their application in secondary batteries and electrocatalysis. In detail, we present recent advances in the improvement of electrochemical performance of ZIF-8, ZIF-67 and ZIF-8@ZIF-67 derived nanomaterials and their hybrids, including carbon materials, metal oxides, carbides, oxides, sulfides, selenides, and phosphides for high-performance secondary batteries and electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1527-8999	1528-0691		WOS:000839567100001	35959942

Here, we present a convenient bottom-up approach to the fabrication of well-dispersive Pt nanoparticles grown on 3D nitrogen-and sulfur-codoped graphene nanoribbon (Pt/NS-GNR) architectures via a self-assembly process. With a series of intriguing structural features, including large specific surface area, 3D interpenetrating porous carbon networks, a large presence of N and S dopants and homogeneous dispersion of ultrafine Pt nanoparticles, the obtained Pt/NS-GNR hybrid possesses a large electrochemically active surface area, high electrocatalytic activity, reliable long-term durability, as well as good antitoxic ability toward methanol oxidation reaction, far surpassing those of conventional Pt catalysts deposited on commercial carbon black, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and undoped graphene nanoribbon supports. Theoretical simulations further reveal that there are strong electronic interactions between metal and matrix, which could not only immobilize the Pt particles onto the 3D NS-GNR frameworks but also weaken the CO adsorption on the catalytic sites, thereby syner-gistically promoting the methanol oxidation catalytic efficiency.

As the alternatives, hexaazatrinaphthalene (HAT)-based polymers (HATPs) have aroused great attention for a variety of energy-related photo-/electrochemical applications due to their well-defined structure, precisely controllable components as well as excellent flexibility. Recently, tremendous progress has been achieved in the development of low-cost, efficient HATPs catalysts/electrodes for renewable energy technologies and beyond. In this article, we first introduce the structural features of HATPs and discuss the synthetic strategies to construct HATPs with specific functionalities. Then, we narrate the most adopted ex/in situ characterization techniques on HATPs' physical/chemical analysis, emphasizing the importance of using in-situ characterizations to reveal the interaction between the intermediates and the active sites. Furthermore, the recent development of HATPs is summarized based on two aspects, i.e., energy conversion reactions and energy storage devices. Finally, the critical issues, challenges and perspectives in the emerging field are also presented.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000713154000002

Those results suggest that the origin and genesis of the paleo-groundwater in Beishan site are fairly complex,with strong influence of meteoric water in the shallow part,while affected by underground brine in the deep part.Most of calcites were formed due to low temperature fluid reaction.The groundwater environment of Beishan site was relatively stable with a less extent of the water/rock interaction. Compared with Jiujing sub-area,the geochemical environment of Xinchang sub-area is more stable for long-term disposal of high level radioactive waste.			为了探讨高放废物地质处置甘肃北山预选区旧井和新场预选地段的古地下流体来源、成因、化学演化历史以及水-岩相互作用,文章系统研究了该地段花岗岩填隙方解石的产出特征及其碳、氧、锶同位素的组成特征。测试结果表明,旧井和新场方解石的delta~(13)C组成均较稳定且为负值(分别为-11.6~-5.7和-9.9~-5.1);delta~(18)O分别为-0.7~19.7和10.9~21.9,旧井方解石具有更宽的delta~(18)O取值范围。~(87))Sr/~(86)Sr也略有差异,旧井为0.708584~0.718749,新场为0.708838~0.732967,二者随深度增加而呈明显的降低趋势。研究表明,北山预选区地下流体来源及成因较复杂,浅部地下水受大气降水的影响较大,深部流体则主要源于地下咸水,为低温流体蚀变成因。花岗岩裂隙中的水-岩反应强度总体较弱,地下水环境相对稳定。相比较而言,新场岩体深部的地球化学环境更稳定,更有利于高放废物的长期处置。						0	0	0		0	0	0			1000-0658			CSCD:5033953

The new double-template preparation route involves the electrodeposition of Au/Ag alloy within the interstitial (void) spaces of polystyrene (PS) microspheres which are closely packed within the micropores of a polycarbonate membrane (PC), followed by dealloying of the Ag component and dissolution of the microsphere and membrane templates. The net results of combining such sphere lithography and silver etching is the creation of highly regular three-dimensional macro/mesoporous gold architecture with well-controlled sizes and shapes. The morphology and porosity of the new hierarchical porous structures can be tailored by controlling the preparation conditions, such as the composition of the metal mixture plating solution, the size of the microspheres template, or the dealloying time. Such tunable macro/mesoporous hierarchical structures offer control of the electrochemical reactivity and of the fuel mass transport, as illustrated for the enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen-peroxide detection. The new double templated electrodeposition method provides an attractive route for preparing highly controllable multiscale porous materials and diverse morphologies based on different materials and hence holds considerable promise for designing electrocatalytic or bioelectrocatalytic surfaces for a variety sensing and energy applications.									34	0	0	0	2	0	34			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000322958800024	23846732

However, the HER catalytic activities of NiSx reported are relatively low for their poor electrical conductivity. The HER catalytic performance of NiSx is expected to be further enhanced by increasing their electronic conductivity. Constructing heterostructures consisting of noble metal and semiconductor has been proven to be an efficient method to promote their physicochemical performances benefitting from synergistic effects along the metal-semiconductor interface. Here, Au-NiSx heterostructures including core@shell, yolk-shell, and oligomer-like structures have been designed and synthesized by different solvothermal methods. A formation mechanism involving the Kirkendall effect has been proposed for the yolk-shell structure with an empty space around the Au core rather than the seeded grown core@shell structure. Catalytic performance measurements indicate that the Au@NiSx core@shell nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit superior HER catalytic property to Au-NiSx yolk-shell, oligomer-like structures, and "pure" NiSx NPs, resulting from the electron transfer between Au and NiSx interfaces. The overpotentials of Au-NiSx NPs with core@shell and yolk-shell nanostructures are 253 mV and 263 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), respectively, which are lower than those of oligomer-like Au-NiSx (283 mV) and pure NiSx (321 mV) NPs. The Tafel slope of Au@NiSx core@shell structure (43.7 mV/dec) is also the lowest. These results demonstrate that the core@shell NPs possess the best HER performances, followed by their yolk-shell and oligomer-like counterparts. These findings confirm that the physicochemical performances of the metal-semiconductor heterostructures can be efficiently optimized by adjusting the electron transfer through the interface structure control.									13	2	0	0	0	0	13			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000503381200151

These solid solutions all adopt cubic perovskite structure similar to SrTiO3 and high temperature phase of AgTaO3, suggesting that SrTiO3 is helpful to stabilize AgTaO3 in its high temperature cubic phase. Substantial improvements over photocatalytic hydrogen production were realized in these solid solutions which clearly outperform their parent compounds AgTaO3 and SrTiO3. In-situ exolution of silver nanoparticles at the surface of solid solutions (x = 0.2) substantially strengthen the visible light absorption due to localized surface plasmons of these silver nanoparticles. This contributes to further improvements on both photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen production under visible light illumination (lambda >= 400 nm). Apparent quantum efficiency as high as (similar to)2.02% and (similar to)0.11% was achieved at solid solutions (x = 0.2) decorated with silver nanoparticles for full range (lambda >= 250 nm) and visible light (lambda >= 400 nm) illumination respectively. Photoelectrochemical analysis suggests that solid solutions own a better charge separation conditions than their parent compounds. Furthermore, the band edge positions of solid solutions (x = 0.2) lie approximately in the middle between AgTaO3 and SrTiO3, being ideal for solar water splitting reactions.									30	0	0	0	5	0	30			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000483451200032

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in many human diseases. However, the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of BPD remains poorly understood. Here, we exposed neonatal C57BL/6J mice to 95% concentrations of ambient oxygen and established a mouse lung injury model that mimicked human BPD. Next, we compared lncRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles between BPD and normal lung tissues using a high-throughput mouse lncRNA + mRNA array system. Compared with the control group, 882 lncRNAs were upregulated, and 887 lncRNAs were downregulated in BPD lung tissues. We validated some candidate BPD-associated lncRNAs by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis in eight pairs of BPD and normal lung tissues. Gene ontology, pathway and bioinformatics analyses revealed that a downregulated lncRNA, namely AK033210, associated with tenascin C may be involved in the pathogenesis of BPD. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to reveal differential lncRNA expression in BPD, which provides a foundation for further understanding of the molecular mechanism of BPD development.

On the basis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the results clearly showed that Mn ions in different crystal forms of MnO2 could convert from Mn4+ ions to diverse valence states (Mn2+, Mn3+) and produce different oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, the relevant electric properties of samples increased as follows: PZNNT/beta-MnO2 < PZNNT/epsilon-MnO2 < PZNNT/gamma-MnO2. The optimal electric properties could be obtained by adding 1.5 mol% gamma-MnO2, the energy conversion factor (d(33) x g(33)), the mechanical quality factor (Q(m)), the electromechanical coupling factor (k(p)), and the Curie temperature (T-c) which were 9859 x 10(-15) m(2)/N, 357, 0.556, and 315 degrees C, respectively. It indicates that gamma-MnO2-modified PZNNT ceramics are potential candidate materials for piezoelectric energy harvesting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000495975900001

The ammonium ferric citrate-impregnated foams are subsequently converted into iron and nitrogen co-doped 2D porous carbon-flakes by pyrolysis at high temperature in an inert atmosphere. The porous carbon-flakes fabricated at 900 degrees C (MS-Fe-900) possess high surface area (1140.9 m(2) g(-1)) and effective Fe/N co-doping (0.22 at.% Fe and 2.02 at.% N). In comparison with Pt/C, MS-Fe-900 exhibits superior ORR activity (E-0 = 968 my; E-1/2 = 830 mV vs RHE), preferable methanol/CO tolerance and better stability. Furthermore, the MS-Fe-900 -based electrode presents high-rate performance (80.1% capacitance retention from 1 to 100 A g(-1)), and good cycling stability for over 10000 cycles in 6 M KOH electrolyte. This work takes full advantage of the unique structure of biomass and provides a feasible approach to develop cost-efficient and high performance activated carbon materials for ORR electrocatalysis and supercapacitors.

J	Liu, Dandan; Liang, Haiou; Li, Chunping; Bai, Jie								CdS nanoparticles with highly exposed (111) facets decorated on Pt/TiO2 nanotubes for highly efficient photocatalytic H-2 evolution								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				586						152711	10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.152711				JUN 1 2022	2022	Photocatalytic water splitting is a prospective strategy to solve the shortage of human fossil fuel energy. In this work, we designed and synthesized the Pt as co-catalyst decorated on TiO2 nanotubes/metastable zinc-blende (ZB) CdS nanoparticles (NPs) with highly exposed (111) facets (HPTCA3) via the electrospinning-solvothermal and chemical deposition methods. The H-2 evolution rate of HPTCA3 was 15025.38 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1) , which was about 111.3 and 2.4 times stronger than that of pure CdS power and Pt-TiO2/CdS hollow nanotubes (HPTC). The XRD patterns showed the presence of acetate promoted the growth of ZB CdS (1 1 1) crystal facets, and the photogenerated electrons were easily tended to accumulate on the CdS (1 1 1) facets, which was conducive to the transmission of electrons on the CdS and TiO2 interface. The type II heterojunction can broaden the visible light response range and accelerate the separation and transfer of photo-generated electrons and holes which can be supported by the Optical and Electrochemical characterizations. Band structure calculations and XPS spectrum indicated that the composite catalyst had an efficient electron transfer mechanism, which was beneficial for the spatial separation of photogenerated carriers. The work provides a rational photocatalyst design to improve the performance of photocatalytic splitting of water into hydrogen.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000784439900004

Application for a miniaturized resonator antenna								CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL				44	17			20862	20870		10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.08.091				DEC 1 2018	2018	Diluted magnetic oxides attracted a great interest in the last years as materials for spintronics and magneto electric devices. We propose in the present paper such a magnetoelectric ceramic system for an application as miniaturized resonator antenna in GHz range. BaTi1-xFexO3-x/2 (0 <= x <= 0.02) polycrystalline ceramics have been produced by solid state reaction. X-ray diffraction analysis and Rietveld refinement have shown that Fe doping of BaTiO3 lattice produces a transition from tetragonal crystalline symmetry (for x <= 0.01) to a superposition of tetragonal and hexagonal phases for the compositions x = 0.015 and 0.02. As result of Fe addition, the Curie temperature of BaTi1-xFexO3-x/2 ceramics exhibit a shift from 127 degrees C towards lower values and reaches 85 degrees C for x = 0.02. A competition between weak ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic character as a function of composition and temperature is determined both by the presence of transition metal ion and of the oxygen vacancies. Due to its electromagnetic properties, an optimized composition x = 0.01 was used for producing a miniaturized antenna which was found to show a frequency dependent S-11 response similar to the simulated one.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000448226900035

Carbon is usually used as a cathode catalyst, but it reacts with the discharge products (Li2O2, LiO2) to form an insulating layer of lithium carbonate and prevents further reaction. To resolve this issue, the development of non-carbon cathode catalysts is of great demand. Herein, for the first time, we designed and fabricated a MnCo2O4 (MCO) spinel oxide decorated Magneli phase Ti4O7 as a carbon-free cathode for Li-O-2 batteries. The sub-stoichiometric Ti4O7 oxide serves as an electronic conductive network. The MCO spinel oxide along with the synergistic effect between Ti4O7 and MCO facilitate the kinetics of both oxygen reduction and decomposition of Li2O2. Furthermore, uniform anchoring of MCO nanoparticles on Ti4O7 surface provides a stable lithium peroxide-cathode interface during the discharge/charge process. The resulting Ti4O7/MCO hybrid proves to be a highly effective cathode catalyst. The discharge/charge voltage gap of the Ti4O7/MCO hybrid is about 0.75 V, which is significantly lower than that of pure carbon, C + MCO and pristine Ti4O7 cathode. A high specific capacity (5400 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)) and excellent cycling performance (100 cycles at a capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) under 200 mA g(-1)) were obtained for this hybrid. The high catalytic activity and durability renders the Ti4O7/MCO hybrid a highly promising carbon-free cathode for Li-O-2 batteries.									21	2	0	0	0	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000411739700049

Thus, it is important to understand adsorbate solvation at the nanoscale. Here we evaluate the effect of van der Waals (vdW) interactions described by different approaches on the solvation energy of *OH adsorbed on near-surface alloys (NSAs) of Pt. Our results show that the studied functionals can be divided into two groups, each with rather similar average *OH solvation energies: (1) PBE and PW91; and (2) vdW functionals, RPBE, PBE-D3 and RPBE-D3. On average, *OH solvation energies are less negative by similar to 0.14 eV in group (2) compared to (1), and the values for a given alloy can be extrapolated from one functional to another within the same group. Depending on the desired level of accuracy, these concrete observations and our tabulated values can be used to rapidly incorporate solvation into models for electrocatalysis and liquid-phase catalysis.									14	0	0	0	1	0	13			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000482070800001	31348598

Recently, catalysts based on earth abundant elements, such as cobalt oxides, have been studied extensively. Out of many factors, the catalyst particle size certainly affects the photocatalytic activity. To reduce the catalyst particle size below 5 nm without encountering agglomeration, a practical approach is to adopt a proper substrate to immobilize the catalyst nanoparticles. Herein, we utilized MIL-101, a highly porous and robust metal-organic framework (MOF), to immobilize cobalt oxide nanoparticles by a simple and facile method involving double solvent impregnation followed by a mild heat treatment. With cobalt loading in the range of 1.4-4.9 wt%, ultra small cobalt oxide nanoparticles (2-3 nm) have been successfully immobilized in the cages of MIL-101 with a good dispersion and narrow size distribution. Photocatalytic and electrochemical studies have indicated that the resultant cobalt oxide nanoparticles embedded in the MOF are highly efficient and stable water oxidation catalysts. A high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.012 s(-1) per cobalt atom and oxygen yield of 88% were obtained under the optimized conditions in the [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+)-Na2S2O8 system. The MIL-101 support plays the roles of confining the size of catalyst nanoparticles and promoting charge transfer, leading to an enhanced photocatalytic performance.									46	2	0	0	4	0	48			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000363145500022

The a-Si:H semiconductor forms the intrinsic layer in amorphous silicon solar cells whose performance depends on the defect distribution, particularly on the density of dangling bonds. Device-quality intrinsic a-Si:H layer of approx. 1 mum thickness was deposited on n-type Si(100) oriented crystals in 13,56 MHz rf excited parallel plate plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition system. Two types of surface exposures were made: by oxygen and argon plasmas. The Ar plasma-damaged surfaces were covered by an oxide layer prepared by in-situ exposure to pure oxygen atmosphere. In all cases, an uppermost very thin oxide overlayer of 5-10 nm thickness was formed, thicker than the native oxide formed after the PECVD of the amorphous layer. The optical and structural properties of original and damaged surfaces were investigated by reflectance spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction at grazing incidence, respectively. An important transformation of structural properties of a-Si:H on Si(100) was investigated via the evolution of diffraction pattern around 2Theta = 28.5degrees. Electrical properties were determined by the charge version of deep level transient spectroscopy, C-V and I-V measurements. Bias annealing procedures lead to the a MIS structure without deep states at the interface. The results obtained are compared with these measured on ion beam exposed a-Si:H surfaces [V. Nadazdy, R.

J	Vayda, ME; Small, DJ; Yuan, ML; Costello, L; Sidell, BD								Conservation of the myoglobin gene among Antarctic notothenioid fishes								MOLECULAR MARINE BIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY				6	3			207	216						SEP 1997	1997	We determined the myoglobin cDNA sequence for seven Antarctic notothenioid fish species. These data identify mutations in the myoglobin gene for Champsocephalus gunnari and Pagetopsis macropterus, two icefish species that lack detectable quantities of the polypeptide but express myoglobin mRNA. A third species lacking myoglobin polypeptide, Chaenocephalus aceratus, is devoid of myoglobin mRNA and accordingly failed to produce myoglobin products on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Myoglobin cDNA sequences were highly conserved among the species that express the protein, particularly in the coding region. Sequence variation among the myoglobin-expressing channichthyid species was 2.0% to 2.9% in the coding region and 2.6% to 3.3% over the entire cDNA. The same extent of variation, 1.6% to 3.2% in the coding sequence and 2.8% to 3.7% overall, was observed between the icefishes and more distantly related, red-blooded nototheniid species. The two species expressing mutant myoglobin mRNA, C. gunnari and P. macropterus, exhibited the highest degree of sequence variation among the fish myoglobins examined. Drift of the myoglobin sequence in these two species, and conservation of myoglobin cDNA among fishes from two distinct families, suggest that a selective pressure operates to maintain myoglobin in the species that express the protein.									20	0	1	0	17	0	25			1053-6426			WOS:A1997XT50600007	9284559

Herein, a comprehensive set of spectroelectrochemical techniques (impedance spectroscopy, intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS), and operando UV-vis spectroscopy) are deployed to clearly uncover the role of pH on the performance of hematite photoanodes. Our results reveal that, despite the presence of high-valent iron-oxo active sites over a wide pH range (7-13.6), the observed performance improvement with increasing pH is mainly driven by the reduction of surface accumulated charges, in the form of reactive intermediate species, that alleviates Fermi level pinning (FLP). Interestingly, IMPS data provides compelling evidence that the mitigation of FLP originates from changes in the reaction mechanism which boost the rate of charge transfer reducing, in turn, the surface charging. Additionally, we present a phenomenological analysis of the IMVS response which brings to light the additional impact of the electrolyte pH on the surface-related recombination dynamics. Our work identifies the pH-dependent kinetics of water oxidation as the key step governing the performance, defining not only the efficiency of charge transfer across the interface but also the degree of FLP that determines both the photocurrent magnitude and onset potential.									38	0	0	0	1	0	38			2574-0962			WOS:000487770000079

Here, we present a systematic study on the structural evolution of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks hybridized on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) during the carbonization process. We show that a number of typical products can be obtained, depending on the annealing time, including (1) CNTs wrapped by relatively thick carbon layers, (2) CNTs grafted by ZnO nanoparticles which are covered by thin nitrogen-doped carbon layers, and (3) CNTs grafted by aggregated ZnO nanoparticles. We also investigated the electrochemical properties of those hybrid structures as freestanding membrane electrodes for lithium ion batteries, and the second one (CNT-supported ZnO covered by N-doped carbon) shows the best performance with a high specific capacity (850 mA h/g at a current density of 100 mA/g) and excellent cycling stability. Our results indicate that tailoring and optimizing the MOF-CNT hybrid structure is essential for developing high-performance energy storage systems.									83	8	0	0	2	0	88			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000414506600033	28990751

A PEM single cell containing only 0.1 mg cm(-2) of IrO2 as anode catalyst and 50 wt.% metallic Ti achieved 1.73 Vat 1 A cm(-2) and 80 degrees C. Such level of performance is similar to those usually obtained with conventional loadings of several mg cm(-2) of IrO2 at the anode side. SEM observations and EIS measurements revealed that the micro-sized titanium particles added to the anodic catalyst layer favor an intimate electrical contact between the catalyst layer and the current collector, and contribute to the reduction of the ohmic resistance of the catalytic layer. A long-term water electrolysis experiment using IrO2/Ti as anode material demonstrated a good stability of the MEA over 1000 h of operation. Using such a low IrO2 loading (0.1 mg cm(-2) IrO2), the degradation rate measured at 1 A cm(-2) was reduced from 180 mu V h(-1) (measurement made on pure IrO2 anode) down to only 20 mu V h(-1) for the 50 wt.% IrO2/Ti anode.

The results indicate that open circuit potential moves negatively from -130 mV to -280 mV and the time for reaching stable state changes from 400 s to 800 s when the concentration of thiourea increases from 0 to 0.2 mol/L. The anodic current peak at cyclic voltammetric curves represents oxidation of gold, current increasing rapidly after 850 mV results from the evolution of oxygen when scanning positively, while the cathodic reduction peak at 220 mV is the reduction of gold-thiourea complex ion when scanning negatively. The peak potential of anodic oxidation moves negatively for 30 mV with the addition of thiourea, and peak current is raised 15.5 times. Anodic peak potential and current change from 655 mV down to 480 mV and from 1.985 mA down to 0.09528 mA, respectively when the concentration of thiourea increases from 0.05 mol/L to 0.20 mol/L. Anodic dissolution of gold becomes easier when improving pH value of solution. The peak current increases from 0.761 mA to 4.387 mA sharply and peak potential decreases from 655 mV to 596 mV when temperature rises from 25℃ to 35℃. However, too high temperature will result in the decomposition of thiourea, so room temperature is optimal.

Herein, a facile citrate-assisted method was developed for growing uniform amorphous FeOOH overlayer on nanoporous BiVO4, which significantly improved the water oxidation kinetics and resulted in a remarkable photocurrent density of 3.33 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V (vs. RHE). The activity enhancement was even superior to the well-crystallized alpha-FeOOH and beta-FeOOH modified BiVO4. The citrate serves as the bridging agent that not only optimizes the BiVO4/FeOOH interface facilitating the hole trapping/transport, but also inhibits the particle growth of FeOOH nanolayer and provides more oxygen vacancies to promote the water oxidation. We demonstrate that the uniform FeOOH overlayer acts as the hole storage layer and catalyst, which increases the potential drop in the Helmholtz layer and greatly facilitates the interfacial hole transfer. Moreover, the citrate-assisted modification method was proved to be a general strategy to improve the PEC performance of TiO2 and alpha-Fe2O3 photoanodes. Our work provides a simple and effective design strategy for constructing uniform semiconductor/electrocatalysts interface that can realize efficient solar-to-hydrogen conversion.

Suitable protection layers for tandem devices should be conductive, transparent, and stable in strongly acidic or alkaline solutions. This paper shows that under certain conditions n-type semiconductors, such as TiO2, can be used as protection layers for Si-based photoanodes. It also provides evidence that even in a photoanode assembly TiO2 is conducting only electrons (not holes as in p-type protection layers), and therefore TiO2 can be described as a simple ohmic contact. This renders n-type semiconductors, such as TiO2, to be versatile and simple protection layers, which can be used for photoanodes and as previously shown for photocathodes. The ohmic behavior of n-type TiO2 in a Si/TiO(2)photoanode assembly is demonstrated under dark and illuminated conditions by performing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and using the Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox couple. These measurements reveal that the performance of the Si/TiO2-photoanode assembly is strongly dependent on the TiO2/electrolyte interaction. Finally, the conditions and requirements that make TiO2 generally applicable for photoanode assemblies, and thus for protecting tandem devices, are outlined and quantitatively shown by band diagram calculations. The results presented here provide the understanding required for the design of highly efficient and stable photoelectrochemical water splitting devices.									70	0	0	0	3	0	70			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000357964900023

Transmission electron microscopy observations have been also performed in order to analyze the evolution of the structure and the morphology of the films with the heat treatment. The optical observation results indicate that in the range of incident photon energy between 3 and 5.5 eV both direct and indirect transitions take place in the analyzed films. The variation of the Hall mobility and conductivity with the annealing temperature can be ascribed to increase in the grain size and to decrease in the oxygen vacancies of the films after heat-treatment.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0927-0248			WOS:A1993MH98700012

Here, we report a simple strategy to obtain metal sulfide (Ni3S2, Co9S8 and FeS) foams by in situ conversion of commercial Ni, Co and Fe foams through a conventional annealing reaction. Interestingly, N-doped carbon nanotubes, which are catalyzed by the corresponding metal sulfide nanocrystals, can also be obtained on the surface of the foams. The as formed Ni3S2 foams can work as bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting with a potential of 1.5 V and 1.72 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, which are comparable to the state-of-the-art transition-metal-sulfide-based bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. Factors such as abundant electrocatalytic active sites and excellent conductivity contribute to the gas evolution properties of nickel sulfide foams. Interestingly, the prominent performance of the nickel sulfide foams is also due to the nanotube array coating which provides special superaerophobic structures. The unique surface geometry provides little solid-gas contact area (solid content as low as 2%) at the electrode/bubble interface, and ultrasmall gas bubbles with diameters below 100 mu m can leave the surface of the electrodes with ease, which effectively reduces the bubble overpotential and greatly promotes gas evolution properties especially at high current densities. Our research provides a facile strategy to obtain superaerophobic surface geometry for in situ prepared transition metal sulfide foams, which can work as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting at large current densities. These findings may bring new insights in the design of efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									45	3	0	0	1	0	45			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536095500044

While most subunits form the catalytic core responsible for water oxidation, PsbO, PsbP and PsbQ form an extrinsic domain exposed to the luminal side of the membrane. In vitro studies have shown that these subunits have a role in modulating the function of Cl- and Ca2+, but their role(s) in vivo remains to be elucidated, as the relationships between ion concentrations and extrinsic polypeptides are not clear. With the aim of understanding these relationships, the photosynthetic apparatus of the extreme halophyte Salicornia veneta has been compared with that of spinach. Compared to glycophytes, halophytes have a different ionic composition, which could be expected to modulate the role of extrinsic polypeptides.Structure and function of in vivo and in vitro PSII in S. veneta were investigated and compared to spinach. Light and electron microscopy, oxygen evolution, gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, DNA sequencing, RT-PCR and time-resolved chlorophyll fluorescence were used.Thylakoids of S. veneta did not contain PsbQ protein and its mRNA was absent. When compared to spinach, PsbP was partly depleted (30 %), as was its mRNA. All other thylakoid subunits were present in similar amounts in both species. PSII electron transfer was not affected. Fluorescence was strongly quenched upon irradiation of plants with high light, and relaxed only after prolonged dark incubation. Quenching of fluorescence was not linked to degradation of D1 protein.In S. veneta the PsbQ protein is not necessary for photosynthesis in vivo. As the amount of PsbP is sub-stoichiometric with other PSII subunits, this protein too is largely dispensable from a catalytic standpoint. One possibility is that PsbP acts as an assembly factor for PSII.									18	1	0	0	16	0	18			0305-7364	1095-8290		WOS:000262717800011	19033288

Here we report photochemical reduction of CO2 with H2O into syngas using core/shell Au@Cr2O3 dual cocatalyst-decorated multistacked InGaN/GaN nanowires (NWs) with sunlight as the only energy input. First-principle density functional theory calculations revealed that Au and Cr2O3 are synergetic in deforming the linear CO2 molecule to a bent state with an O-C-O angle of 116.5°, thus significantly reducing the energy barrier of CO2RR compared with that over a single component of Au or Cr2O3. Hydrogen evolution reaction was promoted by the same cocatalyst simultaneously. By combining the cooperative catalytic properties of Au@Cr2O3 with the distinguished optoelectronic virtues of the multistacked InGaN NW semiconductor, the developed photocatalyst demonstrated high syngas activity of 1.08 mol/gcat/h with widely tunable H2/CO ratios between 1.6 and 9.2 under concentrated solar light illumination. Nearly stoichiometric oxygen was evolved from water splitting at a rate of 0.57 mol/gcat/h, and isotopic testing confirmed that syngas originated from CO2RR. The solar-to-syngas energy efficiency approached 0.89% during overall CO2 reduction coupled with water splitting. The work paves a way for carbon-neutral synthesis of syngas with the sole inputs of CO2, H2O, and solar light.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1091-6490		MEDLINE:35727969	35727969

Herein, a bimetallic Mn/CoOx film, prepared by high-temperature annealing of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), is designed as an efficient cocatalyst to modify alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode (FTO/Sn@alpha-Fe2O3-Mn/CoOx) for PEC water oxidation. With an optimized content of Mn/CoOx cocatalyst, the FTO/Sn@alpha-Fe2O3-Mn/CoOx photoanode exhibits an excellent photocurrent density of 2.66 mA/cm2 at 1.23 VRHE , which is higher than that of CoOx (1.43 mA/cm2) or MnOx (1.86 mA/cm2) single-metal catalyst. The on-set potential achieves a remarkable cathodic shift of 0.11 V. The detailed mechanism studies demonstrate that the electron donation from Mn/CoOx cocatalyst to alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode can obtain high oxidation state of Mn and Co to enhance photogenerated carriers separation efficiency, reduce recombination and facilitate the OH- transformation, which synergically increases the catalytic activities of FTO/Sn@alpha-Fe2O3-Mn/CoOx photoanode for PEC water oxidation. Furthermore, a heterojunction, formed by Mn/CoOx doping in the surface alpha-Fe2O3, can further enhance the photogenerated carriers separation efficiency. This work provides valuable guidance for the design and construction of bimetallic cocatalyst on various photoelectrodes for outstanding PEC water splitting performance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000729171300002

Here, we develop a continuum representation of a semiconductor/electrolyte interface [i.e., the rutile TiO2 (110)/electrolyte interface] incorporated with coupled Langmuir adsorption of electrons/protons to compute the potential distributions in the space charge layer and electric double layer at the interface. We further investigate the effects of double layers on the surface Pourbaix diagram of the first step of water oxidation (i.e., OH* formation) and (non-)Nernstian pH dependence of the oxidation potential. Our calculation shows that the double-layer potential shifts the lines corresponding to deprotonation and oxidation in the surface Pourbaix diagram to higher pH and lower potential compared to those in aqueous solution. Under acidic conditions, the pH dependence of oxidation potential follows the Nernstian relation and becomes non-Nernstian under alkaline conditions. The implication is that acidic conditions would be more appropriate for water oxidation with minimal overpotentials. Finally, not only can the method presented in this work be applied to studying thermodynamics of semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces but it can also be extended to nonequilibrium conditions with finite current and rates of surface proton/electron transfer reactions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000566496200017

Density functional calculations have here been used to revisit the mechanism of O-O bond formation catalyzed by a pentanuclear iron complex. By comparing energetics for O-O bond formation at different oxidation states, it is suggested that the formally Fe-5(III,III,III,IV,IV) state is the best candidate for the coupling of two oxo groups, with a barrier of 17.3 kcal/mol, rather than the previously suggested lower oxidation state of Fe-5(II,II,III,IV,IV). Importantly, the first water insertion into the Fe-5(III,III,III,III,III) complex is associated with a barrier of 18.8 kcal/mol. The calculated barrier is somewhat overestimated as discussed in the text. Other possible reaction pathways, including water attack at the Fe-5(III,III,III,IV,IV) state, coupling of oxo and hydroxide at the Fe-5(III,III,III,III,IV) state, and coupling of two oxo groups at the Fe-5(III,III,IV,IV,IV) state, were found to have much higher barriers.									17	2	0	0	0	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000453491100067

Two kinds of TiO2 electrodes (amorphous and anatase) were tested for the H-doping in different annealing conditions, but H-doped anatase was obtained exclusively by a rapid heat treatment in hydrogen atmosphere of amorphous TiO2 at 300 degrees C. Instead, anatase thin films required enforced annealing conditions to incorporate H, leading to an undesirable conversion to rutile. XPS analysis reveals that in H-doped anatase thin films H atoms are bonded to O. DFT calculations, performed to investigate the density of states, predict a slight band-gap narrowing, in agreement with spectroscopic evidence. Photoelectrochemical measurements on H:TiO2 showed an elevated current density of 0.99 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE in oxygen evolution reaction, revealing better performance than pure anatase TiO2. This enhancement in catalytic activity is accounted to the effect of dangling bonds passivation performed by highly reactive H atoms, which reduce the density of carrier recombination centers. The used method for the conversion of amorphous TiO2 thin film in H:doped anatase TiO2 can be extended to amorphous TiO2 prepared by various techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This research aimed to investigate the optimum condition for modification of thermal decomposition properties of AP particles through microencapsulation techniques. DSC/TG and SEM have been exploited to investigate the thermal properties, heat of decomposition and coating morphology of samples. Our primarily evolutions have been shown that although AP microparticle could be effectively coated with NC and viton A, but a significant loss of heat of decomposition occurs with the latter one, so NC was preferred as a alternative coating agents to further investigate its effectiveness in AP microencapsulation and to optimize the parameters affecting on this process. The results shown, the first stage decomposition temperature of NC coated samples increases about 12 degrees C with respect to uncoated sample and reaches to 305 C at proposed optimum conditions. Also, the apparent activation parameters of the decomposition processes of the samples were verified by ASTM and Ozawa methods. Finally, the results of this investigation showed that microencapsulation of AP particles with fibrous NC, enhancing the heat of decomposition (-120 J/g) without obviously effect on kinetic parameters and thermal decomposition temperature.					9th International Autumn Seminar on Propellants, Explosives and Pyrotechnics9th International Autumn Seminar on Propellants, Explosives and Pyrotechnics	SEP 20-23, 2011SEP 20-23, 2011	China Ordinance Soc; Beijing Inst Technol; Hubei Inst Aerosp Chemotechnol; CAEP, Inst Chem Mat; Shaanxi Appl Phys Chem Res Inst, Sci & Technol Appl Phys Chem Lab; Internal Flow & Thermo Structure Lab, Sci & Technol Combust; Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol; N Univ ChinaChina Ordinance Soc; Beijing Inst Technol; Hubei Inst Aerosp Chemotechnol; CAEP, Inst Chem Mat; Shaanxi Appl Phys Chem Res Inst, Sci & Technol Appl Phys Chem Lab; Internal Flow & Thermo Structure Lab, Sci & Technol Combust; Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol; N Univ China	Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINANanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-7-03-032045-2	WOS:000391156800047

In addition, a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) was fabricated comprising the Fe-MoS2@NF and O, N, S@AC as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The fabricated HSC exhibits a high specific capacity of 60 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and delivers an excellent specific energy of 49.4 Wh kg(-1) corresponding to a specific power of 827 W kg(-1) and maintains the specific energy of 10.2 Wh kg(-1) at a high specific power of 13.42 kW kg(-1). Moreover, the device showed a better cyclic stability similar to 91 % for 10,000 charge/discharge cycles. Thus, the design concept of the electrode opens a new avenue towards the battery type supercapacitor applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000708796900004

To calculate the associated energy for deoxidation, an experiment was designed to set up the parameters for oxygen partitioning among deoxidants, with timed aluminum addition during teeming being the main parameter. The temperature control in the teeming stage presented a standard deviation for the error of prediction of 5.46 ºC, for transportation from the rinsing station to the secondary metallurgy of 2.79 ºC. The association of all calculations presented an error standard deviation of 7.49 ºC. The operational validation presented superior accuracy compared with the current method for controlling the temperature, resulting in a reduction in the aluminum consumption for heating at secondary metallurgy with a potential economy of U$ 4.07 million per year for a steel shop producing 5 million tons of steel yearly. The artificial neural network model confirmed its capacity for modeling a complex multivariable process and the separation of thermodynamic calculation provides a better adaptability to different steel grades with different teeming strategies.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2448-167X			SCIELO:S2448-167X2018000400587

The DSA electrodes were manufactured with a sheet of A304 stainless steel or Ti as the substrate, applying a coating of RuO2 by the modified Pechini method. Also, different types of materials were tested as cathodes, including plates of titanium (Ti), silver (Ag), stainless steels A304 and A316, graphite rods (GR), glassy carbon (VC) and platinum (Pt). The results showed that the use of A304 vertical bar RuO2 and Ti vertical bar RuO2 DSA electrodes allowed lower cathodic potentials (<= 1.0 V) for the start of the water reduction reaction to produce H-2(g). The best arrangement and electrode material for the catalytic production of H-2(g) was a DSA electrode of A304 vertical bar RuO2 and A304 stainless steel plate as the cathode, which was even better than platinum, showing a high stability to modify their surface and structure. In conclusion, the use of a A304 stainless steel plate as a substrate instead of titanium to prepare DSA electrodes of A304/RuO2 for the catalytic production of H-2(g) is viable and inexpensive.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1452-3981			WOS:000452568200064

In-situ Co and ex-situ Sn are co-doped into alpha-Fe2O3 nanorods to improve the photoelectrochemical response of the photoanode. It is found that Sn mono-doping enhances the photocurrent density to 0.93 mA/cm(2) under AM 1.5 G illumination. However, the onset potential of the photocurrent shifts positively by similar to 100 mV. By introducing additional Co dopant, the photocurrent density can be further improved to 1.25 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V (vs. RHE), about four folds that of pristine Fe2O3 photoanode. Moreover, the onset potential of the (Co, Sn) co-doped Fe2O3 photoanode exhibits similar to 140 mV cathodic shift comparing with that of Sn mono-doped one. Electrochemical analysis suggests that the Sn doping mainly contributes to the increased carriers density, while Co doping mostly improves the surface kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction on Fe2O3 nanorods. The cooperation of Co and Sn into Fe2O3 nanorods yields a high incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies of 23% at 350 nm. Our work provides a facile co-doping method to improve both the photocurrent and onset potential of the Fe2O3 photoanode. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Silica NPs-incorporated TiO2 nanofibers, which have a more significant band gap and longer electrons lifetime compared to pristine TiO2, were used as a catalyst. The nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning of amorphous SiO2 NPs/titanium isopropoxide/poly (vinyl acetate)/N, N-dimethylformamide colloid. Physicochemical characterizations confirmed the preparation of well morphology SiO2-TiO2 nanofibers with a bandgap energy of 3.265 eV. Under visible light radiation, hydrogen and oxygen were obtained in good stoichiometric rates (9.5 and 4.7 mL/min/gcat, respectively) without any considerable change in the dye concentration, which proves the successful exploitation of the dye as a photosensitizer. Under UV irradiation, SiO2 NPs incorporation distinctly enhanced the dye photodegradation, as around 91 and 94% removal efficiency were obtained from TiO2 nanofibers containing 4 and 6 wt% of the used dopant, respectively, within 60 min.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4360		WOS:000760476600001	35160513

Hydrogenation has been successfully used to enhance the responses of the Cu0.27Co2.73O4 nanooctahedron sensors to acetone, ethanol, and n-butyl-amine. The enhancement of the response results from the increase in the number of 3-coordinated Co/Cu atoms (Co(3)c/Cu(3)c) at the (111) plane of Cu0.27Co2.73O4 through removing O-H groups and Cl- ions at the surface by hydrogenation. The Co(3)c/Cu(3)c atoms on the (111) plane of Cu0.27Co2.73O4 are considered to function as the gas response active centers. These Co(3)c/Cu(3)c active atoms have three functions: generating electrons, adsorbing oxygen from air, and catalyzing the sensing reactions. The hydrogenation polar surface approach can be applied to improve the performances of other sensing materials. Such sensing mechanisms of the Co(3)c/Cu(3)c unsaturated atoms as the active centers can be conducive to understanding the gas-sensing essence and the development of sensing materials with high performances.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0743-7463			WOS:000718188900004	34698494

In this study, a novel two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) oxygen-doped g-C3N4/BiOI heterostructure nano-sphere (O-g-C3N4/BiOI) was successfully prepared by a facile solvothermal method for the degradation of nondye organic contaminants.Its composition, morphological characteristics, chemical structure and electrochemical properties have been measured. The result shows the introduction of oxygen doping (O-doping) causes a new defect energy level, extends the light absorption range, and the formation of heterojunction enables the effective separation of photo-generated carriers. Under visible light irradiation, the optimum ratio of O-g-C3N4/BiOI (2:1) exhibited 100% removal efficiency of bisphenol A within 80 min, which was about 9.1, 2.33, 3.45, and 1.6 times that of pure g-C3N4, O-g-C3N4/BiOI, and O-doped-poor heterostructure, respectively. Based on the identified intermediates, the photocatalytic mechanism of O-doped O-g-C3N4/BiOI (2:1) was also revealed. This finding suggested that the synergistic effect between 2D/3D heterojunction and O-doped greatly promoted visible light photoabsorption and photoinduced carrier separation efficiency with a prolonged lifetime, which was confirmed by multiple optical and electrochemical analyses. This study could bring new opportunities for the rational design of highly efficient photocatalysts by combining 2D/3D heterojunctions with O-doped in environmental remediation.

Herein, ZnIn2S4 nanoribbons were integrated with hierarchical CeO2 hollow spheres to construct heterostructure using an oil bath approach under mild conditions. The optimized CeO2/ZnIn2S4 presented a superior photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of 69 lmol/h, which is about 4.9 and 11.5 times greater than pristine ZnIn2S4 and CeO2, respectively. In addition, its apparent quantum yield achieved 7.6% at 420 nm. The improved photoactivity of the CeO2/ZnIn2S4 heterojunction can be referable to the cooperative effects of the aligned bandgap structures, strong visible-light-harvesting capacity, and interfacial interactions via the internal electric field. This study provides insights into the protocols for rational design of S-scheme heterojunction catalysts for high-efficiency hydrogen evolution via sustainable photocatalytic water splitting.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Thermal transformation of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has been demonstrated as a promising route for the synthesis of supported metal NPs with high metal loadings, but it is challenge to achieve uniform metal dispersion. Here we report a strategy of "spatial isolation and dopant anchoring" to resist metal aggregation in the pyrolysis of MOFs through converting a bulk MOF into dual-heteroatom-containing flower-like MOF sheets (B/N-MOF-S). This approach can spatially isolate metal ions and increase the number of anchoring sites, thus efficiently building physical and/or chemical barriers to cooperatively prevent metal NPs from aggregation in the high-temperature transformation process. After thermolysis at 1,000 degrees C, the B/N-MOFS affords B,N co-doped carbon-supported Co NPs (Co/BNC) with uniform dispersion and a high Co loading of 37.3 wt%, while untreated bulk MOFs yield much larger sizes and uneven distribution of Co NPs. The as-obtained Co/BNC exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activities in both hydrogen evolution and hydrazine oxidation reactions, and only a voltage of 0.617 V at a high current density of 100 mA.cm(-2) is required when applied to a two-electrode overall hydrazine splitting electrolyzer.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000839590100002

Transition metal layered double hydroxide (LDH) has a great potential in electrocatalysis due to its unique sheet-like nanostructure and low cost. However, the poor electrical conductivity and sluggish water dissociation process hinder their development. Herein, the interface effect of Schottky heterostructure between cobalt-iron hydroxide and MXene and surface electron density modification with phosphorus (P) doping provide an efficient method to solve these crucial issues. The novel Schottky heterostructure catalyst (P-CoFe-LDH@MXene/NF) with self-driven charge transfer can enhance electron transport efficiency. In addition, the surface electron density optimized by P-doping will promote the ability of H+/OH- ion adsorption and redox reaction for overall water splitting. The as-prepared P-CoFe-LDH@MXene/NF requires overpotentials of only 85 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for HER and 252 mV at 200 mA cm-2 for OER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. And under an alkaline electrolyzer, it can be driven 10 mA cm-2 at a low voltage of 1.52 V for overall water splitting with remarkable durability for 100 h. More broadly, this design concept is universal and it can be extended to design other transition metal-based catalysts.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000703601600002

Herein, a commercial membrane electrode assembly with an amorphous IrOx anode is subjected to potential sweeping (1.4-1.8 V) with short and long holds and few steady-state interims for overall 830 h at 60 degrees C and ambient pressure to simulate frequent alternating idle and nominal operation regimes. Systematic electrochemical diagnostics and physicochemical methods are applied to identify degradation sources. Mild kinetic deactivation (2.6 mu V/h) is observed independent on the dynamic protocol, due to loss of electrochemical surface area via crystallization. The amount of Ir dissolved and redeposited in the ionomer anode phase and in the membrane is negligible in comparison to the current state-of-the-art Ir loadings. As compared to kinetic losses, the irreversible resistive losses are one order of magnitude higher and are thought to be caused by the degradation of the membrane close to the anode catalyst layer. These resistive losses are associated specifically with dynamic operation. The two orders of magnitude higher, but recoverable, degradation during steady-state interims is attributed to the growth of inhibiting or long-lived species.									19	0	1	0	1	0	19			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000594133900002

Herein, we investigate the effect of electrolyte pH on the formation of nickel oxide (NiOx) films in borate solutions and examine their corresponding electrochromic characteristics. The result shows that the formation of hexa-aquo Ni complexes due to an appropriate electrolyte pH can aid the electrodeposition of NiOx films and produce a film of small grains. Raman and in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements indicate that the structure of the NiOx films in their oxidized state is similar to gamma-NiOOH, regardless of the electrolyte pH, although the grain size of the films is dependent on the electrolyte pH. The different grain size results in significant differences in electrochromic performance. The film made of small grain size exhibits the best electrochromic performance. The optical contrast of the NiOx film achieved 87%. The coloration efficiency increased by about 50% to 51 cm(2)/C and the switching time reduced to 5.4 s for bleaching. These results demonstrate the imperative for an appropriate electrolyte pH to enable sustained electrochemical activity, reactive site formation, and functional stability.

However, most electrocatalysts still suffer from the challenge of an increase in the loading of active materials without sacrificing the geometry area. In this work, a CoFe2O4@Ni3S2/NF composite was achieved through a series of hydrothermal and annealing processes by means of constructing a vertically stacked bilayer heterostructure CoFe2O4@Ni3S2 on a 3D porous nickel foam (NF). The structure and morphology of the as-synthesized catalyst have been characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. The as-obtained CoFe2O4@Ni3S2/NF electrode, which possesses a vertically stacked bilayer nanosheet heterostructure, displays an improved OER performance and cyclic stability and shows an early onset potential with a low overpotential (231 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) in a 1.0 M KOH solution. In addition, CoFe2O4@Ni3S2/NF demonstrates dependable durability and delivers outstanding current density of similar to 15 mA cm(-2) without activity degradation for 20 h. This approach provides a new insight into developing earth-abundant, low-cost and high-efficiency OER electrocatalysts.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000509895700032

A typical application in nanofabrication involves the synthesis of nanoporous materials by selective electrolytic leaching, during which an electrical bias voltage is used to drive the removal of sacrificial elements. Here we report on an electrolytic cell configuration that can do the selective leaching work without the need of external electrical energy, taking advantage of two phenomena: On one hand, during the "spontaneous" discharge of a metal-air battery, materials are removed from the anode; on the other hand, during nanofabrication by "nonspontaneous" selective leaching, sacrificial elements are removed from the starting material. We integrate these two processes in such a way that both "battery discharging" and "selective leaching" occur simultaneously. Here we have demonstrated the concept through the fabrication of nanoporous Au by selective leaching of Ag from Au/Ag parent materials in a nonoxidizing aqueous solution, a process that absolutely requires an electrical energy to drive the removal of Ag. In our integrated cell configuration, no external electrical energy was used. This new concept can be extended to the fabrication of a broad range of nanoporous materials under mild conditions, including the use of pure water as electrolyte as demonstrated in this work.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2574-0970			WOS:000461400900045

The photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) performance of the composite electrode was examined by the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of methylene blue (MB) and sulfadiazinmu (SD) under a 500 W Xe lamp with a UV light cutoff filter (lambda >= 410 nm). The MoS2/TiO2 heterostructure photoelectrode presented a significantly enhanced PEC activity than the pure TiO2 NTs owing to its stronger light-harvesting ability and improved separation of photogenerated electrons and holes in comparison with TiO2 nanotubes. The obviously reduced electron-hole recombination rates of MoS2/TiO2 were demonstrated from PL spectroscopy measurements and the photoelectrochemical evaluation. The degradation rate of MoS2/TiO2 NTs photoelectrode for PEC degradation of MB and SD was 3 times that of TiO2 NTs photoelectrode. It was found that holes and single oxygen act as the main oxidative species. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									65	6	0	0	4	0	66			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000410609400063

Notwithstanding RuO2 is known as a highly active catalyst for a wide number of (photo) electrochemical reactions in aqueous/humid environments, the study of the interaction of RuO2 surfaces with water has been confined largely to (static) surface science and water adsorption calculations. Herein, an atomistic understanding of bulk rutile RuO2 and explicit solvent effects on (11 0)-RuO2 facet are provided. We especially focus on the comprehension of the mechanistic interplay between surface wettability, interfacial water dynamics and surface chemical activity. Analysis and characterization of the interfacial water and H-bond environment reveal how explicit liquid water and its dynamics play a role in the surface reconstruction and in the hydrophobic nature of the (11 0)-RuO2 facet with a prevailing H-bond acceptor character. Moreover, we provide a dependence of physical and chemical properties, such as surface electric field and work function, from different degrees of surface wettability of the (11 0)-RuO2 facet. Results on bulk properties of crystalline ruthenium dioxide RuO2 are in good agreement with the nowadays available experimental evidences and previous DFT studies.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000711077200005

To this end, potassium ions have been attached to the front side of a 250 nm thick sample of PMO. The majority of the potassium ions become neutralized at the surface of the PMO, while some of the potassium ions diffuse through. Ex situ analysis of the sample by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) reveals pronounced concentration profiles of the potassium, which is indicative of diffusion. Two diffusion coefficients have been obtained, namely, the bulk diffusion coefficient and the diffusion coefficient associated with the grain boundaries. The latter conclusion is supported by transmission electron microscopy of thin lamella cut out from the sample, which reveals twin grain boundaries reaching throughout the entire sample as well as model calculations.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000399383100008	28265624

The influence of the loading content, adsorption temperature, and desulfurization way on the sulfidation properties of sorbents was investigated. N-2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. techniques were used to characterize the structure of sorbents before and after desulfurization. The results reveal that the microwave sulfidation performs best at 600 degrees C, while a further increase of the temperature leads to a lower sulfur capacity and utilization rate Of Fe2O3 as a result of the pore structure deteriorating sorbents. The Boltzmann function is suitable for describing the H2S evolution behavior of the Fe2O3/AC sorbent bed. Several advantages of microwave sulficlation over the conventional way are as follows: much better performance of Fe2O3/AC sorbents, less decline in surface area and pore volume per unit sulfur capacity when removing H2S at 400, 500, and 600 degrees C, and more S2- and oxygen vacancy species on the surface, of used desulfurizers. In comparison to conventional desulfurization, there is no notable decrease in the apparent activation energy of the overall sulfidation reaction by the microwave way. The enhanceinent of the desulfurization rate may be due to quicker ion diffusions and/Or better mass transfer under microwave conditions.									15	0	0	0	3	0	15			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000400039800098

In this work, we deposited ZrO2 films on Si (100) substrates by atomic layer deposition at 300 degrees C from (MeCp)(2)ZrMe(OMe) as Zr precursor and using, H2O or O-3 as oxygen source. After deposition films were subjected to rapid thermal annealing at 800 degrees C for 60 s in N-2. Film thickness is calculated from X-ray reflectivity to be in the 5-60 nm range. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction reveals that the film crystallographic phase is highly influenced by the oxidizing agent used during the deposition process. While the use of H2O gives films consisting of mixed phases, the monoclinic phase is almost absent in films deposited employing O-3, which stabilize in the ZrO2 cubic/tetragonal phases. Upon annealing, the films retain their crystallographic structure, despite a marginal increment of the monoclinic phase. Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry depth profiles evidence film uniformity and thermal stability. The evolution of electrical properties of ZrO2 films is discussed as a function of oxygen precursor and thermal treatment. The measured dielectric constant values after 800 degrees C annealing are kappa similar to 24 and kappa similar to 30 in the films deposited using H2O or O-3 respectively, in agreement with the different crystallographic phases in the ZrO2 films.

This paper comprehensively investigates the thermal transformation behavior and the release of gaseous pollutants (VOCs, NOx, and S-containing gas) of petrochemical oily sludge. The results show that Petroleum hydrocarbons composed of C6-C35 can be effectively removed in the temperature range of 241-607 degrees C. It is worth noting that since low boiling point components such as benzene and toluene in the oily sludge may volatilize rapidly near the initial combustion temperature and generate toxic and harmful gases. For example, in this study, the toluene vapor signal could be observed before the initial combustion temperature and the toluene vapor signal appeared neatly around 350 degrees C and did not participate in the combustion reaction and the strong fluctuation of benzene vapor. Organic sulfur dominated by Sulfonate-S, Sulfoxide-S, and Aromatic-S could be released in the form of SO2 around 250 degrees C and 450 degrees C, while organic nitrogen dominated by Pyridinic-N, Protein-N, and Pyrrolic-N could be released in the form of NOx between 300 degrees C and 500 degrees C, which is mainly related to the thermal stability of sulfur-containing groups.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000874815400004

However, the development of low-cost electrocatalysts and the fundamental mechanistic understanding of the selective NO-RR still remain challenging. Herein, self-supporting hierarchical nanosheets consisting of high-density Co9S8/Ni3S2 heterojunctions on Ni foam (Co9S8/Ni3S2-NF) are constructed via an in situ self-template strategy. With combined advantages of high-loading, high surface exposure, efficient conductivity and unique electronic structure of the Co9S8/Ni3S2 interface, the as-prepared Co9S8/Ni3S2-NF exhibits efficient electrocatalytic NO-RR performance, including up to 99.0% conversion and 96.0% selectivity towards aniline, and outstanding functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that electron transfer from Ni3S2 to Co9S8 is beneficial for the co-adsorption of H2O and nitrobenzene molecules at the interfacial sites, promoting the formation of active hydrogen and subsequent reduction of nitrobenzene. Additionally, the interfacial charge transfer breaks the symmetry of two active Co sites at the Co9S8/Ni3S2 interface, which markedly reduces the energy barrier for reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline. This work offers a successful example for the interfacial engineering of metal sulfide-based heterojunctions with excellent electrocatalytic nitroarene reduction performance, and also paves the way for the in-depth understanding of the corresponding mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000860865500001	36320394

Despite various approaches that have been developed to prepare ZIF-derived HCAs, the hollowing mechanism has not been clearly disclosed. Herein, a specialized overview of the recent progress of ZIF-derived HCAs is introduced to provide an insight into their preparation strategy and the corresponding hollowing mechanisms. Based on the fundamental understanding of the structural evolution of ZIF nanocrystals during the high-temperature pyrolysis process, the hollowing mechanisms of ZIF-derived HCAs are classified into four categories: i) inward contraction of core-shell template@ZIF composites or hollow ZIFs, ii) outward contraction of ZIF@shell composites, iii) special outward contraction of ZIF arrays, and iv) mechanism beyond inward/outward contraction of pure ZIF nanocrystals. Finally, an outlook on the development prospects and challenges of HCAs based on ZIF precursors, especially in terms of controlled synthesis and future electrochemical application, is further discussed.									30	2	0	0	4	0	29			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000598981100001	33326182

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy suggested the corrosion resistance of the scratch region increases with the length of exposure to the salt spray, with Raman spectroscopy indicating that this was due to the formation of zinc corrosion products over the exposed steel substrate. The experimental results revealed that the center of the scratch is under sacrificial protection, but the oxygen reduction reaction is inhibited on the steel surface at the scratch corners. Nevertheless, the steel at the corners of the scratch is under barrier protection for up to 168 h, due to the formation of a thin, but dense, layer of zinc corrosion products, as evidenced by the lack of iron corrosion products up to this time. Overall, the results suggest that mechanism is not simply a pure sacrificial protection followed by a pure barrier protection, but rather both mechanisms could occur at the same time, where sacrificial protection dominates in the scratch center and barrier protection dominates at the scratch corners until iron corrosion products appear, which is the point that the paint is unable to protect the scratch region fully.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0010-9312	1938-159X		WOS:000474438600006

A photosensitizer is a great determinant of the PDT outcome. Nowadays significant efforts have been focused on developing a new photosensitizer. In the current study, we present a novel water-soluble formulation of the chlorin derivative S-Porphin sodium (S-PS), based on several chemical reactions from a natural substance, chlorophyll-a. H-1 NMR, HPLC and spectrophotometry demonstrated the high purity and structural features of S-PS. The synthetic process did not disturb the characteristic absorption of chlorins at similar to 650 nm. In vitro, under laser irradiation in saline buffer, S-PS produced much higher singlet oxygen than the commonly used protoporphyrin, hematoporphyrin, hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether and chlorin e6, and only slightly lower than the clinically approved hydrophobic sensitizer HPPH. Cellular analysis suggests S-PS accumulated in the mitochondria of breast cancer cells and triggered cell apoptosis. The in vivo pharmacokinetics indicate that S-PS metabolized quickly and accumulated in tumors a few hours post administration. S-PS mediated PDT suppressed tumor growth and prolonged tumor bearing mice survival time as the PDT dose increased, which showed significant tumor inhibition and better systemic safety compared with HPPH-PDT under the same conditions. These findings indicate that S-PS could be a potential sensitizer in future clinical PDT and other activated cancer therapy methods.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2052-4129			WOS:000457450300010

The surface flatness of the ZnO films on the Al2O3 substrates increases with an increase in substrate temperature, and the opposite for that of the ZnO films on the GaN templates. This is ascribed to the fact that the GaN templates have a rougher surface than the Al2O3 substrates, which facilitates 3-dimensional growth on the GaN templates and 2-dimensional growth on the Al2O3 substrates. The structural qualities increase with increasing substrate temperature and film thickness, irrespective of the substrate. These are ascribed to the facts that a higher substrate temperature supplies the sufficient chemical reaction energy, necessary for the formation of ZnO lattices, and a longer growth time enlarges the bulky region with a relatively small amount of defects, not influenced by the heterointerface. On the other hand, the ZnO films on GaN templates have 5 times smaller X-ray diffraction linewidth and 50 times larger photoluminescence intensity than those on the Al2O3 substrates. These are ascribed to the fact that the "ZnO on GaN" structure has a very small lattice mismatch of 1.8%, while the "ZnO on Al2O3" structure has a large lattice mismatch of 18%.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000397855000069

In this work, different types of SPE membranes and catalysts were investigated to prepare high performance MEAs via a catalyst sprayed membrane under irradiation (CSMUI) method. The water electrolysis performance and properties of the prepared MEAs were evaluated and analyzed by polarization curve, electrochemistry impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that SPE type must be chosen carefully according to the specific water electrolysis system, and Pt/C catalyst with low Pt content is less suitable as cathode catalyst in water electrolysis. At a cell temperature of 80 degrees C and atmosphere pressure, the best performance was obtained by using 60 wt.% Pt/C and Nafion 212 membrane: the cell voltage can be as low as 1.526 V at 1 A cm(-2) and the terminal voltage is only 1.63 V at 2 A cm(-2), and the performance had no obvious degradation after a primary 24 h stability test. SEM characterization revealed that the intimate contact between the catalyst layers (CLs) and the membranes, and the uniformly porous CL structure correlate positively with the MEAs prepared by CSMUI method, exhibiting high performances and good stabilities for SPE water electrolysis.									21	1	0	0	0	0	22			1452-3981			WOS:000305267000031

Due to the decomposition of SEI, two CO2 evolution peaks at around 330 and 430 degrees C were detected in TG-MS studies with continuous CO2 background. The continuous CO2 background was attributed to the gradual decomposition of oxygen-containing polymeric species of SEI. Another two dominant components of SEI, lithium alkyl carbonate and lithium oxalate, were found to contribute to the CO2 peaks at 330 and 430 degrees C separately. The effects of charging-depth, current density and cycle number on the CO2 distribution and XPS spectra were studied. It was found that lithium oxalate was reduction product of lithium alkyl carbonate during the intercalation of lithium ions. The reduction reaction could be accelerated by elevated temperature. The transformation of SEI chemical structure showed direct effect on the thermal stability of SEI. At the same time, lithium carbonate was also found in SEI on the graphite electrode after long cycles, while it was negligible in the electrode subjected to short cycles. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Sakakibara, M; Isono, Y								Middle Miocene thermal metamorphism due to the infiltration of high-temperature fluid in the Sanbagawa metamorphic belt, southwest Japan								CONTRIBUTIONS TO MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY				125	4			341	358		10.1007/s004100050227				NOV 1996	1996	The Middle Miocene Tobe hornfels in the Sanbagawa metamorphic belt, western Shikoku, southwest Japan, is characterized by an abnormally steep metamorphic gradient compared with other hornfelses associated with intrusive bodies. The basic hornfels, originally Sanbagawa greenschist rocks, is divided into the following three metamorphic zones: plagioclase, hornblende, and orthopyroxene. The plagioclase zone is defined by the appearance of calcic plagioclase, the hornblende zone by the assemblage of hornblende+calcic plagioclase+quartz, and the orthopyroxene zone is characterized by the assemblage of orthopyroxene + clinopyroxene + plagioclase + quartz. Calcic amphibole compositions change from actinolite to hornblende as a result of the continuous reactions during prograde metamorphism. Petrographical and thermometric studies indicate a metamorphic temperature range of 300-475 degrees C for the plagioclase zone, 475-680 degrees C for the hornblende zone, and 680-730 degrees C for the orthopyroxene zone. The temperature gradient based on petrological studies is approximately 5 degrees C/m, which is unusually high. Geological and petrological studies demonstrate that the hornfelses were formed by the focusing of high-temperature fluids through zones of relatively high fracture permeability. The steep thermal gradient in the Tobe hornfels body is consistent with a large fluid flux, greater than 8.3 X 10(-7) m(3) m(-2)S(-1), over the relatively short duration of metamorphism, approximately 100 years.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0010-7999			WOS:A1996VX05700006

Prussian blue (PB) (Fe3+4 [Fe2+(CN)6]3) and its PB analogous (PBA) (A2T[M(CN)6], A=Li, K, Na; T=Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, etc.; M=Fe, Mn, Co, etc.) are metal organic frameworks that have numerous appliances and have garnered major attention in recent years. However, there are only handful of reviews discussing the fundamental catalytic properties of PB-based materials and hence this effort to comprehensively review and systematically discuss the critical role of PB-based materials in broader catalytic context embracing environment and the energy aspects.

MOF hybrid materials are derived from existing MOFs hybridized with other materials or small molecules using a variety of techniques. This led to superior performance of the new materials by combining the advantages of MOF components and others. In this review, we discuss several hybridization methods for the preparation of various MOF hybrids with representative examples from the literature. These methods include covalent modifications, noncovalent modifications, and using MOFs as templates or precursors. We also review the applications of the MOF hybrids in the fields of catalysis, drug delivery, gas storage and separation, energy storage, sensing, and others.									35	0	0	0	4	0	35			2073-4352			WOS:000443248900022

In this work, near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) is applied for in situ monitoring of the surface state of membrane electrode assemblies with RuO2 and bimetallic Ir0.7RuO0.3O2 anodes during water splitting. We demonstrate that Ir protects Ru from the formation of an unstable hydrous Ru(IV) oxide thereby rendering bimetallic Ru-Ir oxide electrodes with higher corrosion resistance. We further show that the water splitting occurs through a surface Ru(VIII) intermediate, and, contrary to common opinion, the presence of Ir does not hinder its formation.									50	3	0	0	2	0	51			1948-7185			WOS:000381781800028	27477824

In this work, Ag1-3xBixNb1-3/5xScxO3 (x = 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02) ceramics were synthesized via a solid state reaction method in flowing oxygen. The microstructure, dielectric and energy storage properties of as-prepared samples were systematic characterized to evaluate the potential as high energy storage capacitors. A high recoverable energy storage density (3.65 J/cm(3)) and high efficiency (84.31%) were simultaneously obtained in a modified AgNbO3-based ceramic at 21.5 MV/m. The energy storage performance is improved by the ions doping that effectively interrupt the dipoles arrangement structure and stabilize the disordered antiferroelectric phase in the long-range order. Co-doping of Bi3+ on the A site and Sc3+ on the B-site in AgNbO3 is an effective method to enhance the electric field intensity of field-induced phase transitions from antiferroelectric (AFE) to ferroelectric (FE) phases. The M1-M2 phase transition shifted to a lower temperature with an increase in the Bi/Sc amounts, which suppressed the ferroelectricity and obtained pinched-hysteresis loops in modified AgNbO3 ceramics. These results indicate that Bi/Sc co-doped AgNbO3 ceramics are highly efficient lead-free antiferroelectric materials for prospective application in high-performance energy storage capacitors.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000795100400006

The effect of Nd-doping amount on the electrocatalytic oxidation activity and stability of the electrode was examined. The surfaces of the prepared electrodes were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and energy spectrometer. The electrochemical performance of the electrodes was measured by cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results showed that the Ti/Sb/SnO2-Nd layer doped with 1% Nd on electrode had better crystallinity. For this electrode, the voltampere charge increased to 8.93 mC/cm(2), which was about twice that of Ti/Sb/SnO2 electrode. The oxygen evolution potential was increased from 2.07 V without Nd-doping to 2.30 V, and the service life was extended from 1000 h without Nd-doping to 1332 h, which was extended by more than 30%. The acid red 18 (AR 18) degradation efficiency of the Ti/Sb/SnO2-Nd electrode doped with 1% Nd after 1 h of electrolysis was 95.14%, which was 20.51% higher than that of the Ti/Sb/SnO2 electrode. The Ti/Sb/SnO2-Nd electrode doped with 1% Nd had high electrocatalytic oxidation activity and good stability.									9	0	0	0	1	1	9			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000670361400008

In this study, the capacitance of synthesized Co-7(PO4)(2)(HPO4)(4) after ultrasonic treatment with N-methyl-pyrrolidinone (NMP) improved 20.1 % (345 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)), the overpotential for OER reduced 20 mV (293 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). Based on detailed characterization analysis, ultrasonic treatment with NMP does not destroy the phases and the surface phosphate groups of the materials, but reduce the overall particle size, improve the pore volume and create some new interfaces originally located inside the material. These changes bring increased active sites, reduced internal resistance, enhanced charge transfer capability and improved intrinsic activity to the synthesized Co7(PO4)(2)(HPO4)(4), enhancing its OER and capacitance efficiency. Additionally, the ultrasonic treatment can achieve those changes, which is most likely achieved by sacrificing some mesopores with small diameters, it also provides a simple and convenient method for enhancing the performance of other three-dimensional mesoporous materials.

Co3O4 electrode was prepared by electrodeposition of Co(OH)(2) on graphite paper followed with a calcination step. The electro-oxidation of C3 saturated alcohols were investigated by a combination of cyclic voltammetry, multi-step chronoamperometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques in KOH solution. The electro-oxidation studies at Co3O4 electrode followed an activity trend in the following order: propanetriol (GLY) > 1,2-propanediol (1,2-P) > 1,3-propanediol (1,3-P) > 1-propanol (1P) > 2-propanol (2-P). The NMR analysis of the oxidized products showed that C-C bond cleavage occurred faster in alcohols having adjacent hydroxyl groups. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy study showed that there was no significant difference in Co oxidation state in the absence and the presence of glycerol. It was also found that the KOH concentration influenced electro-oxidation of those alcohols bearing secondary hydroxyl group (GLY, 1,2-P, and 2-P) more dramatically than that of those primary alcohols (1.3-P and 1-P).

The spraying technique is characterized by high velocity particles which impact and deposit on a surface at relatively low temperature. Compared to established wet-chemical techniques, an increased photoelectrochemical activity is observed due to an enhanced particle-to-substrate bonding. For closer investigation of the influence of the process parameters on the photoelectrochemical activity, TiO2 electrodes (P25-20 by Evonik Industries) sprayed with different carrier gases (nitrogen, argon, helium) are analyzed. Due to different acceleration conditions of the particles in the de Laval nozzle, these carrier gases allow to investigate the influence of the impact energy of the particles on the binding mechanism and thus the resulting photocurrent density in the OER. Photoelectrochemical activities, structural properties as well as the electrode structure are correlated in order to discuss the history of the semiconductor and its photoelectrochemical properties evoked in the CGS process. Surface photovoltage measurements are considered to analyze the charge carrier dynamics in the porous TiO2 film. For the gas carrier nitrogen, beneficial conditions for the particle-to-particle and particle-to-substrate coupling are provided due to the sufficient temperature and velocity of the particles.

The current density-potential curves (j - E) showed that the oxide grows according to the physical model for high-field conduction. However, for final potential (E-f) higher than 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl (sat. KCI) the oxygen evolution reaction becomes more significant, and the formation of bubbles prevented or made more difficult the application of in situ techniques for the simultaneous study of the thickness and optical properties of the anodic layer. We developed a method based on electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) to calculate oxide thickness using ex situ ellipsometry as a reference technique. The normalized intensity of the 0 K alpha peaks was measured for anodic oxides corresponding to Ef values from spontaneous oxide up to 50V, where a linear relationship was observed for a narrower range of final potentials. This behaviour was studied with Monte Carlo simulations. After calibration with ellipsometric results, to take into account sample damage during the electron irradiation, EPMA was applied as a method for thickness determination at E-f >= 1.0 V. Once the method was established, ex situ thickness determinations became independent of the preparation method of the oxide layer, which represents a comparative advantage against ex situ ellipsometry.

The PyTA-BC and PyTA-BC-Ph COFs exhibit ultrahigh thermal stabilities (up to 421 degrees C), excellent crystallinity, and high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas (up to 1445 m(2)g(-1)). These COFs display strong fluorescence emissions in various solvents, with their emission maxima gradually red-shifting upon increasing the polarity of the solvent (solvatochromism). Upon exposure to HCl, they respond very rapidly and sensitively in terms of changing their colors and fluorescence emission maxima. In the presence of a sacrificial electron donor, these COFs mediate the highly efficient photocatalytic evolution of H(2)from water. In the absence of a noble metal cocatalyst, the COFs and ascorbic acid provide a photocatalytic H(2)production of up to 1183 mu mol g(-1)h(-1)(lambda >= 420 nm); this value is the highest reported to date for a COF. Such COFs appear to be potentially useful as chemosensors for the naked-eye and sensitive spectroscopic detection of HCl and as cocatalysts for the sustainable photocatalytic production of H(2)from water.									75	0	0	0	3	0	75			2195-1071			WOS:000574641100028

These catalysts were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), X-ray diffraction (XRD), raman spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) tests were carried out to determine the electro-oxidation properties. The np-Pd/CuO/160TiO(2) shows superior activities for the oxidation of small organic molecules and the corresponding current densities are 2.86 mA cm(-2), 7.05 mA cm(-2) and 9.93 mA cm(-2) for the electro-oxidation of methanol, ethanol and formic acid, respectively. A probable bifunctional mechanism was suggested as: TiO2 nanoparticles would act as a supplementary material, and oxygen-containing groups generated on the TiO2 surface could promote oxidation of the toxic intermediates. In addition, the catalytic stability of catalysts was investigated by typical electrochemical methods. The np-Pd/CuO/160TiO(2) catalyst also exhibited good long-term stability.

Local structure analysis and structure mining for design of photocatalytic metal oxychloride intergrowths								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A											10.1039/d2ta05663a		OCT 2022			2022	In this work, the local structures of durable, high-activity Bi4TaO8Cl-Bi2GdO4Cl intergrowth photocatalysts that were prepared in a molten flux are determined by pair distribution function analysis of X-ray total scattering data and correlated to their photocatalytic performance. This system gives understanding to how the local structure of photocatalysts can be manipulated controllably through incorporation of rigid and flexible layers via intergrowth formation to achieve high activity. This analysis revealed that the local symmetry and distortion of the [TaO6] octahedra introduced through intergrowth formation and dictated by intergrowth stoichiometry correlate with their photocatalytic activity. That is, the greater the Ta-O-Ta bond angles, the higher the photocatalytic activity of a given intergrowth for the oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, greater tilting of the [TaO6] octahedra is associated with a larger band gap. This analysis was coupled with a structure mining approach to model the intergrowth structure by building supercells for refinement of the X-ray diffraction data. This analysis found that Ta- and Gd-domains are separated within the intergrowths, with large Gd-domains separated by small Ta-domains at high Gd% and the opposite for high Ta%. Taken together with Williamson-Hall analysis, our results highlight that the local structure of layered materials can be modulated through strain engineering enabled by the selection of rigid and flexible intergrowth layers, providing a new design pathway to high performance photocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000870363000001

In this study, the structural evolution of PPS during thermal degradation in nitrogen (N-2) and oxygen (O-2) atmospheres are investigated systematically via X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and dynamic rheology. A rheological measurement is proposed to distinguish the multi-stage degradation behaviors of PPS efficiently. It is found that the thermal degradation mechanism of PPS differs considerably in N-2 and O-2 atmospheres. Chain scission is predominant when PPS is heated in N-2, while C-S and C-C crosslinking structures can only be initiated at extremely high temperature. On the contrary, oxidation of PPS is accelerated seriously in the presence of O-2. Chain extension and branching reactions are activated even at low processing temperature of PPS, and substantial C-O-C crosslinking structures are created which leads to the sharp increase of melt viscosity. Furthermore, the change of crystallization behaviors after thermal treatments of PPS are also studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM). The crystalline kinetics of PPS changes significantly during melt processing, which further corroborates the thermal degradation mechanism of PPS. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

To lower the required potentials, an effective strategy is proposed to substitute OER with partial oxidation of degradation products of carbohydrate origin from the waste stream of a chemical pulping industry. In this work, two different catalytic materials - PdNi and NiO are investigated comparatively to understand their catalytic performance for the oxidation of carbohydrate alkaline degradation products (CHADs). PdNi can catalyze CHADs with low potential requirements (-0.11 V vs. Hg/HgO at 150 mA cm(-2)) but is limited to current densities <200 mA cm(-2). In contrast, NiO can operate at very high current densities but required relatively higher potentials (0.53 V vs. Hg/HgO at 500 mA cm(-2)). The performance of this non-noble metal catalyst compares favorably with that of Pd-based catalysts for hydrogen production from CHADs at high conversion rates. This work shows the potential to utilize waste streams from a large-scale process industry for sustainable hydrogen production, and also opens up opportunities to study earth-abundant electrocatalysts to efficiently oxidize biomass-derived substances.

Metal oxides are widely explored as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water oxidation. However, their application is limited by the disparity between the picosecond-nanosecond lifetimes of electrons and holes photoexcited in bulk metal oxides versus the millisecond-second timescale of water oxidation catalysis. This Review addresses the charge-carrier dynamics underlying the performance of metal oxide photoanodes and their ability to drive photoelectrochemical water oxidation, alongside comparison with metal oxide function in photocatalytic and electrocatalytic systems. We assess the dominant kinetic processes determining photoanode performance, namely, charge generation, polaron formation and charge trapping, bulk and surface recombination, charge separation and extraction, and, finally, the kinetics of water oxidation catalysis. We examine approaches to enhance performance, including material selection, doping, nanostructuring, junction formation and/or co-catalyst deposition. Crucially, we examine how such performance enhancements can be understood from analyses of carrier dynamics and propose design guidelines for further material or device optimization.Metal oxides are widely used in photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic systems for fuel synthesis and environmental remediation. In this Review, we examine the kinetic challenges, from charge generation to water oxidation catalysis, that determine the performance of metal oxide photo(electro)catalysts.									38	0	0	0	3	0	37			2058-8437			WOS:000684757000001

Of them, confinement strategy holds great potential because it can create unique microenvironment for electrocatalysts. Thanks to the exceptional physical and chemical properties, the two-dimensional materials (2D materials) as building block are powerful in constructing inimitable "confined space" which will endow electrocatalysts with many intriguing characteristics, such as admirable electron conductivity, enhanced stability and anti-poisoning capability, and more accessible active sites as well. Despite numerous efforts have been devoted and some progress has been made in confinement research, there exist substantial challenges to be tackled with regard to respectable activity, stability, and mass production of the confined electrocatalysts. In this Minireview, the concept of "nanoparticles confined in two-dimensional materials (denoted as NCTDM)" and their up-to-date synthetical strategies, including host-guest assembly method and in-situ formation method have been firstly discussed. In addition, with special emphasis on their application, the NCTDM as a new type of high-performance electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy-conversion technologies such as water splitting, fuel cells and electrochemical reduction of CO2 to C-1 molecules have been systematically introduced.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000652652200001

The exploration of low-cost, efficient, and durable electrocatalysts is of great significance for realizing a large-scale application and forming a sustainable chemistry. Recently single-atom catalysts (SACs), with isolated metal atoms anchored on supports, exhibit distinctive performances for electrocatalytic water splitting. Single-atom catalysis is emerging as a new frontier for bridging the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyses. Therefore, the synthesis of SACs with excellent durability is highly desirable but challenging. Here, recent progress of SACs in supports and synthetic strategies, characterization techniques, and the electrochemical application toward water splitting is summarized. Fully understanding the interactions between the single-atom metal and the support is extremely important for the design and preparation of highly stable SACs as well as the improvement of electrocatalytic activity, which are particularly discussed in this context. Finally, the current challenges and future opportunities for the development of this field are discussed.									68	6	0	0	1	0	68			2366-9608			WOS:000485927700018

One method of fabrication that is receiving much attention lately is the utilization of the coherent Stranski-Krastanov mode which leads to self-assembly of small-scale islands, driven by the lattice mismatch between the quantum dot material and the underlying substrate material [1-5]. W e quantitatively investigate initial stages of growth and evolution of GaSb islands on GaAs substrates grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). We pay particular attention to the transition from 2D to 3D growth and to the transition between isolated island growth and the coalescence of islands in an effort to improve our understanding of this regime. The extent of oxidation and growth derived oxygen contamination for GaSb quantum dots grown by metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) were also investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a system with high energy resolution.					2010 International Conference on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology2010 International Conference on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology	22-26 Feb. 201022-26 Feb. 2010		Sydney, NSW, AustraliaSydney, NSW, Australia	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-1-4244-5261-3	INSPEC:12306508

As far as the mechanism of the first oxidation reaction is concerned, evidence for the formation of supramolecular donor-acceptor complexes with the bipyridinium units at the semiconductor surface was obtained by comparison of the Langmuir-adsorption characteristics and the efficiencies of photodegradation of the different substrates. Furthermore, the main intermediates of the photocatalytic degradation of 2,4-xylidine were identified, and the presence of 2,4-dimethylphenol indicates that the main pathway of substrate oxidation proceeds via electron transfer from the adsorbed organic substrate to the "holes" within the valence band of the photoexcited semiconductors V2+-TiO2 and TiO2. The efficiencies of photocatalytic degradation by both V2+-TiO2 and TiO2 were limited by the trapping efficiency of the conduction band electrons by molecular oxygen.									13	2	0	0	4	0	15			0937-0633			WOS:000172508600007	11767888

Accounting for optical depth effects, the LMC data from the massive star-forming region N113 infer an N-14/N-15 ratio of 111 +/- 17, which is about twice the C-12/C-13 value. For the LMC star-forming region N159HW and for the central region of NGC 4945, N-14/N-15 ratios are also approximate to 100. The N-14/N-15 ratios are smaller than all interstellar nitrogen isotope ratios measured in the disk and center of the Milky Way, strongly supporting the idea that N-15 is synthesized by massive stars. Although this appears to be in contradiction with standard stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis calculations, it supports recent findings of abundant N-15 production due to rotationally induced mixing of protons into the helium-burning shells of massive stars.									54	0	0	0	0	0	54			0004-637X			WOS:000079809200016

This synthetic strategy facilitates the formation of MoS2 QDs with an enhanced band gap and a proper heterojunction between them and TiO2, which accelerates charge transfer process. Hydrogenation leads to oxygen vacancies in TiO2, enhancing the visible light absorption capacity through narrowing its band gap, and sulfur vacancies in MoS2, which enhance the active sites for hydrogen adsorption. Due to the band gap reduction of hydrogenated TiO2 and the band gap enhancement of the MoS2 QDs, the energy states are rearranged to create a reverse movement of electrons and holes facilitated the charge transfer process which enhance life-time of photo-generated charges. The photocatalyst showed stable, efficient and exceptionally high noble metal free sunlight-induced hydrogen production with a maximum rate of 3.1 mmol g(-1) h(-1). The developed synthetic strategy also provides flexibility towards the shape of the MoS2, e.g. QDs/single or few layers, on TiO2 and offers the opportunity to design novel visible light active photocatalysts for different applications.									46	1	0	0	3	0	47			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000414960900057	29083007

In darkness, the loss of oxygen-evolving photosystem II activity in the presence of 0.5 hi NaCl or 0.5 M LiCl was much more rapid in desA(-)/desD(-) cells than in wild-type cells. Oxygen-evolving activity that had been lost during incubation with 0.5 M NaCl in darkness returned when cells were transferred to conditions that allowed photosynthesis or respiration. Recovery was much greater in wild-type than in desA(-)/desD(-) cells, and it was prevented by lincomycin, Thus, the unsaturation of fatty acids is important in the tolerance of the photosynthetic machinery to salt stress. It appears also that the activity and synthesis of the Na+/H+ antiporter system might be suppressed under high-salt conditions and that this effect can be reversed, in part, by the unsaturation of fatty acids in membrane lipids.									156	11	4	0	142	0	168			0027-8424			WOS:000080246500097	10318975

Upon discharge, insulating solid Li2O2 forms on cathode surfaces, which is usually governed by two growth models, namely the solution model and the surface model. These Li2O2 growth models can largely determine the battery performances such as the discharge capacity, round-trip efficiency and cycling stability. Understanding the Li2O2 formation mechanism and controlling its growth are essential to fully realize the technological potential of Li-O-2 batteries. In this review, we overview the recent advances in understanding the electrochemical and chemical processes that occur during the Li2O2 formation. In the beginning, the oxygen reduction mechanisms, the identification of O-2-/LiO2 intermediates, and their influence on the Li2O2 morphology have been discussed. The effects of the discharge current density and potential on the Li2O2 growth model have been subsequently reviewed. Special focus is then given to the prominent strategies, including the electrolyte-mediated strategy and the cathode-catalyst-tailoring strategy, for controlling the Li2O2 growth pathways. Finally, we conclude by discussing the profound implications of controlling Li2O2 formation for further development in Li-O-2 batteries.									224	14	0	0	9	0	228			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000412141600015	28857099

Here, we propose a facile approach for the large-scale generation of uniform PdCuTe nanowires (NWs) by using Te NWs as the template. Impressively, as a robust integrated one-dimensional (1D) anode catalyst, the as-obtained PdCuTe NWs shows high specific/mass activity of 7.9 mA cm(-2) and 3872.6 mA mg(-1) for the ethylene glycol (EG) oxidation reaction, being 3.4 and 4.2-fold enhancement than commercial Pd/C, respectively. Moreover, the ternary PdCuTe nanowires also display excellent stability with less activity degradation after long-term electrochemical tests. Combining physicochemical characterizations and electrochemical results, we found that the 1D Te NWs template was significant for promoting the electrocatalytic activity of PdCuTe NWs, because such nanowire template was the key, leading to the attachment of active PdCu nanoparticles which successfully exposed abundant active sites and contributed to large promotion of electrocatalytic performances. This work highlights the utilization efficiency improvement via morphology design for the promotion of electrocatalytic performances. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The mf-BVO exhibits columnar grains with an uncommon (121) texture with high-index facets such as (112), (020), (132), and (204). The texture and high-index facets facilitate rapid surface melting and grain fusion during thermal annealing, thus leading to crystal reconstructed micron-sized BVO grains (cr-BVO). The cr-BVO has a photocurrent density approximate to 50 times larger than that of mf-BVO. The reason is identified as the significantly improved charge transport efficiency resulting from the dopant activation (increased carrier concentration) and bulky grains (fewer defects). Additionally, the cr-BVO exhibits improved photocorrosion resistance compared to the nanoparticle-based BVO. After coating the oxygen evolution catalyst, the photocurrent density of cr-BVO is further increased to 4.4 mA cm(-2) for water oxidation reaction at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, maintaining a high and stable faradaic efficiency of over 88% for 24 h. These results demonstrate that crystal reconstruction is a facile and effective pathway to improve the charge transport efficiency, opening a new avenue for developing efficient photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000854303000001

In this work, we propose the chemical etching, successive carbonization, and phosphorization treatment strategy of solid ZIF-67 (ZIF = zeolitic imidazole framework), constructing a hybrid nanostructure with CoP nanoparticles embedded in a hollow N-doped carbon nanocage (h-CoP@NC). The elaborate hollow porous structure is conducive to effectively exposing more active sites and shortening mass-transportation pathways. The nitrogen-doped carbon layer would protect the active CoP units from agglomeration and enhance the conductivity. These structural factors synergistically contribute to the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. As a result, the carbonization-temperature-optimized h-CoP@NC-900-300 catalyst can efficiently catalyze both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions with respective overpotentials of 196 and 339 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming other contrast catalysts. Impressively, to comprise this optimal electrocatalyst into both an anode and cathode of the alkaline electrolyzer, a cell voltage of 1.764 V is needed for achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with continuously operational ability. This present study would shed light on the exploration of advanced transition-metal-based electrocatalysts by composition and structure design for energy conversion applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2574-0970		WOS:000752919200062		
J	Wang, Kaiyan; Wang, Min; Yu, Jingchao; Liao, Dan; Shi, Haiyang; Wang, Xuefei; Yu, Huogen								BiVO4 Microparticles Decorated with Cu@Au Core-Shell Nanostructures for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production								ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS				4	12			13158	13166		10.1021/acsanm.1c02688				DEC 24 2021	2021	The nanostructured Au cocatalyst modification of BiVO4 photocatalyst, as a prospective method, can significantly promote its photocatalytic H2O2 production performance. However, the contact between Au and BiVO4 causes a strong built-in field, which impedes the photogenerated-electron transfer and the accumulation of negative charge density for Au, which reduces its catalytic activity of two-electron O-2 reduction, thus limiting the enhanced H2O2 production performance of the Au/BiVO4 photocatalyst. To solve the above problems, here, a CupAu core-shell nanostructured cocatalyst is designed to selectively modify on the electron-enriched (010) facet of a single-crystal BiVO4 microparticle by facile photodeposition and subsequently galvanic displacement. In this case, ohmic contact between the Cu nanoparticle and (010) facet of BiVO4 can effectively transfer the photogenerated electrons to the Au cocatalyst and simultaneously facilitate the catalytic activity improvement of two-electron O-2 reduction for the Au cocatalyst due to its low negative charge accumulation. As a result, the optimized BiVO4 photocatalyst with CupAu core-shell nanostructured modification exhibits obviously improved photocatalytic performance of H2O2 formation (91.1 mu mol L-1) compared with Au/BiVO 4 (62.5 mu mol L-1). The present strategy of a bimetal cocatalyst with a core-shell nanostructure opens up an insight to explore effective photocatalytic materials for the application of H2O2 production.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7				2574-0970		WOS:000752919200034

The solution of the mass, momentum and energy conservation equations are simultaneously implemented with fully coupling electromagnetic field based on the finite volume method. The volume of fluid (VOF) model is used to capture the interface between slag and metal implicitly. Furthermore, the adaptive mesh refinement is adopted to improve the computational accuracy and efficiency. The model is firstly validated and then applied to industrial scale ESR process. Moreover, the simulation results illustrate that a two-stage process of the droplet formation occurs during the ESR process: the primary droplet formation and the satellite droplet formation. The primary droplet is formed by the gravity stretch, the pinch-off effect of the Lorentz force and surface tension. The formation process of the satellite droplet can be divided into two types: the tip pinch-off of the ligament controlled by the surface tension and the bifurcation of the ligament controlled by the Lorentz force. In addition, the effect of the metal-slag interface tension on the droplet formation is analyzed.

Ni-doped hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) nanorods were obtained by calcination of Ni-doped goethite nanorods at 400 degrees C. The Ni2+-for-Fe3+ substitution in goethite and hematite was confirmed by determination of the unit cell expansion (due to the difference in the ionic radii of Fe3+ and Ni2+) using XRPD and determination of the reduction of a hyperfine magnetic field (due to the difference in magnetic moments of Fe2+ and Ni2+) using Mossbauer spectroscopy. Single-phase goethite nanorods were found in samples containing 0 or 5 mol % Ni. A higher Ni content in the precipitation system (10 mol % or more) resulted in a higher Ni2+-for-Fe2+ substitution in goethite, and larger Ni-doped goethite nanorods, though with the presence of low crystalline Ni-containing ferrihydrite and Ni ferrite (NiFe2O4) as additional phases. Significant changes in FT-IR and UV-Vis-NIR spectra of prepared samples were observed with increasing Ni content. Electrochemical measurements of samples showed a strong increase in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity with increasing Ni content.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0011-1643	1334-417X		WOS:000456043500011		
J	Wang, Zhongxu; Yu, Zhigang; Zhao, Jingxiang				Zhao, Jing/GXV-4738-2022; zhao, jing/B-3868-2019				Computational screening of a single transition metal atom supported on the C2N monolayer for electrochemical ammonia synthesis								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				20	18			12835	12844		10.1039/c8cp01215f				MAY 14 2018	2018	The nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions using renewable energy is a green and sustainable strategy for the synthesis of NH3, which is one of the most important chemicals and carbon-free carriers. Thus, the search for low-cost, highly efficient, and stable NRR electrocatalysts is critical to achieve this goal. Herein, using comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations, we design a new class of NRR electrocatalysts based on a single transition metal (TM) atom supported on the experimentally feasible two-dimensional C2N monolayer (TM@C2N). Based on the computed free energies of each elementary pathway, Mo@C2N is predicted to exhibit the best catalytic activity among the TM@C2N, in which the proton-coupled electron transfer of the NH2* species to NH3(g) is the potential-determining step. Especially, the computed onset potential of the NRR on Mo@C2N is -0.17 V, which is even lower than that for the well-established stepped Ru(0001) surface (-0.43 V). Furthermore, the NRR catalytic performance of these TM@C2N can be well explained by their adsorption strength with N2H* species. Our findings open a new avenue for optimizing the TM catalytic performance for the NRR with the lowest number of metal atoms on porous low-dimensional materials.									111	4	0	0	3	0	110			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000431825300052	29700534

Several approaches have been developed to fabricate ferrites of different sizes and shapes but most of these methods suffer from several disadvantages, such as the difficulty to produce the ferrite in a thin layer form or on top of another (pre-prepared) structure as a second layer. Moreover, the formation process requires calcination at high temperatures, and the electrode fabrication requires an additional assembly method. Herein, a CdFe2O4 ferrite was formed via chemical vapor deposition of a single-source precursor directly on a hematite structure followed by an annealing process. This thermal treatment simultaneously achieves both activation of the hematite and the formation of CdFe2O4. Three different iron oxide (rectangular, nanobelt, and mesoporous) structures were examined as photoanode electrodes. The maximum current at 1.65 V vs. RHE of the mesoporous film was more than two times higher than the rectangular and the nanobelt films. Therefore, iron oxide with mesoporous structures was used to form the hybrid structure of alpha-Fe2O3-CdFe2O4. The hybrid structure presents stable and high photocurrent density (about 20 % enhancement in the measured maximum current density at 1.65 V vs. RHE).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-2148	1869-5868		WOS:000583298800001		
J	MAZZITELLI, I; DANTONA, F; CALOI, V								GLOBULAR-CLUSTER AGES WITH UPDATED INPUT PHYSICS								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				302	2			382	400						OCT 1995	1995	We present the results of new stellar evolution computations in the heavy element and helium abundance ranges appropriate to describe the evolutionary status of galactic globular cluster stars, for main sequence, turn-off, subgiant and horizontal branch phases. We also present and discuss a few red giant tracks.The main rationales of these computations are:1. Availability of new opacities both for stellar interiors (Rogers & Iglesias 1992, 1994; OPAL) and for low temperature external layers (Kurucz 1991; Alexander & Ferguson 1994), whose influence on stellar structures has not yet been widely tested.2. Test on Population II stars of the recent Canuto & Mazzitelli (1991, 1992; CM) model for overadiabatic convection.3. Availability of Kurucz' colour-T-eff transformations (1993), a homogeneous set based on Kurucz' atmospheric models, covering the whole range of Populations I and II chemical abundances, and a large fraction of the HR diagram.Results are given for five sets of chemical abundances (Y=0.23, Z=0.0001; Y=0.23, Z=0.0003; Y=0.235, Z=0.001; Y=0.235, Z=0.002; Y=0.24, Z=0.004) and two treatments of external convection: according to the standard mixing length theory (MLT), and according to Canuto and Mazzitelli. Calibration of MLT is made following the general rule of adopting the ratio of the mixing length to the pressure scale height (alpha = l/H-p) which fits the solar model (and is consistent with subdwarfs location). Also the CM models have been tuned in a marginal way, as will be discussed in the following.New theoretical HB loci are more luminous at low metallicity, in agreement with recent observations of RR Lyrae and their magnitude-metallicity relations. Adopting the derived distance moduli, the turn-off location is consistent with the observed loci, without requiring arbitrary adjustments of the main sequence colour, which was often necessary in previous comparisons appeared in the astronomical literature.The resulting ages for globular clusters (GCs) are younger than previously found: MLT isochrones plus horizontal branch fitting give ages of similar to 14 Gyr for the most metal poor GCs. With the CM treatment, the isochrones turn out redder and, on the average, the observed turn-off (TO) colours are matched by CM isochrones still younger by similar to 2 Cyr, also thanks to the peculiar topology of the CM tracks around the TO which, due to the extreme thinness of the convective envelope, leads to an ''apparent decrease'' in the TO luminosity.On the whole, then, these new models provide younger GCs, and smaller spread in age between metal poor and metal rich GCs (ages 12 divided by 14 Gyr).									62	0	0	0	0	0	62			0004-6361			WOS:A1995TB18700010

The hollow spherical structure of NiCo2S4 gives ZnxCd1-xS more contact positions to form a stable heterojunction. Through the band structure adjustment for ZnxCd1-xS the induced electron transfer model was transformed into Z-scheme, which effectively enhances the photo-produced carrier separation efficiency of the composite material. At the same time, the fast electron transfer is realized by the great conductivity of the hollow spherical NiCo2S4 This allows the composite material to obtain a shorter average lifetime of PL (0.15 ns) compared to Zn0.5Cd0.5S (3.9 ns). The composite NiCo2S4@Zn0.5Cd0.5S with Z-scheme heterojunction exhibited excellent photocatalytic HER activity and stability due to its unique spatial structure and efficient Z-scheme electron transfer path. The optimized composite NiCo2S4@Zn0.5Cd0.5S 1:1 photocatalytic HER rate reached 233.68 mu mol.h(-1), which is equivalent to 5.81 times that of Zn0.5Cd0.5S (40.25 mu mol.h(-1)).									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000576738500002

Herein, we report a versatile heating rate-controlled synthetic route to prepare MnCo2O4 microspheres with multiple interiors. Comparative study reveals that MnCo2O4 microspheres with core-shell structure (MCO-CSS) process the highest specific surface area (91.6 m(2) g(-1)) and oxygen vacancy density (0.16), which can provide more electroactive sites for surface Faradic reaction and further facilitate the kinetics of rapid charge storage. While the porous shell and well-defined gap endow MCO-CSS with excellent permeability and low-resistance pathways for electrolyte ions, as well as enhanced volume change accommodation. Benefiting from the structural advantages, MCO-CSS displays an excellent specific capacitance of 1064.4F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), remarkable rate capability, and satisfactory cycle stability (89.1% capacitance retention at 2 A g(-1) over 1000 cycles). Additionally, an asymmetric supercapacitor device, with an MCO-CSS cathode and porous carbon spheres anode, delivers a remarkable energy density of 33.9 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 187.4 W kg(-1), as well as 84.13% capacitance retention over 3000 cycles at 1 A g(-1).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000861040200002

During the re-entry phase on earth, one of the most important phenomena occurring on the heat shield is the recombination of atomic oxygen and this phenomenon is more or less catalyzed by the material of the heat shield. PM 1000 is planned to be use on the EXPERT capsule to study in real conditions its catalycity. Before the flight, it is necessary to perform measurements on ground test facility. Experimental data of the recombination coefficient of atomic oxygen under air plasma flow were obtained in the diffusion reactor MESOX on pre-oxidized PM 1000, for two total pressures 300 and 1000 Pa in the temperature range (850-1650 K) using actinometry and optical emission spectroscopy. In this investigation, the evolution of the recombination coefficient is dependent of temperature, pressure level and also of the chemical composition of the surface leading to one order of magnitude for a given temperature. The recombination coefficient is increasing with temperature and also dependent on the static pressure. The surface change due to the plasma exposure is inspected with SEM, XRD and XPS. As chromium oxide is the main part of the oxide layer formed during the oxidation in air plasma conditions, a sintered Cr2O3 sample was elaborated from powders to compare the data of the recombination coefficient obtained on PM 1000. Pre- and post-test analyses on the several materials were carried out using SEM, WDS, XRD and XPS. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

To evaluate the effect of HHP on wine phenolic composition, a red wine treated with HHP was compared with different conventional wine aging processes, such as the use of wood and microoxygenation. The wine was pressurized at 500 MPa for 5 min at 20 degrees C and the same wine was also stored in oak barrels and treated with oak chips with or without microoxygenation. For comparison of the HHP effect, all wines were stored in polyethylene bottles. After 5 months, the monomeric anthocyanins, phenolic acids, and flavonols content of pressurized wines were lower in comparison with the other wine treatments. Nevertheless, pressurized wines showed a similar degree of tannin polymerization, pyranoanthocyanins content, and percentage of prodelphinidins in relation to the wine treated with microoxygenation and oak chips. HHP, possible by promoting a higher diffusion of oxygen into the wine, has the potential to be a novel oenological practice, producing red wines with a polymeric phenolic composition similar to those treated with wood aging processes.									13	0	0	0	3	0	13			0963-9969	1873-7145		WOS:000458942900024	30716940

The model accounts for two-dimensional (2D) across-the-channel anisotropic mass and charge transport in the anode and cathode Gas Diffusion Layers (GDLs), including the effect of GDL assembly compression and electrical contact resistances at the Bipolar Plate (BPP) and membrane interfaces. A one-dimensional (1D) across-the-membrane model is used to describe local species diffusion through the microporous layers, methanol/water crossover, proton transport, and electrochemical reactions, thereby coupling both GDL sub-models. The 2D/1D model is extended to the third dimension and supplemented with 1D descriptions of the flow channels to yield a 3D/1D + 1D model that is successfully validated. A parametric study is then conducted on the 2D/1D model to examine the effect of operating conditions on cell performance. The results show that an optimum methanol concentration exists that maximizes power output due to the trade-off between anode polarization and cathode mixed overpotential. For fixed methanol concentration, cell performance is largely affected by the oxygen supply rate, cell temperature, and liquid gas saturation levels. There is also an optimal GDL compression due to the trade-off between ohmic and concentration losses, which strongly depends on BPP material and, more weakly, on the actual operating conditions.

The optical absorption onset of the CuFe2O4/CdSe heterostructures was red-shifted to 2.30-2.48 eV, compared to that of the bare CuFe2O4 (2.55 eV), leading to better utilization of visible light. Furthermore, the CuFe2O4/CdSe samples exhibited a higher specific surface area than the bare CuFe2O4, due to the introduction of CdSe nanospheres. Compared to the bare CuFe2O4, the CuFe2O4/CdSe heterostructure promoted H-2 production from water splitting. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of the CuFe2O4/CdSe catalyst was attributed to the more efficient charge separation and lower charge transfer resistance, confirmed by fluorescence decay measurements and Nyquist plots, respectively. The band alignment between CuFe2O4 and CdSe resulted in an interfacial p-n junction, which directed the electron transfer from CdSe to CuFe2O4 and the hole transfer from CuFe2O4 to CdSe, achieving improved spatial separation of charge carriers.

The thin PEEK film was irradiated by the 2 MeV O+ ions up to the fluence 6 x 10(14) ions/cm(2). The depth profiles of the free radicals in the ion-modified PEEK were traced by the Li+ ions incorporated to a damaged area of PEEK by exposing the sample to a 5 mol water solution of LiCl. The depth distributions of the free radicals in the inspected PEEK specimens were found fractioned (for higher fluences) into two distinct parts that followed both electronic and nuclear transfer energy distributions (predicted by the TRIM code). The Li decoration - TNDP was also applied for the study of the free radical depth profile evolution induced by the thermal processing of the samples in vacuum. The evolution was studied in a broad range of temperatures from RT to the melting point of the polymer. The thermal annealing led to a process of gradual redistribution and annihilation of the free radicals. This process was dramatically enhanced, especially at elevated temperatures around and above the glass transition point of PEEK. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, most of the plasmonic systems are restricted on the noble metals and semiconductors, which limited the cost efficiency of the photocatalysts and further investigations of metal plasmons coupling with other research filed. Herein, we presented nonprecious Al@BaTiO3 (Al/BTO) plasmonic heterostructures on Ti foams for a synergistic piezo-photocatalytic water splitting and pollutant degradation. An impressive local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and solar energy harvesting ability (in the ultraviolet-visible light region) are achieved on the Al/BTO photoelectrode, which endow the heterostructure with an excellent solar H-2 evolution (327 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2)) and 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) degradation rate. Furthermore, the BTO substrates upon magnetic field induced mechanical stimuli provide a strong polarization potential to the plasmonic catalyst by significantly enhancing the photo-generated carrier separation and transfer. The synergistic piezo-photocatalysis exhibited almost 50% increase in the H-2 production (657 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2)) and decolourization of 4-NP, which is comparable to a traditional noble metallic plasmonic photoelectrode. The hybrid catalyst delivers a long-term durability in the cycling tests, maintaining similar to 90% of the activity after 30 h. This work demonstrates that non-noble metallic plasmons and piezoelectronic effect can serve synchronously as highly active photocatalytic agents, which not only boost the solar energy conversion efficiency but also decrease the material cost.									78	3	0	0	4	0	80			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000474636100057

However, the mass production of hydrogen is still technically difficult due to limitations in efficiency, stability, and cost, even though it can satisfy all of the current energy demands. Water splitting using an electrocatalyst is an efficient method for environmentally friendly hydrogen production, and various catalyst-related studies are being conducted for this purpose. For the last decade, transition metal-based compositions have been at the center of water splitting catalyst research. Despite numerous studies and developments, studies on transition metal-based catalysts so far still have various problems to be solved. Although excellent review papers on transition metal-based catalysts have been reported, the overall scope of transition metal-based catalysts has rarely been covered in the reports. In this review, we present the research about overall transition metal-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen production from four different categories, namely, alloys, transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), layered double hydroxides (LDHs), and single-atom catalysts (SACs). The fundamental roles of metal alloying and unique electrical properties of TMDs, LDHs, and SACs are mainly discussed.

In this study, we present enhanced photocatalytic and photo-electrochemical activities over the particulate LaNbON2 during visible-light-driven water oxidation. La-rich oxide mixtures, prepared by the calcination of La2O3-Nb2O5 with La/Nb ratios greater than 1.00, were proposed as a starting precursor for the synthesis of less-defective LaNbON2. The La-rich condition caused the synthesis of smaller LaNbON2 particles with larger BET surface areas, which were favorable for the complete nitridation under mild conditions. The LaNbON2 particles prepared from the La/Nb ratio of 1.20, which were capable of absorbing a wide range of visible light up to approximately 750 nm and above, completed the nitridation at 1123 K for 15 h. The La-rich condition promoted reduced bulk defect density of LaNbON2 and suppressed the formation of Nb3+ species at the oxynitride surface during nitridation. These differences led to water oxidation photocurrent over the particulate LaNbON2 photoanode under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight, which has never previously been reported. Therefore, the synthesis strategy using La-rich oxide was effective at preparing less-defective LaNbON2, thus improving the photoactivity.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2574-0962			WOS:000644737800019

Experimental and theoretical efforts were combined herein to elucidate the structural-property relationship of CuMnO2 nanoparticles from different morphologies. The microwave-assisted hydrothermal method was employed to synthesize these crystals with different morphologies, while first-principle quantum mechanical calculations were performed at the DFT level to obtain the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of CuMnO2 surfaces. Our structural results have confirmed a monoclinic structure for crednerite-type CuMnO(2 )nanoparticles described by the Jahn-Teller-distorted octahedral [MnO6] clusters, which are connected by linear 2-fold [CuO2]. FE-SEM images combined with Wulff construction analyses indicated that CuMnO 2 nanoparticles adopt a hexagonal nanoplate-like morphology which can enclose a major extent of the (100) surface with contributions from (101), (110), and (111) surfaces. Electronic structure and magnetic characterizations were discussed by the role of the corresponding electronic states of exposed surfaces which control the energy-level band diagram and spin density distribution. These results extend our fundamental understanding of the atomic processes which underpin the morphological modulations of the CuMnO2 material, thus creating a new path to obtain selected nanoparticles with desirable properties which optimize their applications.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000518703000048

However, the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in mBiVO(4) have impeded the improvement of its photocatalytic performance and stability. Therefore, important issues are increasingly focused on fine-tuning the physicochemical properties of mBiVO(4) at the atomic level based on facet-engineered surface and interface design to optimize its selectivity and activity. Herein, the review begins with the fundamental aspects of mBiVO(4) semiconductor, including crystal structure, optical properties, electronic structure, and photocatalytic principles. Then the synthetic methods based on surface and interface design that develop to tailor the facet of mBiVO(4), along with the discussion of the mechanisms for facet-dependent photocatalytic performance, are presented. Most importantly, the latest advances in facet engineering that have been performed to regulate the surface of single mBiVO(4) and to design the interface structures that are directly involved in the photocatalytic reaction for mBiVO(4)-based composites are encompassed. Moreover, the photocatalytic application achievements with mBiVO(4) as photocatalysts in energy conversion and environmental remediation are also summarized. Finally, perspectives on the existing challenges and future research directions for this emerging frontier are discussed.									63	5	0	0	6	0	65			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700010		
J	Peng Wei-Guo; Song Han-Feng; Zhan Qiong; Wu Xing-Hua; Jing Jiang-Hong								Formation and internal nucleosynthesis in massive rotating Wolf-Rayet stars								ACTA PHYSICA SINICA				68	21					219701	10.7498/aps.68.20191040				NOV 5 2019	2019	Wolf-Rayet stars (WR stars) were discovered by French astronomers Charles Wolf and Georges Rayet in 1867. The Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are the evolved descents of the most massive, extremely hot (temperatures up to 200000 K) and very luminous (10(5) L-circle dot - 10(6) L-circle dot) O stars, with 25M(circle dot) - 30M(circle dot) solar mass for solar metallicity. The WR stars possess very strong stellar winds, which have velocities up to 3000 km/s and wind mass loss rate 10(-5) M-circle dot a year. These winds are observed in the broad emission line profiles (sometimes, even P-Cygni profiles) of WR spectra in the optical and UV range. Actually, these winds are so strong that they can peel the star and convert it into a nude nucleus without envelope. It has been found that three bright galactic stars located at Cygnus region have broad strong emission bands, rather than absorptions lines, superposed on the typical continuum of hot stars. In 1930 Beals correctly identified these features as emission lines produced by high ionized elements such as helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. The physical factors which can affect the evolution of WR stars are explored in this paper. These physical factors include stellar mass, initial velocities, orbital periods, metallicities, etc. According to the equations for angular momentum transfer and chemical element diffusion, we can ascertain how these physical factors influence the evolution of WR stars and the mixing of chemical elements in WR stars. The result indicates that massive stars with high initial velocities and metallicities have strong stellar winds and be prone to producing WR stars. In contrast with the counterpart with high metallicities, it is hard for the single star with low metallicity to generate WR star due to weak wind. However, the star with very high initial velocity and low metallicity can form chemical homogenious evolution. The star has an enlarged convective core and a very thin hydrogen envelope and it can also generate WR star. The component in the binary system with short orbital period can transfer mass to the companion star through Roche lobe overflow, and this physical process can produce WR star under the condition of low metallicity. Furthermore, mass removal due to Roche lobe overflow reduces the temperature of stellar convective core and rate of nuclear reaction. It is shown that mass metallicities of chemical elements including He-4, C-12, F-19, Ne-22, Na-23, Mg-25 in the primary star are higher than those in the single stars, whereas mass metallicities of chemical elements including H-1, N-14, O-16, Ne-20, and Al-26 are lower than those in the single counterparts. In a word, the conditions for massive stars with high initial velocities and metallicities in the binary system with short orbital period favor the formation of WR stars.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-3290			WOS:000496172100035

Unlike typical thermal CVD conditions, a mixture of H-2 and Ar gas was used as the carrier gas, and a catalyst powder such as graphite was not used. The hydrogen gas maintained the reducing atmosphere and easily vaporized the SnO2 powder without a catalyst, to supply vapors of Sn and O. This process enables vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth of SnO2 NWs at temperatures below 600 degrees C. The formation of a eutectic AuSn alloy that acts as a liquid seed during the VLS process contributes to lowering the growth temperature. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy analysis show that SnO2 NWs and SnO NWs coexist in the as-prepared sample. The oxygen-deficient atmosphere results in nucleation and growth of SnO NWs.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000430522200136		
J	Yang, XM; Lentz, DR; Chi, GX; Kyser, TK				/AAD-1690-2020				Fluid-mineral reaction in the Lake George granodiorite, New Brunswick, Canada: Implications for Au-W-Mo-Sb mineralization								CANADIAN MINERALOGIST				42				1443	1464		10.2113/gscanmin.42.5.1443				OCT 2004	2004	The Early Devonian Lake George granodiorite stock, New Brunswick, Canada, is spatially and temporally associated with early W-Mo-Au and later Au-Sbmineralization. The former mine was the largest antimony producer in North America until the mid-1990;. On the basis of fluid-inclusion analyses, multiple generations of fluids evidently interacted with the granodiorite, with the dominant fluids approximated by the system H2O-NaCl-CO2-CH4. Additional components of the fluid, S-Ca-Fe-K-Mg-Mn, reflect fluid-rock reaction and partial re-equilibration among the rock-forming minerals (i.e., plagioclase, orthoclase, biotite, and hornblende) in the granodiorite. The CO2-bearing inclusions (Type 1) have a relatively low salinity, ranging from 0 to 15 wt.% equiv. NaCl (ave. 4 wt.%), and most homogenize to the CO2 phase at temperatures of 200 to 470degreesC. Inclusions that homogenize to the aqueous phase do so over a narrower range of temperatures (250-350degreesC). Fluid pressures were probably 740 to 2210 bars for Type-1 inclusions. Aqueous liquid + vapor (Type 2) and aqueous liquid + vapor + halite or sylvite (Type 3) inclusions are recorded as well. Type-2 inclusions show a broader range of temperatures of homogenization (mostly to the aqueous phase), from 150 to 580 C, with a salinity between 2 and 19 wt.% equiv. NaCl. The stable isotope compositions of the rock-forming minerals in the granodiorite exhibit a disequilibrium relationship, e.g., either delta(18)O(K-feldspar) > delta(18)O(quartz). delta(18)O(plagioclase) > delta(18)O(quartz), or delta(18)O(plagioclase) > delta(18)O(K-feldspar). The whole-rock delta(18)O values range from 9.4 to 10.7parts per thousand, consistent with derivation by contamination by I80-rich sources. Values of deltaD(biotite) range from-75 to-64parts per thousand. The bulk fluids entrapped in quartz phenocrysts have deltaD values of -40.2 +/- 5.5parts per thousand, consistent with those of the fluids in equilibrium with biotite at temperatures between 350 and 480 degreesC. The similarities among the fluid compositions in the granodiorite, Au-W-Mo quartz-carbonate veinlets and stockworks, and the large Sb veins, suggest that they are genetically related. These fluids are interpreted to be mainly derived from progressive exsolution of volatiles from the cooling magmas at depth, although the CO2-CH4-bearing fluids were derived from the intrusion by wall-rock hybridization and skarn-forming reactions and later interaction with groundwater. These CO2-CH4-bearing fluids may have reacted with the granodioritic magma to lower its redox conditions, as reflected by a low magnetic susceptibility (ave. 6 X 10(-5) SI). Together with the petrochemical features, fluid composition and T-P characteristics in the Lake George granodiorite and associated W-Mo-Au-Sb deposit share many similarities with other reduced I-type granitic-intrusion-related gold systems.					8th Biennial Meeting of the Pan-American Conference on Research on Fluid Inclusions8th Biennial Meeting of the Pan-American Conference on Research on Fluid Inclusions	JUL 07-11, 2002JUL 07-11, 2002	Mineralog Assoc Canada; St Francis Xavier Univ; Nova Scotia Dept Natl Resources; Petroleum Res Atlantic CanadaMineralog Assoc Canada; St Francis Xavier Univ; Nova Scotia Dept Natl Resources; Petroleum Res Atlantic Canada	Halifax, CANADAHalifax, CANADA	19	1	0	0	1	0	20			0008-4476	1499-1276		WOS:000225553500011

Here, the formation of two titanium carbide-based core-shell nanostructures with an ultrathin layer of cobalt oxide were studied as alternative to carbon black. Titanium carbide was selected due to its electrical conductivity and high corrosion resistance. Two different nanostructures on TiC supports were prepared with Pt either on or below a cobalt oxide layer. For the sub-oxide Pt catalyst, the oxide could be removed selectively where it covered the Pt to make it partially exposed and catalytically available, yet sufficient Pt was anchored to the remaining oxide to provide stability. This anchoring prevented Pt nanoparticle detachment and aggregation as determined by similar to 100% catalytic activity remained at 0.1 M KOH, and similar to 92% catalytic activity remained at 0.1 M HClO4 after 16.7 h, room temperature. A core-shell model has computationally been investigated to confirm the function of the cobalt shell as diffusion barrier to protect carbide from oxidation.

J	Wu, Jiaojiao; Li, Nan; Fang, Hua-Bin; Li, Xitao; Zheng, Yan-Zhen; Tao, Xia								Nitrogen vacancies modified graphitic carbon nitride: Scalable and one-step fabrication with efficient visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				358				20	29		10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.208				FEB 15 2019	2019	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with nitrogen vacancies (CN-x) was fabricated by a straightforward one-step N2H4 center dot H2O-assisted thermal polymerization method, avoiding high-energy consumption and complex posttreatment. 100-fold precursor amplification experiment proved that such a simple one-step method could achieve scalable synthesis. Experiment results show that nitrogen vacancies, introduced into CN-x architecture by removing N atoms in the C-containing triazine rings (C=N-C) (N-2C ) sites, cause bandgap narrowing and generate downward-shifted midgap states under the conduction band (CB) edge, which consequently extend the visible-light absorption and inhibit recombination of electrons and holes. As a result, under optimal amount of N2H4 center dot H2O added, CN-75 shows a highest H-2 evolution rate of 8171.4 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1) and 3895.1 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1) under lambda > 420 nm and lambda > 470 nm visible-light irradiation, respectively, far higher than that of pristine g-C3N4 (481.6 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1), lambda > 420 nm and 148.6 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1), lambda > 470 nm). Moreover, stability assays show that the as-prepared CN-75 possesses satisfactory light and structure stability after ten cycling runs (4 h per cycling). This work offers a simple and effective route for fabricating high-performance nitrogen vacancies modified g-C3N4 photocatalyst on a large scale.									67	4	0	0	11	0	67			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000450105700003

Herein, some non-noble metal active states, Ti3+/Ov (oxygen vacancies) and surface amorphization structure, are introduced into anatase TiO2 nanoparticles by ball milling them with TiH2 to prepare black TiO2. And then, an organic/inorganic hybrid (BE-black TiO2) containing a conjugated polymer (BE, a modified poly-benzothiadiazole flake) and black TiO2 is fabricated and investigated for photocatalytic H-2 production without noble metal co-catalyst. Compare to BETiO2 catalyst, the BE-black TiO2 exhibit a similar to 30% enhancement for H-2 production activity under visible light (lambda > 420 nm) irradiation. Combining the structural characterizations, comparison of H-2 production rate and electron transfer behavior analysis, it is found that these active states play key role in the enhancement of photoactivity through narrowing the band-gap of TiO2, accelerating photoelectrons transfer from BE to TiO2, acting as electron traps and reaction sites for H-2 production.									17	2	0	0	1	0	17			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000449683100033

ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				374	1			195	203		10.1051/0004-6361:20010688				JUL 2001	2001	Several evolutionary sequences with low-mass secondaries (M-d = 1.25, 1.5 and 1.7 M.) and black hole accretors (M-bh = 5 and 10 M.) are calculated. The angular momentum losses due to magnetic braking and gravitational wave radiation are included. Using full nuclear networks (p-p and CNO cycles) we follow carefully the evolution of the surface composition of the secondary star. We find that the surface chemical composition of the secondary star may give additional information which helps to understand the formation of soft X-ray transients with black holes as accretors. We show that observations of isotope ratios C-12/C-13, N-14/N-15 and O-16/O-17 with comparison to computed sequences allow estimates independent of spectroscopy of the mass of the secondary component. We find that our evolutionary calculations satisfactorily explain the observed q = M-sg/M-bh - P-orb distribution for Soft X-ray transients with orbital periods less than one day. Using our evolutionary calculations we estimate secondary masses and surface chemical abundances (C, N, O) for different systems. We distinguished three different phases in the SXT's evolution. The optical component shows (i) cosmic C, N, O abundances and C-12/C-13 isotopic ratio; (ii) cosmic C, N, O abundances but modified C-12/C-13 ratio; and (iii) depletion of C and enhanced of N abundances and strongly modified isotopic ratios of C, N, O.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1432-0746			WOS:000169984400021

A five-bands model was adopted for Raman spectrum curve fitting. As parameters involving most information about carbon structure, variation of FWHM of D1 band and D3 relative intensity were analyzed. It was found that original PM presented higher graphical structural order and lower chemical heterogeneity with the increase in the diesel load. After the treatment of NTP, the graphical structural order and chemical heterogeneity of PM kept at a relative stable level, affected very slightly by diesel load. Meanwhile, the amount of molecular carbon in PM increased. Further study for relation between structural evolution and chemical reactivity of PM with chemical kinetics would make Raman spectroscopy of great promise to become an important method for PM characterization, which could provide basis for more effective removal.									2	5	0	0	0	0	7			1000-0593			WOS:000307127000028	23156771

The timing and origin of these water-rock interactions as well as the paleofluids in which relevant chemical reactions occurred were deduced using data from microscopy, fluid-inclusion micro-thermometry, oxygen-isotope microanalysis, and trace-element microanalysis.Three distinct, separate episodes of quartz overgrowths (referred to as Q1, Q2, and Q3) were distinguished by cathodoluminescence microscopy. The Q1 quartz, identified in all porous sandstones from 2500 to 3600 m (8200 to 11,800 ft), was formed at approximately 100 degrees C-115 degrees C (212 degrees F-239 degrees F) before oil filled the reservoirs. The Q2 quartz was mainly precipitated at 115 degrees C-130 degrees C (239 degrees F-275 degrees F), accompanying or slightly postdating the main phase of oil filling, and was identified in samples from 2800 to 3600 m (9200 to 11,800 ft). The Q3 quartz was only identified in sandstones buried deeper than 3500 m (11,400 ft) and was likely precipitated in the Quaternary when temperature exceeded 130 degrees C-135 degrees C (266 degrees F-275 degrees F). Secondary ion mass spectrometry oxygen-isotope microanalyses yielded delta O-18(VSMOW) (Vienna standard mean ocean water) values ranging from 21.42% to 24.35% for Q1 quartz, from 22.03% to 24.99% for Q2 quartz, and from 21.72% to 22.91% for Q3 quartz.A mass-balance calculation and quantitative petrography data of the amount of leached feldspars and associated secondary minerals suggest that the internal feldspar dissolution is likely the primary source for the authigenic clays and quartz cements in these sandstones. Positive delta O-18((water)) values (+0.5% to +4.5% VSMOW) of quartz-forming waters indicate that quartz cementation and feldspar dissolution occurred in a geochemical system with a limited volume of diagenetically modified connate water. The variations of delta O-18((cements)) and trace-element compositions from Q1 quartz to Q2 quartz in individual overgrowth suggest that hydrocarbon filling changed the chemistry of the pore fluid significantly; further, delta O-18((water)) values of the pore water increased by approximately 2% VSMOW after oil filling.Meteoric freshwater did not contribute to quartz cementation and simultaneous feldspar dissolution. The detected CO2 and hydrocarbons in fluid inclusions in the quartz cements, the existence of CO2 in hydrocarbon-rich natural gas, and the pyrobitumen in the feldspar-hosted pores suggest that acids derived from organic matter (kerogen in source rocks and hydrocarbons in reservoirs) probably have promoted the extensive subsurface leaching reactions of feldspars in these sandstones. The ongoing development of Q2 and Q3 quartz suggests that quartz precipitation did not cease after oil filling. Further, diagenetic reactions likely have proceeded from water-rock interactions to hydrocarbon-water-rock interactions.									19	4	0	0	0	0	22			0149-1423	1558-9153		WOS:000445703700002		
J	Guo, Weifu								Kinetic clumped isotope fractionation in the DIC-H2O-CO2 system: Patterns, controls, and implications								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				268				230	257		10.1016/j.gca.2019.07.055				JAN 1 2020	2020	The carbonate clumped isotope thermometer is a powerful tool in paleoclimate research, because it constrains carbonate formation temperature based on the extent of C-13 and O-18 clumping within the carbonate lattice (Delta(47)) and thus does not require knowledge of the isotopic composition of the water from which carbonates precipitate. However, there is growing evidence that kinetic processes in the precipitating solution, particularly the slow inter-conversion between CO2 and HCO3, can cause deviations of the clumped isotope composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from their expected equilibrium values, leading to disequilibrium clumped isotope composition in the carbonate precipitates. Such disequilibrium effects impede the application of the carbonate clumped isotope thermometer to important climate archives (e.g., speleothems and corals), and hinder the realization of the full potential of this novel thermometer. Here, I systematically examine the patterns and controls of kinetic clumped isotope fractionations (i.e., Delta(47), Delta(48) and Delta(49)) in the DIC-H2O-CO2 system through first-principles theoretical calculations and numerical modeling (IsoDIC), and explore their implications for the carbonate clumped isotope thermometry.I show that, in contrast to the large carbon and oxygen isotope effects, intrinsic clumped isotope fractionations associated with CO2 hydration and hydroxylation and their reverse reactions (i.e., HCO3- dehydration and dehydroxylation) will lead to only relatively small disequilibrium Delta(47) effects in the HCO3- that are directly produced or consumed by these reactions. Instead, the disequilibrium Delta(47) effects observed in most natural and laboratory-synthesized carbonates arise in large part from the mixing or removal of DIC pools with similar Delta(47) compositions but distinct bulk carbon and oxygen isotope compositions. Further, my model simulations show characteristic evolutions of the clumped isotope composition of DIC during three common isotope fractionation processes, i.e., DIC-H2O isotope exchange, CO2 degassing, and CO2 absorption, and predict correlated enrichments in delta C-13, delta O-18 and Delta(48) but depletions in Delta(47) and Delta(49) of DIC during the early stage of CO2 degassing and vice versa during CO2 absorption, yielding typical disequilibrium Delta(47)/delta O-18, Delta(48)/delta O-18 and Delta(47)/Delta(48) slopes of about -0.03, 0.03, and -1.0 for CO2 degassing and about -0.02, 0.04, and -0.6 for CO2 absorption. While both the physicochemical condition (e.g., T, pH, [DIC], pCO(2)) and the isotopic composition (e.g., delta C-13, delta O-18, Delta(47), Delta(48), Delta(49)) of the aqueous solution and air CO2 can affect the magnitudes of these disequilibrium isotope effects, the correlations among these disequilibrium effects are relatively insensitive to changes in most environmental parameters except the isotopic composition of the aqueous solution and air CO2. The quantitative agreements between my model results and the existing observations from laboratory experiments and natural carbonates suggest that the model captures the key processes governing clumped isotope fractionations in the DIC-H2O-CO2-CaCO3 system, and support the development of novel approaches, e.g., coupled Delta(47)-Delta(48) measurements, to discern the kinetic processes involved in carbonate formation and to correct for disequilibrium clumped isotope effects in carbonate archives and derive accurate estimates of their formation temperatures.

Herein, cobalt-nickel selenide (CoNi2Se4) nanostructures were fabricated on a Ni foam substrate using a facile potentiostatic method at different deposition solution pH levels. Nanoparticle-, fluffy-, and flake-like CoNi2Se4 nanostructures were deposited by changing the aqueous solution pH to 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0, respectively. The desired flake-like CoNi2Se4 electrode fabricated at pH 3.0 presented the best electrocatalytic performance of all CoNi2Se4 nanostructures in this study and required overpotentials as low as 244 and 184 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Furthermore, the electrodes presented long-term stability over 20 h at current densities of 10 and -10 mA cm(-2). Besides, this bifunctional flake-like CoNi2Se4 electrocatalyst delivered outstanding overall water splitting performance and required an external potential of 1.63 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

Morphology analysis of the composites showed that rod-like BVO structures were partially deposited on flake-ball (FB) BWO particles. In addition, surface structures of BWO, BVO and BVO/BWO were studied in energy-resolved distribution of electron traps and conduction band-bottom (CBB) position by household reversed double-beam photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) and single-beam PAS, respectively. Apparent CBB of BVO/BWO was ca. 0.4 eV anodically shifted from BWO and almost similar to BVO. Moreover, photocatalytic oxygen liberation under irradiation of UV-vis and visible lights demonstrated that photocatalytic activities of the BVO/BWO composites were depended on f(V) and calcined BVO/BWO composites in which BVO was stabilized on BWO showed enhancement of photocatalytic activity comparing to a pristine BVO. The prolonged and the highest active photocatalyst under visible light was calcined 0.80 f(V) due to BVO stabilization on FB-BWO particles.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				2213-3437		WOS:000436927400050

Kinloch, Ian/AAI-3965-2021				Optimisation of electrolytic solvents for simultaneous electrochemical exfoliation and functionalisation of graphene with metal								CARBON				128				257	266		10.1016/j.carbon.2017.11.081				MAR 2018	2018	The development of a simple, simultaneous electrochemical exfoliation and functionalisation of graphene with metal nanostructures in a one-pot, single step process is reported. This approach is useful in terms of the reduction in processing time and cost, as well as aiding the control of the aggregation of graphene sheets. This first part of this work compares the efficiency of electrochemical graphite exfoliation in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and in a mixture of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and ethylene carbonate (EC) in an electrolyte consisting of LiClO4 and tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate. In the second part, the best performing electrolytic solvent was used for in-situ functionalisation of graphene sheets with gold or cobalt nanostructures. The formation of solid layer electrolyte interface in the DMC/EC system is believed to stabilise the graphite from premature exfoliation and allowed the ions to intercalate efficiently to produce a relatively high yield of monolayer graphene sheets. By contrast, the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite in the other two solvents (DMSO and NMP) produced lower yields of few layer graphene. In particular, the co-intercalation of DMSO fragments the electrode by its decomposition by-products (sulfur/carbon oxides) before sufficient cation intercalation occurs. The simulations electrochemical exfoliation and functionalisation of graphene at a single applied potential in the presence of Au salt in DMC/EC solution resulted in the functionalisation of graphene sheets with a variety of high surface area Au nanowhiskers, nanodendrites, nanowires and lamellar nanoparticles. Alternatively, the use of Co(II) salt in the exfoliation solution resulted in the co-deposition of uniformly grown Co nanoparticles on graphene sheets. The metal-functionalised graphene sheets showed high catalytic activity and stability when used as an electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reactions. This process could be extended to other metal salts, or mixtures of metal salts, to form graphene-metal alloy composites for use in various applications. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim was to study membrane dynamics of diffusion-controlled bimolecular reactions in two-dimensional fluids. Complete exclusion of molecular oxygen was achieved. Under this condition, the dynamics of excimer formation may be studied for probe concentrations as small as 0.5 mol%. At the same concentration, domain formation due to lateral phase separation may be visually observed. In the first part, the time evolution of the fluorescence of monomer and excimer in monolayers of L-alpha-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) is studied. A pyrene-labeled lecithin serves as an excimer-forming probe. Probe concentration and lateral packing density of the lipids are varied. A method is developed by which the fluorescence lifetime of the monomer and the lateral diffusion coefficients are obtained with high accuracy (lifetime better than 7.5%, diffusion coefficient better than 15%) from the decay of the monomer fluorescence. The method is based on the analysis of the excimer formation in terms of the Smoluchowski theory modified for two-dimensional fluids. It is shown that the time course of the excimer formation is determined by a strongly time dependent rate of association k(t). The strong time dependence is a consequence of the fact that there is no stationary solution of the diffusion equation in two-dimensional fluids. The time evolution of the excimer fluorescence is analyzed in a model of so-called ''pseudo-excitation''. In the application part the variation of lateral diffusivity with lipid packing density is studied. It is shown that it agrees only in the small packing density regime with the predictions of the free volume model. Over the whole range of packing densities investigated here, the viscosity of the monolayer shows an exponential dependence on density, as was predicted for ordinary fluids by Frenkel. Finally, the method is applied to mixtures of DMPC with cholesterol. A phase diagram for high cholesterol concentrations is established. It is shown that by careful analysis of excimer formation dynamics it is possible to detect local phase separation in cases where the classical methods (thermodynamical and fluorescence microscopy) fail. A remarkable influence of a few percent of pyrene-labeled phospholipids on the phase boundaries is established.									25	0	0	0	9	0	25			0022-3654			WOS:A1994NH49000034

The optimal photocatalyst (CZA8) degraded Rhodamine B (RhB), 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and Naproxen (NPX) about 100% within 20 min, 91.4% within 60 min and 88.9% within 30 min under Xe lamp illumination, respectively. Besides, the CZA8 possesses outstanding photo corrosion resistance capacity which has been verified with the cycle degradation experiments. The photocatalyst displays excellent light response and efficient separation of photo-induced carriers due to the fabrication of type-II heterojunction, the presence of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect and as well as the oxygen vacancy. The oxygen vacancy was systematically characterized by XPS, PL and Raman. Moreover, the photocatalytic degradation pathways are proposed based on the LC-MS results. Finally, a novel photocatalytic mechanism for photocatalytic oxidation of RhB, 4-NP and NPX is discussed and schematically illuminated. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

PCC6803 having a His(6) extension (His-tag) of the carboxyl terminus of the CP47 protein has been reported (T.M. Bricker et al, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1409 (1998) 50; M.J. Reifler et al., in: Garab, Pusztai (Eds.) Proc. XIth International Congress on Photosynthesis, 1998). While these initial reports suggest a minimal impact of the His-tag upon Photosystem (PS) II function, a more thorough analysis of the kinetic properties of the modified complex is essential. This communication reports on a more detailed kinetic analysis to assess possible perturbations of PS II due to the genetic addition of the His-tag on the CP47 protein. It was found that: (1) Patterns of flash O-2 yield exhibited normal period four oscillations and the associated fits of the Kok-Joliot S-state cycling parameters were virtually identical to the wild type; (2) O-2 release kinetics during the S-3-S-0 transition were experimentally indistinguishable from the wild type; (3) S-state decay measurements indicate slightly faster decays of the S-2 and S-3 states compared to the wild type; (4) fluorescence measurements indicate that the kinetics of the forward reaction of electron transfer from Q(A)(-) to Q(B) and back-reactions of Q(A)(-) With PS II electron donors are similar in the His-tag and wild-type strains. It is therefore concluded that the addition of the His-tag results in a minimal perturbation of PS II function. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, efficient photocatalytic splitting of water to realize carbon-free hydrogen production remains a challenge. Heterojunction photocatalysts with well-defined dimensionality and perfectly matched interfaces are promising for achieving highly efficient solar-to-hydrogen conversion. Herein, we report the fabrication of a novel type of protonated graphitic carbon nitride (PCN)/Ti(3)C(2)MXene heterojunctions with strong interfacial interactions. As expected, the two-dimensional (2D) PCN/2D Ti3C2 MXene interface heterojunction achieves a highly improved hydrogen evolution rate (2181 mu mol.g(-1)) in comparison with bulk g-C3N4 (393 mu mol.g(-1)) and protonated g-C3N4 (816 mu mol.g(-1)). The charge-regulated surfaces of PCN and the accelerated charge transport at the face-to-face 2D/2D Schottky heterojunction interface are the major contributors to the excellent hydrogen evolution performance of the composite photocatalyst.

Based on nanofilaments with non-volatile metal-like current flow characteristics in resistance-change memory devices, a strategically advanced conducting filament transport mechanism for vigorous and robust PEC operation is proposed. The breakdown-like electrochemical forming behavior effectively occurs with a rapid increase in current at approximate to 2 V (vs RHE). The fundamental properties of filaments, such as diameter, density, and conductivity, are controlled by varying the artificial compliance currents. This process does not require any top electrodes that obstruct light-harvesting and the injection of photo-charges into electrolytes or individual forming process with point-by-point sweeping, and provides electrochemical forming sites with homogeneous and dense distribution. Additionally, some photocorrosive sites that induce photocurrent degradation are passivated by the preferential photoelectrodeposition of co-catalysts. From the electrochemical filament forming process and selective Pt-photoelectrodeposition on filaments, the Cu2O/AZO/TiO2 photocathodes exhibit an unprecedented photocurrent density of approximate to 11.9 mA cm(-2) and open-circuit potential of 0.73 V and produce vigorous hydrogen and oxygen evolutions for over 100 h, even when the TiO2 passivation film exceeds 100 nm in thickness.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000695178900001

The Yb/Co coated spherical Ni(OH)(2) was prepared by co-precipitation of Co/Yb hydroxide on the surface of spherical Ni(OH)(2) from CoSO4, YbCl3 and NaOH solutions. The Ca-3(PO4)(2) and Co(OH)(2) coated Ni(OH)(2) were prepared by precipitation of Ca-3(PO4)(2) on the surface of spherical Ni(OH)(2), followed by precipitation of Co(OH)(2) on its surface. The capacity retentions of the sealed AA-sized Ni-MH using 2%Co/0.75%Yb hydroxide coated and 2%Ca/2%Co coated spherical Ni(OH)(2) reached 90% and 81%, respectively, at 60 degrees C, where the capacity retentions for un-coated and only Co(OH)(2) coated Ni(OH)(2) were only 46% and 48%, respectively. The cyclic voltammetry analysis showed that for the Ni(OH)(2), the oxidation potential, the oxygen evolution potential and the difference between them increased after the coating both at room temperature and high temperature, leading to an increase of the charging efficiency of Ni(OH)(2) and improvement of the electrochemical performance at high temperature.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			1002-185X			WOS:000244993600023

Toward this challenge, self-supported TiC@MoS2 (TCMS) ceramic membrane electrodes were fabricated by a self-template strategy. Porous TiC ceramic membranes with straight finger-like pores were first fabricated by phase inversion tape-casting and sintering. Then, a 1T-2H MoS2 nanosheet layer grew on the porous conductive TiC skeleton. The high conductivity of the TCMS skeleton promotes charge transfer, while the porous structure, which consists of abundant finger-like and cavernous pores, favors proton transfer and bubble transfer during the electrolysis process. The optimal TCMS composition displayed an overpotential of -127 mV at -10 mA.cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 41 mV.dec(-1), and an extremely high electrochemical active area of 1079.4 mF.cm(-2) as well as remarkable stability in 0.5 M H2SO4. A high Faradaic efficiency of 99.7% was also achieved. The superior electrocatalytic performance was ascribed to the synergistic effect of the tight bonding and the crystal matching between TiC and MoS2, the unique dual pore structure, the abundant exposed active sites of MoS2 nanoflakes, and the high 1T-MoS2 content. First-principles density functional calculations showed that the 1T-MoS2/TiC hybrid has the lowest free energy for H adsorption (0.116 eV) and the highest density of states near the Fermi level, which leads to a strong catalytic activity.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000685206200040

The spatio temporal evolution of charged particles and electric field along the discharge axis is analyzed in a 1.5D finite difference framework which consists of the solution of 1D continuity and 2D Poisson equations, respectively. A 0D kinetic model accounts for the evolution of N-2 neutral particles considering the principal triplet electronic states N-2(X-1 Sigma(+)(g)), N-2(A 3 Sigma(+)(u)), N-2(B (3)Pi(g)) and N-2(C (3)Pi(u)) as well as the singlet metastable state N-2(a' (1)Sigma(-)(u)). It is shown that the evolution of the discharge takes place in three distinct phases, each one characterized by different current waveforms. The discharge's efficiency on active species production is examined, revealing the dominant character of metastable species A (3)Sigma(+)(u) and a' (1)Sigma(-)(u). Comparison of the numerical model's results with experimental ones is performed in the framework of electrical and optical diagnostics.									23	5	0	0	0	0	24			0022-3727			WOS:000247930400012

The internal hydrogen bond, cyano and amino defects of g-C3N4 nanosheets can be partly repaired via refluxing in the different polarity of the organic solvent, which is attributed to the effect of hydrogen bond polarity, hydroxyl and carbon chain structure of organic solvent. Especially, refluxing in the solvent of isopropanol, g-C3N4 nanosheets have transformed into quasi-sphere structure via a self-assembly process utilizing the effect of Oswald, which evidently reduced defect density within a molecular of g-C3N4, because of strong interaction between the generation of C-O bond of g-C3N4 nanosheets during refluxing in the isopropanol solvent and molecular group of isopropanol (hydroxyl group and the carbon chain structure). The self-assembly quasi-sphere g-C3N4 samples exhibit much faster photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate than other g-C3N4 samples under visible light irradiation and the hydrogen evolution rate is 30.67 mu mol h(-1), which is about 10 times higher than that of bulk g-C3N4. The enhanced hydrogen evolution performance for quasi-sphere g-C3N4 samples is ascribed to large surface areas and accelerated separation of charges.									49	3	0	0	10	0	50			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000443666000065

However, parasitic corrosion of Mg in aqueous electrolytes generates H-2 and surprisingly increases with increasing current density during battery discharge (Mg oxidation), limiting the faradaic efficiency of aqueous Mg batteries. In this study, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and H-2 pressure rise measurements were used to characterize Mg corrosion in Mg-air batteries employing aqueous electrolytes with salts (NaCl, NaNO3, NaPO4, and a NaCl/NaPO4 mixture) that provide various degrees of Mg passivation. H-2 evolution rates were highest in NaCl electrolytes and lowest in NaNO3 electrolytes. However, NaNO3 salts reduced the H-2-evolving corrosion rate at the expense of introducing a nitrate to nitrite corrosion reaction into the battery. The combined Mg corrosion rate in the nitrate-based electrolyte was still lowest among those electrolytes studied. The nitrate to nitrite corrosion reaction also lowered the magnitude of the Mg anodic potential and therefore decreased the overall Mg-O-2 battery voltage compared to the NaCl electrolyte.

Herein, we demonstrate a robust and mass-produced strategy to in-situ grow Ni2P/Fe2P nanohybrids on Ni foam (Ni2P/Fe2P/NF) as an advanced electrode for overall urea electrolysis via a 30 s manual shaking reaction of FeCl3 center dot 6H(2)O, K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] and pre-treated NF, followed by a facile phosphorization treatment. The as prepared Ni2P/Fe2P/NF electrode exhibits high activity for the HER at 115 mV and UOR at 1.36 V with the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and only a cell voltage of 1.47 V is required to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work reveals a promising industrializable pathway to develop non-noble materials as bifunctional catalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Three major crosslinked products were obtained in addition to the crosslinked product between the extrinsic 33 kDa and the intrinsic CP47 proteins. They were identified to be: cyt c-550-12 kDa; cyt c-550-12 kDa-33 kDa; D2-cyt c-550-12 kDa. These results indicate that the three extrinsic proteins are closely located with each other in cyanobacterial PSII, supporting the previous proposal that, like the 33 kDa protein, cyt c-550 and the 12 kDa protein are associated with PSII at the lumenal. side of thylakoids. The results also suggested that the D2 reaction center protein provides a direct binding site for the extrinsic cyt c-550.									25	0	0	0	24	0	25			0014-5793			WOS:A1994PV19700004	7982483

To deal with this challenge, fossil fuels are being partially replaced by renewable energy such as solar and wind. However, such energy sources are usually intermittent and currently constitute a very low portion of the overall energy consumption. Recently, the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to chemicals and fuels with high energy density driven by electricity derived from renewable energy has been recognized as a promising strategy toward sustainable energy.The activation and reduction of CO2, which is a thermodynamically stable and kinetically inert molecule, is extremely challenging. Although the participation of protons in the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) helps lower the energy barrier, high overpotentials are still needed to efficiently drive the process. On the other hand, the concurrent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under CO2RR conditions leads to lower selectivity toward CO2RR products. Electrocatalysts that are highly active and selective for multicarbon products are urgently needed to improve the energy efficiency of CO2RR The reduction of CO2 involves multiple proton electron transfers and has many complex intermediates. Recent reports have shown that the relative stability of the intermediates on the surface of catalysts determines final reaction pathways as well as the product selectivity. Furthermore, this reaction displays a strong structure-sensitivity. The atomic arrangement, electronic structure, chemical composition, and oxidation state of the catalysts significantly influence catalyst performance. Fundamental understanding of the dependence of the reaction mechanisms on the catalyst structure would guide the rational design of new nanostructured CO2RR catalysts. As a reaction proceeding in a complex environment containing gas/liquid/solid interfaces, CO2RR is also intensively affected by the electrolyte. The electrolyte composition in the near surface region of the electrode where the reaction takes place plays a vital role in the reactivity. However, the former might also be indirectly determined by the bulk electrolyte composition via diffusion. Adding to the complexity, the structure, chemical state and surface composition of the catalysts under reaction conditions usually undergo dynamic changes, especially when adsorbed ions are considered. Therefore, in addition to tuning the structure of the electrocatalysts, being able to also modify the electrolyte provides an alternative method to tune the activity and selectivity of CO2RR. In situ and operando characterization methods must be employed to gain in depth understanding on the structure- and electrolyte-sensitivity of real CO2RR catalysts under working conditions.This Account provides examples of recent advances in the development of nanostructured catalysts and mechanistic understanding of CO2RR. It discusses how the structure of a catalyst (crystal orientation, oxidation state, atomic arrangement, defects, size, surface composition, segregation, etc.) influences the activity and selectivity, and how the electrolyte also plays a determining role in the reaction activity and selectivity. Finally, the importance of in situ and operando characterization methods to understand the structure- and electrolyte-sensitivity of the CO2RR is discussed.									145	8	0	0	7	0	146			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000451245900034	30335937

Herein, Co(II) as a hole cocatalyst modified P-doped g-C3N4 were successfully prepared to ameliorate the separation efficiency of photoinduced carriers and enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production. The photocatalytic results demonstrated that the P-doped g-C3N4 (PCN) exhibited higher photocatalytic activity compared with pure g-C3N4, while Co(II)/PCN photocatalyst exhibited further enhancement of photocatalytic performance. The proposed possible mechanism based on various characterizations is that P-doping can modulate the electronic structure of g-C3N4 to boost the separation of photogenerated-e(-) and h*; while the synergistic effect of both Co(II) (as hole cocatalyst) and Pt (as electron cocatalyst) can not only lead to the directional shunting of photogenerated e*-h(-) pairs, but further accelerate the photogenerated electrons transfer to Pt in order to join the photocatalytic reduction process for hydrogen evolution. As a result, the transportation and separation of photoinduced carriers were accelerated to greatest extent in the Pt/Co(ll)/PCN photocatalyst.

However, the major phototrophic lineages are not closely related to one another in bacterial phylogeny, and the origins of their respective photosynthetic machinery remain obscured by time and low sequence similarity. To better understand the co-evolution of Cyanobacteria and other ancient anoxygenic phototrophic lineages with respect to geologic time, we designed and implemented a variety of molecular clocks that use horizontal gene transfer (HGT) as additional, relative constraints. These HGT constraints improve the precision of phototroph divergence date estimates and indicate that stem green non-sulfur bacteria are likely the oldest phototrophic lineage. Concurrently, crown Cyanobacteria age estimates ranged from 2.2Ga to 2.7Ga, with stem Cyanobacteria diverging 2.8Ga. These estimates provide a several hundred Ma window for oxygenic photosynthesis to evolve prior to the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) 2.3Ga. In all models, crown green sulfur bacteria diversify after the loss of the banded iron formations from the sedimentary record (1.8Ga) and may indicate the expansion of the lineage into a new ecological niche following the GOE. Our date estimates also provide a timeline to investigate the temporal feasibility of different photosystem HGT events between phototrophic lineages. Using this approach, we infer that stem Cyanobacteria are unlikely to be the recipient of an HGT of photosystem I proteins from green sulfur bacteria but could still have been either the HGT donor or the recipient of photosystem II proteins with green non-sulfur bacteria, prior to the GOE. Together, these results indicate that HGT-constrained molecular clocks are useful tools for the evaluation of various geological and evolutionary hypotheses, using the evolutionary histories of both genes and organismal lineages.									41	0	0	0	31	0	41			1472-4677	1472-4669		WOS:000425181000005	29384268

In skeletal muscle, it has long been recognized that aerobic fibers that are used for steady state locomotion tend to be smaller than anaerobic fibers that are used for burst movements. This tendency reflects the interaction between diffusion distances and aerobic ATP turnover rates, since maximal intracellular diffusion distances are ultimately limited by fiber size. The effect of diffusion distance on O-2 flux in muscle has been the subject of quantitative analyses for a century, but the influence of ATP diffusion from mitochondria to cellular ATPases on aerobic metabolism has received much less attention. The application of reaction-diffusion mathematical models to experimental measurements of aerobic metabolic processes has revealed that the extreme diffusion distances between mitochondria found in some muscle fibers do not necessarily limit the rates of aerobic processes per se, as long as the metabolic process is sufficiently slow. However, skeletal muscle fibers from a variety of animals appear to have intracellular diffusion distances and/or fiber sizes that put them on the brink of diffusion limitation. Thus, intracellular metabolite diffusion likely influences the evolution of muscle design and places limits on muscle function.									47	0	0	0	46	0	47			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000251107700005	17921152

Therefore, it is necessary to design an effective transition metal sulfide down to a molecular level. In this work, a multi-level spatial confinement strategy was developed to fabricate Co-promoted 1T-MoS2 (1T-Co-MoS2) by employing Evans-Showell-type polyoxometalates (POMs) [Co2Mo10O38H4] as molecular precursor. Highly dispersed 1T-Co-MoS2 nanoclusters with few layers (1-3 layers) and ultrasmall size (<5 nm) were synthesized within the hollow mesoporous carbon sphere (HMCS) by in situ vapor phase sulfurization. During the preparation, coordination bonds, organic cations and mesopores provide a triple-confinement environment to limit the growth of 1T-Co-MoS2 from the atomic level, molecular level to mesoscopic scale. The obtained 1T-Co-MoS2@HMCS exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity and excellent long-term durability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with overpotentials of 220 and 245 mV to achieve the current density of 200 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. The corresponding theoretical calculations indicate that Co-S edge sites are the most active sites of 1T-Co-MoS2 for HER, reflecting the major significance of Co doping. The superior HER performance could be attributed to the high intrinsic activity from Co-doped 1T-MoS2 sites, abundant exposed active sites from ultra-dispersed nanosheets, and enhanced charge and mass transfer within the HMCS substrate. This work provides a novel design concept via hierarchical multiple-level confinement for the synthesis of high-quality 1T-Co-MoS2 and achieves outstanding performance in electrocatalytic HER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000784877200001

The use of negative precursor ions SIFT-MS allows the detection of carbon dioxide, water and ozone, while increasing the selectivity for VOCs. The complete understanding of all the possible ion-molecule reactions led to the development of accurate quantification methods, independent of any variation of the air matrix composition. For instance, due to the low reactivity of carbon dioxide with OH- its correct monitoring implies considering not only the reaction of the analyte with the precursor ion, but also with their more reactive hydrates.The results obtained by the developed method were validated on certified standard concentrations. This new SIFT-MS analysis method was further applied to an actual case for the evaluation of indoor air purifying devices and agreed with less convenient and more time-consuming standard analysis methods. It was thus demonstrated for the first time that the simultaneous high frequency, single run and direct monitoring of VOCs, carbon dioxide, water and ozone gave a complete overview of the device operation and of the matrix evolution.					19th Brazilian Meeting on Analytical Chemistry / 7th Iberoamerican Congress on Analytical Chemistry19th Brazilian Meeting on Analytical Chemistry / 7th Iberoamerican Congress on Analytical Chemistry	SEP 16-19, 2018SEP 16-19, 2018	Brazilian Chem Soc, Anal Chem DivBrazilian Chem Soc, Anal Chem Div	Caldas Novas, BRAZILCaldas Novas, BRAZIL	9	0	0	0	3	0	9			0026-265X	1095-9149		WOS:000514218800053

The morphology, size of the crystallites, as well as elemental and phase composition of the prepared structures, were examined using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. It was found that the synthesized products represent heterostructures containing MoS2 nanoparticles formed on ZnO nanoparticles. Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence analysis were also used for characterization of the prepared heterostructures. The obtained MoS2@ZnO nanostructures revealed an intense broad emission band ranging from 425 to 625 nm for samples with different fractions of MoS2. Photocatalytic measurements showed that the maximal hydrogen evolution rate of the prepared nanoheterostructures was about 906.6 mu mol center dot g(-1)center dot h(-1).

Beside major, minor and trace elements, river and sulfate-carbonate ground water were analyzed for the C-13/C-12 ratios of the dissolved carbonate species, the O-18/O-16 ratio of water, and the S-34/S-32 and O-18/O-16 ratios of dissolved sulfate. Additionally, the carbon, sulfur and oxygen isotopic composition of the major karst aquifers (carbonate and gypsum/anhydrite rocks) of the Permian Zechstein formation was measured. Nowadays, the stable isotope biogeochemistry of the river and karst water in the studied area results from the complex interactions between dissolution of biogenic CO2 in the water-unsaturated zone, (minor) subterrestrial microbial decomposition reactions of organic matter (recent DOC or fossil organic matter), interactions with carbonate and sulfate aquifer minerals, and input of acids from atmospheric pollution (e.g., sulfuric acid). Subsurface precipitation of secondary calcite due to the incongruent dissolution of gypsum and/or dolomite is deduced from the hydrogeochemical composition of selected ground waters and the isotopical composition of calcite found in gypsum aquifer material. Spring and river waters were additionally influenced by the liberation of carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere, a process which is accompanied by the preferrential desorbtion of (CO2)-C-12. The sulfur isotopic composition of dissolved sulfate from ground and spring waters indicates a mixture of sulfate derived from surface waters (mainly originating from atmospheric pollution) and geogenic sulfate from the subsurface dissolution of gypsum/anhydrite of the Zechstein formation. The oxygen isotopic composition of dissolved sulfate is generally far away from the exchange equilibrium with water, but consistent with the two-component mixing model derived from the sulfur isotope ratios.									15	0	0	0	5	0	15			1025-6016			WOS:000083921200004	29016210

Experimental measurements and computational predictions of residence time distributions demonstrate an appropriate hydrodynamics of the equipment. A main peak near the mean residence time was detected revealing that a fluid by-pass or dead regions are absent and the Peclet number, obtained by correlation of the experimental data, was higher than 9. Mass-transfer measurements made by using a segmented, or a grooved or a smooth cathode corroborate the good performance of the cylindrical body of the hydrocyclone. The presence of the gas phase has little influence on the residence time distribution as well as on the mass-transfer behaviour of this device. Sulphur dioxide reduction to colloidal sulphur was used as a test reaction to check the performance of the reactor. The best results were obtained at a cathodic potential of -0.5 V, against a saturated calomel electrode, where hydrogen evolution is not possible as a cathodic side reaction. Thus, a 56% current efficiency with a specific energy consumption of 20.4 kWh kg(-1) and a space time yield of 10.4 kg m(-3) h(-1) were attained under a two-phase flow of 5% SO2 in nitrogen. The sulphur particles obtained from the spigot present an average size of 6.7 mu m being those carried by the overflow stream smaller, both of them of high purity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The included review comprises a set of 35 distinct mechanisms covering more than 30 years of work intended to model different aspects of propane-air chemistry. A selection of the available mechanisms was compared using a calibrated and validated zero-dimensional constant volume simulation with mixture ignition delay as the primary metric. The most accurate version across a range of equivalence ratios and temperatures was the San Diego mechanism due to its continual evolution through the adjustment of the reactions forming hydroxyl radicals to match ignition data. Subsequently, a reduced form of this mechanism was generated for three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations by removing reactions that did not affect the ignition delay at the 1 ms level. A one-dimensional variable property reacting flow shock tube simulation illustrated that this reduced mechanism did lose some accuracy in predicting the ignition delay for a unique set of data. However, it worked effectively in conjunction with the CFD model to predict the unique operational characteristics of the acoustically-pressurized ramjet engine. (C) 2019 Energy Institute.

For the converter smelting, some new oxygen lances were designed by using the simulation study of the characteristics of the oxygen lance supersonic jet. Some mathematical models have been established to describe the slag-metal-gas multiphase flow behavior in steelmaking converter, and the flow field, mixing efficiency, metal droplet splashing, lining scouring and other physical phenomena. For the ladle refining, the Euler-Euler model gradually replaces the quasi-unidirectional and Euler-Lagrangian models, and successfully describes the phenomena of bubble turbulent dispersion caused by liquid turbulent fluctuation, and bubble-induced turbulence occurring during bubble floating process. So, some new and important inclusion transport mechanisms and phenomena have been presented. The CFD-PBM model was used to predict successfully the inclusion transport, collision growth and removal behavior in the molten steel, which enriches the inclusions removal theory of ladle refining. The CFD-SRM coupled model was used to accurately describe the slag-metal reaction and desulfurization behavior in a gas-stirred ladle, and the effect of the different content of compositions in synthetic slag and liquid steel, arrangement of bottom blowing tuyeres on the slag-metal reactions and desulfurization efficiency were discussed and clarified. For steel continuous casting, as the heat flow model from the solidified shell to the copper plate of mold was coupled with the thermo/mechanical model of the solidified shell, distributions of mold flux and air gap both along circumference and height directions of the mold were successfully predicted, while founded theoretical backgrounds for designing new mold with inner convex surface and controlling the surface corner crack of micro-alloyed steel. The coupled simulation between flow and electromagnetic fields in mold revealed the flow behavior of molten steel with electromagnetic stirring or braking, the fluctuation characteristic of the slag-steel interface and the distribution characteristic of inclusions in the strand. Based on the volume averaged method, multi-field and multi-phase solidification model successfully clarified the formation mechanism of macro-segregation in continuously cast strand and quantitatively predicted central/centerline segregation indexes in the strand under different casting conditions. In addition, the numerical simulation of the evolution of solidification structure of the continuously cast strand mainly focused on the as-cast grain, and its extension to the dendrite structure needed further more endeavors. Generally speaking, the numerical simulation in steelmaking-continuous casting process is moving towards coupling multi-physical/chemistry phenomena and multi-fields and gradually transits to the microscopic scale.									13	6	0	0	0	0	17			0412-1961			WOS:000424817200002

Herein, a facile electrodeposition process is reported to integrate the hierarchical MoS2/Ni3S2 structure as a catalyst layer onto the surface of Ni protected Si photocathode. Rough surface morphology and obvious electronic interactions between Ni3S2 and MoS2 were observed experimentally, while the theoretical calculation illustrated that the atomic mixed MoS2/Ni3S2 interfaces enhance the hydrogen-adsorption of MoS2 and hydroxide adsorption of Ni3S2 and thus accelerate both the Volmer and Tafel steps in HER process. An excellent photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance with an onset potential of 0.54 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode and an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of 11.2% were obtained in MoS2/Ni3S2/Ni/nthornnpthorn-Si photocathode under simulated AM1.5G illumination in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. Furthermore, comparing with the hybrid MoS2@Ni3S2 catalyst on Ni/Si with an inferior stability, the hierarchical MoS2/Ni3S2 structure releases the stress between the layers and leads to the stability of the photocathode with over 172-h PEC operation under 41.5 mA/cm(2). This finding represents a potential low-cost and scalable approach toward making high performance, precious metal-free Si photocathodes for solar hydrogen production in alkaline media.									39	2	0	0	2	0	39			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000530669500027

We introduce a concept of effective volume by measuring the thickness of the region where the hydrogen and hydroxyl ion interactions with Fe-based MG take place, which is characterized by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. A very constant film thickness influenced by the OH- and H+ is confirmed by TEM, where the chemical homogeneity is maintained within this region. The weight percent of hydrogen and the corresponding hydrogen-to-metal ratio are determined as 1.16% and 0.56, respectively. When compared to previous studies conducted by the electrochemical- permeation method, the H/M ratio is found to be an order of magnitude larger. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and subsequent equivalent circuit modeling (ECM) of the tested ribbons resolve the surface-diffusion processes for hydride formation and oxidation kinetics. This contribution provides a different perspective for the design and study of low-cost and high-performance amorphous nanofilms for hydrogenenergy applications, particularly when the common gas-adsorption methods are problematic.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000573640600001

The thermal windows of a suite of biochemical and physiological metrics that characterise tissue aerobic status, were then measured in response to acute temperature elevation (2-2.5 degrees C increase per week). To test if acclimation had occurred at the higher temperature, results were compared with published data, from the preceding year, for L elliptica which had been incubated at ambient temperature (0.0 degrees C) and then subjected to the same acute temperature treatments. Incubation to 3.0 degrees C led to a temperature induced increase of tissue aerobic status (reduced intracellular cCO(2) with increased O-2 consumption, PLA (phospho-L-arginine) and ATP). At the highest acute temperature (7.5 degrees C) the increase in anaerobic pathways (summed acetate/succinate and propionate) was less after 3.0 degrees C than 0.0 degrees C incubation. No other metric shifted its reaction norm in response to acute temperature elevation and so whole animal acclimation had not occurred, even after 3 months at 3.0 degrees C. Combined with the constant mortality throughout the 3.0 degrees C incubation period, these data suggest that the recorded physiological changes were either the early stages of acclimation or, more likely, time limited resistance mechanisms.

In this study, a series of MnxCd1-xS products (0 x 1.0) have been prepared by a facile hydrothermal method, and the resultant Mn0.5Cd0.5S solid solution exhibits the highest photocatalytic H-2 production activity (286 mol h(-1)), which is 1.83 times higher than that (156 mol h(-1)) of single CdS under visible light ( 420 nm) irradiation. After being modified with MoS(2)via a one-pot hydrothermal process, the MoS2-modified Mn0.5Cd0.5S (MoS2/Mn0.5Cd0.5S) composites achieve remarkable improvement in their photocatalytic performance under 420 nm light irradiation, and the 0.5 wt% MoS2/Mn0.5Cd0.5S displays the highest H-2 production activity (491 mol h(-1)), which is much higher than that (286 mol h(-1)) of pristine Mn0.5Cd0.5S and also slightly higher than that (417 mol h(-1)) of 1.0 wt% Pt/Mn0.5Cd0.5S. The intimate interfacial contact between Mn0.5Cd0.5S nanoparticles and few-layer MoS2 cocatalysts formed during the one-pot hydrothermal process facilitates the electron transfer from Mn0.5Cd0.5S to MoS2, and thus promotes the photogenerated charge separation and provides more active sites for H-2 evolution reaction. This work demonstrates that low cost and earth-abundant MoS2 as an effective cocatalyst can replace noble metals for visible-light-driven H-2 production over MnxCd1-xS solid solutions.									19	2	0	0	1	0	19			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000459731200020

The ligands are ethylene cross-bridged tetraazamacrocycles derived from cylam and cyclen, respectively. The synthesis and characterization of these complexes, including X-ray crystal structure determinations, are described. The structural evidence demonstrates that the tetradentate ligands enforce distorted octahedral geometries on the metal ions, with two cis sites occupied by labile ligands. Magnetic measurements reveal that the complexes are high spin with typical magnetic moments. Cyclic voltammetry shows reversible redox processes for the Fe3+/Fe2+ couples of the iron(LU) complexes, while Mn3+/Mn2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ couples were observed for the complexes with manganese(III). The manganese chemistry of 1 was studied in depth. The dichloro maganese(III) cation of 1 undergoes facile ligand substitution reactions at the labile, monodentate sites, for example substituting azide for chloride ligands. Air oxidation of the dichloro complex of Mn (1)(2+) in basic solution does not give the expected mu -oxo dimeric product common to manganese. Instead, an unusual manganese(III)-OH complex has been isolated from this reaction and structurally characterized. A similar reaction under slightly different conditions gives a putative Mn-III(OH)(2) complex that metathesizes to Mn-III(OMe)(2) upon recrystallization from methanol.									82	2	0	0	7	0	83			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000166669400005	11209599

The physicochemical investigations of the electrocatalyst executed by surface area analyzer, XRD, transmission electron microscope submits creation of a mesoporous crystalline nanostructured of meso-CoPi with a surface area of 124 m(2) g(-1). This is an 10-fold greatness superior than that for bulk-CoPi particles produced without surfactant template. The meso-CoPi electrocatalyst comprises of metallic cobalt layered with a cobalt-oxo/hydroxo-phosphate layer which facilitates the electro-oxidation of methanol at modest overpotential of < 1.2 V vs RHE in alkaline solution. The methanol oxidation activity of the meso-CoPi catalyst shows more than 20-fold current increase at 1.4 V-RHE in comparison to bulk-CoPi counterpart which due to the enhancement of the electroactive specific surface area. Liquid crystal template chemical approach provides a reproducible stage to synthesize mesoporous metal phosphates with improved electrocatalytic activities.

Relative to the rest potential, the J-E characteristics produced by the model showed an increase in total over-potential required to reach a specified current density for the metallized photoelectrodes relative to that of a metal electrode. This prediction was in accord with the experimentally observed behavior of Pt on p-Si, but was in contrast to the behavior observed for Ni on p-Si. Properly accounting for junction energetics and kinetics of the HER is critical to accurate predictions of the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) energy-conversion efficiency of metallized integrated photoelectrochemical systems. Further, models that accurately predict the performance of metal catalysts on semiconductor light absorbers are required to optimize the catalytic performance of metallized photoelectrodes.

Therefore, it is urgent to design efficient bifunctional catalysts to improve the reaction kinetics. Herein, a self-supported electrode, anchoring CoP nanoparticles on N doped carbon/graphene (NC-G) and chemically growing on Ni foam as a whole electrode (denoted as NC-G-CoP/NF) displays promising electrocatalytic performance in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, with a low overpotentials of 68 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for HER and 255 mV at 50 mA cm-2 for OER. This bifunctional electrocatalyst only needs 1.435 V to generate 10 mA cm-2 for overall water splitting. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance is ascribed to the following factors: i) inherent nature of transition metal phosphides, ii) abundant and high dispersion N active sites in NC-G, iii) strong interaction between the NC-G and CoP nanoparticles, and iv) rapid electron transfer between the catalytic centers and Nickle foam.

Transition metal phosphides are active and low-cost catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), although, none thus far have exhibited stable performance when interfaced with semiconductors. Here, we report on a monolithic junction consisting of cubic-NiP2:TiN:Si, fabricated using both commercial and custom Si photovoltaics. Stable performance is achieved using an ultrathin film of crystalline TiN that effectively hinders atomic diffusion between interfaces during fabrication. Crystalline cubic-NiP2 deposited on TiN/n(+) p-Si retains 97% of the bare Si photovoltage, comparable saturation current density to bare Si, and has a turnover frequency of 1.04 H-2 per site per s at -100 mV applied potential. In acid, it requires only -150 mV additional overpotential compared to the benchmark, Pt/TiN/n(+) p-Si, to reach a HER photocurrent density of -10 mA cm(-2). This photocathode maintains a stable H-2 photocurrent (+/- 10%) for at least 125 hours, the duration of testing. When the same layers are fabricated on a commercial Si solar cell, this photocathode produced double the photocurrent density (36.3 mA cm(-2), under simulated 1.5 AM G illumination). Physical characterization gives detailed information on the properties responsible for the observed activity and durability of these interfaces. In general, the thin-film methodology presented here is widely applicable, demonstrates superior activity, and achieves long-term stability.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000457546000049

Here, the C-Cu-DI and C-Cu materials with the copper based nanoporous carbon structures were synthesized by carbonizing MOF199 and DIMOF199. The composite structure and HER electrocatalytic properties of the C-Cu-DI and C-Cu materials are studied. The results show that C-Cu-DI and C-Cu samples exhibit good catalytic activity. And CCu- DI sample through the addition of Dimethyl imidazole(DI) in the DI-MOF199 precursor has higher electrocatalytic activity than the C-Cu sample. The superior catalytic activity is attributed to the special composite structure of nanoscale deposition particles on the framework with plenty of nano pores and nano copper and few copper oxidation particles distributed or wrapped into the amorphous porous carbon phase. The nano copper and few copper oxidation particles in the C-Cu and C-Cu-DI catalysts maybe provide the more effective catalytic activity sites. The C-Cu-DI composite with large size spherical hollow deposition particles has higher conductivity, better BET surface area and reasonable micro-mesomacro porous distribution, so the overpotentials at the current density of 1 mA cm-2 and 10 mA cm-2 are respectively 270 mV and 390 mV vs. RHE. Although the HER activity has a big gap with commercial platinum catalyst, this study can provide an important experimental exploration for the design of copper based non noble metal/nano porous carbon composite HER electrocatalyst.

SACs could reduce the amount of metals used for the surface reaction and have often shown distinct selectivity, which the corresponding nanoparticles would not have. However, SACs typically have the limitations of low-metal content, poor stability, oxidic electronic states, and an absence of ensemble sites. In this review, various efforts to overcome these limitations have been discussed: The metal content in the SACs could increase up to over 10 wt %; highly durable SACs could be prepared by anchoring the metal atoms strongly on the defective support; metallic SACs are reported; and the ensemble catalysts, in which all the metal atoms are exposed at the surface like the SACs but the surface metal atoms are located nearby, are also reported. Metal atomic multimers with distinct catalytic properties have been also reported. Surface metal single-atoms could be decorated with organic ligands with interesting catalytic behavior. Heterogeneous atomic catalysts, whose structure is elaborately controlled and the surface reaction is better understood, can be a paradigm with higher catalytic activity, selectivity, and durability and used in industrial applications.									45	3	0	0	4	1	47			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000595533800006	33140947

The Sn2TiO4 phase was synthesized using either a SnCl2 flux or a SnCl2/SnF2 peritectic flux in a 2:1 flux-to-precursor ratio heated at 600 and 400 degrees C for 24 h, respectively. The two types of salt fluxes resulted in large rod-shaped particles at 600 degrees C and smaller tetragonal prism-shaped particles at 400 degrees C. Surface photovoltage spectroscopy measurements produced a negative photovoltage under illumination >1.50 eV, which confirmed electrons as the majority charge carriers and similar to 1.50 eV as the effective band gap. Mott-Schottky measurements at pH 9.0 showed the conduction (-0.54 V vs NHE) and valence band (+1.01 V vs NHE) positions meet the critical thermodynamic requirements for total water splitting. The Sn2TiO4 particles were deposited and annealed as polycrystalline films on FTO slides, and exhibited photoanodic currents in aqueous solutions under visible-light irradiation. The Sn2TiO4 particles were also suspended in aqueous methanol solutions and irradiated with visible and ultraviolet light. The larger rod-shaped Sn2TiO4 particles had the higher rates of photocatalytic hydrogen production (similar to 11.6 mu mol H-2 h(-1)) in comparison to the smaller tetragonal prism-shaped Sn2TiO4 particles (similar to 3.4 mu mol H-2 h(-1)). Conversely, for photocatalytic oxygen production, the rates for the smaller tetragonal prism-shaped particles in aqueous AgNO3 solution were slightly higher (similar to 16.3 mu mol O-2 h(-1)) than for the larger rod-shaped particles (similar to 11.9 mu mol O-2 h(-1)). Apparent quantum yields of 0.995% and 0.0098% were measured for O-2 and H-2 production, respectively, under 435 nm light.									49	2	0	0	3	0	49			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000391080900005

We also synthesized Au heterostructures that are encapsulated by FeS2, where the sulfide concentration and annealing time lead to eccentric aggregation of the FeS2. p-type Si coupled with the as-prepared catalysts exhibited enhanced photocathodic performance under an acidic medium. With FeS2, the optimized photocathodic performance was obtained by achieving a geometric photocurrent of 10 mA cm(-2) at a positive applied potential of 0.08 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). As the size of the FeS2 increased, the cathodic photocurrent also increased, which indicates a longer carrier lifetime and slow charge recombination on the catalyst surface. It was found that the direction of the FeS2 growth is aligned with the equivalent (111) plane of the Au, resulting in a unique Au-FeS2 heterostructure. The optimized heterostructure photocatalyst showed highly improved cathodic performance with an anodic shift of the cell voltage by 0.26 V (vs. RHE) compared with bare FeS2. This study demonstrates the synergistic effect of the generation of hot electrons on Au and fast charge flow across the FeS2 layer, which facilitates fast electron-hole separation and enhances the hydrogen evolution reaction.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000482139000042

CH4 mimics the-CH3 termination and aliphatic subunits of a polymer chain. Low-energy ion scattering measurements of magnetron sputtered thin films suggest that the bonding at the surfaces of pristine a-AlYB14 and 02 exposed a-AIYB14 (O-2//aAlYB(14)) is metal-boron and metal-oxygen dominated, respectively. Based on the 46 initio calculations the adsorption energies of CH4 on a-AlYB14 and O-2//a-AlYB14 decreases from -0.07 to -0.30 eV, respectively. This trend is consistent with experimental data obtained by colloidal probe UHV-AFM studies with a polyethylene sphere, where larger adhesion forces for the O-2 exposed surface as compared to the pristine a-AIYB(14) surface were measured. No charge transfer takes place between CH4 and the pristine as well as the O-2 exposed a-AlYB14. Oxygen chemisorption induces changes in surface bonding. States at the Fermi level are depleted upon oxidation, hence the surface bonding becomes more semiconducting causing a charge redistribution within the adsorbed CH4 molecule. Hence, these data serve as proof of concept for exploring the effect of O-2 exposure on the interaction between aliphatic polymers and a-AlYB14 using a correlative experimental and theoretical research approach.

Titanium oxide-based materials have been widely explored as electrocatalysts supports in consideration of their chemical stability, strong interactions with metal catalyst and wider applications in electrocatalytic reactions as well as the improved electronic conductivity. This review summarizes recent research advances in engineering tita-nium oxide-based supports for the catalysts in electrocatalysis field to provide guidance for designing high performance non-carbon supported electrocatalysts. Typically, the titanium oxide-based supports are classified into shaped TiO2, doped TiO2, titanium suboxide and TiO2-carbon composites according to the modification methods and corresponding preparation methods.

The influence of the Pd addition during the synthesis of PtxPd1-x alloys in presence of octylamine as stabilizer was analyzed in terms of structure, chemical composition and electroactivity in the methanol oxidation reaction. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that the surface of the electrodes consisted of a metallic mixture and oxide states, which confirmed the change in the electronic properties during the alloy formation. The current density of Pt30Pd70/C during CV measurements was about 2.1 times higher than the one observed with Pt/C electrodes. The CO tolerance was also slightly improved under similar conditions. The work findings indicate that stabilized Pt30Pd70/C binary alloys can be used to design highly active anodic catalysts with potential applications in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs).

Nevertheless, forearc sequence generated by subduction initiation need not always include boninitic rocks. Here we reconstruct a forearc chemostratigraphy without boninitic affinity based on the Central Palawan and Amnay (CPA) ophiolites of the west Philippines to show diversity in melt evolution of SIM. Zircon U-Pb dating on the MORB-type Amnay gabbros reveal a 10 m.y. of seafloor spreading from 33 to 23 Ma. These ages together with the progressively enriched zircon in-situ oxygen isotopes (delta O-18 = 1.62-10.1 parts per thousand) and whole rock elemental and Nd-Hf isotopic signatures ([La/Yb](N) = 0.19-3.45; Nb/Yb = 0.07-5.24; epsilon Nd = 2.1-10.2; epsilon Hf = 11.2-24.1) indicate that the depleted MORB mantle (DMM)-type source of the Amnay ophiolite was getting enriched by fluxing of aqueous slab fluid in the early stage followed by addition of adakitic and Nb-enriched slab melts in the later stage. This distinct mantle evolution together with higher epsilon Hf at a given epsilon Nd of the Amnay mafic samples than the contemporaneous South China Sea (SCS) oceanic samples do not support previous interpretation that the Amnay ophiolite was a fragment of the SCS. However, the 33-23 Ma Amnay ophiolite can be the younger part of the 34 Ma forearc-type Central Palawan ophiolite, and both (i.e. the CPA ophiolites) represent on-land fragments of the NW Sulu Sea. We propose that the 34-23 Ma CPA ophiolites and the NW Sulu Sea constitute forearc basin of the late Oligocene-middle Miocene island arc-backarc basin duo of the Cagayan Ridge and SE Sulu Sea, associated with subduction of the Cretaceous to Eocene Proto-SCS since 34 Ma. The CPA ophiolites lack boninite but show geochemical progression from normal to enriched MORB affinities, whose melt evolution differs from that of the IBM SIM. We attribute the differences in SIM and variations in forearc chemostratigraphy to the subduction of a younger slab with thick terrigenous sediment cover of the Proto-SCS versus an older slab with thin pelagic sediment cover of the Pacific Plate.

In this work, we perform a thorough investigation on the formation of surface oxides on Pd(211) using advanced first principles calculations. A detailed mechanism of the surface oxide formation is revealed: starting from simple O chemisorption, the step sites of Pd(211) are oxidized by formation of local linear O-Pd-O oxide structures and then planar Pd-O-4 structures as the O coverage is increased; the local oxide structures spread out to yield a surface oxide layer, and finally 3-dimesional oxide forms with the increase of the degree of surface oxidation. The structures of O-Pd-O and Pd-O-4 are revealed to be the basic units for oxide formation and can be considered as the oxide seeds. The origin of the oxide seed formation is identified, and the understanding of the oxide formation process is provided. A simple equation is derived, which describes the general trend of O vacancy formation in the oxides. The equation may be of great use for understanding oxide formation on Pd surfaces.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000462649400014	30839957

Here, we address this challenge through the use of metal-ion redox couples as energy carriers for battery operation. Carbon, with a suitable degree of crystallinity and surface oxygenation, was used as an effective anode material for the metal redox reactions. A Sn0.9In0.1P2O7-based electrolyte membrane allowed no crossover of vanadium ions through the membrane. The V4+/V3+, V3+/V2+, and Sn4+/Sn2+ redox reactions took place at a more positive potential than that for hydrogen reduction, so that undesired hydrogen production could be avoided. The resulting electrical capacity reached 306 and 258mAhg(-1) for VOSO4 and SnSO4, respectively, and remained at 76 and 91% of their respective initial values after 50 cycles.									15	3	0	0	5	0	16			2196-0216			WOS:000371254600009	27525212

During summer, photosynthetic capacities and predawn photosystem If (PSII) efficiency were similarly high in all four populations, and in winter, only the sun-exposed and shaded populations at 2800 m exhibited complete down-regulation of photosynthetic oxygen evolution capacity and consistent sustained down-regulation of PSII efficiency. This photosynthetic down-regulation at high altitude involved a substantial decrease in PSII components [pheophytin, D1 protein, oxygen evolving complex ([OEC)], a strong up-regulation of several anti-early-light-inducible protein (Elip)- and anti-high-light-inducible protein (Hlip)-reactive bands and a warm-sustained retention of zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin (Z +A). PsbS, the protein modulating the rapid engagement and disengagement of Z + A in energy dissipation, exhibited its most pronounced winter increases in the shade at 1900 m, and thus apparently assumes a greater role in providing rapidly reversible zeaxanthin-dependent photoprotection during winter when light becomes excessive in the shaded population, which remains photosynthetically active. It is attractive to hypothesize that PsbS relatives (Elips/Hlips) may he involved in sustained zeaxanthin-de pendent photoprotection under the more extreme winter conditions at 2800 m.									75	1	1	0	75	0	79			0140-7791	1365-3040		WOS:000237133100013	17087470

Herein, we propose a powerful strategy to simultaneously boost the activity and selectivity by introducing strain engineering into the design of NRR electrocatalysts. The strain-engineered electrocatalysts consisted of monodisperse CuAu@Cu core-shell nanoparticles with controllable Cu skin via one-pot solvothermal process. Among them, electrocatalysts with about 2 layers of atomic Cu skin (CuAu@2LCS) achieve the highest NH3 yield rate (33.9 mu g(NH3) h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1)) and Faradic efficiency (24.1 %) at -0.2 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M HCl. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that owing to the unique structure of bimetallic alloys with the ultra-thin Cu skins, tensile strain and favorable ligand effect work together and tune the surface electronic structure of electrocatalysts, which not only strengthen N-2 affinity but also suppress the competitive HER process.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000627549100001

If true, the resulting thermonuclear explosions should be able to account for at least some of the range of SNe Ia observables. To study this, we conducted a parameter study based on three-dimensional simulations of double detonations in carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with a helium shell, assuming different core and shell masses. An admixture of carbon to the shell and solar metallicity are included in the models. The hydrodynamic simulations were carried out using the AREPO code. This allowed us to follow the helium shell detonation with high numerical resolution, and this improves the reliability of predicted nucleosynthetic shell detonation yields. The addition of carbon to the shell leads to a lower production of Ni-56, while including solar metallicity increases the production of intermediate mass elements. The production of higher mass elements is further shifted to stable isotopes at solar metallicity. Moreover, we find different core detonation ignition mechanisms depending on the core and shell mass configuration. This has an influence on the ejecta structure. We present the bolometric light curves predicted from our explosion simulations using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code ARTIS and make comparisons with bolometric SNe Ia data. The bolometric light curves of our models show a range of brightnesses, which is able to account for subluminous to normal brightness SNe Ia. We show the model bolometric width-luminosity relation compared to data for a range of model viewing angles. We find that, on average, our brighter models lie within the observed data. The ejecta asymmetries produce a wide distribution of observables, which might account for outliers in the data. However, the models overestimate the extent of this compared to data. We also find that the bolometric decline rate over 40 days, Delta m(40)(bol), appears systematically faster than data.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000660778800001

This work focuses on the details of the onset of the carbon detonation in the double detonation sub-Chandrasekhar model. In order to simulate the influence of core-shell mixing on the carbon ignition mechanism, the helium shell and its detonation are followed with an increased resolution compared to the rest of the star treating the propagation of the detonation wave more accurately. This significantly improves the predictions of the nucleosynthetic yields from the helium burning. The simulations were carried out with the AREPO code. A carbon-oxygen core with a helium shell was set up in one dimension and mapped to three dimensions. We ensured the stability of the white dwarf with a relaxation step before the hydrodynamic detonation simulation started. Synthetic observables were calculated with the radiative transfer code ARTIS. An ignition mechanism of the carbon detonation was observed, which received little attention before. In this "scissors mechanism", the impact the helium detonation wave has on unburnt material when converging opposite to its ignition spot is strong enough to ignite a carbon detonation. This is possible in a carbon enriched transition region between the core and shell. The detonation mechanism is found to be sensitive to details of the core-shell transition and our models illustrate the need to consider core-shell mixing taking place during the accretion process. Even though the detonation ignition mechanism differs form the converging shock mechanism, the differences in the synthetic observables are not significant. Though they do not fit observations better than previous simulations, they illustrate the need for multi-dimensional simulations.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000526208800001

The kinetics reveal a single rate constant with an exponential dependence on the surface hole potential, spanning time scales from 3 ns to 8 ps over a approximate to 1 V increase. A voltage- and laser illumination-induced process moves the valence band edge at the n-type semiconductor/water interface to continuously change the surface hole potential. This single step of the water oxidation reaction is assigned to the first hole transfer h(+) + OH- -> OH center dot. The kinetics quantify how much a change in the free energy difference driving this first hole transfer reduces the activation barrier. They are also used to extrapolate the kinetic rate due to the activation barrier when that free energy difference is zero, or the Nernstian potential. This is the first time transient spectroscopy has enabled the separation of the first hole transfer from the full four hole transfer cycle and a direct determination of these two quantities. The Nernstian potential for OH-/OH center dot is also suggested, in rough agreement with gas-phase studies. The observation of a distinct, much longer time scale upon picosecond hole transfer to OH- suggests that a dominant, more stable intermediate of the water oxidation reaction, possibly a surface bound oxo, may result.									46	2	0	0	5	0	46			0002-7863			WOS:000339693900019	25029360

This study designs a tensile-strained Pd anode and reveals that with a lower apparent activity toward the hydrogen oxidation reaction as compared to the unstrained one, it exhibits a surprisingly high activity in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). With an ultralow Pd loading of 4.5 mu g cm(-2), the tensile-strained Pd achieves a maximum power density of 1048 mW cm(-2), indicating a 30-fold improvement in power efficiency than that of commercial Pd/C, nearly four times of that of the unstrained one. This discrepancy can be ascribed to the hydrogen-rich surface in the H-2 atmosphere of PEMFCs owing to the accelerated hydrogen "spill-over" in the tensile-strained Pd with a standout hydrogen storage property.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-9608			WOS:000743202000001	35038252

However, it remains a great challenge to synthesize by a facile synthetic strategy and investigate the synergistic effect for various active components. Herein, a Cu0.81Ni0.19 alloy electrocatalyst doped with N, P, and F heteroatom is constructed by a simple liquid reduction method using ionic liquid as reducing agent and heteroatom dopant. The introduction of ionic liquid not only induces the flower-like morphological characteristics of the Cu0.81Ni0.19 alloy, but also regulates its interfacial electronic structure. This hybrid catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance towards the OER and HER in alkaline medium with ultralow overpotentials of 198 mV and 88 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2), respectively, which is among the most efficient Cu-based alloy electrocatalysts up to now. Combined with DFT calculations indicate that both the electronic structure and the reaction energy barrier of the intermediate are regulated by these heteroatoms in electrocatalysis process. This work opens up a facile method to highly efficient and durable alloy electrocatalysts using ionic liquid as a dopant, and is a promising candidate strategy for other alloy catalysts.									7	2	0	0	0	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000496923200022		
J	Heidary, Nina; Chartrand, Daniel; Guiet, Amandine; Kornienko, Nikolay								Rational incorporation of defects within metal-organic frameworks generates highly active electrocatalytic sites								CHEMICAL SCIENCE				12	21			7324	7333		10.1039/d1sc00573a		APR 2021		JUN 7 2021	2021	The allure of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in heterogeneous electrocatalysis is that catalytically active sites may be designed a priori with an unparalleled degree of control. An emerging strategy to generate coordinatively-unsaturated active sites is through the use of organic linkers that lack a functional group that would usually bind with the metal nodes. To execute this strategy, we synthesize a model MOF, Ni-MOF-74 and incorporate a fraction of 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid in place of 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid. The defective MOF, Ni-MOF-74D, is evaluated vs. the nominally defect-free Ni-MOF-74 with a host of ex situ and in situ spectroscopic and electroanalytical techniques, using the oxidation of hydroxymethylfurtural (HMF) as a model reaction. The data indicates that Ni-MOF-74D features a set of 4-coordinate Ni-O-4 sites that exhibit unique vibrational signatures, redox potentials, binding motifs to HMF, and consequently superior electrocatalytic activity relative to the original Ni-MOF-74 MOF, being able to convert HMF to the desired 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid at 95% yield and 80% faradaic efficiency. Furthermore, having such rationally well-defined catalytic sites coupled with in situ Raman and infrared spectroelectrochemical measurements enabled the deduction of the reaction mechanism in which co-adsorbed *OH functions as a proton acceptor in the alcohol oxidation step and carries implications for catalyst design for heterogeneous electrosynthetic reactions en route to the electrification of the chemical industry.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000647431100001	34163822

The supramolecular precursor was synthesized by hydrogen bonded self-assembly of melamine and cyanuric acid, in which cyanuric acid was from in-situ hydrolysis of melamine under haloid acid-assisted hydrothermal environment. The obtained hexagonal tubular CNs not only possess hierarchical micro-nanostructure, increased specific surface area, together with an enlarged band gap energy of 2.85 +/- 0.05 eV, but also show better light absorption capacity in visible to near-infrared region and improved separation rate of photogenerated carriers. Therefore, they exhibit enhanced photocatalytic reduction performance on water splitting to H-2, the largest hydrogen evolution rate can reach 2948.5 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is better than most reported CNs. Simultaneously, they also have excellent photocatalytic reduction ability on the conversion of CO2 to H-2, CO and CH4, exhibiting higher averaged electron consumption than previously reported semiconductor photocatalysts. Finally, the photocatalytic reduction mechanism over the synthetic tubular CN is proposed and discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A strong correlation between the phase compositions and the photocatalytic activities for hydrogen evolution was demonstrated, which can be attributed mainly to the significantly improved photogenerated charge carrier separation via interfacial type II junctions. Without any co-catalysts, finely phase-tuned composites, namely Sr5Ta4O15/Sr2Ta2O7, Sr5Ta4O15/Sr2Ta2O7/SrTa4O11 and Sr2Ta2O7/SrTa4O11, exhibited approximately 20, 38 and 76 times, respectively, higher H2 production rates from aqueous methanol solutions than pure Sr5Ta4O15. Furthermore, by modification with a 1 wt% NiO co-catalyst, both the photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) activities and stabilities of the composites were remarkably improved for the simultaneous evolution of H-2 and O-2 in a nearly stoichiometric ratio. The highest activity with a corresponding photon efficiency of up to 64% was achieved for NiO deposited on Sr2Ta2O7/SrTa4O11. The study on the feasibility of the strategy for fabricating homo-semiconductor composites will open up a direction to exploit new high-performance photocatalysts for hydrogen production and OWS.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000435659500003

The preferred substrates of the enzyme are 2-keto-4-hydroxy acids with a 4-carboxylate substitution. The enzyme also exhibits oxaloacetate decarboxylation and pyruvate alpha-proton exchange activity. Sodium oxalate is a competitive inhibitor of the aldolase reaction. The pH dependence of k(cat)/K-m and k(cat) for the enzyme is consistent with a single deprotonation with pK(a) values of 8.0 +/- 0.1 and 7.0 +/- 0.1 for free enzyme and enzyme substrate complex, respectively. The 1.8 angstrom x-ray structure shows a four-layered alpha-beta-beta-alpha sandwich structure with the active site at the interface of two adjacent subunits of a hexamer; this fold resembles the RNase E inhibitor, RraA, but is novel for an aldolase. The catalytic site contains a magnesium ion ligated by Asp-124 as well as three water molecules bound by Asp-102 and Glu-199'. A pyruvate molecule binds the magnesium ion through both carboxylate and keto oxygen atoms, completing the octahedral geometry. The carbonyl oxygen also forms hydrogen bonds with the guanadinium group of Arg-123, which site-directed mutagenesis confirms is essential for catalysis. A mechanism for HMG/CHA aldolase is proposed on the basis of the structure, kinetics, and previously established features of other aldolase mechanisms.									22	0	0	0	15	0	23			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000284146100024	20843800

Oxidation of CO using suitable catalysts is one of the methods to control it. By means of DFT calculations, single Cu atom doped in S vacancy of MoS2 nanosheet is studied for CO oxidation catalysis. Cu atom is strongly confined at the S-defective site of the MoS2 sheet, possessing high energy barrier for the diffusion to its neighboring sites. Adsorption energy, charge transfer and orbital hybridization of CO and O-2 molecules adsorbed Cu-doped MoS2 sheet reveal that O-2 is relatively more strongly adsorbed than CO. High adsorption energy of O-2 (- 2.115 eV) and large charge transfer between O-2 and Cu-MoS2 sheet (0.493e), compared to CO, make O-2 adsorption more favorable, which extenuates CO poisoning and hence helps in the efficient CO oxidation process. The complete oxidation of CO takes place in two steps: with activation energy of 0.201 eV, succeeded by without any energy barrier. Our results show that the basal plane of MoS2 sheet gets activated by embedding it with Cu metal, which can catalyze CO oxidation reaction effectively and without poisoning issues. The high activity, stability and low cost features can possibly encourage fabricating MoS2-based catalysts for CO oxidation reaction.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000430171400017

Rates of TCE reduction were determined as functions of the electrode potential and TCE concentration over a temperature range between 2 and 32 degrees C. Reduction of TCE resulted in production of acetate and chloride ions with no detectable intermediate products. At a current density of 15 mA/cm(2) and concentrations below 0.75 mM, reaction rates were first order with respect to TCE con centration, with surface area normalized rate constants 2 orders of magnitude greater than those for iron electrodes. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations were used to evaluate activation barriers for reduction by direct electron transfer, and for reaction with four functional groups commonly found on BDD surfaces. The DFT calculated activation barrier for direct electron transfer was more than 4 times greater than the experimentally measured value of 22 kJ/mol. In contrast, the DFT activation barrier for reaction at a deprotonated hydroxyl site on a tertiary carbon atom (equivalent to-C-O-) of 24 kJ/mol was in close agreement with the experimental value. Both experiments and quantum mechanical simulations support a TCE reduction mechanism that involves chemically adsorbed intermediates.									37	2	0	0	20	0	38			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000261678800056	19174914

The 12h thermal treatment at several temperatures (425, 500, 550 and 650 degrees C) in atmospheric conditions resulted in the swift transformation of the layered material into the tunnel-shaped octahedral molecular sieve cryptomelane (OMS-2: KMn8O16). The obtained materials were thoroughly characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, N-2-BET specific surface area analysis, and transmission electron microscopy techniques. With increasing temperature of thermal treatment, the concentration of OMS-2 increased, which was confirmed by Rietveld analysis, and dominated the material properties, notably the lowering of work function of the catalysts (=0.2 and 0.4eV in air and vacuum, respectively). The obtained results reveal the high catalytic activity of the OMS-2 formed from the thermal transformation of the OL material compared to both the parent OL material and the uncatalyzed soot oxidation reaction. The achieved catalytic activity showed direct correlation with the temperature of pre-treatment, with the most active catalyst being calcined at 550 degrees C/12h, and lowering the temperature of 50% soot conversion (T-50%) by spectacular 150 degrees C in loose contact. The catalytic activities were found to correlate well with the work function (low work function-high catalytic activity), confirming the electron transfer from the catalyst surface to oxygen molecule as the important step in the soot oxidation mechanism over mixed potassium-manganese oxides. The beneficial effect of thermal pre-treatment was found to last over multiple runs, maintaining a T-50% lower by 100 degrees C compared to the untreated parent material. The obtained results indicate the importance of the temperature treatment for the catalytic performance of potassium promoted transition metal oxides as catalytically active phases for efficient soot removal in the conditions present in combustion engine exhaust gases.[GRAPHICS].									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000470669800017

It is made on an industrial scale via the Haber-Bosch process, which requires high temperature and high pressure to consume a large amount of energy. It is very urgent to find an environmentally benign alternative process to alleviate the crises for energy and environment. Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has attracted worldwide research interest. However, such process is actually hard to perform due to the inherent inertness of N-2 molecules together with the low solubility in aqueous solutions. Although great research efforts have been made to explore and design suitable electrocatalysts for ammonia synthesis, the yield of ammonia is still very low. In addition, the ambiguous mechanism still remains as a major barrier for the development of NRR systems. In this review, we firstly introduced the catalytic reaction mechanisms towards NRR. Then we overviewed of the latest progress of the state-of-art catalysts in the electrocatalytic NRR. Moreover, we put more emphasis on the various rational strategies for electrocatalyst design to enhance the NRR performance, such as size effects, facets regulation, defects engineering, amorphization, which are aiming to increasing the exposed active sites or altering the electronic structure to further improve the apparent or intrinsic activity. Finally, we briefly discussed the main challenges in this field. We hope this review will offer a helpful guidance for the reasonable design of electrocatalysts towards NRR, arouse more interests in the new research field of NRR, and promote the green ammonia synthesis industrialization as soon as possible.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1005-281X			WOS:000700368200002

The fabrication of photoelectrodes from particulate material is especially desirable as a means of obtaining economically viable artificial photosynthetic systems. However, there have been no reports of efficient particulate semitransparent photoanodes applicable to tandem-type PEC cells. In this study, a particulate semitransparent photoanode composed of SrTiO3 (STO) powder anchored on a layer of titania nanosheets (TNSs) is demonstrated. The TNS layer functioned to anchor the particulate material and also served as a conductive layer. A tandem-type PEC cell combining a particulate semitransparent STO photoanode and a particulate Cu1.9Sn0.38Ge0.62S3 (CTGS) photocathode as the top and bottom cells, respectively, successfully performed overall water splitting without an external bias voltage under simulated sunlight. The present study provides a novel and versatile methodology for the fabrication of semitransparent photoanodes from particulate photocatalytic material.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000682962900001

Calculated variations in fluid Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and Sr-87/ Sr-86 with temperature within the upper sections of the ophiolite are similar to those from drilled oceanic crust, and yield literature values for late Cretaceous seawater Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and Sr-87/ Sr-86. This indicates that carbonates from ophiolites could be used to estimate the composition of ancient seawater at times before the age of the oldest preserved in-situ oceanic crust. Whereas most carbonates recovered from in-situ oceanic crust were precipitated at temperatures < 60 degrees C, abiogenic carbonates from the Troodos Ophiolite formed over a temperature range of 7 degrees C to 218 degrees C. These provide unique insights into the chemical and mineralogical processes that transform seawater into a high temperature hydrothermal fluid within the oceanic crust. We use 'hydrothermal variation diagrams' of Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, Sr-87/ Sr-86 and delta(44)/Ca-40 versus calculated temperature (delta O-18) to trace this fluid evolution within the Troodos oceanic crust. We find that successive fluid-crust-interaction, the precipitation of Mg- and Ca-bearing minerals and the early formation of anhydrite (> 44 degrees C) gradually transform Cretaceous seawater into a Troodos hydrothermal fluid. Comparison of the Troodos data with a global dataset of abiogenic carbonates from in-situ oceanic crust shows that the chemical pathways of low-temperature fluid evolution are similar for all Cretaceous sites. These different sites represent varied geotectonic settings (midocean ridge vs. suprasubduction zone), with different basement composition (basalt, basaltic andesite/boninite) and situated in different ocean basins (Atlantic, Pacific, Mediterranean [Tethys]). The similarity in the carbonate record indicates that these differences do not significantly influence seafloor weathering and hydrothermal alteration at low temperatures. However, abiogenic carbonates from younger oceanic crust differ from the Cretaceous trends and follow different fluid evolution pathways. This indicates, that temporal variations in the composition of seawater may control the nature and the extent of seafloor weathering and hydrothermal alteration at low temperatures. A thermodynamic model of fluid-crust interaction, in which modern and Cretaceous seawater are heated to 200 degrees C while an average Troodos basaltic andesite is successively added under otherwise identical conditions predicts that fluid evolution and alteration of the oceanic crust were different in the Cretaceous than they are today, and that initial seawater chemistry affects the nature and the extent of seafloor alteration up to moderate fluid temperatures. For example, twice the amount of carbonate formed during alteration of the oceanic crust in the Cretaceous compared to modern times, indicating that the flux of CO2 from the hydrosphere-atmosphere system into the oceanic crust was greater in the Cretaceous than it is nowadays, and that it probably varied throughout geologic time.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0009-2541	1872-6836		WOS:000441093900004

In this paper, two-dimensional (2D) CdS was synthesized by the hydrothermal method, and 2D CoP nanosheets were synthesized by successive hydrothermal, oxidation and phosphodation process. Then 2D-2D CdS-CoP photocatalysts were formed by ultrasonically dispersing the mixed solution of CdS and CoP, and their heterostructure was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, fluo- rescence spectrometer and so on. CdS-CoP with 2% CoP loading amounts exhibits a maximum photocatalytic performance of 56.3 mmolg(-1)h(-1) under visible light irradiation, which is 11.3 times as high as bare CdS. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of CdS-CoP should be due to the following two points: (1) high catalytic activity of CoP; (2) highly efficient separation and transfer of electron-hole pairs photogenerated in CdS due to the synthesized 2D-2D heterostructure.

Here, a tailored superhygroscopic hydrogel, a catalyst, and a solar cell are integrated into a humidity digester that can break down ambient moisture into hydrogen and oxygen, creating an efficient electrochemical cell. The function of the hydrogel is to harvest moisture from ambient humidity and transfer the collected water to the catalyst. Barium titanate and vertical 2D MoS2 nanosheets are integrated as the catalyst: the negatively polarized cathode can enhance the electron transport and attract H+ to the MoS2 surface for water reduction, while water oxidation takes place at the positively polarized anode. By employing this mechanism, it is possible to maintain the relative humidity in a medium-sized room at <60% without any additional energy input, and a stable current of 12.5 mA cm(-2) is generated by the humidity digester when exposed to ambient light.									33	1	0	0	2	0	33			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000529889800001	32363694

High-temperature drop solution calorimetry in molten 2PbO(.)B(2)O(3) at 702 degrees C was performed to determine their enthalpies of formation from oxides at room temperature. The enthalpy of oxidation involved in the reaction 2Fe(Fe)(x) + V-O(center dot center dot) + 0.5O(2)(g) = 2Fe(Fe)(center dot) + O-O(X) is independent of oxygen nonstoichiometry in each La1-xSrxFeO3-delta series with a given x, and further is approximately constant at -200 +/- 50 kJ/mol O-2 for 0 < x <= 0.5 and -140 +/- 30 kJ/mol O-2 for 0.5 < x < 1.0. The enthalpies of formation from oxides in the LaFeO3- SrFeO2.5 solid solution can be fitted either by a quadratic equation or by two straight line segments intersecting at x = 0.5. The quadratic fit gives a positive interaction parameter, 36.1 +/- 4.9 kJ/mol, suggesting a tendency toward phase separation. The two linear segment models two regions of oxygen vacancy presence: dilute (random distribution) for x <= 0.5 and concentrated (short-range ordering) for x > 0.5. Extrapolation to the end-member (x = 1) gives the enthalpy of formation of perovskite-type SrFeO2.5 and the enthalpy of the hypothetical brownmillerite-perovskite phase transition at room temperature is estimated as 5.5 +/- 4.0 kJ/mol. This small value implies extensive short-range order in the perovskite phases with high x. The enthalpies of formation from oxides in the LaFeO3-SrFeO3 solid solution are virtually independent of Sr composition when x <= 0.67 and are a few kJ/mol more exothermic when x >= 0.7. This is interpreted by phase evolutions from low symmetries to cubic.									65	0	0	0	0	0	65			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000228431700044

A copper treatment procedure in the synthesis steps results in a film of Cu--MnO2, which displays significant photoactivity when used as a photocathode for hydrogen evolution reaction, with a photocurrent of 3.59 mA cm(-2) (at 0 V vs. RHE) in a mild acidic solution. Furthermore, the electrodes also display significant electrocatalytic activity towards water oxidation reaching up to 10 mA cm(-2) (at only 1.67 V vs. RHE). The Cu--MnO2 film has been thoroughly characterized via various physicochemical, optical and electrochemical techniques, and an attempt has been made to explain the conductivity mechanism. It is suggested that Cu treatment enhances the photoactivity of -MnO2 films through a series of surface dominated processes, which facilitate reduced recombination and enhanced hole consumption at the interface of the electrode and electrolyte. These results establish birnessite-based manganese dioxides as suitable candidates for electrodes in water splitting cells and pave the way for atomic-level engineering of earth abundant materials to reach the ultimate goal of low-cost, sustainable generation of hydrogen.									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000438665100036	29971292

Herein, we present a facile two-step hydrothermal method for the synthesis of ultrathin atomic-vacancy-confined NiCr-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheet arrays (NiCr-LDH NSAs) to reduce solid-liquid interfacial tension, which leads to superior surface hydrophilicity and an extremely exposed catalytic active surface for highly-efficient water oxidation. The as-designed NiCr-LDH NSAs display an unexceptionable static contact angle of 17 degrees, which corresponds to a significant reduction of 50% compared to NiCr-LDH (33 degrees). As a result, the NiCr-LDH NSAs exhibits an ultra-low overpotential (h) of 182 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) and a high mass activity of 317.0 A g(Ni)(-1) at eta = 316 mV (200 mA cm(-2)), which is 20 times that of RuO2. By using X-ray absorption fine structure and operando synchrotron radiation infrared spectroscopies, we observe in experiment that the NiCr-LDH NSAs have numerous coordination-unsaturated NiO6-x active centers, which contributes to the effective adsorption of hydroxyl groups to form key *OOH intermediates and then accelerates four-electron reaction kinetics.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000667340200001

Nevertheless, the low operating voltage and rapid voltage drop of Li-Rich cathodes are seen as the fatal issues, which result in reduced energy density and degraded energy quality of the batteries, limiting their further commercial application. Herein, we focus on the local electronic structure controlled by chemical composition (to prepared high Ni content Li-rich cathode) to improve the operating voltage and suppress voltage decay. Through detailed physical characterization, electrochemical analysis and theoretical calculations, we summarize three main factors for improving the voltage of lithium-rich materials: 1) Increasing the O-Ni2+/3+/Li+ content effectively regulates the coordination environment of oxygen in Li-rich materials, realizes the regulation of local electronic structure; 2) the substitution of Ni increases the oxidation state of TM ions, especially for Mn, to keep charge balance, so as to improve the operating voltage and suppress voltage decay; 3) adjusting local electronic structure shifts the TM 3d-O 2p bands and the nonbonding O 2p band to lower energy, leading to an increase in the redox reaction potential. This strategy provides a method to regulate the coupling reaction of cation and anion redox in Li-rich cathodes by compositional design, so as to realize the regulation of voltage. Furthermore, when the as-prepared high Ni content electrode assembled with Si/C anode into a full-cell, impressive operating voltage (similar to 3.70 V) and long cycle life (72.29% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1C) can be achieved. Our work provides an efficient and up-scalable strategy for the preparation of electrodes with high voltage and high useful energy density, and making them a rather promising cathode candidate for Li ion batteries.									57	5	0	0	1	0	57			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000503062400022

The Co0.75Fe0.25OxHy NP, which are the most active electrocatalysts, have a layered double hydroxide (LDH) structure, with the average particle sizes about 16 nm. When using Ni foam as the substrate, the electrode with Co0.75Fe0.25OxHy NP as catalysts exhibited an overpotential of 284 mV for WOR in 1 M KOH at 10 mA cm(-2). The Tafel slope was 43 mV dec(-1), and the TOF was 1.30 s(-1) at 350 mV overpotential (loading Co + Fe = 0.133 mg cm(-2)). The Co0.75Fe0.25OxHy NP are robust toward long-term galvanostatic test and showed less than 2% dissolution in 10 hours. Preliminary kinetic study suggests that the presence of Fe in Co1-zFezOxHy NP alters the WOR mechanistic pathways. The increased number of electrochemically active sites endowed by the LDH structure and the electronic interactions between Co and Fe as suggested by XPS, both contribute to the enhanced WOR activity.									10	1	0	0	3	0	11			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000531181000001

The vein swarm extends over an area of 3 km(2) parallel to a mylonitic belt and formed in fractured granodiorite. Thicknesses of veins are less than 0.5 m and their visible strike length is less than 100 m. Veins are either barren or weakly mineralized in base-metal sulfides. Most veins have mineral associations dominated by calcite and quartz with lesser amounts of chlorite, sericite, pyrite, and minor illite. In other less exposed albite-rich, adularia-bearing veins, chalcopyrite, bornite, galena, sphalerite, chalcocite and covellite may occur. The widespread occurrence of bladed calcite without any petrographic or microthermometric evidence of boiling implies that this particular habit of calcite may also develop under sub-near boiling fluid conditions. Thermometric calculations based on fluid inclusion data, chlorite composition and oxygen isotopes in the quartz-calcite pair, constrain the formation of the system between 300 and similar to 350 degrees C, at pressures between 42 and 64 MPa (1.5-2.3 km). Stable isotope data suggest that W/R interaction might have been the most probable mechanism of alteration, involving the participation of meteoric fluids; nevertheless, the metallic signature of some weakly mineralized veins as well as intermediate fluid inclusion salinities favor a magmatic input and a mixed origin for the fluids. Textures and mineral associations, as well as the absence of evidence of boiling in fluid inclusions, all suggest that the silica-carbonate vein system formed deeper than typically shallow Au and Ag-bearing boiling solutions. A 485 (+/- 25) Ma lamprophyre dike crosscuts some of these veins locally producing metasomatic reactions and skarn formation, which constrains the age of the hydrothermal system to the Cambrian-Early Ordovician time span.

Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used to monitor the ion release into solution, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to unveil the chemistry of the leached surface, and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) was carried out to monitor the structural modifications of the fibres. No significant differences were observed between dissolution experiments carried out with and without H2O2 with the exception of results after the first hour, from which it may be inferred that the dissolution proceeds faster in the presence of H2O2 but only in its very early steps. Congruent mobilization of Si and Mg from crocidolite was observed, increasing with time especially in the range between 1 and 48 h, while Ca decreased after 48 h and Fe was not detected at any incubation time. In the undersaturated conditions (0-48 h), dissolution rate of UICC crocidolite fibres has been estimated to be d(Si)/dt = 0.079 mu mol h(-1). The fibre surface modification is continuous with time: XPS results showed a regular depletion of Si and Mg and enrichment of Fe along dissolution. The Fe2p(3/2) signal on the surface was fitted with four components at 709.0, 710.5, 711.6 and 712.8 eV binding energy values corresponding to: (i) Fe(II)-O and (ii) Fe(III)-O surrounded by oxygen atoms in the silicate structure, (iii) Fe(III)-OOH as a product of the dissolution process, and (iv) Fe in a phosphate precipitate (Fe-P), respectively. The evolution of Fe speciation on the crocidolite surface was followed by integrating the four photoemission peaks, and results showed that the oxidative environment promotes the formation of Fe(III)-O (up to 37% Fe-tot) and of Fe-P species (up to 16% Fe-tot), which are found on the fibre surface at the end of the dissolution experiment. HR-TEM showed that the crocidolite lattice structure, the fibrous habit and the high aspect ratio are preserved upon leaching, while Fe-bearing nanoparticles, likely amorphous and possibly displaced on top of the fibres, become clearly visible. As a conclusion, coating of the crocidolite fibres was demonstrated to occur due to precipitation of Fe-rich phases (both phosphates and oxide-hydroxides). The occurrence of such iron armouring may modulate asbestos toxicity and possibly be the initial step in the formation of asbestos ferruginous bodies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the geometrical structure, thermodynamic stability, chemical activity, electronic and magnetic properties, and catalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of 13- and 55-atom Pd, Au NPs, and Pd-Au CSNPs were systematically investigated using density functional theory calculations. The results showed that Au atoms prefer to segregate to the surface-shell, while Pd atoms were inclined to aggregate in the core region for bimetallic Pd-Au CSNPs; therefore, Pd @Au CSNPs with an Au surface-shell were thermodynamically more favorable than both the monometallic Pd/Au NPs and the Au@Pd CSNPs with a Pd surface-shell. The Pd surface-shell of the Au@Pd CSNPs displayed a positive charge, while the Au surface-shell of the Au@Pd CSNPs exhibited a negative charge due to the charge transfer in the Pd-Au CSNPs, resulting in that the d-band center of Au@Pd with the Pd surface-shell showed larger shift toward the Fermi level and higher chemical activity. The Pd@Au CSNPs with the Au surface-shell showed similar d-band curves and d-band centers with monometallic Au NPs. All 13-atom Pd, Au NPs, and Pd-Au CSNPs were magnetic, while the 55-atom NPs were non-magnetic with symmetry partial density of states' curves except for Pd55. Changing the location of Pd and Au atoms in the Pd-Au CSNPs influenced their total magnetic moments. In addition, an opposite trend was found: small 13-atom NPs with a Pd surface-shell showed superior HER activity to the ones with an Au surface-shell, while large 55-atom NPs with an Au surface-shell possessed higher HER activity than the ones with a Pd surface-shell.

Using first principles calculations, we firstly study water splitting catalyzed by metal based biomolecule porphyrin (MPP) (M = Mg, Ba, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn). Among all the systems, after releasing electron, TiPP is the most effective catalyst for H2O splitting. TiPP and the remainder O atom form the very stable structure OTiPP. The H-2-O + OTiPP can release electron with the 6.76 eV potential barrier. The releasing electron process of porphyrin can be easily realized under the effect of solar energy by experiment study. After releasing electron, OTiPP can effectively catalyze the dissociation of H+ from H2O in an exothermic process. The desorption of O atom is an endothermic process with 0.72 eV barrier. The H2O + OTiPP system can readily return to its original state OTiPP, in other word, the OTiPP can be a sustainable cycling catalyst for water splitting under the effect of potential barrier transfer. The whole catalytic process is remarkable clean without any pollution. This method may open up new avenues for the development of future clean energy and extraordinary biomimetic photosynthesizers.

J	Signoretto, Caterina; Bianchi, Franco; Burlacchini, Gloria; Canepari, Pietro								Microbiological evaluation of the effects of hyperbaric oxygen on periodontal disease								NEW MICROBIOLOGICA				30	4			431	437						OCT 2007	2007	The term periodontitis indicates a variety of clinical manifestations of infectious disorders in which the supporting tissues of the teeth are attacked. The initiation and progression of periodontal disease are attributed to the presence of elevated levels of pathogenic bacteria within the gingival crevice. Approaches to periodontal treatment range from surgical to regenerative therapy and anti-infective chemotherapy. Anti-infective drug therapy should be rationally based on the composition of the pathogenic microbiota. It is also important to recognize that the periodontopathic plaque constitutes a bacterial biofilm infection that may render the resident microorganisms more resistant than the same organisms grown planktonically, Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) has been successfully used in several medical applications. The therapeutic effect is related to elevated partial oxygen pressure in the tissues. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of HBO on a selected number of patients suffering from adult chronic periodontitis in comparison with surgical intervention (scaling and root planning, SRP), as well as the effects of a combination of both therapies on the evolution over time of the microflora of the periodontal pockets. Bacteria were detected either by culture or by a molecular method (PCR). Microbiological data indicate that the combination of HBO and SRP substantially reduced (by up to 99.9%) the gram-negative anaerobe loads of the subgingival microflora. The low values of pathogens persisted for at least two months after the therapy HBO or SRP alone produced a temporarily more limited effect on periodontal anaerobes. Additional experimental confirmation of these results was provided by molecular detection of the main periodontopathogenic bacteria with a significant reduction in the number of dental sites which harboured them. It is also shown that HBO both alone and in combination with SRP reduced the Gingival Index value to zero and gingival health persisted for 3 months at least. Thus, in parallel with the loss of periodontopathogenic bacteria, a substantial improvement in oral health was observed. in conclusion, this study has shown that HBO may represent a useful aid, especially in combination with SRP, as far as non-surgical periodontal therapy is concerned.									7	1	0	0	4	0	8			1121-7138			WOS:000251225500009	18080679

In this method, well distributed Ni(NH3)(n)IrCl6 complexes are formed and adsorbed on the carbon support: after thermal annealing, highly dispersed IrNi nanoparticles are obtained by in situ reduction of the corresponding complexes. By varying the preparation conditions, IrNi/C samples with the lattice parameter of Ir controlled in the range from 3.8416 angstrom to 3.6649 angstrom are prepared. The hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) of the IrNi/C exhibits volcano-shaped dependence on the lattice parameter of Ir with a maximum activity at 3.7325 angstrom. The mass activity of the as-synthesized catalysts is higher than or comparable to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts in the three-electrode test and single cell test. The high activity is ascribed to the optimal interaction between the catalyst surface and the hydrogen intermediates, and to the high specific electrochemical activity surface area resulting from the novel SE-HR method.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000337856900022

In this article, we have used three chloroacetates (monochloroacetate, MCA; dichloroacetate, DCA; and trichloroacetate, TCA), having different geometry and hydrophobicity, to probe the binding environment of the two-electron gate in spinach thylakoids. We first established that these chloroacetates up to 100 mM act specifically in the Q(A)Q(B) region by monitoring partial reactions of PSII as well as PSI, measuring thermoluminescence, specific for recombination reactions between the donor and acceptor sides of PSII, and studying chlorophyll (Chi) a fluorescence decay in the micro to millisecond region, specific for electron flow from Q(A)(-) to Q(B) (Q(B)(-)). Further, the site of action was located on the D1-D2 protein through observations on the differential sensitivity of chloroacetates on specific D1-D2 mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.Detailed measurements were then done to characterize the effect of chloroacetates on Q(A)Q(B) reactions. Data on the [Q(A)(-)] decay kinetics led to the following observations: (1) chloroacetates (and acetate) not only increase the time constant of electron flow from Q(A)(-) to Q(B)(Q(B)(-)), but increase the equilibrium [Q(A)(-)] both after flash 1 and 2, and the degree of these effects (lowest to highest) is correlated with the geometry (increased number of chlorine moiety) and increased hydrophobicity of these inhibitors; the hierarchy is: acetate < TCA. (2) In comparison with flash 1, data after flash 2 (at pH 6) show relatively larger increases in [Q(A)(-)] equilibrium with DCA and TCA. At pH 7.5, however, flash 1 effects were larger than flash 2 effects with all chloroacetates. (3) Bicarbonate reverses the inhibitory effect on Q(A)(-) to Q(B)(Q(B)(-)) reactions also in a differential manner; the hierarchy for the most reversible (or least irreversible) is: acetate greater than or similar to MCA > DCA > > TCA. (4) The pH dependence of the inhibitory effects on Q(A)(-) to Q(B)(Q(B)(-)) are: the MCA and DCA effects are larger at pH 6 than at pH 7.5, but the TCA effects are higher at pH 7.5 than at pH 6. The above results, taken together with those in the literature, are in agreement with a picture of the Q(A)-Fe-Q(B) niche in the D1-D2 protein of PS II where quinones, herbicides, chloroacetates, formate as web as bicarbonate bind, but differently with different overlapping sites. Chloroacetates show effects on the two-electron gate that place them 'in-between' the herbicides and the bicarbonate-reversible formate.									13	0	0	0	13	0	13			1011-1344			WOS:A1997WH17600015		
J	Xin, YY; Yu, F; Tang, CQ; Li, LB; Kuang, TY								Purification and spectral characteristics of cytochrome b-559 from oxygen-evolving photosystem II core complexes of spinach and rice								ACTA BOTANICA SINICA				42	12			1225	1230						DEC 2000	2000	Cytochrome b-559 in photosystem II reaction center was purified from spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) by a rapid and simple procedure. Their low temperature fluorescence emission and excitation spectra, ultraviolet fluorescence spectra and absolute absorption spectra were presented. The author's purification methods, which enhanced the yield of pure protein and shorted the time for isolation, have several advantages: 1. use of oxygen-evolving PS IT core complexes as the starting material in order to avoid disturbing from other cytochromes; 2. isocratic elution of cytochrome b-559 from a DEAE-Sephacel column for eliminating the impurity and yielding the protein in pure state; 3. a simple column procedure for removal of excess Triton X-100. Purified cytochromes b-559 from these species have similar optical spectra and mobility during gel. electrophoresis under native conditions. From the results of novel electrophoresis (Tricine-SDS-PAGE), cytochrome b-559 from both spinach and rice reveal two polypeptide bands (apparent molecular weight 9 kD and 4 kD, respectively). By measuring of 77 K fluorescence spectra, it was shown that for the purified cytochrome b-559 there were two excitation peaks at 439 nm and 413 nm, and two emission peaks at 563 nm and 668 nm. This is the first indication that Cyt b-559 is able to emit fluorescence and also transfer excited electrons to chlorophyll. By the use of ultraviolet fluorescence spectra, it was demonstrated for the first time that the location of Trp residue could be in the hydrophobic transmembrane region of cytochrome b-559.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0577-7496	1672-9072		WOS:000166156800004

However, the complete release of their catalytic activities is restricted by their inert basal planes. Although the inert base planes of 2H-MoS2 are known to be activated by atomic doping, the operational principle of the exotic atoms remains vague. In this study, the unutilized inert base sites of MoS2 were activated via an oxygen-aided P-substituted method (denoted as POMS). Molecular structural tests and analyses of POMS indicated that the inert MoS2 substrate is activated when the inerratic crystal phases transform to amorphous phases in the P-doping process. The fully activated inert base planes provide sufficient reaction sites for photo-oxidized water contaminants. The designed POMS presented superior activity in organic degradation and completely removed sulf-amethoxazole within 20 min. Uncovering these operational principles provides a theoretical basis for designing effective catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000687172000065	34342423

In this study, a filled-bed electrochemical system with waste iron filings (IFES) was constructed to enhance the removal efficiency of total nitrogen (TN) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) as well as inhibition of the accumulation of the organochlorine by-products. Biologically treated landfill leachate (BTLL) was selected as a typical NCOW source to evaluate the performance of IFES. Cyclic voltammetry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and potentiometric analysis showed that due to the polarization effect of iron filings and the environment with low redox potential was created by the evolution of iron compounds, IFES could significantly improve the current efficiency of TN removal. Electron paramagnetic resonance analysis revealed that the reaction of low binding energy iron compounds dissolved from the polarization process of iron filings with available chlorine could promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals and can enhance the removal efficiency of COD. It was also proved that the accumulation of organochlorine could also be reduced by the reduction process of Fe-0/Fe2+, and by the iron filings polarized cathode. Besides, compared with the traditional electrochemical oxidation process, IFES can significantly decrease the energy consumption of BTLL treatment under the same treatment effect, which was conducive to reducing the engineering costs caused by the power loss. The IFES was proved to be a feasible alternative for the modification of existing electrochemical oxidation practical engineering.									4	1	0	0	3	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000504405000056

Here, WOR electrocatalysis by 1.6 nm IrOx nanoparticles (NPs) electrophoretically deposited onto spectroscopic graphite (Gr) and basal plane highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) was studied as a function of NPs' capping ligands and electrodeposition substrate. On Gr, OH-- and H2O-capped NPs exhibited close sub-monolayer surface coverages and specific electrocatalytic activity of 18.9-23.5 mA nmol(-1) of Ir-IV/V sites, at 1 V and pH 7. On HOPG, OH--capped NPs produced films with a diminished WOR activity of 5.17 +/- 2.40 mA nmol(-1). Electro-wettability-induced changes impeded electrophoretic deposition of H2O-capped NPs on HOPG, WOR currents being 25-fold lower than observed for OH--capped ones. The electrocatalysis efficiency correlated with hydrophilic properties of the substrate electrodes, affecting morphological and as a result catalytic properties of the formed IrOx films. These results, important both for studied and related carbon nanomaterials systems, allow fine-tuning of electrocatalysis by a proper choice of the substrate electrode.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000664219100012

We investigate the application of NH- and CH-substituted ureas, namely, carbohydrazide, semicarbazide, N-methylurea, and tetramethylurea as design elements/motifs in the tailored synthesis of WO3-x nanostructures via direct calcination of tungstic acid-substituted urea hybrid gels. The SEM, HRTEM, SAED, XRD, XPS, and TG-DTA studies reveal that NH-substitution in urea induces a profound growth of WO3-x one-dimensional (1D) nanorods, preferentially growing along the (002) plane with enhancement in the percentage of oxygen vacancies. On the contrary, with the increase in CH-substitution in urea, the tendency to form 1D nanorods via self-assembly process decreases, possibly due to an increase in the steric effect of the methyl groups. We further demonstrate the corresponding effect of morphological and chemical changes in WO3-x nanostructure on their improved electrified interfacial processes via H+ intercalation using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests, and chronoamperometric studies. Our findings reveal that the enhancement in WO3-x nanorod growth, W5+/W6+ redox surface states, and abundance of (002) surface plane due to NH-substitution in urea play a crucial role in facilitating the diffusion process of H+/e(-) in and out of the WO3-x matrix. An area specific capacitance of 132 mF cm(-2) at the current density of 1 mA cm(-2) with excellent capacitance retention is reported. Moreover, significant improvements in the charge discharge times were observed, the highest being the one for WO3-x nanorods obtained using carbohydrazide, demonstrating its potential for possible application in designing 1D nanomaterials for energy storage systems.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2574-0962			WOS:000504953500044

Nevertheless, the serious charge recombination at the back contact and photoelectrode/electrolyte interface severely hinders its PEC activity. Herein, a facile magnetron ion-sputtering strategy is adopted to fabricate TiO2 underlayer and NiO overlayer to modify both sides of CdIn2S4 photoanode. The TiO2 underlayer serves as an electron transport layer to promote electrons transfer from CdIn2S4 to fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate and hinder holes' transportation, thus suppressing the charge recombination at the back contact. NiO, as a p-type semiconductor, forms a p-n heterojunction with CdIn2S4, inducing a built-in electric field to facilitate charge transport. Meanwhile, NiO overlayer acts as a co-catalyst to enhance surface reaction kinetics, and thereby improves the carrier injection efficiency at photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. As a result, the optimum TiO2/CdIn2S4/NiO photoanode exhibits photocurrent as high as 0.6 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is about 2.3 times that of bare CdIn2S4. This work provides an effective strategy to manipulate the charge carrier dynamics to improve the PEC activity of photoanode.									6	2	0	0	0	0	7			2196-7350			WOS:000522133700003		
J	Katuri, Akhil; Bryant, Joseph; Heredia, Alonso; Makar, Tapas K.								Role of the inflammasomes in HIV-associated neuroinflammation and neurocognitive disorders								EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY				108				64	72		10.1016/j.yexmp.2019.03.008				JUN 2019	2019	HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) is a unique form of neurological impairment that stems from HIV. This disease and its characteristics can be accredited to incorporation of DNA and mRNA of HIV-1 into the CNS. A proper understanding of the intricacies of HAND and the underlying mechanisms associated with corresponding immune reactions are vital for the potential development of a reliable treatment for HAND.A common phenomenon observed in CNS cells, specifically microglia, that are infected with HAND is inflammation, which is a consequence of the activation of innate immune response due to a variety of stimuli, in this case, being the HIV infection. The CNS based inflammation is mediated by the production of cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species, and secondary messengers, which occurs at CNS glia, endothelial cells and peripherally derived immune cells.Inflammasomes play a significant role with regard to neuroinflammation due to their ability to dictate the activation of various inflammatory responses. Certain stimuli can result in the activation of caspase-1; hence, leading to the processing of interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-18 pro-inflammatory cytokines. The processed IL-1 beta and IL-18 activate signaling pathways that begin the process of neuroinflammation. Due to the fact that the NLRP3 inflammasome is the most abundant in the CNS, it is the most extensively investigated inflammasome with regard to the nervous system.Due to the importance of neuroinflammation in the evolution of HAND and proliferation of neuroinflammation due to HAND, it can be concluded that there exists a relationship between HAND and inflammasomes. The aim of our review is to consolidate current knowledge of important mechanisms in HAND, specifically related to its relationship with neuroinflammation and inflammasomes to shed light on a possible improved treatment for HAND.									24	0	0	0	21	0	24			0014-4800	1096-0945		WOS:000469523800008	30922769

This brief review summarizes the progress of cocatalysts in the last 3 years. The effects of intrinsic characters of cocatalysts including morphology, crystallization, and composition are first examined. The influence of interfacial coupling of cocatalysts with host photocatalysts, such as cocatalyst location, built-in electric field, and contact manner, is subsequently discussed. To confirm the active species of cocatalysts, some in situ/operando characterization techniques are finally introduced. It is expected that this brief review would provide useful information to design efficient cocatalysts for photocatalytic water splitting.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			2452-2236			WOS:000471284100005

From these experiences we conclude, that multijunction devices must be developed for bias-free water splitting. In this article we present our design considerations needed for the development of efficient photoelectro- synthetic cells, which have guided us during the DFG priority program 1613. At first, we discuss the fundamental requirements, which must be fulfilled to lead to effective solar water splitting devices. Buried junction and photoelectrochemical arrangements are compared. It will become clear, that the photovoltaic (PV) and electrochemical (EC) components can be optimized separately, but that maximized conversion efficiencies need photovoltages produced in the photovoltaic part of the device, which are adapted to the electrochemical performance of the electrolyzer components without energetic losses in their coupling across the involved interfaces. Therefore, in part 2 we will present the needs to develop appropriate interface engineering layers for proper chemical and electronic surface passivation. In addition, highly efficient electrocatalysts, either for the hydrogen or oxygen evolution reaction (HER, OER), must be adjusted in their energetic coupling to the semiconductor band edges and to the redox potentials in the electrolyte with minimized losses in the chemical potentials. The third part of our paper describes at first the demands and achievements on developing multijunction thin-film silicon solar cells. With different arrangements of silicon stacks a wide range of photovoltages and photocurrents can be provided. These solar cells are applied as photocathodes in integrated directly coupled PV-EC devices. For this purpose thin Pt and Ni catalyst layers are used on top of the solar cells for the HER and a wire connected RuO2 counter electrode is used for the OER. Electrochemical stability has been successfully tested for up to 10,000 s in 0.1 M KOH. Furthermore, we will illustrate our experimental results on interface engineering strategies using TiO2 as buffer layer and Pt nanostructures as HER catalyst. Based on the obtained results the observed improvements, but also the still given limitations, can be related to clearly identified non-idealities in surface engineering either related to recombination losses at the semiconductor surface reducing photocurrents or due to not properly-aligned energy states leading to potential losses across the interfaces.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0942-9352			WOS:000528279600002

In this Focused Review, we describe the application of ArMs as simple, tunable artificial models of the active sites of complex natural metalloenzymes for small-molecule activation. In this sense, ArMs expand the strategies of synthetic model chemistry to protein-based supporting ligands with potential for participation from the second coordination sphere. We focus specifically on ArMs that are structural, spectroscopic, and functional models of enzymes for activation of small molecules like CO, CO2, O2, N2, and NO, as well as production/consumption of H2. These ArMs give insight into the identities and roles of metalloenzyme structural features within and near the cofactor. We give examples of ArM work relevant to hydrogenases, acetyl-coenzyme A synthase, superoxide dismutase, heme oxygenases, nitric oxide reductase, methyl-coenzyme M reductase, copper-O2 enzymes, and nitrogenases.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0162-0134	1873-3344		WOS:000649653400005	33873051

The effect of ply angle on oxygen diffusivity and the influence of ply stacking sequence on oxidation behavior of isothermally aged multidirectional composites are discussed by correlating experimental observations and a three-dimensional oxidation model. Experimental observations of oxidation growth are made using dark-field optical microscopy, while damage initiation and growth is detected using fluorescence imaging with dye impregnation. Oxidation growth in laminated systems is simulated using a diffusion-reaction-conversion model developed earlier for resin oxidation along with homogenization techniques. Several stacking sequences of carbon fiber-reinforced polyimide composites are studied. The effects of the orthotropy in the diffusivity tensors of each ply and the influence of neighboring ply on oxidation growth are clearly illustrated. The simulation results presented in this article are valid till the onset of damage, beyond which coupling effects between oxidation growth and damage evolution have to be addressed.									12	1	0	0	0	0	14			0021-9983			WOS:000287531600002

Additional waters from active and inactive mines in the BMC were also collected. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of surface and shallow groundwaters from both the Halfimle Lake and Restigouche deposits are remarkably uniform (-13 to -14 parts per thousand and -85 to -95 parts per thousand for delta O-18(VSMOW) and delta H-2(VSMOW), respectively). These values are lighter than predicted for northern New Brunswick and, combined with elevated deuterium excess values, suggest that recharge waters are dominated by winter precipitation, recharged during spring melting. Deeper groundwaters from the Restigouche deposit, and from active and inactive mines have heavier delta O-18(VSMOW) ratios (up to -10.8 parts per thousand) than shallow groundwaters suggesting recharge under warmer climate or mixing with Shield-type brines. Some of the co-variation in Cl concentrations and delta O-18(VSMOW) ratios can be explained by mixing between saline and shallow recharge water end-members. Carbon isotopic compositions of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are variable, ranging from -15 to -5 parts per thousand delta C-13(VPDB) for most ground and surface waters. Much of the variation in the carbon isotopes is consistent with closed system groundwater evolution involving soil zone CO2 and fracture zone carbonate minerals (calcite, dolomite and siderite; average = -6.5 parts per thousand delta C-13(VPDB)). The DIC of saline Restigouche deposit groundwater is isotopically heavy (similar to+12 parts per thousand delta C-13(VPDB)), indicating carbon isotopic fractionation from methanogenesis via CO2 reduction, consistent with the lack of dissolved sulfate in these waters and the observation of CH4-degassing during sampling.

Herein, we report the non-noble metal bifunctional g-C3N4/CN/CoP catalysts in situ formed for both photocatalytic and electrocatalytic hydrogen production through a convenient phosphorization process. It was found that the optimal g-C3N4(90)/ CN300/CoP3 composite not only had the best photocatalytic hydrogen production rate (29.78 mmol.g(-1).h(-1)) in the dye sensitization system, but also had an excellent electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, with an overpotential of 221 mV at 10 mAmiddotcm-2. The XRD, FT-IR, TG, et al. confirm the close contact between ZIFCo and g-C3N4 in the ideal g-C3N4/ZIF-Co precursor could expediently achieve the uniformly distributed CoP to accelerate electron transfer and reduce the recombination rate of charge. This work can provide a novel strategy to fabricate non-noble metal dual-functional materials for photocatalytic and electrocatalytic hydrogen production to solve energy crises and environmental further.

We herein report the fabrication of novel metal-organic framework (MOF)/g-C3N4 heterostructured materials with well-defined micro-/nanostructures and intimate interfacial contact. Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) nanoparticles are found to be evenly anchored on modified rod-like g-C3N4 materials. The resultant hybrid materials demonstrate the integration of two components and show enhanced light-harvesting property in the visible light region. ZIF-8/g-C3N4 composite materials have been employed as the catalysts for solar-driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting. Under light emitting diode (LED) illumination, ZIF-8/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts exhibit significant hydrogen-evolving performance in comparison to bulk ZIF-8 material. The enhanced hydrogen production efficiency can be ascribed to synergistic improvements in electron-hole separation, charge transportation and redox capability. This synthetic strategy can be extended to the design and controllable synthesis of a variety of MOF-based composite materials for energy and environmental applications.									83	11	0	0	9	0	88			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000438578700048

Although many intriguing emergent phenomena, novel physical properties and functionalities have been obtained, the gating mechanism governing the ion and charge transport remains unexplored. Here, by using the model system of brownmillerite SrCoO2.5 and the corresponding electric-field controlled tri-state phase transformation among the pristine SrCoO2.5, hydrogenated HSrCoO2.5 and oxidized perovskite SrCoO3-delta through the dual ion switch, the ionic diffusion and electronic transport processes were carefully investigated. Through controlling gating experiment by design, we find out that the collaborative interaction between charge transport and ion diffusion plays an essential role to prompt the hydrogen or oxygen ions incorporate into the crystal lattice of SrCoO2.5, and therefore leading to formation of new phases. At region closer to the electrode, the electron can shuttle more readily in (out) the material, correspondingly the incorporation of hydrogen (oxygen) ions and phase transformation is largely affiliated. With the compensated charge of electron as well as the reaction front gradually moving away from the electrode, the new phases would be developed successively across the entire thin film. This result unveils the underlying mechanism in the electric-field control of ionic incorporation and extraction, and therefore provides important strategy to achieve high efficient design of material functionalities in complex oxide materials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000616793100001	33570048

Solar XUV and ENA-driven water loss from early Venus' steam atmosphere [arXiv]								arXiv								29 pp.	29 pp.						6 Nov. 2019	2019	The influence of the hydrogen hydrodynamic upper atmosphere escape, driven by the solar soft X-ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation (XUV) flux, on an expected magma ocean outgassed steam atmosphere of early Venus is studied. By assuming that the young Sun was either a weak or moderate active young G star, we estimated the water loss from a hydrogen dominated thermosphere due to the absorption of the solar XUV flux and the precipitation of solar wind produced energetic hydrogen atoms (ENAs). The production of ENAs and their interaction with the hydrodynamic extended upper atmosphere, including collision-related feedback processes, have been calculated by means of Monte Carlo models. ENAs that collide in the upper atmosphere deposit their energy and heat the surrounding gas mainly above the main XUV energy deposition layer. It is shown that precipitating ENAs modify the thermal structure of the upper atmosphere, but the enhancement of the thermal escape rates caused by these energetic hydrogen atoms is negligible. Our results also indicate that the majority of oxygen arising from dissociated H2O molecules is left behind during the first 100 Myr. It is thus suggested that the main part of the remaining oxygen has been absorbed by crustal oxidation. [Lichtenegger, H. I. M., et al.

One of the bottlenecks for water splitting is the availability of an efficient and stable water-oxidizing catalyst. Herein, metallic cobalt foil, after the treatment under high potential (10-60.0 V), was used for water oxidation. The cobalt/ cobalt oxide surface was characterized by various spectroscopic, microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical methods. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy showed peaks for Co oxide at 489 and 595 cm(-1) attributed to the stretching of Co-O and bending of O-Co-O bonds in the CoO6 octahedra. Small aggregated particles (ca. 50-100 nm) with a spherical morphology were detected by scanning electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy from the mechanically separated particles indicated spacings of 2.5-2.6 angstrom corresponding to the interplanar spacings of the (011) plane for Co3O4. Selected area (electron) diffraction showed concentric rings centered on a bright central spot, indicating a polycrystalline material. Each ring is related to planes of different orientation and different interplanar spacing, attributed to metallic cobalt and cobalt oxides. X-ray diffraction resulted in patterns corresponding to Co3O4 and CoO(OH), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy could confirm the formation of metallic cobalt, Co(II) and Co(III) oxides on the surface of the electrode. These results suggest that the oxide on the surface of foil could be a mixture of different phases of Co oxide containing Co3O4 and CoO(OH). Under overpotentials of 460 and 780 mV, current densities of 0.144 and 0.5 A/cm(2) were observed at pH-14 without dropping of IR. To the best of our knowledge, the three-dimensional electrode obtained here is among the most efficient cobalt-based water-oxidizing electrodes under alkaline conditions reported so far and may be applied in large scale water-splitting systems.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			2168-0485			WOS:000461978200054

This is exemplified by the 'energy-dependent' form of non-photochemical quenching (q(E)), the formation and decay of which can be considerably slower than natural light fluctuations, limiting photochemical yield. In addition, we recently reported that rapidly fluctuating light can produce field recombination-induced photodamage (FRIP), where large spikes in electric field across the thylakoid membrane (Delta psi) induce photosystem II recombination reactions that produce damaging singlet oxygen (O-1(2)). Both q(E) and FRIP are directly linked to the thylakoid proton motive force (pmf), and in particular, the slow kinetics of partitioning pmf into its Delta pH and Delta psi components. Using a series of computational simulations, we explored the possibility of 'hacking' pmf partitioning as a target for improving photosynthesis. Under a range of illumination conditions, increasing the rate of counter-ion fluxes across the thylakoid membrane should lead to more rapid dissipation of Delta psi and formation of Delta pH. This would result in increased rates for the formation and decay of q(E) while resulting in a more rapid decline in the amplitudes of Delta psi-spikes and decreasing O-1(2) production. These results suggest that ion fluxes may be a viable target for plant breeding or engineering. However, these changes also induce transient, but substantial mismatches in the ATP : NADPH output ratio as well as in the osmotic balance between the lumen and stroma, either of which may explain why evolution has not already accelerated thylakoid ion fluxes. Overall, though the model is simplified, it recapitulates many of the responses seen in vivo, while spotlighting critical aspects of the complex interactions between pmf components and photosynthetic processes. By making the programme available, we hope to enable the community of photosynthesis researchers to further explore and test specific hypotheses.This article is part of the themed issue 'Enhancing photosynthesis in crop plants: targets for improvement'.									36	2	1	0	34	0	37			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000407717300007	28808100

Visual perception and imagery: A new molecular hypothesis								BIOSYSTEMS				96	2			178	184		10.1016/j.biosystems.2009.01.005				MAY 2009	2009	Here, we put forward a redox molecular hypothesis about the natural biophysical substrate of visual perception and visual imagery. This hypothesis is based on the redox and bioluminescent processes of neuronal cells in retinotopically organized cytochrome oxidase-rich visual areas. Our hypothesis is in line with the functional roles of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in living cells that are not part of haphazard process, but rather a very strict mechanism used in signaling pathways. We point out that there is a direct relationship between neuronal activity and the biophoton emission process in the brain. Electrical and biochemical processes in the brain represent sensory information from the external world. During encoding or retrieval of information. electrical signals of neurons can be converted into synchronized biophoton signals by bioluminescent radical and non-radical processes. Therefore, information in the brain appears not only as an electrical (chemical) signal but also as a regulated biophoton (weak optical) signal inside neurons.During visual perception, the topological distribution of photon stimuli on the retina is represented by electrical neuronal activity in retinotopically organized visual areas. These retinotopic electrical signals in visual neurons can be converted into synchronized biophoton signals by radical and non-radical processes in retinotopically organized mitochondria-rich areas. As a result, regulated bioluminescent bio-photons can create intrinsic pictures (depictive representation) in retinotopically organized cytochrome oxidase-rich visual areas during visual imagery and visual perception. The long-term visual memory is interpreted as epigenetic information regulated by free radicals and redox processes. This hypothesis does not claim to solve the secret of consciousness, but proposes that the evolution of higher levels of complexity made the intrinsic picture representation of the external visual world possible by regulated redox and bioluminescent reactions in the visual system during visual perception and visual imagery.

Data from a crude-oil spill research site near Bemidji, MN provide an ideal test case for investigating the complex interactions controlling secondary impacts, including depleted dissolved oxygen and elevated organic carbon, inorganic carbon, CH4, Mn, Fe, and other dissolved ions. To better understand these secondary impacts, this study began with an extensive data compilation of various data types, comprising aqueous, sediment, gas, and oil phases, covering a 260 m cross-sectional domain over 30 years. Mass balance calculations are used to quantify pathways that control secondary components, by using the data to constrain the sources and sinks for the important redox processes. The results show that oil constituents other than BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o-, m- and p-xylenes), including n-alkanes and other aromatic compounds, play significant roles in plume evolution and secondary water quality impacts. The analysis underscores previous results on the importance of non-aqueous phases. Over 99.9% of the Fe2+ plume is attenuated by immobilization on sediments as Fe(II) and 85-95% of the carbon biodegradation products are outgassed. Gaps identified in carbon and Fe mass balances and in pH buffering mechanisms are used to formulate a new conceptual model. This new model includes direct out-gassing of CH4 and CO2 from organic carbon biodegradation, dissolution of directly produced CO2, and sorption with H exchange to improve pH buffering. The identification of these mechanisms extends understanding of natural attenuation of potential secondary impacts at enhanced reductive dechlorination sites, particularly for reduced Fe plumes, produced CH4, and pH perturbations.

However, using the detailed mechanisms literature in high-fidelity simulations, like direct numerical simulations, is not possible due to the high numerical cost. Accordingly, a reduced chemical mechanism is required, and the one proposed in this study contains 17 species and 44 reactions to encompass a very large range of pressure (P is an element of [1, 100] bar) and equivalence ratio (phi is an element of [0.2, 14]). The Optimized and Reduced Chemistry method, that is based on directed relation graph with error propagation, is applied to the RAMEC kinetic scheme, and validations are performed for a set of canonical test-cases: auto-ignition delay simulation, one-dimensional laminar premixed flame freely propagating and one-dimensional counterflow diffusion flame. A very good agreement is obtained by comparison with the RAMEC detailed mechanism. To further evaluate the ability of the reduced mechanism, a premixed flame expanding in a homogeneous isotropic turbulence at high pressure (P = 56 bar) is performed. The temporal evolution of the flame front is detailed from its ignition, revealing the flame behavior and its interaction with turbulence. The new reduced chemical mechanism performs well with a relative error of 4% for the maximum of temperature at each time step and even less if the difference observed in the auto-ignition times between the two mechanisms is considered. Finally, a substantial gain is found when using the reduced scheme on three-dimensional cases, the simulations being 8 times faster than those using the detailed scheme. A dedicated post-processing tool based on the contour tracing labeling method is developed to measure the flame length. (C) 2021 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The experimental test bench equipped with CARS and fluorescent diagnostic techniques was created and applied for the measurement of the induction time and velocity of combustion front during laser-induced ignition of the H-2-O-2 mixture in the model chamber. The complementary experiments on measuring the temperature and recording the emission of OH(X-2 Pi)and OH(A(2)Sigma(+)) radicals indicate that it is possible to ignite the H-2-O-2 mixture with phi=1-3 and P-0 = 1-3 atm at a rather low temperature similar to 700K, which is below the autoignition temperature, under the action of focused laser radiation(lambda = 193 nm) with the energy in the pulse of similar to 25-150 mJ. And the induction time is rather small and varies in the range of 8-50 mu s depending on mixture parameters and laser pulse energy. The analysis of ignition and combustion processes in the H-2-O-2 mixture under the action of resonance laser radiation is carried out on basis of two-dimensional numerical simulation with the use of the detailed kinetic mechanism of H-2 oxidation supplemented by the set of reactions describing the formation of electronically excited radicals OH(A(2)Sigma(+)). A special methodology for the calculation of the radiation absorption and determination of oxygen atoms concentration along the laser beam path was applied. The elaborated model allows us to describe the experimentally measured data for the induction time, the velocity of the combustion front, the space-time distribution of the OH radicals in the ground and excited states, and the temperature evolution in the focal region of the initiating laser radiation.

PHD homologues exist in other types of eukaryotes and prokaryotes where they act on non HIF substrates. To gain insight into the factors underlying different PHD substrates and properties, we carried out biochemical and biophysical studies on PHD homologues from the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, and the protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, both lacking HIF. The respective prolyl-hydroxylases (DdPhyA and TgPhyA) catalyze prolyl-hydroxylation of S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (Skp1), a reaction enabling adaptation to different dioxygen availability. Assays with full-length Skp1 substrates reveal substantial differences in the kinetic properties of DdPhyA and TgPhyA, both with respect to each other and compared with human PHD2; consistent with cellular studies, TgPhyA is more active at low dioxygen concentrations than DdPhyA. TgSkp1 is a DdPhyA substrate and DdSkp1 is a TgPhyA substrate. No cross-reactivity was detected between DdPhyA/TgPhyA substrates and human PHD2. The human Skp1 E147P variant is a DdPhyA and TgPhyA substrate, suggesting some retention of ancestral interactions. Crystallographic analysis of DdPhyA enables comparisons with homologues from humans, Trichoplax adhaerens, and prokaryotes, informing on differences in mobile elements involved in substrate binding and catalysis. In DdPhyA, two mobile loops that enclose substrates in the PHDs are conserved, but the C-terminal helix of the PHDs is strikingly absent. The combined results support the proposal that PHD homologues have evolved kinetic and structural features suited to their specific sensing roles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1083-351X		MEDLINE:32934009	32934009

Here, we introduce a novel Iso-type black phosphorus heterostructure guided by first principle calculation, which features unique heterointerface and electronic coupling interaction via stacking assembly of exfoliated black phosphorus (EBP) and amine-functionalized EBP (N-EBP). Inspired by the theoretical results, we constructed the Iso-type heterostructure comprising of ultrathin exfoliated few-layered EBP and N-EBP, both of which were derived from identical bulk BP. The purposive amine-functionalization not only creates positively-charged P atoms on N-EBP as effective active sites via N-induced intramolecular electron transfer (IET) but also endows N-EBP with lower work function relative to EBP, while the unique EBP/N-EBP Iso-type heterostructure engenders directional heterointerfacial electron transfer (HET). The coupled IET/HET effects optimize the charge redistribution to afford favorable O-2 adsorption. In this case, our unique strategy for the first time exploits the inherent catalytic capability of BP toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and enables the first use of BP as metal-free ORR catalysts for Zn-air cells. The newly-designed heterostructure facilitates a 4-e transfer ORR relative to inactive EBP or N-EBP. Importantly, the polymer-shielded heterostructure acts as efficient air electrodes to endow a primary Zn-air cell with high stability, large capacity and high energy density-superior to the commercial Pt/C-enabled cell. This study as the first report on metal-free BP-based ORR catalysts and air electrodes not only extends BP's application scopes but also renders new insight toward design of electronically-coupled superstructures for energy-related applications.

J	Gao, Dong; Guo, Liwen; Wang, Fusheng; Zhu, Lingqi; Gao, Zhanxiang				guo, liwen/GVR-8895-2022				Investigation on thermal analysis and FTIR microscopic characteristics of artificially-oxidized coal and chronic naturally-oxidized coal during secondary oxidation								FUEL				327						125151	10.1016/j.fuel.2022.125151				NOV 1 2022	2022	To reduce mine fire risk and ensure efficient resource utilization, an in-depth research must be conducted on the secondary oxidation of coal. Accordingly, the macroscopic oxidation characteristics and microscopic composition of newly-mined coal, artificially oxidized coal (the newly-mined coal oxidized at 70 degrees C and 180 degrees C) and repeated-mined coal (oxidized naturally over 10 years) were evaluated in this study. And these coal samples were labeled N, N-70, N-180, and R, respectively. The parameters indicating the oxidation characteristics of coal were analyzed by simultaneous thermal analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (STA-FTIR) and Shimazu Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR-8400) from the perspective of coal thermal reaction and functional groups. The experimental results suggest that the temperature T-2 required by N-70, N-180, and R to reach the oxidation stage was lower than that of N. In addition, CO and CO2 gases were released earlier from these coals than from N. The same release was earlier for N-180 and N-70 compared to that for R. Compared with N, the content of hydroxyl and aliphatic hydrocarbons in N-70, N-180 and R after the initial oxidation decreases, and the decrease of N-70, N-180 was greater than that of R. The content of oxygen-containing functional groups (-COOH, C=O, -COO-) increased significantly, and the increase for N-70, N-180 was greater than that of R. These results indicate that coal was more prone to secondary oxidization after primary oxidation. This is because the coal absorbed heat released during the primary oxidation and subsequently had a higher activity. The artificially-oxidized coal in the laboratory absorbed more heat and generated more oxygen-containing functional groups (-COOH, C=O, -COO-) than the chronic naturally-oxidized coal in the mine face, resulting in a higher risk of spontaneous combustion during secondary oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000852889500003

SiOx interlayer was deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) in plasma fed with argon, oxygen and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) in different ratios. Lead oxide was deposited by pulsed electrodeposition. Well-adherent and homogeneous SiOx film, characterized by high hydrophobicity, were deposited in oxygen rich plasma onto the SS substrate as confirmed by the morphological characterization performed by means of Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). The composition of PbO2 layer was investigated by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and evidenced that (3-PbO2 crystallites nucleation was promoted by the SiOx interlayer. Additionally, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed for assessing the electrochemical behaviour of the SS/SiOx/PbO2 anodes. Results confirmed that the increase in the presence of the (3-PbO2 form, increases the conductivity of the PbO2 film. Finally, the anode, with SiOx interlayer deposited in oxygen rich plasma, showed the best efficiency in removing the azoic dye from aqueous solution in terms of COD and color removal.

In this work, direct photodissociation cross sections of AlCl have been computed for transitions from the ground X1Sigma+ state to six low-lying excited electronic states by using ab initio potential energy curves and transition dipole moments, which are obtained by the internally contracted multireference configuration-interaction method with Davidson correction and the aug-cc-pV6Z basis set. State-resolved cross sections for transitions from 38 958 rovibrational levels (upsilon" les 100, J" les 400) of the ground X1Sigma+ state have been obtained for photon wavelengths from 500 Aring to the dissociation threshold. Photodissociation cross sections in local thermal equilibrium are evaluated for gas temperatures from 500 to 10 000 K. Using the computed cross sections, temperature-dependent photodissociation rates of AlCl in the interstellar and blackbody radiation fields are determined. The results can be applied to the investigation of the chemical evolution of Al in the envelope of carbon-rich and oxygen-rich stars.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0035-8711			INSPEC:21581107

The morphological structure of the polyacrylonitrile-based pre-oxidized fibers was investigated by Fourier transfer infrared spectra, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer. The changes of characteristic functional groups and chemical compositions confirmed the successful modification of the polyacrylonitrile fibers during pre-treatment. The grooves and cracks on the surface of polyacrylonitrile-based pre-oxidized fibers were remarkably decreased in comparison with that of pristine polyacrylonitrile fibers. The evolution of crystalline structure of the polyacrylonitrile fibers proved the occurrence of cyclization reactions during pre-oxidation. Meanwhile, thermal stability, flame retardant, and mechanical properties of polyacrylonitrile-based pre-oxidized fibers were also investigated by thermogravimetric analyzer, oxygen index meter, micro combustion calorimeter, and single fiber tensile tester, respectively. The results demonstrated that the polyacrylonitrile-based pre-oxidized fibers initially pre-treated by hydroxylamine hydrochloride, followed by monoethanolamine, had a high limiting oxygen index of 40.1 and breaking strength of 2.03 cN/dtex. The peak of heat release rate and total heat release of polyacrylonitrile-based pre-oxidized fibers decreased significantly while its charred residues increased, contributing to the improved flame retardant property.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1558-9250			WOS:000506611600001		
J	Yu, Cheng-Peng; Pan, Ze-Zheng; Luo, Da-Ya								TDO as a therapeutic target in brain diseases								METABOLIC BRAIN DISEASE				31	4			737	747		10.1007/s11011-016-9824-z				AUG 2016	2016	Tryptophan-2, 3-dioxygenase (TDO) is a heme-containing protein catalyzing the first reaction in the kynurenine pathway, which incorporates oxygen into the indole moiety of tryptophan and catalyzes it into kynurenine (KYN). The activation of TDO results in the depletion of tryptophan and the accumulation of kynurenine and its metabolites. These metabolites can affect the function of neurons and inhibit the proliferation of T cells. Increasing evidence demonstrates that TDO is a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of brain diseases as well as in the antitumor and transplant fields. Despite its growing popularity, there are few reviews only focusing on TDO. Hence, we herein review TDO by providing a comprehensive overview of TDO, including its biological functions as well as the evolution, structure and catalytic process of TDO. Additionally, this review will focus on the role of TDO in the pathology of three groups of brain diseases: Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Glioma. Finally, we will also provide an opinion regarding the future developmental directions of TDO in brain diseases, especially whether TDO has a potential role in other brain diseases as well as the development and applications of TDO inhibitors as treatments.									20	2	0	0	11	0	22			0885-7490	1573-7365		WOS:000379187900002	27072164

We have recently studied the heterogeneous recombination of O and Cl atoms on reactor walls in O-2 and Cl-2 plasmas through both experiments and modeling. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood (i.e., delayed) recombination was investigated using a "spinning-wall" technique in which a portion of the substrate surface is periodically exposed to an inductively coupled plasma and to a differentially pumped chamber where either Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) or line-of-sight mass spectrometry (MS) is used to detect surface and desorbing species. In this paper, a review of the various effects driving the O and Cl atoms recombination dynamics on anodized aluminum (AA) and stainless steel (SS) surfaces is presented. It is shown that recombination probabilities, gamma, can vary following plasma exposure due to surface conditioning. In Cl-2 plasmas, gamma was also found to depend on the Cl-to-Cl-2 number density ratio, a mechanism ascribed to a competition for adsorption sites between Cl and Cl. We have also determined the recombination rates of Cl atoms in Cl-2 high-density plasmas sustained by electromagnetic surface waves by comparing the measured degrees of dissociation of Cl, to those predicted by an isothermal fluid model. For a reactor with large SS and quartz surfaces exposed to the plasma, gamma values and their dependence on the Cl-to-Cl-2 number density ratio were consistent with those obtained from the rotating substrate technique. Similar values were obtained for plasmas sustained in a quartz discharge tube. It is expected that for plasmas sustained in or adjacent to a silica tube or plate, the Cl atoms recombination coefficient becomes independent of chamber wall material due to reactor seasoning, producing a silicon-oxychloride layer.					19th International Symposium on Plasma Chemistry (ISPC-19)19th International Symposium on Plasma Chemistry (ISPC-19)	JUL 26-31, 2009JUL 26-31, 2009	Int Union Pure & Appl Chem; Int Plasma Chem Soc; Minist Innovat, Sci, Res & Technol N Rhine WestphaliaInt Union Pure & Appl Chem; Int Plasma Chem Soc; Minist Innovat, Sci, Res & Technol N Rhine Westphalia	Bochum, GERMANYBochum, GERMANY	15	1	1	0	0	0	16			0033-4545	1365-3075		WOS:000279063900011

The conventional Haber-Bosh process to produce NH3 is energy intensive and leads to significant CO2 emission. Alternatively, electrochemical synthesis of ammonia (ESA) through the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) by using renewable electricity has recently attracted significant attention. Herein, we report a metal-organic framework- derived nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon as an electrocatalyst for the NRR. It exhibits a remarkable production rate of NH3 up to 3.4x10(-6) mol cm(-2) h(-1) with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 10.2% at -0.3 V vs. RHE under room temperature and ambient pressure using aqueous 0.1M KOH electrolyte. Increasing the temperature to 60 degrees C further improves production rates to 7.3x10(-6) mol cm(-2) h(-1). The stability of the nitrogendoped carbon electrocatalyst was demonstrated during an 18-h continuous test with constant production rates. First principles calculations were used to elucidate the possible active sites and reaction pathway. The moiety, which consists of three pyridinic N atoms (N-3) adjacent with one carbon vacancy embedded in a carbon layer, is able to strongly adsorb N-2 and further realize N = N triple bond dissociation for the subsequent protonation process. The rate-determining step of the NRR is predicted to be the adsorption and bond activation of N-2 molecule. Increasing overpotentials is favorable for the protonation process during NH3 generation. Further doping Fe into the nitrogen-doped carbon likely blocks the N-3 active sites and facilitates the hydrogen evolution reaction, a strong competitor to the NRR, thus yielding negative effect on ammonia production. This work provides a new insight into the rational design and synthesis of nitrogen-doped and defect-rich carbon as efficient NRR catalysts for NH3 synthesis at ambient conditions.									299	24	0	0	10	0	305			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000432604600026

Here, a self-doped nitrogen nanocatalyst (N-PC@CF) with a double-layered porous structure is rationally designed for flexible solid-state ZABs. The outer porous carbon shell of the N- PC@CF is highly hydrophilic and O(2 )permeable, while the layered porous structure exposes sufficient active sites to shorten the mass transfer distance, which would promote electrocatalytic performance and increase flexibility efficiently. The obtained N-PC@CF has an onset potential of 0.926 V and a half -wave potential of 0.843 V in the oxygen reduction reaction test, which is equivalent to commercial Pt/C. Most importantly, the maximum power density of the assembled ZAB is 134.7 mW cm(-2) and it exhibits a specific capacity of 776.8 mA h g-1 at 10 mA cm-2, which is better than the 99.9 mW cm(-2) of the Pt/C-based battery. An obvious improvement in the constant current discharge-charge cycle durability of the ZAB is found when compared with Pt/C. The specific capacities of ZAB with N-PC@CF as the air cathode at 5, 10 and 15 mA cm(-2) are 842.7, 776.8 and 715.0 mAh g-1 (calculated by the mass of zinc consumed), respectively, corresponding to high energy densities of 1089.7, 977.3 and 842.2 Wh kg(-1). A flexible solid-state battery is assembled with excellent flexibility and stability, even if the battery is folded into a large angle (160 ?). This work provides a new strategy for the design and synthesis of metal-free air cathodes. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

We employed a new, simple, cost-effective pyrolytic method to synthetize oxidized-graphenic nanoplatelets (OGNP) using bamboo pyroligneous acid (BPA) as a source. Thorough analyses via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy provides a complete structural and chemical description at the local scale of these samples. In particular, we found that at the highest carbonization temperature the OGNP-BPA are mainly in a sp(2) bonding configuration (sp(2) fraction of 87%). To determine the electrical properties of single nanoplatelets, these were contacted by Pt nanowires deposited through focused-ion-beam-induced deposition techniques. Increased conductivity by two orders of magnitude is observed as oxygen content decreases from 17% to 5%, reaching a value of 2.3 x 10(3) S m(-1) at the lowest oxygen content. Temperature-dependent conductivity reveals a semiconductor transport behavior, described by the Mott three-dimensional variable range hopping mechanism. From the localization length, we estimate a band-gap value of 0.22(2) eV for an oxygen content of 5%. This investigation demonstrates the great potential of the OGNP-BPA for technological applications, given that their structural and electrical behavior is similar to the highly reduced rGO sheets obtained by more sophisticated conventional synthesis methods.									24	0	0	0	1	0	24			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000384064400030	27483115

To achieve high energy density, long cycling stability, and low cost, the air electrode structure and the electrocatalysts play important roles. Here, a metal-free, free-standing macroporous graphene@graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) composite air cathode is first reported, in which the g-C3N4 nanosheets can act as efficient electrocatalysts, and the macroporous graphene nanosheets can provide space for Li2O2 to deposit and also promote the electron transfer. The electrochemical results on the graphene@g-C3N4 composite air electrode show a 0.48 V lower charging plateau and a 0.13 V higher discharging plateau than those of pure graphene air electrode, with a discharge capacity of nearly 17300 mA h g((composite))(-1). Excellent cycling performance, with terminal voltage higher than 2.4 V after 105 cycles at 1000 mA h g((composite))(-1) capacity, can also be achieved. Therefore, this hybrid material is a promising candidate for use as a high energy, long-cycle-life, and low-cost cathode material for lithium oxygen batteries.									130	9	0	0	11	0	135			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000356448300015	25688745

To this end, photocatalysts that comprise efficient light-harvesting semiconductor nanostructures and noble metal-free robust co-catalysts have attracted considerable attention. In this study, we designed a noble metal-free nanohybrid consisting of CdS nanorods (NRs) as photoabsorbers and CoSe2 nanocages as co-catalysts. Benefiting from suitable band edge potentials, abundant catalytically active sites, large surface area, and efficient photoexcited charge carrier transfer, the fabricated nanohybrid exhibited a remarkable photocatalytic H-2 evolution performance (82.5 mmol h(-1) g(-1)), which is approximately 37.5 times higher than that of bare CdS NRs. Moreover, the observed H-2 evolution rate was even higher than those of even noble metal Pt-anchored CdS NR composites. Furthermore, the fabricated nanohybrid exhibited prominent recycling stability (50 h) under solar light irradiation. The key role of the co-catalyst, the effects of the catalyst dosage and scavenger concentration, and the origin of the photocatalytic H-2 production were comprehensively investigated. We believe that this design is the prospective path toward the development of three-dimensional hollow-type noble metal-free nanostructures for enhancing H-2 production.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000483698400020

A catalyst-assisted selective vapor-solid (VS) growth was proposed to explain the formation of the dodecahedron In2O3 microcrystal, while the self-catalytic VS growth mechanism dominated the subsequent one-dimensional (1D) growth of the In2O3 rod underneath the In2O3 microcrystal. The structural evolution of these structures was carefully examined during the synthesis process by controlling the growth parameters. The morphologies, crystalline structures and surface chemistry were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction technique (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum at room temperature of the as-grown In2O3 structures exhibited both UV and blue luminescence emission under one excitation at 260nm, which may be related to the existence of oxygen vacancies. The synthesized multifaceted In2O3 microcrystal has shown to contain a large number of vertices and may find many applications in developing three-dimensional (3D) resonators. This work will not only enrich the synthesis science but also will open doors for applications of such structures in optical devices.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1862-6300	1862-6319		WOS:000412823000007

This paper firstly investigated N/S/Cl pollutants during pyrolysis and combustion of oily sludge in detail by thermogravimetry-mass spectrum (TG-MS) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Combined with the distribution characteristics and contents of hazardous elements, the releasing routes were proposed. Three typical decomposition steps were observed: volatilization of water and little hydrocarbons below 200 degrees C, cracking of hydrocarbons approximately at 200-500 degrees C, transformation of inorganic compositions at the higher temperature. Double-direction transfer diffusion reaction model was employed with estimated apparent activation energy Ea of 41.97-66.59 kJ center dot mol(-1) for pyrolysis and 52.02-62.42 kJ center dot mol(-1) for combustion. The main pyrolytic products were alkanes and alkenes ranging from C9 to C21, which had the potential to be reused as diesel fuels. Slight amounts of S/Cl-containing species were detected in liquid products. Database of inorganic and organic N/S/Cl pollutants with larger molecules was established. Organic N/S/Cl functionalities in oily sludge contributed to the majority of N/S/Cl pollutants. NH3, HCN, HNCO, NO, NO2, CS2, SO2, CH3SH, HCl, and Cl-2 were generated between 200 and 600 degrees C during pyrolysis process, which were much lower than the quantity of corresponding products from combustion. Oxygen-enriched atmosphere in combustion facilitated decomposition of organic fractions, and shifted release regions towards lower temperatures. The decomposition of amine-N functionality contributed to NH3 release below 200 degrees C. With temperature increasing, heterocyclic-N began to decompose and release abundant NH3, small amounts of HCN and HNCO. Aliphatic-S and disulfides-S contributed to the formation of H2S, COS, and CS2.									50	6	0	0	17	0	55			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000528188600041

Herein, we report a facile way to significantly enhance the catalytic efficiency of the P450cam system by the coupling of its native electron transfer system with enzymatic NADH regeneration catalyzed by glycerol dehydrogenase (GLD) in Escherichia coli whole cell biocatalysts. Recombinant E. coli harboring the P450cam system, but lacking GLD, exhibited little activity for camphor hydroxylation. In contrast, coexpression of GLD with the proteinaceous electron transfer components of P450cam resulted in about tenfold improvement in the substrate conversion, implying that the whole cell biocatalyst utilized molecular oxygen, endogenous NADH, and glycerol in the cell for catalysis. The addition of glycerol to the reaction media further promoted camphor hydroxylation, suggesting that exogenous glycerol is also available for GLD in the host cell and actively participates in the catalytic cycle. These results clearly show the utility of GLD towards functional reconstruction of the native P450cam system. The present approach may also be useful for E. coli whole cell biocatalysts with the other NADH-dependent oxygenases and oxidoreductases.									36	0	0	0	28	0	37			0175-7598	1432-0614		WOS:000239956200014	16421717

Here, we enhance the PICS efficiencies for hydrogen evolution from water at a Pt cathode coupled with a TiO2/Au photoanode by coating the TiO2/Au with a p-type NiO layer on which a Pt co-catalyst is deposited. PICS occurs at the Au-TiO2 interface under visible light. The electrons injected from the Au nanoparticles into TiO2 are transported to the Pt cathode and cause hydrogen evolution from water, the action spectrum of which matches the plasmonic extinction spectrum of the Au nanoparticles. The NiO layer extracts the separated positive charges from the Au nanoparticles, accumulates the charges and drives methanol oxidation at the Pt co-catalyst on NiO with the positive charges. As a result of the introduction of the Pt-modified NiO layer, the rates of methanol oxidation and accompanying hydrogen evolution at zero bias voltage were improved by similar to 3.5 times. The NiO layer may also protect the Au nanoparticles from self-oxidation.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000416425400045	29159348

The objective of this study was to characterize the photochemical traits of two epiphytic orchids (Cattleya warneri and Miltonia spectabilis) under water deficit (WD). Chlorophyll a fluorescence signals were recorded from young and fully expanded leaves of 5 plants/species after dark-adaption for 60 minutes, between 6-9 a.m. after 0, 30, 60, and 90 days of WD, using a Handy-PEA fluorometer (Hansatech, UK). Increases of O-J and J-I phases and L and K-bands and decreases of I-P phase were observed after 30 days of WD, especially in C. warneri. Decreases in the capacity to photochemically reduce quinone A (Q(A)) and the kinetic properties required for redox reactions of the plastoquinone pool, the loss of energetic connectivity between units of PSII, inactivation of the oxygen evolution complex, and decrease of the overall rate of reducing the electron acceptor pool of photosystem I were observed in M. spectabilis, a more tolerant species. The greater ability of this species to maintain higher relative water content (RWC) in photosynthetic tissues allows greater photochemical activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2447-536X		WOS:000706385200013

However, the presence of interconnected pathways (microscale porosity) within the deposit limits the performance of the metallic coating as an effective barrier to corrosion and substrate attack by corrosive media is usually inevitable. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of processing, including a postspray laser treatment, on the deposit microstructure and corrosion behavior. Commercially pure titanium (CP Ti) was deposited onto a carbon steel substrate, using a commercial cold spray system (CGT(TM) Kinetiks(A (R)) 4000) with preheated nitrogen as both the main process gas and the powder carrier gas. Selected coatings were given a surface melting treatment using a commercial 2 kW CO2 laser (505 Trumpf DMD). The effect of postdeposition laser treatment on corrosion behavior was analyzed in terms of pore structure evolution and microstructural changes. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction were employed to examine the microstructural characteristics of the coatings. Their corrosion performance was investigated using electrochemical methods in 3.5 wt.% NaCl (ASTM G5-94 (2004)). As-sprayed titanium coatings could not provide favorable protection to the carbon steel substrate in the aerated NaCl solution, whereas the coatings with laser-treated surfaces provided barrier-like properties.									51	5	2	0	0	0	54			1059-9630			WOS:000290579300023

Herein, we successfully synthesized Ni2P nanoflakes for catalyzing the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Due to the higher electrical conductivity as well as the prevailing tendency in triggering the UOR via a direct electro-oxidation mechanism, Ni2P nanoflakes exhibit comparable UOR activity (1.33 V vs. RHE for onset-potential, and 95.47 mA center dot cm(-2) at 1.6 V vs. RHE) to the most active state-of-the-art catalysts, rendering them an effective alternative to precious metals such as Pt and Rh. The accelerated proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process caused by PO43- facilitates the in situ generation of NiOOH; thus, the UOR process is initiated at a lower onset-potential on Ni2P nanoflakes than on beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanoflakes. The in situ generated NiOOH instead of the Ni2P phase in Ni2P nanoflakes functions as an active site during the UOR process, while both NiOOH and the Ni2P phase serve as active sites in the OER process. This work provides insights into the understanding of the UOR mechanism and opens a new avenue to design low-cost Ni-based phosphide UOR catalysts.									41	0	0	0	4	0	41			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000612999200028	33432949

Our results reveal that the method is feasible and highly efficient in producing 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets which greatly overcome the drawbacks of bulk g-C3N4 photocatalyst. The reduced band gap caused by the covalent functionalization of alkyl chains on g-C3N4 lattice improves the photoresponse and the visible-light harvesting ability, indicating more charge carriers will generate under visible-light irradiation. In addition, the significantly enlarged surface area and the nanosheet structural benefits are favorable for the separation of photogenerated charge carriers. The photocatalytic activity of AGCNNs under visible-light irradiation is highly enhanced because of the synergistic effects of these favorable factors. The RhB photodegradation rate and the photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of AGCNNs are 3.9 and 1.9 times as fast as that of g-C3N4, respectively. The photocatalytic activity of AGCNNs is further improved when combined with a minority of graphene sheets which are employed as electron acceptors promoting the separation of photogenerated charge carriers. The RhB photodegradation rate and the photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of AGCNNs are further improved to 9.1 and 3.3 times as fast as that of g-C3N4, respectively.									26	1	0	0	3	0	26			2196-7350			WOS:000406767300012		
J	Ji, Yan; Pei, Haiyan; Hu, Wenrong								FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF A NOVEL SOIL DENITRIFYING BACTERIUM								FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN				22	5A			1541	1547						2013	2013	The purpose of this work was to study the denitrifying characteristics of strain LZ-4, and determine its taxonomic status. Batch experiments were performed to confirm the optimum denitrifying parameters of strain LZ-4 including temperature, pH, C/N, dissolved oxygen (DO) etc. At 25 degrees C, the strain showed the highest denitrifying efficiency, with about 97% nitrogen reduction. Nitrogen removal efficiencies were maintained above 95% between 20 and 30 degrees C. Low temperature hindered the denitrification process of LZ-4. At 10 degrees C, merely 66.5% of nitrogen was reduced and significant nitrite accumulation occurred simultaneously. The favorable initial pH range was wide. From pH 6 to 11, approximately 96% of nitrogen was degraded without remarkable nitrite accumulation. The denitrification efficiency increased from 25.6 to 98% as C/N (mol/mol) ratios increased from 1 to 3. Under anoxic (steady state) and low DO concentration conditions (0.5-1 mg/L, 70 rpm shaking), the highest denitrification efficiency and the lowest nitrite accumulation were achieved. Neither anaerobic conditions (sealed and steady) nor aerobic conditions (120 or 170 rpm of shaking) was favorable for the denitrification. By molecular methods (amplified ribosomal DNA and partial 16S rDNA gene sequencing), LZ-4 was identified as Pseudomonas sp. The gas released during denitrification procedure was analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The GC-MS results verified that N-2 was the only end-product of denitrification. The study also showed that denitrification appeared to be a first-order reaction, with respect to initial nitrate concentration.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1018-4619	1610-2304		WOS:000319179200007

Then, different volume fractions of this ceramic were blended with Al powder through different durations of the high-energy vibratory milling. The effect of mechanical milling on the thermal degradation of AT in exposure to Al and formation mechanism of in-situ Al2O3 and Al3Ti particles were explored in three conditions: (i) in the powder form; (ii) after annealing of green compact; and (iii) after hot extrusion. In the powder form, it was shown that the mechanical milling is able to significantly diminish the thermal stability of AT, so that the required temperature for the Al3Ti formation decreases from 600 to about 450 degrees C. Also, by extending the mechanical milling duration, the contact surface for interfacial reactions between Al and AT increases and the formation of Al3Ti and Al2O3 is facilitated. By selecting the optimum duration of mechanical milling, this study successfully fixed the microstructure problems of not-milled as-annealed composites i.e. unreacted AT particles and oxygen evolution-arisen cracks, and produced in-situ composite inside each Al particle. However, the induced work hardening of these milled particles hinders the perfect consolidation. To deal with this challenge, the hot extrusion at 535 degrees C was conducted. The obtained microstructure was composed of very fine (<= 200 nm) semispherical Al3Ti and Al2O3 particles uniformly distributed within the Al matrix. To evaluate the mechanical response of the fabricated nanocomposites, the micro-hardness and nanoindentation testing were carried out. The results proved that the hardness and elastic modulus of the nanocomposites reach 143 HV and 90 GPa, respectively, indicating a significant improvement in the mechanical properties of these systems compared to not-milled extruded composites. Finally, the role of reinforcing particles in strengthening of composite was evaluated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000464542700059

In this work, we have investigated the conditions under which thin-film conducting polymers may synergistically amplify catalysis. A composite conducting polymer film has been developed that, when overcoated on a bare Pt electrode, amplifies its catalytic performance by an order of magnitude (into the mA/cm(2) range). When poised at 0.80 V (vs Ag/AgCl) at pH 12, a control, bare Pt electrode yielded a current density of 0.15 mA/cm(2) for catalytic water oxidation. When then overcoated with a composite poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) film containing nanoparticulate Ni (nano-Ni) catalyst and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) conductor in the specific molar ratio of 4.5 (C; PEDOT): 1 (Ni): 9.5 (C; other), the electrode generated water oxidation current densities of 1.10-1.15 mA/cm(2) under the same conditions (over >50 h of operation; including a photocurrent of 0.55 mA/cm(2) under light illumination of 0.25 sun). Control films containing other combinations of the above components, yielded notably lower currents. These conditions represent the most favorable for water oxidation at which PEDOT does not degrade. Studies suggested that the above composite contained an optimum ratio of catalyst density to conductivity and thickness in which the PEDOT electrically connected the largest number of catalytic sites (thereby maximizing the catalytically active area) by the shortest, least-resistive pathway (thereby minimizing the Tafel slope). That is, the amplification appeared to be created by a synergistic matching of the connectivity, conductivity, and catalytic capacity of the film. This approach provides a potential means for more effectively deploying thin-film conducting polymers as catalyst supports.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2574-0962			WOS:000458706400083

The goal of this study was to characterize microbial composition in two constructed wetlands designed to remove contaminants from dairy washwater. Water samples were collected weekly for 11 months from two wetlands to determine the efficiency of the treatment system in removal of chemical contaminants and total and fecal coliforms. The reduction by the treatment was greatest for biological oxygen demand, suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, nitrate, and coliforms. There was only moderate removal of total nitrogen and phosphorus. Changes in the total bacterial community and ammonia-oxidizing bacterial composition were examined by using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments of the gene carrying the alpha subunit of the ammonia monooxygenase gene (amoA) recovered from soil samples and DGGE bands. DGGE analysis of wetlands and manure samples revealed that the total bacterial community composition was dominated by bacteria from phylogenetic clusters related to Bacillus, Clostridium, Mycoplasma, Eubacterium, and Proteobacteria originally retrieved from the gastrointestinal tracts of mammals. The population of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria showed a higher percentage of Nitrosospira-like sequences from the wetland samples, while a higher percentage of Nitrosomonas-like sequences from manure, feces, raw washwater, and facultative pond was found. These results show that the wetland system is a natural process dependent upon the development of healthy microbial communities for optimal wastewater treatment.									150	17	0	0	121	3	165			0099-2240			WOS:000185437000004	12957887

Herein, we design and synthesize an advanced Pd-based catalyst, where small palladium-phosphorus nanoparticles (Pd3P NPs) with similar to 5.2 wt% Pd loading are embedded in three-dimensional (3D) bubble-like nitrogen, phosphorus co-doped carbon (NPC) film (Pd3P@NPC). The resultant catalyst delivers markedly enhancive catalytic performance in comparison with commercial Pt/C, Pd/C, Pd3P and NPC toward ORR, benefiting from the specific 3D porous structure, nano-size effect and the electronic interaction between Pd3P NPs and NPC. Specifically, the half-wave potential of Pd3P@NPC (0.885 V) is 36 mV higher than that of commercial Pt/C, and the mass activity of Pd3P@NPC is 1.112 mA mu g(Pd)(-1) at 0.85 V, which is 8.18-fold and 11.96-fold enhancement in regard to that of commercial Pt/C and Pd/C, respectively. It is interesting to note that the as-prepared Pd3P@NPC also maintains a predominant stability after 40,000 potential sweeping cycles. This new catalyst is expected to enlarge the species of 3D Pd-based composites such as palladium carbide, palladium nitride and palladium sulfide on heteroatoms doped carbon substrate for ORR.									3	2	0	0	0	0	4			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000621734500001

However, little is known about PSKs in Rosaceae species. Here, we identified 10 PSK genes in pear (Pyrus bretschneideri), 11 in apple (Malus x domestica), four in peach (Prunus persica), six in strawberry (Fragaria vesca), and five in Chinese plum (Prunus mume). In addition, we undertook comparative analysis of the PSK gene family in pear and the four other species. Evolutionary analysis indicated that whole genome duplication events (WGD) may have contributed to the expansion of the PSK gene family in Rosaceae. Transcriptomes, reverse transcription-PCR and quantitative real-time-PCR analyses were undertaken to demonstrate that PbrPSK2 is highly expressed in pear pollen. In addition, by adding purified E. coli-expressed PbrPSK2 to pollen and using an antisense oligonucleotide approach, we showed that PbrPSK2 can promote pear pollen tube elongation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, PbrPSK2 was found to mediate the production of reactive oxygen species to regulate pear pollen tube growth.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1664-462X			WOS:000598157700001	33329671

The SVET technique was efficient in identifying the cathodic and anodic weld regions. The welding joint (WJ), which comprises the thermomechanically affected zone (TMAZ) and the stir zone (SZ), was cathodic relative to the heated affected zone (HAZ) and the base metal (BM). The reactivities of the welding joint at the advancing side (AS) and the retreating side (RS) were analyzed and compared using SECM technique in the competition mode by monitoring the dissolved oxygen as a redox mediator in 0.005 mol L-1 NaCl solution. The RS was more electrochemically active than the AS, and these results were correlated with the microstructural features of the welded alloy.

J	Clauer, Norbert; Williams, Lynda B.; Fallick, Anthony E.								Genesis of nanometric illite crystals elucidated by light-element (hydrogen, lithium, boron and oxygen) isotope tracing, and K-Ar and Rb-Sr dating								CHEMICAL GEOLOGY				383				26	50		10.1016/j.chemgeo.2014.05.025				SEP 15 2014	2014	Illitization is a widely used tracer for evaluation of the thermal evolution in volcano-sedimentary sequences during burial, metamorphic and tectonic events. However, no agreement exists about how the process proceeds at the crystal scale, which initiated perspectives based on the challenging separation of nanometric "fundamental" illite-rich particles in the mid 1980s. In 1997, the first isotopic study on such nanometric crystals was published, followed by others that raised new potential to improve understanding of the illitization process.The present review focuses on the promising and still unsolved aspects of light-element isotopic (delta D, delta Li-7, delta B-11, delta O-18) tracing, and K-Ar and Rb-Sr dating of nanometric illite-rich crystals extracted not only from bentonites, but also from sandstones and shales in diagenetic to low-grade metamorphic conditions. If the study of nanocrystals from bentonite and sandstone beds now appears successful, problems remain in separating mechanically authigenic illite-type crystals from detrital minerals of shales, even at the nanometric size. An indirect way to distinguish the data of these components is alkylammonium leaching, which has the specificity of stochiometrically replacing K in dioctahedral mica-type particles, and therefore to modify significantly their K-Ar balance. The overall separation technique for illite nanocrystals is specific with chemical treatments to remove the soluble phases, including organics, that are mixed with illite, "infinite" dispersion, high-speed fluid-flow centrifugation and removal of excess reagent by dialysis. Importantly, the initial K-Ar studies showed that no age information is lost during crystal nucleation and growth, with the whole illitization history apparently retained in the illite particles of different sizes. Based on combined K-Ar, Rb-Sr, delta O-18 and dD studies, reaction rates and durations of illitization can be reconstructed, together with changing crystallization temperature and fluid chemistry depending on the water/rock ratio. On the basis of K-Ar dating, nucleation and growth can be continuous during a given period of time, or episodic. The Rb-Sr method complements the information about the origin of the interacting fluids by recalculating Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios that depend on the amount of the fluids and their interaction with their pore environment. Combined with oxygen isotope data, such Sr isotope information points to differences in the origin of the solvents (by delta O-18) and the solutes (by Sr-87/Sr-86). The delta O-18 values of the illite crystals provide information about nucleation or growth temperature, either increasing during burial, or set abnormally high and constant during thermal episodes, or about changing fluid composition. Occurrence of organic matter could potentially bias the delta O-18 of nucleating and growing illite crystals, when involved in initial organic maturation.The largest B reservoir in sedimentary deposits is probably within the organic matter. When released with oil and gas after maturation, most of this organic B is isotopically light in the fluids relative to other natural waters, whereas B-11 fractionates preferentially into the bitumen. Put in context with oxygen and hydrogen isotope variations, the B data also confirm that the illite tetrahedral B-O bonds are as strong as the Si-O bonds, thus preserving the large isotopic variations that occur during thermal maturation of kerogen. The changing clay-organic interactions in sedimentary environments can, therefore, be traced by the B content and isotope composition. The presently limited results on Li contents and isotope composition of nanometric illite crystals that potentially interact with organics outline trends that are similar to those of B.

However, the poor electrical properties of hematite limit its intrinsic activity with regard to PEC water splitting. Herein, we report an innovative dual modification strategy that combines metal (Sn) doping and H-2 treatment to prepare an efficient hematite photoanode for PEC water splitting. Sn doping and the subsequent H-2 treatment generate different electron donors, Sn4+ and oxygen vacancies (V-o), in hematite. Electrochemical impedance measurements revealed that dual-modified hematite with a synchronous presence of Sn4+ and V-o exhibited significantly improved electrical properties with 111 times higher donor density and 10 times smaller charge transfer resistance than those of bare hematite. As a result, the photooxidation current was 4.61 mA cm(-2) (at 1.6 V-RHE), which is 55 times higher than that of bare hematite (83 mu A cm(-2)) and substantially higher than the sum of the photooxidation current exhibited by the two single-modified hematites (298 mu A cm(-2) for Sn doping and 681 mu A cm(-2) for H-2 treatment). A stable photocurrent was maintained under prolonged illumination over 12 h without showing any sign of deactivation. Additional cobalt treatment further increased the PEC water oxidation performance of the dual-modified hematite, achieving a superior Faraday efficiency (ca. 99%) and stability. Compared to the oxygen-deficient heat treatment (under Ar) of Sn-doped hematite, the combination of Sn doping and H-2 treatment induces outstanding synergistic improvement of PEC activity (photocurrent twice that of Sn-doped and Ar-treated hematite).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2052-1537		WOS:000679996900001

Both photoelectrochemical experiments and computational explorations demonstrate that the electron delocalization and reaction barrier can be well regulated by single atom substitution of S, N and O in the 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene linked COPs. Based on the prominent electron donating capacity of S, the fast electron transfer and prolonged lifetime of photoinduced charge carriers endow COP-S with superior photocatalytic CO2 conversion efficiency and selectivity. The CO production rate reaches 196.4 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) without the presence of cocatalysts and sacrificial agents, which is 2.1-folds and 2.5-folds of COP-N and COP-O. In particular, the oxidization of H2O to O-2 is also realized on bulk COP-S. Our explorations expand the COPs skeleton engineering toolbox and provide new guidance for the design of efficient catalysts for solar energy utilizations.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000820617300007

The influence of the support on the electronic state of Pt was investigated via in-situ X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy. Pt d-band filling, determined from XANES white line analysis, was lower and nearly constant between 0.4 and 0.95 V vs. RHE for Pt/BC, indicating more positively charged particles in the double layer region and a delay in the onset of oxide formation by about 0.2 V compared to the Pt/C catalyst, which showed a marked increase in d-band vacancies above 0.8 V vs. RHE. Moreover, Delta mu analysis of the XANES data indicated a lack of sub-surface oxygen for the Pt/BC catalyst compared to the Pt/C catalyst above 0.9 V vs. RHE. Additional anion adsorption on the Pt/BC in the double layer region, detected by CO displacement, was also confirmed by XANES analysis of the d-band occupancy. The H-2 oxidation activities of electrodes with low catalyst loadings were assessed under high mass transport conditions using the floating electrode methodology. The metal-support interaction between the Pt and BC support improved the maximum hydrogen oxidation current density by 1.4 times when compared to Pt/C.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000435619700023

The carbonic anhydrase action was followed for the reaction of CO2 with H2O resulting in a bicarbonate ion and a proton. All the catalysts were found to be active for CO2 hydration and the mechanism proved them to be biomimetic. Interconversion of CO2 to a HCO3- ion took place with five elementary steps viz. OH- formation by H2O dissociation, linear CO2 complexation, CO2 bending by nucleophilic attack of an OH- ion over CO2, HCO3- ion formation by intramolecular proton migration and HCO3- ion displacement by H2O addition. Free energy landscapes over the catalysts were developed for CO2 hydration reaction. The activation energies of H2O dissociation and CO2 bending were observed to be substantially smaller over Ru-4-CNT when compared to those over the other catalysts. Ru-4-CNT was found to be the best catalyst for CO2 hydration with the rate limiting step being HCO3- ion formation.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000399004700014	28220172

Scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy were used to determine oxidation-induced vertical etch rates (used to determine reactive sticking coefficients) and oxide-cluster densities. The reactive sticking coefficient and oxide cluster nucleation were found to be strongly enhanced in regions of higher step density. A comparison with model simulations of oxide cluster nucleation indicates that the increased nucleation rate is not simply due to the enhanced reactive sticking coefficient, but rather must be partially due to a step-related enhanced nucleation mechanism. Our measurements suggest that the atomic structure of the step (e.g., "A type," "B type," "mixed," single height, double height, etc.) may also have an effect on the enhanced nucleation. The average diffusion length of surface oxygen is found to be much longer than the average step spacing for high surface miscut indicating that the nucleation enhancement at individual steps is weak.

(annual ryegrass) have developed resistance to herbicides; however, few have developed resistance to phenylurea herbicides. Two biotypes with different histories of herbicide selection pressure were six to eight times less sensitive to the phenylurea herbicide, chlorotoluron, than a susceptible biotype. Resistance was not due to differences in the herbicide target site as oxygen evolution by thylakoids isolated from resistant and susceptible biotypes was similarly inhibited by diuron and chlorotoluron. There was no difference in the uptake and distribution of chlorotoluron into resistant and susceptible plants. There was a twofold greater rate of chlorotoluron detoxification in resistant plants with N-demethylation being a major detoxification reaction. Resistant plants treated with a 3-h pulse of 120 muM chlorotoluron recovered net carbon fixation after 42 h, half the time taken by susceptible plants. The mixed-function oxidase inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole (70 muM) intensified the effects of chlorotoluron in resistant plants when applied in combination with the herbicide for 7 d. 1-Aminobenzotriazole also inhibited the metabolism of chlorotoluron in both resistant and susceptible plants. The cytochrome P-450 inhibitor, piperonyl butoxide piperonyl butoxide, interacted with chlorotoluron when applied to plants growing in soil. Chlorotoluron applied with reduced plant dry weight to a greater extent than chlorotoluron alone. It appears, therefore, that enhanced detoxification is the major mechanism of resistance to chlorotoluron in the resistant biotypes studied.									49	1	0	0	43	1	51			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:A1993LC89700006

Here, these regions have been investigated by combinatorial mutagenesis and pseudorevertant mapping. No single amino-acid residue in the I265-F268 region was found to be critical for function, but a large hydrophobic residue at position 267 and preferentially an aromatic residue at position 268 appeared to be required for photoautotrophic growth. Starting from an obligate photoheterotrophic mutant lacking the T271-K277 region, photoautotrophic pseudorevertants were generated with short in-frame tandem repeats near the site of the original deletion, partially or fully restoring the length of the original protein. These pseudorevertants were sensitive to oxygen indicating that the T271-K277 region may provide PS II stability and/or protection against oxygen-dependent photoinactivation. Pseudorevertants with much improved photoautotrophic growth were also generated for one of the combinatorial mutants in the I265-F268 region. Surprisingly, the secondary mutations in these pseudorevertants mapped to the ferrochelatase gene. We speculate that the secondary mutation in ferrochelatase gene resulted in altered ferrochelatase activity. Decreased heme (phycobilin) biosynthesis and/or increased chlorophyll biosynthesis could then lead to improved PS II performance of the combinatorial CP47 mutant.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0014-2956			WOS:000089858100025	11012684

To understand the effect of atmosphere chemistry on thermal coarsening and degradation, and means of limiting it, this study focuses on the high-resolution characterization of NPG-Pt layers coarsened in reductive Ar-H-2 atmosphere, and in oxidative air. Atom probe tomography (APT) analysis is performed on NPG-Pt, coarsened separately in either Ar-H-2 or air, to characterize the atomic-scale chemical changes in the nanoligaments and to develop a mechanistic view of the inherent processes. A tendency of Ag to segregate to the surface during coarsening is found to lead to complete elimination of the nanoligament core-shell structures in both cases. Large Pt segregates form during coarsening in Ar-H-2, but under the surface of the ligaments, having relatively little effect on the coarsening rate. The oxygen-induced segregation of Pt was observed to cause the inhibition of thermal coarsening after minor loss in surface area-to-volume ratio. Findings in this paper help in understanding further the thermal coarsening of heterogeneous nanomaterials made by dealloying, and the pertinent factors that come into play in different chemical environments.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2397-2106		WOS:000598863700001

Nanostructures and nanomaterials have contributed significantly to the field of renewable energy due to their new physicochemical properties, Iron-based nanostructures have considerable advantages like small band gaps, allowing to harvest photons in the visible region of the solar spectrum, abundance, and important physical properties like magnetism and ferroelectricity. But they also have many shortcomings and drawbacks related to stability in the different photocatalytic media, low surface area, conductivity, and fast charge carrier recombination. In this review, the focus is placed on important members of the iron-based photocatalyst family such as, hematite, iron oxy-hydroxide, iron-based perovskites, and spinel ferrites. Also, iron doped titanium dioxide as visible light photocatalysts is covered. Various strategies employed for enhancing the photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic performance are discussed. Doping, oxygen vacancies, induced defects and formation of solid solutions seem to be a working strategy to address some of the challenges in photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis. Finally, photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic applications employing iron-based semiconductors are presented.									65	5	0	0	12	0	65			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600106

It was found that variation of the sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) concentration and the temperature had a significant influence on the morphology of Ag-In-Ni-S and the photocatalytic activity. The newly synthesized Ag-In-Ni-S nanocomposites were fully characterized by powder XRD, IR, UV-vis, DRS, FE-SEM, TEM, EDX, XPS, BET and TGA. The catalytic activities were measured by the degradation of methylene blue (MB) in the absence and presence of visible light (sunlight and 100 W tungsten lamp). The catalyst was found to be effective in degrading MB through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which was confirmed using terephthalic acid (TA), dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR123) treatment and ESI mass spectroscopy. The removal efficiency of MB by the nanocomposites is very fast, nearly quantitative and repeatable up to five cycles.									70	1	0	0	11	0	70			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000358211700032

This microstructure gives rise to a high density, tensile strength, stiffness and electrical conductivity. With respect to a Si-C-O fibre (Nicalon NL202), the Si-C fibres have a much greater thermal stability owing to the absence of the unstable SiOxCy phase. Despite its high chemical stability, it is nevertheless subject to a slight structural evolution at high temperatures of both SiC and free carbon phases, beginning at pyrolysis temperatures in the range 1200-1400 degrees C and improving with increasing pyrolysis temperature and annealing time. A moderate superficial decomposition is also observed beyond 1400 degrees C, in the form of a carbon enriched layer whose thickness increases as the pyrolysis temperature and annealing time are raised. The strength reduction at ambient for pyrolysis temperatures below 1600 degrees C could be caused by SiC coarsening or superficial degradation. Si-C fibres have a good oxidation resistance up to 1400 degrees C, due to the formation of a protective silica layer.									148	13	0	0	0	0	157			0022-2461			WOS:A1997WE27200008

Here, with catalytic, aerobic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural as an example, Pt SAC (Pt-1-N-4) was synthesized and tested first. With commercial Pt/C (Pt loading of 5 wt %) as a benchmark, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) yield of 97.6% was obtained. Pt SAC (0.56 wt %) gave a much lower FDCA yield (28.8%). By changing the coordination atoms from highly electronegative N to low electronegative Co atoms, the prepared Pt single-atom alloy (SAA, Pt-1-Co-3) catalyst with ultralow Pt loading (0.06 wt %) gave a much high FDCA yield (99.6%). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that positively charged Pt sites (+0.712e) in Pt-1-N-4 almost lost the capability for oxygen adsorption and activation, as well as the adsorption for the key intermediate. In Pt-1-Co-3 SAA, the central negatively charged Pt atom (-0.446e) facilitated the adsorption of the key intermediate; meanwhile, the nearby Co atoms around the Pt atom constituted the O-2-preferred adsorption/activation sites. This work shows the difference between the SAC with NPs and the SAA during liquid-phase oxidation of HMF and gives a useful guide in the future single-atom catalyst design in other related reactions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000710924900024	34612043

Here we report the synthesis of a monolayer of silicon-and oxygen-codoped graphene (SiOG) using polycarbosilane as both the C and Si sources in a thermal chemical vapor deposition process and compare the SiOG with primitive graphene ( PG). Composition and structure of the PG and SiOG are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The SiOG produced from polycarbosilane has a ratio of [Si] to [Si]+[C] of 8.9%. Meanwhile, doping Si forms Si-C and C-Si-O bonds in graphene. Doping Si in graphene also introduces a defective structure in the graphene lattice. Graphene/Si Schottky diodes are prepared for performance comparison. Doping Si increases the barrier height of the graphene/Si Schottky diodes from 0.76 eV to 0.78 eV and changes the ideal factor from 3.8 to 2.8. The graphene/Si photodetectors are self-powered under UV irradiation. The ON/OFF ratios in 0.3 mW cm(-2) of 365 nm light at a zero bias voltage are respectively 3500 and 7600, and the rise times/fall times are respectively 11.6 ms/53.6 ms and 4.8 ms/14.3 ms for the PG/Si and SiOG/Si photodetectors. The relatively better performance of the SiOG/Si over PG/Si in UV sensing is possibly due to the lowering of the Fermi level of graphene by incorporation of Si and O.									12	3	0	0	0	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000447744200015

It was believed as a superb catalyst support and promoter for its large specific surface, carrier mobility and high optical transmittance. Explorers across multiple disciplines were paid huge concentration to it owing to the unique physiochemical characteristics. In this review, hybrids of graphene oxide and semiconductors promise photocatalysts owing to their flexible properties and the large number of synthesis variables obtainable for modifications. Recent developments were confirmed that the GO supported semiconductors based photocatalysts can be predictable as the most privileged and hopeful novel photocatalysts in the photocatalytic applications. Furthermore, we were discussed important progresses in an efficient GO supported semiconductors based nanocomposites, including the common preparation approaches and development mechanisms, as well as their recent applications such as, removal of contaminates, H-2 evolution and CO2 reduction. This significant review ends with an outline and some perceptions on the challenges and new instructions in investigating GO supported semiconductors based photocatalysts. It is also believed that this review will encourage further exploration and will inaugurate new possibilities to increase new hybrid GO based semiconductors photocatalysts with new and inspiring applications.

Typically only photolysis of smaller organic molecules (e.g., formaldehyde) for which explicit data exist is included in chemistry-climate models. Here, we specifically examine the photolysis of larger molecules that actively partition between the gas and particle phases. The chemical mechanism generator GECKO-A is used to explicitly model SOA formation from alpha-pinene, toluene, and C-12 and C-16 n-alkane reactions with OH at low and high NOx. Simulations are conducted for typical mid-latitude conditions and a solar zenith angle of 45 degrees (permanent daylight). The results show that after 4 days of chemical aging under those conditions (equivalent to 8 days in the summer mid-latitudes), gas-phase photolysis leads to a moderate decrease in SOA yields, i.e., similar to 15% (low NOx) to similar to 45%(high NOx) for alpha-pinene, similar to 15% for toluene, similar to 25% for C-12 n-alkane, and similar to 10% for C-16 n-alkane. The small effect of gas-phase photolysis on low-volatility n-alkanes such as C-16 n-alkane is due to the rapid partitioning of early-generation products to the particle phase, where they are protected from gas-phase photolysis. Minor changes are found in the volatility distribution of organic products and in oxygen to carbon ratios. The decrease in SOA mass is increasingly more important after a day of chemical processing, suggesting that most laboratory experiments are likely too short to quantify the effect of gas-phase photolysis on SOA yields. Our results also suggest that many molecules containing chromophores are preferentially partitioned into the particle phase before they can be photolyzed in the gas phase. Given the growing experimental evidence that these molecules can undergo in-particle photolysis, we performed sensitivity simulations using an empirically estimated SOA photolysis rate of J(SOA) = 4 x 10(-4) J(NO2). Modeling results indicate that this photolytic loss rate would decrease SOA mass by 40-60% for most species after 10 days of equivalent atmospheric aging at mid-latitudes in the summer. It should be noted that in our simulations we do not consider in-particle or aqueous-phase reactions which could modify the chemical composition of the particle and thus the quantity of photolabile species. The atmospheric implications of our results are significant for both the SOA global distribution and lifetime. GEOS-Chem global model results suggest that particle-phase photolytic reactions could be an important loss process for SOA in the atmosphere, removing aerosols from the troposphere on timescales of less than 7 days that are comparable to wet deposition.									47	1	0	0	11	0	47			1680-7316	1680-7324		WOS:000360646500011

Water splitting toward hydrogen production is a very promising way for the goal. Although the cathodic reaction is of major interest in hydrogen production, the concurrent anodic water oxidation, which provides cheap electrons for the cathodic reaction, is a limitation for hydrogen formation. The best water-oxidizing catalyst was found by Nature million years ago and used in plants, algae and cyanobacteria. We believe learning from the natural system is very promising, because Nature has been successfully. splitting water for millions of years, using an inexpensive and environmentally friendly Mn-Ca oxido cluster. Herein we study the phenol oxidation by some nano sized metal oxides in the presence of H2O2. As metal oxides are functional and structural models for the water-oxidizing complex in Photosystem II, the results can be expanded for the natural site. We suggest that low organic compound oxidation under water oxidation is an important issue to select manganese and calcium ions for water oxidation. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Exploring efficient non-precious-metal electrocatalysts is necessary for the widespread application of this energy storage model. Two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin solids with a special atomic and electronic structure are full of unlimited potential in the pursuit of high-efficiency electrocatalysts and have been identified as a perfect platform for establishing clear structure-property relationships. Hence, in this review, we first clear up the fundamental relationship between intrinsic charge and spin ordering and electrocatalytic properties. Then, on this basis, we summarize recent attempts to regulate electrical behavior and spin ordering in 2D ultrathin solids to optimize electrocatalytic water-splitting performance. In addition, we highlight the coupling relationship among lattice, charge, and spin ordering in ultrathin electrocatalysts. Finally, we also present some personal perspectives on the challenges and future research directions in this promising area.									154	11	0	0	5	0	154			2451-9294			WOS:000438546100011

The effect of this treatment on the properties of the films was studied by X-ray diffraction, electron microprobe analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, optical and electrical measurements. The changes in the properties, mainly the electrical, are attributed to the fact that the oxygen, originally present at the grain boundaries and linked to indium, is replaced by sulfur: the ln(2)O(3) is then removed from the grain boundaries. The treated films are therefore more suitable for solar cell applications, where transversal parasitic effects are an important issue.

This pseudocatalatic degradation of H2O2 to O-2 is solely dependent oil ascorbate and is blocked by a spin trap, a-phenyl-n-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN), indicating the involvement of free radical species in the reaction process. LmAPX thus appears to catalyze ascorbate oxidation by its peroxidase activity, first generating MDA and H2O with subsequent regeneration of ascorbate by the reduction of MDA with H2O2 evolving O-2 through the intermediate formation of O-2(-). Interestingly, both peroxidase and ascorbate-dependent pseudocatalatic activity of LmAPX are reversibly inhibited by SCN- in a concentration dependent manner. Spectral studies indicate that ascorbate cannot reduce LmAPX compound 11 to the native enzyme in presence of SCN-. Further kinetic Studies indicate that SCN- itself is not oxidized by LmAPX but inhibits both ascorbate and guaiacol oxidation, which Suggests that SCN- blocks initial peroxidase activity with ascorbate rather than subsequent nonenzymatic pseudocatalatic degradation of H2O2 to O-2. Binding studies by optical difference spectroscopy indicate that SCN- binds LmAPX (Kd 100 +/- 10 mM) near the herne edge. Thus, unlike mammalian peroxidases, SCN- acts as an inhibitor for Leishmania peroxidase to block ascorbate oxidation and subsequent pseudocatalase activity.

Experimental results show that ZnO modified with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) or chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) enhances the concentration of oxygen vacancy defects on the surface of ZnO, which can improve the sensitivity of such a ZnO humidity sensor. As compared to AuNPs-modified ZnO, the modification of HAuCl4 reduces the size of ZnO and Au particles and exhibits better humidity performance. This is due to that smaller Au particles can further promote dissociation and electrolysis conduction processes so as to enhance the adsorption activity of HAuCl4-modified ZnO nanocomposites. Humidity experiments indicate that HAuCl4-modified ZnO acquires more than 4 orders of magnitude for the impedance changes in RH range from 11% to 95% with high sensitivity, good linearity, small hysteresis (similar to 2.35%) and short response/recovery time (15s/6 s). The results indicate that smaller Au particle can improve the hysteresis and response of the ZnO humidity sensor. Thus, Au particles with small size are a key parameter for the design of Au modified ZnO humidity sensors with high performance, which has a potential in the fast detection of humidity.									19	1	0	0	0	0	20			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000471748100054

Currently, very little is known about the function of this important pathway or the molecular structures of key players in the hypoxia-sensitive Oriental River Prawn Macro brachium nipponense. In this study, HIFs-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha),-1 beta (HIF-1 beta) and HIF 1-alpha inhibitor (FIH-1) from M. nipponense were cloned. The 4903-bp cDNA of M. nipponense HIF-1 alpha (MnHIF-1 alpha) encodes a protein of 1088 aa, M. nipponense HIF-1 beta (MnHIF-1 beta) spans 2042 bp encoding 663 aa and the 1163 bp M. nipponense NH-1 (MnFIH-1) specifies a polypeptide of 345 aa. MnHIF-1 and MnFIH-1 homologs exhibit significant sequence similarity and share key functional domains with previously described vertebrate and invertebrate isoforms. Phylogenetic analysis identifies that genetic diversification of HIF-1 and FIH-1 occurred within the invertebrate lineage, indicating functional specialization of the oxygen sensing pathways in this group. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that MnHIF-1 and MnFIH-1 mRNA are expressed in different tissues and exhibit transcriptional responses to severe hypoxia in gill and muscle tissue, consistent with their putative role in oxygen sensing and the adaptive response to hypoxia. The role of HIF-1 alpha in response to hypoxia was further investigated in the gills and muscles of prawns using in situ hybridization. These results suggested that HIF-1 alpha plays an important role in oxygen sensing and homeostasis in M. nipponense. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The Cu-m/Cu-W/NiCo-LDH cathode operates both in acidic and alkaline media exhibiting high turnover frequencies (TOF) at 30 mV (0.3 H-2 s(-1) in 1 M KOH and 0.32 H-2 s(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively) and minimal overpotentials of 15 +/- 6 mV in 1 M KOH and 27 +/- 2 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 at -10 mA cm(-2). Cu-m/Cu-W/NiCo-LDH outperforms the activity of 40 wt% Pt/C that needs overpotentials of 22 and 18 mV in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. With a tremendous advantage over Pt/C in triggering proton reduction with fast kinetics, similar mass activity and pH-universality, the current collector demonstrates outstanding operational durability even at above -1 A cm(-2). The high density of electronic states near the Fermi energy level of Cu-Ws is found to be a pivotal factor for efficient electron transfer to the NiCo-LDH catalyst. This class of self-supported electrodes is expected to trigger rapid progress in developing high performance energy conversion and storage devices.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000527022500013	34122858

Owing to the large energy density and significant gravimetric hydrogen content, NH3 is considered an apt next-generation energy carrier and liquid fuel. However, the low conversion efficiency and slow production of ammonia through the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) are currently bottlenecks, making it an unviable alternative to the traditional Haber-Bosch process for ammonia production. The rational design and engineering of catalysts (both photo- and electro) represent a crucial challenge for improving the efficiency and exploiting the full capability of the NRR. In the present review, we highlight recent progress in the development of graphene-based systems and graphene derivatives as catalysts for the NRR. Initially, the history, fundamental mechanism, and importance of the NRR to produce ammonia are briefly discussed. We also outline how surface functionalization, defects, and hybrid structures (single-atom/multiatom as well as composites) affect the N-2 conversion efficiency. The potential of graphene and graphene derivatives as NRR catalysts is highlighted using pertinent examples from theoretical simulations as well as machine learning based performance predictive methods. The review is concluded by identifying the crucial advantages, drawbacks, and challenges associated with principal scientific and technological breakthroughs in ambient catalytic NRR.									10	0	0	0	0	0	9			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000747115200016	34751563

Some methods have been reported for the photocatalytic oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides in recent years. However, the practical application of these processes is undermined by several challenges, such as low selectivity, sluggish reaction rates, the requirement of UV-light irradiation, the use of additives, and the instability of the photocatalyst. Herein, a metal-free C-60/graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) composite photocatalyst was fabricated by a facile method, and well characterized by TEM, SEM, FTIR spectroscopy, XRD, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The C-60/g-C3N4 catalyst exhibited a high photocatalytic activity at room temperature for the selective oxidation of sulfides into the corresponding sulfoxides in the presence of other functional groups, due to the synergetic roles of C-60 and g-C3N4. Several important parameters have been screened, and this method afforded good to excellent yields of sulfoxides under optimal conditions. The superoxide radical (O-center dot(2)-) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) were identified as the oxidative species for the oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides by exploring EPR experiments, and hence, a plausible mechanism for this oxidation was proposed. Moreover, the C-60/g-C3N4 catalyst can be easily recovered by filtration and then reused at least four times without loss in activity.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000439757800021	29797801

This study aims to demonstrate the applicability of layered TiO2 nanosheets as support for designing electrocatalysts. We have demonstrated the performance by decorating the TiO2 support with NiCo2O4 nanoparticles (NiCo2O4/TiO2) as catalysts for electrocatalytic overall water splitting. Moreover, the corrosion effect of usually used carbon-based supporting materials can decrease the working efficiency and, thus, the overall performance of the catalysts. In this aspect, TiO2 can be a better alternative to carbon-based systems. Layered TiO2 was synthesized at room temperature, and a simple heat treatment protocol was employed for the large-scale synthesis of NiCo2O4/TiO2. facilitated the formation of smaller NiCo2O4 nanoparticles, also improving the dispersion. This bifunctional electrocatalyst exhibits high OER and HER performance with a low over-potential of 309 mV and 185 mV respectively, at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2). TiO2 supported catalyst also exhibits other advantages like remarkable durability in the alkaline medium along with high turnover frequency (TOF) values. This inexpensive catalyst can deliver a current density of 10 mAcm(-2). at only 1.64 V with a steady performance for more than 12 h for overall water splitting. Thus, this homemade system provides a proficient and low-cost alternative to the more expensive systems such as RuO2, IrO2 or Pt for the electrochemical water splitting applications.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2196-0216			WOS:000461673300025

Pyrolysis of modern wetland sediment: extracting climate records from fens in the Uinta Mountains and Fish Lake Plateau, Utah, USA								BOREAS				48	3			810	824		10.1111/bor.12378				JUL 2019	2019	Rock-Eval pyrolysis provides a quick, relatively inexpensive means of characterizing organic-rich strata, and has been used for decades to understand global petroleum systems. Although designed to characterize ancient kerogens, pyrolysis is increasingly being used to understand Holocene systems as well. The ability of this technique to distinguish between types of preserved organic matter is useful in characterizing climatic evolution, particularly in systems sensitive to climatic fluctuation such as isolated fens and bogs. Cores collected from the Tokewanna and Garden Basin Cattail fens in central/eastern Utah exhibit variability of organic source, with the mixture of terrestrial and algal sources varying through time, as shown through the hydrogen index (HI) and oxygen index pyrolysis parameters. A sediment core was collected at each fen, and 176 samples were taken from the cores at 6-cm intervals. Total organic carbon (TOC) for all samples ranges from 1.3 to 44.2%, with an average of 18.2% TOC. Samples range from 84 to 687 HI, equivalent to Type I (lacustrine algal) to Type III (terrestrial) organic material (OM). Variability in HI response represents mixing of the two OM sources, and the relative amount of aqueous organic input can be estimated through time based on age-calibrated HI curves at the two sites. The balance of organic input serves as an accurate, high-resolution proxy for climate, and calibration with palynological data near both sites confirms patterns shown by pyrolysis, showing the utility of this method in quickly, affordably and accurately characterizing Holocene sediments for use in understanding palaeoclimate.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0300-9483	1502-3885		WOS:000484327000017

The generation of such emissive reactive species is herein studied. A single parameter, i.e., the gas composition, is tuned and abundant chemical species are obtained in a quite controllable manner. The system refers to a small dielectric barrier discharge based reactor fed with He-N-2/O-2 or Ar-N-2/O-2 gases, which provides plasma in the form of "guided streamers." The plasma is sustained by positive high voltage pulses, and the emissive transitions versus the gas composition is determined by UV-VIS optical emission spectroscopy. The relative intensities of emissive species are recorded in the ambient air where the streamers propagate. The evolution of dominant species as a function of the gas composition is mapped, and optimal conditions in terms of species production are clearly revealed. The results show that additives do not necessarily enhance the density of all species, implying the need for plasma chemistry optimization in respect to every application. The study is extended inside the reactor, supporting the above statements. Finally, the rotational and vibrational distributions of critical probe molecules are recorded, testing the dependence of the gas temperature and energy transfer, respectively, on the gas composition.

Engineering the composition and surface states of an electrocatalyst is critical to improve the intrinsic NRR performance. Here, a facile preparation of Ni nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on V4C3Tx MXene (denoted as Ni@MX) as a highly efficient NRR electrocatalyst is reported. Remarkably, the Ni@MX nanocomposite presents an ammonia yield rate of 21.29 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) at 0.2 mA cm(-2). The presented NRR activity is considerably higher than that of the recently reported MXene derivatives and is even comparable to that of the noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. Combined with various characterization methods and the density functional theory (DFT) simulation, we propose that the improved NRR activity was ascribed to a synergistic NRR route by Ni sites in the nanoparticles and the surface O vacancy of V4C3Tx MXene. Given the remarkable improvement of NRR activity on the MXene-based nanocomposites, this work demonstrates the critical role of MXene and its derivatives with surface modification as electrocatalysts.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11				2052-1537		WOS:000626507700018

Phase identification and its evolution has been examined using high temperature in-situ X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) whereas thermal stability and morphology of compounds have been studied using XRD in combination with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Synthesized SrxNiyOz powder remains stable up to 900 degrees C in air, whereas exposure above 950 degrees C leads to its dissociation into separate SrO and NiO phases. Presence of SrO in powder reacts with H2O and CO2, present in atmospheric air, resulting into pulverization due to volume change and the formation of hydroxides and carbonates. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the pulverized powders show approximately 20% weight loss due to the evaporation of hydroxyl and carbonate groups. Chemical stability of SrxNiyOz is considered essential in order to prevent pulverization and flaking of the getter coating applied over ceramic honeycomb or foam substrates. Chromium getter is considered a cost effective and reliable means to mitigate cathode poisoning in high temperature electrochemical systems such as solid oxide fuel cells, solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) and oxygen transport membranes (OTM).

However, the interpretation of these records in terms of past climate or environmental change remains challenging because of various processes affecting the delta(13) C signals. A process that has only been sparsely discussed so far is carbon isotope exchange between the gaseous CO2 of the cave atmosphere and the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) contained in the thin solution film on the speleothem, which may be particularly important for strongly ventilated caves.Here we present a novel, complete reaction diffusion model describing carbon isotope exchange between gaseous CO2 and the DIC in thin solution films. The model considers all parameters affecting carbon isotope exchange, such as diffusion into, out of and within the film, the chemical reactions occurring within the film as well as the dependence of diffusion and the reaction rates on isotopic mass and temperature. To verify the model, we conducted laboratory experiments under completely controlled, cave-analogue conditions at three different temperatures (10, 20, 30 degrees C). We exposed thin (approximate to 0.1 mm) films of a NaHCO3 solution with four different concentrations (1, 2, 5 and 10 mmol/l, respectively) to a nitrogen atmosphere containing a specific amount of CO2 (1000 and 3000 ppmV). The experimentally observed temporal evolution of the pH and d 13 C values of the DIC is in good agreement with the model predictions. The carbon isotope exchange times in our experiments range from ca. 200 to ca. 16,000 s and strongly depend on temperature, film thickness, atmospheric pCO(2) and the concentration of DIC. For low pCO(2) (between 500 and 1000 ppmV, as for strongly ventilated caves), our time constants are substantially lower than those derived in a previous study, suggesting a potentially stronger influence of carbon isotope exchange on speleothem delta C-13 values. However, this process should only have an influence in case of very long drip intervals and slow precipitation rates. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

S	ATREYA, SK; GU, ZG						Taylor, FW		PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND STABILITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS								ATMOSPHERES OF VENUS AND MARS		ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH		16	6			57	68		10.1016/0273-1177(95)00250-I				1995	1995	An understanding of the composition, structure, transport and photochemical processes of the present atmosphere of Mars is essential for addressing such fundamental questions as the stability, evolution and the origin of the Martian atmosphere. This paper discusses our current knowledge of the photochemistry and stability of the Martian atmosphere, with special emphasis on new models and work in progress. The atmosphere of Mars is composed mainly of CO2 (95.3% by volume), N-2 (2.7%), and Ar-40 (1.6%). Trace constituents, especially H2O vapor (150-200 ppm, average), CO (0.07%), O-2 (0.13%), and ozone (0.03 ppm average) make up the rest. Vertical mixing, characterized by an eddy diffusion coefficient, is of the order of 10(6)cm(2)s(-1) up to 40 km /1,2/, rising to 10(8)cm(2)s(-1) at the homopause (125 km). Photochemistry initiated by the solar ultraviolet dissociation of CO2 and H2O, results in the formation and distribution of the above-mentioned trace constituents. O-2 and CO remain well-mixed and virtually constant because of their long photochemical lifetimes. Ozone shows an anticorrelation with water vapor amounts because of the odd oxygen loss on HOx and H. An intermediate photochemical product in the form of hydroxyl radicals, OH, plays a catalytic role in maintaining the balance between the photodissociative loss of CO2 and its subsequent recycling through a reaction of CO with OH. The homogeneous gas phase chemical reactions, however, do not entirely explain the stability of CO2, O-2, Or CO, thus necessitating the inclusion of heterogeneous adsorption as a loss mechanism for certain species, such as H2O, OH, H2O2, O or O-2 on aerosols of dust or ice suspended in the Martian air /3/. Chlorine catalyzed reactions may be important in maintaining the stability of the Venus atmosphere. Recent detection of formaldehyde (CH2O) at the 0.5 ppm level in the atmosphere of Mars /4/ is puzzling, since the conventional mechanism for its formation - oxidation of methane - would require 0.5-1% CH4 which could not have escaped detection. Even 2-D models require at least a ppm level of CH4, which also would have been detected, if present. Reaction of H with CO to form HCO, and subsequent reaction of HCO with HO2, also would produce CH2O only at a ppb level. Perhaps, a heterogeneous reaction involving long wavelength ultraviolet irradiation of a CO - H2O - CO2 mixture could help; however, laboratory experiments do not yet quantify the yield of formaldehyde. Should the presence of formaldehyde be confirmed after further observations, it would hold a tantalizing possibility of the existence of more complex organics in the interior, surface and the atmosphere of Mars. The virtual lack of organics on Mars could be attributed to the presence of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide.

In this study, we aimed to clarify the phytotoxicity of the mycotoxin patulin (PAT) and reveal its mode of action as a new natural photosystem II (PSII) inhibitor. Phytotoxicity test showed that PAT has herbicidal activity and causes significant leaf lesions on Ageratina adenophora. Under a half-inhibition concentration I-50 (2.24 mu M), the observed significant decrease in oxygen evolution rate and the increase in the J-step of the chlorophyll fluorescence rise OJIP curve indicated that PAT strongly reduces photosynthetic efficiency by blocking electron transport from the primary to secondary plastoquinone acceptors (Q(A) to Q(B)) of PSII. Molecular modeling of PAT docking to the A. adenophora D1 protein suggested that PAT bounds to the Q(B) site by forming hydrogen bonds to histidine 252 in the D1 protein. It is proposed that PAT is a new natural PSII inhibitor and has the potential to be developed into a bioherbicide or used as a template scaffold for discovering novel derivatives with more potent herbicidal activity.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000672594100005	34165302

Herein, a surface rough-cellulose-based bamboo fiber with unique and naturally-convoluted morphology is adopted for the fabrication of catalytically active cobalt substrates for water splitting. For the efficient evolution of hydrogen and oxygen, cobalt-based bimetallic alloys, namely, cobalt-molybdenum and cobalt-iron, were electrodeposited. The proposed system possesses a highly macro-porous network of hexa-filament micro-fibrils that demonstrate exceptional catalytic activities. In quantitative terms, the anodic and cathodic current density of 50 and -10 mA cm(-2) at respective overpotentials (eta) of 250 and 46 mV with a low activation energy (E-a) of 28 kJ mol(-1) were achieved. Moreover, when operated under harsh industrial standards of 5 M KOH@343 K, electrodes demonstrate excellent water electrolyzing catalytic activities (eta(-100(HER)) = 147 mV; eta(100(OER)) = 209 mV). This work, thus, promises a new strategy for designing electrode systems that are highly efficient as well as economical as the substrate was obtained from a ubiquitous earth-friendly material for energy conversion application.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000624755900041

The underlying objective is to build a solar fuel generator which is economically viable and environmentally benign. Hydrogen generation by solar water splitting in photoelectrochemical cells (PEC) is currently experiencing a renaissance, and the search for high performance but low-cost photoelectrode materials is an on-going quest. We present here a photoanode heterostructure of hematite and NiO/alpha-Ni(OH)(2), which is very efficient. We prepared the heterostructure by a "two reactor" hydrothermal modification of a pristine hematite film. The system shows promising current density of 16 mA cm(-2), several times higher than that of the pristine hematite film. In addition, the system shows charge storing capacity once exposed to AM 1.5 simulated sunlight, along with electrochromic behaviour. Interestingly, the water splitting proceeds as a dark reaction after several hours of light exposure. The abrupt increase in current density originates from the oxidized Ni(OH)(2) layer which is absent in the case of pn-junction-like devices made by mere deposition of NiO on hematite by thermal annealing. Hematite alone shows no such behaviour. This kind of new PEC electrode offers a low-cost and simple way for the dual purpose applications of water splitting and charge storage.									34	2	0	0	4	0	34			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000321622500031	23788236

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) results show the Fe3O4 nanospheres disperse well on the MoS2 nanoflake. The presence of characteristic of Fe-O and Mo-O vibrations in the Fe3O4/MoS2 FT-IR spectra indicate the Fe3O4 has been composited with MoS2 successfully. High resolution of O 1s spectrum shows the presence of three types of oxygen including lattice oxygen, hydroxyl groups and S-OH. As expected, the Fe3O4/MoS2 nanostructure modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) has the best electrochemical activity when compared with bare, Fe3O4 or MoS2 modified GCE. The Fe3O4/MoS2 displays excellent electrocatalytic performance on nitrite and Cr(VI) in different electrolytes, respectively. The amperometric response result indicates the Fe3O4/MoS2 modified GCE can be used to determine nitrite concentration in a wide linear range of 1.0-2630 M (R-2 = 0.998) with a detection limit of 0.5 mu M. The Fe3O4/MoS2 is also an effective material for Cr(VI) detection, which is superior to the Cr(VI) sensors reported previously.

J	Xu, Feng; Chang, Limin; Duan, Xiaoyue; Bai, Wenhui; Sui, Xinyu; Zhao, Xuesong								A novel layer-by-layer CNT/PbO2 anode for high-efficiency removal of PCP-Na through combining adsorption/electrosorption and electrocatalysis								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				300				53	66		10.1016/j.electacta.2019.01.090				MAR 20 2019	2019	Electrochemical oxidation is an effective mean to degrade non-biodegradable organics from the contaminated waters. However, its current efficiency is very low for the low-concentration organic pollutants treatment. In this work, combining with the outstanding adsorption property of CNT and the effective electrocatalytic oxidation performance of beta-PbO2, we constructed novel layer-by-layer carbon nanotube/PbO2 anodes (CNT/PbO2-3, CNT/PbO2-4 and CNT/PbO2-5) with high adsorbability to enhance the electrochemical degradation efficiency of low-concentration sodium pentachlorophenate (PCP-Na). In electrochemical oxidation tests, the PCP-Na was rapidly enriched in the CNT/PbO2 film through adsorption/electrosorption and then efficiently degraded in site. The removal efficiency of low-concentration PCP-Na (5 mg/L) on CNT/PbO2-4 reached 73.8% after only 5 min of electrolysis, whereas that on pure PbO2 was only 9.9%. To further clarify the mechanism of improvement of PCP-Na removal on CNT/PbO2-4 anode, the generation capacity of center dot OH radicals, oxygen evolution overpotential, voltammetric charge quantity, interface resistance, and specific surface area of CNT/PbO2-4 anode were also assessed and compared with those of other three anodes. Results showed that, in addition to the synergistic effect of adsorption/electrosorption and electrocatalysis, the more active sites, smaller electron transfer resistance and higher direct oxidation capacity of CNT/PbO2-4 anode also contributed to improving degradation rate of PCP-Na on CNT/PbO2-4 anode. Additionally the electrochemical degradation pathway of PCP-Na was also proposed based on the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Finally, CNT/PbO2-4 electrode exhibited longer accelerated lifetime of 116 h than pure PbO2 electrode (91 h). Thus, these findings provide a new anode to improve the removal of low-concentration organic pollutants through combining electrochemical oxidation and adsorption/electrosorption processes.

During the oxidation process, La(OH)(3) is converted to La2O3 having a mutual effect with the spontaneously generated Co3O4 and the predominant LaCoO3 component. The performances for catalytic benzene oxidation and characterization results indicate that the alkaline treatment of electrospun LaCoO3 can improve the apparent catalytic activity because more surface adsorbed oxygen species and exposed Co3+ are generated. However, if the treatment time reaches 9 h, over-deposition of La(OH)(3)/La2O3 species on the surface may cause a large fraction of active Co species to be inaccessible, resulting in a lower specific activity (2.9 x 10(-6) mol(C6H6) m(-2) h(-1)) compared to that of untreated LaCoO3 (4.8 x 10(-6) mol(C6H6) m(-2) h(-1)). A treatment time of 3 h provides the highest specific activity, 1.01 x 10(-5) mol(C6H6) m(-2) h(-1). Moreover, the obtained catalyst shows deactivation of only 3% benzene conversion in a stability test at 450 degrees C for 48 h. Therefore, NaOH-treated LaCoO3 is a promising catalyst for the practical removal of volatile organic compounds due to its high efficiency, good stability, and convenient preparation.									38	2	0	0	9	0	38			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000394942600017

Images from scanning electron microscopy on the as-synthesized powders exhibited particles in irregular shape at 100-250 nm in size. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of perovskite without the rutile signals from IrO2, suggesting successful incorporation of Ir4+ at the Co cation sites. The carbon nanocapsules (CNCs) were used as an electrocatalyst support. Electrodes for electrochemical measurements were fabricated by depositing mixtures of CNCs, La0.6Ca0.4Co0.8Ir0.2O3 and polymeric binders on commercially available noncatalyzed gas diffusion electrodes. In alkaline electrolyte, the La0.6Ca0.4Co0.8Ir0.2O3/CNCs demonstrated superior performances than those of La0.6Ca0.4Co0.8Ir0.2O3/CNCs and IrO2/CNCs in both charging and discharging current-potential polarization measurements.

In this work, the kinetic property of water photooxidation at TiO2/solution interface, under illumination of simulated sunlight with constant incident light intensity (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm(-2)) and in pH 6-10 solutions (either or not containing carbonate additives), was investigated by using photocurrent measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. Tafel-type behavior was revealed for the potential dependence of photocurrents within a potential region above the photocurrent onset potential. The measured EIS spectra were first analyzed by equivalent electrical circuit (EEC) fitting. Then, by interpreting the Faradaic impedance for the photocharge transfer processes based on a proposed two-step reaction mechanism accounting for the water photooxidation at TiO2 surface, it was shown that more interested and more important kinetic parameters (rate constants and surface coverage of intermediates) can be obtained from the EEC element parameters. Based on the results of this work, novel features for the effects of solution pH and the carbonate addition on the kinetics of water photooxidation were revealed and discussed.									6	2	0	0	2	0	6			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000363274400023

It is still urgently desirable but quite challenging to explore a promising catalyst for CO2 photoreduction due to the severity in the fast recombination of electron holes and the deficiency of active sites, which have a tremendous influence on the catalytic behavior. In this regard, mesoporous TiO2 nanospheres containing oxygen vacancies (OVs) and metallic Au nanoparticles (NPs) were successfully prepared and showed markedly enhanced CO2 reduction activity and CH4 selectivity by the simple combination of photocatalysis with the simultaneous photothermal effect under full-spectrum irradiation. The dual introduction of OVs and a Au/TiO2 Schottky junction can not only serve as an electron sink to significantly improve the charge separation/transfer efficiency but also show effective photothermal conversion to raise the local temperature of the catalyst, thus resulting in an enhanced shuttle of electrons and desorption of products. This study not only offers new insights into the integrated tuning of charge recombination processes but also demonstrates that the photothermocatalysis has great potential in CO2 reduction.									21	1	0	0	3	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000636686200030	33734661

One among the significant challenges is the low kinetics. In this work, we design the urchin-like structure of NiCo2O4 to expose more catalytic sites to accelerate the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion. And the oxygen deficient in NiCo2O4 with spinel type structure (space group Fd3m) leads to the excellent chemical affinity of NiCo2O4-x for LiPSs. Moreover, because of the optimal distribution of electron on (311) plane of NiCo2O4-x, the Gibbs free energies of the evolution from S8 to Li2S on (311) plane of NiCo2O4-x is much lower than that of NiCo2O4, illustrating the NiCo2O4-x with the higher catalytic activity. Therefore, the cell with the NiCo2O4-x modified separator exhibits a superior rate performance (632 mAh g+1 at 2.5 C) and a long cycle life (404 mAh g+1 at 1 C after 800 cycles) with excellent Li+ ion diffusion coefficient. The rational structural optimization makes NiCo2O4-x become the efficient catalyst of LSBs. And the results promote the development of bimetallic oxides as catalyst in LSBs.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000718409100005

The microstructures were investigated by SEM, EBSD, TEM, XRD and nano-indentation. With the addition of TaC, the density of cracks is significantly reduced compared to the pure W. Cellular structures, consisting of W(Ta) solid solution as base and intercellular tungsten carbides (W2C), were observed at different location with various morphologies. Hexagonal and orthorhombic W2C phases were confirmed. The intercellular W 2 C were suggested to be formed by insitu reaction in a divorced eutectic approach during LPBF process. This study provides an effective way to strengthen and refine the W microstructure by a synergistic effect of grain refinement, solid-solution, eutectic and oxygen consumption, thus providing further argument for the novel strengthening method to reduce LPBF W cracks.

For comparison, two other CZA samples were prepared using ammonia and ammonium carbonate as the precipitants, respectively. Differences in the textural, structural and redox properties, together with the evolution upon thermal aging treatment and the catalytic performance of the corresponding Pd-only three-way catalysts, were investigated systematically. The choice of precipitant was found to affect the interactions between CeO2-ZrO2 (CZ) and Al2O3. When ammonia was used as the precipitant, the resulting CZ and Al2O3 seemed insusceptible to each other, thus the obtained CZA composite displayed inferior thermal stability due to the weakest interaction between CZ and Al2O3. In the case of ammonium carbonate, stronger interaction between CZ and Al2O3 enhanced the thermal stability of CZA, but in the meantime, the homogeneity of the CZ solid solution was severely impaired by Al2O3, leading to undesirable redox performance. Fortunately, the use of the composite precipitant brought about favorable interaction between CZ and Al2O3, leading to excellent textural and structural properties along with the highest thermal stability of the CZA compound. Consequently, the corresponding Pd-based catalyst displayed prominent reducibility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) performance, as well as superior three-way catalytic performance.									5	5	0	0	0	1	9			1000-6818			WOS:000384081400021

This study showed that as the MOCVD YBCO film thickness increased above 0.5 mum, defects such as second phase particles, pores, and misaligned grains preferentially nucleated and grew at the YBCO surface. A portion of this defective top layer was eliminated from all the samples using a gas cluster ion beam (GCIB) process that first removed material with a focused argon cluster beam. Next, an oxygen cluster beam was used to smooth the surface and re-oxygenate the YBCO. Comparing the critical current (I-c) measured before and after GCIB processing showed that the I-c remained the same, and even improved, when part of the defective top layer was removed. This microstructural and electromagnetic "dead layer" is believed to be responsible for the overall I-c decrease of MOCVD YBCO films thicker than 0.5 mum. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It does not contain thylakoids, and the photosynthetic apparatus is located in the only membrane of the cell, the plasma membrane. Upon excitation with blue light, the 77 K fluorescence emission spectra of neither intact cells (excited with 427 nm) nor of the isolated plasma membrane (excited with 430 nm), show the expected long wavelength photosystem I emission characteristic for low energy chlorophylls. Maximal fluorescence emission was observed at 688 nm, independent on the excitation wavelength, 427 (430) nm blue light, exciting mainly chlorophyll, or 550 nm green light, exciting mainly phycoerythin. The ratio of P700 to chlorophyll was 175. O-2-evolution was 160 mu mol mg(-1) chlorophyll h(-1) in saturating while light; the compensation point was reached at 6 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in cultures grown at 25 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Dark O-2 uptake was 50 mu mol mg(-1) chlorophyll h(-1). During adaptation to increasing white light intensities Gloeobacter reduces the amount of phycocyanin and chlorophyll per cell and strongly increases the concentration of carotenoids relative to chlorophyll. The carotenoid concentration per cell increases with increasing light intensity. Apparently, part of the carotenoids is not located in the plasma membrane.									36	0	0	0	30	0	36			0031-9317	1399-3054		WOS:A1995RU93100012

Currently, it is crucial yet challenging to explore multifunctional nonprecious electrocatalysts with high activity toward oxygen and hydrogen electrodes. Herein, unique donut-shaped hybrid nanostructure composed of interconnected CoP nanoparticles within P, N co-doped carbon matrix (denoted as CoP@PNC-DoS) was successfully fabricated through a supramolecular assisted one-pot strategy. Thanks to the unique morphology and modulated composition, the CoP@PNC-DoS manifested excellent universal electrocatalytic activity for both oxygen and hydrogen electrodes, where a small potential gap of 0.781 V (Delta E = E-j10-E-1/2) between ORR and OER and a low overpotential of 173 and 160 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 for HER can be achieved. The CoP@PNC-DoS based Zn-air battery could provide an impressive peak power density of 138.57 mW cm(-2), and more importantly, a prominent charge/discharge stability after 150 h/350 cycles under a current density of 30 mA cm(-2), demonstrating its feasibility as cathode electrocatalyst for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. More importantly, a proof-of-concept system integrating Zn-air battery powered water splitting was further built to achieve cost-effective H-2 production.									43	3	0	0	2	0	43			2405-8297			WOS:000529908800004

The concentration of nitrogen doping increased as the nitridation temperature increased, and a small amount of Ta3N5 appeared when nitridized at 700 degrees C. Pure Ta3N5 was obtained by nitridation at 800 degrees C for 6 h. They were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis spectrometry, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. It is concluded that in the N-Ta2O5 samples nitrogen ions have substituted for oxygen ions, creating some oxygen vacancies and extra energy levels within the band gap. Further, Ta3N5 prefers to form on the surface and acts as the recombination center for electrons and holes. Among all samples, nitridation at 650 degrees C resulted in the best photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency that can be explained by more nitrogen doping and no formation of Ta3N5.									18	2	0	0	0	0	18			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000444600300061

The morphology, structure, and composition of bimetallic Au-Cu alloy can be controlled by adjusting the precursor nanofibers through a facile approach. With the increased Cu content, the Au-Cu alloy have a transition from the homogeneous AuCu3 alloy phase to the Au(3)Cn phase with Cu shell. The self-supported bimetallic Au-Cu/CNFs hybrid can be directly employed as electrode materials for water splitting, and it showed excellent electrochemical activity, including long-term stability, high exchange current density, and low overpotential. The outstanding HER performance could be mainly attributed to the synergistic interactions and interfacial effects of Au-Cu alloy with high densities of uncoordinated surface atoms. In addition, the fast charge transport and the fast kinetic for the desorption of the gas were originated from the self supported three-dimensional architectures consist of integrated Au-Cu/CNFs networks. The Au-Cu/CNFs with mass ratio of 1:2 (Au3Cu-Cu "core-shell" alloy) obtain the lowest overpotential of 83 mV (at j = 10 mA cm(-2)), lowest Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1), and highest exchange current density of 0.790 mA cm(-2).

The synthesized BTN with trivalent titanium ion, structural defect, and oxygen vacancy shows a remarkably high absorbance in the visible light spectrum. BTN thus behaves a higher visible-active nanoreactor than white TiO2 nanoparticles (WTN) in the aqueous solution for organic pollutant degradation. Moreover, palladium decoration on the BTN surface (Pd-BTN) demonstrates a fascinating clean energy application. The obtained Pd-BTN fulfills a satisfied green material demand in the photocatalytic hydrogen production application. Pd-BTN calcined at 400. degrees C (Pd-BTN-400) shows the high photocatalytic hydrogen generation rate of 5200 mu mol/g h under UV-A irradiation and 9300 mu mol/g h under UV-B irradiation, respectively. The well-developed material, Pd-BTN-400, could be one of the best solutions in the concern of clean energy and water-purification with regard to the continuous environmental issue.

Mitochondria, intracellular organelles widely known as 'energy factories' of the cell, also play fundamental roles in intermediary metabolism, steroid hormone and heme biosyntheses, calcium signaling, generation of radical oxygen species, and apoptosis. Mitochondria possess a distinct DNA ( mitochondrial DNA); yet, the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear DNA. Mitochondria-related genetic defects have been described in a variety of mostly rare, often fatal, primary mitochondrial disorders; furthermore, they are increasingly reported in association with many common morbid conditions, such as cancer, obesity, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders, although their role remains unclear. This study describes the creation of a human mitochondria-focused cDNA microarray (hMitChip) and its validation in human skeletal muscle cells treated with glucocorticoids. We suggest that hMitChip is a reliable and novel tool that will prove useful for systematically studying the contribution of mitochondrial genomics to human health and disease.									13	0	0	0	13	0	14			1470-269X	1473-1150		WOS:000241383900006	16534508

The p-Si/n-TiO2/n-Fe2O3 csh-NWs, made mainly by solution-processed methods, offer significantly improved performance in the neutral pH water with a low (positive) onset potential and photoactivity at zero bias, due to the increased reaction surface area, effective energy band alignment among p-Si, n-TiO2 and n-Fe2O3 enhancing the charge separation, improved optical absorption, and enhanced gas evolution. Nitrogen modification (annealing under N2) is used to further enhance the csh-NWs photocathodic performance. The PEC tandem cell is then able to handle overall solar water splitting in the neutral pH water with a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 0.18%. The achieved results demonstrate initial steps toward the realization of full PEC devices using earth-abundant materials for solar hydrogen generation suggesting competitive performance when solar matched photoanode core material and co-catalysts are used.

An exciting virtual non-degradation up to 1000 degrees C is presented here for ordered mesoporous gadolinia doped ceria. By using the nanocasting method based on the KIT-6 template, the long-term stability of the material is achieved when extending the self-limited grain growth regime, recently proved for thin films, to open three-dimensional structures. Contrary to widely employed high temperature stabilization treatments inside the template, this work shows the advantage of a counterintuitive and cost-effective thermal treatment at intermediate temperatures, lower than the operation temperature. The evolution of the mesostructure with time at high temperatures, ranging from 800 degrees C to 1100 degrees C, is reported in terms of the microstructure (grain size and specific surface area) and catalytic activity (redox ability and oxygen storage capacity). The possibility of extension of this methodology to almost all metal oxides and the capability of working at temperatures significantly over the state-of-the-art open a new avenue for the use of these high-surface area 3D nanostructures in up-to-now forbidden high temperature energy applications such as solid oxide fuel/electrolysis cells, gas separation membranes or high temperature catalysis.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000331248600035		
J	Cook, Wayne D.; Chen, Fei; Pattison, Derek W.; Hopson, Peyton; Beaujon, Mathieu				Cook, Wayne D/A-4787-2012				Thermal polymerization of thiol-ene network-forming systems								POLYMER INTERNATIONAL				56	12			1572	1579		10.1002/pi.2314				DEC 2007	2007	The thermal polymerization of a tetrafunctional thiol (PETMP) and divinyl ether (TEGDVE) was monitored by temperature-ramping differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the effects of inhibitor type and concentration, oxygen inhibition and initiator type were studied. The incorporation of inhibitors was required to produce a stable system at room temperature. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) inhibited polymerization at low temperatures, but was inefficient at high temperatures and polymerization rates, and hence BHT is an ideal stabilizer. In contrast, a nitroxide inhibitor (NO-67) was a very effective inhibitor and no polymerization occurred until all of the nitroxide was depleted. The presence of oxygen retarded the onset of polymerization but did not change the final conversion significantly. Polymerization with initiators having higher half-life temperatures shifted the DSC peak to higher temperature because the rate of initiator decomposition and thus initiation was slower. Rheological investigations of the cure at different temperatures revealed that the gel time decreased significantly with increasing cure temperature, and the calculated apparent activation energy for PETMP/TEGDVE was 54kJ mol(-1). Dynamical mechanical thermal analysis of the cured material was undertaken and frequency-superposed results revealed that the glass transition region of PETMP/TEGDVE/azobisisobutyronitrile was much narrower than that of free-radically cured dimethacrylate, but was similar to that of an epoxy resin cured with an aromatic diamine. This behaviour could be attributed to PETMP/TEGDVE network homogeneity, or to the less constrained crosslinks in the PETMP/TEGDVE network.

J	Moeller, Philip; Liu, Xiaochen; Schuster, Stefan; Boley, Daniel					Boley, Daniel/0000-0002-2685-8449			Linear programming model can explain respiration of fermentation products								PLOS ONE				13	2					e0191803	10.1371/journal.pone.0191803				FEB 7 2018	2018	Many differentiated cells rely primarily on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for generating energy in the form of ATP needed for cellular metabolism. In contrast most tumor cells instead rely on aerobic glycolysis leading to lactate to about the same extent as on respiration. Warburg found that cancer cells to support oxidative phosphorylation, tend to ferment glucose or other energy source into lactate even in the presence of sufficient oxygen, which is an inefficient way to generate ATP. This effect also occurs in striated muscle cells, activated lymphocytes and microglia, endothelial cells and several mammalian cell types, a phenomenon termed the "Warburg effect". The effect is paradoxical at first glance because the ATP production rate of aerobic glycolysis is much slower than that of respiration and the energy demands are better to be met by pure oxidative phosphorylation. We tackle this question by building a minimal model including three combined reactions. The new aspect in extension to earlier models is that we take into account the possible uptake and oxidation of the fermentation products. We examine the case where the cell can allocate protein on several enzymes in a varying distribution and model this by a linear programming problem in which the objective is to maximize the ATP production rate under different combinations of constraints on enzymes. Depending on the cost of reactions and limitation of the substrates, this leads to pure respiration, pure fermentation, and a mixture of respiration and fermentation. The model predicts that fermentation products are only oxidized when glucose is scarce or its uptake is severely limited.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			1932-6203			WOS:000424325300042	29415045

Simulant MCCI material was synthesised, excluding highly radioactive fission products, containing depleted U, and incorporating Ce as a surrogate for Pu. Multi-modal mu-focus X-ray analysis revealed the presence of the expected suite of U-Zr-O containing minerals, in addition to crystalline silicate phases CaSiO3, SiO2-cristobalite and Ce-bearing percleveite, (Ce,Nd)(2)Si2O7. The formation of perclevite resulted from reaction between the U-Zr-O-depleted Ce-Nd-O melt and the silicate (SiO2) melt. It was determined that the majority of U was present as U4+, whereas Ce was observed to be present as Ce3+, consistent with the highly reducing synthesis conditions. A range of Fe-containing phases characterised by different average oxidation states were identified, and it is hypothesised that their formation induced heterogeneity in the local oxygen potential, influencing the oxidation state of Ce.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2397-2106		WOS:000750312900001

According to 16S rRNA analysis, Chloroflexi species are the earliest branching bacteria capable of photosynthesis, and Cfl. aurantiacus has been long regarded as a key organism to resolve the obscurity of the origin and early evolution of photosynthesis. Cfl. aurantiacus contains a chimeric photosystem that comprises some characters of green sulfur bacteria and purple photosynthetic bacteria, and also has some unique electron transport proteins compared to other photosynthetic bacteria.Methods: The complete genomic sequence of Cfl. aurantiacus has been determined, analyzed and compared to the genomes of other photosynthetic bacteria.Results: Abundant genomic evidence suggests that there have been numerous gene adaptations/replacements in Cfl. aurantiacus to facilitate life under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions, including duplicate genes and gene clusters for the alternative complex III (ACIII), auracyanin and NADH: quinone oxidoreductase; and several aerobic/anaerobic enzyme pairs in central carbon metabolism and tetrapyrroles and nucleic acids biosynthesis. Overall, genomic information is consistent with a high tolerance for oxygen that has been reported in the growth of Cfl. aurantiacus. Genes for the chimeric photosystem, photosynthetic electron transport chain, the 3-hydroxypropionate autotrophic carbon fixation cycle, CO2-anaplerotic pathways, glyoxylate cycle, and sulfur reduction pathway are present. The central carbon metabolism and sulfur assimilation pathways in Cfl. aurantiacus are discussed. Some features of the Cfl. aurantiacus genome are compared with those of the Roseiflexus castenholzii genome. Roseiflexus castenholzii is a recently characterized FAP bacterium and phylogenetically closely related to Cfl. aurantiacus. According to previous reports and the genomic information, perspectives of Cfl. aurantiacus in the evolution of photosynthesis are also discussed.Conclusions: The genomic analyses presented in this report, along with previous physiological, ecological and biochemical studies, indicate that the anoxygenic phototroph Cfl. aurantiacus has many interesting and certain unique features in its metabolic pathways. The complete genome may also shed light on possible evolutionary connections of photosynthesis.									75	1	0	0	68	0	321			1471-2164			WOS:000293577400001	21714912

II - Heavy-Element Nucleosynthesis of s, p, r-Processes								PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS				128	4			741	765		10.1143/PTP.128.741				OCT 2012	2012	We investigate the nucleosynthesis in a massive star of 70 M-circle dot with solar metallicity in the main sequence stage. The helium core mass after hydrogen burning corresponds to 32 M-circle dot. Nucleosynthesis calculations have been performed during the stellar evolution and the jetlike supernova explosion of a collapsar model. We focus on the production of elements heavier than iron group nuclei. Nucleosynthesis calculations have been accomplished consistently from hydrostatic to dynamic stages by using large nuclear reaction networks, where the weak s-, p-, and r-processes are taken into account. We confirm that s-elements of 60 < A < 90 are highly overproduced relative to the solar abundances in the hydrostatic nucleosynthesis. During oxygen burning, p-elements of A > 90 are produced via photodisintegrations of seed s-elements. However, the produced p-elements are disintegrated in later stages except for Ta-180. In the explosive nucleosynthesis, elements of 90 < A < 160 are significantly overproduced relative to the solar values owing to the r-process, which is very different from the results of spherical explosion models. Only heavy p-elements (N > 50) are overproduced via the p-process because of the low peak temperatures in the oxygen- and neon-rich layers. Compared with the previous study of r-process nucleosynthesis calculations in the collapsar model of 40 M-circle dot by Fujimoto et al. [S. Fujimoto, M. Hashimoto, K. Kotake and S. Yamada, Astrophys. J. 656 (2007), 382; S. Fujimoto, N. Nishimura and M. Hashimoto, Astrophys. J. 680 (2008), 1350], our jet model cannot contribute to the third peak of the solar r-elements and intermediate p-elements, which have been much produced because of the distribution of the lowest part of electron fraction in the ejecta. Averaging the overproduction factors over the progenitor masses with the use of Salpeter's IMF we suggest that the 70 M-circle dot star could contribute to the solar weak s-elements of 60 < A < 90 and neutron-rich elements of 90 < A < 160. We confirm the primary synthesis of light p-elements in the ejected matter of high peak temperature. The ejected matter has [Sr/Eu] similar to -0.4, which is different from that of a typical r-process-enriched star CS22892-052 ([Sr/Eu] similar to -1). We find that Sr-Y-Zr isotopes are primarily synthesized in the explosive nucleosynthesis in a similar process of the primary production of light p-elements, which has been considered as one of the sites of a lighter element primary process (LEPP).									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			0033-068X			WOS:000311022200006

Monodisperse similar to 10 nm CoyMn1-yO (0 <= y <= 0.4) nanoparticles were uniformly loaded onto photocatalysts and converted to CoxMn3-xO4 nanoparticles through calcination. 40 mol% cobalt-doped Mn3O4 nanoparticle-loaded Rh@Cr2O3/SrTiO3 photocatalyst exhibited 1.8 times-higher overall water splitting activity than that with pure Mn3O4 nanoparticles. Investigation on the band structure and electrocatalytic water oxidation activity of CoxMn3-xO4 nanoparticles revealed that the Co doping mainly contributes to the improvement of water oxidation kinetics on the surface of the cocatalyst nanoparticles.									43	5	0	0	1	0	45			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000434692000015	29616267

Acoustic layers of the fish at 660-790 m depth dispersed rapidly at least 30-40 m when the camera was approximately 130 m above them. The reaction occurred day and night and prior to activation of the strobe lights, so it was presumably mediated by the low-frequency sound of the system being lowered rather than visually. Orange roughy contain a pronounced lateral line and extensive frontal sensory canal system that may be used to sense low-frequency sound. Our observations indicate that some marine species are highly sensitive even to non-capture sampling gears, so use of non-remote methods of sampling may lead to highly biased estimates of density. The avoidance response is consistent with the relatively high metabolic levels that have been reported for this species, as well as with their very low estimated rates of natural mortality. We speculate that the response has evolved to facilitate escape from large, highly mobile predators.									55	0	0	0	49	0	56			0967-0637			WOS:A1995QN46300003

Following the Interstellar History of Carbon: From the Interiors of Stars to the Surfaces of Planets								ASTROBIOLOGY				16	12			997	1012		10.1089/ast.2016.1484				DEC 2016	2016	The chemical history of carbon is traced from its origin in stellar nucleosynthesis to its delivery to planet surfaces. The molecular carriers of this element are examined at each stage in the cycling of interstellar organic material and their eventual incorporation into solar system bodies. The connection between the various interstellar carbon reservoirs is also examined. Carbon has two stellar sources: supernova explosions and mass loss from evolved stars. In the latter case, the carbon is dredged up from the interior and then ejected into a circumstellar envelope, where a rich and unusual C-based chemistry occurs. This molecular material is eventually released into the general interstellar medium through planetary nebulae. It is first incorporated into diffuse clouds, where carbon is found in polyatomic molecules such as H2CO, HCN, HNC, c-C3H2, and even C-60(+). These objects then collapse into dense clouds, the sites of star and planet formation. Such clouds foster an active organic chemistry, producing compounds with a wide range of functional groups with both gas-phase and surface mechanisms. As stars and planets form, the chemical composition is altered by increasing stellar radiation, as well as possibly by reactions in the presolar nebula. Some molecular, carbon-rich material remains pristine, however, encapsulated in comets, meteorites, and interplanetary dust particles, and is delivered to planet surfaces.									8	1	0	0	2	0	8			1531-1074	1557-8070		WOS:000391853800007	28001448

In this study, we described the molecular characteristics of the noble scallop Chlamys nobilis peroxiredoxin 6 (designed as CnPrx6), immune responses and DNA protection activity of the recombinant protein. The complete ORF (696 bp) of CnPrx6 encoded a polypeptide (25.5 kDa) of 231 amino acids, harboring a conserved peroxidase catalytic center ((PVCTTE46)-P-41) and the catalytic triads putatively involved in peroxidase and phospholipase A2 activities. The deduced amino acid sequence of CnPrx6 shared a relatively high amino acid sequence similarity (more than 50%). The qRT-PCR revealed that the CnPrx6 mRNA was constitutively expressed in all examined tissues, with the highest expression observed in adductor. Upon immunological challenge with Vibrio parahaemolyticus, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), the expression level of CnPrx6 mRNA was significantly upregulated (P < 0.05). Furthermore, there was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the expression level of CnPrx6 between golden and brown scallops. The purified recombinant CnPrx6 protein protected the supercoiled plasmid DNA from metal-catalyzed ROS damage. Taken together, these results indicated that the CnPrx6 may play an important role in modulating immune responses and minimizing DNA damage in noble scallop Chlamys nobilis.									2	2	0	0	2	0	4			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000523603600039	32194249

The study present the evolution of boron profiles following a dry thermal oxidation in poly-Si/SiO2/c-Si films deposited at 520degC and 605degC temperatures and thermally oxidized in dry oxygen at respectively temperature 840degC, 945degC and 1050degC for tr=1h33'duration. The results show that the deposition conditions and the temperature treatment make a very important impact on the obtained films, which affect the redistribution and localization of dopants. It has been observed that the obtained value of the linear and the parabolic rate constant, the diffusion coefficient and the oxidation thickness are higher in the films deposited at Td = 520degC than those deposited at Td = 605degC. Also, the X-ray diffraction is strongly affected by the oxide thickness deposited between poly-silicon layers and crystalline substrates.					3rd International Conference of Computer Science and Renewable Energies (ICCSRE'2020)3rd International Conference of Computer Science and Renewable Energies (ICCSRE'2020)	22-24 Dec. 202022-24 Dec. 2020		Agadir, MoroccoAgadir, Morocco	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2267-1242			INSPEC:20455056

In the present report, the ability is described of these clusters to act as catalysts in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde using molecular O-2 as the primary oxidant and the nitroxyl radical TEMPO as a cocatalyst. A systematic investigation of Mn clusters varied in their R group, oxidation state, and size was conducted in order to realize the electronic requirements that will lead to the best catalytic activity. The best reactivity (>99%) was obtained when the catalyst was the mixed-metal cluster [CeMn6O9(O2CMe)(9)(NO3)(H2O)(2)], which contains Ce4+Mn64+ ions; in this case, lower loadings of catalysts (cluster and TEMPO) are required and the reaction can proceed even without a solvent. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the high efficiency can be only achieved when both high oxidation Ce4+ and Mn4+ ions are present within the same cluster.									59	0	0	0	2	0	59			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000293036000024	21728283

J	Zhao, Chen; Zheng, Mang; Wang, Dan; Li, Qi; Jiang, Baojiang								Enhanced Charge Separation and Transfer of Fe2O3@Nitrogen-Rich Carbon Nitride Tubes for Photocatalytic Water Splitting								ENERGY TECHNOLOGY				8	7					2000108	10.1002/ente.202000108		MAY 2020		JUL 2020	2020	Carbon nitride is widely used in photocatalytic hydrogen production, but it is still difficult to split water without any sacrificial reagent. Herein, nanosized Fe2O3 is combined with 3D nitrogen-rich carbon nitride tubes (ACN), to form an Fe2O3@ACN Z-scheme heterojunction, which accelerates the electrons' transfer from Fe2O3 to ACN and improves the charge separation efficiency. Meanwhile, the bandgap of Fe2O3@ACN is about 2.01 eV, beneficial to the enhancement of visible light absorption capacity. As a result, without any sacrificial agent, the hydrogen evolution rate reaches 3.7 mu mol h(-1) (10 mg catalyst, AM1.5) through water splitting, which is three times that of ACN and 45 times that of bulk C3N4 (GCN). This work provides a new strategy to prompt pure water splitting based on carbon nitride catalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000531298200001

Observation on how the corrosion proceeds in atomic scale is thus critical. Here, using a liquid cell, we studied the real-time corrosion process of palladium@platinum (Pd@Pt) core-shell nanocubes via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results revealed that multiple etching pathways operatively contribute to the morphology evolution during corrosion, including galvanic etching on non-defected sites with slow kinetics and halogen-induced etching at defected sites at faster rates. Corners are the preferential corrosion sites; both etching pathways are mutually restricted during corrosion. Those insights on the interaction of nanostructures with reactive liquid environments can help better engineer the surface structure to improve the stability of electrocatalysts as well as design a new porous structure that may provide more active sites for catalysis.									67	4	0	0	7	0	69			2041-1723			WOS:000427007900003	29520056

Here changes in ion composition within the plasma sheet are explored both during individual events and statistically during 54 calm-to-storm events and during 21 active-to-calm events. Ion composition data from the HOPE (Helium, Oxygen, Proton, Electron) instruments onboard Van Allen Probes satellites provide exceptional spatial resolution and temporal resolution of the H+, O+, and He+ ion fluxes in the plasma sheet. H+ is shown to be the dominant ion in the plasma sheet in the calm-to-storm transition. However, the energy-flux of each ion changes in a quasi-linear manner during extended calm intervals. Heavy ions (O+ and He+) become increasingly important during such periods as charge-exchange reactions result in faster loss for H+ than for O+ or He+. Results confirm previous investigations showing that the ion composition of the plasma sheet can be largely understood (and predicted) during calm intervals from knowledge of (a) the composition of previously injected plasma at the onset of calm conditions and (b) use of simple drift-physics models combined with calculations of charge-exchange losses.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000422735500040

ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				618						A124	10.1051/0004-6361/201833475				OCT 22 2018	2018	The observed sub-class of "superluminous" Type Ia supernovae lacks a convincing theoretical explanation. If the emission of such objects were powered exclusively by radioactive decay of Ni-56 formed in the explosion, a progenitor mass close to or even above the Chandrasekhar limit for a non-rotating white dwarf star would be required. Masses significantly exceeding this limit can be supported by differential rotation. We, therefore, explore explosions and predict observables for various scenarios resulting from differentially rotating carbon-oxygen white dwarfs close to their respective limit of stability. Specifically, we have investigated a prompt detonation model, detonations following an initial deflagration phase ("delayed detonation" models), and a pure deflagration model. In postprocessing steps, we performed nucleosynthesis and three-dimensional radiative transfer calculations, that allow us, for the first time, to consistently derive synthetic observables from our models. We find that all explosion scenarios involving detonations produce very bright events. The observables predicted for them, however, are inconsistent with any known subclass of Type Ia supernovae. Pure deflagrations resemble 2002cx-like supernovae and may contribute to this class. We discuss implications of our findings for the explosion mechanism and for the existence of differentially rotating white dwarfs as supernova progenitors.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1432-0746			WOS:000447823800001		
J	Kong, Zhen-kai; Chen, Yang; Hua, Jing-zhao; Zhang, Yong-zheng; Zhan, Liang; Wang, Yan-li								Ultra-thin 2D MoO2 nanosheets coupled with CNTs as efficient separator coating materials to promote the catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries								NEW CARBON MATERIALS				36	4			810	818		10.1016/S1872-5805(21)60080-X		AUG 2021		AUG 2021	2021	The severe shuttle effect and slow kinetics of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) conversion are two major obstacles to the practical application of lithium sulfur batteries. Ultra-thin 2D MoO2 nanosheets (MoO2 NSs) have been synthesized by chemical vapor deposition and then mixed with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using as coating materials of the Celgard 2400 polypropylene separator to solve these problems. The 2D character of MoO2 NSs produced high surface/volume ratios and abundant active binding sites for anchoring LiPSs. In addition, the partial reduction of MoO2 NSs in a H-2/Ar mixture introduced oxygen vacancies in their surface, which acted as catalytic sites for LiPS conversion, while the CNT network ensured rapid electron transfer for LiPS conversion reactions. Symmetric dummy cell tests showed that a 30wt%MoO2/CNT coated separator reduced the energy barrier for Li2S nucleation, and first-principles calculations verified its strong binding energy to entrap LiPSs and increase Li2S precipitation. Because of these features, a cell with a 30wt%MoO2/CNT coated separator had an improved specific capacity of 738 mAh.g(-1) at 1 C with a slow decay rate of 0.053% for 800 cycles.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1007-8827	1872-5805		WOS:000686551900010

This technique has been used here to follow tungsten oxidation during reactions performed under 1.3 Pa of oxygen both above and below the temperature of the phase transition: ortho-rhombic alpha-WO3 --> tetragonal alpha'WO3.We show that the difference between the observed radiative behaviour is due to the difference between the morphology of these oxides (alpha-WO3 is homogeneous and alpha'WO3 is porous).From this difference, with an optical model using an effective medium theory (Bruggeman equation), we show that it is possible to describe correctly the experimental measures and to calculate the value of the porosity of the film during-its growth. In this model, we show that the best value of the depolarization factor for the oxide particles is 1/3. This is Precisely the value that characterizes a porous deposit where the particles (here, oxide particles) are spherical; it is also a good approximation for particles deprived of a particular shape (geometrically isotropic) and disposed at random, such as what we have effectively observed by scanning electron microscopy.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0142-2421			WOS:A1992JE10000019

During the pyrolysis, the core-matrix structure of intimate nanosized ZrO2 and amorphous carbon mixture forms, resulting in short diffusion path and limit of grain growth. ZrC first appears at a much lower temperature of 1200 degrees C and completes conversion at 1400 degrees C in comparison with that of precursor without hydrothermal treatment. By raising the heating temperature to 1600 degrees C, oxygen content could be reduced (0.55 wt%) with a low residual carbon content (2.3 wt%), and the average size of the spherical crystallite increases from 100 nm to 200 nm. Based on above ZrC powders, the additive-free ceramic with 99.4% relative density by spark plasma sintering (SPS) at a low temperature of 1700 degrees C has been achieved.

The purpose of this work was to study in detail the process of an active Ba-Ru/C catalyst formation. Another goal was to characterize the active state of the Ba promoter, that is the state corresponding to ammonia synthesis conditions. In situ XRD and TPR-MS techniques were applied to monitor the changes in the Ba-Ru/C specimens when heating in hydrogen (or H-2 + N-2) and H-2 + Ar mixtures, respectively. The post-activation state of the catalyst was characterized chemically via interaction of the reduced samples with water vapour at 50 degrees C and also via interaction with oxygen at 0 degrees C. The above mentioned experiments were supplemented with those of ammonia synthesis. It was shown that ruthenium facilitates decomposition of the promoter's precursor (Ba(NO3)(2)) deposited onto the surface of Ru/C catalysts when heating the specimens in a hydrogen-containing stream. The Ba(NO3)(2)/C reference materials, which do not contain ruthenium, are stable in a flowing H-2 + Ar mixture up to about 400 degrees C. whereas the Ba(NO3)(2) decomposition starts at 100-120 degrees C in the Ba(NO3)(2)-Ru/C systems (XRD, TPR-MS). The decomposition of Ba(NO3)(2) in hydrogen leads to barium oxide (BaO) and metallic barium. Under steady-state conditions BaO is the only Ba-containing phase detected by the X-ray diffraction technique. Characterization of the post-activation catalysts showed that barium is partially reduced during the aforementioned operations and that these catalysts react with oxygen and water vapour. Based on the comparison of the O-2 consumption and H-2 evolution data one may deduce that the active form of the promoter is a mixture: Ba-o + BaO. It can be stated that the temperature and content of the promoter (C-Ba) have a significant influence on NH3 formation. The shape of reaction rate vs. barium content function is assumed to be an outcome of the promoter distribution on the active carbon surface and ruthenium surface. The trend of the integral reaction rate clearly reflects that of the Ru coverage by the barium-containing species, which is controlled by the heats of adsorption on ruthenium and carbon, respectively.

The reaction is initiated by CO2- radicals produced in anaerobic, aqueous solutions of the enzyme by microsecond pulses of radiation. A sequence of pulses of CO, radicals enables examination of the reductive half cycle of the MCO catalysis. This is done by titrations of the Type 1 (Ti) Cu(II) site and monitoring of the time course and amplitude of its reoxidation by internal electron transfer (ET) to the Type 3 site. Comparison of the internal ET kinetics observed for mgLAC with those of other MCOs studied by pulse radiolysis shows that they exhibit distinct reactivities. One main cause for the different reactivities is the broad range of T1 copper redox potentials, from the moderate potential of bacterial enzymes to the high potential of fungal laccases, and this possibly also reflects evolutionary quaternary structural adaptation of the MCO family to the wide range of reducing substrates that they oxidize while maintaining efficient reduction of the common substrate, molecular oxygen.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0006-2960			WOS:000377151100007	27126506

The plasma plume and plasma chemistry were generated by focusing a 6-mm diameter, 212 mJ, 1064-nm nanosecond Nd:YAG laser to a spot size of about 1 mm diameter over graphite samples of 99.9% pureness. The atomic emissions C I 247.86 nm, N I 821.50 nm and O I 777.19 nm, and the molecular bands C2 (473.71 nm) and CN (359.04 nm and 388.30 nm) were monitored as a function of time (0.2 to 220 mu s). While the C I and C-2 emissions followed a near-exponential decay, the CN emission in air and nitrogen showed an emission behavior characterized by two local maxima at 0.2 mu s and 20-30 mu s after the plasma ignition. The first maximum was explained by the early plasma chemistry produced by the ablated carbon species and the confining background gas, whereas the second maximum was attributed to atomic recombination and shock wave-induced excitation of the plasma plume. Two main effects were observed when the ablation was produced in different background gases. First, the presence of oxygen (approximate to 21%) in air had a negligible effect on atomic lines; however, the CN emission intensity and lifetime were significantly reduced in comparison with an atmosphere of 100% nitrogen. This was attributed to the reduction of nitrogen species as reaction partners during the plasma chemistry in air. Secondly, due to the assumed higher plasma temperature in Ar, this gas favored the emission intensity and lifetime of atomic species but hindered the formation of C2 species. Because the collection optics of the emission spectroscopy system was configured in backscatter mode, which integrates over the entire plasma volume and gate time without spatial resolution, the time-resolved behavior of the plasma emissions were only related to the number density of emitters but not to specific locations in the plasma volume.					41st International Colloquium on Spectroscopicum (CSI) / 1st Latin American Meeting on Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LAMLIBS)41st International Colloquium on Spectroscopicum (CSI) / 1st Latin American Meeting on Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LAMLIBS)	JUN 09-14, 2019JUN 09-14, 2019		Mexico City, MEXICOMexico City, MEXICO	10	0	0	0	2	0	10			0584-8547			WOS:000525417000016

P	WARNER N								Capture of energy released by complete combustion of carbon monoxide from smelting reduction by providing fully-backmixed melt circulation, protecting graphite walls and roof components, and maintaining carbon dioxide high partial pressures					WO2008017797-A1	WARNER N																			NOVELTY - Capture of energy released by complete combustion of carbon monoxide emanating initially from smelting reduction or carbothermic reduction associated with the processing of metal containing feeds such as lump ores, ore fines, concentrates, and waste streams, comprises provision of fully-backmixed melt circulation with melt surface dimensions and melt circulation rate; protection of graphite walls (2) and roof components (13) in contact with the oxidizing post combustion gases (14); and maintenance of high partial pressures of carbon dioxide in the post combustion gases. USE - The method is for capturing energy released by complete combustion of CO emanating initially from smelting reduction or carbothermic reduction associated with the processing of metal containing feeds such as lump ores, ore fines, concentrates, and waste streams. The mineral being smelted is ilmenite or titaniferous magnetite. (all claimed) ADVANTAGE - Principal wall and roof areas are protected by reducing the already low values of the mass transfer coefficients by a factor of 30, using CO transpiration under a total pressure gradient opposed to the direction of CO2 to provide service lives of 1-5 years. The exceptionally good mechanical and thermal shock properties of baked carbon or graphite below 2200degreesC and closer to 2100degreesC level actually required for effective radiant post combustion to a melt with a surface temperature in the region of 1900degreesC, ensure structural stability under the proposed very demanding conditions. The method secures the lowest possible energy route practically achievable on a large scale. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Capture of energy released by complete combustion of carbon monoxide (CO) emanating initially from smelting reduction or carbothermic reduction associated with the processing of metal containing feeds such as lump ores, ore fines, concentrates, and waste streams by direct radiative heat transfer within the confines of a single furnace enclosure incorporating both post combustion and chemical reaction functions to melts at up to 2200degreesC located immediately below the particular combustion zone, and thus receiving direct gas radiation, comprises provision of fully-backmixed melt circulation with melt surface dimensions and melt circulation rate, such that the rate per unit bath area or flux of CO evolution is uniform throughout the length of the reactor. Thus, an upwards flowing laminar layer of CO in which the Reynolds number is less than 2000 is provided, so that a protective gas blanket 0.5-1.5 m in thickness is formed between the melt surface and the combustion zone in which gaseous oxidant (oxygen plus recycled carbon dioxide (CO2)) is admitted to the upwards laminar flowing CO with the effect that the Reynolds number is increased to 5000; and thus still only a relatively low level of turbulence established. The graphite walls (2) and roof components (13) in contact with the oxidizing post combustion gases (14) are protected, recognizing that at the very high gas temperatures involved, the oxidation of carbon is controlled exclusively by gaseous diffusion from the bulk gas through the boundary layer to the solid carbon surface. The gas phase mass transfer coefficient itself is dependent on the level of turbulence in the upwards flowing post combustion gases, which at the Reynolds Number of 5000, is already restricted but realistically, the already low mass transfer coefficient can be reduced still further by a factor of 30 by modest rates of transpiration of CO such as 1.6x10-4 kmol/sm2 through the graphite surfaces, opposed to the direction of CO2 diffusion, under the influence of a total pressure gradient dictated by the permeability of the particular grade of graphite selected. High partial pressures of CO2 in the post combustion gases is maintained by avoiding dilution with nitrogen using tonnage oxygen rather than air so that gas radiation is enhanced by the associated increase in emissivity and thus the area of melt surface required for a given endothermic reaction requirement is reduced, while at the same time because of the high concentration of CO2 in the effluent gas, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is simplified. An oxidic melt (10) passes in sequence through a smelting reduction melt circulation loop reactor (SRR1), optionally through a second smelting reduction melt circulation loop reactor, and then to a continuous vacuum refining melt circulation loop, in which gas radiative heat transfer is not a viable option on the low pressure arm, because gas emissivities at very low pressures in the region of 1 mbar are too low to sustain thermal transport.

In this paper, four different soot models have been evaluated for the high temperature, high pressure combusting dodecane spray cases of engine combustion network (ECN) spray A which mimics engine-relevant conditions. The soot models considered include an empirical, a multistep, a method of moments based, and a discrete sectional method soot model. Two experimental cases with ambient oxygen volume of 21% and 15% have been modeled. A good agreement between simulations and experiments for vapor penetration and heat release rate has been obtained. Quasi-steady soot volume fraction contours for the four soot models have been compared with experiments. Contours of the species and source terms involved in soot modeling have also been compared for a better understanding of soot processes. The empirical soot model results in higher magnitude and spread of soot due to a lack of modeling framework for oxidation through OH species. Among the four models studied, the multistep soot model has been observed to provide the most promising agreement with the experimental data in terms of distribution of soot and location of peak soot volume fraction. Due to a two-way coupling of soot models, the detailed models predict an upstream location for soot as compared to the multi-step soot model which is one way coupled. A significant difference (of an order of magnitude) in the concentration of PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) precursor between multistep and detailed soot models has been observed because of precursor consumption due to the coupling of detailed soot models with chemical kinetics. It is recommended that kinetic schemes, especially those concerning PAH, be validated with experimental data with a kinetics-coupled soot model.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0954-4070	2041-2991		WOS:000682551900001

The in vivo activity of the bidirectional [NiFe]hydrogenase [H-2:NAD(P) oxidoreductase], encoded by the hoxEFUYH genes, was also measured independently by the proton-deuterium (H-D) exchange reaction in the presence of D-2 This technique allowed us to demonstrate that the hydrogenase was insensitive to light, was reversibly inactivated by 02, and could be quickly reactivated by NADH or NADPH (+H-2). H-2 was evolved by cells incubated anaerobically in the dark, after an adaptation period. This dark H-2 evolution was enhanced by exogenously added glucose and resulted from the oxidation of NAD(P)H produced by fermentation reactions. Upon illumination, a short (less than 30-s) burst of H-2 output was observed, followed by rapid H-2 uptake and a concomitant decrease in CO2 concentration in the cyanobacterial cell suspension. Uptake of both H-2 and CO, was linked to photosynthetic electron transport in the thylakoids. In the ndhB mutant M55, which is defective in the type I NADPH-dehydrogenase complex (NDH-1) and produces only low amounts of O-2 in the light, H-2 uptake was negligible during dark-to-light transitions, allowing several minutes of continuous H-2 production. A sustained rate of photoevolution of H-2 corresponding to 6 mumol H-2 mg of chlorophyll(-1) h(-1) or 2 ml of H-2 liter(-1) h(-1) was observed over a longer time period in the presence of glucose and was slightly enhanced by the addition of the O-2 scavenger glucose oxidase. By the use of the inhibitors DCMU [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea] and DBMIB (2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone), it was shown that two pathways of electron supply for H-2 production operate in M55, namely photolysis of water at the level of photosystem 11 and carbohydrate-mediated reduction of the plastoquinone pool.									185	2	2	0	136	0	195			0021-9193	1098-5530		WOS:000220098900019	14996805

However, the fast electron-hole recombination on the surface of BiVO4 photoanode impairs its photoelectrochemical oxidation performance. In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, that a cobalt-polyoxometalate (Ag-10[Co-4(H2O)(2)(PW9O34)(2)], PW9Co) is exploited as a hole extraction layer on the surface of BiVO4 photoanode for boosting photoelectrochemical activity by promoting hole extraction and transfer. Compared to the pure BiVO4 photoanode, the PW9Co-modified BiVO4 photoanode in photoelectrochemical water oxidation reaction exhibited a higher photocurrent density of 3.06 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G illumination, achieving a 3.3-fold improvement in photocurrent density. Furthermore, we performed a photoelectrochemical reaction of oxidizing benzyl alcohol into benzaldehyde, in which the reaction yield of using the modified BiVO4 photoanode is significantly superior to the pure BiVO4 photoanode. These results prove that a rational selection of cobalt-polyoxometalate as a hole extraction layer can efficiently enhance the photoelectrochemical oxidation activity of BiVO4 photoanode.

The obtained catalysts were used in the selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde with H2O2 as the oxidant, the prepared bimetallic Cu-Cr catalysts outperformed their monometallic counterparts, and the highest benzaldehyde yield can reach 42.9% within 5 h under mild reaction conditions. It was found that some metal oxides were coated with g-C3N4 to form a core/shell-like structure, which hindered the metal leaching. XPS analysis indicated the presence of some low valence Cu species and the electronic interactions between the Cu and Cr species. The bimetallic Cu-Cr catalysts had a larger specific surface area and pore volume compared to the monometallic ones. Besides, the effects of the reaction parameters on catalytic activity were investigated in detail. The kinetics study indicated that toluene oxidation was a first order reaction and the apparent activation energy was calculated to be 24.3 kJ mol(-1). The recycling tests verified the good reusability of the prepared catalyst, making it promising in the future practical catalysis application. Finally, a possible reaction mechanism for the selective oxidation of toluene over the supported catalyst was proposed.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000480640900025

In this work, a NiCu-based core-shell 3D electrode is obtained by electrodeposition and surface electrochemical reconstruction on the nickel foam substrate. The physical characterization results confirm the core-shell structure with NiCu as the core and Cu(OH)(2) and NiOOH as the shell. In the 3D electrode, the metal core continuously transfers charge to the surface to transform into active species (NiCu hydroxides), thus accelerating the slow ammonia oxidation reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the 3D porous structure is conducive to the rapid diffusion and transport of ions, which effectively improves the fuel depletion boundary layer problem. Consequently, electrochemical tests indicate that the NiCu@NiCuOOH-NF electrode show excellent ammonia oxidation reaction activity and good stability, reaching a maximum current density of 90 mA cm(-2) at the potential of 0.7 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE). When 2 M NaOH + 3 M NH4Cl is adopted as fuel for the DAMFC, an open circuit voltage of 0.72 V and a peak power density of 17.1 mW cm(-2) can be obtained, while the limiting current density is as high as 102 mA cm(-2).

Subsequently, a typical microwave-assisted polyol method is used to support Pt nanoparticles (NPs) on this composite to synthesize Pt/CNTs@C@Fe-Mo2C catalyst. Relevant structural characterization show Fe exists in the form of metal in the catalyst, and the Mo2C particles and Pt nanoparticles with small crystalline size are evenly dispersed on nanotubes. Additionally, Pt/CNTs@C@Fe-Mo2C catalyst has a commendable effect on methanol electrooxidation reaction (MOR) in acidic electrolyte (1.317 A mg(Pt)(-1)), as well as in alkaline environment (3.200 A mg(Pt)(-1)), moreover, its stability and anti-poisoning ability towards CO analogues have also been greatly improved. In short, these excellent results could be attributed that metallic Fe acted as an accelerant is conducive to anchoring Pt NPs and Mo2C particles onto CNTs@C, increasing the interplay between catalyst nanoparticles and support as well as reinforcing the auxiliary catalysis of Mo2C particles in Pt-based electrocatalyst, which lead the catalyst to superior catalytic activity, long-term stability and resistance for MOR, therefore, the Pt/CNTs@C@Fe-Mo2C catalyst is a right option for Pt-based electrocatalyst to inspire methanol electrooxidation.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000510846500172

After withdrawing the substrate at a constant rate. the films were dried between 100 and 300 degrees C for various periods of time (15 min to 1 h). Based primarily on the cyclic voltammetric behavior of the SC-formed Ni-Co films after drying at high temperatures. it is suggested that both the Ni and Co sites undergo redox reactions in I M NaOH solutions. This also explains the high charge efficiency and charge density of SC-derived, Go-containing Ni oxide films. Careful optimization of the experimental variables in the SG film preparation route indicated that the use of 50:50 Ni-Co sols, a withdrawal rate of 6 cm/min, and drying at 250 degrees C for 1 h yields films which display the highest charge density, the most rapid redox kinetics, and good stability to prolonged potential cycling. In addition, the charge capacity of the optimized 50:50 Ni-Co SG oxide films can be increased further by the deposition of multilayers. The redox kinetics of the optimized coatings in 1 M NaOH solution were superior ro those for Ni:Co oxide films of comparable charges. but formed in other ways. Diminished reaction rates resulted when higher film drying temperatures were used (denser films) and when thicker, multilayered films were formed. (C) 2000 The Electrochemical Society.

Among various O-O bond formation mechanisms investigated in this study, the most favorable pathway involved the nucleophilic attack of OH- onto the L center dot+-Cu-II-OH- intermediate. During such process, the initial binding of OH- to the proximity of L center dot+-Cu-II-OH- would result in the spontaneous oxidation of OH-, leading to OH center dot radical and Cu-II-OH- species. The further O-O coupling between OH center dot radical and Cu-II-OH- was associated with a barrier of 14.8 kcal mol(-1), leading to the formation of H2O2 intermediate. Notably, the formation of "Cu-III-O center dot-" species, a widely proposed active species for O-O bond formation, was found to be thermodynamically unfavorable and could be bypassed during the catalytic reactions. On the basis the present calculations, a catalytic cycle of the mononuclear copper complex-catalyzed water oxidation was proposed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000760041400001	35080143

Herein, the subnanometer Ag/AgCl clusters were incorporated on atomically thin defective Bi12O17Cl2 nanosheets via rebinding with unsaturated Cl atoms. Benefiting from the surficial Bi vacancies (VBi) and Bi-O vacancies (VBi-O) in this atomically thin architecture, the local atomic arrangement was tuned so that the subnanometer Ag/AgCl clusters were successfully incorporated. An enhancement of photocatalytic activity for NO removal was achieved in which the activity is 3 times higher than that of Bi12O17Cl2 and 1.8 times higher than that of defective Bi12O17Cl2. The substitution of the active sites from surficial VBi and VBi- O to be subnanometer Ag/AgCl clusters enables a tunable redox potential and different reaction mechanisms in NO removal. Moreover, the selectivity of the photoinduced redox reaction on NO oxidation and CO2 reduction was achieved via introducing an extra energy level.									10	0	0	0	3	0	10			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000623228500133	33586427

In this study, we demonstrated the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of vertically aligned MoO2/MoS2 flakes by using sulfur and molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) powders as precursors. Moreover, based on various experimental measurements, a detailed growth mechanism is proposed for elucidating the conversion of MoO2 to MoS2 in the CVD process to achieve vertically aligned MoO2/MoS2 flakes. Our results reveal that two competing pathways for sulfurization reactions occur during the CVD growth process: the dominance of the reactions in the vapor-phase pathway facilitates the formation of parallel-aligned MoS2 flakes, while the dominance of the reactions in the solid-phase pathway determines the formation of vertically aligned MoO2/MoS2 flakes. In addition, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity of the vertically aligned MoO2/MoS2 flakes was evaluated for hydrogen production applications based on PEC water splitting. Our results open the door to promote the process for designing the growth of other TMD materials or complex structures, which can be beneficial for use in various applications.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000510846500099

In this process, the protons and electrons generated from the water-oxidation reaction at an anode are used during the reduction of CO2 at a cathode, in order to produce high-value hydrocarbon chemicals. Therefore, water oxidation is also a key reaction for the overall electron-mediated CO2-to-chemical conversion. In this work, a facile preparation method is developed for a highly efficient water oxidation electrocatalyst which stably operates in a neutral bicarbonate electrolyte optimized for CO2-reduction conditions. Ni-rich cratered structures were spontaneously formed on the stainless steel surface by harsh electro-oxidation, and the chemical composition changes of Fe and Ni on the catalyst surface dramatically enhance wateroxidation activity showing an overpotential value of 504 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in a CO2-saturated bicarbonate electrolyte. In contrast to a severe degradation in the phosphate electrolyte, the cratered stainless-steel (CSS) catalyst is very stable for an 18 h reaction in the bicarbonate electrolyte. Surface spectroscopic analyses of CSS consistently revealed that the active-surface structure of the NiOOH and adsorbed water molecules is remarkably stable throughout water-oxidation in the neutral bicarbonate electrolyte, while the destruction of Ni structures by the phosphate electrolyte is proposed to cause concomitant activity loss for water oxidation.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000411232100033

This area is one of the two sites that have been investigated, under the financial patronage of the Swedish Nuclear Waste and Management Co. (SKB), as possible candidates for hosting the proposed repository for the long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel. The classical geochemical modelling, interpreted in the light of the palaeohydrogeological history of the system, has shown that the driving process in the geochemical evolution of this groundwater system is the mixing between four end-member waters: a deep and old saline water, a glacial meltwater, an old marine water, and a meteoric water. In this paper we put the focus on mixing and its effects on the final chemical composition of the groundwaters using a comprehensive methodology that combines principal component analysis with mass balance calculations. This methodology allows us to test several combinations of end member waters and several combinations of compositional variables in order to find optimal solutions in terms of mixing proportions. We have applied this methodology to a dataset of 287 groundwater samples from the Laxemar area collected and analysed by SKB. The best model found uses four conservative elements (Cl, Br, oxygen-18 and deuterium), and computes mixing proportions with respect to three end member waters (saline, glacial and meteoric). Once the first order effect of mixing has been taken into account, water-rock interaction can be used to explain the remaining variability. In this way, the chemistry of each water sample can be obtained by using the mixing proportions for the conservative elements, only affected by mixing, or combining the mixing proportions and the chemical reactions for the non-conservative elements in the system, establishing the basis for predictive calculations.

Despite current studies have shown that the gene family are involved in plant growth and developmental processes and biotic and abiotic stress responses, little is known about its functional role in upland cotton.Results: In the present study, we comprehensively analyzed the characteristics of the SOD gene family in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). Based on their conserved motifs, 18 GhSOD genes were identified and phylogenetically classified into five subgroups which corroborated their classifications based on gene-structure patterns and subcellular localizations. The GhSOD sequences were distributed at different densities across 12 of the 26 chromosomes. The conserved domains, gene family evolution cis-acting elements of promoter regions and miRNA-mediated posttranscriptional regulation were predicted and analyzed. In addition, the expression pattern of 18 GhSOD genes were tested in different tissues/organs and developmental stages, and different abiotic stresses and abscisic acid, which indicated that the SOD gene family possessed temporal and spatial specificity expression specificity and may play important roles in reactive oxygen species scavenging caused by various stresses in upland cotton.Conclusions: This study describes the first genome-wide analysis of the upland cotton SOD gene family, and the results will help establish a foundation for the further cloning and functional verification of the GhSOD gene family during stress responses, leading to crop improvement.									55	6	0	0	47	1	61			1471-2164			WOS:000401577000004	28499417

Herein, we report the facile synthesis of NiCo2S4 and its first use as a highly active and cost-affordable cocatalyst to boost visible light H-2 generation with the CdS semiconductor. The synthesized NiCo2S4/CdS composite materials are fully characterized by various techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-Vis diffusion reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and N-2 adsorption measurements. With the optimized NiCo2S4/CdS composite sample, a high H-2 generation rate of 137 mmol h(-1) is obtained under visible light irradiation, which is more than 17 times higher than that of bare CdS material. The results of photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrate the remarkably promoted migration and separation of photogenerated charge carriers over the heterostructured NiCo2S4/CdS material, thus leading to obviously enhanced photocatalytic performance. Moreover, a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction is also proposed based on the observed results of activity evaluation and photoelectrochemical measurements.									39	1	0	0	6	0	39			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000412275200012	28929150

Many RCM designs were historically used for the latter purpose. First, the flat piston configuration was extensively used and contributed to valuable ignition delay data. Temperature heterogeneity in these devices was later addressed, and new designs were proposed. In particular, creviced piston configurations have been demonstrated to enhance the temperature homogeneity in the bulk volume of RCM chambers. Nevertheless, data from flat piston RCMs are still used in the community. Thus, additional understanding of experimental results from such devices is still useful, and it also helps to enhance the understanding of temperature stratification effects on auto ignition phenomena.This paper addresses the interpretation of measured ignition delays from a flat piston RCM (without a circumferential crevice in the piston). First, we characterize local and temporal temperature evolution with a toluene planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) technique applied in oxygen-free gas under different test conditions. At a compression pressure (P-c) of 11 bar and an adiabatic core temperature (T-c) of 750 K, we find that the maximum measured temperature is very close to T-c up to 30 ms after the compression stroke. In the second step, we qualitatively compare temperature fields with chemiluminescence images during the auto-ignition of n-hexane and an n-heptane/methyl-cyclohexane (MCH) blend for a fuel-air equivalence ratio of 0.4, P-c values of 11 bar and 16 bar and T-c values of 700-900 K. The chemiluminescence results of n-hexane show a fast sequential auto-ignition which strongly suggest that the combustion propagation regime is mainly a reaction fronts regime. In the n-heptane/MCH case, the tracking of ignition kernels demonstrates that the auto-ignition initiates in the cold vortex at 71 values of 787 K and 834 K and in the adiabatically compressed region at T-c values of 742 K and 900 K.In this study, flat piston RCM experiments demonstrate temperature heterogeneities with ranges up to 120 K and gradients of approximately 160 K/mm. This significantly influences the ignition delay measurement in the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) range. Through the example of n-heptane/MCH auto-ignition, it seems that despite temperature heterogeneities, the lower limit of the NTC range is well detected, whereas the higher limit is over-estimated. The determination of temperature thresholds in which ignition delay data may be confounded highly depends on the stratification level and on complex thermo-kinetic interactions. Outside these thresholds, when combustion is dominated by auto-ignition in regions at the adiabatic core temperature, the experimental data are easier to compare with simulation frameworks assuming a homogeneous hypothesis. In chemical kinetics-oriented studies, temperature heterogeneity should be considered when flat piston RCMs are used and when the piston crevice is not adequate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

With the focus mainly on their synthesis by cost-effective process as thin films, the aspect of their stability and reactivity as transparent layers against both UV radiation and oxidation under wet medium due to their oxygen deficiency has so far not been investigated. This work covers the synthesis as well as the structural, electrical and the wettability properties of ZnMoO4 thin films which have been prepared by the spray pyrolysis method on glass substrates at 460 degrees C. First, X-ray diffraction analysis shows that this oxide crystallizes in triclinic structure with the space group P-1. The thickness value of ZnMoO4 thin film of about 1.5 mu m was estimated by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). Moreover, a special emphasis has been focused on the photoluminescence properties of such films to reach possible presence of defaults and oxygen vacancy. Second, the electrical conductivity, conduction mechanism, relaxation model of these films were indeed studied using impedance spectroscopy technique in the frequency range 10(-1)-10(6) Hz at various temperatures (25-300 degrees C). At high temperature, sigma(AC) conductivity obeys to the power law established by Jonscher. Besides, the variation of sigma(DC) with the inverse of the temperature follows Arrhenius law. This evolution suggests that the conduction process is thermally activated and the activation energy of this process is equal to 0.97 eV. Finally, the wettability tests reveal that zinc molybdates loses its hydrophobic character during aging under UV radiation to become completely hydrophilic. All these physical investigations demonstrated that such ternary oxide contains oxygen deficiency which may be of interest for photocatalytic purposes and pave the way for various sensitivity applications like gas and bio-sensors.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0921-4526	1873-2135		WOS:000432750900008

The Ohmic resistance loss, the Nernstian potential loss associated with pH gradients at the surface of the electrode, and electrodialysis in different electrolytes were assessed quantitatively in a stagnant cell as well as in a bubble-convected cell, in which convective mixing occurred due to product-gas evolution. In a stagnant cell that did not have convective mixing, small limiting current densities (<3 mA cm(-2)) and significant polarization losses derived from pH gradients were present in dilute acid as well as in near-neutral pH buffered electrolytes. In contrast, bubble-convected cells exhibited a significant increase in the limiting current density, and a significant reduction of the concentration overpotentials. In a bubble-convected cell, minimal solution transport losses were present in membrane-free cells, in either buffered electrolytes or in unbuffered solutions with pH <= 1. However, membrane-free cells lack a mechanism for product-gas separation, presenting significant practical and engineering impediments to the deployment of such systems. To produce an intrinsically safe cell, an ion-exchange membrane was incorporated into the cell. The accompanying solution losses, especially the pH gradients at the electrode surfaces, were modeled and simulated for such a system. Hence this work describes the general conditions under which intrinsically safe, efficient solar-driven water-splitting cells can be operated.									70	0	0	0	4	0	70			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000360456600022

As AGG can be detrimental to the material properties, a considerable amount of research on the nature, causes and suppression of AGG has been carried out. In this review, we outline the mixed control theory of grain growth and the principle of microstructural evolution that have been developed by Kang and coworkers over the last two decades. The theory and the principle, which are based on theories of crystal growth from a liquid, state that grain growth behavior is controlled by the nature of the solid-liquid interfaces, either atomically rough (macroscopically rounded) or smooth (macroscopically faceted). For grains with atomically rough solid-liquid interfaces, growth is controlled by diffusion of solute through the liquid phase and normal grain growth always occurs. For grains with faceted solid-liquid interfaces (or a mixture of rough and faceted interfaces), growth is interface reaction-controlled and diffusion-controlled below and above a critical driving force for growth, respectively. Depending on the relative values of the critical driving force for growth Delta g(c) and the maximum driving force for the largest grain in the system Delta g(max), pseudo-normal, abnormal, and stagnant grain growth can take place. Based on this theory and principle, we present strategies for suppressing AGG by adjusting Delta g(c) and Delta g(max) to avoid AGG and examples of the successful use of these strategies.					7th International Conference on Sintering7th International Conference on Sintering	NOV 12-16, 2017NOV 12-16, 2017		San Diego, CASan Diego, CA	13	1	0	0	0	0	13			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000459937200020

However, the narrow visible-light absorption spectrum, fast electron-hole recombination and expensive co-catalysts have limited their large-scale practical application in water splitting. In this work, we first developed the new peryleno[1,12-bcd]thiophene sulfone unit with extended pi-conjugation, then prepared a series of sulfone-based hybrid conjugated co-polymers (PS-1-PS-8) by statistically adjusting the molar ratio of the monomer. The experimental results and DFT calculations indicated that with the gradual increase in the peryleno[1,12-bcd]thiophene sulfone contents in the polymer backbone, the optical bandgaps of co-polymers could be fine-tuned from 2.72 eV to 1.58 eV, and showed a red-shift in the visible-light region for improving the light-capturing capability. Besides, the internal charge separation capability along the co-polymers (PS-1-PS-8) was promoted. However, the driving force for proton reduction and the dispersibility of these co-polymers in aqueous solution were gradually decreased. When the molar ratio of dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone to peryleno[1,12-bcd]thiophene sulfone was 19 : 1, the polymerPS-5achieved the highest hydrogen evolution rate (HER), so far, of 7.5 mmol h(-1)g(-1)without co-catalyst under visible light, with an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 15.3% at 420 nm. The HER performance was almost 3 times higher than that of the typical dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone-based conjugated polymerP7. This work provides a strategy for maximizing the HERs of organic semiconductors by balancing the bandgap, charge recombination, driving force and wettability.									11	2	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000575366700031

In this work, we focus on Zn doping to replace Bi-sites within BiVO4 nanocrystals to promote efficient charge separation and transfer. Theoretical and experimental results show that Zn doping induces oxygen vacancies with controllable content. Zn doping and oxygen vacancies not only shift the conduction and valance band positions of BiVO4, resulting a local built-in electric field, but also increase the carrier density, which would be beneficial for charge separation and transfer. In the meantime, water adsorption on Bisites is also activated, which would help water splitting. As a result, these contributions synergistically enhance photoelectrochemical performance with the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 34% at 0.6 V vs. RHE, which is much higher than that of pristine BiVO4. Furthermore, by sequentially electrodepositing graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) nano-film, we have constructed a hybrid ZnBiVO4/GQDs/Co-Pi structure to broaden the light absorption and to enhance the stability, its IPCE reaches as high as 57% and photocurrent density achieves 3.01 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V vs. RHE, which is 8.6 times of the pristine BiVO4, thus providing an efficient strategy for the structure design of BiVO4 based photoelectrodes.									56	4	0	0	5	0	57			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000471670400040

The Ni(OH)(2)@g-C3N4/halloysite nanocomposite photocatalysts with different amounts of Ni(OH)(2) (0.5-10 wt%) were prepared, and a synergistic effect of Ni(OH)(2) platelets and halloysite nanotubes on physicochemical properties and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of g-C3N4 was investigated. As expected, the Ni(OH)(2)@g-C3N4/halloysite nanocomposite photocatalyst prepared with 1 wt% Ni(OH)(2) exhibited the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate (18.4(2) mol h(-1)) which is much higher than that of g-C3N4 (0.43 limo] h(-1)) and Ni(OH)(2)@g-C3N4 (9.1(2),umol h(-1)). Such enhancement in photocatalytic activity of Ni(OH)(2)@g-C(3)N(4)Thalloysite nano composite photocatalyst is attributed to efficient transfer of photogenerated electrons from the g-C3N4 to Ni(OH)(2) cocatalyst interface and trapping of photogenerated holes on the negatively charged surfaces of halloysite nanotubes. In addition, adsorption affinity of the water and methanol molecules was modeled using different surfaces of Ni(OH)(2), halloysite-7A, and g-C3N4 and it is found that combining the g-C3N4 with halloysite-7A and Ni(OH)(2) can significantly improve the adsorption of water and methanol molecules on the surface of the developed nanocomposite. This study offers a simple approach for developing an efficient and inexpensive nanocomposite for effective and applied photocatalytic water splitting methodology for hydrogen production and other possible optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications.

(Zn1-yGay)(O1-zNz) with ZnO as the major component have been synthesized by a solution combustion method in 10 minutes using simple raw materials. The local structures of Zn K edge and Ga K edge, and changes in the chemical environment with the incorporation of Ga and N in ZnO were determined by EXAFS study. EXAFS and XRD results suggested the dissolution of GaN in the ZnO lattice. The homogeneity of the solid solution was demonstrated from HRTEM studies. Photoluminescence studies revealed the creation of a new band at the top of the ZnO valence band (VB), and thus the broadening of the VB of (Zn1-yGay)(O1-zNz) or a decrease in the band gap was attributed to the origin of visible light absorption. UV-Vis spectral studies showed light absorption up to 550 nm, which directly supports the VB broadening. Predominant oxygen vacancies and high photocorrosion observed for ZnO were fully suppressed for (Zn1-yGay)(O1-zNz) , indicating the minimization of defects, and thus more sustainability under irradiation conditions. The bare solid solution exhibited reasonable and promising activity for solar hydrogen evolution and photoelectrochemical current generation at 0 V. The present work explained factors such as the preparation method, single phase structure with the stabilization of integral parts, homogeneity in the structure, compensation of oxygen vacancies, and suppression of the density of recombination centres that play a pivotal role in realizing solar energy harvesting.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000343974100018	25269851

Herein, the g-C3N4 phase homojunctions decorated with cyano groups and K+ were designed and successfully synthesized via only adjusting the reaction temperatures within a facile one-step molten salt route. Such unique junctions were constructed through the overgrowth of triazine-based g-C3N4 nanoparticles embedded in the surface and inner wall of heptazine-based g-C3N4 hollow tubes. Benefited from the multiple advantages of high specific surface area, unique tubular structure, enhanced visible light absorption, and fast charge transfer and separation, the triazine-/heptazine-based g-C3N4 homojunctions drastically enhanced the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance, achieving a 2 and 12-fold improvement than the pristine g-C3N4 microtube and bulk g-C3N4, respectively.

However, efficient modulation of the active sites by the simultaneous escalation of the porosity and nitrogen doping, without affecting the intrinsic electrical conductivity, still remains to be solved. Here, a simple strategy is reported to solve this issue by treating single-walled carbon nanohorn (SWCNH) with urea at 800 degrees C. The resulting nitrogen-doped carbon nanohorn shows a high surface area of 1836 m(2) g(-1) along with an increased electron conductivity, which are the pre-requisites of an electro catalyst. The nitrogen-doped nanohorn annealed at 800 degrees C (N-800) also shows a high oxygen reduction activity (ORR). Because of the high weight percentage of pyridinic nitrogen coordination in N-800, the present catalyst shows a clear 4-electron reduction pathway at only 50 mV overpotential and 16 mV negative shift in the half-wave potential for ORR compared to Pt/C along with a high fuel selectivity and electrochemical stability. More importantly, a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) based on N-800 provides a maximum power density of 30 mW cm(-2) under anion-exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) testing conditions. Thus, with its remarkable set of physical and electrochemical properties, this material has the potential to perform as an efficient Pt-free electrode for AEMFCs.									73	1	0	0	5	0	74			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000348139800011	25155361

A study on HVOF coatings of micron and nano WC-Co powders								SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY				202	22-23			5556	5559		10.1016/j.surfcoat.2008.06.106				AUG 30 2008	2008	High velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) spray coating of micron (m) and nano (n) WC-Co powders has been studied for the improvement of durability of sliding machine components (SMC). In this work, optimal coating process (OCP) is obtained from the best surface properties of coating prepared by the Taguchi program. Hardness of coating is strongly dependent on powder size and spray parameters (SP) because of their strong influence on in-flight parameters. Hardness of n WC-Co is lower than that of m WC-Co since the degree of hard WC decomposition to less hard W2C, W and graphite is larger due to the larger specific surface area. Coating is porous since the decomposed graphite forms carbon oxide gasses by reaction with excess oxygen, and the gas evolution from coating makes porous coating. Porosity of n WC-Co coating is larger than that of m WC-Co because of larger evolution of carbon oxide gasses through n WC-Co coating. Friction coefficient (FC) is strongly dependent on the coating process (CP) since hardness and porosity of coating are dependent on the CP. FC of n WC-Co is lower than that of m WC-Co both at 25 degrees C and 500 degrees C, because of the more decomposition of n WC-Co. FC increases with increasing coating temperature (CT) from 25 degrees C to 500 degrees C both at in and n WC-Co because of the increase of adhesion by increasing surface temperature. WC-Co coating is very protective for the machine component since hardness of the coating is 2-3 times higher than those of machine component materials. Stick friction on WC-Co coating Surface occurs easily at higher temperature due to the higher FC at the higher temperature. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

These fungal enzymes can be used for many applications such as bleaching, organic synthesis, bioremediation, and in laundry detergents. Laccases from Pleurotus ostreatus have been successfully heterologously expressed in yeasts. The availability of established recombinant expression systems has allowed the construction of mutated, "better performing" enzymes through molecular evolution techniques. In the present work, random mutagenesis experiments on poxc and poxa1b cDNAs, using error prone PCR (EP-PCR) have been performed. By screening a library of 1100 clones the mutant 1M9B was selected, it shows a single mutation (L112F) leading to an enzyme more active but less stable with respect to the wild-type enzyme (POXA1b) in all the analyzed conditions. This mutant has been used as a template for a second round of EP-PCR. From this second generation library of 1200 clones, three mutants have been selected. Properties of the four mutants, 1M9B screened from the first library, and IL2B, 1M10B, and 3M7C from the second library, were analyzed. The better performing mutant 3M7C presents, besides L112F, only one substitution (P494T) responsible both for the significantly increased stability and for the exhibited higher activity of this mutant. Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed on three-dimensional models of POXA1b, 1M9B, and 3M7C, and hypotheses on the structure-function relationships of these proteins have been formulated.									66	2	0	0	53	0	71			0887-3585	1097-0134		WOS:000256609800002	18186469

However, the effect of these factors on organoleptic characteristics of Torrontes Riojano wines (TRw) has not been studied yet. This study aimed at evaluating the combined effect of closure type and storage temperature on the organoleptic properties development of TRw over a 18-month aging period, during which wine was bottled with natural (C) and synthetic (SyC) corks, and screwcaps (SC). Bottles were kept 18 months in thermostatized chambers (15 degrees C; 25 degrees C). At different aging times, consumed oxygen (CO), SO2, total phenols (TP), color, and sensory properties were evaluated. CO, TP, and browning index evolutions depended on the interaction between closure and temperature, whereas CIELAB parameters (lightness, chroma, hue) depended on closure-time and temperature-time interactions. At both storage temperatures, SC had a lower hue decrease and a lower chroma increase than C and SyC. The highest temperature prompted a more yellow and darker color of TRw. Thus, it allowed discrimination throughout the process. Considering the aging process, their aromatic intensity, fresh fruit, and yellow and green nuances decreased, while brown hue, color intensity, linalool, and oxidized character rose as their storage time was increased. At the end of their aging, TRw kept to 15 degrees C were not differenced by closure, and they were characterized by their fresh fruit, floral, and high aromatic intensity attributes. At 25 degrees C, SyC presented higher color intensity and herbaceous characters, while C and SC showed a more oxidized character. In conclusion, the interaction closure type-storage temperature is critical for organoleptic stability properties of bottled TRw during aging. Thus, screwcaps and low-temperature storage conditions can preserve the TRw varietal characteristics, increasing their shelf-life significantly.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0956-7135	1873-7129		WOS:000684829000009

Here we present a full proteome of the fecal fluid of Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants, showing that most proteins function as biomass degrading enzymes and that ca. 85% are produced by the fungus and ingested, but not digested, by the ants. Hydrogen peroxide producing oxidoreductases were remarkably common in the proteome, inspiring us to test a scenario in which hydrogen peroxide reacts with iron to form reactive oxygen radicals after which oxidized iron is reduced by other fecal-fluid enzymes. Our biochemical assays confirmed that these so-called Fenton reactions do indeed take place in special substrate pellets, presumably to degrade plant cell wall polymers. This implies that the symbiotic partnership manages a combination of oxidative and enzymatic biomass degradation, an achievement that surpasses current human bioconversion technology.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			2050-084X			WOS:000619640900001	33433325

Thermal water of the Innot Hot Springs has a surface temperature of 71 degrees C, alkaline pH (8.1), low dissolved oxygen (0.61 mg/L) and low total dissolved solids (652 mg/L). The main chemical composition is Na - Cl, with F concentrations (16 mg/L) being comparatively high. Concentrations of alkali and alkali-earth metals (Cs, Li, Rb, Sr) are elevated, while those of other trace elements (Ag, Al, As, Ba, Be, Cr, Cu, Ga, Mn, Mo, U, Zn) are significantly less. Hydrochemical and stable isotope data of hot spring water show that the fluid is meteoric in origin and has undergone significant water - granite interaction. Common geothermometers suggest temperatures of water - rock interaction at depth in the 119 - 158 degrees C range (corresponding to a depth of < 3.9 - 5.2 km). Solubility modelling of the thermal fluid demonstrates that the evolution of F concentrations in spring waters at the discharge site can be accounted for by fluid - rock interaction of a H2O - NaCl solution with fluorite - calcite-bearing granite assemblages between 150 and 200 degrees C and subsequent granite-buffered cooling. Modelling also indicates that the F concentration in the hydrothermal system is largely controlled by interactions with fluorite, with less evidence for the significant involvement of F-topaz. Speciation calculations demonstrate that F speciation in the fluid is dominated by F- (99.4%), followed by minor CaF+ (0.5%) and NaF(aq) (0.1%), and traces of other F complexes. Thus, the F- rich Innot Hot Springs result from meteoric water circulating through fluorite-bearing granitic rocks and are the surface expression of a low-temperature, non-volcanic geothermal system. Discharge of the hot spring water occurs into an ephemeral stream located in a seasonally wet - dry tropical climate. As a result, the F content of local surface waters is distinctly elevated (max. 18 mg/L) during the dry season, making them unsuitable for stock water supplies.									13	0	0	0	7	0	14			0812-0099			WOS:000247064000008

The dye is a novel ruthenium coordinated BIAN (bisiminoacenaphthene)-Fluorene (2,7-Diethynyl-9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene) polymer. Photoresponse of the material was observed by measuring the changes in the open circuit potential voltage which showed a vertical drop of 0.57 V in the potential. From the I-V characteristics, the maximum value of photocurrent observed in the presence of visible light was 245 mu A. The monitoring of rate of H-2 evolution exhibited as high as 3.75 mu mol/hour of H2 with the dye sensitized TiO2 nanotubes at a low bias potential of 0.15V (vs Ag/AgCl), compared to only 2.1 mu mol/hour in case of bare TiO2 nanotubes even at higher bias potential of 0.5V. This shows the material has got the potential as a photocatalyst in the photoelectrochemical splitting of water. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

Aldolases are finding increasing use as biocatalysts for the stereospecific synthesis of complex molecules. Incomplete understanding of the mechanism of catalysis in aldolases, however, can hamper development of new enzyme activities and specificities, including control over newly generated stereocenters. In the case of NAL, it is clear that the enzyme catalyzes a Bi-Uni ordered condensation reaction in which pyruvate binds first to the enzyme to form a catalytically important Schiff base. The identity of the residues required for catalysis of the condensation step and the nature of the transition state for this reaction, however, have been a matter of conjecture. In order to address, this we crystallized a Y137A variant of the E. coli NAL in the presence of Neu5Ac. The three-dimensional structure shows a full length sialic acid bound in the active site of subunits A, B, and D, while. in subunit C, discontinuous electron density reveals the positions of enzyme-bound pyruvate and ManNAc. These 'snapshot' structures, representative of intermediates in the enzyme catalytic cycle, provided an ideal starting. point for QM/MM modeling of the enzymic reaction of carbon-carbon bond formation. This revealed that Tyr137 acts as the proton donor to the aldehyde Oxygen of ManNAc during the reaction, the activation barrier is dominated by carbon carbon bond formation, and proton transfer from Tyr137 is required to obtain a stable Neu5Ac-Lys165 Schiff base complex. The results also suggested that a triad of residues, Tyr137, Ser47, and Tyr110 from a neighboring subunit, are required to correctly position. Tyr137 for its function, and this was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. This understanding of the mechanism and geometry of the transition states along the C-C bond-forming pathway will allow further development of these enzymes for stereospecific synthesis of new enzyme products.									33	0	0	0	16	0	33			1554-8929	1554-8937		WOS:000334823200022	24521460

While several growth investigations of metal alloy nanoparticles have been reported, mechanistic studies on the growth of ternary oxide materials are still missing. This work constitutes the first study on the evolution of anisotropic growth of manganese-cobalt oxide nanoparticles by monitoring the elemental distribution and morphology during the particle evolution via scanning transmission electron microscopy-X-ray spectroscopy. A new growth mechanism based on a "solution-solid-solid" pathway for mixed manganese cobalt oxides is revealed. In this mechanism, the MnO seed formation occurs in the first step, followed by the surface Co enrichment, which catalyzes the growth along the directions in all the subsequent growth stages, creating rod, cross-, and T-shaped mixed metal oxides, which preferentially expose {100} facets. It is shown that the interrelation of both Mn and Co ions initializes the anisotropic growth and presents the range of validity of the proposed mechanism as well as the shape-determining effect based on the metal-to-metal ratio.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000507962300001

The oxide morphology was examined with X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Cr2O3 developed in between the Co3O4 coating and the alloy, while alloying elements of the substrate were incorporated into the coating. Particular attention was devoted to possible sources of growth stresses and the effect of the growth stresses on microstructure evolution in the scales that developed on the non-coated and the coated Fe-22Cr alloy. Microstructural features suggested that scale spallation on coated Fe-22Cr occurred as a result of superimposing thermal stresses during cooling onto the growth stresses, that had developed during oxidation.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0030-770X	1573-4889		WOS:000247931600003

The transformants are unable to grow photoautotrophically, but they grow normally in acetate-containing medium. They are deficient in photosystem II activity as measured by fluorescence transients and O-2, evolution and they accumulate less than 10% of wild-type levels of photosystem II as measured by immunochemical means. Pulse-labeling experiments indicate that the photosystem II complex is synthesized normally in the transformants. These results differ from those obtained previously with similar cyanobacterial psbK mutants that were still capable of photoautotrophic growth (Ikeuchi et al., J. Biol. Chem. 266 (1991) 1111-1115). In C. reinhaudtii the psbK product is required for the stable assembly and/or stability of the photosystem II complex and essential for photoautotrophic growth. The data also suggest that the stability requirements of the photosynthetic complexes differ considerably between C. reinhardtii and cyanobacteria.									58	0	0	0	54	0	60			0167-4412			WOS:A1994NL59500008	8193302

In view of its corrosion resistant advantage and low production cost, non-precious metal oxides have been recognized as the potential candidates for electrocatalysts in fuel cell. In this study, the aim was to develop a stable catalyst based on transition metal oxides using a simple and cheap modified precipitation technique. Three types of transition metal oxides, namely the cobalt oxides, nickel oxides and iron oxides, were synthesized and a systematic study on the physicochemical properties of the materials are carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). It was observed that cobalt oxide was grown as porous hexagonal platelets while iron oxides and nickel oxides were grown as nanosized particles. The role of the microstructural properties of these transition metals in enhancing their catalytic performance is discussed.

The surface morphology of virgin and laser-processed films are followed applying electron optical imaging and atomic force microscopy. The evolution of the surface roughness and pore formation are shown to be accompanied by optical absorption edge shift to infrared wavelength range. Conventional X-ray diffraction analysis and high-resolution transmission electron imaging are applied in order to obtain information on the phase composition. Co-existence of amorphous and anatase TiO2 phases in nonirradiated sol-gel films is found. It is established that after laser processing the most intense XRD anatase peak is shifted to lower 2 theta range. The analysis of high-resolution transmission electron images of film profiles evidences for the laser induced phase transitions. Formation of rutile and brookite TiO2 accompanied by evolution of oxygen deficient TinO2n-1 phases are identified in the subsurface region. The contribution of laser processing for increasing the photocatalytic efficiency of laser-modified films toward the oxidation of methylene blue water solution is demonstrated. The results obtained reveal a novel-processing route for designing sol-gel titania films with improved photocatalytical activity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Among the different strengthening actions of niobium, such as solid solution hardening and carbide precipitation, the precipitation of niobium with nickel in a strengthening phase gamma '' (Ni3Nb) during the aging heat treatment has the largest influence on the mechanical properties of alloy 718. The improvement of the niobium distribution and diffusion in the Ni-matrix may allow a more homogenized repartition of gamma '' precipitates and seems then to be an effective way to upgrade the mechanical properties. As gamma '' precipitates decompose to the stable 6 phase at very long aging times, the study of the effect of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen concentrations on precipitation and dissolution of the delta phase may give information on gamma '' precipitation and on niobium distribution. It is the purpose of the present work to examine the role that the alloy content of interstitial species plays with the niobium-rich delta phase evolution in alloy 718. Alloy 718 samples were heat treated under hydrogenated argon at 980 degrees C for 0 to 96 hours in order to gradually curb the content of interstitial species by reaction with the reducing atmosphere. Chemical analyses realized by glow discharge mass spectrometry (GDMS) confirmed the reduction of the concentration of these species. Specimens were solution-treated for 1h at 1050 degrees C in an inert atmosphere and furnace cooled. Some of the samples were then aged at 920 degrees C for times ranging from 10 min to 1 hour. The precipitation was measured quantitatively in terms of volume fraction and the morphology of the precipitates was appreciated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The differences in the precipitation kinetics and in the microstructure evolution for each interstitial concentration are then discussed.					7th International Conference on Diffusion in Materials7th International Conference on Diffusion in Materials	20082008		Univ Complutende Madrid, Surface Engn Res Grp, Lanzarote, SPAINUniv Complutende Madrid, Surface Engn Res Grp, Lanzarote, SPAIN	3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1012-0386		*****************	WOS:000270899300017

We present newly acquired optical spectrophotometric data for three Galactic planetary nebulae, IC 418, NGC 2392, and NGC 3242, and combine them with UV data from the IUE Final Archive for identical positions in each nebula to determine accurate abundances of He, C, N, O, and Ne at one or more locations in each object. We then collect abundances of these elements for the entire sample and compare them with theoretical predictions of planetary nebula abundances from a grid of intermediate-mass star models. We find some consistency between observations and theory, lending modest support to our current understanding of nucleosynthesis in stars below 8 M . in birth mass. Overall, we believe that observed abundances agree with theoretical predictions to well within an order of magnitude but probably not better than to within a factor of 2 or 3. However, even this level of consistency between observation and theory enhances the validity of published intermediate-mass stellar yields of carbon and nitrogen in the study of the abundance evolution of these elements.									55	0	0	0	0	2	55			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000086201300031

The cofactor then reoxidizes on molecular oxygen and the imino acid hydrolyzes spontaneously to the alpha-keto acid and ammonia. In vitro DAAO displays broad substrate specificity, acting on several neutral and basic D-amino acids: the most efficient substrates are amino acids with hydrophobic side chains. D-aspartic acid and D-glutamic acid are not substrates for DAAO. Through the years, it has been the subject of a number of structural, functional and kinetic investigations. The most recent advances are represented by site-directed mutagenesis studies and resolution of the 3D-structure of the enzymes from pig, human and yeast. The two approaches have given us a deeper understanding of the structure-function relationships and promoted a number of investigations aimed at the modulating the protein properties. By a rational and/or a directed evolution approach, DAAO variants with altered substrate specificity (e.g., active on acidic or on all D-amino acids), increased stability (e.g., stable up to 60 degrees C), Modified interaction with the flavin cofactor, and altered oligomeric state were produced. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the most recent research on the engineering of DAAOs to illustrate their new intriguing properties, which also have enabled us to pursue new biotechnological applications.									29	1	2	0	22	0	32			1389-2037	1875-5550		WOS:000251547500006	18220846

Herein, we report a CCl4-assisted method for the fabrication of continuous g-CN films on various substrates with in-situ extracted metal cations as nucleate sites. The g-CN film exhibits continuous wrinkles-like graphene structure, and can be completely exfoliated as a free-standing film. In the g-CN film, the metallic cations are bonded with the electron-rich nitrogen as the nucleate sites for connecting molecular structure. By changing the synthesis temperature and the flow rate of CCl4, the thickness and the band structure of the g-CN films can be successfully adjusted. Under visible light illumination, the g-CN films exhibit efficient hydrogen evolution with a rate of 74.98 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). We believe that the precise controlled free-standing g-CN film will shed light on many opportunities in the utilization of graphitic carbon nitride for catalysis, sensor, electronic and energy-related applications. This method may open a new avenue to fabricate other two-dimensional films on different substrates.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000491876500012

Benefiting from the improvement of electroconductivity induced by Cl-doping, together with large specific surface area (1882 cm(2) g(-1)) and homogeneous pore structures, as anode of lithium ion batteries, OMG-Cl shows remarkable charge capacity of 1305 mA h g(-1) at current rate of 50 mA g(-1) and fast charge-discharge rate within dozens of seconds (a charge time of 46 s), as well as retains a charge capacity of 733 mA h g(-1) at a current rate of 0.5 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles. Furthermore, as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors, OMG-Cl holds the specific capacitances of 250 F g(-1) in 1 M H2SO4 solution and 220 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) in 6 M KOH solution, which are similar to 40% and 20% higher than those of undoped OMG electrode, respectively. The high capacitive performance of OMG-Cl material can be due to the additional fast Faradaic reactions induced from Cl-doping species.									61	2	0	0	5	0	63			1944-8244			WOS:000393355900052	28027443

The poor correlation between sampling depth and Cl- concentrations indicated that the position of freshwater-saltwater interface is not uniformly distributed in the study area, and this was attributed to aquifer heterogeneities. The targeted coastal wells showed B/Cl and Br/Cl molar ratios in the range of 0.0022-2.43 and 0.00032-0.28, respectively. The base-exchange index (BEI) and saturation index (SI) calculations showed that the salinization process followed by cation-exchange reactions mainly controls changes in the chemical composition of groundwater. All groundwater samples are depleted with respect to delta O-18 (-11.71 to -9.4 parts per thousand) and delta D (-66.26 to -48.41 parts per thousand). The delta O-18 and delta D isotope ratios for surface and groundwater had a similar range and showed high deuterium excess (d-excess) (21.11 to 31.16 parts per thousand). The high d-excess in water samples is because of incoming vapors from the UL mixed with an evaporated moisture flux from the Urmia mainland and incoming vapors from the west (i.e., Mediterranean Sea). Some saline samples with low B/Cl and Br/Cl ratios had depleted delta O-18 and delta D. In this case, due to freshwater flushing, the drilled wells in the coastal playas and salty sediments could have more depleted isotopes, more Cl-, and consequently smaller B/Cl and Br/Cl ratios. Moreover, the results of hydrochemical facies evolution (HFE) diagram showed that because of the existence fine-grained sediments saturated with high density saltwater in the coastal areas that act as a natural barrier, increasing the groundwater exploitation leads to movement of freshwaters from recharge zones in the western mountains not saltwater from UL. The highly permeable sediments at the junction of the rivers to the lake are characterized by low hydraulic gradient and high hydraulic conductivity. These properties enhance the salinization of groundwater observed in the study area. The main factors influencing the salinity are base-exchange reactions, invasion of highly diluted saltwater, dissolution of salty pans, and water chemistry evolution along flow paths.									42	0	0	0	20	0	42			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000381156600086	27184149

However, the synthesis of such architectures with nanoscale features is challenging because of e.g., high surface energy. Previous reports are based on multi-step synthetic approaches with low yield and are thus not compatible with an industrial scale. Herein, we demonstrate that hierarchical nanostructured noble metals and alloys, with thermal stability up to 800 degrees C, can be fabricated by a high throughput, green and straightforward aerosol-assisted synthesis using bi-functional reducing templates. We unravel the reduction mechanism at the solid/solid interface at the single-particle level using state-of-the-art techniques such as in situ transmission electron microscopy, and in situ synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy. We propose a mechanism based on a radical process thermally triggered by the depolymerization of organic components. From a fundamental point of view, this study sheds light on the reduction processes of noble metals in the presence of organic compounds with important fundamental implications for catalysis and electrocatalysis.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000514340300014

When its surface is saturated with N atoms, Mo2C exhibits the best catalytic performance. Guided by this calculation result we highlight a strategy to synthesize Mo2C electrocatalysts whose surface is fully occupied by N atoms. Our electrocatalysts exhibit a low overpotential of 57 mV vs. RHE at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 80 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH for HER which is comparable with the commercial Pt-based electrocatalyst (overpotential of 39 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope of 69 mV dec(-1)). Moreover, our strategy is regarded as a general method which is successfully extended and applied to improve other metal carbide electrocatalysts such as nickel carbide. This work will pave a way for the understanding and optimization of metal carbide electrocatalysts in HER.									38	1	0	0	1	0	38			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000480669500018

Both elements are linked by a highly conductive carbon nanotube fibre film (CNTf), which acts as charge transfer and anchoring platform, to which the catalyst is attached through pi-pi stacking interactions. Photoelectrochemical characterization of the resulting electrodes shows that the full photoanode WO3/BiVO4/CNTf/Ru-WOC outperforms the bare WO3/BiVO4 electrode in the potential range 0.3-0.8 V vs. NHE at pH 7, with current densities enhanced by 0.05-0.29 mA cm-2. Bulk electrolysis experiments and oxygen gas measurements show that the enhanced photocurrent is due to the catalytic water oxidation reaction. Detailed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis is used to investigate the roles of the multiple layers involved in the process. The CNTf/Ru-WOC interface is responsible for increasing charge accumulation and reducing recombination phenomena. The CNTf is able to hold the charge produced from light absorbed by the WO3/BiVO4 semiconductor, as shown by the high capacitive values observed for a WO3/BiVO4/CNTf electrode in the whole range of studied potentials (0.15-0.85 V vs. NHE). Furthermore, Ru-WOC transfers the charge to the solution through fast water oxidation catalysis. This is supported by the low resistivity shown by the full WO3/BiVO4/CNTf/Ru-WOC electrode at low potentials (E < 0.5 V vs. NHE). The robustness and high catalytic rate of Ru-WOC ensures the proper performance of the hybrid photoelectrode device. The latter is particularly important, as it provides opportunities to improve the performance of photoanodes for the water oxidation reaction based on the easy modification of ligands in the molecular catalyst to tune its structural, electronic, and catalytic properties. This is a unique advantage compared with commonly used catalysts based on metal oxides or oxy(hydroxides), which have limited tunability.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2398-4902			WOS:000443282700025

Nevertheless, there is still room for improvements in the electrical conductivity and chemical stability of some MOFs, because of which they cannot be utilized as electrode materials. Fortunately, MOF derivatives have received widespread attention in recent years, especially phosphide materials, which are widely used in practical applications because of their outstanding conductivity, excellent specific surface area, and standout charge mobility. In this review, the latest developments of MOF-derived phosphides in electrocatalysis related to energy, including the excellent performance in terms of electrochemical energy storage and ingenious strategies, and diversified synthetic approaches have been emphasized and summarized. Additionally, the arduous task and feasible proposals of MOF-derived phosphides are also discussed.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14				2637-9368		WOS:000774198400011

The ionic liquids (ILs) employed were aprotic ([Bmim]X; Bmim = (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium, X = BF4, PF6) and protic (DEAS = diethanolaminehydrogen sulphate; DEAP diethanolamine hydrogen phosphate). Photochemical formation of reduced POMs at both thermodynamically stable and unstable water-IL interfaces led to their initial diffusion into the aqueous phase and subsequent extraction into the IL phase. The mass transport was monitored visually by color change and by steady-state voltammetry at micro-electrodes placed near the interface and in the bulk solution phases. However, no diffusion into the organic phase was observed when [P2W18O62](6-) was photo-reduced at the water-diethylether interface. In all cases, water acted as the electron donor to give the overall process: 4POM + 2H(2)O + h nu -> 4POM(-) + 4H(+) + O-2. However, more highly reduced POM species are likely to be generated as intermediates. The rate of diffusion of photo-generated POM- was dependent on the initial concentration of oxidized POM and the viscosity of the IL (or mixed phase system produced in cases in which the interface is thermodynamically unstable). In the water-DEAS system, the evolution of dioxygen was monitored in situ in the aqueous phase by using a Clark-type oxygen sensor. Differences in the structures of bulk and interfacial water are implicated in the activation of water. An analogous series of reactions occurred upon irradiation of solid POM salts in the presence of water vapor.									43	1	0	0	5	0	44			0027-8424			WOS:000306837100021	22753501

Beginning in the late 1980's the NAPL plume started to shrink as a consequence of NAPL dissolution exceeding replenishment and due to active remediation. The subsurface was classified geochemically into four different zones, (i) a contaminant-free zone never occupied by NAPL or dissolved contaminants, (ii) a re-oxidation zone formerly occupied by NAPL, (iii) a zone currently occupied by NAPL, and (iv) a lower fringe zone between the overlying NAPL and the deeper underlying contaminant-free zone. The study investigated the spatial and temporal variability of the redox zonation at the Hnevice site and quantified the influence of iron-cycling on the overall electron balance. As a first step inverse geochemical modelling was carried out to identify possible reaction models and mass transfer processes. In a subsequent step, two-dimensional (forward) multi-component reactive transport modelling was performed to evaluate and quantify the major processes that control the geochemical evolution at the site. The study explains the observed enrichment of the lower fringe zone with ferrihydrite as a result of the re-oxidation of ferrous iron. It suggests that once the NAPL zone started to shrink the dissolution of previously formed siderite and FeS by oxygen and nitrate consumed a significant part of the oxidation capacity for a considerable time period and therefore limited the penetration of electron acceptors into the NAPL contaminated zone.

Tannic acid was used as an organic ligand to simultaneously coordinate with Ni and Fe ions and at the same time wrapped the surface of CNT. The obtained Ni3Fe/TA@CNT catalyst showed superior catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 287 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under a small Tafel slope of 70.24 mV dec(-1) and exhibited persistent stability in alkaline environment. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the electron transfer from CNT to Ni3Fe/TA on the heterointerface modified the local electronic environment of the catalyst at atomic level and decreased the binding energies of adsorbed species, thus greatly accelerating the OER kinetic process and enhancing electrocatalytic activity.

Here, we identified mitochondrial Prx5 from rockfish (SsPrx5) and described its specific structural and functional characteristics. The open reading frame (ORF) of SsPrx5 (570 bp) was translated into a 190-amino acid polypeptide that contained a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), thioredoxin 2 domain, two Prx-specific signature motifs, and three conserved cysteine residues. Sequence comparison indicated that the SsPrx5 protein sequence shared greatest identity with teleost orthologs, where the phylogenetic results showed an evolutionary position within the fish Prx5. The coding sequence of SsPrx5 was scattered in six exons as found in other vertebrates. Additionally, the potent antioxidant functions of recombinantly expressed SsPrx5 protein was demonstrated by insulin reduction and extracellular H2O2 scavenging both in vitro and in vivo. Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) detected ubiquitous mRNA expression of SsPrx5 in healthy rockfish tissues, with remarkable expression observed in gill, liver, and reproductive tissues. Prompt transcription of SsPrx5 was shown in the immune-stimulated gill and liver tissues against Streptococcus iniae and lipopolysaccharide injection. Taken together, present results suggest the indispensable role of SsPrx5 in the rockfish antioxidant defense system against oxidative stresses and its role in maintaining redox balance upon pathogen invasion.

Atmospheric chemical abundances and the evolutionary status of the spectroscopic and speckle-interferometric binary 9 cyg								ASTRONOMY REPORTS				52	3			226	236		10.1134/S1063772908030050				MAR 2008	2008	We have performed speckle interferometry with the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory and spectroscopy (at 3700-9200 angstrom) with the 2-m telescope at Peak Terskol of the spectroscopic and interferometric binary 9 Cyg, which is a composite-spectrum star with an orbital period of 4.3 yrs. The atmosphere of the system's primary component is analyzed in detail. The luminosities of both components estimated to be L-1 = 103.8 L-circle dot, L-2 = 55.2 L-circle dot, where L-circle dot is the solar luminosity, and their effective temperatures to be T-e(1) = 5300 K and Te(2) = 9400 K. The abundances of C, N, O, Fe, and other elements in the primary's atmosphere have been derived. The chemical composition shows signatures of mixing of material from its atmosphere and the region of nuclear reactions. The evolutionary status of 9 Cyg has been determined. The binary's age is about 400 million years; the brighter star is already in the transition to becoming a red giant, while the secondary is still in the hydrogen-burning stage near the zero-age main sequence. We suggest an evolutionary model for the binary's orbit that explains the high eccentricity, e = 0.79.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1063-7729	1562-6881		WOS:000254142300005

Cyclic voltammetry in water/acetonitrile mixture indicates considerable activity for both compounds. However, only 1 acts as homogeneous catalyst. The complexes have been successfully immobilized on indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrode surface. The hydrophobic ligands allowed for a simple dip-coating and drop-casting of 1 and 2 onto ITO. Both 1/ITO and 2/ITO showed increased activity in electrocatalytic O-2 evolution in borate buffer at pH 8.3. According to scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), moreover, re-dissolution tests, the Fe remains in complex with PBI during electrolysis in the drop-casted, nano-porous films of 1/ITO. In contrast, the PBO complex in 2/ITO undergoes a rapid in situ decomposition yielding a mineralized form that is responsible for catalysis. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

J	JOLIOT, P; LAVERGNE, J; BEAL, D								PLASTOQUINONE COMPARTMENTATION IN CHLOROPLASTS .1. EVIDENCE FOR DOMAINS WITH DIFFERENT RATES OF PHOTO-REDUCTION								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA				1101	1			1	12		10.1016/0167-4838(92)90460-U				JUL 6 1992	1992	The photo-reduction of plastoquinones by Photosystem II reaction centers was investigated using fluorescence and oxygen-evolution measurements in thylakoids deprived of Photosystem I acceptors. The process appears biphasic under limiting, as well as saturating, illumination. The 'fast' pool fraction (about 6 PQ molecules per PS II center) represents 50-70% of the total. Its half reduction time under saturating light was found about 25-60 ms, while that of the 'slow' pool was 0.8-1 s. When the photo-reduction process is interrupted after reduction of the fast pool and resumed after a dark period, a redistribution of the reduced plastoquinones towards the slow pool is observed, with t1/2 almost-equal-to 6 s. We interpret these results as expressing a limitation of PQ diffusion in the membrane and propose that the fast pool reflects the fraction present in the grana region where most PS II centers are located, while the slow pool corresponds to quinones from the stromal region. The relationship between the redox states of PQ and of the primary acceptor Q(A) during photo-reduction of the fast pool expresses marked discrepancies with respect to a quasi-equilibrium relationship. This failure to achieve equilibrium on a rapid time-scale and the slow diffusion rate of quinones over long distances are accounted for by small size domains bounded by membrane proteins. In agreement with this view, we found that the amount of fast photo-reducible quinones is decreased when a fraction of PS II centers is inhibited, indicating that the domains contain, on average, about 3-4 PS II centers. We conclude that PQ cannot be responsible for the long range diffusion involved in rapid electron transfer from granal (PS II) to stromal (PS I) regions, a role that must be fulfilled by plastocyanin.									121	1	2	0	121	0	126			0006-3002			WOS:A1992JE42100001

Until recently, however, it was unknown whether atoms heavier than hydrogen could diffuse rapidly enough on interstellar grains to react with other accreted species. In addition, models still require simple reduction as well as oxidation reactions to occur on grains to explain the abundances of various molecules. In this paper we investigate O-atom diffusion and reactivity on a variety of astrophysically relevant surfaces (water ice of three different morphologies, silicate, and graphite) in the 6.5-25 K temperature range. Experimental values were used to derive a diffusion law that emphasizes that O atoms diffuse by quantum mechanical tunnelling at temperatures as low as 6.5 K. The rates of diffusion on each surface, based on modelling results, were calculated and an empirical law is given as a function of the surface temperature. The relative diffusion rates are k(H2Oice) > k(sil) >> k(graph) [k(expected). The implications of efficient O-atom diffusion over astrophysically relevant time-scales are discussed. Our findings show that O atoms can scan any available reaction partners (e. g., either another H atom, if available, or a surface radical like O or OH) at a faster rate than that of accretion. Also, as dense clouds mature, H-2 becomes far more abundant than H and the O : H ratio grows, and the reactivity of O atoms on grains is such that O becomes one of the dominant reactive partners together with H.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000340763200007	25302378

The chemical reactions were handled by the library function of CHEMKIN which was called by the main program in every time step. Parallel computational technology based on message passing interface method (MPI) was used in the simulation. All the cases were run by 12 CPUs on a high performance computer system. Faver-averaged DNS results were obtained by long time averaging the transient profile and compared with the experimental data. The roll-up and evolution of the vortices in jet flame were well captured. The vortices in the same rotating direction attracted each other and those in different rotating directions repulsed each other. Through complex interactions between vortices, the original symmetrical vortex structure could be converted into nonsymmetrical and more complex structures by combination, distortion and splitting of the vortices. The transient profiles of H, OH and H2O mass fraction at 5.76 ms showed the flame structure in jet flame, especially the autoignition regions clearly. The lift-off height was about 9 d-11 d, in agreement with the experimental observation. At the corner point of the flame sheet indicated by OH and H profiles, the combustion was always enhanced by the flame curvature and extended resident time. The profiles of turbulence intensities show that the flames were diffused from the original two outside flame sheets into the core. The DNS results can be considered in developing more accurate and more universal turbulence models.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1001-6538	1861-9541		WOS:000248663700019

An evaluation of the impact of Ca substitution on the structural and magnetic properties of GdMnO3 ceramics								CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL				46	5			6360	6367		10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.112				APR 1 2020	2020	To investigate the effects of structural modulation induced by Ca substitution on the magnetic properties of GdMnO3 systems, Gd1-xCaxMnO3 (x = 0.00-0.30) multiferroic ceramic samples were prepared via a solid-state reaction. The XRD, Raman, backscattered electron images results indicated that all of the synthesized compounds formed single-phase structures, without other detectable impurity phases. Ca2+ ions had fully incorporated into the lattice position of the GdMnO3, resulting in structural distortion. XPS results indicated that Mn4+ ions were introduced in all of the samples, while oxygen vacancies were introduced in the x > 0.10 samples. SEM images showed that the microstructure of the prepared samples was dense, and the grain size was approximately a few microns and changed with the amount of Ca substitution. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy revealed that large amounts of cation vacancies were present in theGd(1-x)Ca(x)MnO(3) ceramics; the vacancies concentration obviously changed as the Ca content increased. Magnetic properties measurements showed that Ca substitution obviously modified the low-temperature magnetic behaviors of the Gd1-xCaxMnO3, and the appropriate substitution amount of Ca improved the magnetic properties due to Mn4+ ions in GdMnO(3 )system introduced by Ca substitution. The investigations demonstrated that the evolution of magnetic properties was closely associated with the concentration of cation vacancies and Mn4+ ions in the Gd(1-x)Ca(x)MnO(3 )samples.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000515196800104

This report describes an efficient surfactant-free synthesis route for producing a twisty nanowire (TNW) shaped platinum-iron (PtFe) alloy catalyst (denoted as PtFe TNWs) with controllable bimetallic compositions. PtFe TNWs with an optimal initial composition of similar to 24% Pt are shown to exhibit the highest mass activity (3.4 A/mg(pt), similar to 20 times higher than that of commercial Pt catalyst) and the highest durability (<2% loss of activity after 40 000 cycles and <30% loss after 120 000 cycles) among all PtFe-based nanocatalysts under ORR or fuel cell operating conditions reported so far. Using ex situ and in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction coupled with atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis and 3D modeling, the PtFe TNWs are shown to exhibit mixed face-centered cubic (fcc)-body-centered cubic (bcc) alloy structure and a significant lattice strain. A striking finding is that the activity strongly depends on the composition of the as-synthesized catalysts and this dependence remains unchanged despite the evolution of the composition of the different catalysts and their lattice constants under ORR or fuel cell operating conditions. Notably, dealloying under fuel cell operating condition starts at phase-segregated domain sites leading to a final fcc alloy structure with subtle differences in surface morphology. Due to a subsequent realloying and the morphology of TNWs, the surface lattice strain observed with the as-synthesized catalysts is largely preserved. This strain and the particular facets exhibited by the TNWs are believed to be responsible for the observed activity and durability enhancements. These findings provide new insights into the correlation between the structure, activity, and durability of nanoalloy catalysts and are expected to energize the ongoing effort to develop highly active and durable low-Pt-content nanowire catalysts by controlling their alloy structure and morphology.									60	6	0	0	2	0	63			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000509425600025	31885267

These methodologies strategically employ tiered screening wherein the number of compositions screened decreases as the complexity, and very often the scientific information obtained from a screening experiment, increases. The algorithm used for down-selection of samples from higher throughput screening experiment to a lower throughput screening experiment is vital in achieving information-rich experimental materials genomes. The fundamental science of material discovery lies in the establishment of composition-structure-property relationships, motivating the development of advanced down-selection algorithms which consider the information value of the selected compositions, as opposed to simply selecting the best performing compositions from a high throughput experiment. Identification of property fields (composition regions with distinct composition-property relationships) in high throughput data enables down-selection algorithms to employ advanced selection strategies, such as the selection of representative compositions from each field or selection of compositions that span the composition space of the highest performing field. Such strategies would greatly enhance the generation of data-driven discoveries. We introduce an informatics-based clustering of composition-property functional relationships using a combination of information theory and multitree genetic programming concepts for identification of property fields in a composition library. We demonstrate our approach using a complex synthetic composition-property map for a 5 at. % step ternary library consisting of four distinct property fields and finally explore the application of this methodology for capturing relationships between composition and catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction for 5429 catalyst compositions in a (NiFeCoCe)O-x library.									33	3	0	0	2	0	36			2156-8952	2156-8944		WOS:000353005400003	25706328

Various LaMn1+xO3+delta (x = 0.0-0.4) nanocatalysts were synthesized by a microwave-assisted "gel combustion" method and calcined at 600 degrees C in air. XRD patterns of the samples confirm formation of perovskite structure and SEM micrographs exhibit spongy agglomerated nanoparticles with a wide size distribution and presence of large pores in their structure. TEM micrographs show the presence of 12-30 nm nanoparticles of possibly highly dispersed amorphous and/or fine crystallites of MnOx, which are not detectable in XRD patterns. TPR results indicate that the oxygen overstoichiometry of LaMnO1+xO3+delta catalysts increases with excess Mn. Enhancement of BET surface area of the catalyst samples as much as 2.5-fold and the maximum TCE oxidation activity are observed for the LaMn1.2O3+delta catalyst. As compared to LaMnO3+delta, T-50 and T-90 of TCE oxidation on LaMn1.2O3+delta are decreased by 150 and 174 degrees C, respectively. Loss of BET surface areas of the catalysts after exposure to reaction conditions may be responsible for the observed initial deactivation. XPS spectra show the formation of LaOCl during the initial deactivation. Simple zero-order kinetics expression with respect to TCE, provides fairly good fits for the evolution of the TCE conversion on LaMn1+xO3+delta catalysts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Electrochemical oxidation (EO) is a promising remediation technique for wastewater contaminated with PFCs. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that the "non-active" anodes, including boron-doped diamond, tin oxide, and lead dioxide, are effective in PFCs elimination in wastewater due to their high oxygen evolution potential. Many researchers have conducted experiments to investigate the optimal conditions (i.e., potential, current density, pH value, plate distance, initial PFCs concentration, electrolyte, and other factors) for PFCs elimination to obtain the maximal elimination efficiency and current efficiency. The EO mechanism and pathways of PFCs have been clearly elucidated, which undergo electron transfer, Kolbe decarboxylation or desulfonation, hydrolysis, and radical reaction. In addition, the safety evaluation and energy consumption evaluation of the EO technology have also been summarized to decrease toxic ion release from electrode and reduce the cost of this technique. Although the ultrasonication and hydrothermal techniques combined with the EO process can improve the removal efficiency and current efficiency significantly, these coupled techniques have not been commercialized and applied in industrial wastewater treatment. Finally, key challenges facing EO technology are listed and the directions for further research are pointed out (such as combination with other techniques, treatment for natural waters contaminated by low levels of PFCs, and reactor design).

The samples were characterized by UV-visible and IR spectroscopy, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3. Ion-exchanged Cu(x)-FAU contains mainly Cu ions located in both supercages and sodalite cavities. In contrast, the impregnated sample contains mainly CuO. Ionic Cu is more active and selective to N-2 than CuO in the temperature range 450-750 K. In contrast, CuO aggregates lead to significant formation of N2O, with a bell-shaped dependency centered at ca. 540 K. IR spectroscopy and TPD of NH3 show that the last NH3 ligand was removed from Cu ions above 550 K. The SCR on Cu ions obeys a Cu2+ <-> Cu+ redox mechanism in which Cu2+ is reduced to Cu+ by NO + NH3 and Cu+ is oxidized to Cu2+ by NO + O-2, with evolution of N-2 and H2O. Both reduction and oxidation steps of Cu in the catalytic cycle encompass the reduction of NO in agreement with the SCR of (NO)-N-14 with (NH3)-N-15. A new overall SCR reaction below 550 K was proposed: 10NH(3) + 13NO + O-2 --> 15H(2)O --> (23/2)N-2. The active sites below 550 K are formed by several Cu neighbor ions, maybe [CuOCu](2+), probably located in the supercages. All Cu ions become active above 600 K. The partial reduction of NO to N2O occurs at high temperature (>650 K) on exchanged samples. This formation, up to 17% at full NO conversion, is likely to take place on Cu ions located within the sodalite cavities.

The bottleneck for the synthesis of elements beyond sulphur is the P-30(p, gamma)S-31 reaction. Its reaction rate is, however, not well determined due to uncertainties in the properties of key resonances in the burning regime. In the present study, gamma-ray transitions are reported for the first time from all key states in S-31 relevant for the P-30(p, gamma)S-31 reaction. The spins and parity of these resonances have been deduced, and energies have been measured with the highest precision to date. The uncertainty in the estimated P-30(p, gamma)S-31 reaction rate has been drastically reduced. The rate using this new information is typically higher than previous estimates based on earlier experimental data, implying a higher flux of material processed to high-Z elements in novae, but it is in good agreement with predictions using the Hauser-Feshbach approach at higher burning temperatures.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			0031-9007			WOS:000305782000004	23004970

Although the clotting reaction in the chelicerate horseshoe crab (Family: Limulidae) has been described in details, the overall protein composition of the resulting clot has not been analyzed for any of the chelicerates. The largest class among the chelicerates is the arachnids, which includes spiders, ticks, mites, and scorpions. Here, we use a mass spectrometry-based approach to characterize the spider hemolymph clot proteome from the Brazilian whiteknee tarantula, Acanthoscurria geniculata. We focused on the insoluble part of the clot and demonstrated high concentrations of proteins homologous to the hemostasis-related and multimerization-prone von Willebrand factor. These proteins, which include hemolectins and vitellogenin homologous, were previously identified as essential components of the hemolymph clot in crustaceans and insects. Their presence in the spider hemolymph clot suggests that the origin of these proteins' function in coagulation predates the split between chelicerates and mandibulata. The clot proteome reveals that the major proteinaceous component is the oxygen-transporting and phenoloxidase-displaying abundant hemolymph protein hemocyanin, suggesting that this protein also plays a role in clot biology. Furthermore, quantification of the peptidome after coagulation revealed the simultaneous activation of both the innate immune system and the coagulation system. In general, many of the identified clot-proteins are related to the innate immune system, and our results support the previously suggested crosstalk between immunity and coagulation in arthropods.

However, when present in excess, iron can participate in Fenton reactions and generate reactive oxygen species that damage cells at the level of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. Organisms have developed different molecular strategies to protect themselves against the harmful effects of high concentrations of iron. In the case of fungi and plants, detoxification mainly occurs by importing cytosolic iron into the vacuole through the Ccc1/VIT1 iron transporter. New sequenced genomes and bioinformatic tools are facilitating the functional characterization, evolution and ecological relevance of metabolic pathways and homeostatic networks across the Tree of Life. Sequence analysis shows that Ccc1/VIT1 homologs are widely distributed among organisms with the exception of animals. The recent elucidation of the crystal structure of a Ccc1/VIT1 plant ortholog has enabled the identification of both conserved and species-specific motifs required for its metal transport mechanism. Moreover, recent studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have also revealed that multiple transcription factors including Yap5 and Msn2/Msn4 contribute to the expression of CCC1 in high-iron conditions. Interestingly, Malaysian S. cerevisiae strains express a partially functional Ccc1 protein that renders them sensitive to iron. Different regulatory mechanisms have been described for non-Saccharomycetaceae Ccc1 homologs. The characterization of Ccc1/VIT1 proteins is of high interest in the development of biofortified crops and the protection against microbial-derived diseases. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Different from traditional inactivation methods, such as ultraviolet (UV) light which are only safe to use when people are not present, and high-efficiency particulate filters (HEPA) which merely filter microbes without killing them, atmospheric pressure nonequilibrium plasma (APNP) has shown its tremendous potential in drastically diminishing the aerosol transmission route of the infectious agents through the abatement of PBAs. The key issues to develop high performance APNP based air purification system are critically reviewed. Systematic studies on the hazards of different PBAs and the spread of PBAs in indoor environments guide the development of APNP sources to control communicable diseases. The key six sampling and seven detection methods on PBAs are introduced to analyze the PBA abatement efficiency by APNP. Seven common APNP sources which can remove viruses and bacteria aerosols efficiently developed during the past 8 years are introduced. For the APNP sources with small plasma volume, the electric field and diffusion driven charging are the dominant mechanisms to charge PBAs, while the common methods of dusty plasma research can be adapted to atmospheric-pressure conditions to describe the charging effects of APNP sources with large plasma volume. Plentiful long- and short-lifetime reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) generated by APNP effectively contribute to inactivation of bacterial aerosols. Current studies suggest that viral aerosols are mainly inactivated by short-lifetime RONS including O-1(2), ONOO- and ONOOH. The study on the dissolution and reaction of gaseous RONS in microdroplets and accurate measurements on the evolution of charged PBAs are envisaged to be the focus of future research. Opportunities for multidisciplinary collaborative research to advance the development of next-generation high-performance plasma-based air purifiers are highlighted.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0963-0252	1361-6595		WOS:000659273100001

The present paper shows a possible solution for this problem through High-Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) thermal spray coatings. A comparative study was carried out between powder and wire Ni-based thermal spray coatings (with the same composition). These optimized coatings were compared based on their microstructure, wear properties (ASTM G99-90, ASTM G65-91), and erosion-corrosion (E-C) resistance. An E-C test designed in the Thermal Spray Centre was performed to reproduce the mechanisms that take place in a boiler. Studying the results of this test, the wire HVT Inconel coating sprayed by propylene appears to be the best alternative. A commercial bulk material with a composition similar to Ni-based coatings was tested to find the products of the oxidation reactions. The protective mechanisms of these materials were assessed after studying the results obtained for HVOF coatings and the bulk material where the presence of nickel and chromium oxides as a corrosion product can be seen. Kinetic evolution of the Ni-based coatings can be studied by thermogravimetric analysis. The protection that Inconel coatings give to the tube through the difference of the gain mass can be seen. Ni-based HVOF coatings by both spray conditions are a promising alternative to MSWI protection against chlorine environments, and their structures have a very important role.									24	2	0	0	0	0	26			1059-9630	1544-1016		WOS:000255864400011

A growth-based branch orientation towards high-light functioning as a mechanism to protect the plant from excessive light was confirmed. It was shown that the receptor responsible for the morphological reaction is sensitive to blue-light.C. intermedia showed higher oxygen evolution (up to 10.5 (HL) vs. 4.5 (LL) nmol O-2 mg Chl(-1) s(-1)), photochemical and energy-dependent Chl fluorescence quenching and a lower Fv/Fm after acclimation to HL. With respect to qP, the acclimation of the photosynthetic apparatus depended on light quality and needed the blue part of the spectrum for full development. in addition, pigment composition was influenced by light and the Chl a/Car and Antheraxanthin (A) + Zeaxanthin (Z)/Violaxanthin (V) + A + Z (DES) ratios revealed the expected acclimation behaviour in favour of carotenoid protection under HL (i.e. decrease of Chl a/Car from 3.41 +/- 0.48 to 2.30 +/- 0.35 and increase of DES from 0.39 +/- 0.05 to 0.87 +/- 0.03), while the Chl a/Chl b ratios were not significantly affected. Furthermore it was shown that morphological light acclimation mechanisms influence the extent of the physiological modifications. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Strigolactones positively influence plant coping mechanisms in response to abiotic stressors like drought and high salinity. In this study, we examined the effects of rac-GR24 (a synthetic strigolactone analog) and strigolactone inhibitors on the physiological and molecular responses associated with thermotolerance during seed germination and seedling development in Lupinus angustifolius under heat stress. Photosystem I & II functions were also evaluated via Chl a fluorescence transient analysis in heat stressed lupine seedlings. Our results suggest a putative role for GR24 in mediating tolerance to heat stress during seed germination and seedling development albeit these responses appeared independent of D14-mediated signalling. Seeds primed with GR24 had the highest of all germination indices, enhanced praline content and reduced pemxidation of lipids. GR24 also enhanced the activities of enzymes of the antioxidant and glyoxalase systems in lupine seedlings. The JIP-test indicated that GR24 conferred resistance to heat stress-induced damage to the oxygen evolution complex while also preventing the inactivation of PSII reaction centres thus ensuring PSII thermotolerance.									18	2	0	0	14	0	19			0981-9428	1873-2690		WOS:000581918000091	32977141

They belong to five main types of fresh (I), brackish (II), high-pH low-saline (III), coal-related saline (IV), and carbonated (V) waters that differ in composition, as well as in depth and lateral extent. Waters of types I and II are of regional extent and common chemistry, while those of three other types have specific compositions and are restricted to local areas. Isotope data (delta O-18, delta D, delta C-13) indicate that waters of all five types originated by the infiltration mechanism; type IV water has an enriched oxygen isotope composition; all water types except V have biogenic carbon sources. As shown by thermodynamic calculations, all HCO3-Na waters are nonequilibrium with many primary aluminosilicate minerals bur are equilibrated with carbonates and clay minerals. The number of minerals equilibrated with these waters increases progressively from type I to IV with salinity and pH. The obtained data allow reconstructing the formation of sodic waters of different types in the context of the evolution in the system 'water - rock - gas organic matter'. The formation scenario is the same for all types of water: dissolution of sedimentary aluminosilicate minerals which are not in equilibrium with the waters and concurrent precipitation of carbonates. Waters in the zone of slow water exchange at depths from 100 to 300 m acquire the HCO3-Na compositions, with TDS >0.7-0.8 g/L and pH >7.6. The diversity of the waters results from difference in their residence time, even during the formation of HCO3-Na chemistry (types I and II), and from environment effects: presence of inorganic CO2 (V) and organic carbon (IV) sources or their absence (III).									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0883-2927	1872-9134		WOS:000536438300008

However, low hole mobility, short hole lifetime, high density of surface states, and slow kinetics for oxygen evolution at the alpha-Fe2O3/electrolyte interface have limited the PEC performance of alpha-Fe2O3 photoanodes to date. Along with numerous reports on doping and nanostructuring of alpha-Fe2O3, increased attention has been paid to alpha-Fe2O3 heterostructure design for improved PEC performance. This review article provides an overview of four main approaches to rational heterostructure design: coupling alpha-Fe2O3 with (1) an n- or p-type semiconductor for promoting charge separation; (2) a nanotextured conductive substrate for efficient charge collection; (3) a surface/interface passivation layer for reduced surface/interface charge recombination; (4) a catalyst for accelerated water oxidation kinetics. The achievements to date demonstrate that high PEC performance may be accessed with these designs. In addition, we review time-resolved laser techniques used to probe the charge carrier dynamics of these heterostructures. Dynamic studies have provided insight into the mechanisms responsible for the improved PEC performance in these materials and helped to guide continued design of alpha-Fe2O3 heterostructures for further enhancement of PEC water splitting. As summarized in this review article, rational heterostructure design is a promising strategy to push forward the application of alpha-Fe2O3 for potential low cost and high efficiency solar hydrogen conversion. A better fundamental understanding of the charge carrier dynamics in these structures in turn helps to guide and improve the heterostructure design.									351	16	0	0	28	0	354			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000382746300004

Previous studies of the cycle omitted intermediate products, such as ammonium bisulfate, from the O-2 sub-cycle and, thus, neglected their potential impact on the cycle's chemistry. Also, there are discrepancies in reported literature for the thermodynamic properties of ammonium sulfate, (NH4)(2)SO4, and ammonium bisulfate, NH4HSO4. In this study, thermal analysis experiments were conducted in order to determine the phase transition temperatures and enthalpies, and the heat capacity temperature dependence of the ammonium sulfate, (NH4)(2)SO4, and ammonium bisulfate, NH4HSO4. Our experimentally determined values for these parameters agree well with the data reported in DIPPR Project 801 database. Moreover, an exploratory thermodynamic analyses was performed using AspenPlus and FactSage, that included all potential reaction products, in order to identify critical parameters for an optimum O-2 sub-cycle. A methodology is proposed and evaluated to mitigate AspenPlue's deficiency to handle solid phase changes. The thermodynamic analyses demonstrate that the NH4HSO4 inclusion in the O-2 sub-cycle reduces the overall process energy requirements, and allows its use as an energy storage medium. Finally, we show that the use of molten salts, in combination with their interactions, significantly affects the efficiency and the operating conditions of the process, as well as the state of the mixtures.

Driven by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we designed and synthesized a new phenazine-linked 2D-COF (COF-C4N) by solvothermal reaction of triphenylenehexamine (TPHA) and hexaketocyclohexane (HKH). Structural analysis confirmed that COF-C4N possesses an ordered crystalline structure with a highly conjugated basal plane and better stability. COF-C4N exhibited OER performance with a low overpotential of 349 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1). A combination of theoretical and experimental studies revealed that better OER performance is attributed to better crystallinity and stability, an appropriate band gap, and an N position that promotes the formation of C active sites around N atoms. The strategy of theory-driven design and targeting synthesis of 2D-COFs for OER may provide a new way to further develop metal-free materials for clean energy application.									61	5	0	0	3	0	63			2380-8195			WOS:000486361500030

The results indicate that the different nitrogen doping contents in Pd/N-C catalysts have a significant effect on the performance of FAEO. A higher N content facilitates the uniform dispersion of Pd nanoparticles on carbon black with narrow particle size distribution. Furthermore, the electrochemical results show that the catalyst with a higher N-doping content possesses a higher catalytic activity and a long-term stability for FAEO. The peak current density of the Pd/N-C (high) catalyst is 1.27 and 2.31 times that of the Pd/N-C (low) and homemade Pd/C-H catalyst. The present paper may provide a simple method for preparation of high-performance anode catalyst for direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2095-1701	2095-1698		WOS:000410770500009

However, it remains a grand challenge to modify the properties of MGs by control of the disordered atomic structure. Recently, nanostructured metallic glasses (NGs), consisting of amorphous nanometer-sized grains connected by amorphous interfaces, have been reported to exhibit tunable properties compared to the MGs with identical chemical composition. Here, it is demonstrated that electrodeposited Ni-P NG is characterized by an extremely high energy state due to its heterogeneous structure, which significantly promotes the catalytic performance. Moreover, the Ni-P NG with a heterogeneous structure is a perfect precursor for the fabrication of unique honey-like nanoporous structure, which displays superior catalytic performance in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Specifically, modified Ni-P NG requires a potential of mere 1.36 V at 10 mA cm(-2), with a Tafel slope of 13 mV dec(-1), which is the best UOR performance in Ni-based alloys. The present work demonstrates that the nanostructurization of MGs provides a universal and effective pathway to upgrade the energy state of MGs for the design of high-performance catalysts in energy conversion.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000797781400001	35429007

The Lower Cambrian Niutitang Formation is one of the most important marine sedimentary layers in the Yangtze region, South China, and it records abundant important geological information that can be used for the reconstruction of the Lower Cambrian paleo-climates and paleo-environments.Nitrogen isotope compositions record and reflect variations in the original sedimentary environment and the redox conditions of marine ecosystems. Trace elements are also reliable indicators of sedimentary environments. In this study, we collected samples from the Lower Cambrian Niutitang Formation shale in the upper-middle Yangtze region of South China and measured the nitrogen isotope values of bulk sediments (delta N-15(bulk)), as well as their organic carbon isotope values (delta C-13(org)), total organic carbon (TOC) contents, total nitrogen (TN) contents and trace element concentrations. The delta N-15(bulk) values of the Niutitang shale range from 0.6 parts per thousand to 2.8 parts per thousand, they show a certain positive excursion from bottom to top in the longitudinal direction, and they exhibit a significant correlation with the longitudinal variations in trace elements. These trace element characteristics suggest that the lower section of the Niutitang Formation existed in a strongly reduced sedimentary environment and was located in a hydrothermally active layer. During the deposition of the lower section of black shale, the nitrogen cycle was dominated by anaerobic nitrogen fixation; thus, its nitrogen isotope values are relatively lighter. In contrast, during the deposition of the upper section of the Niutitang Formation, the redox conditions of water column were unstable, the oxygen contents increased, and oxygenated reactions were intermittent or localized; thus producing relatively strong isotopic fractionation and causing the delta N-15(bulk) values in the upper section of black shale to exhibit a positive excursion. We conclude that the sedimentary environment is the key factor affecting nitrogen isotopes and that the redox conditions of the water column exhibit a significant correlation with the nitrogen isotope values.									21	1	0	0	4	0	21			0031-0182	1872-616X		WOS:000434906000001

CZS shows outstanding activity in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (1.31 mmol h(-1)), owing to its unique morphology and heterophase homojunctions (ZB/WZ), which accelerate the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges. After coupling with NP, the photoactivity of NPCZS was enhanced, and the maximum hydrogen evolution rate of 1.88 mmol h(-1) was reached at a NP content of 12 wt%, which was 1.43 times higher than that of pure CZS. The experimental results of the photocatalytic activity, viz. photoluminescence spectra, surface photovoltage spectra, and electrochemical test showed that the enhanced photoactivity of NPCZS should be attributed to the synergistic effects of the novel tetrapod-bundle morphology, heterophase homojunctions, and decoration of the NP co-catalyst.

Although the morphologies of MOF precursors have a significant effect on the properties of the resulting materials, up to now, there has been no systematic study on the relationship of the morphologies of MOFs and the properties of their pyrolized carbonaceous materials. Herein, three isomorphous imidazolate-based ZIF-7 materials with different morphologies (sphere, polyhedron and rod shape) have been selected as precursors and carbonized to obtain porous N-doped carbon materials with a tunable morphology, pore features and surface areas. The spherical precursor ZIF-7-S with an average size of 45 nm was cross-linked to form carbon networks during pyrolysis, while the rod shape of ZIF-7-R (0.6 m in diameter and 3 m in length) was well retained in the NC-R-800 material. NC-D-800 derived from polyhedral ZIF-7-D (125 nm) was constructed by partially interlinked particles and interparticle mesopores were formed. NC-D-800 has the highest Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 538 m(2) g(-1) of the three carbon materials. Moreover, NC-D-800 shows superiority over NC-S-800 and NC-R-800 in the oxygen reduction reaction. This work discloses that the morphologies of MOF precursors could indeed affect the morphologies, and physical and catalytic properties of their corresponding carbon materials.									18	0	0	0	3	0	18			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000472454100021	30672537

We define Type I PN as those objects that have experienced envelope-burning conversion to nitrogen of dredged-up primary carbon. Such nebulae are recognised by their having nitrogen abundances that exceed the total C + N abundance of H II regions in the same galaxy. In our own galaxy, this criterion corresponds to N/O > 0.8. In the current sample, 11 nebulae having N/O > 0.8 are thereby classified as Type I. For these Type I PN, no evidence is found for oxygen depletion, compared with non-Type I PN. No trend is found between the N/O and O/H ratios for the entire sample, and the mean O/H ratios for the non-Type I and Type I PN are the same within the errors; O/H = (4.93 +/- 2.22) x 10(-4) by number for 42 non-Type I PN and O/H = (4.42 + 1.44) x 10(-4) for 11 Type I PN. Also, no difference is found between the oxygen abundances in the PN in this sample and the oxygen abundances in galactic HII regions. Hence we find no evidence for the ON cycle (which is predicted to operate during the second dredge-up) to have significantly altered the surface abundances of the progenitor stars, even for the Type I PN.The helium abundances derived for the non-Type I PN are in accord with those predicted by Becker & Iben for the first and third dredge-up phases. A comparison between the nitrogen abundances in the PN and the carbon + nitrogen abundances in galactic HII regions indicates that roughly 36 per cent of the initial carbon is converted into nitrogen in the case of the non-Type I PN, consistent with predictions for the first dredge-up by Becker & Iben. In order to explain the high nitrogen abundances derived for the Type I PN, however, envelope-burning of dredged-up carbon into nitrogen, following the third dredge-up, is definitely required. Total C+N+O abundances are found to be correlated with C/H for the combined nonType I and Type I sample; the carbon has been enhanced by He-burning processed material brought up by the third dredge-up.									490	1	1	0	0	10	492			0035-8711			WOS:A1994PR04900005		
J	Kikuchi, Sakiko; Shibuya, Takazo; Abe, Mariko; Uematsu, Katsuyuki								Experimental chondrite-water reactions under reducing and low-temperature hydrothermal conditions: Implications for incipient aqueous alteration in planetesimals								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				319				151	167		10.1016/j.gca.2021.11.006				FEB 15 2022	2022	The presence of hydrous minerals in carbonaceous chondrites has been considered important evidence for the former presence of liquid water in parent asteroids. However, the evolution of water-rock reactions in hydrous asteroids remains not well constrained. Here, we conduct water-rock type experiments and chemical equilibria calculations under low-temperature hydrothermal and reducing conditions to investigate the alteration process and secondary mineral assemblages of chondritic rock in the earliest alteration stage. Using synthetic chondrite (mixtures of olivine (forsterite95), orthopyroxene (enstatite(95)), silicate glass, troilite and Femetal) as a starting material, our experiments were conducted at temperatures of 25 degrees C-80 degrees C for time periods between 1 and 460 days at a water-to-rock mass ratio of 10. A combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analyses revealed that the primary secondary phases consisted of pyrrhotite, an amorphous SiO2-rich phase and saponite at 80 degrees C, while the secondary phase consisted of an amorphous SiO2-rich phase and saponite at 25 degrees C. At both temperatures, the SiO2-rich phases and saponite densely covered the surface of the primary phases. The Fe/Mg ratios of saponite and amorphous SiO2-rich phases showed clear difference between 80 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Saponite that was formed at 80 degrees C was richer in Fe than the initial silicate phases, and the highest Fe/Mg ratios were obtained in the saponite encrusting the troilite and Femetal. These results suggest that the Fe distributed from the troilite and Femetal induced the formation of Fe-rich saponite. Some of the secondary minerals observed from our alteration experiments were consistent with those expected by chemical equilibria calculations. However, the formation of serpentine, the dominant secondary mineral expected from chemical equilibria calculations, was not observed in our experiments up to 460 days, probably because the preferential dissolution of SiO2-rich silicate glass in the earliest stage of alteration induced the formation of saponite rather than serpentine. The secondary mineral assemblage and its morphological characteristics, as observed by our alteration experiments, showed similarities with carbonaceous chondrites such as CM2 and CO3 chondrites. This alteration might be explained by water-rock reactions at low temperatures and by the short time alteration. These findings better constrain the temperatures and timescales of aqueous alterations in hydrous asteroids, as well as the role of water in the early solar system bodies. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

By comparing the activity of nano-scaled supported IrO2 particles to the one of organometallic complexes it is shown that the overall activity of the homogeneous Ir precursors is defined by both the formation of the homogeneous active species and its conversion to Ir-IV-oxo nanoparticles. In the first phase of the reaction the activity is dominated by the homogeneous active species. With increasing reaction time, the influence of nano-sized Ir-oxo particles becomes more evident. Notably, the different conversion rates of the homogeneous precursor into the active species as well as the conversion into Ir-oxo nanoparticles and the different particle sizes have a significant influence on the overall activity. In addition to the homogeneous systems, IrO2@MCM-41 has also been synthesized, which contains stabilized nanoparticles of between 1 and 3 nm in size. This latter system shows a similar activity to IrCl3 center dot xH(2)O and complexes 4 and 5. Mechanistic insights were obtained by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy.									81	0	0	0	5	0	81			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000309238400026	22915473

However, no attempt has been made to improve the catalyst performance by directly distributing P atoms at the active centers of Fe-N. In this work, P atoms are connected with Fe-N-x moieties in the carbon structure to form P-Fe-N-x bond by the strong electron coupling effect in a novel C-P-Fe-N-x-P-C system (CPFeNPC), verified by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As a result, it leads to an enhanced oxygen reduction performance with ultrahigh half-wave potentials of 0.923 V and 0.791 V in alkaline and acidic electrolytes, respectively. Significantly, they are far more than that of commercial Pt/C (0.854 V) under alkaline conditions and even almost the same as that of commercial Pt/C (0.807 V) under acidic conditions. Moreover, when adopted as the cathode catalyst, the assembled Zn-air battery (ZAB) and proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) deliver 1.6-fold and 1.25-fold enhancements in the peak power density compared with that based on commercial Pt/C and conventional Fe-N-x-C catalysts, respectively. The developed catalysts with abundant P-coordinated Fe-N-x sites shine new light on the real application of metal-N-C catalysts in fuel cells.									34	5	0	0	1	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536095500031

Thus, various redox mediators (RMs) have been widely studied to reduce the overpotential in the charging process, which should promote the oxidation of Li2O2. However, RMs degrade the Li metal anode through a parasitic reaction between the RM and the Li metal, and a solution for this phenomenon is necessary. In this study, an effective method is proposed to prevent the migration of the RM toward the anode side of the lithium using a separator that is modified with a negatively charged polymer. When DMPZ (5,10-dihydro-5,10-dimethylphenazine) is used as an RM, it is found that the modified separator suppresses the migration of DMPZ toward the counter electrode of the Li metal anode. This is investigated by a visual redox couple diffusion test, a morphological investigation, and an X-ray diffraction study. This advanced separator effectively maximizes the catalytic activity of the redox mediator. Li-O-2 batteries using both a highly concentrated DMPZ and the modified separator exhibit improved performance and maintained 90% round-trip efficiency up to the 20th cycle.									77	5	0	0	4	0	77			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000411182500019

To address this problem, the thermal transient of CCL needs to be clarified first before further action is taken. In this work, the effects of current load, operating temperature, and channel to rib width ratio on the thermal transient of CCL are systemically investigated by a two-dimensional, two-phase transient PEMFC thermal model. At the same time, the action mechanisms of electrochemical and two-phase flow transients on the thermal transient are detailly described. We observe that the overshoot of CCL temperature will happen as the current steps from nearly zero to a certain level. Interestingly, under the action of local water and thermal evolution, the overshoot amplitude first increases and then decreases with the rise of the step current density. Moreover, with the increase in loading time and operating temperature, temperature overshoot significantly decreases. The former is attributed to the quasi-steady state operation of two-phase flow at a long loading time, while the latter is caused by the reduction of membrane water absorption with atmosphere drying. It is also found that the larger channel to rib width ratio will induce more uniform temperature fluctuation in CCL regions under rib and channel due to the more uniform electrochemical reaction caused by shorter O-2 transport path length. The above model simulation results can guide cell operation and design for better thermal management under dynamic loading.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000779166800005

Growth was only moderately slowed (15%), while oxygen evolution was never compromised. Inductively coupled plasma analyses indicated that the Mn cell content doubled with respect to controls, but no signs of localised accumulation were detected with X-ray microanalysis. Evident morphological alterations were found at the plastid level with transmission electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. An increase in the plastid mass, accompanied by frequent aberrations of chloroplast shape and of the organisation of the thylakoid system, was observed. These aspects paralleled a decrease in the molar ratio of chlorophyll a to b and an increase in the fluorescence emission ratio of light-harvesting complex II to photosystem II, the latter evaluated by in vivo single-cell microspectrofluorimetry. These changes were observed between 24 and 72 h of treatment. However, the alterations in the pigment pattern and photosystem II fluorescence were no longer observed after 96 h of Mn exposure, notwithstanding the maintenance of the large plastid mass. The response of the photosynthetic apparatus probably allows the alga to limit the photooxidative damage linked to the inappropriately large peripheral antennae of photosystem II. On the whole, the resistance of Euglena gracilis to Mn may be due to an exclusion - tolerance mechanism since most Mn is excluded from the cell, and the small amount entering the organism is tolerated by means of morphophysiological adaptation strategies, mainly acting at the plastid level.									24	4	0	0	23	0	29			0033-183X	1615-6102		WOS:000226304500004	15614477

In this study, HPGACs are directly synthesized from lignite at 900 degrees C. The whole process is completed by a microwave pretreatment, a graphitization conversion of the carbon framework at a low temperature using a small amount of FeCl3 (10-30 wt%), and a subsequent physical activation using CO2. Consequently, the dispersed and mobile iron species, in the absence of oxygen functional groups (removed during the microwave pretreatment), can greatly promote catalytic graphitization during pyrolysis, and, as an activating catalyst, can further facilitate the porosity development during activation. The as-obtained AC-2FeHLH-5-41.4(H) presents a low defect density, high purity, and specific surface area of 1852.43 m(2) g(-1), which is far greater than the AC-HLH-5-55.6(H) obtained solely by physical activation. AC-2FeHLH-5-41.4(H) as a supercapacitor electrode presents an excellent performance in the further electrochemical measurements. Such a convenient and practical method with low cost proves a scalable method to prepare HPGACs from a wide range of coal/biomass materials for industrial scale-up and applications.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2227-9717		WOS:000470965600059

However, such function devices still suffer from the problems of preparation method, cost, and performance, therefore hindering their preparation and application. Herein, an easily prepared promising solar-thermally powered functional system with high performance for effective sunlight-driven hydrogen production was constructed. Such a functional system consists of a photothermal generator with a high-performance solar absorber, together with a water-splitting catalytic module using molybdenum disulfide loaded on carbon cloth (MoS2-CC) as a cathode. The optimal gold composite polyethyleneimine-modified graphene oxide (Au@rGO-PEI) solar absorber coated on a commercial thermoelectricity device exhibits enhanced (45.9% higher) photothermal performance compared with rGO-PEI; this is due to the introduction of Au nanosheets' effective plasma resonance. This as-designed generator enables stable and long-term output power under different ambient temperatures and sunlight. The stable hydrogen production can be achieved by combining thermoelectric units (2 in series) and electrocatalytic modules. It is envisaged that the design will promote the further development of photothermal functional devices toward use in commercial applications, help overcome problems associated with the energy crisis, and provide a practical reference for the design of solar-driven functional devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000741342800001

During this period of time, surfaces were jointly characterized by electrochemical techniques in situ ( electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, EIS) and spectroscopic techniques ex situ (X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS). The results obtained by these techniques allowed for a description of electrical and chemical properties of the films of corrosion products formed at the 1018 steel surface. There is an interconversion cycle of chemical species that form films of corrosion products whose conversion reactions favor two different types of diffusions inside the films: a chemical diffusion of iron cations and a typical diffusion of atomic hydrogen. These phenomena jointly control the passivity of the interface attacked by the corrosive medium.									25	2	0	0	1	0	26			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000239141800060	16854148

The empty-space-in-silicon technique by which thin films of silicon can be formed by reorganization of regular arrays of cylindrical voids at high temperature may be such a concept if the high quality of the thin film could be ensured on centimeter-large areas. While previous works mainly investigated the influence of the porous array on the final structure, this work focuses on the practical aspects of the high-temperature step and its application to large areas. An insight into the defects that may form is given and the origin of these defects is discussed, providing recommendations on how to avoid them. Surface roughening, pitting, formation of holes, and silicon pillars could be attributed to the nonuniform reactions between Si, SiO(2), and SiO. Hydrogen atmospheres are therefore preferred for reorganization of macroporous arrays. Argon atmospheres, however, may provide high-quality silicon thin films as well, possibly even more easily transferable, as long as annealing is performed in controlled, clean, and oxygen-free conditions. Our experiments on large areas also highlight the importance of kinetics, which had not been considered up to now and which will require further understanding to ensure a complete reorganization over any wafer area.									45	1	2	0	1	0	47			0021-8979			WOS:000269060700033

This work presents an alternative route to produce ODS steels avoiding MA: STARS (Surface Treatment of gas Atomized powder followed by Reactive Synthesis).

Here, visible-light-enhanced electrocatalytic water reduction reactions on semimetal bismuth (Bi) nanorods were achieved. The Bi catalyst not only exhibited an ideal Faradaic efficiency of 98% for electrocatalytic hydrogen production, but also acted as a light absorber for improving the activity even under light irradiation up to 740 nm. As a result, the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency under simulated AM 1.5G illumination was reached to 0.82%, which is 2.7 times higher than that induced by plasmon Au nanoparticles. This conversion efficiency is attributed to the excellent solar light absorption property of Bi and the enhanced electron-transfer at the interface of Bi/electrolyte under irradiation. The low-cost Bi catalyst with the dual function could open a venue toward designing more-energy-efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production assisted by sunlight.					3rd International Workshop on Graphene and C3N4-Based Photocatalysts (IWGCP3)3rd International Workshop on Graphene and C3N4-Based Photocatalysts (IWGCP3)	MAR 23-26, 2019MAR 23-26, 2019		Wuhan Univ Technol, Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINAWuhan Univ Technol, Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000487838900035		
J	Popelkova, H; Im, MM; Yocum, CF								N-terminal truncations of manganese stabilizing protein identify two amino acid sequences required for binding of the eukaryotic protein to photosystem II and reveal the absence of one binding-related sequence in cyanobacteria								BIOCHEMISTRY				41	31			10038	10045		10.1021/bi020228u				AUG 6 2002	2002	Manganese stabilizing, protein (MSP) is an intrinsically disordered extrinsic subunit of photosystem 11 that regulates the stability and kinetic performance of the tetranuclear manganese cluster that oxidizes water to oxygen. An earlier study showed that deletion of the E-1-(3)G domain of MSP caused no loss of activity reconstitution, whereas deletion of the K-4-E-10 domain reduced binding of the protein kfrom 2 to 1 mol of MSP/mol of photosystem II and lowered activity reconstitution to about 50% of the control value [Popelkova et al. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 2702-2711]. In this work we present evidence that deletion of 13 or 14 amino acid residues from the MSP N-terminus (mutants DeltaS13M and DeltaK14M) does not interfere either with functional binding of one copy of MSP to photosystem 11 or with reconstitution of oxygen evolution activity to 50% of the control level. Both of these mutants exhibit nonspecific binding, to photosystem 11 at higher protein concentrations. Truncation of the MSP sequence by 18 amino acids (mutant DeltaE18M), however, causes a loss of protein binding and activity reconstitution. This result demonstrates that the N-terminal domain T-15-E-11 is required for binding of at least one copy of MSP to photosystem II. Analyses of CD spectra reveal changes in the structure of DeltaE18M (loss of beta-sheet, gain of unordered structure). Use of the information gained from these experiments in analyses of N-terminal sequences of MSP from a number of species indicates that higher plants and algae possess two recognition domains that are required for MSP binding to PSII, whereas cyanobacteria lack the first N-terminal domain found in eukaryotes. This may explain the absence of a second copy of MSP in the crystal structure of PSII from Synechococcus elongatus [Zouni et al. (2001) Nature 409, 739-743].									38	0	0	0	36	0	38			0006-2960			WOS:000177228000031	12146968

However, the photocatalytic properties are not explored up to date. In the present paper, the feasibility of NaXO2 photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting with the irradiation of the visible light is examined through band structure, the density of state, optical absorption and mobility based on the first principles calculations. The results show that the band edges of NaXO2 match to the conditions of the redox potentials of water splitting reaction. The high mobility of the electron and hole as well as the obvious difference between the mobilities of the hole and electron are identified. The strong optical absorption in the visible light range is also observed. All the obtained results suggest that NaXO2 is a promising candidate for the photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen with the irradiation of the visible light.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			0042-207X			WOS:000490044200032

Several copper oxides have recently been reported to be active catalysts for water oxidation. In this study, a heterogeneous copper-based water oxidation catalyst that is not an oxide has been reported for the first time. Single-crystal XRD studies indicate that the compound is a one-dimensional coordination compound incorporating copper paddle-wheel units connected through phosphine dioxide ligands. The catalyst exhibits an onset potential of 372mV at pH10.2, whereas an overpotential of only 563mV is required to produce a current density of 1mAcm(-2). In addition to cyclic voltammetric and chronoamperometric studies, an investigation into the effect of pH on the catalytic activity and the robustness of the catalyst using long-term bulk electrolysis (12h) is presented.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2196-0216			WOS:000394144300010

In this study, quantitative XRD by means of Rietveld refinement was employed to proportionate the mineral and glass phases of five fly ashes. The chemical environment of Si and Al in the fly ashes was investigated by Si-29 and Al-27 MAS NMR spectra. By counting the contributions of Al phase from mullite, the proportion of different coordination states of Al in the glass phase was speculated. The results reveal that the coordination number of Al is directly associated with the amount of alkali cations present in the glass phase for the most fly ashes, whereby higher the alkali content, the more four fold coordinated Al species are present in the system. Five and six fold coordinated Al as well as highly polymerized silicate species are also present in the glass structure of the fly ash. All these results point to an inherent inhomogeneous glass structure in fly ash. Despite that, a reactivity index derived from the NBO/T ratio (Non-Bridging Oxygen per Tetrahedral network former, e.g. SiO44-, AlO45-) modelled in a simplified glass setup, correlates well with the reaction heat of the geopolymers.

J	Arvidson, Rolf S.; Mackenzie, Fred T.; Guidry, Michael W.					Arvidson, Rolf/0000-0002-8997-1262			Geologic history of seawater: A MAGic approach to carbon chemistry and ocean ventilation								CHEMICAL GEOLOGY				362		SI		287	304		10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.10.012				DEC 20 2013	2013	We explore the relationship between atmospheric O-2 and CO2 evolution and seawater chemistry, with particular focus on the CO2-carbonic acid system and ocean ventilation, over the Phanerozoic Eon using a coupled biogeochemical Earth system model (MAGic). This model describes the biogeochemical cycles involving the major components of seawater (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, SO4, CO2-HCO3-CO3), as well as components (O-2, Fe, P, organic C, reduced S) central to long-term ecosystem productivity. The MAGic calculations show that the firs-torder input fluxes from weathering of continental rocks of Ca, Mg, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to the ocean varied in a cyclical manner over the Phanerozoic. The cyclicity is mainly the result of the impact of changing atmospheric CO2 levels, and hence temperature and runoff, on these fluxes, reflecting the nature of hothouse (greenhouse, high CO2 and warm) versus icehouse (low CO2, cool, and continental glaciation) conditions during the Phanerozoic. Uptake of DIC by seafloor basalt-seawater reactions also varied in a corresponding fashion to the weathering fluxes. The fluxes of Ca, Mg, DIC and other seawater constituents removed in oceanic sinks were also calculated and hence with calculated inputs and outputs of seawater constituents, the changes in seawater chemistry through Phanerozoic time could be obtained. Seawater pH increased irregularly during the Phanerozoic from just above 7 in the Cambrian Period, approaching modern average values in the most recent several millions of years. Calcite saturation state also increased with decreasing age. Both pH and calcite saturation state trends exhibited a cyclic overprint of hothouse and icehouse environmental conditions. Dissolved sulfate changed in a cyclical manner reflecting mainly variations in weathering and accretion rates and redox conditions, whereas dissolved potassium exhibited little variation in concentration.Using our "standard" model results for the chemistry of seawater and changes in atmospheric CO2 and O-2 as the basis for a series of sensitivity experiments, we vary the ventilation rate of the global ocean, and quantify the resulting changes in terms of processes such as net primary production, organic carbon burial and oxidation, pyrite weathering, and sulfate reduction. We use these preliminary results to discuss how changes in ocean ventilation affect atmospheric CO2 and O-2, and in turn exert changes in the sulfur, organic carbon, and inorganic carbon systems. We postulate that periods of slow plate accretion rates, associated with lower atmospheric CO2, vigorous deep water formation, cooler, drier climatic conditions and greater poleward temperature gradients are more likely to be associated with a strong thermohaline circulation, and thus "enhanced" global ocean mixing. Conversely, periods of higher accretion rates, higher CO2, higher average global temperatures with more equable poleward gradients, and higher sea levels resulting in extensive continental inundation, would be more likely to be coincident with times of reduced mixing of the global ocean. It is important to recognize that the scale of these changes depends on how major tectonic cycles (controlling chemical weathering, CO2 and temperature) in turn affect nutrient supply, global ocean productivity, and global ocean thermohaline circulation. The key to elucidating these changes lies in an understanding of the relationship between long-term tectonic evolution, which leads to changes in climate, sea level, and the global distribution of continental landmasses and the sedimentary environments they host, and the circulation of the global ocean.

These zones supposedly resulted from a process of dissolution of olivine by silica rich fluid residual from the trondhjemite magma, with crystallization of secondary minerals along a compositional gradient in the fluid phase. A zircon crystal inclusion in a large (4 cm) olivine porphyroblast was dated in situ via LA-ICP-MS U-Pb isotope analysis, yielding a weighted mean Pb-207/Pb-206 age of 2963 +/- 1 Ma, which coincides with granulite facies metamorphism and potential dehydration. Considering phase relations appropriate for the dunite composition, we deduced the talc forming conditions to be at temperatures of 600-650 degrees C and at a pressure below 1 GPa. This is supported by oxygen isotope data for talc, anthophyllite and phlogopite in the metasomatic zone, which suggests formation in the temperature range of 600-700 degrees C from fluids that had a delta O-18 of similar to 8 parts per thousand and a Delta'O-17(0.528) of about -40 ppm, i.e., from fluids that could have been derived from the late stage trondhjemite sheet.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2075-163X		WOS:000522452300084

In particular, a semiconductor assembled with dual cocatalysts, i.e., reduction and oxidation cocatalysts, can obviously enhance the photocatalytic performance because of the synergistic effect of fast consumption of photogenerated electrons and holes simultaneously. However, in most cases, noble metal cocatalysts are employed, which tremendously increases the cost of the photocatalysts and restricts their large-scale applications. Herein, on the platform of one-dimensional (1D) CdS nanowires, we have utilized the earth abundant dual cocatalysts, MoS2 and cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi), to construct the CdS@MoS2@Co Pi (CMC) core-shell hybrid photocatalysts. In this dual-cocatalyst system, a position to expedite the migration of holes from CdS, while MoS2 acts as an electron transporter as well as active sites to accelerate the surface water reduction reaction. Taking the advantages of the dual-cocatalyst system, the prepared CMC hybrid shows an obvious enhancement of both the photoactivity and photostability toward hydrogen production compared with bare 1D CdS nanowires and binary hybrids (CdS@MoS2 and CdS@Co-Pi). This work highlights the promising prospects for rational utilization of earth-abundant dual cocatalysts to design low-cost and efficient hybrids toward boosting photoredox catalysis.									44	4	0	0	2	0	44			0743-7463			WOS:000483439400007	31365263

Particularly, photo-driven nitrogen reduction has been attracted to a specific focus in the scientific community since it can be powered by limitless solar energy at ambient conditions. However, unsolved challenges have remained to date such as, electron-hole separation, low quantum efficiency, weak visible light harvesting, catalytic selectivity, N-2 adsorption, and activation. In this Review, the recent achievements and related approaches toward nitrogen fixation are presented. In addition, the discussions on mechanistic photofixation of nitrogen, catalytic engineering design, and the outlook for enhancing the photocatalytic performance of ammonia photosynthesis are also devoted.

However, the gapless energy band structure and the limited electrical conductivity restrict the capability of pristine graphene in catalytic reactions, which holds the key in energy conversion applications. Doping graphene with metals and non-metals individually or synergistically could create a highly porous structure and open a critical bandgap to enhance the electrical and photocatalytic properties of graphene, and thus enable a broad range of energy-related applications. Herein, we comprehensively review the recent advances in the research field of doping graphene and related applications in energy conversion and storage. We first introduce the motivation for doping graphene, and then present an in-depth understanding of different doping mechanisms, and discuss the resultant structural modifications and novel properties of doped graphene materials. The review also discusses and compares the principles and the developments in various synthesis methods for efficiently doping different types of graphene materials, including pristine graphene and graphene oxide. Following that, the recent applications of doped graphene in energy conversion and storage devices, namely hydrogen generation, fuel cells, CO2 reduction, secondary batteries, and supercapacitors, are demonstrated. Finally, the remaining challenges in the research field and an outlook on the future research directions of doped graphene for energy-related applications are presented.									11	2	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000635284900005		
J	Neumayr, P.; Hagemann, S. G.; Banks, D. A.; Yardley, B. W. D.; Couture, J.-F.; Landis, G. P.; Rye, R.								Fluid chemistry and evolution of hydrothermal fluids in an Archaean transcrustal fault zone network: the case of the Cadillac Tectonic Zone, Abitibi greenstone belt, Canada								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES				44	6			745	773		10.1139/E06-130				JUN 2007	2007	Detailed fluid geochemistry studies on hydrothermal quartz veins from the Rouyn-Noranda and Val-d'Or areas along the transcrustal Cadillac Tectonic Zone (CTZ) indicate that unmineralized (with respect to gold) sections of the CTZ contained a distinct CO2-dominated, H2S-Poor hydrothermal fluid. In contrast, both gold mineralized sections of the CTZ (e.g., at Orenada #2) and associated higher order shear zones have a H2OCO2 CH4-NaCl hydrothermal fluid. Their CO2/H2S ratios indicate H2S-rich compositions. The Br/Cl compositions in fluid inclusions trapped in these veins indicate that hydrothermal fluids have been equilibrated with the crust. Oxygen isotope ratios from hydrothermal quartz veins in the CTZ are consistently 2 parts per thousand more enriched than those of associated higher order shear zones, which are interpreted to be a function of greater fluid/rock ratios in the CTZ and lower fluid/rock ratios, and more efficient equilibration of the hydrothermal fluid with the wall rock, in higher order shear zones. An implication from this study is that the lower metal endowment of the transcrustal CTZ, when compared with the higher metal endowment in higher order shear zones (ratio of about I : 1000), may be the result of the lack of significant amounts of H2O-H2S rich fluids in most of the CTZ. In contrast, gold mineralization in the higher order shear zones appear to be controlled by the high H2S activity of the aqueous fluids, because gold was likely transported in a bisulfide complex and was deposited during sulfidation reactions in the wall rock and phase separation in the quartz veins.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0008-4077			WOS:000249431700003

It is expected that heteronuclear members could play an important role in the development of DACs, due to which the vast possible combinations of two different transition metal (TM) elements provide a large chemical composition space for the DAC design. Herein, to screen for efficient NRR DACs and, in particular, to further explore the synergetic effect as well as the TM combination pattern conductive to the NRR in the heteronuclear DACs, we have theoretically studied the NRR on TM dimer embedded N-doped porous graphene (TM = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu), denoted as M1M2@NG, and both homonuclear and heteronuclear DACs have been considered. Our results indicate that most of the M1M2@NG systems exhibit comparable or better intrinsic NRR activity than the stepped Ru(0001) surface in terms of the calculated limiting potential. In particular, the heteronuclear DAC VCr@NG exhibiting metallic conductivity and high stability has an ultralow limiting potential of -0.24 V for the NRR and a strong capability of suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Moreover, the synergetic effect for the heteronuclear DACs compared with the homonuclear counterparts has been studied in terms of energy and electronic structures. Based on this, we propose that combining a highly chemically active TM element (often the early TM) with another TM to form heteronuclear TM dimers on an appropriate substrate can help achieve efficient heteronuclear DACs for the NRR. Our studies not only highlight the important role of heteronuclear members in the application of DACs, but further provide a promising strategy to design efficient heteronuclear DACs for the NRR from the large chemical composition space.									47	0	0	0	2	0	47			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000620261000030	33554989

Experimentalists have also synthesized several derivatives, e.g., [Fe(OTf)(2)((E,H)Pytacn)] (E = -Cl (2), -CO2Et (3) and -NO2 (4)) and [Fe(OTf)(2) ((E,R)Pytacn)] (R = -F (5) and R = -Me (6)), and proposed that the E-substituted electron-withdrawing groups could improve the catalytic efficiency. However, the mechanism remains somewhat unclear, especially on the relative catalytic efficiency of these complexes. In this work, we propose an oxygen radical mechanism based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the six complexes. The crucial O-O bond-formation step is elucidated. Our calculations reveal that the Fe-IV-oxyl radical is the active species during the reaction, and the catalytic activities follow the sequence of (4) > (3) > (2) > (1) > (5) > (6), which agrees consistently with the experimental findings. Furthermore, we propose a simple charge-pair interaction model to characterize the effect of electron-withdrawing groups on the catalytic efficiency. It is clearly demonstrated that an electron-withdrawing group with a higher electronegativity is associated with a lower Gibbs free energy barrier for the O-O bond formation, which then leads to a more active catalyst. We also emphasize that the accurate description of dispersive interactions in DFT calculations is crucially important to retrieve the correct sequence of the catalytic efficiency. The theoretical insights provided in this work could be useful for the design of highly efficient Fe-based water oxidation catalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000434246300062	29785426

Using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy, and co-located structural microscopy, the classical hexaamineruthenium (III/II) couple shows the ET kinetics trend: monolayer > bilayer > multilayer graphene. This trend is rationalized quantitatively through the development of rate theory, using the Schmickler-Newns-Anderson model Hamiltonian for ET, with the explicit incorporation of electrostatic interactions in the double layer, and parameterized using constant potential density functional theory calculations. The ET mechanism is predominantly adiabatic; the addition of subsequent graphene layers increases the contact potential, producing an increase in the effective barrier to ET at the electrode/electrolyte interface.This combined experimental and theoretical study reveals the nature of electron transfer at graphene as grown on copper. The authors find that outer-sphere electron transfer occurs adiabatically with slower kinetics for multi- than for monolayer graphene.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2041-1723		WOS:000728559600011	34876571

In contrast to the widely studied growth mechanism of metal nanocrystals, the growth mechanism of metal oxide nanoparticles is still poorly understood. Exemplified by cobalt/manganese ferrite nanoparticles prepared by thermal decomposition, we reveal the growth mechanism and associated compositional segregations of bimetallic metal oxide nanoparticles by using transmission electron microscopy combined with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). We found that a two-stage heating protocol, involving a first-stage heating at a relatively lower temperature followed by a second-stage heating at a relatively higher temperature, is crucial to synthesize monodispersed ferrite nanoparticles. Controlling the reaction time of the first-stage heating can effectively decouple the nucleation stage and growth stage of ferrite nanoparticles, leading to monodispersed nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. EELS spectrum imaging further reveals previously unreported compositional segregations in the as-prepared ferrite nanoparticles, suggesting that an Fe-rich core formed at the nucleation stage and a Co-/Mn-rich shell formed at the growth stage. Our results provide useful insight into the synthesis of high-quality monodispersed metal oxide nanoparticles as well as a correct understanding of the surface chemistry and related physiochemical properties of spinel oxide nanocrystals prepared by thermal decomposition.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-6818			WOS:000408671800026

In this study, we report the use of an NiFe-layered double hydroxide nanoarray on a nickel foam (NiFe-LDH/NF) as both the precursor and nanoarray template toward the in situ fabrication of a highly oriented three-dimensional (3D) MOF nanoarray (Fe-0.1-Ni-MOF/NF). The as-prepared Fe-0.1-Ni-MOF/NF behaved efficiently as an earth-abundant electrocatalyst for alkaline water oxidation, requiring low overpotentials of 243 and 263mV to afford 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, respectively; moreover, its catalytic activity could be maintained for at least 20 h at a high current density of 150 mA cm(-2). Impressively, it also achieved high turnover frequency values of 0.018 and 0.086 O-2 s(-1) at low overpotentials of 250 and 300 mV, respectively.									68	4	0	0	5	0	68			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000465152700007

However, controlled synthesis of functional nanostructures with high electron conductivity, high reaction activity, and structural stability is still a formidable challenge for further practical applications. Herein, for the first time, we develop a facile, efficient, and general method for the oriented synthesis of precise Carbon-confined nanostructures by low-pressure vapor superassembly of a thin metal organic framework (MOF) shell and subsequent controlled pyrolysis. The selected nanostructured metal oxide precursors not only act as metal ion sources but also orient the superassembly of gaseous organic ligands through the coordinatiOn reactions under the low-pressure condition, resulting in the formation of a tunable MOF shell on their surfaces. This strategy is further successfully extended to obtain various precise carbon-confined nanostructures with diverse compositions and delicate morphologies. Notably, these as-prepared carbon-confined architectures exhibit outstanding electrochemical performances in water splitting and lithium storage. The remarkable performances are mainly attributed to the synergistic effect from appropriate chemical compositions and stable carbon-confined structures. This synthetic approach and proposed mechanism open new avenues for the development of functional nanostructured materials in many frontier fields.									43	3	0	0	0	0	43			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000418393300083	29131634

Specific objectives were the identification of the by-products formed and the evaluation of the toxicity of the irradiated solution compared to that of carbofuran. The experimental results, obtained treating an aqueous carbofuran solution (50 mg/L) by high pressure UV lamp (125 W), show that the insecticide is completely removed within 120 min. Several intermediate by-products have been identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) as a result of hydroxylation process of the 2,3-dihydro benzofurane ring and other reactions such as the cleavage of the carbamate group, the hydrolysis of ethereal moiety, radical coupling and decarboxylation processes. After 270 min of reaction the identified by-products were completely degraded and COD and TOC removals of 35 and 20% were measured, respectively. Toxicological analyses performed using the comparison procedure of the Microtox (TM) assay provided interesting clues concerning toxic effects of the photodegradation by-products. The results revealed a substantial increase of the toxicity during the first 15 min proving that photodegradation of organic contaminant could even lead to an increase of the toxicity of treated solution.					4th World Water Congress of the International-Water-Association4th World Water Congress of the International-Water-Association	SEP 19-24, 2004SEP 19-24, 2004	Int Water Assoc; AMEPA; ONEP; LYDECInt Water Assoc; AMEPA; ONEP; LYDEC	Marrakesh, MOROCCOMarrakesh, MOROCCO	1	0	0	0	1	1	2			1606-9749		1-84339-468-5	WOS:000227429400037

The high roughness of the Cu oxides used in previous studies on this matter adds complexity to this controversy and motivated us to prepare quasi-planar Cu2O thin films that displayed a CO2 reduction selectivity similar to that of oxide-derived copper catalysts reported in previous studies. Most importantly, when the post-mortem thin films were transferred for characterization in an air-free environment, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements confirmed their complete reduction in the course of the CO2 reduction reaction. Thus, our results indicate that the selectivity of the Cu oxides featured in previous studies stems from their enhanced roughness, highlighting the importance of controlled sample transfer upon post-mortem characterization with ex situ techniques.									24	3	0	0	2	0	26			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000479673200001	31310028	
J	Moon, Woohyun J.; Liu, Juewen								Replacing Mg2+ by Fe2+ for RNA-Cleaving DNAzymes								CHEMBIOCHEM				21	3			401	407		10.1002/cbic.201900344		OCT 2019		FEB 3 2020	2020	It has been proposed that Mg2+ and Fe2+ are very similar in interacting with ribozymes and some protein-based enzymes, but their activities with DNAzymes have yet to be studied. Here, the activity of Fe2+ as cofactor for a few RNA-cleaving DNAzymes is investigated. 17E is a well-studied DNAzyme that is active in the presence of many different divalent metal ions; it is highly active with Fe2+ with an apparent K-d of 29.7 +/- 2.3 mu m and a k(obs) of 1.12 +/- 0.11 min(-1) in the presence of 1 mm Fe2+ at pH 7.5. Fe2+ has 21-fold higher activity than Mg2+. Six different DNAzymes are then tested, and only the DNAzymes active with Mg2+ (17E, 8-17, and E5) are active with Fe2+. Fe2+ has 25 and one- to twofold higher activity than Mg2+ for the 8-17 and E5 DNAzymes, respectively. In pH>7 buffer and in presence of air, 1 mm Fe2+ results in a nonspecific degradation of the DNA strand due to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cleavage reactions in anoxic environment and antioxidant ascorbate can be used to overcome the effect of oxidation. The findings provide insights for potential DNAzyme catalysis in the early Earth, and they further support the similarity between Mg2+ and Fe2+ in enzyme catalysis.									10	3	0	0	5	0	11			1439-4227	1439-7633		WOS:000492073000001	31322805	
J	Fink, M.; Hillebrandt, W.; Roepke, F. K.					Ropke, Friedrich/0000-0002-4460-0097			Double-detonation supernovae of sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				476	3			1133	1143		10.1051/0004-6361:20078438				DEC 2007	2007	Type Ia supernovae are believed to be white dwarfs disrupted by a thermonuclear explosion. Here we investigate the scenario in which a rather low-mass, carbon-oxygen (C + O) white dwarf accumulates helium on its surface in a sufficient amount for igniting a detonation in the helium shell before the Chandrasekhar mass is reached. In principle, this can happen on white dwarfs accreting from a non-degenerate companion or by merging a C + O white dwarf with a low-mass helium one. In this scenario, the helium detonation is thought to trigger a secondary detonation in the C + O core. It is therefore called the '' double-detonation sub-Chandrasekhar '' supernova model. By means of a set of numerical simulations, we investigate the robustness of this explosion mechanism for generic 1-M(circle dot) models and analyze its observable predictions. Also a resolution dependence in numerical simulations is analyzed. Hydrodynamic simulations of the double-detonation sub-Chandrasekhar scenario are conducted in two and three spatial dimensions. The propagation of thermonuclear detonation fronts, both in helium and in the carbon-oxygen mixture, is computed by means of both a level-set function and a simplified description for nuclear reactions. The decision whether a secondary detonation is triggered in the white dwarf's core or not is made based on criteria given in the literature. In a parameter study involving different initial flame geometries for He-shell masses of 0.2 and 0.1 M(circle dot) (and thus 0.8 and 0.9 M(circle dot) of C + O), we find that a secondary detonation ignition is a very robust process. Converging shock waves originating from the detonation in the He shell generate the conditions for a detonation near the center of the white dwarf in most of the cases considered. Finally, we follow the complete evolution of three selected models with 0.2 M(circle dot) of He through the C/O-detonation phase and obtain (56)Ni-masses of about 0.40 to 0.45 M(circle dot). Although we have not done a complete scan of the possible parameter space, our results show that sub-Chandrasekhar models are not good candidates for normal or sub-luminous type Ia supernovae. The chemical composition of the ejecta features significant amounts of (56)Ni in the outer layers at high expansion velocities, which is inconsistent with near-maximum spectra.									155	5	0	0	1	0	155			0004-6361			WOS:000251507500009

A major effect of heat stress at 46-48 degrees C on the chlorophyll a fluorescence transients was the appearance of a very clear K step at 200-300 mu s for both peel types. The K step was slightly more pronounced in the sun-exposed peel than in the shaded peel, suggesting that the resistance of oxygen-evolving complex to heat stress is slightly lower in the sun-exposed peel than in the shaded peel. Minimal fluorescence (F-O), relative to the value at 25 degrees C, increased to a greater extent in the shaded peel than in the sun-exposed peel after exposure to 46-48 degrees C, but the temperature dependencies of F-O changes were similar for both peel types. Maximum quantum yield of PSII (F-V/F-M) decreased to a similar extent in the sun-exposed peel and the shaded peel as temperature rose from 25 to 44 degrees C, but the sun-exposed peel reached slightly lower values at 46-48 degrees C. Correspondingly, gross 02 evolution rate, relative to that at 25 degrees C, was also slightly lower in the sun-exposed peel than in the shaded peel at 46-48 degrees C. In response to heat stress, the ratio of QA-reducing reaction centers (RCs) to total RCs and the ratio of Q(B)-reducing RCs to QA-reducing RCs decreased, but both of them decreased to lower values in the sun-exposed peel than in the shaded peel at 46-48 degrees C, indicating that the capacity of electron transfer between P-680(+) and Q(B) via Q(A) was damaged to a greater extent in the sun-exposed peel than in the shaded peel. At each given temperature, dark respiration was similar between the two peel types. Overall, it appears that the exposure to higher surface temperature under high light does not make the sun-exposed peel more tolerant of heat stress than the shaded peel of apple fruit.

In this study, responses of Sargassum thunbergii to different concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 mg/L) of zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) exposure separately were studied for 15 days in laboratory-controlled conditions. The results show that the specific growth rates increased slightly under the lower Zn concentration treatment (0.1 mg/L) at the first 5 d and then decreased gradually, which were significantly reduced with the exposure time in higher Zn concentrations and all Cd treatments compared to respective control, especially for 1.0 and 5.0 mg/L Cd. Chlorophyll a contents showed significant increase in 0.1 mg/L Zn treatment, whereas the gradually reduction were observed in the other three Zn treatments and all Cd treatments. The oxygen evolution rate and respiration rate presented distinct behavior in the Zn-treated samples, but both declined steadily with the exposure time in Cd treatments. The P/R value analyses showed similar variation patterns as chlorophyll a contents. Real-time PCR showed that lower Zn concentration (0.1 mg/L) increased mRNA expression of rbcL gene, whereas higher Zn concentrations and Cd reduced the rbcL expression. Taken together, these findings strongly indicate that Zn and Cd had different effects on S. thunbergii both at the physiological and gene transcription levels, the transcript level of photosynthesis-related gene rbcL can be used as an useful molecular marker of algal growth and environment impacts.									4	2	0	0	2	0	6			2096-5508	2523-3521		WOS:000438791100031

The described gas-phase condensation method can be used to synthesize homogeneous and astrophysically relevant silicates with different compositions ranging from nonstoichiometric magnesium iron silicates to pyroxene-and olivine-type stoichiometry. Analytical tools have been used to characterize the morphology, composition, and spectral properties of the condensates. The nanometer-sized silicate condensates represent a new family of cosmic dust analogs that can generally be used for laboratory studies of cosmic processes related to condensation, processing, and destruction of cosmic dust in different astrophysical environments. The well-characterized silicates comprising amorphous Mg2SiO4 and Fe2SiO4, as well as the corresponding crystalline silicates forsterite and fayalite, produced by thermal annealing of the amorphous condensates, have been used as real grain surfaces for H-2 formation experiments. A specifically developed ultra-high vacuum apparatus has been used for the investigation of molecule formation experiments. The results of these molecular formation experiments on differently structured Mg2SiO4 and Fe2SiO4 described in this paper will be the topic of the next paper of this series.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000329097100067

Herein, scalable synthesis of ultrafine Cu(0)/Cu(i) catalysts supported on mesoporous titania microspheres is enabled by a one-step microdroplet confined assembly method. The extremely fast solute assembly in the microdroplet induces excellent metal precursor dispersion, reduces sol-gel crosslinking, and creates wrinkled microspheres with surface crusts and hollow cavities. This structural architecture allows the generation of an inner reductive gas environment during calcination in air to reduce Cu(ii) and create oxygen vacancy (O-V) sites in titania. The obtained catalysts exhibit excellent performance in the photocatalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for pollutant degradation. The Cu(0) species with a surface plasmon resonance effect and O-V-rich anatase facilitate efficient solar light utilization and charge separation. The intimate interface between Cu(i)/Cu(0) and anatase enables fast electron transfer and timely copper redox cycling to promote the activation of PMS.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000680882800001	34477651

We study how the temperature history can be intentionally modified by orienting flames either in an upward-firing or downward-firing configuration. We also investigate the influence of unintended residence-time modifications caused by sampling nozzles. These phenomena are investigated by experiments and simulations for the synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles from premixed iron-pentacarbonyl-doped hydrogen/oxygen flat flames. The experiments apply molecular-beam sampling with a particle mass spectrometer to measure particle sizes and a quartz microbalance to detect the presence of condensed matter. The simulations rely on a finite-rate chemistry approach with species-specific diffusion, particle dynamics are described by a bi-modal population balance model. It is demonstrated that the downward-burning flame forms a detached stagnation point, causing longer residence times at elevated temperature than an upward-or horizontally firing flame, permitting the growth of larger particles. These iron oxide particles are eventually formed in the recombination zone of the flame, but no condensed matter was found in the reaction zone. The experiments also observed the formation of particles in the preheat zone, but their composition and all aspects of their disappearance remain uncertain. Current models do, however, suggest the formation of iron particles and their subsequent evaporation and combustion. (C) 2018 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the crucial challenge for wastewater purification lies in the development of ferroelectric materials with improved functions and the design of advanced oxidation processes. Herein, Sr0.3Ba0.7TiO3 (SBT-0.3) nanocatalysts modified by PVP surfactant could significantly promote water recovery efficiency from the rhodamine B (RhB), which is as high as 98% by simultaneously collecting two types of energy sources of mechanical friction and temperature fluctuation from the natural environment for tribo-/pyro-catalysis under dark conditions. It was found that the samples containing PVP surfactant show significantly improved performance in the separation of charge carriers in comparison with those without PVP surfactant. The permanent polarization in SBT-0.3, coupled with the piezo-/pyro-potential, could generate internal field and therefore reduce charge recombination. It also helps to absorb charged species from the dye solution, which favors the reaction with active oxygen to cause the cleavage and breakdown of organic molecules. The mechanism of RhB decomposition mediated by SBT-0.3 ferroelectric is also discussed. This work favors us to in-depth understanding for the tribo-/ pyro-catalysis and hence proposes a new strategy to improve the water purification efficiency of ferroelectric nanocrystals.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000649665800005

Different nanostructures including flower, rod and film were obtained on bare silicon substrates by controlling the growth temperature between 650 and 800 A degrees C. The formation mechanism of these nanostructures is related to vapor-solid process and Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier. The crystalline phase and morphologies of the as-prepared AlN samples are investigated systematically. Their microstructures are observed by the scanning electron microscope. The X-ray diffraction results demonstrate that the AlN samples exhibit pure phase and grow preferentially along the c-axis. The Raman examination shows there is a strong stress at the interface between the AlN nanostructures and the silicon substrate. The photoluminescence properties indicate that AlN nanostructures possess a broad luminescence band, which can be divided into two subbands by Gaussian fitting, and they are ascribed to nitrogen vacancy as well as the oxygen impurity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000324325800059

In addition, we measured the refractive indices and dielectric constants of the dielectric films. The nanoporous SiCOH thin films produced in the present study were homogeneous and had well-defined structures, smooth surfaces, and excellent properties and, thus, are suitable for use as low k interdielectric layer materials in the fabrication of advanced integrated circuits. In particular, the vinyltrimethylsilane precursor, which contains only one vinyl group, was found to produce SiCOH films after PECVD and annealing at 450 degrees C for 4 h with the highest population of nanopores and the lowest electron density, refractive index, and dielectric constant.									31	0	0	0	0	0	32			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000248121600017

In this study, we fabricated a direct Z-scheme system consisting of defect-rich g-C3N4 nanosheets (DR-CNNS) crumpled nanosheets with defect-rich TiO2 (DR-Ti02) nanoparticles via a dual defective strategy. The optimized dual-defective rich TiO2/CNNS composite showed a superior PHE rate of "651.79 iimol/h with a turnover frequency of-419.311-1 as well as high stability and recyclability, which presented the highest value in single defective TiO2 or g-C3N4-based photocatalysts families reported previously. Furthermore, this protocol could also be extended to synthesize other dual defective g-C3N4/oxides (ZnO, SnO2, etc.) heterostructures. The improved photocatalytic performances could be ascribed to the following aspects: (1) rich dual defect, narrowing the band gap and providing more reactive sites for PHE; (2) intimate interface, facilitating interfacial migration and utilization of photogenerated charges; (3) Z-scheme structure, accelerating photogenerated electron-hole pair separation and thus leading to more efficient PHE. Our work highlights the critical role of defects in construction of Z-scheme system and provides the possibility of utilizing dual defective g-C3N4-based systems for other photocatalytic applications including CO2 reduction and water purification.									137	4	0	0	27	1	138			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000467661700039

The aim of this study was to understand effects of iron on both the physical and electrochemical properties of the otherwise inert sp(3)-rich ta-C matrix. As indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), even similar to 0.4 at% surface iron had a profound electrochemical impact on both the potential window of ta-C in H2SO4 and KOH, as well as pseudocapacitance. It also substantially enhanced the electron transport and re-enabled facile outer sphere redox reaction kinetics in comparison to un-doped ta-C, as measured with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) using outer-sphere probes Ru(NH3)(6), IrCl6, and FcMeOH. These increases in surface iron loading were linked to increased surface oxygen content and iron oxides. Unlike few other metals, an iron content even up to 10 at% was not found to result in the formation of sp(2)-rich amorphous carbon films as investigated by Raman spectroscopy. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations found all films to be amorphous and ultrasmooth with R-q values always in the range of 0.1-0.2 nm. As even very small amounts of Fe were shown to dominate the electrochemistry of ta-C, implications of this study are very useful e.g. in carbon nanostructure synthesis, where irregular traces of iron can be readily incorporated into the final structures.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7				2046-2069		WOS:000441685100057	35541961

Redox conditions in such zones associated with niches excavated in mudstone at the Horonobe Underground Research Laboratory (URL), which is believed to be generally representative of conditions that could exist in the EDZ of a repository, were studied with the aim of improving our understanding of factors that control redox conditions in such rock-groundwater systems. Groundwater Eh values around the niches have reducing values of less than -150 mV. The SO42- concentration, regarded as an oxidation indicator, is consistently as low as 1 mu mol L-1. Gas occupies > 50% of zone volumes, including CH4 and CO2 with traces of N-2 and O-2. Cores drilled from host rock around a URL gallery were analyzed, with no pyrite dissolution or precipitation of calcium sulfates being found. It is concluded that oxidizing conditions do not exist in the excavation-damaged zones, which is attributed to the suppression of air intrusion by the release of CH4 and CO2 from groundwater as pressures decreased and their accumulation in fractures. The modeling of oxygen diffusion into host rock further indicates that a reducing environment is maintained around the URL drifts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-7952	1872-6917		WOS:000518868200012

Little is known about the roles of PP2Ac proteins that are involved in plant responses to necrotrophic fungal pathogens. Sharp eyespot, caused by the necrotrophic fungus Rhizoctonia cerealis, is a destructive disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum), an important staple food crop. Here, we isolated TaPP2Ac-4D from wheat, which encodes a catalytic subunit of the heterotrimeric PP2A, and characterized its properties and role in plant defense response to R. cerealis. Based on the sequence alignment of TaPP2Ac-4D with the draft sequences of wheat chromosomes from the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC), it was found that TaPP2Ac-4D gene is located on the long arm of the wheat chromosome 4D and has two homologs assigned on wheat chromosomes 4A and 4B. Sequence and phylogenetic tree analyses revealed that the TaPP2Ac protein is a typical member of the PP2Ac family and belongs to the subfamily II. TaPP2Ac-4B and TaPP2Ac-4D displayed higher transcriptional levels in the R. cerealis-susceptible wheat cultivar Wenmai 6 than those seen in the resistant wheat line CI12633. The transcriptional levels of TaPP2Ac-4B and TaPP2Ac-4D were significantly elevated in wheat R. cerealis after infection and upon H2O2 treatment. Virus-induced gene silencing results revealed that the transcriptional knockdown of TaPP2Ac-4D and TaPP2Ac-4B significantly increased wheat resistance to R. cerealis infection. Meanwhile, the transcriptional levels of certain pathogenesis-related (PR) and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzyme encoding genes were increased in TaPP2Ac-silenced wheat plants. These results suggest that TaPP2Ac-4B and TaPP2Ac-4D negatively regulate defense response to R. cerealis infection possibly through modulation of the expression of certain PR and ROS-scavenging enzyme genes in wheat. This study reveals a novel function of the plant PP2Ac genes in plant immune responses.									10	0	0	0	7	0	10			1664-462X			WOS:000448859700001	30429858

Stacking, morphology and effects of thermal and chemical reduction are studied combining in-situ synchrotron radiation diffraction and atomic force microscopy with simulations. The GO flakes mimic the substrate morphology and present an almost perfect stacking for few-layer films (2-10 layers) when in-plane flake size is large enough. The interlayer distance is found to be 1 nm irrespective of the film thickness and drastic discontinuities upon thermal annealing are observed between 100 and 200 degrees C. Moreover, the short GO-GO distance (0.38 nm) observed at temperatures (500 degrees C) where oxygen content is still high indicates that stacking is mainly governed by embedded water molecules. The large interlayer distance (0.76 nm) in chemically reduced films and its robustness against thermal annealing are due to the folding of the edges of the flakes occurring upon the elimination of the functional groups. The central part of the flakes remains extremely flat contrary to what occurs with thermal reduction. These structural defects induced by chemical and thermal reduction processes are very probably the most important limitations for electrical conductivity in GO based electrodes.

A multiple alignment of 14 sequences of this protein from cyanobacteria, algae and plants is presented. The alignment allows the identification of fully conserved residues and the recognition of one deletion and one insertion present in the plant sequences but not in cyanobacteria. A tree of similarity, deduced from pair-wise comparison and cluster analysis of the sequences, is also presented. The alignment and the consensus sequence derived are used for prediction the secondary structure of the protein. This prediction indicates that it is a mainly-beta protein (25-38% of beta-strands) with no more than 4% of alpha-helix. Fold recognition by threading is applied to obtain a topological 2D model of the protein. In this model the secondary structure elements are located, including several highly conserved loops. Some of these conserved loops are suggested to be important for the binding of the 33 kDa protein to Photosystem II and for the stability of the manganese cluster. These structural predictions are in good agreement with experimental data reported by several authors.									24	0	0	0	23	0	24			0166-8595			WOS:000082819900002

Creating nanoporous perovskite oxides with abundant amounts of mesopores is one of the key challenges to realize perovskite potential for energy conversion and storage applications. Here, we report a novel, facile synthesis route that exploits the de-alloying process to transform bulk alloys into nanoporous lanthanum (La)-based perovskite oxides. The synthesized La-based perovskites display ultrahigh specific surface areas in the range of 8.10-20.13 m(2) g(-1) and a unique ligament-like porous framework. Our systematic ORR and OER tests revealed their high electrocatalytic activity and durability in an alkaline solution, which are consistent with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The synthesis route reported here opens up a new avenue to create a new generation of functional perovskite oxides that are applicable to other catalytic and electrochemical applications.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448412700010

It is clearly demonstrated that the as-prepared amount-optimized nanocomposite exhibits exceptional visible-light photocatalytic activities for CO2 conversion to CH4 and for H-2 evolution, respectively by approximate to 28-time (140 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) and approximate to 31-time (313 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) enhancement compared to the widely accepted outstanding g-C3N4 prepared with urea as the raw material, along with the calculated quantum efficiencies of approximate to 4.92% and 2.78% at 420 nm wavelength. It is confirmed mainly based on the steady-state surface photovoltage spectra, transient-state surface photovoltage responses, fluorescence spectra related to the produced center dot OH amount, and electrochemical reduction curves that the exceptional photoactivities are comprehensively attributed to the large surface area (85.5 m(2) g(-1)) due to the porous structure, to the greatly enhanced charge separation and to the introduced catalytic functions to the carrier-related redox reactions by decorating MnOx and coupling Au center dot TiO2, respectively, to modulate holes and electrons. Moreover, it is suggested mainly based on the photocatalytic experiments of CO2 reduction with isotope (CO2)-C-13 and D2O that the produced center dot CO2 and center dot H as active radicals would be dominant to initiate the conversion of CO2 to CH4.									129	15	0	0	17	0	130			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000423342400007

Accordingly, 7-day postnatal rats were subjected to unilateral common carotid artery ligation combined with 2 h of hypoxia (breathing in 8% oxygen) and their brains were examined by light microscopy at recovery intervals ranging from 0 to 3 weeks. Immediately following hypoxia, a large area with a pale staining border was noted occupying most of the cerebral hemisphere ipsilateral (IL) to the occluded common carotid artery; in approximately half of the brains the dorsomedial cortex of the contralateral (CL) hemisphere was also involved. Most neurons in the pale area had nuclei containing a coarse granular condensation of chromatin. Within a few hours, the majority of neurons in the IL hemisphere had developed pyknotic nuclei and clear or eosinophilic perikarya. After 24 h these changes had evolved in the majority of brains into coagulation necrosis (infarction) in the IL hemisphere and foci of selective neuronal necrosis in the CL cortex. Within a few days infarcts became partially cavitated, and by 3 weeks a smooth-walled cystic infarct had developed. Activated microglia/macrophages and reactive astrocytes were first seen at 4 and 24 h, respectively. No parenchymal neutrophilic infiltrate was seen at any time point.									120	1	0	0	104	0	121			0001-6322			WOS:A1995RT89000005	8546028

Specific O-2-transport proteins have long been considered unnecessary in Hexapoda (including Insecta), which acquire O-2 via an elaborate tracheal system. However, we recently identified a functional hemocyanin in the stonefly Perla marginata (Plecoptera) and in the firebrat Thermobia domestica (Zygentoma). We used RT-PCR and RACE experiments to study the presence of hemocyanin in a broad range of ametabolous and hemimetabolous hexapod taxa. We obtained a total of 12 full-length and 5 partial cDNA sequences of hemocyanins from representatives of Collembola, Archeognatha, Dermaptera, Orthoptera, Phasmatodea, Mantodea, Isoptera and Blattaria. No hemocyanin could be identified in Protura, Diplura, Ephemeroptera, Odonata, or in the Eumetabola (Holometabola + Hemiptera). It is not currently known why hemocyanin has been lost in some taxa. Hexapod hemocyanins usually consist of two distinct subunit types. Whereas type 1 subunits may represent the central building block, type 2 subunits may be absent in some species. Phylogenetic analyses support the Pancrustacea hypothesis and show that type 1 and type 2 subunits diverged before the emergence of the Hexapoda. The copperless insect storage hexamerins evolved from hemocyanin type 1 subunits, with Machilis germanica (Archeognatha) hemocyanin being a possible 'intermediate'. The evolution of hemocyanin subunits follows the widely accepted phylogeny of the Hexapoda and provides strong evidence for the monophyly of the Polyneoptera (Plecoptera, Dermaptera, Orthoptera, Phasmatodea, Mantodea, Isoptera, Blattaria) and the Dictyoptera (Mantodea, Isoptera, Blattaria). The Blattaria are paraphyletic with respect to the termites.									46	3	0	0	46	0	49			1742-464X	1742-4658		WOS:000264021900012	19236479

The synthesized material was applied for the photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB), a carcinogenic dye. The nanoparticles degrade 83% of RhB in the presence of visible light (589 nm) illumination. A negligible fall in the degradation percentage after 3 photocatalytic cycles and post catalytic properties demonstrate the excellent photostability of the nanostructure. The electrocatalytic performance of CZTS for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) through water splitting and charge storage reveals their potential applications for efficient electrochemical energy systems. The nanoparticles show excellent electrocatalytic performance for HER as indicated by the low Tafel slope. The Linear Sweep Voltametry (LSV) plot performed after 1000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles shows negligible loss of current confirming the good stability of the nanostructure.

Samples of halite and sulfates were systematically collected from a borehole intersecting the sequence. The chemical evolution of the original brine was investigated by X-ray microanalysis of primary inclusions trapped in halite. The original brines were of the Na-Mg-K-Ca-Cl type, being consistent with the mineral association of halite and minor anhydrite, Their solute content can be reproduced by evaporation of present day ocean composition in an open basin. However, some modifications are required. The inflow of a small excess of CaCl2 into the basin (1.2 to 1.9% of the total recharge) is required to explain the low SO4 values analyzed in fluid inclusions. The same inflow helps to explain more satisfactorily the low Na and high Cl contents. The back-reaction of the brine with previous Ca-sulfate that forms polyhalite could explain the low and variable K values analyzed. The excess of Ca with respect to present day seawater, and the formation of SO4-poor evaporite sequences is the rule rather than the exception in the geological record. We have not been able to assess the ultimate origin of the Ca excess in the basin. Nevertheless, the great variation of the SO4 content within short vertical distances (centimeter scale), suggests that these variations are due to processes taking place within the evaporite basin, rather than to changes in the composition of the ocean at a global scale. The isotopic composition of sulfur and oxygen was determined using samples of sulfates from the same borehole. The delta(34)S values of 21 samples analyzed show a narrow variation: delta(34)S = + 15.5 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand. The delta(18)O values of eight samples analyzed show a wider range of variation: delta(18)O = + 13.0 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand. None of the processes which modify the S values, such as sulfate reduction or additional sulfate sources (continental, recycling of sulfates from the margins), were clearly identified. The values of delta(34)S(SW) = + 15.7 to + 14.5 parts per thousand and delta(18)O(SW) = + 13.7 to + 12.2 parts per thousand for the sulfate dissolved in the Triassic ocean explain the delta values of the sulfates interbedded in the halite of the Lorraine basin, and most analyses reported in the literature.

J	Dong, Ruoyu; Yang, Zhou; Fu, Yixiao; Chen, Zhennan; Hu, Yaxin; Zhou, Yue; Qin, Hengfei								Aminated lignin chelated metal derived bifunctional electrocatalyst with high catalytic performance								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				580						152205	10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.152205				APR 1 2022	2022	The M-C-N type catalyst prepared by doping with non-metal elements and transition metal elements is considered as a substitute for traditional precious metals to play a more significant role in the electrochemical field. However, the uncontrolled reunion of metal particles has become the main factor limiting the improvement of its performance. Therefore, this work proposes using lignin as a carbon source, and amine groups with strong co-ordination ability are introduced into the structure through the surface modification strategy so that the metal is embedded in the carbon-based framework in a chelated form to control the particle size. Compared with the metal catalyst prepared by unmodified lignin, the metal catalyst prepared by amination modification exhibits a smaller particle size and more uniform dispersion. Electrochemical performance results show that the bimetallic catalyst AL-Ni/Co@GC supported by amine-based lignin exhibits catalytic activity comparing with commercial electrocatalysts Pt/C and RuO2 in ORR and OER, and also has higher stability and methanol resistance. This work not only provides a strategy for the controllable structure of carbon-based metal catalysts, but also has specific guiding significance for the design and development of cheap electrocatalysts and the utilization of new energy sources.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000762840900001

A giant internal electric field in the Z-scheme junction is built, enabling the charge separation efficiency to be enhanced dramatically by 8.5 times. Thus, g-C3N4/rGO/PDIP presents an efficient and stable photocatalytic overall water splitting activity with H-2 and O-2 evolution rate of 15.80 and 7.80 mu mol h(-1), respectively, approximate to 12.1 times higher than g-C3N4 nanosheets. Meanwhile, a notable quantum efficiency of 4.94% at 420 nm and solar-to-hydrogen energy-conversion efficiency of 0.30% are achieved, prominently surpassing many reported g-C3N4-based photocatalysts. Briefly, this work throws light on enhancing the internal electric field by interface control to dramatically improve the photocatalytic performance.									164	9	0	0	15	0	165			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000607521100001	33448048

Photo-anodes made of TiO2 nanorods surface-covered by crystals of cobalt Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework (ZIF-67), and photo-cathodes made of Rh:SrTiO3 particles surface modified by adsorption of molecules of trisdioximate hexa-chlorine cobalt (II) clathrochelate (Co(Cl(2)Gm)(3)(BCH3)(2)), have been prepared and used for water photo-oxidation and photo-reduction experiments, respectively. Both photoelectrodes have been characterized by SEM and cyclic voltammetry under illumination conditions. Charge transfer mechanisms have been investigated by photo-electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS). It is shown that for both systems, the presence of a co-catalyst increases the charge transfer kinetics, and that the trapping resistance is larger than the charge transfer resistance, at any operating potential.

J	Melguizo-Gavilanes, J.; Rodriguez, V; Vidal, P.; Zitoun, R.								Dynamics of detonation transmission and propagation in a curved chamber: a numerical and experimental analysis								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				223				460	473		10.1016/j.combustflame.2020.09.032				JAN 2021	2021	The dynamics of detonation transmission from a straight channel into a curved chamber was investigated numerically and experimentally as a function of initial pressure (10 kPa <= p(0) <= 26 kPa) in an argon diluted stoichiometric H-2-O-2 mixture. Numerical simulations considered the two-dimensional reactive Euler equations with detailed chemistry; hi-speed schlieren and OH* chemiluminescense were used for flow visualization. Results show a rotating Mach detonation along the outer wall of the chamber and the highly transient sequence of events (i.e. detonation diffraction, re-initiation attempts and wave reflections) that precedes its formation. An increase in pressure, from 15 kPa to 26 kPa, expectedly resulted in detonations that are less sensitive to diffraction. The decoupling location of the reaction zone and the leading shock along the inner wall determined where transition from regular reflection to a rather complex wave structure occurred along the outer wall. This complex wave structure includes a rotating Mach detonation (stem), an incident decoupled shock-reaction zone region, and a transverse detonation that propagates in pre-shocked mixture. For lower pressures, i.e. <= 10 kPa, the detonation fails shortly after ignition. However, the interaction of the decoupled leading shock with the curved section of the chamber results in detonation initiation behind the inert Mach stem. Thereafter, the evolution was similar to the 15 kPa case. Simulations and experiments qualitatively and quantitatively agree indicating that the global dynamics in this configuration is mostly driven by the geometry and initial pressure, and not by the cellular structure in highly compressed regions.

In this study, we describe a membrane-bound hemoglobin in the oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense (MnHb), which also expresses hemocyanin. MnHb cDNA was cloned using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) approach, which afforded a 1201 bp gene encoding a 193 amino acid polypeptide. Bioinformatic evaluation suggested MnHb is membrane anchored by N-myristoylation, and immunofluorescence confirmed its location in the membrane of chief cells in the gill. The effect of hypoxia on MnHb expression was investigated, and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blotting showed that MnHb was expressed almost exclusively in the gill. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed a significant increase in expression after 6 h of hypoxia, and levels peaked at 24 h due to oxidative stress. Exposure of cultured prawns to the stress inducer H2O2 significantly up regulated the expression of MnHb in a dose-dependent manner. MnHb may have a role in protecting cell membrane lipids from damage by reactive oxygen species. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, by means of density functional theory computations, we systematically investigated the potential of utilizing experimentally feasible transition metal-N-4/graphenes as NOER catalysts. Our results revealed that NO molecules can be moderately activated on a Co-N-4 moiety embedded into graphene, and the subsequent NOER steps can proceed to form either NH3 at low coverages or N2O at higher coverages. Especially, the computed onset potential of NOER on Co-N-4/graphene (ca. -0.12 V) is comparable to (or even better than) those on well-established Pt-based catalysts. Thus, Co-N-4/graphene is a promising single-atom-catalyst with high efficiency for NO electrochemical reduction, which opens a new avenue for NO reduction for environmental remediation.									55	1	0	0	4	0	55			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431621700027

The rate of the inactivation of electron transport by low pH was four times higher in TM than in PSII membranes. Ferricyanide accelerated the inactivation of PSII membranes but decreased it in the case of TM, Low pH treatment also greatly modified the fluorescence induction kinetics in both preparations, but significant differences have been found in the fluorescence induction kinetics of treated TM and PSII membranes. Calcium restored the electron transport activity and fluorescence induction kinetics in PSII membranes and TM, whereas diphenylcarbazide restored these functions only in PSII membranes. The reactivation of Ca-depleted PSII membranes was more effective in the dark, whereas the reactivation of TM required weak light. In the case of PSII membranes subjected to low pH citrate buffer, maximal reactivation was observed at 60 mM Ca2+ but for TM about 10 mM Ca2+ was required and 60 mM fully inhibited electron transport in TM during reactivation. These results indicate that the Ca-dependent inactivation of the acceptor side of PSII in TM after low pH treatment cannot be explained by the extraction of Ca2+ from the oxygen-evolving complex. It is rather suggested that the Ca2+ involved in this inhibition is bound to the acceptor side of the photosystem near to the Q(A)-non-heme iron binding site and may participate in the binding of a polypeptide of the PSII light antenna complex to the PSII reaction center.									3	1	0	0	2	0	3			0031-8655			WOS:000076540100017

CONVECTIVELY BOUNDED FLAMES IN C+O AND O+NE+MG CORES								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				420	1			348	363		10.1086/173565				JAN 1 1994	1994	We determine the speeds, and many other physical properties, of flame fronts that propagate inward into degenerate and semidegenerate cores of carbon and oxygen (CO) and neon and oxygen (NeOMg) white dwarfs when such flames are bounded on their exterior by a convective region. Combustion in such fronts, per se, is incomplete, with only a small part of the initial mass fraction burned. A condition of balanced power is set up in the star where the rate of energy emitted as neutrinos from the convective region equals the power available from the unburned fuel that crosses the burning front. The propagation of the burning front itself is in turn limited by the temperature at the base of the convective shell, which cannot greatly exceed the adiabatic value. Solving for consistency between these two conditions gives a unique speed for the flame. Typical values for CO white dwarfs are a few hundredths of a centimeter per second. Flames in NeOMg mixtures are slower. Tables are presented in a form that can easily be implemented in stellar evolution codes and yield the rate at which the convective shell advances into the interior.Combining these velocities with the local equations for stellar structure, we find a minimum density for each gravitational potential below which the flame cannot propagate, and must die. Although detailed stellar models will have to be constructed to resolve some issues conclusively, our results suggest that a CO white dwarf ignited at its edge will not burn carbon all the way to its center unless the mass of the white dwarf exceeds 0.8 M.. On the other hand, it is difficult to ignite carbon burning by compression alone anywhere in a white dwarf whose mass does not exceed 1.0 M.. Thus, compressionally ignited shell carbon burning in an accreting CO dwarf almost certainly propagates all the way to the center of the star. Implications for neutron star formation, and Type la supernova models, are briefly discussed. These are also applicable to massive stars in the approximately 10-12 MD range which ignite neon burning off center.									77	4	0	0	0	0	77			0004-637X			WOS:A1994MN70100029

Two prototypical CNT molecules with a carbene and a carbyne active site were selected, and this in turn defined two corresponding graphene molecules obtained by CNT unzipping. Their electronic and thermochemical properties before and after O-2 adsorption were compared using density functional theory at the B3LYP/3-21G' level, as implemented in the Gaussian03 software. The sensitivity of the results to the basis set used and the selected CNT diameter was also assessed. Despite significant curvature in a subnanometer-diameter CNT, more similarities than differences were revealed with respect to graphene, both in their charge density distributions and thermochemical properties. Contrary to intuitive expectations, the intrinsic activity of an edge site (at least in the prototypical O-2 chemisorption process) is therefore not significantly modified when graphene is rolled up into a nanotube possessing a relatively large degree of pyramidalization. Greater differences exist between armchair and zigzag edges in both CNT and graphene. Both undergo a two-step mechanism of O-2 adsorption, but O-2 dissociates only on the armchair edge. Non-dissociative adsorption on an isolated zigzag site has both a lower affinity and a higher activation energy than the dissociative adsorption on the armchair site. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Several analytical tools such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic, and energy-dispersive spectroscopic techniques were used to characterize the sample. The prepared material had average pore diameter of about 7-10 nm and the BET surface area of BiOCl was 40 m(2) g(-1). The analysis of hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) formation was performed by fluorescence technique. The intermediates and the final products of degradation were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-DAD-MS) technology. The degradation of nile blue (NB) dye was mainly attributed to the destruction of the conjugated structure, and after that the intermediates were transformed into small molecules mainly phenol, aniline, etc., which were mineralized to water and carbon dioxide. During three recycles, the catalyst did not exhibit any significant loss of photocatalytic activity, confirming that the photocatalyst is essentially stable. The NB oxidation was evaluated by the decrease in total organic carbon (TOC) content. The formation of NO3- and the evolution of CO2 revealed complete mineralization of aqueous NB during the photocatalytic process by this photocatalyst. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, commercialization of Li-O-2 batteries is constrained by a large charging overpotential caused by the sluggish electrode kinetics and low conductivity of the discharge product, resulting in unsatisfied energy efficiency and poor cyclability. In this paper, aiming to address these issues, we propose unique orderly arranged three-dimensional (3D) flower-like MoS2 nanospheres combined with carbon nanotubes (f-MoS2@CNTs) as an efficient cathode catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. Homogeneously dispersed CNTs on the surface of MoS2 can not only increase the electrical conductivity and thereby lowering the charge overpotential, but also maintain the structural integrity of the cathode, improving the cyclic reversibility. Benefiting from the unique 3D flower-like structure with an interconnected porous network and the excellent catalytic activity of MoS2, the Li-O-2 battery with a f-MoS2@CNTs catalyst achieved a lower charge overpotential (1.02V) and exhibited excellent cyclic reversibility with 141 cycles until the terminal voltage decreased below 2 V at a current density of 500 mAg(-1). The reasonable design of the f-MoS2@CNTs-based cathode thus provides a promising solution for practical applications of Li-O-2 batteries.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2196-0216			WOS:000446066100015

It is a first step towards improvement of technologies like alkaline fuel cells, some alkaline electrolyzes and metal-air-batteries by circumventing carbon degradation. A nickel-mesh was made hydrophobic and subsequently electrochemically coated with MnOx as electrocatalyst. By this, a carbon free GDE was prepared. The contact angle, specific surface area (BET), pore size distribution, crystal phase (XRD) and electrochemical properties were determined. The deposition scan rate (r(scan)) during dynamic MnOx deposition altered the macro surface structure, pore size distribution and deposited mass. High catalyst masses with high specific surface area were achieved by lower r(scan), but hydrophobicity was decreased. Impedance spectroscopy showed that higher MnOx mass will increase the ohmic resistance, because of the low conductivity of oxides, such as MnOx. The diffusion of dissolved oxygen is the major contributor to the total resistance. However, the polarization resistance was reduced by increased specific surface area of MnOx. It was concluded that the ORR and OER are limited by diffusion in this design but nevertheless showed reasonable activity for 10 mA cm(-2) corresponding to similar to 8 omega cm(-2) while references exhibited similar to 3.5 omega cm(-2).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000589642200001		
J	Wang, Liming; Wang, Qinggao; Ren, Fengzhu; Wang, Yuanxu								An unexpected interaction between a H2O2 molecule and anatase TiO2(101) surface								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				493				926	932		10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.07.032				NOV 1 2019	2019	In this paper, the interactions between a H2O2 molecule and anatase TiO2(101) (A-TiO2) surface are studied by first-principle calculations. It is found that a H2O2 molecular can adsorb or dissociate on A-TiO2(101) surface, in agreement with previous results. When a H2O2 molecule dissociates, Ti-mu-peroxide configurations may form. It should be noticed that a more stable Ti-mu-peroxide configuration is found in this paper. More interestingly, an oxygen atom of this dissociated H2O2 can enter into A-TiO2(101) lattice, i.e., forming surface (O-2)o. The energy barriers for formations of new Ti-p-peroxide and surface (O-2)o species are 0.30 and 1.28 eV, respectively, which explain previous experimental results that the formations of Ti-mu-peroxide and (O-2)o species are under lower and higher temperatures, respectively. The localized gap state of Ti-p-peroxide disappears after the formation of surface (O-2)o, and thus the recombination probability of electron-hole pairs should be reduced for the O-rich A-TiO2. These results can rationalize experimental results that the photocatalytic activity of A-TiO2 sample can be changed by H2O2 treating under different temperature.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000502007800010

In this study, we characterized the function of histone deacetylase701 (HDT701), a member of the plant-specific HD2 subfamily of HDACs, in rice (Oryza sativa) innate immunity. Transcription of HDT701 is increased in the compatible reaction and decreased in the incompatible reaction after infection by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Overexpression of HDT701 in transgenic rice leads to decreased levels of histone H4 acetylation and enhanced susceptibility to the rice pathogens M. oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo). By contrast, silencing of HDT701 in transgenic rice causes elevated levels of histone H4 acetylation and elevated transcription of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and defense-related genes, increased generation of reactive oxygen species after pathogen-associated molecular pattern elicitor treatment, as well as enhanced resistance to both M. oryzae and Xoo. We also found that HDT701 can bind to defense-related genes to regulate their expression. Taken together, these results demonstrate that HDT701 negatively regulates innate immunity by modulating the levels of histone H4 acetylation of PRR and defense-related genes in rice.									132	25	0	0	112	0	146			1040-4651	1532-298X		WOS:000310459000022	22968716	
J	Yang, Yang; Zhang, Qi; Chen, Baiyang; Long, Liangchen; Zhang, Guan					Zhang, Guan/0000-0001-7089-7536			Toward better understanding vacuum ultraviolet-iodide induced photolysis via hydrogen peroxide formation, iodine species change, and difluoroacetic acid degradation								FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING				16	5					55	10.1007/s11783-021-1489-0				MAY 2022	2022	Recently, a photochemical process induced by ultraviolet (UV), vacuum UV (VUV), and iodide (I-) has gained attention for its robust potential for contaminant degradation. However, the mechanisms behind this process remain unclear because both oxidizing and reducing reactants are likely generated. To better understand this process, this study examined the evolutions of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and iodine species (i.e., iodide, iodate, and triiodide) during the UV/VUV/I- process under varying pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions. Results show that increasing DO in water enhanced H2O2 and iodate production, suggesting that high DO favors the formation of oxidizing species. In contrast, increasing pH (from 6.0 to 11.0) resulted in lower H2O2 and iodate formation, indicating that there was a decrease of oxidative capacity for the UV/VUV/I- process. In addition, difluoroacetic acid (DFAA) was used as an exemplar contaminant to verify above observations. Although its degradation kinetics did not follow a constant trend as pH increases, the relative importance of mineralization appeared declining, suggesting that there was a redox transition from an oxidizing environment to a reducing environment as pH rises. The treatability of the UV/VUV/I- process was stronger than UV/VUV under pH of 11.0, while UV/VUV process presented a better performance at pH lower than 11.0.

These were prepared and compared by sol-gel and thermal oxidation. Compared with the wire mesh Ti/Ce-Mn/SnO2-Sb-La electrode, the results of experiment indicated that the electrode prepared by introducing S-doped GO into the active layer has a higher electrochemical performance, and that the oxygen evolution potential increased from 1.78 V to 2.12 V. Within 120 min, the degradation efficiency of phenol increased from 75.2% to 89.5%, and the mechanism of the electrocatalytic degradation of phenol was revealed. At the same time, the removal rate of COD increased from 65.5% to 79.8%. During the degradation of phenol, the tank voltage remained stable at a minimum of 4.6 V. The accelerated life experiments revealed that the electrode prepared by introducing S-doped GO into the active layer had an accelerated life of 1.5 times, when compared to the electrode prepared without any introduction, up to 2.73 h. Therefore, the introduction of S-doped GO in the active layer can effectively improve the performance and service life of electrodes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J	Dzik, JM								Molecules released by helminth parasites involved in host colonization								ACTA BIOCHIMICA POLONICA				53	1			33	64						2006	2006	Parasites are designed by evolution to invade the host and survive in its organism until they are ready to reproduce. Parasites release a variety of molecules that help them to penetrate the defensive barriers and avoid the immune attack of the host. In this respect, particularly interesting are enzymes and their inhibitors secreted by the parasites. Serine-, aspartic-, cysteine-, and metalloproteinases are involved in tissue invasion and extracellular protein digestion. Helminths secrete inhibitors of these enzymes (serpins, aspins, and cystatins) to inhibit proteinases, both of the host and their own. Proteinases and their inhibitors, as well as helminth homologues of cytokines and molecules containing phosphoryleholine, influence the immune response of the host biasing it towards the anti-inflammatory Th2 type. Nucleotide-metabolizing enzymes and cholinesterase are secreted by worms to reduce inflammation and expel the parasites from the gastrointestinal tract. An intracellular metazoan parasite, Trichinella spiralis, secretes, among others, protein kinases and phosphatases, endonucleases, and DNA-binding proteins, which are all thought to interfere with the host cellular signals for muscle cell differentiation. Secretion of antioxidant enzymes is believed to protect the parasite from reactive oxygen species which arise from the infection-stimulated host phagocytes. Aside from superoxide dismutase, catalase (rarely found in helminths), and glutathione peroxidase (selenium-independent, thus having a poor activity with H2O2), peroxiredoxins are probably the major H2O2-detoxifying enzymes in helminths. Secretion of antioxidant enzymes is stage-specific and there are examples of regulation of their expression toy the concentration of reactive oxygen species surrounding the parasite. The majority of parasite-secreted molecules are commonly found in free-living organisms, thus parasites have only adapted them to use in their way of life.									162	7	5	1	151	2	178			0001-527X	1734-154X		WOS:000236511600003	16410836

The precise identification toward active sites of catalysts and the monitoring of product information are highly desirable to understand how the materials catalyze a specific electrocatalytic reaction. For a long period, the identification of active sites and the cognition of corresponding catalytic mechanisms are generally based on various ex situ characterization methods which actually could not capture dynamic structure and intermediate information during electrocatalytic processes. With recent developments of in situ and operando characterization techniques, it has been extensively observed that most of the catalysts would undergo structural self-reconstruction as a result of electro-derived oxidation or reduction process of the catalysts at a given potential, often accompanied by the increase or decrease of catalytic activity as well as the change of catalytic selectivity. In fact, such structural self-change in the catalytic process does make it difficult to identify the true catalytically active sites efficiently, thus hindering the understanding of the real catalytic mechanism. Therefore, we believe that understanding the self-reconstruction by the combination of reliable characterization techniques and theoretical calculations holds the key to rational design of advanced catalysts.In this Account, we provide in-depth insights into recent progress regarding structural self-reconstruction of electrocatalysts in several typical electrochemical reactions with the emphasis on fundamental knowledge, structure property relationships, structural evolution process, and modulation of self-reconstruction. To deliver a clear understanding, it has to be pointed out in advance that these catalysts with drastic structural and activity self-change in electrocatalytic processes are suggested to be called precatalysts under nonreaction conditions. The restructured active components in realistic reaction conditions are true catalysts. The structural self-reconstruction process bridges the precatalysts with true catalysts. To understand the self-reconstruction behavior, the following three critical aspects will be carefully disclosed and discussed in depth. First, fundamental origin of structural self-reconstruction of electrocatalysts is introduced. It is noteworthy that the atomic-level correlations between the self-reconstruction behavior and intrinsic structure of precatalysts are emphasized due to the fact that even if some precatalysts are congeneric, they often exhibit a diverse self-reconstruction phenomenon and catalytic performance. Second, the self reconstruction process should be monitored by advanced characterization techniques, which is central to precisely unveil the self-reconstruction behavior. In situ or operando characterizations have been considered as judicious methods to track the self reconstruction, capture dynamic structure and analyze real-time reaction products. Finally, based on the dynamic structure and product information together with comprehensive theory calculations, the enhancement or degradation mechanism of catalytic activities can be unambiguously clarified. With thoughtful studies toward the complete self-reconstruction process of electrocatalysts, some feasible methods to tune the self-reconstruction and improve the performance can be rationally proposed. Based on this progress, we hope to provide new insight into electrocatalysis, particularly the self-reconstruction and true active sites of electrocatalysts, and then to offer guidelines for rational design of advanced electrocatalysts.									159	18	0	0	12	0	162			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000451245900040	30375841

GDC particles were well dispersed in the aqueous suspension at a pH of 9.0. The alternating current was achieved through the application of an asymmetric square wave voltage to the electrodes of the deposition cell. An optimum frequency of 1 kHz showed the best balance between the suppression of bubble evolution and enhancement of the particle migration. The deposit yield increased monotonically with increasing time under the AC-EPD with a frequency of 1 kHz, suggesting its great potential to fabricate tunable thicknesses of deposition layers. The quality of the GDC film improved with an increase in frequency. An optimum combination of forward and reverse voltages and half-widths of the pulses was found.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000485821100068

INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY				44	6			480	493		10.1093/icb/44.6.480				DEC 2004	2004	Basically all organisms can be classified as determinate growers if their growth stops or almost stops at maturation, or indeterminate growers if growth is still intense after maturation. Adult size for determinate growers is relatively well defined, whereas in indeterminate growers usually two measures are used: size at maturation and asymptotic size. The latter term is in fact not a direct measure but a parameter of a specific growth equation, most often Bertalanffy's growth curve. At a given food level, the growth rate in determinate growers depends under given food level on physiological constraints as well as on investments in repair and other mechanisms that improve future survival. The growth rate in indeterminate growers consists of two phases: juvenile and adult. The mechanisms determining the juvenile growth rate are similar to those in determinate growers, whereas allocation to reproduction (dependent on external mortality rate) seems to be the main factor limiting adult growth. Optimal resource allocation models can explain the temperature-size rule (stating that usually ectotherms grow slower in cold but attain larger size) if the exponents of functions describing the size-dependence of the resource acquisition and metabolic rates change with temperature or mortality increases with temperature. Emerging data support both assumptions. The results obtained with the aid of optimization models represent just a rule and not a law: it is possible to find the ranges of production parameters and mortality rates for which the temperature-size rule does not hold.

The negative impact of CO2, when added to the inlet gas stream, is seen to be mainly related to the C(2+)yield, while no evidence of carbonate phase(s) formation is found during the OCM experiments. The main degradation mechanism of the CMR is suggested to be primarily associated with the solid-state evolution of the BSCF phase rather than the presence of CO2. Specifically,in situXRD-CT and post-mortem SEM/EDX measurements revealed a collapse of the cubic BSCF phase and subsequent formation of secondary phases, which include needle-like structures and hexagonal Ba(6)Co(4)O(12)and formation of a BaWO(4)layer, the latter being a result of chemical interaction between the membrane and catalyst materials at high temperatures.									9	0	1	0	0	0	10			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000567772700018	32597462

Herein, a new class of well-defined 2D NiZn oxyphosphide nanosheets (NiZnP NSs) have been successfully engineered to support unique 3D PdRu nanoflowers (PdRu NFs) via a facile strategy. Such nanohybrids with abundant surface active areas and modified electronic structure exhibit a great enhancement in electrocatalytic activity for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), whose mass/ specific activities are 1739.5 mA mg(-1)/4.5 mA cm(-2) and 4719.8 mA mg(-1)/12.3 mA cm(-2), which are 8.3/9.0 and 8.3/9.5 times higher than those of commercial Pd/C catalysts, respectively. More interestingly, with the remarkable promotional effect of NiZnP NSs, such 3D-2D PdRu/NiZn oxyphosphide nanohybrids can even retain 72.4% and 70.1% of initial catalytic activity toward MOR and EOR for 1000 potential cycles with negligible morphological or compositional variations. The successful construction of this new class of electrocatalysts opens up a new way for designing 3D-2D nanohybrids with high performance for electrochemical reactions and beyond.									24	3	0	0	3	0	25			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000438246000043	29938253

In this work, salt-sealed molybdenum carbide was prepared using sodium molybdate and 2,6-diaminopyridine as the reactive raw materials, followed by continuous salt sealing and calcination of the precursor under an inert atmosphere. The morphology, composition and structure of salt-sealed molybdenum carbide were determined by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results indicate that salt-sealed molybdenum carbide has irregular morphology and includes nanoparticles and nanorods. A comparison of the TEM images of Mo2C with salt sealing (Mo2C/SS) and Mo2C without salt sealing (Mo2C) indicates that Mo2C/SS exhibits a smaller particle size. This suggests that salt sealing can efficiently avoid particle aggregation. The Brunauer-Emmett- Teller (BET) specific surface area of the catalysts was obtained from nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms. The increase in BET surface area from 2.55 to 8.14 m(2) g(-1) after salt sealing provides evidence for the formation of pores in the product. The results of XRD, EDS and XPS analyses show that Mo2C/SS has an orthorhombic crystal structure with molybdenum oxides on the surface, which may originate from surface oxidation. Considering the results of XPS and the turnover frequency (TOF) calculation, we can conclude that the formation of pores via salt sealing contributes to the exposure of more active sites, while simultaneously enlarging the contact area with oxygen. Therefore, higher molybdenum oxide content is generated on the surface, resulting in a lower proportion of active centers (molybdenum carbides) on the catalyst surface. Furthermore, the pseudo-capacitance generated by the faradaic reaction of molybdenum oxides is superimposed on the double-layer capacitance of Mo2C catalysts, which increases the double layer capacitance. Since the effect of pseudo-capacitance on Mo2C/SS is more significant, the TOF number declines after salt sealing. Compared with Mo2C, Mo2C/SS exhibits three features that promote HER mass activity: (1) the generation of large quantities of pores via salt sealing leads to an increase in the BET surface area and exposure of more active sites, which is beneficial for improving HER performance; (2) the porous structure and enlarged surface area pave the way for effective mass and charge transfer; (3) the decrease of the Tafel slope from 145 to 88 mV.dec(-1). In summary, salt-sealed Mo2C exhibited enhanced HER activity with an overpotential of 175 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2). The Tafel slope for HER on salt-sealed Mo2C is 88 rnVdec(-1). This can be considered as the proof of the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism with electrochemical desorption as the rate-determining step.									7	3	0	0	0	0	8			1000-6818			WOS:000448204200013

Herein, an effective strategy combing defect engineering and heteroatom doping is developed to expand the region covering visible light response and construct the active surface. A plasma-induced carbon doping (PICD) method is adopted to achieve a binary core-shell structure containing outer defect-layer shell of oxygen vacancy and inside crystalline anatase TiO2 core (similar to 5 nm). The outstanding photocatalytic activity for visible-light-driven degradation of RhB and MO originates from narrowed bandgap (similar to 2.30 eV) and improved photo-induced charge separation. Moreover, the excellent stability towards RhB degradation (100%) after 4 recycles exhibits the great potential applicability. RhB removal efficiency could reach to 100% even in the wide pH range from 3 to 11. Furthermore, the synergy effect by outside oxygen-vacancies layer and interstitial carbon doping enhanced the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performances significantly. This PICD technology can induce carbon doping and defect layer with active cites, which opens up a new way to design novel visible-light-responsive photocatalysis.

The composition of the composites depends on the electrolysis regimes, the charge of the dispersed phase particles and the electrode, as well as the precipitation rate of lead dioxide, and the concentration of the components in the solution. By varying the electrolysis regimes and the composition of the electrolyte, composites with a TiO2 content of up to 27 wt % can be obtained. The phase composition and texture of the resulting composites are determined by the electrolysis regimes and the composition of the electrolytes used. In addition, the presence of TiO2 particles in the electrolyte leads, as a rule, to a decrease in crystal size and an increase in the content of -phase of lead dioxide in the precipitate. Introduction of valve metal oxide particles into the lead dioxide materials generally results in an increase in OER overvoltage and in the rate of p-nitroaniline oxidative degradation due increasing the number of oxygen-bound particles firmly bound to the electrode surface and the parallel flow of photocatalytic processes at TiO2 centers, providing additional quantity of oxygen-containing oxidants of radical and peroxide nature. The use of composite materials as an active and transition layer of low-wearing anodes makes it possible to obtain electrodes with a long service lifetime.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2070-2051	2070-206X		WOS:000455664200007

They are monooxygenases that insert one oxygen atom into inert hydrophobic molecules to make them more reactive and hydro-soluble. Besides for physiological functions, the extremely versatile cytochrome P450 biocatalysts are highly demanded in the fields of biotechnology, medicine, and phytoremediation. The nature of reactions catalyzed by P450s is irreversible, which makes these enzymes attractions in the evolution of plant metabolic pathways. P450s are prime targets in metabolic engineering approaches for improving plant defense against insects and pathogens and for production of secondary metabolites such as the anti-neoplastic drugs taxol or indole alkaloids. The emerging examples of P450 involvement in natural product synthesis in traditional medicinal plant species are becoming increasingly interesting, as they provide new alternatives to modern medicines. In view of the divergent roles of P450s, we review their classification and nomenclature, functions and evolution, role in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and use as tools in pharmacology.									28	4	0	0	27	0	32			0033-183X	1615-6102		WOS:000382950500003	26364028

When used as photocatalysts for photocatalytic H-2 production, Pt/TiO2-001 showed 1156 and 3 times higher H-2 evolution rate than that of cocatalyst-free TiO2-001 and Pt-cocatalyzed TiO2-101. The significantly improved photo-catalytic performance was attributed to the efficient separation of high-energy electrons and the sufficient exposure of reactive sites. This study demonstrates a promising way to design single-atom-assisted photocatalysts for high-efficiency water splitting.									36	3	0	0	4	0	37			0743-7463			WOS:000456349700008	30580513

Here, we present a detailed case study of xenoliths of amphibole-rich cumulate from the Zhazhalong intrusive suite, Gangdese arc, which enables an investigation of this differentiation process using a combination of petrological observations and in situ geochemical constraints. Evidence that the xenoliths represent fragments of igneous cumulates includes: (1) the presence of an amphibole-dominated crystal framework; (2) mineral and whole-rock Fe-Mg exchange coefficients; (3) rare-earth element patterns that are similar in the amphiboles and the xenoliths; (4) the compositions of basaltic to andesitic liquids in equilibrium with amphiboles; and (5) enrichment of the xenoliths in compatible elements and depletion in incompatible elements. The amount of trapped liquid based on La, Ce, and Dy abundances varies from similar to 12 to similar to 20%. Actinolitic cores within amphibole grains likely represent reaction between olivine precursor and hydrous melt, as evidenced by their high Cr and Ni contents. Amphibole thermometry and oxybarometry calculations indicate that crystal accumulation occurred over temperatures of 857-1014 degrees C, at mid-crustal pressures of 312 to 692 MPa and oxygen fugacity between 0.4 and 1.9 log units above the nickel-nickel oxide buffer. Quantification of the major-element compositions of the parent liquids indicates that the Zhazhalong amphibole cumulates crystallized from basaltic to andesitic magmas, probably with a shoshonitic affinity, and with SiO2 contents of 46.4-66.4 wt%. Appropriate partition coefficients, calculated using a parameterized lattice strain model and an empirical partitioning scheme, were employed to calculate the trace-element compositions of the liquids in equilibrium with amphibole. Our results confirm that Dy/Yb and Dy/Dy* ratios, which decrease with increasing degrees of differentiation, can be used as robust signatures of amphibole fractionation. This work presents a direct snapshot of the process of amphibole fractionation and provides a natural example of the hidden amphibole "sponge" in arc crust. In particular, this study also suggests that some appinites likely represent amphibole-rich cumulates, which may help to explain the genesis of other unusual but petrologically significant rocks.									18	3	0	0	0	0	19			0003-004X	1945-3027		WOS:000509460100009

Up to 300 degreesC in dry air, nearly no evolution of the ellipsometric characteristics was detected, which can be explained assuming that the growth of the oxide layer stops shortly after beginning the exposure to temperature and air. Above this temperature, the changes of the ellipsometric characteristics pointed out a higher oxidation rate and a continuous growth of the oxide layer. In boiling water, we found that the kinetics of oxidation were as fast as when above 300 degreesC in dry air. Taking also into account atomic force microscopy measurements of the surface roughness, plausible scenarios for the oxidation process are inferred from our data. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we use examples from our work on common killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) to illustrate some important conceptual issues relating to TPCs in the context of using these curves to predict the responses of organisms to climate change. Phenotypic plasticity has the capacity to alter the shape and position of the TPCs for acute exposures, but these changes can be obscured when rate processes are measured only following chronic exposures. For example, the acute TPC for mitochondrial respiration in killifish is exponential in shape, but this shape changes with acclimation. If respiration rate is measured only at the acclimation temperature, the TPC is linear, concealing the underlying mechanistic complexity at an acute time scale. These issues are particularly problematic when attempting to use TPCs to predict the responses of organisms to temperature change in natural environments. Many TPCs are generated using laboratory exposures to constant temperatures, but temperature fluctuates in the natural environment, and the mechanisms influencing performance at acute and chronic time scales, and the responses of the performance traits at these time scales may be quite different. Unfortunately, our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the responses of organisms to temperature change is incomplete, particularly with respect to integrating from processes occurring at the level of single proteins up to whole-organism functions across different time scales, which is a challenge for the development of strongly grounded mechanistic models of responses to global climate change.

The genetic basis and evolutionary origin of this catabolic pathway in yeasts are unknown. In this study, we identified C. albicans genes encoding the enzymes involved in the degradation of hydroxybenzenes. We found that the genes coding for core components of the 3-oxoadipate pathway are arranged into two metabolic gene clusters. Our results demonstrate that C. albicans cells cultivated in media containing hydroxybenzene substrates highly induce the transcription of these genes as well as the corresponding enzymatic activities. We also found that C. albicans cells assimilating hydroxybenzenes cope with the oxidative stress by upregulation of cellular antioxidant systems such as alternative oxidase and catalase. Moreover, we investigated the evolution of the enzymes encoded by these clusters and found that most of them share a particularly sparse phylogenetic distribution among Saccharomycotina, which is likely to have been caused by extensive gene loss. We exploited this fact to find co-evolving proteins that are suitable candidates for the missing enzymes of the pathway.									14	0	1	0	13	0	14			1567-1356	1567-1364		WOS:000355322600003	25743787

Simulations are carried out for both pulse and afterglow phases, accounting for the temporal evolution of the composition of the gas between each pulse. Modelling results are computed for a dc current of 40 mA, pulse durations between 200 mu s and 10 ms, and pulse repetition rates ranging from 20 up to 1000 Hz. This work shows that the vibrational distribution function of N-2 molecules becomes more populated by increasing the pulse duration or the pulse repetition rate. A similar behaviour is also predicted for the final concentrations of NO(X), N(S-4) and O(P-3). It is shown that [NO(X)] increases with the duty cycle ratio independently of the pulse repetition rate, as observed experimentally under similar conditions. The influence of the pulse duration, repetition rate and number of pulses in the overall kinetics is analysed and discussed in detail.					30th International Conference on Phenomena in Ionized Gases30th International Conference on Phenomena in Ionized Gases	AUG 28-SEP 02, 2011AUG 28-SEP 02, 2011	Portuguese Fundacao Ciencia Tecnologia (FCT), Inst Plasmas Fusao Nucl-Lab AssocPortuguese Fundacao Ciencia Tecnologia (FCT), Inst Plasmas Fusao Nucl-Lab Assoc	Belfast, NORTH IRELANDBelfast, NORTH IRELAND	8	1	0	0	0	0	8			0963-0252	1361-6595		WOS:000304781800043

We demonstrate here this ability by an effective thermochemical pathway enabling us to control the structural evolution of fuel cell nanocatalysts from an Au-rich core/PtNi-rich shell to a Ni-rich core/PtAu-rich shell. The synthesis starts from the introduction of a third low-cost transition metal (nickel) into AuPt nanoparticles through a facile one-pot synthesis followed by thermochemical and electrochemical treatments. By exploiting the surface free energy differences among Au, Pt and Ni, the as-synthesized Au-rich core/PtNi-rich shell structure is transformed into a Ni-rich core/PtAu-rich shell structure, producing a significant multifunctional synergy in comparison with bimetallic PtAu nanoparticles. The surface enrichment of PtAu with slightly segregated Au, along with shrinking of Pt-Pt distances, is shown to enhance the dehydrogenation of methanol and effectively remove the surface carbonaceous species. The surface Au atoms facilitate maneuvering of the electrons in the oxidation reactions, whereas the positively charged PtAu rich surface resulted from electrochemical treatment enhances the oxidation activity. The mass activity of the nanocatalysts is shown to maximize as a function of Ni doping. The result is further supported by computational analysis of the adsorption energy of methanol on the nanoclusters, revealing that the increased catalytic activity correlates well with the decreased adsorption energy. These findings demonstrate an unprecedented ability to invert the core-shell structure of the as-synthesized nanocatalysts for electrocatalytic enhancement, which has significant implications for the design of noble metal containing nanocatalysts for fuel cells.									15	2	0	0	0	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000428089500024

Here, we report on the understanding of microstructure evolution and photoluminescence (PL) properties of BNNSs after extreme thermal processing in various kinds of ambient gases. With heating temperature increasing, the lattice rearrangement in BNNS gradually occurs, resulting in the enhancement of crystallization and a shape change tendency from sphere to hexagon. PL results show distinct impurity and/or defect-related UV emission with phonon replica features in the BNNS samples. After high temperature treatment, a newly generated similar to 338 nm UV emission is observed, which is attributed to the nitrogen vacancies on the surface of the nanospheres. Moreover, with the thermal processing temperature increasing, the concentrations of carbon- and oxygen-related impurities gradually decrease, resulting in the PL intensity changes. Especially, the-NH4+ functional groups have been introduced to the BNNSs surface after treated in NH3 atmosphere, leading to the formation of a broad PL band in the range of 350-440 nm. The findings not only give a scientific understanding on the structure-PL property relationship in BN nanostructures, but also make a significant impact on the development of BNNSs for practical applications in high temperature environments.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000413175300112

Here, for the first time, we reported a simple and convenient method to synthesize porous nanosheets of metal hydroxides by selectively etching amphoteric Al in CoAl layered double hydroxides on carbon paper (CoAl-LDH/CP), and then convert them into porous cobalt phosphide nanosheets on carbon paper (p-CoP/CP) via low temperature phosphidation. In contrast to pristine cobalt phosphide nanosheets on carbon paper (CoP/CP), p-CoP/CP has lower overpotential, Tafel slope and charge transfer resistance as well as higher electrochemically active surface area. The excellent electrochemical characteristics make it have outstanding catalytic activity and stability over the whole pH range. In 1.0 M KOH, the p-CoP/CP only requires an overpotential of 57 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2). To achieve the same current density, it only needs overpotentials of 39 and 60 mV in 1.0 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M PBS, respectively. To our knowledge, it is the best among those non-precious electrocatalysts used for hydrogen evolution in neutral solution. Moreover, this catalyst offers good durability over the whole pH range.									105	8	0	0	4	0	105			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000424224800015	29355259

We discuss the influence of physical ingredients on selected evolutionary parameters, finally presenting models which incorporate all the most recent updating of the relevant physics. The evolutionary behavior of such models is extensively investigated for selected choices about the cluster metallicity, discussing theoretical predictions concerning both cluster isochrones and the calibration of the parameter R in terms of the original amount of He in stellar matter. One finds that the "new" physics has a relevant influence on both these parameters, moving cluster ages into a much better agreement with current cosmological evaluations. This scenario is implemented by a further set of stellar models where element diffusion is taken into account. The comparison between theoretical scenarios with or without diffusion is presented and discussed. A discussion of current observational constraints in the light of the updated theory closes the paper.									132	0	0	0	0	0	132			0365-0138			WOS:000073288000004

These grains have C-12/C-13 ratios from II to 120, N-14/N-15 ratios between 1100 and 19000, initial Al-26/Al-27 ratios of less than 0.003, and, relative to solar system Si, deficits in Si-29 of up to 150 parts per thousand and enrichments in Si-30 Of UP to 510 parts per thousand. These isotopic signatures rule out the previously postulated nova or Type II supernova origin of the Z grains. Based on the predictions from a new asymptotic giant branch (AGE) star model it appears likely that the Z grains formed in the outflows of low-mass (<2.3 M.), low-metallicity AGE stars that experienced strong cool bottom processing during the red giant phase.									99	0	0	0	1	0	99			0004-637X			WOS:A1997XY50900026

The hot springs and hydrothermal calcite in the Himalayas are characterized by radiogenic Sr related to meta-morphic processes. Such metamorphism-driven processes have contributed significant amounts of radiogenic Sr to rivers and groundwater, which has affected the evolution of global seawater (SrSr)-Sr-87-Sr-/86 during the Cenozoic. However, whether such hydrothermal systems with highly radiogenic Sr occur in other continental collisional belts with intense metamorphism remains unknown, which hinders a better understanding of regional and global Sr cycles. Compiled (SrSr)-Sr-87-Sr-/86 ratios in surface water around the Tibetan Plateau show that the Qilian-North Qaidam region displays a higher (SrSr)-Sr-87-Sr-/86 ratio than other regions, except for the Himalayas. Here, we report (SrSr)-Sr-87-Sr-/86 ratios of a hydrothermal system on the northern margin of the early Paleozoic North Qaidam ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic belt, NE Tibetan Plateau. The high (SrSr)-Sr-87-Sr-/86 ratios (0.757-0.734) of the hot spring water and the acetic acid leachates of the surrounding rocks (gneiss and schist) with other isotopic tracers (e.g., oxygen, hydrogen, lithium, and boron isotopes) indicate that 1) Sr was exchanged during metamorphism between car-bonate and silicate phases in crustal rocks and the high (SrSr)-Sr-87-Sr-/86 ratio of the hot spring water was acquired from a deep water-rock reaction process; and 2) hydrothermal systems around the Qilian-North Qaidam region operate like those in the Himalayas. Mass balance calculations indicate that the metamorphism-forced hydro-thermal system plays a key role in delivering radiogenic Sr to rivers and lakes and yielding higher (SrSr)-Sr-87-Sr-/86/Sr-86 ratios in surface water around the Qilian Shan region than in the surrounding areas. The reactivated early Paleozoic Qilian orogenic belts with ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism caused by the India-Asia collision have significantly impacted the regional water (SrSr)-Sr-87-Sr-/86 ratio, suggesting that the reactivated old orogenic belts with intense metamorphic processes formed by continental subduction/collision can play a pivotal role in regulating past seawater (SrSr)-Sr-87-Sr-/86 evolution.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0883-2927	1872-9134		WOS:000799035900004

In this paper we describe the use of an alternative method that combines the advantages of the Biolog community-level physiological profile (CLPP) method, in which microtiter-based detection plates are used, with the ability to measure carbon dioxide evolution from whole soil. This method facilitates measurement over short periods of time (4 to 6 h) and does not require the extraction and culturing of organisms. Deep-well microtiter plates are used as test wells into which soil is placed. The apparatus to fill the deep-well plates and interface it with a second removable detection plate is described. Two detection systems, a simple colorimetric reaction in absorbent alkali and scintillation counting with radioactive carbon sources, are described. The methods were compared to the Biolog-CLPP system by using soils under different vegetation types and soil treated with wastewater sludge. We aimed to test the hypothesis that using whole soil would have specific advantages over using extracts in that more immediate responses to substrates could be obtained that would reflect activity rather than growth. The whole-soil method was more rapid and gave earlier detection of C source use. Also, the metabolic fingerprints obtained could discriminate between sludge treatments.									504	18	3	0	456	0	527			0099-2240			WOS:000187156200071	12788767

To correctly interpret the paleoenvironmental significance of clumped isotope-derived paleotemperatures, it is necessary to understand the temperature time domain in which solid-state C-O bond reordering is important. We address this question using a combination of laboratory and natural geological experiments on Paleozoic brachiopod shells. The laboratory experiments involve heating fossil brachiopod calcite at different temperatures and times to directly observe rates of C-13-O-18 bond reordering. The resulting Arrhenius parameters are indistinguishable from values previously determined for an optical calcite with similar trace element compositions. We develop an alternative kinetic model for reordering that accounts for non-first-order reaction progress observed during the initial several hundred minutes of laboratory heating experiments, and show that the simplified first-order approximation model (Passey and Henkes, 2012) predicts reaction progress equally well for temperatures and timescales relevant to sedimentary basins. We evaluate our laboratory-based rate predictions by studying brachiopod calcite from several sedimentary basins with independently constrained burial temperature histories. Specifically, we use the laboratory-derived Arrhenius parameters to predict the evolution of brachiopod calcite clumped isotope compositions during successive one million-year time steps reflecting the burial and exhumation temperature paths of each basin. While this exercise is limited by the relatively large uncertainties in the temperature histories of these basins, we find general correspondence, within error, between predicted and observed clumped isotope values. We present simplified temperature time diagrams for calcite showing domains where primary clumped isotope compositions will be preserved, partially reordered, and fully reordered. In conclusion, calcite samples dwelling at similar to 100 degrees C or lower for 10(6)-10(8) year timescales should not be affected by solid-state C-O bond reordering. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the lack of efficient, robust and inexpensive electrocatalysts for such electrochemical reduction has prevented its wide application. Herein, we report a novel single-atom catalyst, i.e., a single tungsten (W) atom anchored on N-doped graphyne (W@N-doped graphyne) as a highly efficient and low-cost electrocatalyst for the N-2 reduction reaction. The inert N?N triple bond can be sufficiently activated when an N-2 molecule is adsorbed on the W atom. A single atom of W coordinated with one N atom (doping into an sp-hybridized carbon atom) exhibits the highest catalytic performance with ultra-low onset potential of 0.29 V for N-2 reduction reactions. The distal mechanism' is identified as the most favourable catalytic pathway. Moreover, the improved electrical conductivity of W@N-doped graphyne compared to that of pristine graphyne can ensure better electron transfer efficiency during the reduction processes. Our study provides a novel electrocatalyst with excellent catalytic performance for electrochemical reduction of N-2 to NH3 under ambient conditions.									95	6	0	0	4	0	96			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000456147000061	30617364

The temperature, as well as the flow rate of the carrier N-2 gas and the reaction O-2 gas, plays an important role in defining the morphology of the SnO2 nanowires. Morphology and structure of the as-grown SnO2 samples are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Results show that all the samples possess a typical rutile structure, and no other impurity phases are observed. The morphology changes from rod to wire with the increase of reaction temperature. Ratio of length to diameter of the nanowires increases first and then decreases with the flow ratio of N-2/O-2 gas. The optimum synthesis conditions of SnO2 nanowire are: reaction temperature 780 degrees C, N-2 and O-2 flow rates being 300 sccm and 3 sccm respectively. In our growth process, the nanowire grows mainly due to the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth process, but both the VLS process and surface diffusion combined with a preferential growth mechanism play the important role in morphology evolution of the SnO2. Field emission measurements for Samples 1-6 are carried out in a vacuum chamber and a diode plate configuration is used. Relationship between the growth orientation, aspect ratio, density and uniformity of the arrays and field emission performances will be investigated first. Results reveal that the field emission performance of SnO2 nanostructures depends on their morphologies and array density. The turn-on electric field (at the current density of 10 mu A/cm(2)) decreases and the emission site density increases with tin oxide array density, and the turn-on electric field of Sample 5 (synthesized at 780 degrees C, nitrogen and oxygen flow rates being 300 sccm and 3 sccm respectively) is about 1.03 V/mu m at a working distance of 500 mu m. By comparison, for the turn-on electric fields of the not well-aligned SnO2 nanowire arrays we have 1.58, 2.13, 2.42, 1.82, and 1.97 V/mu m at 500 mu m. These behaviors indicate that such an ultralow turn-on field emission and marked enhancement in beta (similar to 4670) can be attributed to the better orientation, the good electric contact with the conducting fiber substrate where they grow, and the weaker field-screening effect. Our results demonstrate that well-aligned nanowire arrays, with excellent field-emission performance, grown on fiber substrate can provide the possibility of application in flexible vacuum electron sources.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1000-3290			WOS:000368826900042

However, present-day catalysts for the generation of multi-carbon products (C2+) suffer from ultra-high energy barrier for C-C bond formation and poor selectivity, which poses great challenges for practical application. Herein, we propose and evidence with first-principles calculations a novel catalyst for the conversion of CO into more value-added ethylene and ethanol under visible light, consisting of active Cu-B atomic pair decorated graphitic carbon nitride (Cu-B@g-C3N4). Our results show that the low coordinated Cu-B atomic pair anchored on g-C3N4 could effectively reduce the CO dimerization free energy barrier to a record value of 0.63 eV. This high catalytic performance stems from the moderate binding strength of the intermediates modulated by the asymmetric synergy of the atomically dispersed metal Cu and non-metal B that can break the linear scaling relationship of traditional transitional metal catalysts. Moreover, the low-coordinated Cu-B active site with synergistic d-p coupling can significantly suppress the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction. Compared to pure g-C3N4, the Cu-B@g-C3N4 catalyst also becomes more optically active under visible and even infrared light. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the Cu-B@g-C3N4 catalyst possesses a high thermal stability. Considering that efficient catalysts for C2+ production are currently essentially limited to Cu-bimetallic systems, our work highlights a fully new concept towards the development of novel CO reduction catalysts based on synergistic coupling between metal Cu and non-metal atoms.									37	3	0	0	0	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000505561500008

The driving force of the ion transport process in the mixed ion-electron conductor (MIEC) electrodes is recapitulated. Qualitative and quantitative analyses are conducted on the so-called "bulk diffusion'' process, along with experimental verification through the (LaSr)(CoFe)O3-delta cathode. It is proven that an electrical field will be present inside the MIEC electrode, which drives the motion of ions along with the concentration gradient. In the steady state, the distributions of c(e), c(v), phi, etc. are obtained. The impact of this electrical field on the electrode kinetics and stability is discussed. It is revealed that: (a) the equivalent Po-2 at the interface calculated according to the overpotential and the Nernst equation could overestimate the stability concern. (b) From the viewpoint of the bulk pathway, polarization is not necessarily a beneficial factor, which could open up, or shut down the bulk pathway depending on the ionic defect type. (c) The electrical field can also drive the motion of cations, leading to composition evolution near the interface in materials with relatively rich cation vacancies.									13	0	1	0	0	0	13			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000408671600063	28825427

The other half-reaction, which is the two-electron oxidation of water, still remains elusive toward H2O2 production. However, enabling this water oxidation pathway is critically important to improve the yield and maximize atom utilization efficiency. It is shown that introducing acetylene (-C(sic)C-) or diacetylene (-C(sic)C-C(sic)C-) moieties into covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) can remarkably promote photocatalytic H2O2 production. This enhancement is inherent to the incorporated carbon-carbon triple bonds which are essential in modulating the electronic structures of CTFs and suppressing charge recombinations. Furthermore, the acetylene and diacetylene moieties can significantly reduce the energy associated with OH* formation and thus enable a new two-electron oxidation pathway toward H2O2 production. The study unveils an important reaction pathway toward photocatalytic H2O2 production, reflecting that precise control over the chemical structures of polymer photocatalysts is vital to achieve efficient solar-to-chemical energy conversion.									89	7	0	0	12	0	88			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000499296300001	31782554

The nitrogen partial pressure was kept constant during every deposition whereas that of the water vapour was systematically changed from 0 to 0.1 Pa. These films were made at room temperature (293 K) (set A) and at 673 K (set B). The study consisted in comparing the evolution of deposition parameters like target potential or deposition rate and physical properties of films for each set. Elemental composition measurements obtained by RBS and NRA revealed a reverse and continuous evolution of nitrogen and oxygen contents. Structure and morphology of the films were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Films deposited at room temperature became amorphous with an increasing supply of water vapour. A higher substrate temperature led to significant changes of the crystallographic structure: from fcc TiN without water vapour to a mixture of anatase + rutile for large amount of water vapour. The optical transmittance spectra of the film/glass substrate system were measured in the visible region as a function of the water vapour pressure. For both sets A and B, optical transmittance was influenced by the water vapour partial pressure. Electrical conductivity measured against temperature was gradually modified from metallic (sigma(300 K) = 1.49 x 10(4) S m(-1)) to semiconducting behaviour (sigma(300) (K) = 2.15 S m(-1)) with an increasing supply of the water vapour partial pressure. Moreover, coatings prepared at room temperature exhibited a surprising maximum of the electrical conductivity for a small amount of water vapour (set A). Such surprising evolution vanished for set B with a restricted range of conductivity from sigma(300 K) = 1.1 x 10(5) to 7 x 10(2) S m(-1). (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Their combination with each other can further endow the derived SACs with extraordinary properties such as high loading, identical active sites, uniform coordination environment, distinctive metal-support interaction, and enhanced catalytic activities. In this review, we highlight the recent development in this specific research topic according to the types of substrates and focus on their applications in energy conversion field. Additionally, we also make a brief introduction to the synthesis and characterization methods for SACs supported on 2DM (SACs/2DM). Finally, the challenges and perspectives are summarized based on the current development status. It is believed that this work will make contributions to the rational design and fabrication of novel SACs/2DM, promoting their practical energy applications in the future.

We have shown that leaf senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana causes a significant reduction in the rate of oxygen evolution and net photosynthetic rate (Pn). The decline in photosynthesis is further aggravated by dehydration. During dehydration, primary photochemical reaction of thylakoids and net photosynthesis decrease in parallel with the increase in water deficit. Senescence induced loss in photosynthesis is accompanied by a significant increase in the activity of cell wall hydrolyzing enzyme such as beta-glucosidase associated with cell wall catabolism. The activity of this enzyme is further enhanced when the senescing leaves experience dehydration stress. It is possible that both senescence and stress separately or in combination result in the loss in photosynthesis which could be a signal for an enhancement in the activity of beta-glucosidase that breaks down cell wall polysaccharides to sugar to sustain respiration for metabolic activities of plants experiencing stress. Thus dehydration response of cell wall hydrolases of senescing leaves is considered as plants' strategy to have cell wall polysaccharides as an alternative energy source for completion of energy requiring senescence process, stress survival and maintenance of recovery potential of energy deficit cells in the background of loss in photosynthesis. Withdrawal of stress (rehydration) distinctly exhibits recovery of photosynthesis and suppression of enzyme activity. Retention of the signaling for sugar reprogramming through breakdown of cell wall polysaccharides in the senescing leaves exposed to severe drought stress suggests that senescing leaves like mature ones possess potential for stress recovery.The precise mechanism of stress adaptation of senescing leaves is yet to be known. A significant accumulation of anthocyanin and flavonoids may be an indicator of stress adaptation of senescing leaves. In addition, stress induced enhancement of nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ), a stress protection provision in green plants, also suggests the potential of the leaves to develop adaptational mechanism to counter the dehydration stress.

To evaluate the isotopic variations caused by this catastrophic event, 140 carbonate samples from four sections were collected and analyzed. The delta C-13(carb) values in the upper section of the Qixia Formation gradually increased, stabilized at similar to 4.0 parts per thousand in the lower-middle sections of the Maokou Formation, and then abruptly decreased in the upper section of the Maokou Formation. This isotopic evolution trend is likely related to mantle plume geochemical processes occurring during these respective stages. Large amounts of upwelling heat from the emplacement of the mantle plume triggered large-scale decarbonation reactions in the continental crust resulting in CO2 production enriched in C-13. Substantial amounts of C-13-enriched CO2 directly affected the isotope compositions of marine carbonates during this time. Temporal and spatial fluctuations in carbon isotopes were also controlled by terrestrial materials as a result of regression and doming caused by plume emplacement. The abrupt decrease in delta C-13(carb) in the upper section of the Maokou Formation reflects the onset of volcanism, resulting in the breakdown of organic materials. These findings emphasize the contribution of a carbon reservoir (with a thermal decarbonation origin) in the upper crust, particularly against the Permian tectono-thermal background. This mechanism, which is similar to biological isotope fractionation in the carbon cycle, should not be overlooked.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1367-9120	1878-5786		WOS:000510956800002

Biofilms growing on the surface of the membrane tubes biodegrade DCE while avoiding direct contact between the DCE and the aerating gas. This reduces air stripping by more than an order of magnitude (from 30-35% of the DCE entering the system to less than 1%) relative to conventional aerated bioreactors. Over 99% removal of DCE from a waste-water containing 1600 mgl(-1) of DCE was achieved at waste-water residence times of 0.75 h. Biodegradation was verified as the removal mechanism through measurements of CO2 and chloride ion evolution in the bioreactor. No DCE was detected in the biomedium over the operating period. The diffusion-reaction phenomena occurring in the biofilm have been described by a mathematical model, which provides calculated solutions that support the experimental results by predicting that all DCE is biodegraded within the biofilm. Experimentally, however, the rate of DCE degradation in the biofilm was found to be independent of O-2 concentration, while the model predictions point to O-2 being limiting.									28	0	0	0	17	0	28			0175-7598			WOS:A1994PW48300038	7765782

To control and advance electrochemical reactions there is a need to develop realistic simulation models of the electrochemical interface to understand the interface from an atomistic point-of-view. Here we present a method for obtaining thermodynamic realistic interface structures, a procedure we use to derive specific coverages and to obtain ab initio simulated cyclic voltammograms. As a case study, the method and procedure is applied in a matrix study of three Cu facets in three different electrolytes. The results have been validated by direct comparison to experimental cyclic voltammograms. The alkaline (NaOH) cyclic voltammograms are described by H* and OH*, while in neutral medium (KHCO3) the CO3* species are dominating and in acidic (KCl) the Cl* species prevail. An almost one-to-one mapping is observed from simulation to experiments giving an atomistic understanding of the interface structure of the Cu facets. Atomistic understanding of the interface at relevant eletrolyte conditions will further allow realistic modelling of electrochemical reactions of importance for future eletrocatalytic studies.									36	0	0	0	0	0	35			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000486819500001	31430013

The catalyst panicles are added, to the electrolyte forming a suspension that is pumped through the electrolyzer. Particles with negatively charged, surfaces stick onto the anode, while particles with positively charged, surfaces stick to the cathode. The self-assembled catalyst films have self-healing properties as long as sufficient catalyst particles are present in the electrolyte. The proof-of-concept was demonstrated in a non-zero gap alkaline electrolyzer using NiFe-LDH and, NixB catalyst nanopowders for anode and cathode, respectively.

The intensification of the process viz. the improvement on the efficiency of H2O2 consumption, by increasing the temperature, is necessary to operate in a single step and avoid high reaction times and the need of large H2O2 and iron concentrations. This approach would allow taking advantage of the heat energy contained in the laundry stream since the washing process is performed at high temperature to assure disinfection of the hospital textiles. In this work, temperatures within the range of 50-90 degC have been tested, which allowed an effective oxidation of the real wastewater ([COD]0 = 365 mg L-1, [Phenols]0 = 8.4 mg L-1, [total coliforms]0 = 4.16 times 106 MPN/100 mL, 5 toxicity units) with the stoichiometric amount of H2O2 (1000 mg L-1) and a relatively low iron concentration (25 mg L-1 Fe3+). Operating at 90 degC, complete disappearance of phenolic compounds and 70% and 50% reduction of COD and TOC were achieved in 1 h reaction time. Time evolution of those global parameters were appropriately fitted to pseudo-first and second order kinetic equations, providing a useful approach for design purposes. The main by-products were short-chain organic acids (oxalic and formic), being the final effluents non-toxic. Disinfection of the hospital wastewater was also achieved at all the operating temperatures tested, as confirmed by the absence of coliforms.

Herein, the synthesis of multi-phase BiOx nanocrystals decorated by phosphorus dopant is reported through a facile one-pot solvothermal method. The resulting P0.15BiOx photocatalyst exhibited an optimal Cr (VI) reduction and RhB oxidation rates of 84% and 96% under visible light irradiation, being nearly 2 times higher than that of pristine BiOx sample. The improved photocatalytic performance could be ascribed to the synergetic effects of well-matched band positions via formation of new electron evolution pathway, efficient charge carrier mobility and introducing electronic defects by insertion of P5+ ions into the structure. Furthermore, DFT presented formation of mid-gap hybrid of p states, which enhanced the light absorption capacity. The photocatalytic mechanism revealed the photogenerated holes were dominant. Moreover, the P0.15BiOx had quite stable crystal structure and recycling ability. In this work, we obtained a single metal oxide with polycrystalline nature which obtains better charge separation compared to the pure phases, leading to capability of the photocatalyst for both photo-oxidation and photo-reduction processes. The present study provides new insights into the design of atomic-level structural defects in the photocatalysts by a facile method, for efficient removal of heavy metal ions and dyes from the wastewater.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			0038-092X	1471-1257		WOS:000575895400006

One-dimensional radial model of cold atmospheric plasma jet								2010 IEEE 37th International Conference on Plasma Sciences (ICOPS 2010)								1 pp.	1 pp.		10.1109/PLASMA.2010.5533940				2010	2010	Summary form only given. Recent development of atmospheric plasma sources capable of creating plasmas at or near room temperature has led to an increased interest in this technology from the medical community. Atmospheric plasmas have been routinely used for surface treatment and sterilization, however, the low temperature demonstrated by these new sources makes this technology attractive for applications dealing with living tissue. Plasmas have been found to effectively dispose of living cells and to reduce the migration speed of living cells<sup>1</sup>. This technology could thus be applicable in areas such as wound healing.In this paper, we analyze the temporal evolution of the plasma column using a numerical approach. We consider an axial cut of the jet and assume that for t<0, the region of interest consists only of the Helium working gas and the atmospheric gases, N2 and O2. At t=0, small electron population is introduced in the Helium beam. This electron population approximates the photo-ionization process occurring ahead of the stream head and has diameter corresponding the streamer head size. Ionization rates are then computed by considering chemical rate equations. Chemical equilibrium is also used to compute the production rates of radical species. Temporal evolution of the plasma column is computed from the continuity and momentum equations. Electrostatic forces acting on charged particles are obtained from the Poisson equation. Using the code, we compute the radial distribution of the reacting species at several times and compare with the measurements in Ref. 2.					2010 IEEE 37th International Conference on Plasma Sciences (ICOPS 2010)2010 IEEE 37th International Conference on Plasma Sciences (ICOPS 2010)	20-24 June 201020-24 June 2010		Norfolk, VA, USANorfolk, VA, USA	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-1-4244-5474-7	INSPEC:11470825

However, ligand-controlled catalysis for macromolecules, which differ from small molecules in penetrability and charge transfer behavior due to their bulky sizes, still remains undiscovered. Here, we systematically investigate the role of surface ligands in the photocatalytic performance of cadmium selenide (CdSe) QDs in light-induced atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) by using thiol-based ligands with various polarities and chain lengths. A highly enhanced polymerization efficiency was observed when 3-mercapto propionic acid (MPA), a short-chain and polar ligand, was used to modify the CdSe QDs' surface, achieving high chain-end fidelity, good temporal control, and a dispersity of 1.18, while also tolerating a wide-range of functional monomers ranging from acrylates to methacrylates and fluorinated monomers. Transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence studies reveal interesting mechanistic details of electron and hole transfers from the excited QDs to the initiators and 3-MPA capping ligands, respectively, providing key mechanistic insight of these ligand controlled and QD photocatalyzed ATRP processes. The thiolate ligands were found to serve as an efficient hole acceptor for QDs, which facilitates the formation of a charge-separated state, followed by electron transfer from the conduction band edge to initiators and ultimately suppressing charge recombination within the QD.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000653338400002	34241152

However, the origin of Ti-rich magnetite with ilmenite lamellae from iron oxide-apatite (IOA) deposits and other magmatic-hydrothermal systems remains highly debated. In this study, we present petrographic, textural, and elemental data for magnetite in disseminated, brecciated, massive, and vein ores from the Washan and Taocun IOA deposits of Eastern China to constrain the physicochemical parameters (i.e., temperature, oxygen fugacity, and coexisting fluid compositions) of magnetite formation and evolution in magmatic-hydrothermal systems. Two types of magnetite, primary high-Ti magnetite (1.49-4.89 wt % Ti) and secondary low-Ti magnetite (mostly 1 wt % Ti), have been widely identified in different types of ores. Primary high-Ti magnetite contains abundant, well-developed ilmenite lamellae that formed during oxy-exsolution processes at temperatures 550 degrees C. Field and microscopic evidence suggest that this magnetite was coeval with or slightly later than a hydrothermal mineral assemblage of albite, fluorapatite, and actinolite. This type of magnetite has a minor/ trace element (e.g., Ti, Al, V, Cr, Ni, and Co) composition that is distinct from typical igneous magnetite. We propose that the primary high-Ti magnetite crystallized from high-temperature, Fe-bearing hydrosaline liquids and present new criteria for discriminating high-Ti hydrothermal magnetite from igneous magnetite based on Cr, Co + Ni, and Ti + V + Al systematics (as determined by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry [LA-ICP-MS]). The high-Ti magnetite grains have subsequently undergone variable degrees of coupled dissolution-reprecipitation to produce trace element-deficient, low-Ti magnetite and newly formed titanite and rutile. This study highlights that high-Ti magnetite can precipitate from high-temperature hydrosaline liquids, which has implications in the evolution of IOA deposits and other magmatic-hydrothermal systems.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0361-0128	1554-0774		WOS:000789395900010

Herein, by amalgamating the architecture recommendations and energy band engineering principles into the design formulation, a novel Ag@CoFe2O4/g-C3N4 plasmonic p-n heterojunction photocatalytic system is designed and constructed for the first time. The Ag@CoFe2O4/g-C3N4 photocatalyst so designed, under the illumination of the visible-light (l > 420 nm), produced H-2 and O-2 in 2:1 stoichiometric amount at the rates of 335 mmol h(-1) and 186 mmol h(-1), respectively, with an apparent quantum yield reaching 3.35% at 420 nm, demonstrating that Ag@CoFe2O4 dimer colloids are responsible for oxidation and g-C3N4 for reduction. Moreover, in the presence of triethanolamine, the apparent quantum yield achieved by Ag@CoFe2O4/g-C3N4 is 16.47% with hydrogen produced at the rate 3.5 times higher than the CoFe2O4/g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalyst with AQY of 5.49%. The combination of Ag plasmonic effect and internal electric field established at the interface of p-type CoFe2O4 and n-type g-C3N4 boosts the separation efficiency of photoexcitons from CoFe2O4 to g-C3N4, extending the visible-light absorption capacity of the systems. The generation of optimum amount of defects like oxygen vacancies at the p-n heterojunction interface due to the structural distortion of CoFe2O4 also plays a prominent photocatalytic enhancement by providing active sites for the adsorption of water molecules for the light driven catalytic reactions. Our work introduces a potential avenue to design efficient photocatalysts by constructing several other suitable p-n heterojunction semiconductor photocatalysts toward practical application in solar energy conversion.(C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

These reservoirs were initially filled with oil, later replaced by gas during burial to 7000 m (22,965 ft) followed by uplift to about 4000 m (13,123 ft). We have studied the souring process (thermochemical sulfate reduction [TSR]) and diagenetic evolution of the Feixianguan Formation using detailed petrology, fluid-inclusion studies, and stable-isotope data from carbonate minerals. Pre-TSR diagenesis included (in time order) the eodiagenetic main stage of dolomitization by a reflux mechanism; fracture-related calcite cementation; barite, quartz, celestite, and fluorite mineralization; and a dolomite recrystallization stage. Thermochemical sulfate reduction resulted in anhydrite replacement by calcite, petroleum destruction, formation of sulfur-rich pyrobitumen and elemental sulfur, and generation of large volumes of H2S and CO2. Diagenesis during TSR can be subdivided into oil-stage TSR and gas-stage TSR, with oil-stage TSR defined by the presence of primary oil and bitumen inclusions in the TSR calcite. Based on aqueous inclusion homogenization temperatures, oil-stage TSR commenced at a temperature of 116 degrees C, with a mode between 130 degrees C and 140 degrees C. Gas-stage TSR started at a temperature of 135 degrees C and continued to maximum burial temperatures of about 220 degrees C. Trace amounts of pyrite, barite, quartz, and celestite grew during TSR. Post-TSR diagenesis was dominated by fracture-related calcite precipitation as well as celestite and anhydrite crystallization. Formation water salinity increased from depositional values (3.5 wt. %) up to 24 wt. % during pre-TSR dolomite recrystallization probably because of an influx of evaporite-associated water from the overlying Jialingjiang Formation, although pre-TSR barite, quartz, celestite, and fluorite mineralization was associated with a transient decrease in water salinity. During TSR, formation water salinity decreased from 26 wt. % to as low as 4 wt. % as a result of water being produced during TSR reactions.									57	3	0	0	0	0	58			0149-1423	1558-9153		WOS:000336416500004		
J	CHEN, JC; NIKSA, S								COAL DEVOLATILIZATION DURING RAPID TRANSIENT HEATING .1. PRIMARY DEVOLATILIZATION								ENERGY & FUELS				6	3			254	264		10.1021/ef00033a004				MAY-JUN 1992	1992	Our new flow experiment heats entrained coal suspensions by radiation from a near-blackbody enclosure, not by a preheated stream. Since the entrainment stream is transparent to radiation, it can be made to remain much cooler than the suspension. Pristine products which have been quenched as soon as they were expelled can be recovered or, alternatively, the extent of secondary chemistry can be regulated at will. The furnace system also includes rapid quenching to resolve reaction times on a scale of several milliseconds, aerodynamic segregation of particulate, aerosol, and gaseous products, and analyses for C1-C4 hydrocarbons, oils, CO, CO2, H2O, NO, and HCN. Balances on mass, carbon, and nitrogen are usually closed to within 5% in individual runs. Product distributions for transient devolatilization at nominal heating rates of 10(4) K/s are reported for four coals of ranks from subbituminous to low-volatile bituminous. They show that during the initial stage of primary devolatilization, coals of lower rank expel significant amounts of noncondensibles with their tar, but predominant tar evolution is a distinctive feature of ranks of hvA bituminous and higher. Tars from this experiment have the highest H/C ratios ever reported, as well as the lowest proton aromaticities. Throughout primary devolatilization, their proton distributions shift from substantial fractions of beta- and gamma-protons to mostly alpha-protons. Yields of all gaseous hydrocarbons, carbon oxides, and water increase in proportion to the tar yields with no distinctive surges or lapses. The major C1-C3 hydrocarbons are CH4, C2H2, and C2H4 but oils are the major gaseous hydrocarbon product from bituminous coals. Aromatic hydrocarbons, especially tars, are the only shuttles for fuel nitrogen during the initial stage. During the later stage of primary devolatilization, no tars are expelled but additional C1-C2 hydrocarbons are generated, and distinct surges in the evolution of CO and H2O from coals of lower rank actually increase the rates of weight loss. Also, HCN appears for the first time during the later stage. H/C ratios for char from 0.3 to 0.4 and little residual oxygen signal the end of primary devolatilization.									67	0	0	0	1	0	67			0887-0624			WOS:A1992HW29600004

Current thermodynamic predictions made with FactSage (version 7.2) were found to overestimate the amount of dissolved Ca and the Ca in non-metallic inclusions. This was demonstrated in two ways. First, Al-deoxidized Fe was held in CaO-3 pct ZrO2 crucibles for 100-136 minutes at 1873 K (1600 degrees C) and then reoxidized to precipitate dissolved Ca as oxide inclusions. The amount of Ca in the inclusions after reoxidation was quantified and considered equal to the dissolved Ca in the liquid Fe prior to reoxidation. Although experimental data were limited, the results suggested that the dissolved Ca was low and that the thermodynamic behavior of Ca could be best described by excluding Ca-O interaction. The assumption of no Ca-O interaction was compared with the associate solution model employed in FactSage by simulating the evolution of inclusion compositions in Fe-2, 1, 0.5, 0.1 wt pct Al alloys exposed to CaO (sat.)-MgO (sat.)-Al2O3 slags. The assumption of no Ca-O interaction led to predictions that were much closer to experimental results. More work is needed to ensure dissolved Ca behavior is accurately described and to ensure the sources for Ca modification of inclusions in industrial samples are properly identified.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000508705000002

The product distribution was studied by using some aliphatic alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, and tert-butyl alcohol) and inorganic and organic silver salts (sulfate, perchlorate, nitrate, fluoride, and acetate). Kinetic analyses were performed with an aqueous suspension containing 2-propanol and silver sulfate. Dependence of the initial formation rates of products (O2, acetone, and Ag) on the concentration of 2-propanol in suspension (C(p)) was analyzed on the assumption of a mechanism including reductive and oxidative trappings of pairs of photoexcited electron (e-)-positive hole (h+) by surface-adsorbed substrates. The mechanism implies facile recombination of the pair in the absence of the appropriate surface-adsorbed substrates, which react with the pair to produce free active species, e- and h+, with sufficient ability for subsequent redox reactions. It is presumed that coverage of surface sites with 2-propanol via Langmuirian adsorption determines the distribution of free h+ generated by the reductive trapping by silver ion (Ag+). The C(p) dependence of the rate in TiO2(A) suspension was consistent with the proposed mechanism and some kinetic and adsorption parameters were obtained. For the results in TiO2(R) suspension, it was necessary to suppose additional oxidation sites for not acetone but O2 production, suggesting the characteristics in the O2 evolution mechanism of TiO2(R). Dependence of the rate of acetone formation on the concentration of silver ion (C(a)) was also analyzed for both TiO2 suspensions. By using the parameters obtained from the C(p) dependence, the apparent C(a) dependence could be reasonably reproduced according to the proposed mechanism.									122	2	0	0	11	0	124			0022-3654			WOS:A1993KJ71900018

Ore-related alteration types which include biotite (+/- muscovite)-K-feldspar at the center of the mineralization zone, actinolite-albite alteration, and outer chlorite-epidote-calcite mineral facies, are observed in the Tepeoba mine area along the southern contact between the Karakaya Complex (mainly hornfels at the mine area) and porphyry Eybek intrusion. Porphyry style alteration pattern has been detected recognized in the porphyritic microgranite host rock. On the other hand, the calcareous and carbonate as well as the mineralized hornfels refer to the skarn style alteration pattern associated with a porphyritic felsic stock. Sulfide-rich stockwork and mineralized brittle brecciated, and fracture zones are associated with these hydrothermally altered wallrocks. Ore mineralogy includes chalcopyrite, molybdenite, pyrrhotite, pyrite, subordinate cubanite and native gold. These minerals are replaced by marcasite, hematite, and goethite in the oxidized cap rocks. EPMA data of the alteration and sulfide minerals revealed that Cu-, Fe-, Mo-sulfides partially replace biotite +/- muscovite-K-feldspar/actinolite-albite and chlorite-epidote-calcite alteration facies. The estimated ore formation conditions returned wide range of temperatures of 546-471 degrees C (biotite thermometry) to 340-264 degrees C (chlorite thermometry), at which sulfides had most likely precipitated while the oxygen fugacity of the magmatic-hydrothermal ore fluids was gradually lowered and developed during the stage of retrograde metasomatic reactions. Chalcopyrite and cubanite was likely to have formed via un-mixing of intermediate solid solution (iss) under oxidizing hydrothermal conditions. Under these conditions, thiosulfide complexes could have been responsible for the transport and deposition of gold. This also refers to native gold, which could have been liberated from sulfide ores (i.e., pyrite) in the oxidation zone due to the processes of supergene enrichment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000833284000001

The Milky Way bulge is an important tracer of the early formation and chemical enrichment of the Galaxy. The abundances of different iron-peak elements in field bulge stars can give information on the nucleosynthesis processes that took place in the earliest supernovae. Cobalt (Z = 27) and copper (Z = 29) are particularly interesting.Aims. We aim to identify the nucleosynthesis processes responsible for the formation of the iron-peak elements Co and Cu.Methods. We derived abundances of the iron-peak elements cobalt and copper in 56 bulge giants, 13 of which were red clump stars. High-resolution spectra were obtained using FLAMES-UVES at the ESO Very Large Telescope by our group in 2000-2002, which appears to be the highest quality sample of optical high-resolution data on bulge red giants obtained in the literature to date. Over the years we have derived the abundances of C, N, O, Na, Al, Mg; the iron-group elements Mn and Zn; and neutron-capture elements. In the present work we derive abundances of the iron-peak elements cobalt and copper. We also compute chemodynamical evolution models to interpret the observed behaviour of these elements as a function of iron.Results. The sample stars show mean values of [Co/Fe] similar to 0.0 at all metallicities, and [Cu/Fe] similar to 0.0 for [Fe/H] >=-0.8 and decreasing towards lower metallicities with a behaviour of a secondary element.Conclusions. We conclude that [Co/Fe] varies in lockstep with [Fe/H], which indicates that it should be produced in the alpha-rich freezeout mechanism in massive stars. Instead [Cu/Fe] follows the behaviour of a secondary element towards lower metallicities, indicating its production in the weak s-process nucleosynthesis in He-burning and later stages. The chemodynamical models presented here confirm the behaviour of these two elements (i.e. [Co/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] similar to constant and [Cu/Fe] decreasing with decreasing metallicities).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000564318500007		
J	Yang, TN					Yang, Tian-Nan/0000-0003-2675-6079			Retrograded textures and associated mass transfer: evidence for aqueous fluid action during exhumation of the Qinglongshan eclogite, Southern Sulu ultrahigh pressure metamorphic terrane, eastern China								JOURNAL OF METAMORPHIC GEOLOGY				22	7			653	669		10.1111/j.1525-1314.2004.00540.x				SEP 2004	2004	The Qinglongshan eclogites in the Southern Sulu ultrahigh pressure metamorphic (UHPM) terrane show very different retrograded textures from their counterparts in the Northern Sulu terrane, implying a different thermal history. Scanning electron and optical microscope observations indicate that the peak assemblage of the Qinglongshan eclogite is anhydrous, composed of Grt + OmpI + Rt + (Ky + coesite). These primary minerals were replaced by second and third stage minerals, resulting in symplectite pseudomorphs or coronas. The following relationships are inferred: OmpI --> OmpII + Ab + Fe-oxide symplectite (type I) and Rt --> Rt + Ilm intergrowth; and, Ky --> Pg, OmpII (+Pl) --> Amp (+Pl) symplectite (type II), and Grt --> Prg (+Fe-oxide). Mineral chemistry and mass-balance demonstrate that the pseudomorphed textures were developed by metasomatism involving dissolution and precipitation intensified by fluids along grain boundaries. The formation of symplectite type I produced Fe, Mg and Na but consumed Ca and Si. The Mg and Fe diffused to garnet where exchange of (Mg, Fe) with Ca of the garnet resulted in compositional zonation with decreased Ca towards the edge of garnet grains where Ca was consumed during symplectite formation. The replacement of kyanite by paragonite consumed the extra Na. In the later stage, fluid infiltration partially transformed symplectite type I to type II, and narrow rims of pargasite resorbed garnet from their boundaries. Mass balance suggests that the transformation and resorption would have been coupled during fluid infiltration. In the latest stage, epidote and quartz were precipitated at very late stage as a result of fluid activity along microfractures. Tentative P-T conditions based on mineral reactions and thermocalc software suggest that the retrograded eclogite did not record the granulite facies retrograde evolution characteristic of eclogites from the Northern Sulu terrane. The difference in retrograde evolution between the Southern and Northern Sulu eclogites suggests a different exhumation history.									39	10	1	0	1	0	42			0263-4929			WOS:000223907100004

The repair of oxygen-evolving photosystem II (PS II) supercomplexes in plant chloroplasts is a prime example of a very efficient repair process that evolved in response to the high vulnerability of PS II to photooxidative damage, exacerbated by high-light (HL) stress. Significant progress in recent years has unraveled individual components and steps that constitute the PS II repair machinery, which is embedded in the thylakoid membrane system inside chloroplasts. However, an open question is how a certain order of these repair steps is established and how unwanted back-reactions that jeopardize the repair efficiency are avoided. Here, we report that spatial separation of key enzymes involved in PS II repair is realized by subcompartmentalization of the thylakoid membrane, accomplished by the formation of stacked grana membranes. The spatial segregation of kinases, phosphatases, proteases, and ribosomes ensures a certain order of events with minimal mutual interference. The margins of the grana turn out to be the site of protein degradation, well separated from active PS II in grana core and de novo protein synthesis in unstacked stroma lamellae. Furthermore, HL induces a partial conversion of stacked grana core to grana margin, which leads to a controlled access of proteases to PS II. Our study suggests that the origin of grana in evolution ensures high repair efficiency, which is essential for PS II homeostasis.									61	2	0	0	59	0	62			0027-8424			WOS:000344088100057	25331882

Here, we present copper oxide-nickel oxide nanospheres (CuO-NiO@GP), copper oxide-cobalt oxide nanospheres (Cu2O-Co3O4@GP), CuO-NiO/carbon nitride nanocomposite (CuO-NiO/CN@GP) and Cu2O-Co3O4/carbon nitride nanocomposite (Cu2O-Co3O4/CN@GP) decorated graphite pencil as effective electrocatalysts for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER, HER). CuO-NiO@GP, Cu2O-Co3O4@GP, CuO-NiO/CN@GP and Cu2O-Co3O4/CN@GP were used as working electrode and revealed tremendous OER and HER activity at low over-potentials in KOH and H2SO4 solutions. Among, CuO-NiO@GP, CuO-NiO/CN@GP, Cu2O-Co3O4@GP and Cu2O-Co3O4/CN@GP, the superior catalytic activity is displayed by CuO-NiO/CN@GP which gave current density of 20 mAcm(-2) at potential of 1.411 V (overpotential = 0.181 V) by using 1.0 M KOH concentration. CuO-NiO/CN@GP demonstrated higher catalytic performance toward OER as comparing to CuO-NiO@GP, Cu2O-Co3O4@GP and Cu2O-Co3O4/CN@GP. Similarly, CuO-NiO/CN@GP need the lowest potential of -0.762 and -0.858 V to obtain the current density of 10 mAcm(-2) and 20 mAcm(-2) in HER catalytic performance utilizing 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Thus, it was observed from the LSVs of CuO-NiO@GP, CuO-NiO/CN@GP, Cu2O-Co3O4@GP and Cu2O-Co3O4/CN@GP that CuO-NiO/CN@GP shows greater catalytic activity and found more efficient and active in both OER and HER because CuO-NiO/CN@GP requires a low over potential, which produced 10 mAcm(-2) and 20 mAcm(-2) in both OER and HER. CuO-NiO/CN@GP demonstrates lower Tafel slopes of 171 mV dec(-1) and 129 mV dec(-1) in HER and OER, respectively. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The excellent electrochemical performance of CoFeP/CF can be attributed to the synergistic effect of cobalt and iron atoms, tuneful interaction between metal atoms and phosphorus, and the large electrochemical active surface area origined from its peculiarly hierarchical snowflake-like heterostructures with high surface roughness. With the small Tafel slope values (of 73.0 mV dec(-1) for OER and 90.4 mV dec(-1) for HER), CoFeP/CF demands the diminutive overpotentials (of 277.9 mV for OER and 152.6 mV for HER) to desire the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, CoFeP/CF exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance for the overall water splitting with the cell potential of 1.495 V to attain 10 mA cm(-2) in a two-electrode cell.

To test whether or not NH3 is able to replace substrate water molecules on the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II, we studied the effects of NH3 on the high-frequency region (3750-3550 cm(-1)) of the S(2)Q(A)(-)/S(1)Q(A) FTIR difference spectra (pH 7.5 at 250 K), where OH stretch modes of weak hydrogen-bonded active water molecules occur. Our results showed that NH3 did not replace the active water molecule on the oxygen-evolving complex that gave rise to the SI mode at similar to 3586 cm(-1) and the S-2 mode at similar to 3613 cm(-1) in the S(2)Q(A)(-)/S(1)Q(A) FTIR difference spectrum of PSII. In addition, our mid-frequency FTIR results showed a clear difference between pH 6.5 and 7.5 on the concentration dependence of the NH4Cl-induced upshift of the S-2 state carboxylate mode at 1365 cm(-1) in the S(2)Q(A)(-)/S(1)Q(A) spectra of NH4Cl-treated PSII samples. Our results provided strong evidence that NH3 induced this upshift in the spectra of NH4Cl-treated PSII samples at 250 K. Moreover, our low-frequency FTIR results showed that the Mn-O-Mn cluster vibrational mode at 606 cm(-1) in the S(2)Q(A)(-)/S(1)Q(A) spectrum of the NaCl control PSII sample was diminished in those samples treated with NH4Cl. Our results suggest that NH3 induced a significant alteration on the core structure of the Mn4CaO5 cluster in PSII. The implication of our findings on the structure of the NH3-binding site on the OEC in PSII will be discussed.									40	0	1	0	30	0	41			0006-2960			WOS:000296217000008	21942297

Morphology Evolution of One-Dimensional-Based ZnO Nanostructures Synthesized via Electrochemical Corrosion								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				113	35			15514	15523		10.1021/jp9017794				SEP 3 2009	2009	Various morphologies of ZnO nanostructures can be obtained through a novel method, incorporating electrochemical corrosion with three modes: liquid membrane and above and below the water line in partial immersion. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) are employed to characterize their structure. The mechanism of the growth of NRs is proposed as electrochemical corrosion and oriented attachment, which occur in a liquid membrane or partial immersion in a vapor membrane. The evolution of ZnO nanostructures such as nanorods, nanowires, nanopins, and nanodentrites is observed, and the influence of concentration, reaction time, additives, state of substrate, membrane thickness, and solvent on the morphology of ZnO is investigated. Optical properties of ZnO nanostructures are studied by using UV-visible absorption spectra and photoluminescence (PL). Their optical gaps vary from different morphologies. Among the studied samples, short nanorods show the largest optical gap, while big nanorods present the smallest value of optical gap. PL properties demonstrate that peaks of near-band emission and defect-related luminescence are basically in the same position. However, intensities for different morphologies are of different values, and short nanorods exhibit the best near-band emissions.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000269252500008

Although the peroxiredoxins (Prxs) or thioredoxin peroxidases (TPx) enzymes of this parasite have been sequenced and annotated, their biological properties remain largely unknown. Prxs are a family of antioxidant enzymes that protect biological molecules against metabolically produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to water in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In this study, TPx-1 cDNA was cloned from B. microti (designated BmTPx-1). Recombinant BmTPx-1 (rBmTPx-1) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a histidine fusion protein and purified using Ni-NTA His bind resin. To test the defense capacity of enzymatic antioxidants against the effect of ROS, a mixed-function oxidation system was utilized with the recombinant BmTPx-1 protein. A decreased ability of rBmTPx-1 to donate electrons to the thioredoxin (Trx)/TrxR reductase system was clarified by reaction with H2O2. These results suggest that BmTPx-1 has a great impact on protecting parasites from oxidative stress in the erythrocytic stage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The two-dimensional lattice of this adlayer can be described by a c(3 x 2) unit cell. The bromide anions are arranged parallel to the close packed copper rows and are located in three different types of adsorption sites. These inequivalently bound bromide species are imaged with different brightness in the STM-pictures. As a result the bromide adlayer exhibits a long-ranged wavy superstructure superimposed on the atomic corrugation.Tip induced copper corrosion is used to obtain highly ordered nanostructures due to a locally confined electrochemical annealing process proceeding along the [001]-direction of the substrate. This annealing process results in the formation of Cu(100)-facets. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Exoplanet atmospheres are thought be built up from accretion of gas as well as pebbles and planetesimals in the midplanes of planet-forming disks. The chemical composition of this material is usually assumed to be unchanged during the disk lifetime. However, chemistry can alter the relative abundances of molecules in this planet-building material.Aims. We aim to assess the impact of disk chemistry during the era of planet formation. This is done by investigating the chemical changes to volatile gases and ices in a protoplanetary disk midplane out to 30 AU for up to 7 Myr, considering a variety of different conditions, including a physical midplane structure that is evolving in time, and also considering two disks with different masses.Methods. An extensive kinetic chemistry gas-grain reaction network was utilised to evolve the abundances of chemical species over time. Two disk midplane ionisation levels (low and high) were explored, as well as two different makeups of the initial abundances ("inheritance" or "reset").Results. Given a high level of ionisation, chemical evolution in protoplanetary disk midplanes becomes significant after a few times 10(5) yr, and is still ongoing by 7 Myr between the H2O and the O-2 icelines. Inside the H2O iceline, and in the outer, colder regions of the disk midplane outside the O-2 iceline, the relative abundances of the species reach (close to) steady state by 7 Myr. Importantly, the changes in the abundances of the major elemental carbon and oxygen-bearing molecules imply that the traditional "stepfunction" for the C/O ratios in gas and ice in the disk midplane (as defined by sharp changes at icelines of H2O, CO2 and CO) evolves over time, and cannot be assumed fixed, with the C/O ratio in the gas even becoming smaller than the C/O ratio in the ice. In addition, at lower temperatures (< 29 K), gaseous CO colliding with the grains gets converted into CO2 and other more complex ices, lowering the CO gas abundance between the O-2 and CO thermal icelines. This effect can mimic a CO iceline at a higher temperature than suggested by its binding energy.Conclusions. Chemistry in the disk midplane is ionisation-driven, and evolves over time. This affects which molecules go into forming planets and their atmospheres. In order to reliably predict the atmospheric compositions of forming planets, as well as to relate observed atmospheric C/O ratios of exoplanets to where and how the atmospheres have formed in a disk midplane, chemical evolution needs to be considered and implemented into planet formation models.									73	0	0	0	0	0	73			1432-0746			WOS:000432980700001

The adsorption isothermal of the complex on the TiO2 surface was analyzed by the Langmuir adsorption model to provide a maximum coverage of Gamma(max) = 4.4 x 10(-8) mol cm(-2) and an adsorption equilibrium constant of K-ads = 1.1 x 10(4) M-1, suggesting that the monolayer of the complex is formed on the TiO2 surface. The cyclic voltammetry measurement of the complex on the TiO2 surface sug-gested the diffusion-controlled charge transport via electron hopping between the complexes through the TiO2 layer. Pourbaix diagram showed that the complex undergoes a non-H+-coupled leredox reaction of a (RuOH)-O-II/ (RuOH)-O-III pair of the complex on the TiO2 electrode due to pH buffering ability of the TiO2 surface in a range of pH 5 -11. Bulk electrolysis at 1.7 V vs Ag/AgCl using the complex-anchoring TiO2 electrode provided a high and steady catalytic current density of 0.39 mA cm(-2) with 83 Faradaic efficiency for O-2 evolution during 1 h electrolysis. However, we presume that the complex is transformed to RuO, nanoparticles on the TiO2 electrode during the electrocatalysis, on the basis of our earlier report on the complex / mesoporous ITO electrode system (Dalton Trans., 2020, 49, 1416 - 1423.).

The Pd-based electrode had an Ir:Sn molar ratio of 1:1 and contained 10% tantalum on a titanium substrate. The palladium weight ratio varied from 0 g to 1.8 g, 4.7 g, 8.6 g, and 15.4 g. Electrolytic refining was investigated for the Pd-based electrode in 3 M of H2SO4. The interfacial microstructure and components of the substrate were investigated using energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, and the electrochemical properties of the materials were measured using cyclic voltammetry, linear scan voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and accelerated life tests. Of all the tested Pd-based electrodes, those with a palladium loading weight of 8.6 g showed the highest and most stable electrode activity at 3 M of H2SO4, with a capacitance retention of 96% of its initial value. The accelerated life test results for the 8.6 g Pd-Ir-Sn-Ta/TiO2 electrode showed a gradual slope with an efficiency of almost 100% at 1000 h in an aqueous solution of 3 M of H2SO4. After the test, the dissolved elements that caused resistance in the electrolyte increased with increasing palladium loading content. Thus, the 8.6 g Pd-Ir-Sn-Ta/TiO2 electrode demonstrated the optimum composition in 3 M of H2SO4 for electrolyte refining.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				1996-1073		WOS:000455358300117

The alterations show no evidence for any major deformation and are located along low-angle structures that were formed in a late stage of the structural evolution of the ophiolite complex. Modeling of mineral equilibria in the SiO2-MgO-FeO-Fe2O3-CaO-H2O +/- CO2 system has been utilized to constrain the conditions during serpentinization and carbonation.The partly altered peridotites consist of the mineral assemblage olivine-dinopyroxene-serpentine-magnetite-brucite and formed at temperatures <410 degrees C by infiltration of aqueous fluids. Completely serpentinized rocks with the mineral assemblage serpentine-magnesite-magnetite-dolomite formed at temperatures <500 degrees C and low X-CO2 (<= 0.05) by the breakdown of the minerals in the partly altered peridotites. Talc-carbonate rocks formed by the breakdown of the serpentine in the previously formed serpentinite rock at temperatures <550 degrees C and elevated X-CO2, which resulted in the stabilization of the assemblage talc-magnesite-magnetite-dolomite. Carbon isotope values determined for dolomite from crosscutting carbonate lenses within the talc-carbonate rock yield delta C-13 values of similar to-5 indicative of a mantle source for the carbon required for the carbonation. Oxygen isotope values delta O-18(SMOW) of similar to 10.8-11.3 parts per thousand together with initial Sr-87/Sr-86(i = 400Ma) values of 0.7029 and 0.7063, suggest dehydration of rocks with mantle affinity as a source for the fluids. Based on analytical results and field observations we propose that the formation of the talc- and carbonate-bearing alteration zones is caused by the focused infiltration of fluids that originated at the bottom of already partly serpentinized ophiolite complex during extension-driven burial at the late stage of the Caledonian orogeny.

The discrete voltammetry and mass curves obtained simultaneously made it possible to compute the effective equivalent molar mass (EMM) of the reaction species (the ratio of effective molecular weight of the species to the number of electrons exchanged) as a function of the potential applied.It is found that a cathodic mass increase of gold electrode in blank 0.1M Na2SO4 solutions can be accounted for hydrogen evolution and the apparent quartz sensor response due to the change of the electrode-solution mechanical coupling. This effect completely disappears in the presence of a cationic surfactant as BDDB which increases the hydrogen evolution overvoltage. The low concentrations of BDDB as 10(-5) M are found to inhibit anodic oxide formation on gold. At the concentrations higher than 10(-4) M oxidation and reduction processes appear at 1.04 V and 0.69 M nhe respectively. The oxidation is accompanied by intensive electrosorption of organic species which are to a high extent desorbed upon the reduction. Although at higher concentrations, ca. 10% of the adsorbate remains on the surface upon the reduction.The EMM values obtained on the basis of the voltammetric cycles and for BDDB electrosorption at a constant potential give a clue to the analysis of the chemical transformations in the system. The process of electrosorption of dimethylbenzalkonium ion appears to be connected with the adsorption of the Pr anions from the solution and the formation of the anodically adsorbed oxygen layer. The EMM values obtained for the electrosorption in stationary conditions was 260 g/mole. The ir and XPS spectroscopy data indicate that oxidation of BDDB results in a shrinkage of the alkyl chain and formation of amide and quinonic C=O bonds, which conforms with the obtained EMM value, assuming one electron exchange.					6th International Fischer Symposium on Nanotechniques in Electrochemistry6th International Fischer Symposium on Nanotechniques in Electrochemistry	JUN 13-16, 1994JUN 13-16, 1994	Int Soc Electrochem; Deut Forschungsgemeinsch; State Baden Wurttemberg, Germany; Badische Landesbausparkasse; Solartron Instruments; EG & G; HEKA Phys; Zahner Elektrik; Deut Metrohm; LotInt Soc Electrochem; Deut Forschungsgemeinsch; State Baden Wurttemberg, Germany; Badische Landesbausparkasse; Solartron Instruments; EG & G; HEKA Phys; Zahner Elektrik; Deut Metrohm; Lot	UNIV KARLSRUHE, KARLSRUHE, GERMANYUNIV KARLSRUHE, KARLSRUHE, GERMANY	12	0	1	0	0	0	14			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:A1995RF74300037

Low temperature synthesis of tetragonal nickel manganite spinels: thermal behaviour and reactivity								Materials Research Bulletin				29	11			1163	73		10.1016/0025-5408(94)90186-4				Nov. 1994	1994	A route for the low temperature preparation of nickel manganite spinels is described. This method has allowed to obtain, for the first time, tetragonal nickel manganite spinels NixMn3-xO4, in the composition range 0.6lestimesles1.0. This phase has been prepared by heating at 200degC gels obtained by addition of 1M n-butylamine to mixed Ni2+ and Mn2+ solutions. In this paper, we report about the results obtained from X-ray studies, of the thermal evolution and reactivity for the tetragonal spinel with x=0.8, between 200deg to 1000degC. The formation of a metastable gamma-cation deficient cubic spinel is attained at 300degC; it decomposes at ap500degC, giving at 600degC a mixture of NiMnO3 and alpha-Mn2O3. Above 800degC, the reaction between these two phases leads to the formation of the high temperature cubic spinel, in which (Mn4+/Mn3+Bap1.0. Cell lattice and oxygen positional parameters have been determined from Rietveld refinements. From these data, ionic configuration and cation distribution formulae for cubic spinels have been derived. These results can account for the mechanism of transformations that takes place during the thermal treatments.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0025-5408			INSPEC:4832480

Elemental sulphur abundances were derived for six targets, and upper limits were set for two of the most metal-poor stars in the sample. The sulphur doublet at 8694.62 Angstrom has been detected in three stars (HD 19445, HD 2665, and HD 2796) with [Fe/H] less than or equal to -1.9. Our observations, combined with those available in the literature, indicate a monotonic increase of the [S/Fe] ratio as [Fe/H] decreases, reaching values of [S/Fe] similar to 0.7-0.8 below [Fe/H] = -2. We discuss plausible scenarios for the interpretation of these results.									47	0	0	0	0	0	47			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000170558200011

Some of them are minutely required for normal plant growth and development, while others have unknown biological actions. They may cause injury when they are applied in an elevated concentration, regardless of the importance for the plant functioning. On the other hand, their application may help to alleviate various abiotic stresses. In this review, both the deleterious and beneficial effects of metallic trace elements from their uptake by roots and leaves, through toxicity, up to the regulation of physiological and molecular mechanisms that are associated with plant protection against stress conditions have been briefly discussed. We have highlighted the involvement of metallic ions in mitigating oxidative stress by the activation of various antioxidant enzymes and emphasized the phenomenon of low-dose stimulation that is caused by non-essential, potentially poisonous elements called hormesis, which is recently one of the most studied issues. Finally, we have described the evolutionary consequences of long-term exposure to metallic elements, resulting in the development of unique assemblages of vegetation, classified as metallophytes, which constitute excellent model systems for research on metal accumulation and tolerance. Taken together, the paper can provide a novel insight into the toxicity concept, since both dose- and genotype-dependent response to the presence of metallic trace elements has been comprehensively explained.									45	0	1	0	35	0	46				1422-0067		WOS:000477041100005	31247908

Apart from the well-known graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), other types of 2D CxNy nanocrystals including C2N, C3N and C5N2 are also successfully fabricated in recent years and their properties and potential uses in various fields have been widely investigated. Meanwhile, g-CN, C2N2, C2N3 and C5N have been theoretically predicted, and their properties and potential applications have also been researched. Until now, 2D crystalline CxNy compounds have demonstrated promising applications in photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, gas adsorption/separation, and energy storage devices, from both experimental and theoretical aspects, stemming from their unique geometric structures, tunable electronic properties, and high specific surface area. Herein, recent advances in the synthesis of 2D CxNy nanocrystals and their applications in various fields are summarized. Moreover, future challenges and opportunities for developing 2D CxNy nanocrystals for more broad applications including environmental remediation are also discussed.									39	0	0	0	6	0	39			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000607307900047

A Cabernet Sauvignon wine treated with different levels of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and glutathione (GSH) was microoxygenated, bottled with equivalent free SO2 levels, and stored under controlled conditions for 28 months. After bottle aging, the MOx-treated wines, particularly those treated with relatively low levels of SO2 and GSH during MOx, showed much more acetaldehyde and stable polymeric pigments and very stable color compared to wines without MOx treatment. MOx-treated wines also lost more SO2 during aging. Higher SO2 during treatments with or without MOx resulted in more protein-reactive tannins after aging, suggesting implications for wine mouthfeel. The addition of SO2 and, to a lesser extent, GSH before MOx, was associated with slowed wine oxidation reactions during aging and reduced color stability, leading to greater color loss. These results show that MOx prior to bottling has a dramatic effect on the evolution of wine during aging. The MOx-treated wines had a more stable color, but they also lost SO2 protection more quickly, and thus may need more SO2 before bottling to ensure comparable stability during aging. These results suggest that MOx treatment removes some preservative factors in new wine, possibly phenolics that act as stabilizers.									9	0	0	0	8	1	9			0002-9254	1943-7749		WOS:000473321000011

Existing kinetics models tend to deviate from experimental measurements of late char burnout due to the incomplete treatment of ash effects. Ash can improve pore evolution through vaporization, hinder oxygen transport by forming an ash film, and reduce active carbon sites and available surface per unit volume by penetrating into the char matrix. In this work, a sophisticated kinetics model, focusing on these three ash evolution mechanisms (ash vaporization, ash film, and ash dilution) during pulverized coal (PC) char combustion, is developed by integrating them into a thorough mechanistic picture. Further, a detailed comparison of the three distinct ash effects on PC char conversion during air (O-2/N-2) and oxy-fuel (O-2/CO2) combustion is performed. For the modeled coal, the mass of ash vaporization is approximate 3 orders less than the mass of ash remaining, which participates in ash dilution and ash film formation, both in O-2/N-2 and O-2/CO2 atmospheres. The influence of these phenomena on burnout time follows the order: ash dilution > ash film > ash vaporization. The influence of ash vaporization on burnout time is minor, but through interactions with the ash dilution and ash film forming processes it can have an impact at high extents of burnout, particularly in O-2/CO2 atmospheres. In O-2/N-2 atmospheres the residual ash predominately exists as an ash film, whereas it mainly exists as diluted ash in the char matrix in O-2/CO2 atmospheres. The residual ash particle is encased by a thick film when the ash film forming fraction is high (low ash dilution fraction). These results provide in-depth insights into the conversion of PC char and further utilization of the residual ash. (C) 2018 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The directionality imposed by the organic backbone for each of these "Pacman" complexes elicits idealized M center dot center dot center dot M distances of ca. 5, 10, and 12 angstrom for 4-6, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry indicates that intramolecular electronic communication occurs between the metal sites of 4, while the metal fragments are essentially electrochemically isolated for 5 and 6. Despite the disparate distances between the metal sites, each of these complexes are shown to mediate the Ce(IV)-driven oxidation of water in acidic media. Dioxygen evolution was monitored with an optical probe in the headspace of the reaction vessel, and independently verified by the detection of appropriate ratios of (18)O-(18)O, (18)O-(16)O, and (18)O-(16)O in GC-MS experiments using (18)O-labeled water. A fitting of the dioxygen evolution data indicates catalytic behavior that is first-order with respect to catalyst concentration in all cases. This finding rules out the possibility that dioxygen formation occurs independently at each metal site simultaneously, and leaves open the possibility that O-O bond formation occurs by either both metal sites acting cooperatively, or at one metal site independent of the other. Taking into account the significant electrostatic repulsion between the two metal fragments in higher oxidation levels, we contend that the latter mechanism is the more likely scenario. Notwithstanding, complex 4 generates the largest k(obs) values among the bimetallic series, which suggests that the close proximity of another metal may benefit catalysis. A comparison of k(obs) and catalytic turnover numbers (TONs) of the bimetallic systems to the mononuclear complex 2, however, does not indicate an improvement in catalytic behavior. This is an important observation in the collective pursuit of efficient water oxidation catalysts.									35	2	0	0	3	0	37			1434-1948			WOS:000280428600008

Some conclusions have been reached :① delta~(18)O and deltaD values of water show balance with A-type veins (+ 6.0~ + 11.2,-90~ -101),quartz in phyllite (A1), Qtz-kfs veins (A3), B-type veins, straight quartz veins (B1), and Qtz-Moly-Py Anhy Cpy veins (B2), suggesting that all the ore-forming fluids were derived from magma ; ② delta~(18)O and deltaD values of water show balance with the B1-type veins (+ 6.6 and - 101),implying that fluids inducing propylitic alteration were dominated by the fluid separated from magmatic vapor during exsolution with low density, low salinity and high temperature;③ Considerable variations of delta~(18)O in Qtz -Py-Cpy veins (B3) (+4.1~+ 6.0) suggest that minor amounts of meteoric water and regional metamor-phic water were partially involved in the magmatic water during transforming of K-silicate alteration to feldspar-destructive alteration;④ During the formation of D-type veins, meteoric water and underground water were infused into the ore-forming fluid-system and mixed with magmatic water (delta~(18)O: + 2.8~ +4.9). Feldspar-destructive alteration which overprinted most of the potassic alteration and part of the propylitic alteration was triggered by the reaction of mixed water with porphyries and phyllite. It is thus held that K-silicate alteration and propylitic alteration accompanying with A-type veins and early B-type veins were caused by the action of magmatic fluid. Meteoric water began being infused into the alteration-mineralization system from the transformation period. However, feldspar-destructive alteration was triggered by the mixed fluid of magmatic water and meteoric water.			为查明朱砂红矿床成矿流体来源及矿床蚀变-矿化流体演化过程,在已厘定的朱砂红矿床脉体类型基础之上,选取了不同蚀变阶段的蚀变矿物,进行了系统的H-O同位素测试。研究发现:早期A脉[无矿团块状石英脉(Al 脉)、石英-钾长石脉(A3脉)]石英中包裹体delta~(18)O值介于+ 6.0 ~ +11.2,deltaD值介于-90~ -101之间,在delta~(18)〇-deltaD图解中,A脉样品的H-O值组成整体位于去气作用后的残余岩浆水范围,表明引起早期钾硅酸盐化的流体性质为一套高温、高盐度岩浆热液;绿帘石-石英脉(B1脉)的delta~(18)O值和deltaD值(+6.6和-101)显示青磐岩化蚀变形成与高温岩浆流体相分离后的低密度气相流体有关;而斑岩中的石英-黄铁矿-黄铜矿(B3脉)形成时,流体delta~(18)O 值(+4.1~+6.0)开始朝雨水线方向发生轻微的氧漂移,表明开始有少量大气降水的加入;晚期D脉形成时的成矿流体delta~(18)O值(+2.8~+4.9)具有明显朝雨水线发生漂移的趋势,表明引起石英-绢云母化及泥化蚀变的成矿热液为岩浆热液和大气降水的混合流体。总之,朱砂红矿床钾硅酸盐化、青磐岩化蚀变,以及该蚀变阶段形成的A脉和早期B脉,均由岩浆热液作用引起,大气降水在钾硅酸盐化向长石分解蚀变转变的阶段开始进入蚀变-矿化系统,而长石分解蚀变为大气降水与岩浆热液共同作用的产物。						0	0	0		0	0	0			1000-6524			CSCD:5475349

We show here that the most sophisticated available hydrodynamic simulations (in spherical and axial symmetry) do not support this new r-process scenario because they fail to provide the necessary conditions of temperature, entropy, and expansion timescale by significant factors. This suggests that, either the formation of r- process elements works differently than suggested by Ning et al. (ApJ, 667, L159, NQM07), or that some essential core properties with influence on the explosion dynamics might be different from those predicted by Nomoto's progenitor model.									82	1	0	0	0	0	83			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000256690600021

The surface morphology and true composition of the oxide layers were investigated using SEM and EDS techniques, respectively. The electrochemical characterisation study was carried out in electrolyte-free water using a filter-press cell in the zero-gap configuration with Nafion (R) 117 membrane as the SPE. SEM images revealed that the mixed oxide coatings exhibited a compact surface morphology. A very good adhesion of the oxide layers to the stainless-steel fine-mesh support was achieved after the polishing of the latter using emery paper. EDS data revealed that the Co: Ni ratios were in agreement with the nominal compositions obtained from the precursor salt solutions. The cyclic voltammetry study revealed that a reversible pseudo-capacitive behaviour can be attributed to the solid-state surface redox transitions occurring at the three-phase interfacial regions in an acidic environment. Polarisation curves obtained for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrolyte-free water revealed the overpotential is strongly affected by the Co percentage, the highest overpotentials being observed for the electrodes containing 0, 10 and 70 mol% Co. The stability tests carried out in electrolyte-free water during the OER (j = 400 mA cm(-2) and T = 24 degrees C) revealed that the Ni(x)Co(1-x)O-y mixed oxide electrodes are more stable than the pure oxides (e. g., NiO and Co3O4). The use of an SPE resulted in good stabilisation of the Co + Ni mixed oxide electrodes during electrolysis of the electrolyte-free water. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Liu, Dongdong; Hao, Zhengkai; Zhao, Xiaoman; Su, Rui; Feng, Weizhi; Li, Song; Jia, Boyin								Effect of Physical and Mechanical Activation on the Physicochemical Structure of Coal-Based Activated Carbons for SO2 Adsorption								PROCESSES				7	10					707	10.3390/pr7100707				OCT 2019	2019	The SO2 adsorption efficiency of activated carbons (ACs) is clearly dependent on its physicochemical structure. Related to this, the effect of physical and mechanical activation on the physicochemical structure of coal-based ACs has been investigated in this work. In the stage of CO2 activation, the rapid decrease of the defective structure and the growth of aromatic layers accompanied by the dehydrogenation of aromatic rings result in the ordered conversion of the microstructure and severe carbon losses on the surfaces of Char-PA, while the oxygen content of Char-PA, including C=O (39.6%), C-O (27.3%), O-C=O (18.4%) and chemisorbed O (or H2O) (14.7%), is increased to 4.03%. Char-PA presents a relatively low S-BET value (414.78 m(2)/g) owing to the high value of Non-V-mic (58.33%). In the subsequent mechanical activation from 12 to 48 h under N-2 and dry ice, the strong mechanical collision caused by ball-milling can destroy the closely arranged crystalline layers and the collapse of mesopores and macropores, resulting in the disordered conversion of the microstructure and the formation of a defective structure, and a sustained increase in the S-BET value from 715.89 to 1259.74 m(2)/g can be found with the prolonging of the ball-milling time. There is a gradual increase in the oxygen content from 6.79 to 9.48% for Char-PA-CO2-12/48 obtained by ball-milling under CO2. Remarkably, the varieties of physicochemical parameters of Char-PA-CO2-12/48 are more obvious than those of Char-PA-N-2-12/48 under the same ball-milling time, which is related to the stronger solid-gas reactions caused by the mechanical collision under dry ice. Finally, the results of the SO2 adsorption test of typical samples indicate that Char-PA-CO2-48 with a desirable physicochemical structure can maintain 100% efficiency within 30 min and that its SO2 adsorption capacity can reach 138.5 mg/g at the end of the experiment. After the 10th cycle of thermal regeneration, Char-PA-CO2-48 still has a strong adsorptive capacity (81.2 mg/g).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2227-9717		WOS:000495436200069		
J	Vijayan, T.; Patil, Jagadish G.								A model of the generation and transport of ozone in high-tension nozzle driven corona inside a novel diode								REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS				83	12					123304	10.1063/1.4770130				DEC 2012	2012	The genesis and transport of ozone (O-3) are investigated in a novel plasma diode and described in this paper. The innovative cathode (K) of this axial symmetric diode which operated at the high voltage (phi(0)), has a large number of sharpened nozzles located on different radial planes of its central tubular-mast and is encircled by the anode (A). The nozzles played the dual role of oxygen (O-2) injection as well as creation of high electric field (E) in the A-K gap, enabled the formation of a cold corona. Electrons in the corona under the influence of E moved towards anode, collided with O-2 and created the O radicals. O in turn joined the free O-2 and formed O-3. The evolution of O-3 here is modeled in various O-2 pressure (P), electron density (ne), and temperature (T) in terms of the major reaction modes involving e, O, O-2, and O-3. Typical steady state O-3 density attained so in P similar to bar, n(e) similar to 10(15) m(-3) and T similar to 300 K is over 10(25) m(-3) and that of O lower similar to 10(20) m(-3). Both the O and O-3 densities increased with an enhanced ne of avalanche multiplications in corona. O-3 increased also with a higher P but the temporal O reversed in trend midway and reduced with P towards the steady state. A sharp decline in diode resistance with smaller A-K gap induced finite discharge current and led to the undesired heating of corona. It is shown that the O-3 density reduced with the temperature rise but O density reduced with the T rise up to 500 K and then rose modestly with the further T increase.

Compared to conventional pulverized coal combustion, influences of gasification in oxy-fuel combustion is more complicated, especially in wet recycle system. Meanwhile, gasification has a significant impact on char structure, which can directly affect the combustion characteristic of char. The evolution of coal char structure under the oxy-fuel combustion containing high H2O was investigated. Char samples were prepared in CO2/H2O atmosphere using a drop-tube furnace (DTF), N-2, CO2 and N-2/H2O atmosphere as the control group. Carbon content, surface morphology, pore structure, carbon structure and characteristics temperature of the coal char were analyzed. Experimental results show that carbon burnout rate increases with the content of volatile matter increase. Char particles from a containing -H2O atmosphere formed around less fine particles than the char particles under no-H2O atmosphere, because fine coal particles in the atmosphere containing-H2O are easy reacted and taken away from the airflow. The remarkable reduction of char pores under an atmosphere containing CO2 or H2O caused by carbon consumption during gasification reaction, which can not only produce a more porous structure but also diminish the proportion of large pores. Amorphous carbon in coal could be quickly reacted in a containing-H2O atmosphere. Atmosphere containing H2O dramatically reduces char characteristics temperature at 21% O-2 concentrations. In conclusion, char combustion reactivity affected by carbon reactivity largely than the specific surface area in oxy-fuel atmosphere containing high H2O. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, Li vacancy defects are purposely created in a series of one-dimensional (1D) porous multi-shell Li(NixCoyMnz)O-2 hollow fibers by a facile electrochemical lithium ion (Li+) intercalation and extraction. The total Li vacancy concentrations are 0.52, 0.49, and 0.53 in one unit of delithiated Li(NixCoyMnz)O-2 hollow fibers (De-Li(NixCoyMnz)O-2) for De-Li( Ni0.20Co0.60Mn0.20)O-2, De-Li(Ni0.33Co0.33Mn0.33)O-2, De-Li(Ni0.65Co0.25Mn0.10)O-2, respectively. When evaluated as oxygen electrocatalysts, the De-Li(Ni0.2Co0.6Mn0.2)O-2 shows the best performance with onset potential of similar to 1.46 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) outperforming IrO2/C at 1 M KOH in OER and much improved onset potential of similar to 0.85 V vs. RHE than that of Li(Ni0.2Co0.6Mn0.2)O-2 (similar to 0.71 V vs. RHE) at 0.1 M KOH in ORR. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the sample before and after delithiation certified that the delithiated samples have a significantly improved carrier concentration and electronic conductivity in the Co-d orbitals near the sites of Li vacancies. This results in enhanced H2O (3.34 eV) and O-2 (2.75 eV) adsorption energies and thus greatly reduces the OER-ORR potential difference (Delta E) (0.17 V). A ZAB with the De-Li(Ni0.2Co0.6Mn0.2)O-2 as the air cathode was also assembled, which shows high efficiency and long-term stability. At a constant current rate of 5 mA cm(-2), the final charge and discharge potential is similar to 1.97 V and similar to 1.23 V after 441 h.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2405-8297			WOS:000449521500021

The as-prepared PtxCu1-x nanoarchitectures are confirmed as consisting of the integration of initial small alloy nanoparticles (NPs), resulting in an interconnected nanoporous structure. The electrochemical experiments indicate that these PtxCu1-x nanocatalysts exhibit atomic composition dependent catalytic activity, although the surfaces of all the catalysts were characterized to be featured with a Pt enrichment structure. With optimal atomic composition, the Pt35Cu65 catalyst possesses enhanced electro-catalytic activities towards methanol oxidation in comparison with other PtxCu1-x samples and pure Pt catalyst with similar morphology. Furthermore, the integrated Pt35Cu65 nanoarchitecture displays good durability during the long term electrochemical scanning through as many as 1500 cycles. The comparable catalytic performance of Pt35Cu65 catalyst could be attributed to the interconnected initial small NPs, formation of open porous structure, durable nanoarchitecture, and synergetic effect of the alloyed atoms. The structural evolution from metastable small alloy NPs to integrated stable nanoarchitectures may provide new opportunities to design and prepare novel composite materials with durable structure and effective catalytic properties.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000350890700016	25764571

Short-term measures of metabolic responses to warmer environments are expected to indicate the sensitivity of species to regional warming. However, given time, species may be able to acclimate to increasing temperature. Thus, it is useful to determine if short-term responses provide a good predictor for long-term acclimation ability. 2. The tropical reef fish Acanthochromis polyacanthus was used to test whether the ability for developmental thermal acclimation of two populations was indicated by their short-term metabolic response to temperature. 3. While both populations exhibited similar short-term responses of resting metabolic rate (RMR) to temperature, fish from the higher-latitude population were able to fully acclimate RMR, while the lower-latitude population could only partially compensate RMR at the warmest temperature. These differences in acclimation ability are most likely due to genetic differences between the populations rather than differences in thermal regimes. 4. This research indicates that acclimation ability may vary greatly between populations and that understanding such variation will be critical for predicting the impacts of warming environmental temperatures. Moreover, the thermal metabolic reaction norm does not appear to be a good predictor of long-term acclimation ability.									49	0	0	0	47	0	49			0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000307343100022	22433064

However, like most metals, this material is not immune to corrosion, being necessary to be protected against corrosion. One of the methods most commonly employed to improve the corrosion resistance of Al alloys is the anodizing process, which consists of thickening of the natural oxide (Al2O3) presents in Al through anodic oxidation. The anodizing process is accomplished by immersion of the Al alloy into an acid bath and passing an electric current through it. This process produces two layers: a barrier layer thicker than the natural oxide and a layer with regular arrangement of nanopores (porous layer). This duplex structure forms the anodized layer with a large specific surface area. With the advent of nanotechnology, this layer has been applied in other areas due to its low cost, stability, absence of toxicity, and biocompatibility. In this context, this paper addresses a historical and electrochemical review of the anodizing process of Al and its alloys, presenting the main events that culminated in the development of the current processes and the understanding of the relationship between the chemical reactions and the mechanisms that occur during nucleation and development of the oxide layer.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0100-4042	1678-7064		WOS:000703836700008

Atomic mobilities including bulk and short-circuit diffusion of Mg and O were then obtained by means of the CALPHAD (Calculation of Phase Diagram) approach. Afterwards, the diffusion-controlled kinetic model of oxidation in a gas-MgO-Mg environment was developed based on the moving boundary model and Fick's law, coupling with the modified thermodynamic description of MgO. A mathematical expression for parabolic rate constant k(p) of the oxide scale was derived for magnesia and correlated with the thermodynamic and diffusion kinetic information. The evaluated k(p) results were in line with the experimental data. Finally, the oxidation process of pure magnesium at 673 K was model-predicted, and the predicted evolution of the oxide thicknesses agreed very well with the experimental data. It was indicated that the grain boundaries diffusion of magnesium cations predominated the high temperature oxidation process.

J	BEITINGER, TL								BEHAVIORAL REACTIONS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF STRESS IN FISHES								JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH				16	4			495	528		10.1016/S0380-1330(90)71443-8				1990	1990	Behavioral reactions of fishes are measureable, adaptive features which contribute to their evolutionary fitness and, hence, can serve as biomarkers of stress. For a behavior to serve as an efficacious biomarker, it should be important to an individual's survival, growth and/or reproduction, be relatively stable under control conditions, and have a "concentration-effect" relationship with the stressor. This review summarizes the influence of numerous environmental stimuli on seven different behaviors in fishes. Avoidance-attractance behavior does not assess for stress, but rather allows a fish to avoia stressful chemicals. Of the 75 chemicals surveyed, about 1/3 are avoided at threshold concentrations that should mitigate harm, while approximately 2/3 were either not actively avoided or produced inconsistent results. Temperature selection behavior meets several criteria of a good indicator of stress. Several stimuli produced significant changes in selected/avoidance temperatures of various fishes. While only a few stimuli caused an increase, several resulted in a decrease in selected temperatures. Although conditioned learning appears to be a sensitive measure of environmentally induced stress, few studies have been published, and direct field validations are not possible. A variety of stimuli can disrupt the components of feeding, often in the parts per billion range of concentrations. Predator-prey interactions are sensitive to a variety of stressors. In trials where only prey were exposed to a potential stressor, 94% of the stressors caused an increase in prey vulnerability, usually at levels less than 96-hour LC50S. Neither of the other social behaviors reviewed, intraspecific and reproductive, although promising, has received large research attention. Studies featuring several different methods demonstrate that there is no single best behavioral bioassay method. However, depending upon the expected effects and possible mode of action, there probably is a "best" behavioral bioassay to illustrate the effects of each potential stressor.									130	0	0	0	122	0	131			0380-1330			WOS:A1990EU23300003

In this study, multiple methods were applied to clarify the pyrolysis behaviors of four kerogens from the Huadian (HD) Basin, Fushun (FS) Basin, Luozigou (LZG) Basin, and Dachanggou (DCG) Basin oil shales. Two model-free isoconversional methods and a master plot were utilized to evaluate the kinetic parameters, and the Coats-Redfern method was used to verify the estimated kinetic results. The results indicated that all studied oil shales had very good hydrocarbon generation potential. HD, FS, and LZG oil shales could be described as type I kerogen, whereas DCG oil shale was type H-1 kerogen with high aromatic content. HD kerogen featured a stronger polarity and contained more aliphatic structures compared with the three other samples, which induced the mass loss of its first stage at similar to 38%, even larger than that of its second pyrolysis stage; the activation energies of the main pyrolysis stage of HD kerogen could also be divided clearly into two stages and in accordance with the thermogravimetric results. The thermal cracking processes of these FS, LZG, and DCG kerogens were mainly concentrated in the second pyrolysis stage, and the activation energies of FS and LZG kerogens did not show a considerable variation with conversion degrees. Moreover, DCG kerogen possessed the largest amount of aromatic structures which resulted in high yields of char, and the activation energies of the main pyrolysis stage of DCG kerogen was almost the largest, especially when the conversation rate was above 0.7. Evolution behaviors of oil and gas products at different temperatures during pyrolysis were related to the cleavage of chemical bonds in kerogen. CH4 and light C2+ aliphatic hydrocarbons were the typical gaseous products released from the main reaction stages of all four kerogens, and the evolving behavior of each typical gaseous product of four kerogens featured good similarity. The results showed that aliphatic and aromatic carbon contents in kerogen had a remarkable effect on its thermal characteristic and kinetic parameters, and the saturated aliphatic bonds and oxygen-containing bonds were easy to crack and had potentially low activation energy of reaction compared with those of aromatic bonds. Results of the master plot and Coats-Redfern methods verified that the Avrami-Erofeev kinetic model was the optimal model for the pyrolysis of the studied kerogens, thereby indicating that the four kerogens evolved under a similar genetic condition.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000526414800033

Different from traditional metal nanocrystals, the synthesis of metal single atoms involves a matrix material that can confine those single atoms and prevent them from aggregation. We report an electrospinning and thermal annealing method to prepare Ni single atoms dispersed and coordinated in a graphene shell, as active centers for CO2 reduction to CO. During the synthesis, N dopants play a critical role in generating graphene vacancies to trap Ni atoms. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and three-dimensional atom probe tomography were employed to identify the single Ni atomic sites in graphene vacancies. Detailed setup of electrochemical CO2 reduction apparatus coupled with an on-line gas chromatography is also demonstrated.

Innovatively, the evolution of chlorine-related species and the formations of various inorganic ions were investigated by electrolytic analysis in order to set up whether the formation and consumption of these byproducts associated with either chemical or electrochemical reactions. The effect of operating parameters such as current density, solution pH, treatment time, and electrolyte concentration has been studied. The formation of Cl-2, chlorite (ClO2-), and chlorate (ClO3-) were detected by adding the known concentration of Cl- ions at different pH and current densities. Concentration trends of active chloro-species indicate that the degradation of 4-CP and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal was formed maximum at pH 6 and j of 225.2 Am-2 in presence of 0.0085 M NaCl. Thus, the 4-CP degradation mainly depends on the radicals and active chlorine formation and a mineralization mechanism was proposed based on intermediates byproducts formation such as catechol, hydroquinone, 1, 4-benzoquinone, and organic acids identify by using the GC-MS and HPLC analysis at the optimum treatment condition. Total organic carbon (TOC) at different pH and current density, mass balance analysis of carbon and inorganic species formation were determined at the optimum treatment conditions of 4-CP.

Several different transmission electron microscopy imaging techniques, electron diffraction and electron energy-loss spectroscopy were used to study the evolution of the microstructure and the local chemical composition of the particles during oxidation. Our results suggest that built-in field effects control the initial stages of oxidation, with randomly oriented NiO crystallites and internal voids then forming as a result of outward diffusion of Ni2+ along NiO grain boundaries, self-diffusion of Ni2+ ions and vacancies, growth of NiO grains and nucleation of voids at Ni/NiO interfaces. We also observed the formation of transverse cracks in a growing NiO film in situ in the electron microscope. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study reveals that H+ transport and photosynthesis patterns in these excitable cells are affected not only by light conditions but also by electric excitation of the plasma membrane. It is shown that generation of action potential (AP) temporally eliminates alkaline bands, suppresses O-2 evolution, and differentially affects primary reactions of photosystem II (PSII) in different cell regions. The quantum yield of PSII electron transport decreased after AP in the alkaline but not in acidic cell regions. The effects of electric excitation on fluorescence and the PSII electron flow were most pronounced at light-limiting conditions. Evidence was obtained that the shift in chlorophyll fluorescence after AT is due to the increase in Delta pH at thylakoid membranes. It is concluded that the AP-triggered pathways affecting ion transport and photosynthetic energy conversion are linked but not identical. (c) 0 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	BOVET, JM; PARK, EJ; SHARP, RR								NMR PARAMAGNETIC RELAXATION ENHANCEMENTS DUE TO MANGANESE IN THE S-0 AND S-2 STATES OF PHOTOSYSTEM II-ENRICHED MEMBRANE-FRAGMENTS AND IN THE DETERGENT-SOLUBILIZED PHOTOSYSTEM-II COMPLEX								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				38	3			347	354		10.1007/BF00046760				DEC 1993	1993	The NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (NMR-PRE) produced in the solvent proton resonance by manganese in the S-0 and S-2 states of the oxygen evolving center (OEC) has been recorded for three Photosystem II (PS II)-enriched preparations: (1) PS II-enriched thylakoid membrane fragments (TMF-2 particles); (2) salt-washed (2M NaCl) TMF-2 particles; and (3) the octylglucopyranoside (OGP)-solubilized PS II complex. The second and third preparations, but not the first, are depleted of the peripheral 17 and 23 kD polypeptides associated with the OEC. It has been proposed that depletion of these polypeptides increases the exposure of OEC manganese to the aqueous phase. The NMR-PRE response measures the quantity (T-1m+tau(m))(-1), where T-1m is the spin relaxation time and tau(m) is the mean residence time with respect to chemical exchange reactions of solvent protons in the manganese coordination sphere, and, thus, the NMR-PRE provides a direct measure of the solvent proton chemical exchange rate constant tau(m)(-1) This study tested whether the 17 and 23 kD polypeptides shield the OEC from the solvent phase and whether their depletion enhances the S-2 and S-0 NMR-PRE signals by removing a kinetic barrier to the solvent proton chemical exchange reaction. The amplitude of the S-2 NMR-PRE signal, measured in its chemical exchange-limited regime (tau(m)>T-1m), is slightly decreased, rather than increased, in preparations (2) and (3) relative to (1), indicating that removal of the 17 and 23 kD polypeptides slightly slows, rather than accelerates, the rate-limiting steps of the solvent proton chemical exchange reactions. In addition, the lifetime of the S-2 state was shortened several-fold in the solubilized PS II complex and in salt-washed TMF-2 membranes relative to untreated TMF-2 control samples. The S-0 NMR-PRE signal, which is present in TMF-2 suspensions, was not detected in suspensions of the solubilized PS II complex, even though these samples contained high concentrations of active manganese centers (approximately double those of the TMF-2 control) and exhibited an S-2 NMR-PRE signal of comparable amplitude to that of the TMF-2 preparation. These results suggest that the 17 and 23 kD extrinsic polypeptides do not shield the NMR-visible water binding site in the OEC from the aqueous phase, although their removal substantially alters the proton relaxation efficiency by shortening T-1m.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0166-8595			WOS:A1993MX41700015	24317989

Conventionally, isotope effects derive from differences of isotopically substituted molecules in isotope vibrational energy, bond strength, velocity, gravity, and evaporation/condensation. The variations in isotope ratio, such as O-18/O-16 (delta O-18) and O-17/O-16 (delta O-17) are dependent upon mass differences with delta O-17/delta O-18=0.5, due to the relative mass differences (1amu vs. 2amu). Relations that do not follow this are termed mass independent and are the focus of this Minireview. In chemical reactions such as ozone formation, a delta O-17/delta O-18=1 is observed. Physical chemical models capture most parameters but differ in basic approach and are reviewed. The mass independent effect is observed in atmospheric species and used to track their chemistry at the modern and ancient Earth, Mars, and the early solar system (meteorites).									16	2	0	0	3	0	17			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000476423300003	30633432

A closer look to the steadily increasing data from the deeper crystalline basement reveals nevertheless that points left of the MWL are not so unusual as has been suggested during the last decades. Their supposed rareness seems to be due to a bias of sampling: The concerned fluids develop only at greater depths and in low permeability environments, which makes access to them so difficult. Paradoxically, "exotic" stable isotope compositions may be the rule in a restricted depth zone in all crystalline basements with slow groundwater movements but not too high temperatures.The present study takes stable isotope data on saline fluids from the deep French granitic basement as a starting point. In order to situate the French data from the Vienne region in a more general context, a literature review has been undertaken assembling more than 1300 stable isotope analyses of waters and brines in crystalline rocks from stable cratons and mountain belts world-wide. The French fluids show some particular features with respect to the majority of other studies as their major ion composition close to seawater or a significant isotopic shift at relatively low salinities. Detailed knowledge on the hydrological and chemical history of the site allowed to develop a conceptual model of isotopic evolution by interaction of fracture fluids with fracture minerals. This model considers interactions of the last fluids flushing the system (marine water, unaltered, evaporated or diluted) with previously precipitated mineral phases and the neoformation of the last generation of fracture minerals. The model has been tested quantitatively for several combinations of dissolution-precipitation reactions involving formation of carbonates, clay minerals and Fe-hydroxides. Most of the modelled scenarios would leave the residual liquid phase depleted in O-18 and either enriched or depleted in H-2 and produce waters with isotopic signatures corresponding to the observed delta(2)H vs. delta(18)O correlation. It is therefore suggested that the general phenomenon of an isotopic shift in deep fissured silicate rocks, which seems to be rather independent of lithology, may result from a combination of different reaction mechanisms implying not solely the rock matrix but also the different generations of fracture minerals.

However, the photocatalytic properties have not been explored yet for these compounds. Using the first-principles calculations, we carry out investigations on the electronic properties, light absorption, and mobility to understand the feasibility of LiXO2(X = Co, Rh, Ir) for solar light photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water-splitting. The results show that the band edges of LiCoO2 and LiRhO2 meet the redox potential requirements of the water-splitting hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, the enhanced absorptions of LiXO2(X = Co, Rh, Ir) in the visible light range imply that they could well respond to solar light, while the significant difference in the mobilities of electrons or holes can strengthen spatial charge separation of the photoexcited electron-hole pairs. The solar-energy-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies of LiCoO2 and LiRhO2 can reach 11.2% and 15.5%, respectively. The results support LiCoO2 and LiRhO2 as promising candidates for visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production from water-splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1386-1425	1873-3557		WOS:000806374400002	35636139

Photosynthetic organisms struggle their entire lives to optimize photosynthetic function and minimize photooxidative damage in response to light quantity and quality. When the absorbed light energy exceeds the capacity of photosynthetic energy consumption, overreduction of electron transport carriers and accumulation of excitation energy in the light-harvesting-antennae may occur. The latter favors the production of excited triplet-state chlorophyll molecules ((3)Chl) that can interact with O-2, to cause the formation of reactive singlet oxygen (O-1(2),). The former favors the direct reduction of 0, by photosystem I (PSI) and the subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide (O-2(-)), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the hydroxyl radical (OH) (5, 6, 75). These reactive oxygen species are able to cause photo-oxidative damage to photosystem II (PSII), a primary target for photoinhibition (2, 4, 9), but also to PSI (59, 60), in particular under weak light at chilled temperatures (111, 121). Thus, adaptation mechanisms that balance the energy input, through photochemistry via the photosynthetic machinery, with the energy output through CO, assimilation and other metabolic pathways, are essential for plant survival.The function of the light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) is, as the name implies, to increase the effective absorption cross-section of the photosystems and to supply them with excitation energy. The LHCs bind chlorophyll a and b but lack any photochemical activity of their own. Both PSI and PSII have their own core antenna pigments, but the addition of the LHCs increases the number of antenna pigments connected to each reaction center by a factor of 2 to 4, depending upon the conditions (47). Energy transfer operates in a time scale of femtoseconds to picoseconds. The transfer time of excitation energy between neighboring Chl molecules in the antenna has been estimated to be 100 to 300 fs (45). It had long been known that the pigment molecules must be closely packed to allow such fast and efficient transfer, a supposition beautifully confirmed by the emergence of the X-ray crystal structures of PSI (65), PSII (42, 66, 135), and LHCI-PSI (12) in the last several years (see discussion below). On average, excitation energy makes 100 to 1,000 such hops between antenna chlorophylls before it is trapped at a reaction center. Depending upon the arrangement of pigment molecules within LHCs and of LHCs vis-a-vis the photosystems, excitation energy can be directed to specific photosystems, temporarily trapped on low-energy chlorophylls, or even converted to heat by "nonphotochemical quenching." It does not require a great stretch of imagination to see how evolution might have taken advantage of such possibilities for the development of regulatory mechanisms to deal with variable illumination.The regulation of light energy input and distribution, by the dynamic regulation of the light-harvesting system, probably plays the most important role in balancing the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis. Light-harvesting systems and their functioning in algae and vascular plants have been addressed and discussed in numerous reviews (47, 58, 69, 101). Over the last decade the eukaryotic unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has emerged as a potent model system for studying assembly, function, and regulation of the photosynthetic machinery in general (48, 51, 57, 98). Chlamydomonas has proven to be an excellent genetic model system for investigating different features of the regulation of light energy input and distribution, such as the role of the violaxanthin cycle in protection from photo-oxidative stress (89, 90) or the function of a specific PSII-associated major light-harvesting protein in nonradiative dissipation of excess excitation energy under high-light conditions (39) and other aspects that are addressed in more detail below. Further strengths of this model system evolve from an ongoing genomic project (>180,000 expressed sequence tag [EST] sequences have been obtained, and the second version of >9-fold whole-genome shotgun coverage was recently released by the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute in February 2004), powerful genetics, and molecular techniques, as well as applicability to in-depth biochemical and structural analyses. In this review it is our aim to discuss recent developments in elucidating the composition, structural features, and dynamics of light-harvesting proteins in response to environment changes in C. reinhardtii.									43	0	0	0	39	0	44			1535-9778	1535-9786		WOS:000225824400002	15590812	
J	Zhao, Hui; Jiang, Rijuan; Zhang, Yong; Xie, Beibei; Yuan, Xiaona; Yang, Wenxin; Liu, Jiayue; Zhang, Renjie								MnO2 nanosheets@Ni-N doped graphene aerogel for Zn-air battery								CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE				66	14			1758	1766		10.1360/TB-2020-1469				2021	2021	Zinc-air battery has the advantages of low cost and high theoretical specific capacity (1084 Wh kg(-1)). The sluggish kinetic of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of air cathode limits the reaction rate of zinc-air battery and restricts its practical applications. Moreover, scarce precious metal-based catalysts such as Pt/C are exprensive. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain low-cost ORR catalysts.The conductivity of catalysts affects electron transfer rate in ORR process and consequently affects the catalytic activity. MnO2 has been studied as a promising ORR catalyst for its advantages of low cost, abundant resources and environmental friendliness. However, the poor electronic conductivity of MnO2 limits its applications in ORR related energy storage devices including zinc-air battery. The conductivity can be improved by assembling MnO2 with highly conductive metals and carbon materials. Graphene and its derivatives are often used as substrates of electrochemical materials due to its excellent electronic conductivity and good electrochemical stability. By doping N atoms into graphene skeleton, electronic state can be improved. Doped N atoms make the nearby C atoms become active adsorption sites. Besides, the introduction of oxygen vacancies (OVs) can also improve electronic conductivity of the materials.In this work, a coassembly of MNSs@Ni-NGA showing high ORR catalytic activity was fabricated containing Ni nanoparticles of 10-15 nm in diameter, MnO2 nanosheets (MNSs) of 5-10 nm in sheet thickness at the ratio of exposed surficial to total unit cells of 37.4%, the ratio of OVs to total O atoms of 46.9at% and NGA about 300 nm in wall thickness. Ni nanoparticles, MNSs and NGA all have ORR activity, providing plenty of active sites for ORR. Ni nanoparticles, NGA and OVs improve the conductivity of coassembly and facilitate electron transfer. At the same time, NGA prevents Ni nanoparticles from falling off and aggregating. The big specific surface area (208.0 m(2) g(-1)) of MNSs@Ni-NGA benefits sufficient exposure of active sites. Plenty of mesoporous pores in MNSs@Ni-NGA benefit fast mass transfer during electrochemical process. The basic ORR was characterized by rotating disk electrode (RDE) in electrochemical workstation. Performances of Zn-air battery were studied by electrochemical workstation and LAND battery test system. Through synergistic effects of Ni nanoparticles, MNSs, OVs and NGA, MNSs@Ni-NGA has an onset potential of 0.98 V and a half wave potential of 0.84 V in alkaline electrolyte, close to those of commercial Pt/C (0.98 and 0.85 V). To demonstrate practical application, a Zn-air battery with MNSs@Ni-NGA as air cathode material was assembled, showing an open circuit voltage of 1.53 V, a maximum power density of 114.8 mW cm(-2), a specific capacity of 801.9 mAh g(Zn)(-1) and a specific energy of 962.3 Wh kg(Zn)(-1) (88.8% of the theoretical specific energy), higher than those of commercial Pt/C+IrO2. This work provides a strategy for designing and assembling high performance ORR catalysts with non precious metallic nanoparticles and OVs-containing MnO2 nanostructures for energy storage devices.									1	2	0	0	0	0	2			0023-074X	2095-9419		WOS:000655026500009

The H-and S-NaTaO3-xNx samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The XRD patterns of the H-and S-samples showed peaks indexed to the pure phase of perovskite NaTaO3 and minor peaks assignable to Ta3N5 at various synthesis temperatures. Substitution of oxygen by nitrogen ions causes the light absorption of the H-and S-NaTaO3-x N-x samples to be extended to the 600-650 nm region, thus making the samples visible-light active. The NaTaO3-x N-x samples exhibited photocatalytic activity for H-2 and O-2 evolution from aqueous methanol and silver nitrate solutions under visible-light irradiation. The UV-vis and PL spectra of the Hand S-catalysts revealed the presence of cationic vacancies and reduced metallic species, which acted as recombination centers. These results demonstrated that the preparation method plays a critical role in the formation of defect states, thereby governing the photocatalytic activity of the NaTaO3-x N-x catalysts.

Although peroxisomes seem to be present in the majority of investigated eukaryotes, where they are responsible for many eclectic and important spatially separated metabolic reactions, knowledge about their existence in the plethora of protists (eukaryotic microorganisms) is scarce. Here, we investigated genomic data of organisms containing complex plastids with red algal ancestry (so-called "chromalveolates") for the presence of genes encoding peroxins-factors specific for the biogenesis, maintenance, and division of peroxisomes in eukaryotic cells. Our focus was on the cryptophyte Guillardia theta, a marine microalga, which possesses two phylogenetically different nuclei of host and endosymbiont origin, respectively, thus being of enormous evolutionary significance. Besides the identification of a complete set of peroxins in G. theta, we heterologously localized selected factors as GFP fusion proteins via confocal and electron microscopy in the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Furthermore, we show that peroxins, and thus most likely peroxisomes, are present in haptophytes as well as eustigmatophytes, brown algae, and alveolates including dinoflagellates, chromerids, and noncoccidian apicomplexans. Our results indicate that diatoms are not the only "chromalveolate" group devoid of the PTS2 receptor Pex7, and thus a PTS2-dependent peroxisomal import pathway, which seems to be absent in haptophytes (Emiliania huxleyi) as well. Moreover, important aspects of peroxisomal biosynthesis and protein import in "chromalveolates" are highlighted.									10	0	0	0	5	0	10			1759-6653			WOS:000455325000024	30247558

The nanosheets grow directly on the W mesh and have the lateral dimension of several hundreds of nm to a few ym with a thickness of few tens nm. It is demonstrated that the M-doped W2C NSs exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Impressively, the Ni-doped W2C NSs (2 at% Ni) with the optimized HER activity show extremely low onset overpotentials of 4, 9, and 19 mV and modest Tafel slopes of 39, 51, and 87 mV dec(-1) in acidic (pH=0), neutral (pH 7.2), and basic (pH=14) solutions, respectively, which is close to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations also demonstrate that the Gibbs free energy for H adsorption of Ni-W2C is much closer to the optimal value Delta G(H*) = -0.073 eV as compared to -0.16 eV of W2C. Furthermore, nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency and long-term stability are obtained in those environments. This realization of highly tolerant metal semicarbide catalyst performing on par with commercial Pt/C in all range of pH offers a key step towards industrially electrochemical water splitting.									34	10	0	0	3	0	34				2639-5274		WOS:000524980100042	31549061

The floatable photocatalysts are not only solar transparent, but also upgrade the contact between reactants and photocatalysts. Thus, the floatable step-scheme (S-scheme) TiO2/Bi2O3 photocatalyst exhibits a drastically enhanced H2O2 yield of 1.15 mm h(-1) and decent furfuryl alcohol conversion to furoic acid synchronously. Furthermore, the S-scheme mechanism and dynamics are systematically investigated by in situ irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and femtosecond transient absorption spectrum analyses. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism of furoic acid evolution. The ingenious design of floatable photocatalysts not only furnishes insight into maximizing photocatalytic reaction kinetics but also provides a new route for highly efficient heterogeneous catalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000842832800001	35944441

In the past decades, various systems have been developed but most of them suffer from low activities, a narrow range of absorption and poor quantum efficiencies (Q.E.) due to fast recombination of charge carriers. Here we report a dramatic suppression of electron-hole pair recombination on the surface of N-doped TiO2 based nanocatalysts under enhanced concentrations of H+ and OH-, and local electric field polarization of a MgO (111) support during photolysis of water at elevated temperatures. Thus, a broad optical absorption is seen, producing O-2 and H-2 in a 1:2 molar ratio with a H-2 evolution rate of over 11,000 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) without any sacrificial reagents at 270 degrees C. An exceptional range of Q.E. from 81.8% at 437 nm to 3.2% at 1000 nm is also reported.									62	3	0	0	8	0	62			2041-1723			WOS:000488233300001	31562317

Herein we demonstrate a new PH3-promoted strategy for the effective transformation of noble metal nanoparticles (MNPs, M=Ru, Rh, Pd) at a low temperature (400 degrees C) into a class of thermally stabilized phosphorus-coordinated metal single atoms (MPSAs) on g-C3N4 nanosheets via the strong Lewis acid-base interaction between PH3 and the noble metal. Experimental work along with theoretical simulations confirm that the obtained Pd single atoms supported on g-C3N4 nanosheets exist in the form of PdP2 with a novel electron-rich feature, conceptionally different from the well-known single atoms with an electron-deficient state. As a result of this new electronic property, PdP2-loaded g-C3N4 nanosheets exhibit 4 times higher photocatalytic H-2 production activity than the state-of-art N-coordinated PdSAs supported on g-C3N4 nanosheets. This enhanced photocatalytic activity of phosphorus-coordinated metal single atoms with an electron-rich state was quite general, and also observed for other active noble metal single atom catalysts, such as Ru and Rh.									76	7	0	0	10	0	76			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000483959600001	31365167

Herein we report for the first time the use of molecular cobaloximes as catalyst precursors for water oxidation when anodic potentials were applied. Highly active thin catalyst films were deposited at +1.5 V and +1.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 0.1 M borate buffer solution at pH = 9.2 containing 1 mM cobaloximes. Four catalyst films (CoOx-1-CoOx-4) were synthesized from four different cobaloximes. The current densities of CoOx-1 were up to similar to 5.5 mA cm(-2) and similar to 2.6 mA cm(-2) when the applied potentials were +1.5 V and +1.1 V, respectively, which were higher than the current densities of CoOx-2, CoOx-3 and CoOx-4 under the same conditions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images reveal that the nanometer-sized particles of CoOx-1 possibly contribute to its high activity while the other three catalysts have micrometer-sized amorphous materials on the surface of FTO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data displayed the valence state of the cobalt element as Co(II) or Co(III) oxide species. The morphological stability of the CoOx-1 catalyst was further studied using SEM.									40	2	0	0	4	0	41			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000321622500018	23783365

The complete ionic exchange was confirmed by H-1 and Na-23 solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The atomic positions of H2Ti3O7 were obtained from the Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and neutron diffraction experimental data, the latter collected at two different wavelengths to precisely determine the hydrogen atomic positions in the structure. All H+ cations are hydrogen bonded to two adjacent [Ti3O7](2-) layers leading to the gliding of the layers and lattice centring with respect to the parent Na2Ti3O7. In contrast with a previous report where protons were located in two different positions of H2Ti3O7, 3 types of proton positions were found. Two of the three types of proton are bonded to the only oxygen linked to a single titanium atom forming an H-O-H angle close to that of the water molecule. H2Ti3O7 is able to electrochemically insert Na+ The electrochemical insertion of sodium into H2Ti3O7 starts with a solid solution regime of the C-centred phase. Then, between 0.6 and 1.2 inserted Na+ the reaction proceeds through a two phase reaction and a plateau at 1.3 V vs. Na+/Na is observed in the voltage composition curve. The second phase resembles the primitive Na2Ti3O7 cell as detected by in situ PXRD. Upon oxidation, from 0.9 to 2.2 V. the PXRD pattern remains mostly unchanged probably due to H+ removal instead of Na+ with the capacity quickly fading upon cycling. Conditioning H2Ti3O7 for two cycles at 0.9-2.2 V before cycling in the 0.05-1.6 V range yields similar specific capacity and better retention than the original Na2Ti3O7 in the same voltage range.									38	0	0	0	2	0	38			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000351419800039	25683725

One of these, Mound 12, an intermittently active mud volcano, currently emits large amounts of aqueous dissolved species and water. Chemosynthetic vent communities, authigenic carbonates, and methane plumes in the water column are manifestations of that activity. Benthic flux measurements were obtained by a video-guided Benthic Chamber Lander (BCL) deployed at a vent site located in the most active part of Mound 12. The lander was equipped with 4 independent chambers covering adjacent areas of the seafloor. Benthic fluxes were recorded by repeated sampling of the enclosed bottom waters while the underlying surface sediments were recovered with the lander after a deployment time of one day. One of the chambers was placed directly in the centre of an active vent marked by the occurrence of a bacterial mat while the other chambers were located at the fringe of the same vent system at a lateral distance of only 40 cm. A transport-reaction model was developed and applied to describe the concentration profiles in the pore water of the recovered surface sediments and the temporal evolution of the enclosed bottom water. Repeated model runs revealed that the best fit to the pore water and benthic chamber data is obtained with a flow velocity of 10 cm yr(-1) at the centre of the vent. The flux rates to the bottom water are strongly modified by the benthic turnover (benthic filter). The methane flux from below at the bacterial mat site is as high as 1032 mu mol cm(-2) yr(-1), out of which 588 mu mol cm(-2) yr(-1) is oxidised in the surface sediments by microbial consortia using sulphate as terminal electron acceptor and 440 mu mol cm-2 yr(-1) are seeping into the overlaying bottom water. Sulphide is transported to the surface by ascending fluids (238 mu mol cm(-2) yr(-1)) and is formed within the surface sediment by the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM, 588 mu mol cm(-2) yr(-1)). However, sulphide is not released into the bottom water but completely oxidized by oxygen and nitrate at the sediment/water interface. The oxygen and nitrate fluxes into the sediment are high (781 and 700 mu mol cm(-2) yr(-1), respectively) and are mainly driven by the microbial oxidation of sulphide. Benthic fluxes were much lower in the other chambers placed in the fringe of the vent system. Thus, methane and oxygen fluxes of only 28 and 89 mu mol cm(-2) yr(-1), respectively were recorded in one of these chambers. Our study shows that the aerobic oxidation of methane is much less efficient than the anaerobic oxidation of methane so that methane which is not oxidized within the sediment by AOM is almost completely released into the bottom water. Hence, anaerobic rather than aerobic methane oxidation plays the major role in the regulation of benthic methane fluxes. Moreover, we demonstrate that methane and oxygen fluxes at cold vent sites may vary up to 3 orders of magnitude over a lateral distance of only 40 cm indicating an extreme focussing of fluid flow and methane release at the seafloor.

J	Zheng, Ningchao; He, Xi; Guo, Weiqing; Hu, Zhuofeng								Enhancement of mass transfer efficiency and photoelectrochemical activity for TiO2 nanorod arrays by decorating Ni3+-states functional NiO water oxidation cocatalyst								CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS				32	6			1993	1997		10.1016/j.cclet.2020.10.039		JUN 2021		JUN 2021	2021	Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising technology to use solar energy. However, current metal oxides photoanode face the problem of sluggish water oxidation kinetic. In this study, we propose that the sluggish water oxidation process will cause slow mass transfer efficiency, which are rarely considered previously, especially at large bias and strong illumination. Mass transfer refers to the migration of reactants (like H2O and OH) to the photoanode surface, reaction with holes and diffusion of products (like radical and O-2) to the bulk of the electrode. If the migration and diffusion are not fast enough, the mass transfer will inhibit the increase of PEC activity. This problem will be more apparent for nanorod arrays (NRAs), where the space among the NRAs is related narrow. Herein, we solve this problem by decorating the surface of the photoanode by NiO clusters with Ni3+ state as water oxidation cocatalysts. This work studies the PEC process from the viewpoint of mass transfer and firstly demonstrates that mass transfer in NRAs structure can be promoted by using Ni-based water oxidation cocatalyst.

Such a suspension (in contrast to white titania), under UV illumination, increasingly produces H-2 from neutral water. We show that the origin of this self-activation is not the light-induced deposition of Ni-0 or another Ni-catalyst compound on the titania surface. Rather, in-situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) clearly indicates that the activation is due to a light-induced formation of a suitable defect structure (Ti3+-O-v) on grey titania, combined with the formation of an intermediate monovalent nickel (Ni(I)) electron transfer relay. Remarkably, the resulting Ni+/TiO2/Ti3+ photocatalyst operates in absence of any noble metal or sacrificial agent.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000620267700004

Yet, with more robust configurations and optimal operating conditions, PEMECs can potentially be utilized in energy and cost-effective practical applications. In this study, we conducted a parametric study to explore the optimal operating conditions that improve the performance and efficiency of PEMECs for the production of high purity hydrogen. Our experi-mental results show the high reliability of WSe2 in the oxygen evolution reaction as an anodic catalyst that improved the electrolysis performance of 29.1% in terms of a current density at an applied potential of-3 V compared to the conventional novel catalyst Pt/C 20%. Furthermore, a higher current density up to 17.2% was obtained by supplying sulfuric acid (H2SO4) into the cathode compartment of the PEMECs. The cell performance was also affected by the H2SO4 flow direction inside the PEMECs, and an average higher current density was improved by 4.1% when the H2SO4 flowed from the bottom side to the top of the electrolyzer cell. In addition, a faster flow rate delivered a higher current density up to 49.9% than a slower flow rate at a reduction potential of 1.8 V. Finally, the flow path coating of the catalysts provided a higher current density by 26.1% on average compared to the use of a gas diffusion electrode (GDE). This study provides a way to utilize PEMECs in com-mercial applications for high purity hydrogen production with high efficiency in the future.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000793753800005

Among them, the combined action of water electrolysis and solar energy has emerged. In this study, a hydrangea ZnO/NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) heterojunction was synthesized using the two-step hydrothermal method. The resulting ZnO/NiFe-LDH improved the range and intensity of light response, thus meeting the requirement of electrocatalysis and photocatalysis in theory. Moreover, ZnO/NiFe-LDH demonstrated excellent activity in the electrochemical performance test in the presence of light. When used as a water splitting catalyst in a full cell, the cell voltage was 1.632 V, and Faradic efficiency was 99.1%. Moreover, from the in situ Raman and theoretical calculation results, it is possible to conclude that the synthesized ZnO/NiFe-LDH has the property of absorbing light energy, and the introduction of light energy can optimize the bandgap structure of the material and enhance the adsorption capacity of the system, thus significantly reducing the energy required for water splitting reaction. In sum, this study introduced a composition strategy for LDH heterojunction materials and presented a theoretical and experimental investigation of the light influence on the material structure and electrochemical reaction. Furthermore, it is believed that an important future direction of hydrogen production is photo-assisted water splitting. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

However, the specific role of SIRT6 in invertebrate immunity has not been reported. Here, we characterized for the first time, a sirtuin 6 homolog in Litopenaeus vannamei (LvSIRT6), with full-length cDNA of 2919 bp and 1536 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative protein of 511 amino acids, which contains a typical SIR2 domain. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that LvSIRT6 shares a close evolutionary relationship with SIRT6 from invertebrates. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of LvSIRT6 transcripts revealed that they were ubiquitously expressed in shrimp and induced in hepatopancreas and hemocytes upon challenge with Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Streptococcus iniae, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), suggesting the involvement of LvSIRT6 in shrimp immune response. Moreover, knockdown of LvSIRT6 decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased total ROS level in hemocytes, especially upon V. parahaemolyticus challenge. Depletion of LvSIRT6 also increased hemocytes apoptosis in terms of decreased expression of pro-survival LvBcl-2, but increased expression of pro-apoptotic LvBax and LvCytochrome C, coupled with high LvCaspase3/7 activity. Shrimp were rendered more susceptible to V. parahaemolyticus infection upon LvSIRT6 knockdown. Taken together, our present data suggest that LvSIRT6 plays an important role in shrimp immune response by modulating hemocytes ROS production and apoptosis during pathogen challenge.									5	1	0	0	4	0	6			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000516880900031	31968265

Self-regulated 1-butanol production in Escherichia coli based on the endogenous fermentative control								BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS				9						267	10.1186/s13068-016-0680-1				DEC 19 2016	2016	Background: As a natural fermentation product secreted by Clostridium species, bio-based 1-butanol has attracted great attention for its potential as alternative fuel and chemical feedstock. Feasibility of microbial 1-butanol production has also been demonstrated in various recombinant hosts.Results: In this work, we constructed a self-regulated 1-butanol production system in Escherichia coli by borrowing its endogenous fermentation regulatory elements (FRE) to automatically drive the 1-butanol biosynthetic genes in response to its natural fermentation need. Four different cassette of 5 ' upstream transcription and translation regulatory regions controlling the expression of the major fermentative genes ldhA, frdABCD, adhE, and ackA were cloned individually to drive the 1-butanol pathway genes distributed among three plasmids, resulting in 64 combinations that were tested for 1-butanol production efficiency. Fermentation of 1-butanol was triggered by anaerobicity in all cases. In the growth-decoupled production screening, only combinations with formate dehydrogenase (Fdh) overexpressed under FREadhE demonstrated higher titer of 1-butanol anaerobically. In vitro assay revealed that 1-butanol productivity was directly correlated with Fdh activity under such condition. Switching cells to oxygen-limiting condition prior to significant accumulation of biomass appeared to be crucial for the induction of enzyme synthesis and the efficiency of 1-butanol fermentation. With the selection pressure of anaerobic NADH balance, the engineered strain demonstrated stable production of 1-butanol anaerobically without the addition of inducer or antibiotics, reaching a titer of 10 g/L in 24 h and a yield of 0.25 g/g glucose under high-density fermentation.Conclusions: Here, we successfully engineered a self-regulated 1-butanol fermentation system in E. coli based on the natural regulation of fermentation reactions. This work also demonstrated the effectiveness of selection pressure based on redox balance anaerobically. Results obtained from this study may help enhance the industrial relevance of 1-butanol synthesis using E. coli and solidifies the possibility of strain improvement by directed evolution.									12	2	0	0	8	0	14			1754-6834			WOS:000390716600001	28031744

Combustion experiments were conducted in a thermogravimetric coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and gas chromatograph mass spectrometer. Sludge material (open matrix of lignocellulosic fibers with inorganic fillers) was generated in pulp and a paper mill during the de-inking process. Mathematical models were developed for solid- and gas-phase combustion. The mathematical model for the decomposition of solidiphase is based on the following assumptions: (1) rate of combustion determined by oxygen mass transfer, (2) laminar gas flow, and (3) negligible radiation. The combustion of aromatic hydrocarbons formed/released during the combustion process is formulated taking the following assumptions: (1) reaction rates of methyl-naphthalene and naphthalene an relatively fast and thereby constitute the driving force for the initiation of combustion; and (2) kinetics rate data for the oxidation of methyl-naphthalene and naphthalene are equal to those of benzene. Numerical computations compare well with measurements and provide good predictions of the reactivity of the material during the combustion process. Mass fraction remaining at the end of the simulation period was predicted within 2% accuracy. Flue gas combustion simulations have shown acceptable results, however the computed overall reaction rate was over-predicted. Predictions of the behavior of major gaseous species (CO2, O-2, CO and PAK) were reasonable. Simulations also revealed the mechanism of solid biomass combustion to start at the center of the sample and then propagate toward the surface. Such information could not be obtained from experimental data. It was also shown that indenyl may play an important role in the pulp and paper biomass combustion and may be considered as a catalyst for ignition. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The optimal addition of Fe3O4 NPs and nZVI to promote methane production was 0.5 g/L and 1 g/L, which led to 22.07% and 23.02% increase in methane yield, respectively. The degradation rate of organic matter was also enhanced with the addition of Fe3O4 NPs or nZVI. The results of high-throughput sequencing showed that the reactors with iron NPs exhibited significant differences in microbial community structure, compared to the reactors with the non-iron NPs. Iron NPs have caused the relative abundance of the dominant bacteria (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria) generally decreased, while the dominant archaea (Euryarchaeota) increased in AD sludge. Quantitative PCR results revealed that iron NPs accelerated the reductions in total absolute abundance of ARGs, especially a beta-lactamase resistance encoded gene (blaOXA). Network analysis displayed that the attenuation of ARGs was mainly attributed to the decline of potential hosts (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria). Meanwhile, environmental factors (such as pH, soluble chemical oxygen demand and heavy metals) were also strongly correlated with ARGs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Runs were carried out at three different atmospheres: N(2), N(2):O(2) 4:1 and N(2):O(2) 9:1. In addition to the dynamic runs carried out at constant heating rate, other runs were performed in an isothermal regime (constant heating rate until the set temperature is reached and then the set temperature is maintained constant).In addition, a study of the thermal decomposition for both materials was also carried out in a dynamic run using TG-MS in order to observe the evolution of the major compounds and to discuss the information that could be obtained.From the overall analysis of the data, schemes of reactions and kinetic values were calculated by integration of the differential equations and minimizing the squared differences between the experimental and calculated values. It is important to emphasise that the same set of parameters is proposed for the runs for each material, and depends on neither the heating rate in dynamic runs nor whether the run is carried Out in a dynamic or isothermal mode.

This composition was selected based on the thermochemical calculation using the FactSage 7.0 to find the lowest solid-liquid equilibrium temperature. The melting point obtained from STA (122.8 degrees C) indicated a good agreement with the theoretical value determined by FactSage (120.8 degrees C), which is 100 degrees C less compared to binary NaNO3:KNO3 solar salt. The salt was heated from 50 to 800 degrees C in 3 atm (argon, air, and O-2) at three scanning rates (2.5, 5 and 10 degrees C/min) to investigate its decomposition limits. At 10 degrees C/min scanning rate the salt started to degrade rapidly at 545 degrees C in argon, 571 degrees C in air and 600 degrees C in oxygen, respectively. In argon at a higher heating rate (10 degrees C/min), the salt degradation was delayed by 42 degrees C. The main gaseous products of decomposition were found to be O-2, N-2, NO, N2O and NO2. After melting, at higher temperature the evolution of O-2 and NO indicated that primary and secondary decomposition reactions are concurrent and overlapping. The heating-cooling rates have low effect on the onset of melting and offset freezing temperatures but, have an effect on peaks height, peaks width, and transition enthalpies. The alpha/beta transition (75 degrees C peak temperature) during cooling only appeared at the 1 degrees C/min cooling rate. The ternary salt offers 70 degrees C greater operating temperature range compared to binary solar salt in argon. At a higher partial pressure of O-2, decomposition was delayed by 55 degrees C (at 10 degrees C/min), which could be used to increase the power cycle efficiency of solar electricity generation.

This coupled with global population growth has resulted in increased energy demands, and increased waste loads. In order to tackle both important issues, energy-from-waste (EtW) technologies have been of great interest to the industry sector. Moreover, recently implemented fiscal incentives have significantly reduced investor risk, and incentivised deployment. A novel EfW technology known as 'plasma-arc' can be considered as one of the most effective methods for the thermal treatment of waste. However, due to the exceptionally high operating and maintenance costs, it is being discredited by some for its commercial viability. Microwave-induced plasma, a novel method of producing high temperature plasma, is thought to be much more energy efficient and so has the potential to be a commercially viable treatment route for residual wastes. This study investigates the evolution, and heating value, of syngas derived from microwave-induced plasma pyrolysis of waste. Three triplicate commercial and industrial waste samples were treated under pyrolysis conditions for 25-30 min. Analysed gasses included CO, CO2, H2O, CH4, C2H2 and many other hydrocarbons. CO, CO2, and H2O accounted for >90% of the detected gas mass, with only small amounts of hydrocarbons. Most gas species exhibited a similar evolutionary signature: rapid increase to production peak at approximately 200 s, followed by a steady decline until the sample had been depleted. Preliminary gasification trials showed a large increase in gas mass with the addition of oxygen, and a change in the gas evolution signature. Syngas heating value was determined to range from 11.39 MJ/Nm(3) to 17.44 MJ/Nm(3), consistent with other pyrolysis studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Identified grain types include Al2O3, MgAl2O4, hibonite (CaAl12O19), and Ti oxide. This work greatly increases the presolar hibonite database, and is the first report of presolar Ti oxide. O- isotopic compositions of the grains span previously observed ranges and indicate an origin in red giant and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of low mass (< 2.5 M-circle dot) for most grains. Cool bottom processing in the parent AGB stars is required to explain isotopic compositions of many grains. Potassium-41 enrichments in hibonite grains are attributable to in situ decay of now-extinct Ca-41. Inferred initial Ca-41/Ca-40 ratios are in good agreement with model predictions for low-mass AGB star envelopes, provided that ionization suppresses 41Ca decay. Stable Mg and Ca isotopic ratios of most of the hibonite grains reflect primarily the initial compositions of the parent stars and are generally consistent with expectations for Galactic chemical evolution, but require some local interstellar chemical inhomogeneity. Very high O-17/O-16 or Mg-25/Mg-24 ratios suggest an origin for some grains in binary star systems where mass transfer from an evolved companion has altered the parent star compositions. A supernova origin for the hitherto enigmatic O-18-rich Group 4 grains is strongly supported by multielement isotopic data for two grains. The Group 4 data are consistent with an origin in a single supernova in which variable amounts of material from the deep O-16-rich interior mixed with a unique end-member mixture of the outer layers. The Ti oxide grains primarily formed in low-mass AGB stars. They are smaller and rarer than presolar Al2O3, reflecting the lower abundance of Ti than Al in AGB envelopes.									154	0	0	0	2	0	154			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000258026100068

Cystatin Genes Reveal High Evolutionary Conservation and Functional Divergence in Response to Abiotic Stress								FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE				8						743	10.3389/fpls.2017.00743				MAY 9 2017	2017	Cystatin is a class of proteins mainly involved in cysteine protease inhibition and plant growth and development, as well as tolerance under various abiotic stresses. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive analysis of the molecular characterization and expression profiling in response to various abiotic stresses of the cystatin gene family in Brachypodium distachyon, a novel model plant for Triticum species with huge genomes. Comprehensive searches of the Brachypodium genome database identified 25 B. distachyon cystatin (BdC) genes that are distributed unevenly on chromosomes; of these, nine and two were involved in tandem and segmental duplication events, respectively. All BdC genes had similar exon/intron structural organization, with three conserved motifs similar to those from other plant species, indicating their high evolutionary conservation. Expression profiling of 10 typical BdC genes revealed ubiquitous expression in different organs at varying expression levels. BdC gene expression in seedling leaves was particularly highly induced by various abiotic stresses, including the plant hormone abscisic acid and various environmental cues (cold, H2O2, CdC12, salt, and drought). Interestingly, most BdC genes were significantly upregulated under multiple abiotic stresses, including BdC15 under all stresses, BdC7-2 and BdC10 under five stresses, and BdC7-1, BdC2-1, BdC14, and BdC12 under four stresses. The putative metabolic pathways of cytastin genes in response to various abiotic stresses mainly involve the aberrant protein degradation pathway and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-triggered programmed cell death signaling pathways. These observations provide a better understanding of the structural and functional characteristics of the plant cystatin gene family.									13	0	0	0	11	0	13			1664-462X			WOS:000400926000001	28536593	
J	Yang, Pengju; Zhang, Qi; Yi, Zonglin; Wang, Jian; Yang, Hengquan				Wang, Jian/AAR-3565-2020				Rational electronic control of carbon dioxide reduction over cobalt oxide								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				387				119	128		10.1016/j.jcat.2020.04.020				JUL 2020	2020	The selective reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into fuels and chemicals is expected to play a key role in achieving a carbon-neutral sustainable energy economy. Activation of CO2 is the most important step in this process. As the electron transfer to CO2 is the rate-limiting step for CO2 activation, it is significant to modulate the electronic structure of CO2 reduction catalysts to enhance their activities. However, the intrinsic relationships between electronic properties of catalysts and their catalytic activities remains somewhat unclear, which limits the rational design of highly-efficient CO2 reduction catalysts. Herein, a catalyst-insulator-metal system consisting of Al as an electron-donor material was designed to modulate the electronic structure of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) catalyst. The electrons in Al can be efficiently tunneled to Co3O4 across an ultrathin self-formed Al2O3 insulating layer. Experimental and theoretical results undoubtedly confirm that high electron density on CO3O4 favours the adsorption and activation of CO2, while lowers the energy barrier for the formation of COOH* and especially lowers the desorption energy barrier of CO* intermediates, thereby significantly accelerating the reaction kinetics of CO2-to-CO photoreduction. The turnover frequency per Co atom of Co3O4/Al2O3-Al is much higher than that of Co3O4. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of Co3O4/Al2O3-Al catalyst highly reaches 3.8% at 420 nm, which is superior to those of most reported catalysts. Besides, the increase in electron density on Co3O4 can effectively inhibit the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. The selectivity of CO increases from 57.9% for Co3O4 to 82.4% for Co3O4/Al2O3-Al. Significantly, the catalytic efficiency can be rationally tuned through controlling the content and particle size of Al. This work stablishes the links between the electronic structure of catalysts and their catalytic activities toward CO2 reduction reaction. Moreover, this Al2O3-Al structure reported here, may be used as an unprecedented platform for the electronic effect study of other heterogeneous catalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In silico predicted structural and functional robustness of piscine steroidogenesis								JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY				345				99	108		10.1016/j.jtbi.2013.12.003				MAR 21 2014	2014	Assessments of metabolic robustness or susceptibility are inherently dependent on quantitative descriptions of network structure and associated function. In this paper a stoichiometric model of piscine steroidogenesis was constructed and constrained with productions of selected steroid hormones. Structural and flux metrics of this in silico model were quantified by calculating extreme pathways and optimal flux distributions (using linear programming). Extreme pathway analysis showed progestin and corticosteroid synthesis reactions to be highly participant in extreme pathways. Furthermore, reaction participation in extreme pathways also fitted a power law distribution (degree exponent gamma = 2.3), which suggested that progestin and corticosteroid reactions act as 'hubs' capable of generating other functionally relevant pathways required to maintain steady-state functionality of the network. Analysis of cofactor usage (O-2 and NADPH) showed progestin synthesis reactions to exhibit high robustness, whereas estrogen productions showed highest energetic demands with low associated robustness to maintain such demands. Linear programming calculated optimal flux distributions showed high heterogeneity of flux values with a near-random power law distribution (degree exponent gamma >= 2.7). Subsequently, network robustness was tested by assessing maintenance of metabolite flux-sum subject to targeted deletions of rank-ordered (low to high metric) extreme pathway participant and optimal flux reactions. Network robustness was susceptible to deletions of extreme pathway participant reactions, whereas minimal impact of high flux reaction deletion was observed. This analysis shows that the steroid network is susceptible to perturbation of structurally relevant (extreme pathway) reactions rather than those carrying high flux.

In this study, we used abalone (Haliotis diversicolor) Hc to study the basis of its diversified functions through gene, protein, peptides, and phenoloxidase (PO) activity levels. Three complete hemocyanin gene (HdH) sequences were cloned for the first time. By comparing the copies and location of HdH between abalone and other mollusks, we propose that Hc gene duplication and linkage is likely to be common during the evolution of mollusk respiratory proteins. We further demonstrate that all three genes could be expressed in abalone, with expression varying based on the developmental stages, tissue types, and different pathogen infections. However, HdH1 and HdH2 appear to be synthesized by the same cells by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Furthermore, the PO activity of HdH can be induced by trypsin, urea, and SDS in vitro. Viral infection can stimulate its PO activity in vivo by cleaving the protein into fragments. Consequently, we present a comprehensive study of abalone hemocyanin, providing important evidence for an indepth understanding of the physiological and immune functions of Hc in mollusks.

The effect of temperature on the soot onset chemistry in one-dimensional, atmospheric-pressure, premixed ethylbenzene flames								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				155	1-2			232	246		10.1016/j.combustflame.2008.03.009				OCT 2008	2008	This work was conducted to investigate the effects of temperature on soot formation/oxidation chemistry in the vicinity of the soot onset threshold (phi critical) in one-dimensional, laminar, atmospheric-pressure premixed ethylbenzene flames. The effects of temperature on the evolution of soot precursors were observed just prior and subsequent to soot onset. Liquid ethylbenzene was prevaporized in nitrogen and blended with an oxygen-nitrogen mixture and, upon ignition, premixed flat flames were stabilized over a burner at atmospheric pressure. Three flames at the same fuel-to-air equivalence ratio (phi = 1.74) but with different temperature profiles were obtained by regulating the total heat loss from the flame to the burner, as a result of altering the cold gas velocity of the reacting bases through the burner. A 100-K spread was detected among the three flame temperature profiles. The coolest flame was slightly sooting, the intermediate temperature flame was at the visible onset of sooting, and the hottest flame was not sooting. Combustion products were sampled at various heights in these flames. CO and CO2 mole fractions were found to increase with temperature, supporting the hypothesis that with increasing temperature the rate of oxidation reactions increases faster than the rate of soot formation reactions. Again supporting the same hypothesis, the mole fractions of at least some of the suspected soot precursor hydrocarbons decreased with increasing temperature. Similarly, both the number and the concentrations of detected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and oxygenated aromatic hydrocarbons were highest in the slightly sooting, i.e., the coolest flame. This flame also had the highest condensed phase/gaseous phase PAH ratio among the three flames. However, whereas in all three flames the mole fractions of PAH were disparate in the broad neighborhood of the flame zone, they converged to similar values in the postflame zone at 7 mm height from the surface of the burner. Experimentally obtained mole fractions of effluent species were compared with predictions from a detailed kinetic model. (c) 2008 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This material was prepared by thermal ammonolysis of TiO2:Ta with dry NH3 at 773 K, while samples of the oxide precursor were synthesized using a microwave-assisted solvothermal technique, applying various conditions. The photocatalytic activity of the TiO2:Ta,N during water oxidation to O-2 from an aqueous FeCl3 solution was found to be greatly affected by the synthesis parameters. The rate of O-2 evolution was increased upon increasing the level of Ta doping in conjunction with a highly-crystalized TiO2:Ta precursor resulting from applying a higher temperature during synthesis of the oxide. IrO2 loading of the TiO2:Ta,N photocatalyst also improved the O-2 evolution activity. The optimized IrO2/TiO2:Ta,N photocatalyst was applied to a Z-scheme water splitting system in combination with Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and in the presence of redox mediators (Fe3+/2+ or [Co(bpy)(3)](3+/2+)). Under AM1.5G simulated sunlight, this system exhibited a maximum solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of 0.039%, which was nearly twice as high as the previously reported system with the use of RuO2/TiO2:Ta,N (0.021%).									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2398-4902			WOS:000482057500012

The electrical, structural (crystallinity and morphology), and chemical properties of the deposited films were investigated using Hall, four point probe, x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), electron recoil detection (ERD), Rutherford backscattering (RBS), and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), respectively. We found that the working pressure plays an important role in controlling the sheet resistance R-s and roughness development during film growth. At 1.5 mbar the AZO films are highly conductive (R-s < 6 Omega/ for a film thickness above 1200 nm) and very rough (>4% of the film thickness), however, they are characterized by a large sheet resistance gradient with increasing film thickness. By decreasing the pressure from 1.5 to 0.38 mbar, the gradient is significantly reduced and the films become smoother, but the sheet resistance increases (R-s approximate to 100 Omega/ for a film thickness of 1000 nm). The sheet resistance gradient and the surface roughness development correlate with the grain size evolution, as determined from the AFM and SEM analyses, indicating the transition from pyramid-like at 1.5 mbar to pillar-like growth mode at 0.38 mbar. The change in plasma chemistry/growth precursors caused by the variation in pressure leads to different concentration and activation efficiency of Al dopant in the zinc oxide films.

Cerium doped materials are widely used for technological applications, mainly because of the strong UV absorption and the characteristic short decay time of the intense emission in the UV-Vis ranges. In this study, Ce speciation in different glass systems has been evaluated and related to variations in optical and physical properties, as well as to variations in glass network connectivity. Data obtained from X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy, Raman, and Photoluminescence Spectroscopy are presented. By using a multispectroscopy approach, we determined the Ce3+/Ce4+ redox ratio in silicate glasses/melts and the influence of the two different Ce species on structure and properties.Our study indicates that reduced Ce species are favored with an increase in the degree of melt polymerization but hindered in alkaline-rich bulk chemistries. Consequently, the oxygen ion activity (here represented by the theoretical optical basicity) might be used to estimate the Ce redox ratio's evolution. On the contrary, we show that glass luminescence properties cannot be tailored by merely adjusting the bulk chemistry. Furthermore, we propose an alternative approach for detecting and quantifying the different Ce species in glasses, and we show the occurrence of a non-symmetric Raman vibration at similar to 880 cm(-1), whose intensity is well correlated with the Ce3+/Ce4+ redox ratio. We assign this band to the interaction of the SiO4 tetrahedra with Ce4+-O polyhedral. Thus, cerium preferentially links to the silicate network, and we examined the possibility of using Raman spectroscopy to detect and quantify the different Ce species.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0022-3093	1873-4812		WOS:000651271500009		
J	Papike, JJ; Karner, JM; Shearer, CK								Comparative planetary mineralogy: Implications of martian and terrestrial jarosite. A crystal chemical perspective								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				70	5			1309	1321		10.1016/j.gca.2005.11.004				MAR 1 2006	2006	The importance of the discovery of jarosite at the Meridiani Planum region of Mars is discussed. Terrestrial studies demonstrate that jarosite requires a unique environment for its formation, crystallizing from highly acidic (pH < 4) S-rich brines under highly oxidizing conditions. A likely scenario for jarosite formation on Mars is that degassing of shallow magmas likely released SO, that reacted with aqueous solutions in shallow aquifers or on the martian surface. This interaction forms both H2SO4 and H2S. A martian oxidant must be identified to both oxidize H2S to produce the required acidity of the fluid, and to oxidize Fe to Fe. We suggest that reactions involving both sulfur and the reduction Of CO2 to CO may provide part of the answer. The jarosite crystal structure is truly remarkable in terms of its tolerance for the substitution of a large number of different cations with different ionic radii and charges. The structure accommodates hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, the stable isotope systematics of which are strong recorders of low-temperature fluid-rock-atmosphere interactions. Jarosite has been proven to be a robust chronometer for Ar-Ar and K-Ar dating techniques, and there is every reason to believe that U-PI:, Rb-Sr, and Nd-Sm techniques for older jarosite from Mars will also be robust. Although the discovery of jarosite on Mars alone, with no other analytical measurements on the phase, has given us insights to martian surficial processes, the true power of jarosite can not be exploited until jarosite is sampled and returned from Mars. Mars sample return is a long way off but, until then, we should be vigilant about examining martian meteorites for alteration assemblages that contain jarosite. A suite of jarosite samples representing a significant time span on Mars may hold the key to reading the record of martian atmospheric evolution. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In the present work, a facile Na2S2O3-activation process was used to realize the one-step achievement of CoS-Co(OH)(2)@Cu31S16 microrod architectures from the early-formed Cu2S microrods on Cu foam (CF). The curly Co(OH)(2) nanoflakes with embedded CoS nanodots of 2-3 nm as shell layer encapsulated Cu31S16 microrod core through coordination interaction of metal ions and S2O32-. On manipulating the activation time (10-240 min), a series of cobalt-dependent Co-CuxS microrod arrays were established on Cu foam without much difference in morphology, here CuxS represents the complex of Cu2S and Cu31S16. Longer activation time led to more Cu31S16 and less Cu2S in the CuxS microrod core. In an alkaline medium (1.0 mol dm(-3) KOH), the Co-CuxSY/CF (Y = 10, 30, 60, 120, 240 min) composite arrays showed superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performances for water splitting on comparison to Cu2S/CF precursor, the OER and HER overpotentials can reach 268 mV and 143 mV at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2). The optimal Co-CuxS-240 composite, namely CoS-Co(OH)(2)@Cu31S16, extended outstanding overall water splitting activity and good durability (50 h-performing without obvious decrease). The excellence is primarily attributed to the combined hierarchical structure of multi-dimensional components with both OER and HER active sites in one architecture. The electrocatalyst with 0-2 dimensional compositions is favorable to the transportation of oxygen species and electrons in the electrochemical process and stimulates a synergistic reaction between the multiple functional components.

In this work, a c-doped Ni3S4/Ni2P (C@Ni3S4/Ni2P)hybrid co-catalyst produced by in situ sulfuration and phosphidation of Ni-MOF was decorated on g-C3N4 and subsequently used for photocatalytic H-2 evolution under visible-light irradiation. Among the prepared composites tested herein, the optimized g-C3N4/C@Ni3S4/Ni2P-30 composite showed the highest H-2 evolution rate (14.49 mmol g(-1) h(-1))with 1.0 mmol L- of Eosin Y (EY)-sensitization, which is 10 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4 (1.33 mmol g(-) h(-)). The enhanced photocatalytic activity of this composite can be attributed to: (i)electronic interactions between Ni2P and Ni3S4 (which synergistically increased the electron transfer rate)and (ii)staggered band alignment of excited-stated EY, g-C3N4, Ni3S4, and Ni2P. This work may provide some perspectives for utilization of MOF-derived hybrid co-catalysts as substitutes of noble metals for effective photocatalytic H-2 evolution.

These radicals are involved in H2O2-induced structural and functional damage to SOD1, and their mechanism of generation depends on copper and/or (bi)carbonate (i.e., CO2, CO3-2, or HCO3-). First, in the absence of DTPA and (bi)carbonate, Cu(II) was partially released and rebound at His, Cys, and Tyr residues in SOD I with the generation of protein-copper-bound oxidants outside the SOD1 active site by reaction with excess H2O2. These species produced immuno-spin trapping-detectable SOD1-centered radicals associated with H2O2-incluced active site (similar to5 and similar to10 kDa fragments) and non-active site (smearing between 3 and 16 kDa) copper-dependent backbone oxidations and subsequent fragmentation of SOD1. Second, in the presence of DTPA, which inhibits H2O2-induced SODI non-active site fragmentation, (bi)carbonate scavenged the enzyme-bound oxidant at the SOD1 active site to produce the carbonate radical anion, CO3(.-), thus protecting against active site SOD1 fragmentation. CO3.- diffiises and produces side chain oxidations forming DMPO-trappable radical sites outside the enzyme active site. Both mechanisms for generating immuno-spin trapping-detectable SOD1-centered radicals were susceptible to inhibition by cyanide and enhanced at high pH values. In addition, (bi)carbonate enhanced H2O2-induced SOD1 turnover as demonstrated by an enhancement in oxygen evolution and SOD1 inactivation. These results help clarify the free radical chemistry involved in the functional and structural oxidative damage to SOD1 by H2O2 with the intermediacy of copper- and CO3.-- mediated oxidations.

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry with dynamic reaction cell (ICP-DRC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography hyphenated to ICP-DRC-MS were used for TAs and arsenic species determination, respectively. The DRC with oxygen as a reaction gas was used. Sample preparation, digestion, and extraction were optimized. Microwave assisted digestion and extraction provided good recovery and extraction efficiency. Arsenic species were fully separated in 8 min using 10 mmol L-1 of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and 10 mmol L-1 of ammonium nitrate. Overlapping of AsB and As(III) of arsenic species in the presence of a high concentration of AsB and trace amounts of As(III) were studied. Detailed validation of analytical procedures proved the reliability of analytical measurements. Both procedures were characterized by short-term and long-term precision: 2.2% (TAs) up to 4.2% (AsB), and 3.6% (TAs) up to 7.2% (DMA), respectively. Limits of detection (L-D) were in the range from 0.056 mu g L-1 for TAs to 0.15 mu g L-1 for As(V). Obtained recoveries were in the range of 85%-116%. Developed methods were applied to freshwater fish samples analysis.									12	2	0	0	7	0	14			1420-3049			WOS:000458934000231	30744106

A powerful technique for investigating the redox reactive species is in situ environmental transmission electronmicroscopy (ETEM), where oxidation and reduction can be tracked in real time. One particular difficulty in understanding the underlying reactions is understanding the underlying morphology of the starting structure in a reaction, in particular the defects contained in the material, and the exposed surface facets. Here-in, we use a colloidal nanoparticle synthesis in a continuous flow reactor to form nanoplates of nickel coated with oleylamine as a capping agent. We utilise an in situ heating procedure at 300 degrees C in vacuum to remove the oleylamine ligands, and then oxidise the Ni nanoparticles at 25 degrees C with 2 Pa oxygen, and follow the nanoparticles initial oxidation. After that, the nanoparticles are oxidised at 200 and 300 degrees C, making the size of the oxide shell increase to similar to 4 nm. The oxide shell could be reduced under 2 Pa hydrogen at 500 degrees C to its initial size of similar to 1 nm. High temperature oxidation encouraged the nanoparticles to form pure NiO nanoparticles, which occurred via the Kirkendall effect leading to hollowing and void formation.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			0022-2720	1365-2818		WOS:000425665400007	28850665

Herein, Nitrogen doped (N-PC), Sulfur doped (S-PC) and Co-doped (N, S-PC) porous carbon, were synthesized via a new facile environmentally functionalization approach followed by pyrolysis. Thus, Almond Shell (AS) as Bio-sourced material was used for porous carbon (PC) preparation as support. Thereafter, the introduction of Melamine, Diphenyl Disulfide and Thiourea on the PC matrix with high-COCl- and -CCl- groups facilitated the surface functionalization, and allowed us the introduction of high N and S heteroatoms contents in the PC networks surface. It was found that the optimized carbocatalysts could effectively activate PS, and exhibited excellent catalytic performances for the organic pollutants degradation, with an exceptionally low activation energy and fast kinetic reaction. Based on a systematic comparison, it was found that the N-PC exhibited the superior catalytic activity for activating the PS and degrading various organic pollutants. Such superior catalytic activity of the N-PC Carbocatalyst resulted from its high surface area, its low defect degree with the higher content of Graphitic-N. In addition, all experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrated the critical role of graphitic-N for the PS activation. It is expected that the doping process by N will significantly break the chemical inertness of the PC network and will make the N-PC surface more positively charged accelerating hence its interaction with the negatively charged S2O82-. Furthermore, the O-1(2) was found to be the predominant reactive oxygen species (ROS) as assessed by radical scavenging tests and EPR experi-ments. The carbocatalysts were not easily influenced by the water aqueous phase, which give us more obvious advantages over the PS activation.									22	0	0	0	10	0	22			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000626512900010

The mechanism underlying this process has not been fully elucidated. The effects of nitroxides, which protect metmyoglobin and methemoglobin against H2O2-induced inactivation, have been investigated.Methods: HRP reaction with H2O2 was studied by following H2O2 depletion, O-2 evolution and heme spectral changes. Nitroxide concentration was followed by EPR spectroscopy, and its reactions with the oxidized heme species were studied using stopped-flow.Results: Nitroxide protects HRP against H2O2-induced inactivation. The rate of H2O2 dismutation in the presence of nitroxide obeys zero-order kinetics and increases as [nitroxide] increases. Nitroxide acts catalytically since its oxidized form is readily reduced to the nitroxide mainly by H2O2. The nitroxide efficacy follows the order 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-N-oxyl (TPO) > 4-OH-TPO > 3-carbamoyl proxyl > 4-oxo-TPO, which correlates with the order of the rate constants of nitroxide reactions with compounds I, II, and III.Conclusions: Nitroxide catalytically protects HRP against inactivation induced by 11202 while modulating its catalase-like activity. The protective role of nitroxide at mu M concentrations is attributed to its efficient oxidation by P940, which is the precursor of the inactivated form P670. Modeling the dismutation kinetics in the presence of nitroxide adequately fits the experimental data. In. the absence of nitroxide the simulation fits the observed kinetics only if it does not include the formation of a Michaelis-Menten complex.General Significance: Nitroxides catalytically protect heme proteins against inactivation induced by H2O2 revealing an additional role played by nitroxide antioxidants in vivo.									11	0	0	0	6	0	11			0304-4165	1872-8006		WOS:000404702600017	28365302

Black phosphorous (BP) is demonstrated as an effective visible and NIR activated material in solar energy conversion. However, traditional liquid exfoliation yield is low and the rigid structure and insoluble properties of pristine BP hinder its high-yield of hybridization. Herein, a new and stable noble-metal-free ternary photocatalyst molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)BP/graphene oxide (GO) was constructed for splitting water to H-2, showing dual functions of GO in synthetic and photocatalytic processes. Under visible-NIR light irradiation, the H-2 evolution rates of MoS2-BP/GO was enhanced to 3.47 mu mol h(-1). Rapid electron injection efficiency from excited BP to GO and to MoS2 was confirmed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. This study provides new insight into the design of nanomaterials, and offers a noble-metal-free protocol with photocatalytic H-2 production.									44	7	0	0	3	0	45			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000483451200078

Some common pathological mechanisms involving a wide range of diseases are the uncontrolled inflammatory reactions that promote fibrosis, oxidative reactions, and other alterations. Natural plant compounds (NPCs) are bioactive elements obtained from natural sources that can regulate physiological processes. Inflammation is recognized as an important factor in the development and evolution of chronic renal damage. Consequently, any compound able to modulate inflammation or inflammation-related processes can be thought of as a renal protective agent and/or a potential treatment tool for controlling renal damage. The objective of this research was to review the beneficial effects of bioactive natural compounds on kidney damage to reveal their efficacy as demonstrated in clinical studies. Methods: This systematic review is based on relevant studies focused on the impact of NPCs with therapeutic potential for kidney disease treatment in humans. Results: Clinical studies have evaluated NPCs as a different way to treat or prevent renal damage and appear to show some benefits in improving OS, inflammation, and antioxidant capacity, therefore making them promising therapeutic tools to reduce or prevent the onset and progression of KD pathogenesis. Conclusions: This review shows the promising clinical properties of NPC in KD therapy. However, more robust clinical trials are needed to establish their safety and therapeutic effects in the area of renal damage.</p>									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1420-3049		WOS:000715235600001	34684678

The fundamental steps for efficient photocatalyst for water splitting include uptake of photons of targeted energy range by appropriate electronic band structure, excited electrons and holes (excitons) migration, as well as recombination and selective conversion excited electrons for H+ reduction to H-2 and holes and OH- to O-2 on catalyst surface. Each step if not efficiently taken place could hamper the overall photocatalytic activity. Numerous semiconductors with appropriate bandgaps have mainly been developed as candidates for effective solar energy capture, whereas at present, their low quantum efficiency still remains as the major obstacle in further applications. In this minireview, we will disentangle the progress to develop photocatalysts with good photon uptake from photocatalytic water splitting performance. In accordance with the thermodynamic and kinetic considerations of the photocatalytic water splitting reaction, different strategies for improving the fundamental processes have been briefly reviewed. Some recent advances in facilitating charge carriers separation have also been presented. Photocatalytic water splitting at elevated temperatures is emphasized as a novel approach to suppress photo-excitons recombination on catalyst surface owing to adsorption of enhanced concentration of ionic species including H+ and OH- to create their local polarization to the excitons. Stronger polarization to hinder the excitons recombination can also be obtained by using polar-faceted support materials to the active phase of semiconductor. It is clearly demonstrated in this minireview that such high temperatureepromoted photocatalytic water splitting systems could open up a new direction and provide a new innovation to this field.

The sample shows high catalytic performances for photocatalytic hydrogen generation and photocatalytic oxidation of Bisphenol A (BPA) under visible light irradiation, and the catalytic degradation route of BPA was suggested by the degradation products determined by GC-MS. The enhancing catalytic activity was attributed to the effective interfacial charge migration and separation.

Phenotypic analysis showed that the mutant is more sensitive to ABA during seed germination and root growth, whereas G6PD5-overexpressing plants are less sensitive to ABA compared to wild type (WT). Furthermore, ABA induces excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mutant seeds and seedlings. G6PD5 participates in the reduction of H2O2 to H2O in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle. In addition, we found that G6PD5 suppressed the expression of Abscisic Acid Insensitive 5 (ABI5), the major ABA signaling component in dormancy control. When G6PD5 was overexpressed, the ABA signaling pathway was inactivated. Consistently, G6PD5 negatively modulates ABA-blocked primary root growth in the meristem and elongation zones. Of note, the suppression of root elongation by ABA is triggered by the cell cycle B-type cyclin CYCB1.ConclusionsThis study showed that G6PD5 is involved in the ABA-mediated seed germination and root growth by suppressing ABI5.									12	1	0	0	10	0	13			1471-2229			WOS:000457265200001	30700259

Defect engineering is a sophisticated technique to manufacture defects and alter the geometric structure and chemical environment of the host. The present study provides an all-inclusive outline of recent developments on the classification of metal oxide defects based on the dimensions of a host crystal lattice. Precisely, surface modification of metal oxides through OD (point), 1D (line), 2D (planar), and 3D (volume) defects with their subsequent mechanism and impact on photocatalytic performance are presented. By wisely amending the morphology (cores along with the shells) and electronic structure of metal oxide photocatalysts (TiO2, ZnO, Bi2O3, Fe2O4 etc.) through different attuned and veritable approaches, their photocatalytic activity can be substantially improved. Optimal studies on defect engineering not only expose the altered physicochemical features but also modulate the electron-hole pair dynamics, stability, and active radical production for various photoredox reactions. Altered atomic, as well as electronic configuration, facilitated a photocatalyst material to have different optical features, adsorption properties along with improved carrier transfer as well as isolation rate. Thus, the systematic exploration of photocatalytic rudiments of defect rich metal oxide for various applications such as H-2 evolution, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, and bacterial disinfection could bring significant research advancement in this field.

Herein, we propose a metal-organic-framework-derived Fe-N-C electrocatalyst for Li-CO2 batteries. Within the Fe-N-C electrocatalyst, abundant Fe-N-x active sites at the molecular level were formed in the porous carbon framework, profiting from a host-guest chemistry strategy between Fe-mIm nanoclusters and metal organic framework precursors in the pyrolysis process. The confinement effect of the metal organic framework host was beneficial to limit the Fe-mIm nanoclusters at the molecular level, thus resulting in the formation of Fe-N-x sites with the high catalytic activity. Moreover, the as-prepared Fe-N-C catalyst is composed of dodecahedral nanoparticles stacking to form a unique three-dimensional structure with a large specific surface area and sufficient space, which not only favored the electron transport and CO2/Li+ diffusion but also promoted the deposition of discharge product Li2CO3 to ensure a high capacity. Therefore, the Fe-N-C based Li-CO2 battery exhibits high specific capacity (13 238 mA h g(-1)), good rate capability and excellent cyclability (140 cycles). Therefore, these encouraging results suggest an effective approach to obtain high-performance Fe-N-C electrocatalysts for Li-CO2 batteries.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000766715100001	35266479

The traditional tantalum (oxy) nitrides preparation using NH3 gas at high temperature (850-1150 degrees C) is not favored for the dangerous process and complexity. Furthermore, the undesirable defects (O impurities and N vacancies) in tantalum (oxy) nitrides reduce the photocatalytic activity. Herein, we developed a safer and simpler approach for controllable preparing high-efficient TaOxNy and Ta3N5 through vacuum nitriding using melamine as a nitrogen source. The effect of vacuum nitriding conditions on the microstructure, composition, photo-adsorption and photocatalytic H-2 evolution of the samples were studied. TaOxNy and Ta3N5 can be obtained with the pressure below 2 x 10(4) Pa, temperature of 500-700 degrees C and holding time for 6 h. Compared to the samples synthesized by traditional NH3 nitriding, the as-prepared TaOxNy and Ta3N5 by vacuum nitriding exhibited enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution owing to the lower defects, higher charger separation rate and higher specific surface area. Furthermore, according to the nitrogen potential theory, vacuum condition increased the nitrogen potential and promoted the collision of active nitrogen with the sample, which achieved more effective nitrogen replacement. This study contributes to the simple synthesis of high-efficient tantalum (oxy) nitrides with lower defects. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

(1992) FEBS Lett. 301, 145-149]. The binding and functional properties of these two extrinsic components in PSII were studied by means of release-reconstitution and thermoluminescence techniques. The following results were obtained: (i) cyt c-550 rebound appreciably to cyanobacterial PSII in the absence of the 33-and 12-kDa extrinsic proteins, but the presence of these two proteins facilitated the rebinding, affording a full level of binding equal to that in native PSII. (ii) The 12-kDa protein did not rebind to PSII at all unless the 33-kDa protein or cyt c-550 was present. It rebound only partially in the presence of either of these two proteins, but it rebound maximally when reconstituted together with both of them. (iii) Reconstitution with cyt c-550 or the 12-kDa protein alone in the absence of the 33-kDa protein did not restore the O2-evolving activity of CaCl2-washed PSII. Reconstitution with cyt c-550 in combination with the 33-kDa protein appreciably enhanced the activity, but the activity restoration was much more marked and reached a level close to that of the original activity when all three extrinsic proteins were included. (vi) Analysis of the light intensity dependence of O2 evolution and thermoluminescence glow curves revealed that cyt c-550 regulates the efficiency of S-state transition between S1 and S2 or S2 and S3 or both, whereas the 12-kDa protein modulates a dark step(s) in O2 evolution. It was inferred from these results that the two new cyanobacterial extrinsic components, cyt c-550 and the 12-kDa protein, are closely dependent on each other and also on the extrinsic 33-kDa protein with respect to their binding and functional properties. They bind to the donor side of cyanobacterial PSII and play important roles in regulating the O2-evolving activity.									222	5	0	0	194	0	225			0006-2960			WOS:A1993KN66800017	8382523

We studied the effect of oxalate and citrate ions on the dissolution of gem-quality San Carlos olivine (Mg1.82Fe0.18SiO4). Flow-through experiments were performed at 90 degrees C and 120 degrees C, at f (CO2) between 4 and 81 bar, with a solution containing either sodium oxalate or sodium citrate in a molality range between 10(-3) and 10(-1). The pH was varied between 2 and 7 by adding HCl, LiOH, and adjusting f(CO2). At all investigated temperatures and for pH values in a broad range, both sodium oxalate and sodium citrate increased dissolution rate with the strongest effect up to one order of magnitude in presence of 0.1 m of oxalate, at 120 degrees C, and above pH 5. The enhancement effect was primarily ascribed to the oxalate or citrate ions that are the dominant species in this pH range. The overall dissolution process was described using the population balance equation (PBE) coupled with a mass balance equation to account for the evolution of the particle size distribution (PSD) of olivine. Far from equilibrium conditions for dissolution were established in all the experiments in order to achieve a surface-reaction controlled mechanism. We described the reaction with a surface complexation model, which assumes adsorption of a proton and of an oxalate (citrate) ions (proton and oxalate) on adjacent sites in order to enhance dissolution, and we derived a dissolution rate equation in presence of oxalate:r=r*/1+K(H)a(H)(n) (1+beta K(X)a(X)/1+K(X)a(X)),where r* is the specific dissolution rate commonly used in absence of organic compounds, and K-H, K-X, and beta are thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. The values of these parameters have been estimated from the experimental data and the agreement between the model results and the experiments is very good. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The formation of 2 was established by electrospray mass spectrometry, whereas FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the release of water molecules into solution during the reduction of 1. UV-vis and EPR spectroscopies established the stoichiometry and chemical form of the pzH product by showing the production of 4 equiv of the neutral pz(.) radical. By contrast, the irreversible decomposition of 1 to individual Mn(II) ions occurs if the reduction is performed using electrons provided by various proton-lacking reductants, such as cobaltocene or electrochemical reduction. Thus, cubane 1 undergoes coupled four-electron/four-proton reduction with the release of two water molecules, a reaction formally analogous to the reverse sequence of the steps that occur during photosynthetic water oxidation leading to O-2 evolution. H-1 NMR of solutions of 2 reveal that all six of the phosphinate ligands exhibit paramagnetic broadening, due to coordination to Mn ions, and are magnetically equivalent. A symmetrical core structure is thus indicated. We hypothesize that this structure is produced by the dynamic averaging of phosphinato ligand coordination or exchange of mu-oxos between vacant mu-oxo sites. The paramagnetic H-1 NMR of water molecules in solution shows that they are able to freely exchange with water molecules that are bound to the Mn ion(s) in 2, and this exchange can be inhibited by the addition of coordinating anions, such as chloride. Thus, 2 possesses open or labile coordination sites for water and anions, in contrast to solutions of 1, which reveal no evidence for water coordination. Complex 2 exhibits greater paramagnetism than that of 1, as seen by H-1 NMR, and it possesses a broad (440 G wide) EPR absorption, centered at g = 2, that follows a Curie-Weiss temperature dependence (10-40 K) and is visible only at low temperatures, compared to EPR-silent 1. Its comparison to a spin-integration standard reveals that 2 contains 2 equiv of Mn(II), which is in agreement with the formal oxidation state of 2Mn(II)2Mn(III) that was derived from the titration. The EPR and NMR data for 2 are consistent with a loss of two of the intermanganese spin-exchange coupling pathways, versus 1, which results in two "wingtip" Mn(II) S = 5/2 spins that are essentially magnetically uncoupled from the diamagnetic Mn2O2 base. Bond-enthalpy data, which show that O-2 evolution via the reaction 1 --> 2 + O-2, is strongly favored thermodynamically but is not observed in the ground state due to an activation barrier, are included. This activation barrier is hypothesized to arise,in part, from the constraining effect of the facially bridging phosphinate ligands.									58	0	0	0	8	0	58			0020-1669			WOS:000085791600021	12526383	
J	Vangioni-Flam, E; Coc, A; Casse, M								Big bang nucleosynthesis updated with the NACRE compilation								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				360	1			15	23						AUG 2000	2000	We update the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis calculations on the basis of the recent NACRE compilation of reaction rates. The average values of the calculated abundances of light nuclei do not differ significantly from those obtained using the previous Fowler's compilation. However, Li-7 is slightly depressed at high baryon to photon ratio eta. Concerning B-10, its abundance is significantly lower than the one calculated with the Caughlan & Fowler (1988) rates as anticipated by Rauscher & Raimann (1997). We estimate the uncertainties related to the nuclear reaction rates on the abundances of D, He-3, He-4, Li-6, Li-7, Be-9, B-10 and B-11 of cosmological and astrophysical interest. The main uncertainty concerns the D(p, gamma)He-3 reaction rate affecting the synthesis of Li-7 at rather high baryonic density and also the He-3(alpha, gamma)Be-7 and Li-7(p,alpha)He-4 reactions. On the left part of the lithium valley the uncertainty is reduced due to the improvement of the measurement of the T(alpha, gamma)Li-7 reaction rate. The observed abundances of the nuclei of interest are compared to the predictions of the BBN model, taking into account both observational and theoretical uncertainties. Indeed, the Li-7 abundance observed in halo stars (Spite plateau) is now determined with high precision since the thickness of this plateau appears, in the light of recent observations, exceptionnaly small (< 0.05 dex). The potential destruction/dilution of Li-7 in the outer layers of halo stars which could mask the true value of the primordial abundance is in full debate, but the present trend is towards a drastic reduction of the depletion factor (about 0.10 dex). It is why we use this isotope as a preferred baryometer. Even though much efforts have been devoted to the determination of deuterium in absorbing clouds in the line of sight of remote quasars, the statistics is very poor compared to the long series of lithium measurements. Taking into account these lithium constraints, two possible baryonic density ranges emerge, eta(10) = 1 5-1.9 and eta(10) = 3.3-5.1. In the first case, Li is in concordance with D from Webb et al. (1997) and 4He from Fields & Olive (1998) and Peimbert & Peimbert (2000). In the second case, agreement is achieved with D from Tytler et al. (2000) and He-4 from Izotov & Thuan (1998).Concerning the less abundant light isotopes, the theoretical BBN abundance of Li-6 is affected by a large uncertainty due to the poor knowledge of the D(alpha, gamma)Li-6 reaction rate. However, at high eta, its abundance is so low that there is little chance to determine observationally the true BBN Li-6 abundance. But, at low eta, its abundance being one thousandth of that of primordial Li-7, 6/7 ratio measurements at very low metallicity are not totally hopeless in the future. Nevertheless, in the present situation, Li-6 is cosmologically relevant, though indirectly, since its mere presence in a few halo stars, corroborates the fact that it is essentially intact in these stars together with Li-7 and thus the Spite plateau can be used as such to infer the primordial Li-7 abundance. The Be and B abundances produced in the Big Bang are orders of magnitudes lower, and spallation of fast carbon and oxygen is probably their unique source, in the early Galaxy.									47	0	0	0	0	0	47			1432-0746			WOS:000088824500005

In the present work, we have investigated structures and catalytic activity in CO oxidation of CuOx species on CeO2 rods, cubes and polyhedra predominantly exposing (110}+{100}, {100} and {111} facets by the incipient wetness impregnation method with the lowest Cu loading of 0.025%. The structural evolution of CuOx species was found to depend on both the Cu loading and the CeO2 morphology. As the Cu loading increases, CuOx species are deposited preferentially on the surface defect of CeO2 and then aggregate and grow, accompanied by the formation of isolated Cu ions, CuOx clusters strongly/weakly interacting with the CeO2, highly dispersed CuO nanoparticles, and large CuO nanoparticles. The isolated Cu+ species and CuOx clusters weakly interacting with the CeO2 were observed mainly on the O-terminated CeO2{100} facets. Meanwhile, more Cu(I) species are stabilized during CO reduction processes in CuOx/c-CeO2 catalysts than in CuOx/r-CeO2 and CuOx-CeO2 catalysts. The catalytic activities of various CuOx/CeO2 catalysts in CO oxidation vary with both the CuOx species and the CeO2 morphology. These results comprehensively elucidate the CuOx-CeO2 interactions and exemplify their morphology-dependence. (C) 2020, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The olivine was first dissolved at pH 4.5-6.0 and 15-55 degrees C under the ambient air using a modified flow-through system. Some portion of Fe2+ released from olivine was oxidized and precipitated as Fe3+ oxides/hydroxides, and remained in the system, while the other portion flowed out of the system as Fe2+. Then, a kinetic model, considering mineral dissolution, water flow and Fe2+ oxidation rates, was made to estimate Fe behavior at different pHs, temperatures and dissolved O-2 concentrations during dissolution. The kinetic model was applied to the experimental results under the ambient air; the validity of the model was confirmed by good agreement between the observed and calculated Phi values where Phi is a ratio of the amount of Fe3+ precipitated to the total amount of Fe2+ actually dissolved from olivine, an indicator of the oxidation state of a mineral dissolution system. Then, by using the kinetic model, we analyzed the results of the olivine dissolution experiments at 0.20 atm to 8.7 x 10(-5) atm of Po-2 and at constant pH and temperature. While the dissolution rates of olivine were not affected significantly by Po-2, the olivine dissolution has indicated that Phi decreases with decrease in Po-2 and the Phi variation at low Po-2 cannot be explained by the classic rate law of Fe2+ oxidation. The calculations of Phi based on the above kinetic model have revealed that the observed Phi variation is well explained by the decrease in the power of [O-2] (x) with decrease in [O-2] for the Fe2+ oxidation rate, -d[Fe2+]/dt = k[Fe2+][O-2](x)[OH-](y) (k: the rate constant, 0 <= x <= 1, and y similar to 2); the x value decreased from 1.0 to 0.76 at 0.20 to 8.7 x 10(-5) atm of Po-2, respectively. The Phi similar to Po-2 relationships imply that the Phi value in a paleosol (fossil weathering profile) increases with increase in Po-2 in the Paleoproterozoic. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bozkurt, S; Moreno, L; Neretnieks, I								Long-term processes in waste deposits								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				250	1-3			101	121		10.1016/S0048-9697(00)00370-3				APR 24 2000	2000	A conceptual model, which is a unitary and continuous description of the overall processes in waste deposits, has been developed. In the model the most important processes governing the long-term fate of organic matter in landfills and the transport and retention of toxic metals are included. With the model as a base, a number of scenarios with different levels of complexity have been defined and studied in order to carry out long-term assessments of the chemical evolution in waste deposits for industrial and municipal solid waste containing much organic matter and the leaching of toxic metals. The focus of the modelling has been to quantify the important processes occurring after the methane production phase has ceased, i.e. during the humic phase. The scenarios include the main mechanisms based on various transport processes as well as different landfill constructions, e.g. binding capacities of sulfides and humic substances. They also include transport mechanisms by which the reactant oxygen can intrude into a deposit, sorption capacities of hydrous ferric oxides, and pH-buffering reactions, etc. Scoping calculations have shown that the binding capacity of humic substances is sufficient to bind all toxic metals (Cd, Cr, Pb, Zn and Hg). In addition, the humics could also bind a smaller part of Ca, Fe and Al, provided much of the organic waste remain as humic substances. Sulfides on the other hand can bind approximately twice the amount of all toxic metals. The binding capacity of hydrous ferric oxides, which can be formed by oxidation reactions during the humic phase, is estimated to be three times the total content of metals that can sorb on hydrous ferric oxides. In the studied landfill the pi-I-buffering capacity, primarily represented by calcite, is estimated to be 1 mol/kg dry waste. Quantifications indicate that the alkalinity of the wastes is high enough to buffer the acidity produced by the oxidation of sulfides and by the degradation of organic matter, as well as that added by acid precipitation. Therefore, the main conclusion is that higher remobilisation rates of heavy metals due to lowering of pH are not expected for many thousands of years. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Moreover, the number of lysyl and arginyl residues susceptible to modification was significantly decreased when the protein was bound to PSII as compared with when it was free in solution, whereas the number of carboxyl groups modified was little affected. These results suggested that positive charges are important for the electrostatic interaction between the extrinsic 33-kDa protein and PSII intrinsic proteins, whereas negative charges on the protein do not contribute to such interaction. By a combination of protease digestion and mass spectroscopic analysis, the domains of lysyl residues accessible to N-succinimidyl propionate or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid modification only when the 33-kDa protein is free in solution were determined to be Lys(4), Lys(20), Lys(66)-Lys(76), Lys(101), Lys(105), Lys(130), Lys(159), Lys(186), and Lys(230)-Lys(236). These domains include those previously reported accessible to N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin only in solution (Frankel and Bricker (1995) Biochemistry 34, 7492-7497), and may be important for the interaction of the 33-kDa protein with PSII intrinsic proteins.									45	3	0	0	42	0	46			0021-9258			WOS:A1997WG19200097	9013637

The realization of the SG/ MoS2 and SG/ WS2 heterostructured hybrids was accomplished by employing microwave irradiation for the thermal decomposition of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and tetrathiotungstate, respectively, in the presence of SG. Two different weight ratios between SG and the inorganic species were used, namely 3 : 1 and 1 : 1, yielding SG/ MoS2 ( 3 : 1), SG/ MoS2 ( 1 : 1), SG/ WS2 ( 3 : 1) and SG/ WS2 ( 1 : 1). SG and all newly developed hybrid materials were characterized by ATR- IR and Raman spectroscopy, TGA, HR- TEM and EELS. The electrocatalytic activity of the SG/ MoS2 and SG/ WS2 heterostructured hybrids was examined against the hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER) and it was found that the presence of SG not only significantly improved the catalytic activity of MoS2 and WS2 but also made it comparable to that of commercial Pt/ C. Specifically, hybrids containing higher amounts of SG, namely SG/ MoS2 ( 3 : 1) and SG/ WS2 ( 3 : 1), exhibited extremely low onset overpotentials of 26 and 140 mV vs. RHE, respectively. The latter results highlighted the beneficial role of SG as a substrate for immobilizing MoS2 and WS2 and stressed its significance for achieving optimum electrocatalytic performance toward the HER. Finally, examination of the Tafel slopes as extracted from the electrocatalytic polarization curves, manifested the adsorption of hydrogen as the rate- limiting step for SG/ MoS2 ( 3 : 1), while for SG/ WS2 ( 3 : 1) the electrochemical desorption of adsorbed hydrogen atoms to generate hydrogen was revealed to be the rate- limiting step.									27	1	0	0	1	0	27			2516-0230			WOS:000477089800024	36132594

Especially, the electronic structure of such materials can be further adjusted by elemental doping to improve their electrocatalytic activity. Herein, we selected the Anderson-type polyoxometalates (POMs) (NH4)(n)[TMMo6O24H6]center dot 5H(2)O (TM = Ni2+, Co2+, n = 4; TM = Fe3+, Cr3+, n = 3) as precursors to prepare new transition-metal-doped Mo2C materials. When these POMs were mixed with dicyandiamide (DCA) by solid grinding, and carbonized at a high temperature, a series of Ni-, Co-, Fe-, and Cr-doped Mo2C composite nanoparticles covered by few-layer graphitic carbon shells (abbr. TM-Mo2C@C) were obtained. All these nanoparticles possess a similar size, morphology, and TM/ Mo component ratio, and thus it is feasible to systematically investigate the influence of different TM dopants on the electrocatalytic activity of Mo2C for HER. Both electrocatalytic experiments and DFT calculations reveal that TM dopants have a significant effect on the hydrogen binding energy (Delta G(H star)) and the catalytic activity of Mo2C. The sequence of HER electrocatalytic activity is as follows: Ni-Mo2C > Co-Mo2C > Fe-Mo2C > Cr-Mo-2C. As a result, NiMo2C@C possesses the best HER performance, which required an overpotential of 72 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope is 65.8 mV dec(-1). This work suggests a shortcut to reasonably investigate the effects of elemental doping on molybdenum carbides and explore new high-efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for HER.									115	5	0	0	10	0	114			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000428788200034	29546902

It is shown that this effect is observed in compositions in which the two phases P1 and P2 coexist at low temperatures. They have the same crystal symmetry (sp. gr. Pnma) but different types of Jahn-Teller distortions of oxygen octahedra and different magnetic structure. Phase P1 has a conductivity of the metallic type, weakly distorted MnO6 octahedra, and a ferromagnetic structure. Phase P2 is insulating, with MnO6 octahedra extended or compressed in the apical direction and the moments of Mn ions forming an antiferromagnetic structure. The relative volume of phases P1 and P2 in samples depends on the average radius of the A cation and changes occurring upon replacement of O-16 with O-18. The percolation transition from the metallic to insulating state upon substitution of O-16 with O-18 is caused by the sharp decrease in the volume of the ferromagnetic metallic phase in favor of the insulating antiferromagnetic phase. An effect of the sample microstructure on the formation of the two-phase state is found.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-7745	1562-689X		WOS:000240807000013

Stanley are the most prevalent serogroup B serovars to infect humans in Taiwan. The aim was to determine possible factors to influence the prevalence between S. Typhimurium and S. Stanley. Genotypes were determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis and the intracellular survival, phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of human monocyte THP-1 cell and tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1 beta expression in peripheral blood CD14(+) cells after infection were analyzed. 182 S. Stanley was clonal disseminated with main pulsotypes 2 from 2004 to 2007. Overall S. Typhimurium evolved more genotypes, while S. Stanley conserved in genotypes. Human blood CD14+ monocytes expressed TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta differently among serovars and bacterial conditions (live vs. killed). Live S. Stanley and S. Typhimurium suppressed the TNF-a and IL-6 expression compared to killed bacteria. However, live S. Typhimurium stimulated more IL-1 beta expression than the killed bacteria, but S. Stanley expressed similar IL-1 beta levels in both conditions. Furthermore, S. Stanley and S. Typhimurium differed in intracellular survival in the THP-1 cells, an early decrease for S. Stanley, not for S. Typhimurium. Additionally, higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in THP-1 cells was found agsinst S. Stanley infection, not found in S. Typhimurium. However, some isolates of S. Stanley could recover from early loss to become more in the monocytes than S. Typhimurium. Difference in phagocytized number, intracellular survival, ROS production and IL-1 beta expression may contribute to prevalence different between two serovars.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0147-9571	1878-1667		WOS:000466147600002	30961803	
J	Harstad, Kenneth; Bellan, Josette								A model of reduced oxidation kinetics using constituents and species: Iso-octane and its mixtures with n-pentane, iso-hexane and n-heptane								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				157	11			2184	2197		10.1016/j.combustflame.2010.06.010				NOV 2010	2010	A previously described methodology for deriving a reduced kinetic mechanism for alkane oxidation and tested for n-heptane is here shown to be valid, in a slightly modified version, for iso-octane and its mixtures with n-pentane, iso-hexane and n-heptane. The model is still based on partitioning the species into lights, defined as those having a carbon number smaller than 3, and heavies, which are the complement in the species ensemble, and mathematically decomposing the heavy species into constituents which are radicals. For the same similarity variable found from examining the n-heptane LLNL mechanism in conjunction with CHEMKIN II, the appropriately scaled total constituent molar density still exhibits a self-similar behavior over a very wide range of equivalence ratios, initial pressures and initial temperatures in the cold ignition regime. When extended to larger initial temperatures than for cold ignition, the self-similar behavior becomes initial temperature dependent, which indicates that rather than using functional fits for the enthalpy generation due to the heavy species' oxidation, an ideal model based on tabular information extracted from the complete LLNL kinetics should be used instead. Similarly to n-heptane, the oxygen and water molar densities are shown to display a quasi-linear behavior with respect to the similarity variable, but here their slope variation is no longer fitted and instead, their rate equations are used with the ideal model to calculate them. As in the original model, the light species ensemble is partitioned into quasi-steady and unsteady species; the quasi-steady light species mole fractions are computed using the ideal model and the unsteady species are calculated as progress variables using rates extracted from the ideal model. Results are presented comparing the performance of the model with that of the LLNL mechanism using CHEMKIN II The model reproduces excellently the temperature and species evolution versus time or versus the similarity variable, with the exception of very rich mixtures, where the predictions are still very good but the multivalued aspect of these functions at the end of oxidation is not captured in the reduction. The ignition time is predicted within percentages of the LLNL values over a wide range of equivalence ratios, initial pressures and initial temperatures. (C) 2010 The Combustion Institute.

The sulfide removal capacity of two local soils (Terre Rosse and Bazalt) was compared with four commercially available hematite ores. Terre Rosse soil, with iron content of 8% by mass, showed high reactivity towards sulfide. Fe-57 Mossbauer analysis of the soil revealed that the iron content is distributed as hematite (43%), goethite (33%) and iron silicates (24%). Dissolution potential experiments conducted at a high sulfide concentration (1200 mg S l(-1) at the end of the reaction) showed that 1 kg of Terre Rosse soil can remove up to 25 g of H2S-S at pH values typical in aquaculture practice (near neutral), and that the reactive iron phase (i.e. the part that reacts with sulfide) is similar to 40% of the total iron mass in the soil. The dissolution potential experiments were considered in conjunction with the analysis of the temperature evolution (300-5 K) of the Mossbauer data that also revealed similar to 40% of the iron content to exist as nano-structured iron-oxides phases. The anticipated high surface-to-volume ratio and enhanced reactivity of such nanophase iron oxides, compared to bulk "micronic" materials is supposed to be the likely cause of the high reactivity of this soil. In an experiment performed with gradual addition of low sulfide concentrations (up to about 10 mg S l(-1)) to simulate biological sulfide formation in anaerobic sediments, sulfide breakthrough occurred after the removal of 9.5 g S (kg soil)(-1). Under anaerobic conditions, sulfide removal was found to proceed via a redox reaction (end product: elemental sulfur) followed by Fes precipitation. Reaction kinetics was found to be pseudo-first order with respect to the total sulfide concentration. The iron oxides in the soil react rapidly in the presence of sulfide-the reactive iron fraction in the soil dissolves almost completely after about I day in the presence of a high sulfide concentration (>0.9 g S l(-1)). At low concentrations, 2 g of Terre Rosse reduced the sulfide concentration from 200 to about 5 mg S l(-1) in around 120 h (solution volume = 63 ml). In practical terms, it is hypothesized that an addition of 3 to 4 kg-soil m(-2)-sediment prior to seasonal de-stratification of fish farming reservoirs will significantly reduce the toxic effects and rapid oxygen consumption rates associated with sulfide dispersal following abrupt mixing of the water column.

The composition of groundwater is controlled by complex reactions at gas-liquid-solid "mineralogical composition of associated rocks" interfaces, which depend on the natural surrounding and potential anthropogenic impact. The hydrochemical data (major ion geochemistry) indicate that these ground waters are characterized by the dominance a Ca-Mg-HCO3/SO4 and Na-CI-NO3 water types. Geochemical pattern is mainly controlled by the dissolution of halite, gypsum and/or anhydrite as well as by the incongruent dissolution of carbonate minerals. The pH of these samples range from 6.54 to 8.89, supporting the conclusion that the H2CO3/HCO3 couple control pH buffering. Oxygen-18 (delta O-18 parts per thousand(SMOW)) and deuterium (dD parts per thousand(SMOW)) isotopic data show the exchange between the groundwater and the rock (water rock interaction) and the evaporation effect. The isotopic content of the boreholes waters is of mixed Mediterranean - Atlantic origin and is opposite to the quantity of rainwater distribution, both in space and time in the study area. This is due to its geographical situation in the southern and southwestern of the Mediterranean Sea and between the Atlas area and the Sahara Platform. The concentrations of the isotopic composition of the groundwater are significantly higher than the rainwater. This is indicative of the dissolution of salts and other processes modifying the rainwater geochemical composition during infiltration into the vadose zone. The hydraulic interconnection of these components of the system has led to the evolution of these interesting groundwater types.

This approach consists of a two-step electrode fabrication process: In the first step, ultrashort laser pulses have been used to nanostructure the electrode surface. In the second step, electrodeposition of nickel particles was performed in a modified Watt's bath. The resulting electrodes have been found to exhibit a significantly increased hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. Compared to the laser-nanostructured electrode (LN) and an untreated (i.e., flat) electrode, the electrodeposited-laser-nanostructured (ELN) electrode provides (i) enhanced electro-chemical values (ii) a significant increase of double-layer capacitance (C-DL) (values up to 1945 mF cm(-2)) compared to that of an LN electrode (288 mF cm(-2)) (iii) higher J(peaks) at CVs sweeps and (iv) lower Tafel slopes (-121 mV dec(-1) compared to-157 mv dec(-1)). The ELN electrode provides an overpotential value of vertical bar eta vertical bar(100) = 264 mV, which shows a noteworthy 34% decrease compared to a flat Ni electrode and a 15% decrease to an (LN) electrode. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the electrodeposition of nickel on the LN nickel electrodes results in a dendrite-like morphology of the surface. Thus, the enhancement of the HER has been attributed to the dendrite-like geometry and the concomitant enlargement of the electrocatalytic area of the electrode, which presents an electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) = 97 cm(-2) compared to 2.8 cm(-2) of the flat electrode. The electrodes have also been tested in actual hydrogen production condition, and it was found that the ELN electrode produces 4.5 times more hydrogen gas than a flat Ni electrode and 20% more hydrogen gas than an LN electrode (i.e. without the extra nickel electrodeposition).

In this work, we explore how a simple meniscus imaging probe, based on an easily-fabricated, single-channeled nanopipette (inner diameter approximate to 30 nm) can be deployed in the scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) platform as a fast, versatile and robust method for the direct, synchronous electrochemical/topographical imaging of electrocatalytic materials at the nanoscale. Topographical and voltammetric data are acquired synchronously at a spatial resolution of 50 nm to construct maps that resolve particular surface features on the sub-10 nm scale and create electrochemical activity movies composed of hundreds of potential-resolved images on the minutes timescale. Using the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at molybdenite (MoS2) as an exemplar system, the experimental parameters critical to achieving a robust scanning protocol (e.g., approach voltage, reference potential calibration) with high resolution (e.g., hopping distance) and optimal scan times (e.g., voltammetric scan rate, approach rate etc.) are considered and discussed. Furthermore, sub-nanoentity reactivity mapping is demonstrated with glassy carbon (GC) supported single-crystalline {111}-oriented two-dimensional Au nanocrystals (AuNCs), which exhibit uniform catalytic activity at the single-entity and sub-single entity level. The approach outlined herein signposts a future in (electro)materials science in which the activity of electroactive nanomaterials can be viewed directly and related to structure through electrochemical movies, revealing active sites unambiguously.									33	0	0	0	2	0	33			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000449765000013	29999075	
J	Li, ZJ; Nada, K; Tachibana, S								ABA-induced increase in thermostability of photosynthetic electron transport of thylakoids in leaves of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.)								JOURNAL OF THE JAPANESE SOCIETY FOR HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE				72	1			29	36						JAN 2003	2003	The effect of ABA on thermostability of the photosynthetic apparatus in leaves of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) was investigated. Cucumber plants grown in soil at 25 degreesC (day and night) were administered foliar sprays of 1 mM ABA when the third leaves were fully expanded. Compared to untreated control leaves, ABA-treated leaves had faster rates of photosynthetic O-2 evolution and a higher photosystem (PS) II chlorophyll fluorescence yield following exposure to 45 degreesC in the dark for 10 min. These effects of ABA were attenuated over time after ABA treatment. Heating the isolated thylakoids from treated and control leaves at 40 degreesC in the dark for 5 min revealed that heat-induced loss of PS II- and PS I- mediated electron transport rates was alleviated by the ABA treatment. The PS II reaction center was not heat-damaged, regardless of the source of thylakoids. On the other hand, a reduction in the loss of proteins and manganese during heat treatment occurred in thylakoids from ABA-treated leaves compared to those from control leaves. This reduction indicates that ABA increased the thermostability of the O-2 evolving complex. Direct treatment of isolated thylakoids with ABA was ineffective in preventing the heat inactivation of the photosystems. Thus, it seems that high foliar levels of ABA induce a mechanism associated with thermostability of the O-2 evolving complex. However, these effects of ABA on isolated thylakoids were smaller than were those on intact leaves, indicating that ABA can also induce thermostability in other components of the photosynthetic apparatus besides the O-2 evolving complex.									3	1	0	0	3	0	4			1882-3351	1880-358X		WOS:000180482600006

However, renewable hydrogen is not cost-competitive with fossil fuels, due to the moderate energy efficiency and high capital costs of traditional water electrolysers. Here a unique concept of water electrolysis is introduced, wherein water is supplied to hydrogen- and oxygen-evolving electrodes via capillary-induced transport along a porous inter-electrode separator, leading to inherently bubble-free operation at the electrodes. An alkaline capillary-fed electrolysis cell of this type demonstrates water electrolysis performance exceeding commercial electrolysis cells, with a cell voltage at 0.5 A cm(-2) and 85 degrees C of only 1.51 V, equating to 98% energy efficiency, with an energy consumption of 40.4 kWh/kg hydrogen (vs. similar to 47.5 kWh/kg in commercial electrolysis cells). High energy efficiency, combined with the promise of a simplified balance-of-plant, brings cost-competitive renewable hydrogen closer to reality.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2041-1723		WOS:000783481500001	35292657

In these experiments purified photosystem II (PSII)-particle preparations were treated with the enzyme phospholipase A(2) and supplemented with lipid emulsions. We were able to show that the inhibition of electron transport, as the consequence of this lipase treatment, was only relieved, if phosphatidylglycerol was added to the preparation. A model was proposed. in which phosphatidylglycerol is a functional effector for the optimal conformation of D1 in the PSII core complex. Phosphatidylglycerol molecules are unusually tightly hound to the D1 peptide by hydrophobic interactions. A covalent binding seems not probable. The localisation of phosphatidylglycerol binding sites was found by trypsin treatment of D1 and analysis of the obtained oligopeptides with HPLC and immunoblotting. The binding sites could be confined to the hydrophobic amino acid section between arginine 27 and arginine 225, which is known to be the membrane anchor of D1. This has led us to the conclusion that the phospholipid phosphatidylglycerol plays an important role for anchoring the D1-peptide and for its orientation in the thylakoid membrane. Phosphatidylglycerol with its high amount of palmitic acid has in prokaryotic cyanobacteria apparently a role in stabilization and orientation.The high turn-over of D1 and the spatial separation of the synthesis- and incorporation-site in the membrane, developed during evolution in eukaryotic organisms, might have changed the requirement on the mobility and the orientation of D1 in photosynthetic membranes.									55	5	0	0	46	0	61			0939-5075			WOS:A1995RF99300008	7546031

However, the application of this material in photoelectrochemical cells remains a challenge owing to the intrinsically sluggish kinetics of charge separation. Herein, a facile salt-melt method is developed for fabricating Cu-modified polymeric carbon nitride as an effective photocathode material for solar water splitting. Various characterization data confirm that Cu-modified polymeric carbon nitride contains both free CuCl, derived from precursors, and coordinated Cu species incorporated into the polymeric carbon nitride, which can generate type-II heterojunctions. This special heterojunction energy structure contributes to a significantly enhanced photocurrent density for hydrogen evolution. The proposed strategy for synthesizing the Cu-modified polymeric carbon nitride can stimulate research for the development of highly efficient visible-light-active photocathodes.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000459321700013	30516031

However, short lifetimes of plasmon derived charge carriers, poor chemical stability and easy-aggregation of Ag nanoparticles restrict their direct usage as photocatalysts. In this study, we report, for the first time, the fabrication of Ag nanoparticles fully coated with ultrathin layers of N, O-doped carbon, which were assembled to form a three-level hierarchical structure,i.e.a ginkgo-leaf-like structure (Ag@N,O-C GLLS). Due to the vital role of the N, O-doped carbon layer, the Ag@N/O-C GLLS exhibits excellent mass-normalized rate of H(2)production and recycle stability. Our experimental results and theoretical calculation have indicated that the highly improved photocatalytic H(2)evolution rate of the Ag@N/O-C GLLS should be attributed to the prolonged lifetimes of hot charge carriers by the full coating of the N,O-C layer, which provide a direct electron transfer path between Ag nanoparticles and the carbon layer.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000566092600008

Herein, a rational synthetic approach of Fe doping was adopted to adjust the graphitic degree of nitrogen-rich carbon (N-C) supporting Mo2C nanoparticles, and the prepared electrocatalyst performs outstandingly well in water splitting. It was found that highly graphitic N-C sheets and Mo2C nanoparticles could be simultaneously formed during one-step calcination using ferric chloride, dicyandiamide and ammonium molybdate as precursors. The Mo2C nanoparticles with an average particle size of ca. 3.8 nm are uniformly distributed on the graphitic carbon sheets. The control experiments reveal the essential role of Fe in the preparation of the Mo2C/N-C catalyst. Electrochemical tests show that the catalyst is robust for hydrogen evolution in water splitting under acidic conditions.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000539110600004

Samples retrieved from a groundwater conditioning unit, characterized by different redox conditions, were examined for the presence of form IA, form IC (cbbL) and form II (cbbM) RubisCO genes and transcripts obtained from DNA- and RNA-extracts. Form IA RubisCO sequences, which revealed a complex and distinct variety in different sampling stations, were expressed in the original groundwater and in samples amended with oxygen, but not in the aquifer groundwater enriched with nitrate. Form IC RubisCO genes were exclusively detected in groundwater supplied with oxygen and sequences were affiliated with cbbL genes in nitrifying bacteria. cbbM genes were not expressed in the oxygen-amended groundwater, probably due to the low CO2/O2 substrate specificity of this enzyme. Most form II RubisCO transcripts were affiliated with RubisCO genes of denitrifiers, which are important residents in the groundwater supplied with nitrate. The distinct distribution pattern and diversity of RubisCO genes and transcripts obtained in this study suggest that the induction of different RubisCO enzymes is highly regulated and closely linked to the actual environmental conditions.									23	6	0	0	21	0	29			0168-6496	1574-6941		WOS:000299257300008	22092659

Based on a comparison of the abundances in the protosolar cloud (PSC) and the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC), we propose that the infalling matter carries the nucleosynthetic signature of dwarf galaxies. The dwarfs have low metallicity, and secondary products of stellar nucleosynthesis are scarce as compared to primary products. Using a simple model, we show that the differences found in the LIC and PSC compositions can be explained by adding material processed in dwarf galaxies to the material processed in the Galactic disk. Moreover, some previously unexplained composition observations in the Galaxy, such as the apparently anomalously high metallicity of the Sun, or the "O-18 puzzle" could be resolved in this way.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			0004-637X			WOS:000178617600016

In the last decade, another emerging trend is to grow layered double hydroxides (LDHs) from chemically treated MOF precursors, realizing a transformation of one functional material to another. Noteworthy, the surface grown LDHs effectively enhance the stability, electrical conductivity and mass transfer capability of MOFs, while the latter as three-dimensional structure supports to overcome the undesired aggregation of traditional LDHs. Besides, by incomplete/complete conversion, core-shell or hollow structures can also be facilely obtained, which is another point that has been explored for their unique merits including large surface area, low density and elastic cavity for reaction. This work summarizes the state-of-the-art progress of MOF-derived LDHs, which provides an earlier overview for their conversion and application. In the review, three different synthetic strategies are systematically organized and categorized, with special emphasis on elucidating their respective mechanisms. Based on the analysis of the compositional and structural advantages obtained from the derivation, the paper inspects the various applications of the materials in the energy and environment fields. This review aims to provide a systematic reference for MOF-derived LDHs and propose a deeper understanding of MOF derivatives. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Selective functionalization of C7-triethylsilyl ether and an end-game fluoride-mediated global desilylation under oxygen-free conditions enabled the first total synthesis of biosynthetic intermediate LC-KA05 (1). A synthesis of its C7-deacetylated congener, originally reported to be LC-KA05-2 (2), was also accomplished. However, the discrepancy of the H-1 NMR spectrum in the C1-C7 lactonic portions between our synthetic material and the reported data indicated a need for structural revision. Moreover, the syntheses of the revised structure of 2,18-seco-lankacidinol B (5) and its C4,C5,C7-tris-epimer 54 were also conducted. The NMR spectra of these two compounds were found to be essentially indistinguishable, while the observed specific optical rotations of both synthetic 5 and 54 were different from that recorded in the original isolation paper.

Thus, the aim of our work is to obtain highly efficient TMPs electrocatalysts by a facile and controllable strategy. We used N, S-rich Co/Fe bimetallic metal-organic framework as template to prepare ceramic Co/Fe binary phosphides embedded in N, S, O ternary-doped carbon matrix (CoFeP@NSOC). By means of a facile one-step low-temperature pyrolysis-phosphating approach, the optimized ceramic material CoFeP@NSOC-400 showed remarkable bifunctional electrocatalytic performances in an alkaline electrolyte, which only requires 176 and 240 mV overpotentials to achieve 10 mA cm-2 current density for HER and OER, respectively. Furthermore, when CoFeP@NSOC-400 is loaded on the highly conductive nickel foam (NF) for water splitting, it reaches a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a low cell voltage of 1.62 V, superior to pure NF and other reported metal-phosphide electrocatalysts, at the same time, CoFeP@NSOC-400 shows negligible performance degradation and a relative current loss of only 4.3% for 40000 s continuous operations. These results indicate CoFeP@NSOC derived by MOFs through pyrolysis-phosphating is an ideal electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000632872900001

Photooxidation of Water on Pristine, S- and N-Doped TiO2(001) Nanotube Surfaces: A DFT plus U Study								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				123	37			22691	22698		10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b01166				SEP 19 2019	2019	Using density functional theory calculations, we study the structure, energetics, and the photoelectrochemical oxidation of water on pristine, S-, N-, and (N + S)-doped anatase TiO2(001) nanotube (NT) surfaces. We found that water adsorbs molecularly on pristine and S-doped surfaces, while N doping promotes dissociative adsorption (both in the presence and absence of the S codopant) and leads to more favorable adsorbate-substrate interactions. Under photoelectrochemical conditions, OH groups are the most stable species on each surface with decreasing stability in the sequence (N + 5) approximate to N -> S -> pristine. Surface Ti-5C are the active sites and the anion impurity sites are not structurally affected during the water oxidation reaction. Nanostructuring TiO2 by forming three monolayer-thick (3 ML) TiO2(001) NT surfaces and subsequent anion doping yield an overpotential drop from 1.31 V on the flat (2D) TiO2(001) surface to 0.90, 0.71, 0.94, and 0.96 V on pristine, S-, N-, and (N + S)-doped nanotube surfaces, respectively. This reduction is a consequence of the strain-induced weakening of hydroxyl adsorption on the NT surfaces; the presence of an N dopant atom does not change the overpotential relative to the pristine nanotube, irrespective of the presence of a codoped S atom, while single S doping produces a slight decrease of the overpotential by 0.2 V. In all cases, the overpotential-determining step is the hydroxyl group dehydrogenation.									12	3	0	0	1	0	13			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000487349600001

Doping with metal cations is crucial for enhancing the quantum efficiency of the desired reactions. Nevertheless, details related to the doping of the host metal oxide and activation by guest metal cations are not sufficiently known. The most fundamental question concerns the increase in the quantum efficiency via doping with guest cations that are impurities in the host lattice. In this study, the local environment of Sr cations, which are the typically used guest cations in NaTaO3, was characterized by extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. The results reveal the presence of two Sr-O shells in the Sr-doped NaTaO3 photocatalysts. The small shell with an unexpectedly short Sr-O bond length of 1.96 angstrom corresponds to SrO6 octahedra embedded in the corner-shared network of TaO6 octahedra. The other shell with a Sr-O bond length of 2.60 angstrom corresponds to SrO12 cuboctahedra with Sr cations at positions previously occupied by Na cations. Rietveld analysis of the X-ray diffraction data confirmed the formation of a NaTaO3-Sr(Sr1/3Ta2/3)O-3 solid solution to accommodate the two Sr-O shells in NaTaO3 with no requirement for creating oxygen anion vacancies. Mechanisms for increasing the quantum efficiency via doping with Sr cations are discussed in the context of the revealed environment.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000424735000017

In addition to being an integral component of the innate immune response, evidence has emerged that MPO-derived oxidants contribute to tissue damage during inflammation. MPO-catalyzed reactions have been attributed to potentially proatherogenic biological activities throughout the evolution of cardiovascular disease, including during initiation, propagation, and acute complication phases of the atherosclerotic process. As a result, MPO and its downstream inflammatory pathways represent attractive targets for both prognostication and therapeutic intervention in the prophylaxis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.									550	14	4	0	397	4	586			1079-5642	1524-4636		WOS:000229465000007	15790935

The results showed that the honeycomb-shaped corrosion pits formed on the 46# SiC blasted and without mix-acid treated titanium sheets had an average diameter of 12.81 mu m and tightly arranged, which resulted in a particularly good distribution and bonding of the coating to the substrate. The electrochemical tests in a mixture of 1 M NH4Cl and 1.5 M HCl showed that the chlorine evolution potential of the best coating prepared on the sandblasted titanium sheet was dropped by 38 mV, and the service life was extended by 10.24% than the unblasted.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000749990200001

Prospects and challenges of the electrochemical reduction of iron oxides in alkaline media for steel production								FRONTIERS IN MATERIALS				9						1010156	10.3389/fmats.2022.1010156				SEP 28 2022	2022	Steelmaking industries have been facing strict decarbonization guidelines. With a net zero carbon emissions target, European policies are expected to be accomplished before 2050. Traditional steelmaking industry still operates by the carbothermic reduction of iron ores for steel production. Consequently, the steel sector is responsible for a large amount of CO2 emissions, accounting for up to 9% of the CO2 worldwide emissions. In this scope, the electrochemical reduction or electrolysis of iron oxides into metallic iron in alkaline media arises as a promising alternative technology for ironmaking. Significant advantages of this technology include the absence of CO2 emissions, non-polluting by-products such as hydrogen and oxygen gases, lower temperature against the conventional approach (similar to 100 degrees C versus 2000 degrees C) and lower electric energy consumption, where around 6 GJ per ton of iron manufactured can be spared. The present minireview discusses the progress on the electrochemical reduction of iron oxides in alkaline media as a green steelmaking route. A historical overview of the global steelmaking against recent developments and challenges of the novel technology is presented, and the fundamental mechanisms of iron oxide reduction to iron and alternative iron feedstocks are discussed. Factors affecting the Faradaic efficiencies of the alkaline electroreduction of iron oxide suspensions or iron oxide bulk ceramics are also explored, focusing on the concurrent hydrogen evolution reaction. Overall, if scrutinized, this technology may become a breaking point for the steel industry sector.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-8016			WOS:000868629100001

A higher viscosity of the mixture inhibits the migration of Ni species such that highly dispersed and very small Ni nanoparticles form during heat treatment. The sizes of the Ni nanoparticles can be controlled by adjusting the composition of the raw mixtures. The optimized sample of NiNC-4 contains Ni nanoparticles of 2.02 nm in size which afford a large metal surface area of 400.7 m(2) g (1) and a high nitrogen content of 7.21 at%. An ultra-high current density of 327 mA cm (2) is achieved in 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte containing 1 M ethanol using NiNC-4 as the electrocatalyst. NiNC-4 electrodes also exhibit a good long-term cycling stability. After 500 cycles, 89% of the initial current density is sustained in 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte containing 0.5 M ethanol. 96.8% of the initial current density is retained by moving the NiNC-4 electrode into fresh 0.1 M NaOH solution with 0.5 M ethanol after 500 cycles. The excellent electrocatalytic properties of NiNC-4 for ethanol oxidation stem from the synergistic effect of the porous carbon substrate, abundant N-containing groups and the small nickel nanoparticle size.

Incubation of cells in 1.0 M sorbitol inactivated photosystems I and II and decreased the intracellular solute space by 50%. These effects of sorbitol were reversible: Photosynthetic activity and cytoplasmic volume returned to the original values after removal of the osmotic stress. A blocker of water channels prevented the osmotic-stress-induced inactivation and shrinkage of the intracellular space. It also prevented the recovery of photosynthetic activity and cytoplasmic volume when applied just before release from osmotic stress. Inhibition of protein synthesis by lincomycin had no significant effects on the inactivation and recovery processes, an observation that suggests that protein synthesis was not involved in these processes. Our results suggest that osmotic stress decreased the amount of water in the cytoplasm via the efflux of water through water channels (aquaporins), with resultant increases in intracellular concentrations of ions and a decrease in photosynthetic activity.									113	11	3	0	102	0	127			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000086903400023	10759516

They have advantages in that they can be staged to reduce NO(x) and SO(x) emissions. Iron oxide, as an alternative to lime or limestone, may be effective not only as a desulfurizing agent, but under the right conditions of oxygen potential and after combination with sulfur, the reaction products of coal gases with iron oxide can act as a flux to produce a fluid phase. The thermodynamic conditions for effective use of these sorbents is determined for the first stage of a combustor fed one of several Illinois coals. These conditions include contact of the gas with the following phase combinations: CaO/CaSO4, CaO/CaS, and Fe/FeO/liquid for the temperature range 950-1300-degrees-C. In the latter system with the combustor operating principally under gasifier conditions in the first stage of a two-stage burner, the minimum dosage of iron required at equilibrium and the calulated maximum percent sulfur removal are reported. Also given are the expected grams of SO2 per million joules of heat evolution calculated under conditions of stoichiometric combustion. The calculations in the first stage indicate that, for the Fe-O-S system, higher temperatures give better results approaching 96% sulfur removal from a coal containing 3.3% sulfur. For this example, the stack gas emerging from the second stage of combustion under stoichiometric conditions would contain 0.1 g of SO2 per MJ (0.23 lbs/MBtu) of heat released.									4	0	0	0	0	0	5			0887-0624			WOS:A1991FC61400002

However, the development of high-performance electrocatalysts remains a major challenge. Here, we report the design and controllable construction of efficient Cu/Cu2O electrocatalysts with synergy of active surfaces and interfaces for the conversion of carbon dioxide to ethylene. The highly active Cu/Cu2O electrocatalysts are relatively stable under the condition of CO2 electroreduction, and the synergistic effect of the Cu/Cu2O surface and interface improves the selectivity and efficiency for C2H4 production. A high ethylene faradaic efficiency of 50% at -1.1 V vs. RHE on the Cu/Cu2O catalyst is achieved. Moreover, Zn-CO2 batteries equipped with the Cu/Cu2O catalyst exhibit an energy density of up to 1.17 mW cm(-2), and can maintain a cycle stability of 24 hours. Theoretical calculations show that the surface/interface of catalysts can enhance the adsorption of *CO, and further promotes the dimerization of *CO to ethylene. In situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy studies have also further confirmed that *CO is an important intermediate during the formation of C2H4. This research will provide a new strategy for improving the stability of C-C coupling products and CO2 capture, conversion and electric power generation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000838573500001

Among the available electrolyzer technologies, anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) has been paid much attention because of its advantageous behavior compared to other more traditional approaches such as solid oxide electrolyzer cells, and alkaline or proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. Recently, very promising results have been obtained in the AEMWE technology. This review paper is focused on recent advances in membrane electrode assembly components, paying particular attention to the preparation methods for catalyst coated on gas diffusion layers, which has not been previously reported in the literature for this type of electrolyzers. The most successful methodologies utilized for the preparation of catalysts, including co-precipitation, electrodeposition, sol-gel, hydrothermal, chemical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition, ion beam sputtering, and magnetron sputtering deposition techniques, have been detailed. Besides a description of these procedures, in this review, we also present a critical appraisal of the efficiency of the water electrolysis carried out with cells fitted with electrodes prepared with these procedures. Based on this analysis, a critical comparison of cell performance is carried out, and future prospects and expected developments of the AEMWE are discussed.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				1420-3049		WOS:000718632000001	34770735

Veins associated with granitoids are primarily quartz with wollastonite and epidote and accompanied by hydrothermal alteration of host rocks whereas others are of the more complex "Alpine-type". L+ V + S (liquid + vapour + solid phase) fluid inclusions within quartz crystals contain muscovite and +/- calcite (+/- haematite) as solid phases and homogenisation temperatures are between 124 and 176 degrees C. Trapped fluids are uniformly of the H2O-NaCl-CaCl2 +/- MgCl2 +/- KCl system with a salinity between 9.1 and 26.8 mass % (NaCl+CaCl2). The variable Na/Ca ratios result from different intensity of fluid-rock reactions. The ubiquitous muscovite is a product of fluid-rock interactions. Oxygen isotope evidence indicates that the fluids were a mixture of meteoric and marine waters in deep regional-scale convection systems. The studied type of fluids represents a post-Variscan hydrothermal system and shows the extent of migration pathways in the upper crust on the north-eastern edge of the Bohemian Massif.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1335-0552	1336-8052		WOS:000562487200003

One way to do so is by buffering excess renewable energy via the production of hydrogen, which can be stored for later use after re-electrification. Such a clean, renewable energy cycle based on hydrogen is commonly referred to as the hydrogen economy. This review deals with cluster model systems of the three main components of the hydrogen economy, i.e. hydrogen generation, hydrogen storage and hydrogen re-electrification, and their basic physical principles. We then present examples of contemporary research on few atom clusters, both in the gas phase and deposited, to show that by studying these clusters as simplified models a mechanistic understanding of the underlying physical and chemical processes can be obtained. Such an understanding will inspire and enable the design of novel materials needed for advancing the hydrogen economy.[GRAPHICS].									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2374-6149			WOS:000530941600001

Continuum equations coupled with defect reactions are used for the numerical simulation on the temporary evolutions of defects at different electron injection ratios. It is indicated that electron injections can significantly accelerate the creations of boron and carbon interstitials, but may have little influence on the creation of the vacancy-oxygen complex. The calculations on the relative concentrations of interstitials and vacancies in different charge states via the electron injection ratio show that more and more interstitials in the doubly positive charge state change into neutral ones, and neutral vacancies are always dominant with an increase in the electron concentration. The thermal diffusion coefficient of neutral interstitials is much larger than the ones of interstitials in other charge states. As a consequence, normal ionization enhanced diffusion for interstitials in the presence of electrons can significantly accelerate the short-term annealing progress in P-type silicon. Ionization enhanced diffusion coefficients for interstitials due to athermal diffusion are further estimated using the Bourgoin mechanism, and results indicate that the diffusion coefficients of positively charged interstitials are improved by several orders of magnitude when compared to their corresponding thermal diffusion coefficients. However, the production of boron and carbon interstitials is only accelerated by about one order of magnitude, which would be ascribed into such large thermal diffusion coefficients of neutral interstitials.

The surface morphologies and crystal structures of the as-prepared anodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique, respectively. The electrochemical performances of PbO_2-Nd anode were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, linear sweep voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry. Additionally, the electrocatalytic activity and durability of PbO_2-Nd anode were investigated through the degradation of simulative refractory organic wastewater of phenol. The results showed that Nd doping made the PbO_2 anode surface structure dense and uniform with smaller sized crystal particles, which increased the specific surface area and improved the electrochemical properties of the anode. The surface crystal structures of PbO_2 and PbO_2-Nd anodes were mainly composed of beta-PbO_2. Furtheremore, Nd doping improved the crystal purity of beta-PbO_2, changed the relative abundance of the surface phase and promoted the formation of beta(101) crystal plane. Moreover, the PbO_2-Nd anode exhibited smaller electrochemical reaction resistance, higher oxygen evolution potential, stronger electron exchange capacity and longer life time than PbO_2 anode. Upon electrocatalytic degradation of phenol wastewater with the PbO_2-Nd anode for 3 h, the removal rate of phenol and COD reached 85.7% and 73.8%, respectively. The electrocatalytic activity of the PbO_2-Nd anode had no significant attenuation after being used for 6 times. The PbO_2-Nd anode possessed better electrocatalytic activity and durability than PbO_2 anode.			利用电沉积法制备了钕(Nd)掺杂钛(Ti)基二氧化铅(PbO_2)复合阳极,采用扫描电子显微镜(SEM)、X射线衍射(XRD)、电化学阻抗谱、线性扫描伏安法、循环伏安法等对所制备电极的表面形貌、物相组成及电化学性能进行了分析.结果表明,Nd掺杂使得PbO_2阳极表面颗粒变小、结构更加致密,增大了电极比表面积,改善了电极电化学性能.

The conductive polymer is based on a blend of polypropylene and a rubber, to provide the mechanical strength and acid resistance of the electrode, with graphite fibre and carbon black dispersed through the composite to ensure a reasonable conductivity. Of the different compositions analysed, the best incorporated Degussa XE-2 carbon black. This material not only displays an overpotential at its bare surface which was comparable to the lead electrode, but also it provides excellent contact with the catalyst coatings. Two methods of applying a catalytic coating, thermal decomposition and pressed oxide coating, are evaluated. Coatings prepared by thermal decomposition displays an overpotential greater than the standard lead electrode, although the poor performance of the catalysts is found to be due to poor contact with the conductive sites of the substrate and to incomplete thermal decomposition of the metal chlorides to the oxide. The pressed oxide coating method is the technique developed during this work to take advantage of the properties of the polymer composites. Polymer substrates are heated until soft and the MnO2 catalyst (in its active form) is pushed into the surface. Electrodes coated in this manner with MnO2 all display excellent overpotentials which, on average, are 0.2 V less than the lead electrodes. Extension of this technique to the coating of polymeric substrates with other catalytic oxides shows great potential.									15	2	0	0	1	0	16			0021-891X			WOS:A1996VU42700005

Two non-precious and nanostructured metal and metal oxide electrocatalysts were developed and used as the anodic catalysts in a lignin electrolysis process. H-2 production rates, energy consumption rates and faradaic efficiency were measured using beta-PbO2/MWNTs and Ni-Co/TiO2 electrocatalysts as the anode, where electrochemical depolymerization of lignin occurs. Our results were then compared with recent efforts for lignin electrolysis in the literature.This work demonstrates that the beta-PbO2/MWNTs nanocomposite is the more stable and active electrocatalyst in this process. At the end, our results showed that using beta-PbO2/MWNTs as the anodic electrocatalyst can enhance lignin oxidation rates, with a corresponding increase in the rate of H-2 production at the cathode. As a result, this can lead to high hydrogen evolution rates (similar to 45.6 mL/h), and increase energy efficiency by 20%, compared to a commercial alkaline water electrolyzer.

In this study, BP loaded with surface hydroxyl has been prepared by liquid ultrasonic exfoliation and used as the co-catalyst, which results in 341% photocatalytic hydrogen evolution enhancement to the anatase TiO2 under the simulated sunlight irradiation and a quantum efficiency as high as 18.23% at 365nm. The improved photocatalytic activity has been ascribed to the Z-scheme mechanism.

The surface of NS-K4Nb6O17 is negatively charged at pH 3-11, enabling cationic Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) molecules to be efficiently adsorbed onto the surface, allowing for rapid excited-state electron and subsequent H-2 evolution without any chemical bond linkage between the sensitizer and the oxide surface. The rate of visible light H-2 production in the nanoscroll-based system is 10 times higher than that of similarly sensitized K4Nb6O17. The difference can be primarily attributed to the strong adsorption of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) in the case of the nanoscrolls. The maximum photocatalytic reactivity is found over a narrow range of pH and Pt-loading. This study highlights the utility of single-crystalline oxide nanosheets as components of photosystems for visible-light-driven H-2 production from water.									166	10	0	0	13	1	168			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000260658100032

In this work, for the first time, a series of hierarchical polyhedral 3D nanostructures of Fe-doped manganese-based chalcogenides MnX2 (X = S, Se, Te) incorporating amorphous carbon (C) is synthesized using an Mn-based metal-organic framework as the precursor via a two-step hydrothermal route. The MnX2/C hierarchical polyhedral nano-structures (HPNs) (X = S, Se, Te) display remarkable results such as lower overpotentials of 305, 276, and 246 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slopes of 85, 90, and 48 mV de(c-1), respectively. Moreover, iron-doped MnX2 (Fe-MnX2/C-HPNs, X = S, Se, Te) display improved electrocatalytic activity, achieving lower overpotentials of 280, 246, and 210 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and smaller Tafel slopes of 85, 65, and 48 mV dec(-1), respectively. The enhanced efficiency of two-dimensional (2D)/3D hierarchical polyhedral nanostructures (Fe-MnX2/C-HPNs, X = S, Se, Te) is due to the larger specific surface area, easy charge transport, and integrated amorphous carbon. Hence, the construction of exceptionally efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts could be facilitated by this MOF-template approach for multilayer nanostructured materials for future applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000841496600001

The rapid progress achieved in this research area largely relies on the in-depth efforts on the improvement of battery electrode materials and decrease of the cost. However, the application of rechargeable batteries is still hindered by low energy density, serious voltage hysteresis, and long-term degradation. Therefore, it is of great importance for understanding the underlying redox reaction and capacity fading mechanisms to circumvent these problems and improve the overall battery performance. Advanced characterization techniques, especially synchrotron-based x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), have been widely applied to the mechanistic understanding of rechargeable batteries. Particularly, in situ/operando XAS allows the characterization of practical working mechanisms by measuring the electronic structure evolution of the electrode materials under real operation conditions, which is an imperative prerequisite for the further optimization of the battery performance. Herein, the recent progress in the understanding of the operating principles of several common rechargeable batteries (including lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and lithium-sulfur batteries) based on in situ/operando XAS technique is reviewed and summarized. We aim to provide a comprehensive treatise on in situ/operando characterization of rechargeable batteries using XAS, which could provide guidance for further improvement of battery performance.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			2516-1075			WOS:000645004100001

Although the reactions are strongly affected by the subtle changes in the interface structure, little is known about the interface from an atomistic point of view. In this study, we investigate the GaN(0001)/water interface structure by combining first-principles calculation and ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS). In particular, the relationship between the geometric and electronic structure of the interface is revealed. First, the evolution of the GaN/water interface structure upon water adsorption is predicted from firstprinciples calculations. Computational results indicate that (1) at low coverage (below 3/4 monolayer), the Fermi level is pinned to the surface states originating from surface Ga atom dangling bonds, and water adsorbs dissociatively, forming oxygen atoms as well as hydroxyl groups, and (2) at higher coverage (above 3/4 monolayer), the Fermi level becomes free from the pinning, and adsorption of intact water becomes dominant. AP-XPS measurements were carried out for the water coverage ranging from submonolayer (low coverage) to several monolayers (high coverage). The core-level binding energies calculated from first-principles were used successfully to assign the adsorbate species to experimental O is peaks. Both the electronic and geometric structures predicted by the first-principles calculation explain well the experimental spectra obtained by the AP-XPS measurements. The results demonstrate that the combined spectroscopic and first-principles computational approach offers a detailed atomic level understanding of the solid/liquid interface structures.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000541745800032

The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The photocatalysis capability and stability of the as-prepared samples were studied by the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under simulated sun irradiation. In addition, the degree of mineralization of RhB and the optimum conditions (pH and dosage of catalyst) for the reaction system were investigated. Tetracycline was used to remove the sensitization effect. Fe3O4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites not only had higher photocatalytic activity but also obtained magnetic property and stronger stability, which are important for the reuse in water pollutant treatment. Photoelectrochemical activities of Fe3O4/g-C3N4 were also investigated. The photocurrent enhancement indicates a higher separation efficiency of electrons and holes due to the heterojunction between Fe3O4 and g-C3N4. RhB degradation improved under acidic conditions and simulated sun irradiation, given that more center dot OH is produced because of the oxidation of Fenton. The h(+) is a main participant in the degradation of RhB. Active species analysis showed that dissolved oxygen plays an important role in the formation of reactive species (center dot O-2(-) and center dot OH), which are also important participants in the degradation of RhB.									50	2	0	0	6	0	52			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000417068300043

Hybrids of semiconductors and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are promising nanomaterials due to their flexible properties and the large number of compositions/preparation variables obtainable for fine-tuning. Recent advancements have been confirmed that semiconductor/LDHs nanocomposites can be envisioned as the most privileged and promising novel catalysts in the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical applications. Moreover, this study gives an advanced review important developments in the production of the LDHs/semiconductor photocatalysts for energy generation and ecological clean up, such as degradation of dyes, O-2 evolution, hydrogen production and CO2 reduction. We desire that this review article will promote the researchers to expand the applications of LDHs/semiconductor composite in the field of photocatalysis in a green approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It is attributed to not only the interaction of released metal ions with functional groups of vital enzymes and proteins, but also the collapsing force of reactive oxygen species to the cells. Photoelectrochemical measurements show that the photogenerated charges of Ag/Zn0.995Ni0.005O possess longer lifetime and higher separation resulting from the synergistic effect between Ni and Ag, which leads to its superior visible-light-driven antibacterial performance. Gram-negative bacteria are more effectively restrained by Ag/Zn0.995Ni0.005O than Gram-positive bacteria because of structural difference between their cell walls.

Analysis of H-O isotopes indicates that deltaD_(v-SMOW) varies from-53 to-87,delta~(18)O_(H_2O) varies from 2.58 to 5.68.From the early to the late mineralization stages,a slow cooling process might have occurred in the deposit.Very likely the tungsten might migrate as a form of complex of tungstenic acid after becoming fluid,and the reaction of W-bearing fluid with carbonate country rock led to variation of the pH value in the fluid.And the temperature decrease caused by the atmospheric water added in the later period might be main mechanism of tungsten precipitation mineralization of the Zhuxi deposit.			为了探讨江西朱溪钨多金属矿床的成矿流体性质及演化特征,本文对不同成矿阶段的矿石矿物和脉石矿物开展了流体包裹体以及H-O同位素研究。流体包裹体显微测温结果显示,该矿床矽卡岩期矿物流体包裹体的均一温度范围为231 ~ 358℃,盐度范围为3.87% ~ 5.86%NaCl_(eqv),氧化物期和石英硫化物期矿物流体包裹体温度范围分别为167 ~ 403℃和114 ~ 351℃,盐度范围分别为1.57% ~ 6.45%NaCl_(eqv)和0.88% ~ 8.00%NaCl_(eqv)。激光拉曼探针测试表明,朱溪钨矿床流体包裹体组分主要为H_2O,此外还含有少量CH_4、N_2和C_2H_4。石英H-O同位素结果显示,deltaD_(v-SMOW)值变化范围为-53 ~-87,delta~(18)O_(H_2O)值介于2.58 ~ 5.68。自成矿早期到晚期,该矿床总体呈现缓慢降温的演化过程,钨在进入流体相后很可能以钨杂酸的络合物形式迁移,含钨的流体与碳酸盐岩围岩发生反应而引发流体酸碱度的变化,或后期大气水的加入导致的温度降低可能是朱溪钨矿床中钨沉淀成矿的主要机制。						1	2	0	0	0	0	2			0495-5331			CSCD:6700096

In order to help researchers with the substrate selection process, we employ a consistent experimental methodology to evaluate the electrochemical reactivity and stability of seven potential substrate materials for electrocatalyst and photoelectrode evaluation. Using cyclic voltammetry with a progressively increased scan range, we characterize three transparent conducting oxides (indium tin oxide, fluorine-doped tin oxide, and aluminum-doped zinc oxide) and four opaque conductors (gold, stainless steel 304, glassy carbon, and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite) in three different electrolytes (sulfuric acid, sodium acetate, and sodium hydroxide). We determine the inert potential window for each substrate/electrolyte combination and make recommendations about which materials may be most suitable for application under different experimental conditions. Furthermore, the testing methodology provides a framework for other researchers to evaluate and report the baseline activity of other substrates of interest to the broader community.									156	0	0	0	12	0	157			1932-6203			WOS:000346765000003	25357131

Experiments were conducted using boron-doped diamond (BDD) and platinum supported on Ti (Pt/Ti) electrodes in the absence and presence of NaCl in the solution. The direct process for removing color is relatively similar for both anodes, while the electrochemical degradation is significantly accelerated by the presence of halogen salt in the solution. Interestingly, it does not depend on applied current density, but rather on NaCl concentration. Therefore, the electrochemical processes (direct/indirect) favor specific oxidation pathways depending on electrocatalytic material. Whereas, the Pt/Ti anode favors preferentially color removal by direct and indirect oxidation (100% of color removal) due to the fragmentation of the azo dye group; BDD electrode favors color and organic load removals in both processes (95% and up to 87%, respectively), due to the rupture of dye in different parts of its chemical structure. Parameters of removal efficiency and energy consumption for the electrochemical process were estimated. Finally, an explanation has been attempted for the role of halide, in relation with the oxygen evolution reaction, concomitant with the electrochemical incineration as well as electrocatalytic mechanisms, for each one of the electrodes used.

Increase of initial copper concentration to 10(-2) mol.dm(-3) resulted in formation of different reaction product-octahedral cuprous oxide nanoparticles. Solutions were irradiated by means of electron beam, (60)Co gamma rays (dose rate 70 Gy.h(-1)) or by 400 W medium-pressure mercury lamp and were characterised by UV-Vis spectrophotometry, X-Ray Powder Diffraction, TEM and SEM. Pink to violet colour of colloidal copper solutions corresponded to measured copper surface plasmon band at circa 580 nm and has been found to be very sensitive to oxygen, which causes dissolution of particles. Therefore, the influence of purging by nitrogen gas prior to irradiation was thoroughly examined and has been found to only hinder, not alter irradiation effects. Moreover, the evolution of absorption spectrum of colloidal copper solution in contact with air has been measured, revealing interesting non-monotonous dependence on the air exposure time, probably caused by formation of protective oxide layer. Catalytic activity of prepared cuprous oxide has been measured by catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and has been found to be higher or comparable to commercial cuprous oxide.									31	1	0	0	2	0	32			0236-5731			WOS:000285099700003

This material is competitive with state-of-the-art metal oxides. and exhibits an unparalleled long-term stability at neutral pH and ambient conditions, maintaining constant catalytic rates for weeks. In addition to its remarkable catalytic activity, CoHCF adds the typical properties of molecule-based materials: transparency to visible light, porosity, flexibility, processability, and low density.

The electrochemical characteristics of indium electrodes in 0.1 M Na-borate buffer solution; pH 10 have been correlated with the impedance spectroscopy results. The impedance spectra are interpreted in terms of an electrical equivalent circuit (EEC) based on a possible physical model, with the circuit elements representing electrochemical properties of indium and its oxide films. On the basis of the current, capacitance, resistance and Warburg impedance data, the potential regions where specific surface reactions occur could be delineated. The an odic behavior of indium was found to be under mixed control; the initial stage of an In oxide formation involves a faster charging process and a slower surface diffusion process, with an effective diffusion coefficient of the order of 10(-15) cm(2) s(-1). On the top of this layer, which is of monolayer dimensions, the growth of the barrier oxy-hydrate layer occurs via a base catalyzed hydrolysis of the surface oxide. Transformation from a gel-like oxide structure (InOOH) into the thermodynamically favorable and more stable crystalline form (In2O3) takes place at high positive potentials. In2O3 was found to expose high electric conductivity, which was manifested through oxygen evolution on its surface. Impedance spectroscopy was found to be a suitable technique for the complex structure characterisation of the surface layer formed anodically on indium, (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

Besides this, adsorption behaviour of species created from aqueous SO2 (HSO3-/SO32- ions and/or molecular SO2 as well as their oxidation and reduction products) is compared with that of HSO4-/SO42- ions in order to get a deeper insight into the nature and sorption properties of oxidation products. Both the oxidation and reduction of aqueous SO2 occur on a polycrystalline gold in acid solutions between the onset of hydrogen and oxygen evolution. At higher pH values (3.5 and 6.5) the onset of the oxidation processes shifts towards more positive potentials and the electroreduction commences at less positive potential values. It is probable that a poisoning effect owing to oxidized adspecies rather than the electrocatalytic behaviour of adsorbed reduction products prevail over the electrooxidation phenomena. Both HSO4-/SO42- and S2O62- are presumably formed (and adsorbed) on gold upon electrooxidation of aqueous SO2. The apparent inhibition of the electrooxidation processes in acid solutions may most likely be due to the formation of some surface complexes consisting of oxidized adspecies and ''strongly bonded'' molecular SO2.

To begin to compare between catalytic materials for electrolysis applications, these extrinsic factors must first be understood and controlled. Here, we modify extrinsic electrode properties and study the effects of bubble release to examine how the electrode and surface design impact the performance of water electrolysis. We fabricate robust and cost-effective electrodes through a sequential three-dimensional (3D) printing and metal deposition procedure. Through a systematic assessment of the deposition procedure, we confirm the close relationship between extrinsic electrode properties (i.e., wettability, surface roughness, and electrochemically active surface area) and electrochemical performance. Modifying the electrode geometry, size, and electrolyte flow rate results in an overpotential decrease and different bubble diameters and lifetimes for the hydrogen (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). Hence, we demonstrate the essential role of the electrode architecture and forced electrolyte convection on bubble release. Additionally, we confirm the suitability of ordered, Ni-coated 3D porous structures by evaluating the HER/OER performance, bubble dissipation, and long-term stability. Finally, we utilize the 3D porous electrode as a support for studying a benchmark NiFe electrocatalyst, confirming the robustness and effectiveness of 3D-printed electrodes for testing electrocatalytic materials while extrinsic properties are precisely controlled. Overall, we demonstrate that tailoring electrode architectures and surface properties result in precise tuning of extrinsic electrode properties, providing more reproducible and comparable conditions for testing the efficiency of electrode materials for water electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000859193800001	36084243

Huneau, B; LeCam, JB; Marco, Y; Verron, E		An approach for modeling thermo-oxidative aging in polymer materials								CONSTITUTIVE MODELS FOR RUBBER XI								577	580						2019	2019	The knowledge of aging processes in polymers is of great interest for many applications in engineering, as the usually very complex mechanisms can reduce the lifetime of machine components drastically. Often those single mechanisms are coupled strongly, which makes the modeling even more complicated. One damaging interaction might occur when dealing with cracking in polymers: The crack may enable oxidation deep inside the material rather than being restricted to original surface regions. The oxidation state of the polymer, in turn, can support the crack propagation by embrittling the material and by lowering the crack resistance. This supported propagation of the crack, again, causes progression of the oxidation deeper inside the material and the whole procedure might repeat and carry the crack tip even deeper into the material. In the present work, a new approach to capture some of those mechanisms is presented. Here, the phase field method, which has evolved into a strong and versatile tool for modeling material processes, is used to describe the oxidation process. An energy, including a gradient-based term to describe interfaces and another term corresponding to the reaction, drives the evolution. This is underlain by a separate approach for diffusion of oxygen which is able to trigger the change from a virgin material to a fully oxidized material. In this work, cracks are able to carry the oxidation under the surface and thus might accelerate the whole process. Different numerical experiments based on the finite element method have been performed and are presented to introduce the developed model.					11th European Conference on Constitutive Models for Rubber11th European Conference on Constitutive Models for Rubber	JUN 25-27, 2019JUN 25-27, 2019	Vibracoustic; Acoem Grp, Metravib; Michelin; Hutchinson; ElatopoleVibracoustic; Acoem Grp, Metravib; Michelin; Hutchinson; Elatopole	Nantes, FRANCENantes, FRANCE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-429-32471-0; 978-0-367-34258-6	WOS:000552721500102

The effects of deposition time and types of precursors on the morphology of the as-prepared electrodes were investigated by X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As a results, the CuCo2O4 electrode prepared by nitrate salts at the deposition time of 10 min, includes the most uniform and ultrathin nanosheet arrays and exhibits the highest capacitance performance, such as ultrahigh specific capacitance of 1330 F g(-1) at 2 A g(-1) with 70% capacitance retention (938 F g(-1)) at ultrahigh current density of 60 A g-1, excellent cycling stability of 93.6% capacitance retention after 5000CD cycles and the maximum energy density of 29.55 Wh kg(-1) at the power density of 0.4 kW kg(-1). These superior electrochemical performances have been attributed to its unique structures with direct connected ultrathin nanosheets on the surface of Ni foam and abundant pores provide large electroactive sites for electrochemical reactions, as well as facile electron, ion transport and high electrical conductivity.

Using Moire Patterning to Map Surface Reactivity versus Atom Registration: Chemisorbed Trimethyl Acetic Acid on TiO/Au(111)								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				118	51			29999	30005		10.1021/jp5103302				DEC 25 2014	2014	A surface moire pattern is used to examine the site-dependent variation in the surface reactivity of an organic molecule on an epitaxial-layered system. Our experiment examines chemisorption of trimethyl acetic acid (TMAA) molecules on epitaxial monolayers of TiO on Au(111). This layered system is shown to exhibit a 6-fold pinwheel moire pattern, such that each pinwheel consists of six interlocking triangles (with both a clockwise and counterclockwise orientation) around a central hub. The unit cell for this pinwheel moire pattern is measured to be 28 angstrom x 28 angstrom. The evolution of the TMAA chemisorption geometry on these patterned layers as a function of coverage is investigated by atomic-resolution scanning-tunneling-microscopy (STM) imaging. TMAA is preferentially chemisorbed, most probably to form trimethyl acetate (TMA), at the center of the fixed pinwheels at low coverage (similar to 0.02 ML). This chemisorption pattern evolves into a 3-fold symmetric triad at the center of each pinwheel as the coverage of TMA increases to similar to 0.06 ML. Finally at saturation coverage, the chemisorbed TMA groups leave an empty region in the central region of each triangle even, indicating a significant difference in adsorption energy between adsorption at the hub of the pinwheel and at the center of each triangle. These results show the utility of moire patterns in understanding the role of substrate-overlayer atomic registry to probe surface reactions.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1932-7447			WOS:000347360200061

The initial phase, with formula HxLiyCo3-delta O4, contains hydrogen, lithium, cobalt vacancies, and a mixed valence Co4+/Co3+ within the structure, leading to an electronic conductivity higher than that of stoichiometric Co3O4. Its structural evolution under thermal treatment was studied by X-ray diffraction and chemical analysis, which reveal modifications in structure and compositions, involving water release, increase of the Co/O atomic ratio, and modification of the Co4+/Co3+ ratio. The RT to 300 degrees C range is particularly interesting as a single-phase domain and the materials obtained in this temperature range were investigated by chemical analysis, electronic conductivity and specific surface area measurements. Upon increasing temperature, the enhancement of the Co4+/Co3+ ratio, together with cationic redistribution in the spinel framework, results in an improvement of the electronic conductivity (more than 2 orders of magnitude for materials heated above 150 degrees C). Finally, the systematic thermal study of electronic conductivity and specific surface area of the materials allows to determine an optimal heat-treatment temperature leading to an optimized active electrode material for electrochemical energy storage applications, especially in supercapacitors. Such a solid state chemistry approach combining many material characterization techniques to reach a complete knowledge of the material is quite rare in the literature concerning oxides for supercapacitors.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1932-7447			WOS:000318892000003

M./0000-0002-8796-1212; 			Electrochemical in situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopic characterization of a trinuclear ruthenium complex, Ru-red								JOURNAL OF RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY				44	8			1195	1199		10.1002/jrs.4329				AUG 2013	2013	To study the fate of a molecular di--oxo-bridged trinuclear ruthenium complex, [(NH3)(5)Ru-O-Ru(NH3)(4)-O-Ru(NH3)(5)](6+), also known as Ru-red, during the electro-driven water oxidation reaction, electrochemical in situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) investigations have been conducted on an electrochemically roughened gold surface in acidic condition. It was previously described that on a basal plane pyrolitic graphite electrode in 0.1M H2SO4 aqueous solution, Ru-red undergoes one electron oxidative conversion into a stable higher oxidation state ruthenium complex, Ru-brown, at<1.0V (vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)), and this leads to water oxidation and dioxygen release, but the fate of Ru-red during electrochemistry was not studied in much detail. In this investigation, Ru-red dispersed in acid electrolyte and immobilized on a roughened gold electrode without Ru-red in solution has been subjected to anodic controlled potential experiments, and in situ SERS was carried out at various potentials in succession. The electrochemical SERS data obtained for Ru-red are also compared with in situ SERS results of an electrodeposited ruthenium oxide thin film on the Au disk. Our study suggests that on a gold electrode in sulfuric acid solution containing Ru-red, one electron oxidative conversion of Ru-red to a higher oxidation state ruthenium compound, Ru-brown, occurs at ca. 0.74V (vs NHE), as supported by the electrochemical in situ SERS experiments. Moreover, at higher potentials and on Au disk, the Ru-red / Ru-brown are not stable and slowly decompose or electro-oxidize leading to deactivation of the tri-ruthenium catalytic system in acidic medium.

The following results were obtained: (a) Replacement of Ser-264 in D1 by Ala (mutant Dil) or Gly (mutant G264) resulting in DCMU and atrazine resistance leads to a downshift of the thermoluminescence (TL) B-band peak temperature from 40-degrees-C in wild-type thylakoids to about 30-degrees-C. In dark adapted samples of both mutants the TL and oxygen yield pattern induced by a train of single turnover flashes were strongly damped indicative of a high miss factor. (b) In contrast to Ser-264 mutants, replacement of Phe-255 in Dl by Tyr (mutant Tyr5) induced strong resistance to atrazine but not to DCMU and did not affect the peak temperature of the B-band and the flash-induced TL and oxygen yield patterns. In this respect mutant Tyr5 resembles the wild type. (c) No significant differences have been found between strains with single site mutations in psbAI and normal psbAII/psbAIII genes, and strains with same mutations in psbAI but additional deletion of psbAII and psbAIII. Obviously in strains were psbAI is present, PS II complexes containing gene products of psbAII and psbAIII are not assembled in detectable amounts. (d) Strains with double mutations at positions 264 and 255 display a downshift of the B-band peak temperature. Their oscillatory patterns of B-band intensity and oxygen yield are highly damped. This behaviour is similiar to strains D1 and G264 which are modified at position 264 only. We extend reports on additivity of mutation effects on herbicide binding to binding of Q(B). (e) Mutations at the Q(B) Site not only influence the binding Of Q(B) and herbicides but also change the thermoluminescence quantum yield and the lifetimes of the redox states S2 and S3 of the water oxidase. This finding might indicate long ranging effects on Photosystem II exerted by structural modifications of the Q(B) site. From these data we conclude that Ser-264 is essential for binding of atrazine, DCMU and Q(B), whereas Phe-255 is involved in atrazine binding and its substitution by Tyr does not markedly affect Q(B) or DCMU binding in Synechococcus PCC7942.									18	0	0	0	16	0	18			0006-3002			WOS:A1992KB90800002	1445937

However, no comparative studies have established suitable reference genes for quantitative PCR (qPCR) in elasmobranchs for any physiological conditions. Oxygen availability has been a major force shaping the physiological evolution of vertebrates, especially fishes. Here we examined the suitability of 9 reference candidates from various functional categories after a single hypoxic insult or after hypoxia preconditioning in epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum).Results: Epaulette sharks were caught and exposed to hypoxia. Tissues were collected from 10 controls, 10 individuals with single hypoxic insult and 10 individuals with hypoxia preconditioning (8 hypoxic insults, 12 hours apart). We produced sequence information for reference gene candidates and monitored mRNA expression levels in four tissues: cerebellum, heart, gill and eye. The stability of the genes was examined with analysis of variance, geNorm and NormFinder. The best ranking genes in our study were eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 beta (eef1b), ubiquitin (ubq) and polymerase (RNA) II (DNA directed) polypeptide F (polr2f). The performance of the ribosomal protein L6 (rpl6) was tissue-dependent. Notably, in one tissue the analysis of variance indicated statistically significant differences between treatments for genes that were ranked as the most stable candidates by reference gene software.Conclusions: Our results indicate that eef1b and ubq are generally the most suitable reference genes for the conditions and tissues in the present epaulette shark studies. These genes could also be potential reference gene candidates for other physiological studies examining stress in elasmobranchs. The results emphasise the importance of inter-group variation in reference gene evaluation.									15	0	0	0	13	0	15			1471-2199			WOS:000277289200001	20416043	
J	Wang, Kai; Hu, Lihong; Deng, Jun; Zhang, Yanni								Multiscale thermal behavioral characterization of spontaneous combustion of pre-oxidized coal with different air exposure time								ENERGY				262						125397	10.1016/j.energy.2022.125397				JAN 1 2023	2023	To comprehensively investigate the multi-scale characteristics of coal spontaneous combustion, in situ infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were utilized. The samples were pre-oxidized at 70 ?C for 2, 4, 6, and 8 h (the raw coal and above samples were named R-0, R-2, R-4, R-6, and R8), then the secondary oxidation experiments were carried out. The results showed that the contents of -OH, -C=O, and -C=C -increased with the pre-oxidation time. The aromatic structure of pre-oxidized coal is more susceptible to oxygen erosion during secondary oxidation. The migration and transformation of -OH, -C=O are the underlying causes of water evaporation and gas desorption during low-temperature oxidation. The spontaneous combustion be-haviors in stage I and stage II have different reaction mechanisms and kinetic characteristics. In light of Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), the apparent activation energy of stage I is R-0 > R-2 > R-4 > R-6 > R-8, and stage II is R-6 > R-8 > R-2 > R-4 > R-0. Long pre-oxidation time in stage I will inhibit coal spontaneous combustion, while the opposite is true in stage II. By the Pearson correlation analysis, -OH is the key structure affecting the low-temperature endothermic stage of coal, revealing the correlation between the multi -scale thermal behavior of pre-oxidized coal spontaneous combustion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0360-5442	1873-6785		WOS:000860629200002

The cocrystallization treatment effectively reinforces the bonding between membrane and catalyst layers, and increases the hydrophobicity of the catalyst layers. The SPE water electrolyser with the cocrystallized CCM decreased cell voltage by 0.09 V at 2000 mA cm(-2) at 80 degrees C and improved the stability in comparison with the conventional CCM.

In order to achieve maximal accuracy, our simulations include the full interface between the semiconductor surface and liquid water. Certain oxide contaminants are found to have a dramatic impact on the surface reactivity, pointing to the importance of surface oxide and hydroxide intermediates in facilitating the water-dissociation component of the hydrogen evolution process. Our results are used to relate the chemical activity of the surface towards water dissociation to the oxygen bond topology. The importance of the liquid hydrogen-bond network near the interface is discussed, particularly in relation to the generation of local configurations favorable for dissociative water adsorption on InP(001).

J	Lvov, BV; Novichikhin, AV								Quantitative interpretation of the evaporation coefficients for the decomposition or sublimation of some substances in vacuo								THERMOCHIMICA ACTA				290	2			239	251		10.1016/S0040-6031(96)03100-0				MAR 2 1997	1997	An attempt is made at a quantitative interpretation of the low evaporation coefficients alpha (10(-7)-10(-1)) observed under thermal decomposition of 12 different compounds (AgNO3, BaSO4, BaCO3, BN, Be3N2, Mg3N2, AlN, GaN, ZnO, CdS, CdSe and NH4Cl) in vacuo under the conditions of free-surface evaporation after Langmuir. It is suggested that the main reason for the low evaporation coefficients lies in the difference between the true scheme of thermal decomposition of a given compound and in assuming its direct decomposition to the products corresponding to thermodynamic equilibrium. These differences consist, firstly, in a primary gasification of all decomposition products, including low-volatile components (metals and metal oxides) and, secondly, in a partial or total evolution of nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, selenium and hydrogen chloride in the form of free atoms or H + Cl mixture rather than of molecules. The interpretation of the evaporation coefficients a for elemental red phosphorus, arsenic and antimony is based on the assumption that the sublimation of these substances occurs, accordingly, through a primary formation of P-2 molecules, or of As-2 + As-4 and Sb-2 + Sb-4 mixtures, rather than by direct formation of the P4, As-4, or Sb-4 molecules corresponding to thermodynamic equilibrium, as is generally accepted. The proposed mechanisms of decomposition or sublimation are validated by a comparison of the experimental and calculated activation energies.

LDH-based electrochemical sensors are affordable alternatives to traditional precious-metal-based sensors, as LDHs can be synthesized from abundant inorganic precursors. LDH-modified probes can directly catalyze or host catalytic compounds that facilitate analyte redox reactions, detected as changes in the probe's current, voltage, or resistance. The porous and lamellar structure of LDHs allows rapid analyte diffusion and abundant active sites for enhanced sensor sensitivity. LDHs can be composed of conductive materials such as reduced graphene oxide (rGO) or metal nanoparticles for improved catalytic activity and analyte selectivity. As optical sensors, LDHs provide a spacious, stable structure for synergistic guest-host interactions. LDHs can immobilize fluorophores, chemiluminescence reactants, and other spectroscopically active materials to reduce the aggregation and dissolution of the embedded sensor molecules, yielding enhanced optical responses and increased probe reusability. This review discusses standard LDH synthesis methods and overviews the different electrochemical and optical analysis techniques. Furthermore, the designs and modifications of exemplary LDHs and LDH composite materials are analyzed, focusing on the analytical performance of LDH-based sensors for key biomarkers and pollutants, including glucose, dopamine (DA), H2O2, metal ions, nitrogen-based toxins, and other organic compounds.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3				2079-4991		WOS:000724807500001	34835574

In continuation of the efforts being devoted for effective consumption of iridium, on employing two step facile hydrothermal synthesis, we present a highly effective approach for its best utilization. Anchoring of tiny IrO2 nanoparticles on the surface of well-aligned one-dimensional substrate (Co304), at an expense of atomically just 6-7% of iridium in relative to cobalt, showed superb durability in an acidic environment. A durable 20-fold enhanced mass specific activity was observed for the best mixed composite relative to that of IrO2. Moreover, compared to iridium dioxide's Tafel slope of 68.2 mV dec(-1) and onset potential of 1.48 V, a quite steeper Tafel slope of 51.2 mV dec(-1) and an improvement of 30 mV in onset potential were observed. This outstanding performance is believed to be the synergistic effect of metal cations on account of their electronic modulations as revealed from XPS analysis and due to the experimentally verified importance of one-dimensional nano-rod-shaped assembling of substrate particles. The adopted approach in the current study provides the most effective route for cutting down extensive iridium utilization via synergistic coupling with a nonprecious transition metal, which is vital for the current electrochemical conversion technologies.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2574-0962			WOS:000458706700070

However, SNPC prepared by one-pot method usually features the drawback of low S-content and thereby weakens the synergistic effect both geometrically and electronically. Herein, we reported one facile synthetic approach to prepare high S-content SNPC. In this regard, the introduction of NaH2PO4 into the pyrolysis of S, N-containing precursor is beneficial to confine S atoms in carbon framework. It is found that S-content is 25.05% for SNPPC-700, 12.58% for SNPPC-800, higher than previously reported results. Structural characterizations indicate that NaH2PO4 salt plays an important role. Furthermore, LIBs test shows high S-content SNPPC800 features the higher capacities of 977.68 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles than those of low S-content SNPC800 at 100 mA g(-1). Moreover, ORR activity measurements show a slight better performance and cycling durability than low S-content SNPC. In addition, the SNPPC-800 also reveals excellent supercapacitor performance with an specific capacitance of 227.5 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1), and kept 160.29 F g(-1) via the measurement of 6000 cycles at 10 A g(-1).

Laboratory studies of the oxidation of individual, high-flux SOA precursors do not lead to particles with mass spectra (MS) matching those of ambient aged organic material. Additionally, the complexity of real organic particles challenges efforts to identify their chemical origins. We have previously hypothesized that SOA can form from the atmospheric oxidation of a large suite of precursors with varying vapor pressures. Here, we support this hypothesis by using an aerosol mass spectrometer to track the chemical evolution of diesel exhaust as it is photochemically oxidized in an environmental chamber. With explicit knowledge of the condensed-phase MS of the primary emissions from our engine, we are able to decompose each recorded MS into contributing primary and secondary spectra throughout the experiment. We find that the SOA becomes increasingly oxidized as a function of time, quickly approaching a final MS that closely resembles that of ambient aged organic particulate matter. This observation is consistent with our hypothesis of an evolving suite of SOA precursors. Low vapor pressure, semi-volatile organic emissions can form condensable products with even a single generation of oxidation, resulting in an early-arising, relatively less-oxidized SOA. Continued gas-phase oxidation can form highly oxidized SOA in surprisingly young air masses via reaction mechanisms that can add multiple oxygen atoms per generation and result in products with sustained or increased reactivity toward OH.									70	1	0	0	26	0	71			1680-7316	1680-7324		WOS:000253908600003

The deposits consist of ferromanganese carbonate-silicate orebodies (Fe-rhodochrosite, Mn-amphibole, spessartine, stilpnomelane, rhodonite, pyroxmangite and tephroite), occurring within larger and lower-grade mineralized areas. Although hosted by organic matter-rich cherts (C-org=1-1.5%), the ore is devoid of organic matter. The delta(13)C(carbonate) values are from -3.5parts per thousand to - 15.7parts per thousand (PDB) in the carbonate ore and -1.7parts per thousand to +0.9parts per thousand in the neighboring carbonate schists, while the hosting organic matter-rich cherts exhibit delta(13)C(org) values from -22.7parts per thousand to -27.8parts per thousand (PDB). The ore shows positive Ce and negative Eu anomalies on chondrite-normalized plots. The manganese was supplied by both terrigenous and igneous sources stored in oxygen-deficient bottom water of a back-arc basin and precipitated as Mn carbonate and oxide.The metamorphism of ECMD is polyphase with contrasting tendencies. The formation of silicate minerals by decarbonation reactions was followed by the extensive replacement of silicate phases by Mn carbonate and, locally, by iron sulfide, as a result of reducing fluids circulation.

In this work, porous spinel ZnCo2O4 nanosheets (NSs) were synthesized via a hydrothermal method and followed by the thermal treatment. Structural characterizations indicate that the porous NSs are composed of similar to 14nm interconnected ZnCo2O4 nanoparticles. The porous spinel ZnCo2O4 NSs exhibit enhanced H2S sensing performance in comparison to Co3O4 NSs. The detection limit of the porous ZnCo2O4 NSs is down to 100ppb H2S with a sensor response value of 1.32 even at relatively low operating temperature of 120 degrees C. Furthermore, the porous ZnCo2O4 NSs have fascinating selectivity and good long-term stability and relatively rapid response time. The gas sensing mechanism of the ZnCo2O4 NSs gas sensor is also discussed in terms of the effects of oxygen vacancies.

To get more insight into the mechanism of this curious enzyme reaction, nonheme structural and functional models were carried out by the use of mononuclear iron, [Fe-II(CDA-BPA*)](2+) (6) [CDA-BPA = N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)-cyclohexanediamine], [Fe-II(CDA-BQA*)](2+) (5) [CDA-BQA = N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(2-quinolilmethyl)-cyclohexanediamine], [Fe-II(Bn-TPEN)(CH3CN)](2+) (3) [Bn-TPEN = N-benzyl-N,N',N'-tris(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,2-diaminoethane], [Fe-IV(O)(Bn-TPEN)](2+) (9), and manganese, [Mn-II(N4Py*)(CH3CN)](2+) (2) [N4Py* = N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,2-di(2-pyridyl)ethylamine)], [Mn-II(Bn-TPEN)(CH3CN)](2+) (4) complexes as catalysts, where the possible reactive intermediates, high-valent Fe-IV(O) and Mn-IV(O) are known and well characterised. The results of the catalytic and stoichiometric reactions showed that the ligand framework and the nature of the metal cofactor significantly influenced the reactivity of the catalyst and its intermediate. Comparing the reactions of [Fe-IV(O)(Bn-TPEN)](2+) (9) and [Mn-IV(O)(Bn-TPEN)](2+) (10) towards flavanone under the same conditions, a 3.5-fold difference in reaction rate was observed in favor of iron, and this value is three orders of magnitude higher than was observed for the previously published [Fe-IV(O)(N2Py2Q*)](2+) [N,N-bis(2-quinolylmethyl)-1,2-di(2-pyridyl)ethylamine] species.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1420-3049		WOS:000660426900001	34072092

These samples were further subjected to various material characterization techniques in order to evaluate their physio-chemical properties. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed large chunks of aggregated nanoparticles with minute voids. The EDX-derived atomic composition deviated from the nominal composition suggesting the occurrence of multiple phases. In addition, transmission electron microscope (TEM) images revealed that the samples exhibit uneven spherical shape with a high degree of aggregation. The Fourier transformed-infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the synthesized samples show vibrations of the BO6 octahedral indicating the presence of Ni-O bonds. In addition, metal-carboxyl vibrations were identified from the peaks at 1400 and 860 cm(-1). Optical diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) showed certain peaks originating from the O2- (2p)-> Ni2+ (3d) charge transfer. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analysis revealed the existence of multiple phases for the samples CeNiO3, BaNiO3, and La(Ce, Ba)NiO3. Moreover, La(Ce, Ba)NiO3 contained four phases showing that the co-substitution of Ba2+ and Ce3+ into LaNiO3 may require more sophisticated methodologies. The sample BaNiO3 showed maximum weight loss, due to the existence of carbonate phase. The dielectric properties decreased with increasing frequency, while the ac electrical conductivity enhanced with increasing frequencies obeying the Maxwell-Wagner two-layer model in accordance with Koop's phenomenological theory.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1557-1939	1557-1947		WOS:000784086300003

It describes the evolution of a complex chemical system with acceptable accuracy with a number of rate controlling constraints on the associated constrained-equilibrium states of the system, much lower than the number of species in the underlying Detailed Kinetic Model (DKM). Successful approximation of the constrained equilibrium states requires accurate identification of the constraints. One promising procedure is the fully automatable Approximate Singular Value Decomposition of the Actual Degrees of Disequilibrium (ASVDADD) method that is capable of identifying the best constraints for a given range of thermodynamic conditions and a required level of approximation. ASVDADD is based on simple algebraic analysis of the results of the underlying DKM simulation and is focused on the behavior of the degrees of disequilibrium (DoD) of the individual chemical reactions. In this paper, we propose a method, as part of our work in-progress efforts, that could expand the applicability of the derived constraints. This method involves running DKM calculations for a wider range of initial conditions, appending the results of all these cases one after the other after normalizing, and finally running the ASVDADD method to get a set of 'universal' constraints applicable within that range of conditions. The effectiveness and robustness of the derived constraints is examined in hydrogen/oxygen ignition delay simulations and the results are compared with those obtained from DKM. The proof-of-concept results demonstrate the potential of the method for finding 'universal' constraints.

Wood samples with various sizes (i.e. sawdust with particle size < 1 mm and wood cylinders with a diameter of 8 mm) were pyrolyzed under an argon atmosphere to produce char samples using a thermobalance. The final pyrolysis temperature was 1173 K and the heating rate was set to 1 or 30 K/s. Then, the reactivity of char samples was measured using an isothermal method at various gasification temperatures from 673 to 1173 K under an oxygen/argon atmosphere. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray computed tomography (CT) were used to observe the char morphology. Quantitative measurements of pore size and shape were made using the digital image analysis. As for the pyrolysis, the effect of intraparticle secondary reactions of tar became significant for the large wood cylinder, resulting in the decrease of tar yield and the increase of char yield. Heating rate during the pyrolysis influenced the pore structure, the radial shrinkage and swelling of the wood cylinder. As for the char gasification, the char reactivity was significantly decreased with increasing cylinder length in the diffusion-controlled zone. In addition, it was found that the char gasification mainly progressed in the direction of pores when the gasification rate was controlled by the diffusion process, indicating the anisotropic evolution of particle shape during the gasification.

J	Corella, J; Caballero, MA; Aznar, MP; Brage, C								Two advanced models for the kinetics of the variation of the tar composition in its catalytic elimination in biomass gasification								INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH				42	13			3001	3011		10.1021/ie020401i				JUN 25 2003	2003	Biomass gasification in fluidized beds generates tar that can be effectively eliminated with catalysts located downstream from the biomass gasifier. Some previously obtained results from such catalytic tar elimination were hard to be understood because the tar was considered as only one or two lumps. For this reason, in this work, tar is considered in two ways: (i) as being composed of six different lumps and (ii) as a continuous mixture. For these studies, tar was sampled before and after two catalytic beds located in a slip-flow downstream from a fluidized-bed gasifier (pilot scale). Such tar samples were then completely characterized, and the tar composition was thus determined before and after the catalytic bed. The conversion of each of the species present in tar, and thus of the lumps, was calculated at different temperatures and space-times in the catalytic reactor. The two most advanced reaction networks and their corresponding kinetic models are presented here. The first one provides the evolution with gas residence time of the mean molecular weight of the tar and of the variance of the tar molecular weight distribution. The second kinetic model is based on a set of six kinetic equations and eleven kinetic constants, which are calculated here. This second model allows the species present in tar to be ranked according to their reactivity or resistance to being destroyed. Predictions from these models are consistent with all existing data on this matter.									74	0	0	0	7	0	74			0888-5885			WOS:000183766900015

Aluminum in an Al-air battery (AAB) is attractive due to its light weight, wide availability at low cost, and safety. Electrochemical equivalence of aluminum allows for higher charge transfer per ion compared to lithium and other monovalent ions. However, significant challenges have impeded progress towards commercialization, including formation of an aluminum hydroxide surface barrier, high aluminum corrosion rate, and self-discharge susceptibility. Addition of alloying elements is a widely used technique for mitigating these problems in aqueous electrolytes. A number of alloying elements have been evaluated, with typical characteristics such as higher nobility than aluminum, and high overpotential for hydrogen evolution. Over time, a large number of studies have examined alloys across a broad landscape of components and composition in aqueous and ionic liquid electrolytes. This manuscript first takes a broader look at metal-air battery performance before focusing on a summary of data and electrochemical performance for aluminum and aluminum alloys of indium, tin, and/or gallium, and surveys proposed mechanisms driving surface chemistry in alkaline electrolytes on aluminum alloy anodes comprising these materials. AAB performance of ionic liquid and solid-state electrolytes with aluminum anodes is also considered, as results to date support the idea that these designs have the potential to minimize corrosion and enable secondary capability for applications requiring rechargeability.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000652655900004

As-sintered AlxCu(100-x) (x = 60, 67 and 85 at%) alloy bulks that were prepared using cold-press sintering were dealloyed in 20 wt% NaOH solution under free corrosion conditions. In addition, Al67Cu33 was studied in detail to study the effects of sintering parameters on precursors and products. The XRD and SEM results suggest that a higher temperature and long duration are beneficial to promote atom diffusion and the formation of a single Al2Cu phase and tailored Cu, Cu2O and CuO with various morphologies were obtained after dealloying. During dealloying, the Al2Cu phase could be fully corroded, whereas the AlCu phase obtained from a higher sintering temperature remains after dealloying. Electrochemical studies show that the critical corrosion potential (E-crit) of the as-sintered alloys, pure Al and pure Cu, are extremely close to the free corrosion potential (E-corr), the intersection point of potentiodynamic cathodic and anodic polarization curves. Cyclic voltammetry results imply that the formation of oxides may be related to the reaction of dissolved oxygen and copper ions. A group of recommended parameters was identified: a pressure of 312.5 MPa, sintering temperature of 500 degrees C and holding time of 60 min, from which a mixture of Cu/Cu2O/CuO could be obtained which exhibits an excellent initial (10 min) degradation efficiency of 77.4% to methyl orange when exposed in an ultrasonic environment in ambient atmosphere.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2046-2069		WOS:000361120000007

International journal of biomedical science : IJBS				4	3			204	11						2008-Sep	2008	Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) is thought to generate reactive oxygen species associated with a systemic inflammation and neurotrophins seem to be involved in cardiovascular inflammatory reactions. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of CPB on plasma neurotrophins levels and to appreciate the links existing between inflammation, oxidative stress and neurotrophins. Blood samples were taken from 27 patients undergoing cardiac surgery: before CPB, during ischemia and at reperfusion under CPB. Oxidative stress was evaluated using an Electron Spin Resonance technique by superoxide detection, and antioxidant defences by measurement of Endogenous Peroxidase Activity (EPA). The evolution of two neurotrophins: Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) was assessed with an ELISA method. An inflammatory index was determined by a multiplex flow cytometry method. The inflammatory index showed that MCP-1, P-selectin, t-PA and interleukins 6, 8 and 10 levels increased during CPB (p<0.05). Superoxide production and EPA were higher during ischemia and reperfusion than before CPB (p<0.05). BDNF plasma levels were higher at reperfusion (p<0.05). NGF levels did not change. Our study shows an increase of BDNF levels, associated with an inflammatory phenomenon and a redox modification, in the plasma of patients undergoing cardiac surgery under CPB. The role played by this neurotrophin in this complex situation still needs to be elucidated, in particular its cellular origin. It is also necessary to understand whether BDNF has a beneficial or deleterious effect during CPB.									11	0	0	0	5	0	11			1550-9702			MEDLINE:23675091	23675091

All these proteins are expressed, but seven of these differ from the gene predictions in Wormbase. The entire polypeptide sequences for 31 genes and the core globin domain of four proteins were confirmed or corrected. All core globin domains were aligned manually following a procedure that was designed to fit the putative sequences to the crystal structure based alignment of 56 known globin crystal structures. Neighbor-joining analysis of the resulting alignment showed that the majority of these globins are very divergent from each other, possibly suggesting a long evolutionary divergence. The surprisingly high number and low sequence conservation of putative globins in this small organism urges a detailed functional analysis.

The excitation and abundances of the atoms and molecules are sensitive to the changing physical conditions during star-formation. In the cold outer envelopes around YSOs, interstellar ices contain a significant fraction of the heavy element abundances, in particular oxygen. Different ice phases can be distinguished, and evidence is found for heating and segregation of the ices in more evolved objects. The inner warm envelopes around YSOs are probed through absorption and emission of gas-phase molecules, including CO, CO2, CH4 and H2O. An overview of the wealth of observations on gas-phase H2O in star-forming regions is presented. Gas/solid ratios are determined, which provide information on the importance of gas-grain chemistry and high temperature gas-phase reactions. The line ratios of molecules such as H-2, CO and H2O are powerful probes to constrain the physical parameters of the gas. Together with atomic and ionic lines such as [O I] 63 mu m, [S I] 25 mu m and [Si II] 35 mu m, they can also be used to distinguish between photon- and shock-heated gas. Finally, spectroscopic data on circumstellar disks around young stars are mentioned. The results are discussed in the context of the physical and chemical evolution of YSOs.

However, these anionic redox reactions in transition metal oxide-based cathodes attained by taking excess lithium ions have resulted in stability issues due to weak metal-oxygen ligand covalency. Here, we present an alternative approach of improving metal-ligand covalency by introducing a less electronegative chalcogen ligand (sulfur) in the cathode structural framework where the metal d band penetrates into the ligand p band, thereby utilizing reversible mixed anionic and cationic redox chemistry. Through this design strategy, we report the possibility of developing a new family of layered cathode materials when partially filled d orbital redox couples like Fe2+/3+ are introduced in the Li-ion conducting phase (Li2SnS3). Further, the electron energy loss spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near-edge structure analyses are used to qualitatively identify the charge contributors at the metal and ligand sites during Li+ extraction. The detailed high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and high annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy investigations reveal the multi-redox induced structural modifications and its surface amorphization with nanopore formation during cycling. Findings from this study will shed light on designing Ni and Co free chalcogen cathodes and various functional materials in the chalcogen-based dual anionic and cationic redox cathode avenue.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000703999100027	34524818

This is often the case for imperfect, disordered and amorphous nanoparticles, where even the nomenclature can be unspecific. Disordered platinum nanoparticles have exhibited superior performance for some reactions, which makes a systematic way of describing them highly desirable. In this study we have used a diverse set of disorder platinum nanoparticles and machine learning to identify the pure and representative structures based on their similarity in 121 dimensions. We identify two prototypes that are representative of separable classes, and seven archetypes that are the pure structures on the convex hull with which all other possibilities can be described. Together these nine nanoparticles can explain all of the variance in the set, and can be described as either single crystal, twinned, spherical or branched; with or without roughened surfaces. This forms a robust sub-set of platinum nanoparticle upon which to base further work, and provides a theoretical basis for discussing structure/property relationships of platinum nanoparticles that are not geometrically ideal.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000597137800001	33212430

In this paper, Indonesia long flame coal was hydromodified in subcritical H_2O-CO systems and the pyrolysis characteristics of different modified coals at different tempratures were investigated. Moreover, soxhlet extraction technology coupled with thermogravimetric (TG-DTG) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis methods were used to investigate the effect of structural evolution of modified coal on the distribution of pyrolysis products. The results indicate that, the caking property of the long flame coal was significantly improved after modification in the subcritical H_2O-CO system, and the caking index (GRI) of the modified coal increased with the reaction temperature and reached the maximum at 340 ℃. The increase in the hydrogen content of the modified coal and the yield of soxhlet extraction soluble components increased the yield of modified coal pyrolysis tar while the yield of pyrolysis gas decreased. At the same time, the modification reduced the oxygen content of the modified coal, which led to a decrease of the yield of pyrolysis water. In addition, the increase of the asphaltene component in the modified coal would inhibit its rapid pyrolysis weight loss. After modification, stretching vibration absorption peaks of the aliphatic -CH, -CH_2 and -CH_3 increased, resulting in higher volume fraction of CH_4 and H2 in the pyrolysis gas of modified coal than that of the raw coal.			长焰煤通过加氢改性转化为黏结性煤,有利于提高其综合利用效益和扩大炼焦煤资源。利用亚临界H_2O-CO体系对印尼长焰煤进行改性,考察了不同反应温度下改性煤的热解特性,并利用索氏抽提、热重(TG-DTG)和傅里叶变换红外光谱(FTIR)探究了煤结构变化对其热解产物分布规律的影响。结果表明:长焰煤在亚临界H_2O-CO体系中改性后黏结性显著提高,获得的改性煤黏结指数(GRI)随反应温度升高至340 ℃而达到最大值;改性煤中氢含量和索氏抽提可溶组分收率的提高,使得改性煤热解焦油产率升高而热解气产率降低,同时改性降低了煤中氧含量,导致热解水产率降低;改性煤中沥青烯组分提高,将抑制其快速热解失重,而改性处理后脂肪族-CH、-CH_2和-CH_3伸缩振动吸收峰增强,导致改性煤热解气H2和CH_4体积分数均高于原煤。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1002-3364			CSCD:7110701

Herein, tunable holes and vacancies in nickel hydroxide (h-Ni(OH)(2)) by the Ostwald ripening process are successfully fabricated, and the as-prepared electrocatalysts are used for the selective ECO of alcohols into acids or aldehydes with excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability, where a selectivity above 92% to benzoic acid with a benzyl alcohol conversion of 99% on 1.0 h-Ni(OH)(2) was obtained, while a selectivity of >94% to benzaldehyde with a conversion of >90% could also be achieved once the 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO) radical was employed. A paired electrolysis system is employed using 1.0 h-Ni(OH)(2) and 1.0 PtO2/h-Ni(OH)(2) as electrocatalysts at the anode and cathode, respectively, to simultaneously achieve the selective ECO of benzyl alcohol and H2 production, resulting in a high faradaic efficiency of 192.9%. The excellent ECO activity is mainly due to the abundance of holes and vacancies which facilitate the diffusion rate of the reaction species, adjust the electronic structure and surface properties of h-Ni(OH)(2), and change the charge density around benzyl alcohol, thereby enhancing the adsorption energy of the alcohol. This study introduces a new avenue for the understanding and future design of advanced defect-based electrocatalysts for electrosynthesis and energy conversion.									33	3	0	0	4	0	35			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000457794700015

We employ analytical transmission electron microscopy (ATEM) as a tool for combined microstructural and microchemical analysis and compare the results to Rutherford backscattering (RBS) analysis. Given the high spatial resolution of the method, we focus on microstructural changes of the thin-film diffusant source during the diffusion anneal. We evaluate the potential influence of the associated changes in its transport properties on the evolution of concentration profiles in the single crystal substrate. This approach allows us to test the reliability of determination of volume diffusion coefficients from thin-film diffusion experiments. We found that for the chosen experimental setting, the influence of thin-film re-crystallization is small when compared with the experimental uncertainty and good estimates for the volume diffusion coefficients of Yb in YAG can be obtained using standard assumptions. Both Yb-concentration profiles analyzed with ATEM and with RBS give similar results. At 1,450A degrees C and 1 bar, we infer log D (Yb) (m(2)/s) values of -19.37 +/- A 0.07 (TEM) and -19.84 +/- A 0.02 (RBS). Although the change in thin-film transport properties associated with successive crystallization during the diffusion anneal does not play a major role for our experimental setup, this effect cannot generally be ignored.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0342-1791	1432-2021		WOS:000284596100006

Temperature-programmed desorption was also studied to provide a better understanding of the carbon oxidation process. Both CO and CO2 are primary products during carbon oxidation but are generated via different mechanisms. CO formation is believed to involve a wide range of activation energies due to the complex structure of carbon. The rate of CO formation was found to be of fractional order with respect to the O2 partial pressure, and to be insensitive to Ca catalysis. It is postulated that CO2 is formed at sites which are different from the CO sites. The number of CO2 sites is very small for the uncatalyzed carbon and is increased by Ca addition. The rate of CO2 formation was found to be first order with respect to the O2 partial pressure and can be effectively catalyzed by Ca. The CO/CO2 ratio decreases from near unity for noncatalytic carbon oxidation to approximately 0.01 for catalytic carbon oxidation at 663 K. A carbon oxidation model was formulated which quantitatively describes the experimental results for both catalyzed and uncatalyzed carbons and leads to the following conclusions: (1) The controlling factor for a noncatalytic carbon oxidation is the carbon structure which may be appropriately represented by the site energy distribution of that carbon. (2) The controlling factor for a Ca-catalyzed carbon oxidation is the Ca dispersion on the carbon surface. The CO/CO2 ratio provides a measure of the importance of catalysis in the oxidation.									135	3	0	0	6	0	139			0887-0624			WOS:A1991EV50100035

Photovoltaic cells now hold the highest potential for widespread sustainable electricity production and photo(electro)catalytic cells could supply various chemicals. However, both of them require the connection of energy storage devices or matter to compensate for intermittent sunlight, suffering from complicated structures and external energy loss. Newly developed photoelectrochemical energy storage (PES) devices can effectively convert and store solar energy in one two-electrode battery, simplifying the configuration and decreasing the external energy loss. Based on PES materials, the PES devices could realize direct solar-to-electrochemical energy storage, which is fundamentally different from photo(electro)catalytic cells (solar-to-chemical energy conversion) and photovoltaic cells (solar-to-electricity energy conversion). This review summarizes a critically selected overview of advanced PES materials, the key to direct solar to electrochemical energy storage technology, with the focus on the research progress in PES processes and design principles. Based on the specific discussions of the performance metrics, the bottlenecks of PES devices, including low efficiency and deteriorative stability, are also discussed. Finally, several perspectives of potential strategies to overcome the bottlenecks and realize practical photoelectrochemical energy storage devices are presented.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000754005400001	35137737

Herein, we synthesized and explored a CoxCd1-xS/NiyFe1-y-LDH composite photoanode composed of a CoxCd1-xS solid solution and a NiyFe1-y-LDH cocatalyst. Compared with the pristine CdS film, the synthesized Co0.30Cd0.70S/Ni0.50Fe0.50-LDH composite film has optimum PEC activity and photostability in the process of water oxidation due to the synergism of the solid solution and the cocatalyst. First, the Co0.30Cd0.70S solid solution doped with an appropriate amount of Co2+ can not only effectively absorb photons but also maximize the utilization of photons, thereby improving the PEC performance. Second, Ni0.50Fe0.50-LDH in the outer layer of the Co0.30Cd0.70S/Ni0.50Fe0.50-LDH photoanode promotes the reaction kinetics of surface oxygen production of Co0.30Cd0.70S, which further improves the carrier density and the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. Meanwhile, the Ni0.50Fe0.50-LDH cocatalyst quickly captures and transports photogenerated holes to promote the photocorrosion resistance of Co0.30Cd0.70S. This study provides a path to synthesize the highly efficient and stable CdS-based photoanode by the synergistic use of a solid solution and a cocatalyst for PEC water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000678382900089

The potentiodynamic anodic polarization curve in 0.1 M citrate solution exhibits four anodic peaks A1, A2, A3 and A4 prior to the oxygen evolution reaction. Addition of Cl- ions to the solution enhances the four peaks currents, specially A3, which is followed by pitting corrosion. The negative going scans of the cyclic voltammograms show two anodic reactivation peaks A5 and A6 and one cathodic plateau P1. A diffusion controlled process in the potential range of A1, A2 and P1 was detected by RDE experiments. The potentiostatic current time transients, at different concentrations of NaCl and applied potentials E-a > A3, were studied. The pit nucleation rate (t(i)(-1)) is found to increase with increasing the concentration of NaCl and the applied anodic potential. The impedance spectra exhibit four different behaviours depending on the potential range used. They were fitted with a single time constant circuit at E-a < -700 mV. However, at -700 mV < E-a < -480 mV, they were fitted with a circuit with two time constants. At E-a > -480 mV, the second semicircle is replaced by negative polarization resistance which is disappeared at E-a > -300 mV. The electrode impedance was found to decrease with the applied potential. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									65	7	0	0	1	0	71			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000233226100017

Heterogeneous catalysts play a key role in the conversion of renewable resources into fuels and chemicals. The performance of heterogeneous catalysts is directly linked to their surface area, since the number of catalytic sites as well as the activity of each catalytic site increase with increasing effective footprint area of a catalyst. Therefore, nanoporous heterogeneous catalysts are very attractive, owing to their high internal surface areas and high density of active sites generated by curved internal surfaces. The overall catalytic performance of nanoporous heterogeneous catalysts can reach orders of magnitude higher than that of planar catalysts counterparts. This paper reviews recent progress toward the applicability of three-dimensional bulk nanoporous metals and their composites in (electro-)catalytic conversion of renewable resources into fuels and value-added chemicals. The primary focus is given to metal-based materials fabricated through dealloying. Dealloyed nanoporous metals and their composites can be used either directly as high-performance (electro-)catalysts, or indirectly as three-dimensional bulk current collectors along with poorly conducting electro-catalyst materials. Limitations of these material systems such as cost, scalability, and long-term stability in-service are discussed.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			0257-8972			WOS:000436917300037

The synthesized materials were consequently characterised by various techniques. Nanocomposite heterogeneous catalysts, combining Cu and TiO2 with CNT, were utilized for the direct photocatalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol. A correlation between the presence of nano-metal and the variations in absorption was observed, especially in the UV-vis spectral range. This behaviour was explained by a strong interphase interaction among Cu, TiO2 and CNT. Benzene conversion and turnover was due to an improved adsorption. The selectivity towards phenol production was enhanced by supporting TiO2 with CNT and by impregnating copper, thereby suppressing the mineralisation of benzene and favouring the evolution of phenolic compounds. The synergy between TiO2 and CNT was also observed through a high rate and kinetics of benzene oxidation. The sequential interactions of the hydroxyl radicals (formed from water) with the ad-sorbed state of benzene on copper or titania surfaces led to an intensified catalysis, and in turn, phenol or hydroquinone product formation. A combination of high activity and stability made the prepared hierarchical catalysts potentially interesting for the photocatalysis applications in selective phenol synthesis.

The thorough photocatalytic cleaning procedure in humid helium prior to all measurements was conducted under continuous flow too and we were able to monitor the decrease of carbonaceous contaminant concentration. On addition of CO2 to the feed under illumination, an increase in CH4 concentration was observed, which clearly follows the increase in CO2 concentration in the reactor. It was also demonstrated that CH4 formation ceases as soon as the lamp is switched off, providing clear evidence that the formation of CH4 from CO2 is a photoinduced process. It was shown that higher CO2 concentration accelerated CH4 formation under steady-state conditions up to a certain optimum. Higher CO2 concentrations lead to a decrease in CH4 formation. This observation is tentatively assigned to a limited availability of photogenerated charge carriers at the TiO2 surface, or a lack of suitable catalytically active sites. Traces of O-2 in the reactor completely hinder CH4 formation, implying that the lack of concomitant oxygen evolution observed in previous measurements on TiO2 is likely beneficial for the overall process. This study represents a first step towards performing true steady-state kinetic studies of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.									41	0	0	0	3	0	41			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000395653600025

Despite the success of these materials, understanding the relationship of structure to function has been very challenging. It has been noted that many metal oxide water-oxidation catalysts function best in a proton-accepting electrolyte, such as a borate or phosphate buffer. However, these same electrolytes are known to significantly affect the metal oxide structures by imparting a level of "disorder" or "molecular nature" to the materials. The most well-known case is that of Nocera's Co-Pi catalyst (Pi: inorganic phosphorus). In this study, we have synthesised a series of "heterogenite-like" cobalt oxides with different levels of phosphate doping (0-9%P). Our synthetic method enables us to make "bulk materials", the structural properties of which ( as observed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy) mimic those observed directly on electrode surfaces. The changes made to the bulk phases were directly correlated with the reactivity for water-oxidation catalysis and the ability of the CoOx materials to act as sacrificial oxidants. The most disordered materials were most reactive for sacrificial oxidation but were less effective as water-oxidation catalysts. These results help us understand how disorder changes the thermodynamic stability of metal oxides and how this impacts on efficiency for water oxidation.									19	0	0	0	3	0	19			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000395587400021

The increase of the microwave power allows to decrease the substrate temperature during the process (150degC) with the formation of a dense silicon oxide layer. In the range of variation of the parameters studied (pressure, temperature, R (oxygen flow rate / silane flow rate)) little variations of the film characteristics (density, etch rate,...) are observed. However, the ERDA analysis shows that a low pressure (0.13 mbar) and a limitation of the deposition rate (R=160) allow to reduce the incorporation of impurities (H,C) in the oxide films. The FTIR spectra, systematically studied by the position, the full width at half-maximum and the area of the Si-O-Si band, enable to point out the composition and the morphology evolution of silicon oxide coatings and corroborate the previous results.									0	0	0		0	0	0			1155-4339			INSPEC:7149485

They display a series of reaction textures involving sapphirine, sillimanite, spinel, garnet and cordierite in addition to orthopyroxene, quartz and rutile. The peak conditions are represented by five assemblages characterized by quartz+orthopyroxene+rutile with the possible addition of spinel or sillimanite+sapphirine. Geothermometry and geobarometry show that the peak metamorphism conditions were T = 1000 degrees C and P = 10-11 kbar. As most of the minerals contain a significant amount of Fe3+ and Cr, the parageneses have been studied within the FMASTOCr (FeO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-TiO2-O-2-Cr2O3) system. Neither of the two simple systems FMAS nor FMASCr account for the observed phase relationships. The assemblages occurring in the rocks are also inconsistent with previous FMASTO grids. However, the observed chemical relationships are different from those used by former authors. In particular, the collinearity of sillimanite, sapphirine and I orthopyroxene lead to a different compatibility diagram. Therefore, we have investigated a new set of petrogenetic grids based on our own observations and valid for the FMASTO system with sapphirine, spinel, sillimanite, garnet, cordierite, magnetite, ilmenite and rutile in presence of quartz and orthopyroxene. The grids account for the parageneses observed in the Khanfous area (North In Ouzzal) and for most of the recorded high-temperature granulites.									18	2	0	0	0	0	18			0935-1221			WOS:A1996WB92300015

However, its ECL has to be triggered at high positive or negative voltage, leading to a series of undesired side effects containing electrical damage toward biomolecules and hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction. In this work, a new low-potential-triggered Ru(bpy)32+ ECL system was reported using oxalate as coreactant with the aid of platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) electrodeposited on the surface of the graphene-ionic liquid composite. When cyclic scanning in a potential range from 0.3 to -0.2 V, the ECL signal appeared at onset potential of 0.05 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), and reached the maximum at about -0.15 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), which were quite lower than that in the typical Ru(bpy)32+-oxalate (C2O4-) ECL system. The possible mechanism was discussed in detail. Meanwhile, the low-potential-triggered ECL signals were strong and stable, which were further exploited to detect the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The constructed ECL sensor exhibited a good linearity between the ECL signals and the logarithm of the concentrations of CEA in a range from 0.1 pg mL-1 to 100 ng mL-1 with the detection limit of 0.01 pg mL-1. In addition, the sensor showed a promising potential in clinical detection.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000682406300004

In recent years, the possibility of transforming some phenothiazines in their aryl diazonium salt derivatives has been proved, what allows them to be electrochemically reduced and electrografted onto conductive surfaces. This is a smart way to modify these surfaces and enable them with specific functionalities. In order to better comprehend the electrografting process and consequently have a higher control of it, in this work we have carried out an exhaustive study by operando UV-Vis spectroelectrochemistry of the electrografting of a phenothiazine aryl diazonium salt onto amide carbon nanodots. As a model of phenothiazine dye we have chosen Azure A. The electrografting onto carbon nanodots has been stablished by comparison with the results obtained on bare gold electrodes in this novel study. The presence of carbon dots improves the reversibility of the electrochemical process as derived from the results obtained by operando UV-Vis spectroelectrochemistry. In addition, to asses that the electrochemical process studied corresponds to the electrografting, the results have been compared to those obtained for the simple Azure A adsorption. This study shows the advantages of obtaining simultaneously the electrochemical and the spectroscopic evolution of an electron-transfer process in a single experiment, in a particular electrochemical reaction. This work could be the starting point for the study of the electrografting on other nanomaterials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Presently, activated carbon (AC) is the mostly used cathode material for LIC. Nevertheless, various carbonaceous materials can be used as anode materials, such as hard carbon (HC) and soft carbon (SC). Therefore, HC and SC with different structural and electrochemical characteristics have been investigated as the anode materials of LICs in this work. Compared with the HC electrode, the SC electrode showed higher electronic conductivity and reversible capacity. The rate capabilities of the two carbonaceous materials as a function of coating thickness have been evaluated using a wide range of current densities (0.1 ~ 12 A·g~(-1)). It reveals that the HC electrode exhibited better rate capability. The three-electrode LIC pouch cells have been assembled by using an AC cathode and various carbonaceous anodes with different pre-lithiation capacities. The potential swings and the IR drops of HC-and SC-based LICs have been studied. For both of the LIC systems, the appropriate pre-lithiation capacity could improve electrochemical performances, i.e., energy density, power density and cycling stability. Finally, the large-capacity LIC pouch cells of around 97 mAh were fabricated. The AC//SC LIC achieved the highest energy density of 21.2 Wh·kg~(-1), while the AC//HC LIC achieved the highest power density of 5.1 kW·kg~(-1) based on the total weight of the device.			锂离子电容器是一种应用前景广阔的电化学储能器件.目前,活性炭作为锂离子电容器正极被广泛使用.然而,锂离子电容器负极却有多种不同选择,如硬碳和软碳等碳材料.本文使用两种具有不同结构和电化学特性的硬碳和软碳材料作为锂离子电容器负极,进行了对比研究.研究表明,软碳相比于硬碳有更好的电子导电性和更高的可逆容量.通过在电流范围0.1 ~ 12 A·g~(-1)下进行充放电测试,分别研究了两种碳基电极在不同涂覆厚度下的倍率性能.结果显示,硬碳电极在大电流下有更好的倍率特性.然后,以活性炭为正极,预嵌锂的硬碳和软碳为负极,锂片为锂源和参比电极,分别组装了三电极软包锂离子电容器.根据三电极充放电测试,分别研究了不同预嵌锂量的硬碳和软碳所组装的锂离子电容器的电化学性能.结果表明,合适的负极预嵌锂容量可以提升锂电容的能量密度、功率密度和循环稳定性.最后,大容量硬碳和软碳基软包锂离子电容器被分别组装,软碳基锂电容实现了最高的能量密度21.2 Wh·kg~(-1)(基于整个器件质量),硬碳基锂电容实现最高的功率密度5.1 kW·kg~(-1).						9	3	0	0	0	0	12			1006-3471			CSCD:6464099

X-ray diffraction shows a pure typical perovskite phase for x >= 0.1. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed that the films surface is dense, with low roughness, depending on the Sm content, even though a few cracks were observed. Crystallite size was found to decrease with the Sm content. The electrodes were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The oxide electrode's capacitance was estimated using both techniques and the corresponding roughness factors evaluated. The values obtained from the two methods show a good agreement. A comparison between the voltammetric data and those referred in the literature allowed finding out that the redox reaction occurring at the electrode surface involves the pair Mn4+/Mn3+. EIS measurements confirm the voltammetric data and they also give additional information about the film porosity and the charge transfer resistance. This last parameter is associated with the oxidation and reduction of the pair Mn3+/Mn4+ and after normalized by the roughness factor shows an increase with samarium content. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A new instrument was thus specially built to perform absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic measurements directly at the nitrogen/water interface. The effect of initial surface density, incubation time, and compression speed have been studied. When PS II CC was spread at an initial surface pressure of 5.7 mN/m and immediately compressed at a speed of 40 nm(2)/moleeule.min, it retained its native spectroscopic characteristics. Even though a slower speed of compression (10 nm(2)/molecule.min) produced more homogeneous films, the absorption maxima suffered a blue shift, indicating denaturation of PS II CC. Compression at a speed of 80 nm(2)/molecule.min produced aggregates of intact PS II CC as indicated by Delta V-A isotherms, absorption spectra, and fluorescence micrographs. We also conclude that spreading of PS II CC at an initial surface pressure of 0.6 mN/m followed by a 30 min incubation time is inadequate to maintain PS II CC surface and spectral properties. Indeed, pi-A and Delta V-A isotherms measured in that condition showed transitions which suggested that PS II CC underwent physical changes during compression. Moreover, absorption and fluorescence maxima were blue shifted, indicating that PS II CC is denatured under that condition.									19	0	0	0	3	0	19			0743-7463			WOS:000074769100033

The triangle-like cobalt-based MOF arrays are first grown on a carbon cloth at room temperature, which is followed by an ion exchange/etching process with Ni(NO3)(2) to form a critical hollow nanostructure with an incorporated hetero-metal element. The intermediate is then transformed into the final product through solvothermal selenization treatment. Taking advantages of the structural and compositional merits as well as the self-supporting nature, the resultant (Ni,Co)Se-2 electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical activity and stability. When tested as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the (Ni,Co)Se-2 array electrode displayed a low onset overpotential of 226 mV and a small overpotential of 256 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The (Ni,Co)Se-2 electrode is also utilized in a supercapacitor, which delivers a high specific capacitance of 2.85 F cm(-2) at 2 mA cm(-2) and exhibits excellent cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 80.8% after 2000 charge-discharge cycles at 20 mA cm(-2). These results demonstrate the significance of the rational design of electrode materials and disclose the potential of our MOF-derived hollow (Ni,Co)Se-2 array electrode for a variety of practical applications in energy conversion and storage.									90	2	0	0	0	0	90			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000464518400061	30888390	
J	Radi, Rafael								Protein Tyrosine Nitration: Biochemical Mechanisms and Structural Basis of Functional Effects								ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH				46	2			550	559		10.1021/ar300234c				FEB 19 2013	2013	In proteins, the nitration of tyrosine residues to 3-nitrotyrosine represents an oxidative post-translational modification that disrupts nitric oxide MO) signaling and skews metabolism towards pro-oxidant processes. Indeed, excess levels of reactive oxygen species In the presence of *NO or *NO-derived metabolites lead to the formation of nitrating species such as peroxynitrite. Thus, protein 3-nitrotyrosine has been established as a biomarker of cell, tissue, and systemic "nitroxidative stress". Moreover, tyrosine nitration modifies key properties of the amino add: phenol group pK(a), redox potential, hydrophobicity, and volume. Thus, the incorporation of a nitro group (-NO2) into protein tyrosines can lead to profound structural and functional changes, some of which contribute to altered cell and tissue homeostasis. In this Account, I describe our current efforts to define (1) biologically-relevant mechanisms of protein tyrosine nitration and (2) how this modification can cause changes in protein structure and function at the molecular level. First, I underscore the relevance of protein tyrosine nitration via free-radical-mediated reactions (in both peroxynitrite-dependent and -independent pathways) involving a tyrosyl radical intermediate (Tyr*). This feature of the nitration process is critical because Tyr* can follow various fates, including the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine. Fast kinetic techniques, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies, bioanalytical methods, and kinetic simulations have all assisted in characterizing and fingerprinting the reactions of tyrosine with peroxynitrite and one-electron oxidants and its further evolution to 3-nitrotyrosine. Recent findings show that nitration of tyrosines in proteins associated with biomembranes Is linked to the lipid peroxidation process via a connecting reaction that involves the one-electron oxidation of tyrosine by lipid peroxyl radicals (LOO center dot).Second, immunochemical and proteomic-based studies indicate that protein tyrosine nitration is a selective process in vitro and In viva preferentially directed to a subset of proteins, and within those proteins, typically one or two tyrosine residues are site-specifically modified. The nature and site(s) of formation of the proximal oxidizing or nitrating species, the physicochemical characteristics of the local microenvironment, and the structural features of the protein account for part of this selectivity. How Oils relatively subtle chemical modification in one tyrosine residue can sometimes cause dramatic (flanges in protein activity has remained elusive Herein, I analyze recent structural biology data of two pure and homogenously nitrated mitochondrial proteins (i.e., cytochrome c and manganese superoxide dismutase, MnSOD) to illustrate regioselectivity and structural effects of tyrosine nitration and subsequent impact in protein loss- or even gain-of-function.									319	5	1	0	236	2	325			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000315478700033	23157446

The key limitations of R-PCECs performance lie mainly in the sluggish catalytic activity and poor durability of the air electrode for oxygen evolution/reduction reactions under realistic operating conditions. Herein, the findings on the development of highly active and durable air electrodes, achieved by a catalytic self-assembly of Ba2Co1.5Mo0.25Nb0.25O6-delta (BC1.5MN) composite electrode, are reported. Under high-temperature firing conditions, BC1.5MN is elegantly decomposed to a single-perovskite BaCoO3-delta (SP-BCO) and a double-perovskite Ba2-xCo1.5-xMo0.5Nb0.5O6-delta (DP-BCMN). Furthermore, fuel-electrode-supported full cells with BC1.5MN air electrode exhibit outstanding performance at 650 degrees C, achieving a peak power density of 1.17 W cm(-2) and an electrolysis current density of 2.04 A cm(-2) at 1.3 V. More importantly, the cells demonstrate excellent operation durability over 1100 h in fuel cell mode and exceptional cell cycling stability over 110 times within 220 h in dual modes of fuel cell and electrolysis cell. It is experimentally suggested that the catalytic durability is optimized by strong interaction between BCO and BCMN.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000859093500001

In the last decade, copper and copper-based nanomaterials (Cu NMs) as a branch of this category have attracted wide attention due to their unique physical and chemical properties, generating a significant contribution to the field of catalysis. In this review, we first briefly discuss recent advanced synthetic strategies and growth mechanisms such as chemical and physical methods to achieve copper and copper-based nanomaterials in benign conditions. These nanomaterials possess excellent properties such as high activity, selectivity, recyclability, good thermal stability, and efficient recovery. Then, comprehensive studies on Cu NMs and Cu single-atom catalysts (Cu SACs) with potential supporters including silica, magnetic materials, carbon materials, metal oxides, and metals alloys are presented. Subsequently, methods to design and modify Cu NMs to improve their performance in photocatalytic and organocatalytic reactions are discussed. Furthermore, advanced Cu single-atom catalysts (Cu SACs) are explored for a variety of catalytic applications and their activity and selectivity are discussed. We hope that this review will be helpful to young chemists, researchers, and scientists for improving the suitability of Cu NMs and Cu SACs in their research, establishing sustainable methods.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000792822200001		
J	Li, Zhong; Sun, Baozhuang; Pan, Yue; Huang, Liang								EIS analysis on the corrosion resistance of X80 steel under AC interference in simulated soil solution								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE				16	6					210657	10.20964/2021.06.08				JUN 2021	2021	In this work, the corrosion mechanism of X80 steel under AC interference was studied with electrochemical measurements. The surface potential was monitored at various AC current densities. EIS (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) measurements were conducted at various AC voltage amplitudes and for various time durations. Variations in the modulus values of the real part and imaginary part were studied. In addition, to simplify the problem, EIS was measured under the effect of various DC potentials. The surface potential was of the same frequency as the AC interference, and the amplitude of the electrode surface potential was linear with the applied current density. As the AC current density increased, the charge transfer resistance decreased due to the acceleration of both the anodic and cathodic processes. When the AC current density reached a certain value, hydrogen and oxygen evolution occurred because the effective Faraday potential exceeded the corresponding critical reaction potential. With an increasing AC time, the charge transfer resistance increased, which was due to the formation of a protective corrosion product film. With the application of low-amplitude AC voltages, there was only a small change in the capacitance of the electric double layer. Nevertheless, with the application of AC voltages at higher amplitudes, the modulus values of the real and imaginary parts of EIS were all less rapid, and the ratio of the imaginary part and real part decreased.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1452-3981			WOS:000661490000057

Material and method: A retrospective single center study was performed at Oculens Private Clinic in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. Our study included 61 eyes of 35 patients diagnosed with keratoconus in different stages of evolution fitted with Kerasoft 3 lens. The study was undergone between August 2015 and January 2019. Results: In our study, the mean age of the patients was 26.36±8.69 years. The group of study included 80.32% males and 19.62% females. Regarding previous surgeries, CXL was performed in 25 eyes, ICR in 1 eye, CXL and ICR in 15 eyes. The mean BCVA habitual was 0.38±0.19 logMar and with the lens 0.22±0.23 logMar (p<0.01). Spherical equivalent (SE) at baseline was -5.78 and after fitting the lens it decreased to -0.46. Comfort and tolerance level were maximum in all cases. No significant complications were noted with the use of contact lens. Conclusions: Kerasoft 3 contact lenses provide many of the benefits of RGP lenses (avoiding RGP's discomfort and allergic reactions), along with excellent comfort, visual acuity, high oxygen permeability and longer wearing times.

The basic components of most photoelectrochemical water splitting systems are semiconductor light absorbers coupled to electrocatalysts, which perform the desired chemical reactions. A critical challenge for the design of these systems is the lack of stability for the majority of desired semiconductors under operating water splitting conditions. One strategy to address this issue is to protect the semiconductor by covering it with a stabilizing insulator layer, creating a metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) architecture, which has demonstrated improved stability. In addition to enhanced stability, the insulator layer may significantly affect the electron and hole transfer, which governs the recombination rates. Furthermore, the insertion of an insulator layer leads to the introduction of additional insulator/electrocatalyst and insulator/semiconductor interfaces. These interfaces can impact the system's performance significantly, and they need to be carefully engineered to optimize the efficiencies of MIS systems. In this Account, we describe our recent progress in shedding light on the critical role of the insulator and the interfaces on the performance of MIS systems. We discuss our findings by focusing on the concrete example of planar n-type Si protected by a HfO2 insulator layer and coupled to a Ni or Ir electrocatalyst that performs the oxygen evolution reaction, one of the water splitting half-reactions. To improve our fundamental understanding of the insulator layer, we precisely control the HfO2 insulator thickness using atomic layer deposition (ALD), and we perform a series of rigorous electrochemical experiments coupled with theory and modeling. We demonstrate that by tuning the insulator thickness, we can control the flux and recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes to optimize the generated photovoltage. Despite optimizing the thickness, we find that the maximum generated photovoltage in MIS systems is often significantly lower than the upper performance limit, i.e., there are additional losses in the system that could not be addressed by optimizing the insulator thickness. We identify the sources of these losses and describe strategies to minimize them by a combination of improving the semiconductor light absorption, removing nonidealities associated with interfacial defects, and finding alternative insulators with improved charge carrier selectivity. Finally, we quantify the improvements that can be obtained by implementing these specific strategies. Our collective work outlines strategies to analyze MIS systems, identify the sources of efficiency losses, and optimize the design to approach the fundamental performance limits. These general approaches are broadly applicable to photoelectrochemical materials that utilize sunlight to produce value-added chemicals.									18	0	0	0	1	0	17			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000643542200016	33794089

All subsystems involving two independent reactants in metabolically fundamental parts of the Calvin cycle and the ancillary pathways of starch and sucrose synthesis have been examined in order to decide on basis of their kinetic and stoichiometric structure whether or not they may trigger oscillations.The results show that no less than 20 possible oscillators can be identified in the examined reaction system, only three of which have been previously considered as potential sources of experimentally observed oscillations. This illustrates the superiority of the method now applied over those previously used to identify possible two-reactant sources of metabolic oscillations and indicates that there should be no difficulty in complex metabolic pathways to point to a multitude of interactions that may trigger an oscillatory rate behaviour of the system.									21	0	1	0	20	0	22			0014-2956			WOS:A1991FT35800011	2050142

Due to the low conductivity and sluggish catalytic kinetics, the catalytic efficiency of Fe-rich catalysts is far from less abundant Ni, Co-rich alternatives and has been hardly improved without the involvement of Ni or Co. The lower activity of Fe-rich catalysts renders the real active center of state-of-the-art NiFe, CoFe catalyst in long-term scientific debate, despite of detection of Fe-based active intermediates in these catalysts during catalytic process. In the present work, we fabricated a series of sub-5 nm Fe1-yCryOx nanocatalysts via a simple solvothermal method, achieving systematically promoted high-valent Fe(VI) species generation by structural and electronic modulation, displaying highly active OER performance without involvement of Ni or Co. Detailed investigation revealed that the high OER activity is related to the ultrasmall nanoparticle size that promotes abundant edge- and corner-site exposure at catalyst surface, which involves in OER as highly reactive site; and the incorporated Cr ions that remarkably accelerate the charge transfer kinetics, providing an effective conduit as well as suitable host for high-valent active intermediate. This work reveals the structural prerequisites for efficient Fe-rich OER catalyst fabrication, inspiring deeper understanding of the structure-activity relationship as well as OER mechanism of Fe-based catalysts.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000532788500004

Therefore, the fabrication of functional materials and systems with strategic intelligence is required. As seen in the evolution processes in nature, self-assembling processes are capable of creating highly intelligent materials and systems. This task would be taken by an emerging concept, nanoarchitectonics, through the combination of nanotechnology concepts with other scientific disciplines such as materials science, supramolecular chemistry, organic chemistry, and bio-related science and technology. Herein, several examples are presented to overview intelligent nanoarchitectonics for the creation of functional materials and systems mainly through self-assembly in various scale ranges.

Herein, a facile and scalable strategy is evolved to design N doped bamboo-like carbon nanotube decorated with tri-metal nanoparticles (Fe-Ni-Cr/NC) for overall water-splitting in alkaline electrolyte. Coupling effects between different metals and intimately contact with the carbon matrix endow the obtained nanomaterial possesses splendid catalytic activity and stability for cathodic HER, anodic OER and overall water-splitting in alkaline electrolyte. The obtained Fe-Ni-Cr/NC exhibits the best catalytic performance for HER (284 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) relative to Fe-Cr/NC (368 mV), Ni-Cr/NC (314 mV) and Fe-Ni/NC (324 mV). For OER, a small overpotential of 210 mV is needed to drive 10 mAcm(-2) which is superior to IrO2 (330 mV). Thus, the interactions between different metals act as paramount effects on promoting the catalytic activities. Benefiting from the outstanding catalytic performances for both HER and OER, the designed Fe-Ni-Cr/NC possesses splendid catalytic activity for overall water-splitting with a small potential of 1.64 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the obtained nanomaterial also owns remarkable long-term stability in the measured electrolyte.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000514749500063

Additionally, the reduction of Pt load in the catalysts while maintaining their optimum performances is essential to large scale practical applications. Here, we show that small PtZn bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on the rutile and reduced TiO2(110)-(1 x 1) surface can be prepared by a two step consecutive deposition process where Pt was deposited first and followed by Zn. In situ synchrotron-based near ambient pressure photoemission spectroscopy experiments are used to monitor the evolution of the oxidation states and surface elemental composition of pure Pt and PtZn NPs under high exposure to O-2 pressure. The formation of stable Pt surface oxide was evidenced for both pure and PtZn NPs. While a sizeable encapsulation of pure Pt NPs by TiOx was seen after annealing at 440 K under 1 mbar of O-2, no such effect was noticed for PtZn NPs. The formation of a zinc oxide layer on PtZn NPs enhances the stability of the NPs and induces a partial reduction of the TiO2(110) surface. Spontaneous formation of a Pt-Zn alloy phase at room temperature was seen in PtZn NPs.									16	0	0	0	1	0	15			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000371424800015		
J	Zhang, Yili; Zhang, Zhang; Yan, Qianjiang; Wang, Qiang								Synthesis, characterization, and catalytic activity of alkali metal molybdate/alpha-MoO3 hybrids as highly efficient catalytic wet air oxidation catalysts								APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL				511				47	58		10.1016/j.apcata.2015.11.035				FEB 5 2016	2016	To develop new catalysts which can be used in catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) with ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, a series of M2Mo4O13/alpha-MoO3 (M = Li, Na or K) hybrid catalysts for cationic red GTL removal were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. The growth of crystals under different synthesis pH and the phase evolution during thermal treatment were carefully monitored using various analytical tools. The influence of synthesis pH, calcination temperature, reaction temperature, degradation time, and bubbling with air or N-2 on the decolorization efficiency, and the removal rates of total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were systematically investigated. For all three catalysts, approximately 100% of color and over 93% of TOC could be removed within 30 min. Compared to many catalysts reported in literature, these novel catalysts showed higher catalytic activity in dye wastewater degradation. The catalytic activity tests in the presence of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy-N-oxyl (TEMPO) and the electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis suggested that the existence of M2Mo4O13 (M = Li, Na or K) promotes the formation of (OH)-O-center dot radicals and is critical for their superior catalytic activity. Considering the ambient operating condition and the excellent catalytic activity, these novel CWAO catalysts are very promising for practical applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Increasing temperature from 430 degrees C to 520 degrees C improved both oil and gas yields, but reduced the oil/gas yield ratio. Raising temperature increased nitrogen content in the derived shale oil and decreased the atomic H/C ratio and oxygen content, but had no significant effect on the sulfur content. It was also noticed that the boiling point of shale oil generated at 490 degrees C was lowest, and the shale oils obtained at 430 degrees C and 460 degrees C showed similar boiling point distributions. The produced shale oils had similar atomic H/C ratio as well as higher light oil content compared to crude oils produced in China, and could be classified as sweet and high-nitrogen oil in terms of the classification method of crude oil. The oil derived at 490 degrees C contained the lowest amount of saturates and the highest amount of aromatics, asphaltenes and non-hydrocarbons. C-1-C-4 hydrocarbon gas contents rose with increasing temperature. Higher ethene/ethane, propene/propane, butene/ butane and alkene/alkane ratios obtained at higher temperature were linked to secondary cracking reactions.

The latter is critical as it largely governs the adsorption of electrolyte components and reaction intermediates and, therefore, controls many key electrocatalytic processes. Using model Pt(111) single-crystal electrodes, we demonstrate how the relative position of Cu atoms at the surface drastically changes the adsorption energies for (bi) sulfate anions. Our measurements involve pseudomorphic overlayers of Cu on Pt(111) as well as Cu-Pt(111) surface and sub-surface alloys, where Cu atoms were located either in the first or in the second atomic layers of Pt, respectively. In the case of Cu-Pt(111) surface alloys, specific adsorption of the anions starts earlier compared to the unmodified Pt(111) surface. In contrast, placing Cu atoms into the second atomic layer weakens the binding between the surface and the anions. Surprisingly, Cu pseudomorphic overlayers do not reveal any specific adsorption of (bi) sulfates (within the region of the overlayer stability). Taking into account that electrified interfaces between Pt(111) electrodes and sulfate-containing electrolytes often play the role of benchmark systems in fundamental physico-chemical and, particularly, electrocatalytic studies, our findings demonstrate a promising and relatively easy route of tuning the properties of these interfaces.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2196-0216			WOS:000338287600031

Such nanorods have an aspect ratio of ca. 3 nm with a diameter of ca. 8 nm and a large BET specific area of 128.2 m(2)/g. On the basis of this, the controlled conversion of the as-prepared nanorods into nanotubes, nanowires, and nanocubes through hydrothermal reactions has been realized. Further experimental results show that the growth of nanorods is a function of the base concentration, temperature, and time. In addition, particle size measurements demonstrate that the primary nanorods grow by Ostwald ripening. It is found that CeO(2) growth is faster at higher base concentration and temperature due to the accelerated ripening. During the synthesis, the formation of Ce(OH)(3) intermediate species and their transformation into CeO(2) have been dynamically demonstrated and are regarded as the key factors responsible for the evolution of shape. The CO oxidation properties of CeO(2) nanorods, nanowires, nanotubes, and nanocubes were investigated, and CeO(2) nanotubes have the best performance due to the large BET surface area and the novel inner surface. In addition, CeO(2) nanorods aged for 9 d also have an excellent catalytic performance for CO oxidation due to the exposed crystal surface (110) of CeO(2) ((C) Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Sulfur isotope fractionation during sulfate reduction occurs when sulfate is transported into the cell and is reduced to sulfide through a series of reversible reactions operating with different efficiencies and distinct fractionation factors. The magnitude of fractionation depends on. the relationship between: (1) the exchange of sulfate across the cell membrane and (2) the exchange of sulfur between the different internal sulfur pools. Sulfate exchange and sulfate reduction rates are controlled by different environmental factors that include temperature, and electron donor and sulfate concentration. Recent considerations of the minor isotopes of sulfur, I'S and I'S, provide new insights into the controls on biological fractionation of sulfur isotopes. This approach has provided a mechanism for distinguishing the relative contributions of different sulfur metabolisms to the sulfur isotope record in modem and ancient environments. While recent experimental and modeling work has improved our understanding of the factors controlling fractionation during sulfate reduction, it has also highlighted several unanswered questions. For example, precise fractionation factors for individual enzymatic reduction steps remain unknown. Furthermore, the reversibility of sulfate transport and the reversibility of sulfite reduction in vivo have never been tested. These factors play critical roles in controlling isotope fractionation during sulfate reduction and affect the predictive success of any isotope fractionation model.

J	Yin, Zhuocheng; Shi, Yuchuan; Shen, Shaohua								A n-Si/CoOx/Ni:CoOOH photoanode producing 600 mV photovoltage for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting								SCIENCE CHINA-MATERIALS											10.1007/s40843-022-2136-0		AUG 2022			2022	n-Si, believed as a promising photoanode candidate, has suffered from sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and poor chemical stability when exposed to aqueous electrolyte. Herein, CoOx/Ni:CoOOH bilayers were successfully deposited on n-Si substrate by atomic layer-deposition (ALD) and photoassisted electrochemical deposition (PED) for stabilizing and catalyzing photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. In comparison to the n-Si/CoOx photoanode as reference, the prepared n-Si/CoOx/Ni:CoOOH photoanode upon the optimized PED process presents a much improved PEC performance for water splitting, with the onset potential cathodically shifted to similar to 1.03 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and the photocurrent density much increased to 20 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE. It is revealed that the introduction of Ni dopants increases the work functions of the deposited Ni:CoOOH overlayers, which gives rise to the upward band bending weakened at the n-Si/CoOx/Ni:CoOOH cascading interface while strengthened at the Ni:CoOOH/electrolyte interface (with the band bending shifted from downward to upward), contributing to the decreased and the increased driving forces for charge transfer at the interfaces, respectively. Then, the balanced driving forces at the interfaces would endow the n-Si/CoOx/Ni:CoOOH photoanode with the best PEC performance. Moreover, PED has been evidenced superior to ED to dope Ni into CoOOH with the formed overlayer effectively catalyzing and stabilizing PEC water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000841718100004

The formation of nanoporous Cu-Sn alloys or composites was probed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanobeam-energy dispersive spectroscopy (NB-EDS). The results showed that the structure and phase compositions of the as-dealloyed products depended on the compositions of the precursors and dealloying electrolytes. Ultrafine nanoporous Cu3Sn and Cu6Sn5 alloys could be obtained from dealloying of Mg66Cu25.5Sn8.5 and Mg67Cu18Sn15 precursors in 1 wt% TA, respectively. The dealloying of the Mg66Cu10.2Sn23.8 alloy in 1 wt% TA induced the formation of nanoporous Cu6Sn5/Sn composites. However, using 5 wt% HCl as the dealloying electrolyte led to the partial dissolution of Sn, resulting in the formation of nanoporous Cu41Sn11 and Cu6Sn5 from Mg66Cu25.5Sn8.5 and Mg66Cu10.2Sn23.8 alloys, respectively. The ligaments of the nanoporous structure after dealloying in 5 wt% HCl were also coarser due to the fast diffusion of Cu and Sn with the existence of Cl-. The dealloying mechanisms of the Mg-Cu-Sn alloys were discussed based on the experimental results. The present study provides a facile dealloying approach to fabricate nanoporous Cu-Sn intermetallic alloys via the design of precursors and the selection of dealloying electrolytes.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			1466-8033			WOS:000449275100004

Results indicate that the electrochemical processes are dependent on the applied potential, the alloy composition, and the pH and ionic strength of the electrolyte. An enhancement of the corrosion processes is observed when the pH and the ionic strength are increased and when the Co content of the alloy diminishes. Furthermore, XPS provided information about the composition of the surface layer.									19	0	0	0	6	2	20			1432-8488			WOS:000172915200001

The evolution of the high-temperature flame has been followed based on chemiluminescence imaging of the excited-state hydroxyl radical (OH*), and PLIF of ground-state OH. Regions associated with low-temperature chemical reactions are visualized using formaldehyde (CH2O) PLIF with 355-nm excitation. We compare the results obtained by different research institutes under nominally identical experimental conditions and fuel injectors. In spite of design differences among the various experimental facilities, the results are consistent. This lends confidence to studies of transient behavior and parameter variations performed by individual research groups. We present results of the transient flame structures at Spray A reference conditions, and include parametric variations around this baseline, involving ambient temperature, oxygen concentration and injection pressure. Key results are the observed influence of an entrainment wave on the transient flame behavior, model-substantiated explanations for the high intensity OH* lobes at the lift-off length and differences with OH PLIF, and a general analogy of the flame structures with a spray cone along which the flame tends to locate for the applied parametric variations.

Initially, spherical 200 particles made of nanocrystallites, were precipitated. From the early growth stage, crystallites were radially aligned along the c-axis. With aging, the nanoparticles transformed into hexagonal prism-like particles with pyramidal tops, which showed dear radial alignment. Subsequently; the ZnO Spheres became cracked and broke Into wedge-Shaped pieces of the pyramid-like particles The microscopic studies suggested that the spherical particles grew through oriented attachment of small particles during the early growth stage, While Ostwald ripening through dissolution-recrystallization changed the component particles to a pyramidal shape in the later stage. In order to investigate the-growth process, we attempted a novel isotope tracer study, where (H2O)-O-18 was used for the solvent and the distribution Of O-18 in the spherical particles was analyzed by a secondary ion mass spectrometer. The concentric O-18 distribution in the ZnO spherical powder aided the mechanism of continuous concentric-oriented attachment of nanoparticles to form spherical ZnO particles. The difference in the O-18 distribution before and,after transformation into the pyramid shape was small, which implies that this change was a local reaction. The oxygen isotope tracer study in water EG solvent was proven effective in determining the history of the particles and the development of their inner structures.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000355890400012

The assessment of the NaNbxTa1-xO3 materials obtained by the SSR method reveals that the activity of the individual NaTaO3 and NaNbO3 perovskite semiconductors is largely improved in their combined form. Among several compositions employed, the 1 : 1 molar ratio (NaNb0.5Ta0.5O3 sample) shows the best performance for H-2 production. On the other hand, using the Hyd method, which implies lower synthesis temperature, the photocatalytic activity of NaNb0.5Ta0.5O3 is enhanced compared to the material obtained by the high temperature SSR method. The characterization of the materials reveals that catalyst properties like high surface area, a larger proportion of the monoclinic crystalline phase and lower crystal defects for the NaNb0.5Ta0.5O3 photocatalyst synthesized by the hydrothermal route may be responsible for its superior activity. Further significant improvement in the activity of the NaNb0.5Ta0.5O3 semiconductor is achieved by the addition of Pt as the co-catalyst, showing that the loading amount has a great influence on the activity. The highest H-2 production rate (37.8 mu mol g(-1) min(-1)) is obtained for the catalyst prepared by the hydrothermal method (Hyd-NaNb0.5Ta0.5O3) with 0.125 wt% of Pt loading. Moreover, the developed Hyd-NaNb0.5Ta0.5O3 sample shows a stable H-2 evolution activity for several reuse cycles.									26	3	0	0	1	0	27			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000351091300047

The electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic properties of the InGaN NWs are studied in detail by cyclic voltammetry, current versus time measurements, photovoltage measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. In parallel, IrOx(OH)(y) as the co-catalyst on the InGaN NWs is evaluated to boost the catalytic activity in the dark and light. For the PFC, Ag is the best as the cathode among Ag, Pt, and glassy carbon. The PFC operates in the dark as a conventional fuel cell (FC) and under illumination with 25% increased electrical power generation at room temperature. Such dual operation is unique, combining FC and PFC technologies for the most flexible use.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1343			WOS:000674270200032	34278132

For comparison, the carbonization of a high-temperature coal tar pitch and a petroleum pitch were also considered. Different operating conditions during the carbonization process were used in an attempt to cover different degrees of mesophase formation and development for each pitch. The parent pitches and the semicokes thus obtained were analyzed by elemental analysis, optical microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). More significantly, the samples were subjected to thermal decomposition under well controlled operating conditions from room temperature to 850 degreesC in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TG). The use of a mass spectrometer linked to the TG (TG-MS) provides additional data about the devolatilization process, yielding information about the evolution,of different volatile products and about possible chemical reactions occurring during thermal decomposition. Thus an-insight into the process of mesophase formation is obtained. The results from FT-IR, elemental analysis, and the TG-MS tests were compared with the different extents of mesophase formation, checked by optical microscopy. According to the results, several stages can be distinguished as temperature increases in the carbonization process of the pitches. In them low-temperature coal tar pitch, the devolatilization of light components, especially phenols, accounts for the most significant weight loss. Moreover, cross-linking contributes greatly to the formation and development of mesophase, resulting in the predominance of bulk mesophase in A relatively short time in the case of the low-temperature coal tar pitch.									24	1	0	0	0	0	24			0887-0624			WOS:000176965100019

Here we demonstrate the facile solvothermal synthesis of uniform Zn-MOF-74 hexagonal nano/microrods (ZRods) with an accurate diameter modulation from tens of nanometers to micron size through varying the H2O content in the mixed solvent. An inverted volcano relationship between the ZRod diameters and H2O contents is presented. CH3COO- is identified to be critical to the hexagonal pillar shape formation, while a competitive reaction of protons dissociated from H2O is responsible for the size modulation. After calcination, the obtained porous carbon nanorods enable a high loading capacity and perfect encapsulation of P while reserving free spaces to accommodate the volume change of P in the composite anode, resulting in outstanding potassium storage performance in terms of remarkable initial Coulombic efficiency (78.5%), top-ranking reversible capacity (up to 595.8 mAh g-1), superior rate capability (187.5 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1), and robust long-term cycling stability (retaining 150.7 mAh g-1 at 2.5 A g-1 after 400 cycles). This morphology modulation of Zn-MOF-74 will promote the advanced applications of Zn-MOF-74 as well as its derived carbon materials, and potentially opens a general pathway for the oriented evolution of various carboxylate-based MOFs.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000640488200003

Their CO2-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) are thought to play a key role in cyanobacterial calcification, but the mechanisms are not completely understood. In Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803, a single Ca2+/H+ exchanger (Slr1336) controls the Ca2+/H+ exchange reaction. We knocked out the exchanger and investigated the effects on cyanobacterial calcification and CCMs. Inactivation of slr1336 significantly increased the calcification rate and decreased the zeta potential, indicating a relatively stronger Ca2+-binding ability. Some genes encoding CCM-related components showed increased expression levels, including the cmpA gene, which encodes the Ca2+-dependent HCO3- transporter BCT1. The transcript level of cmpA in the mutant was 30 times that in wild type. A Western blot analysis further confirmed that protein levels of CmpA were higher in the mutant than the wild type. Measurements of inorganic carbon fluxes and O-2 evolution proved that both the net HCO3- uptake rate and the BCT1 transporter supported photosynthetic rate in the slr1336 mutant were significantly higher than in the wild type. This would cause the mutant cells to liberate more OH- ions out of the cell and stimulate CaCO3 precipitation in the microenvironment. We conclude that the mutation of the Ca2+/H+ exchanger in Synechocystis promoted the cyanobacterial calcification process by upregulating CCMs, especially the BCT1 HCO3- transporter. These results shed new light on the mechanism by which CCM-facilitated photosynthesis promotes cyanobacterial calcification.									28	0	0	0	22	0	29			0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:000319986200018	23624472

In this work, UiO-66-NH2@Au@COF core-shell nanocomposites with intercalated Au nanoparticles between the UiO-66-NH2 core and the covalent-organic framework (COF) shell have been demonstrated to exhibit enhanced activity and stability for visible-light-driven aerobic selective oxidation of amines to imines. With optimized Au and two-dimensional pi-conjugated COF content, the obtained UiO-66-NH2@Au-0.5@COF1 photocatalyst exhibited the highest conversion of benzylamine with an imine yield of 66.9% for at least five cycles. It is revealed that the introduction of appropriate Au and COF could not only broaden the visible-light absorption band but also promote the separation of photoinduced charge carriers and enhance the photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, a rational mechanism was explored to elucidate the process nanoparticles with the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect act of photocatalytic reaction. The intercalated Au as generators of hot electrons and also transfer channels for the photo-generated electrons from the COF shell to the UiO-66-NH2 core. Importantly, the MOF@metal@COF photocatalysts might provide a promising strategy to construct photocatalysts with desirable activity and stability under visible-light illumination.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2168-0485			WOS:000699846000017

The model was used to perform a series of simulations under varying pulsed discharge frequencies and pulse numbers, at atmospheric pressure and moderate to high temperatures (600?1500 K). A zero-dimensional solver which combines the ZDPlasKin and CHEMKIN software is used to explore the effect of pulse number and frequency on ignition delay time. For a moderate amount of pulses, a reduction of 40?60% in ignition delay time is achieved, with higher pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) yielding shorter ignition delay times. Analysis of OH radical time evolution reveals that high PRFs support an increasing radical pool at low temperatures, whereas at lower PRFs radicals recombine in between pulses. In the thermal runaway phase, the radicals formed in conventional chain branching events are prevalent, so that OH formed in later pulses has little effect. When looking low temperatures and high PRFs, higher pulse frequencies allow for lower initial temperatures which will result in ignition. At a high enough frequency, the hysteresis of ignition and extinction is altered due to a high amount of radicals supplied and sustained by the plasma, so that there is a smooth transition and reactions at all temperatures. ? 2020 The Combustion Institute.

The HRTEM analysis of the prepared heterostructure indicated the high-dense growth of Bi2MoO6 nanorods on the sheets of reduced graphene oxide, indicating the successful formation of the heterostructure. The heterostructure was subsequently used for the photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline in the presence of visible light illumination. The degradation efficiency of nearly 88% was obtained for an initial tetracycline concentration of 5 mg/L at pH 8 and photocatalyst loading of 0.50 g/L in 180 min using the prepared heterostructure. The synthesized rGO-Bi2MoO6 heterostructure displayed enhanced degradation efficiency (88%) in comparison to the pure Bi2MoO6 nanorods (55%) under similar reaction conditions. The scavenger study was conducted to determine the role played by various reactive oxygen species in the degradation of the drug and revealed that electrons and superoxide anion radicals played a pivotal role. The synthesized rGO-Bi2MoO6 heterostructure showed good recyclability up to four cycles. The significant enhancement in the photocatalytic performance of rGO-Bi2MoO6 heterostructure could be assigned to the introduction of graphene which leads to more efficient harvesting of incident visible light, massive reduction in the recombination rates of the photogenerated charge carriers and better charge transportation across the heterostructure surface.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000629472700007

Different parameterizations of the organic aerosol formation and evolution in the two-dimensional volatility basis set (2D-VBS) framework are evaluated using ground and airborne measurements collected in the 2012 Pan-European Gas AeroSOls-climate interaction Study (PEGASOS) field campaign in the Po Valley (Italy). A number of chemical aging schemes are examined, taking into account various functionalization and fragmentation pathways for biogenic and anthropogenic OA components. Model predictions and measurements, both at the ground and aloft, indicate a relatively oxidized OA with little average diurnal variation. Total OA concentration and O : C ratios are reproduced within experimental error by a number of chemical aging schemes. Anthropogenic secondary OA (SOA) is predicted to contribute 15-25 % of the total OA, while SOA from intermediate volatility compound oxidation contributes another 2035 %. Biogenic SOA (bSOA) contributions varied from 15 to 45 % depending on the modeling scheme. Primary OA contributed around 5 % for all schemes and was comparable to the hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) concentrations derived from the positive matrix factorization of the aerosol mass spectrometer (PMF-AMS) ground measurements. The average OA and O : C diurnal variation and their vertical profiles showed a surprisingly modest sensitivity to the assumed vaporization enthalpy for all aging schemes. This can be explained by the interplay between the partitioning of the semivolatile compounds and their gas-phase chemical aging reactions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1680-7316	1680-7324		WOS:000440012400002

However, the controlled synthesis of MOF-derived materials with desirable compositions, structures, and properties still remains a big challenge. Herein, we propose a post-solvothermal route for the outer-to-inner loss of organic linkers from MOF, which is simple, rapid, and controllable and can be operated at temperature much lower than that of the commonly adopted pyrolysis method. By such a strategy, the MIL-125-NH2 particles coated by TiO2 nanosheets were produced, and the thickness of TiO2 shell can be easily tuned. The MIL-125-NH2@TiO2 core-shell particles combine the advantages of highly active TiO2 nanosheets, MIL-125-NH2 photosensitizer, plenty of linker defects and oxygen vacancies, and mesoporous structure, which allows them to be utilized as photocatalysts for the visible-light-driven hydrogen production reaction. It is remarkable that the hydrogen evolution rate by MIL-125-NH2@TiO2 can be enhanced 70 times compared with the pristine MIL-125-NH2. Such a route can be easily applied to the synthesis of different kinds of MOF-derived functional materials.									98	9	0	0	9	0	101			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000432753800022	29692167

To circumvent these problems, one should use, wherever possible, such catalyst materials that are meant to remain in the structure and have some application-specific role, making any removal steps unnecessary. Thus, as a proof-of-concept, we present here a nanocarbon-based material platform for electrochemical hydrogen peroxide measurement utilizing a Pt catalyst layer to grow CNFs with intact Pt particles at the tips of the CNFs. Backed by careful scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis, we show that this material can be readily realized with the Pt catalyst layer thickness impacting the resulting structure and also present a growth model to explain the evolution of the different types of structures. In addition, we show by electrochemical analysis that the material exhibits characteristic features of Pt in cyclic voltammetry and it can detect very small amounts of hydrogen peroxide with very fast response times. Thus, the present sensor platform provides an interesting electrode material with potential for biomolecule detection and in fuel cells and batteries. In the wider range, we propose a new approach where the selection of catalytic particles used for carbon nanostructure growth is made so that (i) they do not need to be removed and (ii) they will have essential role in the final application.									20	0	0	0	3	0	19			2470-1343			WOS:000395863300015	30023609

Synechococcus sp. PCC 6301) were grown at white light intensities of 2 and 20 W/M2 , and supplied with 0.03 and 3 % CO2 enriched air. The mutual influence of these growth factors on the development of the photosynthetic apparatus was studied by analyses of the pigment content, by low temperature absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy, by analyses of oxygen evolution light-saturation curves, and by SDS PAGE of isolated phycobilisomes.The two growth factors, light and CO2, distinctly affect the absorption cross section of the photosynthetic apparatus, which is expressed by its pigment pattern, excitation energy distribution and capacity. In response to low CO2 concentrations, the phycocyanin/allophycocyanin ratios were lower and one linker polypeptide L(R)30, of the phycobilisomes was no longer detectable in SDS PAGE. Apparently, low CO2 adaptation results in shorter phycobilisome rods. Specifically, upon adaptation to low light intensities, the chlorophyll and the phycocyanin content on a per cell basis increase by about 50 % suggesting a parallel increase in the amount of phycobilisomes and photosystem core-complexes. Low light adaptation and low CO2 adaptation both cause a shift of the excitation energy distribution in favor of photosystem I. Variations in the content of the ''anchor'' polypeptides L(CM)60 and L(CM)75 are possibly related to changes in the excitation energy transfer from phycobilisomes to the photosystem II and photosystem I core-complexes.									21	0	0	0	25	0	26			0932-8629			WOS:A1993MT67000004

Here, the authors report a new strategy to address Pd reoxidation by fabricating spatially proximate photocatalyst and Pd(II) catalyst into metal-organic framework.Palladium catalyst turnover by reoxidation of a low-valent Pd species dominates the proceeding of an efficient oxidative transformation, but the state-of-the-art catalysis approaches still have great challenges from the perspectives of high efficiency, atom-economy and environmental-friendliness. Herein, we report a new strategy for addressing Pd reoxidation problem by the fabrication of spatially proximate Ir-III photocatalyst and Pd-II catalyst into metal-organic framework (MOF), affording MOFs based Pd/photoredox catalysts UiO-67-Ir-PdX2 (X = OAc, TFA), which are systematically evaluated using three representative Pd-catalyzed oxidation reactions. Owing to the stabilization of single-site Pd and Ir catalysts by MOFs framework as well as the proximity of them favoring fast electron transfer, UiO-67-Ir-PdX2, under visible light, exhibits up to 25 times of Pd catalyst turnover number than the existing catalysis systems. Mechanism investigations theoretically corroborate the capability of MOFs based Pd/photoredox catalysis to regulate the competitive processes of Pd-0 aggregation and reoxidation in Pd-catalyzed oxidation reactions.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4				2041-1723		WOS:000757851300013	35177599

Cu2+ ion-grafted titanium dioxide (TiO2) was designed on the basis of visible-light-induced interfacial charge transfer from the valence band (VB) of TiO2 to Cu2+, generating high oxidative decomposition activity owing to the utilization of photogenerated holes in the VB of TiO2. Cu+ produced by electron injection was converted back to Cu2+ by oxygen (O-2) reduction through multi-electron O-2 reduction reaction. As for water splitting, zinc rhodium oxide (ZnRh2O4) and bismuth vanadate (Bi4V2O11) as H-2 and O-2 evolution photocatalysts, respectively, were connected with silver (Ag), acting as a solid-state electron mediator, to prepare a composite photocatalyst that is sensitive to red light. The key function of the heterojunction photocatalyst is the transfer of photoexcited electrons from the conduction band (CB) of Bi4V2O11 to the VB of ZnRh2O4 via Ag. Thus, the photoexcited electrons in the CB of ZnRh2O4 and the holes in the VB of Bi4V2O11 effectively reduced and oxidized water, respectively, thereby splitting water and liberating H-2 and O-2 at a stoichiometric ratio.

J	Yu, Hai; Zhang, Miao; Lv, Jianguo; Wang, Yanfen; Yang, Lei; Liu, Yanmei; Gao, Qian; He, Gang; Sun, Zhaoqi								Fabrication of a stable light-activated and p/n type AgVO3/V2O5-TiO2 heterojunction for pollutants removal and photoelectrochemical water splitting								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				894						162500	10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.162500		NOV 2021		FEB 15 2022	2022	In this study, we fabricated TiO2 nanorod arrays (TiO2), which were decorated with AgVO3 quantum dots (QDs) on and a layer of V2O5 film, forming a heterojunction material for removal pollutants and photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The AgVO3/V2O5-TiO2 nanorod arrays (AgVO3/V2O5-TiO2) synthesized by the secondary hydrothermal method were grown on conductive glass to form one-dimensional (1D) nanorod and p-n junction structures. Through experimental characterisation and testing, optical, mor-phological photocatalysis and PEC characteristics of the materials were measured and studied. The TiO2 modified with AgVO3 and V2O5 can significantly improve the visible light optical absorption, the reduce the electron-hole pair binding rate and shorten the band gap (3.07-1.41 eV) of TiO2. The resulting photocurrent density (116 uA/cm(2)) and photodegradation efficiency (rate constant, k = 0.025 min(-1)) of AgVO3/V2O5-TiO2 are approximately 20 (6 uA/cm(2)) and 5 times (0.005 min(-1)) higher than those of bare TiO2, respectively. The AgVO3/V2O5-TiO2 achieved a current density of 10 mA at an overpotential of 246.2 mV and exhibited ex-cellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. The systematic PEC experiments concluded that the optimized of the TiO2 interface by AgVO3 and V2O5 could promote the separation and transport of charge carriers.

Two gluthathione peroxidases play key roles in the cellular protection against oxidative damage. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1) removes cytosolic hydroperoxides while phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPx-4) is a unique enzyme that reduces phospholipid peroxides in membranes.Methods We cloned and sequenced the full-length cDNA for GPx-1 (GenBank: AY966403) and GPx-4 (GenBank: AY966404) from the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) in order to create a suitable model for studying human diseases related with oxidative stress.Results The cDNAs encode a 202 amino acid protein for GPx-1 and a 197 amino acid protein for GPx-4. Both proteins include selenocysteine (Sec, in Gpx-1 at position 48; in GPx-4 at position 73) and showed high homology (> 90%) with other mammalian GPxs. The relative levels of mRNA expression for GPx-1 and GPx-4 were determined in different marmoset tissues by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using transcription elongation factor-2 as a reference gene. GPx-1 showed increased levels of expression in the liver, heart and kidney while the highest mRNA levels for GPx-4 were detected in the testis, followed by the liver, lung, kidney and spinal cord.Conclusions These findings will be of value for studies designed to assess the role of glutathione peroxidases in non-human primate models for a variety of diseases in which increased oxidative stress has been implicated.									4	0	0	0	3	0	5			0047-2565			WOS:000237352700007	16764674

Owing to their unique qualities, such as intrinsic electronics and optical attributes, 2D materials have achieved tremendous breakthroughs in the direct applications of MONs. Based on recent research findings, MONs have been regarded as promising materials for surface functioning. At the same time, the intrinsic band structure and electronic properties may be rationally regulated via structural change, which can be the focal point of advanced materials design, processing, and progress. In this context, the potential to utilize different ligands and a vast number of coordinative atoms become important in designing 2D materials to address the tremendous needs of industry players. This review focuses on coordination nanosheets, which is a type of molecule-based nanosheets. The examples of coordination nanosheets are discussed in Section 1. In Section 2, surveys research on bottom-up coordination nanosheets synthesized through the liquid/liquid and gas/liquid interfacial reactions are discussed. Section 3 discusses the potential applications of coordination nanosheets in nanomaterial science. Overall, this review provides a useful source of information for researchers working on advancing 2D nanomaterials, particularly coordination nanosheets.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2069-5837			WOS:000835492800050

In this study, the coal pyrolysis experiment was performed in an entrained flow reactor to obtain the light gas release characteristics. Six typical Chinese coals with volatile content ranged from 8.8% to 38.3% were studied. The pyrolysis temperature was in the range from 600 to 1200 degrees C. A significant rank dependence of HCN, CO and C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 was observed and their release for high volatile coals was higher than that for low volatile coals. The HCN-N/NH3-N ratio ranged from 0.00 to 0.66 for anthracite coals and ranged from 1.63 to 3.90 for high volatile coals. Based on the experimental results, the effect of coal pyrolysis gas on NO reduction in a plug flow reactor at reducing atmosphere was kinetically calculated. The optimal excess air ratio(alpha(opt)) corresponding to the maximum NO removal efficiency decreased with an increase in reduction temperature. For the light gas from the HL coal pyrolyzed at 800 degrees C, the alpha(opt) decreased from 0.73 to 0.17 when the reduction temperature increased from 927 to 1327 degrees C. The rate of production analysis indicated that NO removal efficiency was determined by 3 competing reaction paths: NO reduction, NO formation and oxygen consumption by combustible species.

Therefore, it can not only act a powerful tool for materials synthesis, but also offer an effective platform for sensing and catalysis. As extraordinary zero-dimensional materials, carbon-based quantum dots (CQDs) have been attracting tremendous attention due to their excellent properties such as good chemical stability, environmental friendliness, nontoxicity and abundant resources. Compared with the traditional methods for the preparation of CQDs, electrochemical (EC) methods offer advantages of simple instrumentation, mild reaction conditions, low cost and mass production. In return, CQDs could provide cost-effective, environmentally friendly, biocompatible, stable and easily-functionalizable probes, modifiers and catalysts for EC sensing. However, no specific review has been presented to systematically summarize both aspects until now. In this review, the EC preparation methods of CQDs are critically discussed focusing on CQDs. We further emphasize the applications of CQDs in EC sensors, electrocatalysis, biofuel cells and EC flexible devices. This review will further the experimental and theoretical understanding of the challenges and future prospective in this field, open new directions on exploring new advanced CQDs in EC to meet the high demands in diverse applications.									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000520242800001	32104980

Notably, the ZIF-67@Co-MOF-74 catalyst with shell thicknesses of 10 nm, 25 nm and 50 nm can be further obtained by adjusting the mass ratio of ZIF-67 and DHTP. Compared to individual ZIF-67 or Co-MOF-74 catalyst, the as-prepared core-shell MOF catalyst exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activities for light-driven water oxidation reaction. Furthermore, the content of oxygen evolution by water splitting increased gradually with the increase in shell thickness. The formation of crystal defects and the uncoordinated hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface of core-shell MOFs facilitated the exposure of the metal catalytic center and the adsorption of water molecules through hydrogen bonding interactions to react with the catalytic active center effectively. In addition, the photogenerated holes and electrons could be excellently separated and rapidly transferred at the interface of ZIF-67 (core) and Co-MOF-74 (shell), resulting in effective increase in the interfacial charge transfer rate. Furthermore, this simple and novel method is also applicable to three other carboxylic acid ligands, which implies that it may be a general method that can be extended to other ligands for fabricating different core-shell ZIF-67@MOF crystals.									35	2	0	0	0	0	35			1466-8033			WOS:000452317200007

These carbons were synthesized by the carbonization of acridine and the co-carbonization of acridine and naphthol at elevated pressure (8 MPa), heat treatment temperature at 873 K and soak time of 1 h. The carbons were also calcined to a temperature of 1273 K at atmospheric pressure. Elemental analysis, optical microscopy, surface area (CO2, 273 K) and thermogravimetric analysis were employed to characterize the carbons. The reactivity and gas evolution profiles during gasification in 20% oxygen/argon mixture were studied in detail. The ratios of the concentrations of various masses were calculated. The results show that the NO/CO2 and NO/CO ratios increase substantially with increasing burn-off over the range of gasification temperatures (823-1273 K). The ratios also decrease with increasing gasification temperature in the range 823-1073 K. Small amounts of HCN were also detected and these also increase with increasing burn-off. The percentage of char nitrogen converted to NO and HCN also varies significantly with gasification temperature. The results suggest that during gasification of nitrogen in the char the concentrations of the nitrogen-containing species are varying relative to the carbon species with reaction temperature, heat treatment temperature and burn-off. The variation in NO/CO2 and NO/CO ratios with gasification temperature suggests that the char nitrogen conversion to NO is varying relative to other nitrogen species.									32	1	0	0	1	0	33			0016-2361			WOS:A1992JF07400002

Rational synthesis of BixFe(1-x)VO(4) heterostructures impregnated sulfur-doped g-C3N4: A visible-light-driven type-II heterojunction photo (electro)catalyst for efficient photodegradation of roxarsone and photoelectrochemical OER reactions								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				304						120852	10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120852				MAY 2022	2022	Metal vanadate (MVO4) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) semiconductor materials have attracted much interest due to their tremendous physicochemical and photocatalytic performances. In this prospect, BixFe(1_ x)VO(4) were prepared by mixing cation precursors (Bi and Fe) in different proportions (x = 0.7; 0.5; 0.3) via a simple one-pot hydrothermal route and impregnated on the surface of sulfur-doped g-C3N4(SCN) to attain a wide range of solar absorption and effective charge separation. Several spectroscopic techniques were used to analyze the physicochemical and optoelectronic properties of as-synthesized photocatalysts. The photocatalytic activities of as-synthesized photocatalysts were evaluated by photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and photodegradation of roxarsone (ROX). This work aims to investigate the formation, photocatalytic performance, and rational mechanism of BixFe1-xVO4/SCN photocatalytic nanocomposites. Among different BixFe(1_ x)VO(4) (x = 0.7; 0.5; 0.3), the BixFe(1_ x)VO(4)/SCN (Bi/Fe = 0.5) nanocomposite results in 85.66% of ROX photodegradation within 90 mins under visible-light irradiation. The photocatalytic performance of the nanocomposite is about 2.49, 2.87, 3.48 folds higher than that of pristine g-C3N4, BiVO4, and FeVO4 samples, respectively. The photo electrochemical OER results suggest the higher photocurrent density at 1.23 V (vs NHE) was achieved by BixFe(1_ x)VO(4)/SCN (0.987 mA cm(-2)) nanocomposite, and which is 16.73, 5.11, and 6.16 times higher than that of CN (0.059 mA cm(-2)), BiVO4 (0.193 mA cm(-2)), and FeVO4 (0.160 mA cm(-2)), respectively. The XPS and photo electrochemical (PEC) analysis depict the higher donor densities (ND) and excellent charge separations through type-II heterojunction of the BixFe(1_ x)VO(4) nanocomposite.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000787895000003

Such oxides may be useful as catalyst support materials to reduce noble metal catalyst loading (such as iridium) and to improve electrode durability. In this study, the titanium-based porous sheet acting as the Gas Diffusion Layer (GDL), on which its surface is naturally oxidized, is used as the support material. GDL-integrated electrodes with Ir-based electrocatalysts are developed. Two types of GDL-integrated electrodes were prepared with Ir-based electrocatalysts deposited by the Arc Plasma Deposition (APD) or the evaporation-to-dryness process. A higher Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) activity was obtained for electrodes prepared by the APD compared to those prepared by the evaporation-to-dryness process. Electrochemical activity and durability of the Ir-based electrocatalysts deposited on nanostructured surfaces of the porous Ti sheet in MEAs are characterized and discussed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1938-5862			INSPEC:20439326

We use the fact that nanolayered manganese oxides are among the strongest naturally occurring oxidants, capable of oxidizing a wide range of organic molecules. Post-treatment of the synthetic Mn oxides with oxidizable compounds increases the cerium(IV)-driven water oxidation catalyzed by treated layered manganese oxides more than 25 times. On the basis of X-ray absorption investigations, we attribute this effect to the increased amount of manganese(III) ions. This finding can explain some puzzles in water oxidation by manganese oxides and may help to advance toward an efficient design strategy of water-oxidizing catalyst in artificial photosynthetic systems.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000382713900068	27537432

The surface recombination phenomenon, which is one of the main issues of BiVO4, has been quantified by means of two distinct approaches: transient photocurrent measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This phenomenon has resulted to be higher in the porous material, thus a poorer performance has been observed than in the dense material. In order to increase the BiVO4 efficiency, a cobalt phosphate (CoPi) catalyst has been photo-electrodeposited onto the best BiVO4 electrode, employing an optimized technique and a photocurrent of up to 3 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE under neutral pH and 1 sun irradiation (100 mW/cm(2)) has been achieved. The charge transfer kinetics of the BiVO4 photoanodes, with and without CoPi, has also been quantified. The beneficial effect of this water oxidation catalyst, as well as the influence of the preparation method on the uniformity of the film and on its actual performance, is discussed in view of its prospective application in a real PEC device.

INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				53	13			6386	6397		10.1021/ic5002557				JUL 7 2014	2014	Water splitting by artificial catalysts is a critical process in the production of hydrogen gas as an alternative fuel. In this paper, we examine the essential role of theoretical calculations, with particular focus on density functional theory (DFT), in understanding the water-splitting reaction on these catalysts. First, we present an overview of DFT thermochemical calculations on water-splitting catalysts, addressing how these calculations are adapted to condensed phases and room temperature. We show how DFT-derived chemical descriptors of reactivity can be surprisingly good estimators for reactive trends in water-splitting catalysts. Using this concept, we recover trends for bulk catalysts using simple model complexes for at least the first-row transition-metal oxides. Then, using the CoPi cobalt oxide catalyst as a case study, we examine the usefulness of simulation for predicting the kinetics of water splitting. We demonstrate that the appropriate treatment of solvent effects is critical for computing accurate redox potentials with DFT, which, in turn, determine the rate-limiting steps and electrochemical overpotentials. Finally, we examine the ability of DFT to predict mechanism, using ruthenium complexes as a focal point for discussion. Our discussion is intended to provide an overview of the current strengths and weaknesses of the state-of-the-art DFT methodologies for condensed-phase molecular simulation involving transition metals and also to guide future experiments and computations toward the understanding and development of novel water-splitting catalysts.									98	3	0	0	11	0	100			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000338748100004	24694041	
J	Wu, Di; Zhang, Wen Yu; Feng, Hua Jie; Zhang, Zhong Jie; Chen, Xiang Ying; Cui, Peng								Mechanistic Insights into the Intermolecular Interaction and Li+ Solvation Structure in Small-Molecule Crowding Electrolytes for High-Voltage Aqueous Supercapacitors								ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS											10.1021/acsaem.2c01488		SEP 2022			2022	The introduction of a small-molecule crowding agent with low viscosity to expand the operating voltage of aqueous electrolytes is an effective strategy to achieving low-cost and high-voltage aqueous carbon-based supercapacitors (SCs). Herein, the electrochemical stable window (ESW) of a lithium nitrate electrolyte (2 M LiNO3) is expanded to 3.65 V after adding the water-miscible dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with high Gutmann donor number (29.8 kcal mol(-1)) as the crowding agent. The small-molecule crowding electrolyte (SMCE) has the advantages of low viscosity (3.87 mPa center dot s), wide temperature flexibility (-40 to 80 ?), better wettability to activated carbon (AC), and nonflammability. The reorganization of the Li+ solvation structure and the regulation of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) of water in a DMSO-induced highly crowded environment suppress the water decomposition on the charged electrode. In situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) shows that the detrimental hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) in SMCE are substantially inhibited. Molecular dynamics simulations (MDSs) indicate that the formation of a 1H(2)O-2DMSO molecular aggregate in SMCE destroys the H-bond network of water molecules. The SMCE enables symmetric SCs to deliver a high operating voltage of 2.4 V and an energy density of 44 Wh kg(-1) at 1.2 kW kg(-1).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000865408700001

Herein, the cross-linked polyphosphazene hollow spheres (PZM) were used as templates for the fabrication of 3D architecture. The 3D architecture based on Co2P-decorated heteroatom-doped carbon sphere and reduced graphene oxide was prepared via a carbonization procedure followed by a hydrothermal self-assembly strategy. The as-prepared material exhibits excellent catalytic activity with regard to the combustion process. Notably, inclusion of incorporating PZM@Co2P@RGO resulted in a dramatic reduction of the fire hazards of EP, such as a 47.9% maximum decrease in peak heat release rate and a 29.2% maximum decrease in total heat release, lower toxic CO yield, and formation of high-graphitized protective char layer. In addition, the mechanism for flame retardancy and toxicity suppression was proposed. It is reasonable to know that the improved flame-retardant performance for EP nanocomposites is attributed to tripartite cooperative effect from respective components (Co2P NPs and RGO) plus the heteroatom-doped carbon spheres.									39	3	0	0	6	0	41			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000389161600050	27933850

In addition, LCFSN has lower polarization resistance both in air, CO2 or H-2 compared with LCFN. Moreover, the SSOCs with LCFSN showed the maximum power densities of 0.332 and 0.234 W cm(-2) when operating in humidified hydrogen at 850 degrees C and 800 degrees C, respectively, and the cell shows maximum current densities of 1.093 A cm(-2) for CO2 electrolysis at 850 degrees C and 1.8 V. In addition, the cell also has good stability toward both fuel cell and electrolysis cell. Therefore, this work suggests that B site Sc doping is a promising approach to the redox-stable catalyst for SSOCs. (c) 2021 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

J	Shin, Heejong; Yoo, Ji Mun; Sung, Yung-Eun; Chung, Dong Young								Dynamic Electrochemical Interfaces for Energy Conversion and Storage								JACS AU											10.1021/jacsau.2c00385		OCT 2022			2022	Electrochemical energy conversion and storage are central to developing future renewable energy systems. For efficient energy utilization, both the performance and stability of electrochemical systems should be optimized in terms of the electrochemical interface. To achieve this goal, it is imperative to understand how a tailored electrode structure and electrolyte speciation can modify the electrochemical interface structure to improve its properties. However, most approaches describe the electrochemical interface in a static or frozen state. Although a simple static model has long been adopted to describe the electrochemical interface, atomic and molecular level pictures of the interface structure should be represented more dynamically to understand the key interactions. From this perspective, we highlight the importance of understanding the dynamics within an electrochemical interface in the process of designing highly functional and robust energy conversion and storage systems. For this purpose, we explore three unique classes of dynamic electrochemical interfaces: self-healing, active-site-hosted, and redox-mediated interfaces. These three cases of dynamic electrochemical interfaces focusing on active site regeneration collectively suggest that our understanding of electrochemical systems should not be limited to static models but instead expanded toward dynamic ones with close interactions between the electrode surface, dissolved active sites, soluble species, and reactants in the electrolyte. Only when we begin to comprehend the fundamentals of these dynamics through operando analyses can electrochemical conversion and storage systems be advanced to their full potential.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2691-3704		WOS:000868338700001	36311833

In this paper, perylene diimide (PDI), an electron-deficient building block for constructing n-type organic semiconductors, was introduced into the framework of g-C3N4 (PDI-g-C3N4) to build polymer with donor-acceptor structure for energy band amelioration, achieving the most expanded visible light response up to date. Besides, a large dihedral angle (90 degrees) induced by PDI moiety in PDI-g-C3N4 changes the molecular aggregation behavior according to calculations, which is advantageous to increase surface area for the reactive site exposure. The most promising functional photocatalyst PDI-g-C3N4/MIL is constructed by in-situ generation of NH2-MIL-53 (Fe) on the surface of PDI-g-C3N4 to further facilitate the separation and transfer of interfacial photo-induced carriers. Through a finely adjusting ratio of PDI-g-C3N4 in heterojunction, the target material of PDI-g-C3N4/MIL exhibits superior activity for the photodegradation of organic pollutants in the presence of H2O2 and visible light illumination, providing potential direction in practical application for wastewater treatment.

The phase composition and microstructure evolution were studied through examining the surficial and cross-sectional oxide layer by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The oxidized surfaces were covered by scattered TiO2 particles, a continuous B2O3 layer, a B2O3-Al2O3 layer or a mullite layer depending on the oxidation temperature. The thickness of the oxide layer increased from 10 to 30 mu m as the oxidation temperature increased from 900 to 1300 degrees C. The analysis of the weight gain data revealed that the parabolic rate constant of melt-infiltrated SiC-TiB2 ceramic composites generally increased from 4.05 x 10(-3) to 3.16 x 10(-1) mg(2)/cm(4)/s, accompanied with a changed oxidation nature from parabolic to cubic, as oxidation temperature increased from 500 to 1300 degrees C. Formation of continuous B2O3 or Al2O3-based (Al2O3-B2O3 or Al2O3-SiO2) layer were identified on the surface of SiC-TiB2 ceramic composites after being oxidized at 700-1300 degrees C, which was responsible for the excellent oxidation resistance of such composites. The oxidation rate of the melt-infiltrated SiC-TiB2 ceramic composites was controlled by reaction rate of the composites at 500 degrees C and diffusion rate of oxygen through continuous B2O3 or Al2O3-based layer to the unaffected composites at 700-1300 degrees C.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000623910300001

Herein, we report a facile fabrication of a variety of nanostructured transition metal sulphides (iron sulphides (FeS), cobalt sulphides (CoS), nickel sulphides (NiS), and copper sulphides (CuS)) on a bare nickel foam (NiF) substrate via a one-step electrochemical strategy. The fabricated FeS, CoS, NiS and CuS nanostructures were effectively employed as potential electrodes for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in presence of an alkaline electrolyte (1.0 M KOH). Our primary electrocatalytic OER study reveals that the FeS nanostructures exhibited the best activity in terms of low onset potential (similar to 1.51 V vs. RHE), small over-potential (eta) (similar to 0.32 V@10 mA cm(-2)), and Tafel slope (similar to 0.069 V dec(-1)), and high durability in comparison to the CoS, NiS and CuS nanostructures. A unique three-dimensional sheet-like morphology, high electrochemical active surface area (ECASA), low electrochemical impedance characteristics, rapid electron-transfer kinetics, and high structural solidity enable this novel FeS nanomaterial to be a distinct and promising electrode material for the OER activity. Thus, the complete electrocatalytic OER activity of the transition metal sulphide nanostructures follows the order: FeS > CoS > NiS > CuS. Our results on the optimized design of transition metal sulphide-derived electrodes based on the chemical composition, surface morphology, abundant active sites, etc., would further improve the OER activity for water electrolysis.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000526860500009

These properties are attractive for photo catalysis. Thin films of bismuth oxide containing vertically oriented and uniformly distributed nanopores of controllable dimensions were synthesized by a simple electrochemical anodization of a bismuth metal substrate in citric acid solution at 3-60 V. Annealing the anodic nanoporous Bi2O3 at 200 degrees C for 2 h resulted in stabilization of the metastable beta-Bi2O3 phase at room temperature. The nanoporous anodic oxides showed an energy bandgap of 2.48 eV, and n-type semiconductivity. Scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results suggested a dual layered structure of the anodic oxide with a nanoporous outer layer and a planar inner layer. Thickness of the inner layer predominantly influenced the impedance of the anodic oxide. Under simulated 1-sun intensity, a maximum photo current density of 0.97 mA/cm(2) was observed in 1 M KOH at a potential of 1.53 VRHE for the sample anodized at 10 V. A positive shift in the flatband potential upon illumination suggested accumulation of photo generated holes due to low catalytic activity of the anodic bismuth oxide for oxygen evolution reaction. The observed photo current density of the nanoporous anodic oxide of bismuth was an order of magnitude higher than that of the planar anodic oxide, and twice that of thin film beta-Bi2O3 prepared by reactive sputtering.

A growing number of academics are focusing their attention on developing and researching innovative materials for use in energy storage systems to promote sustainable development goals. This is due to the finite supply of traditional energy sources, such as oil, coal, and natural gas, and escalating regional tensions. Because of these issues, sustainable renewable energy sources have been touted as an alternative to nonrenewable fuels. Deployment of renewable energy sources requires efficient and reliable energy storage devices due to their intermittent nature. High-performance electrochemical energy storage technologies with high power and energy densities are heralded to be the next-generation storage devices. Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have sparked interest among electrode materials because of their intriguing electrochemical properties. Researchers have revealed a variety of modifications to improve their electrochemical performance in energy storage. However, a stronger link between the type of change and the resulting electrochemical performance is still desired. This review examines the synthesis of chalcogenides for electrochemical energy storage devices, their limitations, and the importance of the modification method, followed by a detailed discussion of several modification procedures and how they have helped to improve their electrochemical performance. We also discussed chalcogenides and their composites in batteries and supercapacitors applications. Furthermore, this review discusses the subject's current challenges as well as potential future opportunities.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1996-1073		WOS:000808924100001

The photocatalytic efficiency of g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-based materials involving H2 generation from H2O splitting depends on the separation and transport efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers. Transition metal modification on g-C3N4/N-doped carbon nanotube-based catalysts offer the possibility of enhancing photo-/electro-catalytic performances of the materials. This review summarizes a panorama of the recent advances in development of gC3N4/N-doped carbon nanotube based catalysts including (1) synthesis of tubular g-C3N4 based catalysts via various methods, e. g., templating method and non-metal and transition metal doping; (2) construction of nanotubes with enhanced photo/electro-chemical water splitting efficiency and investigation of the effects of nonmetal doping on the substrates; (3) the effect of transition metals (e.g., transition metal single atom and metal alloy) modification on the catalytic performances of the nanotubes; (4) recent development in construction of g-C3N4/N-doped carbon nanotube based heterostructures and the photocatalytic applications of the composite materials.

However, precisely controlled growth of such unique heterostructures without disturbing the monolayer graphene characteristics remains a challenging task especially over a large area with good uniformity. Herein, ultrathin metal-oxide (p-Co3O4 and nZnO) nanostructures (MONSs) integrated graphene monolayer (GML) heterostructures are carefully developed by fascinating the graphene native defects while nucleation and growth of MONSs. Metal-oxides integrated graphene monolayers with lower material densities (<= 30 mu g/cm(2)) significantly enhanced the quality (2D/G-5-9) and reduced the electrical resistance (11-17 omega/sq.) of graphene layers, whereas the heterostructures developed with higher densities possess predominant water-oxidation characteristics than that of their individual components. Further, the Co3O4/GML heterostructures-based micro-supercapacitors, fabricated over 25 mu m polyimide sheets, showed excellent mechanical stability and flexibility with a volumetric and specific capacitance of 7.76 F/cm(3) and 1.27 F/g, respectively. The ZnO/GML heterostructures designed over micron thick parylene film displayed exciting photoresistor characteristics with photosensitivity of similar to 1.54 and superb flexibility and skin-mountability. Synergistic multifunctional characteristics of these ultrathin heterostructures offer the possibility to realize various eco-friendly ultrathin as well as skin-mountable energy and health monitoring devices.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000704000800003		
J	Wan, Hongyan; Yuan, Liqun; Zhang, Yu								Insight Into the Leaching of Sodium Alumino-Silicate Hydrate (N-A-S-H) Gel: A Molecular Dynamics Study								FRONTIERS IN MATERIALS				7						56	10.3389/fmats.2020.00056				MAR 24 2020	2020	This paper provides an intrinsic mechanism for alkali dissolution from the gels of geopolymers at the nanoscale, via a molecular dynamics (MD) investigation on N-A-S-H gel, the predominant binding phase in geopolymers. Sodium plays roles in balancing the charges of [AlO4] tetrahedrons, and its absence causes local structures to show a negative charge, resulting in locally mutual repulsion between tetrahedrons. Also, sodium dissociation promotes a hydrolytic reaction, exacerbating the non-conservation of charge of the N-A-S-H system, further swelling the structure. The above evolution weakens the alumino-silicate skeleton and reduces the stability of silicate and aluminate species, which in turn promotes sodium dissociation. In the long term, it increases the potential of structure depolymerization and even peeling off. Based on previously reported experiments and our computational results, it is likely that leaching starts from the N-A-S-H substrate surface, and the gel peels off layer by layer in the above manner, resulting in microscopic holes and fissures. In addition, leaching also leads to the degradation of the mechanical properties of the surface gel, including Young's modulus, tensile strength, and ductility, which considerably increases the possibility of surface gel peeling. Additionally, sodium is able to connect [AlO4] and [SiO4] tetrahedrons by the electrostatic force with tetrahedral oxygen, which transfers stress and contributes to uniform stress dispersion.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2296-8016			WOS:000596905000001

Photocatalytic and electrocatalytic N-2 reduction reaction (NRR) to NH3 production using sustainable energy sources are fascinating approaches to respond to these issues. However, the state-of-the-art photocatalysis and electrocatalysis toward NH3 production is far away from the industrial requirement because of poor catalytic activity. Hence, rationally designed high-efficiency catalysts are urgently demanded to promote practical applications. Polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) has drawn considerable focus because of its unusual properties, such as visible-light response and high pyridinic nitrogen content. This Review provides the most recent progress on constructing PCN-based photocatalysts and electrocatalysts via various design strategies, including vacancy creations, doping, and incorporation, to mediate its applications in NRR. On the basis of theoretical simulations, the insights into mechanism pathways of photocatalytic and electrocatalytic NH3 evolution are presented to provide guidance for engineering PCN-based catalysts. Subsequently, the remaining challenges and future prospects of further development in this research field are also highlighted. It can be foreseen that this Review will shed some light on the development of more potential PCN-based catalysts toward NRR and offer instructive information for further understanding the structure-performance correlations.									80	5	0	0	4	0	80			2155-5435			WOS:000494549700052

Herein, we demonstrated the synthesis of novel porous AuPtPd nanocrystals (NCs) via plausible one-pot synthesis route. This was implemented by reduction of the metal precursors with L-ascorbic acid in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a structure-directing agent. TEM (transmission electron microscopy) images of the assynthesized nanocrystals depicted porous nanodendritic morphology with particle size ranging from 20 to 30 nm. The catalytic performance of AuPtPd NCs was investigated towards glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) in alkaline medium compared to AuPt, PtPd, and Pt/C. The delivered maximum oxidation current density over AuPtPd was 10.1 mA cm(-2), which is nearly 1.4, 1.8, and 3.5 times greater than AuPt, PtPd, and Pt/C, respectively. Additionally, the ternary electrocatalyst exhibited higher electrochemical stability compared to binary alloys and Pt/C counterparts. Furthermore, AuPtPd revealed lower Tafel slope for GOR compared to binary alloys and Pt/C which affirm enhanced GOR kinetics. The outstanding catalytic performance of AuPtPd NCs was attributed to the synergistic effect of the alloying elements and the high anti-poisoning effect of Au and Pd metals which facilitates the adsorption of surface hydroxyls (OH)(ads) on the catalyst active sites and enhances the oxidation kinetics.

In particular, calcium and aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) found in chondrites are key minerals for decoding the initial conditions of the solar system before the accretion of small planetary bodies. In this study, we report isotopic analyses for three Allende CAIs, fluffy type A (FTA), type B, and fine-grained spinel rich (FS) inclusions, with a specific emphasis on the measurements of Sr-84/Sr-86 ratios. It was found that the average mu Sr-84 values (106 relative deviations from a standard material) were 175, 129, and 56 ppm for the samples of FTA, type B, and FS inclusions, respectively. Additionally, the FTA samples exhibited heterogeneous mu Sr-84 values, while those for the type B and FS inclusions were homogeneous within individual inclusions. The elevated mu Sr-84 values were most likely explained by the relative enrichment of r-process nuclides in the CAI formation region. The variation of mu Sr-84 values between the FTA and type B inclusions, as well as within the FTA inclusion, suggests the presence of multiple CAI source reservoirs with distinct isotopic compositions, which is either inherited from isotopic heterogeneity in the molecular cloud or caused by the selective destruction of r-process-enriched supernova grains via nebular thermal processing. On the other hand, the reaction between a refractory precursor of the FS inclusion and a gaseous reservoir enriched in Mg, Si, and O-16 resulted in the lowest mu Sr-84 values for the FS inclusion.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000423209300012

This approach is the only reliable method for HCV-RNA tissue localization, being helpful in early diagnosis.HCV infected liver is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate including CD4+, CD8+, and B lymphocytes. Evidence has been provided that in HCV patients CD8+ cell response is associated with low level of viraemia and higher level of disease activity. CD4+ T cells exhibit specificity for the core antigen, also correlating with disease activity and viraemia. Costimulatory molecules, cytokines, oxygen radicals, the complex Fas/Fas-ligand and soluble class I HLA structures are discussed as putative cofactors involved in disease evolution.Various forms of interferon (IFN)-alpha have been evaluated for the treatment of patients with HCV infection. Initial enthusiasm has been attenuated by the evidence of a low sustained virological response rate and the constant side effects of IFN-alpha therapy in patients with chronic HCV disease.Among possible markers for predicting therapeutic outcome in HCV-positive individuals, anti-core antibodies correlate positively with response to IFN-alpha. administration, as well as reduction of interleukin-2 serum levels has been detected in patients with a good therapeutic response. Association between HCV infection and autoimmune phenomena, also in relation to IFN-alpha therapy has been reported. Finally, results of the combined treatment with IFN-alpha/ribavirin are illustrated.									10	0	0	0	11	0	11			1381-6128	1873-4286		WOS:000085449900003	10637375

The best-fit CTR model indicates Sb(V) adsorbs at the surface as an inner-sphere complex forming a tridentate binding geometry with the nearest Sb-Fe distance of 3.09(4) angstrom and an average Sb-O bond length of 2.08(5) angstrom. In this binding geometry, Sb is bound at both edge-sharing and corner-sharing sites of the surface Fe-O octahedral units. The chemical plausibility of the proposed structure was further verified by bond valence analysis, which also deduced a protonation scheme for surface O groups. The stoichiometry of the surface reaction predicts the release of one OH- group at pH 5.5.									17	1	0	0	7	0	18			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000446542100029	30188697

Immunoblotting experiments showed that the absence of PSII activity in the mutant was due to the loss of the PSII complex in both light-grown and dark-grown cultures. In contrast, the photosystem one reaction center polypeptide, PsaA, was present at wild-type levels in the mutant. RNA gel blot assays confirmed that the transcript levels for the psbA, psbD, and psbP genes were unaffected by disruption of the psbE gene, suggesting a post-transcriptional effect on their expression. Pulse-labeling experiments showed that either synthesis of PSII subunits was impaired in the psbE null mutant or there was extremely rapid degradation of newly synthesized subunits, Interestingly, the PsbE and PsbF subunits accumulated to wild-type levels in a psbA deletion mutant of C, reinhardtii, FuD7, which fails to synthesize D1 and assemble PSII, Our results provide evidence for a role for cytochrome b-559 in the early steps of assembly of the PSII complex, possibly as a redox-controlled nucleation factor that determines the level of PSII within the thylakoid membrane.									67	4	1	0	60	0	72			0021-9258			WOS:000076798300008	9792631

Different types of single-atom sites can be fabricated via multiple preparation strategies, which would demonstrate distinct different coordination configurations and electronic features, and ultimately affected the structure-catalysis relationship of SACs in targeted reactions. As a result, it is necessary to identify the active sites of SACs and understand the structure-catalysis relationship of SACs at the atomic scale. In this review, a variety of preparation strategies of carbon-based SACs were documented. Then, the recent development on versatile characterization techniques and computational achievements were summarized regarding in understanding the electronic and geometric characteristics of carbon-based SACs. Finally, major challenges and development directions concerning single-atom sites identification and advanced tools development are discussed to shed light on future research of carbon-based SACs.

Accordingly, it is of fundamental importance to determine the direct relationship between catalytic performance and metal-support interactions. Herein, we provide a quantitative profile for exploring metal-support interactions by considering the highest occupied state in single-atom catalysts. The catalyst studied consisted of isolated Rh atoms dispersed on the surface of VO2 nanorods. It was observed that the activation energy of ammonia-borane hydrolysis changed when the substrate underwent a phase transition. Mechanistic studies indicate that the catalytic performance depended directly on the highest occupied state of the single Rh atoms, which was determined by the band structure of the substrates. Other metal catalysts, even with non-noble metals, that exhibited significant catalytic activity towards NH3BH3 hydrolysis were rationally designed by adjusting their highest occupied states.									146	5	0	0	9	0	145			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000398576000003	28370955

In this system, the degradation of organic pollutants occurs by attack of hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) which are produced from the reaction of added ferrous catalyst (Fe2+) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrogene rated by oxygen reduction at carbon felt cathode. The degradative efficiency of EF system was comparatively studied versus anodic oxidation method (AO) in absence and presence of H2O2, It was found that only EF is sufficiently powerful to induce fast and efficient mineralization of rotenone and its degradation intermediates.The mineralization of rotenone was found to depend largely on organic solvent type, metal ion catalyst, applied current and initial rotenone concentration. The best operative conditions are achieved using aqueous-acetonitrile mixture of pH 3.0 in the presence of 0.2 mM Fe2+ catalyst with a current intensity of 100 mA. Under these optimized conditions, 30 min were sufficient to completely degrade rotenone in 100 mL of a 20 mg L-1 solution. A nearly complete mineralization (similar to 96% of COD removal) was achieved after 8 h treatment.Rotenone removal kinetic was found to obey the pseudo-first order model and the absolute second order rate constant (k(Rot) = 2.49 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1)) for the reaction between the substrate and (OH)-O-center dot was derived.HPLC-MS and HPLC-DAD analysis were applied to identify and follow the evolution of rotenone oxidation products. Three stable aromatic intermediates were observed and two of these were identified as 12a beta-hydroxyrotenone and hydroquinone. Subsequent attack of these intermediates by (OH)-O-center dot radicals leads to the formation of aliphatic carboxylic acids such as succinic, acetic, oxalic and formic, quantified by ion-exclusion chromatography.

The present study demonstrates for the first time an efficient formation of formate from CO2 in a photo-assisted MES system utilizing the activated carbon fiber (ACF)-supported g-C3N4-NiCoWO4 photoanode and g-C(3)N(4 )biocathode. The prepared NiCoWO4-g-C3N4/ACF formed a Z-scheme heterojunction resulting in the enhanced suppression of electron-hole pairs. Several characterization techniques confirm a successful incorporation of NiCoWO4 over g-C3N4/ACF. Atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed high chemical stability of photoanode without any metal leaching in the reaction medium. Cyclic voltammetry test showed an improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the photo anode with a significantly low overpotential (-0.12 V). Transient photocurrent measurements showed-1.05 times higher photocurrent for NiCoWO4-g-C3N4/ACF relative to g-C3N4/ACF upon illumination of light, demonstrating the formation of the Z-scheme heterojunction between NiCoWO4 and g-C3N4/ACF. The band alignment, scavenger analysis, and electron spin resonance spectroscopy results further confirmed the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism. Approximately 12.8 mM of formate was synthesized per day in the MES system under visible light irradiation, which is approximately twice that in dark. The solar to formate conversion efficiency was determined to be 1.48%. The proposed mechanism indicates the photoinduced holes-initiated OER at the photoanode, and the release of formate dehydrogenase by Escherichia coli, isolated from a wastewater, at the biocathode. This study provides an efficient supported photoanode for harvesting solar light, combined with a biocathode in the MES cell for achieving a sustainable high rate of biochemicals formation.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000806471100002

However, it is very likely to further improve the electrochemical performance since the adsorption behavior of the Ni0.2Mo0.8N on catalytic intermediates has not reached a satisfactory level. Herein, we designed and developed a novel V doped hexagonal Ni0.2Mo0.8N electrode (denoted as V-Ni0.2Mo0.8N) which exhibits superior water splitting performances (39 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 245 mV at 25 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER respectively). Combined with the density function theory calculations, the improvement of the water splitting performance is attributed to the optimized water adsorption energy, water dissociation energy barrier, active hydrogen adsorption free energy, oxygen-containing intermediates adsorption free energies and increased electronic states density near the Fermi level. Finally, the assembled water splitting system exhibits low overpotential (1.52 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) and excellent durability.									74	5	0	0	6	0	74			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000510526000048

Mechanistic studies of redox hopping transport in MOFs reveal characteristics that recall pioneering studies in linear redox polymers. When MOFs are employed as electrocatalysts, consideration must be given to both the catalytic properties - turn-over frequency (TOF) and energetic requirements (overpotential, TON) - and the charge transport properties - rate of charge hopping, measured via an apparent diffusion coefficient (D-app). Herein, we provide a mathematical framework to provide constraints to MOF catalyst development by relating D-app, TOF, and film thickness in the context of providing 10 mA cm(-2) of catalytic current. Lastly with the mechanistic studies discussed as a foundation, design rules for future MOF electrocatalysts are provided and the challenges to the community to optimize MOF charge transport are laid out.									95	2	0	0	9	0	94			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000436091600001	29809219

Treatment with hydrazine hydrate as cross-linking agents followed by adsorption of metal ions endows PAN fibers with excellent flame retardancy. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was employed to investigate the evolution of the chemical structure of the fibers. The atomic adsorption spectrometer (AAS) was carried out to study the adsorption capacity for copper ions. The wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to study the aggregate structure and morphology of the fibers. In addition, LOI, thermogravimetric analysis/infrared spectrometry (TG-FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were employed to clarify the flame-retardancy and the mechanisms. The mechanical property was studied via a single fiber tensile tester. The results showed that more chelating groups arose in macromolecular chains of PAN fibers after the reaction with hydrazine hydrate, with increased adsorption capacity for Cu2+. The LOI reached 24.0% after the treatment of hydrazine hydrate and the fiber was still flammable in the air. After the treatment with metal ions, the LOI of the fibers dramatically rose to 45.2%. The thermal decomposition process differed after the treatment of hydrazine hydrate, resulting in a more violent release of ammonia and a sharp reduction of flammable gases. The introduction of copper ions made fibers form dense carbon residue during thermal decomposition, which was beneficial for the improvement of flame retardancy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0040-5000	1754-2340		WOS:000813644100001

Although carbon materials are widely used as catalyst supports and conductive additives for metal oxide catalysts in the catalyst layer (CL) and as the main active constituent in the gas-diffusion layer (GDL), the carbon is oxidized during the charge step, causing degradation of the air electrode. In this study, carbon-free air electrodes were prepared using electro-conductive oxides, namely, indium tin oxide or antimony-doped tin oxide, as an alternative to carbon materials in both the CL and GDL to achieve reversibility and durability of the air electrode in zinc-air batteries. While the initial performance of the carbon-free air electrodes was inferior to that of the carbon-based air electrodes, the lifetime of the carbon-free air electrodes was remarkably longer. These results indicate a critical role of electro-conductive oxides in both the CL and GDL for durable air electrodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000805142800001

On this basis, a higher demand has been proposed for the preparation of novel-structured MOFs. Hollow MOFs have been intensively studied and exhibited versatile properties, and among the various methods, secondary-component incorporation has been proved promising in the design and preparation of complex structures with requisite properties. Herein, the synthesis and applications of secondary component incorporated MOFs and their derivatives are systematically reviewed. Two main methodologies, preincorporation and postmodification, are discussed in detail, and the role of the secondary component is demonstrated. Based on these introductions, the applications of those materials, including chemical catalysis, electrocatalysis, and energy storage applications, are summarized.

Waste rubber tires were mixed in different proportions with metallurgical coke (MC) (10:90, 20:80, 30:70) for combustion and pyrolysis at 1473 K in a drop tube furnace (DTF) and thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), respectively. Under experimental conditions most of the rubber blends indicated higher combustion efficiencies compared. to those of the constituent coke. In the early stage of combustion the weight loss rate of the blends is much faster compared to that of the raw coke due to the higher volatile yield of rubber. The presence of rubber in the blends may have had an impact upon the structure during the release and combustion of their high volatile matter (VM) and hence increased char burnout. Measurements of micropore surface area and bulk density of the chars collected after combustion support the higher combustion efficiency of the blends in comparison to coke alone. The surface morphology of the 30% rubber blend revealed pores in the residual char that might be attributed to volatile evolution during high temperature reaction in oxygen atmosphere. Physical properties and VM appear to have a major effect upon the measured combustion efficiency of rubber blends. The study demonstrates that waste rubber tires can be successfully co-injected with metallurgical coke in electric are furnace steelmaking process to provide additional energy from combustion.									29	1	0	0	2	1	29			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000267416600018

The compositions of the zeolite matrices were very similar, with nominal Si/Al and Si/Fe ratios of 36 and 152, respectively. Removal of the template by calcination leads to extensive dealummation in Fe-beta, while having no influence on the state of aluminum in Fe-ZSM-5. Steam treatment was required to massively create extra-framework Al species in the latter sample. In contrast, the sensitivity of framework iron to migration into non-framework positions during postsynthesis treatments and the nature and distribution of the resulting iron species were remarkably analogous in the two zeolite structures. Catalytic tests with direct N2O decomposition and N2O reduction with CO over the steamed iron zeolites confirmed that the microporous matrix intrinsically does not play a decisive role on the activity in these reactions, provided that the resulting forms of iron are similar.

Detection of abundant O-2 at 1-10% relative to H2O ice in the comae of comets 1P/Halley and 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has motivated attempts to explain the origin of the high O-2 ice abundance. Recent chemical modelling of the outer, colder regions of a protoplanetary disk midplane has shown production of O-2 ice at the same abundance as that measured in the comet.Aims. We aim to carry out a thorough investigation to constrain the conditions under which O-2 ice could have been produced through kinetic chemistry in the pre-solar nebula midplane.Methods. We have utilised an updated chemical kinetics code to evolve chemistry under pre-solar nebula midplane conditions. Four different chemical starting conditions and the effects of various chemical parameters have been tested.Results. Using the fiducial network, and for either reset conditions (atomic initial abundances) or atomic oxygen only conditions, the abundance level of O-2 ice measured in the comets can be reproduced at an intermediate time, after 0.1-2 Myr of evolution, depending on ionisation level. When including O-3 chemistry, the abundance of O-2 ice is much lower than the cometary abundance (by several orders of magnitude). We find that H2O2 and O-3 ices are abundantly produced (at around the level of O-2 ice) in disagreement with their respective abundances or upper limits from observations of comet 67P. Upon closer investigation of the parameter space, and varying parameters for grain-surface chemistry, it is found that for temperatures 15-25 K, densities of 10(9)-10(10) cm(-3), and a barrier for quantum tunnelling set to 2 angstrom, the measured level of O-2 ice can be reproduced with the new chemical network, including an updated binding energy for atomic oxygen (1660 K). However, the abundances of H2O2 and O-3 ices still disagree with the observations. A larger activation energy for the O + O-2 -> O-3 reaction (E-act > 1000 K) helps to reproduce the non-detection of O-3 ice in the comet, as well as reproducing the observed abundances of H2O2 and O-2 ices. The only other case in which the O-2 ice matches the observed abundance, and O-3 and H2O2 ice are lower, is the case when starting with an appreciable amount of oxygen locked in O-2.Conclusions. The parameter space investigation revealed a sweet spot for production of O-2 ice at an abundance matching those in 67P and 1P, and O-3 and H2O2 ice abundances matching those in 67P. This means that there is a radial region in the pre-solar nebula from 120-150 AU, within which O-2 could have been produced in situ via ice chemistry on grain surfaces. However, it is apparent that there is a high degree of sensitivity of the chemistry to the assumed chemical parameters (e.g. binding energy, activation barrier width, and quantum tunnelling barrier). Hence, because the more likely scenario starting with a percentage of elemental oxygen locked in O-2 also reproduces the O-2 ice abundance in 67P at early stages, this supports previous suggestions that the cometary O-2 ice could have a primordial origin.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1432-0746			WOS:000455270900002

We here introduce a convenient and economic method for manufacturing stable and highly efficient manganese-oxide-based anodes for electrochemical water oxidation under neutral conditions. The electrodes were fabricated through thermal decomposition of acidic KMnO4 solution. The phase transitions of the manganese oxide film during calcination and thermal decomposition of KMnO4 were monitored with in situ heating transmission electron microscopy (TEM), in situ heating scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM/EDX), and in situ heating powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). In-depth monitoring of formation pathways and phase transformations by in situ techniques under high temperatures shed light upon the fabrication of efficient manganese oxides for energy conversion applications. After parameter optimizations, the best-performing manganese oxide catalyst was applied for water electrolysis for 100 h with a stable current density of 1.0 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 490 mV in neutral pH. Post operando characterizations of key oxide film properties showed no significant changes. The readily commercially available precursor enables a simple and rapid fabrication method, and the promising stability and high performance of the herein developed electrodes render them quite promising for technological water splitting systems.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000626844200006

Herein, we report low cost porous iron-based oxides derived from calcining precursors of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) M-x[Fe(CN)(6)](y) (M = Fe, Co, Ni). This synthesis approach involves a simple self-assembly technology and a low-temperature annealing procedure. These catalysts were investigated for photocatalytic, cerium(IV)-driven, and electrochemical water oxidation, and they exhibited superior activity. It is noteworthy that this photocatalytic water oxidation was conducted under neutral conditions that are similar to the natural photosystem II. The high initial turnover frequency (TOF) of similar to 5.4 x 10(-4) s(-1) per transition metal atom at the first 60 s is obtained under neutral pH using porous CoxFe3-xO4 in photocatalytic water oxidation reaction, which is comparable with those published iron-based catalysts. Under cerium(IV)-driven water oxidation conditions, the TOF of porous CoxFe3-xO4 is 5.2 x 10(-4) s(-1) per transition metal atom, which is the highest value among all the documented iron oxides. In the electrochemical water oxidation, the porous NixFe3-xO4 catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 402 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, the porous iron-based oxides possess beneficial ferromagnetic properties and excellent stability so that they were used repeatedly without loss in activity.									26	2	0	0	0	0	26			1932-7447			WOS:000368562200062

The simulation results show that the C-O bond is weaker than the other bonds, agreeing with its smaller bond dissociation energy (BDE). The ring-opening position of the aliphatic ring is usually determined by the stability of free radicals formed in this process. For aromatic hydrocarbons, the long-chain substituents are found to be easier to leave and the cleavage of C-C bonds leads to a series of chain reactions and the formation of small fragments, such as ethylene and propylene. The bond cleavages are almost in accordance with the minimum bonding energy rule. NVT simulations show that the pyrolysis process progresses in two stages: the decomposition of kerogen into heavy (C40+.) species and then the generation of light compounds. Recombinations and rearrangements of different fragments are also observed via MD simulations. The main hydrocarbon fragments of C-10-C-20 are regarded as the component or precursor of diesel oil. The formation pathways of typical aromatic components are analyzed by tracking the motion trajectories of relevant structures. The intermediates and products in MD simulations are found to be similar to the gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) results from previous experiments.					15th International Conference on Petroleum Phase Behavior and Fouling (Petrophase)15th International Conference on Petroleum Phase Behavior and Fouling (Petrophase)	JUN 08-12, 2014JUN 08-12, 2014	Rice Univ; Baker HughesRice Univ; Baker Hughes	Galveston, TXGalveston, TX	43	3	0	0	0	0	45			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000355158200028

The method is based on the evanescent wave spectroscopy using an infrared fibre, and allows one to analyse the molecular structure of a growing plasma polymer film in the process reactor. The styrene plasma polymerization on a fibre in the plasma bulk of a capacitively coupled rf discharge was studied. The infrared fibre sensor provides higher sensitivity than the crystals of comparable geometry usually employed in attenuated total reflection spectroscopy. Accumulated evanescent wave infrared absorption spectra give information not only on the molecular structure of the deposited films, but also on its time evolution during the deposition. It was also possible to make conclusions on the molecular orientation of plasma polymerized styrene films deposited under the various process conditions. The fibre was regenerated in an oxygen plasma. The etching process results in the destruction of phenyl rings and the ablation of the plasma polymer film from the surface of the fibre core.									9	0	0	0	4	0	9			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000168783300009

Widespread rehydration of metapelitic granulites under conditions of 660-600 degrees C and greater than or equal to 0.6 GPa, and CO2-dominated fluid-inclusion populations appear to suggest thorough flushing of the high-grade crust with an externally derived carbonic fluid. However, past studies of the carbon and oxygen isotope geochemistry of the hydrated rocks have not demonstrated the involvement of any voluminous 'out of equilibrium' fluid in the evolution of the rocks. This contribution proposes a model wherein the hydrating fluids are derived from crystallizing anatectic leucosomes, generated by in situ fluid-absent biotite melting along the prograde path. Model equilibrium fluid compositions suggest that reaction between this melt-derived H2O and biogenic graphite produced CO2-rich fluid compositions and potentially high fluid:rock ratios at the wet granite solidus. Declining temperature resulted in fluid compositions shifting to higher XH(2)O, with the precipitation of graphite essentially at the sites of initial fluid generation, thereby preserving original (pre-metamorphic) isotopic heterogeneities. The hydration pattern of the Southern Marginal Zone appears to be a function of melt migration. In the hydrated zone, leucosomes generally approximate minimum melt compositions and in this zone H2O was effectively recycled between the prograde and retrograde assemblages. In contrast, leucosomes in the granulite grade portion of the terrane have lost a K2O- and H2O-rich melt fraction, and although some hydration has occurred in this zone, orthopyroxene is generally preserved in metapelites. In a general context, in situ crystallization of graphitic partially melted source rocks has the potential to produce high fluid-rock ratios at temperatures close to the wet granite solidus. This single process holds the potential for widespread retrogression of formerly high-grade assemblages, at a variety of aH(2)O values, without external fluid input.									39	3	0	0	0	0	42			0263-4929			WOS:A1997VY56300011

The aim of the present work was to examine, with the help of the photoacoustic technique, whether this high-light treatment deteriorated the in vivo PS I function too. High-frequency photoacoustic measurements indicated that photochemical conversion of far-red light energy in PS I was preserved (and even transiently stimulated) whereas photochemical energy storage monitored in light exciting both PS I and PS II was markedly diminished. Low-frequency photoacoustic measurements of the Emerson enhancement showed a spectacular change in the PS II/PS I activity balance in favor of PS I. It was also observed that the linear portion of the saturation curve of the far-red light effect in the Emerson enhancement was not changed by the light treatment. Those results lead to the conclusion that, in contrast to PS II, the in vivo PS I photofunctioning was resistant to strong light stress, thus confirming previous suggestions derived from in vitro studies. Estimation of the redox state of the PS I reaction center by leaf absorbance measurements at ca. 820 nm suggested that, under steady illumination, a considerably larger fraction of PS I centers were in the closed state in high-light pretreated leaves as compared to control leaves, presumably allowing passive adjustment of the macroscopic quantum yield of PS I photochemistry to the strongly reduced photochemical efficiency of photoinhibited PS II.									31	2	0	0	26	0	32			0939-5075			WOS:A1991GZ16700011

JOURNAL OF PHYSICS G-NUCLEAR AND PARTICLE PHYSICS				47	9					095001	10.1088/1361-6471/ab9a0e				SEP 2020	2020	It is conventionally argued that dark matter (DM) has a non-baryonic nature, but if we assume that DM was frozen out before primordial nucleosynthesis and could not significantly impact primordial abundances this argument may be evaded. Then a hypothetical SU(3) flavor-singlet, highly symmetric, deeply bound neutral scalar hexaquark S = uuddss, which due to its features has escaped from experimental detection so far, may be considered as a candidate for a baryonicDM. In the presentwork we calculate themass and coupling constant of the scalar six-quark particle S by means of the QCD sum rule method. Our predictions for its mass are m(S) = 1180(-26)(+40) MeV (m(s) = 95 MeV) and (m) over tilde (S) = 1239(-28)(+42) MeV (m(s) = 128 MeV). Although these values of mass would produce thermally the cosmologicalDMabundance, existence of this state may contradict the stability of the oxygen nuclei, which requires further thorough analysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0954-3899	1361-6471		WOS:000555607900001

Here, we describe the development of a molecular-based anode for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) through noncovalent integration of a DuBois type Ni bioinspired molecular catalyst at the surface of a carbon nanotube modified gas diffusion layer. This mild immobilization strategy enabled us to gain high control over the loading in catalytic sites. Additionally, through the adjustment of the hydration level of the active layer, a new record current density of 214 +/- 20 mA cm(-2) could be reached at 0.4 V vs RHE with the PGM-free anode, at 25 degrees C. Near industrially relevant current densities were obtained at 55 degrees C with 150 +/- 20 and 395 +/- 30 mA cm(-2) at 0.1 and 0.4 V overpotentials, respectively. These results further demonstrate the relevance of such molecular approaches for the development of electrocatalytic platforms for energy conversion.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000715845900033	34677065

In this study, we model EtOH decomposition on close-packed Pd-Au catalytic surfaces using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and derived Bronsted Evans Polanyi (BEP) relationships. Three characteristic Pd Au surfaces are considered, Pd1Au2(111), Pd2Au1(111), and a Pd monolayer (ML), PdML(111), on a Au substrate. We show that, on close-packed Pd Au surfaces, the C-C bond is easier to cleave than C-O, indicating that the formation of CH4 and CO is favored as the products of EtOH decomposition. Interestingly, we find that, though the C-C and C-O activation barriers on Pd-ML(111) are generally lower than those on the other two surfaces, it is less active for EtOH decomposition due to a slow release of H-2 and possible carbon coking. Pd2Au,(111), on the other hand, has a higher theoretical reaction rate due to facile H-2 evolution from the surface and less carbon coking. A comparison of the surface d-band with the activation energy barriers shows that there is a trade-off between the barriers for C-C bond cleavage and H-2 association, with Pd2Au1(111) having the best performance. Temperature-programmed desorption experiments of EtOH on Pd/Au surfaces show significant C-C bond cleavage and both CH4 and CO production on surfaces with Pd Au interface sites. Furthermore, neither Auger electron spectroscopy nor EtOH reflection adsorption infrared spectroscopy provide evidence of C-O bond cleavage. Finally, the experimental reaction rate for methane production from C-C bond cleavage was higher on surfaces with more Au present due to minimal carbon contamination and the promotion of product desorption. This combined theoretical and experimental study shows that, though Au is catalytically inactive for EtOH decomposition, it can dramatically promote the surface activity for EtOH steam reforming due to the existence of active Pd Au surface ensemble sites.									68	1	0	0	4	0	68			1932-7447			WOS:000446141900036

The high variability of the heart rate, correlating with the respiratory cycle, was observed. Many adaptational changes were marked in the cardiac functions which cause a negative chronotropic reaction of the heart. On submersion the animals showed a bradycardiac reflex when the heart rate was as slow as 25 beats per minute. On surfacing the compensatory tachycardia (120-140 beats per minute) developed. The ECG pattern changed according to the heart rate. The complex changes of the heart bioelectrical activity during the dolphins diving can be considered as ecologically conditioned adaptational responses, developed in the course of adaptationgenesis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0044-5134			WOS:A1992HM98100013

Here we argue that our still limited understanding of the structure of active sites is one of the major bottlenecks towards an ever extended and reliable use of such computational screening for catalyst discovery. For low-index transition metal surfaces, the prevalently chosen high-symmetry (terrace and step) sites offered by the nominal bulk-truncated crystal lattice might be justified. For more complex surfaces and composite catalyst materials, computational screening studies will need to actively embrace a considerable uncertainty with respect to what truly are the active sites. By systematically exploring the space of possible active site motifs, such studies might eventually contribute towards a targeted design of optimized sites in future catalysts.

The origin, dynamics and implications of the changes for the catalysts' activity inside fuel cells though are not well understood. This is largely because they are studied on model nanoalloy structures under controlled laboratory conditions. Here we use combined synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy and total scattering to study the dynamic behaviour of nanoalloys of Pt with 3d-transition metals as they function at the cathode of an operating proton exchange membrane fuel cell. Results show that the composition and atomic structure of the nanoalloys change profoundly, from the initial state to the active form and further along the cell operation. The electrocatalytic activity of the nanoalloys also changes. The rate and magnitude of the changes may be rationalized when the limits of traditional relationships used to connect the composition and structure of nanoalloys with their electrocatalytic activity and stability, such as Vegard's law, are recognized. In particular, deviations from the law inherent for Pt-3d metal nanoalloys can well explain their behaviour under operating conditions. Moreover, it appears that factors behind the remarkable electrocatalytic activity of Pt-3d metal nanoalloys, such as the large surface to unit volume ratio and size misfit of the constituent Pt and 3d-transition metal atoms, also contribute to their instability inside fuel cells. The new insight into the atomic-level evolution of nanoalloy electrocatalysts during their lifetime is likely to inspire new efforts to stabilize transient structure states beneficial to their activity and stability under operating conditions, if not synthesize them directly.									20	1	0	0	2	0	21			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000465361800040	30860531

Here, we demonstrated that by doping the generally believed catalytically inert A-site of LaMnO3 (LMO) perovskite with strontium, the catalytic performance for advanced oxidation is surprisingly boosted. Specifically, La0.4Sr0.6MnO3-delta (LSMO46) was designed which exhibited a high specific activity (0.0608 min(-1)m(-2)) for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, similar to 6 times that of LMO and similar to 41 times that of reported nanosized MnFe2O4 and Fe/Fe3C. The superior activity was also embodied by low activation energy (44.3 kJ mol(-1)). Moreover, LSMO46 displayed a lower metal leaching and a better reusability than LMO and Fe/Fe3C and easy catalyst recovery for its magnetic behavior. Such enhanced catalytic activity was attributed to the positively-charged surface (8.3 mV) that favored the adsorption of negatively-charged organics and the presence of a large amount of surface anion defects (oxygen vacancies), created by the doping, that induced the generation of considerable amount of singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) which was demonstrated as the dominant reactive species by selective radical scavenging and EPR trapping. A coupled activation mechanism involving major singlet oxygen and minor free radicals was further proposed for the effective decomposition of organics in LSMO46/PMS system. The findings in this study thus provide us a new strategy for the development of efficient catalysts for advanced oxidation in environmental treatment.									82	8	0	0	27	0	85			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000445416900068

However, it is hampered by sluggish reaction kinetics, low mass loading, and volume change upon cycling. Herein, hierarchical NiCo2O4 architectures with 2D-nanosheets-shell and 3D-nanocages-core (2D/3D h-NCO) are directly assembled on nickel foam via a facile one-step way. The 2D nanosheets are in-situ generated from the self-evolution of initial NCO nanospheres. This 2D/3D hierarchical structures ensure fast ion/ electron transport and maintain the structural integrity to buffer the volume expansion. The 2D/3D h-NCO electrode with an ultrahigh mass loading (30 mg cm(-2)) achieves a high areal capacity of 4.65 C cm(-2) (equivalent to 1.29 mAh cm(-2)) at a current density of 4 mA cm(-2), and retains 3.7 C cm(-2) even at 50 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the assembled solid-state hybrid supercapacitor yields a high volumetric energy density of 4.25 mWh cm(-3) at a power density of 39.3 mW cm(-3) , with a high capacity retention of 92.4% after 5000 cycles. Therefore, this work provides a new insight to constuct hierarchical electrodes for energy storage application. (C) 2020 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Herein, we report on a facile surface-engineering strategy of building hierarchical nickel hydroxide nanosheet@nanowire array on Ni foam (Ni(OH)(2) NS@NW/Ni foam) as anode material toward superior urea electrolysis. This Ni(OH)(2) based-catalyst with peculiar nanosheet@nanowire configuration just requires a small potential of 0.34 V (vs. SCE) to drive 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea, which outperforms the one with pure nanosheet array architecture and even the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Further, a two-electrode electrolysis system is built here with the cathode of cobalt phosphide nanowire array on Ni foam (Co2P NW/Ni foam) and anode of Ni(OH)(2) NS@NW/Ni foam for overall urea electrolysis, which needs a low voltage of 1.58 V to drive 5 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea. Note that, the current density presented in this work is based on the real surface area of Ni foam but not the geometric area, unless otherwise specified. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Thereafter, the anodic polarization curves, cyclic voltammetry curves and tafel polarization curves for the composite inert anodes obtained under different WC concentrations in the original plating bath, were measured in a synthetic zinc electrowinning electrolyte of 50 g.L-1 Zn2+, 150 g.L-1 H2SO4 and 35 degrees C, and the microstructural features were also observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results show that the co-deposition of WC and PANI particles with Pb2+ in the original plating bath, changes the electrocrystallization morphologies for matrix metal Pb on aluminum substrates. Al/Pb-PANI-WC composite inert anode obtained under WC concentration of 30 g.L-1 and PANI concentration of 20 g.L-1 in the original plating bath, possesses uniform surface and cross sectional microstructures, higher electrocatalytic activity, lower overpotential of oxygen evolution, better reversibility of electrode reaction, better corrosion resistance and longer service times in a synthetic zinc electrowinning electrolyte of 50 g.L-1 Zn2+, 150 g.L-1 H2SO4 and 35 degrees C.

A characteristic of the rapid and incomplete catabolism of glucose is the secretion of lactate. Genome-scale metabolic models have been recently employed to describe the glycolytic phenotype of highly proliferating human cancer cells. Genome-scale models describe genotype-phenotype relations revealing the full extent of metabolic capabilities of genotypes under various environmental conditions. The importance of these approaches in understanding some aspects of cancer complexity, as well as in cancer diagnostics and individualized therapeutic schemes related to metabolism is evident. Based on previous metabolic models, we explore the metabolic capabilities and rerouting that occur in cancer metabolism when we apply a strategy that allows near optimal growth solution while maximizing lactate secretion. The simulations show that slight deviations around the optimal growth are sufficient for adequate lactate release and that glucose uptake and lactate secretion are correlated at high proliferation rates as it has been observed. Inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase-A, an enzyme involved in the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, substantially reduces lactate release. We also observe that activating specific reactions associated with the migration-related PLC gamma enzyme, the proliferation rate decreases. Furthermore, we incorporate flux constraints related to differentially expressed genes in Glioblastoma Multiforme in an attempt to construct a Glioblastoma-specific metabolic model and investigate its metabolic capabilities across different glucose uptake bounds.					12th IEEE International Conference on BioInformatics and BioEngineering (BIBE)12th IEEE International Conference on BioInformatics and BioEngineering (BIBE)	NOV 11-13, 2012NOV 11-13, 2012	IEEE; Cyprus Presidency Council European Union; IEEE Comp Soc; Univ Cyprus; Biol & AI Fdn (BAIF); Frederick Univ; Hellen Soc Computat Biol & Bioinformat (HSCBB); Tech Univ Cyprus; IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (IEEE EMBS); Int Federat Med & Biol Engn (IFMBE)IEEE; Cyprus Presidency Council European Union; IEEE Comp Soc; Univ Cyprus; Biol & AI Fdn (BAIF); Frederick Univ; Hellen Soc Computat Biol & Bioinformat (HSCBB); Tech Univ Cyprus; IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (IEEE EMBS); Int Federat Med & Biol Engn (IFMBE)	Larnaca, CYPRUSLarnaca, CYPRUS	2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2471-7819		978-1-4673-4358-9; 978-1-4673-4357-2	WOS:000315332900117

The compound exhibits a three-dimensional chain/snake structure consisting of -CoO6-[SrO7](proportional to)-CoO6- repeating units parallel to the [0 1 1] and [0 -1 1] directions. UV/Vis data are consistent with the cations being in high-spin octahedral symmetry. Magnetic measurements show antiferromagnetic interactions for all compounds with approximate 0 values of -0.5 K, except for the cobalt compound (-24.5 K) where the decrease of the chi(m) T curve can also be attributed to the spin-orbit coupling. Thermal analyses performed in air and under nitrogen show three consecutive steps: dehydration, ligand pyrolysis, and inorganic residue evolution. Thermal treatments in tubular furnaces were performed in order to obtain pure SrMO3-x phases. In all cases the oxides are nonstoichiometric and oxygen-deficient with structures related to that of perovskite. Lower temperatures and reaction times than those given in the literature have been used when using the ceramic method. These "soft" treatments gave rise to homogeneous particles of small grain size.									40	2	0	0	3	0	40			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000080432200003

In this work, the mechanism of CO2 reduction to methane (CH4) on catalysts (SACs) was studied by density functional theory calculations, a step forward to revealing the effects of the axial O atom (M-N4O-C) on their catalytic activity. The electrocatalytic reduction activity of CO2 over M-N4-C SACs is strongly dependent on the outmost d-shell electron numbers and electronegativity of the selected metals. The introduction of the axial O atom changes the coordination structure of the central metal atoms, which not only improves the stability of M-N4O-C SACs (especially electrochemical stability) but also affects the adsorption strength of intermediate species and then improves or reduces the catalytic activity, which depends on the intrinsic properties of the metal atoms. More importantly, by considering the comprehensive effects of the number of outmost d-shell electrons, the electronegativity, coordinate numbers, and bonding length of the central metal atom and the nearest neighbor atom, a descriptor (q)) based on the intrinsic properties of materials was developed to correlate the catalytic activity. The volcano-shaped relationships between the q) and limiting potentials were well established. In particular, five SACs (Mn-N4-C, Cr-N4-C, Os- N4O-C, Ru-N4O-C, and Rh-N4O-C) close to the summit of the volcano were screened. Based on this descriptor, the catalyst activity can be predicted directly from the characteristics of the material instead of the expensive calculation of adsorption energies. This work is of great significance for understanding the mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2RR and the design of efficient and stable electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000813289400001

In the catalytic process, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can be utilized to obtain effective catalysts for their porous structures and adjustable properties. In addition, the introduction of rare-earth (RE) elements with unique properties for catalysts can realize good catalytic performances. Thus, the RE-MOF related catalysts for catalytic conversion are summarized. Due to the cooperation of RE elements and porous MOF structures, the RE-based MOFs can be used as promising catalysts or precursors/supports for other catalysts in the areas of energy conversion, environmental governance, and organic synthesis. These aggregated studies highlight the RE-MOFs as promising candidates for catalytic conversion.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000619443000001	33605028	
J	You, Eunyoung; Lee, Seung Woo; You, Daejong; Lee, Bongho; Pak, Chanho								Effect of Metal Composition and Carbon Support on the Durability of the Reversal-Tolerant Anode with IrRu Alloy Catalyst								CATALYSTS				10	8					932	10.3390/catal10080932				AUG 2020	2020	In polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) for fuel cell electric vehicles, cell reversal (CR) at the anode side can occasionally occur-usually when hydrogen supply is interrupted-which results in degradation of the anode. To mitigate this problem, reversal-tolerant anodes (RTAs) using oxygen evolution reaction catalysts have been generally applied. Adding such materials promotes water oxidation and, thus, provides the protons and electrons during CR situation, while minimizing the carbon-oxidation reaction. In this study, we performed a detailed investigation of the sole use of IrxRuy/C catalysts for RTAs in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA)-including the effects of the IrRu alloy composition and the degree of graphitization of the carbon support on the durability under fuel starvation. Supported IrRu alloy catalysts with different Ir/Ru ratios were prepared via a facile impregnation method on carbon supports with differing degrees of graphitization by heat-treatment at a range of high temperatures. X-ray diffraction patterns indicated that the crystal structure of the alloy nanoparticles depended on the alloy composition, showing the development of a hexagonal closely packed structure with increasing Ru content. Raman spectroscopy indicated an increase in the degree of graphitization of carbon with progressively higher processing temperatures. Ir(x)Ru(y)alloys were found to be a suitable replacement for Pt anode from single-cell MEA performance testing. Furthermore, we examined the synergic enhancement of the CR durability of IrRu alloys with different compositions comparing to the Ir and Ru metals by measuring the initial and total voltage change of MEAs under hydrogen starvation. For the same alloy composition, higher CR durability was observed for MEAs with catalysts prepared using a higher degree of graphitization of the carbon support. Based on the results, we concluded that to develop efficient catalysts for RTAs of automotive PEMFCs, it is important to consider both the durability of the carbon support under high voltages and the catalyst composition.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2073-4344		WOS:000564677200001

Herein, we have synthesised spinel nickel ferrite nanofibers (NiFe2O4-NFs) via an electrospinning (ES) method followed by a carbonization process. The resultant fiber was subjected to electrocatalytic water splitting reactions in alkaline medium. The catalytic efficiency of the NiFe2O4-NFs in OER was highly satisfactory. But it is not high enough to catalyse the HER process. Hence, palladium ions were decorated as nanosheets on NiFe2O4-NFs as a heterostructure to improve the catalytic efficiency for HER. Density functional theory (DFT) confirms that the addition of palladium to NiFe2O4-NFs helps to reduce the effect of catalyst poisoning and improve the efficiency of the catalyst.

Thus, the search for low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts plays a vital role in water electrolysis. In recent years, metal alkoxides, which are a series of organic-inorganic hybrid compounds, have attracted tremendous attention in energy research owing to their appealing features of high porosity, large surface area, adjustable composition and regulated hierarchical structures. However, the development of metal alkoxides towards electrocatalysis has not been established systematically. Herein, we review and discuss the recent advances on metal alkoxides and their derivatives (including hydroxides, oxides, phosphides, sulfides, and selenides) for electrocatalytic water splitting. The fundamental principles of how to regulate their composition, phases and hierarchical structures to enhance their performance are highlighted, also including their correlative structure-activity relationship. Finally, the issues and future challenges with the use of metal alkoxide-based nanomaterials for electrocatalytic applications are proposed. This review aims to present a comprehensive understanding of metal alkoxide-based electrocatalysts and some suggestions for the future development of high-performance electrocatalysts for water splitting applications.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000539350100004

However, the multistep and multielectron process of methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) taking place at the anodic side in DMFC is an energy intense process. In addition, the in situ generated CO can severely deteriorate the catalytic efficiency of electrode material, which can be, however, realized to develop a competent catalytic module. Here, we present a first report on a highly interconnected and facile growth of vertically aligned Gd doped CoB assembled on the surface of rationally developed TiO2 nanoflower (NFs) for MOR. Initially, we developed the TiO2 NFs as support followed by cathodic deposition of Gd-CoO to create an electronic contact with underlying support. After then, finally treated with NaBH4 to further modify the surface of overall hybrid material, characterized with various techniques (UPS, XPS, XRD, SEM, TEM, Raman, and BET analyzer). During electrocatalysis, Gd-CoB@TiO2 was found highly efficient with inherently low charge transfer resistance (R-ct) and ability to generate highest current density (400 mA/cm(2)) with negligible loss in activity even after long term stability (20 h) while using highly concentrated methanol. Meanwhile, the surface modification with B, extended and highly interconnected nature of amorphous and promisingly mesoporous nanosheets in 3D manner further ameliorate the available surface for catalysis. In comparison with analogues samples and literature, it is anticipated that Gd could modify the electronic structure of overall hybrid in such way to energize the redox couple of Co+2/+3 in Gd-CoB against the CO poisoning effect. Further, the XPS and Raman analysis before and after catalysis also indicates that in-situ generated oxide/hydroxide formation with high inherent polarizability weaken the C-O-H bond of methanol and thus facilitate the dynamic release of involved intermediates.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000535724400001

The unique advantages of heteroatom-doped porous carbon-supported single-atom electrocatalysts (SAC-HDPCs) are clear. These SAC-HDPCs exhibit outstanding activity, selectivity and stability due to their distinct electronic structure, satisfactory conductivity, controllable porosity and heteroatomdoping effect. Rapid and significant developments involving the synthesis, characterization, and structure-property-function relationship of SAC-HDPCs have been made in recent years. In this review, we describe recent research efforts involving advanced (in situ) characterization techniques, innovative synthetic strategies, and electrochemical energy conversion examples of SAC-HDPCs. The electrocatalytic performance of SAC-HDPCs is further considered at an atomic level, and the mechanisms underlying this performance are also discussed in detail. We expect that these analyses and deductions will be useful for the design of new materials and may help to establish a foundation for the design of future SAC-HDPCs.

The calculations made use of mass cuts between the central neutron star and the ejected envelope by requiring ejected 56Ni-masses in agreement with supernova light curve observations. Specific emphasis is put on the treatment of the innermost layers, which are the source of 56Ni, the Fe-group composition in general, and some intermediate-mass alpha-elements like Ti. The predictions are compared with abundances from specific supernova observations (e.g. SN 1987A, 1993J) or supernova remnants (e.g. G292.0+1.8, N132D). The amount of detected 16O and 12C or products from carbon and explosive oxygen burning can constrain our knowledge of the effective 12C(alpha,gamma)16O rate in He-burning. The 57Ni/56Ni ratio can give constraints on Ye, in the innermost ejected zones. This helps to estimate the necessary delay time between collapse and the neutrino-driven explosion. Provided that the stellar pre-collapse models are reliable, this allows additional in-sight into the exact working of the supernova explosion mechanism. One can also compare the ejected composition with abundances in low metallicity stars, which reflect the average SNe II composition, integrated over an initial mass function of progenitor stars.

The structure and property of the modified beta-Ni(OH)(2) with CuO were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform infra-red (FT-IR), Raman and thermal gravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) techniques. The results of the FT-IR spectroscopy and TG-DTA indicate that the modified beta-Ni(OH)(2) electrode materials contain intercalated water molecules and anions. A pastedetype electrode was prepared using nickel hydroxide powder as the main active material on a nickel sheet as a current collector. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were undertaken to assess the electrochemical behavior of pure beta-Ni(OH)(2) and modified beta-Ni(OH)(2) electrode with CuO in a 6 M KOH electrolyte. The addition of CuO into bnickel hydroxide was found to enhance the reversibility of the electrode reaction and also increase the separation of the oxidation current peak of the active material from the oxygen evolution current. The modified nickel hydroxide with CuO was also found to exhibit a higher proton diffusion coefficient and a lower charge transfer resistance. These findings suggest that the modified beta-Ni(OH)(2) with CuO possesses an enhanced electrochemical response and thus can be recognized as a promising candidate for battery electrode applications.

Here, we report our findings on the exploration of glow discharge plasma (GDP) in improving the durability of the Mo2C quantum dots decorated N-doped carbon nanofiber (Mo2C@NCF) electrocatalyst. When employed in LOBs, the Mo2C@ NCF electrode treated with GDP (GDP-Mo2C@NCF) delivers a significantly enhanced discharge-charge stability, sustaining over 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g(-1)with a cut-off capacity of 1000 mA h g(-1). The GDP treatment breaks the native MoO(x)passivation layer on the surface of Mo2C quantum dots and promotes the formation of an interfacial Mo-N bond between Mo2C and the N doped in carbon fibers, leading to the enhanced cycling durability. The work opens a promising avenue for improving the performance of LOBs through a facile surface modification.									1	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000553632500040

Single-atom-catalysts (SACs) have gained substantial attention thanks to their superior catalytic activity for CO oxidation, and graphene has been considered as one most promising supporting material owing to its peculiar physicochemical properties. In this work, the mechanism of CO oxidation over iridium (Ir) embedded on both single vacancy graphene (Ir-GN(SV)) and di-vacancy graphene (Ir-GN(DV)) has been investigated with the aid of density functional theory (DFT). The structural properties of Ir-GN(SV) and Ir-GN(DV) were analyzed by Bader charge analysis and electron density difference map. The calculated adsorption energy values of CO and O-2 molecules on both the Ir-GNSV and Ir-GN(DV) have validated that both molecules can be molecularly adsorbed on the surface of each catalyst at room temperature. The results put forth that the reaction mechanism of CO + O-2 -> OOCO -> CO2 + O* prefers to Langmuir Hinshelwood (LH) mechanism. The activation energy for the transition-state for Ir-GNSV has been calculated to be 0.31 eV, whereas the first transition state (TS1) and the second transition state (TS2) of Ir-GN(DV) have been determined as 0.30 eV and 0.26 eV, respectively. Moreover, the results have confirmed that Ir-GN(SV) and Ir-GN(DV) surfaces have high catalytic activity and selectivity towards CO oxidation. On the basis of these findings, the proposed Ir-GN(SV) and Ir-GN(DV) catalysts are considered to be promising SAC for CO oxidation at low-temperature. It can be speculated that this work paves the way for the engineering of boosted-performance Ir-based heterogeneous catalysts by providing deeper mechanistic insights.									37	0	0	0	10	0	37			2468-0230			WOS:000681234400005

Herein, by systematically varying the concentration of Na+ and OH- at the same absolute electrode potential, we demonstrate that higher concentrations of cations (Na+), rather than OH-, exert the main promotional effect on the production of C2+ products. The impact of the nature and the concentration of cations on the electrochemical reduction of CO is supported by experiments in which a fraction or all of Na+ is chelated by a crown ether. Chelation of Na+ leads to drastic decrease in the formation rate of C2+ products. The promotional effect of OH- determined at the same potential on the reversible hydrogen electrode scale is likely caused by larger overpotentials at higher electrolyte pH.									46	0	0	0	6	0	44			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000505807900001	31814246	
J	Ohiff, A; Pulst, S; Lefeber, C; Peulecke, N; Arndt, P; Burkalov, VV; Rosenthal, U								Unusual reactions of titanocene- and zirconocene-generating complexes								SYNLETT					2			111	118						FEB 1996	1996	The titanocene alkyne complex without any additional ligands Cp(2)Ti(Me(3)SiC=CSiMe(3)) 1 and the zirconocene alkyne complexes free from stabilizing phosphine ligands Cp(2)Zr(L)(Me(3)SiC=CSiMe(3)) (L = THF 2, pyridine 3) as well as the metallacyclic complex Cp(2)Zr-O-CMe(2)-C(SiMe(3))=C(SiMe(3)) 4 react with some substrates in an unusual manner depending on metals M, ligands L and the substituents R of the substrates. Also in some cases the competitive reaction of coupling of the complexed alkyne occurs. In this account all products without coupling of the silylalkyne are numbered, the data of detailed NMR studies and X-ray crystal structure analyses are given in the cited references.The reaction of ''Cp(2)Zr'' with benzophenone gives the ligand stabilized metallocene eta(2)-ketone complex 5. With di(tert-butyl)acetylenedicarboxylate a coupling of a C=C- and a C=O-ester group to 6 and with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylenedicarboxylate an unusual 1,3-migration of a SiMe(3) unit from an oxygen to a carbon atom yielding the dimeric complex 7 occurs.Ketimines react with metallocenes either to the ligand stabilized eta(2)-complexes 8 or the derivatives bearing N-H functions to amido alkylideneamido complexes 9 and 10 by a hydrogen transfer reaction. Aldimines give the cyclic diamido complex 11 or in the case of a methyl group at the nitrogen under evolution of methane an unsaturated cyclic complex. Heterocyclic C=N systems, e.g. benzoxazoles or benzthiazoles, show a ring enlargement and a simultaneous coupling to 12 and 13 or, e.g. benzisoxazoles, yield without coupling the dimeric complex 14.Depending on metals, ligands, substituents and used stoichiometry the generated metallocenes ''Cp(2)M'' react with one equivalent of 1,4-disubstituted 1,3-butadiynes RC=C-C=CR' to give five-membered metallacyclic cumulenes 15 and 16 or with a half equivalent of the diyne the bimetallic complexes 17 - 19. Two diyne molecules are coupled by ''Cp(2)Ti'' to yield a titanacyclopentadiene 20 in contrast to ''Cp(2)Zr'', which gives the seven-membered zirconacyclic cumulenes 21 and 22.Also a novel cleavage of the central C-C single bond of the butadiynes by the metallocene occurs yielding the homobimetallic, doubly sigma,pi-acetylide bridged complexes 23 - 26. The heterobimetallic complex 27 was obtained in the reactions of the metallacyclocumulens 15 with ''Cp(2)Zr'' or 16 with ''Cp(2)Ti''. Complexes (Ph(3)P)(2)Ni(eta(2)-RC=C-C=CR') gives with ''Cp(2)Ti'' the Ni(0) complexed titanacyclocumulene 28 or with ''Cp(2)M'' the heterobimetallic sigma,pi-acatylide-bridged complexes 29 - 31.The metallocene units interact with one equivalent of an alkynylsilane carrying SI-H groups (RC=CSiMe(2)H) to yield cans-coordinated alkyne complexes with strong Si-H-M interactions like 32, which at low temperatures is in agreement with the description on the way to a novel hydride eta(3)-silaallenyl complex. Two molecules of the alkynylsilane are coupled to metallacyclopentadienes without Si-H-M interactions (e.g. 33).									74	1	0	0	1	0	74			0936-5214			WOS:A1996TV33700001

Ruddlesden-Popper type electrodes such as Pr2NiO4+delta have previously been proposed as attractive alternatives to conventional La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-delta/Ce1-xGdxO2-delta compositae air electrodes for both fuel cell and electrolyser modes of operation. However, Pr2NiO4+delta have been shown to have limited stability, reacting with a Ce1-xGdxO2-delta interlayer to form a Ce1-x-yGdxPryO2-delta (CGPO) phase of unknown stoichiometry. Additionally, Pr2NiO4+delta are known to decompose to Pr4Ni3O10 +/- delta under certain conditions.In this work detailed understanding of the chemical reaction between Pr2NiO4+delta and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-delta (CG010) under normal solid oxide cell fabrication and operating temperatures was obtained, identifying the composition of the resulting CGPO phase reaction products. It is shown that, in addition to the unreacted CGO10 present after sintering the compositae at 1100 degrees C for up to 12 h, a series of CGPO chemical compositions were formed with various Ce, Gd and Pr ratios depending on the relative distance of the doped ceria phases from the Pr2NiO4+delta phases. The extent of the chemical reaction was found to depend on the sintering time and the contact area of the two phases. Further thermal treatment of the resulting products under SOC air electrode operating temperature (800 degrees C) resulted in the initiation of Pr2NiO4+delta decomposition, forming Pr4Ni3O10 +/- delta and Pr6O11 with no detectable change in the composition of previously formed Pr-substituted ceria phases. It is apparent that the Pr2NiO4+delta/CGO10 compositae is unsuitable as an air electrode, but there is evidence that the decomposition products, Pr4Ni3O10 +/- delta and Ce1-x-yGdxPryO2-delta are stable and suitable candidates for SOC electrodes.

The mutants carrying these replacements individually, L343F and A344S, showed a wild-type phenotype. In contrast, the double mutant, L343FA344S, evolved O-2 at only 20-30% of the wild-type rate and was unable to grow photosynthetically. In this mutant, PSII accumulated to 60% of the wild-type level, indicating that the O-2-evolving activity per PSII was reduced to approximately half that of the wild-type. However, the amount of Mn atom detected in the thylakoids suggested that a normal amount of Mn cluster was assembled. An investigation of the kinetics of flash-induced fluorescence yield decay revealed that the electron transfer from Q(A)(-) to Q(B) was not affected. When a back electron transfer from Q(A)(-) to a donor component was measured in the presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenol)-1,1 -dimethylurea, a significantly slower component of the Q(A)(-) oxidation was detected in addition to the normal component that corresponds to the back electron transfer from the Q(A)(-) to the S-2-state of the Mn cluster. Thermoluminescence measurements revealed that L343FA344S cells contained two functionally distinct Mn clusters. One was equivalent to that of the wild-type, while the other was incapable of water oxidation and was able to advance the transition from the S-1-state to the S-2-state. These results suggested that a fraction of the Mn cluster had been impaired by the L343FA344S mutation, leading to decreased O-2 evolution. We concluded that the structure of the C-terminus of D1 is critical for the formation of the Mn cluster that is capable of water oxidation, in particular, transition to higher S-states.

However, the variable and intermittent nature of solar energy and the co-production of H-2 and O-2 significantly reduce the flexibility of this approach, increasing the costs of its use in practical applications. Herein, using the reversible n-type doping/de-doping reaction of the solid-state polytriphenyl-amine-based battery electrode, we decouple the H-2 and O-2 production in acid water electrolysis. In this architecture, the H-2 and O-2 production occur at different times, which eliminates the issue of gas mixing and adapts to the variable and intermittent nature of solar energy, facilitating the conversion of solar energy to hydrogen (STH). Furthermore, for the first time, we demonstrate a membrane-free solar water splitting through commercial photovoltaics and the decoupled acid water electrolysis, which potentially paves the way for a new approach for solar water splitting.									43	7	0	0	2	0	48			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000426490700025	29384260

The coating was performed by chemical surface precipitation under different conditions. The structure, morphology, chemical composition and electrochemical properties of two different samples with surface coating of Y(OH)(3) were characterized and compared. The results show that a two-step oxidation process exists in the oxidation procedure of spherical Ni(OH)(2) corresponding to the formation of Ni(III) and Ni(IV), respectively. The conversion of Ni(III) to Ni(IV) is regarded as a side reaction in which Ni(IV) species is not stable. The presence of Y(OH)(3) on the particle surface can restrain the side reactions, especially the formation of Ni(IV). The application of coated Ni(OH)2 to sealed Ni-MH batteries yielded a charge acceptance of about 88% at 60 degrees C. The results manifest that the high-temperature performance of Ni(OH)(2) electrode is related to the distribution of the adding elements in surface oxide layer of Ni(OH)(2), the sample with dense and porous coating surface, larger relative surface content and higher utilization ratio of yttrium is more effective.

Many gases (e.g., CO, CO2, H-2, H2O, H2S, N-2 and O-2) of interest to energy and environmental applications were tested. The results show that SAC-Mn alters chemisorption processes with all gas molecules except N-2. Clear adsorption selectivity is obtained towards oxidizing CO, CO2 and O-2 molecules as evidenced by the enhancements in binding energy and charge transfer and the reduction in magnetization. While the SAC-Mn contributes predominantly to Fermi-energy region with spin-down states, the strong binding to oxidizing molecules introduces there more spin-up states to compromise and reduce the magnetization. Hence, C2N-NR:Mn is proposed to be used as platform for gas sensor (if combined with magnetic sensor) to yield high selectivity toward these latter gases.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2045-2322			WOS:000684832500001	34349212

Specifically, we address the quantification of adsorbed intermediates so that information such as the local surface coverage can be conveniently extracted from SI-SECM transients despite diffusional broadening. Using a time normalization parameter rho, we studied the time evolution of the SI-SECM signal and its impact on the titrated surface below the SECM tip. We identified the experimental and time conditions on which diffusional broadening dominates the signal. Our simulated results suggest that, while this effect decreases the spatial resolution of the SI-SECM process, it enhances significantly the measured signal. It is also a strong function of the SECM tip size, where quantification enhancements on nano-electrodes may facilitate their practical experimental deployment. A versatile parameter, p, not only allowed to understand practical enhancements, but also to guide the fitting of experimental results to theory. SI-SECM was used to quantify photogenerated intermediates of the photoassisted water oxidation reaction on lightly n-doped SrTiO3 using the ferri/ferrocyanide system as redox mediator. Agreement between simulated and experimental transients was excellent, and fitting allowed us to determine the potential-dependent surface coverage of hydroxyl radical intermediate, which ranged from 0.04 to 0.50 C/m(2). The analysis and experimental demonstration introduced here move SI-SECM forward as a quantitative platform to study (photo) electrocatalytic samples without needing to constrain the size of the interrogated electrode. Furthermore, they establish SI-SECM as an analytical tool for mechanism-focused study of adsorbed intermediates and photocatalytic processes that occur on semiconducting and insulating surfaces, where quantification of surface reaction intermediates with view towards the nano-scale remains challenging for other electrochemical and spectroscopic approaches.

Structurally, the title MOF possesses a trinucleate Cd(ii) based 2D double-layer with the protonated AD cations as the template encapsulated into the grids. The combination of experiments and theoretical calculations reveals that the orderly arrangement of EtOIPA dimers, protonated AD cations and trinucleate Cd(ii) clusters generates highly delocalized pi-electron channels with a prolonged exciton lifetime. The MOF powders show bright yellow emission with a long lifetime of 50.63 ns. Photoelectrochemical measurements reveal a high photocurrent density ratio of 290 between light and dark conditions at 0 V bias potential, making it a perfect self-driven photodetector. By coating the yellow phosphor on a commercially available blue LED, a high performance white LED with CIE, CCT and CRI values of (0.325, 0.336), 88.2 and 5844 K, respectively can be obtained.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000830014000001	35880646

However the amorphous character of these catalysts and the complexity of the interfacial architectures that merge charge transport properties of electrode and semiconductor supports with discrete sites for multi-step catalysis poses challenges for probing mechanisms that activate and tune sites for catalysis. This minireview discusses advances in soft X-ray spectroscopy and high-energy X-ray scattering that provide opportunities to resolve interfacial electronic and atomic structures, respectively, that are linked to catalysis. This review discusses how these techniques can be partnered with advances in nanostructured interface synthesis for combined soft X-ray spectroscopy and high-energy X-ray scattering analyses of thin film and heterogenized molecular catalysts. These combined approaches enable opportunities for the characterization of both electronic and atomic structures underlying fundamental catalytic function, and that can be applied under conditions relevant to device applications.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000545253700004	32567636

However, commercialization is impeded by prohibitively high costs and scarcity. One of the most effective strategies to reduce Pt loading is to deposit a monolayer or a few layers of Pt over other metal cores to form core-shell-structured electrocatalysts. In core-shell-structured electrocatalysts, the compositions of the core can be divided into five classes: single-precious metallic cores represented by Pd, Ru, and Au; single-non-precious metallic cores represented by Cu, Ni, Co, and Fe; alloy cores containing 3d, 4d or 5d metals; and carbide and nitride cores. Of these, researchers have found that carbide and nitride cores can yield tremendous advantages over alloy cores in terms of cost and promotional activities of Pt shells. In addition, desirable shells with reasonable thicknesses and compositions have been recognized to play a dominant role in electrocatalytic performances. And recently, researchers have also found that the catalytic activity of core-shell-structured catalysts is dependent on the binding energy of the adsorbents, which is determined by the d-band center of Pt. The shifting of this d-band center in turn is mainly affected by strain and electronic effects, which can be adjusted by adjusting core compositions and shell thicknesses of catalysts. In the development of these core-shell structures, optimal synthesis methods are of primary concern because they directly determine the practical application potential of the resulting electrocatalysts. And in this article, the principles behind core-shell-structured low-Pt electrocatalysts and the developmental progresses of various synthesis methods along with the traits of each type of core and its effects on Pt shell catalytic activities are discussed. In addition, perspectives on this type of catalyst are discussed and future research directions are proposed.									57	3	0	0	1	1	60			2520-8489	2520-8136		WOS:000606748400003

The modeled sub-micron particle mass is up to similar to 75% composed of SOA formed from highly oxidized multifunctional organic molecules (HOMs) with low or extremely low volatility. In the model the newly formed particles with an initial diameter of 1.5 nm reach a diameter of 7 nm about 2 h earlier than what is typically observed at the station. This is an indication that the model tends to overestimate the initial particle growth. In contrast, the modeled particle growth to CCN size ranges (> 50 nm in diameter) seems to be underestimated because the increase in the concentration of particles above 50 nm in diameter typically occurs several hours later compared to the observations. Due to the high fraction of HOMs in the modeled particles, the oxygen-to-carbon (O V C) atomic ratio of the SOA is nearly 1. This unusually high O V C and the discrepancy between the modeled and observed particle growth might be explained by the fact that the model does not consider any particle-phase reactions involving semi-volatile organic compounds with relatively low O V C. In the model simulations where condensation of low-volatility and extremely low-volatility HOMs explain most of the SOA formation, the phase state of the SOA (assumed either liquid or amorphous solid) has an insignificant impact on the evolution of the particle number size distributions. However, the modeled particle growth rates are sensitive to the method used to estimate the vapor pressures of the HOMs. Future studies should evaluate how heterogeneous reactions involving semi-volatility HOMs and other less-oxidized organic compounds can influence the SOA composition-and size-dependent particle growth.									19	0	0	0	3	0	19			1680-7316	1680-7324		WOS:000406152600001
